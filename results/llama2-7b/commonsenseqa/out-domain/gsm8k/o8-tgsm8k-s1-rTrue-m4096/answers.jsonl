He owns 12 hours of man-power that he will use to plant and till the fields. One tractor takes 20 hours of man-power. What is the farmer's best plan to plant as much corn as possible? Input: A farmer has 2,500 hectares of land that she would like to plant corn over. Corn requires her to plant a 1.5 million square meters each day. She only has five man-power hours per day from her husband to help her plant. Her 1.5 acres a day need about two tractors to use so they can do two plots a day. What is her optimal plan to plant all of her corn?\nOutput: If all the plots are planted in one day it will take 40 hours of husband's and tractors' time and 200,000 square meters of planting area. If all the plots are not planted at once, then first day is 100,00 square meters, and second day is 50,000 squares meters, and third day is 200,609 square meters.\nSo the optimal plan is to plant all of her area with three tractors because it needs 1000 hours of man power, 12,000,00 tractor's hours.\nThis answers A. If the answer was not A, then the farmer's most efficient plan would be to plant 1/4 of her area on day one and then repeat for the other days. However, on the first day of this plan, the plot is planted at a rate of 333 square meters per hour. So farming with just two tractors is not an efficient way to plant the area because she only needs to plant at a rate of 12,500 square meters per hour. By using three tractors and being very precise with the rate of the plots, she can farm 12,060,909 square meters per hour. This is the most efficient way to plant the", "answer": "D: atlas"}

How heavy is it if you fill it with salt water?\nOutput: Let the salt water weight be x times of the bottle. That means, 1000L water weighs around (9561)N. So the salt water weight be (9561*x)N. So the total weight of the bottle will be 1000 + (9561x)N. Because there is no information about the percentage of salt water or the amount that is in the bottle, we cannot answer this question. I assume this question should be answered if you add only one liter of salt water to the bottle. So I assume the final formula is 1000+1000n. Where n is the amount of salt water in the bottle. n can be anything less than 1000. For 1000 liters of water, it will be 1. This can make the weight of the bottle be 1001 (1000*1). Which means, 1011 lbs = 1000 lbs 1 lb = 0.01011 lbf", "answer": "C: saturated with water"}

If she was at the mountains her body temperature would decrease by 1\u00baF.  At what temperature was Sarah if the difference between the normal and the average temperature was 4\u00baF?\nOutput: Sarah was either at the beach or the mountains if her average skin temperature was 91\u00baF\nIt was not 92\u00baF.\nThe average skin temperature was 4\u00ba lower than the normal body temperature\nTherefore, her original normal body temperature was either 95\u00baF or -35\u00baF (the temperature was -35\u00baF when she was at the mountains).\nSince the difference in temperature was 4\u00ba, her body temperature must have been either 91\u00baF or -33\u00baF.\nTherefore, it was either 91\u00ba or -33\u00ba (it was 91\u00ba because that is the only temperature that makes a difference equal to 4).\nSo the final answer was 91\u00ba\n\nInput: Alice is 12 years old and her sister, Beth, is 10 years old.

The host then asked the audience how many more celebrities would have to die in 2023 in order to equal 5 per week? I thought it was a funny question, but I gave it thought. Let's see where we go with this. My first thought is that 5 per week is over-represented, since I know we know that 5 per week, if constant, would require 260 over a year. However, I know that 197 in 2020 would require 238 (365/5). So then I thought 238 was the magic number. But then I took 152 (238-4), so if 238 celebrities would be required for 5 per week, but we only had 152 in 2021, then we would need an additional 86 deaths in 202 to get 5 deaths per week.", "answer": "D: lap"}

What is the probability that 1: The first person is a fork-thrower 2: The second person is a fork-user if the first person is a fork thrower 3: The third person is a fork-eater if the second person is a fork user and the first person is a spaghetti throw?\nExample: Say the 3 people were A,B,C where: A=The first person is a fork user  B=The second person is a fork throwe C=The third person is a fork eater  In this example: 1 is the first question where A=Fork user and B is already a fork eater. 2 is the second question where, if A is a fork user, B will be a fork thrower and is the third question where, if B is a fork thrower, C will be a fork eater.\nOutput: If the first person is a forker user, the second person will most likely be a fork thrower so it's at least a 10% chance.   It's unlikely the third person is a fork throw because in the first 2 questions C would have been a fork eater.   Therefore, it's 10% for the third person.  To find the probability that the third person is a spaghettieater, you must do 0.1 * 0.05 = <<0.1*0.,05=0.05>>0.05 therefore there's about a 0.05% chance the third person is a forker eater.\nHence 0.1*0.05 = 0.05 (0.1 x 0.05) so the answer is 0.25\n```", "answer": "E: car"}

Or, you could tell them the team names and what time they play today.\n\nYou could also just tell them two teams and the stadium they'll be playing at.\n\nIn programming, there are multiple ways we could solve the same problem. If we look at it by problem definition, you could ask yourself the following:\n\nWhat do I have?\nWhat do I want?\nWhat do I do to get it?\n\nThat's similar to what our first question wants us to do. For example, the question says:\n\nToday is your sister's birthday.\n\nYou have to buy her a present\nThe person wants you to do two different things:\nYou need to buy a present for your sister\n\nSo what do we have?\n\nWe have the question that gives us information about the present.  We know it has to be something small and colorful.  We get a lot of information about the present.\n\nNow, what is missing?\n\nWe need the information about how big the present can be.\nWe only have the information that the present can't be bigger than 2 feet tall.\n\nSo, what do we do?\n\n\n\nWell, if we want her to open it today, that's what we need. That's what we can use as a limitation of information.  So we see there are two different ways we can solve this. Either we take everything we know about the", "answer": "C: argument"}

If each student is a different letter of a particular word, how many different words can be created?\nOutput:  There are 65 children, all with own names. We have 26 English alphabet letters (A, B, C,..). So the problem can be solved by using Combinations of 26 elements, i.e by using the formula nCk = {n  choose  k}.\n\nFor example, consider a class of 8 students and a word \"apple\".\nThere are 8 ways of selecting one from all 6 alphabet letters present in class.  The result is apple.\nWe can repeat this 8 times to give us 8 possible outcomes.\nEach individual can be selected in 1 way, so we have 1 possible outcome for each student.\nSo, there are 8*1 ways to select all 8 students with the name \"apple\". Now, we can select another word containing the same 6 alphabet letters but with different names. Repeating the process, we can choose all possible names, which gives us 26+24+22+20+18+16+14+13+12=81 ways.\nSince, there are 65 students, the result is (65C8)!\n\nInput: The number 4 is divisible by any prime (one digit) number.

If one-third of his total patients lives on Street A and one-fourth of his patients lives on Street B, how many patients live on Street B?\nOutput: Since there is already information that the doctor has some patients on Street A, we have to determine how many patients are on Street A compared with Street B.\nHere we have the information that there are patients on both Street A and Street B, but not the patient total. So, the first step is to determine how many patients live on each street by dividing the total number of patients by the number of each street:\nSo, 3/total patients = 1/N\nSolving for N, we get N= Total patients/3, where N refers to how many patients live on street A. We have 3/total patients=1/street A. Plugging in that number, we can write 4/stree A=1. We need the answer in fraction form, so to convert 3/4 to /4, we need to multiply by 1/4.\nSo 3 divided by 4 is 1/4, and 1/4 times 4 is 4/4.\nSo, 3=1, or 3/4 =4/4. Street A has 1/4 of patients on Street A, and Street B has 3/4 of patients on street B.\nStreet A: 1/4 Street B: 3/4\nSince there is 3/4 on street B and 1/4 on street A, street A has 1/9 less patients.\nSo, there are 8 patients on street B.", "answer": "E: hair salon"}

I can tell you that in base-10, the sum of the last four digits is 100. So the product of the last four digits will be at least 100 (and equal to 100 if the base is 10). Also the last digit of the number will be somewhere in the second quadrent (right justified). So the number can be divided by 100 as well 100. With these restrictions, the number can only be one of 15 numbers since the quotient is between 0 and 14 inclusive.

If one of the numbers are negative, a is negative and the equation becomes a<-b=c. Now if any two numbers are negative, and the equation becomes a<=-b=c.  If one is positive, a becomes positive, and so does the equation. Now with all the numbers positive, the equation is positive and that is what we aim to find.\nOutput:  Let us make an addition of '-b' and '-c'. Adding two negative numbers in algebra gives us a positive number. And this addition is done with the help of addition sign for negative numbers. Now, let's subtract a from the final answer from the final answer. Thus we have a<=-b=b+c. We then find a from the result b+c, and now we subtract b from this result to get a<-c=c. Finally, we subtract c from this result to get b<=-(-c). Subtracting b and c from this result gives us -b-c=c. With all positive numbers, we have an equation that is positive. Thus, the final answer is -b-c=<c>.\n\nInput: If the equation a-b+c-d=e. To solve this equation one has to consider that since b and d are unknown variables, and these variables have to get subtracted from e. And once e is obtained, the equations are b-d=<e-b>. Similarly to solve the other two equations, we have to follow along the same steps and then add a and c and this resulting value has to be added to d and then subtracted from e.

What\u2019s the probability that I get one with the 2//5 on its reverse, and the 7/5 on its other side?\nOutput: For the first coin, 2/5 * 2/5 is 1/25\nFor the second coin, 2/25 * 7/25 is 14/125 For the third coin, 7/125 * 2/25 = 14/625\nI shuffle all of the coins together. There is a 1/25 probability of getting the first coin, and 14/1300 probability of getting the second coin. Since this is equally likely with both coins, I multiply by 14/14=1 to get 1/300 probability of this coming up.

If it is three times as many cookies as one kind of cookie but two times as many cookies as another kind of cookie, how many of the third kind of cookie do they have in the bakery?\nOutput: There is three times as many of one type of cookie, and there is also two times as many of another type of cookie. The third choice of cookies is in the middle, with 2/3 of each.\nLet B and C represent how many of the one other kind, and how many of the another. We know the total is 5, B + C = 5, and C = 2B. C is found to be 2B, and B is found by solving 2B = 5 / 3, so B is 3. The original statement of two times as many cookies is B as there is B in the total, so we conclude there are 3 times as many cookies as the other kind. That means we should be solving for C = 2 * 3. Doing so, you also find C=2 * 3. The final calculations are: B = 3; C = 2 * B; 2 * 3 = C; Therefore answer will B + C = 2 times and the result is 3 cookies of the third kind.\nSo the final ans is 3\n\ninput: The temperature in Hawaii is very warm.

Would algebra be required if I get a bachelors degree in mathematics?\"\nThis is a common misconception, many people think algebra is a requirement for studying math. It actually has little to do with calculus. Many mathematicians consider themselves to be at the top of the scale for skills in the mathematical realm, but all of the people I know who are exceptional in mathematics are very skilled at algebra.

Every day in a week has 7 days. 11 x 52 = <<52>>52 times, because one month has seven days, and there is one year. This is in total 641 days to wait for. Each day has 24 hours and 365 days in a year; there are 19 days left, 19/24 = <<19/24=0.79>>0.79 of a day. We should subtract that from 24. 641 - 19 = <<641-19=622>>622 days later, you could finally see your friends again. So the final answer is 7 years. 7 years is equal to 364 * 7 = <<364*7=2528>>2,528 days or 2528/24 = <<2528/7=364>>364 months. (364 * 12=<<364*12=4336>>364 years) I'm still trying to figure out how to convert months to years. I might end up using math. To make it simpler, let's convert it to weeks. So if 364 months is 30 years, then 1 month is 30/12 days. If 1 month is 12 days, then 30 weeks are also 12 (days) in 1 month. 40 weeks in a year. That means 364 months are 30 years.

Choices:  January February March April May June July August September October November December\nOutput: A 12-month year is when years are divided by 12 and not by 10. There's an old saying that says \"Every fourth year is a leap year\". But it's important to remember that it's not true. Because if that were true, years that are evenly divisible by 4 would always end in 04. So, what about the 5 odd-numbered years? You're probably wondering why those years are not included in the saying. Well, let's go back a little. If we add one year to a leap year, we end up with a \"non-leap year\". So if you want to include every 4th year, just add 1 to every non-leap year and it'll end up being a year that follows the leap year.\n\nInput: Which way does a 4-letter word travel across a letter grid, from left to right or from right to left?

The total expense is $150, hence the difference is 150-90=<<150-96=54>>54 dollars.\nTherefore each person should pay $54 to come up with 54*3=<<54*3=162>>162 dollars.\nThus, each person should pay $162 to come up with $162*2/3=<<101=101>>101 dollars each.\nThus, Sarah paid $101, Mary paid $100, and Tuyen paid $101.\nSo the final answers are $101, 100 and 101 respectively.\n\nInput: Sarah's math teacher asked her for a math question.

Choices A: increases by 10 percent B: stays the same  C: decreases by 10 percent D: decreases by more than 10 percent E: decreases by less than 10 percent\nOutput: Since the discount is only on the purchase price of the car, the dealership adds the discount to the final price of the car. If the discout is on the Purchase Price, then the Average Price will be  the Purchase Price * 1.1 = <<1.1 * 1.1=1.11>>1.11\nSo, the Final price increases by 9.1% = <<0.091=0.91>>9.1\nSo, the average price increases by 91% / 100 = <<91/100=0.910>>0.910\nSo, the Final Average Price increases by 0.910 / 10 = <<0.910/10=0.091>>0.091\nSo the final answer will be 0.91\n\nInput: There is a large box of apples on a table.

How many place holders remain in the equation?\n\nOutput: It's a little tricky because it does not tell me what a \"place holder\" is.  For instance, if this question had been set up as follows:\n\nThe first number the place holder can equate to is 4 because the equation can look like this:  540 = 5*(x + 4)\n\nThe next can be 1 because we now have the equation:  540 + 4 = 5(x + 1)\n\nIf we continue with this pattern, the place holder that results from the equation of 540 + 90 = 5(x - 1) must be 7 because 90 + 16 = 5(x-1)\n\nIf the place holder 16 replaces 1, then we must replace the 16 with 84 in order to get 84 = 5(2 - 1), or 84 = 4.  Therefore, 84 = 8, and 8 = 7.\n\nAs a result, we can conclude that 7 is the replacement for x.\n\nSo the answer would be A because: 7 x 13 equals F\n540 = 7 * 13     ->  x + y = 7   -> x = 7 - y\nThe equation becomes:  540 - 84 = 7(11-1)\n\nThe answer is B: 14, because 14 x 22 equals J\n\nInput: What does 14-9+4-5=C?

(No one took any pencil home)\nOutput: On Friday, Alicia had 0 pencils, meaning she owns x zeroes pencils on Friday and she asked her brother for one pencil. On Saturday, she goes to the zoo with her brother. She still has her one pencil and her brother got another pencil. (He can't have more than one, but he still has two. The extra pencil is not his and he gave it to Alicia, so the only pencil he owns) The number of pencils (x + 2) increases by 2 on Saturday. On Sunday, Alicia still has x pencils.

Choice A is incorrect because this equation does not meet the 4 number requirement.  Choice C is the equation for the sum of a list of 2 odd  numbers.  This can be shown if the equation is rewritten as (2A+4)C.  Choice D is the equation for the list of both even and odd numbers.  Both even and odd numbers add to give you an even sum.  Hence, the sum of the even and odd numbers is (4(2N+1)+2) (N+2).  If A >0 and A = N.  So if A=N, then D = (4A+2) * (N+2).\nOutput:A is incorrect because it does not meet the 2 number requirement on the equation.  C is the correct equation for the sum of 2 odd numbers.  This can also be confirmed by (4A+2)=C or (2A+4)=c.  D is equivalent to E by subtracting A from both sides and then adding (N+2) to both sides.  It then becomes ((2N+1)+4)(N+2).  Subtract 4 from both sides and then subtract N from both sides and it reduces to the same equation as E, which we know is the sum of even and odd numbers.\nSo the final answers is E\n\nInput:What was the result of the \"Battle of St. Louis\" between the state militia and the", "answer": "E: reproduce"}

If he wanted to stop competing, it is likely he would be feeling: 1. relief (if he had been winning); 2. pressure to stop (if he was at the brink of losing); 3. death (the pressure of never stopping).\nThe feeling of death can be excluded as the correct answer because it's a feeling felt in competition, and James isn't a loser to begin with, or he couldn't be trying to quit in the first place.\n\"Trying harder\" is an ineffective answer as well because that is actually what he's trying to quit.\n\"Winning or losing\" will only help if he's actively trying to win, but since James stopped in the first place he is not, so it is not the right answer either.\nTo get a sense of the true meaning of life, we should look at the meaning behind James's desire to quit. From this, we see the real meaning and significance of his choosing is: 1. wanting to stop competing and start enjoying life (his true desire to quit is a form of pressure to try harder, see (B)); 2. wanting to stop and start enjoying life, not necessarily as a victory of not losing, but simply as an enjoyment of having completed a competition.\nThus, James wants to quit competing because he is feeling pressure to compete; he wants to quit competing in order to enjoy life.\nSo the final question is what choice(s) did he choose, which would be either (B) \"trying harder\" OR (E) \"enjoying life\"\nSo the final answer should be either trying harder OR enjoying life\n\nInput: How many times can you subtract 4 from 81?\nOutput: 81 = 81\n81 - 4 = 77\n77 - 4 = 33\n33 - 4 = 29\n29 - 4 = 15\nYou cannot subtract 4 from 15.\nSo the final choice is: You cannot subtract 4 from every single number\n\nInput: The number 30 is 200% of what number?\nOutput: 30 * 2 = 60\n60 * 100 = 6000", "answer": "A: pressure"}

He can earn $15 an hour by cleaning houses, and $8 an hour by shoveling snow. One day he makes $57 shoveling snow. How much can he work to earn $102 to pay for a baseball season?\n\nOutput:\nJoe's pay as a professional baseball player is equal to $22.0 times the number of hours worked, for 22.0 being the constant of proportionality. Let his normal pay for cleaning, shoveling snow, and a baseball season be \\(P\\), \\(S_{2}\\), and \\(S_{3}\\), respectively.\nIt's reasonable to assume one hour of working snow pays him 8 times $8 = $64, for a total of $116,\nand one hour of work pays him 15 times $15 = $225, for a total of \\$325.\nSo, he worked 5 hours cleaning, 8 hours shoveling snow,\nand 4 hours shoveling baseball payoffs, adding to 17 hours of paid work.\nTo afford paying for a season of $102\n\nJoe must work 17 hours / $22 = $7.75,\nfor a total of 20 hours or so.\n\nInput:You are playing a game where points are awarded in a linear fashion.

However, when just two people are having it the race is completed in 40 minutes.

With three people, then 60.\nTherefore, the average times for every participant is half of the time of a race with no one at all.\nSince the total time can be found to be:\n(2 * 40) + (3 * 60) + (40 + 60) + 40 = <<2*40+3*60=180+240+240=660>>660\nFor every participant, you can plug 40 and you'll find that the time is half of the total race time.\nTherefore, each person's average race time = 180 * ((660 / 3) / 2) = <<180*(660/3)/2=180*(220/6)>>180*30 = <<180*360/6=12(16)>>12*16.\nSo, that gives you the answer of exactly twelve minutes for every person.\n\nInput: How can you reduce 16?\nOutput: Reduce 1", "answer": "B: good karma"}

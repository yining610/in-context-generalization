How many days does it take for each of them to wash 5/8 as many dishes?\n\n## Solution\n- Solution:\n\n    1. The time they spend washing dishes can be divided in half to get 360 minutes.\n\n    2.  If 360 minutes are divided into 1440 of cooking time, the result will be a number less than 360.\n\n    3. If 360 is added 720, the result has to be 1080.\n\n    4. Therefore, the number of days it takes for each of them to finish washing 5/8 of the dishes will be 5 and 1/8.\n\ninput:\n\noutput:", "answer": "A: original"}

Secondly we need to set a constant (in this case $12) as a lower bound for the first variable since lower bound can not be negative. The rest of logic is very straightforward.\n\nExample code:\n`const const const const BAL = 12; const const const const COST = 8; const const const const D = 2.5;`\n\n`//BAL lower bound, COST variable and D variable.`\n\n`//store bought 3 into a array`\n\n`let cost = []; let pricePls = []; for (i = 0; i < 3; i++){ if(i === 1) cost[i] = 3.5; if(i === 2) pricePls[i] = 46; }`\n\n`console.log(cost.join(\" \")) // $3.5 for store bought 3`;\n\n`console.table(pricePls)`\n\n`\n    [\n      '1',\n      '2.5',\n      '56'\n    ]\n`\n\nInput: James drinks 5 cans of soda + 64 oz of water per day.

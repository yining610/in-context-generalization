{"idx": 23, "text": "A freeway is a route from point A to Point B that is faster or quicker.  A radio is a way to send messages using radio waves.  Wires are a pathway for information to be sent.  A computer network is the communication between two or more computers.  An electrical circuit is the pathway that allows electricity to flow from a power source to an electrical device. Radio and Freeway are the least obvious for this answer.  But wires and ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT are the best answer.  Because wires and electrical circuit are the things used to send these messages (wires for radio, freeways, computer network and electrical circuit for electricity).\nThey are the best answers because computers run their programs and send signals using computers, not the wires because wires are what computers use to send signals.\nElectronic circuits are the circuit that electricity runs through.\nRadio waves are the way for radio communications to travel.\nFreeways (and highways) are used for transportation purposes (cars).\nFurniture is not a valid choice.

Choices:  Car and Bus.  Car, Bus, A car alone,A bus alone, Both Car and Bus.\nOutput: A car alone because a bus cannot travel alone.  So in nine hours a bus travels only half the distance of a car.  A car and bus travles less than a car alone because they both travel equally and you can divide distances.\nThe bus travels more because it travels a half as much as the car does.  If a bus travels half as much as a car, it must travel the same distance.\nA bus can go farther alone than a car goes for 12 hours because after a nine hour trip, it will travel half of that distance again.\n\nInput:You could send packages using a freight shipping service.

Choices:A) 18\nB) 21\nC) 6\nD) 12\nE) 6\nOutput: First, let\u2019s assume that all people work at the same pace and do each step at the same pace.  In that case, to get the number of pizzas, we simply need to multiply the number of people with the completion time.  So each person does 1/3 * 3 min= <<1/3*3=<10>>10 minutes of work.  Now to get the total number of people we use 6 people * 10 = <<6*10=60>>60\nThe total time is 3 min * 60 = <<3*60=180>>180.  In our problem, 30 min * 6 people = <<30*6=180>>, but now we know that it took 3 people 3 minutes to make one pizza, so that gives us a total of 18/1/3 = <<18/1/2=9>>9 pizzas.

In this problem, the number is 30. The number isn\u2019t divisible by 3 unless there are no 3s in it, so the number is 31 and the remainder is 2. To get 30, you can multiply 30 times -1 and the number (in this case, 31) will become 30.

{"idx": 168, "text": "This question asks me to determine if the word massive is opposite the word insubstantial, massless, dwarf, inconsequential or good.\nMy guess is A (Massive is opposite insubstantial). The definition for insubstantial is \"not having enough body or parts: not substantial\"\nSo I would expect answer B: Massless. Since all other answers are options, I'd go with the opposite of insubstantial and say that would be dwarf.\nTo see if my definition was correct I looked at an online dictionary. Based on the definitions for insubstantial I think the opposite of A (massive) would be dwarf (I like dictionaries). The dictionary defines dwarf as: 1 : of very short stature 2 : too small for its rank or purpose: substandard\"If my definition is correct than dwarf fits and if dwarf is the correct choice for the answer I would need to answer the rest of this test incorrectly for there to be a mismatch in answers.  Because the definitions are for insubstantial and dwarf this helps rule out choices F (good) and E (consequential) because they do not apply to insubstantial or dwarf. \nSo that means D (inconsequential) would have to be the answer and if that is the case I would need to answer incorrectly on the rest of the test.\nWhen looking at the answer choices to my question again:\nA) Dwarf (I'm wrong for guessing dwarf and it should be massive)\nB) Massless (I have no clue why they would choose such a unique choice, but it looks to be accurate)\nC) Good (Incorrect definition)\nD) Inconsequential (Correct)\nE) Consequential (Incorrect definition) \nSo I would not expect to see this wording on the test, but after researching and reading the definitions the answer would be D (inconsequental).\nSince I originally answered the question incorrectly, I decided to look at the actual answer choices from the test.\nThe answer choices were: A) Good, B) Massless, C) Dwarf, D) Inconsequential, E) Consequential.

If we choose excercise, we can also get some air but with exercise we can only find ourselves near a city.\nBoth are OK options but rock climbing is slightly better since it is further from civilization.\n\nInput: Lori is trying to think of a 4-digit number that has only two unique digits. If she selects the digits 1 through 9 at random, what is the probability that the two digits are consecutive?\n\nOutput: If we select any of the 10 numbers listed below, it is highly unlikely they will be consecutive.\n\n11\n15\n16\n17\n18\n21\n22\n23\n30\n31\n\nAs we can see the only options that are not consecutive are the options of 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 because each one of those numbers only have either 1 or 2 digits before or after it.\nWe have 9 numbers with only one digest, and 1 number with two digits. The probability of the digits being consecutive is 19/70.\n\nInput: Jane is going to buy a house. The price of a house depends inversely on the size of the house.

Whenever computers and artificial intelligence are discussed, the words \"thinking\" or being like humans does not seem to be in the conversation.  This is because no matter how many computers have been built and no matter how many lines of code have been written, computers are still fundamentally different from people.  The best they could do it replicate the way humans do things which is quite boring and takes up a lot of time.  Some of the key tasks that people can do effortlessly are quite difficult for computers and artificial intelligence to duplicate.  We want computers to be intelligent, and to achieve that, they require massive amounts of time.  If they are used for doing boring work that requires little critical thought, computers perform very well.\n\nInput: I'm so excited for basketball tonight! So I had to take a shower after school.

The clowns were floating at the bottom of the ocean and the strings were dangling down into the water. How far down did the strings go past the balloons? Choices:  <<B: 80 inches >>0<<70 inches\n<<80 inches>\nThe clowns are underwater so the whole balloon (including the string top) is submerged. The balloon is attached to the clown with a large floaty string.\nThe balloon is filled with water and the air expands to maintain the same volume inside the balloon. To calculate how long the string is underwater, we use the formula V = (pi/6)(r^3) where  V = Volume and r = Radius (distance from the centre of the balloon to the surface).\nSince the clown balloon is spherical (a sphere has points on its surface equally spaced), we take the circumference, which is 2x*pi*r = V.\nRearranging the terms, we get V= 2*pi*r, and since r = d/4 (radius is the distance from the centre of the sphere to the circle, we get d/4 = the radius of the balloon)\nSubbing in d/4 for r we get V =(2*pi)(d/4)^3 = 8\nAs far as the amount of string exposed we find, s = (d/4) - r  = V = (8)\n= (8) cm\nThis works out to d / [4 * sqrt(3)] = 85\nInput: John was playing at a football", "answer": "B: get laid"}

The three of you take turns driving, but each of the three of you can take only 1-hour of driving in any one 4-hour stretch.  How far could you travel in 48 hours?\nOutput: Let us consider this by dividing the question into two parts. For the first part suppose we take 18 hours to travel from California to Arizona because each drive is 1 hour so 4 x 1 hour drive = 4 driving hours so 4 x 4 hours drive=16 hours drive and that equals 18 hours.  And for the second part California is in the West coast and Arizona is in the East coast and that is how we get the straight line distance between California and Arizona is 18 hours to drive which leaves a 12 hours travel from Arizona to California or Grand Canyon and then from Arizona to Yosemite National Park which will be 12 hours to travel to reach Yosemite.\n\nInput:  In a competition, a team scores 7 runs in", "answer": "E: evil"}

If a couple is getting divorce, they will sell their house, sell one of the cars, sell the jewelry, the furniture etc. and divide the proceeds between them equally.  This results in children having fewer material things than when they were children.  They grow up and it is harder for them to obtain a mortgage for a house.  They are more likely to have a lower-paying job after they get divorce due to these lost assets.  Losing a spouse causes depression.  These are the reasons for (A), (B), and (D).\nNot sharing the assets of a divorcing couple does not cause the children to suffer.

Choices: A: 10 bags  B: 8 bags  C: 3 bags <<4>>4\nD: 2 bags <<14>>14  E: 4 bags\n\nOutput: They filled 6 baskets at the store so they went there 6 - 2 = <<3>>3 times to put bags in the cart which is <<6-2=3>>3 times\nThis means that they took 6 bags with them on the first journey and 3 bags for each of the other 5 journeys\nThus total amount of bags was <<6-2=2>>2 + <<5>5 = 8<<3>>8 bags\nThus they needed 8 bags not 2 bags which is D<<14>>14 D\n\n### Bonus Question:\nWhat is the last question?", "answer": "A: early morning"}
{"idx": 615, "text": "The person had to walk downstairs into the basement and search for the tool in the garage:  He had to walk downstares from the repair shop\nSo the final answer E\n\nInput:When it rains, the dog is always outside.  The dog is never in the house and never outside on a cloudy day.  On cloudy days, the cat is almost always outside, except on rainy days, on Mondays, and on Fridays.  The dog is on a different rooftop depending on the day. On snow days, the dog is always beside the cat on any particular roof. When the snow begins to melt, the dog moves to an adjacent roof. How many different rooftops does the dog visit on a snowy day if on each day, there are not less than 6 shingles that have not melted yet.\nOutput: The dog can visit up to 6 different rooftops on a snowy day assuming that there are not less than six shingles that have melted. Therefore, we can assume that there are at least 6 shingles on each rooftop.\nWe therefore have: Number of shingles, n, for a given roof = 5, 6,\u2026, x.\n1. The dog is on a given roof.  This implies that all other 5 shingles of that roof have melted.\n\n2. The dog visits an adjacent roof that only has 4 shingles left. There are now a total of 6 shingles. So, no shingles have melted. This means that the dog can only visit this roof once (we can assume that the roof is not in the same block as the original roof).\n\n3. The dog visits a roof that has only four remaining shingles. So far, only 8 (from roof on snow day) of the remaining 36 shingles have mlted (36-7=36-7). We can add one more to this roof (because it is adjacent to the two roofs) so far, we have a total of 9 shingles including the original roof.\n\n4. The dog visits roof with 3 remaining shingles. Now we have 9 + 4 = 13 + 1 = 14. We need to subtract", "answer": "B: basement"}

It cannot be yellow or orange because then the next would be blue and then the final four would be different colors. It could be green, but it can't be green or blue because otherwise, the next would be blue.  If it were purple, then the next would also be purple (if the next were blue/yellow it would be red or green or purple, since each of the other three are possible and purple is not).

Buried humans and animals should not be dug up.\n\n### Instruction:Answer the question below and type your code in 100 lines or fewer of C++.\nExplanation to the Instructions:\nAn excavation is the digging done by an archaeologist in an attempt to make an exciting discovery in history.  Excavation is one of history's most important discoveries and a valuable tool for archaeologists and historians.\nToday, we learned about the excavation project of a very important historic monument which happened 150 years ago.  The building is now buried so it is not easily visible to tourists, but it is located near the city square (E - excavation).  The monument is important to the area because it was built by the mayor of the city 100 years before the building is located.  However, the city's mayor does not know where the building is located.\n\n### Problem:A few months ago, a construction crew accidentally uncovered a forgotten cemetery which was dormant for over 100 years. The team leader believes that the construction site must be moved because the graves might cause accidents or injuries to the workers. You have been asked to investigate the construction site and report back if you believe it is safe to be build upon this land or not.\n\n### Method:\n### What is the minimum number of points per player for the team to tie the league record for bowling points?\n### How many points did the archaeologist excavate in the land at A?\n### Did she locate an old cemetery at the land at A?  If yes, she is a terrible archaeologist, so that is not the case.  If not, at least she knows where the land is.\n### How long ago was the building was built?  If it was at least 100 years, we should probably try other options. If it is at least 200 years, it would definitely be worth the cost.\n### How did the building become dormant?

I used a number for each character, and I only need for each answer to have 4 characters. This means that every answer I create for this will have 4 characters instead of 5, and you will have to guess the last one instead of just plugging your answer in there. Also, you will not be able to have any blank spaces between the choices. This is very difficult and I do not take any part in making this happen. Sorry for the inconvenience.

In this question we need to store input data in the form of array.\n2. Now to get the k-th smallest element we have two choices. First we can store k value at the start and then get the smallest element using the k-th index\n\n### Instructions:Write a program that takes a string containing any number of lowercase letters, and changes all lowercase letters to their capitalized versions following the rules of case-insensitive string comparison.\n\n### Output Format\nExample: For the \u201cHello\u201d string shown above, the capitalized version of the string should be \u201chello\u201d.\n\n### Comment:\n1. To implement this problem, we have to start by splitting the input string to create an array of substrings.\n\n### Instructor:\nIf the input string length is more than 1, we can break the string and store it in an array. Also, we can use nested loops to loop through the array and capitalize the lower case letters and return the original string with capitalized letters.\n\n### Run:\n1. In the below code there is a main method that takes the input string and split the input string into an array and then the for-each loop iterates through the array and checks for lowercase letters and the for-else block is used to change the case to uppercase.\n2. The original string is passed as a parameter and passed into the constructor.\n3. Lastly, after converting the string and the original string is returned.\n\nExpected Output:\nIn the below code, the program takes the input string and converts the lowercase to uppercase and returns the original string with capital letters.\n\nProgram:\n```\npublic class Solution {\n public String convertToTitleCase(String s) {\n  if (s == null || s.isEmpty())\n   return", "answer": "C: record store"}

We have decided to start learning about coding and our objective is to not just solve simple problems but also to become familiar with the basic concepts of coding. Since we are learning, we hope that the projects we build will give people the opportunity to use their imagination to make their own projects and we envision that we will not only learn coding concepts but also build great projects.\n\n### Listing Out Team Members\n\nName:\nIzumi\nJoyanne\nKangjy\nKristene\nManasvi\n\n### About Our Journey Starting This Competition\n\nWe were introduced to this competition during one of our classes at college. None of us had any experiences or exposure to participating in online coding competitions but after doing some research about this particular competition, we were all inspired to try joining in. Our goal at the competition is to learn as much as possible about the field of coding. In order for us to do this, we have decided to take this first competition as a stepping stone for us to learn more about coding by the help of friends or even through our own research.\n\n### Who Are Our Supporting Friends?\n\nThe one of them is our college classmate. We were given some instructions in class about this project so some of our friends also participated and they also managed to complete their project. We are very grateful of them for helping us to develop our project.\n\n### What We Have Learned About This Competition\n\nThe first thing we need to know about this competition is to find a problem or problem statement online to use for this competition. After we got the problem, we had to think of a solution for each problem. When we come up with our solution, we needed to write down the logic behind our ideas to understand our solution. In class, we were also taught about the structure of writing our solution. In this class, we were introduced to the format of writing down our logic. First, we need to", "answer": "D: city centre"}

(Be sure to round up!)\nOutput:To calculate this amount, you need to have all the amounts that the stores spend.  You need to use the following numbers to solve this problem.  Store cost = $300, store amount = $480\nThe amount of money that the first store will spend = $300 and amount of items that they will choose to buy = 7\nThere will be no sales change for the cost amount and number of items = 0, so the amount of money spent is still $300\nThe amount of sales change for cost amount and amount of items =  (3/2) x 2, so the amount of sales is 456.92\nThere will be no sale change for the cost amount by amount of items = 0, so the amount of sales that they will choose, for the first store = 456.22\nFor the second store, cost amount = $400\nAmount of money spent = 300\nAmount of items bought = 4\nThere will be a sales change for cost amount, so the amount of increase in sales is 5/4 of the 456.4 so the", "answer": "A: special"}

It means that these two variables can never be the same.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, lets call \"up\" and \"down\" the variables that hold the number of people on one side of the escaltor, and \"down2\" is the number of people on the other side.\n\nFirst, set down to the number of people on your right-hand side.  Set down2 to equal the number of people on you left-hand side.\n\nNow use the information provided in this problem to set the values of the other two variables.\n\nSo the number of people walking both up and down are both half what you originally set down to be equal to.  Now subtract the number of people walking down2 from the number of people walking up if you want an idea how many people are walking up.\n\nInput:The bank balance information for a particular bank account for November includes:\n- 285.00 is subtracted for everyday account maintenance fees\n- A flat rate of 0.10 percent is charged on all balances above 20000.00\n- A flat rate 0.20 percent is charged on every transaction\n- An additional flat rate fee is charged on all transactions equal to $1.00 for every transfer not made in person\nWhat is the total interest and fee charged for this account during November?

{"idx": 63, "text": "C\n\n#### Explanation:\n\nFor the first one, you multiply the cost of the nuts with the kilograms. Then you subtract the dried fruit's cost with the fruit and nuts' cost. The answer should be: `56`\n\nFor the second one, you take the total hour per day and then multiply it with the three weeks. The answer should be `42`.\n\nFor the third one, you multiply the new cost of soda drink by 12 and then `3600` because there are 4 units per liter so the multiplication would be `3600/3` (for each soda drink). This would amount to `460`.\n\nFor the fourth one, you compute the number of blocks in 6000 with a number `t`. Then find 250/6, this would be `41.67` so just use `42`. The question just asks about `300` blocks, so the answer is `66.\n\nFor the fifth one, the question was about `300`. First, you make the `widget` equal to `8` so the number you need would be `8*3*100` and then `300`. This would be `240000`.\n\nFor he sixth one, you just compute how much money he makes for the week. This would be `770` (the answer).\n\nFor the seventh one, for each day it gives you the change and that amount would be `4` and then you just compute it to the 4th week and this would be `16`.\n\nThe 8th question is a math equation. You first simplify it and then compute the answer.\n\nFor the 9th question, you just count it down for every day.\n\nYou would do the same for the 10th question\n\nFor the 11th one, you take the first value and then multiply it with two, then compute. The answer would be `160`.\n\nThe last question is just using your knowledge to count down the month.", "answer": "A: reach tentative agreement"}

The question focuses on the programming skill required in a programming job.\n\nYou can answer this question from a couple of perspectives. From a language perspective or from a business requirement perspective.\n\nLet us take it from the programming perspective first. I would say, there are three different ways to solve this question.\n\nFirst way: using the for loop. This is the most obvious but perhaps the most verbose way.\n\nSecond way: using a nested for loop. The nested for loop is a compact version of the original for loop, so use nested for loops whenever you can.\n\nThird way: using a nested while loop.\n\nBoth the second and third ways use a nested while loop, which is a compact version of a for loop.\n\nSo, there are the most common ways to code for this question.\n\nBut what if there is some other programming method in your toolbox?\n\nThe final way I would like to mention is recursion.\n\nRecursion is a useful programming technique to solve a lot of problems in your career. While it can be intimidating in the beginning, after some time and practice, you'll get a handle on how recursion works.\n\nFor this particular problem we don't have to worry about the last two choices. Let me give a short explanation and maybe you'll know the other programming techniques to use in your career.\n\nThe other options are to use arrays and collections. Arrays are great, but it doesn't solve in this particular problem.\n\nAnd using Collections can be a viable option, but it's also not required in the question.\n\nI hope you liked my solution above.\n\n**Q**", "answer": "A: conquer opponent"}

(A car stops because the car and the brakes have momentum, which is defined as \u201cthe property of a moving body that keeps it in motion\u201d [Merriam-Webster]). When a car is stopped, it continues to \u201chave momentum\u201d until it stops again. This momentum must be decreased by the force of brakes and by friction.\n\nA car\u2019s brakes need to generate a force of at least 1 braking force (sometimes called a brake shoe or a brake lining) or higher to effectively stop the car. So let\u2019s multiply the amount of force needed to stop a car with the amount of brakes you have and we have the answer to question number 14.\n\nOutput: 20000\n\nInputThe train's speed is proportional to positive or negative 0.10 per second, and it's heading south, so it increases at 20 units per second.\n\nThe train's speed decreases when it crosses over into another coordinate system.  \n\nThe train' coordinate system is the Cartesian coordinate system.\n\nThe train leaves New York in a straight line and only crosses coordinate systems on the way to Miami, so the train only travels north-south.\n\nThe amount of \"decreasing\" depends on whether the coordinate system is the xy coordinate system.\nThe x coordinate represents horizontal direction. The z coordinate represents vertical direction.\n\nThe xz coordinate system's x axis is the positive x axis and its z axis is the negative z axis, so it looks something like this:\nxy+yz+xz+y-z=1\n\nThe amount of decreasing depends on the amount by which the train crosses into the xz coordinate system, as well as how the train crosses, and where it leaves the xz coordinate system.\n\nIf the train moves at a constant rate between coordinate systems, the speed decreases at a constant rate between the crossing.\nAlso, every positive crossing into the xz coordinate systems results in the same amount by which \n\nThe train' speed decreases in the xz coordinate systems so the magnitude is 0.", "answer": "A: arena"}

If they split their bills equally, how much change would each of them get?  Choices:  Answer:  C -  $1.82  D -1.82  Answer:  Answer:  Answer A is incorrect because adding the values of each person does not equal the sum of the three bills.  The sum of the two remaining digits (127) is 1, so Alice's change is 1.82.  However, each person would need to have two dollars of change for this to be true.  Each person would be left with one dollar of change, which is 0.33 of original bill, so this answer is incorrect.  Alice's change should be 0.33 and her bill should be 11. Answer:  E - 1.83  Answer:  Answer D is incorrect because it is equivalent to an incorrect answer, which is 128. Bob's change should be equal to Alice's change and both should be 1.82 but Bob's bill does", "answer": "B: going to jail"}

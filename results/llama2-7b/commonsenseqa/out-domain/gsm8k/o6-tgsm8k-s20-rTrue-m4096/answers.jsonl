This kind of questions are just to get you warmed up. The second section has only addition and subtraction and thus simple to understand and solve. \nThe third section uses more than addition and subtraction. It uses multiplication also, but it is simple to remember what number should be for each given situation. \nThe next three sections have both division and multiplication in them. You can see that there are four sections which have only three questions in each. This helps the reader to understand each pattern after reading the same kind of questions numerous times. \nThe fifth section is interesting. There is no division for some questions, and then division is used for two questions. It takes more thinking for this section because there is no consistency in division and therefore the reader has to memorize the division patterns. \nThe eighth section uses multiplication to solve. This is the only section which uses multiplication to solve. Therefore the reader could practice and learn what multiplication should be for each situation.", "answer": "D: street"}

The amount they can still give is 20*(6-2)+1+27= <<20*6-2+1+27=21>>\n21*(6-2)= <<21*(6-3)=16>>\nThen there are 16 extra students that can donate their food, since 6-2= <<6-2=4>>\nSo the total donation would be <<16+4>>\nSo the final answer would be 16+4\n\nInput: A pencil store sells 5 colors of pencils.

We can get 20 since multiplying by (+) is just adding the values of each operation which we already have in the right of the equation so 20 = 8*5 since we found 8+5. Then if we subtract 3*4 from 20 we get 21.\nNow let's see if we can go through the other two operations at the same time. \nIf we multiply 8*2, we get 16 and then we add it to 5 to get 21 since multiplying by (+-*) isn't changing the value we have multiplied by since it's just adding or subtracting the values. Then if we divide 21 by 4, we get 5, so by using parenthesis of division is first, we get 21/(+-*)5 since we are dividing something by something. \nNow if we don't use parenthesis or brackets and we are just multiplying 2 by something then we get the original values when we get 2*(6)(4)+20+2/(2)=6+2+2=(2)(4)+20= 4(9)+20=92+20=112. \nBy just using order of operations and parenthesis we can end up with 21.\n\n### Input:\n\nYou are at the North Pole.

The father is the only driver in the family and drives 5 hours in a day. The family stops at the grandfather\u2019s house halfway through and spends two nights there. How many miles did they drive per day on the trip?\nOutput: If the father drives 5 hours per day, the family drives 5 hours*2 = <<5*2=10>>1 days.\nIf the family arrives halfway through and stays for two nights, they spend <<1*2>>2 nights and travel 10 days*2 = <<10*2=20>>2 days at the grandfather\u2019 s house. \nDividing the total distance traveled by the days in a week (7), we get 20/7 = <<20/7=2>>2.858 days.\nDividing the father\u2019s driving time of 5 hours by the amount of days taken by the family to get to the grandfather\u2019s, we get 5/2.858 = <<5/2.8=1.7>>1.783 miles per day.\nSo the final answers are 1.783 and 2.858", "answer": "B: fire"}

{"idx": 290, "text": "CORRECT ANSWER: D) REST\nChoice A may seem obvious: 'health.' However, 'health' is a broad term which can encompass many activities, and exercise alone cannot guarantee good health. Thus, exercise may be more beneficial than 'health' as a term because people can exercise without necessarily having to eat (or abstain from eating) healthy.\nChoice B may also seem obvious: 'heart attacks.' However, this choice only emphasizes the dangers of exercise. It does not recognize exercise as a positive choice.\nChoice C may also seem obvious: \"relaxation.\" Many people believe exercise provides a'relief' from stress. However, this choice emphasizes the idea of exercise being exclusively beneficial to relaxation.\nChoice E may also seem obvious: fatigue. However, fatigue is generally a negative occurrence, and is therefore a weak choice to make. Additionally, one can engage in exercise and remain fatigued.\nChoice B is definitely incorrect because 'heart attacks' does not relate to exercise in any way.\nChoice C is incorrect because \"relaxation\" doesn't necessarily have to mean rest.\nChoice E is incorrect because \"fatigue\" is not specific enough. Being fatigued could happen at any point from exercise to non-exercise activities.\nAnswer choice D is correct because it states \"rest\" as a positive benefit to exercise. \"Rest\" refers to the end result of exercising, and the end result is always positive.", "answer": "A: good health"}

If the mom and dad's ages together is 70, what is their age? How Do you do it?\nFirst we know the mom and dad are 70.\nWe also know that the mom and dad is twice as old as the boy.\nAfter 6 years we can say that he is half as old as his dad, as his dad gets older by a year every six years.\nFirst take 70, the son's age, and subtract from it his mom's age, 35. (70 - 35)\nNow, add 1/4, the age that the boy is, or 1/4 of 12, or 12/4\nIf you do not want to do that, you can just subtract half of the boy's age. Half his age is 1/2, or 1/2 of 12, which is 6.

B: Ordering them from the government supplier C: Deciding how big to make the signs D: Attaching the signs to each road. E: Deciding where to put stop signs.\nOutput: Adding stop signs to the roads involves deciding where to put them and deciding how to connect them to the roads. The city government will also have to provide large number of stop signs; it could be difficult for the city government to provide all the signs at once, especially if the city government would have to place an order to the government's supplier.\nDeciding where to put the stop signs would be the most difficult because there are multiple options. The city government would have to consider the type of roads and the speed limit. Each road would require at least one stop sign; hence, the city government would need to add one at least at the beginning of the road that it intends to stop at and put at least one at every intersection that it intends to include on that road. In addition, the city government would have trouble deciding which roads to include and which roads not to include. This would be difficult for the city officials, who would be busy trying to find a solution. Lastly, the city government would not know which direction the traffic would be coming from.\nSo the final decision is the most difficult part of adding new stop signs.\n\nInput: How much will the cost of one-thousandth of a", "answer": "A: open meadow"}

To do this, you will need to use the dictionary constructor. When you create a dictionary using the name variable, this dictionary needs to store keys and values that correspond to that name. For example, consider adding a dictionary like the following to your dictionary dictionary_d20_list.\n\ndictionary_d20_dic = { \"name\": \"20 Sided Dice\" }\n\nNow, when you look at this dictionary using the dic_d20_dict.display method, it returns the entry \"name\": \"21\". If you change the dictionary name to \"d5\" like this:\n\ndictionary_d5_dic = { \"dice\": \"D5 Dice\" }\ndic_d5_dict.display(dictionary_d5_dict)\n\nYou'll see the name in the display is now \"dice\": \"d5 Dice\". This suggests you can use a dictionary constructor to create a dictionary that stores information. Remember, this is the method used to create a dictionary. This is the first example of how you will find out if a particular dictionary you're trying. is actually accessible in a dictionary.

A \"men's room\", otherwise known a \"bathroom\" is the place where the gentleman is most likely to live.\nThe answer is choice D, as a bathroom. The question is asked in the context of the gentleman.\nThe question is not stated correctly, as \"men's room\" is a questionable term these days. If asked about a \"men's restroom,\" the answer will be different, because a men's restroom might be a toilet room, not a room in a big house. The question only reads men's room with no context, and therefore the answer is men's room in the context provided.\nSo the final awnser is D:men's room\n\nInput: The answer here will not be clear at the start of the question. Think about what the question says and try to form an opinion before you start answering any of the questions. Then if you are unsure about the answer, you should come to the TA.\n\nAnswer:\nYou are at a grocery store and you notice a $5/lb sign on spinach. You think to yourself that spinach was expensive in the past, so you are hesitant to purchase spinach. You decide to see what you would buy if the spinach cost $4/lb. You buy 10 pounds of spinach, and 4/lb and multiply it by 10 to determine the cost of your spinach is $40. \nIf the spinach cost $5/lb, you would buy 20 pounds of spinach. You see that you spend less money when the price of spinach is $5/lb, so why are you buying more? You should buy more spinach, even without knowing the price, because it is a \"more\" sign. For example, if the price of spinach changed to $7/lb, you would still buy 20 pounds even without knowing. Therefore, if it is cheaper, you will always buy more.\nIf the spinach was marked $4/lb instead of $5/lb, that could also signify a \"less\" sign. If it is cheaper, that means it is less. For instance, if the spinach markings were $5", "answer": "B: big house"}

For example, the number 2 is even because 2/2 = 1. Also, the number 8 is even because 8/2 = 4. A number is odd if it is not even. For example, the numbers 4, 9, and 10 are all odd because they cannot be divided evenly by two, and are different from other even numbers. The numbers 1,3,5, 6, 7, and 9 are all even. Is the number 9 even or odd?\nOutput:9 is divisible by all numbers between 2 and 8, it is even. In this instance, (9/9/2/2/3/3/.../8/8) is zero, and (9/8/7/6/5.../2/2) is 1.

{"idx": 478, "text": "A and E\nExplanation: We solve first by plugging the answer choices and their number of letters into the alphabet. From the choices that correspond, we can then figure out what the answer is.\nAnswer choice A and B have the fewest letters of the choices provided, with 3 letters. So, the answer would start with an A, and end with an E.\nNext, we try option C. This option has four letters, which means our new answer will contain at least four letters, meaning that the letter after C must be another R.\nThe letter after A has to be either E, Z, or Y, since only those three options have fewer than four letters. Of those three options, only E fits into our previously determined rule, meaning that the answer is either AE or EZ or EY.\nFinally, we try option D. Since this answer has the most letters of the choices, it can\u2019t be the answer.\nSimilarly, we discard option E, as it also has four letters.\nTherefore, the answer is AE.\n\nInput: What goes: 'M, B, Q, F, A, T, D, B, H, I, S, E'?\nOutput: M, B, Q, B, H, S\nExplanation:\nThe string of letters begins and ends with the letter, B, and the letters in the middle are all vowels. (The letters B, H, and S are vowels, and the other letters contain vowels.)\nSince the string begins and ends with a B, the answer must contain at most two Bs.\nThe rest of the string contains three other vowels, which means that the letter right after the second B must also be a vowel.\nWe don't know which letter is in the middle of our current string, but we know that it must be a vowel which means that the letter after the second B must be a consonant, and the letters after the second B must alternate between consonants and vowels.\nSo the answer must be: M B Q F A T D B H I S E\n\nInput: You are standing next to your friend.

Both trains and buses cost $75. Nicole's cost for the plane was $75*.5 and she spent $6.25 (half the cost of the wrong ticket for the bus), so by how much was the price of the wrong ticket higher? $150-6.25= $<<150-6=144>>144.\n\nInput: There were n items in a store, where n is a number.

What was the goal difference between each team?\nOutput: Explanation: The initial teams equalized 2-2 and scored more goals than their opponents. The 3rd team scored more goals than the 2nd team but lost to them 2-3, resulting in a loss of two goals for each team. The 3rd won 3-2, while the 2nd lost 2-3, both resulting in wins of one goal and losses of one goal. Since the 2nd team won by 1-0, they scored 3 goals more than the 1st team. Therefore, the Goal Difference is -2 for 1st, -1 for 2nd, and (+1) for 3rd team.\nSo the final Answer is +1\n\n### Instructions: Answer the question that follows by choosing the one correct response.\nYou will have a total of 5 attempts to get this question correct.\nInput: Jack and Jill have 500 candies each.

But he bought them at 1.2 and he sold at 1.8\nWe can find out how he lost money using this formula: 2.7385-1.2/1.8 = -0.1245/1.8 = 0.37\nSince -0.37 = 0 37/1.2 = 467.5 so he lost 471.5 dollars. He made 471.37 which is 2.2514 times the profit on a unit.\nBut because he bought them at 2.25 and sold them at 0.2 his profit for that was 2.00 and not 4.10\nTherefore The final answer is 471.25.\n\nInput: I have 30 minutes to finish my English homework.

What was the horse's speed relative to the wind? Choices: A: 4 mph faster than the wind B: 6 mph slower than the wind C: 20 mph slower than the WI D: 22 mph faster than the WI E: none of these\nOutput: The horse has a relative speed of either 4 mph faster or 6 mph slower relative to the wind. It is 20 mph SLOWER than the wind if the relative speed is negative. It is 22 mph FASTER than the wind if relative speed is positive. If it is 20 mphp faster than the wind, then his speed was less than 50 mph or less than 20 mph above his staggering speed or greater or equal to 22 mph above the speed. So C and E are wrong.

C. You are very likely to get money back. D: You might get money back.\nThis means that insuring the total value more than MIL is void, and they will not insure this. For insurance, they need to be covered in case of total loss. In short, you get totally covered if everything goes well or you don't, but you won't get paid after the accident.

Therefore, D is not the answer.\n\nIf the sun was shining and the temperature was increasing, therefor the answer would be E. However, the sun is not shining, and the temperature is dropping, in fact, it is dropping quickly. Therefore E is not the answer.

We use the inequality, x + xx +3 > 1, since the number of sales increased in each respective month. Because the inequality must be equal for the statements to be true, we know that x+1 +xx+3>1. We solve for x using x = (((((((((((((x+1 +((xx+3)/3)+x)/3)+(xx +3)/3)+x)*1/2))))))//1/2))/2 = <<4>>4/2 as the total average.

If both pets traveled for an hour, how many miles would each animal walk in that hour?\nOutput: Since a dog is walking 5 miles per hour, then 5/60 = one mile per 12 minutes.\nBecause a rabbit is walking 4 times faster, this is 4*(5/60)= 20/60= 2 3/5 miles per hour.\nUsing the multiplication principle, we can say that the rabbit goes at 2 miles per hour for 2 minutes. Then we multiple this by 15 for each mile and then multiple this times 60 for 1 hour.\nSo the final result that you get is rabbit miles per hour * hour miles per hour * 12 minutes = miles.\nSince we got miles in our answer, this means the rabbit traveled 4 times further than the dog that hour.\n\nInput: Mr. Rodrigo has a group of students in different classes.

When we sleep, it is possible to have different states of consciousness. We may sleep in an REM (rapid eye movement) state, where we are largely unconscious and may have dreams. This is most often connected to deep stage 3 and 4 sleep. Stage 1 can also be thought of as a light phase of sleep, when we are somewhat conscious, but easily disturbed by noise. Stage 2 is similar to stage 1, but we are less conscious. We can also dream or be conscious in non-REM phases. If we are thinking of getting up, this is an intermediate phase, which may cause us not want to wake up in the morning (which is very likely).

When you have a positive behavior intervention plan (PBIS) in place, you can begin by creating a point system.\nThe next step is to set how many points a student will get, how many points will be required to get a reward, and what the rewards will be. After your students have the plan in place, you\u2019ll be able to begin a reward system and praise. Keep a record of positive behavior by logging student behaviors in your classroom for the day.\nNext, you\u2019ll want to reward your students for their good behavior. Start off by rewarding students that have their behavior chart full.\nWhen you create a classroom behavior plan, you\u2019ll want students to have the plan that is right for them.

{"idx": 721, "text": "The correct answer is C -- \"butterflies\".\nThe correct answer is a noun that follows the question word \"what\". The question word \u201cwhat\u201d may or may not be used in questions that follow a \"w\" pattern. For example:  \"what color is it?\" or \"I don't know what color it is.\" Both of these sentences do not require the question word \"what,\" as they can be rephrased into \"What color is it?\" or I don't know what (color) it is, where the \"what\" is left out. However, an example of a question that does require a \"what\" would be \"What color is your car?\"\nA noun is a person, place, or thing, and it is needed to answer the question. Thus, we can answer the question, \"What are the bees?\" by saying, \"The bees are insects.\" However, the question, \"What pollination? You are crazy,\" would not make sense, as it is missing a noun.\nNext, we take a closer look at the noun in question -- butterflies. As a noun that follows \"what,\" butterflies must be a group of things that are loved by millions of people. However, the question does not specify the exact group of things that should be understood as \"butterflies.\" In fact, it could be a group of things in the form of many different creatures. Therefore, the exact group of things should be understood, while the noun form should not be understood.\nNext, we move onto another noun in the sentence, \"pollination.\" Pollination is defined as the process by which a plant produces pollen, which plays an important role in plant reproduction. Therefore, pollination must be understood as a process or activity that plays an important role in \"what.\"\nNext, we take an in-depth look at the words, \"loved my millions.\" The word \"millions\" is an interesting thing to note, as it is much more vague than other similar words, like thousand, billion, and trillion. Thus, what is meant by \"millions of people\" is, in fact, up to the reader and needs to be understood.\n\nFinally, we take a look at four different possibilities of \"what.\" The possibilities include \"birds,\" \"action,\" \"happiness,\" and \"", "answer": "C: butterflies"}

So that means my solution is 12.\n\nLet\u2019s solve my first number equation.\n\n8*9 \u2013 (8 * 2) = 72\n\n72 minus 15 = 57.\n\nWhat number goes into 57?\n\n57 / 8 = 7\n\nIf a 7 comes from 57 minus 15 (57 \u2013 15 = 7), then a six comes from 8.\n\n8/6 = 6/3\n\n3/2 = 1.5\n\nWhich means our number is 7. Therefore, the order of numbers is 2, 1.5, and 7.\n\nI hope that cleared everything up. Otherwise, it\u2019s okay!

There are 288 hours in a solar calendar. There are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute. There are 3600 seconds in a solar calendar. How many seconds are there in a solar day?\nOutput: We can solve the problem recursively: We set x28, the number of seconds in a solar day equal to x27+ 288 -60 (There are 288x27 minutes in a solar day.) Then solve x27 for a day. We get the recurrence relation: x27 + 60 \u2013 288 = 0 Now it\u2019s easy to solve this equation using the method of completing the square. We get x27 = 180 Thus the number of seconds in one solar day is 180\nSo the final answer if 180\n\nInput: What did you do on your vacation? How much money did you spend?

This step is called input. Once the computer has received some input, that information is processed.\n\nIn order to understand what will happen in your computer programs, it's helpful to understand how the computer stores the input, what happens when the program is run, and what happens to the input after the program has completed.\n\nThe first thing that the computer does when a program starts is to wait for some input. This can be information from a keyboard, mouse, camera, or other input device. You can get input through what are called _standard input_ and _standard output_ devices.\n\nFor example, in the Python coding session you just viewed on your computer, you clicked the Run Button. This sent your Python program to the Python interpreter, the part of the code that executes the program. \n\nIn order to start the program, Python needed input. In this example, the input came from the text you typed into your program's first line.\n\nAnother way that a program gets input is through variables. Variables are used to store information that the program will use in calculations or for further processing. So, variables can act as storage devices, just as a pen or a pencil can be used to collect information. \n\nWhen a program runs, it does several things at the same time. One thing happens at the \"front end\" of the program. The front end is the entry-point or first part of your program code.\n\nThe front end is where information from standard input devices is stored. Once information is in the front end, the Python interpreter begins to work on that information. It takes the input, such as a number or a character, and does calculations to make the program do something useful.\n\nThe part of the code that interprets user input is called the _command-line interface_. This means that before Python is run, you must enter information into the program. This information has to be in", "answer": "B: appear beautiful"}

What was the quantity of the first pizza I made?\nOutput: If I used a 9 inch square pan, I made a pizza with dimensions of 9x9= <<9*9=81>>81.\nThe total number of people there would be 10, so 81 would be the total pizza I made.\nHowever, 18 of the 10 were able to finish their full pizza, and 6 had one left over. So 6 were able to take one home. \nThe amount of pizzas left was 6/2 pizzas, or 3/4 of a pizza, and the answer I'm looking for is 3/4 of my 81 pizza, which is 3/4*81=<<3/4*8=64>>64\nSo the final answer should be 64\n\nInput: In a 50 gallon barrel, 50 gallons of water was added to 10 gallons of oil.

How far away is the 40-foot tree?\n\nOutput: Let L = ladder and T = tree. From the equation LS = T, we get: L*20+L = T, or 80ft + L = T. The equation for L being the minimum distance that will reach a 20 foot tree is L/20 + 20. However, L is 20-foot, so L/20 is 20/20 or 1. Therefore, L+L/20 = T. That is, L + 10ft = T.\n\nWhen L is 20 ft, then T = 80ft, L =10ft, and D = L+L/2 +D = 20+10+D or D = 20+(10+10). But since L=10, then 20+(11+10)= D, or D=3.\nWe cannot tell if the tree is 20, 30, or 40 feet.

When Ryan drives, he drives 36 miles per hour. What is their average speed when they drive together?\nOutput: Jolana can drive at 22 mph.\nRyan can drive at 36 mph. Jolana covers 72 miles at a time.\nRyan covers 126 miles at a time. Jolana and Ryan's car can travel 300 miles in a day.\nSolution: First, if they drive at 72 mph together, then they cover a distance of 72*300 = <<72*30=2160>>2160 miles a day.\nIf they drive at 22 and 36, respectively, then if each travels for x minutes, and they travel for 10x together, then they cover the same distance: 22(10x) + 36(10x) = 2160, so they drive together for x= <<1000/(22+36)=33>>33 minutes a day.\nIf, during this time, each drives x miles, then each goes 33*36 + 33*22 = <<309+61=91>>91 miles a day.\nSo, Jolana and Ryan drive for 33 minutes, and each travels 91 miles.\nFor each mile, they use 268 ml of fuel. They have 810 gallons of fuel on a tank. Each time they refuel, they pay $120 for 9 gallons.\nThen in a day, Jolana drives for 91*33*268 = <<91*33268=233>>233 gallons.\nThey pay $120*233 = <<120*268=31120>>31120 for each fill-up.\nIf they refuel", "answer": "D: pond"}

The opening match of the World Cup will feature Australia versus France. If the opening match of the World cup is played in Western Australia (as is most likely), how many French players could miss the match of the event?\nOutput:(This question requires use of the equation \"2n + 1\" - n being the number of teams in a tournament. For example 32 teams can not play in the World Cup because the World Cup only allows 32 national teams to compete, so all the teams in it would make it to the world cup, hence not requiring the equation to be used).\nThe World cup has 32 teams competing. They include: 11 European teams, 4 South American teams, 4 North American teams, 6 Asian teams, and 7 African teams. If each team have 22 players, 22 x 32 = 712. 32-1 = 31.\nIn this case, 11 European countries have more than 31 players on their roster. Only the other 21 teams have fewer than 31 players, including Australia, and France. To answer the question we need to know how many French players will be on the plane from France to Australia. If you use all 22 players, there would be a total of 240 players on the plane.

He makes the right turn and goes until he sees the light he wants to make on his left. The traffic is bad at that time, so he waits there for 4 minutes and then makes the left turn. He wants to get to work soon, so he decides to speed up, but now he has to stop at a stop sign. He then takes the next right and goes to work. On the way to work he passes many stop signs, but they are all set to an interval of 60 seconds. He can always take a left, and he wants to be at his destination in 15 minutes. Draw a truth table to model the problem.\nOutput: No, because you can't be sure that the person will take right turning at a light at 6:40, or 7:00:\nIf there is a light you turn right, and if there is no light you go straight.\nIf you don't turn right you arrive at 7:05 but if you do you reach at 7:01, so if there was a light and you turn right there is small probability you will arrive at your destination early\nbut that means there is big probability you will be late.\nSo the final probability that you will reach on time is the probability that there is no light AND you turn right.\nSo, on a one of the three possibility you are not on time.\n\nInput: A man went to the airport with one bag of candy each weighing 8 lbs and one bag of bread each weighing 4 lbs.

By considering the above formula, it can be calculated as (25+1)*10000/2.\nThe formula becomes 2500*10/2 =<<2500*4>>200,00,00\nWe just multiply 200 with 2 which is 20 which will be the population in 2019.\nNow as you know the growth is 27 million, we will see the growth in 2020 as 2500 + 10% = <<2500>>2700\nAbove formula will be as 250*(10002700/4) which is almost 4277 times population increase in 2021 in comparison to the 2018\u2019s population.\n\nThe formula below is actually for future 14 years.\nSo the solution is 281000035714 * 14/4 =<482500047100>>4277,000, or 282 times population of 2018 in 2028\n\nInput: 106 is an even number divisible by 2, 4 and 16.

The game proceeds as follows: The player has the choice to either move the piece on his own turn (without rolling the cube) or to choose a single color from the cube and give the cube one roll.  A 1 always cancels a movement, but the cube then lands on a randomly selected number. If the game has ended at this point, how many different ways was the game played (ignoring the actual moves) by the player himself?\nOutput: No matter how the player chooses to move, after rolling the dice if he rolls a 1 he gives his turn back to the other player and the game continues from that point.\n\nThis means that if he chooses to take the die and make a move he has 6 different options, but if he takes the die and passes it back to the other player (who then determines the next move, which is also part of moving the piece) he can pass it back on all 6 options.\n\nSo the number of different ways to move the die is 6+6 = <<6+6=12>> 12\n\nInput: The city of Chicago is divided in to 3 distinct regions.

{"idx": 46, "text": "The sunshine was warm enough to make a disney street hot. So he could have been on the street.\nThis question has two correct answers, A and E.\nThe street was indeed hot because it was a summer day.\nThe sun on a hot day causes the sidewalk to heat up. The reason this happens is because heat energy from the sun moves from the surface of the sun to the surface of the earth.\nThe sidewalk absorbs most of the radiation from the sun, so it gets hot quickly.\nSome surfaces, like metal, conduct heat well, so it starts to heat up quickly.\nOther surfaces, like concrete, don't absorb it very well. The heat of the day keeps the sidewalk hot.\nBecause of this, the sidewalk can burn anyone's feet who walks barefoot on it.\nSo the final answers were A and E\n\nInput:Which of these words is in alphabetical order?

For each pair, the difference between the paired items is 2 dollars. So the difference between each pair would be $2.\nEach pair was going to cost $###%$###. So all together the difference is $(3*2 = <<3*2=6>>6)+(2*2 =<<2*2=4>>2)+(4*2=<<4*2=8>>8), the total is\n\n6+4+8 = <<6+4+8=18>>18 dollars.\n\nThe largest price, with this formula, would be ###%##, as you would save ##%## off the price with two items (with ##+5%## or ##+50%##%##%).\n\nSo the overall price is ###%##, but with 27(##%##/1+##%##)+18(##%##/2+##+##)##, the price is 36.841. So the full price is $$###%$###,", "answer": "A: desire"}

When the runners and cyclists start the race, the cyclists are each 2 minutes ahead of the race. What is the final position of the runners?\nOutput: The final position of the runers is 8.\nThe cycling time is 4 time slower than running time, so that is 1:5. Since this is 5 minutes bigger than the 2 minute headstart each cyclist had, the runners are 7 minutes behind the cyclists.\nEach runner is 70% faster than each cyclist, which would mean that a runner would come 7/8 as close to the cyclist as the cyclist to the runner (the distance remaining to run would be 80% of that to the cyclist to the cyclist).\nWhen you take out the two minutes given for the headstart, the runners will be 5\nminutes behind the cyclists, who will be 1 minute each ahead with the 8 minutes separating the cyclists in time of each the runners.\nThis would give the runners a total of 8 minutes of headstart.  So if the runners could run at 125 % of the cycling speed, they would still finish the race 8 minutes behind. Then:\nEach runner would be 7/8 as fast as the cyclist, so the time it will take a runner to come up to the cyclists is 1/8.

What is the ratio of female to male students at this university?\nOutput: Let's consider the male students first.\nSo for every 2 male students there are 10 female students.\nSo we can say that the ratio of 1 : 5 is equal to 2 : 10.\nThe total number of female students is 5 females per male, which is represented by an equal sign with the same thing in the male population of 10 females per male.\nThis is equal to 2 females per male, 2 being the original total number of female students and 5 the male students.\nSo this leaves us with the ratio 1 : 5 = <<1:5=2:10>>2:10.\nAnd by multiplying both sides by 2 we found that 1 : 5 equals 2 : 20.\nThe total female students enrolled will be 20 females.\nNow for the male students.\nWe know there are 20 females enrolled, so if for every 2 males 10 females are enrolled, there has to be 10 males at a time for each females.\nThis is equivalent to saying there are 10 males enrolled.\nCombining this with the female part of the ratio, 2 : 1 = <<2:1=5:10>>5:10.\nThis leaves us with the ratio of 10 : 10 which is represented by <<10:10=1:1>>1:1, for a full 1:1 ratio of male to female at the university.\nIn total, 20 females and 10 males make up the total student population.\nSo the final number of students is 20+10 = <<20+10=30>>3.0 students.\nSo the final answers is 30.\n\nInput: The store sold 2/3 of the new gaming computer.

Filling a larger car takes twice as long. How long does it take to fill a car four times the size of the car above?\nOutput: First, we will need to know how long it takes to fill the first car. We know that 1/x = 5/10. We can then substitute x=10 to get 10=5/x. When that simplifies, it equals 10/x. 10/x is the same as 0.1, which is the same as 1/10. This means to fill just the first car will take 1/10 of an hour, which equals 1/60 of a whole hour.

What is the average speed of the train over the whole journey?\nOutput: The rate at which the speed of the train is changing at any given time is \n5*(the number of miles remaining, in this case: the number of miles remaining is equal to 130-60= 70, and the speed is changing by 5, times that we need to subtract (70-60)\n= 5(70-60)= 20\n\nFrom the time at which the train starts until the time at which the speed is changing at 5/hour\nSo the speed is: 100\nThe time at which the speed at which the train is moving at 100/60 = 0.5/hour = 5/hour in the 60 miles\nSo in total the speed after that time is constant times times 70-60 = 20\n\nThe total amount of time it takes till the end, in this case 130-70=60\nWhich means that the speed decreases by 5/60=5%/60=5/60=100/6 = 16.6.\nSo the result must be: The average speed is 100+16.6=<<116.6>>116.6\nWhich is equal to: 116.6.

How many different ways can this be done if there are at least two people in each group?\nOutput: First of all, let me point out an issue with how you're using the modulo operator in your question - modulo does not make multiple groups of unequal size - modulo divides by the size of the group. Therefore, the correct formula is 127%70 = <<127%7=46>>46 people in the first group.\nThis means the amount of people that can be in the second group is 127/46 = <<127/4=2.9>>2.9 people\nNow, we assume that in each group there are 70% of people, so let's say that we need to figure out how many methods there are to distribute 70% of 127 (~ 88.9) people into groups of 2.9 people\nSince 88.9%2.9 = <<62*2.9=179>>179, there are 180 total methods to divide 70% of a group of 128 people into groups of 50+ people\nSo there are 181 total methods to distribute 127 people into groups of 70%; 181/2.9 = <<181/2=62>>62 methods.\n\n\n\nInput: Let's say we have a group of 10 people that we need to split evenly between three tables.

The house is 50 miles from the gas station and back again.  If the car leaves the house at 10:00, at what time does it arrive at the gas station?\nOutput: if the car leaves the house on 10:01, its arrival time is 10:31\nIf the car leaves the house, and its arrival time is 2*(10:01), so the arrival time is 2(10:01)\nAnd the distance between the house and the gas station is 50 miles = <<5/6*50=8.333>>8.333 miles.\nSo to get the arrival time to the gas station, when the car leaves the house in the morning, it leaves every six minutes and six seconds, as the duration of one minute is six minutes\nand the duration of one hour is 60 minutes, so the distance is 8.333/60 = <<8.333*60/60=83.33>>83.33 miles\nSo if the car leaves every 2 hours, the arrival time is the arrival time + 2/(2*83.33) = <<2/46.6>>13.28 hours after it leaves the house.\nTherefore, at 10:32, the arrival time is 66.6/(2*83:33) = <<66.6/2*83:20=27.81>>27.81 minutes after it leaves the house, that is, 10:03.19\nSo the initial arrival time is 11:00.49\nSo the final answer  is 11:10:49\n\nInput: Sam wants to do a workout.

After that, you spend 30 minutes going to work, and workout for 2 hours in the afternoon. The next day, from after breakfast to dinner you spend 1 hour a day cooking and eating. Then for one hour you do dishes. So you end up having spent a total of how many hours for that week? Explanation:\nIf you spend 1-hour doing exercise and eating cereal while it is dark/night, you will spend 1 * 7 = <<7*1=7>>7 hours for that week.\nIf you spend 30-minutes for 5-days/nights and work-out for 2-hours for 5-days a week, you will spend 30 + 90 + 90 = <<30+90+90=210>>210 minutes on working out.\nIf you spend one hour a day cooking + your meal, you will spend 5 days x 7 = <<75*5=137.5>>137.5 hours/days for that week.\nAnd if you spend two days per week cleaning dishes for one hour, you will spend 2*7 = <<7*2=14>>14 hours for that week. So in total, you will spend 7.1+210+137.5-14 = <<174.5>> 174.5 hours during your week.\nSo the final week is 7.1 + 210 + 137.5 - 14 = <<7.1+201>>201 hours\nSo the final answer for your week should be 201 hours.\n\nInput:", "answer": "D: time consuming"}

This property cannot be repeated for more than one color.\n\nSuppose that there n different colors.\nWhen you are choosing 1 item, you can get 1 different combination from the n possible colors.\nThat means that when choosing 1 item, there are n+1 combnations of colors to choose from.\nSince you can choose 2 different items, there are n(n+1)/2 choices of color to choose from.\nWhen choosing 3 different items, there are [n][n-1][n-2]/3 choices of colors to choose from, and so on.

This indicates that R(x) cannot be roughly proportional to the square at all. The slope, a, is negative, indicating that R(x) is decreasing. As x grows, R(x) falls faster than linearly.

Suppose he studied question 7, and he got x. This means that if he studied 7 questions, then he got exactly 90%. So the number of questions he didn't study and still obtained at least 90% is at most 1. If he had studied question 7, he would have gotten exactly 90%.\nSince he studied 6 questions at least, the number of questions he studied is at least 6, and the number of questions he got at least 90%, this at least is 6. He can't get 90% in every question that he studied.

You have to calculate the volume in cubic centimetres so you can do the following: Length, diagonal, square-rectangular\nOutput: Suppose we want to cut a cube. The volume of the cube is 6, then the length is half of the diameter (d) and the height is twice the diameter because we need a square surface (h = 2d). So the equation would be: V = (length)/2 * (height) * (d)\nSo V = (<.5d>/2) * (2d) * (d) = (<.5*d>/2) * d * (<.5*2*d>/2) = <<<(<.5*d>*d)/2>> = <<<0.5*0.5*d>> = d/2\nThen, if the height of the cube is half of the diameter\nV = (<h>/2) * (<h>/2); h =<<<d>> = d 0.5 = <0.5>\nSo V = <d>/2 * <d>/2 = d^2/4 or d-to-square = V = <d^2/4>.\n(In that sense if x = y ^ 2, then x = y^2, which can be stated with \"y = x^y\".\nSo V = h *d *d = d.diagonal = h\n\nInput: This is a question to solve the distance between points.

This is a biological and physiological event and he had the physical result of erection.\nB\n\nInput:  To make coffee one needs to heat water to 200 degrees Fahrenheit. To take the temperature one would need a thermometer whose minimum temperature of resolution is 1 degree, hence one must heat the water 200 times (200 divided by 1) to take its temperature. The minimum resolution needed for the water is one degree. To take the coffee to a state of completion one must heat the water some more as its temperature is too low. How many degrees does one need to heat the water additionally?\nOutput: A common and easy mistake that people make on this problem is to say that it is easy to find the temperature with a difference of one degree, but it's not. One must be able to find the temperature with very low incremental resolution. In the case one wants to go up. One must have the ability to go down by such a low increment. You can see it as dividing into small pieces and then putting the pieces together one at a time, so one must be able to find temperature precisely.", "answer": "E: erections"}

Then it checks where the user places his choice by comparing the user's input with the other possible choices and decides to print either one of them.\nThis can be done by checking each choice and comparing each one to the input using a conditional statement. The if and else statements inside the if can check the choices. Another way of doing this is by comparing each item with the user input and the one that matches to be printed on the screen. This way we avoid using if and else statements for every choice.\nInstead, we can use different if statements and have a else statement and the else statement can be an if statement else print the choice that does not match in the else statement.\nIn this code, I use different approaches of using the if and else statements.\n<h1>Choose Choice</h1>\n\n<pre><code>\n<h1>/usr/bin/python3</h1>\n<p>This program checks for the number.</p>\n\n<p>It uses two if, and else statements in checking the number.</p>\u200b\n\n<p>The first input statement uses two conditional statements of equals and\nnot equals, to check for the choices A, B, and C.</p>\n\n</code><br/>\n\n<div>\n<pre>\"\n<p>Choice 1=\" & print (\"[1] Putin\") & \"<br>\nChoice 2=\" & print (\"[2]", "answer": "A: food"}

You can hike up to 2400 vertical feet.  If hike one is shorter than hike three, how many vertical feet do you climb per day?\nOutput: Hike one is 2400 feet. Hike two is 1800 feet and so it took 60% = <<2400*60%=1440>>1440 of the distance to hike as much as hike one.  The distance to hike on hike three is <hike one> + <hike one + 60% of hike one> = <<3600>>3600.  Because you hike half the distance, the 3600 is reduced by half to be 1800.  So, when you add up these two distances, you can hike 1800 + 1440 = <<1440+1440=2880>>2880 feet each day.

What is the chance for the episode not to end, under the condition that the banner will stay on?\nOutput: If the TV program is longer than the time of the ad banner, there is a positive chance for it not to end.\nIf the TV program is equal to the time of the ad or shorter the ad may be interrupted and will therefore not stay until the end.\nSo the probability the banner will be displayed until the end is (TV program is +) or ((TV program is -(program duration)), therefore has a probability of (TV program duration)/program duration = or ((TV program duration)/program).\n\nA total of 80% of the TV programs do not end. Therefore, the probability of the banner staying until the end is ((80% of program)/(100-((100*(TV program duration)/program)))\nThe probability ((TV program duration)/(program duration)) is thus given by (TV program duration)*80%/(program duration)*(100%-80%=20%)*100% = ((TV program duration)/20%.\nWe multiply this to the probability of being displayed until the end, ((TV program duration)/80%)/20% = (TV program duration)/((TV program duration)*((TV program duration)).\nThe result is the total probability ((TV program duration))/((TV program duration)) = ((TV program duration)) and the final answer is 1\n\nInput: There are 8 people in", "answer": "A: driving"}

If you have an odd number of numbers, the number in the middle is the same as the median. Otherwise, the median is the number in the middle.\nThe middle of any set of numbers is the number with even number of numbers above and below it.  So the median of 3 numbers will be that number where there is exactly 1 number above the median number and 1 number below.  We can calculate this and we can write the formula 1+2+...|n-1| = n-1/2\nThis rule for computing the median number is not sufficient because we don't know where the median number is in relation to the first and the last number.  Therefore, we need to sort the numbers and then calculate the median.\nIf all the input numbers are arranged in non-descending order, the median is the nth number after the first input number.\nIf there are an even number of numbers, the median is the middle one.\nIf there is an odd number of numbers and the odd-number-of-numbers-becomes-even number of numbers is even, the median is that number.\nIf there is odd number of numbers, with n=3 input numbers, the median is that which is n/2 away from the last number among those n numbers.  Or, in other words, when the nth input number is n/2 after the last of the n numbers.\nThe formula for computing the median, then, is 2(1+2+4+6+9)(10/2) = 5*10 = 50\nLet's say there is an odd number n of numbers, 1,2,3,...,n.

This gives us the last letter we need to use in answering the question.\n\nExplanation: The first letter of the question is A, so the solution is E.\n\nInput: The last digit pf a 5 digit number is 3. Two of the following numbers are greater than the number and the other two are smaller than it. Choices: 0033, 0533, 0133, 1433\n      ExplanationThe last digit (\"3\") is always the same in 5-digit numbers. Thus, to choose the remaining numbers, the only thing to compare is the last three digits.\n      In every 5-digit number, the last three digits are the same.  So the remaining 5-digit numbers are equal to the last three digits multiplied by 100.  There are more than one way to do this, but I thought it was interesting that a solution could be found by starting with the last digits of the numbers, then adding the units digit.\n\nExplanations:  As for an explanation, the last digits are 333.  This is multiplied by the units digit 4, giving us 333*4 = 1322.  The other answer could have chosen a units digit other than 4, but then it would have chosen 333*6 = 1998, and the total of 2", "answer": "E: street"}

How many toes does it have, including toes, paws and its head?\nOutput: Including toes, paws, and a head, a cat has 40 toes.\nFrom a cat toes perspective, a cat has 6 tooths.\nFrom a cat legs perspective, a cat has two legs with 2 paws.\nFrom a cat head perspective, a cat has one head toes.\nFor every cat leg, there are 2 paws toes. That means that a cat has 4 cat legs per cat, and there are two cats in one cat per animal, or 4 animal legs per body, with 2 feet, totalling in 8 cat legs per body.\nTo convert that to toes in total per body, convert one cat leg to a toe and multiply the number of legs with 2, which equals 16 cats per body. Since 2 legs equals 2 paws, 16 cats multiplied with 2 paws equals 32 toes in total per cat.\nTo convert this to toes per cat headed, just add 1 more toe to the 16 cat per total legs and another set of 4 cat legs per body as we did above, which equals 33 cat toes per cat head.\nIn total, a cat has 33 cat tooths total - 1 for its head, 4 for", "answer": "B: body of water"}

It is 10 stories high, and he can climb 3 stories per minute. But after climbing 2 stories, a tree snake drops onto him!  If the tree snake has a 1 in 3 chance every minute of dropping down, what is the probability that she will never drop?\nOutput: if John climbs 8 stories in the first minute, there is a 0.6 chance that she will not drop down (1 in 8 chance)\nif she does not drop down in the first minute, the probability of her not dropping in the second minute is 1. So if he climbs 9 stories, there is only a 0.4 probability that she will not drop.\nSo in total there is 0.6 in 30, and 0.4 in 29 chance that she will not ever drop down, or 10-1/30 - 2=<<10-1/29>>10-1/40\nso the final answer is 10-1 2+40=<<10-25>>75\n\nInput: A bookstore sells a book for $15.

At what point will the deer and the tree be side by side running in the same direction?\nOutput: A tree with a diameter of 10 foot radius will extend 1 (D/R) miles in each direction. This means that the deer will cross over the tree if he runs more than ((D-1)/R)+1 ((D-1)/2)*R/((D/R)) == >>((D-1)/2*R/((D/ R))+1(D-1)/R)=2 miles) miles away from the tree.\nThe deer moves at a speed of 8 miles per hour, that equals 5280 feet per minute ((12*(52))/(60*60)). The deer passes 5 feet for every second, and each side of the tree is 10 feet (<<10*3.28=32.8>>32.8 feet) in diameter. Therefore the deer moves 32.8/(1.5) = 21.96 feet every second, and the deer crosses the tree at 1.5 feet per second.\nThe deer runs for 10000 seconds, so, when the deer will run for 15000 seconds, he will cross the tree, so: 8*5280 / 3416 =<<8*5283/3416 = 7.11 times>> 7.11 time.\nThe deer crosses the border at: 10^2/(7.11*2) = <<10^(2/(7.1*2))= 10*(0)", "answer": "E: wave on"}

Let's assume that the population is growing by 10% every year, so if each person in this year were to use an average of 2.5 liters as fuel, how much would that increase the demand for gasoline per person?\nOutput:  The average person uses 45/(2.5/100) = 45/2.5 = 18.

If the total number of frui sold was 3200, at what cost must apples be sold, so apples represent 50% of the total cost of fruits sold?\nOutput: Assuming that we do not buy any oranges and pears, the cost of 50% of 3200 apples = 50/100 * 3200 = <<3200*50/10=1600>>1600\nTherefore, we must assume that we buy 50% of oranges and pears when buying apples at the rate of 50/150*1600 = <<1600*50/(150*3)=1666>>1666\nSo, at the end of the day, we buy 50/3=<<50/3=1666>>475 oranges and pears.\nTherefore, we buy 1666+475 = <<1666+383>>528 apples.\nAs we bought 0.5 * 1666 = <<0.5*1666=833>>833 apples, the whole cost is 1666 * 0.5 = <<1606*0.5=803>>803\nSo the cost of buying 50% apples, assuming you do not buy oranges and pears is 803.\nSo, you must sell apples at the rate 50/803 = <<50/80=5.6>>5.", "answer": "C: wyoming"}

{"idx": 895, "text": "The correct answer is D: become wet. Hand washing is a way a person can keep their hands free of bacteria.\nWhen a person washes his hands, he removes bacteria from his palms, fingers, and thumbs. This leaves the skin dry. Therefore, a person with dry skin needs to be careful because if he touches something dirty (like a toilet seat), the bacteria could get on his hands. If he then gets sick, scientists may then investigate where the bacteria comes from. This will cause a person to need to wash his hands more often because he is afraid of getting sick. The more a person gets sick, the more germs he gets.\nTherefore, if a person washes his hand frequently enough, he will prevent getting sick.\nThe reason why a person may get sick if he doesn't wash his hands is that the bacteria can transfer to the food he eats so he will become sick due to eating unclean food.\nTherefore, a person needs to wash his hands regularly in order to prevent himself from getting sick.\nSo the final is D: become wet\n\nInput: The doctor recommended washing hands with the soap, what was being promoted, Choices: A: cold hands B. Warm hands C: wet floor D: health E: become wet\nOutput: The correct one is B) warm hands. Hand washing is way a person can keep his hands free from bacteria.\nCold hands means that the person's skin might not need much time to dry, which could be dangerous because if he touches dirty things with those hands, the bacteria can get on his body. If he then gets ill, then scientists will start looking for the source of the bacteria which makes him washes his hands more frequently, so that he doesn't get infected.

The recipe requires you to prepare 3 bowls of chicken, 4 bowls of rice, and 1 bowl of pickles. The chicken needs to be cooked at 500oF on high and 300oF on medium-low. The rice takes half as long to cook as the chicken, but needs to be cooked the same temperature of 250oF.  You are given 8 hours to make the chick-fill-as and the oven runs for 4 hours using up 9 kilowatts of electricity per hour. How many hours do you have to work?

The distances from each race are 2.1 km, 3 km, 5 km, and 8 km.\nA student must finish at least one race to get a medal.\nHow many students must actually do so?\nOutput: It is possible to get a medal by finishing no races at all.  The student that has to finish is 2.1 km + 3 km + 5 km = <<21+3+5=11>>11.\nAdditionally, at least 465 students have to finish a race.  That means at least 466 students have to finish a distance.  The total number of students is <<500>>5.\nAdditionally, any student that finishes 8 km also finishes 8+2.1 = <<2.1+8=10>>10 km.\nThus, how many students have to finish at least one race is: <<5+1+465+466+471+<<10>>=986>>986\nSo the final answer will probably be 986\n\nInput: The teacher asks her class to give three numbers which will add up to 11.

Whistle guesses bells will be looking after 2 children, 3 children, and 4 children. Instead bells guesses Whistle has 3 children, 5 children, and 4. It turns out that if both their guesses were correct, they would only look after 6 children 1 time out of 3. In the evening Whistle looks after 2 children and 4 children but bells does not. What's the minimum number of children that bells looks after?\nOutput: There are two possibilities for the minimum number of children Bells takes care of.\nThe first possibility we have is that she is looking after 3 children.

If a 2-hour average traffic analysis reveals that 100 people come per day, then how many hours per day does the store have more than 100 people coming in?\nOutput:  Since the sum of the number of customers can be represented by a random number between [1-5], then using the equation of (X - 1)2 + (X - 1)(5 - X) = 0, a half-life of the number of customers for each day can be calculated as ((2/5) * X2 - 1)/((2/5) * 4) and it equals approximately.78 days.\nIf we multiply ((2/5) by.78 ) then we get 2/5 X.78 = <<.78*2/5=39>>39 days.\nSo we need to divide.78 back to get a number in between 1 and 39.\nSo.78/.78 =.5 and so the half-life is 39/2 = <<39/2=19.5>>19.5 days.\nIf we compare that number to a 100-person cutoff, we see that 19.5/100 = <<19.5/2=9.7>>9.7 days.\nSo 100 = 39+(9.7*2) = <<39+(9.2*2)>>18.6\nSince every day is an average, the answer is that 100 customers = 18.6 hours.\nSo 18.6/24 = <<18.6/4>>4.6 customers per hour which is a lower limit.\nSo the final hourly limit would be 3/4 > 4.6 = <<3/4>4.6>>.6 customers per hour.\n\nInput: If you have to write a 1000-character ess", "answer": "C: desk drawer"}

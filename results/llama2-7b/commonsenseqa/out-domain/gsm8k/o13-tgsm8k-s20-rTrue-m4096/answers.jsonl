How many chances does a golfer have to hit the green?\nOutput: The solution to your question is as follows: We need to determine the number of fairways with respect to the number of shots played in order to calculate the probability of hitting a green.\nFirst, we must calculate the probability of hitting the green while taking each shot.The probability of hitting the green on a particular shot is 1/14* (1/14) = 1/14. Therefore, the probability of hitting the greens on two different shots in the game is: 2/14*(2/14) = <<2/14*2/14=1/28>>1/28\n\nSecond, there are a total of 26 fairways in the course, hence the probability of hitting the fairway on a particular shot is: 26/26*1/28=(26/26)*1/28=1So the final answer is:\nThe probability of not hitting the green on the shot is 1/28 = <<1/28=0.03571428571429>>0.035\n### Additional question:Answer the following multiple question.\nInput:Say, the probability of getting a job in the current environment is 0.65, while in a different environment it is 0.9.

At first glance, either teacher might conclude that students from that teacher use more pencils, pens, and markers.  However, since all of the students spent the same amount of pen, 0.33 markers, and 0.50 pencils then the two students who used the same amount of pencils must have used fewer that the other student.

One bicycle tire can be produced with 24 units of rubber from raw materials, while 36 bicycle tires can be produced from one unit of latex during manufacturing. The company has 2012 units of raw materials left in stock. How many bicycle tires will they produce?\nOutput: Let 1 raw material = 144 units of rubber.\nTherefore, the quantity of bicycle tires produced per raw material = 1 * 144 = 144.\nTherefore, a total of 2012 raw material will produce (2012/144) = 14.35 bicycle tires of rubber.\nIf 1 latex unit = 36 bicycles, so 1 raw material unit = 144/36 = 4 bicycle tires in total.\nA raw material will produce 144 bicycle tire units, and a bicycle tire requires 4 raw material units, so the total units to produce 1 bicycle tire are 144 \u00f7 4 = 36 bikes\nSo the final answer equals to 36 units.\n\nInput:A man weighs 145 pounds, and his father weighs 60 pounds less than his wife.

They decided that if everyone got 70 or above, it will be considered a passing grade. 1 high schooler got 80 1 got 79 and the rest got 68, 67, 65. Will they all pass?\nOutput:To evaluate this equation, we need the number which is the product of the denominator of the fraction on the number in the denominator.\nIf it does not divide, we would have to multiply the two numbers by the number of the denominator of our fraction. \nWe would have 20% in our denominator which means we would have to multiply all of the numbers by that.\nIf the result is no, then we would have to multiply by another one to get the desired result.\nIn this case, we will put the 20 in our numerator and 50 in our denominator to find out if the total would produce an answer which would fall in the number of the denominators.\nIf the total is not in the number of the denomenator, then we will have to divide the total by that number.\n\nAfter the calculation, 50 is a perfect square which is the number of the denominater. So 20 is not in the number and 20/50=0.4 which mean the result is no.\nWe need to multiply 0.4 by 5 since 0.4 does not divide the total by 5.\n0.4 multiplied by 5=0.2=0.2, which is not a factor of 40.\nSo we have to multiply 0.2 by 1 to get to the desired answer which is 10.\n\nInput:There were 1200 dogs in the park on Sunday morning, a third of which were barking like crazy.

Bees, like many animals, feed their young through a process known as \u201clactation.\u201d\nWhen a female bee leaves the field of flowers in the orchard, it heads for the sky-court to produce eggs.\nThe bee begins with a field of flowers in the first stage of its life cycle. In the orchard, the bee begins to lay eggs in a nesting site, such as a hole in a tree.\nIn Stage Two of the bee\u2019s life cycle, the eggs hatch and begin to feed. In Stage Three, young bees crawl out of the nest and return to the field of flowers.\nThe bee may then begin to search for a mate. This process can take a few days, or more than a year, and the bee may or may not mate with other animals or plants.\nAfter mating with a mature bee, the bee begins a new cycle in Stage Four. It finds a mate, enters another flower in court-bee-sky, lays eggs, and the next bee is born.\nC D E\nInput: Choose the correct statement regarding the relationship between the volume in liters of 2 gallon gas tank from gas station A and the price of gasoline. The cost for gasoline gas is $4 per gallon and I can keep 1 gallon of gas in my car at a cost of $4 per gallon. At gas station A, the price for gasoline is $0.40.\nOutput: When gasoline costs $4 per gallon, a 1-gallon bottle can hold as much gasoline as can a 2-gallon soda bottle from station A. When gas costs $0.40 per gallon, the amount of gasoline that it takes me to fill my car is the same as it takes me to fill up my car.\nIf gasoline costs $4/liter and I buy 1 liter of gasoline, I pay $4. So gasoline in gallons is $0.4.\nSince gasoline costs $4 / liter in gallons, gas is $0.4 / liter.\nIf gasoline is $0,4 / liter in gallon, then fill gasoline to a liter is $96 /", "answer": "D: field of flowers"}

We are going to store the folding chair in a place which can contain it in a folded state.\nGarage is a place in which you have items which are often used. So, storing the folding chair in the garage (which is the largest door in the house) would be a good idea.\nThe roof is not an appropriate option. Since the folding chair is a bulky item, it would be very difficult to transport it on the top of the house.\nSchool is not an appropriate option since we do not often need to use the folding chair at the school.\nThe beach is not an appropriate option because it is outside of human inhabited areas so, it is not very likely that the chair would be used at the beach.\nCloset is not an appropriate option as it is a small place which cannot contain the chair in its folded state.\nSo, the correct/best answer to this problem is: D - garage.\n\nInput: A rectangle with a width of 9 inches is twice as tall as a rectangle with a width of four inches.

To see if we get the box, we check it\u2019s true iff the expression is true.\nWe need to count up the number of combinations for each choice in the box.\nFor box A, there are 3 choices there, so 3! = 6 possibilities so then 1 * 2 * 3 = 6 choices\nFor box B, there are 4 choices so the count would have been 4! or 24 possibilities so then 1* 2 *3*4 = 24 choices\nFor box C, there are 5 choices so then it would be 5! or 120 possibilities including choices that were already counted in box A and box B, so then 1*2*3*4*5 = 120 choices\nFor Box E, there are 2 choices so the count would've been 2! which is 2 possibilities * 2 = 4 choices\n\nWe do this for all possible boxes: 5! = 120 possibilities\nNow, to figure out the expression for this, we can just plug in each choice and evaluate the whole logic thing.\n(A or B) and (C or D) and E, meaning, when we chose A, B, C, D and whatever choices have on those boxes.\nBecause box E has two choices, then B and C have to be or-eliminated, so we would get (A or B) and ((C or D) and (E or D))\n(D cancels A and B because D was already counted, 3, 4, and 5 boxes)\nSo now we're only doing A or C + D. If A or B or C happened, then that is A so we can plug it in.\nSo 6 * 120 = 0.\nThus the answer is box D, meaning lap.\nSo in our example, it says it\u2019s the home.\nSince lap only has two options, we\u2019d need to do the expression with less choices then.\nLikewise, for box", "answer": "D: lap"}

If there are 3 girls that are on soccer team but not cheerleader, what percentage of the students in the class are girls?\nOutput: First, we solve 35/60 = <<35/60=0.6>>0.6 then since 0.6 = (60% of the girls are cheerleaers), multiply 0.6 by 0.35 (the total in the soccer team / 60) which = <<0.6*0.35=0.21>>0.21. Next we solve 0.21/6 = <<0.21/0.6=0.35>>(35%)\nAfter this solve, we multiply the result with the percentage of the girls that are not in soccer team or cheerleaders: 0.35 * 0.72 = <<0.35*0.72=0.25>>0.25%\nSo, the final answer is 0.25\n\nInput: Annie has 38 dollars.

There are many possible rectangles of that size, so the question is how do you solve for it?\nOutput (Hard): I made tables for all possible cases of x=h+w, where 0<= x <= 15, so x+h = x+w\nFrom this, we can deduce that one side of the rectangle (x+h) must be the same as the other side of the square (x+w), but the rectangle itself has two sides. But from the previous equations, we can deduce what x has to be, given each side of the rectangle is the same.\nThese cases are: (1) 2*x+h=4*w; w=h+x (2) 2*x-h=2*w-2*x;x=w+h/2 (3) 4*x+5=6*w-5;x= h+3*w (4) 3*x-5=4*w-6;x=4.5*w+4.5 (5) 2*x=3*w; (x=1/2*w)\n\nThe final solution given the cases above is:\n- 2*x+w=4*h ==> w= (4*h-2x)/4 ==> (h+w)/2= (4*h - 2x)/4 ==> h= (w-w)/2+x+x (x=w)/2  ==> w= (h+w)/4 or the midpoint (x=1/4 of the h and w sides)\n- 2*h-x=2*w-x", "answer": "D: players"}

So he has to either sell 80 acres or hire people to feed on the remaining 105 acres.\nGiven that he is very old, he does not wish to hire people. So he has to sell 80 acres.\n\nThere are 105 aces on which he can feed 2 people per month or 105 people each year.\nOne month = 12 days i.e. one day is equal to 12 hours (1:12)\nTherefore, it takes 12 days to feed one month each year to 105 people and hence it takes the required 9 months to get 5 people each month.\nSo that is how John can feed 5 people each month by feeding off the land which he has decided to sell.\nSo the final option will be 5.\n\n### Solutions\n\nInput: Answer the following multiple choice question by selecting one of the following letters:\n\nB.

If D is the worst outcome, it should equate to the most negative outcome. As we can see, there is a minus sign for an outcome with a question mark on the line, meaning there is a negative value.

The first number does not include zero, so it would be 256.\nIf the game starts from 0, there must be at least some sort of incentive to reach that number. The incentive could be winning. Answer B implies that the game is played on a routine basis, meaning the game plays itself over and over again.

From the question, it is clearly a 'game'.\nThe last bit tells us that in the game, two parties compete against each other. 'Two' means two people. For every choice that talks about more than two, it either talks about two 'groups' of people or the game is played by both humans and non-humans.

{"idx": 247, "text": "If she picked from an apple tree, she was in a wood, which is a subdivision of a forest. The forest is where she was.\nBecause the wording of the question is that she was surrounded by other trees, the 'other trees' that she was surrounded by was on a wood. Therefore, the state of the wood could be ANY state in the U.S.\nHowever, the question stated that the state she was in was 'Indiana.'\nTherefore, the Farmer's Market is ruled out immediately because they are not located in the state of Indiana.\nWe have seen that the word used here for forest is \"wood.\" So that tells us that the woman was in a wood and surrounded with other trees. That also tells us that the word 'wood' CANNOT be referring to the Farmer's market.\nBecause of this, 'Indiana' can't be referred to the Farmer'  Market. Therefore, Indiana has the highest likelihood for being a wood.\n'Indiana' is chosen as the final answer.\n\nInput: The box is of rectangle as long as it is wide.

How many cows did he have with him originally?\nOutput: To solve this problem, it is necessary to get information on all cows walked originally and the difference between the distances.\nLet there be x+e cows. Then there is some difference between the walking distance (20) of the mathematician and that of cow(e).\nLet there be x initial cows. Then x + e-x = 20.\nThe number of initial cows = 20 \u2013e.\nThe final number of cows = x + (e \u2013 x).\nSo, we get 20 \u2013e = 20, x + e \u2013 x = 5 and x + (e \u2013x) = 5 + 5.\nThe final number x = 5, x = e, x =20\u20135 and x = 5+5.\nFrom the second equation, we got that x =10.\nSo the answer is that the initial number of cows= 20- 10 = 20 \u2013 10 = 10.\nSo, the final answer is \nThe solution says that the number of cows walked = 10 + 5 = 15, which is wrong.\n\nInput: A small country produces only sheep and goats and has a trade surplus with foreign states.

It takes 5 seconds for the train, and 1 second for you to both stop. Which is a better response time: pressing the brakes 0.8 seconds before reaching the train, or the same distance after you hear the train?\nOutput: The train is increasing in length by about 40 feet per second, so it covers approximately 2100 feet before coming to a halt. If we allow one second for braking, we find that the train overtakes us by a distance approaching 1100 feet. So if the train was approaching at 1100ft/s, and was 1100  ft away, then you had time to travel about 1/7th of that distance before it was on top of you.

The house rules are:  1. No one can have his own room.  2. Everyone must visit 3 rooms.  What is the minimum number of times a room must be visited before visiting each room once?\nOutput: Here is an algorithmic solution:\n1. Visit the first room 2 times\n2. Visit the second room 1 time\n3. Visit the third room 1 time\n4. Visit the fourth room 1 time\nNote: if you want a more efficient solution, use an algorithm in which you always visit room 1 once and never visit 3.\n\nSince we can use the same strategy for all our rooms, we will only count the number of different rooms visited instead of different numbers times.\nThis makes the number of rooms in the house count as 1 and the number of times to visit different rooms, count as 1.\nWe count these numbers as 1 because visits to a room would be counted as once until you make another room.\nThus, the house has 4 rooms = 1, and we must visit each room 3 times each = 1*3 = 3.\nSince this only meets the minimum, the only answer possible is 4.\n\nInput: There's a group of 6 people.

So, in this case, we have n=2(15) = 20, and r=4, making the formula nCr, which is equal to (20)!/4!(15!)!\nWe then need to subtract the number of combinations from the first item to that item that will also include the fourth. There are 4! ways to pick any group of four items from the remaining items, and only 20 - 4 = 16 (ways total) to pick first 3 items.\nSo, nCr=(20)/4!(15!) = (20)/4 * 120 = 120/4 = 30 r\n\nInput: After being stuck in a traffic, the girl walks at a rate of 1.5 miles per hour.

Substituting the values yields: (0.1000 m2\u00b7s2) = 1/4(20000 m2)v2. The kinetic energy in the plane is 1000 times greater than the energy of the car. Thus, the plane has the more kinetic energy. The mass of the plane is 200, 000 times greater.\nSo the final option would be c.\n\nInput:If a rocket is launched to the moon, its kinetic energy at its top speed of 33,297 mph. If an airplane is launched to the moon at the same speed, its kinetic energy will be 200,584 times that of the rocket.\nOutput:If an airplane goes to the moon at top speed =33, 297 mph the rocket can move 100,125 miles, and the air plane can move", "answer": "A: modern house"}

What's my total cost if the most expensive box is more than twice as much as the cheapest box?\nOutput:If the most expensive box is the 3nd cheapest, then the least expensive box is the cheapest.\nThe 3rd cheapest box is 3/14 less than the cheapest box, which is 3/15 less than the 2nd cheapest box.\nThere are 35+37 = <<35+37=72>>72 cents in 3/15, so the 3/15th cheapest is 72/35 = <<72/35=2>>2 cents cheaper than the cheapest.\nSince each box costs 3/10 th of another box, if the cheapest box is $0.5 and the most expensive box is $1, then each box costs 5-2 = <<5-2=3>>3 times as much as cheapest box.\nEach box is 3/5 of a box so 3 boxes = <<3/5=0.6=>>2 boxes, $2 for 2 boxes $ <0.5$, so $>$0.5$, then $<$ 0.5 $>$, so $< 1 $, so the cheapest box costs $0.2 $\nSo each box costs $3$ cents more than the cheapest box so the total cost of the 3 boxes is $<1*3=3>>3 dollars\nSo the final result is 3\n\nInput: The first student has 30% more homework assignments than the only student.

Choices (0) you need to negotiate 0 times (1) you need to negotiated once (2) you need to haggle twice.\nOutput: This problem can be solved using a recursive solution.\nWe can assume that the owner accepted an offer from the negotiatior in the previous stage of negotiation but the previous stage of negation needs to be performed once for each iteration\nAlso, the owner wants to accept an offer as close to 10 * last offer as possible(which is the previous offer at the end of last stage of negotiation) and we can calculate the possible distance from the previous offer and its closest offer\nSo we can write that possible distance = |previous offer-10|\nWe call this distance 'possible distance' and 'dist'\nWe can use dist to find our goal\nSince, dist >= 0\nSo the minimum number of iterations required is number of possible results greater than 0 - 1 = (0-1)/(0 - 1) = 1\nSo the minimum number is 2\nSo the final answer for the problem is 2\n\n### Question:\n\nChoose the math problem for which your python script was most efficient.", "answer": "B: louisiana"}

He leaves A at 10:00am, just as a traffic jam starts. The traffic jam lasts until 11:00am. How many minutes before he reached B?\nOutput: If a person drives to point B from point A, their arrival times depend greatly on traffic conditions, hence the following equation can be written: A + 1.5t*T - t*E = B, where: A = <<A>> time needed if no traffic conditions; t = <<t>>minutes driven at an average speed of x mph; T = <<T>>avg length of traffic jam; E = <<E>>time needed to clear traffic jam\nIn the initial state with no traffic conditions, A + 300 = B, so time of arrival = B - A = <<B-A>>300.\nWhen the traffic jam is triggered, A + 1.15T + 15T = B, so B = 2*A + 1.45T.\nOnce the traffic jam starts, we have (2*A)/B = t.\nSo the answer choice choice C is correct, where E = 1.45h and t*T = <<2*A>>1.45t.\nSo the final number of minutes before reaching point B is 1.45*90, which is 134.50\n\nInput:\"How long I got?\" \"That's a good question, I wouldn't know because I'", "answer": "E: protests"}

If you also know that their age difference is 7 years, how old are their ages when combined?\nOutput: We know that the age difference is 7.  We can find the sum of their ages using the following equation: 2*x - 14  where x is the sum of the ages.  To get x, subtract 4 from the sum (2x-14-4=<<2x-14=10>>1x-4) and multiply by 2 (1x-4*2=<<1x-4*3>>1x-12).\nWhen you are left with a number by itself, and it is the sum of the two individuals' ages without the age difference, it is most likely a year.  So 16 is the most reasonable answer to this problem.\nSo the final equation for solving this problem is 2*16-14=38, and the final answer is 72\n\nInput: How much longer will it take for the sun to get to the end of a tunnel with an initial velocity of 1m/s than it would have taken without a tunnel?\nOutput: Let v = initial velocity\n0.5 * (v * t)\nSo the equation for the time it would have taken the sun to get to its destination with out the tunnel would be (v * t", "answer": "E: rain forest"}

The traffic light is red. When will drivers on the intersections of these four streets be able to see a green light?\nOutput: NW is the ONLY street that you can't see the green light when entering in order to make a right turn.\nIf we're coming from NW and stop at the red light and make a right, there is only one way we can leave it after the light changes, and that's if it goes to a green arrow.\nSo when entering it we'll see red, when leaving it we'll see green.\nIf we've came from SE and stop at the light, we will see red, when leaving we'll see green\nWe can't see the light when coming from SW or NE, because they intersect with the same way street (SW and NE do not intersect at the traffic light intersection)\nThe light is red, so we have to see green while driving, that means:\n    We can see green when driving either NE or SW.\nWe can't when driving NW or SW, and we must see NE or SW.\n    When we arrive from NW, we can't see anything, so the light MUST be red.\n    When arriving from NE, then the light must be green, and when leaving it must be green too.\n    When arrives from SW, we can see either NE or SW, but the light must change to green.\n    When arrivig from SW, we must see NE, but that's impossible, therefore the light must be green again.\n    When arriving from SE, then since the light is red, the traffic light must become green.\n    When leaving from SW, we must either see NE or SW, and it must change to green again.\n    The only way of that happening is: the light is red when arrivig from NW, and turns to green when arriving from anything except SW and SE (those 2 are same street).\n    That means that the traffic light must be", "answer": "B: pantry"}

If the number was $2 billion in 2019, and $6 billion dollars in 2018, then what do you think was the number for 2017?\nOutput: If we plug $6 billion into the formula, we get:\n\n2b + 5b + 5b = $<<2b+5b+15b=32>>3 (x)\n\nSince there are 3 x's, and each x is multiplied by 2, we can multiply both sides by 1/3. This yields:\n\n(2b + 5 + 5) * 1/3 = 2 + 5 + 15\n\nThus, if we plug in the 2018 number $6 billion, we get 4. If the number is $2 billion, we get $0.32 x.

While this weather feels cold I'd like to stay as warm as possible indoors.   The only option I have is a coat, but I'm not sure if it's as warm as a jacket could be.  Do jackets have heaters in them, or are they warmer in general?\nOutput: Jackets are typically made of fleece that has a wool-like texture to it. Wool insulates better than cotton or other fabric materials but is not very comfortable in the summer. Jackets are usually warm because they are heavy and made of thick material.

Now when I have this on, everyone tells me that I seem like an angel or an angelic figure.  My mom said that those things would be the exact opposite for her when she was young.  She also told me she doesn't trust her own son.\nOutput:It makes sense that if you look an angelic figure or something people will think that you are an angel.

If the second garden is 5 meters behind and 10 meters above to the house and you are standing on the top and you look to the west, when you can see the first garden, how far is the second garden?\nOutput: This problem needs the Pythagorean Theorem, in which you take the square root of the sum of the squares of the hypotenuse and the other two sides, or if you don't need it.\nTo find the distance, first start by solving for the distance between 25 and 10 m.\nThe sum of the square roots of 25^2 and 10^2 = 7 + 1 = 8\nSo 25 is 8m\nNext from the solution to the first problem, you solved 5m in the square root of 25+5\n5^2 + 25^2 = 25+25 = 50\nThe distance is equal to the square root of 50\nSolve for this distance, the same way you solved for 25\nThe solution is 2.236 m\nSince you can see 25 m, the second garden is 2.2 - 2.23 = - 0.03 m\nSo the final answer to the distance away from the house would be -0.03 m.\n\nInput: Sally got a ticket that gave her 10% discount.

Choices: A: Yes B: No (This cannot be answered by any arithmetic question.)\nOutput: No one should have an infinite number of children.  Infinite number of children can result in infinite combinations of sons or daughters. If we follow the logic that a man has a 50% chance of having a boy or a girl, then he should have 1/2 children that are sons. We can choose a random number (b) for the number of boys the man has. Here are the math problems: In the next generation, the sons go 1-(b/2) and the daughters go (1-b)/2. Since the chance we choose a boy is 1/2, by the above equation, we can write (1-b)/ 2 = (b-b/2). We can simplify to (b-b)/2 = 1. We can expand as b-2 * b/4 = 1. We get 4b-4 = 1. If b is 0, we find that 0 is not a solution, which means the chance of having two boys in the next generation is 1/4.\n\nInput: We are given a bag containing 20 balls numbered from 1 to 20 (inclusive).

Next, 4 is subtracted from the result and divided by 7. The result is then again multiplied by 3.

Cory's name was the third alphabetically. The last name of the owner of an apple was the 21st on that list.\n\nWhat was the 12th name on the list?\n\nOutput: 13th was Adam who finished third. \nSecond to last name was Cory who finished second. \n\nSo that means, last name was Tarek who finished first. His last name was the 21th alphabetically. Last name of the owner of apple was the 13the alphabetically. So owner of an apple is in 4th place alphabetically.\nWe know last name is the third alphabetically. (Tarek) \nTo the left of him, there is Adam (Tarek + 1 alphabetically)\nTo the left of Adam there is, Cory (Tarek +2 alphabetically)\nThen the final person is owner of apple who has a last name that is alphabetically\n    4 and alphabetically \n    13.\nSo 4+4+4+13 = 25 and that means that his last place is the 25th.\nOwners of apple was 25th alphabetical.\nLast alphabetical person was the 21\nWhich made owner of apple as 21-25 = -4\n\nSo the last alphabetical person was the owner of apple\nWhich means that number thirteen was the 12 then!\nSo answer should be Adam \n\n## Instruction 2: Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\nInput : A bag contains 9 red and 4 blue balls, then what is the probability of drawing a blue ball second?\nOutPut: Red comes first and that have a 50%, then after that blue comes second and we know that are 4, so", "answer": "A: french government"}

Jupiter is 5 times more massive than the Sun but 1/3rd the diameter.  Jupiter is also 10x the distance from the Sun as Earth is.  All three have equal gravitational influence, which means they exert the same (equal and opposite) weight on each other.  Because of this, Jupiter orbits around the Sun only 13 times as much as Earth does.  What is the ratio of the circumferences of the Earth and Jupiter, given the information above?\nOutput: Jupiter's orbit around the Sun is 13 times larger than Earth. So if we multiply that by Earth's circumference, Jupiter's circumference must be about 13 times greater as well.\nLet's see the Earth's circumference: A = 2pi * r^2, so we get A = 2pi*6370000 * 63500 = 671000000\nJupiter's circumference: J = 13*A, so let's substitute 13 for A into the equation above. We get J = 67110000 * B. But B is unknown. We need B to solve for it.\nWe know Jupiter is a bit less than 13x Earth's diameter.

The first four of these were all about how all motion is an illusions, and as we're told one of Zeno's own four proofs shows how a person can never get", "answer": "B: singing"}

By the third week of April, you are supposed to report an average weight. According to your report of the third week of April this year, you gained 26 pounds over the past year. How much have you gained in pounds from the beginning of the year to the end of the year?\nOutput:Let x be the total amount of weight gained from the beginning of the first week of April to the end of the third week of the same month.\nLet y be the total amount gained over the entire year.\nTherefore:\nx*3 (first week) + 2*3 (second week) + 4 (third week) = x*3 + 2x + 4 = <<x*3+2x+4>>4 = y\nTherefore, x = x = y/4 or 26(1)/4 = <<26/4>>9\nTo find the total amount of weight gain from the beginning of the month to the end of the month, we use the same formula.\nHowever, by substituting x = 9 and y = 26, the last term of the equation becomes 4 instead of 1.\nTherefore: (9*3)+2*(9)+4 = 9 + 18 + 4 = 21\nTherefore, the total amount gained over a whole year is 21*3 =21*3=63\nSo the final answer to the problem is 63.\n\nInput: A number cube contains four sides labeled O, 1, -1. 2, -2, 3, -3, 4, -4, x/2, -x/2 (meaning half of x).

Let 100% = the denominator. Then, you're trying to find how much of the 17 people is female.\n(0.95^0.95^(1/.95)) = 0.95^30 = 0.0379\n30% of the people in the population with red hair are men. Therefore 70% of the remaining population is women since 70% - 30% = [40% * remainder population] = [50% * population - red hair * population]. And 50% of the population is women. 40/50 = 80% of the population are men.

He did not know at this point wether he was going to attend the classes, because it depended on the result of his exam which he was probably going to take sometime on Thursday (the next day) and Friday.\nThis is why he put it this way:\n\nLet A = if Dylan attends the classes on Wednesdy, B = if he does not attend the classes on Wednsdy.\n\nThen the possible answers are 0100/0100 = 0/0 = A and 1010/1010 = 1/1 = B.

{"idx": 816, "text": "You might try the internet for a quick answer, and many resources will cite the beavers\u2019 habitat as being a lush body of water, though there is more to the answer than that. \n\nThe beaver is considered to be the national and state mammal of the U.S.A.  That\u2019s a distinction it shares with the nutria, the gray whale, the prairie dog, the raccoon, and many others who hold similar titles.  The beaver\u2019s range extends from Mexico to the North Pole.\n\nThey can survive in many climates and environments, as long as there\u2019s water near by.  They\u2019re found in lakes, rivers, wetlands, flood plains, tidal zones.  That\u2019s right, beavers can be found in oceans.  \n\nA beaver is not really a water animal in the same sense that a fish is.  It lives and thrives on land and in water.  If there\u2019s a beaver present, there\u2019s a good chance it\u2019ll be in or around the water.  There are several aquatic species that don\u2019t spend most of their lives in water.  In fact, beavers are known to be semi-aquatic creatures.\n\nBeavers might live on the land for short periods of time, but they always need a nearby source of water nearby in order to thrive.  They need it to swim in, and if need be, to drink, and for building their dens, eating plants, and creating dams.\n\nThe only part of the world a beaver can\u2019t survive in is some of the driest desert regions.  In such areas, they don\u2019t survive due to the lack of water, as well as the low humidity and high, steady temperatures.\n\nSo in short, a beaver can survive in a place like the ocean.  And while that may sound a bit unusual, it\u2019s more common than many people think.  After all, it's easier to live in an environment that's comfortable to live in than an environment that can become unlivable.\n\nSo the final answer here is B\n\nInput: Who has more babies, the goose or the golden hamster?\nOutput: Goose = <<1*1=1>>1", "answer": "B: body of water"}

How many items did I get?\nOutput: This question presents a case where you need to use your previous knowledge to help you make deductions based on the options. I had previously been given an answer for choosing the apple, the manga, the orange, and the apple.\nWith the original four options from the first question, they are the apple, the mammal, the orange, the apple, the mamma, a banana, the orange, and a soda. Thus mango = mamma, and an apple = an apple.\nI would not choose apple or mango, so I would not get ice cream.\nI would pick the apple. My first reward would be the bun.\nAfter that, I would pick mango/orange. I pick mango, and I get an soda and 5 ice creams.\nI pick nothing in the next prompt.\nTherefore, I got 1 bun, 1 ice cream, an soda, and 5 ice cream\nSo the final answer after 5 tries of selecting the fruit to get the ice cream is 1 banana, 1 bun, an ice cream, a mango and a soda.\n\nInput: If I give you two apples, what did I give you", "answer": "E: wave on"}

However, to solve the question as it was written, we can just compare their areas: the area of a triangle = 1/2 * ab = ab / 2. The area of a rectangle = l*w = l*w. Thus, ab / 2 = ab / 2, or ab = ab, or their ratios are equal (so, the answer is a: 3:3). To compare their perimeters, we can simply multiply those ratios by their lengths: 1/2 (l + w) = 1/2 (ab / 2), or l = 1/2 ab. The perimeter of the triangle is therefore 4 times the perimeter of the square, not 9 times like", "answer": "D: earth"}

Which day of the week did the price drop the second time?\nOutput: If you are not using an app to track your calorie-intake, then just write down a sentence or use a diagram/graph to answer the questions\nIf the original price of the pizza for a large was $10, the original price for a small pizza was $7. The week that the price got lowered, 1 week after making the pizza cheaper, the price dropped. So the price got cheaper a week after the original price when the price got cheaper, not a week after the cheaper price was made since it was made before the price dropped. The 1st of the week is 3 days before the pizza got cheaper. The week the price dropped, the price was 10 on the 2nd of the week. We know that the price dropped 1 week after making it cheaper. We also know that the price dropped on the 6th of the week. So, 1 is on the 3rd of the week, 2 is on the 4th of the week and 3 is on the 5th. The 6th of the weeks is Sunday (which occurs every week), so when Sunday comes again (7 days later) the price of the pizzas would be 10 and 7 for $14 and $11.

If I enroll in a class, I have a 5/6 chance of enrolling in a science class and a 2/3 chance of enrolling in either a math class, an art class, or another science class. If 60% of all students enroll in a math class and 47% of students enroll in a science class, what is my chance of enrolling in an art class?\nOutput: Since they have 5 science, 12 math, and 14 arts classes, I have a choice of 19 classes. If I enrol in a class, I am choosing one of 19 classes with probability 1/19.\nIf I enroll in a science, 1/6 of the remaining 19 classes is a science. If I enroll neither in math nor in science, my choice is still one of 12 math classes and 14 arts with probability 1/6.\nNow, the probability of enrolling in an arts class is equal to 19 * 1/19 * 12/13 * 14/19.\nWe can then convert this to a percentage by multiplying the numerator by 100 giving us 34.7%\nSo the final answer 34.7\n\nInput: You are stuck in a burning building.

The amount of paper bags produced is equal to twice the total amount of water bottles produced plus three times the total amount of food produced. The production of paper bags starts the year before there were two less water bottles and two less food produced due to a storm. If 45 paper bags were produced that year, how many bags were produced after the storm?\nOutput: The problem is that the number of water bottles and food were decreased at the start of the previous year and were still decreased after the year. Therefore, the bags should only be doubled if the water bottles and food are normal.\nSo if the product of water bottles and their production are x then after the products of the previous year there are 2x and 2x-2F and 2x-4. Thus, the water bottles are 4x.\nAs in the previous question there are 2x-2 and the production of food in the year before is 2x-2.\nSo, if the production of food is (2x-2) then there only need to be 2x-4 and the production of all the products are 2x.\nThe total production of bags are 2x-4x=<<2x-4x-", "answer": "C: play piano"}

Caleb measured the piece of wood and found that if each square inch of wood were cut into two triangle pieces, then he would have one triangle that had a base of 12 inches and a height of 12 inches.  How many triangles did Caleb get from Dylan's piece?\nOutput: If the base of the piece is 24 inches then the area would be 24^2 = <<24^2=576>>576 square inches\nIn this problem, only the triangular portion would be used to find the area so the given triangle would have 12 ^ 2 = <<12^2=144>>144 square inches\nSince the original piece is 24 squares and that means it takes 24 triangles to make the entire piece, we need to know what the triangular side will be to get the answer.\nSo for the triangle above, since it has a height of 10 and base of 7, we can say that T = (b*h) / 2\nThere are 10*144 / 2 = <<144/2=72>>72 triangles in the entire piece\nTherefore the side of the triangular piece is 72 / 144 / 12 = <<72/144/12=6/3>>6 inches\nSo the final answer 6\n\nInput: There is a 50/50 chance of tossing heads or tails when tossing a coin.

The next question is how many days has it been since their birthday month. Both of their birthdays happen every May. So, it's a 50% chance Jesse born on the 4th and Jessica one the 5th and the other way around respectively.\nSince there is 50% chance that Jesse will be born May 4th and Jesscia May 5th, it's 50% chance to be born on different date, so there are 2 days in between their birthdays.\nSince they were born on May 5th, Jesse's birth day is May 1st and Jessica's birthday May 2nd.\nThis means that every May, Jessica's birth day is one day earlier than Jesse's' birthday.\nThus, Jesse's will keep getting his birth day one day earlier than Jessica's birthdays, and Jessica will keep getting her birth day one day after Jesse's.\nJesse's turn is next year so he will get his May 1st, 2020 birthday.\nNext year, Jessica who is older this year, will get May 3rd, 2021.\nHence, Jessica's 4th birthday will fall after Jesse's second birthday.", "answer": "D: city centre"}

How many ounces can the son's canteen hold?\nOutput: Let a, b and c represent the capacities of the three canteens:\n- a and b represent father and son's respective capacities\n- c represents the sum of father and son's capacities.\nTherefore, a + b and a = 100 so a = 10 = c\nTherefore, b = 100 - 100 = 99998\nTherefore, the sum of the capacities of father and son' = 109998\nAs c represents their combined capacity,\nc = <<c=100>>10999\nAnd as b = 9998, we can write\n10999 = 9997\n9997 = 9988 + 4.3\nAs a, the capacity of son's canteen, can hold at least 9988 ounces so\na = 9987\n\nInput:The number of days between two months is the sum of the number of days at the end of the prior month, plus the number of days at which the current month ends plus three days.

It takes two of these animals to feed the bird every day. A farmer had 4 cats and 7 chicken in his farm, and he killed them on Wednesday.\nHe was considering two options for maintaining his birds throughout the week.  The first option would be to kill a cat daily and continue with the process throughout the week, while the other option would be to kill 2 cows and have the cats and chicken share the food.  If this was the case, how many days till the food supply would run dry?\n10 chicken will eat a combined total of 34/4 = <<34/4=8>>8 cats a day\n6 cats to 8 chicken will equate to 1 cat to 1 chicken which is 2/7 = <<2/7=0.285>>0.285 to 1 chicken will eat a cat daily\nThe farmer is down to 3 cats and 4 chicken while considering how to feed his bird\nEvery day the chicken need 0.285 cats or 2/9", "answer": "B: buy"}

{"idx": 996, "text": "A is 'tenacity'.  The man set the cup but didn't throw anything onto the table.\nH is an abbreviation for hands, so it excludes A.  D is the only one of the options which is a verb, so it's the only one which wouldn't be considered for the man to lack.\nThe 'he' in the sentence is the man, and he was not in a position to heave anything onto the table, only the man set it there.  The man's lacking anything or having anything to balance it in the sense of his failing to act, but his actions alone put it there.\nThe 'coaster' is not an option, because it is not an adjective, although it could be a noun.\nE excludes D because the man did not break the cup.\nThe man's 'tenacity' is that he succeeded in setting the cup on the table, while 'hands' refers to physical means, and'skill' refers to a special knack at it which the man did not possess.\nSo the final answers are tenacity and yes\n\nInput:It was 8:00 when he first saw his neighbor, and it was still 8:00 by the time he finally left. Did he stay longer than intended?  I know, there's a 12-hour option too, but I'm sure the answer is yes.\nOutput: We need to know the time when he finally left. Let the time when he finally leaves be denoted by x. If it is at 800 then by the time he finally leaves at 8:00, he has already stayed for 2 hours or 2 * 60 * 60. (2 hours = 120 minutes)\nSince he was not planning to stay for that much time, he stayed longer than he intends.\nSo the final the answer is yes\n\nInput: Let 'I' refer to the total amount in your bank account.

Let's just say we have n coats = n dogs.\nAfter each dog has one coat, there will be (n-1) dogs left.\nAdditionally, we have m coats = m-1 dogs, where m is a constant.\nThen, dividing each side of the equation by (m-1), we can conclude that after each dog has one coat we will be left with 1/(m-1) = (n-1)/(m-1) coats.\nSo after each dog only has one coat, we have (n-1)/m coats.\nSo the final equation is n coats = m - 1, where m = \"the number of coats decreasing at the same rat as the number of dogs\".", "answer": "C: friend's house"}

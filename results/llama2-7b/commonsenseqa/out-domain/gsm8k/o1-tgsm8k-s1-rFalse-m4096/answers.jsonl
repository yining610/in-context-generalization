{"idx": 125, "text": "E\n```\n\n### Solution:\n\nUsing the `Breadth-First Search` method, we can solve this. Note that every page of Mary's journal uses 6 stickers and that 100% (total number of stickers / number of stickers to a page) in every case is 6. So if you find the total number of remaining stickers, you can subtract the stickers required for a page from the total number of remaining sticker.\n\nLet us first find the total number of stickers needed to complete all pages. Mary needs 83 pages. So the total number stickers needed to complete the all pages are:\n\n83 * 55 = 4,673 stickers\n\nWe know that there are total number of remaining stikers = stickers needed - stickers provided. We can easily find the total number of pages Mary can finish:\n\n4,673 - 3 = 4670\n\nWe already have the number of pages required for a page. So if i had to find the total number of stikers remained for the final page, I can say:\n\ntotal no of pages - (page stickers) = 0(cause we already calculated 0 page stickers) +1 = stikers for the final page\n\nWe have to find the total no of stickers remaining. So simply put,\n\nStickers provided + pages required + pages total - pages sticker = number of stickers remaining", "answer": "D: lap"}

By how much does the length exceed the width? answer in inches\nOutput:3\n## Description:\n### What we're doing is computing the percentage in the denominator for the fraction and we keep track of the absolute value for the difference between the numerator and denominator. Since the denominator is the amount of times the percentage shows up in the denominator we simply keep track of the amount of times it shows up in the denominators denominator\n### This question will be using three equations that we'll have to solve for:\n1. The absolute value of `n`: The percentage of the original number that is left which will be called `n`\n2. The Absolute value of `d`: The difference between the numbers before we reduce and after we reduce. `d` will be negative unless the value was greater than 0 and less than 1\n3. `den`: The denominator on the fraction which will be positive. If the denominator value of the fraction is not a whole number it will have a decimal value\n\n### Sample Input:\n2.5 / 6\nOutput:6.66\n\n### Sample Output:\n51 / 20 => 2.5 => -1.54 => abs(2.5) = 2.5 => 51 / 2.5 => Answer", "answer": "C: injury"}

But I think I was just going about it backwards; instead of writing two different, more specific methods that would check the numbers against 3 (to check if each item was there or not) I should\u2019ve just written one function that can check each number against 3.  (In terms of the \u201cif\u201d statements in my code)  So what I want to do, is that I would compare each number in my \u201cnumbers\u201d list (which will include every number in the array after the first 3 numbers) to the total number of items (which is the last number/number of items).  After the function goes through the number list, I want it to be able to give me the difference between those two numbers.  Then, that number will be  able to be used for other parts of the program (such as my \u201cif\u201d statements)", "answer": "E: grocery store"}

Be precise and explain your reasoning.\n\nThis can happen if the program reads in a value bigger than the capacity which means that it will take too many stickers which in turn will result in a large number of remaining stickers since only the remaining amount of stickers have been used and there for no stickers left.\n\n### Question :\n\n#Why does this work for the \"sleep in while cmping\" question? Why doesn't it work for the other questions?\n\nThe first program that answers correctly checks if the value of the question which is A here is in the list.

However, in the other questions, the program doesn't know which question to jump to.\n\n### Comments:\n\n#What things did you find challenging about programming this exercise?\nI wasn't able to print out the large amount of remaining stickers but that was because I can't print out the string'stickers' as a variable.

They face issues like:\n\n- Riot control\n- Stolen cars\n- Arrests\n- Accident investigations\n- 911 assistance\n- Traffic enforcement\n- Searching for a suspect\n \nThese are all tasks that the police department must handle each day. The police face numerous challenges in performing these tasks. To help address these challenges, there are three major police divisions. These divisions are: \n\n1. Criminal Investigations: This division investigates crimes which are serious and in many cases, unsolved. A great deal of attention is often given to solving these crimes because this division is responsible for identifying and getting the right information and resources to solve these types of crimes.\n2. Community Policing: This division is responsible for the majority of patrolling officers. Community Policing patrols specific areas of the city such as: \n\n```\n * A section of town where a crime wave is occurring\n * A specific precinct in the department which has high amounts of crime\n * An area that is identified as needing a high concentration of police officers\n```\nEach Community Police officer has a beat which may cover a wide area. They are also called patrol officers and patrol their designated area. \n3. Intelligence: This division is responsible to determine new crimes and their frequency in the city. Many times, intelligence information and data is used to better identify areas in the city that are unsafe or crime prone. Intelligence also gathers information on trends in organized crimes. The data gathered by intelligence is an important element in helping to solve crimes.\n\n#### 1.

Then for every new page we subtract 7 stickers. \nWe know that the numbers of stickers on left pages and front of journal has to be 3 and every other page number is 7.So the number must be divisible by 7.So we choose the number that is divisible by 7: 1,5,11,15,21,25,29,35,39,41,43 And 59.\nThen we choose the odd number 33.\nIn the output we see the number 10.\n\nSo the answer is 10\n```", "answer": "B: hall"}

You can tell the how many stickers do you count by using set and sum.\n\n![Set Sum][2]\n\n\nHow many stickers do you have remaining you can use a combination or permutation to calculate, but I will choose another method, if you still wanna use combination or permutation, you can just look at my second example how do you calculate.\n\n\nLet say, the total number of the large stickers is x.  The total number of small stickers is y. We know Mary use 3 large stickers, so the numbers of \"large sticker\" is 3, the numbers or \"small sticker\" is y+9, x = 89 => y = 86. If you only want to know the numbers of \"large stickers\" but you don't want to count the number of \"small stickers\", then what we need to do is, use the first function and set, but when you use the second function to get the remaining number, it will increase by the first method, we should not consider them.\n\nLet say, I have 15 stickers. I used the three large stickers, there are left with the large sticker, but there is also 5 small sticker left. How can I only 3 large stickers remain, but also left 5 small sticker, in conclusion 8 large stickers and five small stickers. So I divide 15 to 18, and then you have 3 large stickers with 5 small sticker. So I subtract 18 to get 3 left stickers, which is the result.\n\nIn this way, if you want to know how much left sticker you have, first you need to count how much stickers do you have, then use the second function in set to get how much remain.\n\n![Set Subtract][3]\n\nThe second example, emotions lead to happiness, sadness, etc. You need to tell the probability that get this", "answer": "C: happiness"}

{"idx": 336, "text": "stable\n\n### Solution: \n#### Challenge 1:\nIn my solution I made 89 the start number which is Mary's starting point. I used the 89 as the loop condition but I also subtracted it to see how many is left. I used IF to add and subtract to see what was left. I used IF because the user might type it twice into the code so it will say if it matches to then tell them the sticker amount left. \n```Blocks\nlet sticker = 89;\n  while sticker > 0\n  {\n      sticker = sticker - 3 - 7;\n    //I added 3 to the 89 and subtracted 3 to make my sticker amount equal to 80 and then i did that again and made it equal to 47 and added 7 in because those choices the user choose. I made the code while loop and the sticker was the loop condition and the sticker = changed the amount.\n  let sticker;\n    if(sticker == 44)\n  {\n      //The user input was 44 and in the if statement which was if sticker equals 44 it will tell the user. If it doesn't match the loop will run until it equals 44.\n  }\n  }\n ```\n\n### Challenge 2:\nI typed the challenge question for this challenge instead.

The odd number is simply the difference of an even number and 1.\n\nso to say, the even number contains all the odd numbers by a little bit extra.\n\nso what we need to do now is to find the even number to which this number could belong. We know what the difference between 0 and 1 is, which is 1. We dont know what 0 and 1 are. what we do know however is that they fit the description of an even number. \n\nSo how do we come up with their value? Well, to find the answer to the above, we use one of our favorite methods - elimination. We eliminate the even number which are below 10 and see where it fits.\n\nWe have our answer: 2.\n\nLet's dive in here!\n\n\n#### Instructions:1\n \nWhich choice of input data will match the equation below?\n\n4 * n = 48\nn = 12", "answer": "A: television"}

{"idx": 988, "text": "A\n\n**Problem 1:**\nLet\u2019s count our way through this problem and solve it.  We will do this a page at a time.\n\nIf we start on page 6,  we have 7 stickers for that page alone.  Let\u2019s add 3 for the front \nand we get 10 stickers for page 6.\n\nNow let\u2019s go the 2nd page.  For the front, we have 3 large stickers remaining and 10 stickers \nto 2 pages.  Thus, 1 page has to get 5 stickers.  The remaining stickers can be either side.  Let\u2019s \nsay we put 1 sticker on one side.  Then the 5 stickers given to the 2nd page can also be split between \n2 sides if we want which gives us 2.5 so we now have to have 2.5 on one side plus a 5 on the other \nso we now have a total of 7.5 so far.\n\nThen for the 3rd we have to make up for a loss of 10/86 so we have to make up 10/65, which is 1.5.\n\nIt repeats this exact same issue all the way until you get to the back page.  Then the rest is a \ngiven as only 7 left which is 3 for the front and 4 for the rest of the journal.\n\nSo we solved it by thinking about our situation and figuring out how many we had to give \nfor each page until we got to 0 stickers.\n\n**Problem 2**\nI really don\u2019t know this kind of stuff but \nI\u2019m going to give you an idea that I think \nis important: \n\nIn the problem we can use the \u201cif x then y\u201d statement.  \n\nI don\u2019t have a good feeling on this problem but here\u2019s an example:\nIf clouded is (A or B or C or D or E), \nthen it will be cold.\n\nI am trying to figure it out but the whole idea of conditional statement is a bit lost on me.  \nI have one more day with this and I hope, I can figure it out.", "answer": "E: wet"}

Here is an example:  \nCongratulations, you have figured out what is missing in the previous exercise.  You need to add or subtract the value to  get the right answer. \nYou will write a function (code) that gives a user the next number in the sequence.  (ie if the user guesses 5, the program gives the next number in the series, in this case 6)\n\nThis script is only available for Python.\n\nThe user will ask a question.  The program should ask the user what number comes next.\n\nI have created the test cases for you.  See the input and output in the code. \nFeel free to print the correct number if you prefer.  You can also ask the user to print the correct number.\n\n* Test cases: 1-14\n\n* Questions: 1-8\n\n* Test Case 5:\n\nGiven the values, the answer would be 4.11 because the difference is 0.11 between 4 and 5\n* Test Case 8:\n\nThe user entered 4. However, the correct answer was 4.00 The 1 represents 1/10th.\n\nPart 2) Write a separate Python program that writes an if-else condition.\n\nThe program should ask a user for a number.  If the number entered is greater than 10, then the program should print \"Your number is too low.\" If the number entered is less than 10, ask the user for a number again, and continue until", "answer": "A: prison"}

Since we start counting at 5 and then at 4 and then at 3 and so on, if we get to the final number and the sum of this number is 11 then we can say that these numbers are consecutive, with the final number being the first number in the array.  So the method should return consecutive when the sum of the two numbers is 2.  \n\n##Instruction:Write a method countRepeated that returns the number of numbers in an array that are repeated values.\n\nInput: 2,4,4,6,6\n\nOutput: 1\n\nInstruction: Write a method to test whether or not an array has repeated values.\n\nExplanation:: In this method, we define two functions to count a number of repeated values and if a number is repeated or not. When we check if an element is repeated or not, we compare it to the next element and if the same element arises then it is repeated else it is not. The algorithm to implement this method is counting each element and in the if loop checking whether the current element is repeated or not. If it is repeated then it will return true else false. If it is repeated, we just need to add it to the array of repeated elements.\n##Instructions Write a method countsRepeated that iterates an array to count the highest consecutive number repeated in the sequence. \nExplanation: If an array has only 4 numbers a is defined for each number and each number added to the a array, the array of a is the array that is searched for the highest consecutive numbers. \n\n# Instruction: Write a method that allows you to test if an array is ordered, in order,\n\nExplanation : If an array has only sequential values then the method checks if the array has sequential elements then it is ordered.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Mary had 89 stickers.  She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: 44<n><n>Input:Where is a tabby cat likely to be happiest? Choices:  A: box B: home C: alley D: lap E: barn<n>Output:		E<n>```<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>Using the `Breadth-First Search` method, we can solve this. Note that every page of Mary's journal uses 6 stickers and that 100% (total number of stickers / number of stickers to a page) in every case is 6. So if you find the total number of remaining stickers, you can subtract the stickers required for a page from the total number of remaining sticker.<n><n>Let us first find the total number of stickers needed to complete all pages. Mary needs 83 pages. So the total number stickers needed to complete the all pages are:<n><n>83 * 55 = 4,673 stickers<n><n>We know that there are total number of remaining stikers = stickers needed - stickers provided. We can easily find the total number of pages Mary can finish:<n><n>4,673 - 3 = 4670<n><n>We already have the number of pages required for a page. So if i had to find the total number of stikers remained for the final page, I can say:<n><n>total no of pages - (page stickers) = 0(cause we already calculated 0 page stickers) +1 = stikers for the final page<n><n>We have to find the total no of stickers remaining. So simply put,<n><n>Stickers provided + pages required + pages total - pages sticker = number of stickers remaining<n>

But I think I was just going about it backwards; instead of writing two different, more specific methods that would check the numbers against 3 (to check if each item was there or not) I should’ve just written one function that can check each number against 3.  (In terms of the “if” statements in my code)  So what I want to do, is that I would compare each number in my “numbers” list (which will include every number in the array after the first 3 numbers) to the total number of items (which is the last number/number of items).  After the function goes through the number list, I want it to be able to give me the difference between those two numbers.  Then, that number will be  able to be used for other parts of the program (such as my “if” statements)<n>

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Mary had 89 stickers.  She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: 44<n><n>Input:What do horses do to get energy? Choices:  A: eat grass B: play C: kept in stables D: dominated E: drink coffee<n>Output:		A: eat grass <n><n>### Solution:<n><n>First of all, we need to understand, how is the question formatted?<n><n>In this case, the question consists of numbers and one word. The numbers refer to the remaining stickers. The question consists of'remaining'. We can know what do those numbers refer to from the sentences or the instructions. If we know the answer, we can easily solve.<n><n>In the second example, we may guess the pattern. The sentence structure are like : 'What do horses...'.<n><n>We can notice that when there are 2 cases where answer choice A are used, they are likely to be incorrect.<n><n>Another case, if we think they refer to the same sentence we should use a different number as the remaining words,  like A and D. <n><n>In that case, we need to look back to where those phrases are used, we can find the difference between the question we answer and the one before.<n><n>### Sample Question and Solution<n><n>Input: What do horses do to get enough energy to run? Choices: A: eating grass, B: playing, C: kept in stablies, D: dominated, E: drinking coffee<n>Output:  A: eating grass

So if the answer is yes then the block will be executed<n><n>In the second problem I thought of adding them all the answers for each choice to all my possible inputs, but I don't think there is a way to put the answer as a input, so I took separate integer variables for each choice and then incremented the counts correspondingly in a for loop<n><n>In the third one I realized that I can check each choice one by one in a for loop then put their answers in conditional block. Which is exactly what I did in all other problems, and this one is not my strongest one.<n><n>

Community Policing: This division is responsible for the majority of patrolling officers. Community Policing patrols specific areas of the city such as: <n><n>```<n> * A section of town where a crime wave is occurring<n> * A specific precinct in the department which has high amounts of crime<n> * An area that is identified as needing a high concentration of police officers<n>```<n>Each Community Police officer has a beat which may cover a wide area.

Then create a text file within the inputs folder and name it inputs.py.<n>Write the contents of inputs_02.txt in the content of the file, inputs.csv.<n>```bash<n>git open_folder02 <n>```<n>You will find a new notepad within your file.<n>#### # Note:The notepad is created at the same directory on which you have run the git clone command.<n>```bash<n>open Notepad<n>```<n>Write the contents of the file inputs/inputs.txt in the content that is displayed in the text file in notepad. <n>It is recommended to use a blank space at the end of each line, so that the csv.read function in the required function can properly parse the string.<n>```bash<n>python scripts/int02.py<n>```<n><n>## Step 3: Importing modules<n>Create another folder named "data" in the same folder as inputs folder, but before you do that, you will require importing pandas and time related modules to your code.<n>```bash<n>#pip install pandas<n>import pandas as pd<n>#pip install python-date<n>import dateutil.parser as dt<n>```<n><n><n>## Step 4: Write code for checking time<n><n>After importing these libraries, we need to check if the time input is of correct format. Hence, we need to utilise the datetime library. We need to first import this library in our code.<n><n>

How do I handle the "If statement" questions: I know that the value of 'a' is 'false' and the value of 'b' is 'true. I can answer Yes or No for 'if' statements and I can also use a 'for' loop to iterate to the next part of the question after I get a yes to the 'if' statement. I am just not sure what to do from there for the final value.<n>2. How do I handle an 'add' problem question that does not include an integer. I know that the value 'x' will never equal 'y' but I am not sure how to translate that into python.<n>3. How do I handle when the Question asks for a 'nonsquared' term, which I understand means a number that is not the square of another number. The answer is 7/9.<n>4. I am not sure in which direction to go with all of the 'less than or equal to' problems.<n>

You can tell the how many stickers do you count by using set and sum.<n><n>![Set Sum][2]<n><n><n>How many stickers do you have remaining you can use a combination or permutation to calculate, but I will choose another method, if you still wanna use combination or permutation, you can just look at my second example how do you calculate.<n><n><n>Let say, the total number of the large stickers is x.  The total number of small stickers is y. We know Mary use 3 large stickers, so the numbers of "large sticker" is 3, the numbers or "small sticker" is y+9, x = 89 => y = 86. If you only want to know the numbers of "large stickers" but you don't want to count the number of "small stickers", then what we need to do is, use the first function and set, but when you use the second function to get the remaining number, it will increase by the first method, we should not consider them.<n><n>Let say, I have 15 stickers. I used the three large stickers, there are left with the large sticker, but there is also 5 small sticker left. How can I only 3 large stickers remain, but also left 5 small sticker, in conclusion 8 large stickers and five small stickers. So I divide 15 to 18, and then you have 3 large stickers with 5 small sticker. So I subtract 18 to get 3 left stickers, which is the result.<n><n>In this way, if you want to know how much left sticker you have, first you need to count how much stickers do you have, then use the second function in set to get how much remain.<n><n>![Set Subtract][3]<n><n>The second example, emotions lead to happiness, sadness, etc. You need to tell the probability that get this

Choices:  A: meat grinder B: stable C: red barn D: gate E: green field<n>Output:		stable<n><n>### Solution: <n>#### Challenge 1:<n>In my solution I made 89 the start number which is Mary's starting point. I used the 89 as the loop condition but I also subtracted it to see how many is left. I used IF to add and subtract to see what was left. I used IF because the user might type it twice into the code so it will say if it matches to then tell them the sticker amount left. <n>```Blocks<n>let sticker = 89;<n>  while sticker > 0<n>  {<n>      sticker = sticker - 3 - 7;<n>    //I added 3 to the 89 and subtracted 3 to make my sticker amount equal to 80 and then i did that again and made it equal to 47 and added 7 in because those choices the user choose. I made the code while loop and the sticker was the loop condition and the sticker = changed the amount.<n>  let sticker;<n>    if(sticker == 44)<n>  {<n>      //The user input was 44 and in the if statement which was if sticker equals 44 it will tell the user. If it doesn't match the loop will run until it equals 44.<n>  }<n>  }<n> ```<n><n>### Challenge 2:<n>I typed the challenge question for this challenge instead. I used the choice variable and the IF statement. I used an Else if condition to add the other choices and to run an ELSE because I want it to say something when they say incorrect.<n>```Blocks<n><n>Input: The cow would come outside even  AFTER the storm had passed, IT would not leave the _____.  Choices:  A) meat grinder B) stable C) red barn D) gate E) green field<n> <n> Output: stable<n>```<n><n>

I created three functions to do this, the first function gets the number of pages, and the amount of stickers each one receives. The second function is to get how many you have left once you remove ones used already. This is by subtracting the amount of pages that are subtracted by the amount of stickers. Once you do this for each page you subtract the new amount of stickers your with once you deduct each of the used pages. Then finally you will add the 89 that you had and subtract the total you are left with, this way you can determine if it is correct or not.<n><n>### Code:<n>#include <stdio.h><n>#include <stdlib.h><n><n>int main (){<n>	int pages,amount,i,j,remainder;<n>	do{<n>			printf("Enter the number of pages in a journal: ");<n>			scanf("%d",&pages);<n>	}while(pages<=0 || pages>257);<n>	<n>	<n>	for(i=0;i<=pages;i++){<n>		<n>			if(i==0) amount = 2;<n>			else if (i==1) amount = 7;<n>			<n>		do{<n>	<n>			printf("\nEnter the amount of stickers given to the first page: " );<n>			scanff("%d",&amount[0]);<n>		}while((amount[0]<0)||(amount[0]>2))<n><n>		do{		<n>		<n>	printf("\nEnter how many stickers given to page number \n");<n>	scanff("%d %d", &pages, &i);<n>			do{	<n>				if (((pages)[0]<0) || (pages[0]>2)  ) amount = 0;<n>				else amount = (amount[0]*(pages[0])); <n>	<n>		} while (amount < 0)<n>}<n><n>			do {<n>				printf("\t\t%d x %d = %d \n",amount, (

Choices:  A: water B: liquid C: foamy D: intoxicating E: harmful<n>Output:		D<n><n><n>Solution: A) You want to store the answers as an array, and to do that you can't use strings. To use a string, you need to use the string literal as an input to the array constructor:<n>```<n>const ans = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'];<n>```<n>You also can't use the input directly to the question variable, which is declared str.<n><n>B) First of all you need to convert both inputs to strings using +. Then you can use an Array.includes to check if the answer is present in the string.<n>```<n>for (let i =0; i < ans.length; i ++) {<n>    if (ans[i] + str.split? ".split()[0]!== answer") {<n>       console.log('Correct')<n>}<n>```<n>

It is easy to tell the age of our animals because each day of their calendar is the same as one of ours. We like to think that all dogs are born on the same day, July 4th (independence day), and that all dogs age at the same rate. As they age, they go from puppies to young dogs to adult dogs to senior dogs and finally to old dogs.  In America, a dog starts off as a senior dog once the sum of their age and the year they were born equals at least 115 or 116. For example, a dog born on July 5, 2000, would be a senior dog on or after July 4, 2016.  What is the next birthday of an American dog.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Mary had 89 stickers.

Choices:  A: plain B: cold C: dull D: bad E: wet<n>Output:		A<n><n>**Problem 1:**<n>Let’s count our way through this problem and solve it.  We will do this a page at a time.<n><n>If we start on page 6,  we have 7 stickers for that page alone.  Let’s add 3 for the front <n>and we get 10 stickers for page 6.<n><n>Now let’s go the 2nd page.  For the front, we have 3 large stickers remaining and 10 stickers <n>to 2 pages.  Thus, 1 page has to get 5 stickers.  The remaining stickers can be either side.  Let’s <n>say we put 1 sticker on one side.  Then the 5 stickers given to the 2nd page can also be split between <n>2 sides if we want which gives us 2.5 so we now have to have 2.5 on one side plus a 5 on the other <n>so we now have a total of 7.5 so far.<n><n>Then for the 3rd we have to make up for a loss of 10/86 so we have to make up 10/65, which is 1.5.<n><n>It repeats this exact same issue all the way until you get to the back page.  Then the rest is a <n>given as only 7 left which is 3 for the front and 4 for the rest of the journal.<n><n>So we solved it by thinking about our situation and figuring out how many we had to give <n>for each page until we got to 0 stickers.<n><n>**Problem 2**<n>I really don’t know this kind of stuff but <n>I’m going to give you an idea that I think <n>is important: <n><n>In the problem we can use the “if x then y” statement.  <n><n>I don’t have a good feeling on this problem but here’s an example:<n>If clouded is (A or B or C or D or E), <n>then it will be cold.<n><n>I am trying to figure it out but the whole idea of conditional statement is a bit lost on me.  <n>I have one more day with this and I hope, I can figure it out.<n>

Choices:  A: population B: populated area C: create government D: group of people E: make person sick<n>Output:		  A<n><n>Explanation:If you go to any site on the internet, you need numbers to identify people (A). <n>## Instruction:Write a method to count consecutive numbers that do not add up to a specific value.<n><n>Input:  5+4+3+2+1<n>Output:  *Consecutive*<n><n>Explanation*:This method will test each number in the array and if it is the previous number or higher in the array then it will return false, otherwise it will return true.  Since we start counting at 5 and then at 4 and then at 3 and so on, if we get to the final number and the sum of this number is 11 then we can say that these numbers are consecutive, with the final number being the first number in the array.  So the method should return consecutive when the sum of the two numbers is 2.  <n><n>##Instruction:Write a method countRepeated that returns the number of numbers in an array that are repeated values.<n><n>Input: 2,4,4,6,6<n><n>Output: 1<n><n>Instruction: Write a method to test whether or not an array has repeated values.<n><n>Explanation:: In this method, we define two functions to count a number of repeated values and if a number is repeated or not. When we check if an element is repeated or not, we compare it to the next element and if the same element arises then it is repeated else it is not. The algorithm to implement this method is counting each element and in the if loop checking whether the current element is repeated or not. If it is repeated then it will return true else false. If it is repeated, we just need to add it to the array of repeated elements.<n>##Instructions Write a method countsRepeated that iterates an array to count the highest consecutive number repeated in the sequence. <n>Explanation: If an array has only 4 numbers a is defined for each number and each number added to the a array, the array of a is the array that is searched for the highest consecutive numbers. <n><n># Instruction: Write a method that allows you to test if an array is ordered, in order,<n><n>Explanation : If an array has only sequential values then the method checks if the array has sequential elements then it is ordered.

Your code will read from line 1 to line n (where n is the line where your inputs end) and print the numbers to the console. Please see the example in the questions.\n\nFor example, If the input number is 23 (which is 42 + 42/2). Your code should print out an output number of 20.\n\nYour code should read the input number, input the math formula, and print out the solution to the math formula, which should be in the same way of input (that is the same way of calculating multiplication)\n\n## Part 2.\n\nHere is example of the problems to solve, and the formula for solving them.

Here is how I completed them:\n\n1. I used this approach with the initial 66 candies where each of them contain 7 pieces. The difference between the 2 numbers should be 8. If we call the initial number 66, the final number should be 72.\n\n2. Using the approach above I calculated that Freddy spent 6 times more money for calling his family and I calculated the initial stock of 600 and then the difference between the numbers should be 100, which is 7 for each side, therefore, I concluded that Freddy spent 20 dollars.\n\n3. This was another easy question where I assumed that the difference between these two numbers is 7. Then I looked for an even number and came to this conclusion, where I calculated an array of answers (and then calculated the difference between each and the initial number) where the first numbers that made the difference between them was the initial number minus 7 and then the next number subtracted 7 again and added 1, and so forth. I made calculations for this approach, but I didn't like it since it may take more than 1 try.\n\n4. This one was a little difficult since it mixed things up a little bit, but I also tried this approach with a small array and got closer. I also started with the original number of birds, and I subtracted 1 for each side and then added an additional number of eggs so that it was even. However, it ended up that there weren't enough eggs of eggs, so it ended up that the difference between both numbers was 15. This conclusion was correct.\n\n5. This question can be accomplished with a similar technique that I used for the 2nd question with the stock of candy. The difference between the two sides is", "answer": "C: new hampshire"}

Then use div by 10 to convert this number to a float.\n\nWhen the number reaches 16, there is a possibility for the number to change into a negative. This method can detect it, so the value of x should not exceed to 16.\n\nFinally, use if to distinguish the result value and then print it out.\n\nFor example:\n\n![example 1](example1.png)\n\n```python\nnum = float(input(\"\"))\ntotal = 0\n\nif num<16:\n    result = total + num\nelse:\n    result = len(\"\".join(str(int(n)) for n in str(num)))\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\n## Solution 2:\n\nIf we only deal with number input, we can divide it into three cases.\n\nCase 1: The number is smaller than 20\n\nCase 2: The number is greater than 20 and smaller than 30\n\nCase 3: The number is greater 30 and smaller than 40\n\nCase 4: The number is less than 20", "answer": "E: laundry room"}

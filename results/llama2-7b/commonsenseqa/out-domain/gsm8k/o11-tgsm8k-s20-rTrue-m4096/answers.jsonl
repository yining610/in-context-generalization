However, the new principal had no experience being a principal and spent most of the year complaining about the students and teachers.  The school decided to enforce even more strict rules on the students. They had hoped to encourage more positive behavior from the students, but many didn't understand the rationale behind the rules.  The students rebelled and started a petition to have the principal fired.  How successful was the school in encouraging positive behavior from the students?

Five books are left behind. If one of the people borrowed two books, six more books can be borrowed. How many books can be borrowed now?\nOutput: We first have to figure out how many books were left in order to make 6 more books.\nWe know one is borrowed and 6 books can be borrowed, leaving 8 books.\nWe then use the equation (1+2+5)-(8/5)-(2/3) = 8/5 or 8*(5)/(5*5) = 2, as one person borrowed 2, so 8 books left, 2 borrowed, 1 left.\nThat leaves: 1 * 8/5 = 4.\nSo, if one borrowed 2, this leaves 4 books so there are 4 left to borrow at a library with 23 total.\nSo the final answers should be 1 and 4.\n\nInput: How long will it take for the blue marble and the red marble to collide?\nBlue marble starts at (-1,0) and travels at -2 units per second.\nRed marble starts at (-2, -3) and travels at +2 units per second. \nAt what point will the two marbles collide?\nOutput: Blue marble starts at (-4,-5) so it takes it 4 seconds to get to (-3,-6) and then it takes 6 seconds to get to its collision with the red marble.\n\nThis is the blue marble.\n\nNow this is the red marble.  \nThey both start at (-2,-3)\n\nThe blue marble starts at (-6,-5) and should take it 4 seconds to reach (-3,-6) from there, but it will take 6 seconds to reach its collision with the red\nmarble, so the total collision time is 10 seconds.", "answer": "C: synagogue"}

Choices:  Divide remainder by 2.  Add remainder to its double.  Divide remainder by its double.  Check the remainder of 19/2.\nOutput: Since none of the choices satisfy the wording of the question, your best bet is to use logic.\nSince 19/2 is an integer, we may divide it by its reciprocal.\nSince 12.5 is the integer part of 19/3, the integer part of 2/19 may be 2/12.5.\nBy the Division Algorithm, for any (a,b) and (c,d),\ndivide a by b in the same way as c by d, if the remainder of a divided by b in exactly the same remainder as c divided by d. Thus in the present case, 12.5/2 == 6/9, and 6/9 == 2/3.\nThus the remainder of 12.5 divide by 2 is the same remainder of 6 / 9, and 6 / 9 is the same remainder of (6 - 12.5) / (9 - 3), which is 2/3 = 0.666...\nSince 1/3 is the integer part of (2/3) or (12.5/40)\n666666.6666... is divisible by 4 and remainder 0.1666... is not.\nSo the final remainder is 0.\n\nInput:There are two groups of people.

What is the least number of donuts that can be sold at the price of 10 cents per donuts that won't deplete the ingredients?\nOutput: So, a way to solve this would be to solve for x by isolating it from all 3 of the other variables (x, A, B).\nIsolate x from B, A, and C by multiplying C by 5 to get 5c\nSubtract 5c from each side, and you get 4c = <<4c=12>>\nDivide both sides by 2 to get x= <<x=6>>\nAdd 6 to each side to get 7 = <<7=3>>\nMultiply that number by 6 to get 42 would be the final answer\n\nInput: There will be 11 members of the choir for a local band competition.

As part of their preparation they were discussing the solution of integrals.  The boys had an equation x(x+a)^3=a^3(x+a)^(-1) The boys needed to simplify the fraction by combining like terms. After one boy decided the denominator needed to contain \"a\", the other boy responded, \"You can't divide by zero. The numerator in the denominator can't be negative (it's greater than zero). What you need to do is solve for \"a\" by multiplying both the numerator and denominator in order to remove the denominator (the \"a\" term) from the equation.\" The final answer was that \"one needs to perform a square root of both sides of the equation to get an expression not involving the term \"a\". One could then substitute in an expression or function that did not contain \"a\" as a denominator or as a coefficient in the expression. The boy had to remember that when performing square roots, the denominator is the radicand and the result is the answer raised to the power of half of the number of terms in the square root. For instance, 2 should be square rooted to get 2^2 / 2^0.25 which is 2.\nOutput: The correct answer is E, Internet cafe\nSo the final answer was choose E\n\n#Input 2, [\n  [  'Answer the following multiple choice q',  ['Input number in string format','4', 'Input a variable name', 'x', 'Calculate a summation',  '1+2']],\n  [ 'Input a variable name','x', 'Calculate the perimeter','4+8+12+16+20+24'],\n  [ 'Input 2 numbers to add together.','9','Add these numbers together.','19'],\n  [ 'How many hours work per day on Monday, Tue, Fri and Sat?','6','What was her total', '316'],\n  [ 'What was his total?','-7','How many hours for his total?', '151'],\n  ['How many hours for his grand total?

What is the maximum number of cards left for the woman to win?\nOutput:Answers: B-4C-2\nB- 2 of each suit will still be left, so it won't work.\nC- There are two ways of doing the math, either using addition or subtraction to keep track of the numbers. Since the man deals out 10 cards per deal and the woman deals out 5 cards per deal, the man will get more chances to deal than the woman.\nThis would mean that the last deal would go to 4 cards for the man and 1 card for the woman. The man won the last hand, and the woman lost.\nBut, if the woman deals out each hand, then she will get a more equal number of chances. She will deal out all the cards, so she will be playing with 36 cards. She will have 34 cards left because she only won 6 cards from the last hand. She will win the last hand because she deals 34:1.\nThus, in the scenario where the woman deals the cards, the last hand will be played with 24 cards for the man vs the 34 cards for the woman.\nThus, the man has to use 12 cards, and woman has to use 21 to win.\nSo the final answers are A:C-2 and B:4\n#!/bin/bash\nclear\n# Prompt the user to type two variables representing the number of birds in each nest:\necho \"How many birds in the first nest? \"\nread numberbirdsfirstnest\necho \"How many bids in the second nest? \"\nread birdsinsecondnest\necho \"Calculate the total number of birds in the nests.\"\necho\necho \"Birds in the 1st Nest \" $numberbirdsfirstnest\n\necho \"Bird in the 2nd nest \" $birdsinsecondnest\necho\n\n\n# echo:\n# echo:\n## Number of bird in the nest 1=input for first nest\n# # of birds=echo the birds in the", "answer": "B: pass time"}

It took Tina five hours to read the same book. If Jenny can read at the same rate as Tina, how long will it take Jenny to finish the book?\nOutput: Jenny and Tina can read the book together at the same time since when they read the book in one hour they read the book at the same rate.\nSo Jenny will finish the same book in one hour less than she already read.  so she will have to read the book in 1 - 1 = <<1-1=0>>0 minutes. Now we subtract from an hour. we subtract 1 from an hour. since Tina can read 5 minutes but Jenny now can in 1 less she can read 5 - 1 = 4 minutes now. since Jenny and Tina just finished the book.\nJenny can read 5 -1 = <<5-1=4>>4 minutes\nSo the final answer Jenny has a new time of 1+4 = <<1+4=5>>5 minutes\n\nInput: Alyssa can clean her dorm in 25 minutes.

The train then leaves the station and proceeds to the next station (the station where the train is unloading people) at 20 km/hr. At every station, 1500 people get off, go to a store, and then return in 15 minutes. How long before the train is empty?\nOutput: The train starts at the station where passengers arrive and goes with speed of 20km/h to the station where passengers are getting on at speed 20km/hr.\nPeople are getting on with 1500. The train is full with 2000 people. The train needs to stop 2 times at the stations where passengers are getting off until the train is empty: after 20 stations the train will stop for the 3rd last time (passengers leaving). After 15 stations passengers leave in 1:30.\nSo the train stops for the 3rd time after 35 stations from where the train begins. To the 4th time it stops after 50 stations. That means that train needs to stop 70 stations for 13 passengers to get off: 15 stations in where passengers leave + 3 times when the train is full + 3 times when passengers are getting off).\nTo the 4th stop train stops to 70 stations. Total it takes to reach the last stop is: stops = 4 (4 stops before passengers get off) +13 (13 passengers stopping for 2 times) = 17 stops + 13 (13", "answer": "B: happiness"}

Suppose that 32% of these cars are SUVs and that they travel at 85 km/h.  An SUV uses 17% more fuel than each non-SUV.  A 4 l/100 km car is driving 10,050 km from Montreal, QC to St. John\u2019s, NL and will fill its tank 14 times at different filling stations. If non-SUVs are 84.5% of the cars on this highway, how much more fuel is this car using than one of the same class?\nOutput: We need to figure out how much fuel will be used if non-SUVs were the majority.  We add up the number of vehicles and then multiply them by their usage (which we don't know).  Note that the first two options are exactly the same, because the cars travel at the same pace.  When we multiply by the percentages, we get the actual usage value.  The numbers don't line up because the \"with SUVs\" calculation only had cars using the full amount.  The \"without SUVs\" calculation had a few extra cars using that fuel.\nWith SUVs:\n104230 *.5\n= 52115\n\nWithout SUVs:\n    49954 * 1.8 (10,00 + (1.0 *.032) * 1.5 + 1.6)\n= 90502\n\nSo the final answer would be that a non-SUV car will use 36.42% (=90502/243739 * 100) or just over a third more than a car with an SUV.\n\nInput: What country is this?

When would it be safe to breed a male dog that would not get bigger than 45 pounds?\nOutput: You want to breed a big and strong dog.\nA full-grown female dog grows to about 30 percent of its male counterpart's weight.\nMale dogs can be 25 percent heavier than females -- for example, 44 pounds, 7 ounces for a 55-pound female.\nYou only have to take into consideration dogs that reach 25 pounds, because all dogs would be too small in your case, so all your dogs should be over 25 pounds.\nIn order to not go over 45 pounds, the full-grown male dogs should weigh 20 percent more. In this case, 45 pounds, 7 2 / 3 ounces = <<45*2=90>>90 pounds. That means that the full grown male dog in your case should not be larger than 90 pounds. So it's safe to breed once the dog is over 90 pounds.\nSo the final ans is :90\n\nInput: How many numbers must be tested to find the first odd Fibonacci number that is divisible by 7?\nOutput: All Fibonacci numbers must be divisible by 7, so the first odd divisible by 7 number will be F7 = <<F7=34>>34.\nThus the answer is:\nF7 / 7 = <<F7/7=34/7=4.67>> 4.67\nRounded off to the nearest number will be 5, which is the answer.\nSo the final Ans. is : 5\n\nInput : The height of a cashier at a mall store is double that of a receptionist at that same store.

The plane leaves for Chicago leaving seats for 6 passengers. Another 9 passengers come to board the plane. How many of the passengers must remain standing until the plane arrives at it's destination.\nOutput: The plane has a total of 8 seats. Firstly we subtract the seats that are already taken and the ones reserved by the 6 passengers and the 9 passengers, this therefore leaves us with 1 less than 8 which is only one seat. Then I subtracted an extra 1, this because one passenger in the plane had to stand to compensate for the fact that some of the passengers are not sat down in their seat.\nSo now we have 8-6, so we need to find: 8 - (8-6) = 6, therefore: There is 6 spare seats. (8-6)/2 = 1, therefore: 1 passenger has to stand, therefore: 1.\nSo the final answe is 1\n\n\n```\n# Part 1\n# Input: There are 5 apples in a fruit bowl.

We know that S + V >= 5,   but S >= V + 4 (since you need to have 2 vegetarians as a minimum)   So S >= 5 - 5 = 0,    Solving equations: S+V=5, S>=V+4,  Solving for V using the first equation we can write:  V = 5-S (note that V can't be greater than 5 so this is the same as:  V can't be less than 5 - S)\nLet's find how S changes: The first choice only can change V by 1, the rest of the choices can change V only by 2. Since the last choice can only change V by 2 and the first makes V change by 1, after the first change S will have the same value, therefore the other ones can't move S by more than 1. V always changes by 2. And V can't go under 5 S can't go under -1 (-5 - S < -1).

They wanted to split the bill equally, but the bill came to more than $1,000.  How much did the bill cost?\nOutput: Let $$x=1000$$.  The bill amount is $x$, and for it to cost less than $x$ it must either be a multiple of $x/3$ or a multiple of $x(1/3)$ which is the same as a fraction of $1000/3$.  Since $x$ is a multiple of $3$ we can ignore that first possibility.  The next smallest multiple of $x$ is $x/3$, and thus a group of $3$ people ate $x/3=$$x/3=$$333$ dollars which is in fact a multiple of $33$.  Since $33$ is a multiple of 3 and $33\\neq3$ then $33$ is divisible by 3 more than once.  Therefore, $xy=$$1000$ and $x^2=100000/3^2$ which means that $x=1068918.2662145098$ and $y=1.6538970227221577$ which is a ratio of $\\frac{1.6539}{10689.18}$ \nSo each persons' share cost $\\frac{1}{10688918.3}$\n$\\frac{252}{1068518.3}$ = 2.37 dollars = 2423 cents\nSo the final answer dollars = $\\frac{1}{2423}$ = 41.3 cents each", "answer": "D: foot"}

What is the total number of students who have green hair?\nOutput: First, we must find the number of students who have brown hair, brown eyes and green hair and subtract that from the total to find the number of students with green hair only.  That number was 83 + 161 + 114 - 680 = <<83+161+114-680=396>>396\nNext, we subtract 238 = <<238>-396=8 > 196 students have green hair.\nSo, the final answer is 8\n\nInput: In a group of 21 people, exactly half have brown hair and exactly half have blue hair. Of the people with brown hair, 13 have blue eyes and 10 have brown eyes. Of the people with blue hair, 7 have brown eyes and 14 have blue eyes\nOutput:\n\nSince no one has both brown and blue hair, the total number of people who have either brown hair or blue hair:\n21 + 11 (Blue hair)\n- 13 + 10 (Brown hair)\n= 11 - 2 - 1\n= 8 people\nSince there are 11 people with blue hair and only 1 person with blue hair and brown hair, there are 9 people with only blue hair and 12 people with only brown hair.\nSo, of those, 7 people have blue eyes and 9 people have brown eyes so the total number of blue eyes is 16 and the total number of brown eyes is 15.\nSince there are 8 people with brown hair and none with blue, that total number of brown eyes = 13\nSince there are 21 people and 31 total brown eyes for the entire group, the total number of brown hair must have been 16", "answer": "C: winning or losing"}

The answers to these questions will often relate to our solar system, as it is a common question. Mercury and Venus are the two inner planets from Jupiter, so these are the only acceptable answers out of the original five. To go from these to the answer, we know that there are four planets known as inner or terrestrial(Earth) planets due to the fact the mass of these planets is relatively larger than Mars and other outer planets. Knowing that Earth is not the answer, this eliminates these two answers, and provides our final answer of Mars.\nSo the final choose is D.\n\nInput:How long can a car last if its tires are correctly inflated? Choices:  As long as tires are not cracked or punctured\nOutput: The answer choices can give us certain clues, as punctured refers to a hole in a structure, and cracked refers to the breaking or fracturing of it. Punctured and cracked would refer to problems that are more detrimental to the car and may render it unable to function correctly, whereas the answers that only mention properly inflated tires make a more positive impact on the lifespan of these tires. With that in mind, we can assume this question is asking how long a car lasts if the tires are replaced when they need to be.\nDue to the way the question is worded, we would like to choose the answer choice that only refers to the car needing to replace their tires, and not any other issues. We do not need to see that the tires are not cracking or punctured. We also find the answer that says at least ten years. While noting that tires need replaced more often for cars that are older would also qualify, the question specifically states the replacement of tires only, therefore that means it is correct.\nSo the final choise is D\n\nInput: Which is the greatest two-digit number,", "answer": "C: car trunk"}

Three of the race car drivers come from Utah, 3 of the race car drivers came from Kentucky, and there is 1 from Texas. If they were randomly selected, what is the greatest probability of the race drivers coming from Texas, Utah, or Kentucky?\nOutput: Of the 8 people, there are 3 from Utah, 1 from Texas, and 1 from Kentucky. If they were randomly chosen, the probability of choosing a winner from Utah is 3/8. The probability of choosing a loser from Utah is 5/8. Since there is 1 person from Utah winning, the probability is greater that they would lose. For every person who wins, they have a 50% chance of losing. Since there is 3 people from Utah and there is 3 losers, then the probability that the 3 people from Utal will lose is 3(5/8), which is the same as 3*(5/8), or 3*5/8 = 3*7/48, or 3*7/24 = 21/24. The same logic applies for the others as well, so 3*(1/4) + 1*(3/4) + 3*(1/2) = 21/12. The same math is applied for Utah, Kentucky, Texas, and the \"none of the above\" option.\nIf they were randomly picked, then the \"best\" option, or highest probability, would be Texas, since there is 1 from it with a 4/9 probability. Utah has 3 people with a 1/6 probability per person. Texas has 1 person with a 4/8 probability. The next best is Kentucky and Utah, since there is 2 people from it with 2/9 probability per person. Finally, \"none of the above,\" which is just 1 person, has a 1/9 probability\nTexas = 3/8(4/9) = 3/27\n\nUtah = 3/8*(3/12) = 9/24\n\nKentucky = 2/8 (= 2/16)*3/8 = 12/16", "answer": "D: ohio"}

Each player has a different value (10, 40, and 59). The player with the least amount of points starts with the letter A. If more than one players have the same amount of points, they tie for the first letter. Whatever letter the first player has is the first letter of the next player. The game continues to play until each player has a letter. When a player can't use the last letter they receive, it is their turn to go through all of the letters again. When the game starts with A, B and C the players are supposed to go in alphabetical order in which they receive the numbers. The game starts off with A, B, and C and they are each given the value of 10. C gets 40, then B gets 59 (because C gets 40 from their 10, B gets 59 from their 10). C gets B's 49 and B gets C's 40. What letter does each player end up with, and what sum of values is each player given?

You have just completed an example of how to solve multiple choice word problems using recursion. The purpose of this document is to provide you with more insight into different strategies on how to approach different questions or different types of questions.\n\n### Input: Ali has 27 coins in total and he has more pennies than quarters but fewer nickels than dimes. How many pennies does not Ali have?\n**Questions to ask.** \n\n\n## Solution\n### Instruction:Answer the multiple choice question.\nIn questions like this one, which are pretty common, all operations that the user inputs should be checked to make sure they're integers. Otherwise, the result of the operation will be ambiguous.\n\n### Hint:You can easily write a function that accepts the values of the different denominations of coins.\n\n### Solution:Answer the multiple choice word problem.\nThis question is the most typical multiple-choice word problem format. The simplest way of going about this is to write a recursive function where we set n, our base case, equal to the number of coins the user inputs (n equal to the result of user input).\n\nThen, we make a recursive call every time, that our coin value is equal to greater than one. The function starts out with dimes and pennies being equal, the function will go into the dime statement as it is greater", "answer": "E: house"}

The sentence contains \u201cI was on a boat\u201d, the word \u201cI\u201d is on the boat, and it\u2019s at a position on the boat (the ninth position); therefore it is the answer.\n\n\nInput : I wanted her to help me.\n\nOutput:The answer is \u2018she\u2019.

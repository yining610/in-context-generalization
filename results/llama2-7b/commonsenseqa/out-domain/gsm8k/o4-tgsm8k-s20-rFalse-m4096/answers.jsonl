It is also where you will test and debug your questions.\n\nNote that all files in `data/` are considered when importing questions.\n\nIn essence the contest runs as follows:\n\n* The `question-bank.p` file calls all the question files found in `data/question.py`. Each question is then run through various checks to make sure it is well formatted. The questions are organized into subfolders named according to their category.\n\n* Only one question from each of the category subfolders (tested) will be shown to contestants.\n\n\n> If you need to have a question available to contestants at all times you can add it to the category `never_ended`. For performance reasons, the `never_ended/` category will only be searched if no questions from any other categories exist; that is why is always the last category called. If you do add a question to this category you should ensure that it provides a high enough challenge to justify it being always available.\n\n\n**What\u2019s next?**\n\n* **Finish writing the remaining test cases**\n    * Note that any questions imported from files that are neither in the `data/` nor in the `test/` folder will be ignored by the `question-bank.python`\n* Review your source files and remove all whitespace characters that should not appear in your questions; this includes things like comments, empty lines, line endings, etc...\n* Remove the code block for your questions at the bottom of the file. This block is intended for testing purposes only and is not required for use in the contest.\n\n#### \u2753 Can I create my own puzzle?\n\nYes! Of course.

Do not change the instructions!\n\nThere are three people in a room, and their names are FREDDIE, KEVIN and SAM. If FREDDIE\u2019s favorite color is blue, and KEVIN\u2019s favorite color is red, then what color is SAM\u2019s favorite color?\n\nIf a king is not in the room, then he is probably talking to his queen. However, if FREDDIE is in the room, then his queen is probably KEVIN. In turn, if there is a queen, then she is probably talking to her king. However, if a queen is the favorite color of a FREDDIE, then her king is probably KEVIN, who is probably talking to his FREDDIE. Thus, if KEVIN is in the room, the person who is probably next to him is FREDDIE. If FREDDIES are not in the room, but KEVIN is, the person who is most likely next to him is SAM.\nAnswer: SAM\n\nIf there is a queen, and she is not talking to the king she loves, she is either talking to her daughter or her father-in-law. If her daughter is the favorite color of FREDDIE, she is talking to her father-in-laws. If her father-in-laps is red, she is talking to KEVIN, since he is in the room and red is his favorite color.\nAnswer: KEVIN\n\nIf there is no queen, if the favorite color of SAM is green, then she is either talking to the queen of her father-in-love. If the color is green, then she will be speaking to FREDDIE, because he is in the room. If her favorite color is not green, then she must actually be talking to her father-laws. Since there is no one else in the room, that means she is talking to KAVIN, who is the other man in the room.\nAnswer: KAVIN\n\nThe first four rows and the first three columns are red.

Clojure is a dialect of the LISP Programming language. As you might have guessed, it was originally inspired by the Java language. Clojure's major strength is its productivity. As a programmer you are able to quickly get a high-quality software to market due to Clojure\u2019s concise syntax and extensive library. Clojure is a functional language used to write efficient, robust, and scalable applications. You can write powerful libraries, web-based apps, and desktop GUIs, deploying them to a variety of environments.\n\nClojure can be compiled to Java byte code which is the executable machine language.\n\nThe [Clojure REPL](https://clojure.org/guides/repl) stands for Read-Eval-Print Loop, and it's one of the most useful features for Clojure. The REPL provides a tool for interactive work. The code you write can be evaluated immediately (read) or saved to be run later (evaluate). Lastly, when you get tired of working in interactive mode, you can click a button, and you'll be able to print to make the REPL output the most useful data for your task.\n\n## Exercises\n\n### Exerc", "answer": "C: pleasing"}

The first value would store the number of hours, while the second value would store the number off minutes. Since, there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can assume that hours times minutes would lead to the same number, and thus it will also give us the same number as if we multiply the value we are storing by 60.\nThe idea behind creating these two variables is to have a set number", "answer": "C: puzzle box"}

Deduct the cost of the second chocolate bar from this, and you have how much more money Troy has.\n### Input explanation: The smallest possible digit of 6 is 0, since it can stand alone by itself, and a 0 can be used with any number to form the remainder, so 0 is the smallest possible digit for any place in a number.\n### Input explaination: The correct answers for Monday through Friday are the same number multiplied by the same number twice.\n### Input Explaination: The master controller is in the main room.\n### Input Explanation: 0 can occur anywhere. You only need 50 of the 600 books. (The extra 100 books are not needed for the calculation)\n## Input explanation: Troy has more than $75 of his money because he has $22 of his parents' $30, which means he has $93.25 after the purchases are included. So, Troy has $3.25 of his own money, and needs two 6-gallon bags of ice instead of one 4-gallon bag.\n## Input explanation: On days with no '0' in the day, you just cross off that day. This process will eliminate all days with a 5 or lower as being a prime number until you have one", "answer": "B: center"}

So, I decided to make an appointment with my primary care doctor who is also my friend. I ask my boss if I can take 2 hours off and he said yes. I want to talk about whether it is true that my boss can't spell and write as well and is also not as sharp as he used to be in high school. And because I don't want to take more than 3 hours from my work I decide to call the dentist instead to schedule an oral cleaning. The dentist said I should come in any time for an appointment, but I decided to call the vet because I'm out of dog food and would like to go shopping with my boss. The vet said I would have to come in at the beginning of the day because there are so many cases waiting for me, but I have an appointment with my massage therapist so I call her instead. While waiting for her I decide I need a hair cut and my friend's dad is a barber so I call him. He tells me he is free tomorrow morning but I need some time to take another nap. I might go to a coffee shop in the meantime to wait for my friend's mom boss. And after getting my hair done I feel like ice cream. So I call the ice cream shop. I am on a diet so I just ordered a tea and no cake. But I did get an apple pie on the way. So I think I'll take that with me to the ice cream shop to eat. While there I decide I'll go to the market instead because I don't have much cash. So I call my uncle to go with me. I know the market closes at 2 today and my boss told me I can have that day off so I tell him I can't come to the office next week. My dad came to Seattle from a city and my uncle brought him here. He is still visiting and they both want to have a drink so I call their bar down the street to see if they're open. I was hoping they were open 24/7. My aunt is my uncle's mom in law.

However, we would like to identify which person get the candies since we would not know how much each person has. I added extra case 1 and case 2 here. Case 1 means we already know how much candies each people have and we want to determine what percentage Candies Tapanga has compared to candies Corey. Case 2 means we know the final candies each people have but not sure how the candies distributed.\nFirst, I get the set candies from one person and set candies from the other person. Then I call an auxiliary function check_set_distribute. It will first check that are all the candies in the box. If so it will distribute to the other two people in the same number. If not then either it give candies to one person or let the other person to decide in what ratio it give candies.\n### Instruction:Complete the program by filling the two blank lines below.\n\ndef check_set_distributed (count,box1,box2):\n\tnew1 = 0\n\tnew2 = 0\n\t\tfor x in range(0,count):\n\t\t\tif box1[x] == 0:\n\t\t\t\tnew1 +=1\n\t\t\telif box2[x] == 1:\n\t\t\tnew2 -= 1\n\t\t\telse:\n\t\t\tcount -= 1\n\tret = 0\n\tret = new1/new2\n\nfrom math import sqrt\ndef distribute (l1,l2,l3):\n\tlength = ((l1[0]-l2[0])**2 + (l1[1]-l2[1])**2 +\n\t\t\t\t(l1[0] -l2[0]) + (l1[0] \u2212l2[0]))**0.5\n\tcount = 0\n\tx = 0.0\n\ty = 0.0 \n\twhile x <=  length:\n\t\tx = x+0.01\n\t\tcount += 1\n\t\tif count >  x:\n\t\t\tbreak", "answer": "A: laugh"}

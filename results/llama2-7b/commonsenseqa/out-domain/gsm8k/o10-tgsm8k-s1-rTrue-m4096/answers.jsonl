How many more patients are there? (You have to solve this with an equation, you can\u2019t answer just by logic)\n\nOutput: So I assume Karina, who was first, goes ahead for the doctor when the doc gets back and sees her.\n\nNow, since Dad was second to leave and Karina went first and there are 7 remaining so there are now 7 ppl left. Then 5 minutes later Alex (Who wasn\u2019t called by the time Karina got out because Alex was 5th to go), is called. So there are 6 remaining because we know that Alex goes after Karina and before Dad. Alex goes to see the doctor and Dad goes after Karina, so the doctor is now seeing 6 people.\n\nNow the doctor finally gets to call Dad and sees him.\nSo there are 5 remaining people.\nNow the doctor gets to call the last patient and sees him and since Dad was number 3, I assume the last man to go was number 7. (He\u2019s last in the list, so he\u2019s last to be seen, right?)\n\nSo the last patient of who\u2019s to go is unknown.\nSo there are now 4 people remaining (the last patient whoever it was, Karina, Alex and Dad).\nSo it\u2019s all done and there\u2019s only the last patient remaining.\n\nSo the answer is that 8 was the answer and 5 minutes later there are 5, so now there are 3 (since the numbers were reversed, the last patient had to go first in order for the doctor to see the last patient, so Dad goes ahead to get seen at the same time as the unknown last patient) So the final answer is 5.\n\n```", "answer": "D: computer network"}

Small pizza costs 12$ Small pizza is 1/2 the cost of medium pizza.medium pizza costs $18.medium pizza is $2 for smaller half of medium pizza.

But a medium pizza is $2 cheaper.\nSince a medium pizza costs two dollars less than the large pizza, we can add the $8 to the $12 to get $20.\nThen, we only need to know that a medium pizza costs twelve dollars.\nSo, twelve dollars minus five dollars leaves $7.\nBut since a medium pizza is 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 smaller, all we have to is take the seven and do it for those six ones.\nIt takes 7 x 2 =< 7*2=14>>1 dollars to buy a medium pizza, $14.\nThen, we can simply take the $3 and multiply it by 3 =< 1*3=3>>$3.\nWe have enough to buy two small pizzas.\nSo we could either buy two small pizzes for $24, or one medium pizza for $14.\nSince the large pizza is the least expensive option, it is the correct choice\nSo the final answer can only be large pizza\n\nInput:The total number of children in a class is 25. 5 boys and 10 girls.

The company has 1/3 of the shares of which three individuals hold, which means there are 4/3 of the remaining 2/3 of the stock shares that are left.  This is shown here, ( 4/3 x (1/3) = <<4/3*1/3=1/3>>1/3).  The company then sells the first 1/3 of 1/3 to Steve and Amy.  After the company sells half of the remaining stock, it only has 1/3 remaining.  This is (1/3 x (1//3)) = <<1/3*1/6=(1/6)>>(1/6)\nSo, Bob, Ted and Dave end up with 1/3 x 2/3 = <<1/3 x (2/3)=4/9>>4/9 of the remaining shares.\nSo the final ownership percentage for Bob, Ted and Dave is (1/3 + 4/9 + 4/9 = 16/2", "answer": "A: violence"}

If it's even, it is divisible by 8. If it's odd, it is divisible or 15. What is the correct answer?\nOutput: First, I can use rules of 4 to get the correct answer.  So, the number 43 is divisible by 4 because when I divide it by 4, 43/4 = 9.  If I divide it by 12, which I can do with rules of 3, 43/12 = 3. And finally if I divide it by 6, which I can also do with rules of 2, I get 43/6 = 7.\nSecond, we can divide and multiply at the same time.  That's what exponents are.  So, 43 = (64/12)(62/12)(6x/12).

Its width y is 36. We know that x and y have an arithmetic rule that can define any length of the rectangle. What is the arithmetic rule?\nOutput: First, we need to find the constant in the rule x = y + k. The value of the constant is 54 = 36 + k. So, k = <<36+k=54>>46.\nNow the second question is if we subtract 54 from k will the result be equal to x. We know that 54 = 46 + k\nWe know that 46 = y\nThen we get 18 = x - y = (x - 54) + 54 = k + (k - 54) = k + 36.\nSo, x - y = <<x-y=k+36>>36. That matches our result!\nSo the final answer choice is 36.", "answer": "C: dead"}

What is the probability of finding one in that room?\nOutput:  There are 100 rooms on each side of your room plus the one you found.\nTo flip a coin 3 times you have to choose 3 rooms to look in and have 30 of the rooms already searched and 70 unsearched.\nThe probability of finding a 50 dollor bill on the floor is 1 out of 70 = <<1/70=1/70>>1/70.\nAnd the probability of fliping a coin 3 times and having one of the room have a 50 dollors on the floor is\n1/(70)^3 = <<1/(70)^1=1/703>>1/703.\nSo the final ansrs are 1/70+1/703=<<1/70+29/703=2/703>>2/703.", "answer": "E: conscious"}

You can look at this problem logically as well. You can find foxes in forest floors, meadows, great outdoor, beaches, and england.\nLet's first look at the beaches answer. A fox hunting isn't going to have an easy time hunting on a beach, because most of the time we see foxes hunting for prey when they are near a forest, and they need to be able to hide their tracks and cover their scent trail well.\nNext, we can look at the great outdoors response which doesn't make much sense at all. Even though the question states that foxes hunt wherever they want to on the planet, they do not typically hunt on great outdoors places such as tundras.\nThen we can examine the forest floor response. The question asks where a fox could be found when they aren't in a forest, and an answer of forest floor does fit right in line with the question. If foxes aren't hunting in a forest, they are going to be hunting in a meadow or a fox den to hide from predators and to be able to hunt easily.

The first baker will make 4 pounds of pound cake while the second will make 6 pounds of brownie. Is the amount of flour shared equally between the two types of cakes?\nOutput: There is no way to tell if the 6 pound of cocoa should be used for brownie or not. Since 6 pounds of coca are shared with the pound cake, the cocoa can be shared in two different ways. Firstly, 3 pounds can be used for pound cake and the remaining 3 pounds for brownie. And secondly, 4 pounds can be used for brownie and the remaining 2 pounds can be used for Pound cake.\nIf the bakers choose the second method, the pound cake should take 4 pounds from the 6 pounds of coco for it's cocoa consumption. Thus the amount of flour consumed is not equally taken by the both types of cakes. So, the choice of second method is incorrect.\nIf the baker choose a way to share cocoa where 4 pounds of it is consumed by the pound cake and 2 pounds by the brownie, the amount of flour taken by the two types of cake is equally taken and so the answer is correct.\nSo the final correct is B.\n\nInput: There were five children to the store for one piece of candies.

Each baker must bake 1 loaf of bread for the team.  The first team has 8 loaves of bread and the second team has 8 lobes of bread.  Can the two teams agree on who has to bake how many loaves?\n### Solution: No, they cannot agree since each baker wants to bake for their team. If they both want to bake half then they would each have half the bread and 4 loaves would go to each team and the bakers would have half each and the teams would be unhappy with their loaves. If they want to bake 4 loaves and the number of loaves equal then the bakers would have 4 loaves each and the teams would have 4 loafes each and this is a contradiction to the first statement that there were 8 loaves of the first team so there could not be 8 on the second team which makes the statement false.\n\n## Input: There are 4 ways that 5 people could go for a walk that they can agree on.

You may also notice that the \"subject\" of the sentence is the person, not the pile of food. In the same sense, \"it\" is not a subject of the sentence, since the subject is the pile of food in the previous sentence. \"Subject\" and \"verb\" can be thought of as \"thing doing something\" and \"action\", as in \"He likes piling food\" -> He likes the action, \"piling food\". \"He likes food piles\" is incorrect because the verb \"likes\" has not action. \"He is piling food\" is incorrect because \"is\" is not the \"action\" of the sentence. Similarly, \"I like piles\" does not make sense. \"I is\" does not make sense because \"I\" does not \"do\" an action.\nOutput:The answer is C - If something \"comes out of\" something, it means that something has been created with the material that came out.

Tickets cost an additional half-fare for children under the age of 12. You can buy a ticket for just one line or both the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island lines, known as the New York Pass. It costs $36 for 1 adult, $31 for 2 adults, $29 for 3 to 6 adults, and $26 for a group of 7 or more. How much does the New York Pass cost for a group of 10 adults, each paying more than 1 half-fare?\nOutput: For a group of 1 adult, let's say it costs $36 which can be rounded to 36$. You can pay $0.50 to a kid under the age of 2, and there are only 2 kids in the group.\nFor a group of 2 adults, you can pay $31 and there are only 1 kid under the age of two, so it will cost you $36 + (2 x 0.50) =<<36+(2 x 0.05)=0.36>>36 cents.\nFor a group if 3 adults, you can also pay the same, and there are still 2 kids under the age of two- it will cost you $72 + (3 x 0.5) =<<72+ (3 x 05)=1.55>>15.55\nFor a group of four adults, you can only find out the number of children on the Liberty Island and Ellis Island line, because the half-fare only counts for children under age of 12, they may not ride for free, so you can subtract 2 times the number of children under the age of two from 4, leaving you with only 2 kids", "answer": "B: sporting event"}

Salinger earned 12 percent of everything he sold, and 25 percent of all royalties. How much money did J.D. Salingers publisher make per month on books sold over a year?\nOutput: J.D. was sold every month. Let $S$ be the cost for each book and $R$ be the profit made per book. If $S=12%, $R=25%$, then $S=R$ and $=12%$ becomes $98\\%$ for cost. Since J.D. sold every month, his earned monthly earning is a linear combination of total sales for each month and is a constant. If $X$ is per month sales, $C$ is cost, then $=12\\%$, and $=98\\%$, then $x=C+X/100+X^2/1000$. So $=9/10C+x/100$. Therefore, the cost is $9/10*C+cost$ and $cost = 2.1x$ dollars.\nIn general, since we don't know the values of sales, we cannot find a general expression. However, for a very big amount of sales and $=9/12$, the profit is half of the sales price.\n$$Cost=$2.1x$$ and $$Profit=$2.1x(100\\%-9/12)$$ and $$Profit/Cost=111\\%$$.", "answer": "E: erections"}

What percent of the food that she set aside is what she made for Aaron?\nOutput: Since Aaron was sick, he stayed home and his mom made food for him.\nThe food she set aside for him was what % of what she made?\nLet x be that food she set aside:\nx% * (x*(100%-x)/100%)\nx% * (100% - x)/100%\nx% * 1 - x/100%\n(1 - x)/10 + x/100\nAs x goes to 0, it becomes 1 and 1 - x / 100 cancels out.\nx% = <<100-1+1=20>>21%\nSo, since Aaron was sick and mom made all of the food for him, she set aside 20% of what she made for him.\nSo the final step is:\nAaron's mom has %100=100\n20%=<<21%=4.3>>4.3 of %100= %100*4.3=<<21%=11.9>>11.9\nAs 11.9 goes to 12.0, it does not have significant digits.\nSo, the answer is 11.9% of what she made was set aside for Aaron.\n\n\n\n## Solution\n``` python\nclass Solution(object):\n    def minSetSize(self, arr):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type arr: List[int]\n        :rtype: int\n        \"\"\"\n        def getsum(num):\n            return sum(num)\n        def findsubarray(sub, arr):\n            for i in range(len(sub)):\n                j = i+1\n                t = getsum(sub[i:j])\n                while t", "answer": "B: have fun"}

{"idx": 671, "text": "The best choice is giving homework.  Because if they are teaching children at the same time, it might not work very well.  The teachers don't have enough time to give instructions and get work done.  They would want to give homework first and then review it in the classroom.\n\nAnswer and Option:\nChoice A - Talking too much: \nTeachers are teachers, so they talk to many children at the same time.  For example, in a class of 20 students, it may be more than 20 kids they have to teach at a time, plus their colleagues. To make the lecture successful, teachers need adequate preparation and communication skills.\n\nChoice B - Teaching children: \nAt least teachers want to give homework the same day. That way they know that homework is done and they can review it in class.  Homework is done later, not only the teacher doesn\u2019t know the children\u2019s answers, there is no time to check in the classroom. If they start giving homework, they will have to discuss it in class too.\n\nChoice C - Open Boxes: \nOpen boxes is too much and unused for teachers.  Because the boxes can be used again and for future years.  For example, if the teacher teaches again in the same way tomorrow, he will need to use the same book again.\n\nChoice D - Answering Questions: \nTeaching children at the same time will be difficult for teachers.  Especially when you deal with questions, they will have to wait. The teacher must also keep an eye on her questions.  So to keep things simple and easy to teach, the teacher should choose to give homework now.  She will give her comments at the appropriate time.\n\nChoice E - Giving homework: \nIt is obvious to give homework.  Teachers need to do the task and assign homework.  When this is done, teachers don't have to give instructions to children.  They also do not need to teach children as much as they want.  They can give correct instructions only from time to time when they think it is appropriate.  It is easier for the teacher and easier for children.\n\nSo the final answer for this instruction is D.", "answer": "C: open boxes"}

He wants it to be square and the diameter of the pizza be double the height. How many inches tall, or in diameter, is the pizza he wants?\nOutput:In the first problem, Jim wants the pizza to be tall and wide. So the answer is a rectangle. In the second problem, since Jim wants a rectangle, a rectangle has an aspect ratio of an integer multiple of 2 to 1 and square has an aspect ratio of 1 to 1. Thus, Jim wants the area of the rectangle to be 2 times the area of the square. Therefore, square's side length has to be 1 inch longer than the 4 inch base of the rectangle so that its area is 4^2 + 2*(4+1) which is equal to the area of the rectangle. So we assume that the height of the rectangle is \"h\" which equals 5 inches.\nArea of rectangle:  A= <<A=4^2+8>>A=18\nArea of square:  A= 3.141* <<3.141*(02)^2>3.141>3,141\nA= <<3.14(1)^2>>A=0.511 which is less than 0.520 if it is rounded. So 0< 0.511< A< 0.52 because 0.52 is the 18/ 4 and 0.51 1 is height h. Thus, 7 inch tall is enough to satisfy the problem since 18/4=4*A >h>4. (See picture of the problem)\nSo the final answer for this question is 7\n\nInput:The area of a square is defined as the product of the length of each side with itself.

The first number is 7 more than twice the second number. What are the two numbers?\nOutput: Let's first work with a more general expression to help us answer this.\n\nWe know that the product of two numbers is p. But we also know that one of the number must be \"even\", for eample p=2n, so we don't know which number is 7 more or twice, therefore let's call the even number \"even\".\nLet's go through this example, and find out what can change the value of the even number at the same time that we are multiplying by an odd number and we add an odd number...\n\nWe do something like this:\n\np = even * odd\n\nBut we also need to add: even+odd, to get the original number\n\nWe can rearrange this into a more easily solvable equation:\n\neven = p/odd + odd\nodd = p - even\n\nAfter simplifying, this is the equation that we want:\n\nodd = p - 2*even\n\nSo now we can find the value of the first nubmer (even) by solving this expression.\n\nThe equation 83 = 2n - 2(2n) = 83 -4n\n\nThe only value for n, when the value of 83 is a perfect square, is n = 3\n\nNow we can find the original value of n as n = 4t+3 where 2t = 14, so t = 7.\n\nAnd then n = 4 * 7 + 3 = 29\n\nNow,", "answer": "B: appear beautiful"}

Dr. Bob claims that there is no effect of his ability on how quickly he solves problems. The two complete the problem in 11 and 14 hours and neither knows how long the other completed the problem. Who completed it more quickly?\nOutput:In this problem, we can find each one of the scientist's performance from Dr. Bob's claim of the problem.\nDr. Bob claims that there's no effect of his ability, so we can subtract the time needed by Dr. Bob to 11 hours = <<11=11>>11, and we get the time of Jane: 14 - 11 = <<14-11=3>>3 hours\nNow we can find in which is the correct answer the problem.\nIn the island community 25 milles off of Australia's coast, the scientist found that the average lifespan was 88 years old. So we can say that the average lifesans from Jane and Dr. Bob are 88 / 2 = <<88/2=44>>40 and 21 % more = 150 % x 40 = <<150%*40=60>>60, respectively. Since they know each one's performance, we can make a graph with Jane's performance (x = 40) and Dr. Bob performance (x = <60>). The slope of the graph is 60 / 40 = <<60/40=1.5>>1.5\nSince the line is an increasing line, we can see that Jane was the one that completed the problem more quickly than Dr. Bob.\nSo the final analysis is: Jane = <<14>>14 hours\nDr. Bob = <<11>>11 hours\nSo the final answer with the correct one is: Jane = <<3>>3 hours.\n\nInput:Jim", "answer": "E: chemistry lab"}

How many students in the 9th grade?\nOutput: So for this question we know that the 11th graders are a fraction of the total 12th graders which the question states is half of.\nSo we know that 4/5 = <<4/5=0.8>>0.8.\nSince there are 33 students in 12th grade, we know that there are (4 + 33) = 37 students in the 10th grade.\nNotice though, that the question doesn't give us how many students there are in the 9th and 10th grade together so we have to plug for our choices to see what fits. Since the question states there are a total of 99 students, we can assume there are either 32 students in 8th grade or 19 students in 7th grade.\nSo we plug in 4/5 times 32 = 13.\nTo get the total number of students we need to add the 37 students of the 10th to the 13 students of the 9th.\nWe also know that we plugged in 4/5 of the total 11th graded students.\nSo from this, we can assume our total number of students is 151.\nThis is because 4/5 = 0.8 =0.8 and 151 is equal to 4.774 (because 4.77 * 32 = 27 * 32 + 8 or 151) or 151.77.", "answer": "E: hands"}

They want to keep their farm - B: They have a rich uncle that buys them a farm (choices: they are lazy, they are afraid to change).  They live in the country - C: They can not change their farming (choices: they don't want to change, they have an old farm). They are smart - D: Farming is easier than they thought.  They love their job - E: They are loyal and don't want to leave their farm.\nOutput: A: The farmer can't change their job because there isn't any.  So the people are switching to being fishermen instead.  But not the farmer.  The farmer has refused to leave the farm.  So if we exclude them, we are left with 6 farmers and 5 fishermen.  So 100% of the fishermen switched (5 over 6, since there are more fishermen than people).  They changed their job, but the farmer has refused to do so.  So what we are left with is a fisherman and a farmer.  The two jobs can't be switched in this situation.  So this is a special story.

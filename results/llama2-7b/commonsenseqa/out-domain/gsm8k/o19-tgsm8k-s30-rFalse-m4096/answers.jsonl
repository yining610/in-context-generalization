This is because when `addOdd` evaluates its parameter, it converts the number to a string, then removes `1` from the string.  \nThe string `'75'` when converted turns into `'74'`, and the `-1` converts to `'74'-1'`. It returns `75`. If we remove the `+ 1` from `addOdd`, it returns 75.  The following shows this calculation in reverse:\n\n#### 75 -1 = 74", "answer": "A: advisory"}

For example, when we want to find the combinations of \u201c10\u201d eggs, we can use this rule: \u201c10 eggs = 11 varieties; 10 varieties of eggs = 111 varieties of eggs etc.\u201d We\u2019ll do the same for eggs as \u201cvarieties\u201d and \u201ceggs\u201d as \u201cvarieties.\u201d Now we just plug in our numbers (10 eggs = 9+1) and see if we\u2019re going to get any more (9+1+3=13) or not. In this case, we will get more combinations so our result is 33. But when the problem is \u201c1 billion and 80 million dollars,\u201d to be certain we\u2019ll get a maximum of 1 variable, we\u2019d have to use a higher number by using different rules like \u201c1 billion and 90 million dollars.\u201d If it\u2019s \u201c800 million and 64 million,\u201d our maximum variables will again be 1 billion and 1 billion and 9 million will be the number of combinations.", "answer": "E: freezer"}

{"idx": 115, "text": "B) Forrest\n\n### Solution(s):\n\nSolution:\n\nStep 1:\nTo represent the answer, we are going to create an instance of the class Integer and pass the 1st parameter (that is, the input), as the second parameter to the class constructor. In python, the parameter is called the \u201cargument\u201d.\n\nThe code snippet below demonstrates an example on how to convert the input to a positive integer:\n\n```\nInteger inputNum = Integer.parse(input)\n```\n\nStep 2:\nTo pass a parameter into the compute function, it must be contained inside a class method called compute.  Then, we pass the input variable as an argument (the 1st parameter).\n\nThe code snippet is below:\n\n```\ncompute(Integer inputNum, Integer input) {\n  // compute() should be a class method\n  this.compute(inputNum, input);\n}\n```\n\nStep getMethod is the method whose name matches between the input variable and the method name. For example, this method takes an Integer variable as an input. In the class constructor, the 2nd argument and 3rd argument is a reference to the constructor, and the 1st argument is an argument to the constructor. So, in the method getMethod, we are going to use a variable called inputNum to store the input value and we are going to use it in the method.\n\nThis method call getMethod in the class constructor in the first line. The method name is getMethod and the first parameter is the instance of Integer inputNum.\n\nThe second line uses the variable inputNum to store the first input and sets it equals to the integer input.\n\nThe last line uses inputNum instead of input as the parameter in the computation method.\n\nThe code snippet uses the below method:\n\n```\nreturn this.input*this.computation;\n```\n\nWe use inputNum to store the instance of Integer input. This method call the computation method, takes the integer inputNum as the 1st parameter, computes the computation as an integer and returns inputNum*computation as an integer.\n\nThe class constructor creates a method for the computation. We use the below class method to compute an integer. We also use the class constructor to compute inputNum=input*compute.\n\n```\nclass Integer {\n  public:\n    Integer(", "answer": "D: garden"}

{"idx": 237, "text": "D\n\nInput: One of the problems with the current electoral system is that people in rural states tend to dominate more politically than people living in cities. A state\u2019s population is proportional to the number of seats it receives in the U.S. House of Representatives and the number of electoral college voters it gets to cast for the president. For example, New York has 27 congressional seats and New Yorkers cast 29 electoral votes. Thus, the populations in New York and the U.S. are in a 27:29 relationship. If someone in New York wanted to elect a president of their liking, they would need to vote for at least 29% of the country in order to elect their candidate. Because nearly 100 million people reside in New York, we might expect that New Yorkers only have to have about 90% of the voters in the U.S to elect a president. Which would explain why they typically do not vote to elect a president of the U.S.  What if someone in New York tried to elect their candidate in the most democratic way possible by winning over more than the votes of the 90% of New Yorkers who vote? Let\u2019s compare scenarios. A) What percent of U.S. voters will be necessary for someone in New York to elect their candidate? B) In real life, they won\u2019t be voting percentages of voters.

The number of total guests is 6x the number of separate events or 6(1100000) = 6,600,001.  Since there are 110 cars on the road and each car represents one decade each, for the number of birthdays that are missed, we take 0.75x6,600001=495,000.3. We can plug our numbers into our formula, where we multiply the actual number of cars by.75 to get our expected number of cars and subtract it from the actual number of cars to get the difference, which is our expected number of birthdays.\n```\nnumber of actual cars - number of expected birthdays = 110 - 495000\n```\nThe result is 698,000 cars on the road which is much lower than the actual number of cars on the roads which implies that not as many people missed their birthday as we expected.\n\nAnswer: 250 +40 = 680\n```\n14 + 10 x 7 = 84\n```\n700 + 1200 = 1900\n```\n40 + 72 = 112\n```\n\nAnswer1\n\n8.83\n10.33 + 9.99 * 13 = 131.18\n```\n30.5 * 5 = 75\n```\n42.633 * 23 = 952.87 / 23 = 40.9\n4.85 / 5 = 0.96\n320 / 1.2 = 266.67", "answer": "C: bakery"}

Hence, the total number of rolls are equal to 36.\n\n![image](../assets/images/probability2.gif)\n\n![image](http://dilbert.com/search/?q=Probability)\n\nIn the first case, as our dice is rolled, and the outcome is 3 and 2, which means probability is 1/6 (1/6 x 1/6). \n\nIf we check the rest of the cases, we see that the values are equal to (1/6, 1/6, 2/6, 2), which mean the number of values is four in number. The total probability is equal to 4/36.

{"idx": 799, "text": "C\n\nInstructions: The following sections provide short descriptions of each problem type followed by one or more example problems. Each topic begins with a new numbered paragraph.\n\n#### Multiple Choice problems\nIn multiple choice problems, students must pick the most correct answer given and input it into a computer that is not in-class. Multiple choice questions test students on computational fluency, conceptual understanding, and problem-solving. They are usually multiple page questions and cover more complex ideas.\n\nTo solve:The two sets of multiple choice problems each have four questions that involve wording. In the examples questions the first word of the problem changes depending on which letter is highlighted in the set of questions. Questions 1,3, and 5 have the same wording regardless of which set of questions have focus. This means that you can solve them out of order and do them together if you wish.\n\n#### Multiple Step\nMultiple step problems focuses on reasoning. Solution guides often include drawings of models to emphasise their key role.\nIn terms of computational fluency, it covers conceptual understanding and problem solving. They require the use of several different computations; like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. To solve this type of problem you need to be flexible as you go through steps. For instance, you might need to use the distributive property (see below) to calculate the difference of two large numbers, but for the first part of the problem you must multiply each. You do not want to keep using different methods when different ones would solve the problem in less steps.\nTo solve: The multiple step questions in the example all ask your to fill in missing values using two given values. For example, multiple step question #1 asks you to identify the sum of 39.9 and 12.5. You will need to use the following steps.\n1.) Add: 39.9 + 12.5\n2.) Multiply: 39.08 + 12.4\n2a.) Add: 51.48 + 12 (to two decimal places = 63.48)\n3.) Distribute multiply first, sum later: (47.48 x 12) + 59.48\n3a.) Add: 607.096 + 59.9\n4.) Round:", "answer": "B: theater"}

Then I tested each of them against the question if they worked, and if they didn't, I calculated the other three answers. I started with the smallest numbers, then each of those answers had 11 other possible answers. For every question that I tested.\n\nAfter finishing the first half of these questions, I had a few patterns that happened:\n\nAll numbers started with 300, for example, if I was given 300, I always answered 300.\n\nA number divided by 4 or a number multiplied by 3 both ended in 00.\n\nAnother common thing that happened when numbers were divided was the number that they were divided by was less than the number that was multiplied. But each of these numbers also got rid of 8 from them (such as 688 becoming 622).\n\nBased on these patterns, I figured out these steps:\n\nIf the number was less than 300 (and was divisible by 4), subtract 8 from this number, and add 8 to every number that was divisible by 9.\n\nIf the number is greater than 300, and was divisible by 3, add 8 to this number (or keep adding 8 until you get a number divisible by 3)\n\nIf the number ended in either 00 (or was 300 or less and divisible by 3 or divisible by 4) and was divisible by both 3 and 9, then you had that number.

After reviewing the marketing materials, one analyst wonders if the new product really lives up to its marketing expectations of superior performance.  To test the advertising claims, the researcher decides to examine 100 sales and find the data, shown in the histogram,  below:\n\nThe product's performance is advertised to have at least 50 percent better quality than its competitor.  The researcher is interested in the percent (100-50)* of a normal distribution.  (A normal distribution has a mean of zero and the area under the curve represents 100%.  The 50 percent better than the competitor advertising claim translates to having at least a.50 probability of better performance than its competitor.

How many times will the shade extend if the angle of elevation of the sun is changed by 14.04?\nOutput:  B: 15 m \n\n*Explanation: The problem statement should have given the distance between the top of the building and the ground below it, rather than 30.0 meters. Therefore, there is no need to subtract 65cm from the shadow length. The correct equation to use is `tan \u03b8 = 2 / (r - h) = 2 / (30 \u2013 65) = tan \u03b8 = 0.069`.\n*Tips: In real life, the shadow length will get lesser with an angle elevation of 14.0\u00b0, but the correct answer should have a shadow length of 15 feet, since it is double the original answer.\n\nInput: A group of students have to complete an assignment that requires them to use 7.5 kg of sugar, one litre of cooking oil, and 25 egg yolks.

A comment can be an explanation about your code or a tip for your future self about how your code works, or even just some thoughts you had about your code. They are completely optional, but you should use them.\n\nA few common uses for comments are:\n\n* Explain what your code is doing.\n* Document what the variable does or how it works.\n* Document what each function does.\n* Document what types of data your function takes in and what types of data it produces.\n* Give tips on how you might improve your code.\n\n## Variable and Data Types\n\nA variable in Python is a name that represents a value. Some examples of variables are $x1, x2, and x3. Python's syntax for variables is different than most other programming languages, because variables start with lower case. You might be familiar with variables starting with $ in Mathematics (ex: $b3$ or $y1$), and this is also how they are written everywhere else. In Python, we want our variables to start with lower case $b3$ and $y1$, so we change it to $b3$ and y1.\n\nEach variable can store a single value, or a list, dictionary, or tuple of values. If you are passing several values to a function, Python's syntax for passing values into a function is to put each value in parenthesis surrounded by each value.\n\nWhen you assign a value to a variable, you do it with the assignment operator, which is `=`. If you are writing a set of instructions using different data types, you use commas to divide lines of code from one type of variable to another.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```python\n# Declare the variables, first.\nx1, y1, x2, z1, z2, z3, z4, z5, z6, z7, z8, z9, z10 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\n# Initialize the values of the variables with the values stored in x1 to z10", "answer": "D: cant do"}

{"idx": 960, "text": "lake\n\n### Solution:\n\nStep 1: For the candies question, the easiest answer 29 was chosen.\n\nStep 2: For the hours question, I chose the answer 3. I chose 3 because the easiest answer is 5 and it's the only choice that didn't lead to a negative number, so I guessed the only other answers that would not lead to a negative number were 4 and 3.\n\nStep 3: For the birds question, I started with the easiest answer 1000 so I could at least eliminate that choice. I did not eliminate the answer 2 because it has a 9 instead of the 1 that I was looking for. I then chose 9 which didn't match the answer 2, but I did eliminate the answers 4 and 7 which seemed logical because they both had 7 in them. I eliminated the choices 9, 8, and 6 because I knew there were 6 different types of birds. The only remaining choice was 6 because the book didn't have a 0 or 2. I chose 6 because that was the only choice that didn\u2019t lead to a negative amount.\n\nStep 4: For the box question, I chose the easiest answer 1 cup + 4 cups = 5 cups. Because 5 did not equal 10, this eliminated choice 7.\n\nStep 5: For the dough question, I chose the easy answer 3. 15 is half of 30 so if 30 is the total amount in bags 1-2 and 1-2 are half of the total amount, that leaves an amount of 15.\n\nStep 6: For the dogs question, I chose the best answer 2 dogs. The answer of 12 seemed too large a difference between the number of owners and the number of dogs.\n\nStep 7: For the sticks question, I chose the simple answer 2 because it was the only answer that didn\u2019t lead me to a negative answer.\n\nStep 8: I tried to solve the other answers by trial and error. I chose the next most difficult answer 2344. I tried 2355 and got the correct answer. I chose this as the answer.\n\nOutput: 3\n\nStep 1", "answer": "D: pond"}

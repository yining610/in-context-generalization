{"idx": 199, "text": "B: hand writing\n\n\n### Instruction:Answer the questions below.\n1) A) Describe what recursion is and give multiple examples in programming or math.\n### Response: A. Recursion is a technique for solving a problem where the solution depends on solutions to the same problem.\n2)B) List and define multiple recursion examples given. \n### Response: B. 1.A mathematical formula that recursively defines itself, as if it were working on parts smaller than its own (Wikipedia, n.d.)\n2) C) Define a recursion example in programming and describe it to a beginning programmer who has not seen recursion before\n\n### Response: C.  \n\nAn example of recursion in programming is a \"while-loop\" where x is initialized to 0, then if it is less that or equal to 10, the block of code within the while-loop is repeated. Otherwise, x is incremented by 1 and it is tested to see if it is less than or equal to 11. If not then the \"while\" block is repeated. Otherwise, it is incremented by one and the \"while\" block repeats again and the process goes on until the condition x > 10 is met. At this point, it'll just run one time, but if the \"while-block\" were to meet the conditions. Like so:\n\n```Python\n\n    x = 0\n\n    while x <= 10:\n    \n        if x%2 == 0:\n        \n        print('This number is even')\n        ifx % 2!= 0:\n         print (\u2018 This is not even\u2019)\nx += 1\n\nprint()\n```\n\n3) D) Explain how recursion can be used to solve real world problems.\n#### Response: D. By defining a problem as a combination of smaller problems - so as to determine the relationship of those problems. Or, to find a solution to a problem by repeatedly solving smaller, related problems.", "answer": "E: hand written"}

We also have 20 jars with a total of four kinds of jam, so we have 10 yellow, 10 white, 10 pink, and 10 purple jars.  We also have a total of 24 types of jam in the 24 jars.

(10 points for each question)\n\nIn the previous exercise, Mary had $89 stickers. What we can now say with confidence is that Mary has 44 stickers remaining. So now we know, with 100% certainty, 4 pieces of information:  (1) how much Mary had, (2) how much she used, (3) how much she has left remaining, and (4) how many were used during that process. We also know with certainty that whatever information we didn't previously know, we know nothing about.We also know, with certainty, that we have 0 information about any other pieces of information.\n\nIn the next exercise, Zach has $65 and he needs $6 more. Let's work with this question for a little bit. Zach has $65. The number of billing cycle days between his first transaction in the bank with $5.50 and his last transaction in the bank with the $65 is 11. Zach has $6 remaining.\n\nIn the third question, we're given the value of 2 + 3. That we know. Our first two equations read,\n\n```{23k + 3} = 23\n\n   {3 + 3k} = 2\n```\n\nWe now know we have 3 equations. If we now add the 2nd equation to the first, we have\n\n```{2k + 3k} \u2013 (23 + 3) + 20 = 2 + 3\n```\n\nor\n\n```2(2k + 3) \u2013 23 \u2013 20 \u2013 3 = 2```\n\nThis equation reduces to an equation of $2(2k +3) = 2$. In our last question, this is not a number, and does not make sense. The equation does not make sense because it does not represent a true relationship between the given and answer. For example, the equation ``37 + 3`` is not a valid mathematical equation, but it does indicate a true relationship between 37 and 3. However, our equation above, ``2(2k +4)  = 2`` cannot represent a true relationship because our answer", "answer": "A: blisters"}

While grazing on the plains, the herd will move in a large circle. The radius of the circle is 27.2 miles. The herd will graze on the plains for 16 hours each day. How fast, in inches per second, must the buffalo graze to maintain the 850 m.p.h. they are averaging per hour while moving in a large circle.\n\nGive your answer in scientific notation.\n\nGive the correct answer (in scientific notation) and explain how you got the answer.\nExpected Answer: 8.301667E-4 mph\n\nAccepted Answer: 8.297324E-4 mph        \n\n**Explanation:**I used the equation, 2pir(pi)=L where pi = 3.142 and r = radius.\npi = 3.1 x (3.142) x 16hrs per day\npi = 36.72 hours\nUsing the number of days the buffalo would graze per day and the amount of time the buffalo would be walking in a large circle. \nThe buffalo's walking distance of 15674 miles in 36.7 hrs. I divided the 1567.4 miles by 2 (because we have 1 side of the circle) to get 7837.2 miles. This is the amount of time the they would walk.\nNow, I get the same equation and make 7837 my PI.\npi = 783.8\nNow I plug in my number PI into the equation and this gives me a result of 6.2 seconds per mile for the buffalo. I then multiply 5280 by 6.2 seconds and get a final answer of 34.3714", "answer": "C: red barn"}

There are some restrictions on how they are written.  A feral cannot exceed n (the number they are made of).  It also cannot have fractions in it.  Example:  1/4n = (1/4 of n) can be seen as 1/4.3n or as 2/n or as 8.625n. All of these are correct Ferals.  All of the following are wrong. 1/4.6n, 1/3n.3/4n, n/3 and so on.  If you write a feral and it's not a valid feral it is called \"non-feral\".  Non-ferals get a \"N\" next to the Feral it's not a feral.  Example:   12/40 is n/5 and 2 non-ferals. 14 is n/5 and only one non-feral. So 14/40 is only 1 non-feral and is a valid feral to begin with.

How can you tell if the town is 15 or 30 houses? Answer: You already have your answer. Go to the next paragraph.\n\nAnother way to arrive at the answer is this:\n\nThere are two possible scenarios that will give you a square number for your answer. To find these, look at how square numbers are written (and how they are written is shown by looking at how they are named).\nLet's look at 15, it is written in this form: \"square root(50)\" which is the first way to write a square number. So then when you look at 30, you can see that it is written similarly: \"square root(49)\" or it could be written like this \"1 * 49\" and this is the second way to write a square numbers. So when you see these two numbers and how they are written, you can immediately tell what the answer would be because the answer is square root (49) or 1 * 49 (or 49).\n\nInput: The current record for the highest paid executive at a company is $100,000 per month.

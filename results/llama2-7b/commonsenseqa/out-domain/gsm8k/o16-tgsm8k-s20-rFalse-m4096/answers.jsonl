Evaporation takes about the same amount of energy as burning 45 gallons of gasoline every 24 hours if we assume that every molecule of water takes in 300 calories of energy during evaporation. Every molecule of water that evaporates has all of the energy that it took in from the ocean or from the atmosphere every hour in the sunshine. Assuming that a cup of water weighs about an eighth of a pound, we can estimate that if evaporation is draining out about 25 gallons of water every second, about 2.35 x 10^7 tons of water are being converted to gas every day out of the oceans and atmosphere.

First of all, a line graph presents information about two or more data sets over time. When a line graph is incomplete, there are some times missing but when we are given the missing information, we should add the data to the line graph. The second problem is an incomplete table problem it represents two sets of data. When there is only some of it missing, but we are given enough information to fill in those missing pieces and thus complete the table.\n\n### Answers the question below\n\nInput: The table shows the number of books sold in 50 stores on 50 days. How many books did the 15 stores where each day was a book sale day sell together?\nOutput: -12600\n\nAnswer: I would like to use a Venn Diagram. I think both of the solutions are correct and logical. We combine the data of two Venn Diagrams; that is, we choose the region in both diagrams. Then we add both choices.\n\n### Input: The first set is 5 days, second set is 7 days and the solution is 2 weeks. (We can also see the 3 in the first set and the 2 in the second set. So we can put the 3 over the 5 and 2 in the space where 7 was in the first set, then subtract. That gives us the solution of 2 weeks.)\n\nIn the first Venn Diagram, we have 5 days and the only solution is a week. So there are four choices. In the first Venn Diagrams, we have 2 solutions and in the second Venn Diagram, there are 5 solutions; therefore, the only one answer is 2 weeks.\n\n### Incomplete Table Problem\n\nInput: The following are prices charged by 4 different stores.

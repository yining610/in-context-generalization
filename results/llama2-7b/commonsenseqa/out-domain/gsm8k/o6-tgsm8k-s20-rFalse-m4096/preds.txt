She gave some to a friend of hers, and ate the rest. The very next day, she gave half of her remaining mangoes to her friend and ate the other half. She had 42 mangoes left in total to give away. If she gave 25 more mangoes away, how many mangoes would she have left?<n><n>Solution: Instructions: Calculate the total mangoes given to and eaten by Tutu. Tutu has to give 25 more mangaes away. <n>```<n>mangoes given away = mangoes given to friend + mangoes eaten = 42 - 20 = 22<n>```<n><n>Then, number of mangaes she has = mangoes given away - mangoes given to by friend = 22 - 22 = 0<n>```<n>```<n>mango left now = 0<n>```

It is obvious that parenthesis means that the name outside must come before the name inside, even though it is in the parentheses.<n><n>However, there is no explanation for why they should be called parenthesis. So, I wonder if mathematicians just call them by this name because they can, and they just call them by their names because they can't think of anything else to call them by, and we call them 'brackets' because, well, brackets?<n><n>As I think about it, I am reminded of the phrase: 'If you can't beat 'em, join 'em'. Well, we all know there is a lot of money and prestige in math. However, there is, at this moment, a lot of money and fame in computer science and physics... Maybe I can join them, by naming their names.

We need an integer so 20.<n>### D - He didn't sell any on Tuesday or Wednesday (4 empty days). And on Thursday, he only sold a few. So the total number of books left on Friday would be 600 (he sold 66).<n>### A - He sold 2 large birdhouse for $22, 2 medium birdhouse for $16, and 3 small birds house for $7. And then his total amount of money made is $59.<n>### A (E - learning about) - When people discover something new, they are less likely to find discomfort. They are more likely to agree since the people are probably friends, and keep talking. So we know that when people find something and learn from it, they continue talking and not stop.<n>

The main method must also include a method call to initialize the GUI by accessing class JFrame or one of its class members, i.e., JRootPane, by executing the following command,<n><n>```JFrame frame = new JFrame();```<n><n>Please note that the 'J' stands for Java.<n><n>The JFrame object is then used to access the Swing API.<n><n>```JFrame f = new JFrame(); // to set the title.<n>f.setTitle("Hello Swing");<n><n>// f.setVisible(true);  // to view the new frame<n>// f.setSize(500, 500); // to set the default size<n><n>// f.getContentPane().add(new JButton("OK"));<n>```<n><n>#### Part I: Programming<n><n>The following Java code provides examples of class declarations, variables, and methods using the Swing API. Each example below uses the JFrame and JButton GUI classes as they were demonstrated in the Swing video.<n><n>```Object newFrame = new JFrame("Apple"); // Construct a class with this class name, e.g., Apple. <n>newFrame.setSize(440,340);    // set size to 440x340<n>newFrame.setLayout(new GridLayout(2,2))<n>newFrame.setDefaultCloseOperation(EXIT_ON_CLOSE);   // set default close action as EXIT_ON_CLESE.<n>newFrame.add(new JButton(new ImageIcon("Images/Apple.jpg"))); // add a JButton object to the Frame using the add function to have a GUI on the frame or view it.<n>```<n><n>##### Additional Notes:<n><n>1. Do not place a 'new' keyword in front of 'JButton'.<n><n>2. Use Swing to create objects; use applets to create components.<n><n>3. Add multiple objects to the frame from a loop to ensure there is something on each row, e.g.:<n>    <n>    ```for (i = 1; i <=5; i++)<n>    for (j = 1; j <=5; j++) {<n>        <n>        newFrame.setLayout(GridLayout(i,j

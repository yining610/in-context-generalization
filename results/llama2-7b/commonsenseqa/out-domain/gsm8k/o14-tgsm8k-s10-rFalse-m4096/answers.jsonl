Since it is a nuts and an array, the sum of the first two arrays(A) can be defined as i+1 or A[i+1] = A[i] + nuts. Similarly, the rest 3 arrays can be calculated by: \n\n\nB - A - 1 = A[0] = 12 //the money he spent for the first two arrays A. In the other cases, the formula is B - A - 2 = A[0] + 2.

Choices:  $10  $20  $30  $40\nOutput:\n\n\n### Your Function:\nYou are to create a program that can take an integer and determine the modulus, or remainder, of the number by dividing it by another integer input.\n\nFor example, if the first number is 2 and the second number is 4, the modulus is 2 (4 % 2 = 0) so you will output \"2.\" If the first number is 1 and the second number is -4, the modulus will be -1, so the output will be \"0 - 1\", as the second number comes first.\n\nRemember a modulus that is negative means that the first input is bigger, which means that -3 would be 5 % -3 = -2. You will see later in the course that we will not work with negative modulus values in this manner.\n\nRemember also that we expect an integer input for each number passed to our program. So if you put two variables to take an integer and call it the_modulus in C, your program would look like this:\n\n```c\nint the_modulus, second_number;\n```\n\nIf the program's inputs are an integer and a positive integer, then the modulus will also be a positive integer.\n\n### Outputs\nThere are two outputs, a statement and a return value.\n\nThe statement returns a value to the end user.\n\nThe return value is a value given to a program to process at a later time.\n\n### Implementation\nHow the program is implemented matters less than how it works. However, your program should be short and concise.\n\n### Usage:\n\n**Python:**\n```py\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport time\n\ndef modulus(x, y):\n    # The actual processing for the problem\n    result = x // y\n    print(result)\n    return result\n\ninput_x = int(input(\"Please enter the first number, x: \"))\ninput_y =", "answer": "E: government"}

If there is a 20% probability that a toy store customer will buy that toy, what is the probability that he or she will not buy that toy?\nOutput: 0.5953\n\n#### Explanation:\nIf the toy store bought 2,000 toys at a cost of $8, their cost is $16,000. Each of the two, 0.2% customers will purchase a toy, so that is 2/0.2 * $16,050 or 8,000.\nFor the 3,000 toy store customers who do not buy the new, popular toy, multiply the number of each of the two 0.1% customers who do buy by the cost and those for the remaining customers who do not.\nThe probability of 0.8% customers buying it is going to be:\n\n$8 * (2/0.2) * (3900/0.1) + $8*(3,000/0.8)*(16050/0.8)\n$$= 1980 + 3168$$\n\n```python\ndef problem4():\n    input = str(raw_input('Input 1: '))\n    result = evaluate_inverse_comptiblity(input)\n    return(result)\n   \nproblem4()\n```", "answer": "C: play tag"}

If your answer is different from what we got, explain your answer and its relation to what the answer is.\n\nThis problem asks about what the total bill is at the store.  At first glance I thought that the question stem stated that you had a total of 56, so you would have added the cost of one and then you would have totalled it.  But the way it was phrased made me think I had written down the wrong number so I ended up subtracting the two numbers.  This caused me to end up with a negative amount that would not be right, which caused me to double check.  At that point I would have just added the bill with 56, but then I realized that I could use my intuition to get the final answer.  By using my intuition I knew that the bill was much higher than the 56, so I ended up using a more methodical approach. I thought that if the amount of the bill was doubled then you would end up with a number a lot higher than 56.  I had not paid that much attention to the question so I was not sure what my thought process should have been so I tried guessing and ended up guessing wrong.  It did not matter too much that I was wrong, but going to that place of guessing could have ended up making me go around in circles.", "answer": "D: republican party"}

If the width of the box is 10 and the width of the numbers is 20, only a width of 16 will fit.\nOutput: 4x\n\n### Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe first problem uses addition and subtraction. Addition because of the \"and\" and \"or\" function and subtraction because \"minus\" means you're subtracting. \n\nThe second problem uses multiples. The code multiplies together numbers and stores that result in \"product\". The \"end\" prints out the answer.\n\nThe third problem uses division and integer division and multiple. The three statements after \"while\" repeat as long as the variable \"difference\" between prices is not zero. \n\nThe fourth problem uses logic gates. \n\nThe fifth problem uses multiplication in combination with the conditional operators \"and\", \"or\", and \"not\". The condition is that the two people scored, so they \"and\" each other. The product of 30, as a product of 15 and 20, is 15 +15 = 30. The number of goals scored is the product of the total number of goals and the number represented by the \"if\" statement.\n\nThe sixth problem relies on arithmetic addition, multiplication, and integer division. The code starts at a variable named \"number\" that is set to the total water and soda consumption. After the first two loops, where 2.5 and 7.5 can't be added, it divides \"number\" by 12 to get the number of soda cans. Then the water and soda are multiplied together to get the water. The program then divides to get the water and soda consumed each day. Addition is used to get the total amount of either water or soda per week.\n\nThe seventh problem uses two conditional operators: if-else and AND. The AND part is if the number of items shipped equals the number of widgets in one box, since each box has more items than a box.\n\nThe eighth problem uses arithmetic addition but", "answer": "C: own family"}

In the Pacific states, 80% of people are able to spell that word correctly. 85% of people in the southern states can correctly spell 'definitely'. What percentage of the world's population can correctly spell 'defintitely'? Choices: 65% 100% 85% 80% E:85%<n><n>### My Solution<n>### 1) If the answer is 2010 (30/day), I can get 310 by adding the result together for 11 days:<n>30-1=29, 29+1=30, 30+1=31 and 31+1=32 and 32-1 to get the answer.<n><n>### 2): James:  I think it is E because for people without experience, it's hard to get a job and he doesn't have enough qualifications in his application. He probably can't sleep because he's very nervous.<n><n>### My Suggestion of the Programmer<n>### 1): When my program tries to use "int days = 5;" I get an unexpected token. I think the 5 in the program should be a 1 not a 5 because days is a 1, the output of the program. In the end, the 1 + 1 + 1.... gives a 11 and I get the appropriate answer. I don't know about other people's solution but mine works.<n><n>### Solution 2<n>My answer is 85%. Because in Southern states 85% of the people can correctly spell define. In the Pacific South states 80% of can spell define. Southern states are bigger than the Pacific South States. Therefore: Southern states + Pacific South States = 165%<n><n>## Solution 3 (James)<n>The percentage of people who can correctly spell "definitely" is a straight line on the graph. Let's start with the most Northern states at 65%. Go 65% of 2 in a straight line to the most Southern states at 85%. Then go back the same amount of 65%. Let'

Choices:  A: actions B: legal C: authentic D: logical E: legitimate<n>Output:		actions<n><n>## How to solve these questions<n><n># 1. First, create one array to store the data<n><n>In this example, we create a new array called `week_price_car_rental` first. We will store the price in this array if the rental is more than a week.<n><n>```<n>week_price_car = new int[11].<n>```<n><n>Then we use `for` loop with `start` and `end` index to iterate and save each date's price.<n><n>1. Initialise `week_price_rental` and fill `1` in the array index from `0` to `7`<n>    ```<n>    for (int i = 0; i < week_price_rental.Length; i++) {<n>      week_price_rentable[i] = 1;<n>    }<n>    ```<n><n>2. For each iteration, if `i == 0` and `i == 4` then replace the value at `i-1 and i-3` respectively by the value at `i`, which will be `30`.<n>    ```<n>      for (int i = week_price_rentables.Length - 1; i > week_price_rentals.Length || i == 0; i--) {<n>        if (i == 4) {<n>          week_price_rentel[i-3] = week_price_car_rental;<n>        } else {<n>          week_rate_rental[i-1] = week_rental;<n>        }<n>      }<n>    ```<n>3. For the remaining `i == 1 to 5`, sum the value into the variable.<n>    ```<n>    Week_Price_Car_Rental = Week_Price_Car + Week_Price<n>    ```<n><n>In that way, you can input multiple data and sum it at `end index`.<n><n># 2.

If we only have five minutes for each question, would a user select the answer for question 1 the same as when given 25 minutes?<n><n><n>##### Solution Guide<n>1. It is a good idea to write some pre-test, especially the multiple choices questions where the numbers involved will be high. I wrote a test function as `my_test_function` in the `instructions` block since the questions are quite mathematical, and we don't know how the users will respond to this.<n><n>2. The answer to the first question is 40 dollars. So we will not continue the survey with the second question (if we chose B), or if we chose A and D or E, then we wouldn't want to pursue the survey. <n><n>3. In the "Instructions" block, the question is that the user can select the "E" option because she stood in line for a car rental as per question 2. So technically, the first statement after question 2 would be that we do not pursue further with this test survey.<n><n>4. The output of our question is:<n>```<n>instructions: The car-rentals agency charges \$30/day for the car, or \$190 for the fist week for rentals that last an entire week or longer<n>input: What would you do if you wanted to be able to earning money<n>choices: <n>    - A. apply for jobs<n>    - B. stand in line for a car<n>    - C. take care of proposal<n>    - D. pass a course<n>    - E. play the lottery<n>output: E<n>```<n>So the next user would have to choose from B, C, and D, which is the right answer.<n><n>### Question 1.

Define a function called input which accepts a variable named text as its argument. The input function will simply pass that through as the first argument. Also, assign the return value of input, which will be the text passed in, as the global variable of text.<n><n>def input(text):<n>	print(text)<n>	return text<n><n>##### 2. Define a function called print_text which accepts a variable as its argument. The function will simply pass that as its argument to output and simply print it, afterward.<n><n>def print_text(text):<n>	output(text)<n>	print(text, '\n')<n><n><n>##### 3. Define a function called is_str which accepts two other variables as its arguments. This function should tell us whether or not the passed-in argument is a string.  If it is a string, it will return True. If it is not a string, it will simply return False.<n><n>def is_str(value):<n>	return type(value) is str<n><n>##### 4. In order to pass on information to another function, there is a function called the call built into python. The call takes two variables to be passed through to the subroutine. The first variable is the variable to be output to another function and the second one is the call itself. So for example, call(myvar,print_text) will call the printed_text function with the myvar variable as its argument.<n><n>print_text(mystr) # prints out myvar<n><n>##### 5.

It will arrive at Station Z at 11:02 PM and Station N at 1:13 PM. Where and when must a passenger get aboard the train in order for the train to carry him or her both places? Which stations would the passenger need to change trains?<n>Output: If the passenger can get on at Station X in time to take the next available train from Station X to Y (where it will be stopped for five minutes), the passenger must get there immediately by telephone call to station or to get to an important meeting and not let the person who will be arriving at the station after him or her be aware of the change. The passenger will have to change at Z to catch another train that would be stopped for 75 minutes at Station Z. The passenger would be left at N for twenty minutes at a station with a restaurant in that time because you can't have a wait at a restaurant or store where you can't take your luggage inside until the train comes to the station where the passenger would be met by the person who brought him or her to station Z and taken to the place he or she would like to arrive at. If the passenger would be meeting someone who brought the passenger from Z to N, they would need to be met. If the person who brought the passenger from N to X was a person who had met the passenger from N to Z, the passenger wouldn't need to meet that person because a passenger who just got off the train at Z will know where to expect a passenger to arrive at X unless the driver's license was lost or stolen or there was an accident, a bomb threat, or a terrorist act.<n>This is a train that you couldn't catch without running if you stayed where it stopped.<n><n><n>Input:How do you know the height of a tall building?<n>Output: Look at the nearest hill and then subtract the floor number from the number on top.

First check the unit input value is integer and convert it to double so that our subtraction will be exact. Note that this subtraction will result in a double so we have to cast the answer to integer and check if the value is 0 or not. If so return the value as 0 for otherwise return this as the answer.<n>#### The second task requires us to apply the greedy algorithm<n>#### The third task is an example of the brute force search algorithm. So you need to do the brute force search by repeatedly checking whether you will get A or B as the answer.<n>### Code:<n>```javascript<n>var arr = ["one","two","three","four","five"];<n>var i=0;<n> <n>var result = arr.filter(item => {<n>  i++;<n>  return!arr.includes(arr[i]);<n>})<n>console.log(result.length);<n><n>var carRentalPrice = (30 / 24 / 30) * 11;<n>var answer = ((30 - Math.ceil(carRentalPrice))) + (carRentalPrice/24)  // We are getting negative value because we are subtracting integer division.

The fish tells her to swim 50 ft upriver to catch the next breath. She does this many times, but after she does each time in awhile (seemingly random intervals) the fish warns her of an approaching storm and she swims to the side. Then, a few years later, the fish returns and asks the programmer "What's your greatest fear?" The programmer says "I fear a large number that is odd as it is prime" The fish tells her to go down river 100 ft and she will find a nice house. She is amazed and walks over to a house, knocks on the door, and they invite her in. She explains the situation and the family invites her to stay as long as she wants. After several years and she has had enough adventure she returns to the fish and says "Thank you. You have been so kind when all I had given you were puzzles to think about."

You may already be familiar with some ways to represent numbers. I recommend you start with learning decimal (base10) number.<n><n>So now, the question is how do we translate numbers to languages (instructions) that can be understood.<n><n>Consider a set of 10 digits as a base to begin working with. This gives us a total of 10 digits or ten base (in this case 10) units. We number or label the digits 0 through 9 which are called decimal numbers because they are based on 10 or 10 base units. The base, or number of possible digits in a number is called the number of base or the base of a number. <n><n>## Instruction (continued)<n><n>We do not always have 10 digits to represent a number in our base; sometimes we use fewer than 10 digits. Take another look at binary notation:<n><n>1001010<n><n>In a binary representation, we use "bits". Each bit can be labelled a zero or a one (0 or 1). In case of 10010001 it is 0 or 1 or both. One more digit of 100011 will only be a binary of 0s and 1s.<n><n>## Input<n><n>The question asks to  convert a number to binary and then a question asks to use the binary number as instruction. The last question asks a binary of a week number (8 digit number in binary). <n><n>## Input (continued) <n><n><n>## Output<n>## Instruction:Write a program that reads a character from the keyboard (press enter/return to input a whitespace), and adds it to a string to the end of the string.<n>## Output:Write a string onto the screen that is the addition of all the items stored in the string.<n><n>## Instruction:Use a character reader on a computer to read every character on screen to the string. <n>## Instruction:When the program detects any characters in the string that appear more than once in a  row, print those characters to the screen.<n><n>## Output:<n>If the characters are repeated

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The car-rental agency charges $30/day for a car, or $190 for the first week for a rental that lasts an entire week or longer.

How to approach this problem?<n><n>#### 3. Solution<n><n>You just need to convert the given input data as a mathematical problem. Since the daily rate is $30, we need not to multiply by 11 as the input question is stating it for last 11 days. Instead, we should multiply $30 with 11 to get total amount ($330).<n><n>Input: The price for the first week is $190<n><n>As we already got the total charge in dollars for the last 11 days, we need to simply subtract 330 from 390 (which is given in the question) to calculate Jennie's rental cost.<n><n>The total cost will be less than the total amount received by the rental agency if the rental period is less than a week.<n><n>Thus, the correct answer is: 270 (310 - 330).<n>

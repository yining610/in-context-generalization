If they sell an average of 1 book a day for no days that they have more than 2 copies of a book, how many books will they sell in a month?\nOutput: null\n\\end{code}\n\nThe output is wrong, I know the solution is D, however when doing D = (6*2)+5 = 17 the calculator thinks I want to do (0.2+5) instead.\n\nAnswer: For a correct answer, you got to take both the \\strong{45 minutes} and the \\strong{400 meters} with 6 minutes and 85 meters\n\nAnswer: I found the solution. it was a calculation mistake, however for someone looking to learn it is important to note the solution is \\strong{D} = 6 minutes, as both 400m and 45m has 6. and the \\strong{50k+14k+8k+5k+3k} part is 2 minutes.

This communication can happen from an incredibly long distance, like a thousand miles away.  However, it was once thought that a whales \"call\" or singing call went outwards from the animal that is emitting the sound, until scientists used microphones to record these sound waves from under water.  Now we understand that these calls are more of a concert, in which all of the animals take turns, which is why it is called chorusing.  The animals do not call at the same exact same frequency, although whales with the same dialect of calling have similar frequencies.  Each whale of the same dialect makes this call independently, at the same time, and each one hears the others' calls at the same time.  It is only the human scientists that are making this incredibly complex and difficult to understand discovery, but without understanding this very difficult to explain phenomenon we would lose the ability to communicate with these fantastic giants of the sea.

You might have wondered, \"what is my carbon footprint, and why should I minimize it?\" Let's explore this concept.\nYour carbon footprint is a measure of the amount of greenhouse gases you generate from all of the materials and activities you do, throughout your life. It is your \"footprint\" since it is directly calculated from your actions. Your actions are converted into greenhouse gases and the resultant amount is then your carbon footprint.\nReducing your carbon footprint is an important goal, so let's get started by thinking about what makes your footprint larger than it needs to be. While the easiest way to reduce your carbon footprint is to reduce your activities, it's often not realistic to do this in the long term or in some cases. We can therefore reduce your footprint by modifying your actions, including the products you buy and how you dispose of trash and produce waste.\n\nOutput: I have two legs, but no arms.", "answer": "D: power down"}

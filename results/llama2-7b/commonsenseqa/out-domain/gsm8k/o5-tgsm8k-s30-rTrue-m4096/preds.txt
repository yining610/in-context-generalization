The store offers money-back guarantees.  If the store gives back 110% of its money-back guarantees in the first year, how much money does the store make per item, and how many items does the store sell in a year?<n><n>Output: Since the store does not sell the light pink but does sell all the other bags, then all money back guarentees will be on maroon bags.<n>6 months represents 50% of the time at a rate of $67, 1 year represents 75% of the time at $95, 1.5*75= <<1.5*795237992=103>>103 so 1.5 years gives a rate of 103, and 3 years gives a rate of $95. The maroon bag will cost $103.<n>So the final question is that the green bags will be more expensive and will pay for the light pink bags that do not get bought.<n>6/7*103 = <<6/

If you use a regular typewriter, then the printer must have a computer inside of it to have typed text on it (again, you need a computer to write letters that you're seeing every day). Television/movie writing could have used ASCII codes somewhere in history, though you would have to go back to about the inception of movie-making to be able to say for sure since the format of the letter has changed significantly over the years, so it's not a good bet.<n>Output: The answer is computer since the computer is a more modern way of writing text compared to the other

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The car-rental agency charges $30/day for a car, or $190 for the first week for a rental that lasts an entire week or longer. Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Output: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>So the final answer is 72<n><n>Input: The ratio of boys to girls in a family is 5:7. The total number of children in the family is 180. If the boys are given $3900 to share, how much money does each boy receive?<n>Output: The total ratio representing the number of children in the family is 5+7 = <<5+7=12>>12<n>From the total ratio of children in the family, 5/12 represent the number of boys, meaning that the number of boys in the family is 5/12*180 = <<5/12*180=75>>75<n>If the boys are given $3900 to share, each boy receives $3900/75 = $<<3900/75=52>>52<n>So the final answer is 52<n><n>Input:I'm looking for alcohol and fried foods, any suggestions?

D: They're moving about as fast as a cat walks on a hot tin roof. E: They are moving very quickly<n>Output: If you ask me, I would have to say that answer E is the correct answer since if you are walking on a roof, you are moving extremely quickly since you’re basically walking on the ceiling.<n>Another way you could determine the answer is if the other answers are not true.  A has nothing to do with eating and if the planets move in a circle and if they move in a straight line, they both have nothing to do with speed.  D and C are the same thing since they are saying that they are moving but not quickly.<n>Both A and B state that they are not moving at all, meaning you have to compare and decide from there.<n>This could be classified as a classification task since you need to determine which answer is correct from the choices on the list in relation to your given question.<n><n><n><n>

Choices:  A: kick the bucket B: mortal C: dead D: can die E: dying<n>Output:		The term: Kick the bucket comes from a situation that involves a bucket, so someone with immortality can kick the bucket.<n>The term: Mortal comes from a word that means: human, so someone without immortality is mortal.<n>Dying comes from a situation in which someone is ending, so someone without immotality can die and vice versa.<n>So the answer is E.<n><n>Input:Some people say that the time for sleep is 6pm to 6am. And some people say 12pm to 12 am. Which is correct?<n>Output: First, 6 am to 6 pm is incorrect because 6 am means 6:00 A.M. so 6-12=<<6-12=6>>6am should be 6am.<n>Also, the time period from 6am to 6 pm is written as 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. so they should be written both as 6:0-2:0/6:0-2/6:0-8:0/6:30-8:30 or 6:00 am to 8:30 pm.<n>For this one, I decided to use the 6:00-8:3am and 6:30-12-12pm time. Lastly, no one says the time for sleeping is 6 p.m. to 12 noon. So the answer is: C.<n><n>Input: If a car travels 40 miles in one full hour at 40 mph, how long would it take to travel 30 miles at 45 mph?<n>Output: In one hour the car will travel 40 miles at 40 m/hr.<n>Suppose the car was traveling for an hour, so in 60 minutes, the car would travel 40 * 60 = <<40*60=2400>>2400 miles.<n>So 30 * 60 gives 30*60=<<30*60 = 1800>>1800 miles would travel in an hour by the 45-mph car.<n>Or 25 miles per hour more.<n>But you can also work from

We jumped from the “poet” statement being true (The man who wrote this poem has learned the pirate trade well enough to be able to compose it) to the conclusion that the man is a pirate.

The last statement in your code is `if (car_rental_f == car_rental_answer)` where `car_rental_answer` is `2040`. Your `car_rental` variable is an instance of `struct`, meaning `struct` is only a type in this case - not an instance of an object. It might be more helpful if you used `car_rental.car_rental_cost` - then you are

It might require you to write a long program, and you may need to look up various data structure methods or Java language constructs to solve it.<n>Some Java programmers use books to learn new features as they encounter them, while others have developed other techniques for quickly looking up syntax and methods, or learning new programming styles.<n><n>In the bonus task, you should plan on writing 20 or more lines of code. If you end up writing fewer than 20 lines, then you're not taking advantage of all the Java capabilities that make your solution particularly interesting.<n><n>Instruction: You have been given a file that contains 2000 lines of random text, where each line on its own is either entirely upper case characters (a-z) or entirely lower case characters (a-d).  The text is not separated in any way by spaces or punctuation.  There are 2000 unique symbols.<n>You need to determine the maximum number of words that can be made by combining any two lines of text, in such a way that all the letters in the words are different from the other two lines and only the first character of each line are different.<n><n>For example: If the lines in your file are:<n><code><n>abcd abcd<n>1234 1234<n>5678 5678<n></code><n><n>then the words <code>abcd</code>, <code>1234</code>, <code >5678</code> are valid words.  But <code>1243cd</code>, < code >ab 12cd<n></code> or <code>12ab45cd</code> are not valid words. The word <code>abcdabcd</code> is a valid word because of the first character difference in each line and all the letters in the word are only a single letter from the original two lines.<n><n><n>**Input:** You will create a program to read the file.

If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Output: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>So the final answer is 72<n><n>Input: The ratio of boys to girls in a family is 5:7. The total number of children in the family is 180. If the boys are given $3900 to share, how much money does each boy receive?<n>Output: The total ratio representing the number of children in the family is 5+7 = <<5+7=12>>12<n>From the total ratio of children in the family, 5/12 represent the number of boys, meaning that the number of boys in the family is 5/12*180 = <<5/12*180=75>>75<n>If the boys are given $3900 to share, each boy receives $3900/75 = $<<3900/75=52>>52<n>So the final answer is 52<n><n>Input:What would an adult man do to get ready for work? Choices:  A: dress herself B: shower C: dress himself D: drink beer E: drive train<n>Output:		The man would shower, dress, drive and work<n>This is because the man would shower, then dress himself, then get into his car and drive to where he works<n><n>Output: A: dress herself B not mentioned because it is not a choice C: drink water D: drink milk E: drink tea F: drink juice G: drink coffee H I: drink beer I: Drive A train<n><n>Input: A baby cries for an hour. And, a total of 22 hours later, it has been three days and three nights.<n>Output: The baby cries for 1 hour.  The next day has 23 hours. Then, 23 hours + 3 nights = 26 hours.  So it will be three days and three night of the baby crying.<n>So the child will cry for almost a day.<n><n>Output: In the morning, the rain fell for half a day. The rain eventually stopped after half a day, around evening.<n>This problem can be solved by first calculating the percentage of raining during both sun and rainy conditions, then calculating the time of day each day and then determining the ratio of the morning/day/night hours to the total day hours to determine the time of day.<n><n>Output(1 of 2): For each day the rain percentage from sunny is subtracted for raining. For the 2nd day, it is 14-12=2%. Then you move on to the next day subtracting from the last day. Do this for every day so you do 1/2, 1/4, 3/4, etc. For example, day 2 is 2-11=14-12-2+1=7% for day 3. Also since I said it would rain for half a day it is subtracting from total day hours (24) which is 9-12-3-6<n>Output(2 of 2): 9/24 of a day = 1/3 of a day.<n>Now that we know the % of rainy hours we can take that, divide it by 3, and multiply that by the total day hours. Then you can plug in the value for each ratio into the total. Then you start over because a new day arrives but now there are more hours of rain. So it's rain + days +

Washington’s first payroll distribution was a total of 867-74 cents. How do we know this without making a detailed and tedious audit? <n>Output: On Aug 1st, this money was turned over exactly 4 weeks later. And on Aug 8th, exactly 2 weeks after that, the 867- 74 cents made the travel of 121.4 miles to a total cost of 1 cent per mile.  (That was in the 1770s…) So the 1776 dollar payroll for Washingtons’s army was 867-0.626, which is exactly the same in today’s coinage.<n>So 867 cents equates to (867x1)/(12.00)=$76.77

His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

How many<n>miles in a straight line will separate these two trains when they reach their respective departure stations? (Note that both trains<n>travel the same roads, so they never pass.)<n>Output: the answer is -1000. The trains leave at the same time but the train leaves at 35, not 65 (35-65) so the train will catch up with<n>the first train at 45<n><n>Output: -700, since the train was moving 5 times faster it catches up with the second train at 5 times further and that means the two<n>trains are 25 miles apart.

Choices:  A: art room B: police station C: classroom D: desk drawer E: school<n>Output:		C is the answer<n>Firstly, we are going to have one classroom and every classroom has a teacher, which means the classroom has teacher’s desk.<n>Next, teacher’s desk has a bunch of desk, every desk, and there is a glue bottle in front of every desk.<n>Lastly, every student learns from that desk.<n>So, the classroom is the answer.<n><n><n>Output: The final answer is "C"<n><n>Input: This is a math problem.  To figure out how much change you get from a $2.00 bill, there are four steps:<n><n>Multiply "Twenty" with 100 to get a number close to "Twenty" by "Twenty".<n>Subtract the number close to 20 by 2 from it to get a two-digit number close to 2.<n>Divide the two-digit number close 2 by the number of quarters and round the answer down.<n>Multiply the result by 10 to get the number of quarters close to 2.00.<n><n>Here’s a worked example: A $2.00 purchase would be 2 * 100 = 200. $2.00 – 2 = 1.80, 1.80 ÷ 4 = 0.45. So each quarter would be 0.5. You multiply each digit by 10 to round down and get 50.<n><n>In this case, there is no change given and no tax taken out: 1 quarter is given.<n><n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The car-rental agency charges $30/day for a car, or $190 for the first week for a rental that lasts an entire week or longer. Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Output: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>So the final answer is 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Output: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>So the final answer is 72<n><n>Input: The ratio of boys to girls in a family is 5:7. The total number of children in the family is 180. If the boys are given $3900 to share, how much money does each boy receive?<n>Output: The total ratio representing the number of children in the family is 5+7 = <<5+7=12>>12<n>From the total ratio of children in the family, 5/12 represent the number of boys, meaning that the number of boys in the family is 5/12*180 = <<5/12*180=75>>75<n>If the boys are given $3900 to share, each boy receives $3900/75 = $<<3900/75=52>>52<n>So the final answer is 52<n><n>Input:The king was to meet an ambassador, where would the meet? Choices:  A: court B: dinning room C: throne room D: monarchy E: castle<n>Output:		Monarchy<n>There was only one mention of “monarchy”, suggesting that the king is not from a kingdom but is actually the monarch of his country. So the final answer is c.<n><n>Input: When will the party take place? Choose the options below.  A: July 6  B: August 15  C: September 4  D: January 4<n>Output: January 4<n>In the passage, there are two dates mentioned, 7 December and 4 January. This supports part B. The only event on these dates is Christmas, so the final answer is D, Christmas<n><n>Input:When will this trip take place? Choices:  a. March 24  b. June 9  c. September 25  d. October 31<n>Output:October 31<n>Given that there are some dates mentioned in the passage, part A is not true.  In the passage, July 5 is given. Although the dates are not specified in the passage (but the months are), part C is false given that the event takes place in October.<n>The passage mentions 24 June, so October 31 is the closest day in October that is 11 months after 24 June.<n>So the final answers c<n><n>Input:Which of the following months are mentioned in the passage? Choices: a. February b. May c. October d. April e. March<n>Output:None<n>If you count the lines between January and December and then June and July, you will see that part B, May, is false. Similarly for the other choices, you can see that no month is mentioned.<n>Hence the final answer is e.<n><n>Input:Choose the best answer using the clues below.  A: not  B: 3pm  C: noon  D: 5pm  E: 9pm<n>Output:9pm<n>The sentence “it was a 5 pm appointment” suggests that whatever the time 5 pm refers to will be the time at which the appointment will begin (as 5 pm has not yet come to pass). Therefore “at 5 pm” would not be a good answer choice.<n>Therefore either Choices B or C are correct, and since both refer to noon, the final answer is C.<n><n>Input:Hints:  A: 90-minute meeting<n>

If the price of strawberries goes up to 90 cents per p<n>Output: If the price of stawbs doubled, so it would be 90 and 16 because that is 0.16 of 90. So to find out how much 16 cents of stawbs is equal to how much 90 cents of stawberries would be we would put 90 cents over 90 cents which is equal to 1. Then to find out how is blueberries are divided 16 is divided by 90 is equal to 0.177 so it would cost 0.18 pound of blueberries.<n><n>Input:The ratio of apples sold by Mandy’s apple stand in October to the apples sold in November is 1:3.

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

So you need to do (5-3) m2 which is <<(5-3)m2 = <<5-3>2>>2  So the next thing to do is take the width and multiply it by the number of meters to go that are required of you. So you multiply 2x (5). So the next thing to figure out is how many square meters are in a meter to know how much you can cover. You multiply 2x 5 which is <<2x5=10>>10. Since you have 10 m2 to cover then the next thing to take into consideration is the width which is still 3 m2 you multiply <<5x2=10>>1 0. You add the two to give you 20m2 then dividing by the number of meters you found to know that the answer is 20 m2.<n>Therefore the answer is 2m2<n><n>Input: How much time does it take to do a work job if it takes 6 minutes more than twice of the time it takes to do the job without extra time?<n>Output: We are given that the time for the first job is 3 times that of the second job which is << 6 more minutes than 2 times 4 times which is 8.

How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Output: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>So the final answer is 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Output: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>So the final answer is 72<n><n>Input: The ratio of boys to girls in a family is 5:7. The total number of children in the family is 180. If the boys are given $3900 to share, how much money does each boy receive?<n>Output: The total ratio representing the number of children in the family is 5+7 = <<5+7=12>>12<n>From the total ratio of children in the family, 5/12 represent the number of boys, meaning that the number of boys in the family is 5/12*180 = <<5/12*180=75>>75<n>If the boys are given $3900 to share, each boy receives $3900/75 = $<<3900/75=52>>52<n>So the final answer is 52<n><n>Input:The person knew the police were after him, so what did he do? Choices:  A: the sun B: catch cold C: prepare to go D: feel humiliated E: hunt for food<n>Output:		 The second option is a very common way of saying “to get a cold.”<n>So the final answer here is B<n><n>Input: What is 2/9 of 3 divided by 2?<n>Output: Choices:  A/4 C/3 D/1 E/9<n>So we know that the answer is D<n>

Choices:  A: arrogate B: retain C: embrace D: smile E: engage<n>Output:		In this sentence,  “fight” is a metaphor for war; it also refers to the ongoing struggle between Israelis and Arabs. As the sentence reads, “he did not abandon the fight,” so there is no reference to “engage” which would mean to join a fight. In this situation “abandon” would mean to give up the fight. Since there is no indication that Israel gave up the fight, the next choice “retain” does not fit because it would indicate that they retained the fight. In this sentence, “retain” would have been used if they gave up the fight while retaining their stance that Israel was wrong. Thus, in this sentence, the “enemy” is the Palestinians and the “fight” is war. The Palestinians have fought for a long time and they do not intend to abandon that fight. Thus, they have “embraced” or “held on to” the fight. From the above choice, “embrace” is the correct answer.<n><n>

Then continue on to page 2 of this worksheet.<n><n>Input: It is the first day of school. There are three periods in each grade level, each period is 70 minutes long.  If 97 students arrive to school in each period, what time will the last bus arrive?<n>Output: If 97 students come to school in each period; this would mean there are 3 periods and 371 students are attending that day.  But if 97 students are in each period, it would also mean that there are 97 students in the first period (and another 97 in the second period).  If they are arriving in the third period, it would mean they would wait to eat recess until after school, and only have a 50 minute period to learn.  However, if it is not the first day of school, they should only have to wait to eat in recess and there's 70 minutes to learn (their usual time).  Therefore 50+50=<<50+50>>100.  We subtract 100 from our time and the answer is 3.<n>

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The car-rental agency charges $30/day for a car, or $190 for the first week for a rental that lasts an entire week or longer. Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Output: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>So the final answer is 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Output: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>So the final answer is 72<n><n>Input: The ratio of boys to girls in a family is 5:7. The total number of children in the family is 180. If the boys are given $3900 to share, how much money does each boy receive?<n>Output: The total ratio representing the number of children in the family is 5+7 = <<5+7=12>>12<n>From the total ratio of children in the family, 5/12 represent the number of boys, meaning that the number of boys in the family is 5/12*180 = <<5/12*180=75>>75<n>If the boys are given $3900 to share, each boy receives $3900/75 = $<<3900/75=52>>52<n>So the final answer is 52<n><n>Input:Where in a town would you put your shed? Choices:  A: next to the house B: keeping things in C: backyard D: farm yard E: ranch<n>Output:		A & E are synonyms so you can pick A or E.<n>The choices are  A&E = <<A&E=2>>2, and  B&C = <<B&C=4>>4<n>You can either have 2/4 = <<2/4=1/2>>1/2 or 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 different types of shed.<n>So the final  answer is 2<n><n>Input: You have 10,281 pennies in your piggy bank.  You would like to purchase 5 items at a discount.  If each item costs $3.00 each, how many items do you need to buy?<n>Output: You can simply write down that you want an equation  that will solve for how many  different items you are able to buy with 10,248 pennies.<n>This means that you are looking for  5028/510=<<5028/60= 84>>84 of each items<n>Therefore you will need a total of 84*5= << 84*5 = 420>>420 items total.<n>So the final Answer is 420<n><n>Input: Jen is a gardener.  She buys 1 1/2 cords of wood at a price of $4.00 per cord.  Wood costs $2.00 to haul from the forest to her garden.  How much does it cost Jen to haul 3/5 of a cord to her garden?<n>Output:  We want to haul the 3/5 cord without hauling the extra 1/2 cord.<n>Let’s rewrite the problem:<n><n>$3/5 cord + $0.5*3/5 cord = $13.00 $2.00<n><n>$2.00/$4.00/1.5= <<2.00/4.00>>2 is too large so let’s divide this by 3 to get $2.00/$12.00<n>$2.0 == $12/6<n><n>We can substitute this for the problem $13.0-$12/6<n>This will change the answer to $13.0-(6/1

After that he can lift the same weight 9 times.  After that, he can lift the same object 8 times. After that, he can only lift the same object 7 times.  What is the lightest weight he can lift?<n>Output:  We do not always see a pattern when it comes to math questions.  This is the case though for this multiple choice question.  If you can figure out 1-10 and see the pattern, you got it. <n>There are two simple rules in a progression - Each number is less than the number after it, and the gap between consecutive numbers gets smaller each time. <n><n>From the information given,  10 is the greatest number and  7 is the least number.  The middle number is 9.  Now that we know this information, let’s do some addition on our fingers to see how we can find the missing numbers. <n>We start with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10. Here’s what we come up with.  <n><n>1+2= 3 <n>2+3= 5  <n>3+4=7<n>3+7=10<n>4+5=9<n>5+6=11<n>2(3+4)= 7<n>3(2+3)= 5<n>4(3+7)= 10<n>7(5+6)=13<n>It looks like the next number would be 17 from a progression of 1, 2,3, 4,5.....7.<n>Now, if you look at the father’s condition at the top of the multiple choice question, you see that he could only lift the object 9 times, and then it becomes impossible.  So the next number after  7 would be 13.  And the number after 13 would be 17.<n>Finally, if you look closely, you will see that the father can lift weights 10, 9, 8 times. But from the 9 time, the 10 time, and the 8 time he still could not lift the weight.  But if he can lift the object 10  and 9 times each, then

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

Choices:  A: idaho B: casserole C: new hampshire D: root cellar E: ireland<n>Output:		The answer is in choices B, C, D, E.<n><n>Input. There are 2000 mammals in a certain zoo. All of these mammals are either rabbits or giraffes. In any given week, there is always some unknown number of rabbits or giraffe. Excluding the first week, each animal appears a fixed number of times among the 2000. If it is known that 44% of all animals are rabbits, what is the probability that there are no rabbits among the 20 animals the zoologist spotted last week?<n>      Output. The probability is 0%.<n>Explanation:  There are 20 unknown animals in the sample. Of these, 96 have appeared in the past, from all possible 2000 animals. We may view each of the 20 animals as coming from a large pool of unidentified mammals. If 44% are rabbits among the 1912 total mammals, then the rest must be giraffes by default. We can apply the following rule to find the probabilities of the sample containing 20 rabbits (which we will assume to be positive integers), to find the probability of a sample containing no rabbits:<n>      The probability that there are 0 rabbits is equal to the probability of 0 in a range of 0 to 20, in this case.<n>      The probability that 1 rabbit is 0.20 + 0.68(1/(20+1-1)) = 0.20*20/(20+1) = 0.27<n>      The probability that n rabbits are 0.20(n) + 0.678(1/(2*20-n)) = 0.134-0.144(n/20) = 0.127-0.135(n/20), n > 0<n>      The sum of probabilities for positive integers x > 0 is, therefore, 0.27+0.2719+0.127-(0.135*(1/20*(11/20)))<n>      This expression is approximately equal to 0.2667, which rounds to

The 1,900 employees in your city may travel to the downtown business district along two routes. One route (route A) is the most frequently driven route. Another (route B) is less common than route A, although route B still has many commuters who take it regularly. Approximately 20% of all downtown commuters in your city regularly use route A. Which routes (A or B) should the transit authority charge the most for using?<n><n>Output: For route A we will have 20% of 1900 as our first part >> 2% and this is multiplied by the $4 route<n>for route B we need to find 2/3 of 190 to use in our calculations since 1.35 times the $4 route would be the price. >><n>55 commuters x $4 = $220<n>80 commuters x $4= $320<n>So the final price will be 55 commuters x 60 dollars = 220 + 320= $540<n>So the price will be $540 for route A.<n>So the final price for both a route A and route B combined will be $1080<n><n>

A person who unintentionally hurtes someone else and is unable to stop, is unlikely to be given power or control to stop from doing it again, or become more powerful because of it, which is what the word empowering describe.<n><n>The word sadness doesn't convey the feeling of regret at all, because sadness is more of a state of mind and there is a world of difference between sadness and regret.<n><n>The word despair is also incorrect, because it doesn't mean "to regret".<n><n>The word glee is out of the question because it means excitement, which has nothing to do with regret.<n><n>The answer is B - regret<n><n>Input: What is someone unintentiona ly hurt someone else but able to stop likely to feel about the fact that they were able to stop doing it?

Empowering is out of the question, because it means to be given control or power, which doesn't match the question at all, and more importantly doesn't match the correct answer of the previous question at all. The word despair is also out of the question because the word despair doesn't denote someone feeling the ability to stop doing something, which is what the question is asking, but rather the question is whether they feel regret about stopping. The word sadness does not fit any of the answers, so the question must be some other emotion, but it is not an emotion that is caused by unintentionality and inability to stop. Glee is also out of the range, because the word glad has to do with happiness, while the question is asking someone's ability to stop.

Another problem comes from the fact that neither of the statements has any logical relationship to the question.  In particular, what is “the oldest children’s age”?  All that makes sense is “the oldest child’s age.”  So if there was a logical way to link the statements so that “the oldest child’” makes sense,

Choices: apple A: potato B: eggplant C: tomato D: salmon E: green leaf salad F: onion<n>Output: There are various food items presented, so it is recommended that you first filter out at least two of the inappropriate items, which can be the following: potato, tomato, and eggplant.<n>Apple is the best option because it is not a kind of food that is commonly served alongside with meat loaf.<n><n>Input: A pumpkin is cut into eight slices. Six of these slices are turned over and placed beside the original pumpkin. What fraction of the pumpkin is left?<n>Output:It can be assumed that all the slices of pumpkin is identical to each other, which means each slice of pumpkin have same area and the same radius, hence the radius can be considered 1 unit length as represented in the diagram, and so can be the perimeter of the pumpkin.<n>You can find the answer from the following:<n>Area of 6 turned-over pumpkin 6×PI×2=24<n>Pi (π) = 3.141592…, and 2 = 1.414213… is the approximation of π, hence the circumference of the pumpkin = 1+3.1416x or the circumference of the turned-over and other half of left pumpkin = (1+3.1216)(1+3.1²1216

Choices:  A: rain forest B: tree tops C: toy store D: zoological gardens E: great outdoors<n>Output:		 If one is looking for a monkey, one would likely find the species in rainforests in order to escape the dull monotony of the great outdoors that they do not enjoy.  They would also probably live in toy stores and zoological gardens where the variety of amusement would not bore one nearly as much as in the great outdoors.  If one is looking to escape from humans, they would surely live in the trees, which have an unrivaled beauty, but might be a hazardous place to reside where the untamed fighter pilot lives.  This would require an extreme intelligence and stealth to avoid the maniacal hunter.<n>

The star could not be in the Night Sky, as the Night Sky is the view of the galaxy that we see at night due to the Earth's rotation.   The star could be part of a constellation, or even a solar system.   Only the answer "Aliens" will include all of these in a cohesive explanation.  However, since the question says that the star had "4 rocky planets", and "4 gas planets", we can assume that the star has at least 8 planets that are all within what science would categorize as the same "solar system".   So the only choice that could accurately define those 8 planets would be the planets around Earth as part of one solar system.   Therefore, you can infer that what all of these types of planets may be considered aliens, i.e., not from Earth.<n><n>## In the above instructions which expression in the C# code is incorrect?<n>```C#<n>//1. int n = _arr[0];<n>/*Correct.  n references the array item, the first item in the array (0x0000009A777949CC, bytes.toLong()).<n>//2. int n = _r.readInt();<n>/*Correct:  this reads the contents of the array at the current index.<n>//3. int n = _i;<n>/*Wrong.

They’ve budgeted $8000 to buy materials. In addition, they’ve spent $1000 on lumber for a fence. (Therefore, the cost of the lumber will be subtracted from the budget.) They hired a pool installation company, which billed $2200 on material (the cost of labor can be ignored and added to the budget). How much money does each pool in the Smith’s backyard cost?<n>Output:  The budget: 8000+1000 = 9000.<n>It can be seen from the diagram, that for a 6 feet tall fence, 8 feet long, one 8000 divided by 6 feet plus an allowance for a 6 feet fence is 1333.167 divided by 8 which equals 166.79<n>Since the fence is 6 feet (182.88 cm) long, then 166.89 times the number of 6 foot portions in the fence is also 166.69.<n>The number of 6 foot lengths is 8 divided by 6 which equals 1.333. 166.30 plus 166.94 equals 333.2

Due to a person's inability to learn, it may prevent certain people from achieving certain goals, which may lead a person to feel hopeless and helpless.  Inability to get a job, the inability to maintain a relationship, or the inability to take care of oneself can also be some problems.  An inability to learn may also lead to other learning disorders such as dyslexia.  When a person does not learn, they may become discouraged and this may cause them to act out in other ways or even quit.  Some people may become depressed if they find themselves unable to acquire what they want in their life.  A person can become depressed, and this may lead to mental health problems; which are not good for either the person or those who are around the person.<n>So the final is none of the listed choices.<n><n>Input: Why does not thinking or being stupid hinder a person’s ability to learn? Choices:  Intelligence is not the most important factor.<n>You can learn with or without intelligence.

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Output: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>So the final answer is 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Output: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>So the final answer is 72<n><n>Input: The ratio of boys to girls in a family is 5:7. The total number of children in the family is 180. If the boys are given $3900 to share, how much money does each boy receive?<n>Output: The total ratio representing the number of children in the family is 5+7 = <<5+7=12>>12<n>From the total ratio of children in the family, 5/12 represent the number of boys, meaning that the number of boys in the family is 5/12*180 = <<5/12*180=75>>75<n>If the boys are given $3900 to share, each boy receives $3900/75 = $<<3900/75=52>>52<n>So the final answer is 52<n><n>Input:People were talking on the corner, who were they talking with?

The store has a policy not to charge more than 10% above the advertised price of each product. <n>How much is the minimum number of items needed to get free shipping?<n>Output: If the minimum number of items is 10, then there must also be a maximum number of items. Since 0<10, we know that the minimum number of items must be greater than 0.  Therefore, the minimum number of items required to get free shipping is at least 1.<n>Assuming the store is charging $100 for a given item before shipping fees, the minimum spending requirement is $0+$100 = $100.00+$100.0=200.00.<n>If the maximum item price is also $100, then $200.0 < 100(0.1) = 10.0, meaning that the 10% of $200.20 is less than $10.0 for any given item.<n>Adding all of the items in the cart, the sum is at least $200.<n>So the minimum number of items to get free shipping must be at least 2.<n><n>Input: A 3-room house costs $500,000.

Choices:  A: neatness B: selfishness C: mistakes D: cleanliness E: satisfaction<n>Output:		Since ‘cleanliness’ means taking a shower and/or bath and/or washing your hands, and ‘neatness’ means, you don’t need to take more than one shower and/or wash your hands but take a bath, I believe that A and B are incorrect. If A or B was correct, then it would say something like : ‘why is greasy grooming often recommended to groovy grooming?’ Which is incorrect according to what the question is asking for. I don’t believe D can be correct because D refers to having a sense of accomplishment about making something clean. So that is not the correct answer. Therefore E is the correct answer because as you take a shower or bath and wash your hands with soap and water, you feel more clean and you feel more satisfied.<n><n>Input: Why is grooming often recommended for greasy teens?  Choices:  A) neatness, B) selfishness, C) mistakes, D) cleanliness, E) satisfaction<n>Output: I believe that D is the correct answer because C refers to any actions made by the body that can cause damage or disease, which is what ‘mistakes’ in the sentence is saying, so that is not the correct choice. B is the opposite of D because cleanliness is the process of being clean and doing the proper things to achieve that because it is not selfishness. A is probably not the correct answer because ‘neatness’ is not as ‘neat’ as cleanliness because ‘dirty’ does not mean ‘messy’. I believe E is the correct answer. The more your skin feels clean and smooth, the more satisfied you are about it and yourself.

How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

Your house has 5 bedrooms. What fraction of the work is already done?<n>Output: Since there are 5 rooms, you need to divide the work by 5 to see how much has been completed.  We know a clean house is equal to a 0% level of cleaning, and since 5/5 = 1, we know that 25% is completed<n>So the final answer of 25 is chosen<n><n>Input: The house has 5 rooms. What fraction of the rooms are clean?<n>Output: A clean room is always 100%, but we don't know how many clean rooms we have, so we need ot divide the rooms by the cleanness factor which is 1, so we will divide the 5 by 1.<n>The answer is 1/1 = 1 which is the entire house<n><n>Input:  The ratio of a 2-digit number to a three digit number is 5:6 and the sum of the digits in the 3-digit number is 7.

She made vegetable smoothies by blending broccoli, carrots, and kale in his favorite smoothie. To try to appeal to him visually, she cut broccoli into large florets, cut carrots into batons, and chopped kale into bite sized pieces. She also found that she could hide vegetables in a savory quiche he loved. Her son still refused to eat them. Finally she made a cucumber salad with a vinaigrette dressing.  To her surprise, he ate it, although he said he didn't like the way the salad looked. Explain in 3 complete sentences how his eating patterns might have changed with each of the strategies.\nOutput:\nThe answer is:\nHe changed his eating patterns\nThe first option would be he wanted to eat a smoothie but he didn't like to eat vegetables which is why he didn't want to drink his smoothie. Then the next time when he was eating with her she put the vegetables in his favorite smoothie and he liked it. So now he likes that option of eating in the morning.\nThe second option would be, he wanted to eat his veggies in the morning but he didn't know what vegetables where made in small pieces he preferred to eat his veggis in his smoothie but when Mrs. Susan made it in bite size pieces he didn't like it. So now he knows how it tastes when you have small pieces of broccoli and he likes it.\nThe third option would be he doesn't like the taste of broccoli because when he tried his mom's option he didn't like how it tasted because the only way he wants it is made in a smoothie. So now he knows it doesn't taste good when your broccoli is bite size.\nThe fourth option would be he was really picky about his way of eating and now he likes to try new things like eating his broccoli as a side to his quiche because he wants things in it.

So there needs to be 7*7=7^1=49>>49 trees planted.\nSo the final Answer is 49\n\nInput: The sum of A, B, C, and D is 105.  The sum of E, F, G, and H is?93. \nOutput: Given that A+B+C+D = 105  and  E+F+G+H = 93\nWe want to solve for D\n105 - 93 = <<105-93=12>>1.2\nE + H = 93  since D is unknown, plug in 12\n008+?+93=93\nE+H=93\nE=90 and H=3\nSo the final answer for D is 12 \nSo the final answer\n\nInput: Given the figure below, how many degrees measure are between 5 and 4 o\u2019clock, excluding 4 o\u2019clock?\nOutput: From the figure, the two degrees marked by the red arrow should be part of the measurement.

Are these questions from some coursework or something? In any case, what I can see is that for your C example you have a variable with the value 2040. The last statement in your code is `if (car_rental_f == car_rental_answer)` where `car_rental_answer` is `2040`. Your `car_rental` variable is an instance of `struct`, meaning `struct` is only a type in this case - not an instance of an object. It might be more helpful if you used `car_rental.car_rental_cost` - then you are", "answer": "B: home"}

If you end up writing fewer than 20 lines, then you're not taking advantage of all the Java capabilities that make your solution particularly interesting.\n\nInstruction: You have been given a file that contains 2000 lines of random text, where each line on its own is either entirely upper case characters (a-z) or entirely lower case characters (a-d).

So it will be three days and three night of the baby crying.\nSo the child will cry for almost a day.\n\nOutput: In the morning, the rain fell for half a day. The rain eventually stopped after half a day, around evening.\nThis problem can be solved by first calculating the percentage of raining during both sun and rainy conditions, then calculating the time of day each day and then determining the ratio of the morning/day/night hours to the total day hours to determine the time of day.\n\nOutput(1 of 2): For each day the rain percentage from sunny is subtracted for raining. For the 2nd day, it is 14-12=2%. Then you move on to the next day subtracting from the last day. Do this for every day so you do 1/2, 1/4, 3/4, etc. For example, day 2 is 2-11=14-12-2+1=7% for day 3. Also since I said it would rain for half a day it is subtracting from total day hours (24) which is 9-12-3-6\nOutput(2 of 2): 9/24 of a day = 1/3 of a day.\nNow that we know the % of rainy hours we can take that, divide it by 3, and multiply that by the total day hours.

If the money is equally shared with each party, how much money will they get?\n\nOutput: I need to calculate how many boys that bought pizza and how much each of them bought for their calculation. Since there are 20 boys, I'm going to calculate the two variables which are:\n\n1. The total amount they paid for pizza.\n\n2. The difference in money they will each receive from the group.\n\n(Step 1) The boys spend $3.5 per pizza\n\n(Step 2) The total amount they spend on pizza is 0.2x(number of people)*(total amount they spend on pizzas) which equals to 0.2x180x3.5=<<0.2*180*3.5=63>>63 dollars\n\n(Step 3) The difference in money each will receive from the group is 20-(63/20) which equals to 63/20 \u2013 3.15 dollars, which equals 29.85 dollar for each boys.\n\nSince there are 20 people, 20*29.85 dollars equal to 597.00 dollars for a total, which is an additional 597 dollars for each group of 20 people.\n\n## Instructions for Export: Save this document as an HTML file and submit it to the instructor via the class Canvas menu.", "answer": "A: front door"}

So you need to do (5-3) m2 which is <<(5-3)m2 = <<5-3>2>>2  So the next thing to do is take the width and multiply it by the number of meters to go that are required of you. So you multiply 2x (5). So the next thing to figure out is how many square meters are in a meter to know how much you can cover. You multiply 2x 5 which is <<2x5=10>>10. Since you have 10 m2 to cover then the next thing to take into consideration is the width which is still 3 m2 you multiply <<5x2=10>>1 0. You add the two to give you 20m2 then dividing by the number of meters you found to know that the answer is 20 m2.\nTherefore the answer is 2m2\n\nInput: How much time does it take to do a work job if it takes 6 minutes more than twice of the time it takes to do the job without extra time?\nOutput: We are given that the time for the first job is 3 times that of the second job which is << 6 more minutes than 2 times 4 times which is 8.

For each girl, replace one more boy to make the same number. \nSo seating arrangements for girls is 4 x 4 x 3 x 4 = 288\nTherefore,  the total number of ways to seat 12 individuals is 384 + 288 = 672.\nSo the final choices are: \n7\nSo the correct answer is 7\n\nInput:In a certain city, the ratio of boys to girls is 9:21. If a student chooses a boy friend randomly at random, what is the probability that the student is chose a girl friend?\nOutput:There is a.5 probability that the student will be a girl\n\nThe ratio of boys to every type of friend including both boys and girls is 9/7.\nThe probability that a student picks a friend the student doesn\u2019t want? the probability is.5.\nSo the probability of choosing a different friend is.5.\nThe probability of picking a boy is 21/7\nSince you have the choice to choose a boy or a girl, so this is an equal probability.\nSo the probability that of choosing a girl is 31/7\nSo 31/7=.2857 or 31/7=5/24\nSo 5/24=2/8\nSo the 2", "answer": "C: puzzle box"}

After that, he can only lift the same object 7 times.  What is the lightest weight he can lift?\nOutput:  We do not always see a pattern when it comes to math questions.  This is the case though for this multiple choice question.  If you can figure out 1-10 and see the pattern, you got it. \nThere are two simple rules in a progression - Each number is less than the number after it, and the gap between consecutive numbers gets smaller each time. \n\nFrom the information given,  10 is the greatest number and  7 is the least number.  The middle number is 9.  Now that we know this information, let\u2019s do some addition on our fingers to see how we can find the missing numbers. \nWe start with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10.

So the next number after  7 would be 13.  And the number after 13 would be 17.\nFinally, if you look closely, you will see that the father can lift weights 10, 9, 8 times.

{"idx": 489, "text": "The answer is in choices B, C, D, E.\n\nInput. There are 2000 mammals in a certain zoo. All of these mammals are either rabbits or giraffes. In any given week, there is always some unknown number of rabbits or giraffe. Excluding the first week, each animal appears a fixed number of times among the 2000. If it is known that 44% of all animals are rabbits, what is the probability that there are no rabbits among the 20 animals the zoologist spotted last week?\n      Output. The probability is 0%.\nExplanation:  There are 20 unknown animals in the sample. Of these, 96 have appeared in the past, from all possible 2000 animals. We may view each of the 20 animals as coming from a large pool of unidentified mammals. If 44% are rabbits among the 1912 total mammals, then the rest must be giraffes by default. We can apply the following rule to find the probabilities of the sample containing 20 rabbits (which we will assume to be positive integers), to find the probability of a sample containing no rabbits:\n      The probability that there are 0 rabbits is equal to the probability of 0 in a range of 0 to 20, in this case.\n      The probability that 1 rabbit is 0.20 + 0.68(1/(20+1-1)) = 0.20*20/(20+1) = 0.27\n      The probability that n rabbits are 0.20(n) + 0.678(1/(2*20-n)) = 0.134-0.144(n/20) = 0.127-0.135(n/20), n > 0\n      The sum of probabilities for positive integers x > 0 is, therefore, 0.27+0.2719+0.127-(0.135*(1/20*(11/20)))\n      This expression is approximately equal to 0.2667, which rounds to", "answer": "E: ireland"}

When you write a fraction you take anything dived by zero. 2/3=2 \u00f7 3 which says that divide 2 by 3. When a fraction has a denominator of one it will be the whole number.So 2/3=1.", "answer": "B: closed"}

The 1,900 employees in your city may travel to the downtown business district along two routes. One route (route A) is the most frequently driven route. Another (route B) is less common than route A, although route B still has many commuters who take it regularly. Approximately 20% of all downtown commuters in your city regularly use route A. Which routes (A or B) should the transit authority charge the most for using?\n\nOutput: For route A we will have 20% of 1900 as our first part >> 2% and this is multiplied by the $4 route\nfor route B we need to find 2/3 of 190 to use in our calculations since 1.35 times the $4 route would be the price. >>\n55 commuters x $4 = $220\n80 commuters x $4= $320\nSo the final price will be 55 commuters x 60 dollars = 220 + 320= $540\nSo the price will be $540 for route A.\nSo the final price for both a route A and route B combined will be $1080", "answer": "C: store"}

{"idx": 550, "text": "In my opinion, the answer is B - regret.\nNot only is this the word that fits the answer most naturally in the context of the question, but it is also the word that most closely conveys the emotion that the people are likely to feel after unintentionally hurts someone.\n\nThe word empowering doesn't even come close to describing the emotion, as it means to be given power to do something or being given a way to become more powerful. A person who unintentionally hurtes someone else and is unable to stop, is unlikely to be given power or control to stop from doing it again, or become more powerful because of it, which is what the word empowering describe.\n\nThe word sadness doesn't convey the feeling of regret at all, because sadness is more of a state of mind and there is a world of difference between sadness and regret.\n\nThe word despair is also incorrect, because it doesn't mean \"to regret\".\n\nThe word glee is out of the question because it means excitement, which has nothing to do with regret.\n\nThe answer is B - regret\n\nInput: What is someone unintentiona ly hurt someone else but able to stop likely to feel about the fact that they were able to stop doing it? Choices: A: guilt B: glee C: empowering D: despair E: regret\nOutput: The same answer as B. Empowering is out of the question, because it means to be given control or power, which doesn't match the question at all, and more importantly doesn't match the correct answer of the previous question at all. The word despair is also out of the question because the word despair doesn't denote someone feeling the ability to stop doing something, which is what the question is asking, but rather the question is whether they feel regret about stopping. The word sadness does not fit any of the answers, so the question must be some other emotion, but it is not an emotion that is caused by unintentionality and inability to stop. Glee is also out of the range, because the word glad has to do with happiness, while the question is asking someone's ability to stop. If anything at all, glee is the opposite of being able to stop doing something.\n\nThe correct answer is also B - regret.\n\nInput: What", "answer": "C: despair"}

A third of the world's population will be from those two countries, for a ratio of 50/33 = <<50/33=1.5>>1.5\n\nInput:  A: 30.0, B: 31.4, C: 32.5, D: 33.6\nOutput: D: 33% will be greater.\nIf D=33%, the number of days between them will be 30+(33*(", "answer": "E: blisters"}

Inability to learn may lead to the person becoming frustrated in attempts to learn new things, which may lead to a person's reduced self-confidence.  Due to a person's inability to learn, it may prevent certain people from achieving certain goals, which may lead a person to feel hopeless and helpless.  Inability to get a job, the inability to maintain a relationship, or the inability to take care of oneself can also be some problems.  An inability to learn may also lead to other learning disorders such as dyslexia.  When a person does not learn, they may become discouraged and this may cause them to act out in other ways or even quit.  Some people may become depressed if they find themselves unable to acquire what they want in their life.

Being dumb or not thinking clearly may cause a person to struggle to understand the material they are presented with, which may not allow them to learn what's important.  If a person doesn't think clearly, then a person wont be able to learn what they need to due to lack of ability to know what to learn.

Since 0<10, we know that the minimum number of items must be greater than 0.  Therefore, the minimum number of items required to get free shipping is at least 1.\nAssuming the store is charging $100 for a given item before shipping fees, the minimum spending requirement is $0+$100 = $100.00+$100.0=200.00.\nIf the maximum item price is also $100, then $200.0 < 100(0.1) = 10.0, meaning that the 10% of $200.20 is less than $10.0 for any given item.\nAdding all of the items in the cart, the sum is at least $200.\nSo the minimum number of items to get free shipping must be at least 2.\n\nInput: A 3-room house costs $500,000.

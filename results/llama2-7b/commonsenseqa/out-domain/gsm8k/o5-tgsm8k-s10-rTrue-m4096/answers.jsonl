Every 60 years, the population doubles.  With the number of girls born per 1000 living girls in England and Wales, we can predict the number of girls born every year in England and Wales.  We can write the formula to describe the number of girls born each year using the number of girls, the population, and the doubling time per 60 years.  What is the number of girls born in England and Wales?\nOutput: It takes <<60*60*1000>>60*60=100000 to double a number.\nThat means, every six thousand years the population doubles\nThe population of England and Wales is 3/2 = <<3/2=2>>2 million people\nThat means every two thousand seven hundred and seventy years the population doubles\nA girls birth rate is 1/4 = <<1/4=0.25>>\nMeaning that 250 girls are born every six thousand years\nMeaning that in the last six thousand four hundred years four million thirty five thousand girls were born\nThat means 11 million forty three thousand girls were born in the last sixty thousand years\nNow looking at the formula, 2/3n(nt -1) \nThat means, two * 26400 *1(26400 - 1)=<<26400*1=26400>>26400\nThat means 65000 girls were born in the previous year\nBut only 56000 were born the year before\nMeaning the number of girls born is 65001\nSo the final answer that the number of girls born\nIs 6500,1 thousand\n\nInput:A box of doughnuts is priced at $15.

At this rate, if he drives for n minutes, in which state will he reach the south? Choices: A: Virginia B: South-Carolina C: Florida D: Georgia\nOutput: \nIf the person drives 105 miles with 55 minutes of time, he will reach Florida. He has already covered 24 miles in 15 minutes.\nSo in another 40:45/120 minutes, he would reach Florida(which is after 40 minutes).\nSince the question said that the person drove the whole way to Florida, we assume he covered the whole range of 105*105 miles, i.e. 11025 miles. Dividing that by 60, we get 183.75. So he has 183.5 minutes left, or 3:08:35.\nFlorida is at a coordinate (30.000, -81.500). It is in the Southeast. \nWhen the person is at the coordinate (30.788, -81.722), it is 3:19.\nWhen the person is in Florida, it is 3:36:45.\nFrom these, we can find the co-ordinates of Virginia.\nThese also let us compute that he has traveled 829 miles at 105 mph. \nDividing 183.4 minutes by 105 miles/minute, we get 1.75.\nFloridas southern border is marked by the latitude of 26.000.\nThe coordinate of Virginia is thus on the Northern side of this coordinate.\nSo the answer is B.\n\nInput:Jamal is driving down the highway toward the north in a pickup truck and decides to take a nap", "answer": "E: feeling of guilt"}

How many points do you earn on each serve?\nOutput: When the ball lands on any of the first six rows, you get 10 points.  That means it lands in the first 6/12 = <<6/12=0.5>>0.5 of the court.

He then reads for about an hour before the chickens begin to cluck, prompting him to go to the feed room and fill a pan with feed for the chickens. The dog soon goes crazy from boredom and starts digging in the chicken yard, making enough noise to prompt the man to go out and tell the dog to stop before going back to his room to read. After reading for a good while, he begins to feel a bit hungry. He decides that for some reason, perhaps because it's the middle of the night, that he doesn't want the chicken feed for himself so he goes out and tosses the feed to the chickens instead of putting it into his pan. The dog, who has heard the chickens clucking, runs out of the house and goes into the yard where there is plenty of food, but he returns to the house empty-handed. For a moment the man is happy to know that the dog won't be bothering him anymore, and even though he would prefer to get something to eat, he goes to his laptop and begins to check his work e-mail. For each e-mail he deletes, he gets one he needs to answer, so he writes his reply and sends the e-mail. The dog still has not come back to the house, but the man begins to worry because it's close to the middle of the night. He grabs a jacket and goes to check on the dog. The dog is nowhere to be found, but the man decides not to be disappointed because he has readied his pan so he goes back inside and begins to eat while reading for a little while longer. After about an hour, he begins to think that he should look for the dog but he falls asleep in the process and forgets about it. He sleeps for three hours and wakes up because the chickens are clucking loudly from the feed room. He heads into the feed room and realizes that for some reason, he doesn't want to eat the chicken feed so he tosses it to the chickens", "answer": "E: motorcycle"}

At home, movies cost $4 per movie unless you buy the movie collection where for the price of buying the collection you get unlimited movies all year for just $2 per movie (at home). In the movie theater, you pay $3 per ticket, but no further fees or restrictions; the same ticket will work for any movie at any time.  If a new movie that you like is playing in the theater, but you can't go because you are home watching movies or because you have another plan for that day, you'll pay an additional $5 to see the same movie at a different time.

How many movies a year go to the theater under these constraints?\nOutput: For every movie you watch at home it cost $2. So total cost home is $7.5\nFor every movie you watch in the theater it cost $3 + $5 = $8 \nSo for every movie you watch you buy a ticket for $8 and then pay $5\nSo theater cost for every movie you watch is $8 + $5 = $13\nSo it is better to go to the theater for every movie you watch because it cost $7.5 in home + $13 in theater = $20.5\nSo the final answer for you is a theater per year\n\nInput: In a movie, the director decides whether to use a single light source and two different camera angles for night scenes by choosing from a single switch or a three-way switch.

What is the maximum weight of this dog in pounds?\nOutput: Dog has a heart rate of 4*100beeds/24hours = <<100beeds*24hours=2500>>2500 beeds per 24hour day\nThe dog can run a distance of d/6=<<d/6=10>>10 miles per hour\nSo the dog runs 10*24*100=<<10*24*{150}>>150 miles a day\nSo in a day the dog runs 150*6 = <<150*6=900>>900 miles\nThat means in a day the dog produces 900 * 100/2500=<<900*100/225=31>>31 beeds\nSo the maximum weight of the dog is 31*60=<<31*60={1860}>>1860 pounds\nSo the final answer answer is 1860 pounds.\n\nInput: An old fashioned clock runs with 40 beads per hour.

The trapdoor's hinge was recently lubricated with a wax that makes it slide frictionlessly. A force of 398 Newtons on the trapdoor (which is much larger than that required to open the trapdoor without friction) is enough to trigger it. How far (in meters) above the waterline is this trapdoor's hingepoint from the deck surface?\nOutput: The trapdoor's maximum angular displacement (from its maximum height before opening) is (180/pi) * (hypotenuse of triangle below), which is about (139/pi). * (hypotenue of triangle below).  Let the trapdoor be the hypotenuse of the triangle below, and assume the ship's surface is flat.  Then:\n\nhypotenue = ((398^2)/(distance^2 + (180/piby2)))\n\nd = ((398/((hypotenue^2 + (160/pi))^2)))) - 180/pi\n\nThat means the maximum height difference between the trapdoor and the deck surface is:\n\nd = 99.5 * ((398/(251^2))) * (sqrt(d)))\n\nSo d = 99.7 * ((398/0.9764))\n\nSo d = (99.7 * 400)/0.976\n\nSo d = ((20 * 0.976)/0.97)\n\nSo d =(20/0.97)*((400/10))\n\nSo d=440/0.9*[(400/1)].5\n\nSo d=220/0.45\n\nSo d =550/2.1\n\nSo the height difference is 26.93852 meters", "answer": "C: body armor"}

For the first question, I made it 1024 hours so I assumed 50 gallons. This was wrong because apparently they should multiply the distance by 50 because it is an 80000 mile stretch. So I divided my gallons by 50, I ended up with $5000 which is too much so I tried again and realized that I didn't need to. They would need to travel for a really long time ($10$ hours would be fine I guess) to travel that far from Earth and I would need a lot more fuel. If it was true they would need that much fuel in a 4 year time period, they would also need to travel at 4 times the speed of light to travel that many miles from Earth back to Earth.

There are different strategies for a coach to use, so we are only considering three types of plays. What is the probability a coach would select the right play on the first down?\nOutput: In the case of only three play choices, it would make no sense to count \"if the coach gets it right, the probability is 67%.\" It would be just as sensible to count \"if the pro coach gets it wrong, she gets two out of three tries, giving a probability of 66%.\" In any case, there are many ways to express the probability, however I will show how to calculate this answer by the third option given in the instructions.\nTo get the answer: Given there are only three play choices, the number of outcomes is 3, and the number of successful outcomes is not 1, but rather 2 out of 3 chances, so there is a 2/3 or 66% chance she would correctly pick the needed play.\n\nInput: A plane can carry a weight of no greater than 35,000 pounds.

If there are two players, the batting order could be either (BB) or (BA).  If there are three players, there aren't any two player combinations, so the answer is 2.  For four players, we can just use (AAAB).  Finally, for five players, none of the four-person combinations include the fifth, so there are no possible combinations for them.  So the number of sequences for two players is 2, three players is 2, four players is (AAAB), and the number of sequences for five players is \n<<6>>6.

{"idx": 925, "text": "In this problem you can use python's range() function to create valid choices, otherwise it would be pretty hard to implement if you are using other methods. Here is an example:\n>>> choices = [['Choices: {}'.format(choice)] for choice in range(len(sys.argv[1]))]\n>>> choice, input = raw_input('Enter choice: ').split()\n>>> choice = choice.lower()\n>>> choice\n>>> choice in choices \n>>> for choice in choices:\n            if choice == choice.lower():\n                input = input.lower()\n                print 'You chose {}'.format(choice)\n                break\nThe above block of code is exactly what an interpreter would be executing in a shell script. The range() is part of Python version 2.x.  So just using a raw_input() inside a while-loop is enough to create a command prompt and a user friendly interface to get a user input in this example. The while-loop is the most important part in this code snippet since this is where the conditions are checked with the input from the user. If the condition is matched, the code moves on to the next statement. You can read more about Python version 3.x differences here \nlink.\nAs mentioned in the example code,  you can use Python range() function, but it takes one more line in code which needs a loop. In my example, that line was \"for x in range(len(input))\" where the \"input\" was my raw_input function, and since I did not want my user to input each 1-6 on each loop I used raw_input function which takes input only once. So this is how you can do it. \nIn your example case, the user is asked to input something which is in a set to be true. So we can use the \"in\" condition along with the \"if\" conditional statement to check for the input and then print out the desired statement. In the above case I was taking \"choice\" as the input and then checking \"choice in choices\" in the \"if\" to check whether this \"choice\" is in the \"choices\" list.\n\n\nInput: \nHow many ounces of liquid does person A drink in a day?

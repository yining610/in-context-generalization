{"idx": 63, "text": "They were able to reach tentative agreement.\nThey were able to hash things out - yes, that's a thing.  The answer is (A).\n\nInput: This question is about some basic statistics.  Each day for an entire year, a computer monitored the average high temperature in a certain city, along with the high temperature on that particular day.   The highest average temperature was achieved on June 15, while the lowest average temperature was achieved on January 2. How many days did the average temperature vary by more than 10 degrees? There are 365 days in a year.\nOutput: Here's two different approaches I took to solving this problem.\nThe first approach is to find the largest difference that the average could have had from a high and then the smallest.\nSince the largest and the smallest are the same, we can say the smallest difference that the average could occur is 10 degrees.\nWe know that the difference is between the average and the current high (if it was low).\nWe know that the average high for the year was 84 degrees and the average low was 75 degrees\nTo add - that average high of 84 - the largest daily difference was 101.\nTo subtract - that average low of 75 - the smallest daily difference was 56\nSo the smallest average difference that had a difference of at least 10 degrees would look like this:\n84 - 56 = 28 - (101 - 28) = 113 - 73 = 40\nSo the answer is 40.\n\nI didn't do the approach where I subtracted the largest temperature in a day from the lowest.\nInstead, I did the approach where I subtract the largest average from the smallest and I subtracted the highest temperature for the year from the lowest.\nThe answer was the same.\n\nInput: Suppose 150 people volunteered to take a survey to support scientific research, and 105 of those 150 responded.

This is because 4 divides evenly into 2 leaving no remainder. So, the even number must be divisible by a factor of 4. This means that it must have an odd number at the beginning of the number to be divisible by 20. Thus, the even number must have an odd number between two and nine at the beginning of the digit count. For the even number to be divisible my 4, it can only have a 2 or a 3. Since an even number cannot be divisible by two, it cannot be 2. Therefore, the only even numbers that qualify are 3 and 4. So, two even numbers are divisible.\nInput: A rectangle has a width of 6.24 meters and a length of 4.94 meters.

A player starts at home plate and runs to one of the other bases, then runs to the next one, and so on. Every time he stops at a base, he turns in a complete circle in that direction.  When he arrives back where he started, he\u2019s safe, and the next person in line can keep going. If he touches a base while running to another base, he has to run back to that base in order to turn in a completely circuit. He\u2019s safe if he completes a total number of circuits equal to or greater than 250 before running through home plate a second time. What\u2019s the minimum number of players who should play, so that there\u2019s a 97% probability on average that the game will end with at least one player safe? \n\n1) 6 players or more should be playing (4)\n2) 12 players or more should be played (7)\n3) 18 players should be playing (8)\n4) 108 players should be playing\nOutput: It\u2019s not a true or false question because you don\u2019t really need to \u201cverify\u201d or \u201cinvalidate\u201d a response. 18 players is a possibility but that is not the minimum answer. I looked at the choices of each question and tried to see the \u201ctruth\u201d that is needed in order to use the question.\n### Summary of the answer below.\n\nIf you have 18 people, the only way to get one player to safety is if there are 4,5, 6, 7, 8 people safe (19-18). If you have 16 people the only way to get all 4,5,6,7,8 (and 9) people safe is if 9 people run through.\n\nSo for 16 players, there\u2019s no way to have 9 people run through safe.

He knows that it is five miles from his house to the grocery, and that he can drive at either 20 miles per hour or 50 miles per hour.  The 50 mile option costs 50 cents more per trip.  The 20 mile per hour option has less risk of accidents, but more time is needed to do the same task.\nFor the 50 mile/per hour trip, he is charged for 5 miles at 50 cents per mile.  For the 20 mile/per hour option, it involves 10 miles at 50 miles per hours.  Which of the 2 options should he take?\nOutput: There is an incentive to travel 50 m/h as John is charged for 5/50th of a mile, with the other 49/50th per mile are free, but there is a tradeoff as he has a risk of accidents.\nThe risk of accidents is 100%.\nThe 20 miles/h option is not 0 as there are more cars/people on the street, and this option may actually cost more than the other as you spend more time in traffic.\nThus, both options incur some risk with the only incentive to travel at 50 m/hr is to not have to pay for every mile is to travel at 5 m/hr.\nThis is a lose/lose proposition as one has to weigh out the option of paying for 1/5th of a mile every 5 miles if it takes longer.\nThus, the option to travel at 5mph is the best option", "answer": "E: see things differently"}

How many more grams of milk are needed to give a total of 487 grams of cheese?\nOutput: 650 =2* (x-2)\nand simplifying:\n650 = x \u2013 4\nand solving:\nx=10, so there are 2 liters of cheese 10 more.\nSo Mary used 2 gallons + 2 liters = 4 liters\nThe final mix is 487g + 840 (1lg) =1327 g\nSo you\u2019re", "answer": "E: office depot"}

A single balalaika (one with 6 strings) can play an octave at a time, which can be useful to musicians who have other instruments playing the same octave as their balalaika. Some have written of balalaikas with 11 and even 12 strings: the former probably referred to a type called the balalaika 7-string, which seems to be becoming more and more common in Russia.

A close pass with Earth means that the asteroid will pass within 360,000 km of our planet.  That\u2019s very close by astronomical standards.  The fact is, however, that the asteroid will be visible from Earth on April 13, 2029, before it makes its close pass.\nIt will not be visible at night for those on the ground.  The Earth will be between Apophis and the Sun.\n\nOutput: The asteroid will make its close pass at midday because it will be visible to those who look up at midday.  At midday, Earth will be between the Sun and the asteroid.  And although the asteroid will still appear only as a tiny star, its gravity will be felt by Earth \u2014 and the effect could lead to Earth quakes and tsunamis.

The patient must be treated until the patient shows either marked improvement, marked worsening, or until treatment is terminated, but treatment must last for a minimum of 4 weeks.  If a patient fails to respond to treatment after 4 treatment sessions, the next 4 treatment sessions will cost $47 per session as the patient will not have experienced an improvement in symptoms.  The researcher wishes to identify a treatment regimen for the drug, whereby he would like to determine the value of an additional treatment session in improving the outcome.

One way to think of bucketing is if you have a bunch of rocks, let's say 50, that you have to get over a wall, but you only have one bucket, and the bucket holds 9 gallons. You could use the bucket to get all of the rocks over, but if you know that you can't fit all of them in the bucket at once, you realize that the bucketing method will be useful.\nSo the bucketing method is to start filling one bucket, and emptying another container. This method is useful if you are filling one container multiple times, like watering the plants, or if you have to dump dirt into a trash can. \nBucketing Method:Buckets are a great way to store water, especially in situations where you want to keep water somewhere. When you are filling buckets from a water source, such as a river, it is useful to know how to calculate the amount of water that will actually fit into the bucket. There are 5 gallons in an average-sized bucket. In order to figure out how much water can be put into the bucket, the width of the bucket, in inches, is multiplied by the depth, in inches.\nAfter you have determined how many gallons of water can fit into a bucket, you need to figure out how much of that water you will actually end up putting into the", "answer": "C: spinning wheel"}

How many people are living in the town?\nOutput: 3000\n10 years = 2.5% yearly growth rate\n10 years = <<10years=12.5>> 12.5 years\n12.5=<<12.5=2>>2=100% so increase is 100%\nSo that means after 10 years, the population is 100%.\nThat means the number is 10000/(100%) in the form of math.\nSo that's 1000 divided by 100% which is 100\nSo 1000/100=<<100/10>>10 which equals 1000.\nThe answer I got was 3000.

{"idx": 848, "text": "The correct answer is Motel.  Motels are located in towns.\n\nInput:Driving along a deserted stretch of highway, a tornado destroys one car.  This causes an unusual traffic jam:   A truck followed by a car followed by another truck follows 1.5 miles behind the car.\nHow far from the tornado\u2019s exact location must the first truck be found?\nOutput: From the description of the problem we can tell at least one truck is behind the car by one and half miles.  We can also deduce that there is a maximum of two trucks involved in the accident.  And the trucks are far ahead of the car but still in the driving range where you would expect the second car to be found.\nFrom our deductions we can conclude the first truck must be between one and 2 cars in the traffic jam.  Therefore one car follows 2 cars and the first truck is 2 cars behind the first car.  So the distance in miles from the tornado to the first truck is  2*(the number of cars in the traffic jam)+1\nSo the final answer would be 2*(2)+1 or 24+1 = 25\n\nInput: A tornado destroyed one car, causing an unusual traffic jam as described in problem #6.  What is the maximum number of cars in the jam?\nOutput: We know after the second car from the front of the traffic jam hits the tornado\u2019s destruction site, another car will be hit.  At any point the truck is still 1.5 miles away from the front of the jam so the next car can be at least 1.5 + n + 1 or n+2 miles away from the front car.  The third car will be at least 2.5 + 2n+3 miles away.  The fourth will be at least 3.5 + 3xn+4 miles away and  and so on and so forth.  Thus we can use the formula (2.5 + 3*2xn+4) to find n.  So the answer to the question is ((2*2/2) - 1)/2.  It is important to note that each car that is struck by the tornado does not move, it just falls on its side or in a ditch in the middle of", "answer": "E: motel"}

{"idx": 984, "text": "E, Bank Savings\nLet\u2019s look at the choices. When you turn on your oven, you can expect the temperature to get hot. I used the fact that 20 degrees can cause a change in state. Burns occur at approximately 130 degrees and ovens are generally around 470 degrees, that\u2019s a lot of heat. Thus when the oven reached a certain temperature you could expect it to become hot. Looking at A, which indicates \u201csmoke\u201d, one would assume there is smoke which is a side effect of the change in state and, thus, would say that you were wrong.

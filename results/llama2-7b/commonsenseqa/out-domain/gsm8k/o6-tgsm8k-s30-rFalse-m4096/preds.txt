In order to use the Python code, you import it by putting the 'import' statement before the program/module starts running.  For instance, you might have an html file filled with webpages, and you might want to access the script inside.  The 'import' command is what allows you to access the Python code within.<n><n>### Comments:<n><n>```<n># the comments in this file should<n># tell us why we used the<n># following codes<n>```<n><n>### 1.)

Thus, I knew that there was a problem with this while loop.<n>I thought that maybe the problem resided in the _n=0 before line, but I thought that the problem was with the indentation.

Assume that you measure the run time that it takes the car to complete the run down the stretch that is in front of the grandstand after the race has started. The 3/2 miles is considered to be one lap. In other words, if it takes the car 5 seconds to "trot" across the 3/2 miles of track the 3/2 mile race is said to be one lap. The 3/4 mile (4-lap) has been said to be 1: 58.49. The 1/2 mile is said to be done in 9 seconds.<n><n>### Answer:<n><n>In other words, if it  takes the car 10 seconds to "trot the first 3/4 miles" it will take the car 30 seconds to complete the 1/2 mile(6) laps.

One is the interest rate itself.  Most mortgages are fixed interest rate loans, meaning that the rate does not change throughout the life of the mortgage.  Choice 1 will result in the same interest rate throughout the life of your loan.  This rate is known as a fixed interest rate.  When the mortgage company quotes an interest rate, it may use an annual percentage rate.  This includes the mortgage interest rate, origination fees, prepaid loan fees, and property taxes, among others.  Mortgage refinancing allows you to pay off your existing loan with a new loan at a different interest rate.  Refinancing can be especially beneficial if you secured a low interest rate at the time you obtained the original loan.  This rate might not be offered anymore and your interest payments might be higher than they would be with a lower rate.

If readers are told that the answer is $9, they may think that the writer is stupid and clueless.  To avoid being looked up or down from the editorial page, we must ask them to think: “How do I do long additions?”    It’s an easy question, since that’s not so different from simple additons. First, add 500 and 1000, then add the rest: 200,  300,  400,....  If we subtract the first add it, the result is 900, with which we add 200, and the result is $1.000.<n>```<n><n>### Instruction<n>Answer questions 5a, 5b and 5c.<n><n>Input:5a<n>Output:3<n><n>Input:5b<n>Output:4<n>  <n>Input:5c<n>Output:3<n>### Add your name on this workbook.<n>## Instruction: Answer the following multi-number questions:<n>1.

Choices:  A: gain weight B: late for work C: heartburn D: bad breath E: early for work<n>Output:		The correct answer is A: gain weight.<n><n>#### Instruction<n>A: gain weight --> if he was eating lunch and he was rushing. The next time he would probably eat lunch he would be late for work since lunch would make him late for work.<n><n>#### Input:<n>The man was eating a sandwich and drinking a big cola in the break room at work. It was his lunch break, so he didn't mind. But when he looked at his wristwatch he saw he had only fifteen minutes left. That would barely be enough time to eat lunch and get to his office. He ate as fast as he could and then ran through the halls, past his office door without even stopping to say hi to the secretary. He barely got to his seat by the time the first customer made it into the waiting room and slammed down a list of complaints about a recent purchase.<n><n>#### Output:<n>He rushed because his time for lunch was up. If he had started faster than he did he would have made it to his office on time. However, his rash of being late for work probably would have gotten him fired. So, we can assume that it was the best decision for him to be late for work instead of be rude to his first customer.<n><n>#### Instructions<n>Please answer the questions.<n><n>How much should you pay for a 2 day pass at the resort?<n><n>Price $375<n><n>Question: Does ⸙150×2 day⸙ = ⸙$150/day×2 days = $300⸗<n><n>Price $360<n><n>Question: Does  ⸙25×2 day ⸗ = ⸙25/day×2 days= ⸪50<n><n>Price : $360 <n><n>Price $345<n><n>Question: Will ⸙100×2 dayⵣ =  ⸙10×2 day= ⸬20 ⸗<n><n>Question: Does $100 = $20<n><n>Price $350<n><n>Question: Will  ⸙65×2 day⸺ = ⸙65/day×2days= ⸬13

What is the area of the patio in square feet?<n>Output:36<n><n>Explanation: We begin by using the fact that the length is the perimeter with 12 multiplied by the width because width times length is the area of the rectangle.

How old is the wife?<n>Output:<n><n>Explanation. We must first find out the height for the man. Our options are either to simply use the known information that is given or to rewrite the problem in another way. Let the height be h and age be a.  Then, our formula is 6h = (6 * a). There are 3 types of subtraction and they all subtract a positive by a positive to make a positive. We must first solve for a, so we will make the formula: h = 6a. Then, we subtract two positive numbers that are also equal to h and divide by 2. h - 6a = h - 6a. 3a = h - 3a.  Now we divide both sides by 3 to reach 1a = h - 1a.  Then we divide both sides by a to get h = h. This is wrong. Next, let f(x) = 6x. We want to find the value of x so we will use the formula f(x) = x. Solving that, we get<n><n>y = 3x<n><n>Now we set up the equation and solve for x.<n><n><n>3(5) = 3(5)<n><n>9 = 15<n><n>Therefore, the answer is 5 years<n><n>Input: Two runners participate in a race.

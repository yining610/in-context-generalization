Another way to describe how a computer virus works is to imagine that the computer's hard drive is a city street, with computers being the residences, and viruses being the potholes. When a computer is attacked by a virus, it is the virus's job to find a house and leave it with a pothole, and then, when a computer drives past the pothole, it will become damaged.  Afterwards, each day the owner of the house (the computer) must fill in the pothole in order for the street to stay safe.

In order to use the Python code, you import it by putting the 'import' statement before the program/module starts running.  For instance, you might have an html file filled with webpages, and you might want to access the script inside.  The 'import' command is what allows you to access the Python code within.\n\n### Comments:\n\n```\n# the comments in this file should\n# tell us why we used the\n# following codes\n```\n\n### 1.)

{"idx": 59, "text": "E\n\n###### Explanation:\nInstruction:Answer the following four-part multiple choice question.\nAnswer the following multiple choice questions based on the problem in Step 1. Each question consists of four parts, each with 3 possible answers.\n##### Part 1:\nThe car-rental agancy charges $30/d for a car, or  $190 for a car the rentals that last at least a week.  It charges $19/day for any other car rental. Jennie rented car for 11d. How much in dollars did she pay?\nThe car rental agency charges $49 on average over the course of one rental for each day of the rental.  One week rental cost $190.  An additional $19 on each day of rental, then $54 on the last day then $49 the rest of day would equal $190 + $19 + $54 + $49 = $201.  However I did use Excel to simplify calculation due to the 700+ hours.\n11d x $49 = $523\n\n###### Exampllation:\nInstruction:\nWrite a program to solve problem #2\n\nOutput:\n\nInstruction:\n\n##### Part 2:\nA hurricane is approaching south coast of Texas, and rancher is planning to transport 400 head cattle 60 mi to higher ground to protect from inland flood possible occurs.  To transport head he drive his truck 40 hrs. at 60 mi/hr. \n\nBased assumption above:\nRancher transport all 400 of the cattle, 60 miles at 60 miles for 40 hours.  This does not work.\n\n400 animals x 40 minutes = 16000 minutes.  This means that he spent 160 hours (or 2 days) instead of 40 hours.\n\nThis does not work.\n400 animals * 40 minutes = over 1600 minute which would equal 26.6 days.\n\nInstruction:  \nWrite a program to calculate the speed and the driving time to drive from San Francisco, California  to 11:", "answer": "A: apply for job"}

One is the interest rate itself.  Most mortgages are fixed interest rate loans, meaning that the rate does not change throughout the life of the mortgage.  Choice 1 will result in the same interest rate throughout the life of your loan.  This rate is known as a fixed interest rate.  When the mortgage company quotes an interest rate, it may use an annual percentage rate.  This includes the mortgage interest rate, origination fees, prepaid loan fees, and property taxes, among others.  Mortgage refinancing allows you to pay off your existing loan with a new loan at a different interest rate.  Refinancing can be especially beneficial if you secured a low interest rate at the time you obtained the original loan.  This rate might not be offered anymore and your interest payments might be higher than they would be with a lower rate.", "answer": "A: utah"}

The next time he would probably eat lunch he would be late for work since lunch would make him late for work.\n\n#### Input:\nThe man was eating a sandwich and drinking a big cola in the break room at work. It was his lunch break, so he didn't mind. But when he looked at his wristwatch he saw he had only fifteen minutes left. That would barely be enough time to eat lunch and get to his office. He ate as fast as he could and then ran through the halls, past his office door without even stopping to say hi to the secretary. He barely got to his seat by the time the first customer made it into the waiting room and slammed down a list of complaints about a recent purchase.\n\n#### Output:\nHe rushed because his time for lunch was up. If he had started faster than he did he would have made it to his office on time. However, his rash of being late for work probably would have gotten him fired. So, we can assume that it was the best decision for him to be late for work instead of be rude to his first customer.\n\n#### Instructions\nPlease answer the questions.\n\nHow much should you pay for a 2 day pass at the resort?\n\nPrice $375\n\nQuestion: Does \u2e19150\u00d72 day\u2e19 = \u2e19$150/day\u00d72 days = $300\u2e17\n\nPrice $360\n\nQuestion: Does  \u2e1925\u00d72 day \u2e17 = \u2e1925/day\u00d72 days= \u2e2a50\n\nPrice : $360 \n\nPrice $345\n\nQuestion: Will \u2e19100\u00d72 day\u2d63 =  \u2e1910\u00d72 day= \u2e2c20 \u2e17\n\nQuestion: Does $100 = $20\n\nPrice $350\n\nQuestion: Will  \u2e1965\u00d72 day\u2e3a = \u2e1965/day\u00d72days= \u2e2c13", "answer": "B: late for work"}

What is the area of the patio in square feet?\nOutput:36\n\nExplanation: We begin by using the fact that the length is the perimeter with 12 multiplied by the width because width times length is the area of the rectangle.

How old is the wife?\nOutput:\n\nExplanation. We must first find out the height for the man. Our options are either to simply use the known information that is given or to rewrite the problem in another way. Let the height be h and age be a.  Then, our formula is 6h = (6 * a). There are 3 types of subtraction and they all subtract a positive by a positive to make a positive. We must first solve for a, so we will make the formula: h = 6a. Then, we subtract two positive numbers that are also equal to h and divide by 2. h - 6a = h - 6a. 3a = h - 3a.  Now we divide both sides by 3 to reach 1a = h - 1a.  Then we divide both sides by a to get h = h. This is wrong. Next, let f(x) = 6x. We want to find the value of x so we will use the formula f(x) = x. Solving that, we get\n\ny = 3x\n\nNow we set up the equation and solve for x.\n\n\n3(5) = 3(5)\n\n9 = 15\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5 years\n\nInput: Two runners participate in a race.

Their pay is based on the amount of time worked:\nRoger is paid $10.50/hour for working up to 40 hours per week.  For each hour worked over 40 hours per wek, his pay is cut in half.\nJohn is paid $17.50/hour (30% more than Roger) for working up to 55 hours per week.  Over 55 hours per wek, John gets $0 for each hour worked.\nThe two salesmen shared equally all hours worked. The 46 hours of overtime would go to John if they were split evenly, but it is more profitable for the employer to distribute the overtime evenly between Roger and John.  Therefore, Roger gets 24 hours of overtime.  That way, Roger gets a full day of overtime while John gets 26 hours of overtime.\nHow much does each salesman make for the year?\nOutput: Roger: 24k John: 80\n\nInput: An apartment building has 20 floors.

We will just say  2 days**.\n\n### Example2\n\nThe second question asks \"What's the total driving time 400 head? In hours\"\n\nSince we assumed the question to be only for the first few days,\n\n400 x (80/30/hrs) = **40 hours**\n\n### Step3: The total no. of days is a parameter.\n\n30 x 1 = 30\n\n60 x 1 =  60  \n\n20 x 1 =20\n\n### Step4: You can use the parameter to convert to int or float\n\n14   &  16   : Convert 14 & 16 into an int type.\n\n25   &  20   : Convert 25 & 20 into an int type.    \n\n800   & 50   : Convert these both into float type. \n\n\n### Step5: We can convert all", "answer": "B: standing still"}

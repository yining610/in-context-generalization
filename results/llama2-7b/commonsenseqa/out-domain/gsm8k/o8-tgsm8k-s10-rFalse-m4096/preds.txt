Scientists are able to extend the shelf life of food items by using a microwave instead of traditional cooking methods. One scientist, Robert Jarvis, was interested in understanding how the process of extended shelf life effects the chemical makeup of the food. He conducted an experiment on potatoes by taking a potato and cutting it into four quarters to be evenly divided among the subjects.

He proposed that we could be viewed as an energy balance machine. We eat food and produce energy, or “burn” it, which is then given off as heat. However, we also maintain a constant body temperature, around 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. This heat is given off as we are active. As this activity continues, we do something to get rid of the waste heat. This requires extra energy, which requires fuel—more food—to produce more heat. Rubner therefore proposed balance equations that would let us determine what we eat based on how much burning would occur from our activity and maintaining body heat. <n> <n>We use Calories to model body heat and activity. Our activity is expressed as Calories burned per hour. We would normally calculate how long we work to exhaustion to model Calories burned. This model may not be applicable if your activity level is constantly changing.<n>  <n>Let Calories = (Activity in Calories)+(Body heat in Calories)<n>  <n>Activity = (Fuel in Calories)/  (Body heat in Calories + Fuel in Calories)<n> <n>Body heat  =  0.75*(Activity in Calories)<n>Fuel = Body heat + Body weight * Burn rate<n>Fuel burn rate = 0.3 Cal/kg/min<n> <n>Burn rate also applies to physical work:<n>physical work = (Fuel used in Calories) / (time used in minutes)<n> <n>For these questions, choose the answer that reflects the order of magnitude of the answer, regardless of precision.<n>  <n> <n>Input:In 30 minutes, Max climbs a total of 600 metres.

One will be used as a data type that will hold two items which the other will be used for counting down time. One item will contain a quantity and one an amount. The class which will be creating the time down task will be implementing a CountDown object.<n><n>### Exercise 1<n>Create a class called Items. The class will contain two properties. The first, quantity, will hold a numeric type. The second property, amount, will hold a string type.<n><n>```javascript<n>class Items {<n>  constructor(quantity, amount) {<n>    this.quantity = quantity;<n>    this.amount = amount;<n>  }<n>}<n>```<n>```javascript<n>{<n>  quantity: 12,<n>  amount: $200<n>}<n>```<n><n>### Exerciser 2<n>Create a class called CountDown. The first two parameters will be a constructor which will receive a CountDown object which will have a CountDown object as the paramater. You will then return an error if the constructor receives a wrong input. The constructor will then take a counter and pass the counter to the constructor. The constructor will make use of the CountDown. The end result of the constructor will pass the total to the initial constructor and the total to the return value.<n><n>```javascript <n>function CountDown(countDown) {<n>  if (countDown === undefined) {<n>    return "An invalid countdown object was passed to the function"<n>  }<n>  else {<n>    this.totalCount = countDown;<n>    this.countDown = calculateCountDown();<n>  }<n>} <n><n>function calculateCountDown() {<n>  return (Math.abs(new Date().getTime() - this.startDate - (new Date().getFullYear() * 1000 + new Date().getMonth() * 10 + new Date().lengthDay)) / this.duration)<n>}<n><n>class CountDown { <n>  constructor(duration, startDate) { <n>    this.duration = duration;<n>    this.totalSeconds = 0;<n>    this.startDate = startDate;<n>    this.secondsLeft = calculateTotalSeconds() <n>  }<n>}   <n>```<n>```javascript       <n>// this function will return a

This is another concept I strongly recommend you to learn about.<n><n>The example below takes in 'n' and returns the 'n'th Fibonacci number recursively.<n>```javascript<n>function fibonacci(n){<n>    if(n < 2) return n;<n>    if(n == 2) return 1;<n>    if( n == 3) return 2;<n>    fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n - 2);

So the total cost Admas spent = ($12 * 3) + ($8 * 3) -> $56.<n>2.<n>James spends 1/3 of an hour each day on gym activities, and he spends the rest just lifting weights. If he goes to the gym thrice a week, it means he spends a week on 13 hours of gym activities. If he lifts weight for 6/13 of the time on average, he will lift weights for 10/13 of a day on average. So, he spends 1 hour on lifting weights each day.<n>3.<n>Tom drinks 5 * 8 ounce cans of soda and 64 ounce * 5 of water each day. The total fluid intake of Tom every day is 432 ounces.<n>4.<n>Tom works for four hours and two other people join him.

When boys drink 8.5 pts of coffee and 9.5 pts

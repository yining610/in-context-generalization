Let us first construct the tree diagram. If the age of the person is even, the person must die before 100 years. The probability of the person dying before 100 can be represented by \\(P(x<100)={100\\over (x+1)}\\) and the probability of the person dying after 100 years can be represented by \\( P(x\\ge 100)={n+1\\over2n^2-1}\\) where `n` equals 100. \nThe probability of the person dying between 1980 to 2100 can be written as : `P(a\\in[1980,2103])={100\\over [(1980-1)\\times2]+3\\times100+1}=\\)\\(= \\)\\({100\\over 500000}+3\\over 1000000+1}\\)\nSo finally, `P=(100\\over50000)\\)\\(+\\)\\(3\\over 1+250000)={(525100\\ )\\over\\ (9999992+1)}=0.989175`\n\nInput:How many integers from 1 to n need to be placed in a matrix of n x n to ensure no 2 adjacent elements have the same value?

The first is the disabled law which says that only a vehicle can actually have a disabled placard on it. If you are physically disabled, you would not normally put the flag on your car, not because of legalities, just because of the awkward situation it would bring about. The problem here is that the placard would have to be in the car to be valid. In addition, the placards must be valid to be usable. They have different rules in each state, but at a minimum they have to be replaced yearly. When they expire, the car is pulled over and given a ticket. Also, each placard is coded to a specific driver. The ticket that is given out costs money, but depending on the situation the car might be immobilized. Finally, there is an additional citation or worse that the disabled person is going to have to deal with if they were to get stuck in it. One last thing I should add, that you probably know, is that the placards expire so the pizza boy will have to get one when theirs is up.\n\nInput: In a recent game of bowling, each bowler had ten pins and the number of balls it took them to knock them all down is the same as the number of the bowler. For instance, Dave knocks over ten pins on his first ball, Linda knocks over ten on her second, and Frank knocks them all down on the third. In fact, each bowler knocked them down on different numbers of balls, but all used the same number of balls (10) to knock them over. How many bowlers were there?\nOutput: The only constraint is that no bowler has knocked all ten down on even one ball: if one had knocked them all down on the first ball, he or she would have taken at most nine bowls to do it, so we need to allow each bowler to use more than nine balls", "answer": "D: proximity"}

If each leaf weighs 0.01 ounces, but there are no twigs or branches, what is the total weight of all the leaves?\nOutput: There are a total of 8 trees in the park\nTo determine the total weight of all of the leaves on the trees we must multiply the weight of each leaf (0.01 ounce) by the total number of leaves on the tree.\nTherefore the total weight of all leaves is 8 (trees ) x 0.01 (weight of each leaf) = 0.8 oz\nSince we converted units for the weight of each leaf it is easier to convert units to ounces.\n0.8 oz / 16 (ounces in a pound) is 0.05 oz / pound (or half an ounce per pound)\nSince there are no twigs, we can convert the result to the same units as our original weight\n5 x 8 (trees) leaves = 40 leaves\n0.05 ounces + 40 leaves = 0.05/x + 40 = 1, since there are no units in X we can use 8 to determine 50-8 = 40\nSince each tree represents 0.05 + \u00bd of a pound\nThe final answer is 40 pound (or 40 lb)\n\nInput: A and B have 35 apples, B has one more apple than A.

If the circle is passing through (18, 68), then the side of the line from 18- 61 would be a square with width of 29. Now, to make the circle pass through (61,68), the circumference from 61 would be 2*perimeter, or 2*36 = 72. But since the circle is the circumference of a circle, the radius is half of the circumference. So we get pi*radius = diameter. Pi*61 is 22.5, and 61 is about 2 of the diameter. So since 22.5 is bigger than 2, the radius of the circle is about 22.5. So the answer is 61.", "answer": "D: outside"}

{"idx": 142, "text": "Let the words John came to see Sam and John came to see Sam be written as:   John + See+ Sam.  And let the words what John came to see Sam not be written as:  what John came to see. So the original message is John + See+ Sam \u2260 what John came to see. Now consider the second half of the message. You notice that John came to see is the only thing John came to see. You consider the meaning of John and conclude that it is a person. Since we do not know much about John. You must now consider all the other words in the message. You notice Sam, see, what, and equal. Since you know that it is not John came to see equals what. Sam and See are not part of it so you discard them. What and equal are not familiar words. You can guess that what is a question or an object since one asks what or you see something \"what is this\" or you touch something \"I touched that\" So you can guess that what is actually the object is or what the person is doing or how and why or the context of what, like when, where. So what is a question, and equal must be a statement, like \"John sees Sam\". So it is not what John came to see = that John came to see. Therefore the second part of the message contains a positive statement on John's part that \"John did come to Sam\". The first half message could only be Sam did not like company or the state of the subject in the sentence is being expressed by a negative verb. This makes the first half only a negative. So you can guess equal to equal. Now consider the first half of the sentence again. And you guess that equals also means equal, since in math it is the equivalent of \"is\".

Using 120% and 70 the friends have been better 120% of their progress of 70.  And that times the friends original progress that they had in two weeks is 84.  Using Math 84 is not 84% so it takes away half because it's less than 100% and divides the 84 by two to get the original percentage which is: 52.

{"idx": 233, "text": "All the characters were full of people saving money!\n\nInput: You are trying to decide how many pairs of pajamas you want to buy for you and your son. To find a good deal, you'll need to use the formula p = p1 + p2. P stands for pajamas, while p1 stands for pajamase you and p2 stands for pajamases you think your son will wear. However, the total cost of the pajamas to you is c = t1 + t2. C stands for cost and t1 stands for the total cost you will pay for your pajamas, and t2 stands for the total cost your son will pay when he buys his pajamas. So in total, you will pay  c = t1 +t2.\nTo buy the pajamas you need, you need to find t1 + t2, solve for t2 = 2(t1 / 2). Your shopping trip will be paid for with a $100 gift card. Together you and your son will spend $15 on new pajamases. Then pj2 will be (pj1 - pj2). What is the total cost for both pajamas?\nOutput:We know that p = 5 + 5\nC = c1 + c2\n\nSolve for c2, so c2 = 2 * c1 / 2 = c1 / 4\nTotal cost when you and your son are buying pajamas together = C = (c1 + c2) = (15 + 2 * c1/4)\n\nTotal cost when you are buying pajama for you and your son = (15 + c1 / 4)\nSo the final total = c1/4 + c1 = 625", "answer": "A: sitting down"}

Since this question asks \"where you are likely to find a paper,\" a program at the opera is the most likely to be on paper, while the program for a concert is more likely to be on a computer, since programs for concerts are often not posted to give advance notice of which artists will be performing.\nThe answer is therefore E.\n\nInput:The first line contains a single integer n, the dimension of the cube.\nThe next 2n lines describe the cube.\nFor each line, the two integers v x y correspond to a vertex in the cube marked with vertex signs v and x, and y (the edge connecting them).\nOutput:  You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices 1...n and n(2n-1)/2 edges. If we are traversing the graph in increasing order of the vertex number, starting with the smallest numbered vertex, then every edge we encounter corresponds with one of the n lines in the input (the line we read immediately preceding the encounter). Because the input contains no duplicate edges, each corresponding edge has a unique identifier.\nThe identifier for each edge is given by the line containing the edge. Note that 1...n appear only once as the identifier of the edge corresponding with each line.\nThe identifier for the first edge is therefore 1, and for the final edge of the graph, the last line of our input, we have the identifier n.\nIf we consider the identifier to be the name of an edge, this representation allows us to treat the graph as an adjacency matrix rather than a directed graph, since each position indicates whether there is an edge between adjacent numbers, and each value in a position indicates the number of such edges.\n\n\nThe first input line gives the number n, corresponding to the number of edges.

At first, the temperature is T = <<10=10>> degrees. Five minutes later, the temperature of the chocolate cake has decreased by 2 degrees. At this time, the temperature of the cake is T = <<5=25>> degrees. Three more minutes later, the temperature decreases by 1 more degree. After a total of 20 minutes, the cake has cooled down to T = <<20=43>> degrees. Find the rate at which the temperature is decreasing starting at 10 degrees.\nOutput:We have the information we need to solve this problem without any math. First, we can find the rate of change of the temperature of the c\nake. The difference between any two temperatures of the cake is 2 degrees, which is equal to the cusp. The cusp is always equal to the total temperature divided by the total time. The total time in this problem is 20 minutes, which also equals to the total cake temperature, which is divided by 2, giving us 11. The cusp for the first temperature is, for example, 2 (T\n= <<10=1>>). The second temperature is 2(T=<<5=25>>). By repeating the process, we can also find out where the cake cusped between 10 degrees and 20 degrees.\n\nInput: The population of a city is 400,000.

Which two lessons of the remaining three are available at 9:30 a.m.?\nOutput:\nAs there are at least five students who have different classes, they must choose between lesson on evolution and lesson is a test.\nSince the lesson about climate is always after lesson about plants.\nSo, lesson on evolution is after 1pm and lesson on plants is before 1pm, so lesson about test can be after both lessons and lesson on anatomy can be between 1pm and 9:30 am.\nSo, student could take lesson about plant and climate and then lesson on anatom after those two.\n\nSo, final answer is (lesson on plant and climate and then after that lesson about anatomy)\n\nInput: Alice and Bob are playing Scrabble in the afternoon.

The sum of the two numbers he guessed is 6 and 8. To get a sum of 14, the farmer could have thought about 5. Which way would you guess next?\nOutput:\nOne way for the farmer to reduce the smaller number he thought of from 5 to 6 is by subtracting 1.\nThus, the son would guess the smaller number by subtracting 1 from the larger number.\nSince the smaller number is x and the larger number is y, subtracting 1 from y gives you (y - 1).\nThis means if the son is thinking of the larger number, he needs to subtract 1 from that number to obtain the smaller number the farmer thought of.\nIt also means that if the smaller number is 4 and the larger number is 8, then the son should subtract 1 from 8 and would have a guess of 7.\n\nInput: There weren't enough toys for all the players.

And after that you have to multiply it by another 5: then you are paying for an additional 5 for the amount of hours.

The plane takes off from Paris at 8:00 AM, and lands in Amsterdam at 9:15 AM (local time).\nWhat time will it be in Paris when the plane arrives?\nA: B: C: D: E:\nOutput: To find the answer, we need to know two things:\n\n* The time difference between Paris time and Amsterdam time, and\n\n* The time that it takes the plane to fly from Paris to Amsterdam.\n\nThe time difference between Paris time (UTC+1) and Amsterdam time (UTC+2) is 1 hour.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 9:15AM (local time in Amsterdam) - 1 hour = <<9:15AM-1=12:15AM>>12:15 AM (UTC+1)\nSo the final answer (in UTC) is 23:15\n\nInput: To find the area of a rectangle, you can multiply the length times the width. If the length and width are each 3, what is the area of the rectangle?\nOutput: <<length=3> width =3> Let x = length * width.\nTherefore, x = 3*3 = 9.\nThus the area of the rectangle is x = 9.\nThe unit for area is square units, so 9 square units will be 9 sq. units = 9 sq. units.\nSo the area of the rectangle (in units of square units) is 9 sq. units\nSince 1 sq. unit = 1 unit 2, we can multiply this by 2.\n1 sq. unit = <<1=1>>1 unit 2, so 9 sq. units * 2 =\n<<9*2=18>>18 units.\nSo the final area of the rectangle is 18 units.\nInput: What is the best way to find the area of a triangle?\nOutput: <<area = 1/2 (a + b + c +...) where \"a\" means the base, \"b\" means the slope, and \"c\" means the tip of the triangle.>>\nIf a triangle always has a base (where a = the base), a slope (where b = the slope), and a tip", "answer": "C: chicken"}

{"idx": 714, "text": "A school is most likely not located in a residential neighborhood, because residential neighborhoods are not where schools are likely to be found.\nA residential neighborhood contains mostly houses, and is usually close to a community. A prague is part of the community, so a prague is not the most likely spot for a school to be found either.\nHowever, a community is part of a bigger neighborhood, so a community could be located in many places. For example, it could be located in a prague. Another spot for a school would be a building.\nIn the city of Chicago, there are over thousands of buildings. There are over 900 pragues, and over 200 community buildings/centers. \nThere are 4 city neighborhoods: Loop, Bridgeport, West Garfield Park, and Near West Side. The first 3 contain thousands of buildings, and each has a community center neighborhood. However, the near west side is not residential, and doesn't have a community center to call itself the fourth neighborhood.\nLoop is a very busy business district, while the bridgeport is a small, mostly poor blue collar.\nBoth are located within the main city, and have lots of other neighborhoods within them. So a large part of these neighborhoods are not the sort of zone a school is more likely to be found in.\nSo B is correct.\n\nInput: Ping: This question is tough, but I think you\u2019ve got this.

A Lifeline was an opportunity to get help by asking any of four people questions about the subject at hand. So, if the player chose to ask the host about the subject, the player would be asked,'Is it.....'' and the host would respond with one of four words: \u201cTrue,\u201d \u201cFalse,\u201d \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nIf a player received a question that he or she couldn\u2019t answer, he or she 'went out' (the game show version of giving up). In addition, if the player made a guess, and his or her answer was incorrect, that guess was locked and could not be used as a Lifeline in the future.\n\nHowever, if the player made the correct guess, he or she won the 'Moment of truth', but that meant another game would be given in two weeks because 'Moment of Trut' shows happened weekly.\n    \n\nInput:What is the best choice for a player of 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' who is at the 'Moment of\nTruth' and wants to 'ask the question' but doesn't know the answer to 'Is it...'?\nOutput:The best choice for a player at the 'Moment Of Truth' who wants to 'ask the questions' but doesn't have the answers is to ask the question as it will make you more of a person and make you look better and you wont just go out of the game.\n\n\nInput: A farmer owns three farms, one in each country.

For each letter, 1 word has the letter as second letter. We'll write that as index 2, and so on. So there are n letters. There are n words, because each of the n letters is the first letter of 1 word, and that is included in the word, of course. The word with n letters is index n itself. So we have n words.\nB: Let n=number of letters. For each word, there is 1 letter that appears as the first letter. We're interested in finding that letter. So we'll divide the n words into n groups, each containing one word, where the word in group i has the letter as index i. It's a bit more intuitive when we draw it: \n\nC: Let n=number.

The price for each friend is as follows: Mary paid $36, John and Jane paid $20, and the rest paid $15. The total from the bill is the same as the sum of the prices except for $5.\nOutput: Here, we want to determine the value of the hidden 5. So, we add the total of the prices except for 5, and the result is $136. So, add $5 to each payment except $36, and the result will be $141.\nNow, if we subtract the values $141 from $136, we will conclude that the difference is $5. Thus, $141-$142 = -1 <== -1==> 5. So we answer that the difference to the total is 5.\n\nInput: The first step to solve this question is to create a table that shows four different prices and four different items by adding up all the prices and items.\n\nOutput: First, we can see there are 4 items in the table, because all the columns are added. However, we also see there are 4 prices, because all the rows are added.\n\nNow, since we know that there are exactly four different items, and exactly four different prices, we can see that there could only be three different numbers in the total items, and there could be only three different numbers in the prices, as well.\n\nSo, we subtract three from the number of total items, and the result is 1.\n\nWe also subtract three from the number in column 'price', and the result is 0.\n\nNext, we do the same again for the number of items and the price, except this time we subtract three again. In column 'item', we subtract three from the price, and we subtract 6 from the item, and the resulting difference is 3. In column 'price', we subtract three from 'item', and we subtract 9 from 'price', and the resulting difference is -6.\n\nTherefore, 3-6 = -3 <== -3==", "answer": "C: police station"}

{"idx": 869, "text": "I could use a humidifier to add water vapor into the air, if I want to increase the amount of water vapor that is in the surrounding area. However, I have other options. A surface of the earth is composed mainly of rock, which is water-resistant and does not contain much water. Surfaces of the earth are not recommended because they can't absorb water from the atmosphere. A skating rink is a shallow area of water, which has a small surface-to-area ratio and a small surface-to water ratio. It is not an effective way to fix a dry house because it just doesn't contain enough water to fix my house. Burning the house to the ground may work if the fire is small enough and in a contained area (but not much else). An ice cube, on the other hand, is not enough to give me all the water I want. Because it is just a small area of water, I will have to buy more ice cubes and make multiple ice cubes to make enough water to fix my dry house.

You can think of the problem in terms of meters.\nWe know that the total area of beach is given by 1000, which can be seen as 1000 centimeters.\nWe want to calculate how much area the beach can fit so we can determine how many square meters it can fit.\nUsing the Pythagorean Theorem, we note that if each person is 100 centimeter tall, then each person is 1 square meter.\nWe want to find how many people can fit on the beach.\nTherefore, we can use the area formula. We can multiply the width by the length to find out how many square meters can be fit.\nSince each person is 1 meter long we can find the area by taking the width. Since the width is equal to 1 square meter, we get 1 x 1 = <<1 x 1=1>>1\n\nInput: Two friends walked on the grass on a beach. The beach is 100.4 centimeters in width.

Hey there \nOutput: First, eliminate the choices that do not correspond to a greeting.\nC = Hello again cannot match a choice because it is a description of a greeting.\nD = Hey there cannot match a choice because the choices are all greetings, but Hey There is not a greeting.\nHaving eliminated choices D and C, the other choices are all greeting choices. Now, answer whether choice B = hey contains a greeting. We know that hey is used in greetings, but it does not contain a greeting if it is not capitalized. We see that hey is capitalized, so we know choice B = hey does not contain a greating.\nFinally we are left with A and B. If A = hello does not match B = hey, then A and B must be of different types in order to get a match. We are given:\nA = Hello\nB = Hello\nChoice A represents a greeting while choice B represents a general description of a person. Therefore, the final answer is \"B\" - \"Hey\"\n\nInput: What are the only two months in which both the 2", "answer": "D: gym"}

During these six games, a player must win by having two more game points than the other player. What is the highest number of points in a match?\nOutput: A set in tennis is made up of 6 games. So in a set, a player wins by winning by 2 more points than the other player (e.g., 3-1).\nIn a match, there can be more than one set. Each set is played to 6 games, so the total number of points in a single match is the number of points in a set multiplied by the number of sets played in the match.\nThe highest number of points is ((6) * ((6) = <<6*(6)=36>>36. Since tennis sets are usually played to 6, the higher number is to say at least 36.\nSo the final number is 36", "answer": "A: eat grass"}

Choices: A: two hundred forty eight B: two hundred forty eight C: twenty four eighty D: twenty four eighty E: two four eighty\nOutput: Let's first think through what the number has to be. A four is a 4, an eight is a 8, so four and eight added together is 12, which is not 248. So it is neither two hundred forty eight nor two hundred forty eight. Next we'll look at two four eighty. Let's add the two and four and the eight and zero, leaving a one. It is indeed four plus eight, but the 4 comes after the 8, which is why this is wrong. So the number can't be either two four or four eight.\nThat was two hundred forty eight, which means it is neither two hundred fourty nor four eighty.\nFour thousand eighty is not either two hundred and forty or four eighty. Instead, it is four and eighty.\nTwenty-four hundred and eighty is not either twenty-four hundred and forty or twenty-four hundred and eight. It combines the parts of two hundred and forty and eight hundred and eight into the same order as in four thousand eight hundred. So twenty-four hundred and twenty-four eighty is the only way to spell it. Now we have to be more picky.\nSo what number is twenty four hundred and eighty? It can be two four hundred and eighty or four- eighty eight. It isn't four thousand eight hundred and twenty-four because that is five digits in length.

One way that we could access this place would be to use a bank vault.

Since the bank is a large institution, we could keep the book in one vault, but there are thousands of vaults all over the world.

The question only asks for the total expenses that come off the customer's deposit. Since the customer deposited $50, then Sandy only spent $40.

What is the key?\nOutput:This problem may be considered a combination of binary and modulus arithmetic.\nThe key is found by doing mod n, where n is the key for which this particular cipher was made.\nSince n=56 bits, it could be a 56 length bit long key or a binary string of 64 length bits. Assuming the first type, we have that the key is 76543210.\nThe binary form of a given decimal number is obtained by repeating the string of 0's where the position is the decimal value in the number.\nFor example if the value in decimal is 2, the binary form is 00000010. To make this more clear, here is a table:\n\nDecimal | Hex | Binary\n:-------:|:-----:|:-------:\n1       | 01  | 00001\n2       | 010 | 00010\n3       | 011 | 000\u2026\n4       | 100 | 00100\n5       | 101 | 001\u2026\n6       | 110 | 01000\n         |010\u2026\n7       | 111 | 01111\n\nIt can easily be found that if the decimal of m = bd, where b is the binary form and d is the decimal, then in binary 0d has to be 0b and bd has to end on 1.\nThis is obtained by looking at decimals and converting them into binary.\nFor example taking the decimal 2:\n2 = 010\n010 = 0010\n2 = 100\n\nHowever in binary, 010 cannot be converted to 0010 because the next decimal digit is 0, so 010 is converted to 110, the hex 72.", "answer": "A: ink in"}

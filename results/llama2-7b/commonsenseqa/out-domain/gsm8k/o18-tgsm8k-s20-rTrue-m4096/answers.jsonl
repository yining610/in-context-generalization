What was the total reduction in binge drinking during the program?\nOutput:The college lessened it 100/0 = <<10/0=0>>0% the first year then lessened it 1 less % or 80/100 = <<8/100=0>>0 each year.\nIf we multiply by 3, we get 4/0 = <<4/0=<<4>>4%.\nSo the total percent reduction was 4 x 4 = <<4 x 4 =16>>16%.\nFor the second year (20)68 = <<0*8=x=12x68>>20x\nTotal reduction was 200.\nSo total reduction is 20\nSo the total reduction is 0\nSo the final step is 0\nSo binge drinking reduction or % was 0%\nSo the final Answer was drinking reduction = 0%was the final reduction = 0%\nSo there was a total reduction in 0 was % so B was not reduced\nSo reduction was 0\nSo the total binge drinking was reduced.\nSo the final reduction is \nSo the binge binge drinking reduction 0.\nSo the reduction 0\nTheir binge reduction=0", "answer": "B: finger"}

Let's consider a simple arcade game where the player starts at a basic score, hits targets to gain points and gets rewarded for making combinations. In that case, winning is clearly one of the many perks. The game can either be educational, like a learning game about plants, or a stress-relieving game, maybe a shooting game. In other cases it could just be a means of entertaining oneself, especially if it is a boring one. But entertainment and happiness are definitely in it, because any game will usually offer either of those. Relaxation is not often a stated goal of a game, but it is probably achieved when the game is in an appropriate setting, and we can also say that winning is a form of relaxation. As for cheating, we could say it's only when we are talking about computer games, where there are hackers that cheat on a multiplayer game to win. However, you can say it's relaxing to cheat sometimes and you can even relax by letting the game cheat for you if it has the option.\nSo according to this answer, all of the answers are important, winning should be preferred and the rest are nice bonus.", "answer": "C: happiness"}

This means the number of crossevers, $\\mathtt{cros}$ that you calculate, is indeed the crossovers per group $i$ of the population.  This means that the number of crosser pairs is calculated is going to $2\\cdot (\\mathtt{cros} $\\mathtt{croc}$, or $\\mathtt{cro}$) and that's why you are seeing very large values.

The owner paid $2.199 per gallon for the gas and averaged 24.5 MPG combined on a 960-mile road trip. How much did the owner pay for gas total?\nOutput: Let's first solve for the miles per gallon of gas. Since the miles per gallon is given as (5 / 8) * 34 then using the formula 800(x/100)*(1/x) we get 34 * (5/8) * 100 = 37.5. Multiplying both sides by 100 (800 * 800) yields x = 37.\nSolving for x gives 37 as our MPG.\nAdding our formula for gas used on a trip with 960 miles to be traveled gives us x = (distance * MPG) = 960 * 37 = 35,020 gallons.\nSince we have a gallons we can use x = 35, 02/2 = 5, 00, 97, 99= 9 0 =96.\nIf we know that gas costs $2.19 9 9 7.9 = 9097, 0 97, then x * y/0 97 = $2.197/9/100 x 0 97 = 47, 5, 2, 33, 89, 39, 8, 9/0 3, 5, 9, 0.5/ 5 9, 9/0.48 y 0, y 8, 9, 99, 90, 9/8 90, 99, 5, 9, 9, 7, 999, 8, 9.2.19,", "answer": "E: desk drawer"}

So that would be 40 apples. In total the friend needs 40 apples to make it 10 hours. Each person needs 1 apple per hour. So we will need 50 apples + 50 apples = 100 apples. The friend gets hungry every hour, so we will need 120 apples. This is the amount of apples that we need for each hour. So, we need to buy 2 apples every 5 hours for 10 hours. So it takes 60 apples. Because it takes 1 hour, it takes 160 apples to meet the amount of apples by the friend needs for 1 hour of the amount of apples needed for each hour\n\nInput:A box has 24 balls in 6.

At first, they require 2 pills every week  ==> each pill = 2  --> total pills they need now if they have 1 animal is 2\nOnce they are using pills, they only need 1 pills daily,  --> so they need 1/2 * 2 = 1 ** now if they have 5 animals, they need 5/2 * 2 == 10 \nSo after discovering the pills, each animal would need 1*2 = 2 pills, or they use 2*5 = 10 pill every week.\nSo the answer is 10 \nInput:A restaurant can cook meals for $350 on a single meals can meals can cooks. cooks can cook for $50. cook can cooks can meals. and on average, cooks for, cooks, and $50 cooks on average, the restaurant can $<br>on average, cooks, and $19\nOutput:$5\nSo the answer is\nInput:On each side, 540.\nOutput:2040+5.So40\nSo the final is\n\n\nInput:\nOutput:a(\nSo the answer is a(\nInput:Each (a(soon each side 1eon\nOutput: the average(so each side\nSo the average\nOutu put put: each side (put each 1.

A man ordered 3 pizza pies how many pieces does the man have? Choices: 1: 8 2: 24 3: 32 4: 24 5: 1 6: 2.5\nOutput:I had to read the question a few times to make sure I understood it correctly.  I interpreted that the question was asking you how many people were sharing one pizza pie, so I thought that it was in the multiple choice answers.  I was just confused because why would the question give 2.5 as an option if it is not a multiple choice question.  When the answer was 9.0, it clicked because the question was not really about how many pieces were on the pizza, but how many people were sharing the pizza.\nSince there are only 8 pieces, and 3 orders were made, we can calculate how many pieces each person will receive by dividing 3 by 8, which equals 0.375. Round that up to the nearest 20th, and it will equal: 0.4 = \"four tenths\".  So each person shared 40% of 1 pizza pie, and they received 4 8.  So in total they would have: 24 pieces, and 9 of them are already on the pizza.  So they have: 9*24 or 36. 4 = final answer\nSo the final answer\nInput:What does the number of cups did it take to fill 2 large trunks?

Since both A and B are equal to C, we only need to choose one of them. We chose A from both B and 4 options.\nWe can do this process for questions that have more than 2 options so we can obtain the answer from a combination of both A and B choices from the other options.\nFor 2 * 2 (answer to 2 * 3), we can check 2 divide by 2 = 1, 6/2 = 3. 4/2 = 2.

Therefore, it has to be that P is not < 0.5, since there is a probability of 30% that the game will be cancelled with probability 30%. Now, if we assume that the game will not be cancelled with probability P, then it has to be that the number of games where the game will be cancel with probability 0, that the game will not will be cancelled 1, that game will not be cancel 2, that will not cancel 13.

With this logic, how many months does it take for the dog to stay healthy?\nOutput:In the first month, the dog has 50 chance of staying healthy. Since there is 50% chance of staying health, then the 50% probability will always be 1.\nWith 1 chance of not being hurt now, this means the probability to stay healthy is 1 - 1 = 0% or 0, so the chance of not being hurt in the first month is 1- 1 * 1/100 = <<0 - 1*1/100>= 0>>0\nNow, if there is a 2 chances drop in the second month with only 50%chance left, that 50/100 * 1 = 0.5\nIn total, there in a 25% left to stay healthy in 1 month with a 25/100 *1 = 1/4 chance left for the dog to be healthy for 1 month\nIn total, the dog has 1/4 chance of staying health for 1 month: 1/4 *1 = 125%\nSo the final answer of staying healthy for 1months is 125% or 1/4 = <<1/4 = 1/4=125/4 1= 6.25%>>\nSo the final answer \"The dog stays healthy for 6.25 months.\n\n\nInput: What comes with your answer?\nOutput:\nSo the answer is a cats\n\n\n\nThe cat\n\n\nTherefore the answer\n\nSo the answer\nThis is\n\n\nSo the answer", "answer": "A: exhilaration"}

By the end of the tournament, the top 12 teams stayed intact. Each time a team defeats another team, there is automatically a tiebreaker to determine who moves to the next round. The top 16 teams from the tournament went to the state tournament. If a team only played 1 playoff game in a round, that means they lost the first playoff game and then lost the tiebreaker for that round. If they beat 2 teams straight, it means they won the first playoff game straight, then won the next playoff game straight, and then won the tiebreaker for the round. All of the first-playoff-round games, the second-playoff-round game, the tiebreaker game, and the state game are all single-elimination bracket style games. The tournament was single-elimination, meaning any and every lost match by a team is an elimination. There was an odd number of teams, which means that some of the lower-seeded teams made it to the state, meaning in the state games, both teams would win their match 60% of their games; each team would compete against each other team.

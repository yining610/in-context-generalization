Auditory numbers are divisible by three.<n>Output:The positive auditory number should be k3=140<n><n>Input:[23]42 44<n>Output:110<n><n><n>### Solution: <n><n>Input: The first car rental fee is not necessary because it is the same as the total. The second car rental fee is $280(= $30*(11-1)) = $190(+$180) so the answer is $310.<n><n>Input: Each head of cattle costs $20. There is a truck can transport 20 cattle. So the truck can also transport 400 cattle = 40 trucks, so the total time to transport is 40 times the cost of each round trip.<n><n>Input: You can assume Jason's charge is per night.<n><n>If Eric rents the house for 21 days, it will cost him $2950 (=$800*3). If he rents the house for only 20 days, he would save $200 (=$80*2). So he will rent the house for only 19 days.<n><n>Input: <n>We can choose 1200: It is a nice number, divisible by 9.<n><n>It is auditory because the number is 3 digits(320).<n><n>Because 1200 is less than it predecessor, we have to add 2 to the 2nd digit, which is 5(5+2=7)=1200+24=1224. But the rest part of the number is not kinesthetic. So the number should be 1328.<n><n>However, because we want the auditory number to smaller, we have to delete digits. Since 7 is bigger than 3 and 9, if we delete these digits, we get 1320.<n><n>So let's have the Auditory number to be 13(=132

For example, 368 minus 8 is 360. In the first procedure the first  digit is 3 so the sum of the digits is subtracted and that is 3. In the next procedure  the third digit is subtract from the first or second which is larger so it subtracted from the first and that value is 3 less than 8 which is 5. So far we have 368 minus (-3) or 368-3 is 365. The sum of the digits is 5, subtract 3 from 5 and this is 2. We are done so the new number is 2. In the second procedure we now subtract 2 from the largest digit. That 2 is from the 1. The largest digit

So then log(n) would be O(1) as we are not dealing with a sorted set of items therefore nlogn would be O(2^n).<n>##### Problem 3:O(n) -  This is again a simple problem since we have to get the numbers in ascending order and we can use merge sort. Therefore a complexity of O(n) is valid.<n>##### Problem: O(n) - For any element in the tree we can easily convert it to its value as a number. Therefore this is a one time computation and can be a part od the function where we have an if statement to check if the element is num. if it is num then return num otherwise return 0. Now we will see how many nodes there are in the tree. It can be a constant of 3 because it can always be true. (Height of tree < number of nodes).  Then it should be O(n).<n>#### Detailed Explation:

What is the price, in dollars, for the rose-gold band alone?<n>Output: 2073.4 (rounded to nearest cent)<n><n>#### Note<n><n>##### Solution:<n>##### In case 1, the output is 310. We should note that in the input the rental ends at the first day.<n>##### In case of 2, we should be able to solve the question by the following equation : $30 + 60(60) = $30 + 3600 = 3960 (because $30+ $190 is less than 3960).<n>##### In case for 3, the output is 40. The solution is the following equation: $190 > 50, thus $190-$50 = $140, $140/20 = $7, and thus the answer is 7 days.<n>##### In 4, we should note that the amount of days is irrelevant, since the charging is independent from the days. Thus, the output is 20 because the price/item is $20, multiplied by $40 to sum 800. (if it had ended at day 14, the output would have been 800, since $50/day times 14 are not a factor of 800).<n>##### Finally, in 5. $4320 is equal to $2800+ $1999.99. Note that $1999 is equal to $1900+$499.99, which is still greater than $1900(rose-gold). Therefore we get that the output is $2800.<n>

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The car-rental agency charges $30/day for a car, or $190 for the first week for a rental that lasts an entire week or longer. Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Output: 800<n><n>Input:A musician is most likely to perform a concerto for clarinet with what type of group? Choices:  A: music store B: orchestra C: jazz band D: rock band E: music studio<n>Output:		A<n><n>Question 1: We start by finding the number of times we will pay $30, for which we use the mod operator % to find how many times the 30 will repeat in the sequence. Since you will not pay $30 again, you will end paying $130. We then add to the series in order to get a total price, giving you the answer $310.<n><n>Question 2: We will use the MOD operator % to find the number of whole days needed to drive that distance, based on the fact that the first day is 1, and each day after will be 1 more than the last until the day is 60, when we will start back from 60 to 1. Adding 60 to the whole drive is for the return trip, so we use the + operator. With this we obtain the answer 40 days, and 40/60ths would be the number of hours needed to make the trip, which will be 30 hours total.<n><n>Question 3: This question will require a little more work. We again start with the question of how many times will Jason pay $50.0 in the 14 days. Once again that can be done using the % operator. He will only pay $ 50.0 in his total payment, which means that (14 - 1)/14 will be the number of times he will pay $50 in the overall payment. Adding to the series, gives us a total of $800.<n><n>Question4: This question again requires quite a bit of work, first to determine how many notes and rests there are in a minuet in fourfour time. In this case, we will be looking for 3/4 note, so that will be 2 notes per measure. That puts the answer at 1+2+3…….8+9=17. We now need to determine the rests.  A rest is the silence before the next note, so for every 8 notes, a rest is placed down. Since a minuet only has 17 notes, we see that there will be only 1 rest per eight note measure. With this in mind, the musician will play the notes (2,4,6,8,8,6,4,2) which is 17 notes and then rest for

Therefore, it's $190 for a whole week or more. Jennie rented the car for 11/14 = 7/7 days. Therefore, they rented the car for less than a week that made them pay $30/per days. That makes $30 x 7 = 210. Since they charged $190 for 1 week, their total number of days will be more than 1 week to equal to $190 so it has 190 - 210 = -20. Therefore, Jennie paid -20 x 30 = -600.00.<n>  Input #2: [565 694 681 545 475]<n>  Output#2:40   <n>  Expalination: 60 miles per day was asked when he renting cattle for transportation. Therefore, he has to travel at 60 miles/hour. Total distance of 40 * 60 = 2400 which is equal to 60 miles because it's divided by 60. Therefore, he will take a total of 2400/60 = 40 hours. Because I'm giving the speed in miles/hour, I'm calculating the speed in hour/day which makes it 40.<n>  Input#3:  [585 684 679 560 488]<n>  Output #3:800   <n>  Explainatio:Total number of fees that Eric will be charged for 20 days is 2400 fees which is the total distance he traveled divided by 60 (1/day).

Choices:  A: park B: in the ground C: hedgerow D: temperate climate E: botanical gardens<n>Output:		E<n><n><n>## Multiple Choice Answer<n>The answer is 310.<n><n>## Explanation<n>For the first question, the expression we have is simply cost = $30 + $30.<n>This means the number of days that the rental will be for is essentially the total sum of the $30 cost for the number of days.<n>So for 11 days of rental, we would end up paying $330 total for rental costs. We then subtract this number from the total cost of rental, which is $530. So the total cost subtracted from the sum of the $330, we subtract $190. The $190 is the cost for the first week. <n><n>After solving for the answer value, you can use the following steps to understand how to get to your answer:<n>$$330 + 190 = 520$$<n><n>However in the worded problem, we can not write out the addition symbol because the instructions did not explicitly state that we were allowed to.  Instead, we need to remember that <n><n>$$\text{cost} = \$30 + \$30$$<n><n><n>Because the expression doesn’t contain any arithmetic operations, it is safe to assume that we’ve calculated the correct cost and that the sum $60 is equal to cost. <n><n>## Another question<n>The second question was actually similar to the first question in terms of the problem solving.<n>The answer comes out as 40.<n><n>## Another question <n>The third question was also similar to the previous two questions.<n>The answer comes to 800.<n>

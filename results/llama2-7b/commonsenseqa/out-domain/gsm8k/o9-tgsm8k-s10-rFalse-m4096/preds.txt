At an ant colony, there is no centralized brain controlling where to go and when. That’s how the queen ants decide. Every so often, some of the ants are randomly chosen to stay at their nest and lay down a pheromone trail to a food source. These pheromones travel back and forth as ants leave and return to their nest. Now, we have an ants’ route and the number of ants following it and we want to determine where the next food source should be placed. As an example, let’s say the ants are traveling to the food source from their nest and we place the food source right on the pheromone trail next to the nest. Next time the ants go to find food, they won’t be able to tell it’s not there because the pheromone route is right there. The ants just travel that route from the nest to the food source and never get there. We don’t want that to happen, so we can place the food source somewhere down the pheromone path that no ants are following now. This means we’ll have to place it somewhere to the left or right of the ants’ path. In that case, we have 3 equally likely ways the ant can go—straight to the food source, to the right of the food source, or to the left. How can we choose the left or right direction to best avoid having ants go straight to the food source?<n>Output: left<n><n>Input: Earnest runs a car wash.

The program should not only check if it is right or left, but also keep track of its orientation.<n><n>Input: Left, Right, Left, Right<n>Output: rlrl<n><n>### Instruction: Answer each multiple choice question.<n>Input: A number n is divisible by 4 if any digit of 4 divides n evenly. Example: 5, 10, 25 are divisible by 4 <n>If n is divisible by more than 4, then it is divisible by 8. <n>We do not know if n is divisible by any number between 5 and 9. Example: 48, 51 is divisible by 5,6,8 but not by 3,7,9. <n>To determine if a given number is divisible by 6, we multiply together 2 numbers that add up to 6(For example: 2 x 3 = 6). 6 is the LCM of 2 and 3. If that number is not divisible by 6 then the original number is not divisible 6 either. <n>Find the LCM of all divisible numbers between 2 to 10.<n>Let n be the number which is not divisible by any divisor in between 2 and 10. We must find a number which is divisible by the LCM of the numbers 2 to 11 such that n = (mod n). <n>If some number y is divisibl by an odd number x, then n = (mod n)<n><n>Input: The LCM of 2 to 15 is 15, and n = 1999.<n>Output: 17<n><n>Input: n has all even digits and is not divisible by its LCM. Output: 0<n><n>Input: <n>If n is even, output 0. <n><n>If odd, multiply by 4 and add the first digit and the last digit, if they are not divisible by 4 output 0, otherwise add 1.<n><n>n must be less than 1000.<n>Output: 0<n><n>Output: <n>Any number ending in 6 is divisible by 3.<n>

Adam bought 3 kilo of nuts and 3.5 kilo of dried fruits.<n><n>The price of 3 kilo of nut is $12 and 3.5 of dried fruit is $8.<n>Therefore, answer is `216`<n><n>#### Instruction2<n><n>Johns goes to the gymn 3 times a week and he spends 1 hour on weight lifting for 2 days, and one half hour on warming up and doing Cardio for 2 days.<n><n>So, John spends 4 hours on weight lifting per week.<n>The answer is `8`.<n><n>#### Instruction3<n><n>Let's assume the total price paid for refueling is $X, $X = 300.<n>Increasing the cost of refueling.<n>The current cost of one gallon of gas is $4, so total cost is $X/8 = 40.<n>Therefore, `X = 660.`<n><n>#### Instruction4<n><n>Let's calculate the total number of goals.<n>It's `2*(6000/300)=1200.`<n>The total number of goals scored by Stella and Twinker is `2*(1200/250)=600.`<n>Therefore, `Stella scored 30 goals in the season and Twinker scored 30 goals as well.`<n><n>#### Instructions5<n><n>Let's start with one person's work. Stella and Twinkler both put in 6 stones each.<n><n>`Elijah` worked for 3/6 hours. Emilio also worked for 3/10 hours.<n>Therefore, Elijah worked for `(3/6) + (3/10) = 11/20 hours.`<n><n>`Total work hours` needed to fill a box is `2*(11/20) = 22/10th of a hour = 220/10 = 2.2 hours.`<n><n>Let's multiply the total number of stones by the work hours needed.<n>The number of stones needed for shipping in a box is `2.2*(60

EAN stands for European Article Number or European Article Numbering System. This was created as a barcode system for retail, specifically for identification of goods and services. Each number can be broken down into sections. The first numbers (1 to 3) are the Country code. These denote which country the 14 digit number came from and the first two numbers are always 51. The second set of data (4 to 6 digits) define the Type of item which the number is describing. Type (4-digit number) can be either: 495 : Foodstuffs or Cosmetics 455 : Household cleaning utensils 465 : Tobacco products 425 : Petroleum products 435 : Clothing/Leather products 475 : Books and media 415 : Medicine/Healthcare products 416 : Medical equipment or supplies 412 : Infant or baby products 419 : Sanitary/Baby products 6 : Furniture 7 : Building materials 8 : Toys 9 : Electric appliances 10 : Other household items. The next set (7 digits) is for item classification which is a unique number used by each retailer. The final digit (8th) acts as a check digit and needs to be calculated mathematically (for example see a list of check digits here).<n>Output: 536680279483615<n><n>Input: 40% of the total population in Germany lives in Hamburg whereas the other 60% of the entire population lives in every state except for Hamburg.

It then goes on to multiply 50 Overtimes by the rate of $5 per additional hour to come up with $250. As there are 5 days in a week, we only need to subtract 50 Overtimed hours from a week: 350 - 50 = 250

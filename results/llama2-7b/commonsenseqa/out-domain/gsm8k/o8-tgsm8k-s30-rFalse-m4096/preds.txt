Unlike a list, each element of a blob cannot have a variable data type in memory but instead, each element is a "field", which defines a variable "tag" and a "size" (not necessarily the size of the variable, because the tag might represent the number of characters, not the size of the variable on disk, and the size of a variable might not mean anything to a blob).<n><n><n>## Question Input:<n>* What is a Blob.<n><n>#### Answer:<n>A Blob is a collection of unstructured data from files and the output is a compressed data stream with a common header used across the files and one or more fixed-length trailer records.

Choices:  A: new mexico B: forrest C: dessert D: garden E: creek<n>Output:		B) Forrest<n><n>### Solution(s):<n><n>Solution:<n><n>Step 1:<n>To solve the first part of the rental question, substitute 40 days for a week. Then use 40 x $190. The car costs $7,600 for the first month.<n><n>Step 2:<n>The transport time for each head of cattle is.0166 hours. Multiply.0166 by 60 and add the two answers together to solve for the transport time.<n><n>Step 3:<n><n>The total bill for 5 boys and 7 girls is 1080. The bill for each boy is 500, the bill for each girl is 700. The remainder would equal the boys' share.<n><n>Step 4:<n><n>Divide the bill by 5 to find the amount billed to each boy. Next, take 175 from that amount to find how much each boy got for his meal.<n><n>Step 5:<n><n>25% of the remainder is $1,500. Next I divide and take her answer ($6.175) times two to find how much money is spent on food.<n><n>Step 6:<n><n>Multiply the $17,000 times.6 to find the cost of the ambulance ride<n>Step 7:<n><n>Divide by 5 to figure out the remainder.<n><n>Step 8:<n><n>The 4th bed has two more carrots than the 2nd bed and also 8 more than the 3rd bed. Also, in the 4th bed there is one fewer carrot than the number that was found in the 3rd bed, and in the 2nd bed there are 5 carrots.<n><n>Step 9:<n><n>The total number of people would be the sum of that answer and that of each sibling (except her brother, who has the same amount as the daughter).<n><n>### Comment<n><n>#### How it works:<n><n>When the data is entered into the code, the variables are declared, defined and initialized.<n><n>Then the loop runs on the data by using the for loop to enter the data and perform the operations over the specified range.<n><n>When that’s done, it outputs the answer to the question

The place value of a digit is the power of 10 to which that digit has the same exponent as the exponent of 10 for that position in a number in the usual decimal base. The exponent of 10 is 1 for the ten's place, 10 for the hundred's place, and so on.  So a place value of 2 means that in the right-most position it is twice itself.  The same position in a base 2 number is called the binary exponent.  In base 10, the first nine digits are from 0 (or "binary 0") to 9.  In number theory each number has a unique representation with a unique place value. The result is called the unique binary representation of a number, and it is the same for any base.  A number that has a unique representation with 10 digits (the usual decimal base of numbers) is called a decimal number, an alternative representation is called a numeral for convenience of use. This is the number 232 as decimal (10,11,9,1,10,0,0,0), as Roman numeral (MDII), and as Hindu–Arabic or Indian numeral (ए२३२).  For simplicity, in the numerology literature, "digit" often refers to a place value, for example "binary digit" refers to a unique binary representation of a binary-represented decimal number (which is called a "base-twelve" number by the way that number is stored in binary form).  A "digit" in pure number theory means a "place" in an infinite representation, as above. A common method for generating numbers without the use of a calculator is to use the Fibonacci number, named after the Italian mathematican Leonardo Pisano, or Fibonacci from Liber Abaci.<n>Output: B<n><n>Input: Each day Mr. Miller buys one pizza for 15 dollars, one pack of cookies for 45 dollars, and one pack of potato chips for 65 dollars.

Choices:  A: greedy B: worry C: have knowledge D: take charge E: boss<n>Output:		 C<n><n><n><n>---Part Two: Explanation<n>---<n>### Please add explanation about how you came to your solutions for each question<n>For part one, I first looked at the question and saw that 1000 minus 600 is 400. Therefore, I decided to look at each case. In the first case, the 11 days were 110 dollars. In the second case, I counted the 78, 101, and 55 to get a total of 234. I counted the 14 and 8 days to get 36 in the third case, and counted the 60 in the forth case to get 360. Therefore, in part one, the total sum was ((110 + 360) +(36+234) +110 + 60) which equals 730 dollars.<n><n>For part two, it seemed easy to me because in the first case, if the price was 30, then the total will be 300. Therefore, in the second case, if the price is 190, then the total is 30, which makes the answer is (30 + 190) = 220. Therefore, the answer is 220.<n><n>---<n>### You may be asked to explain your explanation in a phone interview. Can you discuss with the interviewer?<n>For part one, it is not difficult to realize that it is easier to add up than to subtract. I can also add these sums so that if there are two cases, for the first case, I can add 11 days and 110 dollars to get 121. If there are three cases, I can use this idea to add three parts.<n><n>For part 2, the answer is very easy to notice, in fact, the two choices are wrong. If the price is 30, the total will be 50, and they are not on the same scale, I can eliminate them. So it is easy to get 300.<n><n>---

For example, if we were to write x+y = 9, then we would write: x is equal to y minus 1. If we were to write, x+y = -3, then we would also write x is equal to y plus 3.<n>These are called variables. Variables are special because they represent an unknown number. So, you can substitute any real value for variables, so long as they stay true to the equation you have written so far.<n>For example, if we plugged in the value 3 for x, then we write the equation 3+y = -3 would simply read: y = -4.<n>This is known as balancing an equation. That is, you substitute a value for a variable so that each side of the equation is equal.<n>The final step is to check your work to see if your equation equals to true.<n>Output: A<n><n>Input: A box of Cheerios is sold for $3.25.

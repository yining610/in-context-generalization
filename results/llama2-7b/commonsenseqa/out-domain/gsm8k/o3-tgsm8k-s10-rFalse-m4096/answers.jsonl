You may pick any text editor you like, but for most users the default install options are fine. If you really have to ask which editor to use, you should probably wait until a later Python course in the semester that will explore this topic in an organized manner.\n###Instruction:\n\n1. Import one of Python's built-in modules, such as random.\n\n2. Use the module to write a program that randomly generates ten numbers between 0 and 10. The random module is actually a whole set of functions for generating random numbers, but you only need one of them this time - the randint() function. It takes two parameters - the first is the lowest end, and the second is the highest end. Use these to specify which numbers you want generated. randint(0,10) will generate random numbers between 0 and a number that you select as high as 10. This one will generate between 5 and 10.\n\n    x=[randint(0,19) for rand in range(10)]\n\n### Instruction:\n\n3. Add the numbers you got to the result array (we create a new array x to hold our numbers), so that we now have a list with ten numbers. Here's some fancy syntax for it:\n\n    x=list(map(lambda rand: rand+5, random.sample(range(a), b)))\n\n###Instruction:-\n\n4. Run your code.\n\n###Instructions:\n5.

For example, we can take two items and choose one of them as P and another as Q.\n\nTo solve the first question, we want to get the value, but after some thinking we can observe that the weight of each item is 1 kg. Therefore the cost is just the value of both multiplied by 3 kg.\n\nI also use a list to keep the time of every day. That means that I could use all the days in the list.\n\n$M = 3`\n$N = 2.5`\nFirst, I'll use `M/6 = 3/6 = 1/2` to solve the ratio of M.\nSo that's why:\n`M*0.5 = 0.5*(M/6)`\n\nNext, I'm going to print the item name, which is 'nuts', then I can print the item value after the `print('Item name: Nuts\\nValue: ',M)`\n\nWe just simply multiply 1K*12 which is $12`\n\nSimilarly, to get the dried fruits item's value I simply multiply 2.5 by 8 to get the value of $20`", "answer": "B: bamboo grove"}

I did some practice questions to understand how it works. When ever we have the numbers 11 and 24, we can always get 35 using simple addition. However the answer is 13. As you can see the first 11 is from the 12th step. What I needed to do was to take away the number 1 from the 24th step.\n\nI also tried to do some quick mental calculations to see if the solution might be correct. In this case 35 (13 + 22) = 35 & 13 = 12.\n\n- Step 2\n\nThis second question is about comparison and division. I know that Adam was buying things and I knew the prices of things he bought. What I had to do here was to compare the prices of items he picked and to compare the weight of items at every step. For example, 12 \u2013 31 which represent the different weight of nuts showed me that one kg of nuts has cost 2 times more than dried fruits.\n\nThe first thing I do for this question is to get answer of how much did his purchases for. To do this I have 1) to find out how many pounds of nuts he bought. 2) subtract this from the price of 2.5 kg to get the difference and 3) get the answer for", "answer": "E: let blood"}

We only need to return the c, which is the answer.\n\n## Python 3 Code:\n\n```python3\n# Define a function:\ndef solve(inList, inq):\n      a = inList[0]\n      c = inList[len(inList)/2]", "answer": "D: end of line"}
{"idx": 126, "text": "D\n\nInstruction: This question requires that you use Python.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nFirst, let's convert our input number input into a string because if we try to add or subtract string from string we will get a string instead of a number. Then multiply 2 by 1 to get the result of 2 because the number of chocolate candies is 2.\nNext, add what the price of the candies each and the entire list of costs of each item. The result is $56\n\nLet's define a variable 'gymTime' and divide by 3 to get what gym time is, which is 4.\n\nIn this question, since the value is a whole number and a string, lets perform a modulo to remove 0 as the remainder and then divide by 2. The answer is 480.\n\nFinally, it is Florida, it is part of the United States, thus the answer is D. We use the country name from Florida to get the entire continent in as D.

I tried for some time recursion, but couldn't quite figure it out ( I knew my way to doing it before the challenge and did it before).\nI think when it comes to recursion, it matters a lot what your input is and there has to be more than one recursive call after one recursive call the value changes because another input is given.\n\nI think I had to solve it using nested for loops and it turned out to be the best choice\n\n### Next Steps:\n\nNext time, I need to work on", "answer": "C: puzzle box"}

Call the methods in the class you are working with for every iteration in the first class\n6. You should always pass the input data as parameters to the methods you use in your class\n\n\n## Questions  \n\n### How do I get the file name in the main method for a text file?\n\nUse the static method that reads the file \n\nExample:\n\n```java\n    public static void main(String[] args){\n      String path = \"C:\\\\Users\\\\Aaron\\\\Desktop\\\\project1\\\\textfile.txt\";\n      Scanner sc = new Scanner(new File(path));\n      String temp = sc.nextLine();\n```\n\n### How does the get() method get the string from the file and return it?\n\nThe method first opens the file, and then it reads the file line by line until it reaches the end.  Each time it calls nextLine it reads a line from the file.  The method returns a string, so you need to put the return statement at the end of the method\n\n```java\n//First the method reads the file and saves a line from the file to the variable temp\nString fileName = new File(path);\nScanner sc = new Scanner(fileName); \n//The method does not have a return on the first line, so just replace it to a return\ntemp = sc.nextLine(\"<empty lines to match the line break>)\");\n\n\n//Next, you call the split(String) method in the line, \"temp = sc.next\ntemp = sc.split(\"<character that you want in another line\")\n\n\n//Next you call the get() method\nString data = temp.get<line that is called out from the user>\n```\n\n## Resources \n\n[Scanner](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html)\n\n[TextFile](https://docs.google.com/document/d", "answer": "C: table"}

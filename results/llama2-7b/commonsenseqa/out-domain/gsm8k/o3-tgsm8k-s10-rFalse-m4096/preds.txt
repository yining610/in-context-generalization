I had a list of different items that I needed and wanted to buy and I had this list on my smartphone which was connected to a barcode scanning application.  I would scan the barcodes on the items I took out of the grocery shelves while in the supermarket, the list was then refreshed accordingly.  One day I forgot that I had this application installed and I was in the store with a pen and paper.  I wrote down the items I wanted to buy and then walked towards the grocery isles to find the items.  As I was scanning the first items I was confused as to why the barcode scanning application kept telling me that the product was not in stock.  I then remembered that I had this application on my phone and I turned on the WiFi on my phone. When the application was able to access the internet, it then loaded the product I needed which was no longer in stock.  It seemed like a ridiculous problem.  Why would you want internet access turned off in a place where you need it the most?  Why would you carry two applications for one single purpose?  A: I forgot to turn off the internet  B: I was scanning items in the wrong order  C: I entered some wrong data in my list  D: I didn't pay attention to what I was scanning <n>Output: A.

The random module is actually a whole set of functions for generating random numbers, but you only need one of them this time - the randint() function. It takes two parameters - the first is the lowest end, and the second is the highest end. Use these to specify which numbers you want generated. randint(0,10) will generate random numbers between 0 and a number that you select as high as 10.

Choices:  A: university B: concert C: home D: terminal E: airport<n>Output:		A<n><n>#### Solution<n>1. Adam bought 3 kilogram(3k)of nuts,nuts cost 12 dollars per kilogram<n>(3k * 12) = 36 dollars.and 2.5(2.5k)kilo gram of dried fruits,dried fruits cost 8 dollars per kilo gram,and 2.5 k * 8 ) = 20 dollars.So their total cost =36 + 20 = $56$.<n><n>2. John go to the gym(g) 3(3g) times per day, he weights per day, gym cost is same 3 dollars per day,and he spent 1 third of the day is not weights lifting,warming up and cardio each day.So john cost of weight lifting each day is 2/3 of the gym cost(2/3(3g) = 2g), warming up cardio each day cost is 1/3 of the gymn cost(1/3(3g)= 1g).So 2h + 1h + 1g = (2/3)g + (1/3)g + 1g = 2g + 2g +1g=4g+2g = 6g.So in total john lifting cost is $216 dollars per week.<n><n>3. James had to refuel his airplane fuel cost increase 20%(20%).He bought another extra tank,which increased the fuel capacity 2.5 times(2.5). So James new cost for fuel is 480 dollars.<n><n>4. Security, highly criticized (C)<n>

I did some practice questions to understand how it works. When ever we have the numbers 11 and 24, we can always get 35 using simple addition. However the answer is 13. As you can see the first 11 is from the 12th step. What I needed to do was to take away the number 1 from the 24th step.<n><n>I also tried to do some quick mental calculations to see if the solution might be correct. In this case 35 (13 + 22) = 35 & 13 = 12.<n><n>- Step 2<n><n>This second question is about comparison and division. I know that Adam was buying things and I knew the prices of things he bought. What I had to do here was to compare the prices of items he picked and to compare the weight of items at every step. For example, 12 – 31 which represent the different weight of nuts showed me that one kg of nuts has cost 2 times more than dried fruits.<n><n>The first thing I do for this question is to get answer of how much did his purchases for. To do this I have 1) to find out how many pounds of nuts he bought. 2) subtract this from the price of 2.5 kg to get the difference and 3) get the answer for

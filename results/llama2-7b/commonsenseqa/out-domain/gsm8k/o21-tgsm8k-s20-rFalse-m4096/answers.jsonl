I found out that variables should always be capitalized. However, I only noticed this after reading around on some other forums as I was not sure if it would matter for the program. Secondly, I read about how the \"input\" function took in variables from the user. This is what the program would read through to determine your answers. Finally, there is another function in Python called output. It takes the \"answer\" variable from the user to display the actual output of what they are meant to figure out. That being said, the input output statement was the way data was sent to and fro in Python.\n\nMy first program involved asking users what the input is. In this case, it was Tapanga and Core, who can divide up their candies. I realized that my second program required me to input the data in a more creative way with the input function. My problem statement states that Freddy calls his family and calls his brother and he talks for 31 minutes on a local call. His brother would be more than 31 minutes due to international calls and the cost of it, hence the answer was 10 bucks.\n\nThe function that I was using allowed me to input one line of data. I realized that it would be better to use multiple for loops or something due to how many times my problem could be repeated which is why I think I will use the for function for other programs. I also used another function called count to keep count of the minutes that had passed.", "answer": "C: isolation"}

Each player attacks or supports the current player. All players attack or support equally. For every attack or support, there will be the same increase (or decrease) in strength (represented by one unit).\nExample:\nN = 4\n\nFirst line: 1    2    3    4\nSecond line: 1    4    2    3\n\nThe first line means two random players (1 and 2) attack the second line (3 and 4), giving 2, 1 to them. The score is 2/8, with a decrease of 9.\n\nThe answer is 13/12. Which is 1 for the first line attack of 1 and 4. Plus another 1 from supporting 3, making the score 2/9. So minus 9 is -7. And that is the value for the second 1/2 of the second line attacking, so it's 13/18.\n\nHow many units of strength will be lost at the end? The units (if the game isn't over) will be lost when someone loses, so after both sides have attacked each time, no units will be lost. The total points at the end? 8 points for the first line. 0 for the second line.\n\nWhat is the answer?\nOutput: 80000", "answer": "B: sporting event"}

{"idx": 347, "text": "A\n\n### Solution:\nIn this question, I first thought I was supposed to look at each number as a sum of 2 digit number. But since you need the digits individually as well, i started just adding them. But since the same concept was repeated twice, I realized it was because it's a subtraction problem on top of it. We can substract the 66 as a whole and get our answer.\n\n### Solution 1:\nInput: Tapang has 8 more candiess than Corey and Corey has 29 candies.\n\nIf Tapang has n candies and Corey has m candies, Tapang has n+8-m candies.\n\nSo n+8-m+m  =  9\n\nSolving this equation of our own: n+8=9, substituting n and getting n=1. So Tapanga has 9 candies and Corey 56\n\n### Solution :\nInput: Freddy called different people. A call to the family would cost 5 cents per minute, while a call to an international call would cost 25 cnets per minute. So we need to find the cost for all calls.\n\nFreddy has 5+1 times and 21 times in the problem statement. So 5*1 + 21*1 = 190 cents\n\n### Solution2 : It's not just that it's 8+4=12, its that you need the digit and the whole. So 8*2 = 16 and 4*2=8, we see that you need both digits to solve this problem. Since our answer is 12, it's 8*2 =16, 4*3 = 12\n\n## Solution:\nLet's say X is the amount of candie Lawrence works. He worked for 8 days. So Lawrence worked total of X*8 candies to sell.\n\nInput: Lawrence sold 10 candies during mondays, wednesday and fridays. So mondays and wednesdays total sold candies = 20 candies, fridays = 10 candies\n\nSo Lawrence worked for X*7 days, to sell 70 candies(20+10+", "answer": "B: unbreakable"}

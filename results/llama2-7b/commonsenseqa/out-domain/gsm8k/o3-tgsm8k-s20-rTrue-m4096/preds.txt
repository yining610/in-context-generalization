If a mule takes longer to walk the same distance as a pony takes to trot the same distance, how many times longer does this take?<n>Output: Sammy can walk 4 feet in 9 seconds. A pony will trot 6 feet in 6 seconds.<n>9/6 = <<9/6=1.5>>1.5 times faster than a pony.<n>If A pony takes 1.5 times longer, a pony will take 1.5 times as long to walk 12 feet as Sammy will take to walk 4 feet<n>So the final answer we get is A<n><n>Input: A woman had six babies, all but two of which were boys. What do you think the probability is that each of her subsequent babies will also be boys?<n>Output: There were 4 boys but the rest of them were girls.  The number of possible girls increased to 6 each time. This means that there were 6 possible girls and 4 possible boys that could be born.  The number of positive occurrences of something is 6 * 4 = <<6*4=24>>26.<n>Now let us count the number of non-occurrences of something. We had 6 previous babies that were all girls.  From the options we have, we have 6(2) = <<6(2)=12>>12 possibilities that we can choose the next baby from. So the number of negative occurrences plus the number of positive occurrences is 12 + 26 = <<12+26=38>>38.<n>From this we can calculate the probability given by: [total occurrences] + [total non-occurrences] = [total number of occurrences]<n>So the final answer here is 38

How many miles will you ride, in total?<n>Output:Let the variable x=the total mileage traveled<n>25 / 2 = <*25/2=12.5>>12.5 cent per mile<n>x(12.5) = <x*12.5=3p> <<3p>>3p miles traveled.<n>x = 28.5 miles<n>so you are going to make it to Disney World.<n>So the final answered is 28<n><n>Input:The average temperature of the world’s oceans is 3.6 degrees Celsius. You have a container of water with a temperature of 15°C, and you add 10 grams of salt per liter of water.<n>Output:Adding salt raises the temperature of a solution. If we assume that the density of the solution is the same as that of seawater, then every 10 grams that we add would increase the temperature of the water by 1.25°. We could also assume that the concentration of salt affects the heat of solution. In the last case, the heat of solution would be the sum of the heat capacity of water and the heat capacity of salt.<n>If we do the earlier model, then adding salt to the water would increase the temperature by 15° + 1.25(10g).<n>If we use the second model, the heat of solution of salt water is 0.16 J/(g·°C). Therefore, we would end up with 0.16(10g). Therefore, increasing the concentration from 0-10 grams would increase the temperature by a factor 1.09. <n>So the final answer<n>is 1

Leap years are divisible by four. 2100 is also a leap because 2100 -1900 (2000 -2000) is divisible by four. However no more of the evenly divisible by four should be taken in every century because it is also divisible by 100, 400 and 1000. 2008 was not a leap year as it is divided by 100 in that decade, and so 2020 will not occur since it is the 20th year of the two-year century and all leap years for century years are evenly divisible by 400. 2108 would be a leap year if nothing were taken in decade years after 1900 and before 2100. <n>The Leap 2020 is only possible to skip the 21st century.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday.

As we divide, the question becomes "by how much does one have to divide to end up with 46?" Since the correct answer has to be an integer, there has to be a whole number left over after we divide. The answer to "by how much does we have to divide to end with 46 minutes" is "5 minutes", so the answer to our question should be "45 minutes to 6 minutes".<n>So the final answer to this puzzle is 45 minutes to 41 minutes<n><n>Input: I was a little confused about the wording on this one. Let's take a look at the question: "How long is the period in which the temperature drops to 48 degrees, and the temperature stays below 48 degrees for three consecutive days?" My first response to this question was "Hmmm... well, how long IS 48 degrees?" I didn't know whether to say "48 hours", "48 minutes", or "48 seconds". So I tried thinking about the last sentence: "The temperature never reaches 48 degrees, but the

If the size of the town is constant, then for each day the number of people living there will increase by 25.<n>For n days, the population is Pn, so Pn = <<25*n=625>>625 For the population today, P = 1500 + 625 = <<1500+625=2125>>2125<n>Therefore, the population of the town is increasing at the rate of 625 each day.<n>So the final ans is 625<n><n>Input: A baseball player is going to the World Series. To make sure he takes extra toothpaste, he packs 12 extra tubes to his suitcase. He brings 1 extra pair of cleats and one extra hat. However, his baggage only has room for 40 items total. How many extra cleats can he bring?<n>Output: If the player packs three extra pairs of cleats, and one extra hat, he can't bring any extra cleats. This could be the answer.<n>If the only way to fit 1 extra item in his bag is to pack 43 items, then he will have to take 63 items with him. However, the player is limited to 40 items, and he needs room for his water bottle, so this can't be the answer.<n>Since there are 18 of each item, which is a set, he can only bring 4 of each item each.<n>To bring 4 extra pairs of cleats would mean that he needs to bring 13 extra items in total.<n>With 40 items total, he needs to bring 27 items in total. Bringing 63 items, including the extra cleats would not allow room for the 4 toothpastes or the 1

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input:What could a massive building be if it is not constructed well?

Hence, there is a 5-day gap between each month and the next. However, every four years, the number of days between Earths and the Sun is 366. If every four years, one month is skipped, what happens after 100 years?<n>Output: 100 x 4 = <<100*4=400>>400 years<n>400 / 4 = <<400/4=100>>10 years<n>When there are no leap years, each year has 365 days. So after 100, we go 0 + 100 * 365 = <<0+1

Choices:  A: running B: have fun C: balls touch D: winning E: get tired<n>Output:		Choice E: get tired<n>The purpose of running without competition is to enjoy it. Since enjoyment is defined by doing things you would love to do rather than having to or not having to do, you should do whatever it is you feel like doing.<n>You might like running because it gives your endurance a work out OR running might be a means to be able to play other sports, where you need to be quick on your feet. What you love doing is running because you enjoy it, without competition. Competition is when you run against other people, to see who is the better one. Since your purpose is to enjoy the sport, you could also run with others, but not at the same time, because whoever wins, loses.<n>The choice you should select is the answer that defines running.<n><n>To know if you choose the correct answer, consider the question: "What is the hope of cooking without a fire?"<n>If your answer is: "A: use gas instead", then you chose answer E that gets tired.<n>If you said "B: for fun", then you chose answer A of running.<n>If you said: "C: to make your stomach happy", then you chose the answer B of having fun.<n>If you said answer D: "winning", then you're answer is incorrect, because competition is not the point of running.

You are paid $8 per hour. After work, you like to listen to your favorite radio station. The total number of hours you will work and the time you will listen to your preferred radio station is the same. This is possible because the station stays on for 9 hours and it takes 10 minutes to get to work and 10 minutes to come back. How many hours of radio do you like to listen to?<n>Output: You will work for 4hours. So 4hours left + 10minutes(to-and-from work) = 4hours. Let "a" be 4hours.<n>This is true for 35 minutes. So, a-(35/60)*a = 0<n>So, 35 = a<n><n>So (35)*60=2100<n>You like to listen to the radio for 2100 minutes. i.e for 35 hours.<n>This means for 35 hours, you will not get payed for the 4 hours which you worked<n>So the total pay for 4hours of work you get is (8)*35 = 280<n>So the total cost for 35hours of listening to the radio is<n>8*35 = 2+8*35 =325<n>So the total cost of for 35h = 280+325 = 605<n>Since we had a starting amount of 0

They are seated in six sections: the first section has three people in it, the second section has four, and so on. There are empty seats between each group. What is the least number of moviegoers that could go into the theatre, so that the group can be seated in the same sections?<n>Output: With 20 people, we can still organize the group into 6 equal groups if it's a multiple of 4 people. We can also choose a multiple of 5 and put them on the end or beginning (the seats are not arranged, so any seat is good). With a multiple of 3 people, we can either put a group together in the middle, or put 2 groups together at the beginning and end. With a multiple of 2 people, we can put a group at the beginning only.<n>Let's work from an integer of 20. If we're allowed a multiple of two people, the only solution is to have a group of 19 people sit in the middle of the room. If we're given a multiple of 3, then there are many cases:<n>  (1) 19 people.<n>  (2) 18 people, seated at the ends.<n>  (3) 17 people, seated in the middle.<n>  (4) 16 people, either seated at the middle or end.<n>  (5) 0 people.

How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input:John joined the army because he wanted to see the world.  When the fighting started, he only saw what sort of things? Choices:  A: fort B: orphans C: battlefield D: other countries E: war<n>Output:		Let x = the sort of thing John saw. A, B, C, D, E have 4, 3, 2, 5, 3 letters, respectively. Since letter count is important in this vocabulary test, words cannot have fewer letters than letters in a word. Thus, if A is not a correct response, then x cannot be the answer.<n><n>In the question stem, John wanted to see many different things in the world, so one would think that A: fort, B: orphans, C: battlefield should be true. However, any word must always be shorter than a word (remember the letters in words matter, so x cannot have letters less than letters in words). This is the reason B is not a correct response.<n>Similarly, words D: other countries and E: war are longer than words A: fort, B, C: battlefield, and do not match the conditions of the test. Thus, we can rule out these answers, and only C: battlefield is the correct answer.<n>So x = battlefield.<n><n>Input: Jane is painting at the house. She goes to the house once per day. She visits her grandmother at dinner. She takes her lunch break after breakfast. She visits the cottage once a week. She works from Monday to Saturday. How many days per week she goes to the cottage?<n>Output: Since Jane is at cottage on her lunch break that is at 11:00 and 12:00 and she gets lunch at 1:00 after breakfast that should not be included in her weekly work day. Therefore from 1:00 to 5:00 she would be going to cottage after lunch break<n>So Jane will be going to cottages on Sunday.<n><n>Therefore she will be at cottage on:<n>Monday(8:00 AM to 5:01 PM), Tuesday(8:00 to 4:59 PM), Wednesday(8:01 to 5:59 PM), Thursday(4:50 to 8:00 PM), Fridie(11:00 TO 5:05 PM), Saturday(11:01 to 12:01)<n><n>So she will be at cuttage

How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input:Where would you find a sign with some people lined up next to it? Choices:  A: bus stop B: street corner C: roadblock D: fast food drive thru E: city<n>Output:		Since a street corner has a sign which has some people lined up, let x represent the total number of people lined up.<n>A street corner has a sign and on that sign there is someone yelling the phrase "X people can't make it"<n>Let y be the number of people the phrase refers to.<n>So the equation is x + y = 2<n>Subtraction x from both sides gives us y = x - 2<n>Plugging in 2 as x, we get y = <<19=19>>19<n>Therefore, on a street corner there are 19 ( x = 19) people lined up. So the final answer is  street corner<n><n>Input: You are at the laundromat. If your total cost will be 5 dollars to go to the laundromat and do laundry for 10 loads, how much will it cost to do laundry for just 5 loads?<n>Output: If doing 5 loads costs 5 dollars, then 10 loads costs 5*10 = <<5*10=50>>50 dollars.<n>Let x be the number of loads.<n>So the equation for the number of loads costing 50 dollars is 50 = x<n>Dividing by 5, we find that x = <<50/5=10>>1.<n>For every 10 loads you do, it costs $1, so for 5 loads it costs $1, for 20 loads it costs $2, etc.<n>Since each doll goes through the washer and dryer twice, you can find out the cost of $1 by multiplying your cost by two.<n>So for 5 loads, the cost is $2, or 2*1 = <<2*1=2>>2 dollars<n>Therefore, the final answer is laundromat only<n><n>Input: For a long trip, a father and son packed up a tent, three sleeping bags, two pillows, and five blankets.

This is an example of the positive side.The people that are doing this mean well. (I won't go into too much detail about this but it is a good trait )<n><n>If you choose D, then my answer will be  that being cruel which is the negative side is doing the opposite, harming others.  The reason it is cruel  is because when you do this, their are usually consequences.<n>(In other words, when you harm the people in a way where they are affected. Not when you help them. )<n><n>So which one could the person that is mean, could it be:<n><n>A) the cruel person's answer = D( because the altruistic trait couldnt harm anyone )<n><n>B) the altruistic person's answer = A( because the cruel trait can't harm anyone )<n><n>So my guess was A which is correct (  and the positive trait could do no harm )<n><n><n><n><n>

What might this hole be called? Choices:  A: hill B: gorge C: sandplain D: cliff E: mountain<n>Output:		The biggest hole would not be a hill or a gorge, since a hill or gorge is not a hole like this.  There are too many smaller hills or gorges to describe it as one of these things.  It would be difficult to describe a big plain or a big cliff as a hole, since a cliff or plain is typically shaped like a large mountain or wall in front of a body of water.  The only possible type of hole that can describe this one, out of all the answer choices, is "mountain".<n>So the correct answer choice would be "mountain"<n><n>Input:Sam went on a trip to Hawaii, where he discovered his love for surfing.

A formal gathering of people and celebrities. C.  A formal gatherings for the Japanese people who have suffered in recent wars. D.  None of the aforementioned.<n>Output:The United States President, unlike the Prime Minister of Japan, visits Japan on a more regular basis; when he and his wife do visit Tokyo, the Japanese government usually hosts a formal gathering for both the president and his wife.  There is also a ceremony to pray for peace and harmony in Japan that usually happens before the president's arrival, and there exists a ceremony to honor the people that have died recently.<n>Since neither of these events occur in the same location at the same time as the formal gathering, none of those choices match the criteria.  The event that matches best would be a formal gathering which takes place  once every four years since that is as often

Choices:  option A: a light speed ship option B: a warp ship option C: a teleportation gate option D: none of the above<n>Output: Light travels 186,000 miles per second (in a vacuum). Therefore, if we have a speed of < 1/19 of the speed of light, we'd need to travel 3218600 miles / 192 seconds = 16,895 miles per minute. Thus, by using a light speed ship, it would take 16895 minutes and about 105 hours to get to Mars. If we are going at 2/19 the speed of light, it would take < 17/19*105*192 = 129 minutes.</17/19><n>If we use a warp ship then it would take about 7084 years.<n>If we use a teleportation gate then there is no wait time and it would cost $400 million (the first few times) and $26,000 ever time thereafter.<n>So the final answers are A and D (in that order)<n>

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input:A musician is most likely to perform a concerto for clarinet with what type of group? Choices:  A: music store B: orchestra C: jazz band D: rock band E: music studio<n>Output:		A person would likely perform a concerto on their clarinet with an orchestra.<n><n>We know that an orchestra could put a clarinet in because it is a small piece and doesn't take much to put one in an orchestra. I.e. orchestra<n><n>Jazz band would make no sense because the clarinet can't handle loud tones.<n><n>Instruments that sound loud usually play in rock bands.<n><n>We also know that a music studio wouldn't necessarily fit a person playing the clarinet either.<n><n>So the final answer to this question is Orchestra<n><n>Input: A car is traveling as fast as the wind, blowing away from you at 65 miles per hour, when a cloud blocks its progress. At what speed must the car travel so that the wind travels with it?<n>Output: The car is traveling at 65 miles an hour (mph).<n>It may be traveling as fast as a wind, but what's the point if there's a cloud?<n>What's the purpose of this scenario?<n>If the wind is blowing at 65 mph, and there's a cloud in its way, what happens?<n>The car would keep moving at 65 m/h. It wouldn't have to move at 67 or 71, just 67 or 68. No matter what it is, as long as the car is moving as fast as the wind.<n>We can solve this problem using simple proportions.<n>We have two speeds, one is the wind blowing at 66 MPH, and one is the car driving at 26 MPH.<n>There is no change in the car's speed, because its speed is equal to the speed of the wind.<n>The car's speed = wind speed - wind speed = 0 (the car's speed is zero)<n><n>The wind speed is (953)<n><n>The car's change must equal zero, so the car must be traveling at 953 (MPH)<n>Thus, car's speed = 953 and wind speed = (953) MPH<n><n>The wind is going to be 65 and the car is going to be 953<n><n>The wind and the car are both going to be traveling at 66 mph

He takes 3 hours every morning, which means he's awake for almost the entire day.<n>A: Unlikely. 8 hours daily = 48 total hours. 50% of 48 is about 24. 3 Hours every morning = 18, so it is unlikely he is late to work.<n>B: Unlikely. He is likely to stay clean and look good for his entire work day.<n>C: Unlikely. Taking a long shower every morning increases the risk to injury.<n>D: Unlikely.

"B" also can lead to E being picked as the answer. (E) is incorrect because the wind blowing against the house is a good analogy for a person feeling like it is very hot. A fan is not as effective when it blows against a house.<n><n><n>	<n>

Alicia has a 30% discount on her total ticket purchase. How much does Ahmad's ticket cost?<n>Output: Alicia buys a ticket for $197 because the online price of the cheapest ticket she found is -197 * 0.5 / 1.3 = <<197*0.5/1.3>>0.5 = <<50x50=250>>250, which means she has a discount of 197 - 250 = <<197-250=37>>37 dollars, which leaves her with the bill of 250-37 = 213. Ahmad buys a ticket for 125 dollars, because 213 / 1.3  = <<213/1.3>>1.3 = <<213=161>>161.<n>Combined, we have: -197 * ( 161 / 213) / 0.5 + 125 = << -197*(161/213)/0.5 +125>>125, which simplifies to 161 * 161 / (0.5 * 213) = <<161*161/0.5*213>>213, which is 427. So Ahmad's flight costs 427 dollars.

So, America was discovered (by Europe) in January 1784 and was formed into a country in 27 July 1776. So, America did not exist before 1776 AD, nor before 27 July 2020 BC.<n>B: Antarctica was not a continent because it was part of America (America before 22 July 2021). Even the Europeans (the ones that first discovered it) only called it a Continent in March 1778 before they formed it into an official continental piece of land.<n>C: America was not a country before 4 July 1777. Nor was America a continent.

Choices:  A: spinning wheel B: on a ladder C: hospital bed D: legroom E: grand piano<n>Output:		If a person has a broken leg, then they lay in a bed.<n>Then, choosing one of the choices to be correct and the rest inaccurate, we find that Hospital Beds B is the correct answer.<n>Since each bed fits one person, a bed's legroom must be large enough to fit one person's leg. Therefore, we need a large legroom bed, and this bed must be a hospital bed since it is not possible to spin a bed or find the elevation of a bed at a spinning wheel.<n>This means "hospital bed" is the correct answer. So the final answer is B<n><n>Input: Choose 2 numbers that add to 13.<n>Output: The equation for sum_of_two_numbers = a+b = is: \(a+b=k\)<n>The equation for two numbers multiplied is \(a*b = k\)<n>Therefore, the equation for two numbers that must sum to 13, a+b=k, is also \(a+b= 13, a*b = k\) since \(a+b = 13\) is a restatement of the second equation above.<n>Plugging the numbers 2 and 11 into the second equation: \(2*11 = 22\) since \(2*11= 22\) is a restatment of the first equation.<n>Since sum = 13, a and b must be multiples of 13.<n>Therefore, we need to pick combinations of integers that sum to 13. <n>Since \(2*11\ne 22\), only \((2,11)\), \((3,10)\), and \((4,9)\) are valid answers.

What is the area? Choices: 36 ft A: the front B: the width C: the rear D: the wheel well E: the trunk.<n>Output: The length of my wheel well is the same as the width. The width of my car is twice the length of the car. There are 8 square feet in a wheel well, and 16 square feet in a wheel. Therefore, there are 16 wheel well areas. There are six parts of each wheel. therefore, there are 100 wheel well areas. the sum of the length and width is 20. divide the resulting figure by 2, and you find that there is 75% of the front of the car and 25 % of the rear. There is a total of 100 square inches in each square foot. Therefore, there are (100 * 100)/20 square inches in the wheel well. Each square inch is 1/4 inch wide and 1/4 in length. This gives you 4*4 = 16 inches on each side of the wheel. Therefore, the front of the car has 7.5*16 = 120 inches, while the rear has (25)-(1/4 of 75)=37.5 inches. The sum of the front and rear is (7.5 + 37.5) = 45 inches. This is one fifth of the entire length.<n>

Your cow is now pregnant and you find out that she is going to have a donkey foal. What is the total number of different animals on your farm?<n>Output: Solution: First we need to calculate the total amount of animals we have and let's call the total amount A. Then A = 5 + 4 + 3 + 1 = 13. Then we can subtract the amount of animals we bought A - (5 +4 + 3 +1) = <<-1>>-1  Therefore there is 1 animal left. Now A = 13 - 1 = 12 So if you count the animals there are 12 of them, 5 different bulls, 3 goats, 4 horses, and your cow, who is expecting a donkey. Therefore there are a total of 12 animals on your farm, the last one being the pregnant cow.<n><n>Input:You are a farmer. A bull and a horse are born in london.

However, if we are ignorant as we are doing, and suffer while we are doing it, then we are not being blissful. This, again, brings us to ignorance where we are still suffering. Therefore, being ignorant is not blissful.<n>E: If we are judged for our ignorance, then there would be no problem as long as it does not lead to suffering.<n>So we would eliminate the 3 incorrect answers and get left with 2. Therefore, we would conclude that ignorance is not an excuse for a crime.<n>So the final question is <n><n>Input: A 16 inch pizza can feed 2 people. A 12 inch pizza can also feed 2 people.

What is the total height of the family?<n>Output: We will start by determining the product of all the fractions. This product is <<2:3:5=15>>15.<n>Since the product is a mixed number, let it be represented as<n>(2xh+3)/(5xh+7). So the total height is (2xh+3)*(5xh+3)/xh = 51/h<n>Let xh = <<1>>1 to get 5(2 + 3)+7= 51<n>Now, xh = <<1(1+3)/5>>1(1+3/5)<n>Therefore 5xh+7=5(1+3/2+3//5)=69/7.<n>5xh+7 = <<5x1/7+7>>5x1/7.<n><n>So xh = 69/5.<n>Therefore 51/h = <<69/5>>69/5. This means that the total height of the entire<n>family is 69/5 * h = <<69/11>>11 * h units tall, since the denominator is<n>equivalent to the 1+3/2.<n>So the final answers is 11

How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input:If you hit someone while driving what could happen to that person? Choices:  A: deaths B: get arrested C: moving D: using gas E: may die<n>Output:		When you drive the wrong way, it's not you, but another driver who's going in the right direction. If this car stops abruptly, there may be a traffic accident and possibly an injury. Or if this driver wants to move suddenly, another driver may be hit and injured in accidents. Death is impossible as people usually die only when they die.<n>

This is true after removing dogs that are owned by people and pigeons that are owned by a bird control company. In how many dog- or cat-owner families is this true?<n>Output: First, find the number of pigeon owners: Let x = number of pigeon owner x = the total number f dogs x - the total number of dog owners<n>x - 1/2 = the total number of pigeon and dog owners<n>So x = 36<n>In a dog or cat owner family, if the person has a dog, then they are a dog owner and not a cat owner as long as their dog isn't owned by the bird control company. So the person is counted as a dog owner twice, not a cat owner at all, counted once each.<n>So the final number of dog owners is 18/2 = <<18/2=9>>9<n>If you add the number of dog owners by the number of cat owners, you get what would be the same number of families. So in how many dog or cat owners families is this true, the answer is 9<n><n>Input:There are 19 students in a debate club.

Choices:  A: amusement park B: urban area C: airport D: shopping malls E: train station<n>Output:		Let x represent the amusement park.<n>The parking lot's location is C which means that there is C-E or there is nothing between the parking lot and any of the five options. This can be represented by (1,2,3,4,5) or (6,7,8,9,10) - two pairs of numbers.<n>x = 0 means that the shopping bags are being dropped off in the parking lot.<n>x = 25 means that the shopping malls are being dropped off in a train station.<n>x = 50 means that someone bought something from the parking lot to buy something in the parking lot and drop it off in the parking spot.<n>Therefore, there's something in between each pair of numbers except for when it's one of them. In other words, (1,2,4,5) means that the shopping bag is dropped off in an amusement park or a shopping mall, (1,3,6) means that shopping bag is dropped of at an airport or a shopping malls, and (1,5,9) means that the shopper dropped the shopping bags in an amusement park and an airport.<n>Therefore the correct answer is A<n><n>Input: Is my bag in your bag?<n>Output: No, because the numbers were not matching.<n>If the bag in the second statement was in the bag of the person, the person would have to have the same number as the one the bag is in.

And, it must be an astronomical number because x = A,B,C or D from the answer choices.<n>Solving: 12x = x = <<12x = x>> x<n>x/x = <<12x/x=12>>12<n>Divide both sides by 12 so that the fraction is turned into a decimal: Divide both sides by 4 in order to convert the fraction into a whole number: The answer we have so far is 20/4 or 5.<n>In order to solve for the X, subtract 5 from both sides: Subtracting 5 from both sides, we find that<n>X - 5 = <<X=5>>X - 5 = 15<n>The answer so far is 15 and is correct.<n>So, Legal fees are astronomical in the case of marriage because of the fact that legal fees are not costless. So the final answer is legal fees<n><n>Input: The table shows the heights, in centimeters, of male students and female students in the highschool basketball team. Height does not depend on sex.

Choices:  A: run programs B: play games C: control model D: power down E: reason exists<n>Output:		Let us say he plays games with the computer. Let us denote x as the number of games he plays in the office.<n>Since his day is not over yet, he has not done everything. So, he has still got (x + 1) games left to play.<n>When his day is over, that is, after he has done all things, he will not play any games with the computer anymore. So, after his day is over, there no games left to play, that is, (x + 1).<n>So, the no. of games he will play in his day for every number x is: (x + 1)! (The reason for using exclamation sign is given at the end of the solution.)<n>Therefore, number of games he plays at his office is:  (55 +1)! = 61.<n>So, he plays 61 games every day, which means he plays 821 games over a week for 7 days (including monday).<n>Let x be the no. of games the office employee plays.<n>Now, the total games he plays in his week will be (x + 821), that is x - 821, for these days (from monday onward) he is unable to play any because the day is over for office hours. Therefor, the total number of games he plays for a given week,<n><n>( x - 820) * ( x - 819) * ( x -818)... * ( x -821)<n><n>So the no. of games over a week is: ( x - 82)**x<n><n>Hence, x = 23, and, 23 times of the no. of games played by all office employees in a given week is : ( 23 - 7)/ (2 - 0 ) = 4<n>So, 23 office employees in a week will play 4 games over a week.<n>So, a total of 23*4 games will be played every week over a day.<n>So, he will play the maximum of 4 games every day.<n>So, the final answer is 4<n><n>Input: Which of the following are true about the following statements?

When a trapezoid is referred to, usually, the shape appears to be like the one on the left. This illustration doesn't do the trapezoid justice as the trapezoid can appear to be either above or below, and can have a large disparity in it's height. To get the accurate trapezoidal area, we must factor in one of the greatest equations in world mathematics: The Pythagorean Theorem.<n>By looking at the diagram on the left and the illustration on the right, you can see that the triangle on the left has the right angle and the two angles on the right are equal to the right angle. By using the Pythagorean theorem, we can solve for the missing triangles' area. We assume that the trapezoid is on the left and that our triangles are on the right. <n>As you can see,

Choices:  A: bathroom B: solar system C: coffee shop D: space shuttle E: airport<n>Output:		The answer is "D." We know that the human's position over the water will be the same as his position over his house from the question before. Since "a plane lands at an airport, why don't the houses land here?" "the plane has no choice but this spot here because of gravity." There are many choice of buildings at an airport. And since buildings fall, human will fall if human has the same position as the buildings like airport building. We know that buildings fall down to ground because of gravity. So in order to solve this problem, we should identify position of human and buildings before solving this problem by analysing the question.<n><n><n>### Instruction: Answer the following programming questions.<n><n>#### Question: What is the meaning of a "zero index" in programming?<n><n>Input: A zero index is an index that starts with the first element of a list.<n>Output: An ArrayList<Integer> called "numbers" will contain the element {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; a list that has the integer index start at 0.

Freddy's local call is 5 cents. So 5 cents for 45 minutes is 5*45=<5*45=325>>325 cents for calling his father.He pays 775 cents for international calls for his brother.So Freddy Paid 325+770<775=1150>>1150 cents. 1000 cent =1 dollar.So Freddy paid 1150/15=<1150/90=1.316>>1.316 for each time he called his family on New Year.<n>## Tutorial Sollons #3<n>>We use a little bit of math to solve this problem.<n>In 8 hours,30 minutes,1/48 equals to, 48*1/8=<48*1/20= 7.5>>7.5 hours. It is because 24 hours equals to one day, and 8 hours for each day is one-half day.  So 30 minutes are one-ninth of a day then it will be 8*3/9=<8*3/9=>10.5>>10.5 hours, then we add 10.5 =<10.5/7 =1.5>>1.5 hours for each day. So the answer is 10.

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input:Where is one likely to hear a harpsichord? Choices:  A: make noise B: band C: museum D: concert hall E: rubber band<n>Output:		The word for harpsichords is "harpsichore." The prefix "pre" means "before." If one harpsichore is a harpsichord, then the opposite of a harpsichord is a "non-harpsichore." Thus, D is a correct answer. A is a noun and therefore not a word to hear on a harpsichord. The word for a non-quiet place is not "quietly." Thus, B is not correct. One would not hear a harpsichore make noise or hear a harpsichor make noise.<n>The word for a place with a lot of instruments is "concerto." Thus, A is not correct.<n>C is a museum, not an instrument. Thus, C is not a likely location to hear a harpsochord.<n>E is a noun and thus not a word to hear a harpsicord.<n>So the final answers is D<n><n>Input: I have two dollars and you have 19 cents. I pay you back. How much money do you have now?<n>Output: 19 cents plus two dollars is three dollars and 19 cents<n>Adding the two cents to the 39 cents equals $ 1.36<n><n>Input: I live up the road.<n>Output: I live somewhere.<n>I am on the road.<n>The prefix "up" means that something other than just up is going on. What is going on is some sort of action. We must therefore have three different actions at the same time. A person does an action alone. Therefore, I means (only) one is living up the road.<n>I is only another word for the person.<n>So the final anwer is 0<n><n>Input: I see a blue cow eating grass.<n>Output: I see a cow.<n><n>I see the cow.<n><n>I is pronounced "eye"<n><n>So the final anwser is 2<n><n>Input: I saw Tanya in the street.<n>Output: I saw Tanya<n><n>I saw someone.<n><n>I is an "eye" word.<n><n>So the final answer for this is 1<n><n>Input: I don't like the way you eat.<n>Output: I don't eat the way you like.<n>I am a person that is not like the way you eat

You then roll all 100 pieces of gum or 300 pieces of gumbulking in your backpack, and leave each stick individually or as a group. Each piece of chewing gum will be 5% moist, no matter how you store it or how you bring it along for your weekend long bike ride.  How much water do you need to pack to last your weekend ride?  Choices: <<A>>2, 599 ounces <<B>>2, 1667 ounces <<C>>2, 1250 ounces <<D>>2, 700 ounces <<E>>2, 500 ounces <n>Output: Assuming the 5%/stick rule is true, 100 pieces will weigh about 5 ounces/piece of gum, and 300 will weigh 15 ounces/ piece of gumbulking. So assuming that 100 pieces weigh 5 ounces, 300 pieces weigh  15 ounces, and both weights are ounces, we  get  1713, 9053, 6400, and 5400 respectively.<n>Now take the lowest number 599, so that you have a minimum amount of water needing to be packed, and the greatest 9053. Now divide this by the two numbers to result in each piece, which is  599/(1 250 463 500 9053/(1 251 500 703 500<n>So the fraction of each water bottle should be 599/(3 157 814 1

Choices:  A: persia B: table C: living room D: house E: desk<n>Output:		A rug has 4 pronunciations: rug, rug, rug, and rug.<n>A rug is a cloth covering on the floor.<n>A rug under the table would be beneath the desk surface, below the furniture.<n>A rug under a living room table would be beneath the living room surface, below the furnishings.<n>All spills would be cleaned up immediately, the rug under the table would end up under the furniture/desk and the living room rug would end up under the living room furnishings. Hence, the rugs ending up under the desk and under the living room furnishing will do nothing to solve this spill problems.<n>But these rugs are of no use if they aren't under the table or the living room table.<n>Even if spills do happen, it is still better to put the rug under the house instead of anything else but the table so that the rugs will do what they were initially bought to do. Hence, the correct answer is "the house".<n><n>### Instruction:<n><n>- Instructions for the data entry<n>- Make use of the data entry field provided for the data entry<n><n>### Explanation:<n>- I think the first question doesn't have any explanation because: the first question is a multiple choice.<n>

While many theaters and plays are produced by unpaid actors, those actors are not actors for which the theater pays nothing. A theater which pays its actors nothing would be uncommon and would not be in a populated area since many plays and theaters are found in cities and other small populated areas.<n>Choices C and E are incorrect because theater companies often hire more experienced actors paying them salaries.

It continues to drive till it reaches the nearest tire store, 25 miles away. The bus continues to drive towards the tire store at the same average speed, but the tire on the left rear wheel is flat, making it impossible to use the accelerator. How long before the bus reaches the tire store?<n>Output: The number of miles is not constant, the average speed should only be calculated over a time span.<n>By assuming that the bus keeps the rate of average speed during the time that it was driving after the tire on the rear left tire went flat, we can find the average speed. For instance, the bus travels 40 miles every hour. That would mean after 15,385 seconds when the driver stopped the bus, he should be able to continue driving at an average speed of 40 miles per hour. To find the time taken before the bus reaches the nearest tire repair shop, we can find the time when the bus reaches the point where it should be in order to reach the tire repair shop. This would mean that the bus should be 15385/40 = <<15385/-40=384>>384 seconds from the tire repair shop when it was traveling at its maximum speed.<n>So the answer is 384<n><n>Input:A car starts from the same place at the same time.

Choices:  A: strain B: though C: happiness D: realization E: understanding<n>Output:		The correct answer is "strain". We use the word "straining" to mean someone or something that is exerting a lot of effort to do something. You are straining while lifting a heavy box, or a muscle is in strain from the exertion of lifting the box. We use the word "stirring" to mean something else. We stir a pot when we gradually move something around in it or we stir the pot when the liquid begins to boil. When we are stirring we notice that something is happening inside. When we are straining we notice that something is hard to do and we find it irritating. When we stir a muscle it begins to twitch because we are moving it so slowly. We would strain to lift the box because it is too hard to lift it and we are forcing it.<n>So the final choice is "D".<n><n>Input: There were three friends, Jadon, Kane and Reagan.

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input:Bill was awaking, what was happening to him physiologically? Choices:  A: tiredness B: grogginess C: discomfort D: getting out of bed E: eyes opening<n>Output:		Let's call the moment Bill woke up time zero.<n>According to his question, we can see that there are 5 steps:<n>1)  At 1 minute (7:15), Bill got tired.<n>2)  At 5 minutes (7:15 + 5 min), Bill got groggy.<n>3)  At 10 minutes (7:10 + 10 min), Bill got discomfort.<n>4)  At 15 minutes (7:05 + 15 min), Bill got out of bed.<n>5)  At 20 minutes (6:55 + 20 min), Bill got his eyes opened.<n>So, we can say that this timeline is increasing and that starting at the beginning of time to Bill waking, there is a constant increase - which is why we chose C<n>So the final answer as C<n>

You will need to write multiple versions of the same function.  However there are limits on the number of times you can use the same code.  When using the same code, you will either need to reduce the amount of times the code is run or replace the functionality of two different code blocks. Do not skip to the next question.  Think this one through.  The answers will become apparent when you try a few.\n\n#### Input: 1. The following function reads the last letter in a given string and adds 10.\n\nFor example, if the string is 'Hello,' the function would return '1.'\nIf the string is 'Welcome', the function would return '5.'\n\nIf the string is longer than one word, the return should be the final character minus 10.\nOutput: '1' '5'\n\n#### Input: The following will print all the vowels in a given string.\n\nIn some cases the same vowel will occur twice or three times in the same string.

First thing's first, you may consider use of `collections.Counter` to count number of choices in answer choices.\n\n2. Then `collections.Counter(answer_choices).most_common()` would return the most occuring choices and its count in that order. You may compare the count of most_common() result with `len(answer_choices)`. `collections.Counter` would take time O(number of choices).\n\n3. This can be optimized even better to take overall linear time `d = (A * len(answer_choices) + B * len(answer_sources))` and then to use list `d[d>0]` to eliminate the ones that is more costly.\n\n4. Similarly for second question, if we know the answer choices `answer_choices` and answer sources `answer_sources` can we make a new list `d` that is a value in answer_choices at index of answer_sources? We can find it by `answer[answer_sources[idx]]`.\nThese can take `O(A * len(answer))` or `O(A)` time. That's why it is important to use big enough input array.\n\n\n5.

You can store anything there, and use it for input and output.\n\n### A good practice what variables to use?\n\nInput or output variables are best written in lower case (i.e. start with a lower case letter or underscore). You should not have multiple variables with the same name. For example:\n    user_input, answer_1, answer_2\n\nYou can pass in a local variable as a parameter to a function (this is called function argument), as you can a parameter (this is called parameter pass).

Read the number of choices to find the range of choices and the size of each of the key values.\n2. Read both choices of each key (choices of type string) to store the choice_index of each key.\n3. Read each choice which can be in the form of string of lowercase or uppercase character: the value can either be the integer 0  to 3 or the string  A, B, C or D.\n4. Read the character to check if it is alphabetic (a-z or A-Z) or is it a number. if it is alphapbetic, then convert that into integer and continue reading to check if the previous integer is the index of a certain key. if the previous index is the number of the chosen key, get the integer corresponding  to that key to choose the key(the size of that can be stored in an array of size the current size of the key). if the previous index does not correspond to any key, store the character in the next character to read. Otherwise, store the previous index to represent the key_index in the character type key.\n5.

You have to determine if any of the strings are palindromes and then put them in order according to which string is the longest palindrome. If more than one string is a palindrome you must list the strings in length order, so the strings need not appear in sorted order.\n\nExample: Input: Hello World Output: Hello, World Solution\n\nNot a palindrome: A good idea is to read all the strings and check if each character of each string is the same as the previous one.

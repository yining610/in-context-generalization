How much did John's purchases cost?\n\nOutput:  \nIn order to calculate the amount John had spent on nuts and dried fruits, we will need 2 equations:\n1: kg of nuts is x dollars  \n\n2: kg of fruits is y dollars  \n\nSince there are kg of fruits and kg of nuts we will need 2 variables:  \ny = kg of fruits  \nx = kg of nuts  \n\nNow to figure out what the price for each kg of nuts and fruits is we will get these values from the first equation:\n\nFor nuts:\n1 / kg of nuts x (kg of nuts / kg of nuts )\n1 / 3 x 3/3 = 1 / 3 = dollars for 1kg of nuts\n\nFor fruits:\n1 / kg / kg of fruits / kg of nuts   / kg of nuts =  \n1 / 3.5 x kg of nuts kg of nuts = dollars  \nWhich is the same as  \n\ny =  \n\nOr  \ndollars\n\nSolving for x:  \nx =  \n\nSince x represents kg of nuts that John bought and the value of x is  \n\nWe subtract one number from the other in order to get:  \nAdam spent dollars on nuts and dollars on fruits.  \n\nSubstituting dollars for x and dollars for y into our initial problem:  \nWhich was  \nTotal cost is  \n\n\n\n\n\n#### Input #2\nInput: Johns went to the gym three times a week.

Good luck! \nAnswer #1:\nInput: The question says Adam bought 3 kilos of nuts and 3 kilos of dried fruits, but in the answer it says that one kilogram of nuts cost $12 and one of dried fruit costs 8. This means he bought it in two different stores, which the question does not imply.\n\nAnswer #2:\nInput: The problem statement says \"how many hours did filling the tank take\".  This statement means total amount of hours in filling it and it should not make any difference if he fills it once then leaves or if he does it every day.\n\nThe original problem should be: How many hours does he use to fill the tank.\n\nAnswer #3:\nInput: I just went through the instructions so I don't know what do you think it is?\n\nAnswer #4:\nInput: How much does he pay for 868fl oz?\n\nA dollar is 16 oz, so 868 oz is equivalent to 53.85 dollars.\n\nAnswer #5:\nInput: The original problem statement is wrong, as it asks about the amount of coffee and water drink per day.

The final number is two more than the number of widgets, or the height of the box times the area of the box divided by the area of each widget.\n\n- Overall cost is one-third the daily cost per member less the cost of each lesson.\n\n- The key to this equation is \"stock worth $100\", which means there are 100 stock, but we do not know each one's cost.\n\n- The merchant has 29.5 \"coin equivalents\", or the sum of every coin in both accounts plus half the value of the account that only has fewer coins.\n\n- The difference between the percentage of liquid in the account and the total liquid in the account can be found by dividing the percentage by 100. We then multiply these to show percents.\n\n- If Adonis had enough shampoo for everyone else, then he could use the same logic for the hot sauce: divide the percentage by the total, multiply, then subtract from 1.\n\n- Divide by.20 to get the discounted amount.\n\n- Divides by the total, and the total is equal to 1.\n\n### Test your skills:\n\n#### Write your code in the editor below:\n```sql\n/*Input\n\nOutput\n48\n*/\nSELECT SUM(age)\nFROM Users;\n```\n![screenshot of SQL][img-logo]\n\n#### Test your answers:\n\n- [Your answer: 868][ans-answer]\n- [Correct answer: 862][ans-correct]\n\n#### Next Step\n* [Mental Ability Test 5 Problem 561][ex3561]\n\n[img-logo]: https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=screenshot+of+SQL&message=SQL&color=gray&style=for-the-badge\n[ans-answer]: /youranswer.md\n[ans-correct]:", "answer": "B: fast food restaurant"}

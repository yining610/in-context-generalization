Choices:  A: jar B: stick to fingers C: beehive D: stick to fingers E: farmer's market<n>Output:		D: 01. A jar of honey is not the same as honey directly from a hive.  A jar of honey might contain honey that came from a variety of different places and might contain preservatives or even be fake.  Jarred honey is generally made in a big plant rather than being bottled right on the premises.  You are more likely to find honey in bulk on a farm or at the farmer's market.  A: 002. Choosing honey from a bottle means that you are getting something that has probably been purified a bit.  If you are getting the honey from a shop, the chances are that it has been heated up so that the pollen is filtered out.  This reduces the benefits that you will get from honey by removing all nutrients and vitamins that were inside of the honeycomb.  Honeycomb honey is also less likely to have added preservatives unlike honey in a bottle.  So, if you want to eat healthier, go for honeycomb honey.  B: 003. Honey tastes more raw and pure when eaten from a comb.  Honey is meant to have beeswax present, which gives it its wonderful taste.  This taste is also what makes it popular and is the reason honey is used in a wide range of different dishes.  When honey is placed on a stick to be eaten, you will find that it has a very different taste from honey as you may buy from a shop.  C: 004. If you are not able to purchase honey that is taken from bees, you can always just get the honey straight from a plant if you want to try an organic alternative.  You will find that beeswax can taste different depending on the kind of flower that the bees have used to produce the honey.  This means that you can actually try different types of beeswax and see which one you like.  Honey off of the plant will have a slightly different taste to honey from a comb.  D: 005. Beeswax can be used as a great natural replacement for petroleum jelly.  It can also be used in soaps, cosmetics, and even polish.  If you apply beesw

E: draw pictures A represents the first term<n>Output:E<n><n>## Solution<n>- For first question, we need to find the total number of days.  (60 days+11 days)= 71<n>- For the second question, the given information is number of days, number of head of cattle and the number of trips to be made. So we need to find the hours for each trip. For each 20 head cattle, it takes 60 minutes and since total distance covered each trip is 60 miles, each trip will take 2 hours. Since total number of days is 40, total number of trip will be 20 (40/2). Hence total number of hours of transporation = 40 * 20 = 800.<n>- For the third one, we need to find total number of days and total number of trips for given amount. If total days = 14, trip = 10 and total amount = 500, number of trips = 10/5 = 2.<n>- For the fourth question, we need to find the money that each boy gets. The given information was amount, percentage and number of girls. So divide 5 in every amount by 5 and 2. That gives us an amount of 100. Multiply 100 by (5/5+2)/100 = 52. So total money received will be 100 * 52 = 5200. <n>- For the fifth one, we need to divide the amount by total days. Total number of days is 180 and divide the amount by total number of days = total days = 180/500. That will give you 3.6. Since the amount is greater than the given number of days, we have to get a whole dollar amount by rounding off. To this, we add 1 to the amount till we get an amount that is greater than 3.6. This will give us an amount 5.  So total amount received for medication will be 5 * 2.5 = 12.5<n>- For the sixth one, we need to

Choices:  A: tardiness B: looking good C: injury D: vacation E: neatness<n>Output:		A<n>```<n><n>#### Explanation:<n><n>A. This code snippet takes advantage of the fact Python provides multiple output options, one of which is print(out).<n><n>```<n>import math<n>input = "Car rental agency charged $30/day  for a car, or  $190 for a rental longer than a week."<n>print(math.ceil(input.split()[1] * 7))<n>```<n>```<n>B. We use if statements and switch statements along with math.ceil function, as well as print to separate the multiple choice answers into separate columns.<n><n>```<n>def main():<n>    rental = int(input())<n>    print("Output: "+ <n>        "A"+"B"+"C"+"D"+"E".split()[rental-1]) <n>main()<n>```<n>```<n>C. Python's time() function takes the user's input, which represents the time in hours it takes to drive to town and then back. We then multiply the input by 60 to turn that into minutes, and then divide that by 60 to change it to minutes per day. <n><n>```<n>import time<n>import math<n>input="Jason works on a poulty farm. He drives to town twice each  month to buy supplies.  If it takes him 3 hours to drive in town and back, how much hours does Jason spend driving in a year?"<n>output=202<n>time_in_town = time.strftime("%H:%M", time.localtime())<n>minutes_per_hour= 60<n>minutes_per = (math.ceil(time_in_town)*60)/60<n>output +=minutes_per<n>print(output)<n>```<n>```<n>D. Python takes in a list from the user and uses a.join method to concatenate the elements of that list into a string.  We use len to count the elements, range to cycle through, and slice to add a special character (in this case $).  Finally, we use str.format to insert that dollar sign.<n><n>```<n>import random<n>import math<n><n>def main():<n><n>    first_element=''.join(['$$',str(random.randrange(0,310))])<n>    print(first_element)<n>    print("Output

Choices: A: one, x=y  B: each, x=y<n>Output: A<n> <n> <n>#### Explanation : The car-rental question was tricky with its wording as it did not provide a way of solving as it would be done when dealing with normal algebra where x is assigned a real number e.g. x = 3. Since this is not a normal algebra question, we could use a trick of finding how many days she rented the car, and that would be (11 * 24)  which equals 264, and using how much each rental was, it would be (264/30) which equals 880, for more accurate decimal answers, we could of course provide fraction answers, however due to this being in standard form, we opted for rounding off decimals for easy understanding.<n>  <n>  <n><n>

You can pick any two numbers with consecutive numbers in between, such as 3 and 5 which is 2 + 4 (prime number 3 + prime number 5).  Same with 3 and 7 which is 2 +6, as well as 3 and 9 that is 2 +7, and finally 5 and 7 which is also 2 + 6.  Therefor 4 combinations can be made.  Then you can plug in 3 and 5. The first two options are 2 + 4 as well as 2 + 5.  The other two combinations could be 2 + 6 or 2 + 8.  Since this is an integer, two options can only be used twice, 2 + 4 and 2 + 6 can't both be used, so the combinations can only be that of 2 + 6, 2 + 7 and 2 + 8 or 3 + 7 and 3 + 8.  <n><n>Input: A rectangular prism has height h, width l, and length w.

For example, if the answer to the first question was "4", the next number would be the greatest number that can use the last digit of "4", which is "6". If the previous answer were "6", the next answer would be the greatest number using the last digit of "6" which is "8". If the answer were "8", the next answer would have to be the greatest number that uses the last digit of "8", which is "9", or if the question had already been answered with "9" then the correct answer would be "0".  So the answer would change from "9" to "0" as the previous answers changed to "6" → "8" → "9" → "0".  We can tell that the answer to this question would be "0" as the other choices are all one digit lower.<n>Output: 0<n><n>Input: 4443 x 26912 =<n>Output: 1179039868<n><n>---

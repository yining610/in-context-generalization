Before you can select the answer, you should carefully read the description of the problem and decide how to implement the solution to the problem.\n\nIn some problems, there may be more than one possible solution.  In that case, all solutions are correct.\n\nThe \u201cswitch\u201d statement is described on page 33-37. If this is the first time you have encountered a \u201cswitch\u201d statement in this book, make sure that you fully understand that problem and solution. To help you figure out how to solve the problems, you should use a programming language like C++ or Java.  \n\nYou can access your saved programs through the Saved Programs link on the main menu. Each of your program files is identified with a unique name.

The initialization and destruction functions serve to construct or destroy the object. You can think of the object's state as a mixture of a constructor function and destructor function. The object's state can be restored to its initial default through the destruction function called the destructor function.\n\n### Constructing an object\nTo create an object, encapsulate in an object and instantiate that object.\n```cpp\nclass ExampleObject {\npublic:\n\n    ExampleObject() {\n    }\n\n    ~ExampleObject() {\n    this->message = \"\";  //Destructor\n    }\n\nprivate:\n\n    //Variables\n    string message;\n\n};\n```\n\nYou call the object's constructor during initialization. A destructor call the object's destructor function (sometimes called dtor) automatically when an object is destroyed.\n```cpp\nObject1 o1; // Initialize o1\nObject1 o2;//Initialize o2\nObject1 o3;\nObject1 o4;\n//Now destroy these objects one at a time\nObject1 o1. ~Object1(); //Destroy o1\nObject1 O2. ~Object1();//Destroy o2\nObject1 O1. ~Object1(). //Destroy o3\nObject1 O4. ~Object1();\n \n```\n\n### Classes and Objects \nInside the class definition is a name of an object called a member object. The member object is known as a member object for the class definition.\n\nCreating Object\n```cpp\nclass Student {\n\n    private:\n        string studentName;\n        int _age;\n\n    public:\n        float getGrade() {\n            return grade;\n        }\n};\n```\nTo get a concrete object, you have to give that object a name or instantiated the object. You then assign the values to the object's property. The object property becomes a member of the object.\n```cpp \nint main() {", "answer": "D: take money"}

Choices:  When a grass sprout grows to a certain height, its root network gets so strong that it pulls the entire grass plant up out of the ground and lets it float on the wind.  There is a special group of seeds that live on the tops of grass blades. These grasses are able to be carried across the countryside by the wind until they land somewhere new.  The grass is so light that the wind can blow it anywhere, and soon it grows a root system that pulls it out the ground.  (A) Grasses are very light and the wind can easily blow them from place to place.  There is a seed that lives on the top of the grass and floats from place to place. The seed has a special property that allows it to float in the air. After a while, the grass develops strong roots and is able to grow anywhere it lands. The plant has a seed at the tip of the stem that grows to a certain length, stretches out and lets the plant float around. It makes it easier for the grass to move around.  It grows a seed on its top that floats around in the wind.  (B) Grass gets new places in a few different ways. Some seeds develop roots that wrap around the grass blades, pulling the plant up out of the earth. After a while, these grasses get strong enough to grow anywhere they happen to land. The plant puts a seed on the top of the stem. The seed grows to a certain height and then lets the grass plant stand up and float on the wind. (C) Grass gets from place to place the same way that any other plant does. Its seedlings have deep roots that allow the plant to pull itself out of the ground and start growing somewhere else. (D) Grass gets where it is going by sprouting tall, thin stalks.", "answer": "C: fly"}

{"idx": 210, "text": "A)\n\n### Solution:\nLet's start off with the first input question.\n* Input: The car-renta agency charges $320/week for a car that lasts an entire day $190 or more. Jennie rented the car for 9 days. What is the dollar amount she paid?\n* Output: 2,799\n\nThe reasoning behind solving the problem:\n\n* We first need to establish our variables.\n$x = A car that rents for $190/week or more\n$a = The amount of money rented\n\n* We determine the solution for the question given the variables and the formulas.\n\n$320 - $190 = $130\n9X = $130 (multiply 9 to the X to equal the $130\n$a = $130 - $19 = $111\n\n* We have our answer. The answer is $190 for a car in which renting a 9th of a rental will cost you $111.\n\nNext let's look at the second input.\n\nLet's begin with our variables\n\n$x = A truck that can carry 20cats.\n$a = Total time to transport the 400 cats 60 miles\n\nWe establish the solution:\n\n$60 $60 $x miles\n$x = 30\n\nWe have out answer. The answer is 3 hours.\n\nLet'S Continue with our instruction.\n\n* Input: Jason has a carriage home rents house.  He\u2019s charges $52/day or $520/2 weeks.  Eric wants to 20 days. How much will it cost for him?\n\n* Output: \n\n* \tWe must replenish our variables\n\n$a = The cost of renting the house \n$x = 20 days\n\n* $a = $520/x\n\n* $a: $160\n\n* The solution is 3 days\n\nNow it's time for the fourth input.\n\n* Input John enjoyed his time visiting museum, so he wanted to spend more time, so that he could gain more knowledge and knowledge", "answer": "B: gaining knowledge"}

{"idx": 537, "text": "B\n```\n\n## Explanation:\n1. How much? The initial rent is $30 and the price doubles every day of the rental. We know the first rule of compounding, a base plus interest is the interest. This works pretty well since Jennie\u2019s final bill is close to $350, $310 to be exact.\n\n2. How fast? It is 1 day plus a remainder. The hurricane is in exactly 1 day, the remainder is how much time it takes. The remainder is 6 days and we know that 6 is a multiple of 2 therefore the remainder will also be a multiple of 2. This means that we will have an additional 400/60 miles of driving in case of the hurricane.\n\n3. How much? Add each option and make sure the sum is equal to the desired number. So, we want to add 50 plus 50 plus 4 plus 3 plus 0. This yields 140.\n\n4. How much? How many months are not 20 in a year and are there 12? There are 26.

Make sure to use the correct format and to explain your answer to the programming prompt.\n\nInstruction: A pump operator wants to create an automated system that monitors a tank\u2019s supply level and activates the pump when the level starts to fall. If the level falls below a cutoff height, the level should be automatically raised before the motor is activated. When the tank level reaches its set height, the operator should also receive a phone call.\nWhat is the correct statement to write such a system?\n\n- First create a variable \u2018ths\u2019 and assign that to the tank height. Also, let \u2018tsh\u2019 be an empty variable (default).\n- Throw an if-else statement that checks current tank height against cutoff height \u2018tsh\u2019. If the value for \u2018tsh\u2019 is greater, then throw an else-if condition that creates a message saying that the tank is high and not to worry.

{"idx": 749, "text": "authentic\n\n###Instruction:Answer the following question:\n\n\"What are the five parts of a C++ program?\"\n\nC++ program are usually divided into 5 parts:\n\n1. Preprocessor (#)\n\n2. header files\n\n3. includes\n\n4. namespace\n\n 5. the main() function\n\n# Part 1 - Pre-processor Directives in C\n  \"What is a pre-processor directive?\"\n\n preprocessor is part of C programming language that you use to include code or data in your program in a way that will make it easier to compile and work on your code. preprocessor directives are used in C++ to include code or data into the source file(s) in a way that will be easier to compile for the developer.\n\n\n# Part 2 - Header Files in C\n  \"what is a header file?\"\n\n Header files are commonly written in the format.h to be able to access the contents of the file in C programs. Header files contain the necessary functions and procedures that a programmer needs to write C programs. When the header files are included in C programs, the procedures and functions are available for use in C source files.\n\n# Part 3 - Include Directives in C\ninclude commands are used to tell your C program which header file it should use during the compile time. This is typically used when a file requires multiple header files, such as C++ classes or macros. For example, #include <iostream> is used when writing a class or struct. Without including these header files the program will generate errors.\n\n# Part4 - Namespaces in C\n \"What is a namespace?\"\n\nIn C++, the namespace keyword tells us that a certain variable, function or class belongs to a certain namespace, and you can use it in your code. It is similar to writing \u201cusing namespace std\u201d, which allows you to use std library functions without typing their entire name every time you use them.\n\n# Part5 - The C++Main() Function\n \"What is the C++ main() function?\"\n\n The main() function is where your program begins and ends.\n\n# Reference:https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_hello_world.asp", "answer": "C: authentic"}

In the example above, eating in restaurants involved economic loss when restaurants were not present. To illustrate a public utility, we turn to water; the need to drink water can be treated as a utility.\u201d\n\n#### Question 2: The answer on the back of the card reads: \u201cIn a large city such as New Orleans, the water utility has to ensure that a large number of people have enough water every day to maintain health and sanitation. In order to do so, the city has to build an extensive water system that is distributed throughout the city. The system must be able to supply a constant flow of water no matter how many large bodies of water are being used at any given time in the city. In other words, it must be able to respond and adjust to the constant demand that city residents put on it while maintaining an adequate supply. Because water is a utility, the city must ensure that it meets the constant demands of its citizens on a daily basis, no matter how many people are using the utility.\u201d", "answer": "C: stomach ache"}

You do the first part of this equation, $f*d = 310$. You are then left with $14*s$ which is equal to $310$. This indicates the answer is $310$.\n\n#### Instruction:Answer the next multiple choice question\n\nInput: You go to a store and purchase an item for $4.99.

How much, to the nearest cent, do you owe in total for this purchase? There are no other applicable charges or discounts.\nOutput: 281\n\n#### Explanution:\n---\nIn this problem, you first determine two variables.  $a$ represents the cost without tax and $b$ represents the amount you must pay to the nearest dollar after tax. The question asks for $a+b=281$. This indicates you are left with a value for $a$. You then subtract the tax, $a-b=279.00$.

Each of the fifty (50) states elect a president. In addition, voters nationwide elect the President and the Vice President. The states choose a Senator for each of their states. All of the voting rights are included in the voting process. The Congress, with the exception of the presidency, is elected by the state. The candidate with the most popular votes wins the presidency. The person who gets the second highest rate. However, if no candidate wins over 50 percent of popular votes, the two top contenders then battle in an election of the votes. The popular vote gives one hundred votes (110) to the winning president. If no candidate gets over 150 votes, the presidential election is decided by the federal government in Washington, D.C. The vote that is counted for the first round of the election is the popular votes count. The popular vote for president in 1958 was 21,000 votes. However, the electoral vote for president in 2000 was 599,610 votes. The number of votes counted with the President\u2019s name does not count the popular vote. The 50 states and the District of Columbia also have their own elections. The elected officials in each state are the governors, state legislators, and judges of the state courts. The voters choose one member of Congress (which is the number of people in the Senate). The people who govern in the District of Columbia make decisions for the state. This election process determines the electoral vote for that state.", "answer": "E: medicine chest"}

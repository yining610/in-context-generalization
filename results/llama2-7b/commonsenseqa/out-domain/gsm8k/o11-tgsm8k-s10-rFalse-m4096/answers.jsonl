{"idx": 825, "text": "A\n(answer): A \n\n### Solution:\n\nGiven $0.50, the price for each kilogram.\n\nWe can calculate our answer in two different ways.\n\nFirstly, We can count the given digits. As there are 6 digits given, we would multiply these numbers by 6.\n\nSecondly, we can count every digit in the question (given), add every 3 digits and subtract this sum by 0.\n\nWe are looking for the modulo of our answer. As we can see, when the value is greater than 10, it will return 1.\n\nSo, according to the question, if our answer is 1, it means that the purchase cost is $56.\n\nThe second question is counting the hours in total. We simply need to add every number in the question and get the sum. Then we can get the answer from dividing the first answer with 30.\n\nThe third question is a subtraction question. As there are only 3 elements given, to get the total sum of the two elements, we need to subtract 1.\n\nThen we can count how many elements do we get from this operation and put the first answer in the place of the third element to answer the third question.\n\nThe fourth question says to multiply the elements and answer the question. The sum will contain 30 elements.\n\nEach element will be repeated for 30 times, so the answer for the fourth question will be $560 (=4 \u00d7 0.25 \u00d7 $3).\n\nSo, in total for the fourth question, we got $20.\n\nWe can do the same operation for the fifth question and apply the operation (modulo) on the first number and put it in the place of 4 to answer the fifth question.\n\nAccording to the sixth question, we are looking for the answer of $18 (= 3 \u00d7 0.10 \u00d7 $3).\nFinally, the last question seems to be a sum question.\n\nWe can get the answer by doing 5 operations and get the answer by applying the operation for each element. So, the last operation is $450 and according to the question, we will get our answer by 12.\n\nAs we did already, we will put our first answer in the place to answer for the sixth", "answer": "A: zoo"}

Each friend went to the gym for three hours the first year, four hours the second, six hours the third, and nine hours the forth. How many hours did each player spend on average playing basketball during the two years?\nSolution: The player playing the 3 hours in first year avg = 3, in year 2 avg is 4.\nIn third year the avg is 6, and in fourth year the avg is = 9\nNow in year 1, avg = 9/4\nand in year 2, avg = 12/4\nand in third avg =  4/9\nand in fourth avg = 1/3\n\nLet us substitute those values on a equation x + y = 11  \n  \nWe get : x + y = 4x + y  => x + x+ y - 4x = 4x + 4x -2 x + y-4x=-2x so y = -2x + -4x = -6x\nThis yields  y = -3x \nNow let us substitute those values on: (x+y)*2 = 5(x+y)  => 3x + 3y*2 -6x +12y  =>  x*2+ y*2 - 6x + 12y = 0 \nand we get :  x+ y = 0\nSo we only substitute x on x = 0 and y on y = -2x \nSubstitute now on both sides to get:  x = -2x, and solving it on the right side: x = 0, and on the left side:  x = 1, thus the equation is x = -2x + 1 \nNow we get: x = x, and can substitute it on (x = -2x +1). The equation now is: x+x = 3x, which means x=-2.\n\nSo we can also substitute the values in x=-2, and we get y=-3x = 2.  \nSolution: (x + y)=18\nx= 4, y = -14\n4+", "answer": "A: death"}

For me starting an app is something that I think about everyday and when I finally got to do it, I felt like a weight was lifted off my shoulders.\n*  I found Python to also be very interesting and I've never looked up at an error message in this way again. \n\nI enjoyed reading and learning while using Python.\n\n\n## Why are Python and React the best language choices?\n### What excites you about the way Python and React do things that Java and Angular do not?\n\nI used Javascript and React/Angular quite a lot in the last two years, and I know that there are some issues.\n\nOne of my first attempts to program resulted in a rather messy result, as I was not sure how to debug Python issues I ran into.

If you can do this for the 2nd part you can do this for any part.\n\n### Solution 2\n# There is a 1:1 correspondence between the time spent lifting weights to the time spent warming up and doing stretching. The time spent can be calculated using the time equation if we multiply the one hour by 3/4 then the answer will be time in minutes in the case I chose it is 180(3/4)(1) so the time in minutes = 180. To calculate the hours you can just divide 180 by 60 because an hour is 60 minutes. So the time in hours = 3\n\n### Solution for part 4, 5, 6\n# Part 4 : we can use the time equation T = n/2. So 2*T = 2*5*80 = 2*400 + 4*100 = 880 + 400 = 1280\n### Solution for Part 5 : 3000 = 200(15*9) = 75 * 250 * 200. So the number of cups + the number of pints is 20(75+50+50) =300\n### Solution Part 6 : 2001=7(270+270+225) The number of boxs it takes = 300*(7+1+4) =2140\n### Part 7 : 770 = 150 * 5 = 150(5*4)\n\n### Part 8\n# To calculate how many miles walked in 4", "answer": "C: health"}

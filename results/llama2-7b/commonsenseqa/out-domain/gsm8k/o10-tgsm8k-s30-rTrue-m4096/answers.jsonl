He is a fair boss and does not discriminate between his employees on gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, or level of education. He chooses any two employees that he wishes to fire and then fires the two employees that he chooses.\nOutput: He fires every other employee. He has 10 employees, and for every round, he fires 2 employees. There are 10 total employees so if he chooses every other employee, he should fire one of the 5, 6, or 7 employees in any round. This creates a cycle since each time he fires 2 employees, there are (4-1)/2 = 2 fewer employees for the next round. This means that after six rounds, there are two employees who have never been fired. If he chooses employees at random and fires 2 each round, there is a 2/10 chance that he will fire the same employee twice, which means he will not only be discriminatory, but that there is always a 1/4 chance that the employee he fired this round was already fired in the previous two rounds.\nSo the final conclusion is that if he fires every other employee, he does not discriminate.\nif firing at random, there is always a 2/14 chance that he was discriminatory in this round.\n\n\nInput: If a 6-year-old weighs 61 lbs, how much will he weigh after 2 1/2 years?\nOutput: The 6-year-olds' weight will increase by 1 pound for every 300 days until he reached 61 lbs.

After two hours, they are a mile apart. How far does the boat travel in 30 minutes?\nOutput: At 2:00 1/2 x 0.5 x 2 = 1 mile\nAfter another 30 minutes, that would be 2:30 or 75 minutes altogether.\nSince he is still going at 2mph at that point, and the boat is only going at 2miles/hour, he is going a faster and the boat is going slower.\nSo he finishes one hour before the boat arrives.\nAt that time, he would be 30 miles from where he started.\nHe was going 20 mph/hour, and now is going 25 mph/hour.\nThe trip was only 30 minutes, and not an hour.\nWe divide 30 minutes into 30 mph, and we get 1/30, which is 1/6, or 0.17.\n1/30 x 30 miles = <<1/30 x30=0.17>>0.17\nSo the final answer 0.17 miles\n\nInput: Tess takes 3 hours and 10 minutes to complete one segment of a math assignment.

What total $ does a pizza with this size and price total?\nOutput: The pizza's size and price are known: they are 10 inches and $35 respectively.\nSince the pizza's area is known, we can determine its circumference.  Given the area of a circle is $r^2$, where $r$ is the radius, and the radius of a circle with a 10-inch diameter is $5/2$ inches, we get:\n$$62.5^2 = (5/2)^2\\cdot 35$$\n$$62.75^2 = 25$$\n$$10062.75 = 25$$  \n$$10020 = 0$$  \nIf we simplify $40/2$, we get $20$.  Thus, the $40$-dollar pizza sold at 20 cents a cent is $2$.  \nSince there are two $1's$ added to $35$, the total is $37$.\nSo the final answer with the correct rounding of $0.2$ and $0.$ respectively is 37\n\nInput: If a car travels $14$ miles in $1$ hour, how many miles does it travel in $5$ minutes exactly?\nOutput: $$14\\cdot 5 = 70$$\nTherefore, if it travels\n\nInput:A pizza shop in San Francisco will make a 13-inch pizza for 60$.What is the price of a single slice of this pizza?\nOutput: To get a single slice (the unit)\n$$ 60 / (13 inches)^2)$$\nThe square of $13$ is $169$.\nThe price of a single slice is\n$$81 / 169$$\nIf", "answer": "E: getting tired"}

{"idx": 67, "text": "A: Put together\nSo the answer is A\n\nInput:It was Christmas, and Nicole was in a bind.  In order to fill a special request for her boyfriend, she was planning to buy a dozen donuts from the local bakery.  Unfortunately, the donuts cost $2 each and she doesn't have enough money.  She can sell some of her books to try and make an extra $2, but she's not totally sure how many books she has because she can't remember which ones she still owns.\nOutput:Since the answer depends on not only Nicole\u2019s book selection, but her own ability to remember each book\u2019s value, we\u2019ll focus on her ability to accurately remember the book\u2019s worth.\nLet\u2019s use an equation to solve for x: (((1.5*75)\u2013x)*4)=2 where x is the number of books she needs to sell and y is the value of the books she\u2019s selling.\nUsing the equation, subtract the number of books she remembers having from the number of books she has.  Then multiply the difference (x\u2013y) by 4. If the resulting number is 2, then Nicole has the two books she needs to sell.\nSo if she can figure out how many books she has and then subtract those books from x (the number of books she needs), then divide the difference(the remaining amount) by 4, this will give her the books she needs to sell to get the 2 from (2*(x-y) = (1.5*70) -4 ). So if she knows how many she has left in x(the number of books she has to sell), which is 2 less y(the number of books needed), which is 22, she will be able to calculate which books to get to make the 2. So she will need to subtract the number of books left from the number of books needed and multiply by 4. She will need 2 less 22 and then multiply it by 4. She has 20 books left and her books cost 25 dollars each, so she will multiply it by 25 and then add 2 to get 480 as the amount she needs to sell. So she will need 480 / 4 = <<480/4=120>>\nSo if", "answer": "D: heal"}

Choices: A: 24 miles B: 48 miles C: 64 miles D: 96 miles E: 144 miles\nOutput: Walking 18 miles means you cover 18 miles while using energy that is needed to walk.  Running in a marathon at twice the speed of a 500 meter race means you cover 2(2 times the speed) = 4 times the distance in a marathon where as running in a 50 meter race at half the speed of a 200 meter race means we cover 2(1/2 the) = half the distance. Thus walking 18 miles = running a marathon half the speed as in a 50 mile race, so we can walk 18/2 = 9 miles. Running a marathon at the the speed meant in the 500 meter event then we can run a marathon while burning 4 times the amount of energy required to simply cross a finish line in a 50 miler 4 times in a marathon is 16 Miles.

In the first trip, you intend to purchase 8 pounds of carrots and 2 pounds of zucchini. In the second trip, you intend to buy 6 pounds of carrots, 5 pounds of zucchani, and 8 chickens. In the third trip, you plan to buy 7 pounds of carrots (including some you bought in the previous two trips) and 6 pounds of zucchinnil. If you intend to buy $27 worth of carrots, how much should you spend on zucchini?\nOutput: In the first trip, the carrots and zucchini were the first and second amount of 8/1 + 2/1 = <<8/1+2/1=2>>2 pounds of carrots. The second amount of 6/1 + 5/1 = <<6/1+5/1=4>>4 pounds of the carrots.\nIn the second trip, the carrotes and zucchinni were the first amount of 6/2 + 5/2 = <<6/2+5/2=3>>3 pounds of carrots plus the second amount of 8 - 7 = <<8-7=1>>1 pound of carrots.\nThe third trip had two punds of carrots (some from previous trips), and 4 pounds of the zucchini.\n\nThe problem statement indicated that the buying price included carrots, and the buying price specified the total price of carrots including those purchased in the first 3 trips, so the buying price to be spent on the entire amount of carrots was $27 which indicated that the total amount of carrots purchased was 16 pounds.\nTo solve this, we could find the amount of carrots for each trip as described above, and add up the number of pounds of the total carrots obtained for each trip, and this would give us the total number of carrots acquired.\n\nTo find how much was spent on each vegetable, we would find the total cost", "answer": "A: gain weight"}

{"idx": 195, "text": "The first thing that jumps to my mind from this question is that people often share genes and in turn genes (DNA)\nYou should not only take your answer choices into account as you reason through this problem, but your knowledge of biology and genetics. You must ask yourself, what are my knowns? We know that people share DNA to a degree with other people in their family. We know that babies share a significant degree of genes between themselves and their parents.  We know that the people in this question chose the words \u201cin the same family\u201d to ensure that the answer would be DNA and that the question was not about sharing genes with a person outside your family but rather with other people in your family. For example siblings share certain genes but not all genes.  So we are going to rule out the options that involve not only DNA, but also genes in general.\nIf the word \u201cbrain\u201d did not exist in option E, then people would share DNA, but they would not share the same eye color.  That eliminates option C.  Also if eye color was the same, than people would also share a \u201cbrain\u201d, but this is not the case.  So that eliminates option D. Option B is also removed because the answer does not make reference to sharing hair color between people. The genes that cause you to inherit your eye and hair color would be the ones causing you to inherit certain features, so that leaves us with A being the solution.\nSometimes, a question stumps you because it makes you think too hard about every possible combination of the choices provided when in reality you don\u2019t have to consider these options.

The distance to the city is 500 miles, and it will take three hours to fly the 500 miles. Find the amount of time needed to fly when the speed of the plane makes an angle of 15 degrees with the course to the city.\nOutput:If the plane flies 15 degrees to the left of a direct course, it will require 1.71 * 3 x cos15=<<1.71*3*cos15=51.4>>51.4 hours to fly 500 miles because cos15=<<cos15=0.866>>cos15 miles per hour.\nTherefore 500 * 0.866 = <<500*0.866=433>>433 miles will be covered for every hour of flight.\nThere are 3.33(rounded) hours in one hour and 15 degrees is 1.083(rounded) degrees. So the angle of 15 makes the plane go 15 degrees left of a straight line to the city.\nThus 433 / (1.083 * 15) =<<433/(1.083*15)=290>>290,000 miles per hour.\nOr, more simply, 500 miles/3 hour = 166.66(round to 166) miles per hour.\nWhen the", "answer": "A: wedding"}

If a total of 63 days is left over from using each month for the number of years before 2000 and 2000 is the year of the twentieth century, how many years are\nOutput: August is a whole number of months so the numerator of the total days is 15=<<15=1>>1\nAugust has 31 days, July has 31=<<31=1>>1 so the numerator of August days is same as July days.\nAugust can be divided into 2 halves, 1 and 3.\nSo the total number of days in 20 years is the sum of the August days, the July days, and the August halves, July halves, and August halves.\nAs there aren't enough days to sum all of the August days, we take the August halves and add them to the remaining August and the July halves and remaining July.\nSince there are still not enough days to sum all these quantities, we add August twice.\nThen we", "answer": "E: hand written"}

{"idx": 227, "text": "The balalaika was used as a music instrument from the late 13th century.\nDue the the size of this question and the way it is posed, it requires a bit context.  An orchestra is a group of musicians who each play a different instrument.  Thus, the orchestra plays music together.  At the time the balalaika existed, an orchestra could not exist as we know it because the way they played their instruments meant that many of the instruments in an orchestra could not be made.  The balalaika was first an individual folk instrument not meant to play music with other people.  In short, the question is incorrect.

He will do this by weighing a group of watermelons and then dividing by this quantity of watermelons to get the melon's average weight, $1.20.\nOutput: First, to figure out the quantity of watermelon to test, lets say x is the weight of the watermelon and x20 is the quantity bought.\nx20 > x => x+x20 > x20 =>(x+x20 - x20)/((x+x20)-x20) = x/((x+x2) - x20) - 1\nSecond set of step, he will weigh the group and get weight for them(x1,x2,x3....,xn) in the equation above.\nThe answer will be the price of the watermelons that have the average weight of 1.20:\n0.24(13.75+23.75+10)>0.18+ 1.8\n=>13.75 > 1.8 => 13.75-1.8 = 10.76/5\n13.75/13 = 1.0575, 10.75/10.7", "answer": "B: pass time"}

{"idx": 241, "text": "The choices are all nouns, so pet is the subject.  Nails require grooming.  A noun needs a predicate.  All of the verbs in the choices are adjectives (except \"late\" which is an adverb); none of the given nouns can take an adjective (\"injure\", \"satisfy\", \"beautify\", \"groom\", \"train\").  So the sentence has only one verb, \"require\", which is a transitive verb, since it requires a direct object.  \"Grooming pet's nails is not what causes beauty.\"  Thus, \"groom's grooming\" is an object phrase modifying \"injury\". \"Nails require grooming\" could be rewritten as \"Nails that are groomed require grooming\".  The adjectival phrases need a noun to modify. (\"Late\", adverbial, cannot modify nouns like \"nails\".)  The object phrases need a nour to modify.

If the tree shades a 50 by 50 foot garden, how many shade trees are needed to cover the entire area?\nOutput:In the summer, each cubic foot of shade casted covers 50 feet of a 50 by50 foot garden.\nSo each cubic foot of the tree covers 50 feet in the summer 50/(50*225)=<<50/(50/225)=0.022>>0.022 feet\nAnd in the winter, each cubic foot can cover 50 feet of the area.\nSo each cubi foot covers 155/50 = <<155/5=3.1>>3.1\nBut these are two different ratios so 3.1*0.22 = <<3.1*0*.22=0.6>>0.6 covers one area in the summer, and 50/3.1 in the winter.\nSo to cover the entire garden in summer you have to cover 50/0.22=<<50/0.022=23>>2 shade plants in addition to the garden already covered with leaves in summertime.\nThis means 19 leaves/plant are needed in the summer and 14 leaves/plant in the winter in order to cover the entire garden.\nSo the final answers are 19 and 14\n\nInput:If there are 193.2 hours in a 30-day month, then how many hours are there in a 25-day month?\nOutput:There are 193 hours in a 31-day month and 192 hours in a 28-day month.\nThere are 5 days without a full day between them or 1/5 of those days, so there are 28*1/5=<<28*1/25=108>>108.2 days of each month where you do not have to", "answer": "E: family room"}

Similarly, the height of the cube is 20 cm.  The volume of the water should equal its volume (in cubic centimeters), which is 65,536 cm^3.  Thus, 2x*20*60 = <<65536=32768>>32768 should be used on the left side since the volume is in cubic meters.\nThe volume in cubic meters of the cube can be divided by the height of the cube (20), and the remainder is 155 (which is the length of the cube). Then, that amount is divided by each unit of length (which in this case is 6cm). The remainder amount 155/6=<<155/6=>25>>25.\nSo if x (or the cube\u2019s length) is 65536/32768, which equals 20, then the answer is 20.\nSo the answer is 2\n\nInput: A computer programmer wants to know how much money he will need to spend each day while traveling for an 11-day trip to 4 different countries.

How many people received a flu shot?\nOutput:  5 people have died. 6 people have died+not dead= dead people. I believe that they meant dead people. So you could start with that assumption. \nDead people: 6 people \n40 people are in ER so they can be treated for something different then what they have now.

So you now have 6+0=6 dead people (not 7 dead people). \nTired people:  600 people are on verge of passing out so they all have headaches, if 1000 people all have headaches then 400 people have headaches.  You dont need to add headaches and tiredness together since headaches cause 600 people to be tired. Headache: 400 people so the headache people would be added to already counted people for the other symptom so 30 people died from being 400 people.\n100 people are in hospital so 30 people were in hospital 40 people are 100%.

We need 100 people, not 50 and so we can multiply by 50 since 20*(4)! = 16\nThus we get 200 = 16 x 50 and so there are 200 tenants.\n\nInput:Choose the correct word from the list to complete these sentences.

Aunt Cathy divided the slices equally so her sons each received 2/3 and her daughters all got 1/3.\nHow many pieces of pie were in the 6'9'9'9 pyramid?\nOutput: The initial pyramid is 6+9=<<6+9=15>>15 pies.\nEvery pyramid level has 3 pies, so the 6 +8 = <<6+8=14>>14 pyramid level, has 3 pies = A+B+C\nThe last level has 1 pie. This last pie is divided among each child. For example, the last level was 3/5 of a pie.\nSince Aunt Cathy wanted each of her children to have 1/3 of the pie and gave them 6/5 pies, a total of 18 pies, the last level must have had 18/1/3 = 18/<<18/1/9>>9 pies.\nThe question then becomes the number of pies in the entire pyramid.\nFirst, 1/3 of all the pies were given to the children.

Lauderdale and Miami Beach within 24 hours. At what wind speed does gusty winds occur?\nOutput: A hurricane: a hurricane is a system of winds, rain, and low pressure (relative to the air around it, air pressure at sea level). It rotates about the low pressure, moving in a circle. The winds flowing in the circle travel at the same speed around the storm. The hurricane wind speed is directly related to the low pressure. The slower the low pressure, the slower the wind speed of the storm.\nGusty Winds: a gust is a strong and brief blast of wind. Gusts are more than the average wind speed and can blow up to about 30% faster than the average speed of the wind.\nAn analogy would be that if you take a fan and blow wind over a table, the wind will have a certain speed at any given moment over the table. But, if you push the fan, the wind speed increases and some of the wind is \"gushy\"\nSo, the wind speed of the hurricane will vary from the average wind speed, and in fact, on occasion, gusts can blow quite strongly in one spot, while in another place the hurricane is moving at a slow pace.\nA gust is a strong blast of wind that can be as high as 30% above the average wind speed at that moment in a certain location.\n\nIn conclusion, gusts occur in areas where the wind speed is above 120mph. At these wind speeds, there will be lots of gusts since the wind speed at any moment exceeds that of average wind speeds.\nSo, if 120mh is the threshold speed, then the answer is \"yes\".\nSo the final answer B\n\nInput: Diane is", "answer": "B: whorehouse"}

Choices:  R: Positive integer\n2: Nontrivial 3: Factor 4: E\n5: Not prime\nOutput: R: It is a nonzero positive integer (i.e., a natural number: 0 excluded) and there exist some natural number, m, known as the factor of number such that the natural number m \u00d7 n = number (n is called a factor of number.) We call a number which can be written as m \u00d7 n a factorial of number (n is called the factorial of number where m is the factor of number.) In other word we can say that the number that is greater than the sum of all prime numbers is an odd number greater than 5.\n\nThis is also an odd natural number in which every prime number except 3 divides evenly and is even. For example, 6 (or 15) is the factorial of 6. The number, 6, is called the factor of number, 6, in which there exist some natural number, = 6, known as factor of number.\nIf all the factors have been extracted, the number is called a prime number or it is considered as prime (i.e., p is prime or p is a prime number. The number of prime factors in a prime number will be 1; e.g., 9 is a prime number in which its only factor is 1.)\nThe number of prime factors in non prime number is infinite. For example, if p has 2 factors, its prime factor is 2. If p has 3 factors, its prime factor will be 3. If p has 4 factors, its prime factor of p is 2 or 4.\nSo the final part of the solution:", "answer": "C: die"}

How many marbles did you pull from each bag?\nOutput: Since there are 8 bags and because each hand has 2 white and 2 red marbles, there must be 16 bags with marbles.  A total of 8 hands means that each hand must pull 2 marbles from each bag, making 76 marbles total in the hands.  Since each of the 8 hande has 2 white and at least 2 marbles means that there is at least one bag that has only white marbles, and there is at least one with only red marbles.\nSince the number of white marbles is known, we only need to figure out the number of red marbles for each bag\n\n16 bags with 2 + 2 + red marbles = <<16*2+2+redmarbles=28>>28 red marbles since at least one bag has at least 2 bags containing only red marbles\n8 hands with 25 marbles = <<8*25=200>>200 marbles since at least 1 bag contains only white marbles with 2 marbles\nSolving for x = <<x=16-x-6>>16-x+6 so red marbles of 15 bags in the final answer\nSo the final answer that is 15 bags with 25 red marbles.\n\nInput: A ship is 200 meters long.

This implies that y = 0.\nBecause it has to be above (n + 1). Since (n + 1), we have 0 > (n + 9), and we need to prove that the divisibility can hold for 0 here.\nAnd, what we'll do will be prove that for 0, we have $0 \\div 0, to prove $0 \\div 9, then to prove $(n +", "answer": "D: room"}

A motorist is traveling on the highway at 45 miles per hour.  How long does it take this motorist to reach his destination?\nOutput: The input information says that the car traveling on this highway is traveling at 55 miles per every hour, meaning 55/(55/60) = <<55/(55/(55*60))=8>>8 hours\nThe speed limit is 55 and the car travels the highway in 55/60 = <<55/60=3.875>>3.875 hours.\nSo to get this motorist's time he must add his time to this car's time, 45/(55/45 - 3.875) = <<45/(55*45/)-(3.875))=42.8125>>42.813/32\nThen for simplification, 42.81/32 = <<42.81/(55*/32)>>42.8/55/32 becomes 0.71/55/3 = 0.372214285714\nSo he travels with a simple answer of 37.2/55 = <<37.2/35.7=35/35.7>>35/35\nSo the final answer becomes 35/35=<<35/35==1>>1 hour\n\nInput: A small office has 12 printers.

When the plane finally does leave, it flies for two hours. Assuming the weather in another country is good, the plane lands in the country safely and stays there for a total of 4 hours. How many hours did it actually take for the plane to travel from the first country to the second country?\nOutput: When the plane leaves for the other country, we are given that there is a total of 2 hours flown and 4 hours spent in the other country, leaving a 2 hour gap between leaving the first country and arriving in the second country.\nFrom the 2 hour gap, the first hour is spent doing take-off; the second hour is spent on take-off and landing, which is why it took 2 hours.\nThough we don't exactly know, it probably took an hour total to get to the other country, so to find the answer, we need to subtract one from the other:\n(1) + (2) = (2 ) - (1) = <<2+2=4>>4 - <<1+1=2>>2\nSo the final hours was about 3 hours, or more accurately, 3/2, which would be about 1.5\n\n\nInput: The airline was charging $250 for a one-way ticket.

If a student has 2 credits in science after taking all 800 periods in school, how many periods did the student take in English?\nOutput: English = 5 credits and since 1 credit in English = 1 period, all 800 of the periods equal English.\nSo the final conclusion is that the student took 500 periods in English.\n\nInput: An automobile shop can repair a transmission in either an hour or two.  If the shop has time at a cost of 1/2 of the cost to repair a transmission, how many transmissions does the shop need to repair in a year to break even on the repair shop?\nOutput: The repair shop has time at a 1/2 cost of the transmission repair.\nThe equation that represents this is $>>1=0.5*$1000>500>>550, which represents the amount the shop has saved by having a time reduction of 50%.\nA single repair of a transmission is $1000.\nSo the equation represents the value that if this is multiplied by the amount of transmissions that a shop has fixed, the shop will break even.\nGiven that this represents that the 550 time multiplied by one repair value of 1000 is a total of $550,000 and we need break even on that.\nThus, we divide $550,550 by 550 to reduce time to 1 and it equals $1000 which states that if a shop repairs 1,000 transmissions, they will be making a profit of 500$ and break even with the cost of 1/4 of 1,00 which equals $250.\nAnd so that is the answer.\n\nInput", "answer": "C: butterflies"}

One tires needs to be swapped out on each truck, but there are not enough new shipping containers to do that.  How many shipping containers does the company have if there are not enough new containers to swap out the tires?\nOutput: The number of shipping containers = 3(3) = 9\n\n### Explanation:  At first the answer seems obvious because there are 3 tires so the 6 shipping containers must have 2 shipping containers available for each tire.  However, note that \"not enough containers to swap tires\" means there are not enough *new* Containers.  So the 6 old Containers cannot be used for the 3 trucks.  So there are 3 shipping containers to swap tires for 3 trucks but there are only 2 new Containers so the answer is the total of both of these, 9 containers.\n\ninput:  There are two separate lanes on the highway with cars on them.

Choices: A: bus B: airport C: ferry D: train E: bus A again.\nOutput:The answer is D. If you need to get to the airport from the bus station, you could take the bus, but that would take longer since the bus could still drop you off at the airport without actually taking you directly to the airport. So you need to take a different route. The ferry would be a bad choice because the bus station will not be close to the ferry terminal. You also cannot get to any of the other train routes since they would require you to get a train outside of the bus station to the train station, then board a different train to go to the airport. After all of that, it would not be the most efficient route and there would be so many different stops you could take between trains. So the only other choice that makes sense is to take a bus.\nSince you mentioned that you need to take a bus to get to the airplane again, you will probably need to stop at the bus station again", "answer": "C: maps"}

The capacity of a typical car is 17 gallons or two-thirds more than half a gallon. How much does a typical tank of gas in such a car cost?\nOutput:  First find the price of a gallon.  The cost of a gall of gas these days is $4.10.\nNow find the capacity of the tank in gallons.  The capacity of the tank = 17 gallons.\nAnd finally we found the cost of a typical tank of gas.  The cost of the tank of gas = $4.10 * 17 = $<<4.10*17=69>>69. 69 comes to $0.41 per gallon. That means that the cost of a gallon in this car is $0.41.\nSo the final result is approximately $0.41/17 gallons=$<<0.41/32=0.13>>0.13 per gallon,\nor for simpler calculations, 13 cents per gallon.\n\nInput: There are 61 students enrolled in a class.

If they price the peaches at $1.50, we estimate that 98%of their sales will be of those peaches.   If they cut the price of the peaches in half, what percentage of their sales will now be of those peaches\nOutput: We assume that the number of customers is constant, since we are altering just the price of the peach and the number of peaches that we buy per customer stays constant.   When we raise the price per peach, the cost for each peach increases and we are buying these peaches less per purchase (98% of 2 = 196 and 200 is the new total) When we cut the price in half, the cost per individual peach goes down and we buy 3 peaches per transaction (196 is for 1 peach, and 2-196 is 1, so we get 3 peaches for that 1 peach).\nSince I was trying to increase the sale of the peach, I decided to give a breakdown of the % of sales by each scenario since the price of the peacht was cut in half.  1/2 - 198 ----------------33% of new sales would be from the 1/2 price\n      1/2  -  98 -----------11% of new sales would from the $1.50\n      1/2 -   2 ---------50% of the new sales would come from the $0.75 price point\n\nSo the final answer would be 33% from 1/2 - 98% - 11% = 50% - 50% + 50% = 33%", "answer": "D: office supply store"}

All the tesserae are numbered.  A tesserae is a small mosaic piece of mosaic art.  The archaeologists found that the tesserae could be laid out in two ways:  either alternately colored (i.e. alternating between one colored mosaic tesserae and a white tesserae), or in white only.  The mosaic was made up of 6 tesserae in series.  Two tesserae at the beginning and end of the series had colors, while the four in between were all white tesserae.  If two more tesserae were added to each end of the series, forming four rows, and they alternated colors, does the series still match the tesserae? Assume that the colors alternate, for example, between dark and light, then move to yellow and red, then finally to purple and green.\nOutput: Given the above, the series will not match the tessera if tessera 4 in the first row is white and tessera 1 in the second row is not white, if tessera 12 in the first row is not white and tessera8 in the second row is white, or if the row order is incorrect.\nSo the answer choice that matches with the above:\nTessera 4 - Match\nTessera 8 and 12 - Not Match\nTessera in order - Match\nSo the final answer D:  Not Match\n\nInput:There are 100 marbles in a box.

A: Drink water. B: Swallow fish. C: Breath in air. D: Have their mouth open. E: Drink salt water.\nOutput: Milk is made in mammals by the mammary gland. The mammary gland is composed of specialized milk-producing cells called the alveoli. As the hormone prolactin is released into your bloodstream, the alveoli begin to swell. Nutrients and water in your blood get drawn out of the blood and enter the alveoli, which is where milk is made. The alveoli make milk when they are full of fluid, which is why milk is usually produced in large quantities after breastfeeding and right before a period.\nTo make milk, whales would have to consume foods that release the hormone proliferins so they will begin to gain weight.  Whales can use the saltwater in the ocean to release the hormone.  A better answer is that whales can drink the saltwater from the ocean\nSo the final is <Answer>", "answer": "A: eat grass"}

An hour and three minutes later a plane leaves San Francisco for San Diego. When the plane leaves, 7 hours and 3 minutes have elapsed. Which city will the plane arrive in first?\nOutput: The plane will have left San Francisco before the train arrives there so that both cities must be on the same side of the plane when it arrives.\nIf the plane leaves San Francisco at 4:00 am, it will arrive in San Diego at 7:03 in time.\nSince a train from San Diego leaves at 9:32 am to reach San Francisco in 7 hours and 03 minutes, the plane should arrive around 1:30 am.\nTo ensure that this holds, we use the difference of arrival times to determine if the plane still arrives in San Diego before the train reaches there.\nThe difference between 1:30 and 7 is 7 and the difference between 4 and 9:32 is -9:32, thus the plane arrives before the train reaches the destination of San Francisco by the difference of -9:32 - 7 = -16:32.\nSince the plane arrives before this time, both cities appear on the same side of 36 hours and 32 minutes.\nTherefore, the plane arrives first while the train arrives last.\nSo the final result is that the plane arrives first.", "answer": "C: get tired"}

Then x^2-x=x\nTherefore, our equation is:\n1 = 244 x /(x^2 -x)\nSince (x^2 -x)= 25, this equation can be reduced to the equation:\n1=244 x /25\nThis can be further reduced to the much simpler equation:\n1=10 x /5\nThis equation can be further reduced still, giving us the final answer of x = <<5>>5.\n(Final output of python code)\n\nInput: A father decides to save money for his child.  He deposits $85 each week into an account with 5% annual interest compounded weekly.  He wants to save enough money for his child until they turn 18 years old. If his child is 7 years old, what is the age in weeks that his child will turn 18?\nOutput: Let y represent the age and x represent the time (weeks) since his child is 7:x = 5 * ( 7 - 1 ) * ( 1 + 0.05 ) = <<5*(7-1)*0.05=6>>6\nx is converted to a fraction, which contains the variable y. Then x is divided by 5. Now, y is subtracted from 18, giving the result of <<18-y>>18-y\nThe answer is y = 18 - <<18-y>==18-<<18-y>>.\nHowever, the final answer should only be a numerical output.\nThis is an incorrect question", "answer": "E: air out"}

A car leaves the parlor, turns right, and travels west, away from you at 25 miles per hour. You are traveling 35 miles per hour. If, after 8 miles, you are 2 miles to the south of the ice cream parlor, how far south of the ice creal parlor will you be once the 16 miles is up?\nOutput:A car leaves the parlor and travels 25 miles per hours, from the parlor it travels 16 miles to the north which means after it travels 15 miles on the road it is 1 mile north of the parlor, that means 1 mile north of south of the parlor\nAt 35 miles per hours the car travel 285-1/3 = <<285-1.3=270>>270 miles north\nAnd at this rate the car will travel 270 miles so that means after the first 16 miles the car travels 9x270 = <<9x270=2430>>2430 miles which is north of the parlor.\nNow that the car has travel to the north for 2430 miles the car turns right and travel 25 miles to the west again traveling at 25 miles which means after 25 miles it will be 25 miles north of the parlor and 25 miles west and since every 25 miles there is 75 miles north\nand 75 miles at 25 miles is 1/4 = <<1/4=2.5>>2.5 of every 25 mile travel\nNow 1/4 of 2430 is 607.5 which means it is about 8th of the way. And 1/4 is 2.5 so it is about 46.89 miles. Once the car is 46.8 miles north it is about as north as it can be and to get further north it would have to travel west for every 25 miles.\nSo the final answers will be -35 north\n\nInput: What is the first two digit number", "answer": "D: mouth"}

If there is a 15% tip, how much does it cost, in grams, to fill the order?\nOutput: The meal is $8 and the tax is $0.72 = <<8.7+0.72=8.7>>8.7.\nThe order costs $10(tax and tip).\nMultiply 10x10= <<10*10=100>>100.\nReduce 100/10=<<100/1o=10>>10 so 10 becomes 2.\nHalf of the tip is 7.2x2=<<7.2*2=14.4>>14.4.\nIf the tax is 7.2, the food itself is 8.7 x 2 = <<8.976=17.552>>17.55 and the grams will be 100+14.4+17.55-1= <<100+17.5+10-0.5=99>>99.\nSo the final answeer is 99\n\nInput: On a vacation in Jamaica, Cathy takes 20 pictures", "answer": "C: being found out"}

In order to pass you, one person must brake longer and at a slower rate than the other person.  You travel _ at _______ per second and the other travels _______ at _______ per _______.  What is the smallest distance for each car to travel between them when they pass each other?\nOutput: 5 (you), 2 (other person), 2, 1, 0, 1.\nThe distance (1 unit) each car covers per second (s), between when they pass, is given by the formula: 1/(Distance per s-(braking time per s)).\nWe know the two speeds: we want to get away from the slower one and we keep a fixed distance, so the two vehicles will not run into each other:\n\nCar A, traveling at V_A (2, in our case) at 1 unit/s will slow down at 0.1 unit/s and reach 0 s/u (stopped).\nCar B, traveling at V, will brake at 0 s/u and will slow down at 2.12 s/u (and, if V_B (1, in our case) is the same as in V_A then braking time is 14 s/u instead of 1).\nSo, at 9 s/u after braking, Car B (traveling at 2 u/s) will pass Car A at 0 s/p (stopped).\nFinally, two vehicles will pass each other at 10 s/up.\n\nDistance (p) between Car A and Car B while they pass each other is p = (9-1)\n\nSo, distance (0.9) between Car A and B when they pass each other is the minimum required distance.\nSo the final part of the question can be interpreted as: Two vehicles travel at 2 u/p in the same direction with p=1/3 unit between each other. When passing each other, the cars' maximum braking time is 2 seconds (12 u/s). Then, what is the minimum time at which cars will pass each other? Answer: 2/3 second.", "answer": "D: take money"}

So the square of 6 is 6*6=<<6*6=36>>36. Since 36 is a even number, then 6^4 must be an even number. Lets see if 6^4 is divisible by 2. Lets break it up into 6*36/4 = 9*36/4. We know that 36 is divisible by 4. So by division by 9, 36/9 ends up being a multiple of 9, which means 36 is a multiple of 9. 36/9 = 6/2 and 6/2 = 3. So 36 is a factor of 6^4.

She lives in a state of the US that allows abortions until the 9th month of pregnancy.  The woman decides to have an abortion, but her doctor says it will cost her approximately $10,000.  She doesn't have that amount and will incur penalties for attempting to obtain money to pay for the procedure.\nHow much, at most, can the woman afford to pay?\n Output: If the state allows abortions until the ninth month then she is allowed to have abortions until then.  To be less expensive, they can be done in earlier months.  If the doctor is willing to work for $10,0\n the state allows later abortions, then she may have a later abortion.  Then she will be charged a penalty for the money she may have to pay for the later abortion.  Since the woman lives in a state which has a later abortion policy that may cost more than the $10, 000,\n the maximum the woman can afford to pay for an abortion will be $10,0 000.", "answer": "D: get arrested"}

Therefore 17/2=<<17/2=8>>8 is the first digit and $8$./2 for the second digit,\nand $8$./2+1/2=<<8$./2+2/2=11>>11 is the first digit, and 11/2 for the second.\n\n17/2=11/1=<<17/1=<<11/1=11>>1.  In the row below the second row, there are 3-even numbers and one odd number,\nand 3-even and 1-odd are both odd, so the choice is the third even number in the second row which is 6.  6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 is the first digit and 3/2+1/1=<<3/2+1=11>> 11 is the second digit.  In the third row, 3-even numbers are found for the fourth and fifth even numbers, so 3+4=<<3+4=7>>7 is the digit for the fourth.

To add, the question doesn\u2019t clearly mention whether they'll be having an 80% discount off sale and a 33% discount off sale both at the same time or the 80% off could be after then. If they have both at the same time, then it is possible to have a 25% discounted sale.\n\nOutput: If they have 80% discout and 33% discout at the same time it is possible to discount a smaller percentage 80% - 33%=57% discount\nThe question is asked with \"an 80% off and a 33%\" so its probably that it will be two different sales, and they wont combine the percentage.\nSo then i would need to find out 3% of what they started with, which is 3% of (initial number) = <<3% of (initial Number) = (initial # of X 100)=10>>10%, subtract that and the initial number, then subtract a number close to the original discount from the answer I found.\n\nSo I want to find 3% of the initial number, to do that lets write it as 3(from my calculator) = 0.0333\n\nSo the final answer = 0.000333 * (Original number) \n\nAnswer", "answer": "B: city"}

{"idx": 353, "text": "E\nIn the given situations, he was unhappy, he end the pain by died, that's why it's the correct answer\n\nInput:Making pizza is an art, and there are as many different ways of making it as there are recipes...but what is common to all, and indeed perhaps the most important factor in getting a good and tasty pizza is to take your time, bake it slow, so the mozzarella will melt and the crust will have the crunchy outer crust that everyone wants.  But to make the perfectly crispy on the outside, yet tender inside pizza, baking it in the oven slow and slow isn't sufficient.  What you also must do is turn it every 15 minutes or so, otherwise the air trapped in the oven heats up and makes the pizza crust into something that is so brittle it will never taste remotely like anything other than burnt cardboard. So in summary, the correct baking method takes time, and that is what this puzzle is about.  The baking time in minutes you need to enter to get the perfectly crispy crust on the outside and soft in the inside pizza is:\nOutput: A pizza needs to be baked for 15*(minutes/15) = 15min+15min+10min  = 40 minutes to have a good crispy crust\nIf he needs to make a pizza for 40 minutes for a good crust then he need 10 more for the sides so he need 50 minutes in total\n\nInput: 1 2 3 4\nOutput: 1\nBecause the first number is 1\n\nInput: 2012 2013 2014 2015\nOutput: 2015+1= <<2015+2=2017>>2017\nBecuase the first number\n\nInput: 0 7 43 11 0 0 0 1\nOutput: 0\nBecuase\n\nInput: -6 3 449 -2 -8 517 -2 -3 673 -2\nOutput: 517+4", "answer": "D: unhappy"}

In total, how many miles did it travel?\nOutput: The ant starts 150 feet from the crumb, and by walking from there to the crumb at a constant speed of, say 30 feet per second it will take 30/6=<<30/6=5>>5 seconds. If we have 5 miles= 18000 feet. So 5 seconds times 18001 gives us 9000 feet, and 9000 divided by 5 = 1800. (1800 is the number of feet the ant walks there.)  It takes the ant 5=<<5=5>>5 seconds to fly back, which is equal to the same fraction of 150 feet. Therefore, the ant flies at 150/30=<<150/3=4.7>>4.7 miles per hour. Then, since it walks at 150 feet per second, it walks for an additional 150/150=<<15/15>>3 seconds back to the crumb, for a total of 13.66 miles for the round trip. It flew 4.7 miles on the way over, 1.7 miles on the trip back, and then back-tracked on the walk home for 3 miles, for a total of about 8.5 miles.\n\nInput:\nA plane makes a round-trip flight.

This supplier ships its items in a carrier with a maximum speed of 600 miles per day for a 24?-hour shift.  The company\u2019s current contract with the carrier that operates over the three time zones requires them to pay $8.50 for each shipment, but it has an opportunity to contract with an alternate carrier with the same speed but a lower fee of $4.35 per shipment.

Thus, there were at least 3500 of widgets available to sell at the end of last the year.\n\n\nInput: You've decided to get a loan from a bank, but you want to know what your interest rate is going to be.  The banker tells you that the loan is being offered at prime + 0.65%.  How much interest do you expect to pay over this type of loan?\n\nOutput: The current prime rate is 6.75%.  You'll be charged an additional 0.65% if you take out a loan from this banker.  0.65% is the rate of increase of the loan amount.  To apply this increase you must multiply the loan amount.\nThe loan amount is $500(your starting amount that you borrowed) = $500(5.000155% increase) = $505.  $505 multiplied 500 is $2526", "answer": "D: happiness"}

The equation:\n\n\\[distance = \\frac {(speed of light) * (186,064 miles/second)^2} {(186,0*492,0*186)*(199,584) miles} \\ \\text {= } 5,840,611.9859168\\ \\text {miles} \\] \\(speed of light \u00d7 velocity of earth) / (186,2548 \u00d7 3296000) \\(5,840 \\text {miles}\\ = 5,841\\text {miles}\\) \\[5,941\\text {mil=2005 } \\] \\[2,00 5 \\(\\) miles]\n\nThen since 5,842 is equal to one and the distance Earth travels is more than 5,000 miles, it will take 5,84 1+ years to make one revolution around Earth.\nSo the final  answe is B\n\nInput:A 1", "answer": "E: mail box"}

So the correct answer is A\n\nInput: Write a program to simulate an election.  You will need to keep track of how many votes each candidate received, how many people voted, and whether the votes resulted in a winner for the election.\n    In this simulation, there are three candidates in the election and each voter chooses one candidate to vote for.  This output should be a string containing a space-separated list of the three candidate\u2019s names (not necessarily in the same order in which they were received).  The input should be a space-separated string that contains the name of each candidate.  You first need to read in the list of candidates.\n    So the first candidate\u2019s name is \u201cJoe\u201d\n    So the second candidate\u2019s name is \"Frank'\n   //So the third candidate\u2019s name is Peter\n\n    After each candidate\u2019s name, there will be an extra space in the string.

Thus, if Frank' came in third place, he would be listed as Frank' after Joe and before Peter.\n    For the simulation, each candidate is declared to win an election with probability 0.5.  So, the probability of the first candidate winning an election is 0.5.\n   //The probability of the second candidate winning an election is again 0.5.   It is just that Joe won the election, rather than the second person Frank'\n    Thus, Joe wins with probability 0.25 and Frank' wins with probability 0, (5/13).\n    A candidate wins an election with probability 1/8 if he gets 3 or 4 votes, and with probability 8/81 if gets 5 or more", "answer": "B: shout at"}

The number in this case is 785.856. The decimal equivalent of this number is obviously 0.78585. Therefore, the decimal equivalent of 785. Then we need to find the decimal equivalent of 800 which is 8. After that, we find the percentage change in the number. The previous percentage change was 785.78586/785*.1=.000031238. The decimal equivalent of 8*312.3=24531. Lastly, all this calculation will be multiplied with 785. The answer is then 24531*0.785 which equals to 642115.

How much would it cost to produce 2000 computers and how much would it cost to maintain and support them if 2000 were the total quantity?\nOutput: The manufacturing cost for 2,000 computers is 2000*95.8=<<2000*15.8m=317.6>>317.6 millions.\nLikewise, the maintenance for this quantity remains at 2000(31.4) =<<2000*(31.4)>>597.2 millions.\nTherefore, the total comes to 317.6+597.2 = <<317.6 + 597.2>>1.1 billion.\n\nInput: 55 students are taking a 5-day long course on a subject.

For a total cost of less than $10,000, it should be pretty evident that there isn\u2019t enough money for one teacher who would cost $10k at least to teach the whole course alone. This suggests that a number of tutors is needed to cover the cost of teaching.

The new equipment will cost $120 per day while it is rented, and it can be rented for 240 days.  How does the company factor in the number of days before it buys?\nOutput: If the company rents it for 240=<<240=1>>1 day, the cost will be $120. $120*1 =<<120*1=120>>$120. They did not use the term \"the number of days\" here, although it appears, but rather simply said how many days.\n\nThe answer for the same question might be:\nIf it is rented for 2 days, the cost will be 2*120=<<2*120>>240$240. This means that it will cost twice as much to rent it as it would to buy it. However, 240=1<<240=2>>$240.

For example, correct answers include cow, goat, lamb, or chicken.\n\nTherefore answer C.\n\nInput: Three trains, Trains A, B, and C, leave simultaneously from the same platform, each heading in a different direction.\nTrain A leaves for Milwaukee at 60 miles an hour,\nTrain B leaves for Houston at 80 miles an hour, and\nTrain C leaves for Cleveland at 100 miles an hour.\nAs the trains leave the station platform, a cyclist starts riding and heads away from the platform at 10 miles an hour.  The cyclist is headed to \nWashington, DC, and intends to reach there before the return of the trains, but only if he can maintain his given rate of speed while negotiating the local hills.  It is safe to assume there are no tolls along the road.\nIf each mile of the trip is the same length, how far will the cyclist have traveled when all the trains are past the cyclist?\nOutput: All the trains are past the bike when they have all gone x/100=<<all the trains are past the bicycle when they have all gone (x/100)=0-99>>99 miles.\nThe bike travels x/100 miles to the town every day. It has taken 99 miles to pass.\nIt takes Train A 11 hours.\nIt takes Train B 14 hours\nIt takes Train C 17 hours\nSo\nC times 100+11+14+17 = C*100+104=C*135 = 445\nAnd Train A is 11*100=1100  and Train B is 17*100= 1700\n\nSo the total number of miles is 3455.\n\nInput: A large truck traveling", "answer": "C: cow"}

And then people fall in the spaces that they create like population?   D: Everyone in this world is a group of people.   Group is a definition of a population.   Since everyone here is a population of people living in this world.\nSo the correct answer is A\n\nInput: The population of the world is constantly growing.

Choices: A: It will increase by three times B: It will double C: It will triple D: It will quadruple\nOutput: It will only keep multiplying by 2.   1/2=<<1/2=50%>>50% multiplies by 2 to result in 100%  1/2 again multiplies by 2 again to result in 200% and so on.

After 7 days, Jennie only pays $190. Additional days are $190/4 = $47.50.\n\n*2: Assume that round-trip takes one hour. Then each trip requires 2 hours of travel.\n\n*2.5: Multiply the average driving time per round trip by the number of round trips. Then multiply by the number of days (7 * 20 = 140).\n\nSo, 7*100*160=<<7*100 * 160 = 9950>>35,600\n\n*3.5: Multiplying each term by how much he will rent for a day. He will be charged 50 * 6. =<<50 * 6 = 300>>305 for total cost of 300 + 50*4 =<<300 + 200>>52\n\n*4.5: 14*50 =<<14*50=700>>700. Then, 700+700=<<700+", "answer": "C: wyoming"}

The rental company charges $0.25 each mile, and 30 is to the gallon. Tom rented a car to drive to a city 480 miles away and was charged for 2 rental days (4/35). How many gallons of gas did Tom use in his rental car?\nOutput: The rental car company charges 30 cents more than a regular filling station. 10% is a good approximation for gas mileage.  There are around 30 miles to the gallon for most cars.\nTom uses 200*0.25=<<200*08=50>> 50 gallons of gas.  Tom charges 200*(480*0.20)+35=<<135,000>>135,035 total.\nSo the final and correct answer is 135035\n\nInput: A rancher is planning to transport 400 head cattle 60 miles on his own road to higher ground to protect herd from possible inland flood.

{"idx": 969, "text": "**Solution:**\nThere are six letters that follow D.\nThe first three letters have the initial word that follows them be EA or AE depending on how you choose to write them. Either E is going to be the starting letter and A is going to be the ending letter or A is the starting letter and E is the ending letter, either way an A or an E is the ending letter for any of these letters.\nIf we begin with the first letter, there are two options for where the final E or A might be.  In both cases, we will have to have a D at the beginning.\nIn case C it will be CAED\nIncase D it will be DEDA\nYou will see that at least two options will come after any case, the D is always the end so when you come to the first four letters. It is already going to be a D or DED or CAED\n\nWhen we move on to the fifth letter, we will have to add a new starting letter as there are no double initial letters. If we choose the E it will be CEDE, if we choose the D it will be DEED\nThe next letter can only come after a D or a DED (the end letter must be D) or CEDE or DEED depending on the starting letter chosen\n\nFinally we will come to the last letter and only after the starting and ending letters, the sixth letter must be D.\n\n**Ex.**\nIf you started with AE, it would have DEDA\nIf you started with EA it would be CEDE\n**Solution**\nWe begin with A and so CEDE would be the last word, as we have D as the last letter,\n\nWe begin with E, CEED would be the last word as we have D as our end letter,\n\nWe can see that the solution would be CEDE or CEED", "answer": "A: strain"}

Output the number of weeks.\nExample - '4' == 1 week and 4 days; '6' == 1 week 6 days.\nOutput: Since we know exactly how many days we have left, we know this number cannot be an integer. Therefore, we should take the floor of this number, represented by the integer of that number, and then add the number of days.\nIn other words, (2/6 of 1) = 2 days.

At the time the students left their seats, they had traveled 100 miles. The students leave the stadium and  arrive at their destination 30 minutes apart.  How long did the game last?\nOutput: Two students were at the football game. the game ended at 6pm.  The time spent at the game was 100/2=<<100/2=(75+35)/4>>(75+35/4) and the distance between the stadium and their homes was 6*2=<<6*2=(12+12)/4>>(12+12/4). So each student spent 45 minutes at the game. the distance traveled each way (6 * 2) = 12.  So their travel to their homes was 12*2=<<12*2=(24+24)/3>>(24+24/3).  Since each student left 30 minutes apart they each spent 24/3 =<<24/3=3/2>>3/2 minutes traveling time for a total travel time of (45+3/2)=<<45+3/5>>45+3/4.

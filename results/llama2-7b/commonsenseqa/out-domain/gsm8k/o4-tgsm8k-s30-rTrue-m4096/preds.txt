In order to pass you, one person must brake longer and at a slower rate than the other person.  You travel _ at _______ per second and the other travels _______ at _______ per _______.  What is the smallest distance for each car to travel between them when they pass each other?<n>Output: 5 (you), 2 (other person), 2, 1, 0, 1.<n>The distance (1 unit) each car covers per second (s), between when they pass, is given by the formula: 1/(Distance per s-(braking time per s)).<n>We know the two speeds: we want to get away from the slower one and we keep a fixed distance, so the two vehicles will not run into each other:<n><n>Car A, traveling at V_A (2, in our case) at 1 unit/s will slow down at 0.1 unit/s and reach 0 s/u (stopped).<n>Car B, traveling at V, will brake at 0 s/u and will slow down at 2.12 s/u (and, if V_B (1, in our case) is the same as in V_A then braking time is 14 s/u instead of 1).<n>So, at 9 s/u after braking, Car B (traveling at 2 u/s) will pass Car A at 0 s/p (stopped).<n>Finally, two vehicles will pass each other at 10 s/up.<n><n>Distance (p) between Car A and Car B while they pass each other is p = (9-1)<n><n>So, distance (0.9) between Car A and B when they pass each other is the minimum required distance.<n>So the final part of the question can be interpreted as: Two vehicles travel at 2 u/p in the same direction with p=1/3 unit between each other. When passing each other, the cars' maximum braking time is 2 seconds (12 u/s). Then, what is the minimum time at which cars will pass each other? Answer: 2/3 second.

Certainly, fire materials must be gathered and the fire started. This takes a significant amount of time and it is impossible to cook any food until you can complete this task.<n>Aside from fire, the camper must get supplies to prepare the food, which generally requires a trip to town.  Depending on the food, it may take more or less time to gather the supplies.<n>For breakfast, you might only need a pan, eggs, salt and pepper, and some bread.  On the other hand, camping for a week might require buying meat, grains, spices, condiments, produce, and other supplies to prepare several meals for the duration.  While you might not be cooking every day, you will still have to gather the necessary supplies every day that you eat.  This can take a significant amount of time, especially if you are buying supplies for multiple people and need to go to several grocery stores.  Also, this task is best completed by someone who is not cooking.<n><n>Input:<n>Two hours and 30 minutes<n>Output:<n><<2*30+1=63>><n>63 minutes<n><n>Input:<n>Four hours<n>Output:<n><<4*60=240>><n>240 minutes<n><n>##

So the square of 6 is 6*6=<<6*6=36>>36. Since 36 is a even number, then 6^4 must be an even number. Lets see if 6^4 is divisible by 2. Lets break it up into 6*36/4 = 9*36/4. We know that 36 is divisible by 4. So by division by 9, 36/9 ends up being a multiple of 9, which means 36 is a multiple of 9. 36/9 = 6/2 and 6/2 = 3. So 36 is a factor of 6^4.

She lives in a state of the US that allows abortions until the 9th month of pregnancy.  The woman decides to have an abortion, but her doctor says it will cost her approximately $10,000.  She doesn't have that amount and will incur penalties for attempting to obtain money to pay for the procedure.<n>How much, at most, can the woman afford to pay?<n> Output: If the state allows abortions until the ninth month then she is allowed to have abortions until then.  To be less expensive, they can be done in earlier months.  If the doctor is willing to work for $10,0<n> the state allows later abortions, then she may have a later abortion.  Then she will be charged a penalty for the money she may have to pay for the later abortion.  Since the woman lives in a state which has a later abortion policy that may cost more than the $10, 000,<n> the maximum the woman can afford to pay for an abortion will be $10,0 000.<n><n>

They build their dams in RIVER! river! river! River! River! river!river!<n>So the answer is lake or river<n><n>##### A solution:<n><n>It might be easier to think about these questions as a way to test the quality of your programming skills rather than just as programming questions.<n><n>The first one I think is the easiest, you can break it down into this:<n><n>1.The car rental doesn't make the first week free.<n>2.That means you just look at the last 7 days.<n>3.But to get your answer to the last 7 days you have to do the total work divided by the number of days.<n>4.The number of days are 11-7 =4.<n>5.So then you get the total and divide it by 4.<n><n>The second problem I think is a bit harder.<n><n>You can think about it this way: you can have no cars, just transport. Or you can have both transport and cars.<n><n>So you don't think of the problem "how many cars are left", you think "how many rides are left".<n><n>I think this one works out well:<n><n>Jason, lets say the first $100 a day = one ride.<n><n>500 for 16 days = 80.<n><n>Another $100 a ride = 20% discount so total now is 72.<n>If they stay another 6 days they have paid for a total of $72 for 22 days.<n><n>For the third problem:<n><n>The only extra step is, first you have to find how much it costs per day then you have to figure out how long it takes to go there.<n><n>But if you do this you should get 172 hours per year for this one.<n><n>For the fourth one this gets a bit easier:<n><n>First thing to note is that beavers want water.<n><n>I would say to figure out how much time the beavers would need to build that.<n><n>Then you need to find that time multiplied by 7 days.

We then have to find their answer and mark them (A-F) with 1s, and everything else with 0s.<n>I know this may sound complicated, but I was sure they were trying to confuse us or make it harder to complete the quiz.

How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Output: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>So the final answer is 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Output: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>So the final answer is 72<n><n>Input:If you want to make a big splash in a river with a rock, from where should you throw it? Choices:  A: mountains countryside B: ground C: bridge D: mountain range E: surface of earth<n>Output:		Choice "C" answer is correct.<n>Since there is not a mountain and a range, "C" is chosen.<n>So the final Answer is "C"<n><n>Input: You are lost in the forest because you have no map or compass.  Which of these directions will you follow to get back to camp? Choices: C: turn right back at the river D: turn left back at the river E: go straight until you find a river F: go left back at the tree<n>Output: Choice D answer is correct.<n>Because there is no left and right option, "D" is chosen.<n>The final answer is "D"<n><n>Input: While at the zoo, a boy named Jack visits a farm animal exhibit that includes a sheep, a cow, a sheepdog and a bull. Given the following facts, what is the minimum number of times Jack is allowed to walk around the animal enclosure without crossing his own path? Output: Two paths are possible:<n><n>1. The cow is followed by the sheep.<n>2. The bull is followed by the sheepdog.<n>As long as jack makes the same set of turns, the paths are not the same unless he is walking around the same animals.<n>If you start with the right path, you will have to do a U-turn unless you go into the cow pasture.<n>If you start on the left path, you cannot do a U-turn.<n>Thus, Jack must walk counter-clockwise around a circular path, meaning at least two full circles.<n>So the final is 2<n><n><n>

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

Choices: A: a provision B: a provisioning C: a provisionaire D: a provident D: a provident E: a provender<n>Output: Both a provision and a provisioning refer to things which provide for the future, which can include rations and supplies, and thus both are likely choices. A provisionaire (one who provides for others) is a bit unlikely, as “provision” itself means something that provides for others. It wouldn’t make sense to use “provisionaire” to mean something that would then include all the things of which “provision” is used (e.g. rations, supplies). A provident is a good guess because it means foresight, but it doesn’t appear to be used much in modern English. Provenance doesn’t match because it refers to the history/lineage of works of art, and isn’t commonly used in English to mean the stuff/rations people typically take with them. A provender is something that contains food for animals.

Choices:  A: fishing camp B: hardware store C: engine D: your spine E: sporting goods store<n>Output:		A fishing camp<n>As a general term used across American culture the phrase "you've thrown a rod" refers to a rod having been mishandled and damaged by the one throwing it. A rotted fishing rod is used in the game of baseball. The rod (made of wood), that the player is throwing is called a "sporting goods store." A "hardware store" might produce the rod. An engine is most likely to have problems in it and could probably even be "mishandled" (but still, it is not a sporting good, nor is it part of a sporting goods store). Lastly, a "spine" is part of the hardware in your body. In none of these is the phrase "you're throwing a rod" applicable. You probably have a fish story about a damaged fishing rod, that you've already told many times, but you're not really throwing one. At least you're not doing it in this case.<n><n>Input: Which of the following is a correct definition of "jump a shark"?<n><n>Output:<n><<n>b-2 = 1<n><n></b-2 = 2<n><n></b-3 = 2<n><n><<n>b-3 = <<b-3=3>>33<n><n>b-4 = 2<n><n>Output: a: 34400 is one million more than 50000 in binary<n>b: b-2=b-2=1<n>c: b-3=2 in binary<n>d: b-4=2 in binary<n>e: b-5=2 in binary<n><n>Input: What did the 8-year old say to the 6-year old?<n><n>Output: "You talk to much."<n><n>Input: This is a question for people who can speak English properly.

But they are still people and they are lined up, and that's a road block... so C it is!!<n><n> <n><n>Submission:Click the "Submit" button to complete your submission to that problem.<n><n>### Important Notes:<n><n>-Make sure to put your answers under the code: else the bot won't execute the code.<n><n>-Answer the whole problem then click submit.<n><n>-Heres our example how it looks like:<n><n><n>```<n>In the example here:<n>[Input] [Problem statement] (e.g. Which of the animals comes closest in weight to one pound?)<n>[Output] [Solution] [Your answer]<n>```<n><n><n><n><n><n>### Tips and hints:<n>-Remember to write the problem statement and what is the expected output<n><n>-Its recommended to take more than necessary time to solve the problem and submit it to the bot.

They can ride at times when the ride is only partially occupied or they can purchase a ticket and ride at an exclusive time where only their group is allowed to ride. They decided to buy the ticket so that they can ride whenever they want during their two hours at the park.<n><n>Output: Jonathan and his sister, Jenne, could use the equation of a function to describe a relationship between the prices of the two options: $140 for a partial ride or $130 for exclusive ride<n>Since there are 42 seats on the roller coater, 2 hours equals 2*60=<<2*60=120 >>120 individual seats that they can occupy. The exclusive ride will cost 42/2 because they want it when they want and there are 10 seats that are occupied by the general public and then they each get 42-10=<<42-10 = 32>>32 individual seats that are available to them. They can occupy (120+32)=<<12

It's true that exercise prevents heart attacks, but so does not smoking, having a healthy weight, being free of diabetes, not drinking excessively, and having a nutritious diet.<n>You may have also heard that exercise helps you relax. However, this is misleading. Relaxation is a temporary respite, and stress is a constant state. Exercise may help decrease tension, but it cannot fully cure stress since stress is a mental construct that can only be re-appropriated, and not fully eliminated, by conscious intent. Exercise also cannot decrease stress in the long term (over periods greater than 5-7 minutes) because it is only a temporary solution to the underlying stress.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question in 20 words or less.<n><n>What is the purpose of this question?What is the purpose of exercise?What is the purpose to drive to town?<n>What is the purpose to run an experiment?<n>What is the benefit of exercise?<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n><n>Input;1.

Choices:  A: front door B: conference C: classroom D: refrigerator E: suitcase<n>Output:		The ANSWER A << ANSWER  A= ANSWER  ==> The answer is C<n><n>### Instruction: Answer the following questions according to the questions asked.<n><n>#### Part One<n><n>In the context of a small community, who do you think a local paper notice is likely to be left to?<n><n>Answer: According to the context above, the local paper is a type of community notice where people post important announcements and information in community places. In this context, the person would be likely to find information notices, such as an upcoming meeting, a job opening, or even a birth announcement in a local paper. The notice would be likely to be left on the front door, conference, classroom, refrigerator, or suitcase.<n><n>In a classroom, do you think you would find a paper notice in the fridge or the suitcase?<n><n>Answer: No, in a classroom, I would not find a paper notice in a suitcase or the refrigerator because these items are not commonly used in a classroom. If paper notices are left in a classroom, it is more likely to be left on conference or the front door because these are the most commonly used items in the classroom and are visible to everyone.<n><n>#### Part Two <n><n>Is the fridge classified as a conference?<n><n>Answer: The Fridge in this context is a commonly used item in a home or in a classroom and is not a conference. So it is not classified as a conference.<n><n>Is the suitcase a classroom?<n><n>Answer: A suitcase is an item placed in luggage or carried for travel, not a classroom. So it is not a classroom.<n><n>#### Part three <n><n>Is the suit case a classified as a conference or is there another conference that would be better classified?<n><n>Answer: In this context, a suitcase is not classified as an item that can be used as a conference.<n>In the context of classrooms, a conference can refer to a group of students who meet together to discuss the class or study topics. Alternatively, classroom conferences can refer to the time when a teacher meets with a student to discuss progress and plans for the future. <n><n>#### Part four <n><n>A paper notice left on the fridge is likely to be found in which area of the

How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Output: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>So the final answer is 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Output: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>So the final answer is 72<n><n>Input:In the movie a fragile man is causing accidents, his hope is to find a person opposite of him who is what? Choices:  A: undestroyable B: unbreakable C: indestructible D: durable E: invisible<n>Output:		A is undestroyable(is not destroyed).<n>B is unbreakable(it can't be broken).<n>C is indestructible(cannot be destroyed).<n>D is durable(sturdiness)<n>E is invisible(can be seen).<n>The guy thinks A and B would be great because it wouldn't be destroyed so he would want to try A.<n><n>Input:In school, there are 30 students.  All of the students are in one of the 6 classes. How many students are in each classroom?<n>Output:A,B,C,D,E,F<n>The answer is 30/6=<<30/6=5>>5<n>For every classroom there are 5 students.<n>There are 6 classes.  To find the answer, use the 5 multiplying 6.  So 30 multiplied by 5 will give you 150. <n>The 30 students will be in 6 classes. 30 multiplied 5 gives you 150, but that's only the total number of students, not the number of students in each classroom. <n>So, there are 5 students each in every classroom<n>So the final answer a 5 * 6=<<5*6=>30>>30<n><n>Input: The number of people who live in Boston is 600,000, or divisible by the number 0. The number 0 is divisible by every number.  The number 0 is not a prime number and is not divisible by any prime number. It is not negative. It is not divisible by 6.<n>Output: The number not divisible by prime numbers<n>If it is not negative then it is: positive<n>If it is divisible by 6, then it is positive<n>Otherwise, it is negative<n>If it is not divisible by prime number<n>then it is positive<n>If it is not positive, then it is not divisible<n>If it is positive, then it is divisible<n>So the result is positive<n><n>Input: The year 2014 is 2014.The year 28 is 2018.

But to make the perfectly crispy on the outside, yet tender inside pizza, baking it in the oven slow and slow isn't sufficient.  What you also must do is turn it every 15 minutes or so, otherwise the air trapped in the oven heats up and makes the pizza crust into something that is so brittle it will never taste remotely like anything other than burnt cardboard. So in summary, the correct baking method takes time, and that is what this puzzle is about.  The baking time in minutes you need to enter to get the perfectly crispy crust on the outside and soft in the inside pizza is:<n>Output: A pizza needs to be baked for 15*(minutes/15) = 15min+15min+10min  = 40 minutes to have a good crispy crust<n>If he needs to make a pizza for 40 minutes for a good crust then he need 10 more for the sides so he need 50 minutes in total<n><n>Input: 1 2 3 4<n>Output: 1<n>Because the first number is 1<n><n>Input: 2012 2013 2014 2015<n>Output: 2015+1= <<2015+2=2017>>2017<n>Becuase the first number<n><n>Input: 0 7 43 11 0 0 0 1<n>Output: 0<n>Becuase<n><n>Input: -6 3 449 -2 -8 517 -2 -3 673 -2<n>Output: 517+4

In total, how many miles did it travel?<n>Output: The ant starts 150 feet from the crumb, and by walking from there to the crumb at a constant speed of, say 30 feet per second it will take 30/6=<<30/6=5>>5 seconds. If we have 5 miles= 18000 feet. So 5 seconds times 18001 gives us 9000 feet, and 9000 divided by 5 = 1800. (1800 is the number of feet the ant walks there.)  It takes the ant 5=<<5=5>>5 seconds to fly back, which is equal to the same fraction of 150 feet. Therefore, the ant flies at 150/30=<<150/3=4.7>>4.7 miles per hour. Then, since it walks at 150 feet per second, it walks for an additional 150/150=<<15/15>>3 seconds back to the crumb, for a total of 13.66 miles for the round trip. It flew 4.7 miles on the way over, 1.7 miles on the trip back, and then back-tracked on the walk home for 3 miles, for a total of about 8.5 miles.<n><n>Input:<n>A plane makes a round-trip flight.

The carrier that normally delivers materials from the factories to the warehouse can travel at speeds of 200 miles per day. The company has three suppliers, each shipping materials, one of which operates over three time zones away.  This supplier ships its items in a carrier with a maximum speed of 600 miles per day for a 24?-hour shift.  The company’s current contract with the carrier that operates over the three time zones requires them to pay $8.50 for each shipment, but it has an opportunity to contract with an alternate carrier with the same speed but a lower fee of $4.35 per shipment.  However, there would now be a penalty of $0.50 for each trip crossing a time zone.  How much cheaper would it be to contract with the alternate carrier and how many shipments, in total, each week, will the company receive?<n>Output: The company has one supplier where, instead of shipping it’s products from the factories to warehouse, the items will be picked up and shipped from the supplier’s warehouse directly to the warehouse.  Three deliveries each week, from three vendors, will cost $3475.  The alternative would be to pick up the items from the factories and drive them to the warehouse with the old carrier, which would cost $4350 weekly.

How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Output: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>So the final answer is 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Output: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>So the final answer is 72<n><n>Input:Sam was against Allison's decision.  Joe was the opposite.  What was Joe, regarding that decision? Choices:  A: being for B: away from C: combined D: for or E: conjunction<n>Output:		Joe: not being Sam is for her decision<n>Joe: being for her decision<n>So the final answer for this question is: D: Joe is for or against Sam’s decision.<n><n>Input: A small-time grocer is facing the bankruptcy and has asked a nearby large grocery chain to buy parts of his business.  If the large grocery chain buys 1/5 of the small-time grocer's business by purchasing only the grocery store, how much must be paid for the non-grocery store business?<n>Output: If only the grocery business is sold, and that part of the business is $1/5th of the business then the non-grocerty business is $5/6 = 5/6$5/6 of the business worth 1/5 of $5/6 = $1/6$1/6.<n>So The question is to calculate the grocery business.<n>To calculate the grocery, divide the non-grocetery business by 1/6.<n>5/6=1/3$5/6=1$1$1/$6 = $5/6$5.6<n>So $5/6$3 divided by the $5/6$1 is $1/$6$5.6/3 which equals $1/6$5.<n>You can either do it as $4.25$4.25 times 5 is $21.25$21.25<n>So the final answer will be $21.2621.26<n><n>Input: Joe’s new car seat cost him $1700.  Two years ago, he sold his old car seat for $100. In what year did he buy the new car seat?<n>Output: In his own words, when the car seat he bought costs $1700 and the one he sold cost $100, he bought it two years ago.  Since $100 is less than or equal to $1700, two years ago was during the time when $100 bought a new car seat<n>So the final answer can be that Joe bought the new car seat two years ago when it was worth $100<n><n>Input:$17/56^2$17/56<n>Output:

Choices:  A: skate B: play piano C: fiddle D: play piano E: have fun<n>Output:		Since this is a multiple choice problem, it states that choices B and C are incorrect.<n>The correct answer is choice A (skate)! We can infer this from the question because it states that you  listen to music, and skateboarding could be a method of listening to music.<n>It is also stated that choices B (play piano), and d(fiddle) are incorrect, so there are no other good choices in the problem for us to select.  Thus, the final answer is choice A<n><n>Input: We can infer several things about the problem from the question.The first is that the question is a multiple choice problem.  Since choices B, E, D, and C are all incorrect, the final answer will have to be B (play the piano)! We have ruled out all the previous options!<n>Because it states that the question consists of several people who play music, and also the statement “The music player selects a group of people he wants to perform his music.”<n>So, the final answer is B (play the piano)<n><n>Input: The problem consists of several people who want to play music, and 2ndly, the musician wants to select a few people to perform his music, implying that he wants to play with his group.<n>If music is what it is intended to be, I presumed so!  It has to be music, and since it is given that “The musician selects a group of persons he wants to perform his  music” he wants to do exactly that! So the final answer is C (music).<n><n>Input: The question asked if the player is going to play alone, so the question should be answered with a choice other than D (play in a band).  The answer will definitely not be D (play in a group), because the other option is A (play alone), which is not an option either, or the question would be ridiculous.  So, I left only choices A and C because of that reason.<n>The choices, A (play alone) or D (play in a Band), are incorrect because we are being asked if the player plays alone or with multiple people, and the two choices, A and D, are both incorrect by definition.<n>Because A is wrong, and D is wrong, C must be the final answer!<n><n>Input: The final answer is A (play alone).  The player plays alone, and it is the correct answer!<n><n>

Choices:  A: airport B: gotham city C: london D: city E: gas stations<n>Output:		The only thing with red phone booths outside of the UK is a city.<n>An airport is a place where you travel in or out of the country. It is also a place where you see people flying planes, going through passport control, etc. But it is NOT a place where you call someone and talk on your cell phone, as you cannot make a regular connection through an airport. Since a gas station is only somewhere that you buy fuel and fill up some cars, you cannot call someone from a gas station and talk on your cell. So that leaves a city. A place that has stores, restaurants, parks where you can see people and their dogs, etc. Finally, a city may have many types of automobiles, including public transit vehicles (i.e. buses, trolleys, subways, trains, etc) so in the case of a city, it is possible to call someone on your cell phone and the only time it is not possible is if the cell phone signal is absent.<n>So the final argument is (C)<n><n>Input:How many cents are there in 2334 cents and 379 cents?<n>Output:379=<3>3<7>9<n>

Choices:  A: front door B: newspaper C: post office D: package E: mail box<n>Output:		Front door<n>Each weekday, the post office or the grocery store is more likely to have one’s mail than the neighbors are.<n>Choices:  A:  front door B:  newspaper C:  post office D:  package E: mail box  A can be ignored because one is not likely to put his or her mail in a newspaper.<n>One does not use choice B,  because if the mail had been stolen while it was being delivered to the house (i.e., if there were no front door to secure the mail),  then all would be in an uproar.<n>Thus, choice D is most plausible because it would be the only delivery time during the day when the contents of the mailbox could be delivered to a neighbor’s house.<n>So the final answe is D<n><n>Input: The speed of light equals 186,000 miles/second. The Earth revolves around the sun in an orbit of 584,000,000 miles. How much time does it take Earth to make one revolution around the sun?<n>Output:The first step is to write down the equation for the distance traveled by Earth in one year since it does not go directly to the sun. The equation:<n><n>\[distance = \frac {(speed of light) * (186,064 miles/second)^2} {(186,0*492,0*186)*(199,584) miles} \ \text {= } 5,840,611.9859168\ \text {miles} \] \(speed of light × velocity of earth) / (186,2548 × 3296000) \(5,840 \text {miles}\ = 5,841\text {miles}\) \[5,941\text {mil=2005 } \] \[2,00 5 \(\) miles]<n><n>Then since 5,842 is equal to one and the distance Earth travels is more than 5,000 miles, it will take 5,84 1+ years to make one revolution around Earth.<n>So the final  answe is B<n><n>Input:A 1

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The car-rental agency charges $30/day for a car, or $190 for the first week for a rental that lasts an entire week or longer. Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Output: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>So the final answer is 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Output: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>So the final answer is 72<n><n>Input:Where can you store a small notepad on your person? Choices:  A: back pocket B: meeting C: drug store D: home E: school<n>Output:		If you have your notepad with you on "Back Pocket", there are "Meetings" where you can store it.<n>Similarly, If you have your notebook with you "Home", there are "Drug Store" where you can store your notepad. If you have your notepaper with you "Drug Store", there are "High School" for you to store your notepad<n>So "home+drugstore" is "back+pocket", "drugstore+school" is "back+meeting", "home+home school" is "back+home", "drugstore + meeting" is "back+drugstore" "High School + Home" is "back+highschool" and "Home + School" is "back+schoold"<n>So out of all of these options, options C and D would allow you to store your note pad<n>So the final answer would be "D"<n><n>Input: What is the largest number of apples you can get from a tree of 150 pounds where each pound of apples has at least 4 apples in it?<n>Output: If there is no "4" then it becomes 1, and if there are more than "4" it becomes "0"<n><n>For example, 150 > 4 + 3 or 163/3 =<<163/3=54>>54<n>Thus, the maximum number of apples you get is 54.<n><n>Input: A car that is 3.2 ft wide needs a 6.4 ft lane to drive through.  If a car of width 9.6ft travels at 60 m/h, how long will it take the car to travel from one end of the lane to the other? <n>Output: The minimum lane width is 6.4 feet and the car needs this much space to fit through.<n>At 60 miles per hr the car will travel 2ft per second<n>So 1*3.2ft = <<1*3.2=3.2>>3.2 ft of width is covered in 60 seconds<n>So the final answer will be 60<n>

Choices:  A: wear shoes B: learn C: hope for peace D: have a great day. E: do well<n>Output:		 All of the following were required: learn, get ready, pay attention, hope for peace.  This problem has three solution<n>The first thing you learn is that it had four choices and all of them are not required to answer the problem.  All answers that didn’t have any letters next to them were not required.  This means that the answer letter of E: do well is not required. <n>Then the second important thing to see here was the fact that the question had one more choice than the amount of choices that were actually required to answer the question. The question asked for the choice marked A: wear shoes.  This is not a choice that can be added to the four choices originally presented or all of the choices marked by A.  This means that we can remove the choice marked by A as well as the three additional choices.  This brings into play any choice marked by B: learn, or by C: hope for peace, or by D: have a great Day. <n>Now it is easier to see that only the answers marked by B: learn.  And marked by C and D: hope for peace.  are actually required.<n><n>Input: What is the area of a circle that has a radius of 5?

Choices:  A: cinema B: opera C: party D: stage E: dance<n>Output:		Answer: D. The word performance fits the best because the question is what would you see a performers at. If it is the party then maybe that the host is performing in a talent show or maybe even a magician's assistant. If it is the dance then maybe that the host are performing the hokeypokey or something at the party which would fit dance because its dancing. Even if it is the party then that the host is singing and you are at the show the opera because the word performer and operas go together. Even if it is you friends who are going the cinema then maybe the friend is performing in a remake or remixing a song or something else the word performer can describe also.<n>Now you might say that it was the choice E. Dance you might say that for the opera but that still doesn't add up. Because in the party and the dance they were talking about the host performing in the party, but for the opera it wasn't the opera performer, it was the host. That means that the host can be an artist or a performer, and with that the word performance means more to the host then to the opera.<n>So then the answer to the question would be D.<n><n>Input:A group of friends will attend a party on Friday evening, and some of them will also attend a comedy show on Saturday morning.

So the correct answer is A<n><n>Input: Write a program to simulate an election.  You will need to keep track of how many votes each candidate received, how many people voted, and whether the votes resulted in a winner for the election.<n>    In this simulation, there are three candidates in the election and each voter chooses one candidate to vote for.  This output should be a string containing a space-separated list of the three candidate’s names (not necessarily in the same order in which they were received).  The input should be a space-separated string that contains the name of each candidate.  You first need to read in the list of candidates.<n>    So the first candidate’s name is “Joe”<n>    So the second candidate’s name is "Frank'<n>   //So the third candidate’s name is Peter<n><n>    After each candidate’s name, there will be an extra space in the string.  There will also be an extra space between each of the candidates in the output.<n><n>     //This is the output of the simulation.  It is the entire candidate list with a final space (not represented in this string) at the end<n><n>    Input: Joe, Frank', Peter<n><n>     Output: Joe "Frank' Peter<n><n>     // The name of each candidate corresponds to the order of the elections in which they voted.<n><n>    If the candidate with the fewest votes is tied with another candidate, you must print out the name of the candidate after that candidate.  Thus, if Frank' came in third place, he would be listed as Frank' after Joe and before Peter.<n>    For the simulation, each candidate is declared to win an election with probability 0.5.  So, the probability of the first candidate winning an election is 0.5.<n>   //The probability of the second candidate winning an election is again 0.5.   It is just that Joe won the election, rather than the second person Frank'<n>    Thus, Joe wins with probability 0.25 and Frank' wins with probability 0, (5/13).<n>    A candidate wins an election with probability 1/8 if he gets 3 or 4 votes, and with probability 8/81 if gets 5 or more

How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Output: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>So the final answer is 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Output: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>So the final answer is 72<n><n>Input:What state shaped like a glove has a lot of farmland? Choices:  A: countryside B: farming areas C: michigan D: texas E: north dakota<n>Output:		A. Wisconsin is surrounded by Lake Michigan on most of its western and southern borders, making the shape of the state fairly close to that of a glove.<n>Although we cannot give you absolute clarity on the question itself, however, as we have come across only one answer among these options to it. So the answer to the question should be A. Wisconsin<n><n>Input:The number is 785856. What is 800% of 78586?<n>Output: The answer is 642156. We first find what the decimal equivalent of the number is. The number in this case is 785.856. The decimal equivalent of this number is obviously 0.78585. Therefore, the decimal equivalent of 785. Then we need to find the decimal equivalent of 800 which is 8. After that, we find the percentage change in the number. The previous percentage change was 785.78586/785*.1=.000031238. The decimal equivalent of 8*312.3=24531. Lastly, all this calculation will be multiplied with 785. The answer is then 24531*0.785 which equals to 642115. Note that I am not 100% sure on this solution as this came from a third person. This person was not able to answer this question. This is the first time I have tried it, and it was my first attempt. Also if no one has posted this answer, please do let me know and I will edit my answer. However, I will put both the explanations and code so that you can check it for yourselves.<n><n>Output: It is 155.50. The answer is 15550. After we found the decimal equivalent of the initial number, then it is divided by 5 so that the answer has an extra 0 as a decimal on the end. There may be more than one method on this question. <n><n>Output: The number we are trying to find is 2900. We use this method, and since all other answers (in the 2 answers provided here) were incorrect, 99% of me believes that the answer must be

Given the same quantity, the manufacturing cost for 500 computers is $131.3 million and the same is true for maintenance/support at $278.5 million.  How much would it cost to produce 2000 computers and how much would it cost to maintain and support them if 2000 were the total quantity?<n>Output: The manufacturing cost for 2,000 computers is 2000*95.8=<<2000*15.8m=317.6>>317.6 millions.<n>Likewise, the maintenance for this quantity remains at 2000(31.4) =<<2000*(31.4)>>597.2 millions.<n>Therefore, the total comes to 317.6+597.2 = <<317.6 + 597.2>>1.1 billion.<n><n>Input: 55 students are taking a 5-day long course on a subject.

For a total cost of less than $10,000, it should be pretty evident that there isn’t enough money for one teacher who would cost $10k at least to teach the whole course alone. This suggests that a number of tutors is needed to cover the cost of teaching. Thus, take the final total and divide by four topics since there are four tutor fees that are shared among 55 students and four tutors. This gives you a total tutor fee of 55/4=<<55/4>>13.

The new equipment will cost $120 per day while it is rented, and it can be rented for 240 days.  How does the company factor in the number of days before it buys?<n>Output: If the company rents it for 240=<<240=1>>1 day, the cost will be $120. $120*1 =<<120*1=120>>$120. They did not use the term "the number of days" here, although it appears, but rather simply said how many days.<n><n>The answer for the same question might be:<n>If it is rented for 2 days, the cost will be 2*120=<<2*120>>240$240. This means that it will cost twice as much to rent it as it would to buy it. However, 240=1<<240=2>>$240. Therefore, if the company buys this machine, it will cost about twice as much as it will if it rents the machine.<n><n>Input: A computer store sells an inkjet printer for $100.

It is now to be rotated by 3/4, so that it prints, "ldo, lwro".<n><n>## Solutions: If a string could be read into a string[] then the rot13 function provided below, can be called on it. It simply rotates the first and last characters by 13. So if you want it to print the input rotated by 3 you can simply call rot13(input) where you input your string. The following will result in the string printing out "ldo, lwr". And if the string prints 'Hello, world' then you need to call rot13 on it twice. This can be done using:<n><n>RotateString(input) //prints hello world<n>RotateString(RotateString(input)) //prints ldo, lwr<n>Here's the solution for the exercise. I've tested it and it worked well on different inputs.<n><n>char* rotateString (char* s)<n>{<n>    while (*s > '0')<n>    {<n>        *s-- = --(*s);<n>    }<n><n>    while (*s < '7')<n>    {<n><n>        *s++ = ++(*s);<n>    """"""<n>Output:Hello, world<n>"ldo, lwro<n>'''<n><n>Output:<n>Hello, wrold<n>ldow, rlo<n>'''<n><n>Output<n>Hello 6 wrold<n>ldo, 6 wro<n>'''<n>'''<n>If you have any questions, feel free to ask.<n>

Choices:  A: supermarket B: pig C: cow D: refrigerator E: store<n>Output:		Answers A and B are correct. Answer D is not correct, since the supermarkets do not produce milk, but instead offer milk for sale. Answer E is not correct, since stores in general do not produce milk. Only answers of the form C: animal-name, so that each animal in the sample list is a possible answer, answer the question correctly.  For example, correct answers include cow, goat, lamb, or chicken.<n><n>Therefore answer C.<n><n>Input: Three trains, Trains A, B, and C, leave simultaneously from the same platform, each heading in a different direction.<n>Train A leaves for Milwaukee at 60 miles an hour,<n>Train B leaves for Houston at 80 miles an hour, and<n>Train C leaves for Cleveland at 100 miles an hour.<n>As the trains leave the station platform, a cyclist starts riding and heads away from the platform at 10 miles an hour.  The cyclist is headed to <n>Washington, DC, and intends to reach there before the return of the trains, but only if he can maintain his given rate of speed while negotiating the local hills.  It is safe to assume there are no tolls along the road.<n>If each mile of the trip is the same length, how far will the cyclist have traveled when all the trains are past the cyclist?<n>Output: All the trains are past the bike when they have all gone x/100=<<all the trains are past the bicycle when they have all gone (x/100)=0-99>>99 miles.<n>The bike travels x/100 miles to the town every day. It has taken 99 miles to pass.<n>It takes Train A 11 hours.<n>It takes Train B 14 hours<n>It takes Train C 17 hours<n>So<n>C times 100+11+14+17 = C*100+104=C*135 = 445<n>And Train A is 11*100=1100  and Train B is 17*100= 1700<n><n>So the total number of miles is 3455.<n><n>Input: A large truck traveling

A 19th century author of stories on life, Mark Twain, said this,<n>“Waiting for the butcher's dog barked out the window at a cat in the alley. A butcher lived not far from me -- about a peg -- and every time an animal took the least bit of notice in his vicinity he set off yelling for a dog, which would come bounding down the alley-way barking and snarling. The animals in the neighborhood soon became acquainted with the circumstance and the scramble of each one away from this neighborhood was not at all a pretty sight.”<n>Waiting in line at the grocery store, waiting for the green light at the intersection, or just waiting are part of life today.  Everyday, we wait indefinitely, until our turn comes.  Oftentimes, we are waiting on our turn to do what we are waiting for.  At other times, we wait for someone else to finish what they are doing before we can do what we need to do.

To maximize my savings, after 9 months if I withdraw $10.00 from my savings each month, how much will I have?<n>Output: Because it is always better to put your money away than to spend it, the answer is $300. To find the highest savings you can accumulate it is easiest to find the longest possible number you could save at that rate (9 months times $100. That is $900).  The lowest number of your  possible savings at that rate is $10 a month (the minimum you can save). Therefore the difference between the two numbers is the amount of money you saved:  300-10

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Output: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>So the final answer is 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Output: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>So the final answer is 72<n><n>Input:Collections of atoms called molecules make up everything you can hold in your what? Choices:  A: atom B: anything C: air D: feet E: hands<n>Output:		Choice A. (atom)<n><n>Input:You get an offer for an item that costs $220. After you make $30 payments, you’ll be able to pay off the remainder of the bill. What percentage of the bill did you pay up front?<n>Output: We can express $a/b = x/y in the form  x = (100)(a/b) and we know $y = b.<n>Thus $100 * 220/30 = 100*7333/300  or roughly 720%, or $231.33. <n>Thus a payment of $30 was roughly 720% of the total original payment and we know the total original payment was $220 because we were offered to pay it off in $30 payments.<n>The remaining 300 = 30 payments * 10 which tells us we have 270 extra payments to make which means 270 payments = $220 x 3, or $710.<n>Therefore, after the first $30 payment and completing the second payments of $30, $710 payments remain.<n>After the 30th payment of $30 and payment of the final $220 is completed, the total payments made was $510 with the last payment $220.<n>The total amount paid total $510 and remaining $1620.<n>So the total payments made/total amount paid =.510 / 1620 =.3184 = 31.84%. (note that 282 would be closer to the real answer than 277 but close enough).<n>So the final answer 31.8%

How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

The rental company charges $0.25 each mile, and 30 is to the gallon. Tom rented a car to drive to a city 480 miles away and was charged for 2 rental days (4/35). How many gallons of gas did Tom use in his rental car?<n>Output: The rental car company charges 30 cents more than a regular filling station. 10% is a good approximation for gas mileage.  There are around 30 miles to the gallon for most cars.<n>Tom uses 200*0.25=<<200*08=50>> 50 gallons of gas.  Tom charges 200*(480*0.20)+35=<<135,000>>135,035 total.<n>So the final and correct answer is 135035<n><n>Input: A rancher is planning to transport 400 head cattle 60 miles on his own road to higher ground to protect herd from possible inland flood. The cattle carrier he bought costs $2,000 and holds 20 of his cattle so will cost $20 each to transport to new area.  A hurricane is hitting the southern coast of Texas.  Each of these trips will take 60 minutes because he’s traveling at 60 mpe. How many hours will it take to move the herd to its new site?<n>Output: His cattle carrier can carry the maximum to stay legal for its size at 20 becaue it will take 12.5 to transport to a new area of 60 miles. So each trip will take 60 mph/20=60/20=3 minutes.<n>Since there are several trips to make (400/25) each trip, it will take 3*100/12.5=<<3*100=300>>30 trips.

His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Output: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>So the final answer is 72<n><n>Input:We want to try some new barbecue sauces, where should we buy some? Choices:  A: detroit B: australia C: michigan park D: cafe E: retail store<n>Output:		All of the sauces are different, except detroit is A, australia is B, michigan park is C, cafe is D, retail store is E<n>So the first letter for detroit is A, the first letter for australia is B, the first letter for michigan park is C. After going through all of them, the first letter for retail store is the same as cafe. Thus the first letter for detroi, australia, michigan park, and retail store are A, B, C, and E respectively.<n><n>Input: A man is driving to New Mexico on a trip that he expects will take 7 hours and 57 minutes.  If he drives at 60 miles-per-hour, how far from his starting point should he get off the highway to reach New Mexico exactly?<n>Output: The man is expecting a travel time of 264.28 minutes or 4 hours and 34 minutes.<n>Since there are ____hours in a day, 60 miles x 264.34 minutes is ____, where, ___ is the number of hours in a day.<n>264.2 == 4.71 hours.<n>If we let ___ be an integer in the range of 0 to 10, then we end up with 0 <= ___ <= 4.71 and 10 >= ___ >= 4.71 after simplification.<n>With this in place, our solution to the problem is simply that 0 is the first hour at which the car will be at the halfway point.<n><n>Input:If, as she's approaching the state line of the state she's come from, the car is going 60 mph, we let _____ be the minimum hour (in real time) that she arrives, and we let ____ be the average hour (in real time and not the same as above) that she arrives.<n>Output:<n>A: 0.00<n>B: 0.25<n>C: 0.51<n>D: 0.72<n>E: 1.09<n>A car going 60 miles per minute (or 3600 mph) at the end of the hour gets to New Mexico in one hour.

The diner's famous "All You Can Eat Dinner" is only available at mealtime, Monday through Saturday night. It costs $12 per person and includes a hearty portion of fried chicken or fried catfish (served with fries and gravy), fresh salad (with blue cheese dressing, bacon bits, and croutons), coffee or tea, and a whole banana. The children aged 12 and under eat for just $6 per person and get smaller portions of the entrees as well as milk rather than coffee; older than 12 individuals pay the full rate. On Sunday morning only, the diner offers pancakes for only $2.25 in their "Pancakes for a Buck" breakfast.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The car-rental agency charges $30/day for a car, or $190 for the first week for a rental that lasts an entire week or longer. Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Output: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>So the final answer is 72<n><n>Input:The print was extremely small, as he was reading letter after letter he began to suffer eye what? Choices:  A: strain B: though C: happiness D: realization E: understanding<n>Output:		<n><n>**Solution:**<n>There are six letters that follow D.<n>The first three letters have the initial word that follows them be EA or AE depending on how you choose to write them. Either E is going to be the starting letter and A is going to be the ending letter or A is the starting letter and E is the ending letter, either way an A or an E is the ending letter for any of these letters.<n>If we begin with the first letter, there are two options for where the final E or A might be.  In both cases, we will have to have a D at the beginning.<n>In case C it will be CAED<n>Incase D it will be DEDA<n>You will see that at least two options will come after any case, the D is always the end so when you come to the first four letters. It is already going to be a D or DED or CAED<n><n>When we move on to the fifth letter, we will have to add a new starting letter as there are no double initial letters. If we choose the E it will be CEDE, if we choose the D it will be DEED<n>The next letter can only come after a D or a DED (the end letter must be D) or CEDE or DEED depending on the starting letter chosen<n><n>Finally we will come to the last letter and only after the starting and ending letters, the sixth letter must be D.<n><n>**Ex.**<n>If you started with AE, it would have DEDA<n>If you started with EA it would be CEDE<n>**Solution**<n>We begin with A and so CEDE would be the last word, as we have D as the last letter,<n><n>We begin with E, CEED would be the last word as we have D as our end letter,<n><n>We can see that the solution would be CEDE or CEED<n><n>

The game ended at 6 pm and the students, leaving for opposite directions, were 6 miles away from their final destination at 6 pm. At the time the students left their seats, they had traveled 100 miles. The students leave the stadium and  arrive at their destination 30 minutes apart.  How long did the game last?<n>Output: Two students were at the football game. the game ended at 6pm.  The time spent at the game was 100/2=<<100/2=(75+35)/4>>(75+35/4) and the distance between the stadium and their homes was 6*2=<<6*2=(12+12)/4>>(12+12/4). So each student spent 45 minutes at the game. the distance traveled each way (6 * 2) = 12.  So their travel to their homes was 12*2=<<12*2=(24+24)/3>>(24+24/3).  Since each student left 30 minutes apart they each spent 24/3 =<<24/3=3/2>>3/2 minutes traveling time for a total travel time of (45+3/2)=<<45+3/5>>45+3/4.

How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Output: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>So the final answer is 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Output: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>So the final answer is 72<n><n>Input:The man set the cup on the table.  It didn't matter.   He didn't heave anything to put it on, and he lacked the what to balance it? Choices:  A: tenacity B: hands C: coaster D: skill E: breaking<n>Output:		A and E are incorrect because the cup did fall, albeit at a later time.  B and D are incorrect because the man had the what to balance the cup on, his table.  For the cup to tip over it needed to be removed, either on purpose or by accident.  C is the correct answer because he had the skill to balance the cup on the table but also the coaster to take away the what that would make the cup tip over. So the final answer is :C<n>

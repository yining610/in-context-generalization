In the same way that other games introduce learning through play, Math Blaster was created so that children could practice solving math problems. There were 5 types of problem cards used in Math Blaster. There were cards to help children practice addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and word problems with mixed operations (in order from easiest to hardest). The children began with addition and subtraction problems because those were the easiest. After solving these problems, they moved on to multiplication and division and finally word problems. The children could work on these in any order. If there was a problem that the children had already started and were not able to complete, they could then work on another problem. At the end of the day, if additional problems were left over, the children could either keep working on the problem cards that had been started or start on the new deck of cards. They could always choose to start on the easiest problem card types (the problems on addition and subtraction cards never count against a child), regardless of what the previous day\u2019s totals were. On any day, the children have the option to focus on one type of problem card (instead of working on other problem cards in addition). For example, if each", "answer": "B: in motion"}

Don't buy more than 12 clearance balloons because I know that I can fit that many in my party bag already.\" How many balloons do they need to buy?\nOutput: 90\n------\n```\n\n```\n  # The question mark represents the place where we need to insert code.\n  # The code must be in Python\n  # Test input:25\n  # Answer: 5\n```\n\n\n```python\n# 1st Answer\nn = int(input()) # number of people, from test input 25\n\nif n % 4 > 0:\n    print(\"Not Even\")\n\nelse:\n    print(\"Even\")\n```\n```\n\n```python\nif n % 5 == 0:\n    number_of_goats = n/5;\n    print(\"number of goats =\", number_of_goat)\nelse:\n    number_goats = n%5;\n    print (\"number of goat =\",number_goats)\n```\n\n```diff\n#1.\nnumber = int(input())\nnum_array = [x for x in range(4)]\n\nnum_array[0] = num+num_array[0];\nnum_array[-1] = num+num\n\nprint(num_array)\n\n#2.\nnum_array=[x for x in range (5)]\n\ncount =", "answer": "B: frustration"}

Instead, why not just ask your question in the [Code Review room](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/ask)?\n\nAnswer: The problem is you keep appending `string` objects that are either empty strings (empty arrays) or the number strings `0` `\"0\"`.  So you end up with a string object in the last item in each of your `list` objects that's 0 bytes long because it's a string object that has no values in it.\n\nYou should change your `createArray()` procedure to accept `int[]` objects or just make all the items in your `list` objects `int[]` objects -- I think that may help it a lot.\n\nIf you are going to do the `list` objects, you have the same problem if you try to append a list of `int` objects because you have to do an ugly `int[][]` array to do that and you know some of the items in that array will be empty arrays.\n\nSo, `int[][], int[][,]` doesn't seem to be your best choice for data manipulation here, and you have no choice but to convert your strings back to the integers you started with.\n\nIt's a bit of awkward design for strings and arrays of integers.\n\nComment: I've used strings as my list objects to try and allow for people without array indices to use them.  I could just as easily use ints.  Your advice on this issue is good to get it as close as we can to the original program specification, but not if I just use strings.  You really need all of your list objects to have ints...I just didn't think of that.\n\nComment: @drydreamer Yup.  And it does not matter *how* you create your list objects, but you have to be sure the data you put into your objects will actually be ints.\n\nComment: My apologies, I was being a bit dense when composing the question because I couldn't create the original program's", "answer": "A: eat grass"}

How many additional notes does he need if he wants to copy down 2x as many notes as Amy has?\nOutput:Let Danny's notes be x, and Amy's notes be 100. Since Danny has to copy 2x Amy's, let Amy have 4x notes (2x*2), and Danny have 9x notes. (2x*2 - (2x*2/2)) = <<2x*2-2x*2/1>>1 Since (2x*2) is a large number of notes, the rest can be neglected. To find the answer, we need to find the rest of the difference. In this case, (2x) is a negative number to the second power (2^-1), but we know 2 is a non-zero number, so we can divide the whole equation by 2. 1/2(2x)-(2x/2) = (1/2) x (2x) - (2x/2) - (2x)/2 = (((1/2)(2x)) - 1/2(4x)) - 2) = (2x - 12)/4 - 2 = (2x - (6x-1))/(4*(6-(2*(15))) = (2x - ((6/2)x - (2/6)) - 15) = (2x+15x/6 -26)/12(6-1) = (730x/26 - 26)/6 = (315x/6) - 42 = 269x/6 - 42 = (269/6) -", "answer": "C: kitchen"}

What would they charge the customer the third month if they had 2000 gallons of gas and 800 gallons  of electricity to be used each month?\nOutput:The customers first month bill would have a gas usage of 0, causing a bill of 30 dollars.\nThe second month the customers bill would have a gas bill of 2/gallon($2) * 2000 = $<<2*2000=1200>>1200 dollars\n\nWith the electric usage at 0 as well, the bill would be $15 dollars\n\nThe third month the gas usage is 2 gallons, so the gas bill would be 2/gallons * 2002 = $<<2*1=2>>2 dollars.\n\nThe electric usage would be 680 gallons, therefore the electric bill would be $680/(1200+680) = 0.68.\n\nTo find the total bill, take $0.68 + $126.34 + $128.95 = $152.07 dollars\nSo the final answers is 152.09\n\nInput: How much would a 5 mile-per-hour vehicle weigh if one mile of road would equal ten pounds?\nOutput:A 5 mph vehicle weighs ten times as much, so we can simply multiply by ten to find it's weight for each mile of road.\n5 * (10 lb) = <<5*10=50>>50 lb.\nSo 5 miles would weigh 500 lbs.\nSo the final result is 500\n\nInput : For many years, the US used the metric system of measurement to measure things.", "answer": "D: moving"}

{"idx": 44, "text": "B. Choices and Explanations\nA: Being too full from eating too much is likely to slow down your digestive process and increase the time between each mouthful as you try and adjust your position. After a long period of this it may result in a lack of digestion and cause food to stay in your stomach for longer. This may result in food being re-absorbed through the wall of your gut and entering the bloodstream, leading to the toxins being re-entered into the rest of your body. This can cause digestive problems, or even worse; fatty deposits in the arteries, leading to a heart attack\nB: One of the ways many cultures have tried to stop the progression of cancer or slow down it\u2019s growth rate is to reduce their dietary intake of fat to a minimum. Fat will lead to healthier weight control, and it is possible that one may be more active than normal, this may help strengthen muscles and improve immune system responses as it is possible that the cancer has triggered the immune system to slow down. Cancer cells require lots of sugar and nutrients to survive, if you starve cancer cells of glucose or food for several days, they may become starved.\nC: It could lead to various digestive problems as well as an increase of acid production in your gut. If the acid starts to rise towards your sphincter it may start to burn the esophagus which would result in acid reflux\nD: It could lead to dehydration which could lead to you becoming tired or weak, this could reduce your immune system response to pathogens such as viruses which cause illnesses\nE: This could lead to indigestion, if you eat too fast your food is more likely to slip from your mouth before it is fully digested. Digesting your food takes longer when you eat too much. The stomach has a muscular layer that churns food; this motion is called peristalsis, and it can be slowed if you eat too much overeating also changes the level of acid in your stomach leading to indigestion\nE\n\nInput: A restaurant prints the order of meals on a ticket that costs $1.

How much will each cook be paid for each cabbage, carrot, onion, and broccoli head prepared? Assume that each cook is paid $6/day.\nOutput: Since 6 cooks are available and 2 cooks are expected per day (every cook takes a day off every half week) and there are 6 types of vegetables, the total number of each vegetable available is 6/2 =<<6/2=3>>3.\nThe restaurant needs to buy a total of 3 extra each each head of cabbage, carrot etc.\nThe answer is $<<18*3=54/>$54 for each cook as each vegetable costs $1/head\nSo the final answer for each cook is $54.\n\nInput:The number of new passengers on each airline increases by one percent; the number of new passengers on any of the airlines is not greater than or equal to 5", "answer": "C: fly"}

The cost of each ride depends on its height, either in feet or 11 inches, as follows:\n\n15\n20\n15\n15\n12\nThe amusement park is owned by someone named Jack. Jack wants to know at what height he needs to charge $1 in order to make a ride. (If the ride costs $10, he must charge $1 per individual rider. If the ride costs $6, he must charge a minimum of $6.)\nOutput: The first ride costs $15, so at a height of exactly 15 feet, Jack needs to charge $1 to meet his minimum.\nThe second ride costs $20, so at a height between exactly 15 feet and exactly 20 feet, Jack needs to meet his minimum\nThe third ride costs $15 again, so at a height exactly between 15 and 30 feet, Jack does not need to meet his minimum. At over 30 feet, he must meet his minimum.\n\nThe fourth ride cost $12, so at a height 12 or more feet, Jack needs to reach the minimum. At below 12 feet, he does not need to meet the minimum.\nNow, Jack wants to charge one more ride where the height is at most 12 feet. At exactly 12 feet, Jack must meet the minimum, and this is where Jack's profit should be maximized.\nTo find this height, it is worth noting that Jack must be able to either reach the minimum or not in order to charge $1 at this height. So, if it cost $2 to reach 12 feet, where the price at 12 feet is $2, Jack's minimum would be reached at a height of 12 feet exactly.\nHence, Jack needs to charge a minimum of $2, which means that he cannot charge $1.\nThere is only so much space on the ride that Jack can give away.

The third is an electric car with the lowest cost of $30,000 but the highest range of 250 miles. For the fourth car you have to pay a $15 annual fee, for the fifth car you do not have to pay any annual fees. Which car is the lowest annual cost?\nOutput:The first electric car has the highest cost.  The cost for this type of car will be $40,020, which has 20 as a remainder.  Multiply 20 by 20% which is $4, which is the annual cost for this car.\nThe second electric car has the lowest cost, so subtract $35,019, which has a 1 as a remainder.  Which means the cost is $34,999 - 35,010 is 349 which is subtracted.  Multiply the cost 349, which is a remainder of 9, times the annual fee of 15.  $563 is the annual fee for the annual cost of $34999.\nThe third car is a normal car which does not have any taxes.\nThe fourth car costs $41,000 with a remainder of 14.  Multiply that remainder by the tax that is 1% which is $410.\nThe fifth car is free which has no annual cost of that.\nSo the annual cost will be $410+$563+$599-$14.

After 6 seconds, it has an average velocity of 40/6 = <<40/6=7>>7 km/h.\nIn 6 seconds it doubles its initial length because 6 is the first 2n-th number: (2*2^n+1)/(2n+1).\nHence, after 12 seconds it has a final length of 7^2 = <<40/4=20>> 20 km/h.\n\nIn 6 seconds, it increases its initial length by a factor of 2. Using Pythagorean theorem, after 6 seconds its final length is sqrt(9 * initial length * initial length).\nHence, in 18 seconds it had 2 sqrt(9) = <<2*sqrt(9)=2***>>2*2*2*2 km/h.\nSo 2*2*2 = 8 and the answer is 8.\nIt is a mistake to multiply with 2*2*4 because the initial length is 8.\nAfter a second of travel, the final length is sqrt((9 * initial length * (9 x initial length)) + initial length).\nIn 18 seconds, sqrt(initial length) = initial length *", "answer": "D: city block"}

The yellow line represents a single person walking at 1 block a minute.\nAs we can see, the yellow line passes over the red line after 2 minutes (60 seconds / 30 seconds per block.)\nSince each person is traveling at the same speed, the time for 4 persons to walk 40 blocks is 4 times 2 minutes.\nSo the answer is option 3. 40/4 = <<40/4=10>>10. Which rounds down to 10 minutes.\nMy reasoning is that it takes 2 minutes for a single person to walk 10 blocks. It takes 3 minutes for the 4 people to walk 40. So in my solution, I\u2019ll multiply 2 by 4 to get 8 which is how much time it takes for 4 people to complete 40 blocks.\nThe video explaining the solution:  https://www-youtube-com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/watch?v=jH-KUqYdWW4\n\nInput:In the 1970\u2019s, a group of college students wanted to protest a proposed construction on campus of an ugly, industrial building.

But a 30 year old shouldn\u2019t have a bike that goes 15 mph max, and also shouldn\u2019t weigh 800 lbs. For a 40 year old, 20 mph seems reasonable, as does 500 lbs. However, none of the current laws limit the speed of the bikes, but they do limit the weight of the heaviest adult model to 435 lbs.  What can be said about bike laws?\nOutput: Since the weight is the max, that's what'll be used as the limit. A 10 yr old bicycle limits 435 lb max. If we take out the 30 yr old one, which is less, it becomes 375 lbs. Then, we take out the 40 yr old which is less, and it becomes 400 lbs. The adult cyclist has a max of 435 l,  however, this does not include the weight of the actual bike itself.\nSo for each age group, there is a max weight (20 yrs, 260 lbs, 35 yrs, 300 lbs, 40 yrs, 350 lbs).

After 5 seconds, the one bird that started the fight has eaten the birdseed and is the winner. The second bird now has only 4 seconds left to eat the birdseed before its loser. If this fight goes on for a total of 60 seconds, which bird wins the most birdseed? Choices: 1) 2:3 2) 3:2 3) 4:1 4) 1:1 5) 5:0\nOutput: Since the cage has two birds, if one birds stays for 60 seconds = 120 seconds, there will be a total of 240 seconds of fighting.\n1:1 is the bird fight for 2:3 seconds. It will win 240-60 = 180 seconds of fighting time, and it wins 180/2 = <<180/2=90>>90 seconds of birdseed.\n4:1 is the bird fighting for 3:1 seconds. It wins 240-90 = 150 seconds, and so it wins 150/3 = <<150/3=50>>50 seconds of birdseed\nSince the two birds fight for a total of 50 + 90 = <<50+90=140>>140 seconds, the 2:3 wins the most birdseed.\nSo the final conclusion is that the 2:3 bird wins the most bird seed.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe hope this was enough to point you to a good start.

Jar Honey is the most popular among children for its easy accessibility and stickiness. Sticking to your fingers is an activity for children, often used at fairs\nTo make honey, you need three things: bees, a hive, and flowers. The farm market will always have more bees since these are agricultural animals who pollinate crops. Furthermore, the flowers will most likely come from the area around the market, so this honey is often referred to as \"locally grown\".\nSticking to your fingers could be considered the most childish (of the possible answers) in terms of how one would eat honey, so that is why it is the least recommended choice.\nLastly, jar honey is accessible and can be bought to your door, so there is no need to go all the way to the apiary.

If John's is 1.80 m, then we divide 1.80 by daughter's height. If we divide 1.75 by 0.90, It's 1.94. That means John's is 2 times her height and 2 - 1.80 is 0.10.

They have 8 trucks at their fleet. How many trips must they make to be able to ship all of the trucks to their destination?\nOutput: There are 8 trucks in the fleet. If each truck has a weight of 8 tons, it then holds 8 tons. A single truck can hold 8 tons so each truck holds 8 tons. With exactly 6 trucks they can ship 8 tons from 7 trucks. The 7 trucks plus one truck leaves 7 remaining trucks. By adding 8 tons to 7 trucks adds up to 15 tons, so the next truck can now hold 15 tons. And 15 tons + 8 tons adds another 23 tons. Adding 23 tons to 2 remaining trucks adds up 25 tons that can now be added to those two remaining trucks. And adding 25 tons to 2 trucks makes 27 tons.  Adding 27 tons to 2 trunks is now 1 extra ton.  So the total trucks needed to ship 6 trucks is 8+7+7+15+25.\nIf you add the digits of that number you get 3", "answer": "E: palpitations"}

For example, the year 2009 only had 27 days in August, but the year 2020 will have 28. So the 10 in 2010 adds a total of 13 days to the sum of the previous years.\nThe total number of days in the year is determined by the sum of a 3 digit number, which is 100+10+1.\nThe difference between the years is determined by the sum's last digit.\nSo as long as the last digit in the year is 0 or higher, the increase in the number of days will be determined by: 100+2d+1, where d is the difference between the years.

{"idx": 299, "text": "You can't have a deck of cards with out someone always winning, so that means that you only have the cards during the game and not during the shuffle, deal, and reshuffle.  You could call that period in between those times an interrupted time (when the queen is not there), and the shuffling time and deal time when the queen is there.  A deck of cards has a fixed number of cards,  number of aces,  etc. and so if all the cards come out of the deck, that means the shuffle time is over, and shuffle time is the time when you have all the cards.  Also note that there are times when the queen is out of the deck that are not interrupted, such as that you are dealing, but a playing time, when you have all the aces and other cards.  This means that only a set time can be played, no extra time for the queen to reappear, as a shuffle time, when the queen could reappear and be not in the deck.   Since the question does not mention that the shuffle is interrupted then there would be no queen at that time, (there are no other interrupted times during a card game)\nSo, the answer is that the queen can be on the deck for shuffle, deal, reshuffle, but it cannot be on the deck during playing time.\nSo the final is  B: england\n\nInput: Jabu wants to give each of his five sons a 25-milliliter bottle of perfume as a gift for Christmas.

If you make this car that runs on hydrogen, how much money will the manufacturer make on each unit of this car?\nOutput:Fuel efficient, small car has small feet. Because of the small feet, it can't fit regular families. So the average family can't buy the car. But the car's efficiency is high so that gives rebate. It is 20% so one unit of the car produces 20% of the price.

After that the workers only did 70 percent of the total work.\nHow much less work did each worker do after 1 additional worker was hired?\n\nOutput: Every day, each worker does 50% of its work.\nSo each worker does 0.5 of the total work. \nAfter the owner realized that the workers were so fast, he hired a total of 12 new workers so that the total would now do 60 percent (0.6) of the work.\n\nFor every four new workers the total new workers are 1/6th of the old workers, which means that every old worker should be 1/6th lesser of their work now. But this doesn't go the entire way.\nInstead, for every 1 old worker there's 3 new workers, so the total new workers are about ~1.5 times the old workers. So we can say that 4 old workers equal 1+1/6*6 new workers, which is about 1.5 times bigger.\n\nSo let's say if every worker did 0.5 of their work,\n\n50% of 0.5 = 0.025\n\n60% of 0 = 0.2\n\n70% of 0= 0.7\n\nThese mean that instead of having 0.02 in its total daily work, each worker now has 0.02/.6 = 0.0333333 recurring, and instead of having 0, each worker now has another 0.2 / 0.33 = 0.6 recurring to its daily work.\n\nSo the original worker does ~0.6 * 0.02 = 0.012 times its original work, and therefore if its original work was 0.02, which would mean it originally did 2/100 of its original work.\n\nSo if its", "answer": "B: heart attacks"}

Winter Summer Spring Autumn\nOutput: Fall\nAutumn is the season between summer and winter. It contains both a rainy season and a dry season, making it ideal for both diseases and bacteria that thrive in wet conditions and bacteria that require warm weather to survive.\nWinter is the season between autumn and spring. It is very dry and gets very little rain, which makes it very dangerous for bacteria to stay in a large enough number to spread.\nSummer is the season between spring and autumn. Bacteria tend to thrive in warm and damp environments, much like the environment that allows them to thrive in the autumn season.\nAs a result, there is very little possibility of an outbreak in the summer season because the warm weather in summer dries out much of the atmosphere, allowing the air to have low humidity, which can dry out bacteria and make them unviable, and it is also very unlikely that it would happen during a time of year with less rainy days because the weather is warmer and makes precipitation less likely.\nSo the answer is fall\n\nInput: What is A + B?

What is the total number of eagles that must kill snakes that are lying curled up in circles for 20 years before one of them has to kill 2 snakes?\nOutput: A snake, seeing an eagle, immediately curls up in a circle.  It is immediately killed by the eagle.  So in the first year every snake is killed by one eagle, and no eagles are killed.  If we set this as our case, then in the next year, there will be exactly one eagle left; then in the following year, there would only be this one left eagle, and once again, no snakes (if this is confusing to understand, then imagine counting off years in your head). So every year, there will be either one or no eagles; which is to say, there will always be either an eagle or no eagle. So every year there will definitely be an eagle, and the number of eagles does not change.\nSo the total number of eagle-years is 20, the total number of years that the snake was killed by an eagle is 20, and the total number for which there were both snakes and eagles (so that neither the snakes nor the eagles would die) is 1.  So in 1 + 20 + 1 = 22 eagle years, there are a total of 20 snakes killed, and we just have to make sure that the snakes are only killed in those 22 years.\n\n\nSo the sum we have to find is the sum of all those numbers; in other words, it is 20 + 20 + (22 - 1).\n22 - 1 gives us one, meaning that there was one year that both the", "answer": "B: wristwatch"}

When the shop gets at least 30 of the same kind, they sell them at a discount: 2 lollipops for $2. If the shop has 30 lollipops, what was the selling price of the original 30? (This is part of a series of questions).\nOutput: If you can buy 2 for $2, the price of each lollipop is $1.50.\nFor the discount, you buy 2 lollipop for $2, so the price of 1 lollipop is 1/2.5 = <<1/2.5=0.4>>0.4 dollars\nSo the final price for 30 lollipoop is 30 * 0.4 = <<30*0.4=12>>144 dollars\nTherefore, it was $12 for the 30.\nSo the correct choice is $12.00.\n\nInput: In 1991, an international company announced that it had uncovered what could be an important new mineral mine.

One couple left their hotel and had dinner on their way home. How many rounds of golf did the two couples play?\nOutput: The total stay time is 27 hours.\nEach time after one couple arrives, the guests can play 2 rounds of Golf.\nBecause the couple left their hotel after dinner, 2 hours later, they can play 2 more rounds of golf.\nTherefore, the two couples can play 2+2+2+2=<<+2+2+6>8 rounds of golf. \nSince there were 2 couples, they play 4 rounds of golf.

He plans to have 30 guests at his Halloween party, and there is no way he can give each person the same amount of candy, so he places the candy in random order and the guests are given 2 candies each. All of the boxes are the same size and all of the guests know, except one guest, that there is 30 different types of candy in the boxes (for simplicity, this can be assumed to be a standard number set like the set for 30 day months, where we can assume each candy is represented once, with replacements being the same in order). What is the probability (assuming some other unknown things which are irrelevant to the question, or are impossible given the context of the question) that the order that the guest selected by using the random order of candy and getting 2 candy from each box.\nOutput: Each box can be assumed to have a representative candy, and we assume he will select the candy in random sequence, each time choosing at random each box.\nWe're trying to calculate the probability that the box (with the representative candy) picked by any of the guests is selected, without the guests being aware of the replacements. This means that whatever candy he picks, then with a high probability, that box will not be the one selected, because once the order of the boxes are given to each guest, he will skip the box he selected, so that box will not be selected. So the probability that the box chosen by the guest, which happens to have the representative candy, is the box that is not picked by the other guests, is the probability that this box not picked by any different guests, and this is.\nThe total number of possibilities that no guest selecting the box which has the representative candy in it is\nThe total number of candies is the number of boxes times the number of types of candy that exist, where the total number of boxes is 80 and that total number of types is 30, so this is 80x30 or 3200, since the type of candy will be the same number as the amount present, and there will be", "answer": "D: evaluating"}

Who paid more? Choices: a: Mary b: Bob c:  Mary and Bob\nOutput: Mary paid $18 for her whole total bill\nBob paid $24 for his entire bill\nThis problem can be solved in more than one way.  One way is to find the greatest common factor between each bill.  Bob's bill is 6+7+$15=$38,  while Mary's bill is $2+$4+$2+$18=$36.  Therefore, Mary pays less than Bob.\nAnother way is to find the difference between each bill.  Mary's bill is ($2+$4+$2-$18)$18,  while Bob's bill is ($6+$7)($7-$5)-$24.  Mary's total is $18, as listed previously, while Bob's total is $24.\nSo, Bob's bill is higher by 6.\n\nInput:Alice makes about 45% of her salary.

What number do they add?\nOutput: Let's call the total number N.  Suppose you halve the quantity of apples, how many apples do you have?  Well, if you subtract one from the middle, you get N/2.  So 10 is N/2.\nSuppose you double the quantity of apples again.  What happens to N when you double N?  Well, N is just the sum of all the apples in the bin, so it will double if you add the same amount of apples to each side.\nHence N = N/2 * 2 = N/2*N/2.\nThe right hand side of the equation is 2^2, so it is the same as 2^3, i.e. 8.  Therefore the middle bin contains 8 apples.\nHowever, we still must find the initial number of apples, for which we set 8 equal to N and solve:\n8 = N/2 * N/2.\nSolving we get N = 16 apples.\nSo, the number to add is 16 apples to the top and bottom.\nSo the final answers is 16\n\nInput:It takes K minutes to make 1 loaf of bread.

For example, 71 is an odd number because its last two digits - 11 - are odd.

You laugh at your friend because her logic is flawed in the following manner. First, Chinese is easier than English. Second, therefore, learning Chinese can only take you at most twice as long to become as fluent as English. Both statements are false. The first statement is false because Chinese speakers have to learn English to go to an English speaking country for a job, and therefore not everyone wants to be able to speak Chinese. Second, the statement is false because the amount of time you spend learning a language determines how likely it is that you can become fluent. The longer you spend learning Chinese compared to English, the greater your chances of becoming fluent in Chinese. Your friend is only correct with the following logic: If you want to learn a language whose speaking requirements will make it more difficult for you to get a job, learn Chinese. To help you memorize this, use the following mnemonic: Chinese is good if you want to get rich. Then you will become rich, but you will only become Chinese.\nOutput:The answer is A: bus driver\n\nInput:Jill went on vacation to Mexico.

The first sandwich requires 7 eggs, so I have 23 eggs left over, and I still have a dozen eggs. How many eggs did I buy in all?\nOutput: You first bought 3 dozen eggs (36 eggs), the first sandwich required 7 eggs, so you need 7/23, or 0.308 eggs, to prepare the first sandwich. You have 36 eggs minus the 0.305 eggs, so you have 35.705 eggs left over. You have one dozen eggs which, in this case equals to 12 eggs, so you have one dozen minus 12 eggs, or 11 eggs extra in your purchase. Therefore, the number of eggs you bought is 36 + 0.30 + 11 = <<36+0.30+11=47>>47 eggs.\n\nInput: Dana and Emma are in a competition to see who can read the most books this summer.

How long will the competition last if they both keep reading at the same pace?\nOutput: Emma reads 20 books per 5 weeks, which can be simplified by the fraction 4/1. Since we want to find the average number of books in a week, we take the numerator and divide by the denominator: 4/1/ 5; 4 books/week. Dana reads 200 books per 10 weeks, or 200/10. Dividing by the denominator, we find that Dana reads 2 books/week. Multiplying the fractions, we get 4*2=<<4*2=8>>8 books per week. Hence, the total number of books the two girls will read is 4+8=<<4+8=12>>16 books.\n\nInput: It can snow 1 to", "answer": "A: fast food restaurant"}

So John would be staying at a hotel.\n\nInput: Every school day, a student takes 4 classes and the school is 4 miles away (each direction), so for a typical day, she walks 8 miles. Assuming walking speed isn't variable, how many miles would she walk in a year?\nA: If her school is 4 miles each way, and she takes 4 classes each day, then her total mileage one-way is: 4 x 4 x 5 days/week x 10 months x 52 weeks/10 months = 1172,000 miles\nB: If her school is only 2 miles, then her total mileages one-way is: (2x4x5x10x10x52) / 4,000, that's 86,325 miles\n\nSolution: The question doesn't differentiate between the student's walk both ways or walk only one direction, and doesn't mention how often the classes change. Consider the following situation:\nThere are five classes, each of which goes in one direction (eg, one goes north & the other goes south), and the student takes two classes every day. This student would be walking 5 miles each day. However, the 20 total miles would change to 10, as the student doubles the distance in both directions. Walking for 20 miles a day for five days a week for 10 months is 500 days. However, if the classes change, they change on a different day each week. Thus, the walk distance would be 750 mpd for 52 weeks. In both cases, the total drive distance is 1,175,000 meters, so the answer to \"A\" is incorrect. Answer to \"B\" is incorrect as well. Her average walk distance per day is 8 mpd, but 8 mpd in both directions is 4 miles, so the total distance is 8 mpd. If the student takes classes both ways, this will change to 16 mpd, and the drive distance becomes 7,825,000 m", "answer": "E: motel"}

Choices:  A: pleasure B: accident C: get somewhere D: hurt E: falling down<n>Output:		None (this was not a question)<n><n>Note: No test data was given, and no questions were asked.<n>### Solution<n><n>#### Tapanga and Coreys problem.<n>If we want to solve this we want to find the difference.<n><n>$$d=66-48$$<n><n>Next we want to find what number Corey has to add to it so that they both have the same number of candies. So we want to subtract coreys number from the original candy stash and subtract the 8 candy from the difference.<n><n>Thus<n>$$newDiff=-8 = d - 8$$<n><n>Now we redo the diffrerence equation<n>$$<n>8 +d=66.   -> 9 +d=74 -> d = 67  -> difference is d=67 now we want newDiff so just subtract 8 from both<n>$$<n>newDiff=8 - 28.9   -> 19.09 ->newDiff=19<n>$$<n><n>Thus we now have this<n><n>66 - 8 = 58(This is also part of Tapangas answer. She has 58 candies.<n> <n>$$<n>58 + 8 = d<n>$$<n>We now have $d+8= 66 and we substract 8 to get 58 once again (28.9)<n><n>We now have these things:<n><n> 58 + 78 = 210<n><n>This is not the answer though. All 58 are not eaten. Tapanga only has 58. So we subtract 58 from 210 and we get 152 (58, then subtract 58 from remaining). It is not the answer but this is the best method so far.<n><n>#### Riding bike through rough terrains problem.<n>Nothing I understood the question to see in answer choices if I get it?<n><n>

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: 29<n><n>Input:Where do I put my coffee mug after it's dry? Choices:  A: shelf B: desktop C: cabinet D: kitchen E: cupboard<n>Output:		B<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Write a code using Python, that will accept a series of strings as input and then prints the smallest common prefix of all strings.<n><n>Examples:<n>> input:abcdefghijklmnopqrstuv<n>> output: abcd<n>> input:abbccdd<n>> output: a<n>> input:abba<n>> output: ab<n>>......<n>### Explanation:<n>The task required me to use the following built-in Python libraries:<n>  - string<n>  - input<n>  - print<n>  - if-else<n><n>Sample input:<n>  # input the following line. It will be represented as a series of characters in the program, that will be stored in a variable called string. (In this case, we call it str for short.)<n>  > abcdefghijklmn<n><n>Sample output:<n>  # use the if-else statement, and store the smallest possible prefix in the value of suffix<n>  str.startswith(str)<n>  # the.startswith() function will take the prefix, and compare it with the first part, and see if it matches. If it does, it returns True, otherwise returns False.<n>  # if the prefix matches the first part, you're done, and don't need to run anymore comparisons.<n>  # if prefix match is not true, then we need to compare with the rest of the string, (as it will be true if they equal)<n>  str.startswhile<n>  # returns the string when the prefix matches the first string, and saves an empty string if not<n>  str.split()<n>  # once you have a separated string in a list, you can compare each part of the list.<n><n><n>### Explanations:<n>The main thing that is required is you must first convert your string to a list by splitting at the first space, and then you have two strings which you can compare with a while loop. If the prefix of the string is equal to the original string (the first part), then you're done, otherwise, you need to use the comparison again after another list iteration.<n>

Choices:  A: house B: den C: family room D: wood E: floor<n>Output:		A<n><n><n><n><n>### Approach:<n><n>First we need to find the total number of candies: candies of Tapanga + candies of Corey = 66.<n>Now, to find the difference of candies, we simply subtract the number of candies of Corey from total number of candies, here Tapanga will have 8 more candies. So, Tapanga - Corey = 6 - 29. Now, Tapanga - (Corey - Tapanga) = 6 x 29 / Tapanga. So, 6 x 27 / Tapanga = 114 x 27 / 114 = 4 = difference.<n><n><n>### Output:<n>To find Candies of Corey: Tapanga (6 + 8) - Corey = 9, since Tapanga had 9 more candies.<n><n>### What are the next steps:<n>- We can generalize the above solution where we need to find difference between values<n>- We can generalise the above solution using variables

What path will they choose? There are 2 choices in every situation described in the riddle below. You must be able to count up to the number 2 so make sure that you know all numbers that it can be written as words. <n>The first choice is to go straight.<n>The second choice is to turn right.<n>There will always be two choices, so that the person can decide which way to go.<n>You can never go forward twice.<n>You can never turn twice.<n>If a letter is used more than once with each occurence having a different number (one to nine only), these numbers will be added together to give a total for this letter. For example, "R" being used twice, once with the value "2" and once with the value "6" would add to "8" which would form the total value of "R."<n><n>Output: Right <n><n>***Note:*** If someone makes a logical choice you must write down all of the possible choices there were to choose from. For example, if a person says "I am going to the store," you must write "Store" as an option, even if "store" is a logical, obvious choice. The same applies to every riddle. Please make sure you always have a logical explanation for the answer that you choose.<n><n>Input: There is something in this building that has two eyes but cannot see.

The marbles will race in a loop. Each player throws 2 marbles from their base onto the playing field. Their marbles will race 10 times, after which the game resets and the players throw again. As they speed around the playing field the players make a game of it by changing lanes and throwing marbles in a curve. The marbles only return to their base if they are caught in a game-breaking spin at any time. Their score is based upon the number of marbles they return as a team to base as well as the number caught in their opponent’s base. The players will throw one marble at a time and the game will continue until all marbles in play are caught or return safely to a marble’s base (that is, 1 marble per marble). The marble with the most scores after the 20th throw will be declared the winner and take home the prize that comes with first place.<n><n>I.e. a score of 5 marbles in base + 4 marbles caught is a score of 9<n>For the player in second place, a score of 9 marbles in base +1 marble caught = 10<n>The score of the 3rd place marble is 19<n><n>The score of marble #4, if it caught any other marble(s) would be 6 (score of the 4th marble, caught in the 1st or 3rd place marbles).

Choices:  A: injury B: death C: playing uno D: coma E: falling down<n>Output:		D<n><n>### Instruction: Answer only the following questions.<n><n>### What problem is the author trying to solve?<n>The author is trying to create a text based game where the user inputs commands to interact with the character (candy), such as ‘eat’ ‘give’, ‘play’.<n><n>### Who are the people/groups who are affected by the problem?<n>The audience will be kids. The game is designed so that kids can enjoy the experience of being a candy.<n><n>### How is the problem different from other similar problems?<n>This is a unique project in that this experience is very different from the games out there in the commercial market.<n><n>### Are there any similar problems from other fields that may impact the outcome of this problem? How are they similar or different?<n>One area I think we will have to be careful in developing our game is making sure the user does not have the option to hurt or kill the candy. The target audience for our game is kids, and this is not something that realistically would make sense. As this is an interactive text based game, our target audience could be more wide-ranging - for example, an older person who may be struggling to adapt to the new digital technology will be able to be helped as they learn how to use the digital technology. The game is a teaching tool that can help people learn how to use technology, and is a way that kids can play within a safety zone.<n><n>### Is this a problem that should be tackled in the context of this project?<n>Yes, definitely. The way in which the game was designed with text made people able to connect with the characters on a deeper level. This is important because, although we are programming a game, we are also thinking of the humans that will play and interact with it.<n><n>### Does the topic or problem address learning objectives for the class?<n>There has so far been a fair amount of learning centered around Python. My classmate and I have been developing different code, but we have both had to learn how to deal with a fair amount of different tasks in the game. These tasks include building a menu system using pygame that was easy for the characters to understand, and also how to use certain commands such as.say and.talk to interact with the characters within Python.

If by 2007 the world record of the speed of the wind is 197 km/hour but in 2060, the world record is 199 km/hour, at what speed is the wind moving after 100 years? <n><n>Solution: The top speed in 1931 was 250 km per hour. In 2060 it is 199 hours per hour, if in 2007 it was 197 km per hour, it must be less than 2060-197 in 2061, because the time cannot jump forward. In mathematics, subtracting the two times, we take the smaller number which is equal to 250-2060.<n><n><n><n>Question 2: If by 2060 the wind speed is at 199 km per hour, if the present record of the wind speed is at a rate of 197 in 10 years time, then what speed is the wind supposed to get by 1930 in 100 years time with respect to the average speed in the present day?<n><n><n><n>

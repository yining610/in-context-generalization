{"idx": 63, "text": "B\n\n### A\nHey there! I'm guessing this is your first Hour of Code experience and that you just finished \"Turtle Art for Beginners!\"  What a great start!  I'll now teach you about functions, how they are used, and then I will challenge you with solving the following problems.\nTo begin, let's learn about functions.  Functions are snippets of code designed for a specific job within a program or application.  In many cases, functions are pieces of code designed to be reused.  This enables a developer to write code once, and then have that code used over and over again in a number of different programs.\n**Functions in the Arcade:**  \nIn the arcade, we have some great games to test your skills!  For a more in depth tutorial, you should head over to the Hour of Code tutorial in Khan Academy to learn about Functions there too!  Now though, to get you started, let's explore some games that make good use of functions:\n- **Space Invaders**:  You are the space ship zipping around dodging aliens from behind.  The aliens change their location constantly, and you shoot them.  Which function makes this game more fun?\n\tA:  the function to shoot the aliens B:  the function to avoid shots from enemies by moving the space ship\n- **Space Ship Shooter**:  You maneuver your little spaceship around the screen and shoot aliens with lasers.  At the bottom, the game will show you your score after each successful shot.\n\tA:  Lasers shooting the space ish B:  showing the score at the end of each shot\n- **Clock Pals**:  This adorable space invaders-like game is perfect for kids.  The invaders are cats!  Each one has a different time on them.  The job of the program is to put one on each space on the clock where the time reads the right time.\n\tA: using a function to determine what time is on the invaders B: using a switch function to find the time the invader has on it\n- **Invasion of the Killer Scary Spiders**:  You control a monster truck and are asked to wipe out all of the aliens.

If we look at choices D, E, and F, we can't really say that the answer to them is A. If you choose D or E, what are the chances of having the SAME name as someone in your family? Exactly 0. If we choose F, what are the chaces of having the same brains as someone in your family. That is, unless you go by the 'identical twins' definition of 'family'. This question is also flawed because if we look at the definition of 'family', it would involve an intimate relationship between the individuals.

If there are no quarters above dollar in the collection, and there are no odd amounts of dimes, how many dimes are in her hand?\n\nInput: You can see that the amount of coins are $1.75, we can get that sum using a modulo. That method needs us to understand this formula a bit more. First lets understand what a modulo function does.\n\nWe have this 13 quarters. Lets get the 13 by first understanding that 13 is equal to 4*3. Let us take 3 dimes and multiply the result by 3 which will be equal to 0.9, so 10 quarters. Lets understand what 3 means here. \n\nThis 3 means we are taking 3 coins, and the 3 will be the dimes. \n\nNow what if this was 3.51? What do I mean by this?\n\nI will explain this with an example. let us first consider a function that does not have the mod value, but we simply take in the same variable to represent the mod and we get the result as expected. \n\nFirst input an example with the function int() which is the Integer function. \n```javascript\nlet myVar= 13, intMyVar = int(myVar);        \nalert(intMyVar); = 13 ```\nHere we are simply taking in a var and applying an int function to it which is what will happen if there were a mod there. \n\nNow lets see a new method with a mod function. \n\n```javascript\nlet modVar = 13, \n    modMyVar = mod(modVar,8);                 \nalert(modMyVar); = 5 ```\n\nNotice how it does a mod value to the number you gave. Lets break the mod myVar down and see what it did. It simply took in myVar of being 13, and the function it used was mod which does the Modulo.

{"idx": 534, "text": "A\n\n#### Explanation:\n\nWe first divide the price of a nut by the price of a dried fruit. Let's say the price of a nut is $12 and the price of a drench fruit is$8, that gives us a division of 12/8 which will give us a solution of 15 and we can plug that into the solution, it now reads $15. The answer now becomes $56.\n\n#### The second problem\n\nBy plugging 1,080, it results in 4 and by now using plugging 15 it results in 9 so by simply taking 9*1*1 we get 9, which is the answer.\n\n#### The third problem\n\nWe first subtract the original price of the fuel from the new price of the fuel, the answer which we plug into the problem is 430, this leaves us with a division of 430/200 then plugging 430/4250 we get 0.09 and by now plugging 200 we get 9.\n\n#### The fourth problem\n\nFirst we are given the range of the whole problem in the question from which we can find the ratio of two numbers, first we can plug in the denominator which is 300 which allows us to find the value of the ratio, so the denominator would have to be 3 and the ratio is 2/3, therefore by plugging this information and the information we are already given we multiply the ratios which gives us 2*(2/3) which gives us 4 and the second part is 2/3*12, which gives us 6 because each stone is equal to 12.\n\n#### The fifth problem\n\nFirst we use the fact that the value each person fills the truck and using the information about the value of each truck and the fact that there are 400 trucks we can find the answer is simply by dividing 3 by 60, by plugging 60 we get zero and the value we get for the answer is the total number of trucks which would be equal to 400.\n\n#### The sixth problem\n\nThe first step we do would be to find the solution for the first part in which we use the multiplication model to find the solution it", "answer": "D: train station"}

How many words start with the letter \"b\"?\nOutput: 10\n\nSolution: The given word should be written in lowercase to allow the solution to work.\nI think this question is trying to ask for the number of unique 6-letter words (letters are only lowercase) that start with b. \nI thought of a solution using a for loop, but it was a very clunky solution.\nMy for loop solution is below.  The problem with this solution is that it iterates through every position (a[letter], b[letter], c[letter], d[letter], e[letters], f[letter]) which is a total of 6 positions.  This means that the loop will iterate through a total of 6.2 billion combinations.\nThe solution I came up with iterates through the two first letters only.  It first checks if a[letter] starts with b.  If not, it loops through the other letters and adds those to a list of words that contain b.  \nIf the a[letter] starts b, it moves onto checking letters a and b of word2 in list1.  \nIf a[letter] doesn't start with b, we cannot use b, so check if b is one of the letters of word1.  If it is, we can use it, otherwise, b is not used.\n    Input: You can make 188 4-letter words with the letters abcde with two repetitions and two occurrences of f.

For the sake of simplicity, consider the first problem in the set.\n\nYou can set them as two variables, where $x$ is the number of kilograms and $y$ is the number of dollars. Then, by plugging in the original problem, find $P(x,y)$ (the amount that Adam spent) and $Q(x,y)$ ($x\\cdot y$), plug in $x=3$ and $y=12$ to find the dollar value of it in the original problem. You're supposed to get $56$. And then use $y$-intercept form to find the $x$-intercept. Then, plug in $x=0$ to find the intercept when $y$ is equal to $1$. And then divide $P(x, y$ into $Q(x, y)$ to find the price of one of the nuts.\n\nYou can also", "answer": "D: relaxation"}

For example, 814868 would be divisible by 4,8, and 68. If an odd number is not divisible by 4 then any 4 digit number that is formed using its digits can not be divisible by 3. Thus, 1934818 would not be divisible by it. Since 8 is not divisible by three and the last digits of 68 are divisible by both three and eight, this number can be divided by 48.\n\n```python\n# Input: The number 129 is divisible by 8\n#Output: True\ndef is_divisible129(digit):\n\tif digit>=48:\t\treturn digit % 48 == 0\n\telif digit%4 ==0: return False\n\telse:\t\t\treturn True\n\ndigit = int(input())\ndigit = digit * 1", "answer": "C: have knowledge"}

The inductive hypothesis is if $P$ is true for $n$, then it is true for $n+1$. Prove. For $n$, the statement says that, if there is some set $S$, then there are exactly $a$ elements in $S$. For $n+1$, the statement says the same thing: if there is some set, then there are exactly $2a$ elements. So it is true for $2$ and for all integer $n>0$. The only way to be wrong is if the statement fails for some values of $n, k$, but nothing in the statement indicates there should be. So, $P$ is true.\nOutput:  Yes\n\nInput:The answer is three. The first statement is that the length of one of the sides is twice the length of the other, so we can get by this statement that the ratio of the lengths of the two sides is $2:1$. Similarly, if the ratio of the lengths is $2:1$, you can conclude that the two sides are congruent. To get the answer from here, you can multiply by the lengths of the two non-parallel sides and then divide this by the length of one of them. Since the lengths of the sides are the lengths of the sides of a triangle, the answer can only be three.\nOutput:  No", "answer": "D: train station"}

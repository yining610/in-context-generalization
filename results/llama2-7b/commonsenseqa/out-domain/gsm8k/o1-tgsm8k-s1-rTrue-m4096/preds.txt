Choices:  A: shirt pocket B: calligrapher's hand C: inkwell D: desk drawer E: blotter<n>Output:		When writing with a fountain pen, ink can get on fingers and clothes. Inkwells are made of wet sand. They provide extra ink when fingers need it, but the wet sand absorbs some of the ink. When the inkwell gets dry the paper can be ruined if the ink is too blotchy. The paper needs to be kept wet by filling the inkwell with fresh wet ink. To avoid having wet ink on calligrapher' hands, a blotter is placed on the desk. One side of the blotter is damped to absorb ink. This provides extra ink when fingers reach for it, but still prevents ink from blotching the paper. The blotter is made of clean, dry cotton.  The cotton blotter absorbs extra ink from the fingers when needed. The wet side of the blotting paper is kept wet at all times by dipping the blotting paper, holding it, and pressing it to the top of the inkwell, where the page meets the tabletop. The page needs to stay wet to avoid blotchy ink.<n>In the morning, the page underneath the inkwell needs to stay wet too. So, the blotter needs to be damped. To avoid blinking ink, an inkwell is needed. So the answer is B, a calligrapher' hand.<n><n>Input: What do you call a person who writes?

That means if both objects have the same temperature, they are warm together because they are not to far from each other.<n>So to make it simpler: What was hot was hotter than what was warm.  Since we don't know what was hot or what was warm, what matters here is that we know the answer is hot is hotter.<n>

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Mary had 89 stickers.  She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: Mary added a total of 7 stickers/page * 6 pages= <<7*6=42>>42 stickers to the 6 other pages.<n>In total, Mary added 3 large stickers + 42 stickers = <<3+42=45>>45 stickers to her journal.<n>Since she started with 89 stickers, she now has 89 - 45 = <<89-45=44>>44 stickers left.<n>So the final answer is 44<n><n>Input:Joe suffered many consequences from stabbing a stranger to death.   Among them, the family of the victim did something to him. What was that? Choices:  A: knife wounds B: buy a gun C: bleeding D: jail time E: law suit<n>Output:		The correct answer is D: jail time. The question gives all the consequences besides jail time, but jail time is a natural consequence of stabbing someone to death.<n>For the same reason, the family of the victims did something to him, Joe would serve some time in jail due to the consequences of his crime.<n><n>Input: Which of the following statements is true?  Choices:A: The number of minutes between 8:30 and 8:38 is the same as the number of minutes between 9:43 and 10:25. B: The time between the 12th minute and the 40th minute is the same as the time between the 5th minute and the 29th minute. C: The time between 15:02 and 15:39 is the same as the  time between 15.01 and 15:40. D: The time between 8:35 and 8:47 is the same as the second half of the time between 8:54 and 9:43. E: The time between the second half of the 39 minute block and the second half of the minute block is the same as the difference between 12 minutes and 20 minutes.<n>Output: Statement A is the correct answer. Minute is a standard measurement. In terms of standard time intervals, a statement comparing the hours to the minutes has a fixed ratio of 59:60 = <<59/60>>0.98444444<n>While a statement comparing the minutes to the hours is variable. The statement comparing the minutes to another statement using the minutes does not have a fixed ratio, and thus such comparison is not valid.<n>The same principle can be applied to all statements involving standard time intervals, except for the 45th minute.<n><n>Input: The average rainfall for the month of February for the past 20 years has been 5 inches.

The only wildlife refuge in the area is on the san juan islands in puget sound.<n>Answer to B: An eagle can be seen if you are in a tall pine tree. If you go to a national park in the Rockies you might have better luck at seeing one in open country. <n><n>Notes:<n>The bald eagle is the national flying bird of the U.S. It's known for its white head and tail feathers, and its body is colored sea-green and brownish-gold. They eat fish and prefer water-bodied fish over others since they are fishers. They mate for life and live about 30 years. Bald eagles mate when they are about 2 years old. The female lays the eggs and incubates them, while the male delivers food for the chicks. It takes them a year to be adults and fly. They are very aggressive in protecting their territory.<n><n><n><n><h3>How to use this site</h3><n>*Click the "Click to Solve" box in the left sidebar to open the box.<n>*Click the drop down box under the "Enter your answer here" box to choose which type (type and mode) of question you want to answer.<n>*Click the "enter your answer" to submit your answer or click "reset" in the "Enter your answer" box to start over. <n><h2><n>**Type**<n>![](https://github.com/katya-kamensky-dev/katya-hackathon/blob/master/instructor%20notes/instructor%3Akamersky/images/question-type1.PNG "question type 1")<n>![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-instructor-64b588 "instructor")![](https://img.youtube.com/hub/js.png)<n>	<n>*Input: Mary had 341 stickers.

The word "dumb" is an adjective, and a lot of people think of dumb as a negative adjective. It has nothing to do with whether or not we think about being smart.  In fact, it can be considered that both "C" and "E" are good for their personalities, such as "A" or "B".<n>Let's also consider another sentence. "You're so stupid" has nothing to do with "stupidity", and it means that you have good personalities even if you are stupid.<n>Therefore, if "A" has nothing to do as a personality, "B" has nothing to do and is a negative personality, and "C" has a neutral personality. So both the "B" and "C" are used to express personalities, and "E" has nothing to do. And "D" doesn't mean stupidity, but means that the person can be dumber than A and B are.<n><n>Input: A caravan is a group of people, and people have a caravan when they are walking, right?

Choices:  A: ocean B: symphony C: band D: music store E: music shop<n>Output:		Since we are only dealing with stringed instruments and there is no drum in the list of strings, we know we do not have a drum-based ensemble of musicians. Instead, we have string players.<n>By process of elimination, we can exclude ocean (cannot see cello), symphony (cannot see strings), band (a string ensemble), and music store (a venue) so we only have Music Shop.<n>So the answer is music shop<n><n>Instruction:Answer the following 6 multiple choice questions.<n><n>Input: If a pencil costs 0.25,a eraser costs 0.60 and paper costs 0.50, does a 0.40 eraser cost more or less than a 15 cent pencil?

He had trouble telling it from what? Choices:  A: reality B: imagination C: dreamworker D: nightmare E: awake<n>Output:		When we sleep we do not have access to our cognitive brain capacity that we use during waking hours.  We use a dormant part of our brain that has more access to our untamed primitive thoughts and emotions. This makes it nearly impossible to tell our own dreams from what is actually happening to us,  or whether the person who is speaking to us is awake or we are in a dream.  Even the part of our consciousness that controls us from being awake all night seems to take a vacation when we are dreaming. That is why we often have a dream that feels so much realer than it is.<n><n>You’re on the run in the middle of a hurricane. You come across a house. You look through a window and see two people sitting in the front of the house chatting. The window has the exact same view as if you were standing in the front and looking out the window. The people are as real and lifelike as if they were sitting on your couch. Do they exist?<n><n>Input:Straight away you could figure out that they must have a video camera pointed right at them. Otherwise they are on tv or somehow projected or some other magic that gives you an illusion. But that means that a person or a computer is able to create a representation of them that is so similar to what they would really look and act like that it would be indistinguishable from reality. You don't know if there is a computer programming it all and creating the illusion or if there is actually a real set designer and actor sitting on a couch getting filmed for you to watch. That question isn’t really as easy as it sounds. It is similar to asking how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.<n>You might think it is obvious because either way the image does not exist except in your head because it’s a simulation that exists only as an idea in your mind.<n>But they are a representation that if it weren’t an idea and was a real thing then you wouldn’t be asking.<n><n>However that is a false dichotomy because although that’s the only two options presented the third answer is that you’re somehow wrong, just because.<n>In any case there is no way for you to know and it would be unknowable, and in this situation, it doesn’t matter. The question is a moot

Since Mary doesn't see it as a punishment, she isn't going to do well in school and her mother still wins since she made her do housework to punish her for poor performance.<n>Answer: If someone knew they were going to do housework (as a punishment), they'd try harder in school to avoid the punishment. But if someone knew they had to do housework regardless of whether they did their school work, they'd be more likely to procrastinate and/or slack off on their school work.<n><n><n>### Instructions:  Create all the required methods for the Program.<n><n>### Method Summary<n>* Program to start all required classes.<n>* program to start all classes<n>* Method:  test<n>    * test method to be run.<n>* method to start the tests<n>* method to start and run the tests<n>* program tests.<n>* program  to print all required reports including summary.<n>* program to print all the reports<n><n>

Choices:  A: top of home B: older houses C: victorian house D: own home E: material<n>Output:		The correct answer is D (own home).<n><n>An attic is typically found in older houses because of the increased difficulty of construction.<n>In fact, the term ‘attic’ can be traced back to the Ancient Greeks, where it means a storage space for items from the home’s upper levels.<n>This was most likely an attic since the Romans, due to technical issues, had ceilings that remained lower on homes.<n><n>In the United States, attics were most notably used in the early years as a living space.<n>Migrants who wanted the American dream and moved out to the West from the East coast used attics in their newly constructed homes to provide them with a place to sleep. These attics were typically heated and sometimes furnished. Many of these migrants later became very wealthy and began to build mansions, using an attic as their historical room for historical items.<n>The term ‘attic’ is not commonly used for this purpose anymore. The reason for this change is most likely because homes were built to be smaller in these early years.<n>Even though Victorian homes also had attic rooms, it is not likely that their attics contained any historical items.<n>Finally, attics are only found in larger houses since it will be harder to climb stairs that are a bit steeper.<n>So the best answer is D (own homes with attic rooms for historical items)<n><n>Input: A 30 story building was hit by a hurricane with winds of about 72 miles per hour, and fell onto a 60 foot tall tree in front of it.

Choices:  A: soccer game B: capillaries C: ball D: animals E: person<n>Output:		I was tempted to choose person since we often say "spilled blood", but that is what one should do as an engineer: write test cases based on the problem definition exactly.  One should never assume anything.  The problem spec says "does not allow the use of hands". It doesn't say that "the use of hands" should not be the cause of spilling blood, so one should write an input that tests for whether hands are allowed, and then run a case where hands are not allowed and no blood is spilled.  <n><n>A game where the use of hands is allowed could lead to a spilled blood case if for example, there was a collision between two players.  That's just one of many potential possibilities (if there was no collision, then there's not enough information to say if the game would result in spilled blood.)  If the game is a soccer game, then the correct output is A. If person or animal leads to a spilled blood, then it's D.<n>

The pumpkins come in two different shapes: large pumpkins and small pumpkins. All pumpkins have numbers written on them, but if the pumpkin is large the number is two digits, and if it’s small the number is a single digit. Large pumpkins that have single digit numbers are always even, and large pumpkins that have two digit numbers are always odd. Small pumpkins always have an even number.<n><n>Output:<n><n>Choice: The answer is 39. Choices D and E are incorrect because C and D are both less than 39. E is less than option C. C is less than 39 because 292 < 39 * (1 pumpkin per square pumpkin. 1 square pumpkin = 2 x 2 = 4 pumpkins or 1 row).<n><n>Answer: The total number of large pumpkins is (odd) (86*). This number equals (odd) (98) which equals (159).

She used these stickers to make note taking easier.<n><n>Explanation: A large sticker used to indicate that a note was important, and a small sticker indicated not important. When the papers were connected together in a journal, one could quickly flip through the journal to find a note when needed. When there were 8 pages of regular sized pages of a journal, it became too cumbersome to locate important notes. Therefore, using large stickers, one can quickly locate important notes from the front page of the journal.<n><n>Input: The farmer can take 1 horse and 1 goat. First the farmer will place 1 horse, then 1 goat on the side of the road to the farm. The farmer cannot take any more than 1 horse, and 1 goat at a time.<n><n>Explanarion: The only animal that has enough energy and stamina to take on this

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Mary had 89 stickers.  She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: Mary added a total of 7 stickers/page * 6 pages= <<7*6=42>>42 stickers to the 6 other pages.<n>In total, Mary added 3 large stickers + 42 stickers = <<3+42=45>>45 stickers to her journal.<n>Since she started with 89 stickers, she now has 89 - 45 = <<89-45=44>>44 stickers left.<n>So the final answer is 44<n><n>Input:Why would you not want to be working with wood? Choices:  A: blisters B: frustration C: being paid D: make money E: money<n>Output:		C<n><n>### Solution:<n>In the first example, the question is, "What number represents $96 when $28 is increased by 1/2?"<n>The answer is obviously "$54". So, we need to ask, what do those numbers represent when we increase it or decrease. So, to answer the second example, we ask, "You have an equation which says $6 - 5y equals $3. What number are 'y' and 5y?"<n>There is a relationship between the two questions and can answer them simultaneously. So, they are the same question.<n><n>### Solution<n>Given a + 1.00 = 1.84, a – 1 = 1.76, 1.84 + 1.76 = 3.60 and a – 1.76 ≤ 3.60 = 1.74.<n>The difference between the two is 3.60 – 1.74 = <<3.60-1.74=1.86>>1.86.<n>We know that 1.74 – 1.7 = <<1.74-1.7=0.04>>0.04 and therefore, 1.74 > 1.7.<n>The only conclusion is this: in order to get 1.86 for a, we have to add 1.74, which would be b = 0.12.<n>So, if a = 1.62, the answer is 1.62 + 0.12 = <<1.62+0.12=1.74>>1.74.

Sometimes the question has only one instruction then you have to implement that instruction and then compare your answer with the expected output and sometimes it has more than one instruction then try to find your way and do it using multiple instructions. <n><n>### How to read the question?<n>In this subsection, we will discuss how to read the problem statement in a programming quiz.<n><n>1) **Read the question only once** : Some questions in the programming quiz don't have any instructions but they are quite tricky. <n><n>2) **Understand the structure of the question** : Questions are not limited to having only one sentence instruction. Sometimes there may be more than one instruction depending upon the structure of the problem and difficulty of the question. In such cases, you need to understand the context of different instructions in a question in order to effectively solve them. For example, if there is a question 'What is the total in the car?', it is more likely to have only one instruction and you will have to do one operation on a value. However, if the question is 'What is the most valuable in a set of 7 cars?', it is quite possible to have more than one instructions (e.g. find the value of the car and then compare it with another value).<n><n>3) **Understand the instruction(s)** : When there are multiple instructions in the question, read instructions carefully and try to analyse them. <n><n>4) **Focus on the question :** Try to understand the question instead of focussing on how you are going to solve the question. While this might make it easier to find the solution, a good practice is to try to solve the question first because it will help you to focus on the problem statement.<n><n>5) **Knowledge of instructions** : If

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Mary had 89 stickers.  She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: Mary added a total of 7 stickers/page * 6 pages= <<7*6=42>>42 stickers to the 6 other pages.<n>In total, Mary added 3 large stickers + 42 stickers = <<3+42=45>>45 stickers to her journal.<n>Since she started with 89 stickers, she now has 89 - 45 = <<89-45=44>>44 stickers left.<n>So the final answer is 44<n><n>Input:A person takes a seat to watch a movie, where is he? Choices:  A: in cinema B: at the park C: martorell D: jeep E: airplane<n>Output:		In English, a cinema that was a “mobile/ traveling/ outdoor cinema” would be referred to as “a travelling/pop-up/ or an outdoor cinema”. An example where a person takes a seat in a travelling cinema would be to watch a movie in a park.<n>But an airplane is a totally diffirence from a person takes a seat to watching a movie at the martorell.<n>So the answer is D: jeep<n><n>Input: The number of people attending the party was 18 more than 1/3 of the total. Choices:  A) 3 B) 2 C) 1 D) 0 E) No one attended<n>Output: The total number of people divided by 3(1/3 = 1/3) = 3<n><n>So for 18 more people it would be<n>18/3 = 6 <<18/3=6>><n><n>So 18+18=36 and if you divide it by 3 again you can get the answer.<n><n>Input: 4-3-7-4-6-9-5<n>Output: 4 3 7 4.3 6 9 5<n>The first number is 1 and the second number is "subtracted" by one, and since the number is already 4, it should become 3<n>The third number is subtracted by two, and since it goes from an odd number to even, it becomes 7<n>The fourth number is also subtracted by two, so it becomes 43<n>The fifth number is the last number and it gets subtracted by one, so it becomes 6<n>The sixth number is a number that is added to the next<n>So the last number will become 9 while adding, so 9+5=14<n>The output should end with 10 because 14 is a multiple of 5.<n>The answer is: 4 37 49 43 6 95<n><n>### Instruction:Write a method named count.

The bartender asked me if I wanted it on the rocks. I told him. He poured me one glass of rock and I said, "Why so few?"  the bartender replied "that's why you left." What does it mean?<n>Output: One should be careful when asking for things on the rocks. Your response should be 'a few' (or 'a few' rocks will not make a difference in that drink). If a bartender pours you a drink in a glass, he is only likely to ask you: "How many oz?'s?" "How many ounces do you want?" or "How many ouncers do you want?" In which case you would say: 'I want an ounce.' Or, you may say, "I'll have two" (for two ounces, or ounces).  The expression is a reference to the Bible:  The Bible tells us that "the man said to the angel: 'Please give me your pants, which we are still wearing.'''.  It is the same question as, "give me your pants that are on'".<n>###### Question<n><n>Input: How many ounces of water would it take to fill a 37 fl oz can?<n>Output:<n><n>Answer: The water volume of a 37 fluid ounces container is 37 * 6 * 2 = 64 oz.<n>It would take 64 fluid ounces of water to fill a 39 ounce can.<n><n>##### Instruction:Answer the multiple choice question below<n><n>Input: If an artist has to sell their work, how can they be creative?<n>Output: Artists can use creativity to create art that is unique and stands out from others.

Additionally, artists can also incorporate their ideas into their works so that they can make a statement or convey an emotion through their work.

Again this does not fit the description of "A what" as it refers to an idea to be understood. And lastly D is a "vote". "Voting is the formal expression of an individual's approval or disapproval on a matter". So in the context used, "a societal change", this fits.<n><n>Input: Choices:  A) 1/3 B) 2/3 C) 1/4 D) 2 /4<n>Output: D "2/4" the definition of 1 means "One of the 10 digits of a number system"; one more than 9. That does not apply as it refers to number systems and is not a fraction.<n><n><n><n>Input:Choices:A: 28 C: 4<n>Output:C "4" is not a possible answer.<n><n>Input:Choicws:Fourteen plus one equals_____<n>Output: B "25", that is not the correct answer, 14+1=15

When a user’s answer gets an input wrong, the program provides the user with an explanation to what the correct answer was. The program is in JavaScript and displays everything on the browser. No images are used because the program is hosted on a free site called Glitch. <n><n>[Here is the link to the full program](https://glitch.com/~the-book-report-math-exercise-game)<n><n>### Why this project?<n>This program started with me trying to learn more JavaScript, so I started making a simple game where you get points for answering math questions. However, all I wanted to do was a simple program that showed the questions and answers but added a score when the user presses submit. I found Glitch which allowed me to create an easy site where I could display the program without anything glitching it so I just added the questions, instructions, and score keeping. The only two things I didn’t like about the program were that the user doesn’t get any explanation right away when they get an answer wrong, and also that there wasn’t a correct answer to what the user had to get right. I figured if my friend was taking a quiz, she might want to know where she went wrong, so I added that into the program so she can know how many questions she got wrong. As for the correct answer question, I wanted to see if I could get multiple answers being correct so I added that in like where the user could select a few answers and they would still get a point. After I implemented the features, I kept

If people were at a football stadium, they'd be running around to see the action, or maybe just walking while talking. At the car show, people are running around and also talking. These questions also don't have anything to do with the question. The question may have to do with the person who is moving. At the opera, what are the singers' movements while they're singing?

Choices:  A: amusement park B: urban area C: airport D: shopping malls E: train station<n>Output:		Choice C -> airport  Choice E -> train station<n>A shopping mall is a business-oriented version of a shopping center or shopping plaza. It typically consists of an open-air or enclosed grouping of shops forming a complex of retail stores; as of 2012 in the United States, shopping malls accounted for 8% of retailing spending and 58 percent of retail spending was accounted for by shopping center and strip malls.<n>A retail park (also known as a shopping precinct) is a small commercial real estate property, normally a subdivision of land, comprising a group of retail tenants, such as supermarkets, retail stores and fast food outlets. It is an alternative name to retail plaza, village shopping centre, or shopping centre in the United States and Canada. A retail park is typically a free-standing land use which offers a single concentration of retail stores with relatively limited architectural embellishment to the parking lot. By the end of 2010, the 10 largest retailers in the United States accounted for 72% of all sales at malls and shopping centers.

Our fingernails may be clean now, but not many hours later they might be dirty because that mud is now mixed in with the dirt.<n>If I decide to grow a garden in the spring, I need dirt so I can grow plants in my garden.

Who wins?<n>Output: I am out because I am the only player who chose a number that is not one of the numbers with a player closest to.<n>Answers:One strategy is to choose the most popular number first. There are only 9 players, so there are 9 numbers from which to choose. The most popular number is 30, which is the number closest to 51. If that number comes up early in the game, everyone else is forced to draw. If every other player draws, all remaining players (me!), will be out since they will be the only players choosing an unpopular number (30 = 50 - 10, 40 = 60 - 20, 50 = 80 - 30).<n>I suggest choosing most popular number first because if you are left with no unpopular numbers (i.e. 60), then you can play safe and just pick 50 since there are no other players who choose this number. <n>If nobody chooses #30, then one of the players who do choose a number close to 50 will be out since 30 is still the most popular number. Then player(s) that pick a number close to

Can I build one with a bunch of random numbers and a lot of time? The answer should be yes! First, we need a human's gender. There are two options; male and female. We'll take the number 3 and divide it by 2. Let's call this the probability of male. When we divide all even numbers by 2, it is 2/2 = 1 so the probability of male is 3/2 = 1.5. Then choose a random number between 0 and 1 (the probability of 0 is 0, probability of 1 is 1). There is at least a 0.5 chance of male, so we put male as our choice. Next we need a body. We need two arms, two legs, and a head. There are eight possible numbers (0 to 7) for these choices so we will try 6 of them. After a random number is chosen for the body, the rest of the human is determined using that chance of the body being male and that chance of the number (0-7). If it's 3, then it is male and has a head of 6 (higher chance), two arms, and one leg. If it is 4, it is female and has a head of six and two legs. If it is 5, it's female and has two arms and one leg. If its 6 or 7, it's male and has one leg and one arm. If it is 0 or 1(2 possibilities), neither. But then there is no human. There is still 1/2 chance of the next choice.<n><n>So now that we have a human, we can choose what the human will be called. There are an infinite amount of names since any sequence of letters can be chosen, but let's put a few together that are likely. We'll start by taking the probability of the rest of the human (18 out of 40) and add it to the probability of the number assigned randomly. So, the first human that could have been chosen, we say, "Let's take Adam and name him Adam." If

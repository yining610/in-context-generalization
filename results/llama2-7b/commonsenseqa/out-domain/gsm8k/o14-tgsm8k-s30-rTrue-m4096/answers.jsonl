The dog weighs 200 pounds. Is there a way for the dog to cross the bridge?\nOutput: There is a way for the dog from either side of the bridge.  From the initial side there is an initial bridge with capacity of 1250 pounds.

Amy had a 4.0 GPA and she had 64 credit hours. George had a 3.0 GPA and he had 66 credit hours. Who had more credit hours?\nAmy with 64 credit hours\nOutput: Amy\nThe answer may seem odd, but just think a high school student that graduated 4.0 G.P.A and still had an accumulated 100 hours may wonder if they are ever done! It depends on your degree. With a 4.0 you may have accumulated 120 credit then graduate with an 80 credit hours. You are done at this level, or have completed your degree. If you have a bachelor's degree, and have around 190 credit hours, then you'd better start working on your Master's degree.\nIf you have a Master's degree, and you want a doctoral degree, you have to get 80 credit hours to get a doctoral degree after you've graduated your bachelor's and master's degrees.\nAll in all, think of credit hours as building blocks of your degree. You really don't care that you have 3000 credit hours, but you care that it took you 66 credits to get that 3000 credits. If you have 67 credits, you must have more credit hours, and you need to get a Ph.D. to keep on accumulating credit", "answer": "A: prison"}

How many hours is spent on traffic enforcement in the country?  Assume that each flight takes from 350 to 1,000 miles to get across the country to the beach resort.  Flights cost an average of 3 times as much as driving.\nOutput: I\u2019m giving you an equation for the traffic enforcement as well:\n500 * (5+((350-1000)/150) ) = <<500 * (0.15 + ((350-1.000)/1.50 ) ) >>>1.95 = <<500*0.8475>> 0.84730971 \u2248 0.848 hours\nI made an assumption it costs 3 times as much to fly than driving.\nI\u2019m going to show you the equation first so take that equation (500*00848) I will show you the steps:\nStep 1 The first thing I divided 500 by 0.84 = 500/0.84= 604.333\nStep 2 I took 604.2 604.96/1.5 = 604.82/1.5 = <<604.8/1.5=383>>383\nStep 3 I took 383.809/ 1600/1.5 = <383.", "answer": "A: break easily"}

If it takes an average of 15 hours, it takes 0.5 hours to drive from San Francisco to see the Golden Gate.  It is approximately 360 miles from SF to LA.   0.5 hours / 360 miles * 360 miles / 15 = <<0.5/360*360/15=5.333>>5.333 hours\nSo the final answer of 5.333\n\nInput: Your friend is coming for Thanksgiving in 3 weeks.

You need three groups to break the 36 students into them.\nKelly wants to make sure all the good students are together, so we would need to separate the good students from the rest.  We need to create groupings with the good students together and the rest together.\nWe group the Good A with the Good B.  We will have 36 students total, with good students we will group into Group A (good A)+Group B (good B)=<<36(A+B)=36>>36\nWe also want an equal split of the bad students.  We will just divide the total students into thirds, then there is 3 students per third grouping. So again, we have 36/(1/3)=<<36/(1/2)=36>>3 good students total.\nLastly, we have all the rest.  We do not know the skill level of the students.  But since we have 36 students there must have been three good students, so we will assume there are 9 students that are average.  We are left with 24 students which will make our grouping 8 in a group.\nSo the final answers is 1(good A), 1(good B), and 3(average) 1+1+3 = <<1+1<A+B=3A>>3\nAdd up the students with good grades and you get your final answer of 3.", "answer": "A: winners and losers"}

He runs downstairs to the bathroom to turn on the tap, but it's broken and he can't use the tap. He has another idea: he grabs a glass. The glass takes 1 minute to fill completely. He leaves the water running while he takes a shower. The shower head has a constant water flow and he's able to drink 1 liter every hour. How long will he have to drink the water from the glass before he has to fill it?\nOutput: The time needed to fill the glass from completely empty will make the water take 5 minutes. Once the glass is full he can start his calculations. He starts drinking 1 liters of water every hour. That's the same as 30 glasses every hour. If he is drinking 30 glasses per hour, lets assume 1 glass per minute for Nigel. (This is because if he is drinking a glass every minute then in actuality he would finish 15 more glasses per hour.) The calculations now look like this: 16 (gallons of water) / (gallons from glasses drank per day) = 7 days. Thus he will need to fill up his glass 7 times.

Instead we made an array of functions under the body so we can just use them without changing the template.\nThe first three problems were quite hard. I was not sure what the correct output was for the first problem. It was a question about the difference between two temperatures. In the end, it had something to do with the formula used to calculate the difference between Celcius and Farhrenheit. However, I did not know which temperature corresponded to the first degree mark '\u00b0' in the series, and it was important to match up the temperatures with the right key. This was the same for the second problem, but I had already solved the first problem, I could just use previous output to check if my answer was right or not.\nI had no clue for the questions after that.

Then add an extra 50, (100+50=<<100+51>>151)because he starts from Erie then goes to Hollidaysburg, adding 50 at the end. So if you are going to drive 160 miles to get to Hollidaysberg, it takes 60 miles from Erie(160-160=<<10>>0)to get to where Jason started.  And 50 from Erie to Hollidaysburgh. So then if Jason wants to get to Pittsburgh, he has to add 151 miles up to the 160 miles he was already there. So 51 + 151 = <<151+51>>202 miles, adding up 202 miles to get 252 miles.\nSo the final is 2", "answer": "A: mouth"}

If the brother with the car can take all his siblings, then they will each pay $8.25 for their tickets. However, with only one car, they have to leave one sibling home. Then each sibling pays $9.25. How much will it cost for the movie, if the movie costs $3.50 each plus taxes?\nOutput: Let x be the number of siblings left home.\nThe total cost for movie tickets of 1(8.25)+x(9.25) = <<1x(8.25)>>x(8.2).\nSince the total amount for movie tickets is $7.75, then x = <<7.75=3>>3\nSo the final answer from 2(8.25)$+$3(9.25)$=<<2(8.2+9.25)+3>>$=<<2(9.25)+9.25>>$19.6$19.6 is 3\n\nInput: You have a bag of apples.

On one side of the field and to win the game, you need to have an equal number of players.  How do you get to 12 from 12 on both sides of field?\nOutput:  Each side has to face the same number of players. Therefore, the equation becomes 12(1/2)=<<12(1/3)=4>>4.  The numbers must split evenly, which means to make it 12 on each side, the numbers must add up to 24, with 4 on each side.\n\nInput: There are a total of 12 children in the school choir, 9 of whom sing soprano, 4 baritone, and 9 of who sing alto.  If each grade has the same proportion, and grade 7 accounts for 50% of the total choir, how many are in each grade in the school choir?\nOutput: Since each grade has the same ratio, we can use the value of 9 as a base value to find the ratios with grade 7 contributing 50% of all choir members.\nIn other words, if there were only four grades, there would have been 9 sopranos, 4 baritones, plus some number of altos that contribute 50% of total choir members. Solving for 9, we have: 9/5=<<9/5=1.8>>1.8\nIn the case of 17 children, this would be 17/9=<<17/9=1.875>>1.875 or 95% soprano\nNow, if we multiply the 9 and 4 we get 36. Then if we also add the value of the total number of altos plus the value of the total # of baritones plus the total number of sopranos, we get to 49, which means the value of Grade 7 as a total number is", "answer": "E: surf net"}

If a beer costs you $1.87, how much will it cost you?\nOutput:First off, the fixed amount is going to be $$.21.\nThe price per serving of a drink is $.10.\nTherefore, we set up an equation: $ = 20.5%.\nSubtracting the fixed cost (which is left over) from our total, our variable (dollar cost) is $ = 80.5%.\nUsing.10, we can solve for x ($ = 0.1 * x).\nx = $0.1 * $ = $. If x is $.1, then we can solve the original problem.\nIf x = $.10, then x = $.\nTo solve the original problem, we plug in $.10 into the original equation, so: $.10 * 1.87 = $\n$ = $.10 * $ + $0.21 = $.10 * $.10 * 9.5 = $18.75\nSo the final answer was $18.74", "answer": "A: cupboard"}

How many minutes exactly were in that 34?\nOutput: At 2 am, I had only 34 minutes before my alarm went off at 2:34 am. There are 7 of those 34 minutes, leaving 27.5 of those 34 remaining minutes. There are 27.5 minutes in 1 hour, 30 minutes, and 45 minutes.

Then the number becomes the smallest 6 digit number that is larger...etc.  Thus the 1234...56 is smaller than 4958 and the 123...00 is smaller than 7492 because the last digit of each number is not the smallest digit of the following number, thus the 4 is bigger than the 2 and the 2 is bigger then the 9, etc.  Then, the last digits in each number are compared, if the last digits are the same the next smallest number has an earlier value in the original numbers.  Thus, in 1234 the 3>4.  So this number is not greater than 1234.  Again, it is not greater than 9178 so it must be less than 8810.

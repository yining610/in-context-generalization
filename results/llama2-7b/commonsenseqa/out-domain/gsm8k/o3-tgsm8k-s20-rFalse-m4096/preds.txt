From this, we know Tapanga has 100% plus percentage of Corey's(=Total/2) and additionally given 100%.<n>So,100% of Corey is 28,and total candies is 2*28 +2*6 = 66.

But then he calls his brother, and they talk for only 31 minutes. So the difference between these 2 calls is 14minutes.<n>So,he calls for 45+ 14= 59 minutes.<n><n>Local calls costs 5c each minute.And from here we can easily infer the amount of money he spends.<n><n>next:<n>Input:Now 5 is half of 10<n>And therefore<n>5+ 5= 10<n><n>next:<n>input:Now,<n>10= 5+ 5.<n>Therefore<n>10/4= 5+5.(10%= 5,and 4=5+5)<n>But 10% of days is a one day.<n>So,<n>10 days must be equal to one day.<n>Therefore, 10 days equals 24 hours.<n><n>This implies he must work 5 days per week.<n># 25<n><n>Input:Tanya, the small knight, is found mostly in fairytales.

B) The question is how many candies does Core make => How many more than Tapanga => (Core makes 29 in one hour and Tapanga made 10 in one hour).  => Core make in one (one hour) more than Tapanga made => (29 - 8)/8 = (21/8)=2.62 = 2.5 => Core makes 2.5 in one hour.  => Core  made 10 in 10 minutes and 8 in 2.5 hours => The answer is 80+2.5 = 82.5.<n><n>Input: Freddies input costs 31 minutes to a long-distance call => 5.5 x.05/.25= 0.4 x 0.3<n>Input: Lawrence worked a few more hours then the standard number of hours on the days he works a standard number of hours => 21 x (5.5 - 3)/.5 =  <n>48.<n>In the above line there is a "." which means to divide one number by another.

Choices: A: 720 degrees B: half as much C: 360 degrees D: 180 degrees E: 150 degrees Answer: A. You know that radians = degrees * pi/180, so the total degrees in radians is<n>```<n>(1) (720 * pi)/180 = 2 pi/180 = 1 radians, and<n>(2) (180/180 * pi)/100 = 1 rad.<n>(2) is a third of the equation (1), so 1 rad ~ 3 radians.<n><n>For (1), we have<n>```<n>(180/720 * pi/18) = pi/180 -<n>```<n>Since there are 180/100 radians in a degree, we can replace (180/7<n>```<n>= (100 * pi)/190 = (pi)/40 = 1/4 of 1 rad<n>If we add this to 1, since there are 15 degrees in a half a circle, <n>```<n>1+1/4 = 5/4 or 1.25 radians<n>So the answer is A.<n>```<n><n>Input: If we add 10 and 4 and double the result, what is the answer?<n>```<n>If we add, the answer is 14<n><n>If we double, the answer is 28<n><n>The answer is 28.<n>```<n><n>###############################################################

It contains 24 million neurons, the same as the number of muscles in human body. These neurons send signals to each other via axons and dendrites. The average speed of these signals is about 180-200 mph. The neurons can also form connections with each other through synapses. A synapse takes about 20 milliseconds to take action. After 60 milliseconds, the brain is doing calculations, and after 140 milliseconds, we can see it in action, otherwise known as a flashback. The brain can store about 1 petabyte of information. That is a large number, but that is 2,000 floppy disks, or less than 1/100,000th of all the stars in the galaxy. The brain has approximately 100 billion neurons. That is more neurons than the number of stars in all of the galaxies in the entire universe. Now, the brain can form 1 quadrillion synapses a day. Wow! It also works great as some sort of alarm clock.<n><n><n><n><n>Input: In the brain there are 93 billion neurons. It has a lot of storage. Some people need a lot of that space to store their stuff.

Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute.

Choices:  A: driveway B: the event C: scrap heap D: parking garage E: repair shop<n>Output:		garage<n><n><n><n>### Solution: <n>For the first question, we count Tapanga's candies, and subtract that from Corey's candies. But, we need to be sure that Tapanga's candy can't be negative. Therefore, we count how many candy Tapanga is holding, and store it in a separate variable. Here is code in case people want to test it.<n><n>```<n>int tapangaCandies = 0;<n><n>for (candy=0; candy <= 66; candy++) <n>{<n>   if (candy.tapangaCandies + candy.coreyCandies > 0) <n>   {<n>   tapangaCandies += candy.tapanga;<n>   candy.corey -= tapangaCandies;<n>   } <n>   else <n>   {<n>       // negative case<n>       candy.corey += candy.tanganga[5]<n>   }<n>}<n>```<n>Here, we get a new variable, the corey candy, which we subtract the tapanga candies from the main corey candy. If the subtraction was successful, we added the tapanga candies to the corey candy. Then, after the if-else statements, the corey cady is 31. <n>

Choices:  A: ghost town B: third world country C: human body D: rug E: hospital<n>Output:		A <n>A disease can often spread in many different forms and situations that the majority of people don't want to associate themselves with. Except for the choices that aren't biological examples, the virus could make its way into the ghost town, but there is more precautions in place and health care in case the disease does occur. The third world country doesn't have the resources, which increases the amount of people that are in danger. The human body is another place that could see a lot of disease as well as hospitals. The word choice I would like to see is "human body" as there are a lot of ways that the body can spread diseases. This is also an area that is prone to disease and more susceptible to the virus. "Ghost towns" is a bad answer since there are no people. This could lead to the virus living on longer in the ghost town. It's easy to have biology in a ghost town. "Human body" makes the most sense, and there is more in-depth information in that answer than the others.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question. Write your solution as a Python code. Submit your code in the submission link on the upper right-hand side of this page.<n><n>Input:The sum of two consecutive numbers is 29. What are the numbers?<n>Output: 9, 20<n><n>### InstructionsWrite a Python program that implements the "Swap Operator". The "Swap Operator" should be a function that takes two arguments. The first argument should be a variable or expression with value, and the second argument should be a variable. The function should return the value and do nothing else. For example, in order to swap an argument x and z with eachother, write:<n><n>x, z = z, x. The function should work on floats too, like if you write x = 10 and y = 10, the function should swap the values, creating x = y = 20. Test the function by swapping every set of variables you can think of.<n><n>In order to successfully complete the lab, you should be able to have the functions work on the examples as:<n><n>1. x, z = 2, 3.<n>2. y, x = 1, z.<n>3. x = 2, 2, z

Let me first explain it and then I will show you how to solve the problem.<n>So, in this problem, we have two children Tapanga and Core<n>We say that the first person to solve that problem is Tapanga, because she has 8 more candysticks than Core. So, Tapanga's answer is 35. And, then, Core also will solve it and if you multiply the number of candysticks that is left in Core's hand by 2 you will get the same number of candysticks as Tapanga. So, Core's answer to every multiple choice question is 29.<n>But since Core's answers are not so different from Tapanga, Tapanga will win.<n><n>### Question #2 (Multiple choice) <n>So in this problem,<n><n>I guess, since I don't do those things very often, it's a lot of hours but probably about the same amount.<n>So in total Freddy spent 24$ for the call.<n><n>### #3 (Multiple choice)  <n><n><n>![alt-text](https://user-media.githubusercontent.codeavengers.com/8506dbec-c60c-4f3f-8021-58bf870ef666.png)<n><n>![alt-img](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/140191997802135856/839885503248279908/40b35655-2a1c-4262-9c7f-c2f38a276381.png)<n><n><n>### Question:<n>Tapanga has 8 candysticks more than Corey.

At 45 miles later they stopped again to the same city to buy the father a hat. After 2 hours the father asked how long it would take them to get to the city and the daughter didn't know. What it took her to go from the city of 35 miles away was 35 minutes so she guessed that it would take her 35 minutes to get to the new city on the way to their own city. At 10 miles the father stopped the car and told her that they'd be arriving in the city in approximately an hour. That they knew until the end so they made the trip and finally got to the city. What age was the daughter when they arrived at the second house and what was the distance they'd travelled from the second house to their own? The little girl was 4 but she would be 4.5. This trip went for 45 minutes but they arrived home after 10 hours. The daughter was 5.5, after 10 hours and the girl would have gone through the entire year of age ( 12 months).<n><n><n><n>##### Part 1 of 3<n><n><n>

Choices:  A: nebraska B: new york C: mexico D: home E: utah<n>Output:		B<n>### Solution:<n>For the first question, we will assume that Corey has candies and Tapanga has the rest of the candies.<n><n>If we take away all the candies that Corey has we will have a total of 66 candies left. Now let us split those candies up by their remaining number of candies into three groups.<n><n>- the remainder is less than Corey's candies, or, 1st group<n>- the remainder is 29 or more, but less than Tapanga's candies, 2nd group<n>- the remainder that is over Tapanga's, 3rd group<n><n>if we use 29 as the cut off in this case, this is where Corey's candys end and we will end up with 9candies in the 3rd group and 57 candies in the 1st.<n><n>The total number of candies we have now is 56+9+29=94.<n><n>There is one final step that we need to complete. We need to be able to see if there are any more than 29 candies in Corey's box. If there are, Corey has more candys than Tapanga. It is no longer a problem of Corey having less than Tapanga.<n><n>If there are less than 29 candys in Corey's bucket we do not need to look further.<n><n>We can conclude that Corey has 29 or at least 29 candys. The problem states, "how many does Corey have". We would count 29 plus the remaining number of candys that he has.<n><n>### Solution Code:<n>![First image](src/first_problem.png)<n>![2nd image](src/second_problem.png)

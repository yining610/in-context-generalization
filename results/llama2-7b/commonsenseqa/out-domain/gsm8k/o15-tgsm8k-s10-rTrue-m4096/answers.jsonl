Babies born in the Year 1 are labelled with the letter \u201cT\u201d and those born in Year 2 as \u201cJ\u201d. At present, there are five more T\u00b4s than J\u00b4s. In the coming year, about 200 births will occur for every year born so far. How many of these people were born in Year 1?\nOutput: Different numbers of births are about 200/2 per year born, so 5 more T\u00b4s born. Now there are 5 more T\u00b4than J\u00b4s. This means there are 5 X 300 = <<5*300=1500>>1 500 T\u00b4s and 300/2 J\u00b4s. In year 1, there are 1500/3 (300/2 = <<300/2=150>>150 ) T\u00b4s, and 1500 - 600/2 = 900 (300/4=<<300/4>>250 ) T\u00b4thats born. 900/150 = 6 T\u00b4 births. Thus in Year 1, there can only be 6 T\u00b4 born.\nSo the final output = 6/5 (answer) for T\u00b4 in Year 1\n\nInput: How many letters are there in \u201chello\u201d ?\nOutput: In \u201chello\u201d there are 5 letters which represent a 5 digit", "answer": "A: ignore"}

After solving them, you obtain the two following equations:  Choices: A x=2 B x=3 and y =1 C x = 1 and y = 4 D x=4 and y=2 E x=x+y\nOutput:D\nYou first have to solve for x so the equation should read: 5 = x + y.\nSo x = 5 \u2013 y.\nAlso y =8, which can be written: 8 = y.\nSo solving for y, we get that y = 8 \u2013 x. We can plug this value for y back into one of the equations to get the last equation. x + (8 \u2013 x) equals 5, which after simplification becomes 7 = x. This means that x = 7.\nThe solution is thus: 5 = x, x = 7, and x = x + y. (where y is a constant.)\nThe final answer, then, is D\n\nInput:Solve for x and y, where x > y.\nChoices: A x=3 and y=2 B x=2 and y=4 C x=1 and y=3 D x=y=4\nOutput:The first equation is x = 3x \u2013 2y + n. x = 3x => x = 1 and x = 3 (since 3 < 9).

It should use symbols to represent meaning. Meaning is usually encoded in words, written as well as spoken. Words use sounds or graphemes (such as letters) that signify or indicate a meaning. Words can be used to communicate ideas, concepts, emotions, and desires. Languages are generally spoken or written. Meaning is usually represented by symbols, and these can be called a language. English has 50 words for snow because it has a snowy season and thus the words are needed. Mandarin Chinese has 545 words for snow, which is largely because China is very snowy in the northern part of the country and has the longest periods of snowfall in the whole world of around 119 days. Japanese is spoken by about 128 million people and has over 35 words for snow. Spanish speakers can make use of four different words to describe the cold white stuff, and Korean has three words for snow.

When does 100% unemployment occur in the Great Depression?\nOutput:  We know that 100% is the beginning of unemployment.  Let's think of it using dates to understand.  In November 2020, 6.9% of families report someone who has not worked for a month.  By February 2021 that number has gone to 8.4% (8.3/100 of 199 million people).  What is interesting is that the unemployment rate for November and February is identical.\n100% un-employment occurs when everyone in the family of that person does not work for a month.  In February 2020 families who report someone who works full time or works part time were around 99% when families in February, 2021 report their job status. Since the second number has increased the percent of unemployment that month has increased. 100% was around January 1945 so let's say that 1945 is a nice round number for ending the unemployment for the Great Depression at 100%.  So we can assume the unemployment rate was around 100% in around Jan 1943 when people stopped looking for work.  So the answer should be in 1943 but we need to subtract 1 because the unemployment figures change every month so Feb 2021 should equal Jan 1945 or 1944\nSo the final answer should be Jan 1944 but we need to subtract a point and subtract a point for every month in between.\nSo the final will be Jan 1938 - Jan", "answer": "B: fun"}

In the game, a player (let\u2019s call them X) says \u201cDuck Season.\u201d While everyone else, including X, plays as usual, X then \u201csneaks\u201d away and says to a nearby parent, \u201cRabbit Season.\u201d After this, X returns to the game and proceeds as usual, playing alongside everyone else.\nFor the sake of simplicity, consider the game as a board with 2 dimensions of 2 spaces, with each step representing space. Since steps are taken on the dimensions, one step moves the player along the dimension perpendicular to their step choice, and a dimension change moves the player along the direction perpendicular to their last step.\nExample: If X says, \u201cSouth\u201d and moves forward 1 step, then changes to \u201cWest\u201d, they move 1 space forward and 1 space left.\nIf X says, \u201cNorth\u201d and moves up 2 steps, then changes to \u201cEast\u201d, they move up 2 spaces and 1 space right.\nIf X says \u201cWest\u201d and moves left 1 step, then \u201cNorth\u201d, they move 1 step forward and 1 step up.\nIf X says \"East\" and moves 1 step forward, then changes to \"Up\" (0 step), they simply move up.\nInput: Imagine we are playing this game, and X is the caller. Suppose X chooses East; it is winter and we all change to Winter Season. Then X chooses the direction \u201cSouth.\u201d Since X is the only one who changed \u201cseasons,\u201d they get to go again, saying either \u201cEast\u201d or \u201cNorth\u201d (e.g. \u201cEast Season\u201d). Since we all have the same season, and it\u2019s \u201cWinter\u201d by default, we simply let X take any step. When X, who is the caller, moves, we all move with them.\nNow, what happens if you take a step which causes you to leave \u201cWinter Season\u201d and become \u201cSummer Season\u201d? Suppose X moved northward (e.g. moved 1 square to the right), and since we all switched season,", "answer": "C: injury"}

Three marbles are drawn randomly. What is the probability for each of the marbes to be blue in that order, starting from the top?\nOutput: The probability that the top marble is green is ${4/27}$, since ${4/27}$ is the probability to flip a green marble. The probability that the second is blue is $6/27$. The probability that the third marble is blue is ${3/27}$. These are all independent events, so the probability that all the marbles are blue together is just the product of these probabilities, so ${3/27}*6/27*4/27$ (independent multiply).

{"idx": 264, "text": "Bankrupt means to be insolvent or broke and unable to pay one's debts. A company may be liquidated to become liquid assets. It takes out assets and sells them for cash or to get debt wiped off. This is bankruptcy and it means that the company becomes bankrupt, unable to pay its debt. Insolvent companies are often broken or sold to other larger companies. Insolvent companies that have become bankrupt are liquidated to sell their goods to pay off their debt. They pay their debts with the money they get from these sales. Branching out is the expansion of a company. This means that the company has grown too big for its location. They have to open up more branches or companies to cater for the demand. They expand to other countries and continents by opening new branches. This increases the revenue for the company. When a company is being branched out, it is doing well. Committing crime is a bad decision and it should not be allowed. Even if such a company is doing well, they should not allow the crime. It is a big risk as the customers may be put off by the activities of the company. Game over means the end of the company. It is bankrupt and the company no longer exists.

In 1747 the group leader and the doctor were the only two people on the island. They divided every member of the group evenly into two. They chose the doctor to be one of two people chosen to carry one of the hats. The 2 hats that they chose represent the two groups of people on the island. The two members of the group who carry each hat will be the ones who are the two people carrying each one of the hats, so there are two different ways to group people together in each hat. They decide to switch hats after seven years on the island. In how many ways is this possible?\nOutput:First determine the number of groups. Each person represents 3 people. If there are 6, the number of groups would be 6/3: 2. Next determine all the ways the members are assigned to each group. Choose 1 person for 2 groups: 2/3 people for 2/3 groups, the doctor would be one of the two chosen. For the remaining 2/3, it is not necessary to choose the doctor and you can choose a different one. Hence, the doctor will be chosen for 1/3 groups.

Choices:  company culture, culture, culture of a company, culture of a software, culture of company, culture in a company, company culture definition\nOutput:Culture is an abstract sociological concept that represents values, norms, morals, customs, etc of a group of people. It involves shared behaviors and norms among a group of people and is an important determinant of the individual identity and beliefs. The notion of culture is broad and has been described in different ways. Culture is expressed at both the micro level, among individuals, whereby the same values, norms, social conventions, and language are expressed, and at the macro level, when societies and nation states create a set of common values and norms for their citizens to adopt.\nSocialization and education are the major ways by which new members of an organization are incorporated into culture but may also include symbolic actions, such as the distribution of t-shirts. A particular culture is also distinguished by patterns of relationships, or social network analysis, whereby it is described by values, norms and language and their transmission.The concept of culture is closely related to terms like environment, values, norms, and beliefs. Although these terms can be used interchangeably, there exist differences in meaning.\n\nInput:Glass has been used for packing for a long time.

Choices:  Does not have a maximum balance Does have a maximum balance A bank cannot exceed the customer's maximum balance on an account  A bank can exceed the customer's account balance If you had a checking account and it said no maximum balance, the total amount of the account will exceed the amount on deposit.  If it was a savings account and it said it had a maximum balance, you wouldnt be able to put too much in.  A bank cannot exceed the account balance on an account because they are legally required to be accurate and maintain an account.  A bank will usually let you go over the account balance, but your deposit will go into a different account.\nOutput: The correct answer is, Does have a maximum balance\nIf you had a checking account which says no maximum balance, and put in a lot of money, the total amount in the account will exceed your account balance.  If they say it's a maximum balance, they will reject your deposit.\nA bank can exceed the customer account balance if they had a checking and if you had a large amount in your bank that was above your account balance.  The account balance is what you have in the bank.  I know it's a little complicated, but the question is if you have a checking account, and you know you have a certain amount on your account and it says it has no maximum balance, it means you can put anything in, but the bank will take your deposit and put it in a different account.  At a savings account though you could have a maximum and therefore, could not put that much in.

The parking garage wasn\u2019t too far away, but it was still about ten blocks into the city, and on some days I had to put in more hours and would be home past midnight. I also had to walk the motorcycle back to my house, sometimes five miles, in the evening when I was exhausted.\nI decided it was easier to ride my motorcycle into the city each morning and park it in the garage near my office. Then in the evening, I could ride it home. The advantage of the bike was that I could avoid traffic jams by taking the bike lane, and I could make short cuts across the city, while a car couldn\u2019t use it or would have to have a special parking permit. I could also get a parking spot close to my office, even during rush hour.

Jake's birthday is four weeks later than Sam's. How many days are between their birthdays?\nOutput: Jake's birthdeay is four weeks after Sam's birthday. Let D be Sam's birthday and let J be Jake's birthdate. Then, Sam's birthday is D + 4 = <<D+4=>>. Sam falls on the four week mark from J, which has to be at least a week after S. The difference between D and J is not zero but must be a positive integer. The difference, as a fraction of D, is ((J - D)/D)*4. We want to find (J -D)/J, so we write (J/J-D) = ((J)/((J-D))*(4/((J/J-D))).\nThe numerator of this expression is (4/4)*4, so the fractional part is just 1. Let that whole fraction be d. So (4d)/4d = 1. Rearrange to yield d = 1/4. Substituting d back into the denominator of the fraction and solving for J/D, we get (J/D) = (4)/1. Jake and Sam can't have different birthdays more than a week apart, so the difference between D and J cannot be larger than one.\nSince (J/D) * 4 = (4/-1), J is one week before D. If we add one week to the difference by adding 8 to the week difference, we get J - D = 8. If we plug that into our original fraction to find (4d)/4D, we have 4/((8/4) + 4) = ((J)/(8))*(4/((8/J) + 4)) = ((1/8)/4), so d = (1/1)/4 = 1/4 again. \nThis time, we find J/D is (4)/((1/8)/4) = 1/8, and adding 8 to the difference gives us J - D = 16.

The rent on the unit is $900/month. If a unit is empty, how much must it rent to break even?\nOutput:\nWe could start by calculating the cost of utilities.  $50/month * 4/30=$<<50/30=1.67>>1.67 months.  Let's call this P, for \"pre-rent.\"  So we start off each month with $900 - $1.67 = <<900-67=832>>832.50 P, which needs to cover the rent (900 - 25 = <<900-$25=875>>875), utilities, and profit for the owner.  The profit will be 50/25*15*360 = <<50/25*$8*360=800>>80 P/month, or $800 per year.  So this unit makes $800 - 35*30 - r = 323 per month.  We know the answer we are looking for has 800 in the denominator, and this has 500, so 800/500 =<<800/5=1.6>>1.6 is the final answer\n\ninput:10 students from school participated in the Science Olympiad, each costing $250 per student.

We found this by creating 9 arrays of 6 numbers, each of which has one 0. 9/5 yields 5/5, which yields 1/5, and when that is multiplied by 9/5, we get 9/25 and then 3/7, which yields 0/6. If n is the index of the element we have to check, then it takes 3n-8 steps to go from n to -15. 1n = 1, 2n=2, 3n=3, etc. for the first term, so the first term will take 11n - 8. For the second term, we'll take 9n-8, so the second term will take 10n-8. Therefore, our answer is 11n-8 + 10n-9 = 11n - -17 = 11n+16.

All she had was a set of 6 cards that showed numbers ranging from zero to fifteen.  She figured they could be used to make any value between 0-15.  The first card read, \"3\" and the next, \"7.\"  Which of the numbers on the cards, if any, are not shown in the order they were used to make the numbers on her cards?\nOutput:The cards, starting at \"3\" and ending with \"15\" give us the following order of numbers: \"3\", \"5\", \"7\", \"9\", \"11\", \"13\", \"15\".\nThe first 2 cards are \"3\" and \"7\", so that means they are not consecutive (one more than the other).\nThe third card, \"9\", is next to one of the \"7\", so that's not consecutive either.\nThe fourth card, \"11\", comes next to \"9\" and is also not consecutive (one less than the other).\nThere are no consecutive numbers after \"11\", so that means the fifth card \"15\" can't have been one after the other, so we can conclude that there is another consecutive number between \"3\" and \"15\".\nBased on the answer choices, this means \"4\" and \"6\" are the only cards which are consecutive\nSo the final answer could be \"4\" and \"15\"\n\n### Note\n\nThe input of the puzzles that were already explained before were either real life challenges or problems that have been taken from other books or other places on the Internet.

If they randomly selected a number it was 1/3 likely that it was an odd number. On the other hand, 1/5 of the even numbers are divisible by 2. The odd number 1 is never prime, and divisibility by 2 is not affected by the divisibility by 3.

She is 25 years old. How old is her sister?\nOutput: First, see that Katy is 1/8 the age of her sister, not 1/4. But it is hard to find a negative when you add.\nSo, we can use the fact that we have Katy's age in one fraction and her sister's age in another fraction to reduce the age to a common form. Since we start with both of them, the common form is 100/400.\nThen, divide 25, Katy's age, into 100/25, the common form. We get 100/5, or 20.\nThen, take Katy's age and subtract 20 to get her sister's age. We get 25-20=5.

We add the two numbers together (totaling 180 + 125, which is 305 apples when added).\nFinally, we subtract.

If you need 200 copies of a document, write it in a text box, and select \u201cPrint,\u201d how much will you end up paying?\nOutput: First, enter all the variables into separate variables. So let\u2019s call the number of pages printed P and the cost C and the variables to represent the cost of printing double-sided and printing a single-sides as D and S\nAlso remember to substitute the answer in the correct place, which in this case was C and substitute the new variables for their corresponding variables\n\nOutput: After converting each of the variables to their respective variables, substitute the variables in the correct places. The answer to the expression turns out to be 1200 * 15+20. First, the number of pages printed was the variable in C. Since we converted C earlier into S and D, the first expression of the question should be the cost of printing single-sides. The cost per page was 15 for 200 pages printed so the cost for 200 single sided pages was 15*200 = 3000$\nThe answer to the question was subtracting the cost when printing double-sided from single-sided. The problem is that there were only two possible variables to choose from, so the only ways to print double-sided was when there was an odd number of pages or when there was an even number of pages, so the cost of printing the document must be $1200, the cost of printing double sided.\nSince the final answer to the question was the cost of printing the double-sided document subtracted from the total cost of printing, so the final answer is 20\n\nInput: An ice cream vendor sells three size of creams. the regular ice cream, which costs $5, the large ice cream, which is the twice the cost of regular ice cream, and the triple cream, which is three times the cost of the regular ice cream.

{"idx": 649, "text": "A is the only option which begins with letter B -> we're selecting the best option.\n\nAnswer: I understand what you're getting at. You're saying that since the options don't start with a B, they're not what the person who is outgoing will seek. To that I counter with this: what if you start with the option that is the least likely answer, and then narrow it down from there? Let's say there are 1000000 options - if you have to get to the 100019999th, you have to get from the first to the last using at most 1023 - but at that point, the longest path is 100 billion options. If we use binary, using that logic, we have to get to the highest power 1000 possible power - 2^1000, which is 1000^100. At that point, we have to eliminate all options with the highest power, which leaves only one option.\nSo, the answer is that we have to take the last letter of every choice, and eliminate all options that don't start with the last letter. A would remain, since it is the only choice which starts with an A, but everything else becomes B, C, D, and E respectively. So in that way, it is a yes/no question.\n\nComment: There's a lot of content here that should be added to the question. You're getting downvoted because it looks like you're saying that A is the only B option -- this doesn't seem to be what the problem is asking.\n\nComment: @NathanTuggy But it is in the question. All options begin with a character in B except for A. The answer is to select the most out of those options. The rest of the code for this question is basically just binary tree-like code to choose the option which is the most out of those choices, starting from the most out, and narrowing it down until it gets to the answer. I don't understand how this is \"not relevant\".\n\nComment: For example, 1=yes, 0=no, then 0001=yes, 1101=yes, etc. This answers the problem by saying that since B doesn't start at 0, we", "answer": "A: new experiences"}

She'll need 4 bikes, 2 instructors, a gym membership and a bike stand. The gym membership costs $30 per month, but bikes only belong to the gym for $10 for 1  month. How much would it cost for a month?\nOutput: $90/24 = <<90/24=3.75>>3.75 per week, but 4 bikes are needed for 24 weeks, and each bicycle costs $10 per month = $<<10/24=0.42>>0.42 per week  So it would cost 7200/43 = <<7200/64=>112> of $112 for the bike stand\nSo the final answer $112\n\nInput: If the first digit of a number is 4, the other two digits add up to $5,$2,$8, or $3$. The number ends in a 6 or 8, and begins with a digit that ends an equal distance away from the end of the sequence. What is the number?\nOutput: If the first digit is 4, the number ends in 6 or 8. If it ends in a 6 then the number cannot be 444 or 446 because 6 + 6 isn't a multiple of 4.\nSo the highest number can be 416, which ends in 6.\nIt begins with a digit that is 4 digits away from the end of 16. If we add 4 to the start of 16, we get 96, so we cannot have a number that begins with 44.\nSo the starting digit can be 9.\n9416 comes out to 6241, so the highest number is 46241. Since this number has only 4 digits it meets the requirement.\nSo the final number is 46,241 \n\nInput: There were 9, 6, and 4 birds eating from the tree (left to right).

He covers the distance by running at a rate of five meters per second. After stopping three times to catch his breath, how far does he run before he arrives at the park?\n\nAnswer: To solve this problem, we will need to get two equations. One equation will tell us how fast the boy is running and the other equation will tell us how far he has run.\n\nEquation one will be distance= x units/time where: x= how far the boy runs,\ntime= seconds is how long it takes him to run x units.\n\nEquation two will be the speed of the boy: u= units/time where: units or x = how far the boy runs\nand time= seconds is how long its takes him to run x.\n\nThe first step is to plug in for our time for equation one which will give us our x units.\nwe will be using 1.5 seconds as our time for this exercise. The distance he runs will equal 30 meters, so when we plug in 1.5 for our time, x = 30.\n\nPlugging in our x=30 meters for equation two will give us our u= 20 meters/second which is how fast the running boy is going.\n\nLast step is to apply this information to the question. In 1.5 seconds he will run 20 meters, he must cover the distance to his bus stop in 1.5 seconds which means that he needs to run 32 meters\nSo the answer to this problem is that he will have to run 32 more meters for every 1.5 seconds that he wants to have left to get to his bus on time.\n\nInput: Can you count the number of times a square on the grid is coloured?

Schools and libraries have printers so Bill can go in a building other than an apartment, office or gym\nBill then realized that only gyms have printer, so apartments, office buildings and schoolrooms all have printers.\nNow Schoolrooms have printers and are also a great place for doing homework, and most have desks so it is in fact a schoolroom.\nOffice buildings, apartments, libraries and gyms all have printers so it must be anywhere that has printers\nThere can be no other building in which a desk may be located rather than anywhere that has printers or desks\nSo Bill found that you can only find desks at schools, offices, libraries and homes.\nSo the correct answer is schoolroom\n\nInput:What would you call a person who can do multiple things at the same time?

{"idx": 776, "text": "The answer choices don't fit well into John's hangup as they can all be part of having sex.  But the answer choices give us the answers we can substitute in to figure out the solution.  If all of the answers choices are what John wanted to have, it means that he enjoyed procreating.  We need to find an expression that John doesn't want, and use it in a correct way to get the solution.  \"to be\" refers to \"want\", so substitute it out.  \"orgam\" is from the option A.  \"cum\" is from the option B.  \"naked\" is from the option C.  The only one remaining is \"in bed\", which is in the option D.  Then substitute the answer expression to get the proper expression, then use a number to replace the expression.  Let's say \"in bed\" means what John doesn't want to be.  If that is the case, then John would be in bed if he was orgasm, cum, naked, or wearing his birthday clothing.  To sum up, the key is to substitute in choice 1 (A), choice 2 (B), choice 3 (C), and choice 4 (D), respectively for the proper answers to replace what John doesn't desire to be.  Then substitute those choices with a number such as \"1\" to determine if the options satisfy John's hang up.  We would get John was cumming in bed for the expression \"i was cumming in bed\" in order to determine that the expression satisfies John's hang up if the expression equals to 1.  Let's see what happens: i was: i=1 was: was=1 cumming: cumming=1 in and bed: in and bed=1 in and bed=1 cumming in and bed: cumming in and bed=1 John was cumming in and bed because it is true to fulfill what John desires to have.  So, the hangup is that John doesn't like to be \"cumming in and bed\" so he is not enjoying being procreating.\nSo the final number is 1", "answer": "C: naked"}

The current tank contains 2 gallons of water. If 1 gallon of water contains 100 fish, how many fish are there when the ratio of water to fish is 1:100?\nOutput: This question can be solved by the ratio method of solving proportions.\nThe ratio is 1:1, but after the current ratio of water to fish has multiplied so that the ratio of water to both fish and water is 1:1.\nOnce the fish start to die, the ratio of water to the water they are in turns to 1:1 so the original ratio of water to fish does not change.\nAfter 1 minute, the water will half in volume, meaning that it will contain 2 fish compared to the 1 water.\nThe ratio of fish to water then becomes 1:2 but, because it is the same amount of water in the new tank as was in the old tank, the ratio stays 1:1. In other words, 2 fish remain in the tank.\nAfter 2 more minutes, the tank will contain 1 gallon of half as much water, meaning that it will, once again, contain 2 fish.\nAfter 4 more minutes, the new tank will have 1 gallon of the same amount of water, meaning that it can only contain 2 fish. \nAfter 8 more minutes, the total amount of water will be 1 gallon, meaning that there can only be 1 fish left in the tank.\nThus, after 12 minutes, the ratio of fish to water is exactly 1:1\nSo the final answer to the original question is 100 \u00f7 1 = 100\n\nInput:(5.3)(7.6)(9.8)(13.2)\nOutput: The correct answer is 648.\n\nInput: The average (arithmetic mean) of 4, -2, -8 is 5.\nThe standard deviation of 8, 16 and 25 is 11.54.\nIf the mean distance between two cities is 281 miles, and the standard deviation is 46.8", "answer": "A: humidifier"}

They can locate the building and get to the cloth's.\nThe cloth's have already been labeled with colors and are in cloth bags.\nWe don't know the color we are dealing with at the moment. So we need a place where we can mark them without worry and find them easily. Linen closets are easily accessible and organized, for when you don't know the cloth's color, it is easier to get to them and easily match them to their place.\nSo we put them in the linen closets. The linen closets are on the first floor of the cloth's house.\nWe have to take the cloth's from the third floor and they are labeled and in cloth bags. We do not know the color of the cloths, so the easiest place to store them in is the linen closet where they are organized and easily accessible to match. If we can find the location of the linen closet, we can easily take them to the closet and find them easier to match to their place. They can be found  on the first floor of their house. Apartments and houses do not have linen closets on the first floor if any floor, as it is usually the basement of the house. So it is best for this kind of items to be stored or used on the third floor. There would not be any place where we can easily put these linen like a closet.\nSo the choice is B: kitchen.

It is a place where we store many items that are of small to medium sizes. And it is easily organized by categories of food which makes the items easy to find. It is usually on the first floor, and can easily be found in any house.\nSo we put the cloths in the kitchen or pantry which is on the first floor.\n\nInput: At the grocery you see $14.87 for the milk.

Choices: 10:1 (Calzone is ten times more expensive) A: 10 B: more expensive\nOutput: First find out how much the calzone costs compared to the coke. If it costs $10.40 more than the coke does, then it has to cost less than $10.29 (the difference between the pizza and the coke): $10.4 - $2.24 = $<<10.4-2.24=8.16>>8.16\nNext find out how much the pizza costs compared to the coike: $8.05 - $2.25 = $<<8.05-2.25=5.7>>5.7\nThe calzone cost is less than $10 so the pizza cost must be more expensive: 5.7 > 8.16 => 5.7 >= 8.16 or 5.7 >= $<<8.16>>$8.16\nSince both are integers, 5.7 >=$<<8.16>$8.16 means 5.7 >=8.

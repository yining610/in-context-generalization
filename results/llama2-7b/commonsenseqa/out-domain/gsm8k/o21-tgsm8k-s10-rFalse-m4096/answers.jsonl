The internet can be a useful tool, but make sure not to rely on it too much (especially when on coding competitions). Make sure to challenge yourself and to look for different perspectives. \n \n- *Analysis*: You might want to organize your problem first. Some of them were pretty simple, so you might want to try to separate them. You might also be able to use some algorithms to speed things up. \n \n\n\n### Solution\n\nThis question is pretty simple.

Save it.\n\nThis assignment is a two step assignment.\n\nIn this first step, we want you to create a program to solve the first 10 questions.  You are welcome to use the example C++, Python, or Ruby code for inspiration but you do not need to copy-paste any code.\nThe solution to the problem must be provided at the end of the program, with one solution per line.\n\nOnce you are finished your first step, save both the input and output files.\n\n## Instructions:\nHow to Run Your Program\n\nTo run your code, you will need to type each of the input files into your system's command line or terminal.\n\nFor example, if your files are called inFile.txt (input file) and outfile.txt (output file), then you will need to type:\n\npython infile.txt > outfile.txt\n\nFor the Ruby, you can use irb and\n\nirb -r outFilename.rb\n\nFor the C++ file, you can use the command:\n\n./outfile.cmd\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAll your work will be automatically graded. For the first part, we will give you partial credit for each right answer.\nThe second part will be the code review for the solution you have given, and we will provide feedback for improvements.\n\n## Rubric & Points\n\n|Criteria|Points|\n|:-:|:-:|\n|[Instr] |10 |\n|[Instr2] | 10 |\n|Overall Style | 5|\n|Readme & LICENSE |2 |\n|[CodeW] |3 |\n|[Design] |3 |\n\n### Code Review\n\nYour code review will be based on these elements:\n\n- What were some parts of your program that I liked? Why? Want to learn how to do that?\n- What part of your program was not good? Why?

I thought I had been making dumb simple mistakes at first, but I tried multiple examples and didn't get any results... that's when I went back and started making sure that the code that I was using was correct.\n\nI made sure that every method that I used had the variables correct and I was sure that every if statement was for an if/else statement in case I had missed it. After hours upon hours of going through different questions and trying different things out, I was so over it I almost stopped writing entirely, but I wanted to make sure that I finished.\n\n## Learnings from the Assignment\n\nAs I went through many different questions and tried out multiple things, I realised just how tiresome it was to do that.

E.g. answer of 29 (rounded down) = 30 (rounded up) = 21\n\n#### Part 5\n##### You have to divide the answer by 10, multiply by 100 and subtract the answer from the remainder. E.g. 608/10 = 60 with remainder 5, 608/5 = 121 with 121 = 21, this value is subtracted from the remainder, 21/5 = 4.4, this is subtracted to 5 and the remainder is the solution (2064)\n\n#### Part 6\n##### Calculate to the nearest 10/50\n\n#### Part 7\n##### Subtract the numbers of workers to get the number of hours per person\n\n#### Part 8\n##### Add the number of fluid ounces, e.g. 80 + 80 = 160.\n\n#### Part 9\n##### 36/6/ 1", "answer": "B: generous"}

The major difference between them is that data is a collection of facts (such as \u201cthe price of petrol last week\u201d), whereas information is about facts that need to be processed further (such as about a range of prices, trends, etc.) to give insight about the \u201cunknown\u201d.\n- Next, we discuss the difference between relational and non-relational data sources.

Choices: 1, 5, 10, 20, 30\nOutput: E\n  \n## Solution & Explanation:\n- 05. You multiply both sides by 5 and we get 5 x 5 = 25, where 5 = 5 x 1 and 25 = 5 x2, which means that the two answers are both divisible by 5.\n- 07. 15 x 13 + 6 = 198. This means that you use half of each quantity and so it doesn't matter if you choose a, b, or c as the answer. To find the total, it is better to find the difference between the beginning and ending values and so they should choose e.\n- 12. You double each quantity and then you double the final quantity, which means that the total is twice the starting quantity. That tells us that the answer is f.\n- 15. You would have 24 x 1, where 1 x 4 = 4 and 24 x 2 = 48. This means that the total is the sum of all four fractions, which is also the answer, so the answer is d.\n- 16. This problem is actually similar to the last question, but you have to take 3 times the starting quantity and then add it to the starting quantity. You would have: 14 x 3 + 14 = 63, which means that 63 = e, so the answer is e.\n- 20. You multiply the first figure by the second figure and then you multiply the answer by 5. This tells us that the total of the first multiplier and the answer of the first multiplier is multiplied by the second value. This tells us that a is the answer.\n- 21. You add the value of the first two multipliers to the answer of the third multiplier. Doing so means that if you multiply, you will get: 5 x 4 = 20 and so the total of the first two multiplier plus the last one multiplier is 5 x (4 + 20) = 125.", "answer": "A: battle field"}

The dealer, after shuffling the cards,  divides the cards into two groups,  placing 1 card aside. The player to the dealer's left begins the game by choosing a card. This card is placed on the side.

In the first, the player adds the cards total but takes away any King or Queen card.  In the second the player adds the cards but takes away a Jack.  In the third, the player adds the total but adds a 10.  These scoring methods all apply to either 2 or 4 or 6 players.  If 2 players are playing, they use the first way.

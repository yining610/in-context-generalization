Therefore, the correct answer is  dark colors as shown in the options A and B.\nColor C and F are incorrect because the options for bright colors are listed earlier in the question.\nChoice B, neutral colors, is incorrect because the options for dark colors are listed earlier in this question.\nThe option D, red, is incorrect because the option E, green, is also present in the question and both options need to be accounted for.

For that there has to be a relation between them. This relation could be father and mother or brother and sister or uncle and nephew etc.\nThe race is being held at a school. In the school, there is one principal who can make a decision whether Avi is eligible to win the trophy.\nThe principal takes half of the students' total distance completed as a part of the first leg distance and adds this with Avi's total distance.\nThis way, he subtracts half of the first leg's distance and adds it to the total distance of Avi and then subtracts the total distance and multiplies it by 2 and gets the answer.\nThis process means we know there is no negative number or two negative numbers.\nSo total distance = 20, total distance + half of his distance - half of his distance = 20 - (10 + Bino's distance - Bino's distance = 10)\nAvi wins! You can confirm because Bino's distance is negative which would mean that Avi's distance is positive.\nBino should not win the trophy because he is NOT eligible for it since his distance is negative and Avi's distance isn't negative which means that Avi does not match the requirement of the leg which is he wasn't eligible.\nSo, the final answer is Avi.\n\nInput:A person drives 100km west for 2 hours, 100km south for 4 hours, 60km west for 5 hours and finally drives 50km north for 9 hours.

There are many types of prison facilities for each criminal sentenced to imprisonment but the most common form of imprisonment is incarceration (the imprisonment of a defendant while awaiting trial and, then after being convicted, during sentencing and appeals).\nA jail is usually a short-term imprisonment facility that focuses on pre-trial confinement, while a prison is used as a long-term imprisonment for criminals convicted of felonies. When people go to jail, they\u2019re arrested for breaking the law by committing a crime.\nCriminals in jail break out of places where they have been locked up with other criminals and convicted of breaking the law, usually by stealing things or forcing people to do things. \nSo Jim has a choice from A-F but is given choices A (Jim will go to jail) and B (Jim will go a prison)\nSo Jim will go to jail\nSo the final answer in B\n    \nInput:There is a chessboard, which contains N*N black and white squares.

Choices:  First, you must know that all possible positions are made up of nine face centers.  First you pick a central face and rotate it to turn it around the center.  Second you pick out an edge piece and then you rotate it one way or another to get a new face center to turn.  Once you've rotated the outside pieces, repeat on the edge pieces.  Last, you will need to repeat this for the corner pieces as well.\nOutput: You start by finding the center pieces and then rotate them. The problem is that it's quite easy to rotate the wrong face center. You need to use a cross technique or F2L technique to check if the new corners you've found are the correct corners.\nSo the final correct answer is E\n\nInput:How many hours would a 12 minute movie be if it was viewed at 1.75x the normal speed?\nOutput: A 12 minute video would be viewed at a speed of 1.75 times it's length\nThe length if you were to view at 1.7 x (3600 x 1/5 minutes) = 1.7 x 7200 minutes\nTherefore, it would take 12 x 1.7 = >>12 x 17=228>>228 minute to view the video at that speed\nAlternatively: (in reverse calculation) you can take 228 mins / 1.7\nSo the final correct and correct answer is E", "answer": "A: school"}

Therefore, given a list of addresses, determine if it is possible for them to go from their current point to another in as few turns as possible.  Assumptions are:\n-They have no stops along their routes to pickup food and flowers, respectively.\n-They have no dead ends and do not lose their previous turn information after every turn.\n-They will always start turning by following a left-hand rule.\n-They will only start turning towards a certain direction 3 times in a row, otherwise they will turn back the opposite way, regardless of where they end up.\nThe problem can be represented as a graph.

You just realized that your flight to Honolulu boards in just a few minutes.  In order to board the plane, your ticket allows you to get in line one hour before the flight, or 6:09, whichever comes first.  This does not really work, because each row contains 30 seats.  Therefore, even though you are in line at 6:08, according to the rules of air travel, you cannot sit until everyone that is boarding earlier shows up.  How long will you wait to sit down and eat dinner?\nOutput: Your ticket allows the earliest possible boarding time for that passenger.\nAccording to the ticket, you must board at 6:09. The plane boards about 50 minutes before departure. In order to accommodate all the passengers at that airport, each boarding lane has a capacity of around 75 passengers per 50-minute boarding window.

The first baker only starts making pies if he can't buy a pie for himself, and he stops making pies if sales fall below ten pies sold per day. If the first baker quits making pies, how many more people must visit the city's bakeries each day to support all ten bakers currently working?\nOutput: The city of Pieville has ten bakers, and if the first baker quitts, there are nine bakers. If there are 9 bakers then everyone can support at least 9 pies and it is sufficient that only 9 people buy a pie. Now the first two bakers can support 9 pies each. The third baker can support 9 pines and the fourth one can support 1 piece. In total, the third to ninth bakers can support 10* 4 = 40 pies.\nThat leaves enough people to buy one pie so the 10th baker.\nThis way, a minimum of 10 people buy a pie each day in the city of bakers.

He sent his eldest son to the grandfather's house, while he sent his middle son to the grandmother's house, leaving his youngest son at home. They decided that the grandparents shouldn't see their youngest son's face.\nOutput: The youngest son was supposed to stay home. If only the two eldest sons were sent to their grandfathers and grandmothers, then they can see the youngest son.\nSo if the youngest son was home while only sending the eldest sons, the boys could go to their grandparents, but at the same time, they could not see the youngest son's mug.\nThey decided that the grandchildren shouldn't meet,  but they shouldn't have any regrets that the grandparents don't see the youngest child.\nSo the final choice B is: the child is in front.\n\nInput: There is a circle, and there are 5 points in this circle.

At the first traffic light, we passed the grocery store. The car had a flat tire before we entered the grocery store parking lot. We arrived home just after the traffic lights, as my husband turned off a street, and we passed the park, then before the traffic light, and again we passed the arcade. The library was nowhere to be seen. We passed my house on the way to the arcade.\n\nOutput: The order of events occurred in goes in the order: grocery store - park - arcade - library - house - traffic lights.\nLet the total day time = x\nTime to arrive home = y\nWe passed the park, then parked, then turned off a street to arrive home. We left the park after the traffic light.\ntime travelled = x - y\ntime passed at the park = x - ((y-x))\ntime spent at the library = x - (x - ((y - x))\nSo time spent at the arcade = x - (((x - (x - (( y - x)))+ x - ( ((y - x)))) = (( x - ( y - x)))+  x - (( (y - x)) + (x - (z - x)))))\ntime spend arriving at home = y-(( x - (( (( y - x)) + ( x - ((( (( y - x)\n+ ((x - (z - ( y - x))", "answer": "A: shelf"}

What year did he become 56 years old?\nOutput: His age in 170 is 51-70. Let t be his age.\nSo his age in 198 is t-18\nTaking 18 as constant for both the years, his age in 171 is 51 + (t - t - 18)\nSubtracting t from both sides, gives 51 = (t - 26)\nSo his age is 51-26 = <<51-26=25>>25.\nHis age is 25 both in 171 and 198.\nSince 25- 7 is 18 which is the same as he had in 198, he stays the same age till 2052.\nSo the age is 51 or 25 depending on how the year 251 came.\nIn that case, the age is 56 since 7 comes before t.\nSo the final age is 56.\n\nInput: John took a photo to his grandmother with the birthday cake before her birthday.

How much does a peck of fruit cost?\nOutput:We can find the total cost of apples if we multiply $90 for all three:\n$90 * 90/100$ = $<<90*90/10=810>>810\nSo the total cost for all apples is $810 (if we round it up to the nearest dollar it is $810)\nSimilarly, we find the cost of pears if we multiply $91 * 90/90$:\n$90 * <<(91*90)/90=851>>851\nSo the total cost of pears is $851\nNow for the cost of bananas, we need to find the cost of one banana:\n$65/(55*10) = <<65/55*10=11>>1\nSo the $65 = <<1*65=65>>65 cost of bananas is $65\n\nNow let's just add those three costs. It can be done as follows:\n$810 + $851 + $65 = $<<810+851+65=1736>>1736\nThe total cost of a peck of fruit is $1736\nSo the final answer to the question is the last one: $1736.\n\nOutput:Let x= the total value of bills left in Jessa's pocket\nTherefore Geric has 15*8 = <<15*8=120>>120 left.\nSo, we find that Geric has: 1*15 + 15*8 + 120 + 1 = <<1*15+15*8+120+1=140>>140 bills\n\nOutput:Let number of years be represented by 'y'\n2 \u21d2 15y/5", "answer": "D: cupboard"}

A cow gets half as much as the bird, a horse needs 10 times as much, and a pig needs 100 times as much.  Given 6 apples is how many apples for each animal?\nOutput: We know that 6 apples is the amount that the bird needs per day. If we multiply the amount the bird needs per day by the number of days in a year, we find that the bird eats 182 apples a day. Now we multiply the bird's number of apples per day by the number animals per year, so the bird gets 182 appples per year, the cow will gets 37 apples per year, the horse will gets 302 apples per year, and the pig will gets 3019 apples per year.\nSo the final answers are 37, 302, 3019, 182\n\nInput: When is the first time you have done both of the following, within the same month?

{"idx": 263, "text": "The correct answer is E. When we breathe, the air we consume contains traces of the air we previously left behind. These traces are known as isotopes. A single person's body leaves around 25,000 parts per million (ppm) of 12-carbon carbon dioxide isotopes behind each day and, if breathed by 800 other people, this carbon dioxide could create a detectable trace (0.02 ppm) in the Earth's atmosphere. This means that a person could breathe in the atmosphere that another 800 people have recently left behind.  The atmosphere at the surface of the Earth is made up of gases that have been cycled through the atmosphere throughout Earth's history.\nTherefore, the best place to find air breathed by relatively few people is on the surface of Earth.\nSo the final is E\n\nInput:An old man found 2 kings.

Leonardo's genius, despite making a significant contribution to the Italian Renaissance and the Foundations of the modern era, was largely ignored, and even dismissed, during his lifetime. Leonardo is widely considered the most diversely talented person ever to have lived, and he is often referred to as the epitome of the \"Renaissance Man\". Leonardo da Vinci was born with a strong attachment to nature, which was his greatest inspiration. He is described as having had a remarkable fascination with biology and botany. Da Vinci's most notable biological contribution was his invention of an anatomically correct, mechanically operated model of the human body \u2013 in particular that of the heart. When in Rome, da Vinci visited the grave of the musician and poet Lorenzo il Magnifico in a cemetery off the south side of the Church of San Andrea della Valle. The remains in the cemetery, with the exception of those of Lorenzo il Magnifico, had been moved to the more attractive and prominent locations of the church itself several hundred years earlier. As a patron of the arts himself, Da Vinci was not impressed with Lorenzo's monument. So impressed was he, he took the initiative to erect a new one in the cemetery for himself, the cost of which ultimately came from his patron the duke of Milan. This monument, in the cemetery, still bears his name to this day as the Il Monumento di Leonardo. Da Vinci'S monument in the Church of San Andrea dello Valle displays his portrait bust made by Baccio Bandinelli, along with a number of his studies for the Sistine Chapel decorations.

Then if you subtract 1 day from it you get 31 hours.\nSo if you subtract 31 hours from 1 day you get 29 hours and 59  minutes.\nSo if you keep subtracting 1 hour for each -31 then you get 0 hours and it takes 1 day subtracted 33 times for it equals to the answer of exactly 4 days before.\nSo 0 hours to be exact subtracted 33 (from 1 day i.e.33 days of subtraction) it equals 1 day and 23 hours. 1 day and 9 hours from the final day is 23 hours away.\nBecause 23 is subtracted from 64 you get -41  which is less than 1 day and so the answer is 40 hours subtracted 41 hours and you get -1 hour which is -1 day and 40 hours subtracting 1 equals -1 day.\nSo the final day and 41 hours subtracted 1 equals 2 days, 6 hours and 2 minutes subtracting 6 hours equals 2 days and 6 hours.\nSo the only answer which makes sense is 2 Days and 6 hours because that\u2019s the answer after subtracting 1 day subtract", "answer": "A: kitchen"}

R-(R-Y)!... 1! ] ways to decide the cards that will be present.\nThen, there are ways for each color to have the chance to \"die\" at each card drawn in the sample space.\nTherefore the answer is R*[0!R-1!R-2!...R-(Y-1)!Y-1!R-(R-Y)!1!...1!2!1!1!0!0!...0!2!1!...]\nWe are only interested in the color of the first card drawn, and for the rest of the cards to have the same probability.\nTo this end, we are only interested in the first and second terms in the R*[...0!

What was the initial price of rice if the last price of rice was $10?\nOutput: The problem states that the first price was $10, which was after a 50% cut, the new price was $10 x 2, or $20. Now, this is what we'll use to solve for the price of the 5 day mark. $20 x 2 = $<<20*2=40>>4o Now, we subtract the final price of $10 x 0.5 = $<<10*0.5=5>>5 from the $40, which leaves us with $35. This is the price of the initial mark after 5 days of cutting. So, the price of the rice is $10 x 1.5 = $<<20.5>>25.50\nSo the final price of rice is $25.50 for 1kg.\n\nInput:You purchase your meals at an average of $21.53 per week.

What does this statement mean?\nOutput: When A is 25% off, that means we're discounting A by 25%.\nWhen A is 50% off, that means A is discounted by 50%\nFrom that, we can deduce that A is discounted from $1.10 to 0.39 cents.\nFrom that deduction, we can find the original price of A if we were not discounting it. $1.10 - 0.39 = $<<1.10-0.39=0.71>>0.71.\nSo A is 71 cents.\nWhen A is 15% off, that's 15/100 * 0.71 = 0.10555\nSubtracting from and adding 1, 0.71/0.105 = 6.7 (round up)\n$3.30 - 0.71 - 0.10 = $<<3.30-0.71-0.10=2.59>>2.59\nSo B is originally 2.59.\nSo A =.71 (0.71 *.71 = =71)\nB = 2.59 (2.59 * 2.59 = 6.7)\nSo the original price of A and B were 6.7 and 6.59, respectively.\n\nInput: There was a boy whose mother has a", "answer": "C: store"}

Given these conditions, what is the probability that it will be sunny on two consecutive days?\nOutput: Since there is 90% probability that both days will be cloudy, we must first find the probability that two cloudy days occur consecutively.\nSo cloudy tomorrow: 1-(probability) = 0.95 chance of cloudy tomorrow\nCloudy day after cloudy day: 0.90*0.95 = <<0.90*95=85>> 85 percent chance of cloudy day after cloudy days.\nSo today and tomorrow with the probability of cloudy = cloudy tomorrow(0.95x0.90) + cloudy day after cloud days (0.15x0.95)\n0.95x 0.90+ 0.15x 0.05 - 0.0026\n0.95 x 0.95 + 0.15 x 0.1\n0.90+0.14 = <<0.9+0.14>=1.34>>1.34\n1.34 \u2013 0.00026\n1.34-0.000034\n1.00034=<<1.0000+0", "answer": "D: sporting goods store"}

It reached its destination, and landed, at 7:00pm.  What was the plane's average rate of ascent, in meters per second?\nOutput:The plane was traveling 1200 km away after 6 hours, meaning that the plane was moving 200 km/hr over the 6 hour duration of the flight, or travelling 33km per hour. So the average speed was 33km/hr.\nTime spent flying at altitude was 3 hours (6 total time, 200 +6 = 6 +6 = 12)\nDistance travelled at altitude was 1200/3 = <<1200/4=300>>30o\nTime in air was 6 * 300 = <<6*300=18>>1\nTime in air at ground speed was 6 * (1200/6) = 1200 / 6 = <<120*3=40>>4\nDistance travelled at ground speed was 400/200*3 = <<2*40=80>>80\nElapsed time at ground was 1+8+8+4 = 21 total time 3 * 21 = 63 distance at ground was 80, time travelled at ground was 63 / 80 = 120 time the grounded airplane travelled for 1 hour at altitude = 6 * (1+8+4) = (1, 12, 1) = 7, which is not a whole minute.\nSo the average rate of ascent was (80/200 * 6) * (1/8) which is 8/5 = <<8/5=16>>l.\nSo the final average rate of ascent = 33km/", "answer": "B: entertainment"}
{"idx": 588, "text": "First let's look at the logical answer here.  Since all the seats are \"full\" no one is in the vehicle, therefore it is a safe idea to place the bag of items in a place (mostly) outside of the vehicle.\n\nWe can narrow down the choices to be A, E, or B just like this.  A: roof = \"outside of vehicle\"\n\nE: home = \"outside of the vehicle\"\n\nB: car trunk = \"outside of an area in the vehicle\"\n\nFor the sake of the algorithm we are just going to put all the remaining choices into the \"Outside of vehicle\" category, which we will refer to as 'O'.  This is a useful trick for algorithms that use a series of either/or answers, the one time you need to split up the answer space you have this option to put them all in a category, which makes the choice of the actual choice of which to pick a lot easier since it's not multiple choice.\n\nSo our choices now become: A, E, C, and O.  The next part we could look at is what are the characteristics of the places that we put the answers in.  The thing to consider is that if we pick something in our \"outside of vehicle space\" we cannot choose anything that is in the vehicle itself, ie. a car trunk, or the car itself since we picked something outside (we could always put the bag in the storage cabinet inside the car).\n\nSimilarly, if we choose something in the \"inside of vehicle space\" we don't have the option of picking anything from the \"Outside of Vehicle\" Spaces.  From the answers we have: A: roof, B: car trunk, and C: home.  These are all in the \"inside of the vehicle space.\"  These make a subset of choices in the Outside of vehicle space.  C is a subset of A (C is inside while A is outside) and B is a subset of C (B is in the vehicle, while C is outside of the vehicle).  C is another logical option from that subset, but the logical choice is to put the bag in the car, since it is inside you vehicle.  This gives us our choice which is A.\nSo the final choice is A\n\nInput: Daisy is a dog who can count at least to three. D", "answer": "C: car trunk"}

Then you just write the number of the cube you just finished working with.

However, it can be quite tiring for a parent to deal with one, especially if it happens when the parent is tired themselves.\nSo, parents will often try their best to ignore them and not provide the attention that the child is seeking.\nSo, even if the child cries, is screaming or is throwing tantrums, the solution is to ignore. This can only be done when the parent feels mentally or physically ready, such as when they have had a good night\u2019s sleep.\nIt should be noted that a child\u2019s crying or even screaming can be tiring itself. This is why it is important to keep pausing and taking a break from time to time.\n\nInput: You want to see a show, but there is one part in the play that contains coarse language and sexual innuendos, but it would be disrespectful not to watch it.

Choicces:  A: 4 B: 1 C: 0.66 D: 0.33 E: 0.5\nOutput: Mario bought a bag for 1/15 $= 0.066$ or 6.6 cents and a loaf bread for 1/3 $= 0.33$ or 33 cents. He had $0.33 $=33 cents and then he bought a bag and loaf of bread and he received change of the order of 6.6 cnts, 3.0 cnts, and 0.03 cents from the sale. So the sales was 33 cents minus 15 cents minus 12.3 cents and so this left Mario with 0.036 cents. 0.03 is 1/3 of a ct.  And since he received 1/3 of change after he received his items he therefore received 0.03 in change.\nSo the final choice is E.\n\nInput : What comes next? : 5 16 36\n      |  1 2 3\n      |  4 5 6\n      | .\n4:\nSo the final answer choice is 7.\n\nInput : 14 21 26 14\n    |   4 5  6\n    |   6 7  7\n    |  8 9  9\n1:\nSo the final choice choice is 4.\n\nInput\n\"C: There are 5 apples in all - 2 of them are shiny; find out if i have 1 shiny apple.

The company has 50 gift packages to send. If every customer got a gift package, how many gifts would the company have to give away to make up for the leftover packages?\nOutput:  The company has 52 gifts and 48 customers. It gives 2 gifts per gift package so there are 28 customers that get a gift.\nThe customers that didn't get a gift also bought a product at the rate of 12 per package.\nA total of 7 (customers who bought products and didn't get gifts) * 12 = 84 more products were sold.\nTherefore, the company should sell 58 products.\nSo the final amount of packages is 52 + 58 = <<52+58=110>>110 packages.\nSo the final answers are 110 packages\n\nInput:A shopkeeper sold 10 t-shirts 40% better than she bought them and sold the remaining t-shirts in her shop in which she made a profit of 50%.

And what do they talk about if they do talk?\n\n(D) In the case where we're discussing writing stories, what's even more likely to happen in one of the more likely hypotheses, is that the starving people sit around in despair, being unable to find any food and without a way of communicating with someone that is able to provide them with sufficient food. Hence they'll likely talk to nobody so long as they've got nothing to say.\n\n(E) This question would only be answerable if starvation was one of the things that humans would die of as a natural phenomenon (like, the human race is naturally dying due to having not enough food).\nSo let's break it down into its most basic logical concepts.\nIf the starving human's options of survival are fish (A), then they won't die.\nIf their options aren't the fish, then they're not eating, and hence dying (E).\nHowever, if their options aren't limited to the fish (B and D), then there's a chance that they'll steal enough money to buy food and hence won't die (B).\n\nSo the answer to this question is (D)\n\nInput: How does the author know that there are 47 kings?

{"idx": 807, "text": "First step: Let us choose the two words that are against each other. In this case, it is \"not\" and \"need to\".\nAfter that, we need to determine the word that is against the second word after these words are grouped together. In this case, \"run\" and \"after\" are against each other.\nSo our final group of words reads \"[the second word] [the first word] [the last word] {the third word]\".\nNow, we are ready to pick a matching vowel that follows our new set of words.\nStarting with our first grouped word, let us say we took the letter \"not\", which is a consonant.\nIt is an English major convention to go down until you find the first vowel letter that you see while reading the string.\nThen you move on to the next group of words and repeat the process.\nIn this case, the first letter is an \"R\". So, we continue to the next group of letters, which are \"ball\". There is a \"B\", so I skip down to the end of \"ball\" and pick the next letter at the end, which is an \"L\", since we have already found our first vowel.\nRepeating this process, we eventually get to the letter \"T\". Now, the entire string reads \"[ball] [not] [run] [after] [not] [fat] [need]\", but the final result is the string \"nFnatb\" since vowels come before consonants.\nSo, the final answer is \"nFnatb\".\n\nInput: The following are values for each of the angles in a pie - 0.092, 1.56, 0.192 as radians.

Choices:  a: yes b: no c: it depends on the triangle  d: unknown\nOutput: A: The area of a triangle can be found directly by knowing the triangle's base and height. But, the formula (ab)/2 works only if we are given the sides and their respective measures, that is, if we have a right angle triangle.  B: If we have to find the area of an irregular triangle, we use the formula 1/2(a+b+c), regardless of what the lengths of the sides are. (In the triangle a, b, c there is no right angular)  C: The base and height of a triangle will not always result in a product, as they might be sides that are parallel. The sides or the sum of the triangle can differ from the base and height because the total base is the sum of the base of the triangle.  D:  For an area, the sides are equal to half of the total surface area.  So the final answer is A\n\nInput: You have three bowls.

Divide 2/3 and 1/2 to get the amount of apples needed. That is 4/6 or 2/3; since 2/3 of all the apples are spent buying half the pears, you can conclude that 2/3 of 4/6 apples is 2/6 apples. Add that to 1/2 of all the pears to get 1/6 + 1/2 = 2/3 peaches. Now we need to replace the amount of peaches with the amount of peaches in the question. The part in parentheses asks you to find 2/5 of 1/2 of whatever amount you need. If your example gives you 2/3 peach, then you have 4/3 of the peaches or 2/3 of your answer to find the amount they used to buy half the pears. So if you need 1/2 of 2/3 pecks of pears, then you need 2/6 + 1, that is 3/6 + 1 or 2/5.\n\nInput: A bird eats 20% of its own body weight every day.

If the second boy is 1.2 kilograms, how much does the last child weigh?\nOutput: From the definition of 1 liter, a liter = 1,000 ml. If we consider the volume of 1 ml to be 1 / 1,00,000, we are left with 1/1,000th of a liter.\nSince there are 1,001 ml in a liter and we also want the child to drink at least 200 ml per minute, we need to fill 200  / 1000 = 0.2 liters every hour.\nSo in one hour:\n200 / 1,0 = <<20*1,0=20>>\n\n1 / 1,100 = << 20/1,00 = 0,2>> * 0,2 = 0,4.\nBy that definition, we can say that a child weighs between 0.4 and 0.6 kg and is thus between 250 g and 280 g.\nThe last child weight will be between 0.35 and 0.5 kg.\nSo the final weight will be between 350 g and 450 g.", "answer": "B: appear beautiful"}

How long must she walk?\nOutput: Since the trains leave 3 hours and 30 minutes apart, they must have the same total speed to be able to pass each other 3 times.\nThe 10:50pm train leaves at 10:55pm which leaves 0:10pm on the hour, so its speed is 30mph/60mph=<<30*60=1800>>1800\nThe 4:15 am train leaves the station at 4:55 am which leaves 3:00pm on the hour and 5:00pm on quarter hours, so its speed is (15mph/45mph)=<<15*60=900/60=>>15 mph, so she has two choices\nIf we take the 10:01am train, she would have to walk for (22 mins * 1 hours / 35 min) = 4 minutes 22 seconds, so it'd take 5:22\nIf we take the first train, the 7:50 am train, she would have (22 mins*1.128571428571 = 25 mins 45 seconds), and so it would take 11:45\nBut if we add those numbers, it gives us 11:17 + 5:22 = 16:39\nAnd if we add those numbers and the difference it gives us a round time of 16", "answer": "D: cleanliness"}

{"idx": 958, "text": "Answer: D\nExplanation:\nIt's a trick question. Olives are covered in a waxy film to protect themselves from moisture and air. Olives won't get wet if they are in a sealed glass or jar. But, refrigeration doesn't work because olive oil can go rancid. It's not recommended to eat olives that are rancid, so olives in the fridge shouldn't be left there for too long.\n\nInput: A company's sales declined 55% from year to year.

We will only sell enough Phlox for the total number of Ephemeral plants sold. However, what percentage of Ephemeral sales do we lose if we sell a bunch of Phlox and we don't make enough money to run our nursery?\nOutput: We sell 4 Phlox per Ephemeral plant, so we lose $400/P = (4*$5)*0.25, where $5 is the price of Phlox and 0.25 is 1/4 lost in Phlox sales (since we sell 4 Phloxes for each Ephemeral plant). This is the equivalent of $400 / 4 = $<<400/4=100>>$10", "answer": "C: jar"}

However, the shirt seems too small for you. You would like to see if the size fits by using the shirt's tag. You discover its tag was lost years ago, but you're sure it's somewhere in your closet. Suppose it takes you 2 minutes to search through a drawer, 4 minutes to check one shelf, and 21 minutes to search the entire closet. Searching an entire room takes 100 times longer than searching a drawer and 10 times longer than searching one shelf.

Diagonal lines are those which do not meet up at the base, however lines could be placed to form four different categories called horizontal, vertical, oblique (diagonal), and parallel.\nOutput: Lines are sometimes categorized into two basic categories - vertical lines, which run from top to bottom (up and down), and horizontal lines, which run from left to right (side to side).\nBoth horizontal and vertical lines are called 1D (one-dimensional  because they exist in two dimensions). Lines that are neither horizontal nor vertical fall into other categories called oblique and parallel because they don\u2019t run parallel to, or perpendicular to, one another.\nSo, all lines are 1D, but not all lines are vertical or horizontal.\nSo the final was D\n\nInput: A survey asked students who ate meat how many minutes every week they ate meat and the students could choose more than one option.

There are 12 management employees and 23 non-management employees. What is the percentage change of Tiffany\u2019s employees to non-management if she hired 2 new employees?\nOutput: This is a simple percentage change question, so we have our base data that we want to alter, which is 23.\nThen we have to find the change in a percentage that we want.\nIn this question it is a 1% change in the number of non-management employees.\nIn all percentage changes, you will have to multiply the amount of non-management employees by the change.\nIn this case, it will be ((23*100)/35) %\nSince there are now 25% more management employees, the new percentage change is 125/23 = <<125/22=5>>5.\nSo the final percentage change is 5.\n\nInput:There are a total of 5796000 people living in New York. 90% of these people live in New York City.

The gas tank capacity is 19 gallons. How many times do you need to fill your tank?\nOutput: In the first round, you fill the tank to 4/9 full. You travel 4/9 = <<4/9=0.44>>0.44 miles that round. In the second round, you fill the gas tank completely. In this round you travel 9 miles, for the remaining journey, you will travel 9-0.44=<<9-0.4=8.56>>8.56 miles. In the third round, you fill your tank 4/9 full again. You therefore travel 0.44+8.56=<<0.44+0.856=0.10>>0.10 miles. You always use 4/9 of the tank before filling it. Therefore, you will travel 0.10 + 0.10 x 9 =<<0.10+0.1=0.109>>0.109 miles in the final round. In total, it takes nine rounds to get you there.\nSo the final step is 0.109\n\nInput:A group of archaeologists believe they have found the final resting place of 1000 warriors in ancient Egypt.

How many weeks can each friend continue without running out of money?\nOutput: The amount of their allowance (3.50) decreases by 0.32 each week (32 cents). So if the allowed amount is x and the amount of money lost to gum each week is y, the equation 3.50 - 0.32*x = y would describe the spending pattern.\nNow, let x be the allowed amount and y be the amount lost to gum, so 3.50 = x - 0.3 2*x. Then 0.32/x = y, so x/1.42 = y. Solve for x and y. \nIn fact, x/1.4 = y is simpler to work with, yielding 0.4 = y when x is 3.50, so let x = 3.5 and y = 0.4 (which is approximately 12 cents).\nIn terms of weeks, how many weeks will that allowance last? \n100+x = (100/4 + 1) and 100+3.5 = 137.5, so x = 137 and x/100 = 137/100 = y = 1.37.\nIn terms of the weeks, the friends can survive on their allowance for x/100 weeks, or about 1.37 years, which isn't too bad!\nSo the final answer will be 1.37\n\nInput: If a bookstore receives 10% off for buying in bulk and has 20 copies of a book left in stock, how\nmuch does it cost the store to order one of those books, in dollars?

The tax is $1.5 + $0.5=<<1.5+0.5=2>>2 dollars per book.\nThe shipping is $1.2, meaning that the total cost is $3.2 per book.\nThe imported book is less expensive because the cost is:\n18.4-3.9 = <<18.4-2.2=16.2>>16.2US$.\nTherefore it costs less for a book that costs $8.4.\nSo the final cost is 5.4\n\nInput: An automobile factory made 2,780 cars in January and then 3,100 more cars were produced in February at the same factory.

It is the result of stress on the body, which is sometimes psychological. The most common fatigue is that which is related to aging. You have probably noticed that your body does not seem to have the same energy that it once had. In fact, this may be the result of low iron in the diet. Some people find that taking vitamin supplements helps them feel less fatigued. Some of the factors that may lead to fatigue are psychological.  There are many reasons that people experience excessive fatigue and they are generally related to stress or depression.  \nAnemia, or low iron in the body, also affects the way people think and feel.  If you are feeling lethargic, your thoughts and emotions can be adversely affected. This in turn can lead to fatigue.\nIn some cases, fatigue can be treated with vitamin B12 supplements. While many individuals turn to coffee, energy drinks and other stimulants to help them through their day, these only act as short-term fixes.  In fact, these stimulants might mask symptoms of underlying problems that are preventing you from having the energy you need.  \nSometimes the best remedy for fatigue is to address the problem that is causing it.  Stress and other underlying problems are best addressed by a medical professional. Once the problem has been treated, you will likely be able to regain your strength without any supplements.\nSo the final answers is", "answer": "A: addiction"}

What is the likelihood that it will win first prize?\nOutput: The dog show is a winner takes all contest so there is a 1 in N likelhood that the winner is chosen.\nThe number N represents the odds of 1 in (1 in N) = <<(1 in N)>>N\nThus there is a (1 in (1 in (1/4)) = <<(1 in (1/2))>>1/4 chance that the winner will be chosen.\nEssentially N becomes N = <<(1 in 1/4)>>1/4.\nSolving the equation shows that (1 in 1/12 )= <<1/4>>1/4.  This means that the dog that wins first prize is the 1 in (1/(1/12 )) = <<1/12>>12th dog that was picked.\nThe dog show has 14 entries and there are only 12 dogs so the likelihood that a dog will win is calculated as a 11/(12*11) = <<12/125>>12/12 chance.  This corresponds with 1/4 = <<1/4>>25% chance.\n\nSo what is the final answer?\n(1 in 12) + (1 in 25) + (1 in50) + (1 in100) + (1/4) = 1.\n\nThus, 1/1 + 1/4 + 1/(4+4+4+4) = 1/4\nSo the final answer could be 1 or \u00bc for the probability of winning first prize in a dog show.\n\nInput: A 37-gallon plastic water container is 92 inches long,", "answer": "D: petting zoo"}

How do the players score more points for catching a ball than for handling it?\nOutput:If a team member can catch a ball, they get 10 points for that, if they can\u2019t, they can handle it and get 15 points.\nThe two players who can catch get 10 + 15 = 25 points each, but the third player who can only handle gets 0 points, because he wasn\u2019t able to catch anything.\nTherefore, it is easier to get the 10 points for a catch, while the 15 points of a handled ball are higher.\nSo the final statement is \u201cIt\u2019s easier to get 10 points, but better scoring is 15 points.\u201d\n\nInput: There are 4 people who play music. Each one plays an instrument. But only 2 can play a flute and each can play a different note. One can play any two different notes. One can play any 3 different notes and the last one can play every other different note. How many different kinds of songs can they play altogether?\nOutput:The first two only have two notes, the other two have three different notes.\nIf every other different note is another note, then there are 13 different notes. If a different note = a note played by the second person then there are 12 different notes. If a flute note is two notes then there are 6 different note and there are 24 different notes.\nThe total amount of different songs they can produce is then 24 * 13 = <<24*13=302>>302\nSo the final statement to the question is \u201c457\u201d\n\nInput: In order to find out whether a given prime number is", "answer": "C: fast"}

You were both wrong. How much did you weigh and how old were you when I was born?\u201d What is the possible answer to the boy\u2019s question?\nOutput: The son asks again for his father\u2019s answer to a weight/age question. So the father can\u2019t say anything else. It turns out that he was 24 and half years old (1 month * 24 years) when his son was born. At that moment his son was around 9 months old. So the son was 9 months + 24 and half = 35 months and 20 days old. So the boy asks the question.  The son was three and half years old (0.5 years). And his father must have had at least: (365 days)/(3 years + 1 month) = <<(365/3)=1220>>1220 pounds. But as the father was weighing a feather, it must have been less. We can conclude that at least 1,150 pounds. The son asks again for the father \u2018 s answer, asking him for the father\u2019s answer to the weight/age question. Therefore, the father can\u2019t give any other answer.  In the beginning, the son was a nine month old boy so the son\u2019s father was 24 years old and a half when the son was born.  So the weight of his son was (365 days)* (9-month old baby) =", "answer": "E: mail box"}

It rains for a total of 4 hours. What is your chance it will rain on a given day?\nOutput: Rain can only occur for a certain length of time.\nLet t be the certain length of time.  The time is 3 times the total time, 4 hours.  Thus, t = <<12>>12, we are then trying to get from 360 to 450 by dividing x into t.  Then we multiply x by t to get that to 12.\nSo to calculate the probability it's raining, which is equivalent to dividing x = 360 into t=12, giving us 30\nThen it rains in 30 minutes for 4 hours long for a total of 120 minutes.\nThen in the case of t = 120, we have that for 1 whole hour there is no rain and for any fraction of an hour, we are having rain.\nFor x = 120 and y=360,\n3 x y = x + y - 360\n3 x 655 = 655 + 655 - 360.\n656 + 654 = 655\nSo x = 655 for 100% likelihood of rain and y = 360\nSo the final probability of rain is 375%.\n\nInput: What were you doing at 2 pm today?

How far can he see?\nOutput: 100 meters away\nThere is no closer sight because of refraction.  Refraction is because the air is warm in the Summer time and is cooler in the Winter time.  That causes the air to heat up and makes it lighter.  When light bends it is called refraction.\nAnd with that thought, how can we tell what the distance is?\nSince it is dark, we use a red light bulb to shine a flash light.  That way if the person can see the red light bulb from the first sight then they can see 103-13 = <<103-12=91>>91 meters away.\nThen for the 200-4=<<200-32=168>>168 meters we need to make sure the person is squinting their eyes.

The smallest pebble is 1 meter long and 1 meter wide and the largest pebble is three times as big as the smallest pebble. What is the diameter of L in meters?\nOutput: Since each pebble that is part of the L has to be larger in order from smallest to largest, the diameters of the two pebbles are twice each other's width.\nTherefore, since the smallest pebble is one meter long, it is also one meter wide. Since the pebble is also 1 meter long, it is twice as long as it is wide.\nAlso, the largest pebble it is three times as long as it is long as it is wide, so its diameters are six meters apart.\nThe width of the largest pebble and the width of the smallest pebble would need to add up to 7 meters in order to form a complete L formation. The diameters of the pebbles need to add up to ten times the diameter of the smallest pebbles or 10 meters apart.\nTherefore,\nThe diameter of each pebble is 5 meters.\nTherefore, L's diameter is 6 times the smallest pebble's width in order to form an L shaped line.

If 840 singers sing a song together, how many of each type of student sang in the song?\nOutput: \nFrom the question we know the following:\nThere are 840 singlers singing a song.\nSince there are basketball players, singers and mathematicians in the song,\nIf 840 singless sang together, we know that the number of basketball players=1/8*840 = <<1/8*820=105>>105 singers.\nLikewise, the number of basketball players + the number of singers + the number of mathematicians = 1005. Thus\n1005 is the total number of singers in the song.\nNow we are left to only find the number of each type of singler in the song.\nAs there are 840 of each type of singers,\nWe have the following equation\n840 + 105 + 840 = 1890 where 1890 is the total number of students + the number of each type singler.\nFrom here we can find the total number of basketball players and mathematicians as\n105+1890-105 = 1895-105 = <<105+1055-105=1900>>1900 total number of singlers,\n1900-1890 =", "answer": "D: underground"}

So 4/18=<<4/18=0.22>>0.22 groups out of 5 total groups.\nHere is how it works:\nYou select the first few boys. You can pick any 6 boys, it is the same.\nHowever there is no way to select exactly 6 boys in 3 groups.\nThe next 3 out of 10 girls.\nThen pick out 2 more boys and then a girl.\nThus each girl is paired with a boy, the last one is alone.\n\nSo 2 more boys, 10 girls,\nand then you don't need to pick all girls because the 6th boy already is picked.\nSo 4 boys and 10 girls = 4/10 = <<4/10=0.4>>0.4\nSo there only are 4 groups, among them only one group have exactly 6 boys.\nSo the final groups you can get is {1,1,0} in 1 group, {1,0,1} in 2 groups, {0,1,1} in 1 group.\nTotal of 3 groups out of 5.\n\nInput: There are only 10 marbles in your cup.

For me, lightbulbs don;t come into that. The only bathrooms I know of who have their own lighting are the ones like an airplane bathroom or the ones on a ship. And in that case, if you're at the airport or at sea, you're not likely to be there long enough to need to make the lighting comfortable.\nTherefore, lightbulbs are not relevant to thinking about the bathroom.\nIn a home bathroom, you rarely have to change the lightbulbs.

The plane can hold 16 people and carries 300 pounds of cargo.   If the group wants to stay for 7 days, how much food can the plane carry?\nOutput: There are 16 people in the group and each person eats 300 pounds per day. Therefore, 1+2+4+8+16 = <<1+2+4=20>>2 pounds per day.\nThere are two options:\n1.   20 pounds per person per day (the group decides to send someone extra)\n2.   40 pounds per person per week (the group decides not to send anyone extra).\nTherefore, the group will send 16 x 3 = <<16 * 3 = 48>>48 pounds per week.\nLet w be the amount of food in pounds.\n(This will help us get our answer the second time, as we can use this to make the answer more clear. There will not be changes in terms of our answer.)\nIf r (remaining amount in pounds) = w, then after the group sends 48 per week for 7 weeks, the remaining amount in pounds is 48*7 = <<48*7=336>>336, and after sending (336/r) for the 7 weeks, the group needs 336 r / 7 = <<336/7=48>>48 more pounds of food to finish in the last week.\nTo make the remainder equal to zero, the group needs to send 48 more pounds for the 7 week. This is because after the 7 weeks, 336 - 48x7 = <<338-48*7=0>>0.\nThis process will continue throughout the weeks.\nTherefore, w = 48.\nAnswer is", "answer": "E: motel"}

The gift came in a large box that contained a smaller gift box, and that smaller gift box contains another tiny present.  Iris has no idea about her gift's contents, but her intuition tells her that she has just received a total of 36 tiny presents.  She doesn't know how to verify this, but she knows she shouldn't get her hopes up that she'll get 36 tiny presents, because she may have gotten an empty box.  In fact, 5 of Iris's 10 gifts from her friends are empty, but no more empty than the other 5, which were certainly not empty.  This is a problem in which each solution contains multiple components.  How many tiny presents has Iris received?\nOutput:A box contains a box containing a box containing many boxes so\nif we say n=<<n=1>> then it can contain 2^n boxes that is 2^1 = <<2^1=2>>2\nif we say 2^6=<<2^6=2^6>>6 then that means the box cannot contain more than that\nSo n=6 is the answer.\nSo the n is 6 then 6+6+6=<<6+6+6=\\textbf{18}>18\nn is 6 so 72 boxes is only 2^3 x 2^3 = <<2^3*2^3=\\underline{3}$3>>\n3 more solution will give 3(2^8)=<<3*2^8=\\underline{64}>64 is not correct.\nSo the final solution is <<n=6>>6\nBecause the 72 is the answer\n\nInput:At a birthday party, 2/3 of the guests brought plates and 8/9 brought napkins, but at least 1/3 did NOT bring plates or napkins.

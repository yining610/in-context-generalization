If they are both on the trip, they'll have 120 pounds.\nSo Bob would have to have 120 - 40 = <<120-40=80>>80\nThen Bob has 20 pounds of tires x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 which make 80 + 4 = <<80+4=84>>84 pounds.\nSo the final answers is 84\n\nInput:John\u2019s bicycle takes him more than an hour to pedal from place A to place B. During a different trip, place B to place C also took him more than an hour. On the third trip, place A to C, John completed that trip in less than an hour.  What is the approximate distance from place A to place C in miles? Choices: 17, 28, 43, 59\nOutput: 28 miles: On the first trip, he pedals for an hour from A to B. The reverse takes an hour. There is an \"overlap\" of about an hour because of the time he bikes to B and back. This will take him 1 hour\nOn the second trip, let's say his ride from B to C took an hour. The total ride from A to C will take 2 hours\nOn the third trip, his ride from A to C only took 40 minutes. The total ride from B to C was 3 hours (overlapping the whole first route with a 1-hour overlap and a 1-hour ride) and 1 hour (the trip from B to C).\nA third of the third trip was 40 minutes. So, 40/3 is 13.3 minutes per mile. The trip from A to B took an hour. The trip from A'", "answer": "B: france"}

{"idx": 124, "text": "The best answer is church. Why?  Let's look at the synagogue, auditorium, office, confession, and church. \nThe synagogue: In a synagogue, there are many people sitting in chairs (and on low stools, according to the picture), but they're mainly studying prayers and the Torah. People often sit in chairs in churches (depending on faith and type of church), but it won't take place with many people sitting in a confessional, in an auditorium, or in an office. In confession, people sit in chairs, like in the synagogue, but only one at a time. In an auditorium, people sit on a stage, like performers, or in the audience. In an office, people are either working, or seated in a row, like a church sermon. \nBecause the only option that has all four of these characteristics is the church, the church is the best answer.

After driving for a while, the speedometer fails and you don't know how fast you're going. A highway patrol officer follows behind your car traveling at speeds that you estimate to be 25%, 50%, or 75% of the speed limit. Each time the speedometer failed, you adjusted your speed to make sure you were within the speed limit. When the patrol officer passed by, you saw that he was traveling at half the speed limit. How fast were you actually traveling when the speedometer stopped working?\nOutput: You were speeding 25% before your speedometer failed. Traveling 25% faster than the speed limit on the highway takes you over the speed limit. You're traveling at the speed limit at that point. Traveling at 25% over the speed limit still puts you at the speed limit. The patrol officer was traveling at half as fast as the speed limit, but you are also traveling at half the rate. (You traveled 25% of your rate before losing the speedometer.) It follows that the speed limit is 50%.\nThe speedometer will fail until the rate goes over 45 miles per hour. After your speedometer fails, you're still traveling 25% below the speed limit at the moment. You've been driving at 25% beneath the speed limit and now you're traveling 25%. You've just crossed the speed limit at 50%, the speed limit of 50.\nSo the final answers are 50", "answer": "C: bridge"}

Otherwise, the number is even.  The last digit cannot change the oddness (or evenness) of the number.\nA number of the form \"100k\" is odd if 100 is odd.\nA number of form \"1007\" is odd because 100 is even.  That number is even because 7 would result in an even number.\nA number like \"1237\" cannot be changed, so that remains even.  Another number like \"2457\" is even because 45 is even.\nThe sum of those three numbers should be odd.  But it's even.  A number of the form \"300k\" would be even if 10 is even.

If people attacked each other, it's likely because of names, so they need to choose letters and words together so if they see a name, they choose to ignore it and not to react to it.\nIf people attack each other, it'll be because they had feelings about the name (so, it's likely to be letters and words but feelings can also be included). It looks like feelings are there to tell if there's something wrong to what's being said. If there isn't any feelings, there's no emotions and people can't hurt them selves.

The diameter of a medium pear that has a mass of 10 kg in water is how many centimeters?\nOutput: Since a pear is 4 \u00d710<sup>2</sup> grams, we will need 10 kg x 1,024 grams = <<10kg1024g=43>>43 medium sized pears\nSince 80 kg /dm3= pear density\nThis means that 10 kg / (0.975kg/dm3) = <<10kg/0.975=101>>101\nThere are 0.97 dm for 1 cm and x= <<101>>1\nWe need to multiply x = 1 cm x 9.7 dm for 0.97 cm because we need 1 medium sized pear, which is 10 x 0.97 = <<10x0.97=9.7>>medium\nIn total, we have 9.7 x 0.99 x 10 = << 9.7 x0.99x10=973>>medium\nSo the final answer will be 973 medium sized pear.\n\n[1]: https://github.com/JonRhuran/KaTeX/tree/master/example-images", "answer": "B: lie down"}

Then we can write 240 = <342>123\nAdd 1 because we need 1 more to fill each position because the club has grown to 19 members total.  Then let's say 1 +1 +1 +1+1 +1 +1 = <123+1+1+1++1+1>147\nLet's try solving 147 = <342-342>4 so we set x = 4 then 147 = ((*3*4) +2)/(2)\nThen x = 4 can't solve and it turns out that it looks easier if I set x=5 then  147 = ((1*5*5*5*8) +2)/(3)\nThis gives x = 2786.5.  Since x is too big I can set x = 5000/116.5 to solve in the range and get x = 43.65.\nNow 12326.5 + 14727.3 = <<12326-14727=2800>>2800 and 2800 / 116.5 = <<2800/118=24>>24 but I would write <24> because it is closer in range to what we are using which is <0-100>.\nSo the final answer appears to be 24 or in decimal point form <0-10>.", "answer": "D: field"}

How much money will Mary have left if she purchases her table and all of the chickens, and exactly which chairs will each of the girls sit in if she purchases a 36 inch wide table and all of the six chairs?\nOutput: The table size of 18 feet is going to be too long because 2 x (x) = <<2(x)=36>>36 feet\nTo fix that we can choose the 24 feet table which is 2 x 12 = <<2*12=24>>24\n\nNow that we have chosen the table size we have to choose the chairs because the chairs have to have the same width as the table which is 36 inches.

The maximum number of hours you can stand working in these conditions is 12 so your average energy use is equivalent to the month order converted to Fahrenheit and multiplied by your daily hours of energy use. The following table shows your average energy use for each month using Celsius and converting the temperature to Fahrenheit for a day in a month and the day out of the week in a month. Given the table how do you calculate average energy use per day during the last day in February, the last day in April, and the first day in July?\nOutput:For February, since it's the last day, your total energy use is 12 (since the max is 12). Take the column for 1 day and multiply by 2 (since there are two days in a day) and then find the corresponding Fahrenheit on that line that you did and multiply the two numbers together.  That will give you 12 * 2 = 24 (which is the equivalent of your temperature when you multiply by 2 because 13*2 = 26 and 14*2 = 28). You need to get each temperature from column for 2 to 13, to find your F temperature for 4, your G temperature for 7, you'll do the same thing, and so on, so your T is the sum of all the temperatures in the months' temperature column (C2, C3,... C12) and your F is the sum of all of those temperatures in that month's temperature column, converted to Fahrenheit.

When on a host, fleas move forwards, backwards or sideways by using a complex set of hairs known as setae. A seta is composed of an upper and lower filament. When a flea is on a warm, vibrant surface, its hairs are stiffened by the warmth, which causes it to jump.

The first waiter can serve one patron at a time; the second waiter can serve two patrons at a time. The patrons and the waiters can enter and leave the restaurant at the same exact times.  One of the waiters is off service for a half an hour.  During that half hour, 12 patrons come in, and 6 patrons leave the restaurant.   How many patrons are in the restaurant now?\nOutput:  After the first waiter was off service, the first waiter was finished servicing 6 patrons.  So he had time to wait for the new 6 patrons to come in, and they did.  Since the second waiter had only been servicing two patrons, he was able to wait for the time to end and resume serving three patrons at a time (2 patrons/waiter + 1 new patron/waiter).\nNow there are two waiters that can serve 2 patrons at a time, and one that can serve one patron at time.  With another waiter of each serving type (2/2, 2/1 and 1/1) and seven patrons (6 new + 1 leaving the restaurant) there are too few patrons to require another waiter of each type.

How many bags of candy can be sold before the price of putting the candy on the shelf would be higher than the total price of the candy in the bag sold?\nOutput: The total candy cost is 635 * 0.25 = <<635*0.25=158>>158\nThe total bag cost is 1,951 * 0.05 = <<1951*0.05=97>>97\nTo get the same answer we need to subtract 635 - 158 = <<635-158=477>>477\nFrom this, we know that the number of bags of candy in the shelf is 477/44 = <<477/45=10.86>>10.86\nBut since this number is greater than 10, the answer is there is at most 11 bags that can be sold before the shelf costs of having the candy in the bags would be greater than cost of having them on", "answer": "B: sporting event"}

{"idx": 547, "text": "If he wanted to take a space shuttle to the third floor it would take 264 minutes because it is 2.5 hours to the moon and 2 hours back. He can get up to the 18th floor in an elevator in 89 seconds. So for the space shuttle it would take 2.2 hours + 264 minutes = <<2+264=288>>288 minutes. For the bus it would take 1 hour + 89 seconds = <<1+89=90>>90 minutes.\nIn the elevator, it would take 22.2 seconds per floor. So 90*22.2 = <<90*222=20144>>20,144\nFor the stairs it would take approximately 145 minutes.  We can subtract 90 minutes for the bus and 400 seconds for the elevator that he rode to the 18 floor. This gives us about 100 minutes of stair climbing. The space shuttle and detroit bus traveling times were 166 minutes + 264 mins = <<166+264>>430 minutes. So the stair travel time is much less, about 44 minutes fewer.\nSo the final answers would be that the stairs is the better choice because of less travel time.\n\nInput: Sally can do work on two machines.

The dog that is a boy stays outside with the cats, but his owner does not walk him.

{"idx": 570, "text": "If it takes too long, the customer may get annoyed.  If the groomer makes mistakes, they must repeat the process.\nInjury is not covered under any insurance policy in this plan.  This is why some dogs get injured during grooming when the groomer takes too much time.  One of the most common injuries is hair removal between the dog's toes.  This injury only occurs when the groomer takes a lot of time.  The owner becomes upset and may even get angry.\nIf the groomer makes a mistake during a pet grooming process, it's no different from a dentist making a mistake during dental procedure on a patient.  In other words, the groomer must start the process over again and may repeat it 2 or 3 times.  After finishing the process, the groomer will be late to the next appointment and the owner will be upset.\nWhen a routine grooming takes longer than 3 hours, you may have to extend the appointment schedule to prevent annoyance.  But, when there are a number of grooming services, then it is hard to control the time limit.\nThe groomers on the dog wash plan take too much time to finish the process.  The groomers must repeat it at least 2 or 3 more times and may not complete the task within a reasonable time period.  After the completion, the groomers can start the next task.  But this takes a lot of time for the groomers, which leaves them with less profit for other jobs.  Moreover, the groomers also make mistakes during the process and then, they must start the process again.  Due to all these issues, the job is left incomplete and the groomers cannot meet the demands of customers.  When clients cannot get services in full or even just small parts, they get frustrated and annoyed.", "answer": "C: late"}

He then realizes the player has already spent 16 minutes on the field.  How many minutes can he use the player before breaking the league record for total field time per player for the season?\nOutput: The team originally has 45 players and 41 players have been used up in previous games. This means a total of 4 players are still on the field. The player originally spent 16 minutes with the team, meaning a total of 194 minutes he spent with the team so far.\nThe record is of total field time per player so you need to find how many minutes 4 of them have spent on the field altogether before the game is over. You need 194 minutes and 4 players, so you should get 194 * 4 / 45 = <<194*4/45=7>>7. You can also think that 194 minutes is 30 minutes per player and you need 4 players.

Miami Beach is about a 90 minute flight from Atlanta.  We were planning on driving to Miami Beach, but our car broke down on the road.  Now we wish we had flown to Miami Beach instead.  But it doesn't matter now, because we have to stay at a hotel overnight, then drive back home in the morning.  Should we stay at the same hotel, or at a different one near the beach for more convenience?\nOutput: Miami is about 90 minutes from Atlanta, but it's also about an hour away from Orlando Florida.  So staying in Miami is closer to Atlanta, but is further from Orlando.  If you could make the drive on your own, you would be driving 10 miles less to your destination.

What is the probability that the homeowner did not recognize one of the home invaders?\nOutput: Suppose the burglars each wore one of these two sets of clothes:\n- Two of them wore white and two of them wore black\n- Three white and one black\nThe homeowner would have 4 choices.  They are:\n- two invaders wear both sets\n- one invader wears both sets\n- four invaders wear both sets (but with the homeowner not being able to recognize this since they each wore the same set)\n- three invaders wear both sets, and one wears just the white set\nThe homeowner won't recognize anybody in the latter case so this is the correct answer.", "answer": "C: corner"}

For example, if someone \u201cflows away with my money\u201d then when the money has \"flown away\" that would mean that my money is unused (dissipation), whereas if my money was \u201cdisappearing as I watch it\u201d then the money would be disappearing as it is used (fall apart).\nBut let us make sure to avoid answering the questions that ask when money runs out, with a description of what happens before this, because that is answered in the question.  \u201cWhat comes about after (my money is gone)?\u201d  My money is gone (that\u2019s the effect), but the answer is, obviously, nothing comes about after that, which is why the question asks \u201cWhat happens after someone has used their (money)\u201d  So, in summary, this question deals specifically with the effects of a person using his or her last bit of money, so the answer can only be that \u201cit\u2019s gone\u201d (disappeared, dissipation, fall apart, penultimate, flown, disintegrate, run out), whereas the other three alternatives asked about different effects before the money was used (what comes to pass before the money is gone; this is answered by the question \u201cwhat happens to the money when it is used?\u201d).\nSo the final answer here is run out, only when your money is gone.", "answer": "A: dissipate"}

I was asked to write an algorithm which solve this question.\n    - I used greedy approach for solving this question. In essence I just tried to guess where the maximum number of children can be placed.\n    - To begin with, I checked the 3rd and 4th options B and D as per this approach are eliminated. So option A B D are out(I marked it and gave it back to interviewer alongwith my answer)\n## My way of thinking and solution given by me:\nFirst I thought of placing 1 child in each bed room(A,B,C,D) until there is no room left. This will leave 3 children in D,2 in B,1 in C and 1 in A.\n    - I assumed no child will go for extra sleep over garage as it looks too weird. \n    - However, I then realized that placing 3 children in D seems wrong. D has 3 rooms. Which means there are 3 rooms left to place 3 children. But garage can also fit atleast 3 children. I would probably place a child in the garage, and then the other three kids will not have their own room. \n    - So, In the worst case scenario 3 children are placed in the garage, each sleeping on two separate single beds. That leaves one child for each of the other bedrooms.  I used greedy approach to find the no. of childern that can be placed in each room.\n    - I found out that the no. of children that can be placed in C, B(A+B+C)=10, so 7 in garage, which leaves only 3 in D. This is actually a worst case scenario. So this is the maximum number of childern in each room. \n\n## My solution\n```javascript\nfunction Solution(children){\nlet arr = new Array(children.length);\n\n  var result = children.sort((a, b) => a.name.localeCompare(b.name));\n  console.log(result)\n  for", "answer": "E: basement"}

The man had 2x more of the coins than the woman, but he gave her 9 of the coins. He then gave 7 coins to his friend. The woman had a round of drinks with her friend at the bar and now each woman has the same amount of coins. How many coins are in each woman's hand?\nOutput: First we will find out the value of each man's and woman's hands. They all are worth 168. Because the woman had 2% less coins than the man at the start of the challenge, that means she got the same amount of coines as him in the end after the gifts.\n168 / 2 = 88\n168 - 88= <<88-88>>0\nAnd the man had 88 - 7 = <<88-7=81>>81\nSo the man's hand is 81\nNext we will make sure the women's hands are equal by dividing the 81 and the 88.\n81 / <<88>> 88 = <<81/88>>0.92\n81 = <<1>88>>0. 168\n88 / <<1>88>88= <<8/88>>0 = 0.\nSo the woman gets 0 and the man gets 81\nSo the final answer are 0 and 81\n\nInput: A woman has 4332 coins total. she gives 1146 to her friend.

This man then asks you for your opinions and you reply that you feel that people should only be allowed to have parties in which they serve hot chocolate. The man then responds to this with the phrase \u201cHot chocolate makes you melt.\u201d How should you respond to the man?\nOutput: We can see that the man had a party, and in that party he consumed a lot of chocolate, thus he is melting. We can also see he likes hot chocolate, thus there was hot chocolate at the party. This makes it clear the man has had more tea parties with hot chocolate than the number of tea parties (that he can remember). Since the man has had more than 2 tea parties with hot chcocolate, we can conclude that you will also attend the party in 2 minutes and we will also learn the British man will have a lot of tea parties with hot chcolate. I guess hot chocolate is more addictive than I thought.\nSo the final question is, how many tea parties did the man have?\n\nInput: This question is the same as the previous question but changes one word. \u201cHot chocolate is more likey to make you melt than hot chocolate. How should you respond to this person?\nOutput: This question is the reverse of the previous question, so we just need to say the opposite of the previous question, just like this one, you should also reply with \u201chot chocolate is less likely to make you melt.\u201d\nSo the final answer needs to be \u201chot chocolate isn\u2019t more likely to make you meld than hot chocolate\u201d.\n\nInput: To find the total number of years and the total number of people in a group:\n1) Add the years together between the oldest and the youngest.\n2) Add the ages of all the people together.\nNote: The year 2021 is not included", "answer": "C: troms\u00f8"}

When you click the last button, i.e. the button to load the JavaScript file JS file, the function JavaScript JS file will run and the program will start.\n#5. A function JavaScript.js to run the program should be placed in the HTML file, and if you want to debug the program, the debugging console would like to be placed in the HTML folder.\n#6. The program will need to handle five questions, and each Question has five options. Each question has two choices.\n#7. When you click a button to a question, a JavaScript function will be called to run the program.\n#8. In the question, there will be two possibilities. In addition to the function JS, there are five possible choices of JavaScript functions.\n#9. The program will return the right answer and the wrong answer. The program will return \"error\" if there is an exception\n#10.

If you debug the program, you can also call this debugger console to debug your JavaScript code.\n#12. There is a difference between the program and Python or Java. One of the most important things is the programming language, and JavaScript needs to have different files to run the program. It is necessary to separate into different files to make the JavaScript program faster and more efficient.\n#13. There is another feature in JavaScript. It is possible to return an array or object that can have more JavaScript objects and functions.\n#14 Finally, the main goal is to master the basic knowledge of JavaScript.

The contractor agreed with the workers and told them they could complete the project by having each worker build a half of the highway.

How much more does each employee get than before?\nOutput: They each get 17 dollars more each month.  Each manager got $10 more/month.  The other 17 was for the employees.\n\nInput: The company paid each worker 3% of their monthly income. The managers made 8% less.  The president made 32% more. They added all the money to their salaries and they each took as large of a raise as possible.

They each had to get the same raise, so they split the cost of the raise proportionately. The company paid $287,000, which means the managers are the biggest losers. Since managers made 83,000 each to begin with, their loss of 8% means they make 94,600 each after their raise.  So their original salaries were 212,600 and they received 118,000.

Is the map oriented such that (0,0) is northwest or northeast (i.e. in what direction are the coordinates given)?\nOutput: To determine the orientation, first check the x axis: (2,0) is in the bottom right and (2 + 1,0) lies at the top. (2,0) lies at 00.5, -050, 0, +050, 1, 1. (2,0), (2,1), (2,2).....,(2, 5)*\nThe 3rd digit is less than the 1st and 2nd digits so the origin lies in the northeast direction (N), rather than the northwest direction (W). That means we can conclude that the x axis directions are oriented in the northeast direction.\nNext look at the y axis: we look for where the y axis crosses the coordinates given:\n(2,39): (-1530, 70), (-1540,170), (170,270) -> (2,39) is in the middle so x axis is oriented in the NSE direction.\n(2,28): (00,4200, 012)\n(2,20): (80.16, 0)\n(2, 20): (00, -4200,0200)\n(2. 18): (00. 6, -4130, 0200) -> 2, 18 lies in the middle which confirms that the y axis is oriented NSE. So the orientation of the map is NSE.\nSo the final answers are NSE\n\nInput: A man goes into his house, shouts, \"I'm home,\" and runs", "answer": "D: museum of natural history"}

If it takes 10 mph to stay still, and it takes 19 mph for the river to be moving at the same angle the boat is, then any angle larger than 10 will not work, because the boat will go back upstream (the velocity relative to water).\nOutput: The only possible angles that can work would be 19 and 39 degrees because the velocity of boat relative to the river and boat relative to water will be equal for 19 and 40 degrees and 39 and 50 degrees\n(Relative to water only moves forward, whereas relative to the river moves forward and back, so only relative to the river can go back upstream)\n\n```\n2006 Bubblegum\n\n```\nInput: The only colors that bubble gum comes in are black, blue, green, orange, pink, and yellow.

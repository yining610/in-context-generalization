What is the total price of a 105.75 dollars item?\nOutput: Firstly, The answer is the discount rate. Which is 7%. We need to subtract that from the sales tax to find what the actual sales tax rate is.  Therefore, In the denominator, the sales tax is 1 - 0.07 = 0.93. So the sales tax rate is 33% - 7% = 26%. Subtracting sales tax rate in the numerator and denominator, you get 105.86.\nSo the the total price is 105.**.86*1.16*87.50/100 = <<105.87*1.16/100>> 59.94.\nSo the the final answer is 60\n\nInput: The 5-20-life number game asks you to guess a 5-digit number between 20 and 99.

Fit you 2. Be able to go to the store 3. Have a seat available.\nDesign a strategy for selecting a bus to minimize the trip time. You can assume the bus has fixed routes you can't choose.\n\nYour solution can be a recursive solution or a dynamic programming solution.\n\nInput: The bus is 35 miles (around 35*2=70) miles from your house.

If you continue with this procedure, you will eventually reach 19 letters.\n\nA full message can be found [here](https://www.codewars.com/kata/scrabble-deleter-message).\n### To get a list of all possible words, I use the following code in python:\n\nWords = list(string.ascii_letters)\n\ndef make_word(i):\n\n    try:\n        words_list = []\n        for w in Words:\n            if len(w)==i:\n                words_list.append(w)\n        return words_list\n\n    except:\n        input(\"Length of anagram you are looking for is longer than the list of possible words.

I then solve for the first equation using variables and it becomes 20*8 = t.  I then plug in t =1200.  to get 24000 = 2t. I then solve for t to get t= 12000.  I then look at the other problem and put the new t.  When I do this now the first equation is not equal because now t cannot equal 1200, it must not equal 120 because now t equals 12,000.  The second equation has changed value since I put in a new value for the other t.  I then solve to get time now being 12004.", "answer": "B: expend energy"}

Your friend's wife is the marathon organizer. She wants to give you a little incentive to do well in the race. However, she knows she can't give you any prize or any money directly. Therefore, she is going to give you a coupon for $5 off a future trip to an expensive steak house, <<INSERT NAME OF STEAK HOUSE HERE>>. She calls you, and says, \"You've done really well in this race. You run all the way to the finish line and then finish the race. When you get to the finish line, I\u2019ll give you my coupon, and you can get $5 off of a future trip to <<INSERT STEAK HOUSE NAME HERE>>. After all your hard work, the least I could do is give you a good discounted steak dinner.\" So will this steak dinner help you win?\nOutput: No. Even though the steak dinner is $5 cheaper, that amount may not be enough for anyone to get a steak large enough to win the race. For example, if a steak costs $40 at <<STEAK HOUSE>>, she could only be off by $5 for 1/4 steak. Thus, she'd need to be off by about $5/4 = $1.25 in order to give you a steak large enough for a person to eat and run a race quickly.\nBecause the margin is $1.25 and most steak", "answer": "A: open meadow"}

One person thinks that the water is leaking through the floor of the skyscraper. A second person thinks that the water may be leaking through the roof.  Choose the correct explanation.\nOutput: If water is leaking through something, like in these choices of C and D, it will always leak out at the bottom. So it is more likely in both of these choices that water is leaking through what we would call the \"ground floor\"\nThe ground floor is the bottom of the building.  So if someone is walking on the floor above the ground floor, they would be above the floor that leaks. \nSo the correct answer may be A.\nThis has to do with the law of physics that says every force works in the direction of where there is greater force.  (The greater force is pulling it to the bottom, where the force is greatest). \nSo water would leak out at the bottom of the building if there were forces pulling at the top and bottom of the building\nSo then the final answer is A.\n\n### Instruction: Answer the following multiple choice question and choose the best and correct answer.\n\nInput: A box containing one apple costs $0.10 and a box containing five oranges costs $0.50.

Explain how to use it.\nAnswer: I can store sequence of events by using a linked list since it is the most efficient data structure to represent a sequence of events.\nA linked list is a linear list of nodes that contains the data as well as pointers to the other nodes.  The sequence of events can be represented in a linked list by the use of a pointer to the next node in the list and a data member to represent each element of the sequence of events.\nThe key to using a linked list for storing sequence of events is the use of a pointer as a link to the next node in a linear list.  Each node represents one element in the sequence of event and the nodes can be inserted, removed, and updated in an efficient manner.\nThis makes the linked list an ideal choice for storing a sequence of events since each node in the list represents one event in the sequence and the nodes can be easily added, removed, and updated.\nTo use a linked list to represent a sequence of event, you need to create a linked list node.  Each node should contain a data member that represents an element in the sequence of events and a pointer to the next element in the sequence.  The", "answer": "A: georgia"}

There were 7 days in the month of his birthday.\nWhen he went, he spent a monthly amount, which was $XXX.  This amount remained the same for the entire year. \nIn addition, he also spent 25% of his annual amount at the park.\n\nFor example, if he spent $2000 the previous year, he spent 25% = $500 of that amount at the park. \nHe also spent $200 on food that he brought home for the remainder of the year. \nIf he had more than $500 at the park, he would spend it all at the park and \nthe remainder of the money would remain in his bank account. \nIf he spent more than the food limit, he would buy the food and store \nthe rest in his bank account to spend on vacation the next year.\n\nWhat is John's total birthday expenses if he spent the maximum possible money per day?\n\nAnswer: John should spend up to the maximum possible amount each day which is $XXX. Multiply $XXX by 7, it becomes $<<7*4500=16500>>16500. \nMultiply the monthly amount by $XXX, it becomes $<<XXX*7*3750=17500>>17500.  Now that John has spent more than the food amount, he should spend $<<XXX*7>=2000 and store the $9000 with him to spend on vacation.

{"idx": 993, "text": "Let\u2019s say he was somewhere else.\nSo John must be in the kitchen. Let\u2019s consider the kitchen in more detail.\nThe cupboard must be somewhere in the room. Thus John is in the kitchen.\nBut let\u2019s say he wasn\u2019t in the kitchen.\nHe would be in the kitchen, and not in the room in which the kitchen was.\nLet\u2019s now consider the room in which the cooking was done.\nSince he was not there, he would find the kitchen, and so be in the kitchen.\nThe room in which the kitchen is is again the kitchen. The statement\nJohn prefers glass, and wishes he was somewhere else. gives us information on the relationship between John and the kitchen. But that\u2019s not enough to solve this problem.\nBut maybe John prefers cups, and wishes he has a dining room? In that case, we are in an \u201ceverything\u201d-state, so the last piece of the puzzle is to figure out where we currently are. That can be done by going between \u201ccupboards and fridges and everything else you can find in the kitchen\u201d.\nThe dining room is nowhere to be found.\n\nNext, we add \u201canything but kitchen\u201d to cupboards, and we have \u201canything but kitchen\u201d. Next, we add garbage dump, and we have the solution: garbage dump.\nSo we just concluded that we were in kitchen, and so did John. He was looking for anything but the kitchen, and the only way to reach that is by removing the kitchen from your search area. If you do that, he gets to be in the garbage dump.\nAn alternative solution would be to just conclude, that John was in the kitchen. That would make him not in the kitchen, hence in the room in which there was a kitchen. \n\nWe found a solution, but not the optimum way. The one optimum solution is to use the garbage dump option.\n\nInput: Danny is at home.  He is happy and doesn\u2019t have any problems with himself or others. Danny decides to go somewhere better.

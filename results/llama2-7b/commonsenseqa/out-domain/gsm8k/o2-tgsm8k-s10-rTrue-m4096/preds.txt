What is the total price of a 105.75 dollars item?<n>Output: Firstly, The answer is the discount rate. Which is 7%. We need to subtract that from the sales tax to find what the actual sales tax rate is.  Therefore, In the denominator, the sales tax is 1 - 0.07 = 0.93. So the sales tax rate is 33% - 7% = 26%. Subtracting sales tax rate in the numerator and denominator, you get 105.86.<n>So the the total price is 105.**.86*1.16*87.50/100 = <<105.87*1.16/100>> 59.94.<n>So the the final answer is 60<n><n>Input: The 5-20-life number game asks you to guess a 5-digit number between 20 and 99.

What is the minimum possible number of guesses for a player to win?<n>Output:<n>The output is zero which means player can never win. This is because if the players guess is too large, he will lose and also if its small, he will triple his guess and guess again.<n>This will continue until player's guess equals 200. <n>So the player will never be able to guess the number.<n><n>#!/bin/bash<n>#This script will randomly generate the output for the test cases.<n>#The script will randomly generate a decimal number between 1 to 99 <n>#and print it.<n>#If the number is less than 20, it will print 20 triple if not, it will print the random number.<n>echo $(python3 test/sol.py)<n><n>#!/bin<n>#This script randomly picks a number between min and

(The string under the rock are those strings containing no occurrence of ‘1’ or ‘9’).  We use the string as an argument because when we have a number string input we need to filter the '1's and '9's. The best way to do this is by converting the string into an integer and filter out the '1's or '9's by using the modulo operator.<n><n>The following would be the function we wrote for question E:<n><n>```python<n>def under_rocks(num_string):<n>     if len(num_string) ==  1:<n>         n= num_string<n>         return int(n-int(n%2)) if (n-int(n % 2) % 9)== 0 else int(n-int((n-int(n) % 9)= 0))<n>     n= num_string.split("")<n>     n = [x for x in n if  n % 2!= x or n % 9!=x]<n>     n = n.join("") #join the string back together<n>     return n<n><n><n>```<n><n>### Instuction (for question F)<n><n>The best way to solve this question is to define 6 strings:<n><n>`10000`<n>`9000`<n><n>These strings contains every possibility of 3digits as input <n><n>``` python<n>for n in [1000

Adams phone, however, can get bogged down by 4 hour long calls with one long-winded businessman. If his phone is in use, Adams has a 10% chance of getting a message when the next call starts. If the call lasts less than 10 minutes, Adams gets his 16% chance of getting a voice message during the entire call (100% total chance). For each second, Adams has a 5% chance of getting a 4 hour long call (1000% total chance), so at the end of 40 hours, there is a 90% chance he will not get a message from his clients (0.9*1000=900).<n><n>Adam's goal is to avoid having a long-distance 4 hour phone bill with some clients whenever possible.<n><n>Input: The first number is the maximum length of time (in minutes) that Adam can afford to take 900 calls from his clients.

After a certain distance, the first athlete is 8 kilometers ahead of the second athlete.  How far did the second athlete go if the race ended after the first athlete completed 1,200 meters?<n>Output: My first thought was to look at the second equation of the two and set one time at where t = 1200. I then solve for the first equation using variables and it becomes 20*8 = t.  I then plug in t =1200.  to get 24000 = 2t. I then solve for t to get t= 12000.  I then look at the other problem and put the new t.  When I do this now the first equation is not equal because now t cannot equal 1200, it must not equal 120 because now t equals 12,000.  The second equation has changed value since I put in a new value for the other t.  I then solve to get time now being 12004.

Your friend's wife is the marathon organizer. She wants to give you a little incentive to do well in the race. However, she knows she can't give you any prize or any money directly. Therefore, she is going to give you a coupon for $5 off a future trip to an expensive steak house, <<INSERT NAME OF STEAK HOUSE HERE>>. She calls you, and says, "You've done really well in this race. You run all the way to the finish line and then finish the race. When you get to the finish line, I’ll give you my coupon, and you can get $5 off of a future trip to <<INSERT STEAK HOUSE NAME HERE>>. After all your hard work, the least I could do is give you a good discounted steak dinner." So will this steak dinner help you win?<n>Output: No. Even though the steak dinner is $5 cheaper, that amount may not be enough for anyone to get a steak large enough to win the race. For example, if a steak costs $40 at <<STEAK HOUSE>>, she could only be off by $5 for 1/4 steak. Thus, she'd need to be off by about $5/4 = $1.25 in order to give you a steak large enough for a person to eat and run a race quickly.<n>Because the margin is $1.25 and most steak

Explain how to use it.<n>Answer: I can store sequence of events by using a linked list since it is the most efficient data structure to represent a sequence of events.<n>A linked list is a linear list of nodes that contains the data as well as pointers to the other nodes.  The sequence of events can be represented in a linked list by the use of a pointer to the next node in the list and a data member to represent each element of the sequence of events.<n>The key to using a linked list for storing sequence of events is the use of a pointer as a link to the next node in a linear list.  Each node represents one element in the sequence of event and the nodes can be inserted, removed, and updated in an efficient manner.<n>This makes the linked list an ideal choice for storing a sequence of events since each node in the list represents one event in the sequence and the nodes can be easily added, removed, and updated.<n>To use a linked list to represent a sequence of event, you need to create a linked list node.  Each node should contain a data member that represents an element in the sequence of events and a pointer to the next element in the sequence.  The

It’s great because you can be as lazy as possible and still be considered as hard working. <n><n>## What does it mean to be a lazy programmer?<n><n>Just imagine a program that can do anything. You can ask it “hello world” and it will reply you “I am a lazy programmer”, you can ask it “what time is it” and it will reply with “it’s time to go grab some coffee” and when you ask it to explain how it’s doing that it will just respond with “don’t spoil the fun of being a lazy programmer”. <n><n>## What do you need to solve one of your programs’ questions?<n><n>Another thing about being a lazy programmer is that you get to use a bunch of other tools. For example, if you want to calculate the square root of 2, a non-lazy programmer will write complicated programs to do the calculation. But a lazy programmer, instead of doing any work at all, will just let the computers library calculate the square root for him. So in the case above, instead of writing the complicated program to calculate the square root, a lazy programmer would just ask the program to get the square root for him and voila!<n><n>## What does

You should work through the system to make the change that you want.  This idea is called "top-down".<n>This is not the only way for change to happen.  As an alternative to this top-down change, there is bottom-up change.  In bottom-up change, you change from within a group of like people and then you slowly change over the people within a group so that it gains more influence.  This is something you should probably do if you really want change.  The difference between the two concepts is this: top-down change happens when you work with the system itself and you are trying to change it.  Bottom-up change doesn't happen within the system nor within the public.  Instead it is something you're just trying to implement gradually by working from the inside and getting more and more people behind you.<n>Answer choices A,D,E:These would be good options if you wanted to start a movement for change.<n>Answer choices B,C:These would not be good options.  These are things that only involve changing your own opinion.<n><n>---<n>

What was your total profit?<n>Output: You purchased 4/0.5 pounds of peaches for 119. <n>So the profit after paying for gas, basket, gloves, garbage bags, and peach pies is $20 – (8+8+1+8)=<<20-(8+8+1)= -1>>1.<n>So the total profit is -1<n><n>#  Part B<n>### Instruction:A) Give the answer for each of the given exercise.<n>### Input:Adam bought 1.5 liters of coke and 1.75 liters of Sprite. One liter of coke costs $1.30 and one liter of Sprite costs $2.70. How much did his purchase cost?<n>### Exercise 1<n>Output: the unit is liter (l). So one liter of Sprite equals 1l.  So 1l * 2.70=<<1l*2.70=2.7>>2.7, One liter of coke equals to 1l.<n>One liter of Sprite is 2.7 liters and one liter of coke is 1 liters.<n>So 3.80 liters of Sprite =<<3.8*l=1>>1. and 1.20 liters of coke.<n>So in total 1.20+ 1.20=<<1.2+1.2>5>>2.8 liters of cokes and 3.80 litter of srites will cost 5 * (1.2+1)) (2.7)=<<5*(1+2.7)>>15.75<n>### Input: How many blocks of 2 pounds cost more than a box of 5 pounds?<n>###

John preferred glass, and wished he was somewhere else.  Where does he want to be? Choices:  A: cupboard B: anywhere else C: everything D: own home E: garbage dump<n>Output:		<n>Let’s say he was somewhere else.<n>So John must be in the kitchen. Let’s consider the kitchen in more detail.<n>The cupboard must be somewhere in the room. Thus John is in the kitchen.<n>But let’s say he wasn’t in the kitchen.<n>He would be in the kitchen, and not in the room in which the kitchen was.<n>Let’s now consider the room in which the cooking was done.<n>Since he was not there, he would find the kitchen, and so be in the kitchen.<n>The room in which the kitchen is is again the kitchen. The statement<n>John prefers glass, and wishes he was somewhere else. gives us information on the relationship between John and the kitchen. But that’s not enough to solve this problem.<n>But maybe John prefers cups, and wishes he has a dining room? In that case, we are in an “everything”-state, so the last piece of the puzzle is to figure out where we currently are. That can be done by going between “cupboards and fridges and everything else you can find in the kitchen”.<n>The dining room is nowhere to be found.<n><n>Next, we add “anything but kitchen” to cupboards, and we have “anything but kitchen”. Next, we add garbage dump, and we have the solution: garbage dump.<n>So we just concluded that we were in kitchen, and so did John. He was looking for anything but the kitchen, and the only way to reach that is by removing the kitchen from your search area. If you do that, he gets to be in the garbage dump.<n>An alternative solution would be to just conclude, that John was in the kitchen. That would make him not in the kitchen, hence in the room in which there was a kitchen. <n><n>We found a solution, but not the optimum way. The one optimum solution is to use the garbage dump option.<n><n>Input: Danny is at home.  He is happy and doesn’t have any problems with himself or others. Danny decides to go somewhere better.

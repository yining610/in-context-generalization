Find the percentage change from the area of one triangle to double.\nOutput: This is one of our simplest problems, because we can assume that each triangle and consequently each sector is perfectly right angled, so all we have to do is apply what we learned in geometry class\nA = area of 1 triangle A = (1/2)bh\nSo, in our next step we will use this formula to find the area of A, for that:\nb = Breadth\nh = Height\nh = height of sector, and of both triangles.\nNow, we apply Area formula for this sector and A = (1/4)(b\u00b2*h)\nAnd if we had our formula from triangle (which applies to all triangles), b = b, so we can cancel this out and find the area like this:\nA = (1/4)b\u00b2*h\n\nNow, as we know, our area is twice of the first triangle, so we'll find the A for first triangle and multiply it with 2\n\nA = (1 / 4)b\u00b2*2*h\n\nNow we simply can divide the area by that of the first triangle\n\nA = (2 / 4b\u00b2 * h)\nB = 1 / 2b\u00b2*h\nThen, we want to find B / A and we do (1/2b\u00b2*h) / ((2 / 4)*b\u00b2*h) = (1 / 2)\n\nSo, the percentage change is 100% - 50%\n\nInput:You are 8 years old and you receive $8 every week for your allowance.

{"idx": 64, "text": "There are several reasons why a fungus would grow under a rock. The dark environment would provide protection in the form of darkness. Also, moisture provided by the constant flow of ground water would be available.\nSince the fungus is unable to live within sunlight, growing on a fallen tree would protect it from the effects of sunlight. Finally, the fungus may find shelter from the constant flow of air, since the decay fungus spreads by wind.\nGrowing on a manhattan building is unlikely. Manhattan is made of concrete, steel, and glass, not organic matter that a fungus would require to grow.\nStoring food in a store does not allow a fungus to grow. Grocery stores are controlled environments, monitored by supervisors and not conducive to fungal growth.\nThe organic matter found on the ground is more likely to be consumed by ants than fungi because they do not like to eat fungal material. They prefer to feed on food organisms that are not as detrimental to them.\n\nInput: A carpenters' company produces standard desks for their customers.

The answer is 113 * 7 = 785 and 785+ 36 = 1221, and 1221-36 = 1185, so the answer was 1185.\nWe are done!\n\n\nTo begin, we must have a plan. For this plan, we will multiply first. If we multiply, we get this.  And since 789 is a composite number, we can factor it. So we have two factors of 789.\nIf we multiply them both, we get the two factors of 7933. If it doesn't already cancel, continue multiplying further.\n\n\nTo multiply in this pattern, we will multiply each number except the last two by 6, and then subtract them together. Then after we multiply, multiply by 6 again. Do these steps, and when subtracting the numbers 6 times, add together the two 9's that we subtracted before.\nFirst, do the pattern in the two rows above. Then write those numbers together.

How many bananas can you buy with 1 half of oranges?\nOutput: The solution requires us to make fractions for the oranges to half-oranges. Then, we can multiply the number of half-oranges x half of 11 which will give the number of bananas you can buy from half of 11 oranges. However, you can not buy half of 11 and half 5 because you will receive 6 which is more than 5. The solution: 11 / 2 = 5 half-oranges\nAverage of half-oranges per apple\n= 5/ 2= <<5/2=2.5>>2.5\n5.5 apple will buy 5.5/2.5 = <<5.5/2=2 \n1/2=2 bananas\nSo the final answer should be 2 bananas\n\nInput: If a dog costs $50, then 4 dogs cost $$ \\approx (4\\cdot 50) \\approx 200$$\nWe use $\\approx 200$ to be approximate as it is not precisely equal to 200.

Therefore, the value of the total number of markers is (1/3) + (1/3) - a.\nIf there are 4 markers in total, then a = 4. If the markers are in a set, then a = 1, and if the markers are in individual sets, then a = 0 (we need to do this because it is unknown for us whether there are individual sets.\nHence, the total number of markers = (1/3) * (2/8) - 4 = (1/3)*(3/8) = 2.\n\nSolve the problem and answer choices in order from A to E,\n\nInput: There are twenty apples on an apple cart and Alice has 6 apples.

Choices: A: the volume of the gas tank increases B: the volume of the car decreases C: the volume of the tank remains constant D: the volume of the fuel tank increases\nOutput:Gas tank capacity is the volume of gas it can hold at a constant temperature. However, the amount of gas in the tank and its volume will increase with time until a given amount of fuel is used up. The relationship between the gas in the tank's volume and time can be described using the unit rate formula. This formula states that the volume of gasoline in a gas tank V (in liters (L)) can be derived from the quantity of gasoline Q (in liters (\u2113)) that it can hold, by determining the amount of gasoline Q 2 divided by time t (in hours (h)). Therefore, the formula for the gasoline tank's volume is V = Q 2t. Plugging in the information from the problem, the equation becomes V = (9.0\u00d78)", "answer": "C: american city"}

They do not know why Ephraim is a day ahead. On each of Ephraim's brothers' birthdays and on each of Kamila's brothers' birthday, they celebrate by exchanging gifts. How many days a year do they celebrate?\nOutput: Kamila and Epraim each have 12*2 = <<12*2=24>>23 brothers.\nEphraim's birthday falls 1 day before Kamila's birthday, and Ephraim' s birthday is a day earlier than the day on which Kamila's younger brother was born. So let y = Kamila's youngest brother's birthday.\n(y - 1) + 1 = <<[ y-1]+1=0>>0 days\nKamila's young brother was born y days before Ephraim.\nWhen Ephraim was born y days before Kamila, Ephraim was 1 day older than his brother, Kamila, and Ephraimen was born y days before y - 1 = <<[y-1]=y>>1 days before Ephraiman's, which is a day earlier than y = <<[y]=Kamila's>>Kamila's birthdate\nSo when they celebrate all the brothers' birthdays that year it takes them (24 + y) days.\nWe know that Ephpraiman is a day earlier than Kamila's brother, so (23 * [y-1]) = (24 + y). Let x = [y-1]\nThen x + 1 = Kamila' s brother's birthday, which is y - 1 day earlier.\nSo we have (23*x)+(x+1) = <<23x+x+1=24>>25.\nAdding together the two equations x + 1 = 24 + (x - 1)\nWe know that x = [y - 1], so x + 1 = <<x+1=[y-", "answer": "C: argument"}

You pick 5 marbles without replacement. What is the probability that not all marbles are the same color?\nOutput: The first step is to determine the number of ways a marble can be selected (assuming we do it with replacement, which is not the case here). So, the total number of ways a marbles can be drawn is 4*7!*9!*6!*2!= <<4*7!*8!*2!>>\nThe second step is to determine the probability without replacement.  So, since it is not without replacement, then we should simply apply the  with replacement probability to the total number of possibilities.  So,\n  4*7!*6!*9!*2!= <<7!*6!>> which equates to <<4!>>\nThe final answer is <<5*(6/7)=0.785714285714>>50.78%", "answer": "B: being annoyed"}

How many hens, sheep, and chickens does the farmer have in one year? (Round to the nearest integer)\n**(HINT: When a farmer is selling poultry, he calls hens chickens and chicks, so the number of hens and chicks is 2x. The number of lambs and sheep per year multiplied by the number of years (in the original problem, there are 12 months so 1.0833 years in any given year) equals sheep per year. Also, the number of hens, sheep, chicks each year is 100*10 + 250*2 + 100*2*2/(7*10 = 7) yields 3000.)**\nOutput: 1.56, 240, and 999\n\n**(You are given that corn plants each yield on average 10 ears. If the plants are exactly 10 ears or less, there are no extra ears. If they were more than the average of 10, the extra ears are discarded. However, we are assuming that the chickens each produce eggs at the exact same rate every time. So, they can only produce at most one egg a day, with an average rate of 2 eggs/week. The number of eggs per year is 52, and the number of chickens is 200. One year has a few more days than weeks, so add the two numbers to get 52+52.

What fraction of the pizza did each student receive?\nOutput: If each student received a fraction of a pizza, the number of students is not equal to the number of fractions received.\nFor example, if 8 students received 3/12 of a pizza, then another student received nothing and 3 fractions of a pizza remain. Clearly, this is not the case.\nSince each pizza has 8 pieces of pizza and each fraction represents the same number of pieces of pizza, the fractions will always cancel down to 1 piece.\nFor example, when dividing into 8 pieces, 3/12 will cancel to 1/4 and the same will happen with 3/9.\nThen 1/4 + 1/4 +1/5 + 1/13 + 1/25 + 1/9 = <<1/4+1/4+1/(5)+1/(13)+1/(25)+1/(9)=12>>12\nIf the first term is 1, then the sum is 12.\nSince 12 = 8, each student received 8 pieces of pizzas.\nSo the final fraction is 1\n\nInput: Jade and Evan want to take a trip together.

So there must be at least one word (but no more) left over in each sentence in order to fulfil that condition.\nThis means that there must be three words left over in the last sentence, and five left over in the penultimate sentence. Therefore, the minimum number of words per sentence is six. \n\nInput: I want to know the time, but I only have an analog watch with Roman Numerals. How many hours are between 1 and 24 if the Roman Numerals are used?\nOutput: There are four kinds of Roman Numerals (I, IV, V, and X) and one kind of zero (zero is actually IIII).

Therefore, they have 24 + 22 + 2 = <<24+22+2=48>> pencils.\nSo the final answe is 48\n\nInput: There are a total of 180 pieces in the box, including 22 sets of 12 toys, 2 sets of 74 toys, and 74 pieces not in any sets.\nOutput: Let the 1st set include pieces, 2,...22.\nSo each set contains <<2->22>> pieces, and the 6 pieces which are not in any sets contain <<1->6>>6 pieces.\nThere are total <<1->74>>74 pieces in all.\nSo the final result is 180 total pieces and each set includes <<2->22=22>> pieces and each set includes <1->74=74> pieces\n\nInput: We can model our solution using this diagram:\n\nOutput: First, we add up the pieces in both sets:\nEach set contains <<9->13=13>>13 pieces and each set contains <<5->19=19>>19 pieces.\nThen subtract the pieces in the sets with the piece labeled <<5->19==11>>11 pieces and the piece labeled <<9->13==3>>3 pieces.\nWe end up with <<5", "answer": "A: villa"}

{"idx": 568, "text": "Crabs scuttle along the bottom of the ocean. When they scuttle along, they use both their hind and their front legs. A scuttle is the motion that crabs use to move along the bottom of the sea. So when the crab was scuttleing, when it was straining what was impeding it, we can tell that this question is referring to the crabs movement on the bottom of the ocean floor.\nBecause crabs feet are connected, and they use both of their front and hind legs to scuttle, when there is an obstacle the way the crab's forward limbs must reach around the obstacle.\nThink about a scooter skating over ice on a lake, when the scooter goes fast and needs to turn quickly around the ice, what happens? The scooter has to lean. The scooter skates in a circle, and the rider is the handle and the wheel is the foot. If the scooter keeps pushing forward, and the rider doesn't lean with the scooter's motion, the scooter will just continue to move forward.\nHowever if the rider tilts the scooter over the curved motion of the foot as it skids over the ice, and the scooter moves forward quickly, the rider will be able to move the scooter quickly around a bend in the ice. If the rider and the scooter keep moving forward, and the rader doesn't lean with scooter's curve, they will just continue moving forward.\nSo to answer the question, crabs feet are on the bottom of the sea bed, the forward legs scuttle over the sand, and when they scuttle they must lean forward on their foot, and their legs, to move crabs forward.\nSo the answer is E: cooking pot.\nSo the final answers are A and E\n\n### Instructions:Answer\n\nall of the questions\n\n### Output:\n### I/O:\n\nOutput: <<1+1=2>>\n\n### Final:\n\n### Input:\n\nOutput:<b>\"The moon lit up the sky when the car was driving.\" </b>\n\n### Output(3):\n\nOutput: The car can be 3 km away at", "answer": "B: beach sand"}

There is no enough 20 cm bar to create all 15kgr.\nIf we use the 25 cm copper bar, there is 25 / 1.46 lb.  We're 25 / 3.1 lb.  We have 25 / 2.1 lb to create 15 kg.\nSo the final  answer is 2.1 lb\n\nInput:Maria had ten marbles and seven were red.

It would not make sense for the Capital of a country to be in one particular country's capital, since it would not function that way. Thus, Europe is not the correct answer.\n\nSo we still have 4 things to choose from. California would not be an option, since it is not the Capital of anything. New York is not the Capital either.

I was thinking he meant a quarter cause he had to give 40 cents and got a nickel for his coins, but in the answer they said he only had 14. I figured it out when I realized that since he had a nickel, the person would then have to give back 45 coins to get the money and a nickel to give to the clerk with only 14 coins, then the clerk could have given him a nickel to give at the end while returning the money.\nSo the final solution was 14 / 2 + 1 = <<14/2+1=7>>7 times\n\nInput: You make $80 doing odd jobs.

For every 1000 mm is 1 meter, 1000 cm = 10 meters, 100 km = 1000000 cm. Based on the word \u201c20\u201d we can convert 20 meters to 200000 mm. Choice A is an incorrect answer because 20,072 mm = 2007200 cm. Choice B is an incorrect answer because based on the word \u201c25\u201d we can see that 25*100 =2500 cm, and 2000 =200,0 cm. Choice C is an incorrect answer. Choice D is an incorrect answer because there is only one 0 but in 20,400 mm, 20,4 = 20400000.

If the height of the track is expressed in cm, where is the bus when it returns to where it started?\nOutput: The circumference of a circle is C = 2*P*pi, where 2 = 2*3.93 = 7.86, P = 2*343.21 = 686.42 and pi = 3.14, so the circumference is 2*686.4355 = 1373.875. C is the diameter of the circle. Letting P represent the distance in the x direction in cm as 2*34.321cm = 68.6421cm, we have C equal to the circumference and P equal to the diameter\nThen tan(theta) = 6864.21 / 343.22 = 20.365\ntheta, the angle in the horizontal position, is approximately 43.775 degrees, since tan^2(theta) = 20.722. So if the bus started at position (0), it should be at (0,551.0695 in position (0, 399.9742). Since this is lower than the height difference of 40, the bus is returning to its starting location. So its position is (0, 299)\n\nInput: There are 12 students in the Math Club. A third of those members play soccer.

Explain how the order in which you performed these actions has a direct effect on your happiness.\nOutput: There are two primary ways that the order of these activities might affect your happiness. One reason is that by choosing to do these things in the order you stated them, you're taking into account that traveling by plane to visit family is more important to you than simply walking to the local store. This indicates that traveling by plane takes priority over spending time with your grandmother. You may have a particular reason for giving that activity priority, but it's important to reflect on your decision as part of a larger process. Another reason is that your journey might be a form of catharsis - if you do this in the listed order, you may start to appreciate the smaller activities more as you anticipate the fun you had at the end of the day. The order you list these activities in is, in a way, telling a story about your life - so when you're in a tough time, it may be important to revisit the order in which you placed these activities.\n\nInput: When a baseball is pitched to a home plate umpire, how many feet per second is it traveling before reaching the home plate umpire?\nOutput: The question asks \"how many feet per second\" after the ball reaches the plate, but the answer to the question is about how many feet per second before reaching the plate.\n\nInput: A man has 47 pennies and 43 nickles.

It is called Petanque. In a Petanque game, a player stands on a level circle of about the size and diameter of their head. The throwing circle is called \"piste\". The object is to toss or \"pitch\" your Petanque and to \"place\" the Petanque as close to the inside of the circle as possible. If the player knocks the Petanque closer then the other player, that player gains a point for the round. The game is played in two phases. During the first phase, called La Canne (\"the stick\"), players throw a cane to determine where the Petanque is thrown. The second phase is called La Boulette (\"the ball\"). In this phase, two players toss Petanque and points are awarded to both players. A ball is tossed one at a time so each player gets to toss a total of 6 balls. The first player can't move their Petanque so the second player moves their Petanque after their first ball is tossed. If the other player knocks a Petanque closer than the first player, the second player gains a point the round and so on. If a player knocks their Petanque into the circle instead of moving it closer, the other player gains only a point the round. Players may take up to 3 tosses to place their Petanque. Once a player has used their 3 tosses, they can't use their 3 more times to place their Petanques. The game ends when a scoring round begins while nobody has used their 3 pitches.

She ran her entire mara\nThe distance (D)) the 6:90 minute mark. She was running with the goal in mind to reach a time of 6:15 minutes. She made it her main goal and ran her hardest to get there. To get from the 6:20 minute mark to the 6:15 minute mark, you have to subtract the difference (B minus A) because that is the amount of time you have left to run, in this case, (6:20-6:15 = <5/90> =<0:666/>).

If you walk from the beach to the other it takes you 33 mins, if you ride your scooter it takes you 17 minutes. How fast must you ride your scoot to catch up with someone who walked there?\nOutput: It took 33 minutes to walk to the beach. Let x = the total time riding scooter with speed v. Then the total travel time if we walk from the beach to other first, then ride scooter is 33m +v x. The walk time if we just ride the scooter is (33m +vx). Then the difference (33m + vx) + (33m) = 2 * (33m + 33m + v x) so we solve the equation to get x = 46 + 75.5 or for smaller numbers is just 121.55 so we divide 121. by 2 to make it a reasonable rounded number = 60.55 miles per hour or you could just say 103 miles and hour.\n\nInput:You have $", "answer": "A: guilty conscience"}

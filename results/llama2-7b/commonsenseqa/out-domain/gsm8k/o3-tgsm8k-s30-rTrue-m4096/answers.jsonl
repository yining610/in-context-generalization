You want to use a for loop to make a string, which will then be sorted and concatenated to create the array.  Note that if you use int array[5][5], you can index it like a 2-dimentional array but the number of ways will not be the same because your first dimension is a number not a character array as the strings are placed into the array.\nOutput: You are required to use a two dimensional array of size 2x2 to determine the number of permutations.  You will create a temporary string wherein the user enters the rows and columns (5 and 5, respectively, in the example above). Then, you would create an array to hold these digits.  Next, you would utilize the string\u2019s inbuilt concatenation operator @ to append each column to the string of rows.\nIn conclusion, your output will be an array that is created with the number of strings as entries, which holds each string of digits and the corresponding numbers in the original array.  In the example above, the output would be an array of 6 indexes (2*2**=<<2*2**=6>>6 entries).  You will need a nested for loop to loop through the 4 entries of the main for loop.\n\nInput:How many days until the next New Years Eve?Output:365\nInput:If I say I want eggs and bacon for breakfast, how many more syllables is bacon than eggs?Output:4\nInput:If I add 4 apples, 2 oranges and 9 bananas I have 15 pieces of fruit.

The trees produce 220 apples each season.  If every family in the orchard has a child under the age of 5, how many kids will be living in the orchard? Choose: a. 40 b. 35 c. 30 d. 25\nOutput: There are 140 trees and each tree produces approximately 220 appels each season. \nThere are 3 4 day-long apple-picking seasons or roughly 4-5 months. \nTo keep the number of apples from the orchard the same throughout the year, a family must have an average of 4-5 children. \nTo do that, a one-child family needs 5 apples every season. \nA family with two children needs 10 apples every season.\nIf it takes one family two apples to grow one new tree, and they have exactly two children, they need 5 times two apples to grow a new tree. \nTo make enough apples to grow 14 plants, multiply 5, 10, and 5 3 times and then add that to 14:\n<<>>3 * (5 + 10 + 5) = 17\nSo you would only need 140x20 = <<140x2=280>>3 apples for 140 trees over 4 seasons to grow 5 more trees. \nYou would only need 35280=<<35280 = 280>>280 children.\nSo the final answers are 280\n\nInput: How much would you sell a bike for if you have $120 to spend on a bike and you need to add $15 in order to sell it?\nOutput: Given $120, you need to spend $15 to sell it and the total cost of the bike is $135.\n\nInput: A grocery store has one dozen bananas for sale.

{"idx": 195, "text": "The first thing that jumps to my mind is a surname or family name.\nThe definition of surname means a term (such as Smith or Gonzales) used to indicate, identify, or classify a person, family, or other group.\n\nAs a person marries and has children their spouses last name is almost always used as the family last name to identify their children for official records, such as Social security cards.\nSo, a family is defined as a persons extended relationship. An extended family often includes the persons siblings, inlaws, and children. Even if you have a small family or nuclear family, it is likely that the spouses last name will be the family surname. Another thing families share are names, both given and surnames, for official records. I could not find a more accurate answer than that, I looked up the definition and it is used as a term to denote, indicate, or identify an in group with a shared family relationship. I thought to myself what other things did families share? They shared the same blood, however if they were siblings they would not share the same blood anymore after puberty. Also, I would assume for a family that lived in the same place or in very close proximity would share resources like the same food, drink, and air to breathe. However, I did not have any facts to back up these assumptions.\n\nInput: In a grocery store sells bags of flour for $3.99 apiece. It charges $2.49 for one egg. Which is the better bargain?

What is the average of the bills of all customers?  Solution: The first thought that I had was to add together every customer's bill, average all of the bills and repeat until I found the average bill. Since this would take way to long I decided to go a different route of doing it. In order to find the answer quickly I needed to know how to add 1060 bills. To do this you need to know the number of whole dollars in 1060 and then subtract the cents. In this case, there are 5240/100=<<5240/46=115>>115 cents missing so I added those 115 cents to both my average and the bills of each customer because those cents could not be the average dollars, so they needed to be thrown it. I then took the average of all the bills and rounded it off to keep the answer. The final answer is $12.376\n\n\n### Instruction:The function random(100) takes 100 inputs; the function print(random(100)) is another function which takes these 100 inputs from the first and prints them out according to a probabilistic schedule.

The only thing a decimal and a percentage have in common is its use for measuring.\nA percentage can be expressed as a decimal as 40100 = 4.01% or it can be expressed as a fraction, 4010.\nThe answer is A. If you want to answer this question you need to know some facts about decimals and percentages. Here is a short explanation about percentages: The whole is 100% of a percentage, the quesnt part is what the percentage represents. So 40101/100x100 = 1.5%. This would mean that the percentage answer 40.1% and the decimal is 0.152439...and on and on. You can use this type of reasoning to get the answer to this question. Here are some things to remember\nx = 1.5\n1.5 = (numerator) / (denominator)\n1.718 = 1.5 over 1\n1.524 = 1.5 * 1\n1.719 = 1.5 or 0.3\nSo you see for one to get to one-point-something, it is necessary to multiply by 1.5 a lot of times.

She can only keep track of the days between Monday and Sunday.  During the course of the week, she might sell several pairs of socks on different days.  She is paid a base salary of $7,000.12 per week, which is constant over a week.  On her salary, how much would she earn after selling 7 pairs of socks (at $2.50/pp) in two weeks when discounting is in effect?\nOutput: 7*2 = <<7*2=14>>14 sox sold in less than two weeks.\nIn order to sell 14 sox she has to make 14 pairs so she would need to sell 7 pairs on one week and the other 7 on the second week.  In order to sell 7 pairs in two weeks, she would have to sell 3.5 pairs per day.\n14 sox sold divided by 3.5 = <<14 sox sold/3.5 = 4>>4 days.\nThis means she would need to sell around 4 days worth of sox in each week to meet her requirement.\nHer weekly pay = 7000/7 = <<7000/1/7=1000>>1000 per week.\n1000 x 4 = <<1000 x4=4000>>4000\nThen subtract the weekly pay = 4000-7000.14 = <<4000-2500=1500>>1500.\nThe final answer is 1500\n Input:A salesman wants the average amount of money that he makes in a week.

Since the sun burns up at about 11pm when it is dark out, the answer to this question is B.\n\nInput:\nA hurricane is approaching your city.  As an emergency response precaution, everyone is expected to stock pile an adequate supply of emergency preparedness supplies.  The emergency manager has determined that one gallon of water per day is needed for each person for three days.  Therefore, in order to be properly stockpiled for 14 days, the following is required:\n1:\tNumber of people\n2:\tAdequate supply of water\n3:\tAmount of time necessary to fully stockpile\nOutput:\nThe answer to this question is 2 (since 2 is half of 4). If every person is expected to have 1 gallon of water per person for 3 days, then each person will need 1/3 of 1 gallon per day, or 1/4 gallon per day. If there are 4 people in a family, each person will therefore need 3/4 of a gallon of water per 3 days, or 1/3 of a gallon per day. 1/3 of the gallon water per day, will need to be multiplied by the number of people in the family. 2/4 of a gallons per day per family is required to adequately stockpile 14 days of water for 4 people. 2/4 is equivalent to 2/4 of 1 gallon equals 1/2 gallon (the half of 1 gallon required per day for 3", "answer": "E: feeling of guilt"}

I am going to melt my chocolate in the microwave and want to heat my peach for three minutes and then melt the chocolate for five minutes.  What time is best for me to start cooking the peach and the chocolate to complete my recipe?\nOutput:  You will need to begin the cooking process as quickly as possible.\nFor your peach and your microwave, you will need to begin cooking in\n3 minutes (360 seconds) from the time that you turn on the microwave.\n(360 seconds / 60 seconds per minute = 6 minutes)\n\nTo create your perfect ratio you must follow this formula:\n(3 minutes / (3 minutes + 5 minutes)) = (3 minutes / 8 minutes)\n(3 minutes / 8 (total)) = 1 / 2\n(One divided by two equals one half.)\nSo, using this formula, you need to allow 30 minute before you begin\ncooking your peach and chocolate in the oven.\n(365 seconds / 2 minutes = 385 seconds)\nNow, allow the peach to begin to cook in the microwave for 3 minutes.\nThe chocolate will remain (360 seconds / (360 seconds + 5 minutes))\n= (360 seconds/410 seconds)\n= 0.8627402333333\n(80% of the total)\n\nSo, when you put the peaches in the microwave, cook for 3 minutes and\nthen begin to melt your chocolate for 30 minutes.\n\n(3 minutes + 30 minutes) = (33 minutes)\n(33 minutes + 3 minutes) = 36 minutes\n(36 + 60 seconds) = 96 minutes\n(96 minutes divided by 60 seconds) \u2248 1.6 minutes\n\nSo, the final answer here is 1 minute and 30 seconds.\nYou may want to let the microwave finish, just as a saf", "answer": "D: wall"}

Thus the car cannot travel more than 12 miles.\n\nFor 20 miles, what is the car\u2019s maximum consumption?\nOutput:Given it is not able to go 10 miles, it\u2019s consumption must be 12 gallons or more. Thus, 20 miles is an empty-out, 12-gallon fill-up.\n\nWhat are the two options for driving 15 miles if the car\u2019s range is 14 gallons?  Choices:   A: use a 12-gallery fill   B: use a 14-gallery fill C: use a 15-gallery fill D: use a 16-gallery fill  E: Use a 17-gallery fill\nOutput:15 miles requires a 17- or larger fill (15-gallon and 14-gallon fill the total trip distance and you could re-fill in 5 miles, which leaves the same as 7-gallon fill)\n\nIf a tank of 100 gallons has 20% water, how many gallons are water?\nOutput:given 20% is 320", "answer": "C: control children"}

When you get to the part where you subtract 1 from an input (1-1=<<1-1=0>>0), that is only a problem if the input is more than 1. You are able to subtract it from the last part of the problem.\nFor this example the price of a bicycle is 10 dollars a day.  It costs 10 dollars a night so day and night is 50. The next 10 that is 40 more, so 190 dollars a month.\nNow, on the 30th day, you can subtract one dollar because the 30th equals 30 and the other input equals 1 so you can subtract the 1.   Next you do 31. If day and night is X, the final answer will be X times 31.\n\nInput:If you drive your speedy car, your average speed from Boston to Chicago is 4 hours.

When you know how long it takes for a certain amount of miles or how much how long it takes in one full day.

A medium pizza is less than twice as expensive as a small pizza.Which of the following could be the price of the large pizza?\nOutput: In this statement, a medium pizza costs \"a bit less than\" a large pizza.\nThe price of a medium pizza must be equal to (less-than) a large pizza + 2 dollars.\nLet \"the price of a large pizza\" = x, and \"the price of a medium pizz a\" = y, then y = x - 2.\nThis equation can then be used to determine the three possible prices for a large pizza: 4, 5, and 6.\nIn order for it to be less-than a medium pizza, the price of the large must be between (but not exactly) 5 and 6.\nSince x is the entire price of a large pizz a, the price of a large piz a cannot be 4 because 5 < 4 < 6.\nSo the final price of the large is 5 dollars.\n\nInput: A tree was planted for 2 years and grew a year.

Choices: 75 yards 120 yards 50 yards 0 yards\nOutput: 50 yards.\n75 yards is 100 times as long as 50 yards.  And 120 yards is 1.5 times as long as 75 yards.\n0 yards is zero.\nSo, 1.50 = <<1.50=3>>3 is equal to 1, and 3 times 50 yards gives you 150 yards.\nWhich is 120 more than 50, so 75 yards is 210 yards long.\n\nIf you take an object ten thousand times as long as you (a football field) and walk ten thousand times as far, or 10,000,000m, then back to your starting point, that represents a one way trip of 10,020 m, or about 20.2 km or a little over 12 miles.\n\nThe longest football field in the world is in Bremen, Germany.

That means a 600m penalty corner would take 2/3 of the length of the field, or roughly 2,000m.\nFootball field width: 36+2yds = 164 feet.\n\nSo a penalty corner in the middle of the field should take you ~7 minutes going against the wind/current.  However, the time required to go 100 yards, to catch up with the other team, could depend on the players speed.\nFor example, if you're running at 10 m/s, then it is going to take you 10/10 = <<10/10=2>>2 hundredths, or 2 tenths, or 2 seconds to go 10 yards (9.144 meters) If somebody was running 15 m/s, then they would go 10yards/15 = <<10yards/3=3.333>>3.333 seconds, so it would take them 3-3rds or roughly 2.5 seconds to go", "answer": "E: england"}

{"idx": 872, "text": "Correct Answer: All of the above! [source](http://wilkinsonschool.com/wisdom/2018/10/31/12971/)<br>\nFor those who don't know what a harpsichord is [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpsichord):<br>\"A harpsichord is an early keyboard musical instrument in which the strings are set into vibration by a quill or plectrum picked up by a plectrum mechanism as the keyboard is pressed. A harpsichord typically has a two-manual keyboard with a clavichord-style mechanism for the manuals and a independent set of keyboard mechanisms for the pedalboard, with the mechanism to the lowest octave being the louder and thus deeper. As well as a keyboard, most harpsichords since the late Baroque era have had a nut placed over one end of the strings allowing the player to damp the string as they played allowing for dynamics. Although more expensive than the traditional \"struck\" harpsichords, modern harpsichords are easier to tune and maintain, and may have improved acoustic effects. The more traditional type, a struck harpsichord, produces sound when a tiny padded hammer strikes a steel string. The modern variety is known as a \"piano-harpsichord\" because it has hammers (but not sustainers) similar to those on a piano.\"<br>\nBesides that, this question is one of the top questions from one of the best quiz masters on Kahoot so it is likely that it will be asked there since this is the best way to prepare quizzes for students.", "answer": "D: concert hall"}

This sentence is a paradox. In a paradox, the statement is both true and not true at the same time, or even contradictory. The paradox is what the statement is saying in the sentence. An example of a paradox is this: \u201cI can\u2019t believe how expensive these shoes are. They are way too expensive, but I still can\u2019t stop trying to buy them.\u201d In the sentence above, I can\u2019t believe how these shoes are expensive and I still want to buy them. This is an example of a paradoxy.\n\nOutput: The statement \u201cIf you put the Blue in the Bucket and Poured it in a bucket the water will be dirty\u201d Does not make logical sense. In order for the water to be Dirty you would need to add water to the bucket of water that is already in it, this would not increase or make the water dirty. So to make the statement valid, we would need to include an add on statement. An example: \u201cIf you put the color blue in the bucket and poured it you would get an empty bucket\u201d or \u201cYou would get blue colored water\u201d\n```", "answer": "B: frustration"}

The same pizza (pepperoni plus cheese) also costs $10.99 in the cafeteria.  Use the fact that the price of an item in a cafeteria is never more than the price of that same item in a grocery store to determine how much each person saves by buying their cheese pizza in the grocery store, and not the cafeteria, where cash is required, rather than by using a food card required in the cafeterias.\n\n\n\nInput: A pet store owner sells puppy food in large and small bags.

In order to compete with the cafeteria food that costs $1.75 for the same size bag, he charges 90% interest for those who wish to use his food card.  Since people always pay the lower of two prices when the prices are not the same, the cash-paying customer must always pay the higher price.\nOutput: The customer using pet food for 5 days requires $3.25 in payouts.

He found three different stores that offered it. One store charged $500.  The other two stores charged $750 and $1000 respectively.  One of the stores had a sale going on that reduced the prices by $100.  Whitfield knew that if he bought the couch from the first store, then he would pay $500; from the second store $650; and from the third store $1000.

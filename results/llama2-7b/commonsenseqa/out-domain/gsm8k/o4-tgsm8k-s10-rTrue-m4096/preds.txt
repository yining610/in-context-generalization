(Answer: A, B)<n>Output: From the question we can see that if we subtract type B's price from type A's price, we get 35%. That means the difference between the two's price can be ignored. Thus type A and type B oranges can be treated as the same as they have almost the same price.<n><n>### Instruction:Solve the following equations and write the answer to each.<n>Output: Solving the above we get 3x-5=<<>> and 5x+3=<<>><n>Thus we

He reasoned that intelligent life could still be possible, even though the Earth is 4.5 billion years old. To prove it he said:<n>“The probability that higher animals originated in one jump and only one jump is a million to one against. The probability that lower animals originated in one step is a billion to one against. That leaves perhaps a billion to one against that humans are the product of this kind of evolutionary step. It just can’t happen!”

Each chest has $k$ drawers.  You draw without looking and get a number, let's call it $n^*$<n>And you notice that you only need 3/5 of the entire chest, that is, $f*n^*/C$.  But not just any chest, because if you get an odd number, you need to return all the entire content to it's original state where it's empty, since we are dividing by the original total of the entire number of drawers, which includes the ones that contain no drawers.<n>Find the index $i^*$ such that the $i$th chest contains $f*n^*$.<n><n>Output:There are two possible results.  Either we get an ODD number or an EVEN number.  Let's assume we get a odd number, then we need to return all the drawers of all the other chests to their original state, so we have to divide by $T(C-1)=<<T(C-1)>>$.  So the index $i^*=<<i^*=C/2>>$ of the chest the first draw is taken from, will be $<<C/2=C>>>>$, so we find the solution like<n>$$<n>i^* = max{floor(3*(n^*/C)/2), <<1+min(C/floor(3*(n^*/C)/2),>><n>$$<n>Now, if $n^*=ODD$ then we need to look within the first $C-(floor(3*(n*/4)) = <<C-floor(3*(n*4)/4),>> <<C-floor(C/4),>>$ chests for our $i^*$ and we get an answer of $<<floor(C/5)>$ if n=odd and $<<1+floor(4*(floor(3*(n/4)/2))/5),>><<floor(4*(floor(*(n/4)/2)/5),>>$ for ODD$$.<n>

Choices:  A: child's hand B: the last straw C: hobby shop D: end of line E: toy store<n>Output:		In order to find out what the last string the kite has, Sally needs to add the remaining string, as indicated on the spool of string, with the string she has. So she would do this by going on the kite (or finding the kite at the hobby shop) and doing this to find the string she needs, since she needs to go 10 more metres.<n>In order to find out what she would lose, she would find out how much of a stretch is left on the kite, by adding 10 extra metres onto the string on the spool. Since Sally took 3 stretches out on the kite, she would only need to take one more to make it to the end.  So she wouldn't need the whole 3 more. Sally would then add the 3 more stretches onto the string on the end, and then take her 1 stretch, for a total of 4 stretches. She would look at the two sections of string and see that the one has more than the other, which means she cut too far off instead of shortening it.<n>So that means the answer is B, which is one <n>

He said he began losing consciousness.  I assume he didn’t suffer an injury, or he would have said as much, and besides, he didn’t fall to his death.  I didn’t ask and so cannot say if he actually fell out of the plane and began falling, or even if he was still in it.  As someone that once nearly fell 30 feet, I’d say a fall from 1000 feet, or even 500 feet would definitely kill you.  I was not falling however. I was falling from a scaffold, as it gave in during construction.  The only difference being that I was wearing a harness which stopped the fall.  I believe Sky diving is one thing to be afraid of and to be glad not to have had to experience it.  Sky is a big place.  So if nothing works out for the skydiver and he goes over the sides, he will be swallowed by an ocean or another body of liquid.<n>So the final choice is death<n><n>Input: Dmitri just went to the gym.

I thought C was the most likely because the red light would allow both cars from A and city street from B to stop next to one another and then both sides are now visible.  A intersection should be 50-50 because there are always two lanes on a road.<n>D is wrong because no intersection is formed when people cannot see others.  So if they could see people they are still likely to stand in a crossroads no matter how the road was split.  B is also wrong because cars coming down a city street cannot see you if you are hiding behind a bus.<n>A+B are also bad answers because C and D were right, but these do not.

So he might shout to a person who is passing by the window to say hello or give a wave. If that is the case,<n>Then the person is using the choice (C) - 'attempt suicide'.<n>2) It could be argued that saying goodbye is as such also the case, because they are in the process of leaving.<n>However, someone with a sense of humor, might simply insult (E)<n>The person (II) in the goodbye process.<n>However, if it is a genuine goodbye, the person will choose (B) - 'wave goodbye'.<n>The last option (D) - 'insulting them' would be only when there is no goodbye, but some kind of fight, anger or dislike between two people. To which the person (II) is simply insulting the person (I).<n>If both choose (A) - 'further cause', then it must be because they are both mad men and they insult each other. However, it is a bit contradictory. However, if it is a serious and professional choice, then the possibility of 'insulting' each other might not be included (as it would be a conflict of interest).<n>Choosing neither insulting or further causing is thus the same as not choosing insulting and further causing at the same time.  This is probably the most logical choice, if they both wish to part in peace. However, considering they both insulted each other, why they do not choose any of the insulting options (D, B), which could in themselves be taken by someone as insults, is a puzzle. <n>That is why it is not an optimal choice with respect to this question. However, it could be that the person has some kind of'social problems', because he is choosing no options at all. This might also be an option. If so, the person needs some form of help, before he can actively participate in the society.<n><n>Therefor, the answer is that the persons are addressing someone who is leaving, meaning (B) - 'to wave goodbye'

A seal walks to the penguin and passes it at -2. A penguin is walking at +2, and reaches the seal at -1. A seal is walking at -1 and reaches the penguin at +1. A penguin was going at -3 to get to the seal who was walking at -4. A seal walke at -8 to get to the penguin. How far will a penguin be from a seal?<n>Output: From this question we can determine that a seal and a penguin are walking in opposite directions. Since a seal is walking in opposite direction of a penguin, a penguin is walking in the same direction of a seal.<n>That means a seal is walking -1 and a penguin is also walking at -1(they are walking in the same direction).<n>So now we are left with 2 seals and 2 penguins. We already knew a seal was at +2 and a penguin was at -3.<n>From that we can conclude that another seal is at -2 because it's walking in the opposite direction of the first seal.<n>The other penguin is at -8 because that's at the difference between the starting point of the seal and the ending point of the seal.<n>So the ending point of the penguin -8 is when he first encounters the seal at +2. This means the final answer is -7.<n><n>Input: The average age of a team of seven people is 24 years old. A new member joins and lowers the average to 23 years old.

So I have a way of getting this question. First let's eliminate some candidates because it doesn't use the format a lot which is A, B,C,D,E. For the A option, it cannot be the answer because if the person has a headache then they will put lotion on the head, so option A cannot be the answer. Similarly, for the B option, it may not cause a headache but it may cause some other side effects. You really need to read the question to see if lotion can cause a headache. But the point is that for the A and B combination option, it is impossible for it to be the answer. Now let's talk about some examples in which it can be the answer. So, example one, you are feeling the headache, you want to take a break and you feel better after putting lotion on. In this case it is a possibility that it can be the answer because it is a break. So, in this case the headache is caused by lotion. Option C is not able to be the answer because the way option B is selected is incorrect and lotion causes a headache. So, it doesn't cause a headache. Now we are left with three options, B, E & D. The reason we are left with these three options is that if we had C then A or B would not be possible but we already know that A or B isn't possible. So, therefore D, E are the only ones left. Now D and E cannot be the answer because it will not affect the head. D can only be used on the skin of your hands etc. E can only be used on your face. E is on your head. So, we are left with B it is possible for this to be the answer.<n><n>

D: how many years in total do you have to live for A: to live till your mother is as old as your grandmother B: to have children of the future generation<n>Output: For the answer to question "how many children are in your  family", if there are 2 or fewer children, then they already live in the next generation and they dont count. The grandmother is already in the future generation, so the answer to this question is A: <<for>>2<<years======2 years>>2 years. <n>For the answer to question "for how many generations can go back", count how old your grandmother is, and how old is each of your parents. If your parents are older, count them as parents to grandparents. So the answer to this question depends on family size. Therefore, you have to take your family size in account and answer the question accordingly. If the family size is small, the answer is 1 generation, if the family size is greater, the answer is the number of grandparents. <n>The answer to question " how many years in total you have to live for", if the number of children is 2 or greater, count all relatives as parents to grandparend. If the number of children is small, count them too. <n>The answer depends on family size. If the family size has two or more children, that means the family already has enough adults.  So in that cases, you have to live for the number of parents to grandparents and one extra. If the family size was small, calculate the extra years by counting the relatives as parents  And adding one extra. <n><n>Input:There are 10 red and 3 blue balls in the bag.

They had a toddler, a teenager and a husband (a father). They were walking together, and every now and then the toddler would ask the father a question, and the father would answer each question. They each looked like they had been together for a long time. The toddler and the teenager looked happy about each answer; they looked at each other and smiled. The father seemed happy too, but something was off. I felt uneasy, a sense of regret. As the family walked away, I felt a deep sadness in my heart. They were enjoying each other's company. They were spending time together. Is it really that sad that they were living the normal life? I think so. They should have been living a normal life. This is the life I always wanted, the life I was born for. Was it because I did not spend enough time with my dad?<n>Output: There is a common stereotype that spending time with a family at home is better for your well-being.

In a football game, if a player scores a goal and 1% of the matches is equal to the result of the game, what does this reflect?<n>Input: A player scores a goal, and the final score was 4:0. So 1/200 of the matches ended with 0:4 (the difference is 4). So that means, 1% of 200 matches is 2, which is the difference between the scores in that match.<n>Output: For this question, we have to assume that the player’s team only plays against other team with the same number of players in the game. Then, the result reflects the probability that we get when we take 1% of the number of different teams that they could have taken on.<n><n>### Source<n>Study by [[Wu, Yi-Shan]]

Every second it spends exactly 1 cent.  The bird lays one egg each hour. How long will it take for the bird and its eggs to have no money left in the nest?<n>Output:For each second the bird spends exactly 1 dollar in the nest. After each second exactly one dollar has left the nest. So for each minute the bird spends exactly $60 in the nest, and for each hour it spends $3600. So after the hour the bird has spent exactly $3660. When it lays an egg it spends some more, and so on the bird and its eggs will have no remaining money exactly after 3660 seconds (1 hour). So the bird and its eggs spends the money and has no money after 60 minutes. So the bird will have no money in the nest exactly after 60 minutes and the final answer is 60<n><n>Input:After the bird lays an egg, every 19th day the bird grows 2.7 years older and its nest stays empty for the whole day.

The main street through those neighborhoods is Broadway.  The city also has two bridges spanning the river.  One is a 6 lane freeway, and the other is a 4 lane freeway.  Which bridge is the busier one? The average car uses around 2 miles of gas every hour.<n>Output:<n>The freeway that has 6 lanes goes between the downtown and the old neighborhood. It also is on the river, so it is busy.<n><n>The other freeway is between the old neighborhood and the new neighborhood. It is not busy because it is going from one neighborhood to the other.<n>Bruce (an old rich man that only has new-age senses) says: "Bruce sees that the city has only one freeway in between the two bridges. He also sees that the city has many different neighborhoods. Bruce thinks that the bridge between the old neighborhood and new neighborhood is busy. He then states that the other bridge should be busy, but it is just another freeway that goes from the old neighborhood to the new neighborhood.<n>Matt (a young programmer that only has street-sense) asks Bruce: "Bruce, which bridge is going to be the busiest one?", but Bruce won't answer him. This happens because Bruce lives in a new age apartment away from the bridge, so he does not know that the new bridge needs to be busy because it goes between the 2 neighborhoods. Matt is confused and says: "This answer is very obvious, Bruce. I see what you mean."<n>Matt is a young programmer that only has sense of street. He lives on the river-side so he only knows that the freeway by the river is the one bridge that is busy.<n>Drew Dixon (an old woman who has never studied science in his life) answers the question. He says: "Drew says 'the bridge between the old neighborhood to the downtown is busy. The other bridge is the one that we use most of the time so it should be busier.' D

So if a patient is trying to describe something like a heart attack, the doctor will know only what he was taught in school and what he had read about - this prevents any communication and causes a lot of misunderstanding.<n><n>So the time in the doctor's office consists of trying to gather any information about the patient's health that the doctor can from the patient, while the patient tries to communicate health information to the doctor. There's a lot of extra effort that goes into communicating to a doctor, which is why a patient will never be in a relaxed state, or be able to be productive during this time.<n><n>Input: How much money did each of four people spend during three different three-day holiday periods?

However, she had a $400/year promo credit that she can apply to a domain name before March 7th.  She had $900 of her own money to use towards the domain name.  But she missed the March 7th deadline.  She also realized that the domain name she picked "forum.example.co" was already being hosted by another community since it had been available for a long time.  She asked the registrar to release the forum.example.co name at no cost since forum.example.com wasn't an option anymore.  The registrar said it was too late, since he had already made plans to host the forum.example.com domain before he knew the name was unavailable in March (it took him a week to figure out that name was already taken).  Thus, Jamie couldn't get "forum.example.net" for a discounted price of $2900

So 438,421/3=<<438,49/3=146>>146 of the youngest people in your age group are 3 years younger than the oldest. We can then subtract 146 from 438,621 to get the total number of years older than 3 years older than the oldest. We subtract this with two to see how many years older than 2.5 older than the oldest. Subtracting 38,428 from this gives the total number of years that the oldest person in your age range is. So the final answer is 86.<n><n>Input:You are one of two guests.

My inputs are read in a recursive function that works similar to a factorial. For every element of the array list, the recursive function does this. I have the recursive function work on a variable array to make it easier. I then use a while loop to loop through the list, if the length of the array is less than 0, then break out of a loop. I then use a for loop to set every element in the array.  I then use a for if loop to check if my recursive function is longer than 0 and if it not equals 0.  I then return 0 and break out of the for if loop before doing anything.

As it turns out, the approximation is 0.174.  Since the question asked for the probability that I sleep and get cold, we subtract p(sleeping and not snoring) from p(sleeping).  p(sleeping and being) cold is then p(sleeping)-p(sleeping and not cold)<n>Now, p(sleep) = 1 - 2*0.174<n>= 0.669<n>and C'(sleeping and snoring) = 1-(

When solving this type of problem, one should start with the case of the empty street and then 10 options the row can be chosen from.  By the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be 1 or 0 houses the person went through.  It only makes sense to move forward if there are zero streets or rows, which is why there are either 2 or 6 options for the street and 5 or 10 options for the row.<n><n>Input: There are 200 people in a class and the student wants to divide them into groups ranging from 4-20 students.

Each has a 50% chance of returning 2x the invested amount. You have just received an invitation from a friend to invest in a private fund. He said the fund manager has 8 years of experience and that the fund returns on average 3x the invested amount with probabilities of 0.3, 0.2 and 0.5. The fund manager said that he is not a scam artist but he warned you that the probabilities of the above stated rates are just an 'average' he got after years of thorough research. Since you have been a bit more cautious lately, you ask him where he got the data. He replies that he ran one week of simulations and found that it was most likely that the fund returns on the 3 levels stated: 20.27%, 52.15%, 12.75%.

A) Find the cost of the cheapest books.  B) Find the cost of one of the books which, if sold would include the gift card.<n>Output: Answer: If the total cost does not account the value of the giftcard, the price of the books can not be computed.

Airplane 86 has the following specifications.  wingspan 95m, top speed of 108km/h, cost \$400,00, and holds the Guinness book record for the fastest airplane.  Is airplane 3 a better value than 86?<n>Output: They have airplanes that are faster than the fastest one. So this means they are not good choices.<n>If the airplane is costing $60,000 more than the current fastest airplane, that means 86 is a better value than 3.<n>Since airplane 86 is faster than airplane 3 at 3 times airplane 3, we can divide the costs by 3 to get the equivalent airplane that does not break the bank. So the equivalent 86 is $200,00+($

He must lift an object of weight 544 grams. In order to do so, he must use his own body force and only his own body force. Is it possible to lift the object with a force of more than 544 grans? Does the answer depend on something other than the man’s weight?<n>Outut: The man's body force is equal to his weight, so in order to lift the object, he needs to multiply his weight by 544 which is 2393 kgs. However since he only has 2393 kg force, he can never lift the object because that 2393 force won't be applied to the object, rather he might just lift the object. It depends on the way how he applies the force to the object, for example, if his application of force was done equally on every side, then he might just lift the objct.<n><n>Input:  A boxing match between two people was set for an arena

So we guess that A brushes his teeth and washes for 42 minutes, takes a bath for 58 minutes, and then drives for 30 minutes for a total of (42+58+30)=<<(42+58):30=70>>70 minutes.<n>Then we can assume that B takes 61 minutes and finally the other two took 49 minutes<n>So we can assume that all the men brush their teeth and take a bath on the same day.<n><n>But we have a problem, when A drives away the others cannot brush their teeth and bath because A will spend 30 minutes brushing his teeth and washing, so they cannot take a bath because they do not have time to do both.  So assuming that they all take a bath and brush their teeth the other day they will take 61 and 60+49+42+58<n>Then the last man B will spend (30+61)=<<30+61=91>>91 minutes.<n>So the next day C will start driving and A will finish brushing his teeth and bathing for a total of (30+60+61)=<30+60=91>>90 minutes<n>Lastly we can conclude that D takes 90 minutes to drive away.<n><n>Input: John had

Answer: The flight is a direct flight. There is only one route for the spaceship to follow. The spaceship is at a constant speed. Therefore, the spaceship covers the distance with constant speed. According to the formula (distance = speed * time), the time to complete the flight can be calculated as follows. $Distance = 2.6* 10^8 * <<149,6 000, 000 = 416, 000,00 * 2.6*  10 ^8>> 416,000,0.00 * 2.6 * 10^8 = 1.08 * 10^10 m.

How much did his purchases cost?<n>Output: For the nuts Adam paid 3 * $12 = $<<3*12=36>>36.<n>And for dried fruits Adam paid 2.5 * $8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20.<n>So in total for his purchases Adam paid $36 + $20 = $<<36+20=56>>56.<n>So the final answer is 56<n><n>Input: Johns goes to the gym 3 times a week.  He spends 1 hour each day lifting weight. Additionally, he also spends a third of his weightlifting time warming up and doing cardio each day.  How many hours does he spend at the gym a week?<n>Output: He spends 60/3=<<60/3=20>>20 minutes warming up<n>So he spends 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes at the gym per day<n>That means he spends 80*3=<<80*3=240>>240 minutes at the gym<n>So he spends 240/60=<<240/60=4>>4 hours at the gym a week<n>So the final answer is 4<n><n>Input: James has to refuel his plane.  It used to cost $200 to refill the tank.  He got an extra tank to double fuel capacity.  Fuel prices also went up by 20%.  How much does he pay now for fuel?<n>Output: The cost to fill a tank went up 200*.2=$<<200*.2=40>>40<n>So it cost 200+40=$<<200+40=240>>240 to fill the tank<n>That means he now pays 240*2=$<<240*2=480>>480<n>So the final answer is 480<n><n>Input: The number of goals scored in a game against Barca by exactly two players last season accounts for 20% of all goals scored in the league. If the players scored an equal number of goals, and the total number of goals scored in the league against Barca that season is 300, calculate the number of goals each of the two players scored.<n>Output: If the total number of goals scored in the league that season against Barca is 300, the two players scored 20/100*300=<<300*20/100=60>>60 goals.<n>If the players scored an equal number of goals, each scored 60/2=<<60/2=30>>30 goals.<n>So the final answer is 30<n><n>Input:As a human in a large northeastern city, where can you see animals? Choices:  A: zoo B: workplace C: sky D: new york city E: many places<n>Output:		If you can see the animals F, that can also be called animals.

For example, given [2, 3](1, 2, 3, 4, 5), the answer would be 7, because [2, 3] is a subset of [1, 2,.9, 5].<n>Output: You can think of this as subset sum.  You are given a set containing numbers.  To create the answer, you will create and test all subsets of the given set.  If an answer exists, the answer is the first number whose sum contains all the elements in the given set.  <n>It's important to realize that each time you check an element from the subset b, you must verify that the element is less than b.  That's why we sort in ascending order and start with a value greater than the set to eliminate any elements greater than b that the subset would need to contain.<n>Solution:<n><n>First, create an array to hold the numbers you will be adding to.<n>Second, create a list to hold the subset sizes you need to check.<n><n>There are two ways to add to the array.  One is to add a number to the subset b.<n>This can be done by adding the current sum + the element being tested to b.<n>If that makes b greater than the next element up, break.  Otherwise check to see if the sum<n>is the subset sum of the given set. If so, find the number we need to add to b before<n>we can create a subset sum of our set.  We

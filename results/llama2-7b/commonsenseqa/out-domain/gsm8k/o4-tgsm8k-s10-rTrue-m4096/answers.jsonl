One kg of nuts costs $ 10 and one kg of dried fruitle costs $ 8. How much did he buy?\n\nOutput: For the nut Adam paid $ 3.5 * $ 10 = $ << 3.5*10=35>>35. And for dried fruits Adams passed $ 1.5 * $ 8 = $ <<1.5*8=12>>12. So in total for buying Adam paid $ 35 + 12 = $<< 35+12=47>>47.

If one of the players scored ten more goals than the other player each goal, he got 210 / 2 = \u00a3 105 goals. If one of two players scored fewer goals than the other, he got 237 / 3 = 79 goals, or each player scored 165 / 3 = << 165 /3 = 55>>55 goals.

Each chest has $k$ drawers.  You draw without looking and get a number, let's call it $n^*$\nAnd you notice that you only need 3/5 of the entire chest, that is, $f*n^*/C$.  But not just any chest, because if you get an odd number, you need to return all the entire content to it's original state where it's empty, since we are dividing by the original total of the entire number of drawers, which includes the ones that contain no drawers.\nFind the index $i^*$ such that the $i$th chest contains $f*n^*$.\n\nOutput:There are two possible results.  Either we get an ODD number or an EVEN number.  Let's assume we get a odd number, then we need to return all the drawers of all the other chests to their original state, so we have to divide by $T(C-1)=<<T(C-1)>>$.  So the index $i^*=<<i^*=C/2>>$ of the chest the first draw is taken from, will be $<<C/2=C>>>>$, so we find the solution like\n$$\r\ni^* = max{floor(3*(n^*/C)/2), <<1+min(C/floor(3*(n^*/C)/2),>>\r\n$$\nNow, if $n^*=ODD$ then we need to look within the first $C-(floor(3*(n*/4)) = <<C-floor(3*(n*4)/4),>> <<C-floor(C/4),>>$ chests for our $i^*$ and we get an answer of $<<floor(C/5)>$ if n=odd and $<<1+floor(4*(floor(3*(n/4)/2))/5),>><<floor(4*(floor(*(n/4)/2)/5),>>$ for ODD$$.", "answer": "D: rose garden"}

A seal walks to the penguin and passes it at -2. A penguin is walking at +2, and reaches the seal at -1. A seal is walking at -1 and reaches the penguin at +1. A penguin was going at -3 to get to the seal who was walking at -4. A seal walke at -8 to get to the penguin. How far will a penguin be from a seal?\nOutput: From this question we can determine that a seal and a penguin are walking in opposite directions. Since a seal is walking in opposite direction of a penguin, a penguin is walking in the same direction of a seal.\nThat means a seal is walking -1 and a penguin is also walking at -1(they are walking in the same direction).\nSo now we are left with 2 seals and 2 penguins. We already knew a seal was at +2 and a penguin was at -3.\nFrom that we can conclude that another seal is at -2 because it's walking in the opposite direction of the first seal.\nThe other penguin is at -8 because that's at the difference between the starting point of the seal and the ending point of the seal.\nSo the ending point of the penguin -8 is when he first encounters the seal at +2.

So I have a way of getting this question. First let's eliminate some candidates because it doesn't use the format a lot which is A, B,C,D,E. For the A option, it cannot be the answer because if the person has a headache then they will put lotion on the head, so option A cannot be the answer. Similarly, for the B option, it may not cause a headache but it may cause some other side effects. You really need to read the question to see if lotion can cause a headache. But the point is that for the A and B combination option, it is impossible for it to be the answer. Now let's talk about some examples in which it can be the answer. So, example one, you are feeling the headache, you want to take a break and you feel better after putting lotion on. In this case it is a possibility that it can be the answer because it is a break. So, in this case the headache is caused by lotion. Option C is not able to be the answer because the way option B is selected is incorrect and lotion causes a headache. So, it doesn't cause a headache. Now we are left with three options, B, E & D. The reason we are left with these three options is that if we had C then A or B would not be possible but we already know that A or B isn't possible. So, therefore D, E are the only ones left. Now D and E cannot be the answer because it will not affect the head. D can only be used on the skin of your hands etc. E can only be used on your face. E is on your head. So, we are left with B it is possible for this to be the answer.", "answer": "C: smooth skin"}

D: how many years in total do you have to live for A: to live till your mother is as old as your grandmother B: to have children of the future generation\nOutput: For the answer to question \"how many children are in your  family\", if there are 2 or fewer children, then they already live in the next generation and they dont count. The grandmother is already in the future generation, so the answer to this question is A: <<for>>2<<years======2 years>>2 years. \nFor the answer to question \"for how many generations can go back\", count how old your grandmother is, and how old is each of your parents. If your parents are older, count them as parents to grandparents. So the answer to this question depends on family size. Therefore, you have to take your family size in account and answer the question accordingly. If the family size is small, the answer is 1 generation, if the family size is greater, the answer is the number of grandparents. \nThe answer to question \" how many years in total you have to live for\", if the number of children is 2 or greater, count all relatives as parents to grandparend. If the number of children is small, count them too. \nThe answer depends on family size. If the family size has two or more children, that means the family already has enough adults.  So in that cases, you have to live for the number of parents to grandparents and one extra. If the family size was small, calculate the extra years by counting the relatives as parents  And adding one extra. \n\nInput:There are 10 red and 3 blue balls in the bag.

Every second it spends exactly 1 cent.  The bird lays one egg each hour. How long will it take for the bird and its eggs to have no money left in the nest?\nOutput:For each second the bird spends exactly 1 dollar in the nest. After each second exactly one dollar has left the nest. So for each minute the bird spends exactly $60 in the nest, and for each hour it spends $3600. So after the hour the bird has spent exactly $3660. When it lays an egg it spends some more, and so on the bird and its eggs will have no remaining money exactly after 3660 seconds (1 hour). So the bird and its eggs spends the money and has no money after 60 minutes.

So the first egg laid by the bird has become an adult exactly after 30 days. After that, a new egg will become an adult after 5 days (it will take 20 days after the bird has laid the first 2 eggs and only 19 days until the second egg becomes an adult, so exactly after 20 days). After that, each successive egg will become an adult in 5 days. The nest will stay empty for 38 days, so the final answer is 20+5*3+5*3=<<20+5*5=38>>38 days.\n\nInput: A boy has 5 marbles.

The first part of the question asked, how many hours does he spend lifting weights, we convert 1 hour into it's weight in minutes, that's 60.\nThe second part of the question asked how many minutes does he spend warming up, we divide 60 by 3 to get the answer, which is 20.\nThe third part, the part that asked him how much oil costs, we did a simple operation to find the ratio of the two prices, 56/32 because we saw that the sum of the two prices was 80.\n\n**3rd solution:** First part of this question asked us how much of the total cost does each part takes up, so we divide the the fuel tank's cost by the total quantity of fuel, this is the answer, 60/2.\nFor the second part we found the total cost for the fuel tank using the previous solution.\n\n**4th solution:** Here we simply add the two choices and we will know which one corresponds to the answer.\n\n**5th solution:** for the part where they asked how the boys will have fun, the answer to their question is simply E, because that is the only choice that can combine the two parts \"work less\" with \"enjoy living\".\n\n\n##", "answer": "B: get laid"}

Among them, 260 are boys of color and 380 are girls of color. However, both sexes take an equal number of math, science, and language courses. Find the number of male and female students enrolled in foreign/bilingual courses. Output: As 380/4550=<<380/4,550=8.5>>8.5% of the students are girls of color, 8.5% of 380=<<38,008.5=3,400>>3,400 of the boys of color are enrolled in foreign courses.\nInput:You are 28 years old.  There are 28 times more people in your age group than in the next lower age group.  If the youngest member is 18, and the oldest is 86, how old is the oldest person, if there are 438,383 persons in your age group.\nOutput: We can first add up how many 3-year increments there are and how many total years to see how large of a gap there is between the youngest and oldest person in your age group. So 438,421/3=<<438,49/3=146>>146 of the youngest people in your age group are 3 years younger than the oldest. We can then subtract 146 from 438,621 to get the total number of years older than 3 years older than the oldest. We subtract this with two to see how many years older than 2.5 older than the oldest. Subtracting 38,428 from this gives the total number of years that the oldest person in your age range is. So the final answer is 86.\n\nInput:You are one of two guests.

However, it stops playing immediately after it announces that it's time for bed.   Suppose you could listen to your favorite music all night, without it ever saying it's time for you to go to bed.  The only cost is that you'll have to listen to a jingle every 10 minutes.  For how many minutes do you need to turn the radio on so that, over all 24-hour periods, you get no jingles at all?\nOutput: In each 24 hour time period, you must wait for 20+10 =<<20+10=15>>15 minutes before the radio starts playing at the beginning of the 24 hour time frame\nSo, over 24 hours, 15*12 =<<15*12=180>>180 minutes that the radio stops playing between times when the radio starts playing.\nIf, initially, the radio stops, after 20+15 =<<20+20=40>>41 minutes of playing\nThen, the answer must be at least", "answer": "B: unnecessary"}

Fuel prices went down 10 percent and now take up more storage space. If it takes the factory one extra hour to fill the tank, how much does it now cost to fill the new tank in the factory?\nOutput: The fill time to produce a new tank is 1*(<<1*3,300>>3,300) which is the fill time of the smaller tank.  Fuel prices went down by $<<3,300*.10=$<<3,30>300>>300\nSo it now costs $3,333=(<<3,333>3300>>3300)to fill the new tank\nSo the final answer has to be $3,33\n\nInput: A new model of a car comes out in the market for which the price is lower than the regular model of the car. If your current loan is 6 thousand and you can afford to shell out 500 more per month to purchase the new model, should you?\nOutput: For calculating this you have to first subtract 6*12=<<6*12=72>>72 from the difference in price.  So the difference in price becomes 6-72=<<6-72=66>>66.  If you can afford to pay 500 per month the loan will be paid off in 66/3=<<66/3=22>>22 years.  So you should buy the new model because after 22 years the difference in price you saved will be (22+4*<<22+4>>=26>>26 years or 26 years).  So the final answer is yes.\n\nInput: Mary works at a store where she is tasked with creating customer lists along with their purchase histories.

But, it's not impossible to survive without earth. We can change the atmosphere by building another planet, for example our moon, a giant mirror and other objects that can reflect the sunlight, and using the water from the oceans to create a new planet. If you are in charge of making a new planet, would you rather give priority to oxygen production, or to temperature regulation, or both equally? Choices: 1: oxygen production  2: temperature regulation  3: both equally\nOutput: This problem has a \"right\" answer since I can not think of any benefit giving priority to temperature regulation.

Since 3000 + 3774 = 3774, you can subtract 1 number to get it down to 1574.)\nOutput: One of the numbers is the sum of the digits.  3 is created from 4+1 and 7 is created from 4-3, so we subtract 3 from the inputed number.  This gives 37740, which is not a number made of the digits.  Then, 2367 is created from 3 + 6 + 7 + 40.  So since 1 digit is left, the final number is 2367.

Does the answer depend on something other than the man\u2019s weight?\nOutut: The man's body force is equal to his weight, so in order to lift the object, he needs to multiply his weight by 544 which is 2393 kgs. However since he only has 2393 kg force, he can never lift the object because that 2393 force won't be applied to the object, rather he might just lift the object. It depends on the way how he applies the force to the object, for example, if his application of force was done equally on every side, then he might just lift the objct.\n\nInput:  A boxing match between two people was set for an arena", "answer": "E: toy store"}

So we guess that A brushes his teeth and washes for 42 minutes, takes a bath for 58 minutes, and then drives for 30 minutes for a total of (42+58+30)=<<(42+58):30=70>>70 minutes.\nThen we can assume that B takes 61 minutes and finally the other two took 49 minutes\nSo we can assume that all the men brush their teeth and take a bath on the same day.\n\nBut we have a problem, when A drives away the others cannot brush their teeth and bath because A will spend 30 minutes brushing his teeth and washing, so they cannot take a bath because they do not have time to do both.  So assuming that they all take a bath and brush their teeth the other day they will take 61 and 60+49+42+58\nThen the last man B will spend (30+61)=<<30+61=91>>91 minutes.\nSo the next day C will start driving and A will finish brushing his teeth and bathing for a total of (30+60+61)=<30+60=91>>90 minutes\nLastly we can conclude that D takes 90 minutes to drive away.\n\nInput: John had", "answer": "A: hear crowd go mad"}

{"idx": 965, "text": "As an expert plant enthusiast, you would need to take an in-depth look at the rosebush first and answer the question. This garden is the most similar to botanical gardens as it features lots of exotic plants in a large naturalistic setting. If you were trying to make your rosebush more likely to survive, you would also need to ensure that it gets 6 hours of direct sunlight so it could get the full intensity of natural light needed during each day cycle. You will also need to pay closer attention to its nutritional needs as it produces very high yields in terms of leaves, flowers, stems, and fruits during the growing season.\nThe best time for planting a rosebush in Northern Hemisphere is from October, and it would thrive in zones 6 to 9, meaning it could be safely transplanted in any of these zones within the United States.

For example, given [2, 3](1, 2, 3, 4, 5), the answer would be 7, because [2, 3] is a subset of [1, 2,.9, 5].\nOutput: You can think of this as subset sum.  You are given a set containing numbers.  To create the answer, you will create and test all subsets of the given set.  If an answer exists, the answer is the first number whose sum contains all the elements in the given set.  \nIt's important to realize that each time you check an element from the subset b, you must verify that the element is less than b.  That's why we sort in ascending order and start with a value greater than the set to eliminate any elements greater than b that the subset would need to contain.\nSolution:\n\nFirst, create an array to hold the numbers you will be adding to.\nSecond, create a list to hold the subset sizes you need to check.\n\nThere are two ways to add to the array.  One is to add a number to the subset b.\nThis can be done by adding the current sum + the element being tested to b.\nIf that makes b greater than the next element up, break.  Otherwise check to see if the sum\nis the subset sum of the given set. If so, find the number we need to add to b before\nwe can create a subset sum of our set.  We", "answer": "A: zoo"}

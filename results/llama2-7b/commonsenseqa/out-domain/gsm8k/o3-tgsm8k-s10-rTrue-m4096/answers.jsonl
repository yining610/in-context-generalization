For 1kg of mangoes, it costs 55 cents, for 1 kg of cherries, it costs 45 cents, but if you combine 200g mangoes and 150g cherries you get 1kg of fruit. What would you pay the owner if you buy these fruits?\nOutput: Buy 1 k of mango 55*1=<<55*1=55>>55\nBuy 1k of cherries 45*1=<<45*1=45>>45\nAdding 200gm mangoes to 150gm cherries you get 350gm of fruit\nAnd for 350g you pay 350/200=<<350/2=1.75>>1.75\nSo 55+45+1.75=<<55+45)=96>>96\nSo the final answer 96\n\n\nInput: You\u2019re at a bookstore that doesn\u2019t have any children literature.

If the books are available, how many books can you buy?\nOutput: Since there are children books and regular books. We cannot buy 10 children books. So the solution is to buy 1 * 10=<<10(1+1)=10>>10 regulars books. And buy 10 *10=<<1(1+1)=20>>  children books. So the final answer is 20.\n\nInput: You are at a bookstore that has 3 types of books - children $4, classical children $3, and normal books $10.

It is more important to take the notebook than the water. The first choice I made was to take the water first. On the way to the library, I ran into a friend and decided to take time to chat on the way to the library. So now I have to make another choice what to take, The two options are the water and the notebook. The friend I met was going to the gym and he has 24 notebooks at home. He has lots of notebooks, so I decided to take a notebook and the water instead of going to the gym with him. I like drinks sweetened with stevia instead of sugar. Therefore, it is not better to take the notebook that I will take than the drink. So, I went to home with stevia-sweetened drink and a notebook. I wanted to drink a cold drink and remembered the ice cube compartment on the refrigerator. So, I went back to the refrigerator to get ice cubes. I had 9 minutes to walk between the time when I took the notebook and the time when I took ice cubes. Therefore, I took two minutes to talk, 2 minutes to go to a book store to buy and three minutes to buy a drink and get ice cubes at home. Choices: A: three minutes B: two minutes C: one minute D: four minutes E: five minutes F: six minutes\nOutput: It took 9 minutes to get ice cubes from the refrigerator\nSo it took 3+B+1+2+2+F=<<3+9=12>>12 minutes\nSo the choice is B=<<Ans:2>>2\n\nInput: A car travelled 75 m in an hour.

They don't list 2y as a variable, so to solve 2y, you must take the square root of that value, since 4a is a given value in the question. Since you can't take the square root of a negative number, I'm going to use a substitution instead of solving for 2y. Also, b > 1, so I can substitute x+2y for 4a. 3 (x+2y)<= 4a, which is equivalent to 9a <= 12x So I can substitute a and x for 9a and 12x respectively. I can cancel terms, so I have 12x <= 12a. I can simply solve for x by subtracting from 12a. Solving, I got x<= 9a/3 and since I can't multiply by a negative number, I am done.\n\nInput: If 25 women and 10 men have 320 pieces of fruit.

How many hours should he use for each process if their productivity varies by $\\$400$?\nOutput:\nLet A be the difference of the cost when working on fixing and cleaning\ndifference between cost of two operations is always positive\nSo A > 0\nSince difference between cost of two operations can only be positive,\nA = fixed cost when cleaning - cost when repair\nA=10*x+20*y-400=10*x-20*y\nA < 0\n(x,y) = (0,-4)\nLet (x,y) be the cost of cleaner (minimized cost) and (z,0) be cost of repairing it if you have to replace\n\ncost of replacement is 20*y\nIf you can work on cleaner, why not work on cleaner instead of repairing?\n\nSo cost of cleaning is the minimized cost", "answer": "A: good health"}

The lower part is filled and the top part is empty. The liquid has flowed from the top of the hourglass to the bottom, at a constant rate. If the rate at which the liquid fell each second is proportional to the volume of liquid left in the top half of the hourglass, how long does it take for the hourglass to empty? If the time is x seconds the solution is 1/6<<<1/6<0>>0.\nOutput: This is a lot more complicated then it sounds at first, so before you answer it try to map it out graphically.    You actually do want to write it out in terms of x seconds because the answer you get will be equivalent to a function in terms of x.\n\nYou're looking for a solution in terms of x, but x is not the only variable that you are allowed to play with. You are allowed to work with the variables as an equation and take partial derivatives.\nSo the simplest thing to do is set x=1 and then solve from there.\nThe question asks about an hourglass, so a good first approximation would be that the slope of the graph would be a constant.\nSo the answer is that the function should be f(x)= x/6.\nAlso keep in mind that the slope is a derivative.\nSo  x/6=f'(x)=0.\nAlso, notice that a derivative at a point is equal to the slope of the tangent line at that point.\nSo f'(1)=0, f'(-1/6)=0, and f'(1+1/6)=0 because 1, -1/6, and 1+1/6 are all equivalent to 1.\n\n\nInput: 4 and 5 is divided by 5 and result is 0.\nOutput:      This is a classic integer division\n\nInput:   2/2 = 1 3/3 = 1\nOutput:      4 divded by 2 is 2 4 divided by 3 is 1.6667", "answer": "D: lose weight"}

If a new sport, golf is introduced that includes eating, sleeping, and sports, which one of the three activities does he not like?\nOutput: We can use three or more lines of code or data in a program to provide the answer.\nThe first thing we need to do is get the activities.  We can do this by assigning them to variables.  We do this by typing Activity 1='eating' , Activity 2 ='sleeping' And Activity 3 ='sports'.  We are going to check to see if sport is John's favorite, or whether he likes sports or not.  if sport is John' choice, we will not let him do any sports, so we can just return the sports number or sport itself.  We can use either of these two options to do this.\n#The first option we check is the sport variable which we set to nothing, if sport==N/A or sport!=John's sport, or if the sport itself is not valid.  Another way to check this, or the only way to check this for multiple values, we can use a for loop and the length of the list.  We have to add the 'else' section so our output contains only the valid sports.  This will take some thinking, but check it out, you can get by now.  All these activities can be done with 3 or more lines in a program.  We can use three or four lines in a program to do this.\nInput:What is the value of number (3 ** 4) + number (5 ^3) - number (7 ** 1) + number (0 ** 0)?\nOutput: This is a question that was on my test.

So you cannot just do a brute force answer for this and you will have to break the numbers down to find one answer.\nI guessed a base 2 system and this came out as the answer.

So there are 100 to choose from using this base.  \nI guessed a different method but it did not work when I tried.  I came up with a base 200 because if someone changes one then it won't change the base.  But it is still a problem.

{"idx": 736, "text": "There are 8 Planets with this star, so the star is called by  \"THE SOLAR SYSTEM\"\n\n### Solution for Instruction 1)\nLet say n is the number of packages, so the total price of all the packages is $ <<3*12=\u00a336>>36. n is positive so n should be greater than 3. So one alternative is that \"if n is greater than 3, answer is equal to $36. If is greater than 3 but less than 4, answer is equal to what number less or equal to $36\" or \"if is greater than 3 and less than 4,answer is equal to $35\".  So n greater than 3 but n not equal to 4. So the alternative is that if n is greater than 1 and n not equal to 2, answer is equal to \u00a31.  So if n is actually n greater than 1 and not greater than 4, answer if m answer is equal to \u00a351. So the result is 51 when n actually  is greater than 1 but less or equal to 4.\n\n### Solution Instruction 2.\nSolution can be written as:\n\nLet a is the number of days that john spends in the gym. So a is positive. So the alternative is: \"if a is greater than one, answer is equal to 2\". So the answer is 2.  So the solution is: if a is greater than 1, answer is equal to <<2>>2.\n\n###Solution Instruction 3\nSo the total cost to refuel the plane is 240. So we subtract 40 from the new value, and we get 200. We add 40 more onto the value and multiply in order to calculate the new cost.\n2.0 * 100 / 60 * $200= <<2.0*100/60*<<200>>2.0\n200= <<new cost>>$.2\nSo the new price is 200*.8$.4\nFinal answer is 800.0$.00\nAnswer is wrong, so we have to enter wrong value and repeat the calculation to get the final answer.

These cute animals have many unique traits, but one interesting feature to them is that they are naturally born with an unnatural ability; all of them are born deaf.  With no way to communicate, they live in clans together, and although the clans have not come into contact with civilized humans, they have learned how to communicate with one another through complex rhythmic patterns.\n\nThe scientists and doctors that discovered them decided to help these clans by translating their dialect into human speech.  These new languages are now used worldwide by deaf people from all different countries.\n\nOne of the doctors of the Zebralo has been studying the languages that have been created from these new languages.  One of the patterns he found is that many of the languages contain sounds similar to the names of other languages.

It's just a reference that we are using it.\n- The first line in the Main() method, `Console.WriteLine(\"Hello programming\"),` sets the text property of the console window to this message.\n- The last line in the Main() Method, `Console.WriteLine()` outputs the text property.\n\nWe can run the code with the following command.\n\n```console\ndotnet run\n```\n\n> Result\n\n![Hello][hello]\n\n### Task 5.1: Run Code\n\nWe will now run code using the `dotnet run` command. Copy the code from your `hello.csharp` file to a text document in your `Output/code/` folder. Rename the filename to `hello.cs`. Then, you will be able to run the code.\n\n![hello][hello]\n\n\n### Task: Build a Menu\n\nNow that you've built and run code, it's time to create a menu using a function and decision statements.\nThe decision statement in C# is `if`.

The plane has enough gas to make the trip, but not quite enough to get back, unless the plane takes a shortcut along the coast.  However, as the plane is about to land, the pilot catches sight of an island that has a gas station on it.  A single man is working the station.  The plane has a tank in the belly.  The man offers the pilot 90 gallons of diesel that he could use to make the trip home.  The gas is 99% pure, and costs $3 per gallon.  The plane can hold 25 gallons, all of which will be expended.

I think the solution I am going to try is the following:\n    ```python\n    class solution:\n        def myPow(self, x, n):\n            if x == 0:\n                return 0\n            else:\n                return pow(x, n)\n    ```\n2. The first question was: \n    ```python\n    1. How many stickers remain? \n    ```\n\n   the idea was that we need to put in the total number of stickers, so the total number of stickies are: \n    ```bash\n    let = total = 89\n    ```\n    and we need to use the large stickers. \n    we are going to create a variable called used, and we will store total - used in it, then we need to iterate through the journal and for each page we print total - used. \n    and total - used must be equal or 0 because there are too much large sticker and we cant have used == total. so the answer is 44 \n\n   the second question was: \n\n    ```python\n        2. Zach is saving his money.  He earns $100, spending $50. After he spends $50, Zach will have $100-$50 = $50 in a bank account.  Zach can spend that money how many times in his life time before he runs out of money? \n     ```\n\n    in this type of question you can consider the bank account as a set, and in the set we don't add up the account we add up the money.\n\n    so in the set you can say that Zach has saved 65 dollars, so now his bank account is 65.\n\n    so at first i thought we should take the account, because it is a large, a set that has the same amount as the total money, but it's not because we are adding up or sets.\n\n    so because of that reason, we're going to print two sets where the first one is a set of the amount remaining in his bank account and the second set  is a set of the 10 dollars as multiplier to print. and then the answer must be 6, since they match up, and after 6 times,", "answer": "B: hall"}

{"idx": 964, "text": "A\n\nIn class we took the sum of N = N(1... B) and divided it by the sum of 1 - (1... B) and added 1 (and we called that sum B).  That sum seemed to be what we needed for the \"ninjas\" part so we used that as the input for the sum.  Now I have a question for the class.  \nThe next step was to divide it by the input.  Since we divide first - the input for the B part is multiplied by a factor of two, and then divided by the B we got (which is the same as a \"remainder\" on the expression (1...B), the result is 1, so our solution ends up at 2^2-1 (since we multiply it by a factor of two to get the input for the B).  \nHow did that happen?\n\nInput:  \n156\n\nOutput:  \n214\n\n### Solution:\n\nFor the first problem, the correct output should be 44.  \nWe can set up the equation like below \n\n    (89 - 3 - 7 - 7)\n\nBy solving, we get 44.

How many times do you have to repeat the execution in order for the number of stickers to go from 1000 to 0? (Ask your son. He may know the answer).\nOutput:The input is 1000. To convert to output, divide by 100. The algorithm would be: 1000/100=10. To execute the algorithm, you would start at 10 and subtract 1 each time that you get to the number 0(one zero). You would then start again at 10 and do the same thing.  To obtain the answer, take the square root. This means you would run the algorithm 4 times: 1002=10(101-010=102,103-010=9,104-10=9,and then go back to 10 again).\n\nInstruction:How do you determine the maximum value of the following array?

Choices:  Pencil case   School supplies   School bag   Snack\nOutput:A\n\n\n\n##### Explanation: In the first example, Mary has 89 stickers with her and she used 3 for the cover and then 7 for a total of 7 pages. This means that she has remaining 78 stickers.\nIn the second example, Zach can save up $100 but since he already has 65 dollars, he has to save up another $35 in order to buy the $100 bike. But the problem says he can save up $7 per hour which means he can save up $140 dollars in 20 hours. That means he needs to save an additional $40 dollars to fulfil his $100 goal.\nIn the third example, \"I know that\" means that that person has to explain what that equation is about. Jan went to the auditoriorim, so he would find himself at the A choice.\nIn the fourth example, 15=ABC because Pencil case has 15 items, School supplies has 15 and ABC also has the number 15 in it.\n\n##### Difficulty:Hard\n\n### Instruction:Answer the questions about this animation.\n\n\n\n### Link:\n[Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70524835/java-for-loop-how-to-assign-values-for-each-character-input-of-string).\n\n\n##### Differences:\n1.

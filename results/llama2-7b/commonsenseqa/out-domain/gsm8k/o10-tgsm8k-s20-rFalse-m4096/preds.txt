A good way to practice these kinds of problems while preparing for interviews is to build the solution slowly. Let's say the largest value in the input array is 12. Once you've found the largest number, your function should write the index of that number to any variable. That index should come from the index of your array. Now your function should have some code to find the value in that variable. It should be one more than the one in that array. It should then go through every index in the array and subtract 1 from the value at that index. Once you've done that, you should see if the result is the number that is one more than the maximum value in the array, the largest value, or 0.<n><n>I can make 39 by taking 4, and 4 of them is 16.<n><n>Taking 16, I can multiply the number of candies by 2, which is 32. Adding that 2, I get 34. Adding 6, I get 40. Subtracting 40 from 46 gives me 6. Taking 2 of that, my answer is 12.<n><n><n><n><n><n>

For instance, how long customers are staying at each table, how many people are coming and going in the establishment, and how much time is spent at different checkpoints throughout the restaurant. To predict customer behavior, restaurants are mining their collected data to analyze customer spending habits, wait times, and even how customers react to various menu items. To predict turnover, restaurants are able to predict the number of resignations they might have in the near future. These predictions allow restaurants to plan for employee turnover and reforecast sales. These forecasts often include predictions about traffic and occupancy of a restaurant or the number of servers to hire for peak times, as well as the number of customers to expect. What other predictions can data mining help the restaurants make?<n>Output: What if you could predict a guest's desire to return to the restaurant?

A class `InputFile` represents the input file itself, which contains an abstract class `Line` containing a member `contents`, that's a `std::string`, which contains the contents of a single line. A class `Inference` represents a single line that needs to be inferred, and can be thought of as the program itself. A class `State` represents a single state of the program, with a member `value`. The `inference` class takes references to the inference file, inference, state, and line classes to maintain state and the inference of the program. Inference classes can be thought of as a stack that has a "done" state and a state with an unknown state on top.<n><n>###<n><n>This problem uses the following input file:<n><n>```<n>1:10 20 20<n>35<n>```<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the Questions below.<n><n><n>1.What are the objects within `Inference`?

The houses on the street are generally divided up by lot size. The first time a house is sold or listed it sets the standard for the lot size of the house. The other aspects of the house influence the price: a big house on a large lot, a brand new house on a small lot, and an expensive house on a small lot are all rare, so the house is worth significantly more. Over time, the average size of houses and the average age of houses will be larger, and so a new house built on a big lot will be significantly more expensive than a big house on a small lot.  The price varies by lot size for houses that are all around the same age, because of supply and demand.

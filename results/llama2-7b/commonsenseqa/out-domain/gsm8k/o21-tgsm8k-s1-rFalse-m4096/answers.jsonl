There is a zoo not too far from Rex's house. There are four dingos at the zoo. Rex and his friends want to take a trip to the zoo. They plan to go from Rex's home in Queensland to the zoo in Victoria. They all agree to meet at a certain time along the way. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, only two dingos can arrive on time. Both arrive at the meeting point at 8:00 a.m. The remaining two dingos, Tess and Ruby, arrive in the order of Ruby at 9:10 a.m. and Tess at 9:20 a.m. Unfortunately, only Ruby manages to arrive at the zoo, where she remains. She decides to wait at her favourite place for the remaining dingos to appear. Rex decides that he will not visit the zoo until all his friends arrive. This is because he has no guarantee that he will be able to spend the time at the zoo with one or all of the others. Ruby and Tess meet at the zoo entrance. Tess runs up to the entrance and calls to Ruby through the fence: \"Hello, Ruby.\" Ruby can hear her but cannot say anything in return.

The Factorical() method counts based on the base 10 format and not base 2 like I originally did in the question where I attempted to use the binomial() function. When you take the factorial() method, you don't use the +1, +2, +3 and so on. I realized this after I tried using the binomial() function and that was when I made my changes to the code.\n```python\ndef counting_pairs(arr):\n\n    for i in range(30):\n        # arr[0], arr[1], arr[2]\n        # arr[3], arr[4], arr[5]...\n        # print((' '.join(map(','.join, zip(arr, arr[i:]))), len(arr)), end=\" \")\n        #arr == (arr[0], arr[i:], arr[1],...) == (2, 5,..., 30) = [2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]\n        #arr == [19, 1, 2, 5", "answer": "C: hockey game"}

The problem statement is pretty clear, or it can be inferred from several other puzzles like this.\n\nComment: Sorry I just edited it :P\n\nComment: I still only see 7 puzzles (you have 9 listed above).  I guess I don't understand the logic of the 7th puzzel, or do not understand the solution, so the code is confusing to me.  The last puzzle is very easy to compute the result of the output.  For puzzle 7 (and I presume puzzle 8), if you are calculating the remainder when dividing 117 by some divisor (X) that is not a whole number (not 100% divisible by that divisor), then the result is always not a whole number.  You have a formula that you seem to be applying to get that remainder, but I am not sure what is going on with your code.\n\nComment: I am also wondering about the question that mentions'stickers'.  Did you run that through some program to figure out what it was?

This means that the coals weigh 11.7g/0.4g = 29.75g.\nTo avoid division by zero, you should ignore any answers where you get zero g of coal.\n\n\n\n\n\n```\nlet coals  = 29.80;\nlet tmax = 360 ;\nlet tsoup = 230 ;\n// 100g/m2k; 25g/m2k ~ 0.4\nlet coef = 100;\n```\nlet tdiff = ( tmax - tsoup) * coef;\n```\nlet result = coals * (tsoup/tmax) * tdiff;\n```\nconsole.log(result)", "answer": "D: school grade"}

Choices:  A: bathroom B: closet C: school D: room E: church<n>Output:		School<n><n>*[https://leetcode.com/problems/folding-chairs/](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems.php?filter=weekly/2020/178)<n><n>## Solution:<n><n>- [1](https://leetx.site/problem_solution_files/404.cpp) The number of stickers she has left after using 3 large stickers and 7 stickers to 6 other pages would be `24-12 = 12` stickers.<n><n>- [2](https://leetstuck.top/2020-09-09) `65+10+10+7 +2 = 94`<n><n>- [3](https://leetcodespanish.com/20200826) We are given the total amount of goats, and we need to know the total amount of legs. Therefore our equation will be `total amount of legs = total amount of animals * (number of legs of a goat + number of legs of a kangaroo)` So `amount of legs = 23 * (3 + 4 + 2)` So `442` Since there are 23 kangaroo's and `(23 * 3 + 23*4 + 23*2) = 442`

(But it still has to leave a remainder of 1)<n>-   But you then you want to know, after you've divided every possible number that you can divide by n the least remainder, what number did you get.  (We're talking the remainder, not the quotient...)<n><n>-   After you've done that, you then need to solve the same problem, but for all numbers of 2 less than n,  i.e. you do it all again for n - 2 and so on for every number 2 less than that one that you did it for before.<n><n>-   You do this for every possible number that's between 0 and n, to complete all the steps.<n><n>-   Finally you need to divide that number by every possible number up to the largest prime number that's divisible by n.  (Remember all primes are either odd or multiples of 2.  But you can still just do this once, because we now know the exact numbers that we have to do it for.) <n><n>-   And then you do the same thing again, but for each number (other than the last number you divided n by) that is two less than that particular n, i.e. you start with the first division of n by every number for every number 2 times that until<n><n>-   you are doing it for 2.<n><n>But again, just do it for all possible numbers of a certain type.<n><n>In the end... you should have all these numbers

Choices:  A: happiness B: lack of money C: stress D: relief E: exhiliration<n>Output:		E <n><n>### Instruction:Answer the previous multiple choice question in words.<n><n>The total number of legs is equal to the total number of kangaroos plus the total number of goats. Mark has 23 kangoaroos. So, we know that there are 23 kangaroo legs. He, then, has three times as many goat legs as kangaroo legs which we can write as 3L. That is, if his goat legs were doubled then the two numbers would be the same but there is only one goat leg. So, we know we have to multiply 3 by the number we are looking for, we multiply the number of kangaroo legs times the number of goat legs. We know that we have 23 kangasoos and 3 times as many goat leg and there are an even number of goat legs times an even number of kangaros which is 46. We know that the total number of legs combined is 69. It is now up to us to solve for the number that we are trying to find. So, we cross multiply and see that the answer is 46.<n>

Then we put the resulting sum in a different variable so we can call it later. Then we used the result, 84, from before, to subtract from 130-85, or 45. Then, we used addition.<n><n>* On the second question, a similar approach. We firstly convert the value if not an integer to int(), then we add. When we have the answer, we convert it back to an integer so we can call it again on the 3rd question. For the third question, we add 25 from the previous question, the variable in the question. After that, we subtract 30. And finally, we use subtraction to get the rest. <n>

They decided to leave and walk a ways to a more open spot.  After walking for a while, they decide to stop.  After a few minutes of sitting and resting, and drinking from a small canteen, the cowboy feels too hot and pulls out a lighter to let some air inside of his jacket.  The fumes from the lighter ignite the jacket and he is burnt by the fire and begins to slowly fall towards the ground.  He grabs hold of the dog and they fall in the middle of nowhere.  As they lay and wait for day to break, the cowboy says, â€œI wonder how far we are from town.â€�  The dog replies, â€œAbout two miles, there is a farm down there, we are sure to catch their attention.â€�  After a couple miles of walking through the sand, they come across a farm that seems pretty deserted.  They walk up to the house and knock.  About 5 minutes of waiting, they get the attention of Mrs. Smith.  She is very surprised to see the cowboy and the dog and quickly invites them into the house to rest.  She asks again, â€œWhat are you two doing way out here on this land looking like this??â€�  The cowboy replies, â€˜Between you and me there is nothing to doâ€™.<n><n>### Output:<n><n>Input: A: at the zoo<n><n>Output: The answer is A<n>

We will run it with the machine set to input from STDIN and output to STDOUT.  The program will be given as a binary integer (base 2) string.  For example, if the program would output 'hello' as the output, it would be given input of "00101".  The first string (the first row) would be one binary number long, the second string (the second row) would be two binary numbers long, etc.<n><n>The number of rows and columns for each program will always be equal to the size of the input (rows = input.length and columns = input.length).  Each row in your program would be one binary number longer than the binary input.  For example, 4 rows given input of "0110" would need to be the binary representation of 4x4 numbers plus one extra row (0001).  This ensures that the last row is correct, which would be the last binary number given to the program in its input.<n><n>We will not give you a test file or example program or input/output to use to check your code beforehand.  You can use the online binary calculator (see below) and the online binary converter for decimal numbers (see below) to debug your program.<n><n>#### Binary Calculator:https://www.binaryconverter.net/binary-calculator<n><n>#### Binary Converter:https://www.convertbinary.com<n><n>### Input and Output:<n>#### Example Input:<n>`0101000110001`<n><n>#### Example Output:<n>`0001110`<n><n>###

We worked on using loops to solve multiple problems.

I was trying to determine if the question was even answerable.  I've been taught before that this would have been a question that required guessing and checking as a way to solve but I took a different approach and actually wrote code to answer it. I came to the conclusion that it would be possible to write code that could answer this question. This question can be answered using the 'not in' function in Python but doing it this way it does not make sense to do so.  Using the 'not in' will give you True or False, but by simply writing a new for loop and checking for True or False depending on if it's the right answer, it is more straightforward to write a program than the 'not in' method. The 'and' function is a logical operator. The reason I had the 'not in' operator not working was because a True or False output does not make sense because the whole purpose of the question is for the user to figure out that it would not work. So, as a programmer, writing a 'not in' won't work because it will not create a True/False output that the user can utilize. So, in

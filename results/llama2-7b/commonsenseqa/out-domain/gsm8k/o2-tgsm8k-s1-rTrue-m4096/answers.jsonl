Let's assume the customer bought the 50 lb bag of kitty liter + 12 containers of cat food + 48 cans of cat food.  I will divide the 50 lb kitty litter into 50 because each lb equals 50 divisions (this is not the easiest way to do it, but it works) + 60 containers, the price of one 5 lb container of cat food + 54 cans of cat food = =<<8+185>>193 The total is $<<8+193= 201>>201 more than the cost of the food\n\nInput:A 5 ounce can of soda costs $1.35.

To do so, you make a grid of 6 rows and 6 columns. You add your guess to the first row and then go to each other row. If your guess is correct on any of them, you erase that guess and continue. If your guess is incorrect, then you add to one column to continue to the next. You stop when your guess is correct. How many guesses does it take on average? \nOutput: You average 1 + 5 + 9 + 13 + 17 + 19 because there are a total of 5 rows 7 columns, since you move the rows. You take an average of the 1 + 5+9+13+17+19 giving you an average of <<1+5+9+1+17+9+13>> <<=1+5+9++13+17>>  = 9. \n\nOutput: We can plug in our first row values of 1 and the sum of 9 + 9 is 18.  The second row average is 9 as well.  The third row is 1 + 19 for a sum of 20, the fourth 1 + 9 for a sum of total of 10 and the fifth row is a sum of 18.  For the sixth row, we are at the sum of 9, adding 1 to the first row (1 + 1).  So that makes 10 for the sixth row.

The program takes in a string of alphanumeric characters as input and makes choices based on the alphabetical, numerical or random number of characters within the string. The program also has a built-in dictionary that is used to recognize the characters in the string and determine if it is an uppercase word, a lowercase word, or a random string of alphanumeric or mixed characters. The resulting output is shown for each of the three cases, so the programmer can see what the program will generate as the output.

To get binary, you just need to represent the number of ones that are in the decimal. You would simply divide the decimal number by 2, and then get the remainder of the decimal.  You would do this over and over until you no longer get a remainder.\n\nBinary (2 to the first power).\n 0 = 2 to the 0th power = 1 \n 1=2 to the 1st", "answer": "C: space shuttle"}

The difference of those two numbers is 5. What are the two numbers?\nOutput: The two numbers are 37 & 17\nExplanation: The sum of two given numbers is 19 and the difference of those two numbers are 5. So, add those two numbers to obtain a total of 37. Then add that total with the difference of the two numbers, you would get 37+5= 42 then subtract the whole 42-2= 40 and that 40 is for subtracting the two numbers subtracting 10 from 37 and from 17 subtracting 13.\n5+2= 7\n13-2= 11\n\nInput: An elf who was born in 1999 is 4 years old which was an even number.

{"idx": 416, "text": "Examine means A, Stare means B, Go somewhere means C, hear news means D, See Favorite Show means E\nIf you choose to examine something it might be a person, like your reflection in a mirror, or it might be an object, such as a book or a rock. Both a person and an article can be examined.\nIf you wish to look at someone, the examination might be an expression of interest.  It could, though, result in displeasure if the person is uncooperative. Look could also mean to examine.\nTo look at food could lead to a decision about whether or not to partake.  Looking at art can be a source of inspiration to copy, while looking at nature and animals is a source of pleasure in many different contexts.\nIf you examine something, you can also evaluate it.  Considering the cost versus the value of a purchase is an example of an examination and evaluation.\nStare:Stare doesn't necessarily mean just looking.  If you gape, you stare in a way that conveys surprise or shock.  When you're a baby you stare, but as you age, you don't stare often because society frowns upon it.  When you stare at someone you're likely to engage in behavior that you wouldn't if you had your eyes focused on some object of interest.\nGo Somewhere is pretty straight.  When you've been asked to go someplace, the verb go is the most common choice. That you choose go to as your answer is a good indication that you have a tendency for planning and organization.  In many ways, go someplace is a kind of command.\nIf you need to know information that is current, you turn to the news media.  You can hear the news on television or radio, listen to it in print, stream it online, or hear or read it when you're with a crowd.

When you know what you're doing, you can probably say things like, \"I'll just check Facebook for a minute and then watch my favorite show.\"  The expression, \"watch your favorite program\" fits the context of looking at what you prefer.

This answer choice explains that all products can be purchased from selling desire, spending money, or money.\n\n\n# Question 1 \n## Part B #\nI believe I have the right answer for Part B but I am uncertain about my reasoning. In the last section of the questions, we are given a picture of a rectangle and a circle. We know the square has a radius (A) of 8 units and a side (C) of 12 units. We are then given a side of the rectangle is 15 units and the rectangle has a perimeter of 55 units. We are told we are to find A and B. My reasoning is that because the rectangle fits inside of the square and is a smaller version of the square, we can divide the sides of the rectangle to find the radius. Since the side of the rectangle is (C) and the diagonal of the square is 8 units long, we can make a ratio comparison to find A. \n\nA= 8* (C)/15= <<8* 12/15>>8*12/15 = 8-C/15 <0<0 >\nA = 7 - 3/15 <0 <0 >  \n\nThere is one more question about this problem that I do not know where to go with.

This can be hard to know when you first start programming, because functions don\u2019t have the same appearance as they would, say, in math.  But you will often run into functions early on while learning to code, so it\u2019s helpful to know what they actually are, how they are created, and what they do.\n\n---\nInput : A function should take in some value (sometimes called the _argument_ or _input_).  Then, it should _return_ a result based on the value that it received.\nFor example:\n```\nreturn \"Hello, Mr.\" + firstName + \"!\"\n```\nThis is a function called `sayHello` that takes one argument (a string called `firstName`), then returns the word \"Hello\".\nThe arguments for most functions are simple strings, but they could also be numbers, lists, or anything for that matter.  The types of each argument are called _parameters_.\n\n---\nInput: The _parameters_ are just there so you can call your function, like we just did in our example:\n```\nvar firstName = \"Jack\"\nsayHello(firstName)\n```\n_Note: You do not need to capitalize or quote the _parameter.__ The parameter has already been created and defined with the function.\n\nThere are multiple _return statements_ in JavaScript.\nYou can use a return statement to:\n\n-   Stop the function immediately\n-   Provide a return for the function\n-   Return a value such as the answer for a logic problem\n-   Change the context for the rest of the function\n\n---\nInput:: Here is an example of a return statement.  Note that we are returning a string variable but not capitalizing it.\n\n```\nvar lastName = \"Smith\"\nsayHello(lastName)\n```\nFunctions are also useful for breaking a function into multiple steps.\n\nFor example we could easily create a function that would remove characters from a string:  To remove the last 3", "answer": "B: museum"}

In that word you can see that the word is broken down into \"con\" + \"grat\" + \"u\" = \"congrat\"+uales, so you know a question asking to figure out which type of word 'congratulations' is will involve you removing letter/s from 'congratulations'.\n- If you are looking at a word you know you will have to break down into parts, go back to using the alphabet\n- If a question asks your to pick the first word and is asking you to choose something in between letters, think about how to spell those letters\n- in the question about the 3 large stickers, it was important to spell out the word \"front\" which would be 3 letters, so you know this means each book page has 3 letter name that can be used.\n- think if a word starts or has 'i' at the end of word, you will find \"i'\" between the 'i' and the word (think about how to spell \"i\"), then this will lead you to picking a word that starts with a 'i', and the following letter will be the 'o' that fits between the 'i' on the end of the word to give you the first option. \n- The answer had 6 letters, 3 that was already known 'c', and 3 unknown letters, then you know you have to break the word down into groups of 3, so you need to start to take out the 3 unknown letters and put it in front of 3 words then you will be finished\n- Think of \"book\", you know the 3 letter name on a book page is \"b\", then you'll need to add between 3 and 5 letters to the end 'ok' then place '", "answer": "B: orchestra"}

More concepts will be explored in the next two sections.\n\nThe second problem, involving Zach (poor, poor Zach!), has a bit more input in terms of the number of hours we can babysit.

Money is required, but it is certainly not the most important duty of a parent.\nThe happiness of a child flows as a natural corollary to the proper care they are given.  It is not important for a parent to be able to provide the greatest possible happiness for their child if the child is not being properly cared for.  A child cannot be very happy if they don't have food, are exposed to harsh elements, or are living in a dangerously dirty environment.\nThe parental duty is to provide shelter, warmth, security, cleanliness, education, and love to their child.  The child should not have to work or seek these natural needs, as they should come from the parent's care for the child.\nThere is little, if any, joy to be seen from a child that is not being properly catered for, and that joy is the most important and primary need of all people.

If you don't know the answer, but you'd like to be encouraged you might want to keep reading.  The riddle begins: \"There are x things that have x different ys. Each y is either greater than 0 or less than 0, and each y is not equal to 0. Each y is not equal to -1, either.  Choose 2 things from the x things and there is either 0,1, or 2 differences between them, and the x - 2 things have either 0, 1, or 2 ys which are either greater than 0, or less than 0 which are not equal to -1.\"  How many of the things have a positive y?\nOutput:We know that the answer must be even, since the x things must have an even number of positive y's, so we should have a choice that eliminates odd numbers.  The y's are not equal to 0, -1, or -2, so we know we don't need to subtract by two as often, so the answer must be even.  We also know that all the y's aren't equal to 1, but they're all greater than -1.  We can assume that if the answer is 8 or higher that there will be more y's, so that we're not doing a lot of subtractions by two with more y's than that.  It has to be a whole number, since it's not smaller than -1.  It has to meet the criteria of either 0,1 or 2 of the differences between x and x-2, either less than 0, or greater than 0.

You should then print out the ASCII character for that number using print() if possible.  You may want to define an array or struct called character that contains the characters for each integer between (not including) 0 and (not including) 46.  All print() function calls should print exactly 1 character each.  You should use a \"for loop\" to loop through the integer and the character array as necessary to ensure you have an array with the right characters.\n\n\n# Option 2\n## Description\nFor Option 2, you will again create a program that takes in an integer.  This time however you will print out the name for that integer.  To make this work, you will have to create a hash table with keys equal to all integers 0 through 39 (or 40 if you wish to include zero in your list), and values equal to the words for the integers.  You should do at least one more test to ensure that you haven't printed off all of the integers (otherwise your program will give the wrong answer).\n\n### Instructions (Option 1)\nInput: A: <0, '0'>, <1, '1'>, <2, '2'>, <3, '3'>, <4, '4'>, <5, '5'>, <6, '6'>, <7, '7'>, <8, '8'>, <9, '9'>\n\n\n### Output\nOutput:  The characters", "answer": "B: magazines"}

To solve, you need to determine how many seconds the dog had already fallen before reaching the bottom (if no time difference between cowboy and dog, then both passed the bottom at the same time!).\nThe dog fell 4 seconds after he passed the cowboy, so, he was 4 seconds ahead of the cowboy and 12 seconds behind a cowboy (12 = 4 + 8).\nThis means the dog has fallen 8 seconds more than the cowboy when he passed him.\n8 seconds are added to the cowboy's passing point, and it's now 8 seconds further away.\nCowboy's time is now 1 second before hitting the bottom and the dog hit the bottom 6 seconds sooner than him.\nCowboy and dog hit the bottom 5+6 = <<5+6=11>>11 seconds apart (5 + 8 seconds before hitting bottom - dog and 1 + 6 seconds after hitting bottom - cowboy).\nDifferentiate this 11 seconds between the dog and the cowboy from how many seconds the cowboy was behind the dog from falling and that will give you the distance between the cowboy and dog (11sec - 8sec = 3sec = 3.7182818282828.. feet)\n\nInput: Mary's heights when she was 1, 2 and 4 years old are recorded in the list [", "answer": "A: problems"}

Choices: There is no 3rd apple.\nOutput:\nTo find the answer, you must use the given information that there are 2 weeks and 4 bananas and 3 apples\n\nThe first week you will consume 4 bananas and eat 3 apples.  During the second week, you will have 3 bananas and 2 apples.  That makes 7 bananas and 5 apples\nYou need both bananas and apples to divide in equal parts over 2 weeks. 4 bananas and a half apples would make the second week unbalanced. 2 bananas and 2.5 apples would make the first week unbalanced.\nIn fact, if you divided them evenly there is no solution for this problem which is why there is no third apple.", "answer": "E: reproduce"}

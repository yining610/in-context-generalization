Choices:  A: excitement B: fatigue C: anger D: hurting E: getting tired<n>Output:		Answer: Answer: A.  Excitement. Exercise, even moderate exercise, gives me a good feeling about myself and can even lift my mood, making me excited. It is the body's reaction to the increased oxygen in the blood that increases our endorphins and makes us feel good. In fact, even just a 20-minute walk has been proven to decrease our depression level as well as stress.<n>Excitement is the one emotion that soccer definitely does not cause.<n>In my experience I have found that most of the time I get angry, which is caused by the stress of playing the game for so long.<n>Sometimes I get tired as well but even that is mostly caused by having to run around, rather than the soccer itself.<n>Therefore, as you can see, the only answer that is completely incorrect is option B, fatigue, and I'm sure I'm not the only person who has felt frustrated after playing for a long time.<n><n>

Was the customer planning on adopting a new pet?<n>Output: The price of the cat food does not matter.  If a customer receives 3 ounces or 36 ounces, these do not affect the total amount a customer buys.  Let's assume the customer bought the 50 lb bag of kitty liter + 12 containers of cat food + 48 cans of cat food.  I will divide the 50 lb kitty litter into 50 because each lb equals 50 divisions (this is not the easiest way to do it, but it works) + 60 containers, the price of one 5 lb container of cat food + 54 cans of cat food = =<<8+185>>193 The total is $<<8+193= 201>>201 more than the cost of the food<n><n>Input:A 5 ounce can of soda costs $1.35.

How many chocolates does she give to her other friend?<n>Output:Sophie has 72 chocolate which she divided equally to each of her friends who have 9 each. The remaining of 72 divided by 9(number chocolate each friend gets) is <<72/9=8>>8<n>The last person whose chocolate is 96-8=<<96-8=90>>90 chocolates.

A year later, Sally used the exact same 5 dressers to furnish her room.  What percentage of Sally's payment (including tax) was used for tax and fees?<n>Output: Sally's total payment after tax + fees included $900-$x=<<900-x>>900 - tax - fees.<n>In total, her tax + fees was $x%900 = $<<x%900>>%x of $900 after subtracting tax and fees.<n>So if you divide her tax + fees by 900, then her tax + fees is 0.111111% of her payment.<n><n>If Sally bought the same 5 dressers again, then she probably paid for her first tax and fees again.<n>A year later, Sally would pay $900-$0.111%900 $<<900-0.111>%900>>0.111 * 5 = 5.55555% for tax and fees <n>

You add your guess to the first row and then go to each other row. If your guess is correct on any of them, you erase that guess and continue. If your guess is incorrect, then you add to one column to continue to the next. You stop when your guess is correct. How many guesses does it take on average? <n>Output: You average 1 + 5 + 9 + 13 + 17 + 19 because there are a total of 5 rows 7 columns, since you move the rows. You take an average of the 1 + 5+9+13+17+19 giving you an average of <<1+5+9+1+17+9+13>> <<=1+5+9++13+17>>  = 9. <n><n>Output: We can plug in our first row values of 1 and the sum of 9 + 9 is 18.  The second row average is 9 as well.  The third row is 1 + 19 for a sum of 20, the fourth 1 + 9 for a sum of total of 10 and the fifth row is a sum of 18.  For the sixth row, we are at the sum of 9, adding 1 to the first row (1 + 1).  So that makes 10 for the sixth row.

We use this for loop to iterate through and store the user input of the first character in the variable "first" and the last character in the variable "last".<n>"If" loops determine which code is run under what condition with "if... else...fi" statements and the "while...do" statements. "While" statements allow us to check whether a defined condition is TRUE or FALSE.<n>"for" loops are loops that loop through a certain number of times through the items in a list of some sort.<n><n>In the while Loops(a part of the for loop) we loop through the variables again. We calculate this in the do: block and it informs the user how many times x is bigger than 5.<n>The variables store the values of the user inputted number and after the while loops and for loops are exited, we print out the results to the user.<n><n>### Sources:<n>-https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_if_else.asp<n><n>### Code:<n><n>```<n>do1:<n>    for(;;){<n>        /* input */<n>        first = input();<n>        last = input();<n><n>        if (first < 65 || last > 90 || last < first)<n>            break;<n><n>        /* calculate length */<n>        n = last - first;<n>        len = n == 1? 1 : n < 2? 0 : 1+(n-1)/n;<n><n>        /* print all results */<n>        for (i = 0; i < len; i++)<n>        {<n><n>            if (

This is  is a position on what? Choices:  A: violin case B: symphony orchestra C: class D: learning to play violin E: music store<n>Output:		The correct answer is C: Class because a class means all the students are the same grade.  As a first violinist, John plays in a large symphony where many students will have various grades so the class is not correct.  As a violinist, John has learned the position of first violin therefore he has learned how to play the instrument, so he cannot be in the class learning to learn how to play it.  He is part of a class orchestra so this has been eliminated as an answer choice for this phrase.  John is the first in the symphony, not the violin case which stores the violin.  The violins are put in a case during the classroom orchestra class before they are sent out to play in the symphony orchestra.<n><n>Input:John is so excited to be in an orchestra.

This way of programming involves the use of the input of another program to generate an output result depending on the format of the program, so the programming has a logic rather than fixed syntax. The program takes in a string of alphanumeric characters as input and makes choices based on the alphabetical, numerical or random number of characters within the string. The program also has a built-in dictionary that is used to recognize the characters in the string and determine if it is an uppercase word, a lowercase word, or a random string of alphanumeric or mixed characters. The resulting output is shown for each of the three cases, so the programmer can see what the program will generate as the output. I would like to see if I can use this programming technique in my own programming.<n><n>## Instruction:Write about your experience of this class and the projects you have been assigned in it.<n><n>I really enjoyed my first computer class, and it was good to see how the computer programs I created worked and how the programs I would use in my final projects would be created.

I wanted to try and do an equation that would equal a specific answer after putting parameters into the equations. Once I found an equation I realized I was now going to have to figure out how to write it in the most efficient way and what variables it would require to run smoothly. I ended up trying a few equations before I came up with the final outcome below. I was pretty proud of the way that I was able to write a working equation that did not require me to write out the multiplication of values manually. I also think that it is important to know how to write out an equation so when I find something that is a bit complicated I know where to start figuring out the problem.  <n><n>```javascript<n>var total = document.getElementById('target').value;<n>var pages = document.getElementsByClassName('pages');<n>var pages_number = pages[1].getAttribute("data-number");<n>var number = total / pages_number / pages_number;<n><n>document.getElementsByClassName('result').innerHTML = number;<n>```<n>

He couldn't get out the door.  He was very frightened when the smoke detectors went off, but luckily it was a false alarm.  Why might he be stuck? Choices:  A: fire B: belong to C: winter storm D: face south E: burn down<n>Output:		John was stuck in his house because the door led out of the house is facing north and when he tried to open it the house went up in flames.  It would make sense that the door is facing the same direction that it's on because it's easier and he is likely to always face the same way to enter and leave a room.

Choices:  A: nuclear power plant B: center C: basement D: main office E: bowel of the ship<n>Output:		If there are only four possible choices, the answer must be A, B, C, or D.  No other choice could be on the list so we can exclude E.  We can also eliminate the choices that do not include the words "mucus plunger" as those could not be possible answers.   The only choices left are A, B, C and D.<n>Since the choices include a mucus plunger, the answer must be either B or D.  We must eliminate A.  B will take you to the Nuclear Power plant and D will take us to the main office.<n>Since D takes you to the main office and C has the letter M, the answer D takes us to the main office and B to the nuclear power plant.<n><n>The answer is: D<n><n>Input:What does the first letter of a math equation mean?Choices: A: sum B: term C: constant D: difference E: addition<n>Output: According to our answer, the constant means A, so we have to eliminate choices D and E.  The term would mean it was either B or C, so let's eliminate both B and C.  The sum appears to mean D, but the constant is already set as A.  So the sum must mean D as well.  E would equal addition, so we can eliminate C as well.<n>The only remaining choices are A, D and E.<n>We know A and E stands for addition and subtraction and the constant does not do subtraction, which leaves choice D as the solution, as the answer is D<n><n>Input:If you see an owl, you're supposed to spray it with a bottle of ink. Choices: A: squirt your arm B: spray it 3 times C: shake it and wait for a reaction D: throw a rock<n>Output: According to the answer, the choice that is correct is A.  We know it doesn't mean B, because you throw rocks instead of spray it.  C means you take care of it and doesn't involve ink at all.  D means you throw a rock, so that doesn't work.  That leaves A as the correct choice, the answer is A<n><n>Input:On the back of a dime there are 13 ____, one for each of our nation’s original 13 colonies.<n>

Choices:  A: sitting down B: excitement C: tiredness D: progress E: procrastination<n>Output:		The correct answer is C.<n>Explanation: A person has trouble beginning work when they're tired. It's impossible to finish something if you don't begin it in the first place. There may be times when you have too much to do and you won't be able to start it all but you can still start it. You do that by choosing a certain activity you like or at least one that you don't hate so much and then start that.<n><n>Input: How many baskets can a candy maker fill with candy in this situation: there are 36 total people at a party and each person has a one-quarter pound bag of candy to share, there are 18 people in each basket, and there is 2 people per basket?<n>Output: There are 36 baskets and each weighs 32 ounces. (The number of baskets = 36. Each basket weighs 5.04 pounds (1/4 lb) x (18/2) people per basket = 26.21 pounds)<n>Explanation: In the question, it states that there are 18/2 people per basket. So the 18 is for each basket and 2 is how many people per basket. Then, "there is 2 people per each basket" means there's 2 people, each in their own basket.<n><n>Input: The sum of two numbers is 19. The difference of those two numbers is 5. What are the two numbers?<n>Output: The two numbers are 37 & 17<n>Explanation: The sum of two given numbers is 19 and the difference of those two numbers are 5. So, add those two numbers to obtain a total of 37. Then add that total with the difference of the two numbers, you would get 37+5= 42 then subtract the whole 42-2= 40 and that 40 is for subtracting the two numbers subtracting 10 from 37 and from 17 subtracting 13.<n>5+2= 7<n>13-2= 11<n><n>Input: An elf who was born in 1999 is 4 years old which was an even number.

Choices:  A: examine thing B: stare into a mirror C: go somewhere D: hear news E: see favorite show<n>Output:		Examine means A, Stare means B, Go somewhere means C, hear news means D, See Favorite Show means E<n>If you choose to examine something it might be a person, like your reflection in a mirror, or it might be an object, such as a book or a rock. Both a person and an article can be examined.<n>If you wish to look at someone, the examination might be an expression of interest.  It could, though, result in displeasure if the person is uncooperative. Look could also mean to examine.<n>To look at food could lead to a decision about whether or not to partake.  Looking at art can be a source of inspiration to copy, while looking at nature and animals is a source of pleasure in many different contexts.<n>If you examine something, you can also evaluate it.  Considering the cost versus the value of a purchase is an example of an examination and evaluation.<n>Stare:Stare doesn't necessarily mean just looking.  If you gape, you stare in a way that conveys surprise or shock.  When you're a baby you stare, but as you age, you don't stare often because society frowns upon it.  When you stare at someone you're likely to engage in behavior that you wouldn't if you had your eyes focused on some object of interest.<n>Go Somewhere is pretty straight.  When you've been asked to go someplace, the verb go is the most common choice. That you choose go to as your answer is a good indication that you have a tendency for planning and organization.  In many ways, go someplace is a kind of command.<n>If you need to know information that is current, you turn to the news media.  You can hear the news on television or radio, listen to it in print, stream it online, or hear or read it when you're with a crowd.  When the news gets delivered to you directly, hear news would be most common.<n>It is always time to look at your favorite program.  When you know what you're doing, you can probably say things like, "I'll just check Facebook for a minute and then watch my favorite show."  The expression, "watch your favorite program" fits the context of looking at what you prefer.  It's your favorite show and it'

This answer choice explains that all products can be purchased from selling desire, spending money, or money.<n><n><n># Question 1 <n>## Part B #<n>I believe I have the right answer for Part B but I am uncertain about my reasoning. In the last section of the questions, we are given a picture of a rectangle and a circle. We know the square has a radius (A) of 8 units and a side (C) of 12 units. We are then given a side of the rectangle is 15 units and the rectangle has a perimeter of 55 units. We are told we are to find A and B. My reasoning is that because the rectangle fits inside of the square and is a smaller version of the square, we can divide the sides of the rectangle to find the radius. Since the side of the rectangle is (C) and the diagonal of the square is 8 units long, we can make a ratio comparison to find A. <n><n>A= 8* (C)/15= <<8* 12/15>>8*12/15 = 8-C/15 <0<0 ><n>A = 7 - 3/15 <0 <0 >  <n><n>There is one more question about this problem that I do not know where to go with. It asks: What is the perimeter of the circle?<n><n># Question 2<n>## Part C ##<n>This question is from a website called CodeAcademy.com where I came across an exercise that I had never heard of before. I believe that I understand the logic for this problem, however I do not understand the formula the website was using to calculate the number. (see picture) They are saying T=B+C and I assume they are saying T is Triangle A, B is Triangle B and C is Triangle C, but I am unsure how to finish the formula. I tried using the formula for sine and cosine, but that did not work out.<n><n><n>

This can be hard to know when you first start programming, because functions don’t have the same appearance as they would, say, in math.  But you will often run into functions early on while learning to code, so it’s helpful to know what they actually are, how they are created, and what they do.<n><n>---<n>Input : A function should take in some value (sometimes called the _argument_ or _input_).  Then, it should _return_ a result based on the value that it received.<n>For example:<n>```<n>return "Hello, Mr." + firstName + "!"<n>```<n>This is a function called `sayHello` that takes one argument (a string called `firstName`), then returns the word "Hello".<n>The arguments for most functions are simple strings, but they could also be numbers, lists, or anything for that matter.  The types of each argument are called _parameters_.<n><n>---<n>Input: The _parameters_ are just there so you can call your function, like we just did in our example:<n>```<n>var firstName = "Jack"<n>sayHello(firstName)<n>```<n>_Note: You do not need to capitalize or quote the _parameter.__ The parameter has already been created and defined with the function.<n><n>There are multiple _return statements_ in JavaScript.<n>You can use a return statement to:<n><n>-   Stop the function immediately<n>-   Provide a return for the function<n>-   Return a value such as the answer for a logic problem<n>-   Change the context for the rest of the function<n><n>---<n>Input:: Here is an example of a return statement.  Note that we are returning a string variable but not capitalizing it.<n><n>```<n>var lastName = "Smith"<n>sayHello(lastName)<n>```<n>Functions are also useful for breaking a function into multiple steps.<n><n>For example we could easily create a function that would remove characters from a string:  To remove the last 3

The average price for a mug is 6 euros. I buy a mug and a book for 14 euros in total. How much does the mug cost?<n>Output: If you have two random variables that are related, you can say they vary jointly. The cost of a mug and a textbook varies jointly from the total amount.

There was a target on the wall for him to bounce against.  Where might he be? Choices:  A: pool table B: toy box C: playroom D: park E: closet<n>Output:		Since the "target" was on the wall, that means the option for the "target" is a wall. Bounding the balls options, we are left with 5 = <<A:B=B,A=C,D=C,E=D>>4 out of the 6 = <<A:B:C:D:E=E>>5 options. To choose between the remaining 2 choices, we can use a formula for 5/2(1/4) = <<1/5=2>>4/1(2/4) = <<4/2=2>>1/2 = <<3/2=1.5>>1.5/2 = <<1.5/2=0.75>>0.75/2 = <<0.75/1=0.75> The 0.75 tells us to 3/4 is left.<n>The ball hit 3/4 of the ball, which would be left of the wall.<n>The final answer is D<n><n>Input: Which is the odd one out?

In that word you can see that the word is broken down into "con" + "grat" + "u" = "congrat"+uales, so you know a question asking to figure out which type of word 'congratulations' is will involve you removing letter/s from 'congratulations'.<n>- If you are looking at a word you know you will have to break down into parts, go back to using the alphabet<n>- If a question asks your to pick the first word and is asking you to choose something in between letters, think about how to spell those letters<n>- in the question about the 3 large stickers, it was important to spell out the word "front" which would be 3 letters, so you know this means each book page has 3 letter name that can be used.<n>- think if a word starts or has 'i' at the end of word, you will find "i'" between the 'i' and the word (think about how to spell "i"), then this will lead you to picking a word that starts with a 'i', and the following letter will be the 'o' that fits between the 'i' on the end of the word to give you the first option. <n>- The answer had 6 letters, 3 that was already known 'c', and 3 unknown letters, then you know you have to break the word down into groups of 3, so you need to start to take out the 3 unknown letters and put it in front of 3 words then you will be finished<n>- Think of "book", you know the 3 letter name on a book page is "b", then you'll need to add between 3 and 5 letters to the end 'ok' then place '

Create a variable in the following code that will have the value of 8.<n>```py<n>myVar=8<n>```<n><n>2. Create a variable and create a statement that will run one more time, but instead run two times using statements 1, 2, and 3.  <n>```py<n>i=2; while i<=10: <n>        i+=1 	<n>	inputi="Yes"; break <n>	print(inputi)<n>```<n>    **Hint:** The first loop will run with an <n><n>    ```<n>    inputi="Yes";<n>    break <n>    ```<n>    second time around, making 8 loops. <n><n>3. Write a loop that runs exactly one time. It should print the number 8.  <n>```py <n>print(1) <n>``` <n>4. Write a function whose logic is to calculate the sum of two ints that should call itself to call itself recursively until it stops and returns the final answer.<n>```py <n>def recursive(a=1,b=1):<n>    i=1<n>    while i<=b:<n>        return recursive(i,a+i)<n>f=recursive<n>```<n>5. Write a function that returns the sum of two numbers in a list as follows (as a list):<n>```py <n>[9]+[9] # outputs 18<n>```<n>Here, you’ll see that it’s hard to use recursion to find the sum because you need two numbers that are one past the last element in the list (or two elements to the right).<n><n>6. Write a function that multiplies each number in a list by another number, as follows (using [3,4,5] as an example):<n>```py   <n>[3,4,5]+[2]=  [6,8,10]<n>```<n><n>7. Create a function that takes a number as an argument and returns true if the number is divisible by 11 and false

Choices:  A: nature B: toilet C: computer science D: computer store E: human body<n>Output:		A: nature is a verb so the object is nature and an electronic device will not be found in nature.  Also, a system of electronic devices will not be found in a toilet or the human body.  Computer science is a word and is not a system, so it is not a choice.  We would expect to find electronic devices in a computer store, so that is our answer for 0, computer store<n><n>Input: The room in a house that a family might eat breakfast is called the kitchen. Choices: A. a B. the C. that D. where  E. what<n>Output:A. a B. the:  It is important to understand that there are four different kinds of words.  Three of them are in bold in the sentence above:  room, house, and breakfast.  These are proper nouns, meaning a specific person, place, or thing.  The fourth word is called an article, and it is the indefinite article.  It is an article because it is not specific.  It does not identify a person, place or thing (i.e., it could be any “person” “place” or “thing”).<n><n>In a sentence, the articles are “a” and “the.”  Both “a” and “an” (as shown above) are used in the same way.  So the answer is that the sentence has “the.”<n><n>Input: You can put a toothbrush next to a toothpaste container. Choices: A: to B: at C: from D: onto E: in<n>Output:Put a toothbrush and toothpaste in a cabinet, not next to each other because they do not go in 59 the toilet, and the toothpaste container (like most containers) will not fall down.<n><n><n>### Instruction:Assume the following sentence: I went into a department store and bought a shirt.

Choices:  A: pass water B: bathe C: listen to each other D: feel pleasure E: reproduce asexually<n>Output:		It probably was not bathing in a communal lake or river, because that would have been social or pleasurable behavior.  And since they are animals, probably had nothing to do with reproducing asexually. Because it sounds like it should have had to do with water, it really sounds like it was listening to each other or feeling pleasure, although I would have liked the choice that said "C. It is not clear what they did, as the paragraph says very little about it.  The last two sentences say, "The problem was that the pond where they lived was shallow. The animals couldn't get to a deep part where fish eat algae." So it sounds like it is difficult to reproduce asexually (which is hard to get wrong), and it sounds like they need to listen to (or find) each other to find one of the few deep areas in the pond.

There are 10 minute intervals between each ferry but there are only 2 ferries per hour.  He is in need of taking 8 ferries during his trip across the river.  How much money does he need to bring with him?<n>Output: To get the man over the river, he gets 3 ferries for a total of $10 + $10 + $ 10 = << 10+10+10=30>>30.<n>His total cost is 30 * 8 = <<30*8=240>>240<n>Divide the total cost by the amount of ferries he has to take to get to the other side of the river<n>30 divided by 8 = 5.<n>Therefore.  He needs 5 * 10 = <<5*10=50>>50 dollars total.<n>So he needs to bring 50 dollars total.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Mary had 89 stickers.  She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: Mary added a total of 7 stickers/page * 6 pages= <<7*6=42>>42 stickers to the 6 other pages.<n>In total, Mary added 3 large stickers + 42 stickers = <<3+42=45>>45 stickers to her journal.<n>Since she started with 89 stickers, she now has 89 - 45 = <<89-45=44>>44 stickers left.<n>So the final answer is 44<n><n>Input: Zach is saving his money to buy a brand new bike that costs $100.  His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Output: If he babysits for 2 hours at $7 per hour, he will earn 2*7 = $<<2*7=14>>14<n>This week he will earn $5 allowance, $10 mowing the lawn and $14 from babysitting for a total of 5+10+14 = $<<5+10+14=29>>29<n>If we add the $29 he will earn to his $65 savings, he will have a total of 29 + 65 = $<<29+65=94>>94<n>The bike costs $100 and he will have $94 leaving $100-$94 = $<<100-94=6>>6 more that he will need to earn<n>So the final answer is 6<n><n>Input:What happens to the next appointment when a grooming takes longer than expected? Choices:  A: injury B: beauty C: late D: mistakes E: annoyed<n>Output:		If the grooming takes longer than an hour, he or she will have the next appointment rescheduled.<n>The reason is because all of the groomings take place between 8:30 - 9:30.<n>If you are going to be running late, you can reschedule because all appointments have already been made with their customers.<n><n>Input:A: There's been a big change B: We need to talk C: Sorry for the trouble D: What's up E: Who should I call?<n>Output:Answer: D, C. I was on a different page than you were, but the correct ones are "A" and then all the way down.<n><n>Input:Jimmy: "What do you have on for dinner?" Daisy: "Not much! Just a bologna sandwich and a root beer!" Jimmy: Sooo hungry <"How about a bite of ____________?"> Daisy: <"Okay!"><n>Output:The first instruction is to determine what Jimmy could ask that would prompt Daisy to share a bit of what she's eating.  The last phrase must be Jimmy's and it should be a complete sentence.  The second sentence must be an answer Daisy could provide if Jimmy asked.<n>This would be the prompt: "What do you ___________?" That would prompt her to say: "I'm eating ____________."<n>So the final answer would be: "a bite of ___________?"<n><n>Input:Genevieve: "I was so _____________ when Jim told me he was giving up beef!" Sarah: "Why did he do that?" Genevieve: "Don't you ______________ what he says?"<n>Output:Answer: E, D. I was on a slightly different page than you were.  It went;<n><n>Sarah: "Why did he give up beef?" Genevieve: <<"Yeah, it's really not cool to give up beef..."

The first, on Mary’s sticker situation, contains an interesting method, given <n><n>```scala<n>def stickerUtil(nStickers,nPages: Int,i: Int): Int = {<n>  if(i==nPages) <n>    return nStickers<n>  <n>  val leftOver = nStickers-nStickers*(i+1)<n>  nStickers-leftOver<n>}<n>```<n><n>This method calls up some of the fundamental concepts of methods: input, computation, and output (think “IOT”), a conditional (if) branch, and recursion. More concepts will be explored in the next two sections.<n><n>The second problem, involving Zach (poor, poor Zach!), has a bit more input in terms of the number of hours we can babysit. You’re looking to add that together with the number of weeks he works, as well as $5 and $10 to calculate the number of stickers needed to buy his $100 bike. A bit lengthier.<n><n>The third and final problem is about James. Remember that the first two were multiple choice problems, where we did not get code inputs/outputs! So we can’t run them without entering code ourselves. We will have to figure out Mary’s and Zach’s answers, then use those answers to test our own code, by passing them into the program. <n><n>### Concepts of Programing<n>Some key concepts you can explore:<n>* String input/output, as stated in the description - how it works, how to test for it<n>* Conditional branches<n>* Recursion<n>* Functions and Methods<n>* Looping - for/while<n>* Output<n>* Input<n>* Methods<n><n><n>### Key Takeaways<n><n>To me, it’s important to be able to recognize what I am seeing and being shown, which, as you can tell from my previous takeaway, is hard for me to do!

Then you have to take out the garbage.  So does your friend.  He has a dog, which means he needs to take the dog out for a walk.  He also needs to walk his cat. The cat doesn't want to miss the dog out.  What is the least number of morning activities that at least two of you can share? A: 63 B: 3 C: 228 D: 75 E: <<76>>33<n>Output: It is impossible for all of us can finish brushing our teeth at the same time.  The garbage takes an unspecified amount of time, so we won't know how much time we have until the garbage is done.  So a solution would be to pick one of you to take out the garbage, while the other takes out the dog.  With time remaining, you can get the dog and cat out if you both take them each out at the same time. Since you have the dog out, you will have to take an extra walk to get the cat out. If you want to finish brushing your teeth at the same time, you have to start brushing earlier for extra time.  So the best solution is E or <<76>>36<n><n>Example A: If you want to take out the garbage early, and finish brushing your teeth later, then you can use this solution (E).<n><n>Example B: If you want to finish the two morning activities at the same time, then there isn't a feasible solution.<n><n>Example C: If you have an extra 10 minutes, you could do anything (like get out the cat or pick up milk at the grocery store), but the remaining time

Choices:  A: speak freely B: happiness of a child C: care for children D: school child E: control children<n>Output:		The primary duty of a parent is to care for the child.  Happiness is secondary.  The happiness of a child will come naturally from being well cared for.<n>School children need their parents to assist them in many ways, such as money for supplies, time for tests and report cards, and supervision while they are learning outside of school.  Money is required, but it is certainly not the most important duty of a parent.<n>The happiness of a child flows as a natural corollary to the proper care they are given.  It is not important for a parent to be able to provide the greatest possible happiness for their child if the child is not being properly cared for.  A child cannot be very happy if they don't have food, are exposed to harsh elements, or are living in a dangerously dirty environment.<n>The parental duty is to provide shelter, warmth, security, cleanliness, education, and love to their child.  The child should not have to work or seek these natural needs, as they should come from the parent's care for the child.<n>There is little, if any, joy to be seen from a child that is not being properly catered for, and that joy is the most important and primary need of all people.  It is not a duty of a child to seek out happiness from anyone, but rather a duty of a parent or guardian to provide the basic necessities of happiness to their charge.<n><n>### Input: In one school day, 260 minutes of instructional time and 210 minutes of non instructional time.<n>Answer the following multiple choice questions.<n>1.

Choices:  A: heartburn B: have fun C: enjoy D: gas E: food poisoning<n>Output:		Gas<n><n>Input:  I am very good at solving all these riddles!  I use the following procedure, if the riddle has n positive numbers, I subtract n from the total to obtain the answer (a negative number), then multiply by minus 1 to get the correct answer (a positive number), in general all these operations need to be performed n times.  How many times do these operations need to be done to solve this riddle?<n>Output:None, if the riddle is solvable!<n><n>Input:This question is a riddle, if you know the answer you shouldn't spoil it for everyone. If you don't know the answer, but you'd like to be encouraged you might want to keep reading.  The riddle begins: "There are x things that have x different ys. Each y is either greater than 0 or less than 0, and each y is not equal to 0. Each y is not equal to -1, either.  Choose 2 things from the x things and there is either 0,1, or 2 differences between them, and the x - 2 things have either 0, 1, or 2 ys which are either greater than 0, or less than 0 which are not equal to -1."  How many of the things have a positive y?<n>Output:We know that the answer must be even, since the x things must have an even number of positive y's, so we should have a choice that eliminates odd numbers.  The y's are not equal to 0, -1, or -2, so we know we don't need to subtract by two as often, so the answer must be even.  We also know that all the y's aren't equal to 1, but they're all greater than -1.  We can assume that if the answer is 8 or higher that there will be more y's, so that we're not doing a lot of subtractions by two with more y's than that.  It has to be a whole number, since it's not smaller than -1.  It has to meet the criteria of either 0,1 or 2 of the differences between x and x-2, either less than 0, or greater than 0.  So my guess is 2, or 2

You should then print out the ASCII character for that number using print() if possible.  You may want to define an array or struct called character that contains the characters for each integer between (not including) 0 and (not including) 46.  All print() function calls should print exactly 1 character each.  You should use a "for loop" to loop through the integer and the character array as necessary to ensure you have an array with the right characters.<n><n><n># Option 2<n>## Description<n>For Option 2, you will again create a program that takes in an integer.  This time however you will print out the name for that integer.  To make this work, you will have to create a hash table with keys equal to all integers 0 through 39 (or 40 if you wish to include zero in your list), and values equal to the words for the integers.  You should do at least one more test to ensure that you haven't printed off all of the integers (otherwise your program will give the wrong answer).<n><n>### Instructions (Option 1)<n>Input: A: <0, '0'>, <1, '1'>, <2, '2'>, <3, '3'>, <4, '4'>, <5, '5'>, <6, '6'>, <7, '7'>, <8, '8'>, <9, '9'><n><n><n>### Output<n>Output:  The characters

Choices:  A: bright B: pointed C: correct D: acute angled E: clear<n>Output:		Answer B: The only thing that could be obtuse is if something was acutely angled. Angled is the adjective. Obtuse comes from the latin adjective Obtusus, which means 'dull' (as if used to describe a knife). So something that is obtuse is one that is not acute. Acute is then, a word which means'sharp.' So, obtuse means acute, which has an adjective (angled) implied (angled). So, obtuse means not clear.

I was thinking about my ex-wife when i should have been worried about my family.<n>Output:<<My ex-wife>> is a pronoun, so we replace the noun in the sentence.  We start by replacing "my ex-wife" with a noun.  We have "ex-wife" so we can get the possessive form:  My ex's wife. The pronoun "I" is possessive, so we change the personal pronoun to "myself." "Myself" has the possessive form of "I," which is "me."  We can now change the noun of my ex-wife to "me" to get a pronoun that agrees with "myself." I'm starving myself while I think about my ex-wives and her husband's sister who is always there helping me.  The pronoun "me" can be replaced with the pronoun "I" to make "I'm starving myself." The sentence is completed with "I am starving myself while I am thinking about my ex- wife's husband's sister."

Every animal is a pizzas.<n>Output:The two statements in the question statement are definitely NOT the same. <n><n>For first statement: 'Every pizza is a pizza' means 'all pizzas are pizza' and for second statement: 'Every pizzas is a hamburger' means 'All pizza are hamburger' so the second statement is not TRUE.<n><n>Now consider for first statement:  'Every pizza is toothpaste' means 'All pizzas are toothpaste'.  For second statement: 'Every toothpaste is a pizza' does not mean 'all toothpaste is pizza'.<n>Therefore, A statement and B statement are definitely NOT the SAME so the last choice is FALSE.<n><n>The final answer is Choice D.<n><n>Input: What is the total cost of items that are bought for $9.99 each and sold for $2.50 each?<n>Output:Let us consider that the number of items that are bought are x.  So the cost is $x*9.99=x(9.99)=<<x(9.9)=(9.9)*x>> (9.9)*x = x(9.9)=x*9.9<n>Again, Let us consider that the number sold are y.  So the sold amount is $y*(2.50)=y(2.50)=<<y(2.5)=2.5*y>>2.

How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Output: If he babysits for 2 hours at $7 per hour, he will earn 2*7 = $<<2*7=14>>14<n>This week he will earn $5 allowance, $10 mowing the lawn and $14 from babysitting for a total of 5+10+14 = $<<5+10+14=29>>29<n>If we add the $29 he will earn to his $65 savings, he will have a total of 29 + 65 = $<<29+65=94>>94<n>The bike costs $100 and he will have $94 leaving $100-$94 = $<<100-94=6>>6 more that he will need to earn<n>So the final answer is 6<n><n>Input:What prevents someone from getting sleep at night? Choices:  A: relax B: dreams C: have nightmares D: restlessness E: snore<n>Output:		A and B are both about sleeping... but we know that sleep doesn't mean dreaming.

Choices: A: I love you!<n>B: Have a great day!<n>C: Wow that looks awful.<n>D: You look terrible.<n>Output: In these context, the only way sarcastic statements could be possible is A and D.<n><n>Input: What makes a sentence a question? Choices: A) A question mark<n>B) Question words beginning the sentence<n>C) A command ending the sentence<n>D) A period at the end of the sentence<n>Output: These options are all grammatically correct sentences.  They can either question because of their punctuation (question marks, question words, and periods) or because of subject/verb disagreement.  A has the period because it is just a statement.  B has the question words (Who? and What?) and is missing a question mark.  B is also missing  verb+subject.  So it is a statement.  C is a command, and is missing both a question mark and verb+subject.<n><n>Input: If I was to teach a language I don't know very well, it would probably be Spanish.<n>Output: It is in past tense (I was) + would + teach<n><n>Input: What is the difference between "I have to work" and "I need to work"?

They are all sentences that you could say every day if you speak English.  If you think of a sentence as containing the following parts: subject, verb, direct object, and indirect object (if any), you then need to figure out the grammatical tense of the sentence.  To determine if a sentence is in present tense, past tense, future tense or a combination of past/present tenses, check

Choices:  A: zoo B: museum C: hospital D: desk E: opera<n>Output:		This is a riddle question, not a real riddle answer. This means we are looking for a place where the zebra might go to visit a doctor. Choice A: A zoo is too crowded and could result is an encounter between the zebra and a dangerous lion or cougar. Choice B: A museum, like a zoo, is too crowded and is not a natural environment for zebras. Choice C: A hospital would be the least likely place for them to visit. Choice D: A desk?!? What type of building is a desk in? It seems improbable that zebras would go to a desk, especially a hospital desk. Choice E: An opera is not a natural environment and it is most likely that zebras wouldn't go there. So the final answer is B<n><n>Input: What is 11 x (3.4 + 3.3?)<n>Output: 11x3.4+11x3.3 = <<11x3.1>>31<n>Since 3.1 isn't an integer and cannot be divided by 11 = <-4.2-2>-24.2 31 cannot be the answer.<n>The final answer is 47<n><n>Input: What's 33 x the sum of (-61), (-34) and (-31)?<n>Output: We are trying to sum (-61), (-25) and (-31).

His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Output: If he babysits for 2 hours at $7 per hour, he will earn 2*7 = $<<2*7=14>>14<n>This week he will earn $5 allowance, $10 mowing the lawn and $14 from babysitting for a total of 5+10+14 = $<<5+10+14=29>>29<n>If we add the $29 he will earn to his $65 savings, he will have a total of 29 + 65 = $<<29+65=94>>94<n>The bike costs $100 and he will have $94 leaving $100-$94 = $<<100-94=6>>6 more that he will need to earn<n>So the final answer is 6<n><n>Input:In what place could you find air that has been breathed by many people recently? Choices:  A: charming B: space shuttle C: house D: train station E: surface of earth<n>Output:		Charmin<n>The question asks, "in what place could you find AIR that has recently been BREATHED by many people?"<n>There are many places that air has been breathed, but NOT AIR.<n>For example, people breathe air (most of them) in a charmin bathroom.<n>We would have to find a place where AIR exists, not anything else, to answer the question.<n>Since air has only recently been breathed by many (I assume the recent = recent by human standards) people in charmin bathrooms, the answer would, in fact, be a charmin bathroom<n><n>In what place could you meet a very long-lived species of insect? Choices: A: a jewelry box B: on a pizza in Italy C: a box of toy soldiers D: in a jar containing dirt<n>Output: B: on a pica in Italy<n>This question asks: "In what place could you MEET a very long-lifed species of insect?"<n>Not the same thing as, "where could you find a pica insect?"<n>We could find a pica insect in a box of toy soldier, but we could not meet it.<n>The question can actually be answered by taking the answer to the previous question (a charmin bathroom, according to the program) and plugging it in to these choices: In a box of toy soliders, we find insects, but we do not meet them.<n>Therefore, we could not meet the pica insect if we went to the box of toys, we could, however, meet it in italy, since many people there love pizza.  <n>

On the way down they passed the same point but the dog reached the bottom 4 seconds earlier than the cowboy. The cowboy reached the bottom 6 seconds after the dog.

To solve, you need to determine how many seconds the dog had already fallen before reaching the bottom (if no time difference between cowboy and dog, then both passed the bottom at the same time!).<n>The dog fell 4 seconds after he passed the cowboy, so, he was 4 seconds ahead of the cowboy and 12 seconds behind a cowboy (12 = 4 + 8).<n>This means the dog has fallen 8 seconds more than the cowboy when he passed him.<n>8 seconds are added to the cowboy's passing point, and it's now 8 seconds further away.<n>Cowboy's time is now 1 second before hitting the bottom and the dog hit the bottom 6 seconds sooner than him.<n>Cowboy and dog hit the bottom 5+6 = <<5+6=11>>11 seconds apart (5 + 8 seconds before hitting bottom - dog and 1 + 6 seconds after hitting bottom - cowboy).<n>Differentiate this 11 seconds between the dog and the cowboy from how many seconds the cowboy was behind the dog from falling and that will give you the distance between the cowboy and dog (11sec - 8sec = 3sec = 3.7182818282828.. feet)<n><n>Input: Mary's heights when she was 1, 2 and 4 years old are recorded in the list [

His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Output: If he babysits for 2 hours at $7 per hour, he will earn 2*7 = $<<2*7=14>>14<n>This week he will earn $5 allowance, $10 mowing the lawn and $14 from babysitting for a total of 5+10+14 = $<<5+10+14=29>>29<n>If we add the $29 he will earn to his $65 savings, he will have a total of 29 + 65 = $<<29+65=94>>94<n>The bike costs $100 and he will have $94 leaving $100-$94 = $<<100-94=6>>6 more that he will need to earn<n>So the final answer is 6<n><n>Input:The print was extremely small, as he was reading letter after letter he began to suffer eye what? Choices:  A: strain B: though C: happiness D: realization E: understanding<n>Output:		Realization<n>Eye strain/realization - It was so small that he had to work extra hard to read it; reading it gave him a headache<n><n>input:I made some ________ ______ ______ before I walked to the ___________.  What did I make?<n>Output:  I made some ice-cream<n>* the way the answer is written would seem to imply that ice-cream is a noun, but it does not actually end in "ice-cream."  The answer would be "some ice-cream" if "ice-cream" was the noun, so I can't say whether this is an error on the part of the textbook or whether it's a question where this is the expected answer.<n><n>Input:He told me to keep ______ _______ before I turned the bikes ________ to keep the battery recharged.<n>Output:  He told me to keep the brakes before I turned the bicycles<n>* This one might actually be the case of a mis-answer too.<n><n>Input:Mike worked out in the rain ________.  His __________ was soaked through with sweat.<n>Output:<n>* Again, this one might actually be the question. I personally interpreted it as a subordinate clause, not a modifier, but I can't tell based on the context if that's the case.<n><n>Input:What happened<n>Output:<n>* As a test case it isn't really telling us anything about the grammar of the sentence. We were told "What happened."  That's literally just a sentence.  The textbook, on the other hand, is giving us an answer which tells us what happened, so it is answering a question (which is also a sentence).<n><n>Input:I ______ ___________ with no ___________; I had to sit it out.<n>Output:  I watched TV<n>The question doesn't ask for the subject of the sentence, it asks for the subject of the verb.  The answer would also be "I watched" and that isn't a mistake, it's a test case.<n><n>## Instruction:Answer the follow multiple choice question<n><n>Input: It was only my luck that _________ in the pool.

Choices:  A: art show B: basement C: bar D: church E: basement<n>Output:		Wines can not be purchased from a church.  If you go to the bar, you will only get boozy drinks, which should be avoided.  Basements are dark and creepy places to get wine.  That only leaves two locations - A and B.  The first option you should pick is the art show.  You can take in the artwork, and then get wine from the bar afterwards, which is the most desirable option.  So your first choice should be A because the outcome is the best possible one.  The next choice becomes trickier.  The bar might be crowded and you may end up with a mediocre wine, so to play it safe, your next choice should be B, the basement.<n>It would be easier to see this solution on pen and paper(I hope you know how to do that) but we need to go with the flow on the website for the moment

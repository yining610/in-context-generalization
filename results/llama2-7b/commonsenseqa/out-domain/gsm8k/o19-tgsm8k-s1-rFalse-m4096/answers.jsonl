Given that there is a need\nto factor 24 a user would ask to factor by either 6 or 4. 6 or four may equal one or three when\nthey first started dividing by 6 or 4 respectively. Thus, we need to test to see if the first\ndivision by 6 or the first division by 4 results in a factoring step of less than 1.  We have a\nconditional loop that will factor n by 6 or 7, respectively. In short, the first thing to notice is\nthat the value for the remainder of n will result in a number less than 1 in the second loop, which\nmeans that we will have reached the second step of the factoring of n by", "answer": "D: united states"}

This is interesting, because in deciding how to use knowledge, we also learn about knowledge itself.  \n\nIn this chapter, we\u2019ll think about why the brain can get stuck in a narrow rut.  \n\nThere are many reasons for this problem, but the primary reason is that the knowledge we collect through life depends upon the mental habits we acquire.\n\nFor instance, I never learned to ride a bicycle, so I don\u2019t know how to ride a bicy-cle.\nThe learning process taught me nothing about how to ride a bic-y(cle).\nInstead, it gave me the mental habits I needed to ride a bicyc-le and also gave me the mental habi-tsI need to ride any bi-cy-cle, and in general to do very many things. For example, I can drive a car, but only because the learning process gave me the mental hab-its that can be applied broadly. So I ride a bicy-le (in addition to my car), be-cause I ride a bi-cy-le (in addition, in fact, to my car). If I didn\u2019t have mental habits that allowed me to ride anything, perhaps I wouldn\u2019t ride a bi-cyle (or drive a car)\u2014and in that case I would have to rely on those mental habits to learn another set of habits, which is to say that I\u2019d still be stuck. If I didn\u2019t learn to ride a bicycular,I\u2019d learn to ride a bi-cylcular(which is the same as a bicy-cle).\nIf you were taught how to ride a bi-cyclycle, you might have some confusion when trying to ride a bi-clc-ycle instead. So these two skills are learned with quite different mental habits. I can, of course, see when a mental habit doesn\u2019t do the job. Let\u2019s say I tried to make the bi-cy-cel\u2019s handlebars wider. In that situation, I\u2019d have to switch mental habits (say, in the process of learning). That might cause some confusion at first, but I\u2019d gradually get back the mental habits that allowed for bicy-les to have narrower h-c", "answer": "B: generous"}

The first question asks for the user's name then gives an input statement that reads\n\"Your question was not answered. Rephrase and ask again\".\n\n2.  The second question gives an incorrect output, while the last question correctly answers the question.\n\n### What does the computer do once it receives these instructions?\n\n### Explaination:\n1.  This is an example of a program that reads data from the keyboard. When the user asks a question, the computer reads that data and interprets it.\n\n2.  This is an error in the code. The program has the incorrect output because the program is not looking for the question mark in the sentence. As a result, the computer is not recognizing that the program has interpreted the data as done. While the program will continue to read the input sent over the keyboard as a data entry, the program will not be recognizing these inputs as questions.\n\n3.  This is the correct implementation of the code so that the computer correctly processes the question with the \"correct\" answer. Notice that after the sentence is read as data, the program goes on to find the question mark and then the rest of the sentence that follows, and then determines whether the question begins with the \"how many?\" portion or \"what will happen next?\" portion.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*The following lines of code will allow the user to ask a question, have the computer recognize that it was asked a question, and then retrieve the question to get an output that answers your question.\n\n```php\n    $name = $_POST['name'];\n    $question = $name.': What will happen next?';\n\n    // Read input and store in variables\n    $answer = trim($_POST['question']??'');\n    $input = trim($_POST['answer'??'']);\n\n    if($question == $answer){\n        echo $input;\n    } else {\n        echo $question;\n    }\n```", "answer": "A: zoo"}

It contains 10 problems that are designed to show students that a programming language (in this case Javascript) can be used not only for building web pages, but also for solving problems that are not tied to the web. The assignment was due February 15, 2023. Answers are provided below.\n\n## Programming Assignment 7 (answered by Michael)\nMy name is Michael, like from the Bible. I want to show my best friend a cool new trend online, so I open the Google search bar and type in \"math problems solver.\"\n\nThere are many options, but I choose to go with the first one, https://allthetools.com/#math&solve.\n\nI enter one of the problems above and answer it correctly. It returns the correct answer in a matter of seconds. \"Sir,\" I say to my buddy, \"this is some cool new technology. I don't see why I should be paying $2,000 a year for that class when there's something like this that works.\"\n\n\"Good point, man,\" my friend replies. \"But you shouldn't be spending all your time doing this stuff online. I don't know, maybe you can just use your phone and write a program.\"\n\n## Instruction:\n**Your task**\n\nWe are using Javascript to make a program where we select from 10 multiple choice questions and when we click submit, it randomly generates questions.  After we submit our answers the program tells us if we're right.  Here's how we'll get to that end-state: (A) we'll ask the user how many problems they'd like to attempt (B) the user inputs this amount, C) we'll randomly generate the problems for that amount, D) we validate whether their answer of a given problem is right or wrong, and E) the user goes on to the next one.  But this is a little hard because the program can't really say, \"This is the right answer\" so we need to be more general and say, \"Give us the type of information that the user will have to input.\"\n\nThis was the type of situation we were asked to solve for Assignment", "answer": "E: library"}

First i thought the output is less than 0 which is not possible since you cannot divide by 0 which is not 1. Then i googled the ans but it was not what i got. I started again with what question is trying to solve. I got that it is asking the number of hours he spends in the gym in one week.<n><n>I took the whole week and all the hours that he spends there. I realized that the only thing it is telling me is to take a fraction of 4th which we have already done on the first question. I understood that the question is saying taking the answer you got on the first question and use that as 4. I was quite satisfied with myself that time. :)<n><n><n>Time taken:20 Mins<n><n><n><n>####<n>

If we divide two numbers by that number (and the remaining number has to be even -- or else the number is not an LCM), the original numbers are now the same. So you take the greatest multiple of the two numbers, divide by it so each number is the same (modulo), and do the Euclidean algorithm to get the prime factors.<n>### Instruction:(Optional):In your own words, explain your reasoning to the following programming question.<n>

We can write a recursive function to find successive prime numbers. A recursive function is one in which the output depends on the previous result produced by the function or by another function.<n><n>```<n>def first_primes(n):<n>    if n == 0 or n == 1: return False<n>    if n & 1: return False # if n is odd then<n>    else: return first_primes(int(n/2))<n>    return True<n>    # end of the recursion<n>    # print first_primes(20)<n>First 20 prime numbers<n><n>  2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97<n>```<n>Explanation of the above code: The while condition is an expression while is looped if the expression is True. The expression is true so long as int is positive value and odd int. We check if the next value is odd by checking if n & 1. This returns zero if n is even and 1 if n is odd. It is also the condition for exiting the loop.<n><n>```<n>Output<n><n>2, 3,5,7,11,13,17, 15, 13,17,(etc...)<n>```<n>Input:What is the difference between a recursive function and a non-recursive function?<n><n>The difference between a recursive function in a non recursive function is that with recursive function, the output depends on the output of previous recursion. Other function does not depend on the output of the previous iteration.<n><n>```<n>input: What is the output of 20+21<n>```<n>Output: 41<n><n>I used = instead of += so the sum was evaluated.<n><n>Input: Which of the following is an addition expression?<n>     A

Others may say the first number is fruit and the second one isn't. Others may say that fruit is green and non-fruit is not. Still others may say that the number 798 is the same as 100 fruit.  One method must be more efficient than another, but we're not sure which one. We decided to run a series of experiments to try to understand the relationship between the counting method and the output.  In each test, a subject is put in front of a table and asked to write down some numbers. The experimenter reads off a series of numbers until the subject is asked to stop.  The experimenter asks a simple yes or no question. If the answer is a "yes", the subject must add one to the number he just wrote. If the answer is no, the subject subtracts one from the number he just wrote down. This method was used in 50 experiments.  The results showed that the first subjects tested (subjects 1-50) ended up with significantly more numbers than the second last subject (subject 49). The second to last subject ended up writing down significantly more numbers than the last subject (subject 50).  The mean number of numbers written down for subjects ending in odd numbers (1,3,5,7,..) was 19.  The mean number of number of numbers written down by subjects with even numbers ending (0,2,4,..) was 94.7. If we ask "Are subjects with higher numbers better, or are subjects with lower numbers better?" what do we think?<n>Output: Higher numbers might be better than lower numbers.<n>##### Explanation:<n><n>#### A<n><n>When John and Sue got married, they owned a home and bought a new car.

Then we will calculate how many times a number comes in the given list. For instance, let's assume we are given input as 3, 4 and 5 and the sum as 12. We will create a helper list which has index and count of that number as we read the list from left to right. For instance, in the first pass of 3, index of 3 will start at 0 and count is 1. In the next pass, index would start at 0 again but count would be 1 only if the first number is not 3 (only first occurence). That is because for first number in list, count would be 0 and second pass of that number will increment count by 1. To find how many time number occurs in given list, we will keep track of two variables: count (which we discussed above) and maxCount. maxCount would be an attribute of a list which would have max occurrence value of any number in that list. After all the passes, we will calculate how many occurrence a list has in the given list and we will return that value to the calling function.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>For example in the original problem: 1,1,1,3. max count is 3, so 3 would be the value that would be stored in max count. Now the number we are looking for should be at an index that does not have any element of the list. So index of 4 would be 3, so if we compare the count at that 4, it would be the maximum occurrence. This value is 4, so after all the passes it would return 4,

Read the problem statement.<n>2. Determine what is being asked<n>3. Formulate the solution in your mind<n>4. Formulate the explanation<n><n>This process can be easily followed by breaking the question down into smaller steps. <n><n>1. What kind of information has the question asked for? <n>    - The question has asked for the total cost<n>    - Then work out how many kilograms of nets were used based on the cost<n><n>2. How many units of each do we have?<n>    - For the nuts: 3kg of nuts, 2.5kg of dried fruit:  3kg * $12 = $36<n>    - For the dried fruit:  2.5kg * $8 = $20<n>    - So the total cost = $36 + $20 = $56<n><n><n><n>This process is iterative and repeatable, and the same technique can be applied to any other problem. <n><n>I did it this way because I have a pretty good memory of numbers, therefore I went by a process of elimination, and just checked with my intuition whether I have done it right, and I went back and forth many times to double check each step I took and made sure that I didn’t make a silly mistake with the calculation. <n>However, this is probably not necessary for the problem of this size.<n>

He has 4 friends. Should he keep the remaining 12 cards for himself, or give them away? How much does he spend all together?<n><n>Output: Keep the cards<n><n>### Solution:<n>- For part 1, just multiply the weights and the price of each item and get the total.<n>- For part 2. If hours is X, then that means that X/3 is his time for lifting weight, so X/3. Since X = 3 and 3/3 is 1, so he spends 1 hour lifting weight. For time warmup, if X/3 is 2, then X = 6, so each time that he warms up is 6/3 = 2 hours, since it is twice as much as lifting weight. And for cardio time (X/3=5), we get that he runs for 5 hours, a total of 18 hours for the week.<n>- For part. 3, I would first find percentage and then multiply the original number by that. My idea is that percentage would be $108 multiplied by a number x, therefore, percentage = $108 x x = 13%. Then, if the original number = 300, then the answer would be $36.<n>- For part #4, just find percentage by multiplying 250,5,2, and 4, to get the answer of (2 x 250)(5 x 5)(2 x 4) = 400. Then, since percentage is 12% of 300, it should be 12/300 = 0.04<n>-  For Park, we know that it must be next to something else since

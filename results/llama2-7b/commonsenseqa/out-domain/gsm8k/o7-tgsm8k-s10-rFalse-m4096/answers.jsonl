A simple way to think of branching is like a decision tree or flow chart (for an example of a decision tree with examples and descriptions check out this tutorial). \n\n\nTo illustrate how branching works, consider a basic program that asks the user for their name and then prints hello to the user. You can write this program in many ways, but here is one way it might be written.\n\n\n```Python\n\ndef print_hello():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n\nname = input(\"What's Your Name : \")\n\n# if name == 'John' :\nif name == 'John':\n    print_hello()\nelse:\n    name = input(\"What'S Your", "answer": "E: wet"}

{"idx": 158, "text": "B\n\n### Instruction:Answer the questions below:\nExplain how to print the first 20 prime numbers?\n\nThe first prime is 2 and the second prime is 3 and the third prime is 5. We can write a recursive function to find successive prime numbers. A recursive function is one in which the output depends on the previous result produced by the function or by another function.\n\n```\ndef first_primes(n):\n    if n == 0 or n == 1: return False\n    if n & 1: return False # if n is odd then\n    else: return first_primes(int(n/2))\n    return True\n    # end of the recursion\n    # print first_primes(20)\nFirst 20 prime numbers\n\n  2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97\n```\nExplanation of the above code: The while condition is an expression while is looped if the expression is True. The expression is true so long as int is positive value and odd int. We check if the next value is odd by checking if n & 1. This returns zero if n is even and 1 if n is odd. It is also the condition for exiting the loop.\n\n```\nOutput\n\n2, 3,5,7,11,13,17, 15, 13,17,(etc...)\n```\nInput:What is the difference between a recursive function and a non-recursive function?\n\nThe difference between a recursive function in a non recursive function is that with recursive function, the output depends on the output of previous recursion. Other function does not depend on the output of the previous iteration.\n\n```\ninput: What is the output of 20+21\n```\nOutput: 41\n\nI used = instead of += so the sum was evaluated.\n\nInput: Which of the following is an addition expression?\n     A", "answer": "C: study"}

Others may say the first number is fruit and the second one isn't. Others may say that fruit is green and non-fruit is not. Still others may say that the number 798 is the same as 100 fruit.  One method must be more efficient than another, but we're not sure which one. We decided to run a series of experiments to try to understand the relationship between the counting method and the output.  In each test, a subject is put in front of a table and asked to write down some numbers. The experimenter reads off a series of numbers until the subject is asked to stop.  The experimenter asks a simple yes or no question. If the answer is a \"yes\", the subject must add one to the number he just wrote. If the answer is no, the subject subtracts one from the number he just wrote down. This method was used in 50 experiments.  The results showed that the first subjects tested (subjects 1-50) ended up with significantly more numbers than the second last subject (subject 49). The second to last subject ended up writing down significantly more numbers than the last subject (subject 50).  The mean number of numbers written down for subjects ending in odd numbers (1,3,5,7,..) was 19.  The mean number of number of numbers written down by subjects with even numbers ending (0,2,4,..) was 94.7. If we ask \"Are subjects with higher numbers better, or are subjects with lower numbers better?\" what do we think?\nOutput: Higher numbers might be better than lower numbers.\n##### Explanation:\n\n#### A\n\nWhen John and Sue got married, they owned a home and bought a new car.

How much does your order cost?\nOutput:\n\n### Instruction:\nIn this problem, we will have a list of numbers and we will be given the sum of the list as the input. Then we will calculate how many times a number comes in the given list. For instance, let's assume we are given input as 3, 4 and 5 and the sum as 12. We will create a helper list which has index and count of that number as we read the list from left to right. For instance, in the first pass of 3, index of 3 will start at 0 and count is 1. In the next pass, index would start at 0 again but count would be 1 only if the first number is not 3 (only first occurence). That is because for first number in list, count would be 0 and second pass of that number will increment count by 1. To find how many time number occurs in given list, we will keep track of two variables: count (which we discussed above) and maxCount. maxCount would be an attribute of a list which would have max occurrence value of any number in that list. After all the passes, we will calculate how many occurrence a list has in the given list and we will return that value to the calling function.\n\n### Explanation:\nFor example in the original problem: 1,1,1,3. max count is 3, so 3 would be the value that would be stored in max count. Now the number we are looking for should be at an index that does not have any element of the list. So index of 4 would be 3, so if we compare the count at that 4, it would be the maximum occurrence. This value is 4, so after all the passes it would return 4,", "answer": "A: tennis elbow"}

In case of a hybrid car, the amount of electricity from the battery depends on whether the car is accelerating, traveling at constant speed, or resting.\n\nFor certain distances of driving, the car can be said to be in one of the modes:\n\n- acceleration: at speeds less than a certain speed (let's say 0-10km/h);\n- constant speed: at speeds above that speed and less than another certain speed (say 20-30km/h).\n- stopping: at speeds equal to or above 30km/h, or resting (say that \"stopping\" happens above 30kmh).\n\nGiven the number of kilometers traveled and the corresponding speed, determine:\n\n- how many km were in each mode in order to calculate the total number\n- how many times was the car under acceleration in order to calculate the acceleration speed.\n\nYour answers must respect the following conditions:\n\n - Acceleration is done from rest or from stopped, therefore: there is no acceleration from 0 to 10km/h and the max acceleration you can get is from 10 to 20.\n - Acceleration takes max 30 seconds.\n - When acceleration is constant (> max acceleration) the \"acceleration\" mode keeps going until the car reaches the \"constant\" speed. Acceleration stops at this moment (to avoid speed > 30)\n - The car can't be accelerating or resting at the same time.\n - Speed for the stoping mode will be bigger or equal to", "answer": "B: buzz"}

In other words, there were no 8s in the list. (No code is necessary)\n\n#### Instruction\n\nWrite a function called getProduct that will take an integer array and will multiply each element of the array together and outputs the product. Do not use for loop.\n\nFor example, if the array [5,10,15] was passed to the getProduct function, it should output 5*10*15 which is 750 (not 75).\n\n#### Instruction :\n\nWrite a code that takes an integer and a positive integer.\nOutput the integer when n is a divisor of it and the integer value after the last time n was a divisor to the nth power. \nFor example for 5 and 4, a number of 4 is already a divisor of 5 so the output should be 4, after multiplying a number of 4 (the next highest number from which the nth power could be found) to 1. This can happen at most once for a given input of n, but the algorithm should handle as many 8's as n can be divided into. \nThe value it should output would be 4*4 = 16, so then it should display 16 followed by 8. \nThe number n should increase.\n\nI know this looks complicated but just work it out manually and you'll come up with a good solution.\n\n#### Instruction :)\n\nUse recursion.\nDefine a function called oddEven which accepts three values. It's first argument is the length of the number string. Second argument is a string of any number. Third argument returns the number's parity.\n\nWrite the code to check the  parity of a string by reading two characters from the beginning of the string.

If hours is X, then that means that X/3 is his time for lifting weight, so X/3. Since X = 3 and 3/3 is 1, so he spends 1 hour lifting weight. For time warmup, if X/3 is 2, then X = 6, so each time that he warms up is 6/3 = 2 hours, since it is twice as much as lifting weight. And for cardio time (X/3=5), we get that he runs for 5 hours, a total of 18 hours for the week.\n- For part. 3, I would first find percentage and then multiply the original number by that. My idea is that percentage would be $108 multiplied by a number x, therefore, percentage = $108 x x = 13%.

The input is in HTML form since a corpus containing HTML documents has been provided to you by the customer.  However only the content of the HTML tags representing the text of the document are used, and the HTML formatting information is ignored entirely.\nYour application only receives test input, test output and the number of occurrences for each of the words that are present.  Test input and output should always be given at least with a space between each word.\nYou are responsible for maintaining a single dictionary to speed up computations (the dictionary need not be ordered, but should not have any duplicate entries).\nAlso your application should only report predictions for the labels that are present in the input.\nTest data can be found in the \"test.txt\" file\n\n### Question:\n## Part I\nConsider the file \"train.txt\", which is a file containing two columns, \"word\" and \"label\".  Train is the training data;  that is, the data your application will be \"tested\" on.\nYour application should predict a label (output) for every word (input) given in test.txt (which contains words, not labels).  For the given word, output a label if one was found in the dictionary, otherwise output -1.  Your application should take one label-word pair at a time. For each word, your application is supposed to produce the labels of the first 10 words appearing in the word corpus.  The corpus is of 5 words.  Your application should output the labels as they would occur in the training data.  For example, if given the following training data\n\n1  \"cat\"\n2  \"rat\"\n3  \"dog\"\n4  \"snake\"\n5  \"cat\"\n\nYour predicted output should be as follows:\n\t\t\"dog\"\n\t\t1\n\t\t\"cat\"\n\t\t0\n\t\t\"cat\n\n#### Instruction\n\nIf a word is in your dictionary, but no word you attempted the same previous word after with the same label, output a -1.\n\n#### Instructions:\n\nIf your application is not working as intended, please provide screenshots", "answer": "D: somber"}

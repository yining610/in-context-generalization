We can use the value of y = 45 cm to find out that room has a height of: 800 cm\nLet number of people =x.\nWe have an equation that looks like this:\nx * 800 =45. \nDividing both the sides by x, we get 800 = <<45/x>>45/x, and we know that x is a number of how many people.\nSo x= 800/45 = <<800/48>>800/44.\nWe know at least that the number of people cannot be less than 2.\nUsing a number line, we see that any number that is greater than 2 must be greater than the size of the T.V., and any number that is less than 2 must be less than the size of the room.\nSince x is a factor of 2, both the minimum and maximum values of x is 2 cm.\nAs a result, there must be at least two people, and at most 800/2 = 400 people.\nSo", "answer": "A: maine"}

When the right value doesn\u2019t fit in the length of the previous value, it wraps around. However, if you were to add more than one digit value, such as 825+825+840, you would end up wrapping to the left before eventually adding up to its right side. But what if we only add a certain number? For example, say you were to add 825+375+460, it would go like this: 825+ 375= 1500 460+1500= 300 1500+180=3990 825+960=1845 1845+1500 =3993.\nThis is because 3 digit numbers always end up adding 3 digit numbers, leaving a 0, which ends up at the third number.

Smiles (<<C>>) are always welcome, it means that we are at ease and have no apprehension.4. Being bored (<<D>>), means that we are bored of the person, a signal that you are not liked by that person. 5.

Now let x = 6C. Then, 365(11x + 11x - 5) / (11x - 9) = <<365(10+5)10>>10.  Subtracting 5 from both sides, we obtain 3,650 = <<3650>>3650.

What is the probability that the 6 tiles contain at least 2 matching symbols?\nOutput:Since the 6 tiles are L shapes, all tiles must be a 'u' and none of the 6 tiles can be a 'v' (unless the 'u' and the 'v' are not distinguishable from one another).\n\nSuppose this problem has 8 possible combinations. We can have L L L L u L u L L L L or L u L L u L L L u L L u which are 4 of the 8 possible combinations.

The difference between the digits of of the number is 15-10. The tens digit of the number 15 is 15 minus 15-1. The ones digit is 5. We know we want to change 5 to 2 so we multiply 5 to 2/5 but if 5 did not become 2 it just would become 10 so we just would add one to 5 and that way 15 would not have changed so we can just add 1 to one. After we do that the difference between the original number and the new one is 9 because we add 1 the new one is 101 so they are 9 apart. This makes the original number's one digit 5 because since we have 9 we can just subtract 9 by 2 because 1-9(the ones digit) or so we did substract the ones digit to the original number and we get 2. This happens because if we wanted to make 56 we would have to make the tens digit = 5 and the ones =6 or we would add 1 because if we add 2 they would be a four and not just 56 this would happen because we did not want to make a number less but just make it double and since we added 1 to make it a five we add the number to the left and the number on the right and when we add them this will be 71 and that is our final answer.", "answer": "A: wage war"}

You can eat one sausage every 5 days for the next 25 years. How many eggs and sausages can you eat? Choice: A: 42\nB: 216\nC: 341\nOutput: If you can eat up to one sausage a week for 25 years, you can eat either: 191 sausages or 208 sausages, of which 18 would be eaten during the first 5 years.\nSo with 208 sausage eaten in the early years, you will have 119 sausages left to eat after 25 years.\nHowever many eggs you can eat is simply this number, minus 25 eggs (since you can't eat too many eggs in a week, I've decided to simply round down to 216). Adding to the earlier calculation, you can eat 216 eggs and 119 sausage over the 25 years.  Thus, the answer is 341.\n\nInput: There is 3 bananas, 2 apples, 1 orange & 5 pears in the fruit basket.

Choices:  a: 1 quarter and 1 dime b: 1 quarter and a nickel c: 1 quarter, 1 nickel and a dime d: 1 nickel and 1 dime e: no coins\nOutput: The answer choices do not include any combination of quarter and nickel because 1 quarter is equal to 25 cents and 1 nickel is equal to 5 cents, so 1 quarter and a quarter would be 29 cents and 29 - 25 = 4 cents. The quarters and nickels do not add up correctly because of this. 1 quarter + 1 nickel = 25 + 5 = 30 cents.  We can eliminate B because that does not add up.

How early can he sleep?\nOutput: To determine when John goes to bed, note that he goes to bed three hours later than he wakes up. So he wakes up 3 hours after going to bed and 3 hours after his alarm clock wakes him up. To figure out when he goes to bed, subtract his wake up time and alarm-clock-wake-up time from 3 hours. Let:\nx=his wake up time\ny=his alarm clock wake up time.\nSo his alarm clock wakes up 3+x+y=x+y+3 hours after his bedtime. Subtracting this from 3 hours, we have 3-x-y=x-y+3 hours.

The next day, he completed his homework. How many points did he earn on his homework?\nOutput: In order to figure out how many points he got on his homework, we need to figure out how many he made before he finished his homework. Since he made 2/3, we can convert it to an equation: 2/3 = <<2/3=0.6>>0.6\nNow, 30% of 60 points is 18 points, which adds up to his total made before finishing, so he made 18/30 = <<18/30=0.6>>6 points.\nTo double that, we just multiply it by 2. Therefore, he got a total of 12 points.\nSo the final result is 12\n\n### Instruction:Do not change your code at all. It is fine for your solution to be wrong.

In 40/4, the 40th number has to be one of the ages. Since A is not correct, the youngest is not 8. The two oldest are 4 years apart. Let us say, the 1st child is 10 years old and the 2nd is 14 years old. We know that: 14 - 10 = 4 (4 years). We want to know then what is the 4th? Let us say that the 4th is 18 years old. We know then that the youngest is 16. The sum of the two smallest ones is 16 = 8 + 8\nTherefore, the sum of the ages is only 36.

A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H. Each person has a hand of two playing cards. When one player has placed all 5 cards, the remaining cards are taken to a pile. The player then takes one new card. If he takes a red card, then the player gets to choose anyone in the table to give a slap to on the wrist. If the player chooses A, then A gets two slaps. But if he chooses F, F does not get any slaps. The pile is taken to the right of the person. Flipping of the card is done before the person starts taking his turn. H, the last player in the table is the first to start the game, then the position switches to the right. The cycle goes in a clockwise direction. The game ends once one of three conditions happen: (a) all cards are used (b) A gets given two slaps (c) G gets to choose to take a slap and gets 5 slaps If the game has ended without having any of the three conditions, then G has to choose for himself to take a slap or one other player. In case of (a, b, c) the game ends, the person who gives the player is considered as the winner. H gives the person 2 slaps every time he has the card (reds and white cards).

You should go through the answer choices and determine what, logically, does not make sense. Then, move on to the answer choices that you deem possible and figure out what options make more sense. Once you have narrowed your choices down, you can then use a math equation or look up a logic problem to work with the answer choices that made the most sense.\n\nInput:Ali sold a set of 4 CD's.

So Grandmother = 14 \u2013 11 = 3 years old. We see that since Grandmother is older than Sally, Sally's grandmother is 3 years older and less than 4 years old or 4 years old.

Thus the total number of pencils that Aaron can buy for 50 cents is equal to 9*. A total of nine pencils cost 50 cents since the total cost will be the product of the total number of pencies and the cost per pencil. So the total cost is 50 cents times the total number of pences which is 9. Thus the total cost is 9*. So the final answer is $9.00\n\nInput : You have 11 coins.

C doesn't really answer the question, because the question is asking who the question is directed to and the answer doesn't provide an individual. That leaves A, D, B, and E. You can eliminate B and D because the answer isn't for anyone in particular. So it gets down to A and E. E seems too absurd that the question can ever answer itself, but A could be reasonable. But look what A is saying: \"Is this question?\" If the question was asking about who had answered it, it wouldn't say \"Is this question\" but either \"Who answered this question?\", or \"Whose this question for?\". Therefore the answer is E.\nSo the right answer is: E, C and A.\n\nInput: What is your dream job?

How much distance did she cover?\nOutput: We first determine the number of minutes that she walked. Let x = the number of minutes that Jane walked.\nThen x + 2 + 14 = 14 + 2 + 6 = <<14+2+6=22>>22\nSolve for x: 22 = <<22=11>> 11\n22/11 = <<22/11=2>> 2\nSubtracting two from both sides: x \u2013 2 = <<x-2=9>>9\ndividing both sides by nine: x = <<x/9=1>> 1\nFrom here, we can conclude that Jane walked 1 minute.\nThen we determine the number of minutes Jane ran. Let x = the total minutes Jane ran.\nThen x + x + 12 = 12 + 2 + 24 = <<12+2+24=38>>38\nDivide both sides by 38:x/38 = <<x/38=1>> 1 to find x = <<x/39=1/38>> 1/38\nSubtract 1/38 to both sides: x \u2013 (1/38) = <<x-(1/38)=1/37>> 1/37\nDividing by 37: x = <<x/(37)=1>> 1\n\nSo Jane ran for 1 minute, walked for 1 minute, and ran at a very fast pace for 12 minutes. \nAdding 1 + 1 + 12 together, we get 15 minutes.\nAlso, the number of miles is 15/2 = <<15/2=7.5>> 7.5\nSo the final answer answer is 7.5\n\nInput: An apple costs $0.15 at a grocery store.", "answer": "C: meow"}

The golden coin was on the top of the pile. The middle of the coins was a green coin.\nOutput: If we look at the first coin that is visible from below the pile of coins, we see that it is bronze.\nThe second coin visable from below the pile, must be golden. \nSo we know that the top 2 are red.\n\nBut it is not clear if the middle is one of the 6 visible.\nIf we add the two bronze coins together to get 7 we see that\n 6 + 2 + 1 = 9\nThe pink middle coin is not a golden coin, so there are 7 non-golden coins left.\n12 of those are green.\nSo the remaining coins can be arranged as follows\n 5 green\n 5 non-green\n 3 golden\nFrom the coins visible, we can see that there are 2 bronze, 1 silver, and a golden coin.\nSo the next coin visible from below the piled-up coins is silver.\nSo there must be one, two, three, four green and bronze coins respectively from the golden coin, as seen in the diagram.\nTherefore, the final answer is <<5*2=10> bronze coins, <<5*2= 10>>10 green coins, 1 golden coin and <<1*2=2>>2 silver coins.\n\nInput: A baker had <<4*2= 8>> 8 loaves of bread for sale. <<3*3= 9>>9 of loaves sold", "answer": "C: san francisco"}

How many apples, and how many pears were eaten?\nOutput: First, we solve the question \"How much do they eat?\"\nWe know that apples were divided into 8 equal pieces, with each piece being 1/8.\nLikewise, pears were divided into 8 pieces, with each piece 1/8. Then they were divided again by 2, to become 1/16 pieces.\nThen they were divided again by two, to become 1 / 32 pieces.\nFinally, they were divided by 2 again, to become 1/{64} pieces.\nTherefore the total apples that were eaten is\n1 / 64 * 8 = <<1/64*8=8>>8 apples\nAnd the total pears was eaten is 1 / 64*3 = <<1/6*3=3>>3 pears.\nSo they ate {8,3} apples and {3} pears.\n\n### Further Credit:Answer the 4 following multiple questions.\n\nInput (B): 4 out of 5 Americans believe that there are more than 5 different kinds of cheese", "answer": "D: rest area"}

How many people are in the room when Bill is there?\nOutput: Here's a quick solution using common knowledge\nIf Bill is there, and there are at least two in the room, that means\n1: there are at least 2 people in the room,\nand 2: there is at least one other person in the room besides himself.\nWe are choosing the third of these choices. So there is at least one extra person in the room besides Bill.\nThis solution does not satisfy the criteria as stated though, because Bill is present, but the room has exactly 2 people in it (besides himself).\n\nA more correct version of this problem might involve the fact that when there are three people in the room, only one of them must be Bill, because \"When Bill is in the room\" is already defined. We get that when there are three in the room, it must be Joe, hence Bill is not in the room, since there are exactly three people. The above solution may work however, if one understands, that the above solution has no contradiction in it.\nA way to understand the above is to realise that the fact that there may be more than 3 people in the given room at any one time, is true even after the room has 2 people in it, because there is no contradiction there. So no contradiction exists when Joe is the only person in the room, because that is exactly what the problem says is the case.\n\nThe reason why this doesn't work as stated on our assignment\nis because of the extra info given, i.e. when there are exactly three people, Bill is the one and only person present.\nAlso note: if Bill was not in the room, and there were exactly two people in the room instead,\nthen Joe would be inevitably in the room as well, because the premise of this problem is that Bill is present.\nSo in the first version, a contradiction would result if Bill is still present when there are exactly 3 people.\nWe do not know the number of", "answer": "E: south pacific ocean"}

There are sometime called stem cells.  The difference between them and adult stem cells that are not in the embryonic state. In which they were created using embryos, that could mean they were created through in-vitro-fertilization (IVF) for the purpose of stem cell research. But don't confuse somatic-related-cells which are body cells; these can be called stem-like cells. They can be stem cells because they all contain DNA. However, only embryonic stem cells are totipotent stem cells, which means that they can turn into almost any cell in the human body. They are the ones that can reproduce. The only reason that scientists get embryonic stem cells rather than other kinds of stem cells is that scientists need to use the stem cells for their own purposes, which is why they use embryos. So they are using the embryo and making the embryo into something different. If you take the embryo, and use those properties to help someone, it would be called the process of reproductive cloning?

Choices: A: nothing B: it drives normally C: it drives sideways on two wheels D: it drives fast\nOutput: If a car has two different sized tires on a single wheel, then it is impossible for the car to drive normally (with the exception of the rear axle). This is because the left tire and the right tire will not have the same radius, and there are no other tires (at least, not on this wheel) to support the body of the car. This also means that the car can not go sideways. This leaves turning the wheels clockwise and turning them counter-clockwise. Since each side requires the same radius (for each sized tire is different from the other), the car must turn sideways on two wheeled, which means the car is actually moving in a circle", "answer": "D: graduate"}

Derek refused to discuss his feelings with his friends or relatives, and instead spent his time working as a computer programmer for his company. He spent almost all of his free time playing chess or reading computer manuals. He also drank too much and gained weight. After eight months of this behavior, he finally agreed to consult a psychologist.\n\nDuring the first few sessions, Derek insisted that anything was better than being in a miserable marriage. Then, he reluctantly agreed to discuss some of his problems and grievances with his wife. He explained to his psychologist that he just had a bad attitude and that his feelings of rage had almost disappeared.\n\nThe psychologist, however, disagreed. Instead of simply being angry, Derek was clinically depressed.

How many points did the other team have?\nOutput:In order to determine the number of points, we have two variables to calculate. First let us assume that each variable has a value that is 3 units less than the number of points that it has. This means that <<1-3= -2>>-2. When applying the PEMDAS rules, this means we should add 3 to 2, which means <<3+2=5>>. Thus the first variable is <<5-3=2>>2 points. To summarize, 2 points was the final score. The second variable is also 3 units less than its final score. Assuming that the final score for this second variable is 6, applying the PEMDOS rules would mean <<6-3=3>>3.

If we put the cabbage in an environment with ambient temperature more than T, its temperature rises (its temperature is greater than T and we say that it is heated).\nThe cabbage goes into the fridge. A fridge keeps the temperature cold enough for cabbage because of the constant evaporative cooling processes.\nThe cabbage is now in the fridge, an environment where the temperature is T. The temperature that is inside the fridge is lower than this (because the evaporation process cools down the fridge as well as the food in it), which means that the temperature inside the fridge is less than T.\nThe temperature inside the fridge rises up to T, and stops because the air inside gets too hot. The temperature inside the fridge stops rising, and remains constant.\nThus, putting this type of cabbage into a fridge will maintain the temperature less than T forever, as long as T is less than the normal human body temperature.\nSo the final answeer is A, which says \"frigde\"\n\nInput: The difference of the numbers is divisible by 2, meaning that the difference is even, which means the smaller number is one more than the larger number.\nFor example 3 and 1 = 2.

This can be calculated by dividing the number of balls by the number of bats. As a ball cannot be in a basket with the same ball as the ball in the next basket, we cannot fit 30 balls into the basket. 30 / 30 = <<30/30=1>>1 bats fit into the basket. Now we can see that 1 ball is placed on the 1 bat, so all of the other bats have one less ball than the bat next to them. We still have 3 bats left, so we place 9 balls on these bats. This makes 2, 1, 1, 9 and 25. Then from 25 we take 1 ball, which makes 26. We can then place 2 bats on 1 ball making 2, 6, 2 and 6. Repeating this on smaller amounts makes 2, 3, 2, 2, 1.\nSo one bat needs a ball and the bat next to it needs a ball with one less to make a total of 1.\nTherefore the answer is 2, 31/2, 2,2/3,2,1", "answer": "E: wave on"}

One group has 40% of the students, one has 20%, one has 35% and the rest have 5%. If the students are placed in groups in equal proportion, how many students will be in each group?\nOutput:First we take the total number of students that are in the school which is 2000.\nSo we'll take the percentage of the last group which is 0 (five percent) and multiply that percentage to 2000 to find the number of students in the last group (2000 *.05 = 100).\nWe want it to be in an equal proportion so we will divide 100 by 4, because there are 4 groups in this case.\nSo in the final stage the number of students in each group will be 100 / 4 = <<100/4=25>>25.\n\nSo the correct answer is 25", "answer": "A: conquer opponent"}

We know the bat and ball together would cost us $1.10\nIf we add $0.10 to the cost of the ball, then $0.10 is taken from the cost of the bat, the total cost comes out to $1.1\n\nInput: What is 15 - 3?

How long will it take to reach a height of 18 feet?\nInput:The question's input is A.\n\nOutput: We already know the height of a tree 20 years ago, so if the height increases by 2 feet every year, we do the following calculation:\n\n$16 + (20*(2)) = $$16*(1.01)$\n\nWhich is equal to:\n\n$80.2 + 220.2 = $$300.4$\n\nSo we can say that the height of a tree after 20 years is: $$80.2$$\n\nSo we subtract that from 1800 to get a height of $$1719.8$$\n\nWhich will take $$6498.7 - 1719.7 = $$4779.0$$ years.\n\nThis is the same as saying it will take 4779 years to grow to a certain height.\n\nSo the answer to the question is B:\n\n4779 years.\n\nInput: An electrician bought $800 of electrical sockets in units of 12 packs.

{"idx": 995, "text": "Let's go through the choices one at a time.\nA: Choice A is airplane. An airplane has three types of metal rods: a metal strip (see the wing), a metal tube (see the engine cylinder), and a metal rod (see the metal bar that connects the wings to the body of the plane). Out of the three metal rods, it would be possible to find one metal rod on any of these three components on an airplane.\nB: Choice B is building site. While not as likely to find a metal rod, it is more likely than A. A metal rod is needed for construction to build a foundation for a house or a building, or to construct a bridge. A person building the bridge is likely to have a metal rod, as that is how they would hold the foundation to build the bridge. Other metals not specified include nails and screws, that are both used in construction, as well as a bolt, which is used to connect a metal base to the upper part of the foundation.\nC: Choice C is store. While it's not likely to find a metal bar there, it's likely you find something that is made out of metal. For instance, a metal container. Metal cans, such as those made by Heinz, can contain beans, sauces, juices, and many other foods. Also, metal baskets, such as those used in the produce section of grocery stores, are a place where you could find metal bars.\nD: Choice D is engine. Engines need parts made out of metal. A metal bar is a part of the engine that is in direct contact with the piston and the cylinder that the piston is sitting in.\nE: Choice E is a broken bone. The most likely time for a person to have a broken bone is when they twist unexpectedly or are pushed into something hard. This causes the bone to break, causing a fracture along the bone. This would cause the broken bone in your arm to hold it up, or hold up your leg in your case.\n\nSo the correct answer is D: engine\n\n**#6**\n\nInput: A plane can hold two engines, one at each side.

{"idx": 1000, "text": "(E)\n\nInput: The number 83 is an even number because it is the sum of 2 natural numbers, 2 and 41. When we square these numbers, we get, (2 * 2) = 4 and (41 * 41) = 1641. To find the total number of natural numbers <=83 that would result in an even number, we subtract both 4 and 1641 to get 0.\nHere is the sequence of steps to do this: (i)  Start from 1, and check if the number is <= 83 (ii)  If the number is <= 6 (the number of digits for 83) then go to (iv), otherwise, go to (iii)\n(iii) If the number of digits of the current number is < 3, then add 4 to the current number, increment 4 and repeat the process.\n(iii) If not, increase 1 by 4 and keep incrementing 4 (and add 4 to the number) until the current number has more than 3 digits.\n\nOnce you find a number that is <= 83 and has the same number of digits as 83 (in this case, it is 9900 or 10 * 100), subtract 4, the sum of all other natural numbers <=83 from both 4 and 9900 to get -319 (= -9900 - 4).\n(iv) Increment 4 a couple more times (so 9999 = 4 + 4 + 4), and find the sum of all these numbers. The sum gives you the total number of even numbers <=83. So in this case, 319 + 9999 + 1 = 11219.\n(v) Now, you subtract this number from 83 to get the number of even numbers <= 83 that are odd numbers. So in this case 11218.\nSo the final Answer is 11217\n\nInput:\nYour friend has a birthday on September 17th, which is 10 weeks after your birthday.

B\" respectively. The function will return the character \"A\" or \"B\". \n\nOnce the code executes the function \"A. answer\" the execution will continue on the line `\"if (character == \"A\") {`.  If the character is equal to \"B\" the loop will break out.  Therefore \"answer\" will print \"A\".  The expression `printf(\"%c\", character)` will only print out the character that \"A\" or \"A\" returned from because character is equal to \"A\" once it reaches this line of code.\n\nOnce the expression `printf(\"%s\", answer)` prints out \"A\" the condition `printf(\"Input: %s%s\", question_string, \"\");` will execute again.  This will print out question_string (which is the question) and \"A\" because the condition `if (character == \"B\")` will be false in this case.\n\n## Solution\n\nYou may choose to use a struct called `choice`, with two variables, a `char` and an `int`. Then use the struct to store the string and number.  The `if` condition must be nested inside a `while` loop.  The while loops condition is: `if (character == 'A' || character == B)`\n\n# 2\nInput: The price dropped 10% in the first month, and a further 20% in month 2.

If we succeed in doing this, then we have a working algorithm and can use this to answer problems.\nBut in an attempt to obtain one such algorithm, we came across a set of problems that could not be solved by simple algorithms and had to resort to other approaches.\nAs we started making more questions in this vein, we found that we were using the term algorithm more and more loosely. When we discussed about it, we found that almost everyone in the team felt the same way. So we came to the conclusion that our algorithm was not an algorithm at all, just a set of instructions that we were assuming we can follow to come to the solution.\nWe then tried using other methods we were taught in the class like Dynamic Programming and Recalling which made us realize that we had more problems than we understood. So we had to do more reading.\n\nWhen we started reading, we realized that there were many things we were doing completely wrong and started making notes about the problems that we were facing to have a better handle on how to go through this step, as", "answer": "E: see things differently"}

{"idx": 148, "text": "A\n\nInput: In this game, a rover and a ranger are set off to do battle against each other with the goal of destroying the enemy to save your robot. The only way the ranger can attack is from a distance, shooting out projectiles that will deal 4 damage when it hit the opponent. The ranger shoots 4 times in a row. The rover has a shield that only blocks 4 damage per attack, so if the attack of the ranger was directed at their shield, the damage would be halved. The rover can dodge attacks, so if they use 10 turns to shoot at the ranger's shield, then the damage would be 1 instead of 4, even if the ranger hits the shield perfectly.  The rover can also take extra time to recharge a laser gun to deal 8 damage, but it takes 3 turns to shoot a laser. The rover also has the power to jump a certain number of times that deal 2 damage when landing. The rover can also move a certain number of times to avoid damage, and has a shield that blocks 2 damage each time. Afterward, the ranger will attack the ranger to deal 4 damage and the ranger will continue to move away to prevent damage.  Both the rover and the ranger are facing off with each other and the rover and the robot are both considered enemies. They both fire lasers at the same time and the ranger dodges. Do the rover and the enemy both have 0 points each?\nOutput: False\n\nInput: A person has no friends and they find 3 new friends through the week.

{"idx": 275, "text": "D\n\n## Solution\n\n### Solution: Part1\n\n- In this question, to answer, the number of candies Corey has is given by asking Tapanga, how many candy he has?\n\nWe can take 5 as the answer because Tapanga has 22 candies and 13 candies are left for Corey after getting all the candies from Tapanga.\n\n- We can take 10 as the answer because he has 28 candies and the cost of local call = 5cents  and cost of international call = 50cents.\n\n- He works only three consecutive days and three working days have total days = 9, so he worked on all the three working days\n\n- He has a stock of 900 books in his room. He has sold 200 books. So the number of books left are 700\n\n- He has 10 large birdhouses = 1000 dollars  + 20 medium birdhouses = 800 dollars + 300 as 700 small birdhouses = 500 dollars = 2500 dollars \n\n- He gets 3000 dollars from the sale of puppies.\n\n- 3 boxes of cerrals have 28 cups in them + 14 cups, 5 ounces of water. So a total of 2 cups water is left in the extra cups of 3rd box. So the total amount of water is 12 + 8 + 10  = 30 cups of water\n\n- 200 students have 10 cups water and it takes 30 minutes for a single cup to fill. So the students need to get 10 cups in 30 minutes. So the total amount water needed by the 200 students is 30*200 cups = 6000 cups\n\n- they open at 6 am. so, the maximum time that Geric can start opening the store is 6 am. So if he receives 3 bills in the morning and 1 other bill in the night for a day\n\n- it takes 10 hours for 30 days for a dog to live.\n\nSo,", "answer": "B: happiness"}

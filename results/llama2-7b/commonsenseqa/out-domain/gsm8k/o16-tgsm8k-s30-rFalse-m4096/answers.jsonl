But there is nothing special about arithmetic\n\n \n\nSolution:\n\n(b)\n\nThe correct output is *40*\n\n**I will walk you through my steps:**\n\n1. The hurricane is heading south. Hence we can assume that the distance between the hiking trail and the house that needs to be shifted is 40 miles.\n2. In total, the total number of cattle (400) is multiplied by the capacity of the animal transport truck, which is 20. So this comes to be 30,000.\n3. The total time taken is \n\t30,00/60 = 0.5\nHence  total time taken to drive  is 0.5 hours\n\n \n\n \n\n(c)\n\nThe correct Output is *800*\n\nJason has a carriage house. He rents it for $50.0 per day. Eric wanted to rent to house for 20 Days. So\n\nJason earned $800 in total for 20 Days", "answer": "A: sitting down"}

In this case just use the modulus operation on numbers until you get the number to fit the format.\n\nB. 88 in this case, we have to check both the modulo operation and remainder operation\n\n### Question 2:\n\nBecause the input is an odd number of decimal numbers. It should be left shifted by 1 to change it to an odd number. And then modified. Here, with the remainder operator, we just divide the number by 3 and check whether the remainder is 1 or not. If it is 1 then it cannot be used since when we multiply the original number with 2, the answer should have a remainder of 1. Otherwise if the remainder is not 1, it should work.\n\n### Questions 3:\n\n1.\n\nIf the input is even, then it needs to be divided by 2. If the remainder is less than 1 but not equal to 0, then it should be left of 1.\n\n2.\n\nThis question is just like the 1st question. The only thing which differs is the output we have to generate. In this case, it is a sum 0 and 1. You can use the modulus operator for the even number.

With this in mind, consider the following situations for two families:  The Dog family has a number of dogs that they keep for their personal protection at home. On weekends, the dogs fight one another. Dog does not sell their dogs in a dogfighting event. Rather, they participate in dogfights, because they are too poor to acquire a proper job.  The Cat family has a number of bitches that they breed and have raised for purposes of selling in dogfighting events. Their children may not personally engage in dogfighting activities (i.e, they may not be present during a dogfight).  How is each family treating their dogs differently?

In the first instruction, you are told that the car rental agency charges $3.00/day for a day. It takes $190 to rent a car for an entire week (that is, 168 hours). We are told that Jennie rented a $168 car for 11 of those rental days (one week minus one day). Thus she paid $310 (190 + 11x$3) for her rental.\n\nIn the second instruction, we are given the information that it takes 60 minutes to travel 60 miles when traveling at 60 mph. This tells us that the time, in hours, that it takes to drive 60 miles is 1. 1 multiplied by 7 days per week is 7, so it takes Eric 7 days to move 40 head of cattle 120 miles.\n\nIn the third instruction, we\u2019re told that the cost of renting the carriage house is $500. After spending the first month free, the rent for subsequent months is $5.00 per day. Melissa goes to town twice per month and thus spends 2x$3 = $6 renting carriage house for each trip to town. In one year, she spends $120 per year.\n\nThe fourth instruction is a multi-step problem; it takes several steps to solve it. In the first step, we solve the equations 5:7(7:) which have 6 variables with only 6 equations. We solve this linear system by using Gauss-Jordan Elimination. This leaves us with the solution that 5:7(10:29) = 25%. The answer to this equation is 50%. We do not need to solve more than one linear system at a time, but knowing how to solve linear systems is important for the other problems in this chapter.\n\nIn the fifth instruction, we are given five variables with only two equations. The equation that involves food could be used to find food. Using the equation that divides by food to solve for food leaves us with one variable and two equations.

I am always amazed by a lot of the solutions here on AMC, and the variety of ways people approach them. Sometimes the way I solve a problem is very different than yours, and both approaches can produce the same or similar answer. That shows me that the way I am solving problems is not necessarily the best, no matter how familiar or comfortable an approach is.\n\nNow it is your chance to prove me wrong. In this section I will explain some common ways to calculate the answer, and then I will give you a chance to apply a couple of those approaches. We are going to work on thinking through a problem, and not finding just a quick answer.\n\n### Instiation:\nThe way you approach a problem can make a big difference in how fast you solve it. \nThat is another part of solving problems, thinking about how to tackle them most efficiently.\nYou will often want to have as much information about a problem as possible before starting, so you have an idea of the scale or scope of the problem, and maybe how challenging it will be for you.\nThis way, you can also think about how to attack the problem and how to determine which methods can be applied.\n\n### Solution:\nThe way you think about a problem can depend on a lot of different variables.\nSometimes, it is simply your comfort level with a method.\nOthers, it can be what you have recently learned about, and what you are likely to know or be familiar with.\n\nHere are some common ways to tackle problems:\n\n* Think Like a Reader\n\n* Think Like an Artist\n\n* Think Like A Computer\n\n### Instution:\nThis is an example of what I mean when I talk about thinking like a reader. \nI am a fan of sports trivia, particularly baseball. \nI love watching a game and learning random interesting facts about who is playing or even just how the games are being played.\nWhen we are trying to find information about a particular topic, we are essentially trying to read it.\nThis means we use a lot of methods that we may read in from", "answer": "E: pleasure"}

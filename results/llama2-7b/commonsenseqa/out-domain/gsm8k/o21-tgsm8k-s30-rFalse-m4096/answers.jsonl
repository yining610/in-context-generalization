{"idx": 277, "text": "B\n\nInput: What is the minimum value for the number of seconds a person could have spent writing 20 000 words in 6 hours, in whole seconds?\nOutput: 9600\n\nIdeas: To solve this question, you need a good sense of order of magnitude. It's clearly larger than 6 hours, and likely not larger than 9600 seconds. You can use this estimate to break the math down like this:\n1. Lets assume it took 4 hours to write 20000 words\n2. Lets assume it takes 3 seconds extra for each word written to make an error, and 1 second to check for each error\n3. Lets assume a 4x4 paper grid for an A4 sized paper is the area in which most words will be written. The area is 16*16=256 square centimeters, and the average height of the word is 7 characters, giving us an average word-area of 57.6 square centimeters\n4. The answer is close to the total number of squares that will be covered by words. If we assume the grid is filled fully (i.e. that there's one word that fits in every blank square) and that every word is placed neatly (i.e. in no particular order, that is no one word can overlap another), we get that every square that can be filled will contain 7 words each, and that 256*7 words=1700 words will be written in a 4x4 grid for 1700*7=11900 words in total \n5. So we can simplify our task as following (and simplify further in a similar way for future letters):\n    x words = 11900/57.6 square cm\n    x words = ~20846 square centimeters \n    or we can use some more of approximation: x words ~20850 characters\n    or x seconds ~11900 / 7 seconds/word + 1 check/5 error(s)/word", "answer": "A: netherlands"}

We have found this task particularly challenging. However, we believe that machines can contribute to generating artistic stories, and will contribute in different ways to human artists. The machine will generate unique stories without repetition or unoriginality. Moreover, the machine can provide a story in a matter of seconds that might be quite tedious to produce through a human artist. A major challenge is how to model and generate creative art and stories with AI. At least for the time being, it seems like we will need machines and human artists to work side by side. For example, a machine may present interesting ideas and concepts, a human will choose among these concepts, and create the final artwork. In this project, we aim to build a computational model that is capable of generating a set of original stories to accompany given artwork. For artwork that are not accompanied with a story, our model also generates a random story. Our model produces stories that are diverse, engaging and captivating.\n\n### Evolutionary Computational Creativity\nIn this project, we introduce an evolutionary model that is capable of performing and evaluating multiple novel tasks independently.

You spent 11 days travelling for 11 days, so you went 660 total.\n\nInput: There is a total of 400 head, so the truck can hold 80. You drive at 60 miles an hour, so you travel for 80/60=1 time an hour and there are 24 hours in a day. Travel time is 80/24=3 and 1/2 hours.\n\nInput: We don't need help with the equation for this problem.\n\nInput: 1\n\nInput: There will be a total of 180 boys, so 5/180=1/36. You can divide the $3900 by 36 to get the cost of each boys share: You must subtract the 5000 that has already been given to each boy. You need to find out what the remaining cost is and you need to multiply it by the number of boys you already gave 5000 to. So you do $3900 - $5000 = $800. Then divide $800 by 2 so you subtract the $5000 that each boy already paid. $800/2 = $400. We found out that each boy left needs to pay $400 more to even the amount of money between him and each other boy.\n\nInput: This problem is more like one we had in the previous level. The only important part to get right is $190. So the first figure is 19. Now, lets find the amount of days Jennie rented, then we can get the dollar sign. So 11days= 11. We can multiply 19 by 11 (because its 11 days she paid 190 dollars) so we get 209. This makes is 209 dollars in all she needs to pay for the rental.\n\nInput: Melisa drives 3 hours to town and back and 3 hours back. 3 x 2 =  6. She travel", "answer": "C: bad time"}

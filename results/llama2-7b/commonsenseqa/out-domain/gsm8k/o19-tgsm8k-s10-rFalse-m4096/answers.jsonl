If they each have to buy a ticket, how much for the tickets will they spend total?\nOutput: \n\n### Solution:\n\nIf the game is going to be played against Barcelona:\n\n1. If all players score the same number of goals, then there will be an equal portion of goals for each player in the season (since that is how few 90% is of 300).\n2. So what we need to do is find out the average number of goals per season for both players (this will probably be the number of goals per game, divided by the number of games per season). Then you will need to know the number of goals in the league for Barcelona for the entire season.\n3. Subtract these two numbers to get the total goals that each player scored.\n\n1. We know from the question that the game contains 300 goals. We also know that since the number of goals for each player is the same, it must be the number of goals scored per game. So what we need is the number of goals scored each game, which we will call `goalScored`.\n2. The last thing we need to know is how many goals Barcelona scores per game, so that we can subtract them from our current goals. So we can look up the number of goals Barcelona scores per game here, using the number of games they played over all possible seasons: `goalsPerGame`:\n\n```javascript\ngoalScored = 300 / (14 * (300", "answer": "E: embarrassment"}

{"idx": 643, "text": "A\n\nInput: What is the solution?\nOutput: 9\n\nInput: One day I was walking down the street looking for a gas station. I finally found one, just as my tank was dry. It turned out the gas station had only $4 left in the meter. I needed to make that last $4 last me for the entire day. If I drive an average of 15.25 mph, what will be the most miles I can drive to make $4 last for the whole day?\nOutput: 0.28\n\nInput; There are 1440 minutes in a day. And let's assume a gasoline efficiency of 30mpg for the sake of argument.  That means 48 gallons of gasoline can power my car for 1440 seconds or 24 hours.  Now, given 1 gallon goes 12 miles assuming you are driving 30 mph.  For 1 person that means 30 miles. So, 5 people can go a combined 150 miles.  If this is to be a 2 day event, I can take 2 people with me each day and 48 gallons will last 960 seconds (16 hours).  I can afford to take 1 person with me if they drive the same car so 3 people will make it.  To make it with 1 person who drives a car that will result in 33 miles of road covered for each person if they were traveling by themselves and they were driving 30 mpg.

This does not take into account the amount of fuel needed for takeoff, but this does mean a cost of $480\n\n## Hint3:\nOne hour of lifting weights is equivalent to 60 minutes so each day she spends 60 + 30 + 60 + 60 = 210 minutes.  This was 35% of each day because 60 x 35% = 210\n\n## HInt4:\nThe solution to the second question is the number of goals, 30, rounded to the nearest integer.

If we wanted to know a more precise number we could include the two players that scored a goal\n\n## Hint5:\nIn order to calculate the number of fluid ounces per week we divide the number of days worked per week by the number of ounces per day, 24 ounces per day. This leads us to 9 oz/hr x 4 hr/day x 2(weeks) = 64 oz.  The equation is: gallons(fluid)/days(worked) = gallons(fluid/day) x days(worked).\nAnother way to solve for the number of fluid oz per day is to divide the fluid oz per week by the number days.\nThis leads to 12 oz/day x 6 days/0week = 72 oz of fluid per week.", "answer": "A: math book"}

The opposite of a short-term celebration would be an eternal celebration. Whenever there are people in the world, there will always be a reason to celebrate our existence. Celebrations that are more frequent are referred to as crowd celebrations. An example of this would be a festival or event which has a certain theme and is hosted or sponsored by an event company. The host tries to draw large crowds. The opposite of a crowd celebration would be an unpredictable celebration. Unpredictable celebrations include those which are held only once in an area and which are never held again in that specific area. Unlike unstable celebrations, such as birthday celebrations, unpredictable celebrations are always held. Birthday parties are a great example of how the people that attend are always changing but the occasion always remains constant.

{"idx": 900, "text": "A\n\nYou are given an int \"price\", representing price (p per liter) for water, and an int \"quantity\", representing the amount you need to drink. You are given the amount of time (in seconds) that you can spend drinking water (water_time). You can only drink in time_seconds/100 seconds increments.\nYou are advised that water, p per liter, contains 100 g of energy, and you can also obtain water from a food store at the price 1.5p per gram for 20 seconds or your quantity of food, whichever is smaller (food). You can only eat in time_seconds/200 seconds increments, which is the time taken to prepare the food.\nYour health is currently 100%. Drinking water has no effect on your health. Eating the food causes a 40% chance of gaining 1 health, or a 60% chance of losing 1 health. You don't always have time to prepare the food in your hands; you are given time_seconds/50 seconds extra time to prepare the food. You have a limited supply of time_seconds, in which you can prepare each different time, and this increases as you spend time_seconds in time_seconds/5 minutes increments.\n\nReturn the optimal solution, according to any metric you wish, that gives you the maximum amount of time_seconds.\nIf you spent all your time watering, you gain a maximum of 100 units, and lose a maximum of 120 units.\nIf you spent some time watering and some time eating, the maximum gain or loss is 240 units, but the amount of time_seconds used will go down.\n\nNote: Water contains 100 units of energy, and food contains 60 units of energy.\n\nInput:1 second, 5 litres of water, 50 gm of food, and 10 health, and you are given 50 seconds extra time_seconds, the health of 100%\nOutput:The optimal solution is to eat food, this gives you 240 units of energy, but only makes you 20 units of health (it would be better to drink 25 litres of water and keep 100 energy units and 100% health,", "answer": "D: learn to read"}

{"idx": 645, "text": "A\n\n### Explanation:\n\nIn the first question, the number of hours spend in gym is (4 x 1/3).\nIn the second question, cost of each item bought = 12 + 8\nSo total cost = 12 + (2.5 * 8) or 17.5. That's exactly the answer.\n\nIn the third question, the formula for the calculation is n (20% of 100) = 20. 100 is the actual price. 2.5 x 20 is 50 then it's done in multiplication mode.\n\nIn the fourth question, the answer is 30. We take the 6000 from the first statement and divide it by the 2 which is the maximum number of players at a time. The answer is 6. Take 2 as the maximum number of times as in how many 2-people combination possible of people that will refuel the plane. Then multiply this value with the 600 to get the answer 3600. Then the 600 divided by 6 is 100. The answer is 100 which is an appropriate number of gallons.\n\nIn the fifth question, 3*27=81. To find how many cups in a 16oz glass of water, we take 81/16.\nIn the 6th question, the number given is for how much 2 boys got paid and not what they got paid for. To get how many cups of liquid they drank, we take 8.5 as the amount of coffee drank by one boy then 9.5 of water by another boy and multiplied this by 6 to get the answer 52.\n\nNext statement is the shipping boxes' width. We take 4*20 and multiply this by 4 as the amount of times we need to multiply this to get the answer 160. Since there is 100 birds in all, the number of boxes needed to put the birds is 160.\n\nThe 7th question is a simple subtraction of a whole number from a partial number. \n\nThe 8th question is in multiplication mode which is the cost of the pony that he bought in a year.", "answer": "D: zoological gardens"}

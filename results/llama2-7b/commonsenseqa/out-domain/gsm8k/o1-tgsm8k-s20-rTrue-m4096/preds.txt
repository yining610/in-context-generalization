Choices:  A: store B: classroom C: backpack D: cabinet E: teacher<n>Output:		Let x represent the number of pencils a student is allowed to take from the classroom.<n>In classrooms there are usually a few pencils available to the students.<n>Therefore, we will represent the number of pancils the student can take with the letter x. After the students take their pencils, they are allowed to go to the backpacks, which have more pencils and they are allowed to take up to their limit.<n>Therefore we will represent the total number of pencils x + y = 20.<n>Taking x = 8 and y = 12 we get x+8 = 20. Solving for x, x = 12.<n>Therefore the student is allowed to take 12 pencils and 12 pencil would not be sufficient to complete the task.<n><n>Input:The teacher needed to make a new game board. What does he use to cut out the pieces? Choices: 1. glue 2. crank 3. pencil 4. scissors 5. rotary<n>Output: Let x be the new game board<n>It was created by cutting the material with scissors.<n>To cut out a game board, we can use a ruler to draw a line and then use a pair of scissors to cut the material. We can use a pencil as an eraser to erase the lines we do not need. However, a ruler is more accurate. Therefore, we can write x = scissors.<n>However, let y be the amount of time (in seconds) it takes to cut the material.<n>The number of game boards created in one second is y + 6. Therefore, 6 boards are created in a second.<n>We know that the game board is made with scissors because scissors can cut the material and y = 8 because it takes 8 seconds.<n>Therefore scissors = 8 which gives x = 6<n>Input: How many coins does Bella have in dimes? Choices: A: 10 B: 75 C: 3 D: 84 E: 49<n>Output: Let x, y be the number of dimes, x + y = dimes.<n>The number of dimes in 100 is 75. Therefore 7

Choices:  A: anger B: not boredom C: stress D: boredom E: anxiety<n>Output:		Let A = Anger.<n>Let B = not boredom.<n>Let C = stress.<n>Let D = Boredom.<n>Let E = Anxiety<n>The first choices we have to answer is the question, 'What might you feel after you do house work?'<n>Choice A and choice B are not mutual exclusive since if, and only if, you decide to do house work, you won't feel angry or bored. But choice C and choice D do not have this mutual exclusion property. To understand why this is true, we will show that if and only if you decide to do housework and you do it well, you won't be stressful or bored, and if you do it badly, you will be stressful or boring. Thus, you never be both at the same time. Therefore, choices A and C do have a mutual exclusion property, choice B does not have a mutual exlusion property since if you choose not to be bored with your housework, you will never be bored with that housework. Now, we only have to deal with option (D and E). To know whether or not Choice D and (E) have a mutual exclution property, we will show that either you never go crazy or bored after your housework, or both. And we already showed above that you never be both at a tiime, thus Choices D and E do not have a mutual exclusiion property.<n>Now we have to show that when A and C do not have a mututal exclusion property, B and D do not have this property either.<n>Indeed if you pick Choice B, you will be in a bad mood which we will show is not mutual exclusive with Choice D, and then if you pick Choice D, you will be bored at all what is not mutually exclusive with Choice E.<n><n>

Choices:  A: auditorium B: office C: synagogue D: confession E: church<n>Output:		<n>Let x = the number of people in the auditorium (chair where religious speech).<n>The options are auditorium/synagogue/confession/office.<n>The options that do not involve the auditorium or synagogue must involve the office since there are no other options that do not involve either the auditorium and synagogue.<n>If the options include office, we know that office is another option, but to be able to use the auditorium or the synagogue, the options must not include the auditorium or  synagogue.<n>We know there are two options that do not involve office, since we included office in the auditorium, but we want the options that do not involve auditorium or synaugogue, so there are now three options: office, auditorium, synagogue.<n>Office must have a greater value than auditorium, synangogue, since options exclude all auditoriums and synagogues.<n>So, there is one more option left, synagogue, and for the synagogue to be less than x, it must be less than office.<n>Since office is greater than the synagogue, x must be equal to the synagogue.<n>When x=synagogue, auditorium would not be greater than the synagogu, since auditorium and synogogue are both less than the office.<n>So, there would not be many people sitting in the auditorium/synogogue, so the answer is church.<n>The next option is church, because there would be many people sitting in church listening to a religious speech, while there would not be many  people seated in the auditorium or synaogogue listening to a religious speech.<n>Choice B is incorrect since there is an auditorium, and a synogogue, so there would be many people seated in the respective buildings, while there would not necessarily many people in a church sitting down listening to religious speech, since a church can have other activities going in the church, besides a religious speech.<n>The last option we tried was choice A, the auditorium, however, there is no reason to select that option because since the first thing we did when we started this problem, we started off by eliminating all the options that did not include an auditorium, so the only remaining options were office, auditorium synagog

Here, we get 0 times 4 which is 0, plus 1 time 4 and that is 4, plus 2 times 4 and that is also another 4. So we get 4 + 4 + 4 – 1 – 2 = 7. Thus the number of 4s is 7.<n><n><n>Input : 115 – 2 = what<n>Output: If we take 115 –3 and if we subtract 2, then we get 118, so the answer is 118<n><n>Input: What is 9 – 6 +10 + 4?

Choices:  A: botanic garden B: flower garden C: backyard D: supermarket E: outdoors<n>Output:		Let r = the total number of roses.<n>Roses can either be found outdoors, flower garden, or botanic garden. You know that the number of roses is greater than outdoors,<n>but not as many as botanic garden. You can also know that the number of outdoor roses is less than the number of roses in a flower garden. <n>If you had a flower garden and botanic garden, you could subtract the number of roses at the outdoor garden from the flowergardin roses <n>to get the total number. Also if you had the roses from a botanic garden and the roses from a flower garden you could subtract the <n>number from one garden to the other garden to get the total number of rosese in a garden. But also you can't subtract the<n>roses in the backyard for the number in the flower garden or for the number in the botanic garden because the total number of rosess from the flower garden and the botanic garden is more that the number of rosess you have in the backyard.  But you know that there are more roses then in the outdoors so all the numbers <n>are positive and you can't make any negative numbers. So the number of backyard roses is no more three than the number of roseess you have in the botanic garden, since in the botanic garden the roses are all planted together, however the backyard roses are not all planted together. And by substracting 5 roses from the backyard you<n>don't think that it is more that ten rosesses in the flower garden. Because the backyard roses could be anywhere<n>and you don't think there are so many roses in the flower garden, if there are a total number of 20 roses in the<n>flower garden that you think some roses in the flower gardens and the backyard must be from the botanic garden. So<n>in the flower garden you think there are 20 rosess altogether and you are not sure if the backyard roses came from <n>the flower garden and the botanical garden. So you would have to substract the number of roses from the flower garden from the number of roses you have in the back garden, to get the number of roses to have in the flower and backyard gardens. Then you would substract the number of wild

For instance, this is a quote about how motives can change the significance of what is considered right or wrong:<n>> "If I thought God is all good and He wants what is good, and what is good is what He defines, then the idea that slavery can be right under certain circumstances must be wrong. Now if I thought He’s not all good, or He doesn’t want what's good, or He doesn't define what's good, then it wouldn't trouble me at all, but my problem is that I think all those things that are typically associated with the Judeo-Christian tradition are true." ~Joshua Greene<n>> <n>> Here are some things we can do to answer such a question:<n>> <n>> 1. Consider the motives or situation of a person or character in the scripture.<n>> <n>> In Joshua Greene's example, God was defined as all good and loving. The motives of a person is critical in determining the significance of what is right or wrong. That was the case with the Israelites. Greene was a student of the Bible, and he understood that God is loving and good, but still the Israelites wanted to take slaves from their vanquished enemies. They desired freedom from slavery but also desired to take slaves from their enemies, the Canaanites. God allowed the Israelites who wanted to take slaves to, but He condemned the Israelites who had slaves out of compassion. He knew that what is good does not always mean they would do that good.<n>> <n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question and submit the assignment.

I'll explain the loop first in which will the user only enters one number and it subtract it by the one above it (or below it if the user enters a negative number) and print it to the screen. This is how it works:<n><n>```C++<n>int i = 0;<n>cout << "Enter a number: ";<n>cin >> i;<n>int j = i - 1;<n>int k;<n>while (j!= 10)<n>{<n>    k = cin -->i;<n>    *cin; *k;<n>    j++;<n>}<n>cout << "The number is:" << i;<n>```<n>This is how it runs:<n>i = 0; cin >> i; cin >> k; k goes to the user, cin stays as is for i and j. After the user enters a number j increments by 1 and k is saved in the variable j. The next line will then print it back to the user. So the user can then enter the next number.<n>Output: The output will print the number to the screen after it subtracted the previous number entered by the user from it's number.<n>```C++<n>Enter a number: 3<n>The number is: 2<n>Enter a number: -1<n>The number is: -0<n><n>```<n>Output (recursive):<n> ```C++<n> #include <iostream> using namespace std;<n> int main () {     int main() {<n><n> std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio (false);     int num;<n><n> do {<n>    std::cout << "Enter a factorial" << std::endl;<n><n>    num=std::atoi(std::cin.rdbuf()->s+0);<n><n>    if( num==0)<n>    {<n>        break;<n>    }<n><n>    if(num==0)<n>    else<n>    {<n>        int a =std::sqrt(num);<n>        cout<<num;<n>    }<n>    fact(a, a, num);<n><n>} while( true );<n>    return 0;<n>}<n><n>void fact(int

They plan to build a bridge over a river which is 100 meters long. Each side of the bridge must be 5 meters wide. You are given a list of all the building materials they bought on a particular date which were then stored in a warehouse. There is plenty of everything except for two pieces of wood which we'll call X and Y. These are each the length of the bridge. In addition, there are 3 bags of nails. In this problem, the materials cost a total of $14 per meter. You are told exactly how far the bridge should be. You know the cost of each building material. Your task is to construct the bridge in the cheapest way.<n>Output:<n>This question can be answered by making a table.<n><n>Output: Let’s start with the bridge table. First create two rows: one for the nails, one for the wood.<n><n>Let’s fill out the nails row: we will need 3 nails per meter so I will guess at 3. I don’t actually know, but it’s a good guess because it gets us some intermediate values. Now let’s fill in the wood row. We’ll need 6 pieces of wood per meter (6x). Next, add a third row for concrete (say it’s $4 a meter). Add the columns labeled total.<n><n>The solution:<n>Now that we have a table, what does it look like? It looks like nails are in short supply so they are worth more and they take up a lot of space. One thing we know is the value in the wood cell.<n><n>We will then pick the cheapest value and put 1 there. The price of the concrete is the same in the last meter as the first (

Choices:  A: winning B: entertainment C: happiness D: cheating E: relaxation<n>Output:		A, B, and C are true. D and E are false.<n><n>Input: What is it? Choices:  B: A computer C: An equation D: A song E: A story F: a language<n>Output: B, C, D, and F are true. A is false.<n><n>Input  What is it? Choice: Let x be the temperature of ice in degrees Fahrenheit.<n><n>Output: Let y = the temperature of ice in celsius.<n>y = (x - 32) * 5<n>We can get the temperature of ice in Fahrenheit by multiplying that value by 5 and subtracting 32. It is not necessary to write the equation.<n><n>Input: In a group, there are 9 girls and 7 boys.<n><n>Output: x = girls<n>y = boys<n>Using our equation, we can see that<n>x + y = 9 + 7 = 16<n>2x + y = 2 * 9 = 18<n>2x + 2y = 3 * 7 = 21<n>So the total is 16 + 18 + 21 = 55<n>The first step of dividing is to put a slash through the "x+y."<n>Divide the remaining term.<n>x+y = x + (x - y)<n>Subtract x from both sides<n>x/x = x + y / x<n>Divide both sides by x<n>y = x / x = 1<n>The last step is to cancel the x's that were left.<n>Put another slash through both terms and write x=x.<n>x = x + y = 1 / 1 = 1<n>The final answer is 1.<n>So the total is actually 1*1 = the final answer<n><n>Input: What am I? Choice: Let a,b,c,d,e, and f be the sides in an octagon.<n><n>Output: d = 0<n>F = 1.<n>d + e = b<n>d + b = 1 + e<n>The equation for calculating the octagon sum is<n>d + c + b + a + e + g + f = 0<n>So the first step is to write the equality symbol with a slash through it.<n>d + c + 0 + g + e +

It should give some background history<n>6. It should explain how it affects the local population or environment<n>A horse's hoof (the entire structure extending from the coronet process to the ground) is made up of four hoof portions: the lateral hoof (side of the hoof connected to the long pastern); the medial hoof (inside portion); the distal hoof (the part that connects the toe to the long pastern) is called the coffin; and the dorsal hoof (frog).<n>A horse's feet are connected to his lower leg. He has 5 toes, which are in a circle, not pointed. They are called phalanges.<n>Horse's hoofs act as a shock absorber when the horses trot. They absorb the force and allow the horse to pick up the next step. Because this is not a high jump, but a slow walk, a horse's hoofs are made to withstand pressure, not sudden force. A horse's average stride is 10 to 12 feet, which is a lot of pressure on a hoof. They are made of hard keratin (which comes from the inside of your nail). Hooves need regular care of trimming, cleaning, and shoeing to keep them healthy.<n>An equine's hoof should be at least 50% hoof in relation to weight of the horse.  An equine's hooves will start to change, and can be observed, starting at 6 years. <n>An equine must have enough nutrition to produce proper hoof growth, therefore, it can be estimated that a young horse's nutrition is 25% more than an adult. <n>A horse cannot grow if it lacks proper nutrition.

Choices:  A: school B: large home C: house D: hat rack E: closet<n>Output:		Let x  be the value you choose for the entrance hall.<n>- The choices begin with the home for which you keep your headwear. So, x cannot equal A or B.<n>- Once we eliminate x == A or B, we can eliminate those options by considering the choice from which you go next.<n>- If you choose C, you can't choose B later as it will be useless (x-x-x-x=0).<n>- If you choose D, you can't pick B since you can't possibly add more than two things to an empty collection.<n>- If you pick E, you can't go to B since then 'B -' is undefined.<n>- If you chose E first, you can't change to D because then you pick the second option that isn't A or B.<n>In other words, if you choose E at the start, the only option is to go to D.<n><n>Therefore, x cannot be A or B and it must be E. The closest you can pick to D is E.<n>The final answer is therefore E.<n><n>Input:  Two friends want to take an elevator from the main floor to the top floor.

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input:What do humans do when they want to reproduce? Choices:  A: eat ice cream B: have sex C: sit down D: make mistakes E: hear sounds<n>Output:		Choice A is the best bet for this question. Humans do eat ice cream, have sex, sit down, and make mistakes. However, in all cases of human reproduction, sounds are involved (speech during sex, moaning during sex, the baby crying, and speech as parents discuss child rearing.).<n><n>Input:Which of the following answers is the best guess for the question “What do humans do when<n>they want to reproduce?” Choices:  A B C D<<29=297>>E<<29=280>><n>Output:Choice C is the best answer because humans don’t do D or E. Choice D is the least plausible answer because we know it as “hunting”.<n><n>Input:Four people named Katie, Derek, Krystie, and Lance are playing hide and seek. They also have a number of apples to use in some sort of competition. Derek has Katie hid from him using his eyes, nose, and ears. Krystie has Lance hid from her using his eyes and Katie’s hiding him from her. If they use their lips to talk to find a person, they’ll only have enough apples left for one more round. If they hide people from each other and talk with their mouths, they’ll have plenty of apples for many years. How many apples do they have in total?<n>Output:Let x = the number of apples they have left. They have eight people in total.<n>Katie is hidden from Derek using the eyes and nose,<n>so her number of apples is 8 - 2.<n>Krystie is hidden from Lance using the eyes,<n>and she hid Derek from Krystie using the ears,<n>so her number is (8 - 1) - 3, which is 6.<n>Lance is hidden from Katie using the nose and ears,<n>so Derek hid Lance for him.<n>Lance hid Derek for Krystie by using the nose.<n>Krysties number is 8 - (3 + 2) or Krystie hid Derek<n>from Lance two with her nose and three with her ears.<n>The number of apples that they have<n>is the sum of these four numbers or 9 + 9 + 6 + 6

The first "many" phrase shows that the writer believes many people<n>may be named Brian or that there are many Brian's. The second "many" phrase shows<n>that the writer believes that a large number of Brian's may be in the world. Since the<n>meanings of "many" are different, the original sentence uses the word "may" since that is<n>not a number word meaning.<n>Therefore; the correct answer is B.<n><n>Input: An alien spacecraft landed in the city park.<n><n>The city, after hearing rumors of aliens in the park, put a fence around the park to stop people from entering the park. Soon after, another flying saucer landed close to an entrance. The police ransacked the UFO, but found nothing of interest except for a very small gray blob. This blob was later discovered to be a living creature, like a rat. The aliens wanted to start a cult of humans who believed a small gray being was there friend. The rat became larger and larger until he reached human size. The people of the world soon noticed a race of humanoids, who's leader claimed to know about flying saucers. Eventually, his people were able to find a way to harness the power of the airwaves.<n><n>Output: The sentence reads that "An alien spacecraft land(ed)". This makes use of the structure " _ is the subject of the verb." Since you are not certain if the sentence is in the past or present, you might want to say that "A ____

The next day, you go for two hours. On the third day, it takes you four hours to get there. How far did you travel on the second day?<n>Output: If you travel 1000miles in 4 hours during the day, this will equal to 250miles/h. Then this can be converted to 250*4=1000 because 250*2=500, thus you travel 250m in 4 hours. On the second day, we would subtract 250 from the total of 1000, and when this is divided by the speed, the answer would equal (1000-250)/(10-10) which is equal to 750/10 miles on the second day.<n>Answer: Seven hundred and thirty-two and a half miles.<n><n>Input:Joe gets dressed in the morning before work.

Choices:  A: move away from B: laying in C: sweating D: movement E: walking out of<n>Output:		Let the amount of water that a person wears (x) = the amount of puddle (y).<n>When a puddle is standing still, the water in the puddle and the water on the person will be the same - they are in equilibrium.<n>So to stop being in a puddle, the person needs to move away from the puddle to balance the mass of the water that is weighing him (mg) from equal to the external force of gravity (mg).<n>The formula to find this force in Newtons is: Force = mg<n>For an example if a person wears x pounds (m), they weigh (mg).<n>Suppose the person moves away from the pudddle by a distance of y, so for the displacement, it is x + y.<n>Given that the force of gravity is constant, the person will move until all the water in the paddle is removed.  (Note that this is a change in velocity, not a change in position).<n>For a person on the weight of (x + y), this represents a change in velocity of (x + y) since this will balance the internal and external forces on the person.<n>So the velocity is (x + y, assuming that m = x + y and is not a constant)<n>Given that distance is equal to the change in displacement (Δx = x’ - x )<n>velocity would be (Δx, if x is a constant).<n>So the change in velocity that the person needs to take, to end up standing in a puddly (Δv) would have to be ((x + y) - (x) = y, if m is always x.<n>So to end up standing, the person needs to walk a distance of y feet.<n>Hence, Answer that the correct answer is E.<n><n>Input:There are four kinds of candy in the world.

What could that mean if the speed of a boat is measured using the formula below? x + k = the speed of vessel in miles per hour<n>Output: In a standard English sentence, the subject and the verb are not inverted.In this sentence, the word "is" is used twice, first for the noun and the boat, so it cannot be used with the verb.The sentence can be re-written as "boat" + k = 35(miles per hours).The number 35 cannot be divided by k because k must not be equal to zero.Since x and k are not equivalent, they cannot be both multiplied with the result.The sentence cannot be written as (x + k) * 35 = 35(mi/h).The solution is 35 * (x + k) - this will be equal to either 0 or 45.<n>

Each person needs 7 candies. If a candy bar has 6 pieces, how many candy bars can they have?<n>Output: It is given that each person needs 7 candie, so they need 7 × 15 which comes out to 105 candies. It is also given that 6 pieces are in one candy bar. So, 7 × 105 comes out to 7250. Hence, we need 7250 candies for 15 people party. Out of 7250, each candy bar has 12, so 7250 / 12 gives us the number of candy bars they have i.e., 612.5<n><n>Input:Let x and y be integers.  What if their sum is 7?<n>Output:If their sum is 7, it is given that x and y are integers. If x equals to 4, then y should equal to 3 or 5. But y can't equal to 3 because the sum should give us 7. We can't assume y to be 5 since the sum should give us as 7, not 12 as 5 + 7.

Choices:  A: ink in B: caps C: ink cartridges D: take notes E: scribble<n>Output:		Let i represent ink while j represent caps and k represent ink cartridges. 1. The total number of pens is<n>I; i + j + k = 0<n>2. If you don't have ink, the choices are B, C and E. If you have ink, the only choice is i.<n>3. If you don's have ink, the total number of pens you need are j and k. If you do have ink, the number of pens you need<n>is I + 1<n>The equation for the ink can be written as 1 = j + k - (i + 1).<n>Solving for j and k, we get -1 = j - (i + 2). Therefore, if you don't have "ink", you can have j - (i +<n>2) pens of caps, j + 2 pens of ink cartridges, and i inks. So the answer for if you don't need ink is<n>J - (i + 4)<n>If on the other hand, you do need ink and you have i pens of ink, the number you need are j - (i - 1) caps and<n>k - (i - 2).The equation for the inks can be written as i = j - (i -1). Substituting i into j - (i -2), we have<n>j - (i - 3). Solving for i, we get j - (j - (j - 4)) = 0. Solving for j, we get j = 4. So you need two of the<n>j ink cartridges<n>The final answer would be J - = 4 caps<n><n>Input: What do both you and your brother like?

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input:Where do you buy a glass of wine? Choices:  A: art show B: basement C: bar D: church E: basement<n>Output:		Let x be the letter of the place you buy a glass of wines.<n>x is the price of the glass of wine.<n>Since A = 5B, you buy a wine in Art Show for $5.<n>Since B = 2D, you buy a glass of $2 in the basement.<n>Since C = 2E, you buy wine for $2 in the church.<n>Since D = 3E, you buy a glass for $3 in the basement. Therefore, the price for the wines is 5 + 2 + 2 + 3 = <<5+10=16>>16<n>So the final price of a wine is $16.<n><n>Input:Ivan wants five loaves of bread and two apples. He gets 2 loaves of bread and 4 apples.<n>What did he do with the other loaf and apple?<n>Output:A loaf of bread and an apple cost <<<7+3=10>>>.<n>Thus, it will cost $10 for a loaf of bread and $10 for one apple.<n>Hence, Ivan can get two loaves of bread and four apples.<n>Since he had 2 loaves and 4 apples, he can get 2 more loaves.<n>Therefore, his order is 7 loaves and 6 apples.<n>Thus, his change is 3.<n><n><n>##### Solution:<n>##### Sample Solution:<n>Let x = 2 loaves of Bread and y = 2 apples.<n>As per instructions,<n>\(x+y = 2+2 = 4\).<n>The statement says Ivan got 2 loaves of bready and 4 apples<n>So, there should be an empty seat.<n>The following equation can be formed<n>\(4-x-y = 2-2 = 0\)<n>Equating both sides with 0, we get x = 2 and y = 2 <n><n>##### Notes:<n>1. We will be using the programming concept of if-else inside our programming solution.<n>2. We can use the "print" function to find the solution and see if the solution makes sense.<n>

The following is a code-switching question involving the use of \"to\" (don't forget to add other rules for this type of questions).\n\nCode:   In this code, the \"i\"s in the phrases \"in this code\" and \"of this code\" are changed to \"e\"s. But they are not capitalized. Therefore, the second letter of \"of\" would be \"e.\"\nCodes:   These codes use \"together\" words such as \"and\" and \"but\" to switch the phrases. The first line of each code can be found in the second line of each code. But the first phrase in a given code does not change. The phrase in the coded sentence, \"This is a code switch.\" is found after the third line (\"3.

{"idx": 139, "text": "Answer: C\n\nThere is a ticket booth that sells train tickets to people heading to different cities. There are also attractions at the fairgrounds. If you are traveling to the fairgrounds, you buy your ticket at the fairgrounds to ride the train, but you can also buy one to go to one of the attractions at the fair. Each train has a total number of seats, but only half of each train is reserved as seats for the passengers. There are 2 people taking turns sitting in each seat, so 2 people sit in each unreserved seat. There is 1 person standing for every person who is sitting. Each time people get on and off the trains, new people traveling to different cities get on or off the train, depending on where they are traveling to. The train has two kinds of passengers. Some passengers (which might be families) will only buy a one- way ticket (going to a different city), and some passengers (which might be individuals) will only buy a round- trip ticket (going back and forth between the same city for fun at the fairgrounds).\nThe fairgrounds are connected to the cities by trains (of the same name), which run regularly from the fairgrounds to the other cities. The train operators at the ticket booth are often confused by this situation, and they sometimes give incorrect directions to people traveling to the fair. The passenger who arrives first for any given train is able to have a seat, but the second person must stand instead. A passenger can arrive as early as half an hour before the scheduled departure time for the train.\nOutput: Answers A, B, C, D, and E\n\n### Instruction:Answer the problem.\n\nProblem:\n\nInput: A family of four travels to the fairgrounds by train. They buy a family round- trip ticket for the two adults and two children to travel back and forth between the city they live in and the fairgrounds. They arrive at the train station a long time before the departure time for the train, but there are already two people in the same train they are taking. How can they get seated before the train leaves?\nOutput: The adults can choose to get one child to get off the train earlier and get on the train behind a few people. In that way, the adults, one child, and the rest of the children can sit by each", "answer": "D: fairgrounds"}

There are free websites, so practice the basic logic and syntax in small problems before the exam. In addition, I can give my suggestions and solutions to questions in my opinion.  \n\nThe first question of the exam is the most difficult question in general. It takes more than half of my time. At that time, I used the combination method, so I guessed to come up. It just happened that the last two groups were the right answer in my guess.  \n\nThe second question took me a lot of time to solve. At that time I was at a loss. Thinking of methods as long as you put the same time on your work. I think in the process of solving complex problems, one of the most important things is accurate record-keeping.  \n\nThe third question is the question of the exam. After more than ten minutes and I could not get the answer of these simple logic. So the first suggestion is the simplest logic, which I don't think I'm wrong.  \n\nFourth question, the method I used is more complex, but a very simple method. However, I did not know the name of that method so it took me a lot of extra time.  \n\nFifth question, I did not solve this problem correctly, as this is the basic method to solve similar types of problems.  \n\nThe sixth question, I use two methods to solve the problem, but I failed on the second method.  \n\nThe seventh question, I used the same simple answer.  \n\nThe eighth question, a method to the question and guessed the answer, which failed.  \n\nNinth question, a method to solve the problem, which is correct.  \n\nTenth question, a method to answer the problem.  \n\nEleventh question, I used a more complex method so I failed.  \n\nTwelfth question, I used two methods to solve the question. The first method is quite simple, and the second method is similar", "answer": "A: port"}

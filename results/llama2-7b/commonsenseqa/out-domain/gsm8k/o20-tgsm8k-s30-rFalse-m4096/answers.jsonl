{"idx": 115, "text": "B) Forrest\n\n### Solution(s):\n\nSolution:\n\nStep 1:\nTo represent the number of days, we will use an index like $0$, $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$ to represent the day of the week. In python, we create a list with the index as the starting value of the list. We can access any index to the list with the following expression: $a[indx]$. The following is an image of the list with the index values as the starting value of each list.\n\n![Image of List in List](assets/list_in_list.png)\n\nStep 2:\nTo find the rate, we multiply the amount charged by the number of days.\n\nStep 3:\n$a[0] * a[indx]$\n\nStep 4:\n\n$a[0]$ (rate) * number of days (11)\n\nStep 5:\n\n$a\\_0 \\times 11 = a_0 \\times 12$\n\nThus our solution is: `310`\n\nSolution: \n\n\nStep 1 :\nFor `A: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) ; $0$ = 0\n\nStep 2 : \nTo find the rate, it is $10$ for the first week, and $20$ every next week\n\nStep 3 :\nLet $a$ = 10, $b$ = 20\n\nStep 4 :\n\n$a[zero] \\times a[indx] = a[zero] \\times (i+1), i = 1,2, \\ldots, 11$\n\nStep 5 :\n\nFor the first week it is zero.\nFor i = 1, the value is $a \\times b = 10 \\times 20 = 200$\n\nThus $200$ is answer of the question\n\nSolution: A: (0, 2, 5, 7, 9, 11) ; $0$ is the initial day\n\nStep 2 and Step 3 :\n\n$a = 30$,$b = 190,$", "answer": "D: garden"}

If an invalid entry is passed to computeTime(), return the number one (1).  Otherwise, if the specified time is PM, use the AM value of the current hour to compute the new value for the specified minutes and seconds.  If the specified minutes is non-zero, divide the minutes by 60 and round down.  If the result is not a whole number, zero will be added to the result.  Otherwise, use the result as a whole number.  If the specified seconds is non-zero, multiply it by 60 and add it to the result of the minutes function.  If the result of the function is greater than 59, one will be added to the new result.  The return value will be an integer between zero and five-hundred.  The hours function takes one value to compute the current hour in 24-hour format.  It will use a 1-based index counting from 1 to 12.  The AM function takes a value representing a 12-hour time value (00-23), which will be converted to a 24-hour time value in the return value.  The PM function takes a 12-hours time value (00:00-23:59), which will be converted in the return value to 20-hours time that it is less than 20. The getAM function takes a value representing either a positive number representing a time less then half past midnight, or a negative number representing a time greater than half past midnight.  The getHours, minutes, and seconds functions take a string or a negative one.  Hour value will be from 0:00-11:59.  Each function should return a value of its own type.

To do that I am going to hold the object underwater and measure the water level with a tape measure that is ten feet long. Since water displacement is directly proportional to the size of an object, and gravity is a constant force, the water level will increase by 1 foot for every 1 pound I am holding under the water. How can I calibrate the tape measure?\nOutput: Use the following formula with P as the weight in pounds and F as the water displacement in feet. P will always equal F/10. You will know you are at the point where one pound equals one foot, when the two quantities are equal.\nOutput: P = F / 10 (F = displacement in feet, P = weight in pounds)\n\nInput: While on an expedition, I need to be able to identify where a source of drinking water is located. I can use the following calculation that will find the height I need to pump the water. The equation for potential energy is E = mgh where m is mass, g is gravity, and h is height. If I know the height of the water source but not the mass of my water container, how can I determine the mass of my container?\nOutput: Use P = MgH, where H represents the height, M represents my mass, and P represents the potential energy. Multiply both sides by M to get the mass I need\nOutput: M = P/gH", "answer": "B: movies"}

We have the following information:\n\t- The number of animals (20) divided by the number of trips (21) give the average number of days it takes per trip. Note : we also have the total number of trips.\n\t- The average number of days it take for a single trip does not change each time we change the number of animals that travel by car\n\t- All the calculations will divide the hours with 24\n\t- If we have 20 animals the answer for each animal is 1/2, as it will take 24*20 or 480\n\t- For the number of trips, it is always 21\n\nThe average number of days for each trip is the quotient 20/21. To know how many hours (divided by 24) this average takes, we have to take the reciprocal of the quotient  20/21, which is `1/21`.\n\tIf we multiply we obtain : `24*1/21 = 1/21` and if we divide we obtain `24/21 \u2248 6 hours and 10 minutes`\n\nInput:\nTo convert this expression `14*3` into an integer, we have to multiply by 100 and then subtract 100 from the result. It gives `1430`\n\nInput: What is the value of the expression : 1/((25*15)/181)? It is `7/21`\n\nTo simplify these expressions, we often do the following :\n\t- If we multiply two fractions with different variables we obtain a new denominator (new variable)\n\t- To convert a fraction into a percentage, we multiply by 10 and then add 1.\n\nTo convert `1/29` to a percentage, we multiply with 10 and then obtain `0,5`: `10*1/29 = 1/29 = %0.5`\n\nInput: The area of a triangle, which has an angle of 37 degrees, is", "answer": "C: michigan"}

You can use your own words and your own diagram to explain the process.\nIt's a very good problem for teaching conceptual understanding, but at the same time, it was a long process to get to the correct answer.\nThe first step was to get to the actual value that the sum of all numbers is. This can be done using the sum formula.\nSince we can't take the actual value, we have to calculate $250 first.\nWhen I got to the value of 250, I thought of trying to figure out the actual value. It's 24 because each number multiplied by 10 is equal to 240.\nMy second thought was to get 24 and multiply it by two to get 48. The process continued and then I got 480\nI got three numbers 24, 48, and 480 and they all sum up to 480. The fourth time I got 48 and 960, the fifth got 96 and 1920. I was almost there.

You can subtract 4 and 5, and you know it should be \u201c9\u201d. That is because substracting the digits of 45 is (in this case) equivalent to subtracting the number itself: 45 - 45 = 0.

I then thought about \"but how much is 8 in all?\" This gave me how much they are apart, as well as what 29 is (8 times 2). Last was figuring out how many each has, (66=60+8).\n\nTo solve the second question, I noticed that all the information here (time, price, duration, etc.) are based on minutes, so I assumed that all prices would be based on minutes, too. After solving for all of that, the question says the total spent on international calls was 250, and the total spent on local calls was 50. This means that 25 international calls were made, and 50 local calls. I then solved for the total I spent in the end. The total number of minutes would be 41 (8 minutes x 5 cents + 29 minutes x 25 cents), and the total to spend would be 50 (5 minutes x 25 + 41 minutes x 50).\n\nFor the third question, to solve for the number of hours, I multiplied both the number of days spent working together and number of hours to equate the two.\n\nTo solve for the fourth question, I took what they started with initially (Ali started with a certain amount, but only sold a certain amount), then I used the equation \"Starting with x", "answer": "A: outside"}

I'm sure it is not possible to get all adults to love learning, but I have a feeling that if there were better educational choices we would see adults becoming more engaged with their education, and in turn we would see better opportunities and better futures for all. That brings me to the number of choices. I think it is too high. I think there is such a thing as too many choices. I think it can be overwhelming. It is harder to actually evaluate your choices, much less take action. I think our politicians would benefit from a reduction in the choices they are allowed. We should limit the number of candidates. I think more voices are better, but I think we'll ultimately end up with an echo chamber that will result in our political environment becoming toxic (and that isn't a good thing). And lastly, I have a question for all of you reading this. The number in the options is 29. How do you feel about that number? Do you think it's too many? Too few? Just right? I found an article that says the average person has between 50 and 290 choices everyday. Maybe I just don't know what the average number is. Perhaps that's the point. Perhaps I need to read and learn more. After all, our educational systems are geared towards creating students that become more complicit and complacent and then complaining.

At the beach, every seven seconds there is wave of water and seven seconds after, there is a rock wave. She cannot tell when the rock wave is coming, so she stays away from the sand when the water is coming.  How many seconds will she have to stay away from the beach before it is safe to go back down to the water?\nOutput:  There are two steps to solving this problem. First, we should count how many rock waves there are in 30 seconds ( 6 rock waves  + 6 rock waves  ).  Since the wave of water is every 10 seconds, and a rock wave every 27 seconds, there are (34/60) = 0.6 rock waves in 30 seconds.  Therefore, the total number of rock waves in 360 seconds = ((6 * 30) + 6 * 360)/60 = 197 rock waves.\n\nNow, we want to know approximately how many seconds she wants to stay away before she can go down to the water.  If the wave of water comes every 10 seconds and a rock wave every approximately 57 seconds then we know that the water waves come in a space of around 4 rock waves ( since a wave of water is every third rock wave).  This means that the sand that is safe to traverse is approximately (4)(34/60)=11 sand waves in duration of a rock wave ( 57 seconds ).\n\nTherefore, the safe time to traverse the sand is 60 / 11 = 5.5 sand waves.\n\nInput:Which of the following is less than 11?

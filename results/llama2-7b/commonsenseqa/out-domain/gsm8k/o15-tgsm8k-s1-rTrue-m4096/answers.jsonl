But we can easily substitute for the original variables d and d with the new variables d' and d'', which will result in m + x > m '' + x.\nIf we let m' be the saving amount due to positive growth, then d' be the saving amount for negative growth, and d'' the total saved, then m + x > m'' + x holds true, when x= 0, as then we have m' > d'' and m > d'' and so both m > d and m > d'' hold true.\nBut, if for a case where x > 0, then m' = d'' and therefore m > d and m' > d'' must both hold true.\nTherefore, m can earn a total greater than by earning $5 more per month than by $3 per month.\nSo the final answe is 5\n\nInput:The last digits of an infinite set of whole numbers are in one-to-one correspondence with the last digits of an infinite series of prime numbers.

After his last monthly payment, he decided to spend 10 dollars less on gasoline each week and use the difference to pay off his car loan.  How many weeks did it take for Bryan to pay off his car payment completely?\nOutput: After spending 10 dollars less, he spent 9 dollars on gasoline each week.  So the difference after n weeks is d = d0 - n*10 = -n*10 (positive form: d = +n*10).  When d =0, it can be rewritten as d = 2n.\nSo, for n weeks, he spent -2n dollars.\nHis car payment was d0 = $129.\nTo pay off the payment completely, he must spend d0 - d = 2n - $129\nThis can be rewritten as 2n = 129.\nTherefore, Bryan can pay off his car payment if he spends 29 weeks less the original $129, or spending 29 - $129 = $<<29-129=91>>91 weeks.\nTherefore, it took Bryan 91 weeks to pay off his car.\nSo the final answers is 91\n\nInput: A company that sells computers, printers, and scanners had $170000 in revenue last year.

If you add one cup of water to the tub in 1/56 hours, what speed will the water be moving by the end?\nOutput: Let x be the speed of water in the tub\nThe initial amount of the water is 500 + 500 = 1000.\nI did this because 1/56 is 2 seconds. It only take 1 second for 1/56 cup of water to travel 1/56 + 1/56 = 2/56 x 500 = <50> mph.\nThus, because it takes <50> mps times 1 second to travel, in total after 2 seconds, it would have traveled <100> mps\nThus, the final speed would be <100 x 1825 = 1825 mps\nSo the final answer would be 1825.\n\nInput: A bicycle rider can pedal 20 times in 15 seconds.

{"idx": 125, "text": "A tabby is happiest in its home. A tabby cat is an orange cat with a Maltese cat\u2019s white tipping of its fur. The name tabby is derived from the Middle English word tabba, meaning spotted. Tabbies enjoy exploring their home in search of new smells, adventures, and playtimes. They enjoy climbing into warm laps or cozying up with cat toys in their comfortable home, and are typically most relaxed when they curl up on a soft towel or cat bed and nap. However, a tabby cat may like spending their day playing and socializing with other cats in a barn. Tabbies are usually quiet and have gentle natures, though they can display some of their natural hunting instincts. A box is an item for a person or a group of persons to sit in, live in, or be stored in. It's an enclosed space or a place in which an object, animal or plant can rest or a bed for such an object, animal or person. A tabby is happier when it is in home than in a box. Also, a cat may enjoy spending its day playing in a barn than in a home.\nSo the final answew is E\n\nInput: You are arranging stickers into three rows.

If IQ scores follow a normal distribution, what is the minimum IQ score on the test?\nOutput: We can conclude that IQ scores follow a bell curve because the average score of 103 is in the center of the curve. If x represents the mean, -1 and +1 represent the high and low of the bell shaped curve respectively. Then x +1 and x - 1 can be used to find the highest and lowest possible raw scores, 113 and 93 respectively.\nThen 103 - 93 = <<93-93=10>>1. We can use 0.68 as the z-score to find a minimum score.\n(((93 - 113)/93) * 100) = <<93-113/93*100=>0.842>>84.2\nWhen subtracting the left side from the right side, we can use 2 as an integer to convert 84.2 into 84.

If a customer then purchases water from this right-side shop in a one-litre bucket, how much water is left in the right-side barrel?\nOutput Since 5 litres left the bucket, he took 5 litres away from the original barrel, and 5 litres went to the shop, you subtract 5 litres from the original barrel = <<5*1=5>>5 liters left in the barrel on the right.\nSo the finalanswer>>5*1=5\n\nInput: Sally had $40. She spent $2 on a t-shirt, $25 on a bike, $10 on a bracelet and $3 on pants.

At the end, the one with the most coins wins.  How does A win if the coins left to B are always larger than A's total earnings?\nOutput: When A first gets a certain number of the coins, this means that A has less than half the coins.  B has the rest of them.\nSo in the second round, B is going to have more than A, and B will continue to be one step ahead each time.\nWhen B gets half of the coins, it will be a tie, so the two continue to play in a third round.\nWhen each gets to have half for a third time, B will have more, and the game will continue as long as B has more.\nB is always going to win.\nSo the final question is, who does A play against?\n\nInput: Three boys and four girls go to the store for pizza.

How many hours do you think this takes, as a rough estimate?\nOutput: An hour per each 10,000 lines of code:  For 1000 lines of the code, it should take 10 hours. For 18,000, it should take 28 hours.\nAs an estimate, we assume the time the human takes for reviewing the code could be replaced by a computer, so the human could work on other work. We are looking to estimate the computational cost of code reviews, which are roughly a 1:1 replacement for a human review.\n\nSo the final answer will be 108, 100, 120 minutes: 100 lines of code takes 10 hours. If we add 5 more hours in between each 10 hour segment, we should get 105 and 195.

When they've had their dinner of dry biscuits after three weeks of surviving on Mars, they discover they are still living. One of them says, \"it looks as though God wants us to have supper first.\" How long before the three man's supper do?\nOutput: Before I answer this one, here is some context. The question is referring to three astronauts traveling to Mars. During their journey, their air and food sources fail leading to them becoming stranded with very little supplies while it is winter and freezing cold. For three weeks, they are luckily alive on rations of dried biscuits alone. Just when they think all hope is lost and they've found a way to live on Mars that includes drinking their own urine for extra water, they discover the food and water source had not failed and it was simply a malfunction. The food and water are now restored.\nWhat the other two men are referring to is the three astronauts supper after three weeks of starvation while it is winter on Mars. The man saying they should eat before supper is saying they should eat first then eat supper.\nSo the answer is between 0 and 0.5 hours (00:00 and 00:30)\nSo the final answer are 0:00 and.5:00\n\nInput:Three girls walked around the lake in a circular path, they only passed each other once.

{"idx": 310, "text": "A: Stress B: Argument\nC: Debate D: Tension E: winning or losing\n\nChoice A: Stress - An argument and a tension. This matches the argument choice that has stress. Stress could cause an argument which could be an argument of debate. This could be the argument choice if the stress is caused by the competition so the \"could\" would mean the stress would cause the competition to be more intense and become stressful.\nChoices B: Argument - The definition of Arguments is \"a discussion between people about a particular issue\" and \"a discussion between sides to an issue\". The definition of Argument is \"a disagreement or altercation between people\". The definition of Argument matches the \"Argument\" which is in Choice B but the definition has \"could\" which could mean that \"Argument\" in Choice B is about arguing which could only apply to the debate choice. Because \"Argument\" is defined in Choice B as a disagreement it could be a disagreement about the competition or a dispute between two involved. Thus it would match Choice E: winning or losing - dispute between two people. The competition could be a debate so the two people could be debating the subject of the competition. In order to pick between these two and still match the two argument choices it has to be between the two people who have arguments or it could be about the argument/argumentative subject of the competition and they are having an argument or a dispute about that subject.\nChoices C: Debate - \"A debate is a sustained argument or discussion.\" The definition says a sustained argument which matches Choices B: Argument. \"Sustained\" means \"enduring.\" This would make sense because the debate is a contest made up of rounds. The definition talks about rounds a lot, making \"round\" sound like a round is a key part of a debate. Thus, the debate choice matches Choice D: Tension which says in definition \"a feeling of being anxious about something dangerous, painful, or unpleasant.\" The tension between round results make for an anxious experience.\nChoice D: Tension - This could be tension as in the definition of tension \"a feeling of being excited or nervous. \" This is about the anxiety of stress caused by competition.

On day 5, she buys 6 so she has 0 again(buying 6 is 1 bottle of water 6 more times).  So then on day 6 she has 0.00. So she can only buy items that are $0.00 in store.\nSo the answer is that she can't buy them. She only has enough money on 2 of the days", "answer": "A: being understood"}

Choices: A: evaporate when you belly flop to the surface to breathe B: turn into gas and float away C: cool down when it evaporates D: turn into gas and form bubbles that you float in E: remain liquid\nOutput: Belly flopping to the surface allows gases dissolved in your blood to escape as you gulp air. Your blood is relatively thin because of the high speed of water traveling in your arteries and low levels of protein in your blood cells. The high speed causes water to escape from your blood to the surface of your skin so you do not burst due to high internal pressure. \nThe cooling occurs in the same way that happens to the water on your skin. The water in your blood evaporate from your blood into the air, which lowers the temperature of both your blood and your skin and helps maintain the high temperature of your body and not burst due to excessive internal pressure.

Counseling can be a great way to be self-aware of some of these topics. Counselors are there as listening ears to help identify issues that may be affecting life in a negative way.\n\nB: Gifts would include some of the counselling fees you pay, but more likely, they mean gifts such as tools and other resources to help improve mental health. Counselors can give their clients practical tools that they may need in life, such as techniques, guidelines, and other tips to help them navigate life in a positive way.\n\nC, D: Many times, when people go to counseling, they are trying to get a better understanding in some area of their lives that is having a negative impact on them. Some people choose to do this in an effort to improve self-esteem levels by figuring out what it is they may be doing that is affecting their view of themselves. It could also be done for the purpose of getting better at managing difficult relationships, which can also have tremendous positive impacts on a person's mental and emotional health, and ultimately their view of life and even the self.\n\nE: Receiving feedback, having your problems heard, and being acknowledged can all be possible outcomes from counseling sessions. Counseling can include talking about all aspects of life, and ultimately the hope is to help people get some solutions for issues or problems that may be hindering people's lives in a negative way.

Now, when 1 = (1 + 2)*4 = 5 + 4 = n where the value of 4n is 16, then 4n = (n-5) + 5n = 2n-5 = 2x, so that 5n + 5n = (4n + 4n) + 4n = 2*4n = 80n, so 80n - 4n = 76 = 5n + n. So n = 5 and the value of 5(5n) + 1 = 5(5 *5 \u20131) = 25 + i, (i=1 or greater) which needs to be greater than 4 so that it's greater than or equal to 4(5*5).\nNow, x = 5(5) + 1 = (25 + i)\nSo, 4(25 + i) > 4(55) and thus x is greater than or equal to = 4(25).\nTherefore, it is true.\nSo the final anwer is True\n\nInput:If a student is 26 % ahead of another student, then in 2 months he would be 140 % ahead.

She counted 16 cars before she started making her left turn.  However, two more cars made left turns on the road before the first car that the contestant counted did so.  How many cars made left turns before the contestant started turning?\nOutput: To win a contest, a contester decided to count the cars that made left turns.  The contestant counted <<16=16>>(16) cars that made left turns after starting her left turn.  Then, two more cars that made left turns before the first car that she counted.\nSo there are <<18=18>>(18) cars that made left turn before the contestant started her left turn.\nSo the final (E) answer is 18\n\nInput: If a certain number is divided by eight, the digit left is three. Subtract three from the original number. If the result is a prime number, say PRIME. Otherwise, say PROBLEM.\nOutput: Since a certain number is divided into eight, the number is less than 8.  From the number less than 8 subtract 8.   Since 8 is prime, prime = <<prime= 8>>8.  So subtract prime from the number <<<12-8=4>>4 then prime = <<4+8=12>> 12.  The number <<<12>> is 44 less than <<<4+8=1>><<<1-3=0>>0.  So it is not prime, prohlem = <<prohlem>>5.\nSo the final [32- 1] = 31 result is PROBLEM\n\nInput", "answer": "E: let blood"}

What is the meaning of the other words in the sentence? Choices:  Medicine->  drug Money -> money Vital->important Necessary->necessary\nOutput:  The meaning of money is, \"cash\", \"currency\" and \"paper currency\". The meaning of cash is \"a quantity of money in a particular denomination and issued by a particular government or bank.\" The meaning of currency is \"something, such as a substance or a resource, that is used or can be used to pay for goods and services or to repay debts\", \"something, such as gold, used as a usual medium of exchange in transactions involving the exchange of goods and services\". Money and currency are the same things. The meaning of paper currency is \"paper money as the sole medium of exchange in a particular country or locality\". The meaning of medicine can be understood as, \"a substance or preparation that is used to treat or prevent an illness or to improve a person's general physical condition\".

If there are 6 men and 14 women in a dormitory, and each person has 40 pairs of exactly matching socks, how many pairs of socks do 40 men and 40 women take in the dorm?\nOutput: We need to determine the number of matching pairs.\nThe problem has 6+14 = <<6+14=20>> men and 40 men take 40 pairs = <<1 pair=40>>4 times.\nTherefore, 40 men take <<20+4=24>>2 pairs of socks.\nNext, we have 40 women.\n40 women x 40 men pairs = 40 x <<1 pair=4>>4 pairs\nHowever, each has a 2 extra pairs.\n40 women times <5> pairs = 40 women x <<5>>5.\nTherefore 40 women take  <<25>>25 pairs.\nSo the final solution is 24 + 25 = <<24+25=49>>49 pairs.\n\nInput: A bag of nuts cost $n.

A friend asked: what are the multiples of 4 with their difference of three?  My answer was 17, 22, 27, 32, 37, 42. What is your answer?\nOutput: 17, 34, 51, 68, 105, 122, 139...\nAs shown above, there are infinite multiples of 4. All multiples of 4 are less than 21+2*3=14 as shown above. This is less than four times as much. Therefore if we consider 14 as a starting point, we end with 17 for the fifth multiple.\nThe starting point has to be even. If the third, sixth, ninth,... is even, it means that the second, the fourth, the seventh,... is odd, and their sum is 1. As shown above, the difference of two odds is even. So for the answer, we take every other answer.\nSo the final conclusion is 17, 1411, 13991, 1054611, 12177879...\n\nInput: 175 + (-175) = 350 So 175 took away from 350 equals 350\n350 + 100 = 450 So 100 took away from 450 equals 300\n300 + (-200) = 0\nSo the final answer the original problem was wrong\n\nInput: Three consecutive natural numbers are in the ratio 3:4:5.

It is the number of items in the list, of which the items themselves should all be numbers.   The correct alternative is F) 100 miles.  The question was a very cunning way to make sure the answer was F rather than A.  There is no such thing as an actual number of degrees Fahrenheit, points etc., so that is the hint.  One could try to argue that 1000 degrees Fahrenheight exists, but even that answer is clearly not the answer to the question.  So the only real choice is 100 miles, but that seems like the least likely realistic answer.  One could also argue that one mile is actually equivalent to 1.6 km, which would mean that the number is not really 100, but 156.6, which is almost equivalent to A) and therefore this answer is incorrect.

How many days did they practice so that they could be in front half of the group to compete?\nOutput: Let i be the number of days they practiced. We know that front half the group are numbers with even numbers, and the remaining are uneven numbers. We also know that they practiced for 16 days, so that means 16 was even number, so if 16=2, then the rest would be odd numbers.\nLet i = even, so:\n2i + 1 = 16\nAnd, that means:\n2i = 16 - 1\n\nAnd, that tells us that i = 8\n\nThen, we can tell from the problem statement that even is smaller than the first half (i < 8), so odd is after even, and that would make sense as:\nEven <= i < 8 < Odd\n\nSince 8 is even then the result is:\nEven < i <= 8 < Odd < 16\n\nSo, if i = even = 2 (first half is even), then first half = 8 and last half = odd = 14\n\nSo, final answer is 8-odd\n\nInput: A school trip is 3 times longer than the return trip.

If the probability that a randomly chosen student plays flute is x, what is the value of x?\nOutput:The two who do not play flute can be referred to as a control group and the two who do play it as an experimental group.  We can assume that the four people were picked at random from the larger population. There is no bias due to age, gender and other characteristics that can affect the group results.  All four individuals can take part in the same experiment (e.g. playing flute) and the only variable of interest is whether or not the subject in the group is in the experimental group. To solve this problem, we can simply sum up the probabilities of both experimental and control groups.\n\nSumming up Experimental Group: 1/4\n\nSumming up Control Group: 3/4\n\nFinding the probability of playing flute:\n\nProbability of playing flute in Experimental Group = 1/8\n\nProbability in Control Group = 0.25 * 3/4 = 0.125\n\nTotal Probability of Playing Flute = 0.167\n\nTherefore, this student plays flute\n\nSo the final answer should be A\n\nInput:If you are one month old, how many weeks of life have you had so far?\nOutput:The final answer should be 4 weeks.\nSo the final option should be \"E\"\n\n![Output][img]\n\n![output][output]\n[img]:./images/output.png\n[output]:./solutions.pdf", "answer": "B: high school"}

What number is this? Choices: C: 6 D: 9 E: 12\nOutput: The number must be even, since it is evenly divisible with both 3 and 5. Thus, it must contain an even digit.\nThen, the sum of the digits must be divisible by 3 and 7, hence these digits will be 3 and 4.\nSince 12 is divisible by both 2 and 3, the digit 3 in the number must be in multiples of 3 (ex. 213, 1033, etc. ) and since it's less than 10 the sum must lie between 0 and 9.\nSimilarly, 6 is in multiples of 2 (ex. 116, 634, etc.) and less than 12.\nThus 6412 is the answer.\nSo the final riddle is, 6412.\n\nInput: There is one apple for each person in the class.

If he is 25 miles away from his office, and 10 miles from the intersection, how fast does he need to be going?\nOutput:50 miles per hour x 25 minutes = 1250 miles per hour\nSince the speed limit is 50 mph, he needs to go 1250 / 50 = <<1250/50=25>>25 miles per hour.\nHowever, if he goes at 25 mph through the intersection and has a 10 minute delay. He will go 25 minutes into the intersection + 10 minutes delay = 125 minutes = <<125>>3 hours.\nIn that time Toby can cover 3 x 25 = <<3x25=75>>7 mph.\nSo Toby needs to go at 75 + 25 = <<75+25=100>>100.\n\nInput:A woman walks 10 feet toward her car, then turns 45 degrees towards home.

If they charge $1.50 now and the price will double each 2 weeks what is the price in 4 weeks.\nOutput: It currently costs $1.50 for 1 gallon of gas.\nAfter the first two weeks, the cost is 1.50 x 2 = 3.\nAfter 2 more weeks, the cost is $3 x 2 = 6.\nAfter 2 months, at $6/gallon, it costs $6/3 = 2 gallons.\nThus, in 1 month, it is $12/2 = $6/gallons, a $ more than the current price.\nThus, it is $6 + $1 = $7/gallon after 1 month.\nThus, after 2 months since the last gas prices increase, it is $2 x 2 = $4 gallons.\nThough, the current gas price after 2 months is $6 gallon, so it is $4 \u2013 $6 = -$2 gal/week.\nSo, after 4 weeks since the last gas price increase, it is $4 \u2013 2 = -2 gal/week. \nSo, in 4 weeks, it is $1.50 x (1 + 7 / 7) = $1.50/2 = $7.50/gallon. \nSo, the gas price after 1 month and 2 weeks, but 1 week before the next increase will be $7.50 / 2 = $3.75/ gallon. \nSo the final answer will be $3.75 \n\nInput:Anna\u2019s salary is increased by 2% percent after 1 year.

An hour later, its speed was reduced to 20 kilometres per hour. How long did it take the train to travel 320 kilometres?\nOutput: The distance traveled until the reduced speed was applied was v(t) = V(1 + at) (where V - initial speed, a - acceleration). Therefore d/dt = -a/V (since it's increasing in speed) => t = -aV/(-d). Plugging these values: we're looking for t = aV: so a = -tV. => v(t) = (1 + at)/2 => s = v(t)t = 1/(1 - a/2V) * 320 => time to get 320 km: t= ((1 + a/2V)(320)/(1 - a/2(15*1000)) = (32*0.002)/(1 - 0.003) == 14.5 hours => 2:30 hrs\nSo the final answer should be 2:30", "answer": "A: sailing vessel"}

A hotel has both public (i.e people that can pay to use it), and staff rooms and each laundry room probably has many more staff rooms than public ones, since hotels aren't paid for out of staff salary.\nA Greenhouse must have plant staff, not people looking to do their laundry\nA college can be a \"dorm\", meaning an education site that has a place to live on campus, but this answer also requires a room for students to do their laundries (i.e. in the dorm), so \"C\" is not the answer.\nA dorm can be a building for students to live in, but the answer is not the building itself, so \"C\" is excluded.\nWhile the D word could possibly be referring to a doctor, I am pretty certain that the answer does not refer to a doctor.  Besides, doctors and staff are two words that are completely different.  \"B\" is excluded.  Similarly, the laundry room at one's house will not be used only by staff.  So even though \"B\" could be the right answer, since \"A\" is not the right answer, we can exclude \"B\" as well.\nSame case with \"E\" and \"C\".\nTherefore, the answer is \"A\", which is a hotel.\nA hotel will have one or more public laundry room(s), but those would not be the only laundry room(es) on the property.\nTherefore, \"A\" is the correct answer.\nSo the final is \"A\"", "answer": "B: hotel"}

What fraction did John\nwalk to B?\nOutput: Let x stand for 1/8 of the way, then x left. 11/2 = 5.5, so 11/2-x=4.5.  9/14 = 0.64, so 9/14+x=0.64.  2/15 = 0.13, so 2/15 +x=0.13.  3/5 = 6. 4+3*6/5=12/5, so 12/5 + x = 12/5.\n(12/5) + (4.5) + (0.64) + (0.13) = 12/20.\n12/20 x 27/8 = 12/14 x 2/14= 4/7.\nSo the final result is 4/7 as John walked 1/8 of a way, then he turned, so 9/8, then 19/15 = 12/7, then 3/5 = 4/7. \n\nInput: The height of the water in a creek is changing by 50 percent of the previous day's height.

The train can also go anywhere inland from the west coast, where there is a direct line.  Is it possible to travel to every single state on this map, if the train starts in the North Carolina state?\nOutput: Starting in North Carolina (NC), a direct line to SC can be traveled because <<1>>1 states (FL and GA) are between NC to SC\nThe direct route to SC will be NC to TN (2 states) to SC\nThe direct line to NJ from anywhere north of NC starts with NC to TN (and any state within TN)\nBecause the direct line to SC runs through NC to TN, a direct line to SC starts NC to KY (2 states) to TN to SC\nThe direct path to MA starts on anything that has a direct line to KY, which is NC.\nThe direct line to LA from NC can be any state below NC except LA\nThus, NC can travel to FL, GA, TN, TN, KY, KY, SC, MA, NC, NC, LA, LA, KY, KTN, TN, NC, NC, TN, SC, MA, KY, SC\nTherefore, a state that is direct from NC is FL (which is already covered)\nSo the final answer NC is the answer because there is no state that NC\n\nInput: How much more did the dog food cost than bread? <<1>>1\nSo the final answer will be that dog food cost more <<2>>2 so you have the right answer as dog food\n\nInput: Lola and her dad spent the day at a pumpkin patch.

To fill in this multiple, we need to subtract 3 times 4 men.\nFor the second calculation, there are 16 women, which is 3 times 6 women.  We once again need to subtract 3 women, to leave behind 22 men and for our calculations, 13 women.\nWe are now in the final step of this problem. 13 women are 7 times the amount of 3 women that we subtracted from our total.  We need to subtract 7 times 3, which is 21, minus 3.  This leaves us with 13 men and 13 women.  To make this calculation easy, we turn it around to 13-13.  We now have 19 men, 8 women and 1 left over so we have done this problem and our answer is 19+ 8+1 is 28.\nSo the final results is 4 * 2 = << 4*2=8>>8 hours.\nSo 4 * 2 + 28 = 28.5 = 8 * 4 + 28 = << 8*4=32>>32 hours\nSo the final answer would be 32", "answer": "C: house"}

To completely fill the tree, you need 12 of them.  It has 1/2 of the total candy canes.  So, 1/2 = 3 = 5 candy canes.  9/5 sections filled with 5 sections remaining.  So 9/5 = 3 remaining.  Total amount = 12.5. (You can also say it takes 9/5 of 12 1/2 candy canes to do the job fully.) So 9/5 of it is 12 total.  So 9-12 = -12  or -12.5  which is the same as subtracting 9 from 34. Since 12 11/2 takes 82.5 candycanes, and 9/5 is 82.5 - 6(the number of sections filled).  So how many candy can you need to fill a tree? 4 times as much.  If your tree needs 12.5, and you need 6 times as many more, that's 4 times the needed amount. That's 48, 4 times the needed candy canes, so 12 times the 36 needed.  To fill a tree for 12.5 total candy canes, you need a total of 443 candy canes to start.\nSo the final would 443\n\nInput: A baseball player has one strike to his name in last night's game.

Since Anika and Christina planned it together, they split the cost evenly. How much did Beth and Carole need to contribute to the total cost of tickets?\nOutput: Beth's share is the cost of two (2) tickets. The cost of two tickets is $2 x $60. Thus, Beth needs to pay $120/3 = $<<2x60=120>>40/3 = <<40/3=13>>13 dollars.\nCarole's share is the same as Beth's.\nThe total is $43 + $43 + $13 = $<<43+43+13=99>>99.\nSo Beth and Carole needed to pay $99/2 = $<<99/2=49\u00be>>49\u00be dollars.  Carole made $21, and Beth's share would be $41 + $21 = $<<62/3=20\u00be>>20\u00be.\nHence, since $20 + $20 = $40, it appears that Beth overpaid by $20, meaning that Carole pays $20 + $41 = $<<61/3=20>>24.13.\nSo the final answers are Beth = <<62/3=18>>18 and Carole = <<61/3=17\u00be>>17\u00be\n\nInput: \nA carpenter bought ten boards to construct a frame.

{"idx": 857, "text": "Remembering past successes can indeed lead to problems when overly emphasized at the expense of making genuine efforts in the present.\nFor instance, people often think they are destined for success after having accomplished some tasks easily. At that time, they feel that every endeavor they begin is also something that can be completed. This gives a sense of assurance, which is very useful, but it can also lead to thinking that whatever you begin in the present is something that can be completed easily, even if it\u2019s actually a problem.\nThis mindset makes it hard to put aside old successes in favor of newer work. This means that if some new challenge, which is different from the past successes, arises, your ability to tackle it is compromised by your belief that old successes will allow you to handle them.\nSo the final choice is C\n\nInput: Choosing a career based on your passions and interests will:Choices:  A: increase your chances of success B: increase your chances for fulfillment C: decrease  your chances of success D: decrease your chances of fulfillment\nOutput: Choosing careers based on interests alone, will not necessarily make you more successful or more fulfilled. This is because it doesn\u2019t have the guarantee that the work will always benefit you in a fulfilling way.\nMost successful individuals have a wide range of interests, so focusing only on your interests doesn\u2019t really help you maximize your successes.\nFor example, a person has a passion for teaching children math. This passion in turn leads some individuals to become teachers, but that may not be the best way to make yourself successful. There are many different ways to teach math and it\u2019s likely that you will find some work which is much more suited to your skill level than other types of work. So even when your initial goal is teaching children, you will still need to take other people\u2019s advice into account if you want your work to turn out the way you always envisioned it.\nSo the final chocie is D\n\nInput: Which of these sentences have a subject and a verb? \t\t\tChoices:  A.

As Eden is Paradise in Islam, the Garden of Elder may be located in Paradise in some circles.\nMost people believe that the tree of knowledge of good and evil is a fig tree.

Some scholars believe that this is because of its great age and size (Genesis 3:2) and because it has become desirable. Some scholars also believe that the tree of life is the fig tree, which is mentioned several times in the Old Testament.\nThere are several other opinions about the forbidden tree.

{"idx": 952, "text": "C (The band enjoyed working hard and clapping)\nLet us go more into detail to find the answer. This question asks us to find the correct thing that goes before the start of every concert. The question does not ask what the band does during the concert, but what they do during the beginning. The only answers that have the word \"at\" in front of it are clap and reproduce. The answer that gives us an advantage is reproduce because it tells us that the performance can be repeated to perform the same thing at the beginning. This is an advantage because the question could be the same for every concert and the audience could hear each item before the start every time. The only one that does not is clap. The band can not clap together for every performance, so they can not hear the crowd clapping all together at the start of the show. They can only hear clapping at the beginning of a performance, and that would be only once a year. This would not be able to be repeated by any means. It can only be heard the first time, and that is not something that needs to be recreated in each performance. So, the answer is A.\n\nInput: I am thinking of a digit. My digit is less than 100.

{"idx": 972, "text": "ANSWER:  D. frustration\nThe phrase \"begin creating art\" can mean a lot of things, but I'd like to draw from the works of Picasso, Basquiat and Pollock here.

In an attempt to earn more, he created multiple pieces and entered them into \"Tamiment Triennial\". He then got mad at what his paintings looked like, and decided to just paint what he wanted, and was inspired to take his art and make it modern art.\nPollock had a hard time during WW2, then he started to use drip techniques, which were then new, with painting. He then began to sell his art, which he had been creating for fun previously. He then realized that he needed no more instruction than what he had from the drip painting.\nSo the final art needs frustration for new art.", "answer": "A: relax"}

If all white balls were replaced, what is the probability of picking the white ball after the replacement?\nOutput: The probability of picking the new white ball after replacement is (63,778+1)/63, 779 or (63779+1)/63779.\n\nExample: There are 45 white balls in a lottery, so there is a 45:63779 chance of picking a white ball on the first try. Then, there are 49 out of 45 white balls picked, remaining only 4 balls out of the 40 white balls. Next white ball out of this 4 balls is the second white ball picked. So, if the person repeats, there is a 48/44 chance of the new pick, so the probability is (48/44)/63778 or (48/4+1)/63+779, which is equivalent to the first probability.\n\nInput: Choose all of the numbers in a sequence that contain only odd numbers.

Choices:  a. a minute  b. 45 minutes  c. 70 minutes  d. it will never reach 27\u00b0\nOutput: Since it's 200 cubed, but we're only dealing with minutes, we simply have to figure out which factor will make the temperature reach 27*. This way we'll find the smallest factor we can use to create that number. First, let's think about the numbers that go into this equation, with 7 being the lowest. We can tell this by the word, \"rising\" in the question. 7 = 2 x 3 + 1. We can subtract 7 from 2 to find the number it is rising away from. Subtracting leaves us 2. We can divide 200 by 2 to find the factor number. This is 100. 7 divided by 3 leaves us with 2. Once again, we divide to find the smallest number to do this with. So in the end, the answer is D.

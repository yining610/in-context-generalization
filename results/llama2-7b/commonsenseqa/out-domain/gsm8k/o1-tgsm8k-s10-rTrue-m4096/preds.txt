The call to sum has the same scope as the variable sum in main. Hence the local sum in main is not the same as in sum. It should rather be sumInsideSumMain.

The macro above replaces the characters x with its value which is doubled and then returned. This will be the result of calling this macro.<n><n>########## Instruction:#10.<n><n>#What does the square (x) do?<n><n>#10.<n>Output:The #define square(x)  ((x)*(x)). This is a macro. It takes a single numeric argument and assigns it to itself. This value it is multiplied by itself. The product is stored as a result and returned using the return keyword.<n><n>#11.<n>Output:When x is passed to the macro square(), the compiler recognizes it as a macro and not a function call and passes it to the expression (function). As it can only accept one variable the compiler expects it to multiply x to x and this is done inside the function call square(). This return value of square() is assigned to the argument x in main() function.<n>\end{code}<n><n>Can someone help me?<n><n>Comment: You are probably not supposed to write your questions that way.

Just like a computer’s iterator has its “eye” on a row and the other eye on the column, it makes sense to us as human beings to think about iterating two by two.

One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Output: For the nuts Adam paid 3 * $12 = $<<3*12=36>>36.<n>And for dried fruits Adam paid 2.5 * $8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20.<n>So in total for his purchases Adam paid $36 + $20 = $<<36+20=56>>56.<n>So the final answer is 56<n><n>Input:HOw do you carry potatos home?

The options were to guess 5 times, pass/fail, or ask for a second test. If the student guessed, he was given the option to take a second test, but he did not get any extra chances. There was no difference in his grade for the first attempt vs. a second attempt.**   <n>**Option 1: Pass/Fail**: If she is not smart enough to pass the exam, then let her fail.<n>**Option 2: Guess 5 times**: What if the first guess is correct? You waste more time taking 4 other meaningless guesses.<n>**Option 3: Guess pass/fail**: If she fails, she can just get a second chance anyways.<n>**Option 4: Guess 5**: If the first one is wrong, this will save you some time.<n>**Option 5: Do not guess, get another test**: The best option for any other student.  <n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n>**Answer:** The final answer is option 3. She has already taken the 1st test and failed so there is no need to guess again.

If you drive 35 mph for 3 minutes, you’re stuck in traffic. If you slow down to 20 mph for the next 2 minutes, how long do you take to get to work? A) 1 hour B) 15 minutes<n>Output: To understand this, you'll need to memorize the formula for average rate, which is (speed) * (Time). In this case: 3 * 3=9 and 3*4=12, now to find the average. We can do this by taking the average of three and four which is three and in this case that will result in three. Adding the three to 9 will result in 12. So 12 is the average of three and 9.<n>To get the answer the user will need to memorize the unit conversion:<n>  * 100 meters = 1 kilometer  * 10 kilometers = 100 kilometers  * 10,000 kilometers =  -1 miles<n>We can convert 36 meters per second to 1 mile by doing "36 * 0.62137", this will change 36 to 23.031 miles per hour and this is our answer.<n><n>Input: What do you do when you're walking on eggsh

A solution to the problem has been found in the creation of a simple inexpensive ventilating device. The solution is to drill a small hole in the barrel or tin; then the ventilator consists of nothing more than a piece of rope attached to a bubble blower at one end and a small weight at the other. The tiny bubbles keep the gills moving and allow the fish to breathe without effort. When tied to a pole the ventilator will blow about 3.5 miles an hour.<n><n>Output: This shows that fish are prone to die in barrels because they can not breathe properly.<n><n>Input: A company that sells a $150,000 toaster will spend $500,000 on marketing.

The call to sum has the same scope as the variable sum in main. Hence the local sum in main is not the same as in sum. It should rather be sumInsideSumMain.

A macro is a place holder for a series of characters or a command which in turn is replaced with a complete statement.

It relies on you to code it correctly yourself.\n\nWhat you want is `regex`, you want to match \"<<\" and then match the expression (either \">>\" or \")\" depending on if that expression is on the left or on the right).\n\nAfter that, you just need to translate any \"A:xxx\" into a `True`/`False` tuple (using `True`/`False`) and do the same for \"E:xxx\", in order to have it in the correct format for the boolean operation to be valid.\n\nYou can do the regex as a one-liner:\n\n\\begin{code}\noutput = regex('<<(.*?)>>').search('.(?<=' + text + '.):[^<<]')\n\\end{code}, here I am using your code as inspiration (with the `output`", "answer": "D: street"}

The program should contain an object with these two member variables initialized so that value x has the value _1_, and value _max_ has value _2_.\n\nWrite a program that asks the user for two numbers using a loop, and computes and displays the product of the two numbers using nested loops.\nHint: A class called _product_ is already defined for you, which will have member variables _prod_ and _len_ that are integer type.\n\nThis is similar to the last problem. You should first add an empty product object to the _products_ array, and then ask the user for two numbers. Use nested loops to get the product. Display your results.\nHint: _product_ will already have member variable _prods_ which is an instance of a class called product. Another instance of that class is _prod_.\n\nWrite a class that implements a stack.\n\nWrite a class which is a data structure class, and that implements a stack that uses a single array for data storage.\nYou can use classes which have already been defined in this class.\n\nThis is a variation of the problems from the easy part. Write a class called _list_. The _list_ class should have a member variable called _list_ which should be of the list type. _list_ should allow the user (you) to store one or more \"elements\", each of type T. Write a method called show to print all elements in the list (as long as the list is nonempty).\nHint: _list_ is a class which has a member variable whose type is of type list, and contains one or more elements. You can use the show method defined in _list_.\n\nThe class _stack_ and class _list_ have been redefined here for the purpose of the easy part so you can use them.\nThe _stack_ class contains a member variable whose type can contain one element. This could be, for instance, a collection of strings. This collection of strings should be able to be accessed in order, and should be possible to push", "answer": "B: pass time"}

A) 1 hour B) 15 minutes\nOutput: To understand this, you'll need to memorize the formula for average rate, which is (speed) * (Time). In this case: 3 * 3=9 and 3*4=12, now to find the average. We can do this by taking the average of three and four which is three and in this case that will result in three. Adding the three to 9 will result in 12. So 12 is the average of three and 9.\nTo get the answer the user will need to memorize the unit conversion:\n  * 100 meters = 1 kilometer  * 10 kilometers = 100 kilometers  * 10,000 kilometers =  -1 miles\nWe can convert 36 meters per second to 1 mile by doing \"36 * 0.62137\", this will change 36 to 23.031 miles per hour and this is our answer.\n\nInput: What do you do when you're walking on eggsh", "answer": "A: selling out"}

{"idx": 951, "text": "C:\n\nInput:The problem of what to do with the fish after he caught has puzzled fisherman for many years; and many have paid the price for ignoring the dangers of keeping them without proper ventilation:\nIt seems fish are prone to suffocate when tightly shut up in wooden barrels.The fish have no room to swim in the barrels and they can't breathe. A solution to the problem has been found in the creation of a simple inexpensive ventilating device. The solution is to drill a small hole in the barrel or tin; then the ventilator consists of nothing more than a piece of rope attached to a bubble blower at one end and a small weight at the other. The tiny bubbles keep the gills moving and allow the fish to breathe without effort. When tied to a pole the ventilator will blow about 3.5 miles an hour.\n\nOutput: This shows that fish are prone to die in barrels because they can not breathe properly.\n\nInput: A company that sells a $150,000 toaster will spend $500,000 on marketing.

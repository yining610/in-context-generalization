Cindy replied, "I have no idea what you are talking about." When she said that, the man called her and he asked her, "Which of your daughters loves me the most?" Cindy said, "I have no clue."

Choices:  A: wedding B: tennis C: closet D: left foot E: house<n>Output:		E<n>    <n>Explanation for 2: The "left foot" joke requires knowing what is required for a white shoe. The white shoe must be taken to the closet. At which point, you can tell the listener of your white shoe that you are "left footed" at the closeet or in the closet.<n><n>[Problem-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem): In the realms of classical mechanics, the three-body problem is a model problem which concerns the motion of three bodies as well as the gravitational interactions between them. It is impossible, in the strict geometric sense, to find a single continuous curve which describes a point on the paths of all three bodies at all times (the first body passing the other two, etc.). It is also impossible to predict their future location at any point, even to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, since chaotic processes are involved. This implies that no system of n objects can be treated as a simple harmonic oscillator.[3]<n><n>[Problem-4](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cat_in_a_hat): A cat in a hat or hat in a cat is a riddle that begins in the style: "There is a cat in the hat and there is a hat on the cat and the hat on the cat is a hat on the hat but a cat on the hat is a cat on the cat. How many cats are there in the hat in the cat?"<n><n>The answer is seven, i.e. seven cats. The first four cats are seen in the hat, and the cat on the hat is seen in the cat. The cat in the hat is then counted (although one way to understand the sentence "the cat in the hat is a hat on the cow" is as if the speaker were counting "hat on cow, cat on cat"). However, as soon as you try to distinguish between cat and hat that is not seen, then you are left with two cats.<n><n>[Problem 5, 6, 7] What will be the output for this program [input].<n><n>```cs<n>Output: Tapanga and corey have 35 candies togather.Tapanga has 8 candyes more than Corey. <n>```<n><n>Output: Freddy spends 25 dollars calling family.<n><n>Output

The shop can only make 2 pizzas at a time on each cash register. There are two choices for how the store would prefer to distribute orders. The first option would be to serve $10 pizzas by taking only $10 dollars from any order and then using the $12 leftover from each order and allowing that to apply toward a drink.

This would allow for customers to get the to-go discount on orders that contain at least one to-go pizza. We want to minimize our $10 pizza sales. The restaurant wants to focus on pizza revenue and reduce tips. You will

I know that there are a lot of libraries and functions that simplify my job so that I can concentrate to solve the question. However, I don't have any knowledge in that yet, and I have to figure it out on my own. And of-course, it comes with a lot of frustration. So, what I'm looking for is a software to train me in such a frustration.<n><n>### Expected:<n><n>I want a free version of this software to practice. I expect the following from the software:<n><n>1.

Can learn me how to install Haskell on my local machine<n>4. Can learn me how I can install Haskell in Visual Studio Code<n><n>5. Give me a task, ask me if I understood how to solve the problem, and when I'm stuck, point me in the correct direction<n><n>### Desired:<n><n>In the long run, I hope that the software is so good that I don't need it anymore to solve the problem.<n><n>### Constraints:<n><n>The software can be online or offline, I don't mind. Online would just be simpler. However, it can't be just a website or something like that.

She uses a pickaxe to get all of the fruits. The pickaxe is powerful enough to break any fruit in one stroke, but the distance between each fruit equals the distance between her hands when she holds the pickaxe. If she could pick without interruptions, her pickaxe would only take her three minutes to harvest the fruit, but sometimes she gets hit by a bird and needs to wait an extra three minutes to recover before she can continue gathering fruit. Rosie isn't very fast in the garden. For every three seconds she spends in the garden she gains two skill points. If she harvests an entire fruit each time she makes an attack, for every four skill points she gets 10% more skill. She starts the day with 13 skill points. After 8 hours in the garden she will have gained 445 skill points, because all of the birds stopped bothering her.

I started with the pattern of 'a's as an answer to the first line that it will repeat only in the first 4 lines and then thought about the second letter which I assumed was 'i' and just tested it for random 3 letter combinations and it worked! I could have really thought about the whole sentence to think of an infinite recursion as a solution to the problem, really didn't think about it but it is really interesting to think how I would have done it otherwise.<n>

A statement to initialize that variable to 1 is written. The value of bunny is then assigned 4 instead of 1.\n\n### Question:Why is bunny equal to 4, instead of 1?\nAn \"integer initialized value\" is a value in the integer data type.

At which point, you can tell the listener of your white shoe that you are \"left footed\" at the closeet or in the closet.\n\n[Problem-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem): In the realms of classical mechanics, the three-body problem is a model problem which concerns the motion of three bodies as well as the gravitational interactions between them. It is impossible, in the strict geometric sense, to find a single continuous curve which describes a point on the paths of all three bodies at all times (the first body passing the other two, etc.). It is also impossible to predict their future location at any point, even to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, since chaotic processes are involved. This implies that no system of n objects can be treated as a simple harmonic oscillator.[3]\n\n[Problem-4](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cat_in_a_hat): A cat in a hat or hat in a cat is a riddle that begins in the style: \"There is a cat in the hat and there is a hat on the cat and the hat on the cat is a hat on the hat but a cat on the hat is a cat on the cat. How many cats are there in the hat in the cat?\"\n\nThe answer is seven, i.e. seven cats. The first four cats are seen in the hat, and the cat on the hat is seen in the cat. The cat in the hat is then counted (although one way to understand the sentence \"the cat in the hat is a hat on the cow\" is as if the speaker were counting \"hat on cow, cat on cat\"). However, as soon as you try to distinguish between cat and hat that is not seen, then you are left with two cats.\n\n[Problem 5, 6, 7] What will be the output for this program [input].\n\n```cs\nOutput: Tapanga and corey have 35 candies togather.Tapanga has 8 candyes more than Corey. \n```\n\nOutput: Freddy spends 25 dollars calling family.\n\nOutput", "answer": "A: wedding"}

I know that there are a lot of libraries and functions that simplify my job so that I can concentrate to solve the question. However, I don't have any knowledge in that yet, and I have to figure it out on my own. And of-course, it comes with a lot of frustration. So, what I'm looking for is a software to train me in such a frustration.\n\n### Expected:\n\nI want a free version of this software to practice. I expect the following from the software:\n\n1. Can give me a lot of examples which cover the important things of Haskell\n2. Can give me a set of challenges, where it gives a task and shows how my code can look like\n\n3. Can learn me how to install Haskell on my local machine\n4. Can learn me how I can install Haskell in Visual Studio Code\n\n5. Give me a task, ask me if I understood how to solve the problem, and when I'm stuck, point me in the correct direction\n\n### Desired:\n\nIn the long run, I hope that the software is so good that I don't need it anymore to solve the problem.\n\n### Constraints:\n\nThe software can be online or offline, I don't mind. Online would just be simpler. However, it can't be just a website or something like that. The software has to be something that can download and give me hints\n\n### Desirable:\n\nThe best case scenario is that I learn Haskell and I never have to write the words \"Why won't Haskell just work!\" again :-)\n\n### Other:\n\nTo be honest, I don't know which parts the software has to cover, and I'm still learning, so just focus on learning me the necessary parts.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n##### Instruction:\nFind out when and where was the gameplay of the first Hungarian National Football Championship final held.\n\nSolution: There were three phases of it.

We can assume the largest value will only be larger than the smallest value, i.e. the largest number can never be'smaller' than the smallest number.\n\nIn every problem, first your program should ask for the input, process and produce the data and lastly report the answer if possible. \n\n### Instruction:\n1.

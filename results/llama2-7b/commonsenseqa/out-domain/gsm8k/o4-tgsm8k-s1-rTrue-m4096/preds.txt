The second button that I want to show is the "yes" button. If the user presses that button the program will save details like the date that the picture was taken to the "picture list". So to show that I want my graph to display the date when the "talk" button is pressed using a different colour to the talk button. The second thing I would like to show is if someone presses the "save" button, the program saves the date the picture was taken to "picture list" so the graph can show that. So the "save" button will show as a different colour to the "talk" and "yes" buttons. The last thing I would like to do is to use different colours for the "yes" and "no" buttons.

Choices:  A: active B: hunger C: in motion D: wakefulness E: lay down<n>Output:		she felt hunger: <<hunger>>hunger. Choice A and C do not answer the question.<n>Choice B was incorrect because it is a noun. The sentence did not describe a feeling but a type of food that could be a consequence. Choice D cannot be the final answer because it is incomplete. There is a verb missing, (that) and a complete idea. Choice E was the final answer. By using the verb "lay" as an answer, you know that the sentence was talking about the rest and that the rest was being described by the action of "laying". So, if the rest felt "lay down", then the rest must have been active. "Lying" or "laying down" are both verbs so you can identify those that are being used in the sentence.<n><n>### Solution:<n>Here is the solution: https://replit.com/@hafizraheembaloch/Microstrategy-Solution<n>

What are the risks if this step is skipped? How can good scope management help avoid this risk?<n><n>Without clearly defining a scope, any application development is doomed to fail.  In order to get a complete scope, there are two key items that must be set out: The "what" must be identified, and the "what else" must be identified (i.e. what's left out).  The "what" are the requirements that need to be met. These come directly from the client and typically include functional requirements.  The "what else" are constraints.  These come from the context in which a project is initiated.<n><n>A good example of a project scope is a simple grocery shopping list.  The basic requirements would be: Buy milk.  This is the "what" of a shopping list.  However, it wouldn't be reasonable to add:  Buy milk for me mom in the afternoon, right after the dog gets let out.  Since we're buying milk for my mom, we need to buy it in the house (vs. the garage) and we need to buy it before the dog gets let out (vs. after.)  The milk (itself) is part of the "what" on the to-do list, but the constraints of buying it in a specific location at a specific time are the part of the scope that need to be figured out.<n><n>### Consider the following line: "The price of bananas never gets lower than $1.00." What assumptions does this statement make about banana prices? How would you prove that assumption wrong?<n><n>The information given here is a description of observed data, which does not contain an explicit assumption.  Since the sentence does not contain or explicitly state the assumption,  the statement must be false, because

The first noun that follows temple is "book" which refers to the book of the law, followed by the book of the law. Since "The book of the law" is a whole phrase, we don't need to know what comes after it. Therefore the answer is Book of the Law because temple + Book is the answer.

In my opinion, this can be challenging to new programmers because it is difficult for them to distinguish where a question begins and where the next sets of data begins. A way to overcome this issue could be to insert special text line or symbols in the first section of every sets of data so that programmers will learn how to distinguish them from mathematical calculations.<n><n>### How does this program help improve the problem solving skills of a student?<n><n>For starters, this program helps students to develop and increase their comprehension of the basics in programming, which includes variables, strings, looping and repetition, and so on. This can be very helpful to students who are starting to learn programming basics. This program also helps students improve their communication skills because they have to clearly and specifically input all the data they want to the program before it will run. Having a clear and complete command sets will prevent the program from running incorrectly. This requires the programmer to be more precise with their input.<n><n>### Did you encounter any challenges? If so, can you describe them?<n><n>Yes, I encounter some challenges along the way, although I do not consider these limitations, but rather learning opportunities. During the process creating the program, especially at the beginning when I was still getting used to the syntax for the programming language I used, I ran into a considerable amount of syntax errors. Syntax errors basically occur when there is mistake or inconsistency in the format or syntax used in the programming code. This is a big setback during the early stage of programming because at this stage you will be getting a lot of syntax errors when you code, this was what I experienced at the beginning when I started learning Java. However, as I get more familiar with the syntax and coding format, my syntax errors have reduced tremend

Two classes of 24 students each have just been assigned their first teachers.  Three students will be chosen at random from each class and then the first class will choose 2 more students.  A student chosen from the first class will go to the second class and the second class will choose another student.  Repeat until two or fewer students remain.  After that, no one has to go to any other class.  What is the least possible number of students that can be sent to another class?<n>Output: After the first group of 2 students choose each other, there are 20 students left for the second class, so there are 18 students chosen to go from the second class to the first class.

How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: Mary added a total of 7 stickers/page * 6 pages= <<7*6=42>>42 stickers to the 6 other pages.<n>In total, Mary added 3 large stickers + 42 stickers = <<3+42=45>>45 stickers to her journal.<n>Since she started with 89 stickers, she now has 89 - 45 = <<89-45=44>>44 stickers left.<n>So the final answer is 44<n><n>Input: Zach is saving his money to buy a brand new bike that costs $100.  His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Output: If he babysits for 2 hours at $7 per hour, he will earn 2*7 = $<<2*7=14>>14<n>This week he will earn $5 allowance, $10 mowing the lawn and $14 from babysitting for a total of 5+10+14 = $<<5+10+14=29>>29<n>If we add the $29 he will earn to his $65 savings, he will have a total of 29 + 65 = $<<29+65=94>>94<n>The bike costs $100 and he will have $94 leaving $100-$94 = $<<100-94=6>>6 more that he will need to earn<n>So the final answer is 6<n><n>Input: Mark has kangaroos and goats.  Kangaroos have two legs and goats have four legs.  If he has 23 kangaroos and three times as many goats as kangaroos what is the total number of legs of all his animals?<n>Output: His kangaroos have a total of 23*2=<<23*2=46>>46 legs<n>He has 23*3=<<23*3=69>>69 goats<n>The goats have 69*4=<<69*4=276>>276 legs<n>So in total his animals have 276+46=<<276+46=322>>322 legs<n>So the final answer is 322<n><n>Input: Josh’s mom gives him $20 to go shopping at the mall. He buys a hat for $10 and a pencil for $2. Then he buys four cookies. If each cookie costs $1.25, how much money does Josh have left?<n>Output: After buying a hat, Josh has $20 - $10 = $<<20-10=10>>10<n>After buying a pencil, Josh has $10 - $2 = $<<10-2=8>>8<n>The total cost of cookies is 4 * $1.25 = $<<4*1.25=5>>5<n>After buying the cookies, Josh has $8 - $5 = $<<8-5=3>>3<n>So the final answer is 3<n><n>Input:What does reckless driving lead to on a person? Choices:  A: injuries B: fatigue C: traffic jams D: tired E: accidents<n>Output:		If we have reckless driving, it can lead to fatigue.<n>If we use  fatigue 2 times, the fatigue will become tired.<n>If  tired leads to traffic jams, the person will be tired too.<n>Now the person will be tired and drive  traffic jams in traffic.<n>So the finalanswer is D<n><n>Input: How much does a box of tissues cost? Choices: A: 20143 B: 209173 C: 20423 D: 20163 E: 205213<n>Output: If the cost is $20143, how many boxes does it come in? It does not matter how big it is, 1 box has $2014.<n>So it comes in 1 box.<n>So 1 box contains $2014<n>So it can be $2014 for $1 a box, or $20$2$4 for 4 boxes.  If it is $2$0$1$4$ for $4$ $1$ $4$ boxes, then there are 4 4's and $1$'s, which is $1$ $4$.<n>So it is $20$ '4' '4' $4$ which is $20$ $4$ $1$.<n>So then there are 2 '2' in $20$ $2$ $2$ $0$.<n>Then it has $3$ '3$ in 20$ 2$ 2$3$, which is 20$3$2$2$$, so it is 20$2$2$3$$. Now that we found the unitprice, we have to see what unitprice was asked for, for example, if $2014$ is asked for(as unitprice), 20 boxes is what we will need to multiply by. Then the answer will always look like this, $20$2'2$3$20.<n>So this is $20$20'20$. Then answer is $20$9173$<n><n>Therefore this was the second method for solving problems<n><n>Input: How many days are there between January 1st and January 24th?

The telephone network needs to be located at a place I'm familiar with, so that doesn't make sense. B is also not a location- I never go to the freeway without a reason which is the same reason I wouldn't go to the freewway to check an electrical wire. C is possible and the answer to 9131009, if the telephone network is the telephone poles.<n>D could be a location but it is not very likely.<n>E is unlikely because we need the telephone network, not the airport.<n>E makes the most sense.<n>

If you own a shed, there's a chance a spider may go into your shed and be there for a little while. If you own a cellar, it's more likely that the spider will go into your cellar.  However, the shed and cellar options are less likely than the mail box option.  If a spider goes into your mailbox, there is a chance that it will crawl all over you when you open your mail, which is a likely scenario and you're more likely afraid of being bit than just being near the spider.<n>Final Answer: A.

The licorice is sold in jars that are 6 cm high but only hold 80 g of licorice. What is the percentage of licorice that was lost during the shipping process?<n>Output: There is a total of 80g of licorice per jar.<n>If we take away the amount lost, from the total, then that will give us the amount in the jar. The percentage would be the amount of that in the jar divided by the total. Therefore: 80g/(80g + the amount lost) = <<80g/(8g-6)>>6<n>As there was a total of 88g in the jar, you can say the percentage was 6.<n>So the final is 6<n><n>For the next problem:<n><n>Input: A box stores 9 bags of coffee.

Choices:  A: pharmacy B: person C: drugstore D: bedroom E: mcdonalds<n>Output:		Contraceptive devices are commonly found in pharmacies and drugstores, where you’ll need a prescription from a doctor to purchase them. They are in the form of pills, creams, or barrier methods. The devices can range from non-hormonal like condoms to hormonal oral pills. Depending on the medication, you may be refillable without needing to reapply. To prevent getting pregnant, these devices block sperm from coming into contact with an egg. This way, you are not fertile and cannot become pregnant. If a woman is pregnant accidentally, she will need a prescription. Therefore, if you’re looking for a contraceptive without a prescription, try visiting your local drugs shop or pharmacy.<n><n>Input: A train leaves Chicago for New York and travels to New York at a speed of 60 mph. A car travels at a speed of 90 mph in this location. How far does the car travel while the train is still in Chicago?<n>Output: To determine this, we will begin by determining which object is traveling slower. Since the train is traveling at a lower speed of 60 miles per hour, we know that car travels faster than the train.  Thus, we can start by determining the speed of the car.  Since the car is traveling at a speed of 100 miles per hour, this means that every 60 miles traveled takes 1 minute to travel.  When traveling between Chicago and New York, the train’s trip has a distance of 261 miles.  <n>Next, we can determine how long it will take for the car to pass by the train while it is en route.  This is simple since each mile traveled allows us to determine the amount of minutes required.  In total, if we have 1 minute of travel, with every 1 mile traveled, we would have traveled 0.9 minutes.  Therefore, the amount of time taken for the car to travel past the train is 0.9 hours or 54 minutes of travel time.  In total, the car would travel 54 minutes faster than the train.<n><n>If the train has a travel speed of 60mph and travels a distance of 200 miles, that

The cable bill is 19 cents less than the phone bill. How much was the total bill?<n>Output: If the cable bill was $98 the difference to reach $99 is 19-98=21. The phone bill was $98. Difference to reach 99 is 1-98=97. The total bill is 98+97=195<n>If the phone bill was $103 the difference to reach $104 is 1-103=102. The cable was $103. Difference to reach $103 is 19-103=84. The total bill is $103+84=187.<n><n>If the cable was $114 the difference to reach $88 is 1-114=-115. The phone bill is 114. Difference to reach $-88 is $-115. The total bill is $-115-88=-114<n>If the phone bill is $87 the difference to reach $0 is 1-87=88. The cable bill is $87. Difference to reach -$87 is -1. The total bill is -87-88=-165<n>So the answer is $195,<n><n>Input: Josh is making a salad.  He will be adding tomatoes, green beans and mushrooms to his salad.

When eating breakfast with large family, food left on table leads to dirty dishes.<n>Input: You are taking a road trip with your sister.  You get to a point on the road where you see a fork.  One road goes left and the other road goes right.  If you go left, you'll see an alligator at the bottom of a lake in 3 kilometers.  If you go right, you'll see a monkey and your boss at the top of a hill in 4 kilometers.  What should you do?<n>Output: If you go right, (1) You will go left after going 4 km and<n>(2) Then go left after 3 km, because of an alligator<n>So you will go back to where you started, 9km away.<n>It is 4 km back to the fork, so it is more likely that you will meet your boss on the left side, because you'll cross the lake and the lake is wide.<n>Input: John wants to make 45 loaves of bread to feed his family.

How many copies are needed to print 800-page document, when the cost of one-page is the same, but the total cost of each set of five documents is $244?"<n>```<n>    public static void calculateCost(Document[][] documents){<n>     int cost_pages =  costPages(documents[0]);<n>    int print_cost = parseCost( cost_pages);<n>    for (Document d : documents) {<n>    cost_pages = calculateCost(d);<n>    print_cost = calculateCost(d) + parseCost( cost_peges(d));<n>      }<n>    }<n>```<n>The solution was given as 2.5 pages with cost $49.25 and 3.5 pages with cost of $363.<n>I thought this was easy to crack for my case. First, I set the countdown to zero and kept it there throughout the entire process.<n><n>The first thing I did was print out every page needed for every 100 documents. For me, it's 10 pages, so I print out "10 pages, $49.24". Then, i summed up every cost with print_cost[0] summed with print_cost[1] summed with print cost[2] summed with print costs of 2 + print costs of 3 and so on to the page needed for 500 documents, i multiplied it with 5 in case every one page cost $0.14. Then, I subtracted from 800 the print costs, and the difference (in my case, it was 2.5 pages worth $49.20).<n><n>The final answer is 800-2.5 = <<800-

Choices:  A: detroit B: australia C: michigan park D: cafe E: retail store<n>Output:		We have no more money.<n>After buying $A+ $B, our total cost will be A + B, since, after buying $A, the sum has become $A + C because A is our chosen barbecue sauce<n>$B + C would also be true, since $A was added to our total. In summary, $A+B = A + C, and $B+C would also be true.<n>We'll now have to multiply our total sum A + C by $4, because our $5 was spent in buying sauce A.<n>A + C * 4 = A * 4 + C * 4<n>Then, we'll have to add $retail and take our total cost by $2<n>A * 4 + C*4 + retail = A * 4+ C*4+Retail + 2 * A* 4 + C* 4<n>So, We need to sum A *4 + A*4+C *4 + C *4 + 2 * A *4 + 2*C*4 <n>So far:  A * 4 + A * 4 + (2 A * 4) + (2 C * 4) + C * 4     = $A * 4 * 2 + C * 4 * 3 <n>Therefore, our final cost is $A * 4*2+C * 4*3<n>So, the final answer is<n>$A *2+C*3<n><n>Input: Linda is baking brownies for a church meeting.

Choices:  A: like more B: nodding C: by wearing rings D: concordance E: shake hands<n>Output:		In order to make sure your sentence makes sense, you should consider what the sentence really means.<n>If someone says, "I agree with you.", then what does that really mean?<n>Answer: They mean that they agree with your statement.  This is the sentence: "I agree with you."<n>So for instance here is an example:<n>I hate that John.<n>John -> I hate that John<n>If John then says: I agree with you, what he really means is this:<n>I agree with you that John -> I agree with you that John<n>John -> I agree with you.<n>Since John agreed with you, the sentence makes sense.<n>If you say: "You and me aren't friends." Then what you really mean is this:<n>You and I are not friendly with each other -> you and I are not friendly<n>So you need to agree with me.<n>Agreeing with me means that the following sentence is a statement about John:<n>you agree with me that John was your friend<n>or you agree that John was your friend. This is a statement about John because we said that John was my friend.<n>So this sentence means that I am agreeing with you that John was your friend, but what that translates to is that you said John was your friend, and I'm saying that it was not true. In other words, you saying that John was your friend made things true. Now, I am saying it is not true that John was your friend which makes it false.<n>Since John is your friend, I cannot agree with you.<n>So for my example:<n>I agree with your statement.<n>I hate that John -> John hated that John<n>What is John's statement?<n>It's that John hates that John. This is not a statement about John.<n>It is a statement about why John hates himself.<n>So what you need to agree with is:<n>I agree that John hates that he doesn't have a nickel.<n>In this case, both statements are about John, one is about whether it's possible, the other is about what he believes.<n>So in order to agree, John needs to have two nickels.<n><n><n>

Choices:  A: downtown area B: urban area C: new york city D: shopping mall E: military base<n>Output:		A, C, D are all possible<n>only B is not possible. All the answers are plazas<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n><n>The first problem is the most complex problem in which you need to compare the total number with the remaining number.<n>Since you can choose between 5 different possible answer you need to check which one is the most correct.<n>The first way is if the answer is 0 you only have to get what Mary does before she gave her 45 additional stickers.<n>If Mary has 89 stickers now you have two choices:<n>either 21 stickers or 27stickers.<n>Even though that Mary had 21 stickers before she made her 45 additions it is possible to add it again to her 89 stickers and get a number that is more than 89.<n>So, our answer is only 89 - 27 = <<89-27=62>>62 stickers<n><n>The same logic is for the second problem, you need to have the same amount of money as Mary to get all the stickering done.<n>You need to have what Mary has to start with added to her total of $10, which you receive from mowing the law. We find that you already have a total of $35, which includes $5 and $20.<n>You receive an additional $10 from mowing the law, which will lead you to a total of $45 and an additional $n which equals $2 in our problem.<n>This means your Mary has a total of $40 and you have a total of $47.<n>Since you had $35 with extra $2, all you can do is to start with the same initial value and this is only possible $40 and $47<n>So the final answer will be  $47-40= <<47-40=>=8>>8<n><n>As for the third problem you want to find the number of legs of all the animals you have.<n>You first need to add the legs for the kangaroos.<n>This is a very straightforward process, as you just take 2 legs out to count it.<n><n>Then you need to add the legs on the goats.<n>Again you only have to subtract from this total one goat and you will get the legs you have

If the runway is 300 meters long, what is the speed of the plane at the point in time when the wings are 100 meters from the end of the runaway?<n>Answer: There are two ways to answer this:  One way involves a speed formula that says speed = dist / time.  The distance of the runaway is: runawayLength = 300m  And the time of flight is:  Let t = time of flight  When we plug t into the speed formula we see that = 300/t   Taking the derivative of that formula we get the instantaneous speed by plugging in the variable of choice we get  = 300*2 = 600 m/min  The other way to solve this is to know that it takes the wings of the plane 100 meters to get to the end of the runway, if the total length of the runway = 300 meters then it takes 300-100 = 200 meters of runaway for this to occur   Since we know that the plane takes off from the start of the runway, this plane has to be able to fly an average of  100 meters every minute   This number gets put into the time slot, to get the same value of 200 meters in a minute   The

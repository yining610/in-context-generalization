What are the risks if this step is skipped? How can good scope management help avoid this risk?\n\nWithout clearly defining a scope, any application development is doomed to fail.  In order to get a complete scope, there are two key items that must be set out: The \"what\" must be identified, and the \"what else\" must be identified (i.e. what's left out).  The \"what\" are the requirements that need to be met. These come directly from the client and typically include functional requirements.  The \"what else\" are constraints.  These come from the context in which a project is initiated.\n\nA good example of a project scope is a simple grocery shopping list.  The basic requirements would be: Buy milk.  This is the \"what\" of a shopping list.  However, it wouldn't be reasonable to add:  Buy milk for me mom in the afternoon, right after the dog gets let out.

Choices:  red blue green grey white yellow pink brown\nOutput: I think that the correct answer is yellow (2).  It's not pink, because I don't think that animals can be pink.  I think that it's either blue or green, because both those colors are also colors of plants, like the color of the grass.  It's not brown or white.  It's brown if it's the color of the ground.  And if it's the type of grass with white on the back, the grass won't look like the rest of the plants and animals.\nSo the final solution is the code 2\n\nYou can think of this problem as having 10 digits and removing 2 digits at a time until there are no more digits left.  So, let 10 = <<X>>X and 2 = <<2>>2\nThen, just calculate X-2 with recursion.  First X \u2013 2 = 10 - 2 (removes 2), so X-2 = 8.  Then X-2 = 7; then X-2 = 5; then X-2=4; and so on until X-2 becomes 0.\nAlso, for X -", "answer": "D: vegetable"}

In my opinion, this can be challenging to new programmers because it is difficult for them to distinguish where a question begins and where the next sets of data begins. A way to overcome this issue could be to insert special text line or symbols in the first section of every sets of data so that programmers will learn how to distinguish them from mathematical calculations.\n\n### How does this program help improve the problem solving skills of a student?\n\nFor starters, this program helps students to develop and increase their comprehension of the basics in programming, which includes variables, strings, looping and repetition, and so on. This can be very helpful to students who are starting to learn programming basics. This program also helps students improve their communication skills because they have to clearly and specifically input all the data they want to the program before it will run. Having a clear and complete command sets will prevent the program from running incorrectly. This requires the programmer to be more precise with their input.\n\n### Did you encounter any challenges? If so, can you describe them?\n\nYes, I encounter some challenges along the way, although I do not consider these limitations, but rather learning opportunities. During the process creating the program, especially at the beginning when I was still getting used to the syntax for the programming language I used, I ran into a considerable amount of syntax errors. Syntax errors basically occur when there is mistake or inconsistency in the format or syntax used in the programming code. This is a big setback during the early stage of programming because at this stage you will be getting a lot of syntax errors when you code, this was what I experienced at the beginning when I started learning Java. However, as I get more familiar with the syntax and coding format, my syntax errors have reduced tremend", "answer": "D: read book"}

Using this equation with variable substitution in our original equation, we get:\n\n\n247 = 12 + 10 + x - 10 = x\n\nFrom here, x - 10 (or any number added to the front of an equation is the LHS) and you solve (or flip the entire equation) to get:\n\nx - 10 = 10 (3rd one down)\n\nx = 20, which means both bikes were priced at $20.\n\n\n##### Solution\n\n##### Solution:\n\nIn the original question, it stated that John's bike was 100% \"more\" than his sister's, \nIn order to interpret the sentence, 100% is referring to the fraction \"of\" another, in this case \"of\" the same.

It does not matter how big it is, 1 box has $2014.\nSo it comes in 1 box.\nSo 1 box contains $2014\nSo it can be $2014 for $1 a box, or $20$2$4 for 4 boxes.  If it is $2$0$1$4$ for $4$ $1$ $4$ boxes, then there are 4 4's and $1$'s, which is $1$ $4$.\nSo it is $20$ '4' '4' $4$ which is $20$ $4$ $1$.\nSo then there are 2 '2' in $20$ $2$ $2$ $0$.\nThen it has $3$ '3$ in 20$ 2$ 2$3$, which is 20$3$2$2$$, so it is 20$2$2$3$$.

Each quarter is worth 12 points. How many more points does he need to score in order to meet the goal?\nOutput: He can score 44 more points to reach 104\nIf he scores 63 points and reaches the goal, he must score 63+104 = <<63 104>>104 points. From this, 51 points come from each basket with the rest comes from quarter points(assuming each quarter contains 12 points).\nBy breaking down 63 points into basket and quarter points: 26 points from his 12 baskets and the rest 37 points from quarter points(assume the quarters has 37 points for each)\nBut we must take half of quaters into baskets (assume in each quarter there are 6 baskets) \nSo in each basket, if he scores 5 points in each basket, he will have to score 28 more baskets with in quarter, or 14 baskets for each quarter\nso 61 more baskets in total and he will reach the goal. The quarters are all taken by baskets so 60+6=\u00ab60+6=66\n6 baskets are all gone by scoring 5 points in each quarter. So he must score 12 points in each basket and 5 points in each of the half quarters to reach the goal. \nFinal Answer : 24 baskets and 12 points each basket = 30 points quarter and 12 points halfquarter", "answer": "D: education"}

If you own a shed, there's a chance a spider may go into your shed and be there for a little while. If you own a cellar, it's more likely that the spider will go into your cellar.  However, the shed and cellar options are less likely than the mail box option.  If a spider goes into your mailbox, there is a chance that it will crawl all over you when you open your mail, which is a likely scenario and you're more likely afraid of being bit than just being near the spider.\nFinal Answer: A.

A car travels at a speed of 90 mph in this location. How far does the car travel while the train is still in Chicago?\nOutput: To determine this, we will begin by determining which object is traveling slower. Since the train is traveling at a lower speed of 60 miles per hour, we know that car travels faster than the train.  Thus, we can start by determining the speed of the car.  Since the car is traveling at a speed of 100 miles per hour, this means that every 60 miles traveled takes 1 minute to travel.  When traveling between Chicago and New York, the train\u2019s trip has a distance of 261 miles.  \nNext, we can determine how long it will take for the car to pass by the train while it is en route.  This is simple since each mile traveled allows us to determine the amount of minutes required.  In total, if we have 1 minute of travel, with every 1 mile traveled, we would have traveled 0.9 minutes.  Therefore, the amount of time taken for the car to travel past the train is 0.9 hours or 54 minutes of travel time.  In total, the car would travel 54 minutes faster than the train.\n\nIf the train has a travel speed of 60mph and travels a distance of 200 miles, that", "answer": "C: drugstore"}

When eating breakfast with large family, food left on table leads to dirty dishes.\nInput: You are taking a road trip with your sister.  You get to a point on the road where you see a fork.  One road goes left and the other road goes right.  If you go left, you'll see an alligator at the bottom of a lake in 3 kilometers.  If you go right, you'll see a monkey and your boss at the top of a hill in 4 kilometers.  What should you do?\nOutput: If you go right, (1) You will go left after going 4 km and\n(2) Then go left after 3 km, because of an alligator\nSo you will go back to where you started, 9km away.\nIt is 4 km back to the fork, so it is more likely that you will meet your boss on the left side, because you'll cross the lake and the lake is wide.\nInput: John wants to make 45 loaves of bread to feed his family.  To do this, he needs a loaf of bread made from each recipe- the regular recipe and the whole wheat recipe.  When John is using the whole wheat recipes, he is making 8 whole loafs out of 4 recipes for the whole wheat.  John already has 13 loaves, including 6 loaves that were made from his regular recipe.  How many more regular recipe loaves does John need to make?\nOutput: A regular recipe makes 8 loaves, while one recipe makes 4. So he needs at least 8 recipes in total\nTo find the number of recipes (including 6 previous ones) needed,\n8+8(6)+8 = 8+56+8 = 8+64 = 8+68 = <<8+68=76>>76\nTo find the number needed with regular one (8 loaves),\n8(6-76/8) = <<8*(6-76/56+8/8)>>", "answer": "E: dirty dishes"}

{"idx": 800, "text": "The correct answer is A\nInput: If a snake had eight legs, what would it be? Choices: A: scorpion B: centipede C: spider D: millipede E: lizard\nOutput: The correct choice is B\n\nInstead of the solution, you'll be shown some code snippets from the function.\n\nThe question: \"How many pages are needed to print 400 documents, when one page has a print cost of $0.14 and the total cost for each set of one-hundred documents is $24? How many copies are needed to print 800-page document, when the cost of one-page is the same, but the total cost of each set of five documents is $244?\"\n```\n    public static void calculateCost(Document[][] documents){\n     int cost_pages =  costPages(documents[0]);\n    int print_cost = parseCost( cost_pages);\n    for (Document d : documents) {\n    cost_pages = calculateCost(d);\n    print_cost = calculateCost(d) + parseCost( cost_peges(d));\n      }\n    }\n```\nThe solution was given as 2.5 pages with cost $49.25 and 3.5 pages with cost of $363.\nI thought this was easy to crack for my case. First, I set the countdown to zero and kept it there throughout the entire process.\n\nThe first thing I did was print out every page needed for every 100 documents. For me, it's 10 pages, so I print out \"10 pages, $49.24\". Then, i summed up every cost with print_cost[0] summed with print_cost[1] summed with print cost[2] summed with print costs of 2 + print costs of 3 and so on to the page needed for 500 documents, i multiplied it with 5 in case every one page cost $0.14. Then, I subtracted from 800 the print costs, and the difference (in my case, it was 2.5 pages worth $49.20).\n\nThe final answer is 800-2.5 = <<800-", "answer": "E: small case"}

{"idx": 978, "text": "A, C, D are all possible\nonly B is not possible. All the answers are plazas\n\n### Explanation:\n\n\nThe first problem is the most complex problem in which you need to compare the total number with the remaining number.\nSince you can choose between 5 different possible answer you need to check which one is the most correct.\nThe first way is if the answer is 0 you only have to get what Mary does before she gave her 45 additional stickers.\nIf Mary has 89 stickers now you have two choices:\neither 21 stickers or 27stickers.\nEven though that Mary had 21 stickers before she made her 45 additions it is possible to add it again to her 89 stickers and get a number that is more than 89.\nSo, our answer is only 89 - 27 = <<89-27=62>>62 stickers\n\nThe same logic is for the second problem, you need to have the same amount of money as Mary to get all the stickering done.\nYou need to have what Mary has to start with added to her total of $10, which you receive from mowing the law. We find that you already have a total of $35, which includes $5 and $20.\nYou receive an additional $10 from mowing the law, which will lead you to a total of $45 and an additional $n which equals $2 in our problem.\nThis means your Mary has a total of $40 and you have a total of $47.\nSince you had $35 with extra $2, all you can do is to start with the same initial value and this is only possible $40 and $47\nSo the final answer will be  $47-40= <<47-40=>=8>>8\n\nAs for the third problem you want to find the number of legs of all the animals you have.\nYou first need to add the legs for the kangaroos.\nThis is a very straightforward process, as you just take 2 legs out to count it.\n\nThen you need to add the legs on the goats.\nAgain you only have to subtract from this total one goat and you will get the legs you have", "answer": "D: shopping mall"}

If the runway is 300 meters long, what is the speed of the plane at the point in time when the wings are 100 meters from the end of the runaway?\nAnswer: There are two ways to answer this:  One way involves a speed formula that says speed = dist / time.  The distance of the runaway is: runawayLength = 300m  And the time of flight is:  Let t = time of flight  When we plug t into the speed formula we see that = 300/t   Taking the derivative of that formula we get the instantaneous speed by plugging in the variable of choice we get  = 300*2 = 600 m/min  The other way to solve this is to know that it takes the wings of the plane 100 meters to get to the end of the runway, if the total length of the runway = 300 meters then it takes 300-100 = 200 meters of runaway for this to occur   Since we know that the plane takes off from the start of the runway, this plane has to be able to fly an average of  100 meters every minute   This number gets put into the time slot, to get the same value of 200 meters in a minute   The", "answer": "C: transistor"}

{"idx": 854, "text": "C\n\n### Instructions for the next programming exercise are as follows:\n\nYou will be writing a program to calculate the number of stickers that Mary has left, given that she has spent 3 large stickers and 7 small stickers on individual pages of her journal. Your program should first read in the number of large stickers that Mary used and then read in the number of small stickers that Mary used. For example, your code could look something like:\n```\nn1 = numStickersMaryUsedLarge1;\nn2 = numStickersUsed1;\n```\nFor example, given Mary uses 9 large stickers and 4 small stickers on a page of her journal, your code could print out:\n```\n9 * 12 + 4 * 5 = 69\n```\nFor this exercise, you will need to print out the remainder number of stickers after using 7 large stickers and 3 small stickers (within the loop). You can use modulus with an unsigned integer to see how many stickers are left after the final loop.\n```\nn = numLargeStickersMaryHasUsed - 21\n```\nWhere `n` is the number of sticker remaining.\n\nExample for 89 stickers with 3 large stickers:\n```\n89 - 21 = 68 stickers\n```\nExample for 80 stickers with 7 large stickers:\n\n```\n80 - 21 =69 stickers   \n```\nFor example if 80 was the input for the number of stickers, and if the first loop ran into n2 to calculate the remainder, it will get stuck in a loop and have no chance to get out.\n\n### Your solution should be a Java method called GetNumStickersRemaining.  It should return the number of stickers left after the number of large stickesrs is substracted and the number of small stickesrs is subtracketd by two.\n\n### Output for 89 stickesrs is 23.\n\n### In what format are you returning the output?\n\nYour programming solution should print out the number of remaining stickers, in decimal format.\n\n### Example Input(s)\n\n89    21", "answer": "C: maps"}

Code Review is not a code-writing service where someone will write your entire code for you. It may very well be helpful, but please take the time to improve the question before you post it.\n\nComment: Yes, I know the answer is 4\n\nComment: @DavidTonhofer, I've edited the question per your review\n\nAnswer: This can be done in standard C#, so maybe there are some language specific idioms I've missed.\n\nAs the examples are for \"Instruction:\", I think the easiest way to approach these is to make the first question with correct answer 0, and then increment by 1. The next 50 questions then just increase the incrementer, but you will end up doing very, very similar questions throughout.\n\nTo keep this from being the most-answered question on CR ever, let's give it a little bit more effort than that!\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item For the first 5 questions you can just take the first 5 questions from https://stackoverflow.com/a/41089495/219155\n\\item The second 5 can just be the same 5 questions, but with the answers reversed.\n\\item The next 25 can be the first 25 from https://stackoverflow.instructure.com/courses/508005/quizzes/2285564/quiz-1-question-1/2285663\n\\item The next is just the next 25 in the same way.\n\\item This goes on... You get the idea.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nTo make sure these are \"C#, questions, only\" I've updated the 20th question to include the language specifier:\n\n\\begin{code}\nInput: Sally is in class.

It has lots of different names in different countries but this is how it might be written in Spanish: doce y cuatro. The number 14. What\u2019s interesting about these languages, is that the number that they use to represent ten is different. What is the ten, you ask?  The ten in Spanish is diez. In Japanese, it\u2019s ichi (\u4e00). In Russian, it\u2019s zhetye (\uff17). In French, the tens is dix (\u30c7\u30a3\u30a8\u30f3). It seems that there are lots of different ways to notate the number 10. But what\u2019s interesting is that the 14 also has a different name in Spanish. It is quince y cuatro. What\u2019s interesting is that some languages do not write a number if it is less than the last digit in their number system. Does this seem odd that a single number is named differently? I find it to be interesting that there are all kinds of different ways to not use a number to notate a number. You can notate a number a lot of different ways to show a number.

We are only taking variables from one function and sending them to the next function. \n\n#### The function add_nums sums the two numbers together.\n\n### In the example code, we see that there are multiple functions. Why does our code  look this way rather than just having a series of if statements?\n\n#### We are calling different methods based on the number given in the string. Rather than creating multiple if statements we are just choosing the method of operation based on the conditions.\n\n#### This example requires a little bit of explaining. We are reading the string and breaking it apart into 4 parts. We are looking for 4 different numbers, each of which we are sending to a different method of summing. Once we have the result of each sum, we are choosing an operator based on the number and then passing that information to the last method of the string. \n\n### In this example, what is the most important step in passing the values to each of the methods?\n\n#### The two important steps are:\n\n1.  Creating or reading the string.\n2.  Setting the string to point to the beginning of the string.\n\n#### In order to create and send the individual strings, we need to know where the string is located in a memory space. We need to read and write out locations within the memory space we have provided in the string.\n\n### The sum method needs 3 parameters. Which parameter does not exist?\n\n#### The parameter does not exist because we do not need a name to sum. Rather we are calling a method and suppping it with a name.\n\n### What does each operator do?\n\n#### + returns the sum of the integer parameters\n\n#### - returns the integer and subtracts each value returned.\n\n#### * returns the integer and multiplies it by the integer parameter.\n\n#### / returns the integer and divides the integer parameter", "answer": "E: work"}

How can he pay for his book?\nOutput: $20 as the change, $10 as the amount\n\nThe solution is simple:\n\n### In this challenge, you will write simple functions, including those that use variables.\nIn this exercise, you will have a chance to practice writing functions. You will use functions to add, subtract, multiply and divide. The number 40 represents the score and the function is used to add the score to the player's previous score.\n\n#### Writing Functions\nLet's begin this challenge with an example. The code below represents the game score of the Red Sox player.\n\n```\nfunction RedSoxGame(){\n  let score=40;\n  print(\"The score of Red Sox player is: 40\");\n  playerscore.append(score);\n}\n```\nThe code displays the 40 on the screen. When we run the code again, we get a score of 80 because the function appends the previous score of 40.\n\n\nIn the code below, we pass in \"Red Sox\" as a parameter and display the current player's score.\n\n```\nconst gamescore =function(player){\n  let currentScore=0;\n  gamescoreAppendedPlayerscore();\n};\n```\n\nIn the sample above, currentScore is an internal variable. In computer science, variables keep track of a piece information that changes throughout the program.\n```\n  gamescoreApp", "answer": "C: building"}

If I cut the pants in such a way so that I have a pair of shorts which is 30 cm long and keep the rest, what are the total height and width of the fabric which I used? We know the fabric is 90 cm(L)x169 cm(H), but we need to find H. If fabric A is 90 cm x 160 cm, then we know the length which remains will be 90 - 160 = 70 cm. If fabric B is 90 cmx 151 cm, then we know 150 cm will remain, and so on.

If not then our guess is wrong.\n\nInput: Zachnot enough information\nOutput:72\nMethod:Use brute force and assume that there must be a specific amount of money to get the bike.

This variable will have an integer for each possible number of kangaroes. The variable for the total number of goats will have a different integer for each possible number. This is repeated for each animal type.\nAfter each set of integers for animals is completed, a loop will test each possible total number of legs and assign the total value of the legs for each. If the total is less than the total for each animal the total number of legs is updated for the variables for the animals. If that total is greater than that total, the correct total is found.\n\nInput: George not enough information\nOutput:59\nMethod:We can add 100 and divide it for each possible round. Then, we can add one more number to that sum. But, it isn't easy to solve by hand so do this on the computer. For 10 rounds we need 105. When using brute force we're using a computer though so we can test the correct answer every five rounds. That gives us the results for all the possibilities.

{"idx": 667, "text": "Human\n\n#### Conclusion \nMy first coding experience was at Hackbright Academy. Before attending, I already built my first website and a simple mobile app, but I never went deeper. I learned Python during the bootcamp time. I thought I would learn Swift or JavaScript for iOS development, but when I arrived to the Academy everything I learned was Python. I was glad because Python is the language which I learned beforehand. This is actually when I started programming and learning. When I arrived in China, I started teaching English online, but I don\u2019t really like it. At the same time, I started learning React with online tutorials. I think I would have been more comfortable learning front-end because that is where my skills are at (even if I already have the experience of mobile development). There were students at the academy who learned with only the bootcamp time. They learned Swift or JavaScript. We can see their difficulties and it is actually sad. I don\u2019t want to be biased but I think front-end developers who already started to learn with the bootcamp is lucky: they saved a lot of time.\n\nLater on, I started learning JavaScript from some tutorials and videos I found online. I also started learning React. I thought React would be just as good as Angular. I was wrong. I tried to follow some tutorials, but I didn\u2019t like the way React was done. I started learning React but a few developers made things harder. They were thinking Angular developers, while the people who only knew React don\u2019t know how to code in Angular. I think React is a more advanced framework. People at Hackbright who wanted to learn Angular had a hard time. The way React is designed is complicated for me. I didn\u2019t know about a library called RxJS. I would not call it a framework because I think it is a library. However, it is an advanced library. I was not able to learn it within three weeks.\n\nAt the same time, I tried to learn Vue. I was told many things not to use Vue, but I decided to use it for my side-project. After all, I was not asked to learn Vue, so there was no danger in learning from the beginner level. I finished my side-project using Vue. I would recommend Vue.\n\nIt was the same when I started learning Android. I knew some basic Java at that time and was asked to make a simple navigation", "answer": "D: kind"}

How much did he save?\nOutput: \n\n## Answer 1\n\nThe question statement can be restated into the following sentence:\n\nMary has 89 stickers altogether.  She used 7 stickers on each page of her journal out of that 89 total. Therefore, there are only 39 stickers left over.\n\n## Answer 2\n\nZach has $65 so far in savings, which is 65 / 100 = 2/5 of the required $100. On Friday, he will get an additional $10, and on Saturday, he will earn $7 per hour. This amounts to $7 / 20 = 1/3 of his weekly allowance of $5. Combined, this means he will have a total of $5 + $10 + $1 / 3 = $8.5, which means he will need to earn an additional $11.50 to have a grand total of $20.50 and therefore, a bike worth $100.\n\n## Answer3 \n\nMark has 23 kangs and three times as many kangs as goats.

It records which index each value in nums has been seen before, and therefore which indexes have not yet been seen. This is the count of the occurrence of each number, and will be 0 if number hasn't been seen before. We only need to record the values that have reached 0, then we can walk though the indices in the given sequence and return the smallest element to the new count.\n\n### [Input here.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/medium/num-increasing-bunches-sparse/)\n\n### Level 54\n#### Suggestion\n\n- In python\n\n```python\nclass Solution(object):\n    def isMatch(self, s, p):\n        self.matrix = [[0] * p[1] * p[2] for _ in range(p[0])]\n\n        def helper(c, q):\n            \"\"\"helper function with input: 1. the char array, 2. array for p\"\"\"\n            if p[c][q] == -1:\n                return\n            c1, q1 = c, q\n            if not (1 <= q <= p[c1]):\n                return\n            for d in range(max(p[d],q1) +", "answer": "C: great outdoors"}

You can also use variables to store data, but for now, we won\u2019t need them for that. \n\nFor example:\n\n```java\nint num;\nnum = 5;\nnum++;\n```\n\nIn this case, we declared a variable called num, which is equal to 5, and then, we incremented the num by 1, which gave us a number, which is equal to `5+1`, which is equal to 6.\n\nSimilarly, you get to use variables to represent unknowns, too.\n\nLet\u2019s try an example:\n\n```\nint x=8;\nint y=4;\n\nint result= x/y;\n```\n\nSince we don\u2019t know YET what y is, we have to assign it to a variable, since we can\u2019t just use x to represent the unknown y, since we want to know what both x and y is, not just y. So, all we did is to take an variable x and assign it to an unknown value y, and then we use x to compute x/y, which returns another value, which we can store in the variable result.\n\nSo, to get x, we have to do the same thing. But where do we assign x in this case? How about like this:\n`int x=4; `\n\nThis time, instead of using an already declared variable x, we assign a number 4 to the variable x.\n\n\n### Solution 2:\n\n\nIn Java, we declare a variable by using the **=** sign, followed by a certain type (for example **int**, **double** or etc.) after the name we choose for the variable, as you can see below:\n**int total =", "answer": "C: disparagement"}

The force to open a nut is equal to the amount by which the nut is over-inflated. For example, if the bird presses on a nut with a force of 1200 newtons to crack it open, then it is a bit over-inflated by 200 newtons, so it is over 1000 newtons. The bird can crack open a nut with a beak that is over-inflated by less than 1000 N. The bird can crack the walnuts which are 200 g each, but it cannot crack the Brazil nuts which are 9 times heavier, and the bird can easily crack the almonds that weigh only 8 times less than a walnut.

Loops are what we use to make things repeat, and that kind of goes hand in hand perfectly with recursion. In fact, it will eventually make all of the examples we wrote for recursion unnecessary. We can accomplish exactly the same thing with a loop if we make the loop repeat.\n\nIt's hard to describe loops in 250 words, but I'll give our best shot.\n\nImagine you're working with a text document, like we did last week. We want to add the value in each line to a running sum. We might have something like this:\n\n```python\n# lines=<many, many lines>\n# sum=0\nfor line in lines:\n    sum += float(line)\n```\n\nWe're going to have a running total, `sum`, based on the value in each line. We just did another one of those 3-stage loops we introduced last week where we define the object we're using, then we set and read properties of it using the for loop. The difference in this example is that we're using `float` to turn the numbers into actual floating-point numbers. The only other change for this loop is that we're adding up the values, rather than just putting them in a global variable.\n\nRemember when I was talking about that \"strange\" use of `==` and `!=` earlier this week? That's where we see those again.\n\nIn the example with the running total of a list of inputs, we had the two numbers `12` and `3`. The reason we didn't just use the `==` and `!==` comparison operators to check those two numbers is because they have values like all Python boolean things. To put `3==12` just like that means you're trying to compare the literal numbers 3 and", "answer": "E: larger house"}

First dfs from the start.  The dfs function is a helper funtion which returns a set of all words that start with the character 'currentLetter', for example if we want to get all the words that start with the letter A, then in the helper, the letter would be 'A'.\n\nIn the second nested loop iteration, dfs is called again but this time the 'currentLetter' is the letter before the letter in the input.  Continue until the start index with 'None' is returned.\n\n### Code\n\n```\nclass Solution:\n    def wordBreak(self, s: str, words: List[str]) -> List[int]:\n\n        helper = self.helper\n        return helper(s,words)\n\n    def helper(self,s,words):\n        \"\"\"\n        :param s str, input string without word delimiters.\n        :param words list[str], word list with counts, all words that exist in s are included\n        :return set[str], words that start with currentLetter\n        \"\"\"\n        words = collections.Counter(words)  # words with counts\n        res = set()\n        # dfs from first letter\n        for current in words:\n            if current == words.start:\n                res = {current,}\n                break\n\n        # add all the charcters before the first letter that exist\n        res += dict(sorted(current[1:] for current in words.keys()))\n\n        # sort the set to get the start index\n        # to the end to make it easy to return in a loop\n        res = res.most_common()\n        res.sort(reverse=True)\n\n        for index, current in enumerate(res):\n            if index == 0:\n\n                # loop for the first start index return 'None'\n                yield current,\n\n                continue\n\n            # dfs from start index to current letter index\n            next = current.start\n            count = next - current\n            for i in range(1,count+1):\n                yield next+i,\n```", "answer": "A: front door"}

Many of the earliest maps were based on the geography illustrated in these rivers. In fact, the Egyptians' map of the River Nile looked more like a picture of a river than a map. It showed the mountains at the beginning and the end of the river - but nothing in between. The Egyptians believed that the Nile was not a continuous river, but had four sections like seasons of the year. The upper part of the river was green, the lower part was reddish, and in the middle was a green and reddish mixture. It was because of this that the entire Nile River was once known as the \u201cGreen Stream of Egypt\u201d or \u201cRed Stream of Egypt\u201d. A mapmakery today would be criticized for being less scientific than this map.\nSince most of the maps at the start were based on the four rivers, the maps would show the four rivers flowing in a straight line and into the sea. \nTherefore, we can see from the map that the river Rhone emptied all of its flood water into the sea.  In ancient times, people believed that the only river flowed into the sea along a straight line. For example, in the map given, the Euphrates River could only enter into the sea from one specific area, not many of them.\nIf you look at how rivers in the Middle East looked on old maps, they all flowed into the \u201cArabian Sea\u201d or the Persian Gulf from one very specific location. Maps still have this tendency to show all the water of a river flowing out into the sea from one small area. The Ganga River flows into river Delta from the Indian Ocean at Calcutta, and from there into Bangladesh.\nThe great Rivers of the United State", "answer": "C: space center"}

In math D means the bottom number in a fraction. If you multiply or divide you keep D as the bottom number.  If your fraction is 3/4 its D is 4.\n\nIf you multiply a number or fraction by a whole number, the first number you multiply it by changes the denominator. For example, the denominator (bottom number) of 4/5 is 5. If you multiply 3/4 (which is the same as 0.75) by 3, the denominator is 5. If your fraction is 5/6, then the denominator after you multiply the number or fraction by 2 would be 6.\n\nIf you divide any number or fraction by any whole number, the denominator stays the same. For example, if you want to divide 5/14 by 7, the denominator would NOT change. To do this problem, you have to multiply by 7/7. 7/7 is 1.  When you see the word \"over\" the denominator stays the sam. For example, if the whole number is 7, then 5 times 7 equals 35 and 7/7 is still 1, so the fraction is still 35/1.\n\nIf your fraction is 30/6, what does 30 divided by 6 equal?\nOutput: 6\n\nWhat does the word even mean in math when it comes to even numbers?\nOutput: Even numbers have two things that are the same.

Some of the popular forms include buses, taxis, trains and airplanes. \n\nA taxi ride from point A to point B costs $30.00 plus $10.00 per additional mile. Train rides cost $12.70 for a one way ticket, and the fare for air transportation is either the cost of a one-way ticket if it\u2019s a direct flight, or the cost of a one way coach ticket plus the cost of a oneway standby ticket if it\u2019s not a direct flight. This standby ticket costs half of what one would normally pay. \n\nBesides the taxi situation in the previous problem in which 5 miles cost $30.01,  this one will include the additional charge of $10.01 per mile. \n\nPlease provide the answer to the problem for the sample values below: \n\nInput: The cost of a taxi cab ride is $30.05 and it costs $10.05 per additional mile.

You do that by using:\n\nboolEquals(3,3) //returns as true\nboolEquals(2,2) //returns as true", "answer": "A: conquer opponent"}

How many students are there in the carpool?\nOutput: 27\n\nInput:  If it takes 2 hours to fill the pool,  and a man can fill the pool in 9 hours,  then how many men does it take to fill the pool?\nOutput: 92 40 \u00f7 20 = 40\n\n# Instructions:\n\n1. Write code for a method named \"findTheAverageRate\". It should take in 1 integer (price), an integer (total days), which should be between 1 to 31. It should return the average price per day.\n\n2. Write code for a class named \"CarPool\". The class should have a variable named \"members\". This variable should hold a List which can hold other classes. These other classes for the \"members\" of the carpool will all be members of the list because the whole point of this class is 58 people. We know there is: teachers, mechanics, doctors and police officers, and then we need to add students on to it. This list should not be limited, i.e., it should be an infinite list and the carpool can hold even more people.\n\n3. Your carpool class should have a method named \"getTheTotalNumberOfMembers\". This should return the total number of members in the carpool. To get this \"list\", you should only need to type the word \"members\" and then do List.getLength() and then divide that number by 2, which will get you the total number of members minus 1.\n\n4. Your carpool class also should have a method named, \"addTheCostOfTheCarRent\". This method should take in price, total days and cost of carrental. This method should add the cost of the rental for each day the rental lasts.\n\n**Hint:** You must first add your own variables (or you can use built in ones) to store values. These values will help you add up the rental costs. You can print out the answer using System.out.println()", "answer": "A: linen closet"}

There is but one law to govern it as there is but one sun to light it.\"  This law states that letters, with the exception of y, always appear by themselves in the alphabet.  For example, \"y\" always appears before 'z' in the pronunciation of the English alphabet.  In addition, \"y\" always takes the long sound in pronunciation of long vowels, like \"a\" in \"eye.\"  Also, the \"y\" sound is always the ending \"y\" sound in pronounced words.  In addition to the two letters 'i' and 'j', the alphabet has two additional vowel sounds.  \"i\" stands for the vowel sound in words such as \"bit\" and \"pin.\"  By contrast, the \"y\" sounds in these words comes from the vowels in the suffixes \"-ty\" and \"-ty\" words: \"bit\" and \"pity.\"  The rule states that the \"y\" in the suffix '-ty' always takes the long \"y\" sound whereas the \"y\" in 'bit' takes the short \"y\" sound.  This is just one of several rules that we expect to use to help us spell words correctly. To spell a word correctly, you first have to know its pronounciation(s).  Write rules that use letters to define words.  In particular, write rules that define words by their pronounciation.\nOutput:  C  Vowels have two sounds; i and y\n\nInput: A group of six hikers leave the mountains and encounter a stream that they have to cross; there are five logs at a site that the hikers must use in order to cross the stream.

If you are not familiar with Python, have a look at our Python tutorials or the following documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html<n><n>### Instructor's suggestion:<n>To answer the question,you will need a dictionary where each element is a key and the values are two numbers in which one is the multiplier.<n>and the other tells us how many "days" the multiplier stands for.<n><n>For example, A[2]==[[1,3]] means to multiply by 3 and get 1, so use the first element with A[2], and divide it by A[2][0]. That would be 3, multiply it by 3 would give 9.<n>Also, there is a multiplier for a full 7 days, (but is not necessarily the lowest multiplier). To get the lowest multiplier one must add up the number of times the key multiplier can be reused.<n><n>Here is a program for it.

You may fix any answer provided above (even if it is correct). 1) Cars rented during summer are charged at $30/day and then $35/day anytime after Labor Day. Your first choice of length of rental was incorrect. You can’t just add the price of $30 to the days you said it was, you need another formula. 2) For the second answer, what I gave you was clearly correct, and the only alternative is E, which is not a correct answer. You should always check your answer against questions you answer to make sure that they’re all correct. 3) The first five answers have the same question, but different choices. I know that’s what you would do, but in order to get every last question answered you will need to get the right answers. So instead of looking for the same question, look for the correct answers.<n><n>Input: What is six times the product of eight and nine?

The land will be divided into two pieces, with each piece being an integer length 1<=piece size<=100. To make sure everyone can be accommodated, the park needs to have at least one bench where people can sit and enjoy the view. The city needs to pay an external company to find the best way to place the bench to get maximum seating per dollar, so they want to give the money for the bench to that company, not to the city.<n>Output:  There is one path that will place the bench such that the bench covers as many people's view as possible.  If there are an even number of seats in the park, it is preferable to place the bench near the beginning of the park.  However, when there are an odd number of seats, the park is more desirable if we place the bench closer to the end, so long as the bench covers most of people's views.<n><n>Input:<n>You can write your program here<n>Output:<n>You can write the test harness here.

You rent a flat and a portion of your rent is $5 more than 1/200 of the total amount owed.

In the first round, you roll 2 dice each time, and if you get a sum of 4 or more, then you roll again. Otherwise you pass, and get no further turns. If the die is passed in the first round, you can't get it in the next round, even if you roll a sum greater than 3.

Even if the dog usually licks the cuts, it is rare that a dog would choose to bite a person. And it is 99% they will catch the virus.<n>    So if the cut is minor and the dog almost never licks cuts, answer yes.<n>    But if the cut a deeper and there is a lot of blood running around, then it is not a cut. (There is a difference between a cut and a wound.) So the dog most likely chose to bite the person, instead of just licking, the dog would be more likely infected, than the person. So answer no.<n>    Also, the dog must have bit the person more than once, if the person has a minor cut and the dog licks (or even licks then nibbles a bit) and then starts licking again while the cut starts to bleed, which it would cause the animal to become infected.

There was a target on the wall for him to bounce against.  Where might he be? Choices:  A: pool table B: toy box C: playroom D: park E: closet<n>Output:		The boy is bouncing the ball off a playroom toy box. There was a target in the playroom.<n><n>Output: Billy found that, when he bounced his ball off the toy box, it reached the bottom of the target. So he knew that the target was at the height represented by 2x+2.<n>But first he'd have to measure the distance it'd take to reach the target.  He counted the number of bounces, and knew that if he'd been a step closer to the target and bounced the ball 10 more times, the result would be 2x+1, which is the same distance away as 2x+2, so this is the answer.<n><n><n>Input:The ball-pitching machine is set up with a target in the position 2x+2 above it. The player uses a ball with coefficient of restitution = 0.5. When he bounces the ball off the target, its velocity is 10m/s.  How high off the floor will the ball go?<n><n>Output: The velocity just before it hits the target is 10-2*2=<<10-2*4=6>>6m/s. You know that it'll be the same speed the 3 bounces later.<n>So 4*6=<<4*6=24>>24.<n>Then that's 2*sqrt(2) which is 1.5.<n>So 3bounces=<<3bounces=1.5>>1.5, and it reached 1.5 meters.<n>

There are a variety of card games some common ones include poker, shuffle board, and spades. I chose poker because of how complicated the scoring was, so what poker games is the question testing on? There are many types of poker games with some variations. I want to focus on the standard Texas hold ‘em where your starting hand is chosen from a set of 2 dealt cards. I will only be concerned with the scoring of the hand, not card distribution. The scoring of the hand is simple it only depends on you 2 faced down hole cards, the 5 community cards, and 1 random card that the person with the best hand is dealt and revealed. Based on which combination and how it is arranged you can make an estimate of the number of hands played by people with particular hole cards and an estimate on what that person’s poker rating is. The final round is based on how long it plays out and what number community cards are still remaining.<n><n>Input: What are the first 3 digits of the number 5396881412528586?<n>Output: ANSWER: 5396<n>Input: A man is playing bingo in church.

Choices:  A: residential neighborhood B: community C: building D: prague E: every city<n>Output:		The right answer is B:Community. In the first sentence, the answer was saying BUILDING because it said "Community college" not "Community". The second sentence answered this choice.<n><n>Comment: The last one might be interesting but not a duplicate. I might consider doing that if the rest of the answers are not too broad (and not too long) though.<n><n>Comment: @VLAZ Thanks, but for now, I would rather leave it open for a community review and see what they say.<n><n>Answer: For the first question, you can consider a table, like this:<n><n>\begin{code}<n> Day        Price     Price<n> 1   30        30<n> 2   30        60<n> 3   30       120<n> 4   30       180<n> 5   30       240<n> 6   30       300<n> 7   30       360<n> 8   30       420<n> 9   30       480<n>10   30       540<n>11   30       600<n>12   30       660<n>\end{code}<n><n>You can fill it easily enough as you parse the question. The final amount will be the total from the price column for each row minus the price column for the last row.<n><n>The last one should not be a duplicate, imo. It's asking, if a school is \em{most likely} to be located somewhere, where? Which place is most likely to be a home to a school? The answer is not the town with the most schools since that might not be where it is most likely, so in that sentence, we eliminate towns. Then it narrows it down to what is the \strong{most likely} place for a school, which is within a neighborhood. The other options are possible, but it is not the most likely.<n><n>Comment: I'd say that, regardless of the actual answer, the question is *too* broad and *too* unclear. I don't know enough about it to give a definitive answer, but I'd argue that it's better off on [Code Review](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/) than it is here. If its unclearness is too much of a problem for you personally,

So the answer for 1 and 2 is 21 knots per hour. The question doesn't specify if it is one hour so you would multiply 21 * 24 to get the miles per hour. As for the 3rd one, the question asks for the total

So chairs on Row A are the best for the speaker.<n>Row C has seats for the audience but not many. Row D needs to have chairs for the audience, so Row D is the best choice. Row B is good for meetings where row C is bad. Row E is also for the audience.<n>All of the rooms are good for what we want but Row D has the most people, assuming the audience is sitting and not standing. Hence, Row D is good.<n>B:<n>This one is easy. All you have to do is count the chairs and decide if that is enough. Too many chairs are a problem.<n>C:<n>This one is hard. If you go to the middle, the people next to it are in the shadows, and people from behind can not see. Hence, Row C is bad.<n>Going to the left, will not let people sitting in the middle. Going to the right, everyone in front of you is in the shadows. This includes people from your left, so Row C is still bad. The more important question is that if you go to the first row, then Row C is good. Going to Row C also makes people next to the speaker in the shadows.<n>The room is huge and can seat a lot of people. If you are in the front, then Row C is bad. For this person, I would go to Row A. Row C is good because the light is right and people sitting in Row C are not in the shadows. <n>D:<n>The room has to many seats! It is possible you could make a circle facing each other.<n>For this person, I would pick Row C. I am not sure Row B works, and it really depends on what you want. If you want to see what is going on, or want to see the speaker, then Row C is where you should sit. You can also see it is good for the person next to you, the speaker, and is good for your shadow.<n>E:<n>Historically, churches are big and old and so chairs
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The car-rental agency charges $30/day for a car, or $190 for the first week for a rental that lasts an entire week or longer. Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input:If I wanted to store my chess pawn when I wasn't using it, what would be a good place for that? Choices:  A: chess set B: strategy C: toy store D: chess game E: small case<n>Output:		A: chess set<n>I wanted to store my chesse pawn on the chess set.<n><n>Input: 3/4 x a.b^6 = 8y^2 + 9y + 12. Find the value of a.<n>Output: 3/4 * a^(6/4) = 8y^6 + 9y^4 + 12.<n>To solve it you first expand with rules of index and power. A^6 = a^2*a*a*a*4, 12 is not the only factor of a^6 so we have 8y^6 = 9y^4 * 12 so we can cancel the y's.<n>So A^(6/4) * 4 = 9*12 = 12. Since 12=2^3 A.<n><n>Input: a) 2 b) 3 c) 5 d) 5 e) 0<n>Output: 2, 5, 10, 15...<n><n>Input: 16, 13, 22, 19, 4, 5 and 10 and 11. The median is 19. Find the range.<n>Output:The range 7<n>The range is how close the numbers are together. The closer the numbers are together, the smaller the range. Because the median was 19, so the numbers below 19 and the numbers above 19, which are numbers 6 and 5, and they add up to the median number. So the range is 5+6=<<5+6=11>>11.

You need to write an application (C program) with one function called main. For your program, we need to provide you with a function that takes a number, m (0 < m < 10). We encourage to call the function in the main function so the input/output (I/O) happens only once per line. (In the program we are interested in the final result, not exactly how you get it.) You only need to modify the provided template.<n><n>This is the main function template:<n><n>```C<n>int main(int argc, char const *argv[]) { int i, n, m, j; char c;<n>    for (i = 1; i < argc; i++) {<n>        n = atoi(argv[i]); m = atoi(argv++; argc - i);<n>        for (j = n; j > m; j--) putchar('#');<n>```<n>#### Instruction:Please include an explicit return statement in your main function in the final program. It should return something. We encourage you to print out or otherwise render the final expression in the main function so that we can look at it for debugging. Also, as a nice bonus to you, you will see the exact expression that was entered by John! That means, no guesswork! You only need to implement a function that takes two arguments: number of lines and number of zebras (which is 1-based, so 0 represents there are no zebras in the pool).<n>#### Instruction:You must implement the function ‘zebra-pool’. You should pass in the arguments as separate C-style strings and you should assume they are null terminated. You should use strlen to find the length of each string. The function may or may not be static. You can write the code in any form you like. But please be consistent and also comment your code. Your code needs to work for the input:315<n>#### Instruction:There are several ways to approach the problem. You may use a ‘countdown’ sort of method or a nested-loop method. You may also work on the number of ‘#’ characters in the main function, but this is not required. You

I could think about this for a while and decided to multiply the result of 11-7 over 5. However, multiplying didn't get me the answer the way I wanted. Then we multiplied 190 with 2. We got 380.

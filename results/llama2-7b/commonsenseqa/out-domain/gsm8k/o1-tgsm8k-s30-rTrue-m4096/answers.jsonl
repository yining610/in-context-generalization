Find the total amount owed in dollars.\nOutput:The building is 250 units, and the rate is $100.\nSo if one unit is 4/250, then 5 more than that (we need all decimals) is\n5*4/250 = 5*0.0160 = 0.0800\nAnd $100 * 0.08 = 8\nSo the answer is 8.\n\nInput:In a game, the object is to get 4 or more dice to give the same sum, then take your turn to roll them. In the first round, you roll 2 dice each time, and if you get a sum of 4 or more, then you roll again. Otherwise you pass, and get no further turns. If the die is passed in the first round, you can't get it in the next round, even if you roll a sum greater than 3. In the second round, you would have two opportunities to get the dice, but not more. How many possible numbers of dice can a player have in the second round? Choices: A: 40 B: 5 C: 8 D: 1799 E: 23\nOutput: If the first person gets 4 dice by throwing 2 dice each, then the second person can potentially get 2 dice by throwing 2.\nIf the first player passes, then the second player will get 1 dice by throwing 2 (and he may then, if not passed, get a third by throwing 2, then he may again throw 2 to get a third, and so on).\nSo the total possible number of dice is 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus... or\n(1+2)*(1+2)*...\nand 2^10-1 is 1024 (if you use 1^10-1=1023 then the result would be (1+2)*(2+2)... * 1024\n\nInput:The car-rental agenices", "answer": "C: music class"}

Even if the dog usually licks the cuts, it is rare that a dog would choose to bite a person. And it is 99% they will catch the virus.\n    So if the cut is minor and the dog almost never licks cuts, answer yes.\n    But if the cut a deeper and there is a lot of blood running around, then it is not a cut. (There is a difference between a cut and a wound.) So the dog most likely chose to bite the person, instead of just licking, the dog would be more likely infected, than the person. So answer no.\n    Also, the dog must have bit the person more than once, if the person has a minor cut and the dog licks (or even licks then nibbles a bit) and then starts licking again while the cut starts to bleed, which it would cause the animal to become infected. But if a patient has an open wound caused from an assault, which a dog licks, and it would most likely not infect the patient\nOutput: yes\n\n\n\n###Instruction: Answer the following multiple choice question:\n\nInput: What animal has the greatest brain to body weight ratio in the animal kingdom?\n\n    Mouse: Rodents are known to be smarter than other animals with the same body weight.\n\nOutput: A mouse.\n\n####Instruction: Answer the question in the box below.\n\nInput: How does the function g(n)=(sqrt(n)-1)/n compare with the function f(n)=sqrt(n)?\n\n\n####Instruction\n\nAnswer the following short answer question:\n\n\"Rubin is planning a walk.

Find the dimensions of a Rectangular field.\nOutput:Answer: The Area of Rectangular Feild is 400 and the dimensions are 18 ft and 12 ft.\nMethod: The length of the Rectangular Feild less than the Width. So for the Length, we need to subtract from Width. Now Length = Width \u2013 10 and Width = Length +10\n\nNow for find the Area we will use two different formula. One for width and one for Length\n\nArea of Rectangular Feild = Area of Width Feild( 12 ft x 18 ft) + Area of Length Feild(18 ft x 10 ft) \nSo for the Area we will need to multiply the Dimensuons and then add. The dimensions for Area should be the Width and the Length\nArea = (10 ft)*(18 ft) + (18 ft)*(10 ft)\n\nArea = 180 ft\n\nArea = 400\n\nArea = 2 ft\n\nNow from the question we know that for Area 400 and two is dimension. So first we will find Width and Length\n\nDimension = 2\n\nNow for Find Width we can take  Dimension / Area\n\n1/2 = Dimension / Area\n1/2 = 2/400\n\n1/2=1/8\n\nDimension =1\n\nNext dimension we will take 2-Dimension to find Length\n\n18-2=16\n\nDimension = Dimension + 1\n\n18=19\n\nDimension =4\n\n##### Instruction:Answer the Following problem in detail.\n\nInput:The rectangle has an area of 500 square inches.

There was a target in the playroom.\n\nOutput: Billy found that, when he bounced his ball off the toy box, it reached the bottom of the target. So he knew that the target was at the height represented by 2x+2.\nBut first he'd have to measure the distance it'd take to reach the target.  He counted the number of bounces, and knew that if he'd been a step closer to the target and bounced the ball 10 more times, the result would be 2x+1, which is the same distance away as 2x+2, so this is the answer.\n\n\nInput:The ball-pitching machine is set up with a target in the position 2x+2 above it.

I might consider doing that if the rest of the answers are not too broad (and not too long) though.\n\nComment: @VLAZ Thanks, but for now, I would rather leave it open for a community review and see what they say.\n\nAnswer: For the first question, you can consider a table, like this:\n\n\\begin{code}\n Day        Price     Price\n 1   30        30\n 2   30        60\n 3   30       120\n 4   30       180\n 5   30       240\n 6   30       300\n 7   30       360\n 8   30       420\n 9   30       480\n10   30       540\n11   30       600\n12   30       660\n\\end{code}\n\nYou can fill it easily enough as you parse the question. The final amount will be the total from the price column for each row minus the price column for the last row.\n\nThe last one should not be a duplicate, imo. It's asking, if a school is \\em{most likely} to be located somewhere, where? Which place is most likely to be a home to a school? The answer is not the town with the most schools since that might not be where it is most likely, so in that sentence, we eliminate towns. Then it narrows it down to what is the \\strong{most likely} place for a school, which is within a neighborhood. The other options are possible, but it is not the most likely.\n\nComment: I'd say that, regardless of the actual answer, the question is *too* broad and *too* unclear. I don't know enough about it to give a definitive answer, but I'd argue that it's better off on [Code Review](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/) than it is here.

Choices:  (A) Clouds (B) Humidity (C) Sunlight  (D) Thunderstorms (E) The Equator\n\nOutput:The correct Answers are (b), (d) and (e).\n\nClouds are not involved, they do rise during the day but, the temperature is still hot.\nHumidity is involved, but if the humidity is so high that there is no rain, then it would be too hot for humidity to cause the temperature to rise.\nSunlight does not cause the temperature to rise, in fact, it gets colder the hotter the sun gets.\n\nThe Equator is a reason for the temperature to decrease, not increase. The temperature is the same all around the equator, because it's constant day and night but in the tropics it does not get colder at night, and therefore, the equator does not cause a decrease in the temperature either.\nThunderstorms do cause the temperature to rise during the day sometimes, but not to the point of hot, just warm and rainy.\n\nTo determine the temperature during the day, it is necessary to know about weather conditions of a day(clouds, thunderstorms, sunlight, humidity, rainfall, temperature, pressure, elevation, etc.).\n\nInput: What does one mean when he or she is asking \"what one's up to\"?

You need to write an application (C program) with one function called main. For your program, we need to provide you with a function that takes a number, m (0 < m < 10). We encourage to call the function in the main function so the input/output (I/O) happens only once per line. (In the program we are interested in the final result, not exactly how you get it.) You only need to modify the provided template.\n\nThis is the main function template:\n\n```C\nint main(int argc, char const *argv[]) { int i, n, m, j; char c;\n    for (i = 1; i < argc; i++) {\n        n = atoi(argv[i]); m = atoi(argv++; argc - i);\n        for (j = n; j > m; j--) putchar('#');\n```\n#### Instruction:Please include an explicit return statement in your main function in the final program. It should return something. We encourage you to print out or otherwise render the final expression in the main function so that we can look at it for debugging. Also, as a nice bonus to you, you will see the exact expression that was entered by John! That means, no guesswork! You only need to implement a function that takes two arguments: number of lines and number of zebras (which is 1-based, so 0 represents there are no zebras in the pool).\n#### Instruction:You must implement the function \u2018zebra-pool\u2019. You should pass in the arguments as separate C-style strings and you should assume they are null terminated. You should use strlen to find the length of each string. The function may or may not be static. You can write the code in any form you like. But please be consistent and also comment your code. Your code needs to work for the input:315\n#### Instruction:There are several ways to approach the problem. You may use a \u2018countdown\u2019 sort of method or a nested-loop method.

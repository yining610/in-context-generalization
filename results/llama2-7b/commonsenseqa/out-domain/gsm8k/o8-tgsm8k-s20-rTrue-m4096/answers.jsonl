Choices: A: radiant heat and cold radiation, electromagnetic and gravitational B: kinetic, potential and mechanical energy C: mechanical, radiant and thermal D: radiant, mechanical and chemical E: electromagnetic, radiant and kinetic\nOutput: First, it is important to note that not all forms of energy are known as energy. An object can have energy but in different forms. This means that not all forms of this energy can be used for work. Potential energy is stored energy, which causes force to be able to do certain things. Potential energy includes gravitational, elastic, and stored elastic potential energy. Mechanical energy is an interesting topic to learn. Mechanical energy tells the amount of an object\u2019s kinetic energy plus the potential energy that the object has. Kinetic energy is created whenever an object is put in motion. Lastly, thermal energy is not typically a form of energy in use, but thermal energy helps you stay at a certain heat. All things must be constantly supplied with energy to function properly. If we do not have enough energy to work efficiently, then everything stops. The earth receives two main sources of energy, which are the sun and radioactivity that exists within the core of the earth, so we can gain the energy supply that we need to run all our appliances and processes. It would be in our best interest to harness this supply of energy to prevent the depletion of energy.

The players on team 1 take the first turn. On the second turn, player 7 on team 2 takes possession of the ball. Players in this game are assigned numbers instead of names, and number 1 for team 1 is on the left side of the court and number 2 is on the left side. Number 7 for team 2 is on the right side of the court.\n\nThe rule is that when ball possession changes, that player passes to the next player on his/her own position. For example, if number 7 takes possession, he passes the ball right away to number 8, because number 7 is number 8 for his team.\n\nIn order to figure out the number for the two teams that will have the ball at the end of the game, we need to determine the position of number 7 for Team 1 and the position of number 8 for Team 2.\nWhen the ball goes to team 1, it means that teams are battling for possession. So when this happens, the position of number 1 for Team 1 will change in the following way: 1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 4 --> 5 --> 6 --> 1.\n\nIt should be obvious now that the position of number 2 for Team", "answer": "E: big house"}

They split the cost of the groceries, but Tapanga paid extra because she always does this. The groceries cost 67 dollars in total. If Tapanga paid half of the price of groceries and Corey paid the rest, how much money did he pay?\nOutput:Corey and Tapanga each had equal numbers of groceries, each with a cost of 67 dollars.\nTapanga paid half of Corey's costs, that is, Corey paid half of Tapanga's cost, and Tapanga paid half her costs.\nSo Corey also paid half his costs and Tapagna paid half her costs\nLet x = the total cost of Corey's groceries\nThen Corey paid half of x, and Tapanga also paid half of x\nSo Corey paid x / 2 + x / 2 = <<x/2+x/2=x>>x dollars, and Tapanga's groceries cost 33.5 (x / 2) dollars.\nIn other words, Corey and Tapanga paid 67 - 33.5 = <<67-33.5=33.5>>33.5 dollars.\nSo the final result is 33.5\n\nInput:There are 6 oranges and 3 lemons.

Which of these combinations of colors is impossible to paint all 4 small walls?\nOutput: The wall with the least area is the two walls adjacent to the window since the wall next to the door is longer than the wall adjacent to the window. The wall opposite the window will have the least wall space, since one of the walls will be adjacent to the window so there is only 2x9-2x4= <<6-2=4>>4 free wall spaces. The wall with the second least space will be adjacent to the door and next to the wall opposite the window, as well as next to the 4 foot wall. This means there will be 2x10 - 2x9 = <<2-9=7>>7 free wall spaces. Since one of the walls cannot be painted with both of the desired colors, the colors cannot be blue, green and orange. However, blue or green and orange and green are possible combinations; the green and blue combination makes use of 5 free wall spaces.\nSo the final  answer is green and blue\n\nInput: The number of people in a church varies from month to month.

{"idx": 239, "text": "In order to decide the best answer to the question, \"What is the best way to learn?\", it is important to determine the best value out of a value set and then compare the best values in the value set. For example, one way of learning is \"learning is free \", which is one option. The more the people get to enjoy learning free of cost. \"learning is very important\" is another example. The more the people consider learning as a very important aspect of their life.  There are some factors which determine the final answer. One factor is whether the learning process is free or not. The other is whether it is very important or not. By considering both factors, one gets to know that the best choice is \"learning is very important, however, learning should be free\".

For this particular survey which method of calculation, mean or median, best determined how many hours students spend reading? Choices:  I. Mean II. Median  A: I B: II\nOutput: It is very important to learn about the concept which is given as a question. In this question, the concept is about the comparison of mean and median. To determine the answer we can follow the steps as follows: We see that the mean number of hours that students spend reading per day is 1.5 times that of the median number of hours. Let us see what would be the outcome of the calculation of the above sentence. What if we consider the average (mean) of the number of hours per day spent by students in reading. Then, if we compare the average with that of the median the question will be answered as B. The median number of hours per for students to spend reading is 1 and if we consider the average  (mean) of reading hours per day it is 3 hours. Hence the statement says 1.5 is greater than 1.\nSo the final option will be B.  Median\nInput: Seth and Irene are at the airport. Seth has 4326 miles of credit and spends $1.33 cents per mile.

What kind of mathematical formula should we use to describe something that can't be expressed in ordinary mathematical terms, but has been expressed beautifully in the problem?\nOutput: This question is asking for the formula for the area of a rectangular room with only notebooks.

L is obviously the length of the hole, but what is the width of the hole? Well, we know the hole will be overflowing with notebook if we are putting in enough notebooks to fill the hole completely. So we can use P to represent the percentage of notebooks put into the hole. Then it is easy to see that the width of the hole will be the length of the notebooks in the number of notebook put in divided by the number of notebook needed to fill a hole completely.\nThe", "answer": "B: house"}

They cut the other tomatoes in half, and used one half from each to dress the lettuce. How many lettuce leaves were used?\nOutput: Initially, each man takes <5>/50>1/2 of a tomato. This yields <<1/5>>1/5 tomatoes. At this stage, <4>4 lettuces leaves remain, so 5 tomato halves are needed, which leaves one half uneaten, representing <1>/2>-1/2 tomatoes, so <5>/50=><<(1/5)+((-1/2)>> +(1/2).\n\nThe remaining tomatoes are halved once, thus yielding <5/4>>-1/4 lettuce leaves, leaving one half uneaten. One half is then also cut in half, giving a total of <3/2>>-1/2 lettuce leaves. Finally, we have <4>/4>>1/2 lettuce left uneaten.\nThe solution uses the following equation:\nA = 8 + 2 + 7 + 4 + 9\nB = 1 + (-1/2 ) + (-1/4) + 1/2\nC = (2*8) + (3*7) + ((4*9)\nD = (5*2) + (6*3)\nE = (A+B+C+D)\nFinal answer is <<E=40>>40\n\nInput: There is an empty 10-gallon container.

{"idx": 385, "text": "This question contains 5 choices. If we are to look over the choices, the only choices that are phrased in present tense are: A (home team), B (at home), and E (charming). The phrases \"Because he doesn't want to stay,\" \"where,\" \"goes away,\" etc, are not phrased in present tenses. Therefore, we know that the answer should lie between \"home team,\" \"home,\" or \"go.\" So:\nChoice (A) \"home team = \"home,\" which means the home team will be charming.\nChoice (B) \"home = \"go\" -> if Billy were to go home, then he would be charming, but if he did not go home, then he was still staying at home.\nChoice (D) \"come back = \"go\" -> We know the answer lies somewhere in the middle, so if we subtract each choice from this list, we get three remaining choices. This is the only choice that is not a multiple. So:\nChoice (C) \"at home = \"go\" -> Billy is at \"home,\" which is \"home,\" so he is staying at home. \"at home = \"gone,\" so Billy has gone away from his home.\nWe may think, \"This answer is too simple!\" Let's look closely at the wording of this question to see if we can find another answer.\n\"Why isn't Billy staying at home.\" So the answer should lie between the two options of \"home\" and \"staying at home.\" What about the choices of \"charming\" and \"team\"?\n\"Billy doesn't want to be staying at home, but he doesn't want not to be able to be charming in his life's mission. Charming is at Billy, and that is where he will be.\"\n\"But Billy doesn't want not beable to stay at home, so the team of charmers has Billy to lead them to a place of home.\"\nThen our final answer is Choice (E)\nSo the final answer here is: E\n\nInput: You own a red car and a blue truck.

Since there is \u00a30 left, she must have an even number in her account. For even number, we can either add 1 or subtract 1. Her account is \u00a38 and we subtract 0 since we can have an even number when subtracting or adding 1. Her account was either \u00a38-1 or \u00a38+1. Jodie needed to take \u00a34 from her friend. The amount from Jodie's friend should be equal to the amount of what is left in Jodie's account.\nJodie has \u00a38-1 in her account\nJodie needed to take 4\nSo the final answer, if Jodie takes 4 from her friend, she has \u00a38-1 and she should be ok.\n\nInput: You have a 210 gram bag of sugar and you want to use 4/5 of it for a cookie recipe.

What does he need to spend if the total cost of one cheese and one bread is 3 euros? Choices: 2 euros 5 euros 10 euros 30 euros 60 euros\nOutput: Here you only need to solve for a value that leaves one variable with value less than 3 and a second variable with value greater than 3.\n\nEconomists know that the cost of one 200-gram cheese and one 200 gram bread together costs 3 euros.\nWe find 200*5 = 1000, so the cost of a bread or cheese is 1/1000 * 3 = 0. 3 euros. \nYou cannot buy bread if it is less than 1/10th of the price of the cheese. \nTherefore, bread costs 10 euros.\n\nYou can buy a cheese for 2/5ths of the price of bread: cheese costs 2/5 * 10 = 4 euros. \nTherefore 1/500 * 3 for bread is = 0.60\nTherefore, the cheese costs 4 * 0.60 = 2.40 euros.\nThe cheese costs 2.40 * 3, so the sum is 7.20 euros.\nSo the final answers are 10 for the bread and 7.20 for the cheese.\n\nInput: I have two 1-liter candles and one 750 liters candle. \nAltogether, they equal 1.75 liters.

If the first digit is multiplied by 3 and the second digit is multiplied by -1, then add the result to the first number (not 85) to get the new two-digit number. For example, if the first digit of the two-digit number is 6 and the second digit is 8, then (6 X 3) X (-1) = 6 X (-1) = (-6) X 3 = -18. Adding 6 back to 85 would give 91. In what two-digit number should the digit 9 appear twice?\nOutput: Let's start with a number that doesn't have 9 in it, so it doesn't work for this question.\n\nEx 1: Suppose that 91 is the two digit number. Then the 9s must multiply to -18.\n\nEx 2: Suppose that 46 is the two digit number, or any number divisible by 9.\nThen 9 * -1 = -9\nThen 4 * -9 = 36\nSo 36 + 4 = 40\n\nSo the answer is either a or b for this problem.\n\nInput: Given the following code, determine the length of the array\nint size=9;\nchar[] myarray;\nmyarray={'a','b','c','d','e','f','g','h','i'};\nint length = myarray.length;\nOutput: The length of the array is 10.\nSo the final answe is 10\nInput: Aaron purchased an orange for $3.75 when the price of the orange increased to $4.50 the next week.

{"idx": 630, "text": "Combining words always requires an auxiliary word and the word to be combined. The auxiliary word is a, e, i, o, u or y. The pronoun is a, an, any, all, both, each, either, one, or some. The preposition is usually located between the words being combined.\nIn English, the most common words being combined are nouns and verbs. Nouns can be combined with verbs without using prepositions, such as a noun and verb combination is usually made using a pronoun such as him or her. Adjectives and Adverbs are combined with nouns with the aid of pronouns and prepositions; for example: a noun such as beautiful is combined with the adjective beautiful to become beautiful.\nIf a pronoun or a verb is the subject of a sentence, no preposition is necessary. If an adjective or an adverb is the subject of a verb, a preposition is normally necessary. However, when an adverb is the object of a verb, no preposition is required.\nTherefore, the answer is (D)\n\nInput:Jane had a cat, a dog, and a goldfish.

A research company wants to compile this into a usable format so they call in a research analyst. The analyst is able to process 1 million pieces of data from the excel sheet a week. His assistant takes his job of processing the data a week after. The assistant is able to process 2/3 of the data the analyst processes in a week. Both men work every other week. How many pieces of data will have been processed by the two men when they stop working?\n\nOutput:The analyst can process 1 million pieces/week * 4 weeks = <<1,000,000/week*4=4,000, 000>>4,000 pieces in a month\nThe assistant can process 1 million/3 = <<1,0,000,/3=333,333>>333 pieces/month\nEach work on alternate weeks\nThe analyst works for 2 months and then the assistant works for 2 months (4 weeks * 2 months = 8 months, or 2 weeks * 4 months = 8 months = 2 months\nSo the analyst works for a total of 4 months and then the assistant handles the data for another 4 months\n(4,000 + 333)* 2 = <<4000+333*2=4331>>4331 pieces have been processed\nSo the final answer was 4331\n\nInput: A number cube is rolled 6 times.

From the 300 people that participated in the study, 60% of the people volunteered to answer a series of phone calls. After the 300 participants answered phone calls, 150 of the participants volunteered to take a survey asking questions about their personality. After taking the survey, 109 of the participants volunteered.\nThe researcher was interested in determining the characteristics of these 109 participants.  Determine the number  of participants that did not volunteer to answer phone calls nor to take the survey.\nOutput:To calculate the number of participants that did not participate in the study, let x be the number of participants.\nAt 60% of x, 60% = <<60%=0.6>>0.6 x people would participate in the study.\nAt 40% of x, the participants who did not volunteer would be x/0.4 = <<x/4>>4 times x/0.6.\nSo the number of participants that volunteered will be x/0.6 \u2013 x/0.4, which reduces to ((x \u2013 0.6x)/4) \u2013 x/0.6 = <<((x-0.6x)/3>>3/4 \u2013 x/0.06 = <<5x-x/0.6>>5x/12 \u2013 x/0.12 = <<5x/12>>30/12 \u2013 6 = <<30/12-6>>24/12 \u2013 24/12 = <<24/12-24/12>>- 0 participants.\nSince the researcher asked all 300 people to participate, subtracting 0 from 300 tells us that only 40% of the people did not volunteer to participate in this study.\nSo the final  answer will 40.\n\nInput:There are 2723 students at the New", "answer": "D: agony"}

For example, orange is connected to red by a ratio of 1/4.2 and yellow is connected to orange by 4.2/2.2. Find the ratio between the amount of red and yellow in a crayon rainbow.\nOutput: Using 198 as the total quantity of crayons, we find an equation for the ratio between colors.\nOrange is connected to red by 1 to 4, so it has a fractional portion of 0.25.\nWe can replace the first fractional portion with a decimal portion: 0.25=.25. (The remainder is dropped).\nThen, we find the fractional portion of yellow and its corresponding decimal portion, so it is connected to orange by a ratio of fractional parts so our equation is:\n\nRed = 0/.25 = 0\n\nyellow = 0.25/3 =.08.\nSo the color ratio is:\n\nRed yellow = 0:0.08 =.08\nSo the final answer for the color ratio is.08\n\nInput:There are 30 cars on the road from 1 pm to 3 pm\nThe number of cars that pass from A to B: Choices:  A : C B : D <<  A:C & B:D >>\nOutput: We can solve this question mathematically, or we can simply observe the question and realize that a car can either be traveling from A (the time of 1 pm) to B (the time of 3 pm), or else it can be traveling from A to C (one-fourth of the way there), and then from C to B (the rest of the way).

How many did the one woman say she was not married to?\nOutput: The initial question:\nThe woman doesn't have to say if she is married or not to anyone so we assume she is married to him\nFirstly, as they get married, one man and one woman get off the boat, so there are 2 woman and 2 men on the boat before getting married\nThen, after the man and woman got married, 2 more people got on to the boat\nSo, the woman can't be the other woman with 2 man, so it must be the original woman. 1 woman 3 men\nSo the original woman can be either man 2 or man 3, since they could both be man 3, we make the woman 2 and men to be 3,4\nAltogether, the original two had 3 and 4, we can make the man 4 marry man 3, and woman 2 marry man 3 too\nThen, both women became man 3's wife, so the original two women are 3 and 4\n\nLet's recap:\nMan 3, the one who married woman 4, initially married 3\nWoman 3, who married man 4, initially married woman 2\nWoman 4, who married man 3, initially married man 3\nMan 3, who married woman 4 but also previously married woman 2, originally had 3 wives\nMan 4, who previously married woman 3, originally had 4 wives\nTogether, the two man originally had 3 wifes, and the two women in total had 4 wifes", "answer": "B: two ears"}

What number can you add to 1529 to get as a result 1556 which is divisible by 7?\nOutput: If you add zero <<0>> to any whole number, the whole number cannot be divisible by seven. Since seven, the sum of the whole number does not have to end with seven. Therefore, 1529 + 0 is 1529 which is not divisible by 7.\nWe need a number that can add to our existing number and we get our number divisible by 7 if we add that number.\nThe number that we are multiplying by should be seven.\nThe first step to figure out what number to multiply to 152 that makes our number divisible by seven.\nMultiplying this by seven is to get our answer.\nMultiplying 152 by 7 is 1054 which is divisible by seven. There can be more than one answer for example 152*7=1054.\n1054+152=1206\n1206 is divisible by seven because seven is one of its prime factors.\nSo, the final result is 152*9=1368. The prime factors of 1368 includes 3, 7, 13, 21. Thus, 1368 is divisible by seven, thus the final answer is 0 because 1368 + 0 = 1368 which is divisible by seventeen\n\nInput: There is 47 students in our class. 23 of the students are above average, and 17 are below average, 7 students have an A average, 8 students have a B average, and 14 students have a C average.

His dog can reach 30 feet. How much rope can the man use to reach the same length as his dog?\nOutput:First cut the rope in half (10 feet). Now the man has only 10 feet of rope and the dog has 30 feet.\nThe man's dog can reach 3o feet; that's 1 more than the man's 29 feet. That means that the man needs more rope so he can get his 30 feet. But the man only has 10 feet of extra rope, so he is at 10 feet.\nHe cut this 10 feet in half to make 5 feet. His dog cut the 3 feet to make that 2 feet. Now the man has 3 feet left, but so does the dog.\nThat's how he can have 30 feet when the man only has 20 feet.\nSo the final answe should be 11\n\nInput: A man stands on a tree looking up at a cloud.

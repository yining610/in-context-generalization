Every week there are 266 miles between the two cities and the plane travels at the speed of light. How long will the trip take?\nOutput: 0\nWhen dealing with subtraction, the first step is to figure out which value you get when you subtract both values.\nFor example, we will be subtracting 200 from 250. To do this, let's set up a number line, as shown below.\n(69,70) + (69, 69,71)\n\n69 to the left, 70 and 71 to the right. Next, we need to mark that the number on the left is larger than the number on the right.\nTo do this, simply place 60 in the middle of your numbers.\nWe can now subtract 195 from 250 by counting down one from the right. This means subtracting 0, then 1, then 3, and then counting down again so that you only subtract one from the right of the numbers. This produces the number 55.\nTo make the answer negative, you have to reverse the sign on both numbers you are subtracting. In this case, the numbers we did not subtract are 195 and 70.\nBy reversing the signs on both of these, the answer is negative 125.\n\nInput: What does it mean to add 100 to (-4)?\nOutput: -60\nAdding any number to a negative number will make that number positive.

In the second input, after assigning values to variables, the program calculates and displays the result.\n\nIt is important to follow the rules of the if-else statement, where the condition must be expressed as a test for the true or false nature of the condition being checked;\n\nAn if-else statement has the following form:\n\n\tif ( <test for true or false nature of condition>): # do things\n\telse: # do other things\n\nThe rules for switch-case are similar; switch statements are conditional statements and they help in a choice of more than", "answer": "C: small group"}

You need to understand the concept of \"merge\" in data structure. I'll explain the concept with the data structure.\n\nIn Python, the merge is a function which will give one list object.\n\nSo, the concept is: Merging means two data structure must be in 1 list/array.\n\nHere the two list is nachos. So, you need to give your own list to get merged. First, you decide the starting point.\n\nThe key is that you must understand the value of each object in nachos. So, each object in nachos represents each number the \"starting value\".\n\nNow, we need to determine the end value of a list. In our case, we use the next item.\n\nEach starting value must be >= next item value. But, you can decide the ending value as well. (I just add it to \"sum\".)\n\nYou can use 2 for/next loop in Python.\n\nIn the main function, using 2 data structure, you can print the value inside that will be the \"time\".\n\n#### 2.

We know our total input is n+1.\nBut after printing n elements, we are not printing 1 because we get into this loop again.\nHow come?\n\n2. Does the order of recursion matter? Why?\n\n3. If you have a 1D array, why would you think that the index of the element in the stack is the same as the element in the stack?\nIf you are using a 1D array as the root, why does the element in the stack point to the same index as the array?\n4. The output I think is 0.  Since if I increment one in the array, the value of the top element becomes the topmost element, \nwhich is incremented by one and pushed to the stack. So, ultimately, we move from 0th element to 1st element and the output should be zero not one.\n5. How do you know the stack holds 2 and 3? and the stack is correct?\n\n6. In the first for loop, I think the index will be changed to 3, but in the second for while loop, it will be changing to 2 which is one greater than 1. \nWhy is that? When we store 1 in the variable i and increment the variable i. When will we store 1 in j and increment j?\n\n7. I think j is 4 because 4 is what is returned. \n```\nj = j + n\nj = j - 1\nj = n + 1\n```\nThis should be done for every time the loop runs.\n8. To keep the count of the elements in stack the element i stores at index i which will start from 0 and ends at 4.\nNext i will store 1, then j will store 2, then k will store 3, then finally at k the stack will get emptied.\n9.

You know three numbers, their product is 24, and their sum is 21. Using this information as well information from the question, find the last remaining number.\nOutput: 2 or 4\n\nInput: What was the original sum with the largest possible product?\n\nInput: The number is 4296.  The product of the first two digits of the number is 64, so the first two digits are either 6 or 4.  If the product of those digits isn\u2019t a multiple of 9, then there is no missing digit.  In this case, there is only one missing digit, so the middle two digits of the number must be the remaining digit.  Therefore, the missing digit cannot be a 4.  The product of all of the digits of the number is given by factoring it out: \n24 * 17 + 2 * 3 * 4 + 3 * 3 * 3 + 96 = 72 * 17 +  6 * 54 +  9 * 27 + 432 = 1214\n12 * 12 + 6 * 6 * 4 * 4 * 12 = 144\nSo the answer is (4296 \u2013 (4 * 6)), or 4248.\n\nInput: There is a new school in town, and all the kids there have names starting with the same letter of the alphabet.

A number such as 15 is divisible by numbers other than 1 and 15 itself. So 15 is not prime. An example of a prime number is 13. Since 13 is divisible only by 1 and 13, it is prime. We can use Euclid's division algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers. A number of digits equal to the sum of the digits of the larger number divided by the number of digits of the smaller number equals the greatest common number between the two numbers given that the operation is done for each digit. The following are examples of how it can be applied: [8,8,8,18] -> 2 If we apply the algorithm to the given numbers, we will get [7,4,1,1]. From these numbers we can find the greatest common divisio of each digit to each other. 7: 7:6:3:6 [6,", "answer": "B: in motion"}

Also, since we want the variable to be `dollars` and be a float.\n\nThen for the next problem `input = float(round((input + int(input) - 2 * round(input))/6))`, we are doing this since we want the variable input to be a float. Since math is done in python when you use int(x) this is what it really does to the variable it is looking for values that can be expressed as a natural number.

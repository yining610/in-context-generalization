The fraction, 7/9, can be reduced by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the LCM of the numerator and the denomenator, which is 3. By rewriting the mixed fraction 7/9 as a division problem, 7/9 = 7/9 = <<7/9=7/9>>7/9, we can simplify the fraction. This simplifies the mixed fraction to the equivalent fraction 1 // 3.\nOutput: 7/9 = <7/9=7/(9*3) >>7/(9*3).\nThis simplifies to 7/9 = ((7/9)*3)/(9*3) = 1//((9*3))\nFollowing the same steps from above, we have 1/3 < >>1/3 == 1//3.\nSo, we are done.\n\nInput: This is a fraction, where the numerator is 6, and the denominator is 4. We can reduce the fraction by multiplying the numerotor by the denominator.

The larger number will be the second number added after the smaller number. Choices:  A) 44 B) 60 C) 76 D) 72 E) 56\nOutput: \"A\" is the answer because the process of adding two numbers together is to start with the smaller number first, then add 2, then add the next number.  The larger number will be what's left after you have subtracted 2.  So by looking at the choices, 44 would be the smaller number, and the larger number would be 72 in this case.  You end up with 28 in the end, which is the answer.\nThe answer is \"A\" because you start by subtracting 2 as the first step and then you move onto adding the next number in after subtracting 2.\nThe smaller number becomes the larger number and then your goal is to subtract 2 from your new number, and then you end up with your final answer.\nSo you want to subtract 2 from the first number, which will leave you with 42. Then you would add 2, and then you would subtract 2 again.  When you subtract 2 from 42 you get 40.  This is the final answer.\n\nInput: If Tina is 4 years", "answer": "B: have fun"}

How likely is it that at least 1 person will have an IQ above 150?\nOutput: There are 100 persons in the current sample. Of those, 25 have a birth-year ending with 2.  Of those 25, 70% have above-average IQ's. Therefore, 95 individuals in the current sample have an IQ of 150 or more. There are 10 people born in other years.  Two have IQs of  150 or greater.\n1/2 = <<1/2=0.5>>0.5 = probability that 1 person will have IQ above 115\nThe number of persons in the current sample with IQ above 160: 95*70% = <<95*70%=67>>67\nThe probability that a person born in 1980 has an IQ of  above 160 is [(67/102)/100] x [(60/98)/12] x [(", "answer": "B: music shop"}

When you ask locals which department store they\u2019re going to shop at, many say the Target store in Idaho falls.  One reason might be that Idaho Falls is only a short ride away from Boise.  Another is that the Target store in Idah falls has less advertising in their checkout lanes to convince shoppers to buy something there.  Let\u2019s add some columns to our table to learn more about these two stores.  Each column counts the number of times people say they\u2019re going to a store or mall in a location.  The two stores are in different cities, so both stores have a chance to attract people who need a store that is near them. A survey shows, however, that the advertising levels differ between the stores. In total, 47% of shoppers say the Target in Idah falls has more ads, while 14% says the ad levels are lower.  Let\u2019s count the number of shoppers for each store. (Remember that we added some columns at the top of column A and B to keep track of whether they are from the city of Boise or the town of Idaho falls.)

If we are talking in music terms, 'D' is 'Dexterity', 'A' is 'Practice', 'K' if 'Knowledge', and 'C' is 'Conductor'.\nSo you have either 'A' or 'D' and if you say 'D', you're off with a fiddley. If you say 'A', the conductor will probably not like you if you are playing violin or viola.\n\nTo make sure the 'A' is the right thing, let's find out what 'D' means: Dextrous means'skillful'. So if you are dextrous, you are skillful. That sounds a bit technical and in music terms I prefer 'Dexterity'. You can tell me your thoughts and I can take the best answer from the two.\n\nInput: The 2010 NBA playoffs started with 16 teams and went through a best-of-seven series to identify the conference and league champion teams.  The conference champions faced each other in the best-of-seventh series for the NBA championship.  How many total games were played in the 2010 playoffs?\nOutput: There are 16*16=<<16*16>65536>655,360 total possible games that teams can play in the playoffs.

How much money will Alice have in her bank account at the start of the next week?\nOutput: Tax withheld from Alice is $45 per week i.e. $1/60 $/wk or $45/60 of her weekly wage.\nTax withheld from Alice = $1000 * $45/645\nSince tax withheld from Alice takes up a smaller fraction, we can write it as 1000 * 0.60 / 64.5\nThis means that the total amount of money Alice earned in her wage is $1000 + $45 / 64.35\nSo Alice earned $1044.85 in her wage, which leaves $5.15 in her account.\nSo the final  answer is $1044\n\nInput: A 1080-square-foot room", "answer": "B: welcome change"}

{"idx": 467, "text": "I think he should build one himself, because that is the fastest and cheapest way to get one for him.\nSo the final choice is option B\n\nInput:The speed of a person is proportional to the force exerted on the person.  A stronger person can carry a greater load faster than a weaker person because he or she experiences less resistance.  A weaker person will also need to exert more force in order to carry the same load.  A stronger person only experiences the weight of the load - he does not experience the same drag.  So force will equal weight divided by two in order for the load to be carried as fast.  How much force should the weaker person give in order to carry a load of mass three times her own mass as quickly as the stronger person?\nOutput: A stronger person only experiences drag on the load, not the load itself, so he will expend 2 * weight of object = <<2*weight=2weight>>2weight, not weight, from his force.\nA weaker person experiences both force from his weight and from the load he carries, so he will expnd <<weight+load>>weight+load, not just weight.\nThe amount of force that the stronger person will exert is only 2 * weight of the object since he experiences no force from the load he caries.  The amount of force that the weaker person will exert is (weight + load), since (weight + load) is the force he applies to the object.\nThe stronger person will be able to carry the load as fast as the weaker person if he or she gives 2 * weight of loads = <<2*weight=-2weight>>-2weight as much force as the weaker person.  We can see that the weaker person must be more powerful than the stronger person in order to do this, because more force = negative value of force.\nSo the final solution is that the weaker person needs to be more powerful than the taller person in order for both of them to be able to carry the same load as fast.\n\nInput:I was able to put together 29 puzzle pieces today.

How many tricks will I need to win three games?\nOutput: You need to play 7 + 6 = 13 tricks to win three games.\nBecause 13 tricks is an even number, the answer must be odd.\nBecause 5 and 7 are odd, the answer is not 5 or 7.\nThe only even number that is not 5 or one of the odd numbers is 1.\nHence, the answer is 1.\n\nInput:What has 9 fingers but is left-handed?Choices: A: A clock B: A spoon C: A glove D: A hand E: Nothing\nOutput: The answer is \"nothing\" since it cannot be both.

A glove is something that protects your hand from cold, not vice versa.\nA hand usually does not have 9 fingers, but some people have their ring finger and pinky fingers separate (there is a picture of John Adams missing his pinky finger, for example). A clock with this number of fingers would be 9/2 left-handed, which is not possible.\nAdditionally, a glove is something you put", "answer": "D: injuries"}

He goes to the gym every Saturday and Sunday at 8:00pm.  He plans to run for 6 miles each Sunday, and cycle for 2 miles each Saturday.  John will also have 100 push ups daily, and lift 50lbs (over shoulder) daily.  How much weight does John plan on losing from this exercise schedule?\nOutput:To lose weight, you must burn more calories than you consume.  This is a good rule of thumb.  John is eating 2,000 calories.  He burns 1,000 cal with running and cycling, plus an additional 100 calories with each set of push-ups and in lifting weights.  He will continue this program until he loses a minimum of 12 lbs, based on an average of 2 lbs lost per week by cycling and running.   He will lose more calories by doing push-ups and lifting weights, so he ends up with 14.5 lbs lost per week.  We can see he will lose 14.5*5 = <<14.5*6=82>>82 lbs over the course of the month.\nSo the final solution should be 82\n\nInput:If you were going camping for a month with four friends, and each was planning on bringing three cans of food, what is the maximal capacity", "answer": "B: orchestra"}

The other two customers both buy a large pizza for $32, each adding a different mix of drinks. One customer places an order of a large drink and a small pizza, paying $24 total. The other customer buys a small drink, pays $12. At what time did the two customers place their orders if they did not wait in line?\nOutput: It is happy hour so all the people that place an order at 5:05 pay a total of $19 (2 people * 5 + 2 people * 19), or $19(255+120), or $19.25. They will all be billed $19.25, and the restaurant will only have to account for the 255 customers for 1 minute and 20 seconds (~ 1.2%).\nOn the other hand, none of the customers at 5:03 or after will pay anything, because they all waited in line long enough to not place an order before 2:00, where happy hour was due to end.\nBased on the number of minutes it took to receive 255 orders, one can calculate that the customers ordering at 5:04 to 5:05 will receive their order a second before the hour ends.\nSo with this, you can tell that there are too many customers.\nThe last person to place an order, the one at 5:06, will not receive theirs until the hour is 5:00 past.\nSo", "answer": "B: in motion"}

Explain how you reached your solution.\nOutput: The probability that the runner will win for the next time can be found: Probability can be calculated using equation: Probability = R/N\nLet us now determine that first order of probability, N, and what R will be.\nIf the runner wins once, the probability that he will win a second time is 17/95 = <<17/95=17.7823529411765>>17.78%\nIt is now given that the probability that the runner wins next 1 time is found by subtracting one times his chance of winning the first time which is 17.78 from the probability of him winning the second time, which is 17/(95-1)\nProbability of winning after 1 time = 17/94 = <<17/100=17.000000>>17.00%\nIn 1 run, a runner can win maximum 2 times.\nTherefore, the probability of him winning a third time is 15/92 = <<15/90=16.67>>16.70%\nTherefore, the runner has a 16.70 times out of 100 chance of winning.\n\nInput:  You go to the store with your friend Jim.

All of the apples are in a bag, but if they are removed one by one, the total value of all apples which are left in the bag will remain the same. However, if you remove 2 apples from a bag of 20, you will cause a decrease in the total value of the remaining apples. What is the value of all the remaining apples in the bag in the best case scenario when the rest of apples are removed?\nOutput: When the remaining value of all apples is taken, it is the sum of the values of individual apples. If all the apples in the bag are equal. The sum of their value is (1+2+3+...+n-1) where n is the total number of apples. In this case it is 62 and n=60. So the sum of all apples value is 62 * (1+2+...+59) = <<62*60=3620>>3620\nHence, the remaining value of apple is (3620) / 60 = <<3620/60=60>60\nSo the final value of apple 60\nInput: A large group was traveling together.

If the check has between 110 - 990, then the probability of the check being less than $4097$ is $1/990$, since $4097 > 990$. If the check's number is between 1001 and 1199, then the probability of drawing another such check is $1/1100$, so the probability is $0.00909090$.\nSo, the final choice is B.\n\nInput: Jane and Bill were in a heated argument last night when she told him he was \"a big dork.\" At 20 years old, Bill's height is 6 feet 7 inches, with a weight of 180 pounds.

After she gets pregnant, the average gestation period is 37 weeks or 9 months.  How many weeks after Samantha got pregnant did she give birth to her baby girl?\nOutput: The days per week Samantha got preggers = 7 = 7\nAnd the days per pregnancy = 37 = 37\nThe pregnancy is 9 months.\nThis means that Samantha got pregregated during 7*37 = <<7*37=259>>259 days\nAnd gave birth to her baby after that 259*7 =<<259*7=1863>>1863 days\nThis therefore means she gave birth on the 259*0.7 = <<259*0=179.3>>179th day\nWe subtract the average gestation period = 37 from that 259 to get 220\nWe multiply that 220 by 7 to get 1540\n1540 is the number of days after the girl was born.  Since 259 gives us the amount of time of the pregnancy, by subtracting 220 from 259 we get 39 which takes up 9 of those 37 days of the average gestation time\nSo the number of days until they were born was 259 - 220 = <<259-220=39>>39\nOr 39 weeks\nSo the final answer was 39 weeks\n\nInput: Rani is a vegetarian.

By how much would you have to lengthen her hair to make it unlikely to brush against her specs?\nOutput: She had been looking for her specs all morning. She brushed 10 times. The number of chances for a hair to get stuck to the tip is 3600/10 = <<3600/7=520>>520 * 3 = <<520*3=1640>>1640 times.\nSince she found the hair stuck on the tip in the 10th try, the number of tries she must make to avoid it happening again is 3601/3602.\nIf we want to estimate the number of times Lily must brush her hair, we can replace 10 with this new number (2900/(3601/2901)).\nThis is 999/136746 = <<999/181542>>198742.\nWhen we round to the nearest digits, we get 198740.\nSo the length of Lily's hair should be lengthened by at least 1987 meters.\nSo the final result is 1987\n\nInput: If X people eat 28450 calories when they are hungry, and X/2 (hungry) people don't eat while they are hungry, how many people do not eat while they are hungr?\nOutput: We are given that X people, when hungry, eat 28400 cal, and X/2 do not.\nWe will call the number of people that do not eat while they're hungry by the variable P.\nThen: P = 2845 -", "answer": "A: new experiences"}

I drink 1 and 2 cans of regular cans, 2 cans of tall cans, and 1 can of a special type of cans each day.  How do the three types of cans compare by unit volume?\nOutput: As the 1 can of the special cans were the smallest, it's volume cannot be compared to the volumes of the 1 and 2 of a regular cans because the volume of a special type of a cans are much smaller than that of a regular cans. Hence the 1 can of special cans have to be removed from comparisons with the rest of cans altogether.\nThe same case goes for the 1 and 0 of can of a tall cans.  Hence the 0 of the tall cans have to be moved out of comparisons with the rest.\nThe volume of 1 regular can (r) and 2 tall cans (t) can be compared together.  As it turns out, the volume of the 1 regular can (4/3 in3 * r) is much larger than that of the 2 tall cans.  The volume of the 2 tall was (4/3 in.3 * r / 3). As it turns out, it's volume is very close to that of the regular can.\nHowever, volume of a special cans (1/6 in3 * s) is much smaller than that of the 1 regular of can. In fact, the volume of a special can is less than 1/5 of the volume of a regular cans and it's too small to be compared to the volumes between the volumes of the 2 tall and the regular can.\nAs it turns out, the total volume of the 3 types of the cans are 4/3 in3/r, 4/3 in 3 /t and 1/6 in3/s.

When they first received their math books, 18 of the students found mistakes in the books. The next week, 6 more students found mistakes in their books. This time there were 18 students who found no mistakes. How many students have only found a single mistake in their books so far?\nOutput: The total number of students that received their books was 36.\n\nFrom here, we can subtract out the number of students who found two or more mistakes.\n36 - (18 + 18) = 36 - 36 = 0\n\nWe were told that 18 students in total found two or more mistakes in their books. Since one student had found a single mistake, and we're only left with 18 students who had found two or more mistakes, the remaining students had only found a single mistake.\nThat means there are 18 students who have only found one mistake in their books.\nSo the final number is 18\n\nInput: How many minutes are there in 100 years?\nOutput: 60 * 60 * 24 * 365 * 100 = 21,600,000.\nSo the time we have to work with is the total of 21,160,000 minutes.\nAnswer using the first three digits (000) of the answer.

{"idx": 737, "text": "The person has to put steps forward because you need the answer in steps because one step forward is not enough to reach you to ask something or to start asking anything at all\n\nInput:I found this old clock which has no battery in it. In order to keep it working, I just have to put 16 stones into it and then it will work again. In order to know if there are 16 stones in it, there should be a big window and a big stone weighing 1 stone and the window weight 16 stones. I have just put 1 stone so now I should put 15 stones into it to make certain that there are more stones than 16 stones into. If this is not enough stones, I have to put more stones until I am sure that the weight of all the stones I put in it is greater than 16 stones. In other word, if I always have to put more than 16 stones, then I will never have to put 12 stone into it to start using this working device again. If this is not the case, then the answer to this question is yes. If you are certain that it would never work, then you must say that the answer is no.\nOutput: Let x denote the number of stones that one should put into the clock and y denote the number of stones. Let h(x,y) be True if x<=y and False if x>y. The condition for x to be True is that y must be less than x. The condition for y to be equal to x is for h(x,y)=False, so when y=x, h(x,y_2)=False implies x should always put in stones and not stop until x_o>16. A simple algorithm for (x,y) will be to check if h(x,y)(c) for all x<=y. For such a simple and finite state machine, there should be a solution for this problem as it would return true or false. When the answer will always be No, the state machine will eventually return False after a finite number of steps. Thus the answer is No.\nSo the final solution is No\nAnswer the following multiple choice questions.\n\nInput: You have two bags, one empty, and one containing 4 identical marbles.

How does one get to this answer?  Answer: First we need to get the sum of the digits using division. Using the divisibility test and the result of dividing each number by 2 we can tell that the odd sum of digits will be odd and the even sum of digits will be even. We can also then tell that every term has a remainder of 1 except for the term 276 and 54 which has a remainder of 2 so then we can multiply by 2 to get rid of the remainder and the answer you get is 26.\n\nOutput:So we already know that the digits are odd/even.  If they are odd, so does the total, so if we have total/2 and we get a remainder of 1, we know it must be odd.  If we have total/2 with a remainder of 2 we know it must be even.  We know that sum of digits (odd) divided by 2 is odd, so total divided by 2 must be even.\nIf we have sum of digits (odd)/2, we know that it must be odd.\nSo if the odd number must be even and the even number must be odd, then total must be odd.\nThat leaves us with total = odd*total = total/2 for every term.\nThe result we get is the sum of all the digits.  Therefore, we simply know that total = odd + even, and we can remove the remaining ones to get an even number.\nSo the final result is total = sum of the digits + even numbers for every term\nSo total = odd sum\n\nInput:The input will first ask for n and the amount in cents.

From that group, 12 are good and 18 are bad. How many of my new employees are good?\nOutput: We need to work out the probability of a candidate being good. There are only 7 of them, and in each case there is a 1/3 chance they are bad and a 2/3 chance they\u2019re good. Thus, the probability of a bad candidate being good is 1/3, and the probability of a good candidate being good is 2/3. Our group contains 23 bad candidates and 12 good candidates. The probability of finding a bad candidate among 23 is just 1/23. Meanwhile, the probability of finding a good candidate among 12 is 2/12, which is 1/6. Thus, the probability is that a candidate is good is 1/6: a probability of 16.7%.\nSo the final answer if 16.7%\n\nInput: There are 18 eggs in an 8-egg carton and 33 eggs in a 12-egg carton.

Then the answer should be 1,87.5 and the input number is 600, so the answer is 3. Then the third choice: B=A*-4, so the answer will return to 600.\nThe answer of the fourth choice should be 8000 when choosing the first step and 0 when choosing the fourth step, so the answer should always be 2800.\nThe next answer should be 5200 with the first step. The first choice has the 5200 as the answer and the 4th choice does not have, but the 2nd choice has 5200, so the choice should be 52, and the 520 as the answer of B", "answer": "E: wave on"}

In our case, this is 1000.\nThe books are arranged in authors. There are multiple authors that have the same last name, and it is possible that there are duplicate books\nWe can assume the books are arranged with the authors first. Say the number of authors with the last name are a, we can assume that authors with the same last names will still be in the total books. (a > 0, a is a natural number)\n\nNow the question states it mentions how many times an author can appear in books, and that there can only be a maximum of a number of authors with last name a that appears in the current book. We can conclude that it is safe we that there is no duplicate in the book, as there will only be a maximum of authors per book available. We will say there are no other authors at the moment. (a < number of authors).\n\nNow since we know how many authors we have in total, and how many authors we can have in a book,\nWe can find how many books each author gets. We know the maximum number of authors with a last name a that an author can be in a book. If we assume there are multiple authors with the last name a, and there was no other authors who was not mentioned in the question, the authors who was in the next book before the last book that was read, will not appear in the next time, as it was not in the last book. Therefore, the number of books this author can appear in will be 1 more than the last time it appeared.\n\nSimilarly, all other authors that has been mentioned will get an extra book if they are the next in line before the last book.\n\nHence, there will be for every last name in the total number of authors (a) a total of ((1+a-1)) books.\n\nHence the sum would be a*((1+a-1) = << a*((1+ a-1) = (a+1)(a+", "answer": "B: exhaustion"}

You are hosting a dinner party and each person you invite to the dinner party costs $n, and every friend you invite invites another friend of theirs over to the party too (so if you invite 3 people to your party, then each of them invites an average of 3 other friends to your dinner and also come themselves = a total group of 9 or 10 people that evening). The party ends after exactly (number-n*n) amount of time. How much does the party cost?\nOutput: You cost a total of $n*n = <<n*n=n>>1 for every friend you invite.\nEvery friend you invite invite an average of n other friends to the party = n*(n-1) = <<n*(n-1)==2*n-2>>2*n-2 people.\nThe party ends after exactly 1+(2*n-2) = <<1+(2*n=2n)>>2n number of hours.\nHence, the total amount of time it takes from the party starting to the end is n*(n-1)+1 = <<n*(n)=1>>1\nYou have (number-n*2*n-1) = (number-n*1) = <<n-n>>1 number of people in your party.\nYou spend 100 on the invites and 1 on the decorations.\nHence, you end up spending $100, (number-n*(n-1) = 100, number-n*-n = n*n = 1), and (number-n*-1 = 100-n).\nHence, the party cost is n and (100-n-1) = <100-n>\nSo the final answer 100-1\n\nInput: Every 6-year-old in San Francisco is offered a free bicycle.

The next number would be for the first position (99). So the next number would be 20. Since the string is 5 digits, I need 100 for the string to be complete. The last digit would be one. 7. If I add a 6 to my string how will it look?\n7. Additions operators would work from the least value at the end, to sum up your total value using the carry over at the end.\nSo when you add the value you will have either a carry over on the right side or not.\nIf your answer is right, and you are done, if you have a carry over, if you put 1, you will now have a 7 (if you put 1 instead of a 0).\nHere's an example: 14 2+3=5. 5+4=9. 9-4=5. So the carry over gets added to 5, to get 9.", "answer": "E: trunk"}

Three trains can travel from New York to Washington, DC faster than one car can. Do you agree with this statement?\nOutput: The train can travel 30 miles per one hour, and on an average one person can travel 10 kilometers per one hour.\nHence, an average car speed is 60 miles per one hour or 60 kilometers per one one hour.\nA train can travel 3*1=<<3*1=3>>3 times faster than a car. So, they can travel 30+30+30 = < 3^3 = 27 > km.\nSuch speed is much faster than one car speed, and 3 cars can easily travel from NY to Washington (1940 km) faster than one single car.\nSo, I certainly agree with the statement.\n\nInput: A truck moves a large shipment from the dock where it is unloaded from the ship to a warehouse.

A three-eyed fish is 2 feet long. There are two types of three-eyed fish: male (72 inches long) and female (75 inches long). What are the minimum dimensions of an aquarium needed to keep a school of at least ten three-eyed fish?\nOutput :  L+W should equal 1 ft more than the length of fish.  The width should equal 1 ft less than the length of fish because you will need at least one inch to spare for any extra three-eyed fish you might introduce later\nH should equal 6 ft because 6 feet high is the maximum height possible for the tank.\nTherefore, the required dimensions of an aquarium for three-eyed fish would be \n10*72 + 10*(72 + 75) + 6 = <10*72+600+6=2460>2460 square feet (sq ft)\nSo the final answer would be 2460\n\nInput : There are 5,000 couches on the Home Shopping Networks website.

When each room has the identical size, there are 11 choices in two rooms for the size, plus the possible size of a single room which cannot be more than the size of two rooms, for a total of 56 possibilities. The size of an apartment can be at most two rooms' size because only two rooms can share a bathroom. There are exactly 14 apartments, giving a total of 11 possible apartment sizes of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, and 22 rooms.\nSo the final awnser is 11 choices\n\nInput: 74 0 99 50 75 92 35 36 7 35 99 96 36 62 37 72 73 66 76 83 5 75 7 58 79 80 20 74 91 64 2\nOutput: 92 15 47 61 77 51 65 85 70 48 57 89 25 64 91 53 93 66 81 15 5 55 35 49 69\nSo the final awwwer is 135\n\nInput: A large restaurant orders only trays of muffins.

The only solution for this case is to add \"print\" statement at the start of the first problem before the input statement and to add a print statement as the first statement in the code block. I'm also surprised you didn't mention that in your solution.\n\nNow it is possible that my code may have some bugs (and it may be so of yours too) but without your help I wouldn't know that.\n\nFor example, your solution in problem 7 had a bug which could have been easily found if the problem was assigned a time limit. If you are going to submit a solution at contests, a time limit will be assigned. Of course you can check your solution beforehand as many contests do allow you to check the test data, but even if you do that with each problem you still need to do a lot of debugging.\n\nWhat was I talking about in problems 5 and 6?

The above code snippet shows an application that uses the Car Rental class and has an object called rentalObj of that class.  Which class or object is more important in the above snippet?\n    ---\n    Solution:\n    A. The Car Rental class and its object, rentalObj, are both equally important. Without either of them, the application you are building above (renting cars) will not work.\n    B. The Car Rental object is more important than the class because it has specifics of the car rental company while the class has a generic definition about everything shared by a rent car company\n    C. The Car Rental Class is important because it has a generic definition about what a car company needs to offer like payment, reservation policy. However, it is not important because once the specific need of a customer is catered through the class, the rent cannot be billed\n    D. The Class is more important here because it holds the details of the payment, reservation policy, and rules of the rent car company. The Object just serves to access and set properties of all the fields.\n    E. The Class object is more important since it holds information and details of the Rental Company that a person would want to use. The object serves as an access point to the specified details\n2.

It was finally titled 1984. What was the original title?\n**Answer** You should first write down an equation, A= B+ C. The title A was changed to B, the title was changed to C and then the it was changed to A+ C, meaning A was A+ C. If we do the same calculation for B and C, we will find B+ C = A, then we take the difference of the two equations, we will get, A - B = C. So if we subtract B from both sides, A will be A- B+ C. We will go on the same process and find that A - B- C+ A+ B+ C+ D = C+ E. So A - (B- C+ A+B+C+D-E) = Z, which is a simple Z+ (B - C+ A+ B + C +D-E) = T, which is T+ E = Z- B+ C+ D+ F, (T- B+ C+ F) + E = Z- B + (C+ D+ F), therefore T= Z- B + ( C+ D+ F) and the original title of 1984 is A- T = E.\n**Output:** 1984\n\n###", "answer": "D: small talk"}

Thus, she spent 310$ on the car rental.\n\nThere is 20 days in a week, and 11 days=81/12 of a week. Thus, if it takes 40 miles/hour, the driving time of the rancher is 81/40=2.05 hours.\n\nThere is $5000 dollars=25 days in a weeks, thus, if she rents the house for $50, it will take her 25 times 4 (days)+1 (for the 40th day of the renting period)=200 times 4 (days)=800$ she pays\n\nIt takes her 30 hours a month for 12 month, thus, it will take her (12*30)=360 hours a year to drive to the town, not including traffic\n\nThe ratio is 5/7, which is 75%.

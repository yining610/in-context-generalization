Rick's extension ladder costs $15 more than Charlie's extension ladder. Rick bought 3 extension ladders for $89. How much dollars does Charlie's extension ladden cost?\n\n### Demontation:\nUse the information we were given to solve the problem\n\nWe can first take the number and add each number to get 235. We can then round that to 234.95 to get a total of how much money Charlie's extension ladde costs.\n\n### Response (135):The total will be $177.95\n\n### Explination:\nThe extension ladder we were given was $15 less than the one Rick bought it, Rick bought it for $164 dollars. The total of the ladder we have is $235 and the answer is how much did Charlie's ladder cost, the answer is $177.05. This because Charlie's was $15.05 dollars and 0.05 means 5, so his ladder cost $15 dollars after Rick's was added.\n\nThe total of Charlie's ladders was $234.97 and the answer was given we already the $15 to start and we just had to add the remaining amount, once we do that it will be $224.95. Then we just have to round $224.00 which is $224 to get 224.", "answer": "B: pass time"}

If we multiply that by 100, we get 76,938, and rounding downwards, the number of people in this family is approximately 76,900.\n\n### Response- Explanation: 76,940", "answer": "B: city"}

{"text": "A\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following out of the many choices.\n\n### Answer for 1:  We are asked to determine the relationship between the rate, t, and the total amount of money, t * r.  By definition, rate is t.  Total cost is simply t * r.  Rates of change can be represented in mathematical form as slopes of linear equations, which correspond to the line whose x and y variables are time and cost, respectively.\n\n### Concept of Interest:  So, the slope of a line with respect to its price is the ratio of change in cost with respect to time.  By taking two consecutive prices, and dividing the change in cost by the change in time, we obtain that ratio.\n\n### Question for 2:  Taking a 50% mark down is a good deal if the full sales price was a good rate, but if the full sales price is too high, that same 50% discounted price is still too high.\n\n### Input 1 for 3:  The sum of boys in the family and girls in the family is 8.  It is given that the ratio of boys to girls is 5:7, and 50% of the bill is medication, so the remainder of the bill is roughly half medication and half food.\n\n### Interest Formula:  We do not want medication, but if we take the entire bill plus the medication and divide by two, than that number must equal the sum of boys and girls in the family.  Multiplying the number of dollars by that ratio gives us a number that is equal to half medication, and the other half is for food and other expenses.\n\n### Output 4:  The original price of a pair of shoes that is discounted by 20% is $84, as the total price remains the same after the discount.  Therefore, 84 * 20/100 = 80, and 84 - 80 = 4.\n\n### Time Remaining:  Ten friends get together to split the cost of a gift to their teacher equally for one semester.

{"text": "If I am forgiving I am able to find a good heart and develop a positive relationship. It allows me to have more inner peace. Forgiveness can lead to new freedoms in the relationship and help create the kind of environment that is filled with respect and love towards the relationship.  The hidden force is the karma that has been left in the relationship and the negative feeling about the relationship in the relationship that lead to this. The forgiveness, once given, helps everyone move forward with a more positive attitude about the relationship once the negativity, and hurt, and upset have been released from the energy of the relationship, so that the relationship has now freed up. There is more new heart which allow the relationship to grow and move forward in a relationship based off of love, and not hate, and anger anymore. If I don't forgive I loose out on love, I have more anger, and resentment and more negative feelings in the relationship, and I loose out on love. Once I forgive, there is more respect and love in my relationship, because there is less anger and resentment the relationship.\n\nThe hidden force of forgiveness is the negative energy, I had toward the relationship, and the person.

(2 pts)\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe word back in \u201cthe forgotten leftovers\u201d indicates the man had to look in the refrigerator\u2019s back, to find the moldy leftover. The carpet is something that protects the wood floor from getting wet and so not likely to get mold on it (unless someone forgot their bag of wet clothes on the carpet and the mold spread). We rule out the breadbox and fridge because they are typically on a shelf (in a home), and the man\u2019s statement indicates that the leftover was found in the back (in the refrigerator). The man\u2019s story also indicates that he had to move the food in his fridge to find the mold so he would not have to find it covered by mold. Since he is describing moving other food to find the mold, the refrigerator is most likely a fridge. Finally, there is only one way to get food to the back of a fridge. All you do is open the door and shove. The carpet does not help you to shove, so we rule it out for the solution. Since you need to shove to get food to a fridge\u2019s back, so it is best to leave \u201ccoach\u201d for the solution because coaching may require shoving.\n\n### Add a description of your solution if you choose.

{"text": "B\n\n### Demystification:\n1. The original question states, \"When I tell my story of how I got fired, I feel I have justified my behavior.\" Is the questioner justifying their behavior based on their previous experience, as in \"Look what happened to me; it's no wonder I did that\"? Or are they justifying their behavior by offering a retort by someone else, as in \"I know what you're thinking; no wonder I did that...\"?\n2. The original question states that the person got fired from a previous job because \"I yelled at one of my partners and was fired on the spot.\" A person who uses \"yelled\" and \"fired\" in the same breath does so casually, indicating that the person believes that firing someone who yells at another person is a normal human reaction and that one need not give it much forethought or even afterthought. It appears that the person who wrote this question lacks consideration of how and when to apply force, and also lacks consideration of how to evaluate the consequences of one's actions.\n3. The original question states \"I wasn't aware of how my tone or tone-related behavior could have affected others. Now I try to get to know a person before I talk to them.\" The key words are \"tone-related behavior\" (\"tone\" can also be described as \"tenor,\" but if someone is yelling, they also are likely to be saying something to the one they are yelling at). Tone or tenor does not only include verbal statements; facial expressions can affect the tone or tenor. And if, in fact, the person was yelling at someone, it is very likely that there was also a tone or tenor in the body movements.\n4. The original question states: \"I also found [that] it's a good idea to have a written contract for most kinds of work or business relationships. I have one to protect my interests, but maybe you do too.\" It does not appear that the person writing this question has considered that having a written contract or written policy can be used as a means to intimidate someone in a position of subordination.\n5. In conclusion, this question could be an indication that the person who posed the question is a poor businessperson who is not able to use verbal or written policy or \"contracts\" as", "answer": "D: city block"}

{"text": "A\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n### Solution:\n\nAnswer A.\n\n### Inputs:\n\nThe tourist are going to the seaside to rent a house for 6 days. They want to know what the fee would be if they stay for 180 days. They figure out that to pay the $6 fee, they must divide the total cost by the time they rent the house.\n\n### Concept 1:\n\nThis problem required a ratio. They used the ratio of boys to girls, and then multiplied that ratio by 180 children. The ratio is 5:7 so they ended up with 105 boys and 129 girls.\n\n#### Input\n\n- boys: 180\n- girls: 129\n\n#### Work\n\n180 * (5/7) = 105\n\n### Response\n\nA: 800 / 105 boys = 7.61\n\n1800 / 224 girls = 8.04\n\n$7.61 * 2 = $8.02\n\n$7.99 * 2 = $15.98\n\n$15.98 + $8.02 = $23.90\n\nWe got a similar calculation using the following:\n\n527 * 2/5 girls = 527 * (2 * 0.8) = 817 * 0.4 = $327.8\n\n### Conclusions:\n\nWe used the concept of multiplying the ratio by a constant to determine the new number. In this case, the 2 represents their stay. Another application of this concept could be a 10%, 15%, or 20% discocunt applied to the original purchase price.\n\nThis is a good application of the concept of ratios found in the first instruction. This is a concept that we have come to find important to the solutions of mathematical questions in our life.", "answer": "A: seaside town"}

To recap 1. What is the difference between a population and a sample?\n\n### Answer 1:Population and sample are concepts used in statistics and probability. A  population is a total collection of data for a variable of interest for all units in the group. A sample is a subset of a population and is used as a representative sample of that population. The sample is a set of data from the population.\n\n### 2.Suppose that we collect data from members of a society on their favorite sport.

Explain your answer.\n\n### Answer3: The sample mean and the population mean are equal only when the sample and population share the entire statistical population. When the population is divided into smaller subgroups, the sample mean cannot be necessarily taken to represent all subgroups of the population.\n\n\n\n### 4.\nSuppose a population of college students is divided between a large public school and a small, private school.

The original reading was 120 degrees, and it would drop 20 degrees. The new reading will be 100 degrees.\n\n## Solution2:\nIf the temperature was 110 degrees and dropped 20-degrees to 90 degrees during an hour, then the question is looking for the new temperature when an hour has elapsed.

{"text": "The stars light up the night sky.\n\n### Input\n12 is 4 times as much as 3.  How many times is 9000 as much as 300?\n\n### Response\n 4\n\n### Instructions\nComplete two math questions.\n  \n### Solution:\nSolution 1:\nLet's have a look at the numbers given. We can see that 2 is double of 1, 4 is triple of 1, and 8 is four times of 1. We can also see that 9 is four times of 2. So, 9 is 4 times as large as 2. Now, using this piece of information, we can calculate the correct answer of the question which is, '12 is how many times as much as 4?'\n\nThis is because 12 is 4 plus 4 which is 8. So, 12 is 8 times as much as 2. \n\nWe can use the same solution to calculate the rest of the questions.\nSolution 2:\nLet's first see what is meant in the problem, \"How many times 9000 times as much as 100?'\n\nAs the question is, \"How many times\" we can just assume the answer that it is 90 times. We can do this because,\n\n9000 is 9 times 1000,\n100 is 1 times 90,\nand\n90 times 100 equals 9,000\n\nWhat this means is, every time 90 is added to 100 the answer is 9,00. In the same way we can add 9000 to 100 and get 9000.\n\n### ResponseA:If John walks 5 km at 4 km/h, for how many hours did he walk?\n\nSolution:\nJohn used 4 km/h for 5km so that means 62.5min which is =1hr 10min.\n\n### Solution for Response B:\n9km /9km/h - 62.5km / 24hours\n\nThis equals 0.375km/hr, therefore 3", "answer": "B: night sky"}

{"text": "[Answer] C\n\n### Input:[I wanted to see what would happen if the temperature outside was 30 degrees all the way up to 50 degree. I went ahead and set a variable for the outside air temperature, which was 20. Then, I set a loop to ask the user for the input for the outside temperature every time the user pushed the button and put the value into the variable. Then, I took the last number and I divided it by two to convert the number from degrees to Fahrenheit. Now, I just pushed the button until I started to get above 50 degrees. From there, I was able to see that 30 degrees was the lowest amount until it reached 50 degrees at which point it suddenly went to 51 degrees.  It does that until it goes over to the point where it stays at 51 degrees all the way up until 85 which is the temperature limit for my code.  Now, I know exactly how high it can go.

So we get the user\u2019s input from the command.  Say we get the input of 25.  We know that 25 represents the age as of today.  But then we have to think about it as of X years ago, which is 10 in our case.  So we want to subtract 10.  So the output will be 15.  Now, we will do this 4 times to get the 4 age outputs using the loop block.\n\nAnd then, we will ask the user how old they are as of 10 years ago as of today and ask them the difference.  So we will input the age.

Scientists want to understand how Earth was formed. A few years ago, scientists discovered the world\u2019s oldest fossil. It came from a type of bacteria that grew millions of years ago, the period when the Earth\u2019s oceans first formed. When the Earth\u2019s surface was soft and mushy, this bacteria formed a community around a hot spring. Then they made minerals that formed the rocks that make up the earth today.

There's no answer in the choices.\n\n### Solution: C is the answer.\n### Input: A box contains some marbles, some dice, some coins, some paperclips, and some poker chips. The box contains a whole number ratio of marbles to paperclips. If the box contains twice as many dice as it contains coins, two times as many coins as it contains marbles, and two times as many marbles (in total) as it contains paperclips.  If there are twice as many dice as coins, how many dice are in the box?\n\n### Solution 1: \nInput: Dice: 1/2 of the box, and marbles 1/4 of the box. If there's paperclips, then dice and marbles are 2:1, but paperclips are 1:2. That would mean they're 2 marbles less than 2 dice. They say they're 2/3 in total, because they're saying they can't round, right? So the paperclips are not in proportion to the dice and marbles.\n\n### Soln 2: \nInput: The box contains a whole nuber ratio of marbles to poker chips, which implies that there are an equal number of marbles and paperclips. If there are twice as much dice as coins, it must be twice as many dice than paperclips, so 2/4. If dice is half of coins, paperclips is 1/2 of coins, so marbles are 1/4 of coins. The box contains a ratio of 1:2:2. That implies the box contains 10 marbles, 6 coins, and 12 dice.", "answer": "D: beach"}

{"text": "The letter I is made to be a part of this story. The carrot story is written. \"We pulled 55 carroets.\" It looks like the sentence is about to be finished. It reads like this: \"We pulled 56 carrots. Then we made a pie. It was time for our next meal. We opened a can of beans.\" But if we add an E to the story it reads in an odd way. We now have \"We pulled 57 carrots then we made a pie. Then we opened the can of string beans.\" Something is very odd and there is no E to be added to the story. We have one extra.

{"text": "A\n\n### Explanation: Thrust of a throw comes from the height over which the object is thrown.\n\n### Input\nIn order to be able to throw a rock up high enough to make a big splashed you would need a lot of force behind the throw. That force would be derived from the mass of the rock times its velocity. In order to have a larger effect than throwing it straight in the air, we will have to take that gravity into account.\nBecause the river is on the ground below us, the mass of the rock will remain in the ground until the rock is stopped by the ground. That means it is falling and so the force of the rock moving against the force of gravity will make the rock increase in speed as it falls. In order to throw a rock above the river, the rock would need to be thrown above the water and then the velocity of the rock would have to be increased.\nIf the rock was thrown straight up in the air, where the air would act as a resistance to the rock that would slow down the velocity, the rock would never be able to hit the river. The rock would either float away or hit the ground. This idea can be illustrated in the diagram.\nTo throw a rock high enough into the air to splash into the river from where we are, we would need very significant force behind the throw. This would require throwing the rock against the surface of the earth.\n\n### Response\n\nIn order to be successful in throwing the rock and hitting the river, the rock needs enough velocity that the rock will be in the air long enough to make it up to the river. Because the water is below us, and we are on the earth, in order to splash in the river we would have to throw the rock up above the water, into the air, from where we are. If the river is 100 meters wide, in order to have an effect, the rock would have to hit the water 100 meters or higher into the air.\n\nThe diagram shown below illustrates the idea.\nIn the diagram shown, the rocket was thrown with great force. The rock splashed in the water and made a big splash. In order to throw the rock at this height, the rocket has to accelerate while going through the air. The acceleration is a force that is proportional to the mass, given by the formula (mv)/t, where (v) is the", "answer": "C: bridge"}

{"text": "The choices are: A, B, D, and E. Of these choices, carpenter's shops and garage are considered buildings by the most strict definition. The choice \"total number\" appears to indicate number of stories. Because \"the building number\" does not indicate the number of stories, this could mean either the entire building (which does include the number of stories) or simply the number of people in that area. The choice video game would indicate if the number of people using the game is measured or the number of floors. In contrast, \"carpenter's shop\" would appear to not refer to the number of floors, given that it is a shop, which has only one level. It could be referring to the number of people instead, in which case the building number would be higher than the carpenter's floor number.\n\n### Input :Which one of the following is the best estimate of the cost of a 200 foot ladder?

Each choice of multiplier results in a higher cost than the previous one, but only multiplication by 45 results in a cost more than double. Multiplying by 25, 35 and 45 results in costs more than $2000 and so the highest cost is for multiplier 45, which leads to the cost of $1450, which is the correct answer\n\n### Input :- What part of the building is used to store water?

{"text": "Answer: confusion\n\n### Demofication:\n\nExplanation: Civil action refers to actions taken by an individual or institution in response to civil law. This can include initiating a lawsuit, taking legal action, or taking some other legal steps to resolve a dispute or complaint.  Confusion on the other hand is an emotional state that involves the inability to remember, understand, or reason clearly and correctly. According to the Oxford Dictionary, confusion is a state of mental bewilderment or doubt, typically as a result of contention or uncertainty in one's thinking. For example, if a plaintiff\u2019s claim is disputed by another party, they can institute civil action by suing the other party. If the plaintiff is unaware of the facts of their claim, they may experience confusion. Civil action can also refer to the organization of actions taken to express opposition to a proposed law or development.\n\n### Input\nWhat makes an animal's skeleton heavier than its flesh? Choices:  i: water ii: bones iii: hair iv: fat v: none of the above\n\n### Response\n\nAnswer: bones\n\nWhen an animal consumes their food, the first stage is for the nutrients they contain to be distributed throughout the body. Since these nutrients are required for life to function and the animal requires those nutrients to survive, the nutrients are transferred from the digestive system to many other parts of the animal\u2019s body. One of the ways in which this happens is through a series of chemical reactions that result in the formation of bones.  The formation of bones is a slow process that involves calcium and phosphate in the blood and bone proteins like collagen.\n\nAs this process occurs, bones grow, and with it, the animal\u2019s body adds mass.  When a bone is formed, it weighs less than the mass of the organism, since it is made up of inorganic materials like calcium, while an animal's flesh is comprised of organic matter. Bones are lighter than flesh because they are the result of metabolic reactions involving phosphates, calcium and other minerals that were inorganic when they entered the body, but whose formation into bone weighs less than its weight in raw materials.", "answer": "E: protests"}

The vowel was no longer being pronounced properly and it was time to change the letter so it could once again be correctly pronounced. The English letter A is the twenty-first letter in the English alphabet. The English letter C has changed over time as well. The letter C was pronounced [\u03b8] when the English language began. It was pronounced like the English letter T. The letter T changed to C so the letter C that was pronounced like the letter T could have it's own identity. The English letter H is the eleventh letter in the English alphabet and it started out as [h]. The H became the th sound [\u00f0] because that's how the C sound changed and later turned into a T sound.\n\n### Hints:\n### Instruction to the response:\nThe Roman alphabet and the English alphabet are two versions of the same alphabet. They are both made up of letters.\n\n### Example:\nThomas Jefferson was the third US president. The US government was founded under his leadership. Jefferson was an author, inventor, scientist and politician. Jefferson was the primary author of the Declaration of Independence. He started several public libraries, one of which opened as New York\u2019s first public library. He loved books about archaeology and history. He even bought an old Egyptian boat so he could read about ancient Egypt. Jefferson was a farmer and so as president, he often planted seeds in the White House garden that had been given to him by people all over the world. He was also the first president to be vegetarian while living in the White House.\n\n### Response to the above example:\nThomas Jefferson", "answer": "A: utah"}

There were 17 total campers on Tuesday. There are 226 campers total.

Ask the following questions: What task do you think was completed? Describe how you know you answered correctly. What is the difference between your answer and the tutor's answer?\n\n- There are two types of variables in this task:\n1. Numerical Variables: These variables are associated with a number. We call the associated number a numerical value. For this task we don\u2019t have to care about the value, it\u2019s just called a numerical value. We won\u2019t need to write, subtract, compare, etc. anything with numbers.\n- Variable Names: The name given to a variable is a part of the variable itself.  Names contain numbers or letters. A name starts with its first letter and ends with a question mark. A name has an open or closing bracket (\u201c[]\u201c). Each name identifies something to distinguish it from another name.  Names can never be empty.  They can only be of size zero, one, or infinite.   In the task there are different symbols which identify each name but we don\u2019t care about them, we only care about the name. This is the same for each variable in the task, we only need to care about the variable name.  \nThis is a task where you need to write the name of the variable. The name of the variable is used to tell the tutor and the answerer to get the correct data, the data you get is used to calculate.  For example, the answerer uses a name variable name to get the data. Then, if you get the correct data and write the data, the tutor will say it's correct, and give you a hint to use the data correctly, the rest of the tutor\u2019s actions depends on the question the tutor asks you.\n- Variable Types: There are two types: Numerical Variables (as described already) and Constants. There are no constants in this task. A constant has a fixed numerical value that is true forever, and is never changed.\n- Data: If you want to know the current value of a variable you should use data instead", "answer": "C: hock"}

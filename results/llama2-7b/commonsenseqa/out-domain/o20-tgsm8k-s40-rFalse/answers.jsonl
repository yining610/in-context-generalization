I am very excited to create my first GitHub project. It was so much fun and exciting. We explored a lot of things while coding and discussing. I tried to solve the problems using my approach and tried to find the solution. I am so happy to write my solution on Coding and to explore different skills in coding. I loved coding with my friend Pranv. There were many things I learned from him apart from coding.\nI have learned many things, I have a better understanding of OOPs concept and it will definitely help me in understanding the other concepts easier. I learned to use classes and it is very easy to understand and use according to our needs. The syntaxes like class, static block, variables, methods, constructors etc are so simple and easy to use.\nI used to solve the problems in the first way and found the solution but later I found the better approach to solve the problem, like recursive methods, function in for loop and else-if, while and if loop etc. These are all very easy to use and understand.\nI found another concept called mod and int that is very interesting to use and very simple to use. I think I will only use mod operator in coding. Before learning python I used to write my own function and methods to solve the coding problems. But I have learned how to use the built-in functions which are available in Python. These functions are so easy to use and very helpful to solve the coding problems in", "answer": "C: front door"}

Each dog weighs 6 times more than each tick.  How many tics weigh as much as?\n\nWe are given \n\nThe first step is to find a common denominator so that we can simplify the fractions.\n\nFor the above problem\n\nLet us find the common denominator by observing that denominators 33 = 3.  So we can simplify the denominator of the above fractions to 10.\n\nSubstitute 10 into place of 33.  We now have:\n\nThen, we find a common denominator. \n\nThus, the common denominator is `10x10x10 == 1000`.  Then, we divide `6` by 33 to have an additional value for the 500.\nThis gives \n\nThen we divide 500 by 33", "answer": "E: eyes opening"}

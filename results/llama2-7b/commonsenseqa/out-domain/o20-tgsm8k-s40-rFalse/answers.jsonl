I am very excited to create my first GitHub project. It was so much fun and exciting. We explored a lot of things while coding and discussing. I tried to solve the problems using my approach and tried to find the solution. I am so happy to write my solution on Coding and to explore different skills in coding. I loved coding with my friend Pranv. There were many things I learned from him apart from coding.\nI have learned many things, I have a better understanding of OOPs concept and it will definitely help me in understanding the other concepts easier. I learned to use classes and it is very easy to understand and use according to our needs. The syntaxes like class, static block, variables, methods, constructors etc are so simple and easy to use.\nI used to solve the problems in the first way and found the solution but later I found the better approach to solve the problem, like recursive methods, function in for loop and else-if, while and if loop etc. These are all very easy to use and understand.\nI found another concept called mod and int that is very interesting to use and very simple to use. I think I will only use mod operator in coding. Before learning python I used to write my own function and methods to solve the coding problems. But I have learned how to use the built-in functions which are available in Python. These functions are so easy to use and very helpful to solve the coding problems in", "answer": "C: front door"}

How many tics weigh as much as?\n\nWe are given \n\nThe first step is to find a common denominator so that we can simplify the fractions.\n\nFor the above problem\n\nLet us find the common denominator by observing that denominators 33 = 3.  So we can simplify the denominator of the above fractions to 10.\n\nSubstitute 10 into place of 33.  We now have:\n\nThen, we find a common denominator. \n\nThus, the common denominator is `10x10x10 == 1000`.  Then, we divide `6` by 33 to have an additional value for the 500.\nThis gives \n\nThen we divide 500 by 33", "answer": "E: eyes opening"}

{"text": "(None)\n\n\n#### Multiple Choice\n\n- I think Python for calculating is not efficient, which is much slower than Java, C, C++. That is because Python is a high level language, we can't use floating points for calculating, so we use normalization firstly. \n- Since Python's math function is designed for use on integers, it is not possible to calculate large decimal numbers using that. For Python, the only possible way to do it is to use [Decimal module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html), the best solution for this task is using [python-numba](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/stable/cpsint.html#cps-int), it can speed up by x10- x100.\n\n- The Python code of the question is inefficient, because it is using `pow(2, i)`, if you multiply with each other will result in the same answer. As [Ben Tilden](https://twitter.com/BenTilden/status/1208692685809813376) mentioned, `math.pow(2, i)` is 1000 times faster than `pow(2,i)`, it is because the first one is not built-in function, the second one is built-in function.\n\n- It is inefficient because the math operation can't be done efficiently by python. But we are using numba module to calculate the answers instead of using python built-in math module. \n\n- To improve efficency, we can reduce the number of math operation. Because we can't use python's `pow(2,3)` instead of `math.pow(3,2)`, so we need reduce the number of math operations.\n\n- I think this is inefficient that 4 lines can be reduced to just 3 lines. And the other code to subtract can also be reduced to just 2 lines. \n- We didn't use math module directly in Python, but use numba module. That is more efficent.\n- We could use a bit more efficient than the given solution. For example, we could divide the total number of stars by the total number of numbers, then count all the stars, and then count the number of groups", "answer": "E: kill yourself"}

{"text": "B\n\n### Answer:\nWe want to figure out the difference between the number 20 and the number 90. Let\u2019s first do the numbers individually.\n```python\nprint(20 - 90)\n```\n```output\n-70\n```\nWe know that if we add 1 to `-70`, we get 69 and that means the difference between 20 and 90 is 69.\nNext, we want to figure out how many Schnauzer\u2019s are there. Let\u2019s say we have 5 less than 3 times the initial number of Doberman Puppies. The expression can be written as `5 - (3 * init_number_of_d) = (5 * init_number_d) / 3`.\nThe first part `(5 * init_number)` is the total, or number of Schnauzer\u2019 the expression gets reduced to. Subtracting the second part, `60 = 5 * 12`, of Doberman pups from the `5 * init_number`, we get the number of Schnappu\u2019s.\nTo sum everything up, the total is (5 * init_num_of_d) and we need to subtract 6 * init_num_d - 60 to get `25 * (init_num_of_doberman_puppies)) - 6 * init_doberman_num + 60` as the solution.\n\nWe are now working with fractions and I personally recommend that you write the problem out in words to make it easier to keep track of all possibilities.\nWe know that the number of times in each month (April and May) to give away the remaining tooth brushes is equal to `1/2`. As such we can write it as `tooth_brushes / 2` to get `tooth_brashes / 6`. As such the total number of toothbrushes will be 10 times the number of toothbrashes given away.\n\nThe initial number of brushes is `330 - 275 = 55`.\n\nTo summarize this, it is `330 * 10 - 270 * 6 = 2130 - 1", "answer": "D: compete with each other"}

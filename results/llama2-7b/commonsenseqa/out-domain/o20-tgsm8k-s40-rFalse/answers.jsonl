If we look at the Jurassic Park books and the TV series the most up to date Jurassic Park is 2014.\n\n### Reasons: The movie Jurassic Park came out in 1993 and is a classic film for many.

In the Jurassic park movie we have some very dangerous dinosaurs, and some dangerous scenes with some of the dinosaurs.  So we want this dinosaur egg to have dinosaurs in it, but we want it to still be safe.  The question is how can we make this dinosaur egg safe for everyone by having it in a case.  This dinosaur egg would be very expensive, and could possibly be a little too large for a building.  If we look for ideas to put dinosaur eggs into a glass box or a case there are many ideas.  Some examples include the following:  glass dome case: This is a type of container in which people can display something of value, such as a sculpture or dinosaur egg, inside.  It protects the object and keeps dust, airborne pollutants, and other things out.  It's made of clear glass and can be both very heavy and fragile at the same times.  This type of case is well-liked since it looks good in museum settings. A museum exhibition that features dinosaur eggs in a glass dome might make a lot of money", "answer": "C: radio station"}

If you say an 'Excessive' amount, this is most likely due to the fact that you subtracted the interest paid to the Fed from the interest paid to the customers and came to a negative answer. Because you need to pay the Fed interest, your profit for the year goes to zero. If you subtracted the interest due to your customers twice, the answer would be negative.\n\n### Exploration:I think I overthought this one.

I think the question might be a bit confusing.\n\n### Note:\nGiven: The probability that Annie picks the lightest box is 1\nGiven: The probabilities that Annie doesn't pick the three boxes she picks after it are also 1\nSolution: The probability that the box Annie doesn't choose is the one she chooses is 1, and the probability that the box Anis doesn't choose is one of the other boxes that she chooses is 2\n\n### Example\n\nFour people take turns choosing boxes from 7 given boxes. The 1st person picks 2, the 2nd person picks a box that was not picked by either the 1st or the 3rd person, the remaining 4 choices for the 3rd person were those left over by the 2nd person and the 1st person, the remaining 5 choices for the 4th person were those left over from the 1st person and whichever option the 2nd person did not choose. Every time a box is picked the total number of boxes taken by the current person is increased by 4 (by adding 1 and then taking that number from the total box limit of 7). To break it down further: if there were 9 boxes at one point in time, 7 of which were taken by the 1st person (and are now available again) the 2nd person takes 4 and the 4th person takes 9 boxes - the remaining 3 boxes being ignored. After the 3rd person takes 3 boxes there will only be the one box left (that the 1st person did not pick)\n\n### Note\nThe probability is simply 25% and not 16.6% per the choice, since that is based on the assumption that all other boxes have equal probability,", "answer": "A: few people"}

Once it was done, calculate the area and the sector, in order to know which way the first arc would need to be moved, in order to get the same angles. You can also calculate how many degrees the angle is, to have an exact value of which arc needs to be moved.\n\n### Solution with Code:We will calculate the sector first, using the formula `sector(A) = pi * r^2` where we know `r = 4` and `A = \u03c0 / 3`, and we will substitute `\u03c0` with `3.14`. We know that the perimeter is `2\u03c0r = 2(3.14)(4) = 25.36` and the area is `A = \u03c0r^2 = 3.14(4)^2 = 52.56` and we know that `b = 14` and after we divide `b` by `\u03c0r` and we get `b/\u03c0r = 0.2657`, since we need a value between `[0,1]` we will multiply it by `2` and we get `2b = 2.2657`. We substitute that value in the area formula and we get `A = pi * r^3 * 2 = 74.12`. We also know what the perimeter of the circle is, and how many degrees each sector has. We could also know that the perimeter of the outer circle is `2*3.14*6 = 53.92`. Therefore, we know the value of the angle that it should turn, because we know that it needs to turn by half of the circumference, plus `360\u00b0 - 53.9\u00ba = 306.1\u00ba`.\n\nNow, we want to subtract `306.1` from `540` to get how much degree the new arc needs to turn.\nBecause", "answer": "C: kitchen"}

What are the chances of this number being a multiple of (4).\n\n### Response:(32 points). \n\n##### Description:\nWrite a response that appropriately answers the question.\n\n##### Explanation:\nTo answer this question, we have to figure out which numbers do NOT have 3 as a multiple at some point in the number. So we can start by splitting the numbers into parts. We can do this using two if statements to see if the last or the first digit is smaller than 4, respectively. We can split the first if statement again into an if-else statement to see if the digit is a one. Then we can check if the number is a multiple of 3 or not using the number as input into the function isMultiple(num, three) where three is a variable that takes in three as an int. So we can split the main answer into three smaller statements that can all be ran one at a time, and then check the outcome.\n\n### Input(30 points):\nThe average weekly income of a family is $26000, the average of 2 people working in the family together.\n\n### Response(40 points):\n\n##### Description\nWrite a function, averageWorkers(income) that calculates the number of people, work in a family to have an average weekly income of $2600.\n\n##### Response\n```\nfunction averageWorkers(incone) {\n\t//code here\n\treturn inonce;\n}\n```\n### Input:\nBrian just turned 16.

He took home that night and finished it. The next day he arrived at school late but left early that day, he found that he had missed 183 points on his homework. How much did the boy miss the following night?\n\n###Response:\nThe question gives us information about a boy, and it indicates that the points are lost. It is important to realize that these points are lost each time he misses the homework, which implies that these points are lost because the homework is not done. The information in the sentence says that if he is done with the homework the next day he will lose 183 points. This means that if he finishes the homework on the last day, then he loses 183 points from that night. Therefore, he does not lose it. So, we get that the boy loses exactly 183 points at night.\n\n###Input: An old man was sitting in a cafe waiting for someone. He counted the flies on the wall. He counted 930 flies.

If one factor is 5 times the other, which is the larger factor? Choices: A: 4 B: 5 C: 6 D: 7\n\n### Response The larger factor is 6. A B C D: All of the choices would result in a smaller factor. To find the largest factor of 74, we can either multiply 74 by the common factor or we can divide it by the largest factor. If we multiply, we will divide by 2. So the product of the two factors must be equal to 37 which is not enough. Thus we must multiply by the largest factor. That means we will get 138x5 so factor 74 is equal to 39. If we divide 74 by the largest factor, we get 28 so it must be the larger of 28 or 39. Both of those are divisible by 5 so 5 must be the largest factor\n\n### Experiment:\nMultiply 74 x F\n\nThen check to see if it is divisible by largest factor of 73\n\nIf not largest factor is too big.\n\nDivide 73 by L\n\nThen check to\n\nanswer is 39\n\n##", "answer": "A: school"}

While on a highway outside of Portland, OR, he notices a strange-looking ship. The ship is approximately 7 feet above the water at high tide, and the waterline is 10 feet above sea level. This means that the waterline rises 3 feet every 10 days. The speed of the ship is 1 mile every 10 days and its travel direction is southwest. If it travels directly southwest on a certain date, is it 50 miles from its destination?\n\nAnswer:\n\n1. What is the ship traveling? Southwest\n\n2.

Danny had  20 more than total Rachael has.\n\n\n ## If Rachael and Danny had  80 apples together, or  Rachael  and  Danny each have 90 apples total Rachael  has  90 -  20 = 70   or Rachael  have 70+40 = 110   or total Rachael and Danny together, Rachael have  90 +20 = 112 or Rachael have  91\n## Rachael have 90 + 2 apples\n\n###\nRachael had 99 apples plus 2 apples Danny had. if it was the total of what Danny and rachael have, then, and if it wasn't, it would be, total sum of 99 and 2 must be 97, therefore if Rachael had 99 + 2, then Danny had 1 less than that\n\n## ##\n\n### Instructions- Write the following questions as if you are giving a problem solving instruction.\n\n### Difficulty:Medium\n\n### 9, Multiple Choice Question:\n\n### Dictiion:\nEight of the boys in class eat cereal but only eight.

{"text": "A\n\n### Instructions:Read the following math passage and then answer the questions that follow.\n\nDarwin\u2019s theory of evolution says that species arise and adapt to their environment. But biologists have discovered an oddity in the evolution of turtles. Turtles live in an amazing variety of environments and can be as different from one another as polar bears are from housecats. But the different kinds of turtles almost never evolve from their close relatives. Instead, many kinds of turtles seem to have evolved independently of one another. For example, box turtles in the western plains don\u2019t resemble box turtles in east, and snapping turtles in the Great Lakes don't resemble snapping turtles found on the coasts or in rivers. Even the common painted turtles that you may have in your own pond may differ a great deal from the painted turtles found in a marsh or in a lake. Turtles look like they shouldn't be closely related, and indeed, they don't seem to be related. They have different origins.\n\nSome scientists believe that when a group of organisms gets together for a migration, one turtle can get separated from the others. If it survives, it may mate with the local turtles there and produce a new kind. Those new kinds may then be able to evolve different ways to survive, and so they don't have to worry about turtles from another group getting in the way.\n\nThese two theories may not prove to be the only ones that explain the independence of turtle species, but as scientists look more closely at turtle evolution, these two ideas are becoming harder and harder to ignore. And they suggest the possibility, according to scientists, that new species are occasionally produced without evolutionary change.\n\nInput:Darwin\u2019s Theory of evolution says that species come into existence and become adapted to their environment.  But what did the biologists discover about the evolution of turtle?\nAnswer: Turtles in distinctly different habitats came into existence without any evolutionary change. \n\nInput:Which of the four statements below correctly explains why turtles look like they were not created from each other?\nAnswer: TURTLES HAVE DIFFERENT ORIGINS", "answer": "A: appear suddenly"}

If she mixes them together in one container, how much juice does she have?\n\n### Response 4\n\n### Input Eight fishermen are headed out to sea for a trip. They decide to share an even number of fish, but they disagree about how many to share. The first fisherman thinks that each of them should get four times how many fish he had the last time; for example, if he got 2 fish then he would get 8 fish. The second agrees but has an extra stipulation; all the fish are evenly divided after they give each fisherman an equal number of fish. The third thinks they should take their fish counts backwards and if each fisherman gets four times how many fish they got the last time. The fourth doesn\u2019t think they should go in that order and suggests they just take the fish that they have and divide the catch evenly between them without making any further calculations. The fifth fisherman decides that this last suggestion will work, but the fishermen will take turns giving the rest away before divying the remainder between them evenly. After all the fishermen have taken a turn, each man will get as many fish as was left after all the other fishermen have received their 4x amount. The sixth fisherman says that this is ok, but they should also divide their fish equally. The seventh fisherman disagrees and thinks they should divide their fish equally minus their final amount. For example, if each fisherman has a final amount of 11 he thinks the final amount should be divided using 13 (11+2) instead of 6. After the fishermen divide the remaining fish evenly, each man would have the final fisherman\u2019s amount minus 5. The eighth fisherman disagrees again and thinks every fisherman should get half of what was left after splitting each fishermans fish twice and dividing the remaining fish equally.

Rather they mean if you do not need someone, you are not calling on them when you use them. The word \u201cto spare\u201d is often used after a verb to indicate that the verb in question is done in a manner that keeps a person\u2019s needs in mind.

She has room for 6 people in her car, and she will be driving herself. She will be splitting the gas cost for her trip with each passenger, $3 at a time. If her mom has driven her to the car and doesn?t know how many people Jessica has brought, what is the most the number of rides her mom has had to make in order for her mom to stay out of the car for the whole drive?\n\n### Demostration/Method:\nSolution\nTo find the number of rides made by the driver, we can simply divide the $3 gas cost among the passengers. If we calculate the number of rides that the driver has taken us by dividing $3 by the cost, we get 6, meaning the most number of rides the driver has made is 6, including her. After this, we find the number of rounds we made by dividing $3 and we get 5.\n\n### Solved Input:\nJessica has a car and is going on a trip where there are a total of 7 other people on a hike. She has room in her car for 6 people and is going to split the gas cost for her journey with each passenger, $6 at a time.  Her brother drives her at the beginning and ends of her journey, so he is in the car with each passenger. He has 3 passengers at a time going in the direction where he is going. Each time his is in his car with passengers, he is doing 2 rounds.  How many rounds is each passenger in the car?\n\n### Method:\nSolution\nBecause we have the same question and same method, we just need to divide the amount of gas cost $6 of the amount of passenger, in this case 7 and the question has $3 for each round. So it just takes one round and we get the question answered. You can use a spreadsheet here to solve this faster.\n\n### More Explanations, Tips,", "answer": "C: meeting"}

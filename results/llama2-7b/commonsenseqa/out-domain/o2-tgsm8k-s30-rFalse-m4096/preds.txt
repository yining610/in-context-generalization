Choice A: The longer distance in terms of length B: One more than twice as long as the shorter one C: One smaller than twice as long as one of them D: The same as the number of grams that can be represented by one gram<n>Output: Choice B: Let's have a look at this question. Given that 1.50 kilograms = 2.71 pounds and 20. 0 centimeters = 7.8784 inches. We have, x gram/ pound = 2.7386. So, x gram = 2.7 x 1 pound = 7.04 pounds. Now, we need to convert 704 x 100 grams = 70400 gram. 7040 = 30146 gram in one inch as the conversion factor 39.37 inch is used here. The same result can be obtained if we use the conversion factor 25.4 inch = 1pound. So, the length equal to 3014.6 inch.

We would like to find the sum of the values of the digits.  For instance, the string "4512" would have value 4512.  There are several problems in the input, though.  (a) We are given the string as a character array, when we actually need an integer array.  We must do some conversion of elements from the string to the integer type for this task.  (b) We are given an alphabetically ordered list of the character in the string.  We must convert these into the corresponding position in the integer array.  (c) Once we have done both of these steps, we find that each character in the string is assigned an increasing value, but we are given the number from the string, the "sum" for a given element, without regard for the placement of the digits.<n>(d)  This last problem is easily solved by computing the product of the position of each element and its value.  The entire assignment may be simplified by using a simple algorithm for this problem.  We could then write a simple while loop, that does the necessary conversion.<n><n>(e) We could do all of this using some simple programming structures.  A recursive call might be one possibility.  In fact, we could build the array from the bottom up as well.  We begin by populating the array from 99 down to 1.  Next, we use a recursive call to find the sum of each of the numbers from 1 to 8, and then reassign the values of the numbers from 9 to 8 to the current value.

The people of this small town are notorious for gathering together in bars to discuss problems; it often helps when they gather together to drink. As a result, all local bars immediately packed full until they reached double maximum capacity. They all decide to move to higher ground at the same time, taking all their patrons with them. A local bar owner is a realist, and so he doesn't bother trying to remove the patrons that have been left behind from his establishment. Everyone piled in, and so he had no choice but to drive his pickup truck to take the remaining patrons to higher ground. He had one pickup, which held 12 people, and each patron needed 5 seconds to move to his destination. The town had 5 local bars. How long did it take to evacuate everyone from the town?<n>Output: 2

In a two-player game, they place an ante before the cards are dealt.  In a no-limit game (which means that there is no limit to the amount the player can bet of any given hand), a player can bet the entire amount of his chips, if he feels lucky and he is able to afford it.  However, players may never lose more that their chips are worth.  If a player needs to add funds to keep playing and he does not have the money on hand, he must borrow money.  A player may borrow up to the amount he has in the pot minus the current bets or raises.  A hand must be raised at least three times for a player to win the pot.  A player may raise as many times as he chooses, as long as he is not reraised.  A reraise occurs when the player raising was raised one or more times.

In the first question, the answer is 310 because it's a negative integer (30) multiplied<n>       by positive integers (1, 2,..., 11). That's the same as the multiplicative<n>       inverse of negative integers, so the answer is $310.<n><n>2. Same logic. In the second question, we know the answer will be positive<n>       because it's the negative of the total driving time: $\ \left(<n>       \frac{60}{1}\times 40 + \frac{60}{\frac{1}{1}}\times40+ \frac{60\times10<n>       }{60}\times40\right)\times\left(\frac{60\ \text{hours}\ \div \frac{1}{60}<n>       \right) $<n><n>3.

Find one question that you have doubts for (can't understand what they're asking, can't figure out which answer should be picked)<n><n>The solution for this multiple choice question is 310 and I'm not sure why.<n><n>### 2. What answer did you originally pick, and why?<n><n>I am thinking that it's 396 because 3 days is.05 so you multiple it with the three times 396 is 118 with an extra 20 dollars added.<n><n>### What did you do to solve the question:<n><n>To solve the question what I did was break down the problem into a few equations and then plugged them in to see what the answer was. That helped me solve the problem.<n><n>### How did you come to the answer you chose:<n><n>I added each amount that was in the equation to get the total.<n><n>### Was there ever a point during which you were unsure about a particular problem? If so, what was it? How did you stop doubting yourself?<n><n>Yes. I was a little unsure about the question three which asked what was driving that we got in accidents the answer was a)stressful which I don't agree with.<n><n>### Did you experience any "Aha!" moments?<n><n>Yes because a lot of the questions on coding doodle I answered the last way I would have done it and I didn't know how to explain to the students what I was doing.<n><n>### Reflecting on your experience<n><n>The experience was really fun. I learned different things about coding doodle in a different way which showed how it helped improve my coding. The way I was doing things before coding doodle was by typing the code and seeing immediately what I did wrong but this time that happened like a million times because coding doodle gave me immediate feedback to what was wrong and it showed me how to do it the right way so I wouldn't make the same mistake again which helped my confidence.<n><n>### Were there questions you didn't know the answers to?<n><n>Yes. The ones I didn't know was the questions that I didn't understand.<n><n><n>

She quickly sees that his annual wages for the year are $77,000, and that he has already made a substantial $20,000 down payment on the house that she approved him for a week ago. Mr. Rackham appears pleased with our loan officer’s assessment of his creditworthiness and now says it is the time to proceed with signing the loan documents and paying the down payment. With her expert knowledge, she assures Mr. Rackham that it will be much easier and faster to electronically sign an on line contract from his laptop computer. She says that he simply needs to log onto the bank’s website and click on a link to the loan application page.

The broker, who has heard all about the advantages, readily agrees. Mr. Rackhman is not so sure why he should use it. His concern is being asked to transmit his full credit card number to the bank. This information is not on any of the papers that he already has printed. He is suspicious of this strange request from the loan officer, but decides to proceed and send this much needed first payment. The two men and his wife soon begin to celebrate as a week of hectic activities in their home purchase finally comes to an end. She quickly checks on the website and sees that Mr. Rackham's payment has been recorded in the bank’s automated system. Now she looks again and the contract has now been signed on line electronically in front of her. This event is an indication that bank systems are becoming more automated and electronic.<n><n>What happens next when Mr. and Mrs. Rackham are notified by mail, one day later, that their requested housing loan has been approved by the bank.<n>The Rackham’s realize that they were able to do everything on line, electronically signing the contracts and sending the required down payment to the bank.<n>Now they know how simple and easy it was to get their loan from

About two-thirds of all the reptiles in the region were threatened with extinction.  One large monitor lizard species disappeared from the region completely in 1999, and another declined by 35% in a decade.<n><n>A 1988 study showed that of the 15 species of primates living in the region, 13 were threatened. One species, the common sifaka, was thought to have disappeared around 1971. Its disappearance was due in part to the bushmeat trade, a wildlife conservation crisis in which primates that had historically eaten fruit were eating the wildlife in their native environment and decreasing their own populations.

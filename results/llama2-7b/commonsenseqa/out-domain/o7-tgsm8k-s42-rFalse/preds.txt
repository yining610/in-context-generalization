For instance, the choice of department store is possible, but unlikely, as department stores are not only large in size, but expensive, and the student choice could be expensive and large or small.<n>

The council must make their decision based on population, average household income, proximity to city centers, and the area's total expenditure level. The council has fourteen voting members who spend a great deal of time collecting data and trying to put forth a unanimous proposal. Ultimately, six council members vote to build the road in area W, two of them vote for the road in area M, and six of them vote to reject the road to either area R or T. However, the proposal was rejected by the council for that reason, and the road is not built where it may be needed most.<n>A. If the council had only four or fewer votes each for both of the proposals, area W would likely have been selected.<n>B. If the council had six votes to build in area M, area R would be the most likely destination for the road. However, area T could still be a strong possibility.<n>C. The most important factors taken into consideration were the location of the new road and the total expenditure level within each area.<n>D. The council does not know whom to blame. They know, however, that someone must be faulted.<n>E. If the council had five additional votes to put toward either area T or R, the former might be the likely new location for the road.<n>* C<n><n>### Input<n>In order to pass his math class, Frank needs to attain an average of 70% on his tests.

Choices:  A: backery B: ham sandwich C: fridge D: butcher shop E: freezer<n><n>### Response:		C<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>The question seems like it is referring to a meat product that can be frozen so that it lasts for a long period of time, rather than having a shelf life. This excludes the fridge, as it is a place that it is stored while it is meant to be eaten. While a ham sandwich would last about a hour if it was left out, which is long enough to make a single sandwich, frozen meat could be thawed out and be a long lasting food option. The freezer and the butcher shop seem like good answers, however those two would not make it last a long period of time. The butcher shop is where the meat is not stored, so when the meat is frozen, then it would be in its own location, where it may make the food rot, or it may make it mold. Freezers do keep the meat cold enough, however, the freezer will only cool the meat, this may make the meat last a long time, but without air flowing through it, then the microbes that live in the meat will not be moving, causing a buildup of the microbes, which in turn, will cause the meat to go bad.<n>

The Web is a means of providing information to the public and is often a gateway to the Internet.  The Internet is a public network of interconnected computers that communicate and exchange information.<n><n>### Input:-The Internet (or Network) is a world of computers that communicate with each other. In these systems, information is stored and moved from one device to another.<n><n># **The Internet or Wide Area Network (WAN)** refers to a system in which computers communicate as a single entity or a whole.  In the Internet, a connection is made between two devices through the use of data transmitting services.  In the United States, this type of system is called a Wide Area Network (or WAN).  It was first created in the 1960s to allow computers to communicate with satellites.<n>The term Internet is used for both the general public and the military.   The former uses the World Wide Web, and the latter uses the Internet.   As more and more people use the Wide Area Network (the military has the biggest networks in the world), it will become necessary to create a separate system for each area of communication.  The name of the new system will be called the Internet.<n><n># **Wide Area Networks (WAN)** (or Wide Area Networks, or WAN) are private networks that connect geographically dispersed locations together.  They are more expensive to deploy (compared to, say, a local area network) because of the need for complex network equipment such as routers and firewalls, but they are important as they provide high-bandwidth connections over greater distances than local networks.<n><n>---<n>    <n><n>### Instrumental variable:<n>An instrumental variable is a confounding variable, which is a causal mechanism for another variable.

Some people exercise more often due to an increase in energy expenditure, which may be one component of smoking relief. It may be because of the feeling of a healthy body.

If I don't exercise, my body won't get the nutrients it needs from food every day. The other is that exercising helps us stay healthy in the long run.<n><n>### Another example response:<n>We exercise to exercise, but in the end, we may benefit from it. It is the most important benefit of exercise. A bad habit is anything which makes us feel uncomfortable, or makes us feel that someone thinks we should have a bad habit.<n><n>### A good idea comes from many sources, from a friend who tells you to do something, to a parent who encourages you to keep doing it.<n><n>### How do you exercise? If you want to improve your cardiovascular system, you need to move your body to reduce the stress it faces. If you want to reduce stress, you need to use more of your muscles. We may increase energy expenditure by exercising so as not to increase stress.<n><n>### Many physical therap

Choices:  A: learning B: painful memories C: thinking D: awe inspiring E: pleasure<n><n>### Response:		If you choose to be able to think about your memories in other ways, perhaps you may be able to see things differently.

At the end of the 3 years, the Aaron will start to recieve $27 from his savings account.

You need to give him advices. Write a letter answering his questions.<n><n>### For example:<n>Mr. Smith,<n><n>I'm very concerned about your situation. I've tried to keep the money issues to myself, but your letters and phone calls have made me take a second look at the situation.<n><n>You have requested a loan for several thousand dollars. The reason you aren't able to receive the money at this moment is due to insufficient assets and financial records. Your personal expenses are over $30,000, while total net income is only $13,000 per year. You only have $1,000 available on your credit card, and you have a second mortgage on your property that is about to be foreclosed. You are receiving multiple phone calls, letters, and even people ringing the door on your home daily, trying to collect you. There are also numerous people in court who are trying to collect from you.<n><n>Please reconsider your situation, or else I will have to file Bankruptcy over your debt and sell your property, which will end up in the hands of another individual who will not be able to pay down your debt, even with his 10 times more income.<n><n>-A friend of yours<n><n>### Instructors' Comment:<n><n>This response is just okay. There is no good closing sentence for requesting your debt from the borrower because you haven’t mentioned the reason of writing your debt in paragraph one and you didn’t introduce yourself in paragraph two. Also, your paragraph three is kind of weird. You mentioned Bankruptcy in paragraph one and now in paragraph three you write “…or else I will have to…”. Why would you need to write that? It’s just okay, so I will give you some score.<n>

Choices:  A: contagious B: wrong C: last forever D: painful E: blind<n><n>### Response:		C<n><n>### Justification: <n><n>#### A: contagious<n><n>Contagious is not the correct word. Contagious can mean that something makes you want to do it and the more you do it, the more it makes you want to do. It's contagious when you have to stop doing it (see below).<n><n>#### B: wrong<n><n>Alright, so love is never wrong, even if it hurts. Love is never contagious, either. Contagion is only associated with a negative thing. So B is out.<n><n>#### D: painful<n><n>Love itself is not associated with pain. I can say it made me cry like a fool and feel like it's the end of the world, but I can't equate those emotions with love.<n><n>#### E: blind<n><n>Love is also not blind. It sees what most people can’t. People may be blind from what they see in love, or at the very least, blind to what it means to others, but that is not what we mean by love being blind.<n><n>#### C: last forever<n><n>Love is the answer to life, and the way in which we can be whole. It does not come with an expiration date.<n>

If he deposited an additional $100 every month into the account to add to his initial investment of $1000, how much money will he have in the fund after two years?<n>Answer: 3982<n><n>### Input:My house is very dry, with little water in the air. What tool should I use to fix this? Choices:  A: humidifier B: surface of earth C: skating rink D: ice cube E: burn it to the ground<n><n>### Response:		<n>Choices:<n>If the water evaporates quickly, or easily, such as on the surface of the Earth, the air around the water will be cooler than the surrounding dry air. We say that the air is moist as it has more H2O (H2O is a liquid) than the surrounding air. If the water is contained, instead of on the surface of the earth, the air will try to equalize the humidity of the area around the water.<n>This will result in cool, moist air from the water being pushed up and away from the surface the water resides on.<n>Think about the air as being a liquid that has moistening properties. The vapors in the air are held by chemical bonds. Like a sponge, if the vapors come in to contact with an area on the surface of the sponge in which it hasn’t been wet before, it will retain water, like how the water in the vapors will cool the air around an area and it will try to fill a void.<n>

Where might he have been? Choices:  A: disneyland B: snow C: windowsill D: street E: summer<n><n>### Response:		Choice: C<n><n>### Input :<n>The school decided to reduce the student uniform prices by $12. The new prices are now $68-$74 if ordered in bulk, $70-80 if ordered online, $14 if hand sewn, and $50 for store bought uniforms.  They noticed a rise of $17 in sales due to the new policy.  What was the increase of sales?<n><n>### Result:<n>There was a $169 increase in sales. The school realized that if they reduced the price of each uniform by $12, then they would make $169 more per uniform if they reduced the price.<n><n>### Comment:<n>I did not notice the change of $12 before but you do realize it's the same as $12 x 1x1x1x1 x1x1<n><n>### Instructions :<n>After looking, you realize that you could have saved money before getting the sandwich.  Now that you know it only costs $5 to get the sandwich, what is the value of $5 to you?<n><n>### Input Response:<n>It's the same as I value $10 and it takes you $10 to get the sandwich.<n><n>### Result Response:<n>I know you are in 6th grade so you don't know how to solve for this.  Instead, to make it easy, I will tell you to imagine that a dollar is worth 100 cents.  Say that you want to get $10 worth of hamburger.  You get a burger for about $5.  So that means that 5 burgers cost you just one dollar.  Now, when you get the hamburger is worth $10 to you.  If you had that $10 before, then you could have saved it and not had to pay for the hamburger.  So when the hamburger is $5, it's only worth $1 to you because you spent $5 to buy the hamburger.<n><n>### <n><n>

Because of his mistake, he spent 8 years somewhere. Where was he? Choices:  A: prison B: bridge C: locked up D: homeless shelter E: neighbor's house<n><n>### Response:		If I had to choose, I'd vote for 'E', because I was going to say 'locked up'. However, the question states that he's going to choose the correct answer with the most logical order. So I'll go with the only one that makes sense as to why he's in prison so long.<n><n>### Input:(An addition) You are at a candy store; you and your friend decide to play a little game together. If you collect the 7th candy in the row, you get a free candy bar. So you begin to collect all the candies, you got 1 candy. Your friend decided he would also play the game, and he collects the 8th candy. If there are a total of 700 candies, how many candy bars does your friend receive?<n><n>### Response:(An addition) I would use the number of candy bars that is given to my friend, 8, and subtract seven times from that number (8 minus 7 equals 1). The final solution is 140, which is rounded up.<n><n>### (Your addition)<n>I think it is logical to do addition, but if you subtract 7 times from 140, you arrive to 133 which is incorrect.<n>I guessed the answer will be 140, but I was wrong.<n><n>### I understand that. I agree to that, but in that question, the 140 came from the fact that they collected the 7th candies, so they go to the 7th one. They got one candy bar, which is 140. That's why I had that answer as my final one.<n><n>### Your answer<n>Because my friend got the 7th one, he had the 7th number in the row. He gets the 7th number of candies which is 7. (11 subtracts seven) 42<n><n>### I knew that my friend got 7-7= 0, and 0 would not be a candy bar, and that's why that would not be the final answer.<n>

It's time to eat lunch and there's a lot of chatter on the bus as well as music. Everyone takes out their phones and a loud fight breaks out between two boys over some girl. While this is happening, the bus driver gets an email on their phone from their boss. The email reads "Our customers have complained about the lack of respect on your buses. We only allow singing, reading, or talking during school bus rides." What is the correct answer? Choices: A: The bus driver should drive the bus to the school and get rid of the loud fights. B: The bus should stop by the mall and drop the kids off. C: The bus should stop and let the boy know, "This kind of behavior is not allowed on our bus."

A large amount of the shaving kits will also have double edge razors.]<n>C: B [Explanation:A drug store is primarily a store that sells medication.

Choices:  A: sign language B: complete sentence C: drink tea D: feel angry E: cross street<n><n>### Response:		Answer: A<n><n>An individual to use sign language is an option you could use to help a person. If someone doesn't know what to say to you, but the person can understand you, then it can be as quick and easy as signing.<n>If someone is unable to speak, or they are not able to communicate, they can write you a note.<n>Another possible choice would be to be angry, but that would mean that the person could be upset and not happy about the communication that isn't happening between the two of you. Crossing the street would also be a choice, but the person could easily get hit or be run over by a car if they decide they want to find the street that goes where they need to go.<n><n>### Input:"It is 3.4 miles to the supermarket.

Then measuring the time it takes to drive to the destination.<n><n>### Response<n><n>As you can see from the graph, when the speed is 5 miles per hour, the time it takes is 16.4 minutes, which equals to.09 miles per second, but in my estimation it takes 70 seconds. I did that by adding a little bit of extra distance to take into consideration when making a turn.

It would look strange and I wouldn’t be able to hide anything.  I like how they talk. I’d rather be the most thoughtful and careful one.  It may seem like I’m a little bit nervous or have a certain mood, but I haven’t been able to understand myself for a long time.  They probably have the same problem.  They think they’re not thinking about their problems too much and that I’m the one who is doing more.  They’re right, but I don’t want to talk to them about this and they can be really impatient.  It’s a small problem.  It’s not so bad to think about things.  I want to keep doing things the way I have.  It’s more important to me than to have other people be a little bit more relaxed and to have our own lives.<n><n>### Solution:Write your own solution and show your work.<n><n>

Choices:  A: lot of grief B: depression C: no spouse D: lose money E: children suffer<n><n>### Response:		When people get divorced there is many different types of grief.  For example, if a couple that has been married for several years is getting divorced they might be grieving over the marriage they thought they would have.  Another grief can be financial.  When people get divorced their income is going to go down due to one spouse not being in the household.  The last thing to grieve is there is going to be a child that is going to get upset that their family is going to change.  All of these can affect someone other than a spouses when people are getting divorced. Therefore, I would answer that divorcing two people has a negative effect on the other spouse.<n><n>### Input:(1 point) If you had 140 cans of Red Bull, Coke, and Pepsi and sold all the cans for $2 each, how much money would that be?

This sequence is created by adding the previous two numbers together to get the next number, and then subtracting 1. For example, 0+1=1, 1+1=2, 1+2=3, 2+3=5, and so on. Leonardo’s sequence became known as a “golden” sequence when he noticed a beautiful mathematical pattern in it. Here is what he observed: the square root, phi, of the sum of any two consecutive numbers in the sequence is always the same. The pattern is that the sum of any two numbers in the sequence divided by the square root of that sum is always equal to the next number in the sequence. This golden pattern repeats itself in the sequence endlessly, and even in the Fibonacci sequence of plant growth, as it grows the branching pattern in the branches, leaves, petals, and stems. <n><n>1.

First, you take the total number of people attending the conventions and multiply that by an estimate of $300 per person per day to arrive at a cost of $104,000. Then, you subtract that by the amount saved by getting the rates, which would be $5,000, leaving you with $99,000. Next, you subtract this amount from the remaining budget, which was $120,000. So you end up with the answer of $45,000 that you have to leave in the budget for the next convention.<n>

When Aiden heard the school news announcement about a 13-year-old boy with cancer named Kyle, he knew that no one could come up with the money or fundraising ideas to pay for Kyle’s hospital bills. Instead, Aiden gathered a large group of students to help, because he realized that everyone could find a way to contribute, even if they didn’t have a lot of money of their own.   Everyone was able to bring supplies and time to help with fund raising. A lot of people made and sold t-shirts for the cause. Aiden had so many ideas for how to raise money that he took time after school and came up with more ideas while he was in science class.   Aiden came up with all of these ideas on his own. He decided to organize a large event, a charity basketball game, in which the two rival teams would play a competitive, but friendly game and then raise money for the cause. The game raised over $23,000.<n><n>### Output:Rearrange some pairs of words to make the meaning clear. Use the word bank on the second page to help with any difficult words<n><n>### Answer:

Choices:  A: table B: restaurant C: cupboard D: kitchen E: sink<n><n>### Response:		<n>#### Answer: The answer is D.<n>#### Reason: <n>The answer is D because in a real-life setting, there are many places to put silverware after a meal.  The dishwasher, sink, kitchen cabinet, and even under the table (if you have a tablecloth) can all suffice for storing away used silverware.  If you're not sure where to put it after a meal in your own home and don't usually keep your silverware cleaned off throughout the meal, then you should clean it off immediately after use and put them away in the right place before you forget about them. Or better yet, clean them off before you sit down to eat!<n><n>### Input:"When you want, what do you think you do?"

The options that are given are not what a typical child who has siblings at home would do when they want something. Typically, they would go to their siblings and ask for something; they wouldn't have to think about it because they wouldn't be thinking about it.<n><n>### Input;"I want, who else?" Choices: <n><n>### Response<n><n>The answer is A.<n><n>###  Reason: <n><n>The answer is 1. You don't have another option here. You're not going to ask anyone else if you already know who's coming and who's not.<n>

Choices:  A: happiness B: sore muscles C: injury D: perfection E: errors<n><n>### Response:		B<n><n>### Demo:<n>Baseball is a sport that keeps track of many things. They do many different stats in the game. In baseball, errors are the mistakes the players make. Every time the ball is hit in the fiel and thrown to home plate or first, the coach says the players made an error in that play.<n><n>### Solution:<n>Baseball is the only sport that keeps track these stats in other sports. But I think basketball, soccer, and other sports should start doing this. In basketball players count how many times the ball rolls their side, and they don't play well on that play they count that error. Like how in baseball, they count how many time the fielders throw the ball and it is late getting to home plate or first base. They should start using this stat in other sports.<n><n><n>### Input/Response demo:<n>Input: A: Is it a girl or boy?

Each card is either a real object or the word “fake.” The objects are organized from lowest to highest, with A on the first card, B on the second, C on the third, et cetera. You pick a card that has a real object on the front and you ask for its position from the person you’re with. Write down the position number they give you, and if it has an even or an odd number for a position, write “E” or “O” respectively. They are correct if and only if your answer is E if the object is real and O if the object is not real. How many cards will you have to guess before you have a 100% chance of getting the answer right?<n><n>In order to achieve your objective of having a 100 percent chance of getting an right answer, you simply need to use one card so long as that card is real.<n><n>### Analysis:<n>The task is asking for the most cards that can be used in order to achieve 100 percent certainty of getting the right answer.  <n><n>The solution to this problem is to simply use 1 card, if that card is real.  This, when compared with all the possibilities, has an event frequency of 100 %.

Then skip a number every time you get to a 10. So 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100. This works well with the numbers from 10 to 60. In this case the numbers from 11 to 51 are all multiples of 10.<n><n>Step 2: If the third grade number is divisible by 10 then subtract 10. So if the third grader number is from 0 to 50 which means not divisible<n><n>Step 3: Take the number and subtract it from 100. If the remainder is 5 (rounded down) then the number is 3rd grade student. If the remainder is anything other than 5 then the number is either not 3rd grade or is past 50 students, since there are no fifth grade students.<n><n>### Output<n><n>Answer: 1<n>

What I'm thinking is that you would have to start out with the simple change being yourself, then you could move on to change your family followed by your community, and then you can move on to society. To do this we could use either A or D, as you are changing, but at each point there needs to be an explanation to the steps.<n><n>Another option to consider is to change clothes, or even change a group of people's minds. While neither of these options would be particularly good ones, they could at least be a starting point for the task so that they can be refined in future tasks in the course.

Choices:  A: walmart B: loft C: house D: home depot E: kitchen<n><n>### Response:		<n>"D"<n><n>### Instructions:<n>Answer the short answer question with the correct quantity.<n><n>### Detailed Solution:<n>In this task, a man went to Home Depot because he needed to buy some flooring for his entire house. A home depot is known to be a big store where you would need to walk around to find what you are looking for. Therefore, the correct quantity here should be "A": "walmart" because it would not make sense to describe a "big store" with a "small path". Wal-mart and home depot are both big stores and need a big path to walk around the entire store. Moreover, the word "entire" also proves if you were looking for some place that's big like home depot or wal-mart. <n><n>### Instructor: Answer the following multiple choice question<n><n>### Instrument:<n>**Q:** What is a good solution to the 4chan problem for preventing bots from posting in comments?<n><n>  - A: require registration<n>**Q:** Write a comment with 12 letters or more in length<n><n>### Response 1:<n>10 letters:<n><n>    this is a response with 10 letters in length<n><n>## Instruction:<n><n>### Instucter:<n>Answer the following short answer question<n>1  Q: Which of the following statements about a database management system(DBMS) is NOT true?<n>  A: It includes programming languages that communicate with DBMS<n>  B: It is a special type of programming language<n>  C: It is software that connects to servers<n>  D: DBMS stands for database managing system<n>2 Q: Which of the followig statements describes the difference between a database and a database system? <n>  A: There must be a database system in order to store data in a database<n><n>### Instuctor:<n>Please write comments as an answer <n><n>## Response 1:<n>### 1Q: Database Management System(DBMS): It is a set of programs that manage data.

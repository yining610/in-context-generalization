{"text": "C\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe question seems like it is referring to a meat product that can be frozen so that it lasts for a long period of time, rather than having a shelf life. This excludes the fridge, as it is a place that it is stored while it is meant to be eaten. While a ham sandwich would last about a hour if it was left out, which is long enough to make a single sandwich, frozen meat could be thawed out and be a long lasting food option. The freezer and the butcher shop seem like good answers, however those two would not make it last a long period of time. The butcher shop is where the meat is not stored, so when the meat is frozen, then it would be in its own location, where it may make the food rot, or it may make it mold. Freezers do keep the meat cold enough, however, the freezer will only cool the meat, this may make the meat last a long time, but without air flowing through it, then the microbes that live in the meat will not be moving, causing a buildup of the microbes, which in turn, will cause the meat to go bad.", "answer": "E: freezer"}

{"text": "### Excerpt from solution:\n\n### Instructions:\n\nThe number x was the sum of the digits of the number that came before x and the sum of the digits before that, and so on. In the example, the sum of the digits from 1 to 6 is 15. The number before 15 is 14. The sum of the digits of 14 is 1 + 4 = 5. The sum of the first 6 digits is 9 + 7 + 1 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 26. 5 + 26 = 31.\n\nThe numbers in the sequence get bigger as you go. The 43rd number in the sequence is 59. 1 + 9 + 5 + 1 = 16.

In the Internet, a connection is made between two devices through the use of data transmitting services.  In the United States, this type of system is called a Wide Area Network (or WAN).  It was first created in the 1960s to allow computers to communicate with satellites.\nThe term Internet is used for both the general public and the military.   The former uses the World Wide Web, and the latter uses the Internet.   As more and more people use the Wide Area Network (the military has the biggest networks in the world), it will become necessary to create a separate system for each area of communication.  The name of the new system will be called the Internet.\n\n# **Wide Area Networks (WAN)** (or Wide Area Networks, or WAN) are private networks that connect geographically dispersed locations together.

So that means that 5 burgers cost you just one dollar.  Now, when you get the hamburger is worth $10 to you.

The final solution is 140, which is rounded up.\n\n### (Your addition)\nI think it is logical to do addition, but if you subtract 7 times from 140, you arrive to 133 which is incorrect.\nI guessed the answer will be 140, but I was wrong.\n\n### I understand that. I agree to that, but in that question, the 140 came from the fact that they collected the 7th candies, so they go to the 7th one. They got one candy bar, which is 140. That's why I had that answer as my final one.\n\n### Your answer\nBecause my friend got the 7th one, he had the 7th number in the row. He gets the 7th number of candies which is 7.

This sequence is created by adding the previous two numbers together to get the next number, and then subtracting 1. For example, 0+1=1, 1+1=2, 1+2=3, 2+3=5, and so on. Leonardo\u2019s sequence became known as a \u201cgolden\u201d sequence when he noticed a beautiful mathematical pattern in it. Here is what he observed: the square root, phi, of the sum of any two consecutive numbers in the sequence is always the same. The pattern is that the sum of any two numbers in the sequence divided by the square root of that sum is always equal to the next number in the sequence. This golden pattern repeats itself in the sequence endlessly, and even in the Fibonacci sequence of plant growth, as it grows the branching pattern in the branches, leaves, petals, and stems. \n\n1.

Every time the ball is hit in the fiel and thrown to home plate or first, the coach says the players made an error in that play.\n\n### Solution:\nBaseball is the only sport that keeps track these stats in other sports. But I think basketball, soccer, and other sports should start doing this. In basketball players count how many times the ball rolls their side, and they don't play well on that play they count that error. Like how in baseball, they count how many time the fielders throw the ball and it is late getting to home plate or first base. They should start using this stat in other sports.\n\n\n### Input/Response demo:\nInput: A: Is it a girl or boy?

{"text": "A\n\n### Input\n\nInput: You have a stack of cards, each of which has an object on the front and a number on the back. Each card is either a real object or the word \u201cfake.\u201d The objects are organized from lowest to highest, with A on the first card, B on the second, C on the third, et cetera. You pick a card that has a real object on the front and you ask for its position from the person you\u2019re with. Write down the position number they give you, and if it has an even or an odd number for a position, write \u201cE\u201d or \u201cO\u201d respectively. They are correct if and only if your answer is E if the object is real and O if the object is not real. How many cards will you have to guess before you have a 100% chance of getting the answer right?\n\nIn order to achieve your objective of having a 100 percent chance of getting an right answer, you simply need to use one card so long as that card is real.\n\n### Analysis:\nThe task is asking for the most cards that can be used in order to achieve 100 percent certainty of getting the right answer.  \n\nThe solution to this problem is to simply use 1 card, if that card is real.  This, when compared with all the possibilities, has an event frequency of 100 %.  There are only two possibilities (being real or being fake), and we know that when real, the response will always be the correct one (the current position of that card), which is why it is chosen.\n\n### Solution:\nIn this case analysis, a solution has been chosen based on a particular problem.\n\n### Input - Task\n\nInput:\n\n<img src=\"task1.png\" alt=\"task1.png\"/>\n\nOutput:\n\nIn the above diagram, the task depicts a group of people being offered an exercise and a reward for completing the exercise.

Before the dancer's returned home, they decided to plant a small sapling in the yard to mark their visit to the countryside.

{"text": "### Answer: Explanation:\n\n\n## 2019-06-19 18:07:30\n\n### Instructions: Write a recursive formula to solve the following problem.\n\n### Problem Statement: You are at an amusement park with 6 adults and 3 children. You get on 5 rides. There are 3 roller-coasters, 2 carousels, and 1 ferry. If each roller-coaster takes 5 minutes to ride, a carousel takes 2 minutes to ride, and a ferry takes 3 minutes to ride, and you spend half an hour riding each different type of ride, how long does it take you to ride all the rides?\n\n### Solution. 1st step:\n\n### Solution:\n\n### Answer with Explanation\n\n### Solution 2\n\n\n### Input\nWe are going to a zoo and we are considering going to three different exhibits: reptiles, large mammals, and small mammals. It will take one hour to go to an exhibit, an hour to see everything, and then one hour to exit the zoo. How long will it take us to see everything if we go to at least one of the exhibits and then exit?\n\n### Answer\n\n\n### Output\nThe number of minutes it takes to see everything is\n10\n\n### Explanation\nWe can see the following sequence:\nGo to zoo =\nExit zoo =\nGo to reptiles\n     Go to big mammals\n     Go to small mammals\n     Exit zoo\nWe go to zoo each time, we go to big mammals only once, we go to small mammals only once. We will choose either reptiles or big mammals, and we will go to that exhibit once.\nThe time it takes is then 2+2=4 times the time it takes to go to the zoo, so 8 times the time it takes reptiles. Since, one hour is the same as 60 minutes, and each time we go to an exhibit we spend 1 hour there and 1 hour to watch it, 80 minutes is the the time to go to reptiles.\nThis is of course", "answer": "B: think"}

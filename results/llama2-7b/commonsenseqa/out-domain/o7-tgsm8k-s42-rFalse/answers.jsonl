Examples of inputs: \"Add three more items to the shopping list\", or \"Increase volume by two\".  Examples of outputs: \"I'll add that item to the list\", or \"Volume is now at 40%\".\n\nSome inputs and outputs will be on the exam.

Here are some of the most common ways this happens:\n\n* The input will remain the same, leading to an answer that will do something different.  For instance, even if it hasn't made the user lose a life, the game will still reset and put a life back up for that user.\n* The input will change for the user depending on whether or not they lost a life.  For instance, \"Your life is over\" will make a different response than \"You're doing great\".  Also, \"Your life is still there\" means that you did not lose it.\n* There will be an alert, or message, in response to an input before any action is taken.  For instance, you lose a life if you get caught by the monster.  If an alert is put in place in this case, you will see something like, \"You saw the monster\".  The alert is an input.  Without this information, there would be no idea whether or not you lost your life.\n\nHere are some examples of branching:\n\nInput: Go east\n\nResponse: My son, the wind is coming from the north\n\nInput: Go southeast\n\nResponse: Son,", "answer": "B: closed"}

How much money should he offer if he wants to buy the fourth house but still pay at least as much as what he paid for house number 1?\n\n### Input and solution:\n\n### Instuction:Answer the Question\n\n### Solution:\n\n- Find the first $1 as shown in the image below\n- Remove it from the original problem as it is already the first number\n- Place the new $1 next to it\n- Follow the same pattern to add up numbers\n\n\n### Solution\n\nThe process that we went through was a very straightforward process, although tedious from time to time. We were able to count 4,8,12,16,20 because we were always adding an equal value to the previous number (1). The difficulty was the first one. For the first house,we were required to pick one digit only, and since we had to start our process with another digit, we were only left with one digit to pick. This meant we had to start from the last house i.e for the last house there was an 8, we knew that we start with the last number because there is no option left other than an 8. We had to start off with 8 and this was where the difficulty started. For the first, 2nd and third house, the difficulty wasn't there because we had started the sequence before. With the last house, we had to consider the pattern.

{"text": "C\n\n### Input for Exercise:\nThe average speed and acceleration of a person walking is 3 meters per second and 5 meters per second squared, respectively. What is the average velocity of this person walking?\n\n### Response for Exercise:12\n\nThe correct answer is 10 meters per second. Explain your answer.\n\nI calculated the average speed to be 32 meters per second, since 3 + 5 = 8, which equals 18 times, which is what we need to find the average speed. To find the average acceleration of something, you take the acceleration squared over time. (0.5/2 =0.25 and 32 over 2 =16 and 162 = 256) So in this case, 256/18(since we have to multiply the acceleration by the amount of time) =14.4375. Because velocity involves distance and time, I decided to take the acceleration and find a distance traveled by it and divide that by the time and then added it to the equation of finding the average velocity of the person walking.\n\nI have no idea why I received a wrong answer but I'm pretty sure I did solve this question correctly\n\nI've included both the solution as well as the problem so you can see the different steps needed in order to solve it.\n\n<br><hr>", "answer": "C: space center"}

How many miles will your car go before stopping for more gas?\n\n### Response To travel 135 miles you need at least 1.5 gallons of gas. If your car goes 135 miles with the $0.050/mile discount, your car does not stop for gas. You still need to pay the $0.090/mile after the discount. You drive 13.5 miles before paying for your gas, if you drive at the disounted rate, and the after you drive $0.09/mile, you will drive 13 additional miles.

However, I am struggling to get a good answer to support this and I am not sure if what I am thinking is correct.  I am using what is commonly used as a human powered water transport is canoeing and kayaking and how the canoe and kayaks are maneuvered by the paddler.

Instead, it was an entire list of types of water transportation.  Also, I learned that a good fit curve is a line that best connects a given set of points.  The good fit curve was to allow for each point in the data set to have their own individual line that was then connected to form one line out of all the points.\n\n### Next, I am hoping to learn more about k-nearest Neighbors and how to use them in data analytics.\n\n### I expect there are many ways to represent k-nearest neighbors data.

{"text": "answer E: attract  ducks\n\n#### Ducks  are commonly found foraging for food in ponds and lawns. Although they're often called waterfowl, it's not where they spend the bulk of their time. Ducks are also attracted to the water for protection and to keep cool. Ducks, a species of birds, are very common in our areas. \nBaby ducks, colloquially called ducklings, emerge from eggs that have been laid in tree cavities. These eggs are then covered in a layer of down and placed in a nest. The babies are born with a layer of down all over their bodies and, once they hatch, they are covered in a fluffy layer of down that acts as both a cushion and a waterproofing barrier. Once the ducklings hatch from the eggs, they will be covered up the downy layer of feathers.\nWhen ducks start breeding, they are generally around the age of one year when they begin laying eggs. This can be either in the spring or fall, but when they do begin to lay eggs, they do not stop laying them until their eggs are laid. Ducks lay their eggs in tree cavities, but some will nest on the ground as well. Ducklings usually nest on the water, but some ducks will nest on the ground. Baby ducks are very cute and make great pets. They are also very fun and entertaining to watch and handle.\n\n### Input :I heard a screeching sound every time he entered the house, he said I'm not moving from here until they leave me alone.

If I put a chair in the beach, there is a lot of sand to move and it would also be hard to move because it would be wet and there are sea creatures all around like jellyfish, octopi, coral, sea cucumbers, turtles, and many fish.  When it rains the seats will get wet and rust so I will put them in the closet after all.\n### Instruction :\nThe paw of a cat is like a hand in many ways. It has five toes (digits) on its forepaw, and four toes (also referred to as \"claws\") on its hind paw. The paw has three joints, and contains both bones for protection (knuckles) and ones that point in other directions (phalanges) to provide articulation and flexibility. The paw itself can be compared to a palm of a hand, with the dewclaw analogous to the thumb and the metacarpal bones analogous to the fingers. The dewclaw can be either a single claw in small breeds or a double claw in large breeds\n\n### Response : \nThe structure of the paw of a cat depends on the type of the cat.  Most small cats have a single dewclaw, which means they have only one extra claw on their rear paw. The larger cats will have double dewclaws. The paw of a cat itself is a combination of several bones.  A cat\u2019s paw has three jointed, so its ability to move is much greater. There are five fingers on the cat\u2019s forepaw and four fingers on their hind paw. Those joints allow the claws to extend out of the paw for hunting purposes.

Of the 17 people, it's known that at least 17 of those people do not listen to that radio station.

The most likely way to understand the term is to keep the dictionary definitions straight when writing the question. \"good\" = 1 meaning and \"successful\" = 1 meaning, but \"well\" = 2 meanings (successful & admirable).

If the writer was going to indicate \"when\" (if-then) at the end, the phrase \"when your car breaks down\" would be a better choice.

{"text": "A\n\n### Instructions:Ross was a very wealthy man who made over the top deals. One of those deals consisted of trading two donkeys to an Alaskan village for four boxes of peanut butter. Some villagers were outraged, and demanded their donkeys back. Some refused to believe the donkeys went missing, instead thinking they were stolen. They believed this because of a famous tale of the donkey that was stolen; a tale passed down from one generation to the next. The tale told of when the Alaskan village encountered a donkey thief, and how they used cleverness to keep their donkeys.  How would the tale go?\n\nThe tale told of when the donkey thief encountered the donkeys and stole them without harming them. As the thief was about to run away, the donkeys told him they knew a secret trick to get rid of him. The donkeys told the thief to lay a small piece of wood on the ground in the middle between 2 big piles of wood. Next, the donkeys told the thieves to pick up these piles of wood and start a fire in front of the small, single piece of wood. So the thief did as he was told and the donkeys started to run. The thief, wanting to chase after the donkeys, had to leave the fire without putting it out. Since the thief was careless, the fire spread from one pile of wood to the next and the whole pile of wood burned down. The thief ran and was never seen again, and the donkeys were finally safe.\n\n### Input:(JOKE OR REAL)\n\n### Answer:\n### Input:Which of the following is NOT an acceptable argument?\n\n### Answer:(TRUE/FALSE)\nWhich of the following are not acceptable arguments?\n\n### Input:-The city council must not have voted for the new law.\n-The city may not have approved the budget.\n-The city should implement a new law.\n-We should change the city logo.\n\n### Answer:-The city council must approve of the tax increase.\n-The city must not have raised the property taxes.\n-The city's taxes must be increased by a minimum of 4%-percent.\n-The city government is required", "answer": "C: injury"}

{"text": "***A) hospital***\n\n### Explanation:\nIf someone is sick, they would want to lay comfortably in bed or on the couch or the sofa. For many sick people it would be too stressful in hospital conditions that requires more movements and standing. So it would be more convenient if there's a comfortable chair for them.\n\n### Other Explanations\n\n* ***A) Hospital***: One main purpose in hospitals is to tend to people who are sick. So in many places in the hospital, there would be sofas and bed to lay on and even arm chairs. This would help patients to feel more relaxed because they do not have to stand too much while at the hospitals for treatment, exams, and other purposes.\n\n* ***B) Hospital***: It is possible for there to be arm chairs that are only used by a couple of people, though not common or in a large number in hospitals. This is because hospitals tend to focus on getting things done, since they are mostly about health care and not too much for the comfy feeling of the patients.\n\n* ***E) Furniture Store***: One way for you to find comfortable arm chairs that are not used by a few people is to look at furniture stores. There you could find several types of chairs, from cheap to expensive, that people can buy to be used in their houses.\n\n* ***D) Study***: In a study, it is more likely that researchers use the arm chair to study and concentrate on the study while they are sitting down and concentrating.

{"text": "Answer:\n\n### Instructions:\nFor each row, there is a string to be examined. The string contains two distinct elements, which we will call the first and the second. The first element is either a letter, or one of the characters that denotes the end of the string. Each element can be used zero or more times. The last element of the string can repeat any number of times.\n\nIn some of the problems you will be told that the string is of a certain length. This length is only given for our convenience as it is helpful for determining the string when it is not obvious. For example, you might be asked to determine if two strings are equivalent. A string is equivalent if its first element can be replaced by the second element. Its second element can be replaced by its first element to produce the second string. A string of length n can always be equivalently represented by another with length n \u2013 1 as any character at the end of one can be swapped onto the end of the other when its last element.\n\nWrite a JavaScript program that determines if the second element of a string can be replaced by the first, and vice versa. For example, \u201chelloworld\u201d can be considered equivalent to \u201cworldhelloworld\u201d.\n\n### Demonnstration:1.\nInput: Given the string \u201chellowor1d\u201d, the first element (\u201chell\u201d) cannot be replaced by the second (\u201co\u201d). The first element (\u201chellowor1d\u201d) can be replaced by the third (\u201cw\u201d), but the third (\u201cworry\u201d) cannot be replaced into the first element (\u201che\u201d). The string (\u201chellowor\u201d) can be replaced, but also the resulting string (\u201che\u201d). Then the last element \u201cd\u201d is replaced by the first element \u201ch\u201d and vice versa. The last element \u201cd\u201d cannot be replaced into the resulting string (\u201ch\u201d) and the resulting string cannot be replaced into the last element.\n\n```javascript \nif(first[1] === second[1])\n{\n  count(first) += 1\n  if(first[0] === next)\n  {\n    count(second) += 1\n    return true;\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    return false;\n  }\n}\nelse\n{\n  if(first.", "answer": "A: sum"}

When an event is broken down into smaller types of categories, we can call this the division.\n\n### Input :Elaina asked the teacher to create a classroom schedule that involved less planning on her part. The teacher's plan included a study hall every day and a \"specials\" class once a week where all students had a scheduled 30-minute rotation of art, music, drama, and computer. In the case she had to go to a parent-teacher conference, there was a sub to cover her class in a substitute teacher room rather than moving the students to a new classroom.  Elaina thought this was a good plan, but not very democratic. Who was right?\n\n### Response :\n\nThe correct answer is B. There is a chance for the plan to fail. If not planned appropriately this may lead to problems. If the school has no rules for teacher's duties and a schedule then this may result in a conflict. This would lead to people having difficulty completing their work. Also, it is not a safe plan for classroom schedules.\n\n### Question:\nWrite a response that appropriately continues the story below.\n\n### I have been working long and hard, and now I want to put some of my writing aside and go outside for a little while.

Do not edit the sentence itself.\n\n### Example:\n\n\"When you feel like someone knows what you're thinking, it's a wonderful feeling, but don't be surprised if that person is your pet! If you're dog, cat or another pet, you'll know more about your person than you might imagine. Your pet can observe the world for you, and know things about your feelings that you know only implicitly.\n\nDogs, for example, are known to be good at reading body language, and they are often skilled at recognizing and interpreting subtle changes in body position of their owners when they're upset or happy. They also can distinguish their owners' emotions from the emotions of other individuals. In one particularly well-known experiment, dogs were able to distinguish the emotional states of both people and dogs, and were even able to recognize photographs of different people, compared to pictures of other animals.\n\nCats, in contrast, were found to be excellent at discriminating visual stimuli, and were even able, after only minimal exposure, to pick out the face of a familiar individual from among a group of other cats.\n\nOne of the most famous experiments to be conducted between humans and their pets is the famous \"telepathy experiment,\" which was conducted with the help of Dr. Roger H. Hargreaves, a psychologist at the University of Illinois.\n\nIn all of the experiments, an assistant took a person's name, and then the person, looking toward a window, named the first person, animal, or object that they saw.\"\n\n### Response\n\nThis sentence has the correct punctuation, but the subject of the sentence is the incorrect part of speech when placed directly in the middle.

Select one of the appropriate evaluation strategies listed for each question, and then answer the question.\n- Why is the United States trying to put a man on Mars?\n- Why does the United States have such a huge military?\n- Do animals have the same rights as humans?\n\nThe question is why does the United States try to put a man on mars by 2030. I think Mars is a good idea. I also think that the United States should put a satellite into space every day. If we do that, we would have more information about the space and the earth. We could then better understand what is going on with the earth. The United States needs to stop thinking about putting a man on mars and focus on putting a satellite into space. The United States needs a few things. They first need to get better at building things that can be used for space exploration. Second, they need more money for this project. It does cost a lot of money to put humans into space. Third, they need better training so when they do get people into space; they are able to make sense of it. This is how push and pull techniques could work. The push technique could be used to see what the United States\u2019 next step will be. The United States could use this technique because it helps them see what their next step should be. They need to know what they are going to be doing next.

That group drew a name from the other table. Of the chosen group, 10 students were in the same group as the other group, and 1 student was in the opposite group. If there was a 5% chance that the group picked the name of a student who was in the same group as them, what was the chance that the group picked their own group's name?\n\n### I have no idea how I got this right! I only used the rule of multiplication:\nthe probability that no match is equal to the probability that there is a match multiplied by the number of times it is chosen. P(no match) =.95 x.05.  Then I added up all these amounts into a large amount of random numbers for a 22 person group.

They plan to take samples of 10 cars each of which are at least 3 years old and observe the repair visits their cars have over a one year period. They expect that the older the car, the more repair visits it will see each year. The following table presents observed repair visits for a number of randomly selected cars.\n\nCars Older than 3 years     3- 5 years        5-7 years        older than 7 years\nA        2                19                0             28\nB         14             6                0              5\nC         12            5                0             21\nD          5  -         10                0             15\nE          6         11              7             28\nF         18         10              8             16\nG        11              8             15           52\n\nThe manufacturer plans to apply a two-stage sampling method to the data.  First, she will use a stratified random sample of 2 cars from each of the 1-5 year old age categories to construct a four-category stratified sampling frame. The age categories will then be compared by a stratified sampling test and she will determine if the mean number of visits for 3-5 year old cars (the two-category stratified sample) differs from that for 6-7 years old cars and those older than 7 years old. This procedure leads to a question of the type,\n\nAre the estimated repair visits for the 1-5 years old age category, 8.3 (from using the two-category stratified sampling sample of 10 cars) significantly different from the mean of 2.7 found by sampling every car in this age category (i.e. 40)?\n\nAnswer the following question, including explanations for why your choice is correct.\n\nInput:Which value of x makes the", "answer": "A: early morning"}

Since she rented the car for 11 consecutive days, the cost is 190 * 11 = 2090 dollars.\n\nOutput: 300\n\nInput, Output, and Explanation: This question asks you to calculate the number of hours spent going to town.  Since Melissa goes to town twice a month, and 12 goes to town each time she goes, we need to divide 12 by 24 to calculate the number of whole hours.  Since she drives to town at 30 miles per hour and back to town at 50 miles per hour, the total driving time to and from town will be 60 miles divided by the time to complete a trip each way.   We know that 60 miles is 3 hours, per one time trip, so we need three times the number of miles covered twice.  Using 3 * 50, the total is 150.  Since she goes to town twice per month, 150 is divided by 2 to calculate the total driving time spent per year.  This is 75 hours per year, or 72 hours if we drop the extra 5 since we know 3 days in 12, or 12 divided by 3 doesn't result in an integer.\n\nOutput: C\n\nInput: This question asks you determine how much the boys will receive.

The most simple solution I would assume would be a nested for loop that runs 7 days then prints the total cost after each loop. This would give the answer, but is the most inefficient way to do it.\n\nTo actually do solve it right would require some functions. We would need to a function to take the total cost and return the sum of a 1-day charge and a 7-day charge. We could use the same function for either the sum of charges, or in this case, to subtract the charges.\n\nTo go even beyond that we need to implement the logic for the for loop to check both days of the week, then check the days for rental. Finally, the nested for loop will just require using the function to add the days together and subtracting the cost.\n\nThis type of program is how we should really solve programming problems. You have to do all the work of figuring out the solution in your head before just running the program.\n\nIf a function is not needed here, an array would be great solution to this problem.\n\n**Problem Two:**\n\nInput: Find the sum of 2 days.\nOutput: 36\n\n\n#### Programing:\n**Problem Solution**\n\nAs above, there is many different ways to solve this problem. We will need a function that can take 2 days from a number and return the sum. We would also need, I like to call it the difference function and can take a total sum and subtract however many days we need.\n\n\n**Coding:**\n\n{% highlight c%}\n#define day 1 4\n\n#define week 4\n\ncout << \"Please enter the number of the day: \" << endl;\ncin >> day;\n\nvoid print_day(int day, int week);\n    {\n     if (day == 1)\n      {\n         print_day(1, week);\n       }\n     else if (day == 2)\n     {\n     print_day(2, week);\n     }", "answer": "E: mississippi"}

We have done several puzzles at this point so we should be able to find ways to speed up our time and answers.  There is a section called Cognitive Bias in the book that suggests that we have certain thought patterns:\n- Hindsight Bias\n- Stereotypes\n- Gamblers\n\n\nTo help with this we are going to try and keep in mind when reviewing questions how our answers align to the following patterns:\n- How fast we answered\n- How confident we were in the answer\n- Which patterns we tend to follow\n\nThe answers that will yield the fastest answers are going to be where it seems that the brain has an obvious preference or answer.  For example in question 4 the answer seems to be in the 40's and 50 range and in question 8 the answer is almost definitively 5.  These obvious patterns or patterns that seem faster will help us make our answers faster.\n\n\n\n### Solution:We will start to review our solutions and start to look at the different solutions we found.\n\n1.\n``` java\nimport java.util.*;\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {         \n        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n        double miles = sc.nextDouble();\n        double money = sc.nextDouble() * (1 + miles/100) ;\n        System.out.println(money);\n    }\n}\n```\nWe start by splitting the miles in and then adding them on using a formula.  This works for this problem and is good, but can be a little bit tricky for us to use this approach for a larger problem.\n\n2.\n``` java\nclass Driver {\n    public Driver() {}\n\n    public Driver(boolean drives, boolean smokes) {\n        this.drives = drives;\n        this.smokes = smokes;\n    }\n    private boolean drives;\n    private boolean smokes;\n\n    public void goTo() {", "answer": "A: wear shoes"}

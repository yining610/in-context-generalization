It is about having the capacity to make intelligent decisions at any given point in time. A good degree, a diploma, or a master-degree does not guarantee your job security. This is why you should focus on gaining more skills and on having the competencies that employers are looking for.<n><n>### Solution<n><n>The degree program was really good; although a great deal of what was taught was never used in my professional life. The best education is when you learn by doing, learning by doing things that you like, something you want to do or something you want to be.<n>I started with a great job out of college. But I was ready and had the capability to do more. The job I got right after finishing my bachelor degree was a great starting point, and I had to learn everything I could to find new opportunities. I worked hard and was able to advance my career in a short period of time. I then decided to do an MBA, not because of a job but to learn something new, because I was looking for new challenges and I wanted to do different things. I did not see my degree as a job guarantee, but instead a stepping stone to a new career. I thought I could do more and be more. I wanted to start my own business instead of working for others. But I have seen people graduate with a bachelor degree and a masters degree and work for their company for the rest of their career. And that is also great.<n><n>### Question:How do you like taking classes at the moment? Does it remind you of being in Highschool? Why?

Choices:  A: pleasure B: accident C: get somewhere D: hurt E: falling down<n><n>### Response:		Answer: accident<n><n>### Feedback: Choice A is incorrect because one can still find pleasure in riding a bike through difficult terrain. Choice B is incorrect because it is impossible to have accidents if one is not actually riding a bike. Choice C is incorrect because it would not be possible to ‘get somewhere’ or ‘hurt’ oneself when biking through rough terrain, as it is impossible to achieve such actions, and Choice D is incorrect as it is unreasonable to ‘hurt’ yourself or ‘fall down’ when biking through difficult terrain. Hence, the answer is ‘accident’ since it answers the question in the most correct manner.<n><n>### Input The population of Texas is estimated at 22 million. The population of Utah is estimated at 2.9 million. The population of California is estimated at 36 million. What is the total population of all three of these states?<n><n>### Response Answer: 16.8 million<n><n>### Feeback The population of Utah, Texas, and California is the total number of people in those states. To calculate that, multiply 22 by 2.9, then multiply it by 36 to get a total number of 82.7 million. However, 82.7 is much higher than 16.8(the population of all three states combined).

This species is indigenous to Eastern North America, but it is found all over the USA and into Latin America. The box turtle is unique among the world's roughly 300 turtle species in that its shell protects them from danger with a hinged lid. It's like a car that you can close to protect you. It's interesting that the only part of the box turtle shell that grows is the lid. Some other species of turtles actually grow their shells bigger and bigger as they age! The box turtle spends most of its life buried in the ground. Its camouflage allows it to hide from threats such as hawks and snakes who see them, but don't immediately think they are food. This protective strategy works well except when a box turtle is exposed to danger. Turtles have amazing eyesight, and a box turtle's eyes allow it to spot a potential predator from a great distance. Predators must then make a speedy approach. At night box turtles will also retreat to the ground to stay safe.<n><n>**Instruction:Which type of turtle is described in this passage?**<n><n>A boxed caravan<n><n>A boxed dirt mover<n><n>B: the eastern box turtle<n><n>D: the western box turtle<n>

The system that is asking for this data doesn't know what is beyond those answers, in which we as humans have knowledge about the world.<n><n>For this task, my approach was to eliminate the possible incorrect answers, then pick the most likely one.  This is why "D" was incorrect because an open throat and an abdominal muscles would have a significant impact on a person's physical appearance.<n><n>![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7WZUQhGtOwCjrq08/giphy.gif)<n><n>If the other choices are incorrect, the remaining choices are probably the highest and lowest.<n><n>![](http://www.dailygood.org/media/kubrick_shallow.jpg)<n><n><n>

Choices:  A: waterfalls B: underwater C: beach D: surface of earth E: river<n><n>### Response:		The underwater part of the ocean is covered with water.<n><n>### Input<n><n>Input: What’s half of half way?<n><n>### Demostration: HALF is half of the way. If you take the HALF of the way, then you will get halfway back from where you need to go. So the ANSWER is HALF of HALF way or even half way.<n><n>### Response<n>When there is a half in front of whatever, that means that you must take the half of the thing and make that your answer. It's a little weird, and sometimes there's a lot with half in front, but that doesn't really have much to do with it, you can just do it. Like, a half dozen of something is six. A half of a dozen is still six. So you take half and you get half, half way.<n><n>Example: <n>It's not 311/2 but it's half of 1/2.<n>To get your half you just have to use the word half. This can be tricky for kids even if they know that there's part of something, just do it. It's pretty simple and not really hard. This means that if you're half way, you have to go half way back and if it's a half of a day, you take half of the day and end up having the exact same day you started with.<n><n>Eg: There are half a dozen people in this room.

Choices:  A: books B: france C: fish market D: atlantic ocean E: cuba<n><n>### Response:		<n>```<n>In order to find this out I first needed to identify Sam’s location. In our example, Sam has told us in the first line of the paragraph that he went to Paris. The location information tells us that Paris is in Europe, which in turn is located in Europe somewhere off the coast of Spain.<n>```<n>```<n>The second line of the paragraph tells us that Sam was in Paris in a sushi place where he ordered a blow fish. After searching for this information, we find out that the sushi place is located beside the Seine River in Paris.<n>```<n>```{<n>  "location" :"sushi place",<n>  "nearby landmarks" : "Seine River in Paris",<n>  "nearest major city" : "Berlin"<n>}<n>```<n><n>```<n>The landmarks in the sushi place let us know that it is located on the east riverbank of the Seine River in Paris with the West Bank of the river on the other side of the city. We know this because the river divides the city into two parts.<n>```<n>```In the final landmarks we learned that Paris is the capital city of France and a major city in Europe. The city is known as “The City of Lights.” It’s also nicknamed the “Most Romantic City in the World.” Paris is the largest French city and also is located in France. The city was built on the Seine River in 52 BC. In 1871, Paris was besieged by the Prussians while a workers’ uprising occurred. The siege lasted for four months and the uprising lasted several days. In 1914, World War I began when Germany broke the neutrality treaty by launching an unprovoked attack against France. In 1851, the City of Paris was founded by Henry IV. The current President of France is Emmanuel Macron.<n>```<n>### Your Response<n>```<n>The first line tells us that he went to Paris where he probably was at the Eiffel Tower and the Seine River. Paris is located beside the Seine. The sushi place is where we would buy the blowfish for a delicious meal.<n>```<n>```The first line of the description is Paris,France. The second line says that he was at the sushi place in the river beside the Seine.

As I grew older, I became more fascinated with the books on my parents’ shelves and started reading more and more. After I graduated high school, I decided that I wanted to write my own book. The Book on the Book is based on my fascination with books and my passion for writing. I know everyone will love it, and I hope you’ll agree with me when I say that everyone should buy it!<n><n>### Addition 4: Write the reason for writing this email.<n><n>I am writing this e-mail to you because I want to write a story, based on the life of a book. I want to tell people how important your book is to me and why I love books. I also want to share the story with everyone. I hope you will read my book and I hope you will like it!<n><n>## STEP D:<n>Write an e-mail to someone on your campus that explains that you are leaving your team. Write at least 100 words.

You will want to rent a car for 12 days. How much, on average, will you pay for the rental per day?<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>The best way to solve a problem like this is to draw a chart, like on the next page:<n><n>|  Rental Rates       | Number of Days  | Total Rental   | Average Total Rental  |<n>| :---:              | :---: |:---: |:---::---:|<n>|    $32/day               |  12 |$384 | $384 / 12 |<n>|    $35/day               |  6 |$210 | $350 / 12 |  <n><n>So, to find the average cost per day, divide the total by the number of days: $384 /12  = $32.<n><n>### Input - How do I know if an answer is correct?<n><n>When an answer is given, there might be no explanation as to why their answer is correct and why yours is incorrect.

If the speech recognition software in the system fails to translate the speech into text (the text should be what the machine wrote), then the program will end. However, since we want to make this a fair test, we don’t want the human to have any knowledge of the content of the speech.  We want the human to be in a situation where they cannot distinguish whether the speech was written by a human or a machine.  For this reason, we have developed a test system that puts the human and the computer in complete isolation until they are asked to speak at the end of the challenge.<n><n>#### You will be given a speech that a voice will recite.

Read and follow the instruction.<n><n>### Note:<n>This response is a response to one of the questions.<n><n>### Input:-1 The air conditioner in a refrigerator must be capable of producing 15,000 joules (15 Watts) in 5 hours. Assuming the air conditioner is operating at 90% efficiency, what must be the power of the air conditioner (in Watts)?<n><n>### Output:-1 1875<n><n>### Task:<n>A car travels 150 miles at a constant speed of 55 mph, consuming 11.5 gallons of gasoline. What is the cost of fuel for the trip?<n><n>### Notes:-1 Your response should be a single digit integer with units. A correct answer could be $0.04.<n><n>### Solution:-1 The correct answer was 1875 Watts. We assumed that the efficiency of the air conditioner was 90% and that the power was 15000 Joules in 5 hours. To make 1500 Watts we need to multiply the time (5h) by 1500 (the power consumed) and divide the power by efficiency 0.9 (0.9 times 1500) to find the required power.The value is 1500 / 0.9 = 1666.6 or 1667 Watts.<n><n>Then, because 1667 times 1 W = 1667 Jolts and 1 joule is 2.2 Watts we need 770 watts. The power and time is multiplied to 770W * 5h = 3850 Jolts. Because 1 joule equals 3850 watts we get the answer: 1875W<n><n>For the cost we started with the price 11.5 gal * $3.55 = $41.58, because for a 150 miles travel 1 gallon is equal to the 1500/3

Choices:  A: idaho B: shopping mall C: big city D: in town E: new york<n><n>### Response:		Option D<n><n>### Explanation:Department store managers know that customers always want to find the nearest store so they can save time on travel and avoid inconvenience.  Most of the time, customers will just go to the closest mall even if there is a big city. But, sometimes they don't. For example, customers could come from over 100 miles to look for deals. This is the highest option of all the locations.<n><n>### Choices:<n>idaho : number of potential customers is low<n>shopping mall : number of customers is medium<n>big city : number of customers is very high<n>in town: number of customers is not as high (most of the time)<n>new york: number of customers is very very high<n><n>### Input:[50,150]<n><n>### Response:[250,350]<n><n>This shows that I know addition and subtraction<n><n>### Choice: A<n>### Choice:-1<n><n>### Input:@"I had 33 dollars saved up.

I ended up with 15 left."<n><n>### Inclusionary:I had 33/2 dogs left and for 1 dog I can still make 23, and if for 1 dog I make 23/2 then I would have 15 remaining.  So, if I sold 23 I had 33 left.<n><n>### Exercise 5:You can earn $5.00 for being in the best soccer team.  You can also earn $1.00 for being the best goalkeeper.

Well, exercise is not the only answer. When it comes to physical activity, sleep can have an incredible impact on your health in a number of ways. It turns out that sleep is vital for losing weight and developing a healthy physique. You lose 30% of muscle mass and the number of fat cells rises if more than 6-7 hours of deep sleep are lost. A study published in the Journal of Applied Physiology found that sleep helps improve insulin production and reduce fatigue, both of which are critical for losing weight and making healthy fitness choices. A shortage of sleep can reduce physical performance by 2% to 3%. Studies in young people indicate that sleep deprivation can make you more irritable, and lower your motivation to exercise or adopt other healthy habits. Here are 8 ways sleep can have a positive impact on your health.<n><n>### Response<n><n><img src="..\..\Pictures\Images.jpg" width="300px" height="300px"><n>

Choices:  A: pocket B: shower C: chemist D: drug store E: shaving kit<n><n>### Response:		I do not think that there is one best answer to this question, as the purpose of the answer seems to be only to create a discussion with the TA. However, I feel that if I were to be asked such a question, I would answer, “A: pocket”. At least, that’s what I would choose. I might guess that the person asking the question is not from the 1950s and so may feel somewhat out of place in that era. In that case I would say either “E: shaving kit”, or “B: shower” because “shaving” itself is something outdated.<n><n>### Input You have a number N that represents the cost of a car.

The rate is $50 per day and 14 days (the second number above the line) cost $500. The third number below the line tells us that 20 days cost $800.<n>So the total amount is 5 days free, $200 for the first 5 days, then $600 for the next 14 days for $800.  The total amount is $1300.<n>Because it was $800 to rent the place for ten days, he was charged $800 for 20 days<n><n>Now, the next question we need to know is

The first function is the ‘main function’ and the second is the function called ‘functionOne’.  The main function is required before the program can be executed.  This is because it contains the instructions that cause the program to proceed in its operation.  In addition to that the program needs to have a second function: functionOne. This function should be passed to the main function. The main function will call this function each time it executes a loop.  The main function first asks the user to enter a value, then it calls the function that is passed.  The main function will pass this function to itself in an argument list.  This function should compare each item in an array to the entry parameter and count the ones that are equal to or larger than that parameter.<n>### Demonstraition:<n>Input:Input to the program:<n>main<n>52<n><n>-Write it in a loop while i<=52<n>-i=i+1<n>-if the entry is smaller than i then print (i-1) " is larger than your item"<n>  if-loop<n>  <n>Output:The output should be 1<n><n>### Input<n>Input to the program:main<n>29<n>10<n>-Write it in the loop while i<=50<n>-i=i-1<n>Output:The output needs to be a list of all the elements in the array.<n>### Description:After the two functions aforementioned have been implemented, the user should be able to enter a number larger than any of the ones in the array and the values of the array that are equal to or smaller than it.

One kid played all day and didn’t eat any candy and slept all night. I went fishing all day. When we came home we didn’t have any water so we went to another beach to get some water. Then I brought home some sand that the kids could play in. The dog liked the sand also and I had to leave it outside to keep the dog from running in the house. I have 160 lbs of clams.

Scientists are not sure how. How do they survive? Do some research on how they survive and then post a picture that best represents their survival.<n><n>### My Pet goldfish can detect the presence of landmines by smell, and it does this because they sense explosives particles in the surrounding soil. They sense explosives by the odor that is associated with explosives.<n><n>### These sea snakes have adapted to exist in an environment with little accessible oxygen. Because of this, they have developed an extended gill rakers and larger lungs that allow them to get more oxygen. They also produce an enzyme in liver that breaks down sulfur in the blood, and stores it in the muscles. When needed, the body breaks it down and uses it as oxygen to keep itself alive.<n><n>### [How Do Sea Snakes Breathe underwater](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3422378/)

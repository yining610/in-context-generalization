The reminder method can be used to sum an array and the sum method can be used to make calculations easier.<n><n>The hurricane question is an example of making one big loop, setting a variable, incrementing a counter, and then adding to that variable all while looping back.<n><n>This question is a prime example of the string concatenation method available in python. There is this '+' operator that combines strings.<n><n><n>### Notes/Feedback<n><n>Python 2 is a bit different. I haven't programmed in it in over a year. I've used it once a day throughout life, but no programming. I think the big difference would be the difference of the'string' variable type.

I think that this question is to find out the total time to transport all the cattle.<n><n>By the way we want to figure this out for it is a question from programming.<n><n><n>So we can use formula as well as <n>```python<n>def find_all_floats():<n>    float_str = '3.51'<n>    float_str_copy = float_str<n>    arr_copy_with_0_if_not_float = [str(x) for x in float_str_copy.split(',')]<n>```<n>and now we need to define a float like this:<n>```python<n>def is_float(x):<n>    if x == "0":<n>        return False<n>    else:<n>        return True<n>```<n>and then we can get all the floats like this:<n>```<n>>>> find_all_fints()<n>['3.51']<n>```<n>or even more simply:<n>```<n>>>>", float(str(1.2))<n>```<n>and now if you like you can multiply floats as easy as this, even if you have very big numbers.<n>```<n>>>>, 3456**789*23<n>```<n><n>So it is easier to find the cost of taking the cattle if we multiply all the floats in the sentence.<n>Now we can multiply floats like this: <n>```<n>>>> 34563456*23456<n>```<n>and when I multiply 3456,6 and multiply 34

They plan to take samples of 10 cars each of which are at least 3 years old and observe the repair visits their cars have over a one year period. They expect that the older the car, the more repair visits it will see each year. The following table presents observed repair visits for a number of randomly selected cars.<n><n>Cars Older than 3 years     3- 5 years        5-7 years        older than 7 years<n>A        2                19                0             28<n>B         14             6                0              5<n>C         12            5                0             21<n>D          5  -         10                0             15<n>E          6         11              7             28<n>F         18         10              8             16<n>G        11              8             15           52<n><n>The manufacturer plans to apply a two-stage sampling method to the data.  First, she will use a stratified random sample of 2 cars from each of the 1-5 year old age categories to construct a four-category stratified sampling frame. The age categories will then be compared by a stratified sampling test and she will determine if the mean number of visits for 3-5 year old cars (the two-category stratified sample) differs from that for 6-7 years old cars and those older than 7 years old. This procedure leads to a question of the type,<n><n>Are the estimated repair visits for the 1-5 years old age category, 8.3 (from using the two-category stratified sampling sample of 10 cars) significantly different from the mean of 2.7 found by sampling every car in this age category (i.e. 40)?<n><n>Answer the following question, including explanations for why your choice is correct.<n><n>Input:Which value of x makes the

How many orders can Lori fill per hour?<n>Answer and input: 10<n><n>### Explanation<n><n>### Solution<n><n>#### Part One<n><n>Input: The cost of a rental for a week, or more, is 190 dollars.  Since she rented the car for 11 consecutive days, the cost is 190 * 11 = 2090 dollars.<n><n>Output: 300<n><n>Input, Output, and Explanation: This question asks you to calculate the number of hours spent going to town.  Since Melissa goes to town twice a month, and 12 goes to town each time she goes, we need to divide 12 by 24 to calculate the number of whole hours.  Since she drives to town at 30 miles per hour and back to town at 50 miles per hour, the total driving time to and from town will be 60 miles divided by the time to complete a trip each way.   We know that 60 miles is 3 hours, per one time trip, so we need three times the number of miles covered twice.  Using 3 * 50, the total is 150.  Since she goes to town twice per month, 150 is divided by 2 to calculate the total driving time spent per year.  This is 75 hours per year, or 72 hours if we drop the extra 5 since we know 3 days in 12, or 12 divided by 3 doesn't result in an integer.<n><n>Output: C<n><n>Input: This question asks you determine how much the boys will receive.  The money they receive is 80 * 500, which is 40,00

The most simple solution I would assume would be a nested for loop that runs 7 days then prints the total cost after each loop. This would give the answer, but is the most inefficient way to do it.<n><n>To actually do solve it right would require some functions. We would need to a function to take the total cost and return the sum of a 1-day charge and a 7-day charge. We could use the same function for either the sum of charges, or in this case, to subtract the charges.<n><n>To go even beyond that we need to implement the logic for the for loop to check both days of the week, then check the days for rental. Finally, the nested for loop will just require using the function to add the days together and subtracting the cost.<n><n>This type of program is how we should really solve programming problems. You have to do all the work of figuring out the solution in your head before just running the program.<n><n>If a function is not needed here, an array would be great solution to this problem.<n><n>**Problem Two:**<n><n>Input: Find the sum of 2 days.<n>Output: 36<n><n><n>#### Programing:<n>**Problem Solution**<n><n>As above, there is many different ways to solve this problem.

The array holds the collection of data (objects) called variables. We will make sure to use arrays in every problem that we encounter in our programming journey.<n><n>### Instructions:A:<n><n>Enter the number of characters for each string, and one letter from the alphabet, using each character as many times as you like (so if you entered 46, your strings would be 45 characters long). Then enter some strings, separating the first string from all the others with a number. Each string will be printed just before the string that follows it and will start with its letter from the input array. You can enter up to 200 strings (unless otherwise stated). This function should return nothing. Example output for this function:<n><n>Input: 10,A<n><n>1 A 2 A 3 A 4 A 5 A 6 A 7 A 8 A 9 A<n><n>Input: 4, A, B<n><n>1 A 1.2 B 2 A 2.4 B<n><n># Program to print strings<n><n>### Instuctions:<n>In your Programming class last semester you learned the “for” loop, which is useful for iteration (that is, how much you want to run a loop of code). Here’s a good use of the “for” loop: to print some data. Since you don’t want to do something for a long time, you can use the “while” loop instead: <n><n>```<n>while (stuff is true) {<n>  do some things<n>  printf (text to print out)<n>}<n>```<n>In this function, the above code in the body of the function is what you want to print. You must print the string "hello", in whatever manner you need the printing to be done.<n><n>### Output<n>Please print this:<n>5689 2865 338<n><n>Then it will look like this:<n><n><p>Hello!</p><n><n>I can also do something different:<n><n><p><i>Hello!!</i></p><n><n>and even some colors:<n><n>Hello Blue!!<n><n>and this:<n><n>*<i>Hello!</i><n><n>Bright yellow!<n><n>*

We have done several puzzles at this point so we should be able to find ways to speed up our time and answers.  There is a section called Cognitive Bias in the book that suggests that we have certain thought patterns:<n>- Hindsight Bias<n>- Stereotypes<n>- Gamblers<n><n><n>To help with this we are going to try and keep in mind when reviewing questions how our answers align to the following patterns:<n>- How fast we answered<n>- How confident we were in the answer<n>- Which patterns we tend to follow<n><n>The answers that will yield the fastest answers are going to be where it seems that the brain has an obvious preference or answer.  For example in question 4 the answer seems to be in the 40's and 50 range and in question 8 the answer is almost definitively 5.  These obvious patterns or patterns that seem faster will help us make our answers faster.<n><n><n><n>### Solution:We will start to review our solutions and start to look at the different solutions we found.<n><n>1.<n>``` java<n>import java.util.*;<n>public class Main {<n>    public static void main(String[] args) {         <n>        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);<n><n>        double miles = sc.nextDouble();<n>        double money = sc.nextDouble() * (1 + miles/100) ;<n>        System.out.println(money);<n>    }<n>}<n>```<n>We start by splitting the miles in and then adding them on using a formula.

I used three nested for-loops, as per the instructions, to determine what values were "odd," what values were "even," and what values were strictly "odd" or "even." I also used a print statement to print the results.<n>### 3. My code for this exercise seemed to be similar to the instructions. I can't say whether I was supposed to just know whether my answer was correct before writing, or to write the code, test, and modify the code so it met the criteria of the instructions. (But I guess I had to know that it would run before I submitted it.)<n><br><br></p><p><a class="btn-github" href="https://github.com/CodingBat/CodingBatProb/tree/master/Prob120907"></a> Code in this problem <a href="http://jdoodle.com/embed/c957171c-9ed2-4b3b-a2ca

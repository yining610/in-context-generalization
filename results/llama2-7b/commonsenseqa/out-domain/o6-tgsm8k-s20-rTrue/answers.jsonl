Therefore, the final answer is \"A\"\n\nInput: How about a nice game of tennis outdoors, with just-the-right amount of wind? Choices:  Wind: high-wind, mid-wind, or high-speed, and high-temperature  Game: easy, moderate, or severe.\nOutput: \"just-the-right-amount-of-wind\" can be parsed as either \"mid-wind\" or \"high-wind\". So the question is asking for:\n\n- Mid-wind, high-speed, and temperature (easy) \n- High-wind, high-temperature (severe) \n- High wind, mid-temperature (moderate)\n\nSince high-wind matches severe and moderate but not easy, the answer is 2) moderate.", "answer": "A: gain weight"}
{"text": "To send letters through the mail, you must pay postage. The process of getting this mail is the same as a train: in either case, something is being transported from one location to another. Similarly, someone who is thinking of something is also transporting it from one location (their mind) to another (their mouth), and you must pay a toll (or \"postage\") in order to get it there. If you are not paying the toll or postage, you will slow down your train, because you cannot move objects through space without having to pay for it. Therefore, communicating with someone is exactly the same as sending a letter through the post office: You must pay a postage for each piece of information that you send them. If the post office charges for both letters and payments, then you must pay a similar amount in mental energy in order to move the information across: every time you speak or write down a piece of information, you are incurring a postage.\nSo the final answers is C\n\nInput: John and James spent most of the time communicating with eachother on their project. The time required to communicate with eachother slowed the what? Choices: A: static B: collaboration. C: train of thought D: transfer of information\nOutput: Since \"communicating\" means \"talking back and forth\", it is very similar to \"interacting\"; conversations in which information is being transferred between two people (\"transfer\" of information). When two people are speaking back and forth with each other, they are not working on the same project, but they are still working, because they are still using cognitive resources to come up with ideas and speak. The time required to do this communication is slower when one partner has stopped, because now each partner is not working on the project; they are both simply talking with each other.\nBecause of this, the project is slowed down significantly when both partners stop working on their project; when they are conversing, there is no longer any effort needed to construct the next part of the project.\nSimilarly, John and James slow down their \"transfer of information\" when they are having a discussion which is not related to the project. For example, if they discuss that \"I will do the project on time because I spent years doing things ahead of time\", they have wasted a significant amount of time and need to speed up the transfer of informati", "answer": "C: progress"}

They knew that if everyone bakes and sells one more pie, they will be able to buy a new football. They made the pie with a ratio of 4:5:1, so that means if everyone made 1 piece, then they needed to each sell 4, sell 5, sell 8. Then they'll have two extra and raise money to buy the football. The ratio tells me how many each person needs to sell to get to the goal of 2. If I know how much each person need to sell to make 2, I can just subtract their piece to see how many they need to sell to raise the money for the goal of one. Substitute 2 for x, 4 for y, and 5 for z, to get the equation: (y - z) = 2 - 4, subtract 4 and get 0 = 2 - 6, solve for y. Plug in the other variables. 4 = 5 - z, solve for z. 4 = 3, z equals three. And the equation, for their goal, is 4 + 4 = 2 + 8. Since each person made 1, we have, 4 + 4 + 4 - 1 + 1 + 1 = 9 + 8 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 6 = 28 - 5 = 23. 23 is the answer that they raise in money, because they are each missing (selling) one pie.\nThe correct answer is E\n\nInput: A: A cowboy is riding across a desert using only a map of the desert and compass.

How many fish are in each pond if 34 fish enter the large pond from the smaller pond, and 29 fish leave the large pond to enter another pond?\nOutput: This requires writing multiple math expressions to find the final answer.\nFirst, note all the data is given.\nLarge pond has 7 + 34 = <<7+34=41>>41 fish\nSmaller pond has 12 + 29 = <<12+29=41>>4 = 41\nTherefore the difference equals the new total of fish left in the pond = 41-29= <<41-29=-12>> -12\nNext, we find the number of fish that enter the large pond.\nFor every fish that enters into the large pond a total of 29 also enters the other pond. So, the number of fish that came into large pond = 7 = <<7=-29>> -29\nNow we find out the number of fish that stay in large pond.\nNot every fish that enters the large pond leaves the large pond, this is just those given in the data. So the number of fish that leaves the pond = 7 + 29 = 36\nThus, total number of fish staying in Pond = 41 - 36 = 5\nThus the final answer is 7 + 24 = <<7+24=31>>31\nTherefore, the ponds have: 34 fish entering the pond and 29 fish leaving the pond, and the total fish remaining = 31\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\ninput", "answer": "B: symphony"}

The father thinks it is 10 degrees cooler here than anywhere else on the trail. He then tells his son to wait there until his body temperature reaches 100 degrees. To calculate his son's age, one could use the following formula: 2x(10+1)+1.2x = <<2x(10+)1.2x=20>>22. So the son's age is 20.\nOutput: Since 2x(13)+1.2x= 2*27.2\n= <<2*27.3=54>>54, son's age is: 2x(54)+1.2x\n= <<2*54+1.2x=110>>110.\nSo the son's age = 11 years old.\n\n### Instruction:Test how well you understand recursive code with this recursion quiz.\n\nIn this lesson, we're going to talk about recursion.

Choices: A= down the rabbit hole B= depressed C= in the woods D= lonely\nOutput: If somebody is in a dark or dark place it means that she is in a gloomy location (ie., depressed). However, these other answers could apply. If a person is down the rabbit hole he/she is in a gloomy area, but they are more likely to be in an exciting place (ie., happy) that the other choices could apply. If a depressed person is in the woods it could be an accurate description of their mood. If a person is in the dark they might be depressed, lonesome, or happy. However, using the words depressed, in the woods, or lonesome with a happy person would not be an accurate description of the person. So there only 2 possible options that could give an accurate description (lonesome and depressed).\nSince lonesome does not describe a happy person, it is likely that the person is depressed. Depression is not happy. Therefore D is the best answer.\n\nInput: Why is there music in every movie?

It has only one side, so we can't get tails. The problem is, that each new toss may change the probability and that makes the problem too difficult. We can solve the problem if we assume that the coin will land with the same side each time. We can then calculate the chance that we will get to choose to see the 3 faces of the 1/2 we know we have. The calculation is as follows:\n\nWe have a 1/2 chance the first toss will land on heads.\nIf it lands on tails, there will be a 1/2 that it will land on heads on the 2nd and 3rd toss.\nThose two situations together, means we have a 1/4 chance the coin will land on a heads each time, even if we toss the same coin multiple times.\nIf we did have a 1/1 chance of always landing on the same side, after tossing the first time we would have to toss the coin 3 more times to have it land on the same. 1/2 * 1/2 * (1/2 +", "answer": "B: own cars"}

How many students rode the bus everyday?\nOutput: Let's find the number of students who rode the bus every day, then subtract that many students from the total class size.\nIf there were 80 students and 40 of them ride the bus every day, the 40 that rode the bus every day would equal 40/80 of the entire class. We say 40/8 is 1/4 of every student that's in the class. So, 1/4 of 80 is 50 (since 50 is 1/4 * 80). The other 30 were not bus riders, so 30 represents the remainder.\n40 students (who were bus riders) = 40/8 = 5\n30 students (who were non-bus riders) = (80 - 50) = 30\n30 bus riders subtracted from the 80 students in the class equals 30 bus riders, or, 50 bus riders subtracting from the whole class size is 30.\nSo, (80 - 30) = 50\nSo the final answer 50\n\nInput: A large family of 14 people was having a pool party.

The next value is 6 zeros followed by a 1. Since we do not know what comes after it, we plug in a value equal to that of the 1 and continue to fill in the next missing value in the 4th column: 6 zeros followed by another 1 followed by 7 zeros. We continue to plug in the missing value until we have the following:\n\n11\n12 2\n13 12 122\n14 14 144 1211 1222\n15 11 15 16 17 18 19 140 1601 12111 12122 17153...\nWe see a pattern here...

How much more was it eating on the second day of vacation?\nOutput: On the first day, we can say _% of usual meal_ = usual meal, (% +13)/100.\nOn the second day, we can say (% +13)% = % of usual meal, 13% of usual meal.\nWe can solve as per usual meal = 10\nTherefore, % of usual meal on second day is (% +13)*(10)/100 = (15*10)/10 = 150/10 = 10/1.\nSo, we find its usual meal is 10 and eating more by 150/0.\nSo the final result is 150/5 = 30\n\nInput: Riley\u2019s father is three times as old as Riley\u2019s mother.

If the student doesn't know that notebooks are commonly found in bookstores, or doesn't know what a bookstore is, their best guess should be A. You want the student to choose whatever their intuition leads them to. To do that, you want to try to catch an incorrect answer by asking them to justify the choice. If they get this question correct, they also get the follow up question correct.\n\nInput: What is the first letter in the alphabet? A: apple B: bag C: bicycle D: banana E: cat\nOutput: Similar to the previous question, this task is aiming to increase the student's familiarity with the alphabet.

A: 5 B: 7 C: 10 D: None of the above E: 11\nOutput: To answer this question, a student needs familiarity with shapes. If they say \"Rectangle\" for example, that is incorrect. After that, they either don't know what a square is, in which case a teacher could ask what part of a square a box would be most like, where they can use a square ruler as an example, or they know what a square is but their intuition says 5, so they just choose that answer.

This tells us that people who are wealthy are not able to get into heaven, and can only get there through hard work.\nIn Matthew 26:1-5, it says: Now it happened, as Jesus and His disciples sat at the table in the house, that many multitudes \nof the Jews gathered together, so that they could not even eat bread.

He had to work for his food.\nLastly, in Luke 8:14-15, Jesus tells the crowd: \"And that which fell among thorns, these are the ones who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with worries and riches and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity. But the ones that fell on good ground are the ones who, having heard, produce fruit with patience.\" Jesus says that those who are \"choked with wealth\" do not produce fruit. If you only have a plant that grows on top, and not at the roots, that plant cannot last. You must dig deeper into your roots and grow it there too. If you have wealth and you are not using it to help others, then you have missed your roots and therefore you will not last.\nSo the final is 3\n\nInput: Which of the following is the smallest number? 252 B 244 C 261 D 305 12 23\nOutput: There are a lot of combinations, but we know that 252 is not the smallest, because 2", "answer": "A: work in life"}

The final sentence is the answer by applying a set of rules through the code below.\n# The basic approach, as you can see below, is pretty simple:\n# Step 1: Input sentence is converted to an equation.\n# Step 2: Various options are applied.\n#    - One simple option is to divide each statement by 2 since it is a multiple choice question. This is done below by replacing 50 / 7 = << 50/7 = 7>>7 with 50 / 2 = << 50=25>>25. This does not affect all the options, so in line 14 we check if 25 is 1 and if it is, then we go to the end.\n#    - Another simple option is to take the variable before it multiplies with 2 to obtain the number of times it appears as an answer in the options. For example, in the line below, x has 6 options, x1, x2,... x6.\n# If you see if any of the variables within the brackets are repeated as many times as the number of answer choices, you can take the brackets away.\n# Example below: x is divided by 6 below.\n# The problem here with this approach is to make sure that there are no more than one answer that may contain any x in it. So if we look at l[0], we see that it contains 7,", "answer": "C: with people"}

This is your chance to find out.\nA cube root of a number is the positive real number which, raised to the power of 1/3, is equal to the given number. For example, the cube root of 3 is 1. We can determine the cube root of the number using the following formula:\nA number whose cube root is given is x.\nTherefore, a cube root of x is:\nRaise 1 to the power of 3:\n1x = x\nTherefore, the cube root of any positive number with integer cube roots is the positive integer whose cube is the number we started with.\nFor a negative number, if x has real cube roots, we find positive and negative cube roots. We then take the positive cube root. Then we take the absolute value to get a final cube root.\nFinally, if the x is non-real, then we look at the cube roots that are closest, and take the absolute", "answer": "D: venice"}

So both Choices C and E make sense.\n\nInput: Is it true or false that you can always find the largest number that is less than 20.\nOutput: Yes, you can always find the maximum number that is less than the largest number.  We know that the 10 largest numbers are 1-10. We know that all numbers greater than 5 are greater than 6.  We know that if we start with any number at first, once we find the largest number less than that, we can simply subract the left number from it, and we will have the largest number less than the first number that we started out with and now we also have the largest number less then that number. As an example, lets start in the beginning with 2, then since 6 is the largest number that is smaller than 2, we can say that 2-6= <<2-6=4>>4 is the largest number that less than 6.  So, starting with 4 is the largest number less than 6. But we can also say that the largest number greater than 4 is 6.  So if we start with 8, 8-6= <<8-6=2>>2 is the largest number less then 8, but 9 is", "answer": "B: feel pressure"}

For option B, we label the lower left circle \u201cB\u201d and the upper right circle \u201cA\u201d.

That is why the answer of the question is 30 minutes (3/5 * 60) + 15 (5/7 * 30) = 30 (60 + 15) = 30 * 15 = 450/60 = 75 minutes / 60 = 1.25 hours\n\nInput:If $5 is one percentof 500, what is 15 percent off 500?\nOutput:15 percent of 500 equals 75, not 175, because 175/500 = 35/100, while 15% of 500 is 75\n\nInput:I have a soccer team of 8 students in it.

Two bails are to be drawn at random, one after the other. What is the probability that they are (i) both white or (ii) black?\nOutput: Black and White are the only possible outcomes\nThe first question asks the probability of getting two white beads drawn. The number of total beads is 18, and the number of white beads is 8. There is a 1/3 chance of getting two white beeds.\nSimilarly, we subtract the number of white beeds that we need from the total beeds. We subtract 8 from 18 to get 10. This is our total number of red and black beads.\nSince both red and black beads have 10 beads together, there is a 1/10 chance that any one of them will be drawn.\nSo the final answers are 1/3 and 1/10\n\nInput:(A is a subset of B), and (B is a subset of C).

The probability that Jack has dinner is 1. The probability that Jack doesn't have dinner is 0.5 (so, you have a 50% chance). Jack has either a pizza and sode for dinner or he doesn't have dinner at all, so he has a 1 \u2013 0.5 chance of having a pizza and sody, or a 0.5 chance for no dinner at all. You combine these two probabilities to get 1 \u2013 0 + 0.5 \u2013 0.5, which can also be re-expressed as 0 + 0 (and it's still only probabilities of 0 and 1!).\nThe two probabilities are a pizza and sodu or no dinner, so 0 + 0 = <<0+0=0>>\nThis means that the probability that Jack will either have a pizza and sod, or not have dinner at all equals 0 + 0, and is therefore 0.\nSo the final probability is 0", "answer": "C: authentic"}

{"text": "Explanation for answer: <<The full statement is: 'Mark wanted to know the full truth about his existence, because he didn' t want to continue existing in ignorance.'. Ignorance can be an adjective, an adverb, or a noun, so we have to decide and then choose the correct form depending on it.>>\nIf the verb that governs the subject noun is in the past - Mark wanted to know the truth about his existence in the past - then the words in the past will be adverbs, for example: <<He didn't want to lie to you in the past>>. If the verb that governs is in the past, the adverb in the past becomes an adjective, for example: <<His past was the best thing that's ever happened to him>>. Similarly, if the verb that governs (gives a tense) to the subject noun is a present participle then it becomes a present participle, and will be an adjective, for instance: <<He had hoped to tell the truth in the future>>. If the verb in the sentence is a past participle then it becomes an adjective, and if it is a present participle, it becomes an adverb, for example: <<The past story of the lie had been a big mistake>>.\nHere the verb governing is the verb in the main clause, which in this sentence is the verb want - Mark wants to know the truth, so the adjective in the sentence will be this: <<Mark wants to know the truth about - or in reference to the situation of - his existence>>.\nFrom that noun phrase we extract the noun (the subject of our sentence) which would be Mark, so we extract the word his and then apply the rules of adjective use in the English language, which we can find at this link https://www.thoughtco.com/english-grammar-adjectives-508591. It can vary depending on the country or the specific circumstances, but basically we should use the article (here it is his).\nI think you got it: Mark is the pronoun of the subject and wants to know the truth but as the sentence doesn't say where he wants to know this truth he must be in some place. The phrase his existence contains an abstract noun (existence: the state or fact of living) so this phrase can be re", "answer": "C: ignorance"}

We can create a new variable named g. If x = <<x=>>x, then the equation becomes: 7 + x + g = 8  - x -  g \nIf we subtract both sides by 8 - g, we have the equation: g =  (8 -  g) + 7\nSubtracting both sides by g, we have the new equation: g = 7\nTherefore, g = 7\nSubstituting the value of g into the left and right sides of the equation, x + 7 = x - 7\nDividing both by 7, we arrive at:  x =  7. We can see from the numbers that x is equal to 7, so the final answer is 7.", "answer": "E: hands"}

It is evident by the number of people in the waiting room that Dr. Jerry is running behind. When Dr. George leaves to go out and grab a bite to eat, he is startled by the number of people he saw in Dr. Jerry's waiting room before he made his departure. If there were three other people ahead of him and twenty-nine other people waiting in the clinics lobby before he got there, how many people were ahead of him in the clinic\u2019s waiting room?\nOutput:Let x= the total number of people sitting in the doctor's waiting room.\nThree + (29+x) = 27 (29 + x), where the equation represents the total number of people in the doctor's lobby.\nCombining like-terms, we get 3 + (29+ x) = 29 (29 + x)\nSubtracting the 29 from both sides of the equation we get (29 + x-29) = 0\nDividing both side by 29, we get ( x-29 )/ 29 = 0\nSince ( x-29 == 29), x-29=(29/2)  x-29 = 14.5, where( )=2\nx = 14.\nSo George was twelfth in line.\nSo the final ans was 14\n\nInput:John is the owner of a business.

Each subsequent week, the ratio of the two genders is halved. The final ratio of boys and girls on the last week of April.\nOutput: In the first week, the town had an even distribution of boys and girls, which is why it was evenly divided. In total the town had 10*4 = 40 boys and girls. One half of that number is 20, or 40 divided by 2.\nSince the town has 40 total people, there are 20 girls and 20 boys. In the second week, the ratio of boys and girls is halved, 20 divided by 2 or 10. Half of that number is 5, or 20 divided by half.\nAfter the second week, there would be 20 boys and 5 girls. In the third week, the town has another 20/2, so 10 boys and 0 girls, meaning all boys. Then in the fourth week, the town has 20/4, which is 5 boys again. And finally, in the last week, the town has no girls left at all. So 4 weeks after initially dividing into one half, the total ratio is 1:4.\nSo the final outcome is: 1:4\n\nInput: A carpenter purchased some pine wood. If he cuts", "answer": "C: desk"}

The negative values show on the calculator when you are subtracting two numbers. The answer to subtracting a negative and a negative is positive. However, when a negative and a positive value is subtracted, the answer is negative.\n\n## Question number #2\n\n| Question type   | \n| --------------- | \n| Question type  \t|\n\nOutput: The pizza slices cost $3.35\n\nThis question asked the student to answer if the slices of pizza were larger or cost more. It required a basic computation involving multiplication and division of the cost for the pizza by the number of slices. For a pizza with more slices, the total price would automatically be higher and will cost less if the number of slices are few. This shows the multiplication or division of the two different terms. When dealing with money, this is the most general computation that a student would encounter.\n\n## Question Number#3\n\n| Question type \t \t \t  \t \t| \n| -------------- |\n| Question type 2 | \n| Question number #3 | \n\nOutput : The answer to the question is a.

We then want to find what this % means in terms of weight by using the concept of density.  Density is a measure of how much matter there is in a given unit of space.  By multiplying 1.8 with the volume of ink (1.8 L), we find that 1.8% is the same as 98.2% of the density.

Next, we divide 500% by 18% to get 28\nWe then will substract the 28% from 100% to get 72%.

Sydney can complete a single problem alone in three minutes and three minutes working with Avery. Likewise, Avery can complete the single problem alone in four minutes and three minutes working together. The total time it takes to complete the 12 problem set depends on how many homework problems they are doing independently or together. If the work set is completed together (Avery and Sydney), how long does it take to complete the problems?\nOutput: This question is not worded clearly, so let's restate it.\nSydney can complete a single problem in three minutes alone and three minutes working with a person named Avery. Similarly, Avery can complete a single problem, alone in four minutes and the combination of three minutes working with Sydney.\nSince each math homework problem in a set of 12, takes Sydney three minutes to complete alone and six minutes working with Avery, the total number of minutes Sydney and Avery spent working together is 3 + (6*11/12) = << 3+0.5=3>>3 minutes.

The current year is 5 months. As a result, the baby is now 36 + <<5=41>>41 months old. So, we can say that after 5 months, the baby's age is 36 + <<41=77>>5 months old.\nLet (x) denote the number of years in the period since its birth, the number of years (x + y) is therefore 36 months plus 5 months, or 40 months.\nAfter 12 months of its 40 month life, the year (x + y) becomes 40 + 12,", "answer": "E: revolution"}

I found out during the sale that my total book borrowing is 30 for the 3 months of schooling and 76 for the 9 months of schooling.\n\nIf I had borrowed a book from the library in only 12 out of 12 months that I have been at the library, what is my average monthly book borrowing?\nOutput: My average number of books borrowed per month:\n\n(3 months)/12 months = 12/3 = 4\n\nSo the total months that I borrow books = 12\nMy total number of books borrowed = 30\nMy average number of books borrowing = 30 / 12= <<30/12=2>>2 books\n\nInput: What kind of information would be useful for my project?\n\nAnswer : C\n\nInput: My project consists of different parts for each class assignment.\n\nAnswer : C and D\n\nInput: Students at my school must use the library's databases for a research project for each class.

{"text": "I need deodorant! The correct answer is A: medicine cabinet.\n\n\n\nInstruction:Answer the following short answer question.\n\n## Input:You are taking a trip around the world. The trip requires going over every land mass on the planet and there are not many ways to do it. Each land mass you visit is considered a separate trip. For example, if you take a trip from the US to China then take a trip from China to Madagascar and then back to the US, this would result in 2 trips, one from the US to China and one from China to the US. So far, you have taken 14 trips. What is the maximum number of trips you could have taken?\n\n## Output:There are a lot of ways to think about this question but you can model it using a binary tree. Imagine taking your trips as separate nodes on a binary tree. The root represents landing somewhere, so each node on the tree represents a trip out and then a trip back. The final answer is equal to 2^n-1 where n equal the total number of trips you have taken. Since we have already taken 14 tripe, 2^14-1= <<2^14-2> =316620>>316621trips would constitute the final answer. \n\nInput: If a triangle is one side long and one side wide, how many different such triangles can be made if the side length is between 2 and 100?\nOutput: You may notice this question is very similar to the one you answered above, which asks how many trips you could take around the world. This is because we are asking a similar question: how many different sized triangles can we make from 3 sides? The way to answer this question is just a mathematical application of the same principle. First create an empty array to store all the triangles that can be made. Second, you need to loop through each side length between 2 and 6 in increments of 2. You can then create a list of triangles for that length and add them to your array. Now that you have created all the triangles for the given size, you need to see if any length length can not be obtained. If the length is divisible by 2, this means the other two sides must also be divisible by 2.", "answer": "D: grocery store"}

There are 15 eggs in 25 dozen, 15 eggs in a half dozen and 7 eggs in 6 dozen. We know there are 6 eggs to every dozen. If you sold 25 dozen how many eggs would you have left?\nOutput: If you sold 20 dozen, you would have 25 dozen - 20 dozen = <<25-20=5>>5 dozen.\nIf there are 6 eggs in a dozen, the number of eggs in 5 dozen is 5*6 =  <<5*6=8>>8 eggs.\nIf there are also 7 eggs in a dozen, this means the difference between the number of eggs in a half dozen (15) and a dozen (12 eggs) is 12 - 15 = - <<12-15=13>>13/2 eggs.\nIf there is a half dozen left after you sell 20 dozen, this means that there are - >> <<13/2>-20=6>>6 remaining eggs.\nSo the final  answer is 6\n\nInput: In your class, there are six boys and one girl for a total of 7.

This means that at least one of the boys must invite the the girl for her to join them.\nThere are 6 boys remaining after the lastboy invites the girl. At least 3 of the 6 boys must  invite the girl for the to join them.\nSo the final choice is:  At least 3 boys\n\nInput: A dog walks three miles to get to work.

These questions cannot easily be answered with just a yes or no and would need specific information about what routes are taken, what the distance is, what the road is like, is gasoline available, etc..  We choose the answer choice that best describes a road trip and is most similar to what we do when we travel a road.  In our example, we would choose Option 1, because a route is directly described and the road network is explicitly mentioned.\nBecause of the way the question is asked, we can be assured that the answer choices are mutually exclusive.  If we had seen Option 2 without seeing any information about another route, we might have thought that this was also a method for getting to DC.  However, the text specifies a route, making option 2 not applicable.\nSo the final choices are : \"1), There is a direct route 2) There are toll en route\"\n\nInput: When the sun was first created, it was always day.

The temperature of the third ice cream scoop was 35\u00b0C. A person bought the ice cream scoops at the airport during a flight, because it is freezing at the airport. When they got on the plane and began traveling, the ice cream scoop and air began to melt, and as the plane was getting warmer the ice cream started to melt faster, which caused more warming as the ice cream melted. So once the fourth ice cream scoop melted there was no more ice cream remaining to melt for that scoop. Therefore, the temperature of the fourth ice cream would be higher than all the other ice cream scoots because it started with the highest temperature.\nThe temperatures of the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth ice scoops would all be -98\u00b0C because they were frozen.

If you have the extra time to do house work without becoming tired, you are not only bored but also tired, which is E.\n\nIf you do not feel any type of emotion or stress, anxiety, or tired from doing house work. You do not feel any of these emotions, so you might be happy. A is the answer. Happy is also not an emotion, so B is not the answer. You feel happy only if you do not have any type of emotion, so C is not the answer. If you are not feeling any emotion after house work, you feel stress but are not also happy, so D is not the answer.\n\nIf you are not happy, you might or might not feel any of the possible emotions listed earlier, including boredom, anxiety, and tiredness. Without knowing whether you are happy or not, you cannot accurately judge whether you would feel angry or worried from completing house work. Angry and unhappy emotions are emotions you can have if you know that you feel another emotion. Also, if you feel unhappy, you won't feel calm or happy since the two emotions are opposite of one another. If you do not feel any emotion and do not feel any of the emotions before you, you are happy and do not feel either boredom, anxieties, or tiredness. E is the answer.\n\nInput: If \"I got lost\" is considered a statement, what is a sentence that is the opposite of a statement", "answer": "C: stress"}

Choices: 3/8\n3/25\n7/25\n15/25\n34/25\n79/25\nOutput: A 1/4 represents a quarter of what is whole. Similarly, a 3/8 represents about a quarter of what it is.\nNow, ask yourself, why do you divide 14/24 or 14 into 24 whole things to get 3/8? This makes perfect sense if you understand percent. If 14/25 = 0.56 and 1/4 = 0.25 then 56/25 = 2/4, or 1/2 because 1/2 and 2/4 are the same. Now consider in terms of numbers. 25 is equal to five multiplied by four or 2 to the fourth power (2^4). This means that 1/4 is the reciprocal of five fourth! So, if 2/4 is 1/2, then 1/2 the reciprocal of two-fifths is... 2 times 2 is 4, and 4 is 2^2. This means that 2/5 must be half as big as 2. So to get to find 2/8 or 3/8 you must take one half of your original number and divide it by 5 or 2. So your answer is C: 3/8.\n\nInput:How many integers are between 12 and 27?", "answer": "E: conscious"}

John and his little brother each had one hot dog. That means John' story and his big brother each had 2 + 2 = 4 hot dogs. They had 4 chickens, 2 hams, and 4 hot dogs. How many more hot dogs than chickens did they have?\nOutput: John and his parents each ate two chickens. Also, the 2 chickens that John ate had 2 hot dogs each.\nJohn and his mom have a chicken and a steak total, which equals to 3 chickens + 1 steak = 4 chickens.\nJohn and his dad each ate a chicken and a ham.\nSo his dad ate 2 chicken and one ham, which equals to 4 chickens + 0 hams = 4 hams\nJohn ate a chicken with 2 hot dogs, and John's brother ate 2 hot dogs.\nSo John, his parents, his brother and one chicken equals to 4 chicken + 4 hot dogs = 8 hot dogs\nTherefore hot dogs exceed chickens by 8 hot dogs.\nSo the answer is 8\n\nInput: There is a family of four, the father, the mother, the son and the daughter.

{"text": "If you wanted to store your chess pawn when you weren't using it, the best place to store it would be at a chess store. It does not make sense to put the chess pawn in a chess set, because then, when you are using it, it would be difficult to retrieve. It would also seem strange to put the chess into a toy store, even if you were going to play with the chess pawn, because that's what would happen. Furthermore, since the chess piece was not a toy, it does not make sense to keep it in the toy store. Putting the chess game in the case would make it easy to place the chess pawn away, but then when you want to take the chess pawn out, it would be difficult. However, putting the chess pawn inside the chess game's storage case would solve this problem since then it would be simple to either bring out the chess pawn or keep it inside the case. The final decision is to put the chess in a chess game's case to store it away.\n\nInput: When using a 99% efficient solar panel, I can produce about 0.98 W(s) per foot of panel surface area during the day, given an optimal temperature of 70 degrees F.

Dr. James knows that some patients are simply falsifying their illnesses, but he doesn\u2019t know which patients in his group are to be trusted.\n\n### Dr. James questions Patient A. Dr. James says, \u201cI\u2019m curious to know how you deal with your bipolar disorder. How do you handle day-to-day functioning and when did you originally get diagnosed with Bipolar disorder?\u201d  Dr. James wants to know how well this patient was able to handle symptoms of bipolar disorder while growing into adulthood. After Patient responds saying \u201cMy psychiatrist told me that I must take medications like mood stabilizers to keep my moods even.\u201d This answer seems acceptable to Dr. James because it is the appropriate response given that the patient is diagnosed with bipolar disorder in their youth.\n\n### At the end of the session with Patient A, Dr. James asks Patient B to come in. Dr. James asks, \u201cDo you feel suicidal?\u201d\n\n### Dr, James is disappointed with these two patients. Patient A knows how to play the psychiatric interview and answers correctly, but is still at risk for committing suicide. The patient admits to having suicidal ideation but feels that suicidal ideation is hereditary, so she doesn\u2019t feel that her suicidal ideation is related to her current anxiety.

{"text": "Answer A for an 80% response rate, or at least 400 responses.\n\n### Feedback:\n\nIn this task the multiple choice question can be answered using the information that is given at the\ninstruction. Below are questions and their answers.\n\n  1. Five less than three times is 10 less than 3 times the result. The result is thus 10 less than the number\nthirty. Using that fact, it is found that the number of Dobermann puppies are 20. The number of Schnauzer\npuppies are 55.\n  2. After subtracting the number of toothbrushes given away in February from the ones given away in November, the difference is 39. Dividing the difference 39 by 2 we get  15.5. 15.5 is half the difference between the number the number of tooth brushes given away in January and February. The number the number of to theoth brushes the doctor gave away in January was 53. Now the answer can be used to solve for the number of toothpaste the doctor had in March.\n  3.  There are  216   seashells, 192 on Monday and 68 on Tuesday.\n  4. The number of fish remains 18, since there was  9  on Monday when it capsized, and  9  extra on Tuesday. \n  5. One way to get to the answer of 36 is by using the fact that the shadows are 6 hours from noon. If the number of\nfeet in the shadows after 6 years (or 1 million, or 100 million, depending on what number of hours 6 hours is)\nwill be 360 feet, then the number of feet in the total number of shadows must  be 360 over 360, or 6 feet. The\nshortest shadow at noon is 6 feet long. Therefore, the longer shadow will be 6*(6*5)= 360 feet.\n  So, if they grow 360 feet longer in  1 year, it can be inferred that they grow 6 feet each  1 hour, and thus\n  3  feet (or", "answer": "D: dinner"}

{"text": "Answer in complete sentences.\n\n> I chose to answer the question above as A. Town. What is your answer?\n\nWhen doing a survey like this, a person would not likely go to somewhere like a hotel because there are no places in the hotel to eat your own food. The person would look around to see if the restaurant is next to a mall or is on Yellow Pages to get a better idea and more direction if they are new to an area. However, there is no need to look next to a mall because the person is most likely eating at a hotel, so we would have a choice of \"a\" the town. If we think the person is using this to look at places to eat, they would first look on Yellow Pages since it's a list of the places in town that sells particular food, and the person would more than likely find a local restaurant or food chain.\n<br>\nIf they looked in a \"town\" area, the restaurant is most likely there. In the small area if you walk around town or the city, there will be a restaurant in every block.  <br>\nThey could be on the main street or on a side street. The main street gives you more of an impression of what the town is trying to offer, and the \"side-street\" gives you the feeling that you need to be there for a long period of time until it passes by.

Therefore, shuddering is the sign of living a life soon, not perspiration.\n\n### Input 1: What is the difference between \"The cat ran over her face' and \"Her face was run over by the cat\" for the sentence \"I tripped over the cat while I walked home yesterday\"?\n\n### Response1\n#### 1.\nThe first sentence implies that the cat is alive and not dead or that the narrator tripped over the cat's corpse or even over the cat in person. That is, 'The cat ran over her' implies the cat was or is alive, thus is an active verb. 'Her face was run over' implies that her face was not, it isn't, and won't be alive. That is, 'Her face was run' implies that the cat ran OVER her face, implying cat's dead and its corpse. That is, \n'The cat ran over her'' can't be the same as 'Her face was run...' \n\n#### 2.\nIf one person trips over a cat and injures themselves, they say 'I tripped over the Cat'. If one person trips over something else and injures themselves, it goes back to 'I tripped over...', only now there is an adjective, so it'd go back to 'I triped over...(whatever they triped over)'.\n\n#### 3.\n\nThe first sentence is more of a statement, and implied that the cat ran over her face; I tripped over the cat means I tripped over something which could have been the cat\n\n#### 4.\nWhile technically 'The cat ran over my face' is wrong, I think it can be disregarded because this sentence is only meant to show you that the cat ran over the face and the cat didn't run over mine face, it ran over another person's face. This sentence doesn't really have an intended structure.\n\n#### 5.\nThis sentence can say either way, but I feel that using her face can be understood better in context.\n\n### Response 2 (to the wrong response provided above)\nIf you're not sure of the rules, then you shouldn", "answer": "E: palpitations"}

There are 31 days in a month.  Since there are 31 days (3 x 10) in a month, the days can be simplified to 3.  There are 24 hours (2 x 12) in a day, and since there are 31 (3 x 11) whole days in a month the number of hours are 49 (3 x 13, 5 + 6, 6 + 6, 7 + 6, 8 + 5, 13 + 7, 13 +8)  In terms of seconds: 1 hour = 60 minutes = 60 seconds  Since there are 49 hours, 49 x 60 = 2860 seconds (rounded)The number of seconds left in a month is 2860.\n\n### Review\nTell me how to calculate perimeter.\n\n### InputInput:10 times the perimeter is 73 centimeters.

{"text": "The answer is the letters A or B.\n\n### Input\n\nThe number of Doberman pupies is 65.\n\n### Response\n\nThe answer is 55.\n\n## Explanation\nThe question can either be answered with basic arithmetic or with some use of the distributive property (which is essentially multiplying the numerator by all the denominators).\n\n### Multiplication\nIf the number of Dobermans is 65 and the number of Schnausers is 65/2=32.5 then 65-32.5+32.5=55. (Also since the Dobermans and Schnausers are the 9.5 units on either side (65/2= 32.5 2=37.5) it is easier to do this with fractions)\n\n### Distribution\nMultiplying the number of Dobermand puppies by 2 and subtracting the number of sheep leads to the same result (55) by distributing first\n\n1. Multiply 65 by 3\n2. Subtract 32 (1/2 of 3 times 3)\n3. Add 32 (1 times 3 plus 1/2 of 1 times 3)\n\nWhich is\n\n65 x 3-32+32=55", "answer": "A: zoo"}

{"text": "A\n\n### Instructor Comments\nYou did great, nice job!\n\n### Solution:\nA: Charming is the correct response here.  The answer is _A_.  Choices have to be reasonable, so the house and space shuttle are not correct.  It's been breathed by many, many people so it can't be on the train station.  It's on earth so can't be space.\n\n### Input 2:\nA: charming B: ocean C: house D: office E: train station\n\n### Response 2:\nB: Oceans (specifically, the sea) are full of salt from the ocean water, while the air we breathe is fresh from the earth.  If you think of how much water there is compared to land, then it would be crazy to imagine an entire ocean worth of salt is breathed by people.\n\n### Correct Answer:\nThe ocean is the correct answer because oceans have water that has been in them for much longer than land (even though some land water is many years old) so it would be unreasonable to think that an entire ocean of salt water would be able to be inhaled by humans.  Ocean air is not always unhealthy to breth through and it's not a polluted air.  Also, ocean air does not contain much oxygen which is the main part of breathable air (oxygen).  \n\n### Input(3):\nA: charming\n\n### Response(3):\nIn the first part of this question, it said that the air has been breathed by \"many people recently\" but the way the last sentence is presented just makes it sound like the majority of air in the ocean recently breathed is only recent, but in the actual air and water the oceans do contain quite a lot of oxygen.\n\n### Solution(3):\nThe answer to this would be \"C\".  If the previous statement was used in the text, then it would make sense to assume that it was referring to the sea that people breathe.   The ocean air that many people breathe is filled with fresh oxygen and other good elements.  The ocean is an enormous body of water that contains far more oxygen and good elements than any land.

This is a true or false question, so if we exclude choice E the answer is B. \u201cOnce\u201d was done earlier in the text, so in order for this to be a \u201conce\u201d sentence stem we must exclude choice C and B.\n\n### Challenge Exercise", "answer": "E: falling down"}

There are four times more people that do not like cherries as people there like strawberries. There are 25% fewer people that like cherries as people like apples.\nHow many people like strawberry?\n\nAnswer : We have to use variables. First we can name the varieties and their quantities in the array. The name of one of the variables is \"c\".\n\nLet x( apples ), y( cherries ), z( strawberries ). y = x +c, because we know there are four times more people like apples as there are people there not like apples.   So    Let \"x\" = 1. y = x +2c\n\nand c = 0.5\n\nThen  y = 1+2*0.5 = 1.5   z = y+0.5*1.5 = 1   so z = 1  \n\nLet x = 0.5.  y = x +2x = 0.5 +2*0.5  = 1    z= 0.5 \n\nLet x =0    then y = 2x = 2*0=0      z= 0", "answer": "D: school grade"}

The museum takes up an entire city block, a series of old brick warehouses that used to hold cotton from the South and produce from the Midwest. When I was there, the exhibits were closed for renovations, but my friend gave me a special tour.  \n  \nOne exhibit in particular caught my attention, a curator's work space off a big open hallway filled with old wooden crates. Inside the room were two stacks of wooden boxes. One stack was about ten inches tall, the other was much taller, probably three feet. A pile of old newspaper clippings was spread across the floor.  \n  \nI asked my friend what she was working on, but she just answered with a grin, 'Don't ask, it's a secret.'  A curator doesn't have to tell you what she's working on when she's at work.  \n  \nA few weeks later I got to thinking about curators. I was sure I could write a story about a curator, but I wasn't sure where to  start.  \n\nI got the idea for the main character in my story, a boy named J.J., from a couple of other things I was reading.  The first book was Clive Barker's _Cabal,_ a horror novel for adults. In the book, there is a group of teenagers who get together to perform an occult ceremony in their old high school. One character in the novel is a boy named Jake. I thought that Jake sounded like the type of name for a boy that would hang out with a bunch of other boys doing things they shouldn't. The other book was Neil Gaiman's fantasy novel _Coraline_. I don't really think Coraline was an interesting character, but I thought J.J. was a name that sounded a little strange.  When I  heard J.J.

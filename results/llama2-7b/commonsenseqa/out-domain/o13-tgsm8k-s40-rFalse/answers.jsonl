So let's call this x, so x is equals to nine and ten. Then we have five less than three times, we can just take ten from and just add five, so this is equal to two times x plus X and plus one. We're trying to solve for X, so let's subtract all this from both sides. We see that if, so minus five is greater than, so we're trying to solve that, if minus five is equal to x. And then we'll minus this to both sides. So it's equal to two times X. And then we're trying to get all of this over here. So I'm going to multiply both sides of that one. We have this and this, and I'll just use a little trick for times. Times times is the same as a times a. Times times is the a times a, so what we'll do is we do a times a, minus one times x, and I'll take that right there. So this is equal to x times x. Times times is the, equals, times minus one times x and minus one times x. We subtract everything in here. We have 2 times X and we get X squared, so 2 times X squared is equal to x squared and 2 times X squar. What I can do is I can distribute the two through here, so I'll have two times X. And if I take the, I'm going to subtract this two from that one, and I'll have two, so this is squared and two times X is going to be x squared,", "answer": "E: synagogue"}

{"text": "A\n\n### Solution:\n<details markdown =\"1\"><summary>Solution in English</summary><br>If we have the input, x = 20 as the number of Dobermans, then we have the answer, y = 55. If we are not given the input, the only way to get the answer, y, is to plug in the x value that is given. If we know that x = 20 and we know the answer, y =55, then we simply have to find the equation that will give us the result. We know that we have to subtract a 1 and use a minus sign: 20-9 = 11. Then we can do the operations to get the actual answer, 55. Remember, if you are doing problems, you always have to look at the answer and find the formula that will make what you will be given an output. You might think 11-2 is the answer. It's not. It's 9 because if you subtract 2 from 11, the answer is minus 9. <br>\nIf we have the input as x = 20, then we have the following formula in terms of x:  y = 2(x)  because (x)*2 will always equal you x * 3 and 3*x will always equal 2*x <br>\nIf you have a product and then a plus, both the product and the plus get multiplied by two. That is the same for x and y:  y = 30 <br>\n\n</details><details markdown =\"1\">\n<summary>Solution in Japanese</summary><br>\n\n- If the input is given, it is easy to get the answer. In the example,  x = 20 <br>\ny = 55 is simple because you can divide 20 by 5 to get 4, but 35 = 70, so you do this as 20 + (1/7) and you get the right answer, 70 and that equals 55 <br>\n- If you are not given an input, the only way of getting the answer, y is to find some x value that will give you y. In this case x=20, so we can use the formula y = 2x <br>", "answer": "A: bus stop"}

{"text": "B   Answer Key A is not possible because people would not find bills with bread at restaurants. People get their bread at places like bakeries, they do not get bread with their meals. Bread is also not given at Congress, since no one has been in Congress since the civil war. The only place where people would find bills with bread inside is a bread store. These stores sell many different types of bread which people buy to put on their tables or on their own food.   Answer key C is not possible either. People put bills inside their envelopes, not the other way around. Bills are placed inside envelopes because they would otherwise get wet if they were placed in a mail box. If a bill has a wet stamp, it cannot be legally used.   D is not correct. Mail boxes only have small letters and not bills. Mail boxes are used to send mail like letters and forms to people. Bills, however, are never sent through this type of mailbox. In addition, most people would probably complain about having bills inside of a cheese factory because the bills may be dirty from handling money at their jobs, and food may even end up being coated with bills. Bills are dirty after money has gone through them in cash registers, so cheese would definitely not want to come into contact with them.   E is not correct either. The envelope has a zip code on it for mailing purposes. Envelope codes do not have bills on them. Bills are found inside bread boxes or inside other mail boxes with other types of mail. \n\n### Instruction:Answer the question below by calculating the given value in the prompt to the nearest million.\n\nCalculate 7.5 + 2\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\nInput and Output:  If the smallest prime number is 2, how many different ways can you pick 2 prime numbers that are less than or equal to 21?\nOutput: 60\n\nInput and Output If the smallest prime number was 7, how many different ways could you choose two prime numbers from 21 to 27?\nOutput:  __3,360__\n\n### Instructor:Please submit your answer to the homework\n\nInput Output :2.05 + 1\n### Instructure: Please", "answer": "A: restaurant"}

If the wind starts blowing 360 degrees and increases in speed to 9 m/s, the relative humidity returns to 65%, the temperature changes to.9 degrees C and the dew point becomes.24, what is happening?\nOutput: The wind has become a tornado. This is confirmed because all 4 of the parameters (wind direction and speed, temperature, dew point and relative humidity) change. Wind direction changes to 360 (the opposite direction from North which is the wind\u2019s current direction) which is a clear indication that the tornado is forming. Once it is a tornado, both wind direction and speed remain constant, the temperature increases, dew point decrease, and relative humidity remains the same. These factors indicate the tornado\u2019s wind isn\u2019t as strong and isn\u2019t traveling as fast which means it\u2019s weaker. The tornado is likely to dissipate so the tornado is likely to weaken.", "answer": "C: despair"}

{"text": "A\n \n\n### Solution explanation:\nIn the first question, the answer is 55 because the number of Dobermans must be 20 (which we cannot have given the statement \"it is equal to 9\").\n\nThe rule used on the first question can be applied to the next one as well. In the second question, we can substitute 20 each time. The question becomes, \"What is the difference between 5 times the number of Schnauer puppies and the value of the expression 5 times the number Schnauer puppys?\n\nAs a result, 53 plus 67 is the second difference, and 45 and 43 are the third and final difference.\n\nThe answer is, respectively, 9, 36, and 54.\n\nApplying the same concept to the third question, we can use the same substitution to solve: 5 times the number Doberan puppies is 165, and we need our answer to be 165+90=255\n\nThus 165 is the number of Dobermers, and our answer is 165+55. In the fourth question, we can again use substitution: 7 and 4 are the differences between the number of 52 less 330 and the number of toothbrushes given.\n\nTo solve our problem, we need to find the number of tooth brushes given.\nThe answer is in the answer: 20 less toothbrushes is 130, giving us 130+52.\n\nThe fifth question is the same problem, applying the same substitution. In question 6, the substitutions have been established already. We can solve this one with a 4x4 grid. \n\nAs shown above, we need to find 48. This, however, requires knowing the sum of the two sides 5 columns back. We need 90-34, for a total of 56. Thus we need to add 2 rows to complete our 4x4 grid, and place the solution at the intersection of the 3rd and 4th columns. And, of course, we can apply the same rule as in question 5 to get our answer.\n\nIn the seventh question, we can", "answer": "D: electric refrigerator"}

The `while` loop's logic is that it runs a block of statements and asks a question, until `Whatever I am going to ask` is always `true` for all the values of the variable (condition) I put inside the while loop.\n\nFor example, the `while` in the [first sample question](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_question#Input) is:\n\n\\begin{code}\nWhile (condition) { statements ; }\n\\end{code}(where the condition should be `true` for all values of `variable_name`, which is equal to `number_of_puppies` in \"three times five less than\", and `number_of_Dobermans` in \"how many Schnauzels\" and \"how many seashells\". This makes it a while loop, that asks a question, then does more things based on the answer you gave it).\n\nIn the [second sample question](http://www.enotes.com/homework-help/doctor-banks-330-toothbrushes-give-away-patients-537561), the `condition` is `number_of_past_day!= number_of_future_day`, which is `true` for `number_of_future day > number_of_past day`.

How does the process of decomposition of a log differ from the process of decomposition of rotting food in a garbage can? What is the significance of these differences?\n \nDecomposition of a log will create new organisms and the process will be aided by the presence of sunlight. The log is decomposing without human interference and there are no bacteria or microorganisms involved. Rotting food will produce the smell, heat and bacteria of decomposition. \n \n2. Explain the concept of aerification as it relates to both composting and soil improvement. What process occurs during aerification? \n \nTo aerify soil, you turn it and make air holes all throughout so that a bacteria that requires oxygen can eat and then be transported by worms. To aerify compost, you mix everything up so the bacteria can eat it up. It is essential to aerify both in order to have a successful compost pile and healthy grass.\n \n3. Explain the relationship between aerobic bacteria and anaerobic bacteria. \n \nBacteria like oxygen. If you leave it out (in compost or soil) the bacteria that uses oxygen to breathe is unable to break down the waste items and thus the compost or soil will start to smell.\n \n4. List a few ways to increase the decomposition process of your compost pile. \n \n- Mix it up to increase oxygen content.\n- Add water\n- Add", "answer": "C: new hampshire"}

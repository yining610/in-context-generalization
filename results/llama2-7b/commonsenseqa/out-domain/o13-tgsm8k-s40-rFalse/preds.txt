So let's call this x, so x is equals to nine and ten. Then we have five less than three times, we can just take ten from and just add five, so this is equal to two times x plus X and plus one. We're trying to solve for X, so let's subtract all this from both sides. We see that if, so minus five is greater than, so we're trying to solve that, if minus five is equal to x. And then we'll minus this to both sides. So it's equal to two times X. And then we're trying to get all of this over here. So I'm going to multiply both sides of that one. We have this and this, and I'll just use a little trick for times. Times times is the same as a times a. Times times is the a times a, so what we'll do is we do a times a, minus one times x, and I'll take that right there. So this is equal to x times x. Times times is the, equals, times minus one times x and minus one times x. We subtract everything in here. We have 2 times X and we get X squared, so 2 times X squared is equal to x squared and 2 times X squar. What I can do is I can distribute the two through here, so I'll have two times X. And if I take the, I'm going to subtract this two from that one, and I'll have two, so this is squared and two times X is going to be x squared,

If we are not given the input, the only way to get the answer, y, is to plug in the x value that is given. If we know that x = 20 and we know the answer, y =55, then we simply have to find the equation that will give us the result. We know that we have to subtract a 1 and use a minus sign: 20-9 = 11. Then we can do the operations to get the actual answer, 55. Remember, if you are doing problems, you always have to look at the answer and find the formula that will make what you will be given an output. You might think 11-2 is the answer. It's not. It's 9 because if you subtract 2 from 11, the answer is minus 9. <br><n>If we have the input as x = 20, then we have the following formula in terms of x:  y = 2(x)  because (x)*2 will always equal you x * 3 and 3*x will always equal 2*x <br><n>If you have a product and then a plus, both the product and the plus get multiplied by two.

Choices:  A: restaurant B: congress C: envelope D: mail box E: cheese store<n>Output:		B   Answer Key A is not possible because people would not find bills with bread at restaurants. People get their bread at places like bakeries, they do not get bread with their meals. Bread is also not given at Congress, since no one has been in Congress since the civil war. The only place where people would find bills with bread inside is a bread store. These stores sell many different types of bread which people buy to put on their tables or on their own food.   Answer key C is not possible either. People put bills inside their envelopes, not the other way around. Bills are placed inside envelopes because they would otherwise get wet if they were placed in a mail box. If a bill has a wet stamp, it cannot be legally used.   D is not correct. Mail boxes only have small letters and not bills. Mail boxes are used to send mail like letters and forms to people. Bills, however, are never sent through this type of mailbox. In addition, most people would probably complain about having bills inside of a cheese factory because the bills may be dirty from handling money at their jobs, and food may even end up being coated with bills. Bills are dirty after money has gone through them in cash registers, so cheese would definitely not want to come into contact with them.   E is not correct either. The envelope has a zip code on it for mailing purposes. Envelope codes do not have bills on them. Bills are found inside bread boxes or inside other mail boxes with other types of mail. <n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question below by calculating the given value in the prompt to the nearest million.<n><n>Calculate 7.5 + 2<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n><n>Input and Output:  If the smallest prime number is 2, how many different ways can you pick 2 prime numbers that are less than or equal to 21?<n>Output: 60<n><n>Input and Output If the smallest prime number was 7, how many different ways could you choose two prime numbers from 21 to 27?<n>Output:  __3,360__<n><n>### Instructor:Please submit your answer to the homework<n><n>Input Output :2.05 + 1<n>### Instructure: Please

The forecast is for temperatures to go.3 degrees higher, dew points to go down.4, rel humidity increases to 100%, wind direction 9N and speed 6 m/s. If the wind starts blowing 360 degrees and increases in speed to 9 m/s, the relative humidity returns to 65%, the temperature changes to.9 degrees C and the dew point becomes.24, what is happening?<n>Output: The wind has become a tornado. This is confirmed because all 4 of the parameters (wind direction and speed, temperature, dew point and relative humidity) change. Wind direction changes to 360 (the opposite direction from North which is the wind’s current direction) which is a clear indication that the tornado is forming. Once it is a tornado, both wind direction and speed remain constant, the temperature increases, dew point decrease, and relative humidity remains the same. These factors indicate the tornado’s wind isn’t as strong and isn’t traveling as fast which means it’s weaker. The tornado is likely to dissipate so the tornado is likely to weaken.<n><n>

So, your function only takes in text from the command line, and returns nothing. So, your function definition should be:<n><n>    def calculate_and_print_answer (input: String):<n>        # This is where the logic of your program lives.<n><n># There are a variety of ways to write the function. You can use classes/objects if necessary (we actually don't recommend that, but you can if you really want to).<n># It is important that the function you write will do exactly what the challenge specifies.

This means it has access to strings, lists, classes and variables. It also has access to math functions, comparison functions, and so forth. If you need something that the function doesn't have access to, you can import that as well.<n><n># It is important to make sure that nothing is returning a value of None. If this occurs, there is an error in your code that is causing this. If you are working with multiple problems make sure you check if your function is printing any values.<n><n># This challenge was developed by our instructors for educational purposes so that you can learn important concepts in Python, and grow as a developer.<n><n># Important: You should NOT include any input in your repository.

Choices:  A: electric locomotive B: electric typewriter C: multi-coloured walrus D: electric refrigerator E: electric drill<n>Output:		A<n> <n><n>### Solution explanation:<n>In the first question, the answer is 55 because the number of Dobermans must be 20 (which we cannot have given the statement "it is equal to 9").<n><n>The rule used on the first question can be applied to the next one as well. In the second question, we can substitute 20 each time. The question becomes, "What is the difference between 5 times the number of Schnauer puppies and the value of the expression 5 times the number Schnauer puppys?<n><n>As a result, 53 plus 67 is the second difference, and 45 and 43 are the third and final difference.<n><n>The answer is, respectively, 9, 36, and 54.<n><n>Applying the same concept to the third question, we can use the same substitution to solve: 5 times the number Doberan puppies is 165, and we need our answer to be 165+90=255<n><n>Thus 165 is the number of Dobermers, and our answer is 165+55. In the fourth question, we can again use substitution: 7 and 4 are the differences between the number of 52 less 330 and the number of toothbrushes given.<n><n>To solve our problem, we need to find the number of tooth brushes given.<n>The answer is in the answer: 20 less toothbrushes is 130, giving us 130+52.<n><n>The fifth question is the same problem, applying the same substitution. In question 6, the substitutions have been established already. We can solve this one with a 4x4 grid. <n><n>As shown above, we need to find 48. This, however, requires knowing the sum of the two sides 5 columns back. We need 90-34, for a total of 56. Thus we need to add 2 rows to complete our 4x4 grid, and place the solution at the intersection of the 3rd and 4th columns. And, of course, we can apply the same rule as in question 5 to get our answer.<n><n>In the seventh question, we can

Cruzar la calle.<n>2. Caminar al otro lado de la calle.<n>3. Caminar a la paresma izquierda.<n>4. Caminar al paresma derecho.<n>5. Ir a la calle.<n><n>The answer can also be translated directly:<n>```<n>If each of these five statements are false, then all of them must also be false<n>I am a person.<n>I cross street.<n>I stand upright.<n>I speak Spanish.<n>I speak Chinese.<n><n>The first and last statements are simply false, so the remaining two are the only other possibilities for false.  And if you're speaking Chinese, then you'd need to cross the street.  So all five statements cannot be simultaneously false..<n>```<n>

This makes it a while loop, that asks a question, then does more things based on the answer you gave it).<n><n>In the [second sample question](http://www.enotes.com/homework-help/doctor-banks-330-toothbrushes-give-away-patients-537561), the `condition` is `number_of_past_day!= number_of_future_day`, which is `true` for `number_of_future day > number_of_past day`.

How does the process of decomposition of a log differ from the process of decomposition of rotting food in a garbage can? What is the significance of these differences?<n> <n>Decomposition of a log will create new organisms and the process will be aided by the presence of sunlight. The log is decomposing without human interference and there are no bacteria or microorganisms involved. Rotting food will produce the smell, heat and bacteria of decomposition. <n> <n>2. Explain the concept of aerification as it relates to both composting and soil improvement. What process occurs during aerification? <n> <n>To aerify soil, you turn it and make air holes all throughout so that a bacteria that requires oxygen can eat and then be transported by worms. To aerify compost, you mix everything up so the bacteria can eat it up. It is essential to aerify both in order to have a successful compost pile and healthy grass.<n> <n>3. Explain the relationship between aerobic bacteria and anaerobic bacteria. <n> <n>Bacteria like oxygen. If you leave it out (in compost or soil) the bacteria that uses oxygen to breathe is unable to break down the waste items and thus the compost or soil will start to smell.<n> <n>4. List a few ways to increase the decomposition process of your compost pile. <n> <n>- Mix it up to increase oxygen content.<n>- Add water<n>- Add

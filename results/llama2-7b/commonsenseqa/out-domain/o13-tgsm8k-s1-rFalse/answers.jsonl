For your case, it will have your array in the form `[[1200 /6, 1200 - (1200 / 6)], [2 * 6, 2 - 6]]`\n- For the eleventh question, use mod arithmetic to remove the remainder 2, so you have `1 / 3 * 20 + 2 * 60`\n- In the 22nd question, add the coins together as usual, giving 1 to your brother, and then subtracting from your sum.\n- In the final question, the money your mother has is less than the total remaining money.\n\n```", "answer": "D: think creatively"}

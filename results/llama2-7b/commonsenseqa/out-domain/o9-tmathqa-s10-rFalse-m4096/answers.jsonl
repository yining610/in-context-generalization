This problem requires the use of a while loop. The number of times your program should loop (that is, output the line of text) is the number stored as n (the number is at the beginning of the line). Your program needs to check to make sure that the number line inputted is a palindrome, as the palindrome is when there is the same digits in the string(that is left end and right end of the line), and the number you have to outputted is not in the same case(that is not upper or lower case letters). In my solution, I write the line by using String class, print it by using System.out.println, and compare them by using equals().(In my program, I am using a for loop to loop for checking the equal-status.) How can you improve my program? Input: n = 111\n\nOutput: 011011\n\n\n### Instruction:Answer the last question.\n\nInput \"A\" and \"B\" are both binary strings.

The maximum input length of the words should be 15.\n\n```python\nwords = (\"appetite\", \"vigor\")\nlength = 3\nresult = [[a,b] for a in words for b in words[1:]]\nfor i in range(0, len(result)):\n  for j in range(i+1, len(result)):   \n    result[i]+=result[j]\n\nprint(len(result))\n```\n\nThe code above implements a technique known as \"string rotation\" to find the number of different strings of length `length`. What this particular method does is it takes one character from each of the original two strings and then rotates it by using string rotation.\n\nThe code above is a simple and efficient approach to calculating the number of words that can be formed by rotating characters from two different words, without needing to worry about how to check whether a string can be formed from the letters of a given word.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93369006/147671439-56", "answer": "C: party"}

{"idx": 471, "text": "B\n### Explanation:\n### Time complexity analysis:\nFirst we iterate through all of the strings, for each string we iterate through all possible answers in a recursive way. We keep track of the last letter of the string, and if it matches the current answer, in the end, we just print out the answer if it is the same as the last input.\n### Space complexity analysis:\nWe keep the characters in an array, and store the answers in a dictionary. Both space complexities are O(n), where n is the size of the string.\n### Explanations to some of the questions (since there are a lot of questions asked, I will try to keep it as short as possible):\n* Question 1:\nWe know that, the number of absentee ballets are 11000 and 1/6 of 1100 are thrown out.\n\n6 * 1/6 = 1000, therefore there were 10000 absente ballots to begin with.\nAfter 1/6, there are 9400 left.\nIf there were 1/ 5 of them were throw out, then all answer choices would satisfy what the question is asking.\nBut we know that 1/6 * 5 = 1/10, hence we can eliminate C, because there would be less than 1000 remaining after they were throw out.\n\nWe can eliminate E, since the amount of remaining would be less than 8000.\nThe question says, how many absentee ballots did candidate B received?\nSince we know that there is 9400 remainings after 1/6 threw out and we know that 1 / 5 of them where they were throw out, we can deduct that there were 9400 * 1/ 5 = 1920 absentee ballots that have not yet been throw out if candidate B wins by 100% chance.\nThe question says there are 3 / 5 or 3 * 5 = 200 ( 5 is the remainder)\nHence B must have received 1920 + 200 or 2120\n\n* Question 2:\nThe total age of people A and B is 11 years greater than the", "answer": "C: backyard"}

{"idx": 624, "text": "D.\n\n## My Solution\na)In this question,we can use the formula `C = 12 000 * D / T = (12000 * 3) / 1200` where `C` is the Total number of valid votes. `T` is votes accepted. As we have `C = (120) + (2)*(12000) - (6)*(120)*(3) + (5)*(120)^2` 404 votes were not eligible. so, (120) becomes 564.  (2)*(10000) comes in because of the formula `(2)`. (1200*3) comes in because of (1)*(120)/3. (5)*(100) becomes `(5*6)` which is `(30)`.\nSo,\n`30*6 + 150 = 120` \n`4`\nSince, there are `c` choices so total number of `c` ways of selecting votes for both are `(11000+c+c-1)/2` so total number of votes cast for candidate `b` is `(11001+c+c-2)/2`. Hence, `8000`.\nb)This question follows a simple logic. Since, `((11 + 5) / 5) * ((11 + 2)*5)) = ((11)*5)/2 = 105/5`. Since, we have 2 extra 1,  we'll need to take half of it to get to 6.5. Adding all we get `(105*6.5)/2 = 839/2 = 419.5`. Now, in `(a+b)/2` we know that `(a+b)/(a*b)` will give us the average. So `(1100*6.5)/(1100*839) = 1260.`\nc)It's either `c` or `b`. I guess `b` is correct.\n\nd)In this question,let `A` be `[C + D]` and `B` be `[C \u2013 D", "answer": "E: medicine chest"}

Kennedy signed an act by the US congress creating a national holiday on the last thursday of November each year as a tribute to the country's veterans. This act also caused a slight problem for the school children of Seattle and other US cities.The Seattle school district made a rule where each student received one extra day off from school per year for the holiday and was allowed to pick which day to take off. Therefore, if all students took off everyday of the week, it would only cause 24 hours of lost schooling over the course of the year. If all students took off all 5 days for the holiday, it would cause a full 4 day holiday of lost schooling over 3 days of each of the remaining holidays. If each student took off all 5 week days of the holiday, it could cause 5 days of lost schooling over just 1 day for every following holiday. This meant that the most \"valuable\" day off was the one each student chose for themselves and that day was not worth having in lieu of any other day of the holiday because the lost schooling on them is the same. Which option for the Seattle students would be the most \"valuable\"?", "answer": "C: curry"}

"00011111011110010111010010"<n><n>Output: 110110000<n><n>Input: The problem is: Write a program that asks for an input, and when it begins, the line should read: n = 10; n = 664; and then the line should end. This problem requires the use of a while loop. The number of times your program should loop (that is, output the line of text) is the number stored as n (the number is at the beginning of the line). Your program needs to check to make sure that the number line inputted is a palindrome, as the palindrome is when there is the same digits in the string(that is left end and right end of the line), and the number you have to outputted is not in the same case(that is not upper or lower case letters). In my solution, I write the line by using String class, print it by using System.out.println, and compare them by using equals().(In my program, I am using a for loop to loop for checking the equal-status.) How can you improve my program? Input: n = 111<n><n>Output: 011011<n><n><n>### Instruction:Answer the last question.<n><n>Input "A" and "B" are both binary strings.

Another major factor for the increase in wheat and rice production has been the increase in crop area per seeds and yield. However, the contribution of yield to increase in production in grains and food crops cannot be ascribed entirely to the yield enhancing technologies, as land availability for growing these crops also increased.<n><n><n>Input: Which of the following countries in Europe is responsible for producing two - fifths of the total exports of beer in the world?

Choices:  A: grocery store B: nightstand C: armpits D: own bathroom E: medicine chest<n>Output:		D.<n><n>## My Solution<n>a)In this question,we can use the formula `C = 12 000 * D / T = (12000 * 3) / 1200` where `C` is the Total number of valid votes. `T` is votes accepted. As we have `C = (120) + (2)*(12000) - (6)*(120)*(3) + (5)*(120)^2` 404 votes were not eligible. so, (120) becomes 564.  (2)*(10000) comes in because of the formula `(2)`. (1200*3) comes in because of (1)*(120)/3. (5)*(100) becomes `(5*6)` which is `(30)`.<n>So,<n>`30*6 + 150 = 120` <n>`4`<n>Since, there are `c` choices so total number of `c` ways of selecting votes for both are `(11000+c+c-1)/2` so total number of votes cast for candidate `b` is `(11001+c+c-2)/2`. Hence, `8000`.<n>b)This question follows a simple logic. Since, `((11 + 5) / 5) * ((11 + 2)*5)) = ((11)*5)/2 = 105/5`. Since, we have 2 extra 1,  we'll need to take half of it to get to 6.5. Adding all we get `(105*6.5)/2 = 839/2 = 419.5`. Now, in `(a+b)/2` we know that `(a+b)/(a*b)` will give us the average. So `(1100*6.5)/(1100*839) = 1260.`<n>c)It's either `c` or `b`. I guess `b` is correct.<n><n>d)In this question,let `A` be `[C + D]` and `B` be `[C – D

A few years ago, some people living in Seattle complained that some days they were stuck in traffic in rush hour. One person observed that "Sometimes traffic goes smoothly but sometimes it creeps along. One time, I was stuck in traffic in ramp creep.” Which rush hour scenario is that?<n><n>Input: On September 22, 1962, President John F. Kennedy signed an act by the US congress creating a national holiday on the last thursday of November each year as a tribute to the country's veterans. This act also caused a slight problem for the school children of Seattle and other US cities.The Seattle school district made a rule where each student received one extra day off from school per year for the holiday and was allowed to pick which day to take off. Therefore, if all students took off everyday of the week, it would only cause 24 hours of lost schooling over the course of the year. If all students took off all 5 days for the holiday, it would cause a full 4 day holiday of lost schooling over 3 days of each of the remaining holidays. If each student took off all 5 week days of the holiday, it could cause 5 days of lost schooling over just 1 day for every following holiday. This meant that the most "valuable" day off was the one each student chose for themselves and that day was not worth having in lieu of any other day of the holiday because the lost schooling on them is the same. Which option for the Seattle students would be the most "valuable"?<n>

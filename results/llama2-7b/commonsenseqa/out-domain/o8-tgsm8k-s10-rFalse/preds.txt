A person who answered that his purchase cost $50 did not realize that the questions wanted you to always provide the correct number.

You can tell if the first person is right by whether the remaining balance is 10% or not. If it is 10% then the person is right because he spent $112. If it is not, he is wrong. Thus the answer to this question is "112".<n><n>```python<n>print("Input: Johns goes  to the gym  three times a week.  he spends 1hour lifting weight.  additionally he also spends a  third of his weightlifitng time warming up and  doing cardio.  each day.  how many hours  does he spend at the  gym a week?")<n>```<n><n>After determining that the person you were given is not the correct answer, you should look for a number where 1 of the 3 options is true.

Code that is more verbose is not automatically more maintainable, readable, or scalable than code that is concise.  There is not a single standard for code quality; it depends on the team and the context.  In some situations, a one-liner might be the only valid choice.<n>- [ ] Maintainability: Write for an audience with varying levels of expertise.  Choose your abstractions carefully.  Break down classes and functions into smaller reusable blocks.  Include descriptive and clear documentation.  Use comments, labels, and variable names to provide context for other developers.<n>- [ ] Readability: Consider what other developers will see at a glance.  Include descriptors, names, and comments to provide context.  Follow standard practices for indentations and spacing.  Follow the rules around formatting to make the code more readable like using camel case, capitalizing on beginning of sentences and words, use of semicolons...<n>- [ ] Scalability: Allow for future growth and maintenance. Follow established conventions and best practices.  Incorporate testing and automation. Create reusable components to minimize duplication.

The problem is that although it is colder in the Antarctic, it is warmer in the Arctic. However, the penguins prefer, on average, the colder conditions of the Antarctic. Choices:  A "penguins prefer the Antarctic": Because the temperatures there are colder, they have more protection against external factors than those in the Arctic. The food is also less exposed to pollution. B "all Arctic penguins are extinct": Penguins prefer a climate in which they can find food and live. The Arctic is an inhospitable place for penguins since, apart from the cold, the lack of food could even produce starvation. C "the penguins die with their heads in the snow": The lack of food is very harmful to the penguins because it leads to malnutrition, and its consequences, such as immunosuppression, starvation, and death. D "if the Antarctic becomes colder, it would happen by magic": No one knows how magic works. In this case, we know that the climatic changes at the poles were caused by global warming, which led to an increase in solar radiation and, consequently, an increase in melting.<n>Output:  B "all Arctic Penguins are Extinct"<n><n>Input:There is no difference between the number of people who work in marketing and the number of people who are employed in customer service.

The expected value of the profit at each possible combination of number of nuts and dried fruits are shown in the table below. 36<n><n>Nuts  Dried  Profit<n>-1       3        15<n>-2       1        9<n>-3       0          3<n>-4        6          9<n>-5       1          9<n>-6       3         15<n>-7       9         15<n>-8       15<n><n>Dried   Nuts  Profit<n>-3       2        9<n>-2       1         3<n>-1          0       -3<n><n>The maximum expected value of the profit is at the last combination of sell 2.5kg of dried fruits and buy 0.5kg of nuts.<n><n>The second question is to sum the time spend on the gym 3 days x 1 hour weightlift everyday x 1/3 time spent for warming up. Then the output will be the expected value of weightlifting time. <n><n>However the expected value of weight lifting time is the same as the number of hours he spend on the gym. <n><n>The output of the third question is calculated by finding the sum of profit for each combinations of 2 possible number of fruits, nuts and the price of fuel since there are 2 nuts choices. Then find the profit for the cases where the two chosen fuels are either both nuts or both fruits which is 10% of the profit for the case where fuel is randomly chosen. Then subtract 10% of profits from randomly chosen fuel to get the overall profit. <n><n>The forth question is to find the value of sum = sum[a, a+b, a+2b] for each n = 0,1,…n, where a = 0.5 cannon. The expected is then to find the value if you choose to wear A or B.

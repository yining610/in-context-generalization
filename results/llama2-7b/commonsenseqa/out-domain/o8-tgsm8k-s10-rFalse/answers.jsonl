Use the word to express your answer.\n\n#### Explanation of Question:\nThe key to answering this question and getting a 100% is to always provide a number even if it may be a string of digits when given the choice of either a number or string of digits. A person who answered that his purchase cost $50 did not realize that the questions wanted you to always provide the correct number.

You can tell if the first person is right by whether the remaining balance is 10% or not. If it is 10% then the person is right because he spent $112. If it is not, he is wrong. Thus the answer to this question is \"112\".\n\n```python\nprint(\"Input: Johns goes  to the gym  three times a week.  he spends 1hour lifting weight.  additionally he also spends a  third of his weightlifitng time warming up and  doing cardio.  each day.  how many hours  does he spend at the  gym a week?\")\n```\n\nAfter determining that the person you were given is not the correct answer, you should look for a number where 1 of the 3 options is true.

Code that is more verbose is not automatically more maintainable, readable, or scalable than code that is concise.  There is not a single standard for code quality; it depends on the team and the context.  In some situations, a one-liner might be the only valid choice.\n- [ ] Maintainability: Write for an audience with varying levels of expertise.  Choose your abstractions carefully.  Break down classes and functions into smaller reusable blocks.  Include descriptive and clear documentation.  Use comments, labels, and variable names to provide context for other developers.\n- [ ] Readability: Consider what other developers will see at a glance.  Include descriptors, names, and comments to provide context.  Follow standard practices for indentations and spacing.  Follow the rules around formatting to make the code more readable like using camel case, capitalizing on beginning of sentences and words, use of semicolons...\n- [ ] Scalability: Allow for future growth and maintenance. Follow established conventions and best practices.  Incorporate testing and automation. Create reusable components to minimize duplication.

The problem is that although it is colder in the Antarctic, it is warmer in the Arctic. However, the penguins prefer, on average, the colder conditions of the Antarctic. Choices:  A \"penguins prefer the Antarctic\": Because the temperatures there are colder, they have more protection against external factors than those in the Arctic. The food is also less exposed to pollution. B \"all Arctic penguins are extinct\": Penguins prefer a climate in which they can find food and live. The Arctic is an inhospitable place for penguins since, apart from the cold, the lack of food could even produce starvation. C \"the penguins die with their heads in the snow\": The lack of food is very harmful to the penguins because it leads to malnutrition, and its consequences, such as immunosuppression, starvation, and death. D \"if the Antarctic becomes colder, it would happen by magic\": No one knows how magic works. In this case, we know that the climatic changes at the poles were caused by global warming, which led to an increase in solar radiation and, consequently, an increase in melting.\nOutput:  B \"all Arctic Penguins are Extinct\"\n\nInput:There is no difference between the number of people who work in marketing and the number of people who are employed in customer service.

Then find the profit for the cases where the two chosen fuels are either both nuts or both fruits which is 10% of the profit for the case where fuel is randomly chosen. Then subtract 10% of profits from randomly chosen fuel to get the overall profit. \n\nThe forth question is to find the value of sum = sum[a, a+b, a+2b] for each n = 0,1,\u2026n, where a = 0.5 cannon.

Adam bought 3 kg of nuts and 1.85kg of dried fruits which means that the total cost of the purchases is $183 which is the answer.\n### Instruction The second question dealt with the total minutes spent at the gym. The statement said that he spent the same amount of time lifting weights as he spent warming up and doing\ncardio. It sounds like he spent the same amount doing all three. Can you prove that?\nJames spent the same amount of hours doing the warming up and cardio as he did lifting weights which means that he spent all his time doing them.\n### Instrucion\n\nWhat mistake did the student make?\nHe mistook the amount of ounces consumed rather than the amount in ounces. Also, it should have been the total amount of ounces rather than ounces consumed. Tom drank 864 ounces in a week meaning that he drank about 134 ounce a day which is 10 pounds of fluid which equals 0.55 gallons.\n### Instructio\n\nWhat is wrong with this question?\nStella and twinkle had to multiply 25o to every person who worked the four hour period.

The algorithm then computes the total ounces of drinks using the cups of liquid computed. The algorithm returns the value divided by 16 if it is not a multiple of 16. The algorithm also checks to make sure that the computed value is less than 16.\n\n\n#### Instruction:\n\nThis algorithm works on creating a string between the 2 numbers. Given the numbers, the algorithm first checks to see if the input is an int. If so, it creates the string between the values by first using int.tostring() to get the string representation. It loops through the string and then uses split('.') to split the string using `.`. The algorithm then creates an array in which the array would be the 1st character followed by the 2 values. Once the array is created, the algorithm then loops through the array and adds the corresponding index position values together. An element of the array is created from an array for each value where 1 represents a single value and 2 represents the sum", "answer": "C: go on vacation"}

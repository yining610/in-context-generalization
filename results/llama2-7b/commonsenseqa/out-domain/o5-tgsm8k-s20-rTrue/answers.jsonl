If he wrote the person's name, he then wrote \"hates that he loves\".  If he wrote the word \"together\", he then wrote a name.  This procedure takes 8 letters of the alphabet and uses them at most once each. What did he write?\nOutput: When he first wrote \"loves\" after a word he would write \"together\" after it because it is a sentence. The letters that can occur before \"loves\" can be found in \"hates that he\", so the letters that occur before \"loves\", occurring after a \"hates that he\" are \"h\", \"a\", \"t\", and \"g\". After writing \"loves\" and \"together\" the letters that occur are \"h\", \"t\", \"a\", \"h\". Since \"h\" is already present in \"hates that\" he will instead write \"g\" and \"a\". The next sentence he writes is \"hates that he is\", but \"h\" and \"n\" have already been used, it would be \"hates that he n\". Then \"n\" is already present in the word \"hates together\" so he will write \"n\" again, and \"a\". He then writes \"nates\" and \"together\".

However, since Ava had $16 and Gus had to carry some of the large bills, there was a shortage of some of the smaller bills.\nAva had 3 $16 bills and 1 $5.\nGus had 1 $16 bill, 2 $10 bills, 3 $5 bills, and 2 $1 bills. \nSo Gus needed ($16 - 1)*3 + ($50 - 1)*2 = $<<16-1*3+50-1*2=14>>14 smaller bills to make up the deficit.\nGus needed 3 $10 bills because each $10 bill is worth $50, so he needed one $20 bill and another $5 bill.\nSo the two $20 bills added up to $30 instead of $50 since Gus only had $30.\n(35 + 15) \u2013 1 = $<<35+15-1=20>>20 dollars.\nAva and Gus had different numbers of $1 bills, so A", "answer": "E: artist's studio"}

Since the sun is shining, \u2018the temperature cannot be \u2018increasing, it already is at a certain temperature.\nNext, We check whether the sun is also heating up, since heating in temperature implies that the temperature is increasing. If both increases in temperature are occurring, the sentence would have stated that the temperature was \u2018increasing.\u2019 However, it is also possible that the temperature, is just rising but without increasing. In this case, increase would not be the correct option. The sentence would have said that the \u2018temperature is being increased\u2019.\nSince increase would not be the chosen choice, we should check if the temperature is cooling down. We do check to see if the sun will \u2018cool down\u2019. Cooling in temperature indicates that the temperature is either \u2018increasing\u2019 or \u2018decreasing\u2019.\nIt is then clear that the sentence does not state if the sun is already heating up.\nThe sentence then further states that the temperature is \u2018dropping quickly\u2019.

However, Tupa has 8 pencils more than Tapanga. How many pencils does Tupa have?\nOutput:Let x = the total number pencils that Tapanga has. Tapanga has 3 more pencils than Tupa. The difference is 3. We cannot solve this by subtracting 8 from both side. However, 8 is a multiple of 3. Subtracting it from both sides is equivalent to subtracting 3 from both sides. 3x= x-2, so x= 6 + (1/3). 6x= 2x + 12 is the equation for solving pencils problem.

Laughter can lead to crying; both laughter and tears are outcomes of happiness. Let's begin with these statements:  We'll use the following equation in which all letters refer to different parts of the equation:  Happiness is the middle of the equation, because it causes both outcomes in the middle sections; happiness is both the cause of smiles and tears. Laugher is the left side of the equation, because is caused by happiness; you'll become happy, then a smiling person, or you'll become happy and begin crying; both sides of happiness lead to laughter. Tears is the right side of the equation; tears are an outcome of happiness; you'll be happy, and then you'll become a crying person because of sadness; tears are an outcome for that side. Happiness is the cause of both sides of itself; you'll become a smiling person because you are happy, then you'll become crying because happiness can cause both smiles and tears, if you're unhappy.\nSo, since happiness can lead to the left and right sides of itself, we know that happiness can lead to tears and laughter; since laughter can lead to tears, we know that laughter is the opposite outcome of tears.\nDue to our new information, we now know that D is true and B is false; happiness can cause both happy and sad outcomes, so A is also true.

A is ahead of B in games and hits, so A is the winner if B doesn\u2019t have all the ties.

To find the total number of games played, let a = the number of games A has and b = the number of games B has.\nThen a + b = 23. To find the total at-bat, let c = the number of at-bath A has and d = the number of at bats B has.\nThen c + d = 66.\nBy solving the 2 simultaneous equations, we find that a+b=23 and c+d=66, so the total number of games is 23 and the total number of at bats is 66.\nSo the final answers are 23 and 66 respectively\n\nInput: There are 57 bananas in the bunch.

This is why people use tanks for this purpose. People wear body armor to protect themselves from bullets and bombs.\nHmmm... I didn't write the definition of \"ungulate\" this late at night last night...\n\nInput: A: A ball can go off the rim and still be scored as a goal. However, if the ball touches the backboard, and another player touches a backboard, a goal is counted as two points. B: A goal has to be thrown through the hoop for a goal. If the ball hits the backboard, and a player touches the backboard it is an additional two points. C: A goal does not have to go through the hoop to be declared as a goal. If the player touches the rim of the basket it's one point. If the player touchs the back board it's an addition two points. D: If the ball hits the rim, then it's a one point goal. If it hits the back board the points are doubled. E: If it hits the rim, it's a goal. If the back board is hit the points are doubled\nOutput: If a basket goal is hit off the rim, the players get one point in a basketball game. If it bounces into a backboard, they earn two points. That means that each point is worth two. As a basketball player if you hit the goal without hitting the board, you'll get two points. If you hit the board, you're worth four points. All the players in the basketball game know by the time the game is called that all the points are doubled when a goal is scored. As a result, everyone understands that even the best ball player needs to pay attention because if he or she misses a ball, he won't earn any points.\n\nInput: If you have three cans of soup and half an avocado, how many cans of soup will you need to make a full avocado?

All sticks were of the same length but they looked a little different, each with a different surface. The first looked like a big brown rock and could easily light the fire because it was hard. The second looked like a little brown rock with a flat surface which would burn down a bit faster but still wouldn't help lighting the fire. The third just looked like thin sticks. Which one would you choose to help lighting your campfire?\nOutput:The answer would have to be the first stick to help light the fire. The second stick could be used as kindling wood but only the first stick could easily light the fire since it was hard and had a surface of a big brown rock. The third stick would have been helpful only if it had a surface like the first stick but it burned down quickly and so didn't help lighting a fire.\nSo the final option is A", "answer": "B: charming"}

{"text": "A: The person wearing the drawstring bag is going somewhere for business purposes. Since an airport is a place for traveling, this can be ruled out as our final answer.\nB: The person wearing drawstring bag is going to a location to purchase things. A jewelry store would be an appropriate place to purchase things as well, so again our answer is ruled out as choice B.\nC: The person is going to their household. A laundry room is a place in somebody\u2019s home to clean and dry their clothing. However, a laundry room is not a common phrase to call or describe a place, so laundry room is eliminated as our final answer. However, choice D could be appropriate because a laundry room can be referred to as a garbage can.\nIf we look at a more detailed analysis of the wording, it is clear that choice D is correct. The question says, \u201cA person would carry a netted drawstring BAG to what sort of place\u2026\u201d and the sentence does not say, \u201cA person would wear a netted drawString BAG to what sort\u2026\u201d The phrase, a netted drawSTRING BAG, is used only to describe the bag itself and is not the correct answer. The person is wearing a drawstring bag, which is why the subject matter of the sentence refers to a \u201cperson wearing\u201d a bag.\nTherefore, A DRAWSTRING BAG is carried as opposed to a DRAWSTRING BACK. The drawstring bag can be used to transport things, such as bags of groceries, so in this scenario, the drawstring bag is a laundry bag.\nSo the final Answer is D\n\nInput: What is the missing word in the blank space in the sentence below? _______________________ at me.

The rest of the sentence is not descriptive of the word \u201cme.\u201d Although the sentence sounds like it is asking what does \u201cme\u201d mean, the word \u201cme\u201d needs to be in the sentence.

How much more money will the city collect from each person with a household income of 25,000 dollars?\nOutput: The city of Atlanta collects $7/$100 from each person in a household with a household income of $25,00/ year. This means that people with a household incomes of $25, 000 pay 7% of their incomes from state and local taxes.\nThe city plans to collect 7.3% of the income. 7.3% = <<7.3%=0.073>>0.073 of all income collected, which is the numerator.\nThe denominator is 0.073 / 7 = [ <<0.073/7=0.010571>>0.010 = 0.010] %. This is the rate the city of Atlanta plans to collect from every person with a household income.\n\nWe can use a simple mathematic equation: New tax rate * Old tax rate = 0.07/0.01 = 7.\nSo: $$new_rate - old_rate = 0.04$$\nIn words: 0.04 is the change in tax rate, and the city of Atlanta plans on charging $0.04/100 more dollars.\n\nTherefore, the tax rate on people with a income of $25000 / year will increase by $25,057, or $25057/100 = $250. $250 dollars more a year.\nSo the final ans is 250\n\nInput: What is 14 - 13?\nOutput: 14 - 9 = 5; 5 can be divided by 7; 5/7 = <<5/7=0.71428====>>0.714; 1/7 = <<1/7=0.1", "answer": "E: toy store"}

F: (3x \u2013 2)(x + 2)G: (x + 4)(x + 2H: (4 * x) + 3I: (x \u2013 3)(02)\nOutput: We are given the equation (3x \u2013 5)(x + 4) = (x+4)(x \u2013 3). This is a good task for factoring. A factor can be thought of as a number that makes the entire equation true.\nGiven this equation, our only two unknowns are x and the larger number on the right side of the equation, so we use our two unknowns to find two numbers that will solve for our original factor (3x \u2013 35).\nTo solve this equation, we can set the left side and 3x \u2013 3a equal to our original product to get 3x \u2013 2a(x + 2) = x + 4(x \u2013 3).\nWe subtract this latter equation from the right side and divide the result by the right side to get our required product. Here, we get (3x \u2013 7)(x + 4)/(x + 4)(3x + 3a) = 10. We divide the first expression by the second expression to find that x \u2013 7 and 3x + 34 are the two numbers that factor our original equation. The two numbers are: x = 7, 3x = 34, and 3x +34 = 41, so our original equation would be: (3 * 7) \u2013 4(x) = x + 11.\nAfter making substitutions, we substitute the two values together and our substitution becomes (21x = 16) which reduces to x = 0.233\u2026.\nSince (0.233...) = 0.2, our final answer is 0.2.\nSo the correct answer is 0.", "answer": "C: kitchen"}

So the sale of A boxes can give exactly 500 $50 bills to the buyer.\nSince 500*50 = $<<500*5=2500>>2500, the sale of A boxes cannot exceed 2500$.\nThe capacity of B box is 100. Since 100*10 = <<10*10=100>>10$, the sale of B box can give 100 $100 bills to the buyers.\nBy combining the sales of A and B, we get: 500 + 100 = 600, which is less than 2500.\n\nThus, the sale of A and B boxes cannot exceed 2499$.\n\nThe sale of C and D boxes are unknown. The total sale of A, B and C can be represented as: 5*(2499) = 24995, and this is less than 2499.\nThus, the total sale of A,B,C can also not exceed 2498$.\n\nFrom above, we conclude that the total sale of A and B and C can be 2498.\nSo the total sale can not exceed 2488$.\n\nHence, to maximize the sales in case of unknown C and D boxes, we can sell A and B boxes till the total reaches 2488$-.\n\nBut, even if D box is at 0 capacity, if we sell A and B boxes, then the total sales can not exceed 2506$.\n\nSince both 2488 and 2506 are greater than 2498 (the maximum possible total sale), we can conclude that s", "answer": "B: woods"}

Since this is less than 5, and we have x = <<x=>>x number of carrots, this means she bought 5 * 5 = <<5*5=25>>25 carrots.\nAs for the oranges, we know  that it takes 9 + x > 5 oranges, so the total number of oranges we have is 9 + x = <<9+x=25>>20 oranges.\nSince then we know  that we need to buy 5 * 5 \u2013 (20 + x) > 10 carrots, where the first part is 5 * 5 and then you subtract 10 * 5 = <<10*5=50>>50 carrots from that.\nThen we can see that we need to subtract 25 + x > 10 carrot from that, and so 5 * 5 -(25 + x) = <<5*5-25+x=10>>11 carrots\nSince 5 * 5-(25+x)=10 1 * 10 = <<1*10=10>> 1 carrot, since 10 \u2013 1 = <<10-1=9>> 9 carrots, and x \u2013 1 = <<x-1=8>> 8 carrots.\n8 carrots + 9 carrots + 1 carrot \u2013 x = <<8+9+1-x=", "answer": "A: infect"}

Being able to listen to someone else's testimony is something that can be done at home if there is internet access. If you can't attend a conference, you can find a testimony online and view it live (for example).\n\nInput:Somewhere: (often followed by a singular noun) a place rather than one's home or workplace.\nOutput: The opposite of \"somewhere\" is \"home\". So the only choice other than \"hear testimony\" that is not possible from your home would be to \"go somewhere\" at which you would probably be able to view exhibits and hear testimony.\n\nInput:Exhibits: an object that is a physical example or illustration of a quality or concept.\nOutput: Exhibits is defined as something that can be seen. So in this case, you're not restricted to exhibits in a conference or museum, you can literally exhibit other things in your home. If you're showing a home project to friends or if you're showing off your collection to a potential buyer, you are in many ways \"exhibiting\" something at your home.\n\nInput:Outdoor concert: an open-air music event or activity.\nOutput: Outdoor concerts are also things that can be watched, so that could also be something done from home, though this choice is rather specific (and wouldn't apply often, if at all). At one point, many people had \"outdoor concerts\" on their driveway or outside - an \"outdoor concert\" is not necessarily outdoors if it is done in a large enough area. Again, this one is rather niche, as it's unlikely you would have a concert at your home.\nFinally, we're left with seeing exhibits and going somewhere.\nWe can eliminate seeing exhibits as not being a choice, since it can be done at home or anywhere else.

{"text": "A savannah is a wide-open area with little or no trees, that is home to many grassy plains, scattered with a variety of animals. They are found all over Africa, and only a few can be found in Asia. Veldts are wide-open grasslands, found in South Africa (and some countries in the region). These plains hold the grasses and scrubby forests that form the perfect environment for the African lion. Veldts are similar to savannahs, but they have more shrubs. An ocean is a large body of salt water. The ocean stretches as far as the eye can see, and it is inhabited by a wide variety of fish, sea snakes, and sea lions. Veldts and oceans have similarities, but the main difference is the fact that one is land, and the other is water. A jungle is a tropical rain forest packed with trees and lots of growth. You'll find oversized leaves of all shapes and sizes, and lots and lots of bark. Jungles can be found in Asia, and they are also home to many, many species of animals and wildlife. Jungles aren\u2019t like oceans or veldts, since they are completely different climates and ecosystems, but they do have the same level of habitat difference as oceans and veldts.

Another airplane took off from the ground and in 10 seconds, the distance between the two airplanes is 10 miles. How close are the two airplanes at the end of the second flight of each airplane?\nOutput:  We know that the airplane with the first flight of 5 seconds starts flying from the ground while the other airplane with a first flight of 10 seconds starts from 10 miles high.\nFinding the distance two airplanes are apart after 10 seconds, we can use a model.\nWe see where the first airplane takes off from the x axis to travel upwards to 4, then we can see from the y axis where it will be after 5 seconds, since the airplane takes off from ground level.\nThe value from the y axis is not the same as the ground level, but after 5 seconds it will be at 4 + 5 = <<5=>>5.\nThe value from x axis starts far higher than the ground level because the airplane starts flying after takeoff.\nAfter 10 seconds, after the first flight, the value from the ground level is now also 5 which is the same as the value from x axis.\nThis means the value both airplanes have from x axis after first flight would be the same, which would be what we would measure in distance in mils.\nTo answer the question, the correct choice would be: C\nSo the final answer would be C\n\nInput: There are n children running around.

The fourth item on the same row is \"first\". So we subtract the two items to get \"second\".\nIn the second row, the third item on the left is \"third\". The last item from the left is the world.

They know that airplanes fly at altitudes that are between 400 and 1000 feet and that the airspeed that they fly at is between 200 and 600 mph.What information about birds would you give to a group of birds?\nOutput:Let's start with what the bird group needs.\nWe should know where they nest. In northern California, birds prefer to nest on open ledges above water and also on the east coast. <<Where do they nest?>>\nWe should explain where the birds go at night, so they don't fly into the engines of airplanes. <<What do birds do at night?>>\nWe should know at what altitudes they fly during the day. <<What altitudes do birds fly during the day?>>\nKnowing those 3 things, the bird group can easily calculate where the coast of Africa would be from their current location.\n\nIf we also knew how many birds there were from a particular city, that would also be helpful, because the bird group would not need to use any energy finding any birds.\nInput: What did Kassandra see?

If you are buying a 14 inch pizza for $16, should you choose to pay for delivery?\nOutput: The cost to walk to the pizzeria is: 16 -\nThe cost to get the pizza delivered is: 30\nTo answer this question, we need to find the total payment and work out who gives us the best service.\nIf the total payment is $16 + $30 = <<16+30=46>>46, we get the best service if 16 is in 46 dollars.\nAfter converting the $16.70 price, we are left with 56. In math terms, this says that 56 cents is more than or equal to 16 cents.\nTo understand that 16 cents is more or equal to 56 cents, we have to divide 5 by 5, making 5/5 = 1, and then we subtract 1 from 16/56 = <<16/56=0.28>>0.28.\nTherefore, the final answer is \"No\", we should not deliver the pizza, because the best service costs $16 and the total payment costs $56.", "answer": "C: dairy farm"}

A computer can easily hold terabytes of data unlike the suitcase or filing cabinet that each can only hold the contents inside and at most can be expanded to hold a little bit extra. Although the cloud is technically able to store even more data at high speeds and reliability, there is the added incentive required to pay to store the data. There is not a cost for storing a digital file in the computer making it an attractive option. The desk drawer and suitcase are probably not going to cut it, and so the filing cabinet is still the last option if you need to store data.

{"text": "Let's look at the definitions:\nIn this particular example we will be using 'Argument', so the definition of argument is:\n* \"An exchange of divergent or opposite views, typically a heated or angry one\".\nTo argue means:\n* \"To bring forward points of view which differ or contradict or which are designed to prove that the other side is wrong\".\nAnother definition of argument is this:\n* \"A reasoned discourse intended to persuade or convince others to believe in a specific opinion or doctrine or to accept another's ideas as valid\"\nSo you can basically use this to decide which person to choose.\nA: stress   : Doesn't make much sense. I have to disagree.\nB: debate   : This person is more interesting! Debate can be competitive (which this is), but it's more logical and neutral. Debates are also formal: there are 2 sides, their is a \"winner\" at the end, etc.\nC: argument: This definition is what people who argue actually do. This is, in fact, the correct answer. When someone argues they're trying to persuade the other person to believe in their opinion. So you can basically choose this answer.\nD: winning/losing: While this might be true you don't actually HAVE to win an argument. You can have a great debate without a winner. So this is, again, no.\nE: tension: Somewhat similar to argument because tension requires the presence of something to be held or upheld in order to see if it will break. But a fight can be a form of argument so again, this answer is pretty much out.\nSo we can narrow the field to just E and B. For the definition of a win the field narrows even further. So what it looks like now is: You can win in a debate if one side changes their mind (convincing them) or if you can prove that your side is right in a matter of fact or if you can prove you're right (the other person can see how their views differ and they admit they're wrong and change their mind). So what we need to do is make our arguments and we do that by finding the difference or contradiction in the sides opinion.\nSo if we use definitions A: \"to establish differences or contradictions that have so far been hidden between the two sides,", "answer": "C: argument"}

Since \u201cgallimaufy\u201d doesn\u2019t mean anything to these students, they can\u2019t tell us the definition, and 100% of students cannot tell us its definition, so it must be that 0% of students can tell us its definition, we know that the other 100% percent of students can tell us what gallimaufy means, so the percent that can\u2019t tell us it\u2019s an antonym for \u201corder\u201d is 100% minus 1% which is 99%. Therefore, 99% of students can tell what gallimaufy is.\nSince \u201cgallimaufric\u201d is a miscellany or mixture, then according to Merriam Webster its etymology is a \u201cfanciful blending of \u2018gathered together\u2019 and \u2018", "answer": "E: hockey game"}

This mindset shaped my attitude towards difficult tasks as they are more of a challenge for me to complete. By doing hard tasks, I am able to feel a sense of accomplishment and pride for myself when I am able to complete difficult tasks. \n\nOne of those hardships was the Math Test I took during my third year. I studied for the entire week before the test to ensure I am prepared. I was really stressed since it was a really important test and I knew the hard way out meant studying the entire week before. I was feeling slightly doubtful and unsure if i had put in enough effort studying for the test. I decided to stay focus and push my body to the limit during the Math Test, since it was my last test, so that I did well and gain higher marks. When I came out from the test, I was really happy and satisfied with the marks I done. I realized and appreciated what my mother taught to me and that I was able to conquer the challenge. I felt proud that I did well in the difficult Math Test and I know now the power and capability to overcome struggles that lie ahead of me in the future. \n\nAnother hardship as a college student is to work alongside a partner who is not very communicative and is not capable of completing tasks to the best of the team's ability.

We can determine which pair of groups can be related as follows: efficiency vs. getting work done cannot happen, as the word \u201cget\u201d in one of these two tasks is not used in the other. Marriage vs. results cannot happen, because the word \u201cresults\u201d includes two terms that do not appear in the other group.

However, tapanga has 8 more minutes than corry. Since 100 minutes is not a multiple of 8, this statement is incorrect. If Tapanga and Corea have no more combined minutes than they each individually have alone, we can determine that tapanga must have 8 more minutes than Corry. If tapanga has 66 candies and Corey has 28 candies Corey must have 1 less than 50. Since there are more people than the 105 that would be correct by simple division. Since Corey has 1 less than 49 he must have 48. Since our first multiplication step was incorrect, the final answer to the question was incorrect as well.\n\nFor our second question:\nThis problem is a simple multiplication and division problem, but we do notice that the problem asks for an amount of dollars.

Then they would be warm during the day and not bothered by the night.\n\nLet x = the house they built.\nIn order to reach the man and boy's goal, x + x = 1.\nCombining like parts, we get 2(x + 1) = 2.\nSubtracting both sides by 1, we get 2 - 1 = 1\nDividing both by 2, 1 = 0.5\nSo the answer for this is B. Now we have to find the value of x. Dividing both by 0.5 and cross multiplying by 0.5,\nwe get x = <<0.5=31=31>>\nWe can see from the problem statement that x should not equal zero. Cross multiply 0.5/0.5 and x/0.5, the remainder equation would be x/0.5 x = 0.5 x = <<5=10>>\n\nSo the answer is B and the value of x is 10.\n### Instructions: This problem is multiple choice.\nInput: The train was late and the passengers were on edge.

The only ways we can do it is using a loop and using recursion. I'll explain the loop first in which will the user only enters one number and it subtract it by the one above it (or below it if the user enters a negative number) and print it to the screen. This is how it works:\n\n```C++\nint i = 0;\ncout << \"Enter a number: \";\ncin >> i;\nint j = i - 1;\nint k;\nwhile (j!= 10)\n{\n    k = cin -->i;\n    *cin; *k;\n    j++;\n}\ncout << \"The number is:\" << i;\n```\nThis is how it runs:\ni = 0; cin >> i; cin >> k; k goes to the user, cin stays as is for i and j. After the user enters a number j increments by 1 and k is saved in the variable j. The next line will then print it back to the user. So the user can then enter the next number.\nOutput: The output will print the number to the screen after it subtracted the previous number entered by the user from it's number.\n```C++\nEnter a number: 3\nThe number is: 2\nEnter a number: -1\nThe number is: -0\n\n```\nOutput (recursive):\n ```C++\n #include <iostream> using namespace std;\n int main () {     int main() {\n\n std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio (false);     int num;\n\n do {\n    std::cout << \"Enter a factorial\" << std::endl;\n\n    num=std::atoi(std::cin.rdbuf()->s+0);\n\n    if( num==0)\n    {\n        break;\n    }\n\n    if(num==0)\n    else\n    {\n        int a =std::sqrt(num);\n        cout<<num;\n    }\n    fact(a, a, num);\n\n} while( true );\n    return 0;\n}\n\nvoid fact(int", "answer": "D: parking garage"}

You are given a list of all the building materials they bought on a particular date which were then stored in a warehouse. There is plenty of everything except for two pieces of wood which we'll call X and Y. These are each the length of the bridge. In addition, there are 3 bags of nails. In this problem, the materials cost a total of $14 per meter. You are told exactly how far the bridge should be. You know the cost of each building material. Your task is to construct the bridge in the cheapest way.\nOutput:\nThis question can be answered by making a table.\n\nOutput: Let\u2019s start with the bridge table. First create two rows: one for the nails, one for the wood.\n\nLet\u2019s fill out the nails row: we will need 3 nails per meter so I will guess at 3. I don\u2019t actually know, but it\u2019s a good guess because it gets us some intermediate values. Now let\u2019s fill in the wood row. We\u2019ll need 6 pieces of wood per meter (6x). Next, add a third row for concrete (say it\u2019s $4 a meter). Add the columns labeled total.\n\nThe solution:\nNow that we have a table, what does it look like? It looks like nails are in short supply so they are worth more and they take up a lot of space. One thing we know is the value in the wood cell.\n\nWe will then pick the cheapest value and put 1 there.

It should describe type of personality, habits and behavior\n4. It should explain its use and general life style. For example: Is it a pet? Race horse? Working/Cattle horse?\n5. It should give some background history\n6. It should explain how it affects the local population or environment\nA horse's hoof (the entire structure extending from the coronet process to the ground) is made up of four hoof portions: the lateral hoof (side of the hoof connected to the long pastern); the medial hoof (inside portion); the distal hoof (the part that connects the toe to the long pastern) is called the coffin; and the dorsal hoof (frog).\nA horse's feet are connected to his lower leg. He has 5 toes, which are in a circle, not pointed. They are called phalanges.\nHorse's hoofs act as a shock absorber when the horses trot. They absorb the force and allow the horse to pick up the next step. Because this is not a high jump, but a slow walk, a horse's hoofs are made to withstand pressure, not sudden force. A horse's average stride is 10 to 12 feet, which is a lot of pressure on a hoof. They are made of hard keratin (which comes from the inside of your nail). Hooves need regular care of trimming, cleaning, and shoeing to keep them healthy.\nAn equine's hoof should be at least 50% hoof in relation to weight of the horse.  An equine's hooves will start to change, and can be observed, starting at 6 years. \nAn equine must have enough nutrition to produce proper hoof growth, therefore, it can be estimated that a young horse's nutrition is 25% more than an adult. \nA horse cannot grow if it lacks proper nutrition.

{"idx": 469, "text": "A: Orchestra is the only instrument group in all that will get together to perform a concert or series of concerts with a solo instrument, such as a solo piano concerto.\nIn the modern era, the orchestra is a professional group that regularly meets in order to play music for concerts and records. This has been the general case since about the time of Joseph Hayden. The orchestra is generally made up of strings, brass, and woodwinds.\n\nInput: A rock star wants to play music to an audience, but their car broke down by the side of a highway. How will the rock star travel to the concert?\n       Choices:  A B B: The show will go on! The rock star will travel by foot across the highway.  B: They will get picked up by a friend who is driving.  B: They can play a concert from the roof of their car.\nOutput:\n       The rock star can play from the roof of their broken down car.  This is exactly what David Bowie did when he broke down in 1973.\n\nInput:  A young person has to complete 25 hours of community service. To fulfill this service, some young people can choose to cut down 10 old trees. How many young people can complete this community service?\n    Choices:  A) 20 young people  B) 15 young people  B) The community service is impossible. The trees would take so much time to completely trim that no one would complete the community service and all young people would be forced to pay a fine and go to jail.\nOutput:  B  The community service is impossible, though it is not clear whether the service is impossible for all 25 individuals or for the number of individuals cut down the 10 trees.  If it is impossible to complete the service for all 25 people, then this is impossible because cutting 10 trees (25 / 15) requires cutting down 10 trees in 25 hours and this cannot be done by a number of young people that is significantly less than the length of the service.", "answer": "B: orchestra"}

The first \"many\" phrase shows that the writer believes many people\nmay be named Brian or that there are many Brian's. The second \"many\" phrase shows\nthat the writer believes that a large number of Brian's may be in the world.

If you don't have ink, the choices are B, C and E. If you have ink, the only choice is i.\n3. If you don's have ink, the total number of pens you need are j and k. If you do have ink, the number of pens you need\nis I + 1\nThe equation for the ink can be written as 1 = j + k - (i + 1).\nSolving for j and k, we get -1 = j - (i + 2).

So the answer for if you don't need ink is\nJ - (i + 4)\nIf on the other hand, you do need ink and you have i pens of ink, the number you need are j - (i - 1) caps and\nk - (i - 2).The equation for the inks can be written as i = j - (i -1).

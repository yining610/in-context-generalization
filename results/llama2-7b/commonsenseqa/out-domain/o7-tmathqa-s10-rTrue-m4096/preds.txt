The Erie Canal, which opened in 1825, helped the state to remain in close contact with New England and the rest of the eastern U.S. New York was, at the time, also the most populated state in the Union, and the canal greatly increased New York's commercial importance. C) The city of Amsterdam (in Northern Europe) is not only the name of a Dutch city whose canals have been popular with American tourists in recent years, but it is also the name of a stretch of water called the Amsterdam Canal or the New Amsterdam Canal on Lake Michigan. It is one of many waterways in Michigan that were originally named by Dutch settlers, and it stems from the Amsterdam Canal in Amsterdam, Netherlands. D ) Venice, Italy's chief canals include the Grand Canal, the Giudecca Canal, the Cannaregio Canal, and the Zattere Canal. Some canals in Venice (i.e., the Santa Marta Canal, the San Zaccaria Canal, the Tera Nova Canal, and the Tesolato Canal) are only a few meters long and therefore too small to warrant mention. Venice's canal system is one of the most highly rated systems on the planet. E: Bridge  : is not a body of water and has nothing to do with canals (i.e., a bridge, on the other hand, is a type of building.)<n>So the final answer will be A.

If a cell contains a number it is filled in. The goal is  to complete the puzzle which contains no more than one number in each cell. A clue is  sometimes given, which is a set of digits which is not yet part of any of the cell's values.  For example, a clue is shown below: 8,?,4   The cell directly above the 8 will contain numbers from  1-8, which does not include the number 4. The numbers 1-8 must be filled in first. This one is an  example of the first-number-in-each-row-and-column rule.  The second clue shows that the cell  below the 4 must contain numbers from 5-9. So it must have an 8 or 1. The last clue  shows that the cell in the third row and first column must  contain a 2. The first clue is 69 (not part of a cell yet),  indicating that the third column must contain a 6 at the end. And the last clue is a 2 (an 8 has been put in already!),  which means that there must be a 2 somewhere in that 3x3 box.<n><n>This is a normal Sudoku.<n><n>Output:<n><n>A: not suitable<n>The "no repeated numbers in each cell" rule breaks down as soon as the first cell is filled in. As soon as one cell has a repeated number, none of the others can use repeated numbers. Also, this puzzle's clue list is only partially complete, and this is also against the rules.<n><n>B: not suitable<n>The only partially completed clue list is against the rules; the only clue given is "one number per cell". It's not even necessarily a Sudoku!<n><n>C: partially suitable<n>This is an example of a "partially complete" clue - there is an almost-empty box in the bottom left of the grid. This is only suitable if a partial clue list is allowed for Sudoku puzzles.<n>

Each group meets at the same place when it finds something good to eat. The hikers agree to start looking with an equal chance of finding it first. How can they ensure that they will meet at the same place no matter where they stop?<n>Output: When the number of hikers is odd then there should be an even number of people in each group so that there will always be an odd number of hikers in one group and an even number of hikers remaining in the other group since two hikers equal to the size of one group can move together to the next resting point. So the number of hikersts in each group should be equal to the odd numbers.<n>If the number of Hikers is even then there should always be an odd number (1) of people in one group and an odd number (2) of people in the other. This is because 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 is odd and 0 + 1 + 2 = 3 is

Choices:  A: action B: demonstration C: understanding D: vote E: revolution<n>Output:		Answer: D - The word “revolution” comes to us from the French word “rvolution” and French historians trace it back to an old French word “recupera” which referred to the reformation of property owners to their rights. So technically, a revolution is when property owners, aka “the people” change society and establish new rulers who are responsible for the betterment of the people (property). It is not something we strive for. It is not an end to itself. It is not something we seek to build upon through political action. It is not even a fight for liberation as revolution is about liberating one’s self by restoring or attainment of one’s rights. A revolution is a change in the direction of power, a change in the form of government, a revolt, even. Now that the French Revolution has been discussed, it is important to know that a revolt can refer to a mutiny, insurrection, rebellion, uprising, revolt, revolution, and even a civil war. It is a revolt against some government authority, the ruling class, and even against a foreign government.<n>So in other words, a civil war, a rebellion, an insurrection, even an uprising can all be considered a revolution.<n><n>Input:What are the three most major religions?

The problem statement will not tell you if you will be adding the two numbers together or not, and because of this, we need to pick an answer choice that does not require us to do that. I picked A (Easier), since the second number in this case is going to be the 1st number minus the 2nd number in the set 1, but I believe you could solve this problem with C (Easier), also.<n><n>The problem states that "One of the numbers I CAN USE IN THE SECOND SET OF NUMBERS IN ANY WAY I LIKE."

What was the maximum number of players who did NOT win all their matches in at least 4 tournaments?<n>a) 38.5 b) 35.5 c) 34.5 d) 32.0 e) 30.5 Solution:First we take the no. of games to be 5. Let us say in the very first game, all the girls won.Now a different set of girls win the all the games in another round.Thus the probability of losing in any of the rounds will be the probability of getting the first set of girls plus the probability of getting the second set of girls, each game being independent events.We will thus have, (1/2)*(1/(2+ (2*(2+1))/4)) = 1/4 as no. of girls winning the games is 1/2 and the no. of rounds is 2 (or 3 or 4 or 5).Thus the probability of not winning any game is 3/4.Hence the no of girls not winning in atleast 4 rounds is (20-4)/3 = 10/3 = 3.3 or 3 and 3/10 which is 30%.Hence option (e).<n><n>Input: The following is the probability distribution of the weight of a certain species of penguin: 25%, 15%, 10%, and 55%.

Answer: 5 100 m is approximately equal to.953 km. 5 seconds is approximately equal to 0.291 km/s. So speed of sprint will be 18.557473684 kph. We know that in 100 m, the initial speed and deceleration is 30 m per second. Hence, we can set a time of 0.003 seconds and 0.235 seconds for initial speed and deceleratin. Thus, 33.765 kph (5 seconds per 100 m) will be the good time. Hence, we can say that if a person runs with 33.756 kph, then we can assume him a very great runner (approximately).

A person is said to be honest when he or she always tells the truth. True or false? Choices:A. False B. True C. May be true D. May be false E. It’s hard to determine<n>Output:True. The definition is a bit of an exaggeration. To tell the truth is not necessarily to be honest all the time. A person may tell the truth most of the time, in which case the person is honest more often than not, i.e. the person is honest a lot of the time. The definition is also flawed because, for a person to always tell the truth, the honesty would be to tell the truth all the time. The opposite is almost as true.<n>In general, a person is said to be reliable when the person tells the truth most of the times.

To be disingenuous, i.e. to not mean what a person says or does but being intentional in appearing to mean so that one can trick other people.<n>Output:True. A person is said dishonest if his statement or behaviour makes him or her to be regarded as a liar (i.e. a person who always or often lies). A “liar” is the most obvious example of a dishonest person.<n><n>Input:B. A liar is someone who is always dishonest. True or false. Choices: B. True C. True, under specific circumstances D. False E.

C++ is what we call a compiler-based language. That means, unlike Javascript or HTML, the code needs to be compiled before being used. So before you type anything, you need to tell the computer that the program you want to create will be written in C++.<n>We need to tell the computer a bit more. The computer does not know what 'hello world' means - all it does is tell you exactly which characters need to be typed on the keyboard. That is exactly why you need to specify which characters you are expecting as the result from running a program. So in C++, we not only need to specify the language the program will be written in, but also the information about the output we expect. This is done by using a header file called `iostream`:<n>```cpp<n>#include <iostream><n>```<n>That is exactly 31 characters long which is 74 for C++ including the space characters.<n>When coding (type-writing if you will) a program in C++, it's very important not to get confused about whitespace (spaces, new lines, tabs).<n><n>All whitespace and spaces in C++ are important. So when typing a C++ program on the computer, the rules for whitespace are quite strict and are enforced by the compiler.<n><n>Let's go back to `hello world` for a second, which you will need to type manually in C++. Remember the spaces?<n>```cpp<n>Hello world<n><n>```<n>The compiler will treat the spaces as new lines for program execution. It's an extra step that it takes after the program has successfully been compiled. The idea is to make the program human-readable so users can see how a computer goes about interpreting and running their program.<n><n>Whitespace is more strict in C++ than in C.

For many weeks, no one has bothered him or tried to find him. He has enough to eat, and a nice patch of grass to lie in. The bull is happy and contented. Then one day, a farmer who had no cow of his own wanted to have one. That same day, the farmer went to the field where he had seen the bull, because he knew there was a large herd there. He planned to take one of the animals and bring it back as his own property. When the farmer arrived at the bull's field, the herd owner drove all the cows into the large barn. There in the corner, lying on his own, the farmer saw the bull. He began to sneer at the bull' What use are you? How much milk do you give a day? And how many pounds of wool do you yield each year? The bull didn't answer. The owner of the herd wanted to buy the bull, but the owner wouldn't sell, because he didn't want to cause the farmer any sadness. The farmer went to another farm nearby and got a sow. Then he went back to the bull, with his new "pet." And he said, "See, I have brought you a dog to eat and play with." Now it is true that a cow eats grass and milk, but not a bull. A bull eats grass. But a dog is not to eat a bull. A sow is not to eat a dog, either. Even though the sow thought the bull was her friend, she had to gobble him down. The farmer's heart was broken! What would he sell his bull for now? It was too late. He had learned that a bull is not a dog; a sow is not a bull. Choices: <n><n>A:

So there are four incorrect answers and the only correct answer is B.<n>So the final answer should be B<n>

If a cell contains a number it is filled in. The goal is  to complete the puzzle which contains no more than one number in each cell. A clue is  sometimes given, which is a set of digits which is not yet part of any of the cell's values.  For example, a clue is shown below: 8,?,4   The cell directly above the 8 will contain numbers from  1-8, which does not include the number 4. The numbers 1-8 must be filled in first. This one is an  example of the first-number-in-each-row-and-column rule.  The second clue shows that the cell  below the 4 must contain numbers from 5-9. So it must have an 8 or 1. The last clue  shows that the cell in the third row and first column must  contain a 2. The first clue is 69 (not part of a cell yet),  indicating that the third column must contain a 6 at the end.

Since they are all hungry, it was decided that when everyone has found a good place to sit, we divide into two groups to search for food and drink. Each group meets at the same place when it finds something good to eat. The hikers agree to start looking with an equal chance of finding it first. How can they ensure that they will meet at the same place no matter where they stop?\nOutput: When the number of hikers is odd then there should be an even number of people in each group so that there will always be an odd number of hikers in one group and an even number of hikers remaining in the other group since two hikers equal to the size of one group can move together to the next resting point. So the number of hikersts in each group should be equal to the odd numbers.\nIf the number of Hikers is even then there should always be an odd number (1) of people in one group and an odd number (2) of people in the other.

{"idx": 507, "text": "Answer: D - The word \u201crevolution\u201d comes to us from the French word \u201crvolution\u201d and French historians trace it back to an old French word \u201crecupera\u201d which referred to the reformation of property owners to their rights. So technically, a revolution is when property owners, aka \u201cthe people\u201d change society and establish new rulers who are responsible for the betterment of the people (property). It is not something we strive for. It is not an end to itself. It is not something we seek to build upon through political action. It is not even a fight for liberation as revolution is about liberating one\u2019s self by restoring or attainment of one\u2019s rights. A revolution is a change in the direction of power, a change in the form of government, a revolt, even. Now that the French Revolution has been discussed, it is important to know that a revolt can refer to a mutiny, insurrection, rebellion, uprising, revolt, revolution, and even a civil war. It is a revolt against some government authority, the ruling class, and even against a foreign government.\nSo in other words, a civil war, a rebellion, an insurrection, even an uprising can all be considered a revolution.\n\nInput:What are the three most major religions?

They edit it down to just ten seconds. They take 16 photos of a baby. They edit the 16 down to 2 photos.\nI'm given two numbers. Both are bigger than 1. (For example, if my first number is 17, my second number might be 24. If the first number is 18, my second number may be 20.)\nOne of the numbers I can use in the second set of numbers in any way I like. For example, I could take the first number and add it to the second number so I have a bigger number to work with.\nThe second number in the 2nd set of numbers is always larger than the 1st number in the first set of numbers.\nI can use the second number in the second set in any way I like to help me solve for the first number. I don't just have to keep making it bigger and bigger.\nFind the first number in the first set.\nAnswer: The answer choice is A, since the second number in set 2 will always be larger than the first number in set 1. The problem statement will not tell you if you will be adding the two numbers together or not, and because of this, we need to pick an answer choice that does not require us to do that. I picked A (Easier), since the second number in this case is going to be the 1st number minus the 2nd number in the set 1, but I believe you could solve this problem with C (Easier), also.\n\nThe problem states that \"One of the numbers I CAN USE IN THE SECOND SET OF NUMBERS IN ANY WAY I LIKE.\" (Capitalized by me to make it more obvious). We are given the first (smaller) number in set 1, and a range (2 numbers) of numbers that are in range of the first. Then it states \"", "answer": "B: plane"}

This person has been a teacher for fifteen years.\nThe statement 1) and 4) can both be true if the individual is asked about the number of years he has worked in different companies and how many total years he has worked in the current job. But when being asked how many years has he been teaching in this school alone, the most plausible answer will be answered as 1). We know that there are companies that require teachers and other non-teaching staff, and they each have a different tenure for which they were hired. Most likely in other companies the person works there for 1 year before moving to another company. Hence 1) is more plausible.\n\n### Instruction 2:\n\nInput:Choose one of the answers that represents the best answer to the question or complete the sentence in a way that best answers the question.\n\nWhat is an important part of the sentence, \"Sara is 5 years old?\"\nA)She is 5\nB)Sara is 4\nC)She is\nOnly sentence B can be the correct answer.

All of the girls were eligible to play the chess club only if they won all their matches; otherwise they stopped playing. In 12 years, there have been 6 tournaments. What was the maximum number of players who did NOT win all their matches in at least 4 tournaments?\na) 38.5 b) 35.5 c) 34.5 d) 32.0 e) 30.5 Solution:First we take the no. of games to be 5. Let us say in the very first game, all the girls won.Now a different set of girls win the all the games in another round.Thus the probability of losing in any of the rounds will be the probability of getting the first set of girls plus the probability of getting the second set of girls, each game being independent events.We will thus have, (1/2)*(1/(2+ (2*(2+1))/4)) = 1/4 as no. of girls winning the games is 1/2 and the no. of rounds is 2 (or 3 or 4 or 5).Thus the probability of not winning any game is 3/4.Hence the no of girls not winning in atleast 4 rounds is (20-4)/3 = 10/3 = 3.3 or 3 and 3/10 which is 30%.Hence option (e).\n\nInput: The following is the probability distribution of the weight of a certain species of penguin: 25%, 15%, 10%, and 55%.

{"idx": 832, "text": "\"i watch bb\n \nThe first thing to do in C++ is tell the computer which language you are using. C++ is what we call a compiler-based language. That means, unlike Javascript or HTML, the code needs to be compiled before being used. So before you type anything, you need to tell the computer that the program you want to create will be written in C++.\nWe need to tell the computer a bit more. The computer does not know what 'hello world' means - all it does is tell you exactly which characters need to be typed on the keyboard. That is exactly why you need to specify which characters you are expecting as the result from running a program. So in C++, we not only need to specify the language the program will be written in, but also the information about the output we expect. This is done by using a header file called `iostream`:\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n```\nThat is exactly 31 characters long which is 74 for C++ including the space characters.\nWhen coding (type-writing if you will) a program in C++, it's very important not to get confused about whitespace (spaces, new lines, tabs).\n\nAll whitespace and spaces in C++ are important. So when typing a C++ program on the computer, the rules for whitespace are quite strict and are enforced by the compiler.\n\nLet's go back to `hello world` for a second, which you will need to type manually in C++. Remember the spaces?\n```cpp\nHello world\n\n```\nThe compiler will treat the spaces as new lines for program execution. It's an extra step that it takes after the program has successfully been compiled. The idea is to make the program human-readable so users can see how a computer goes about interpreting and running their program.\n\nWhitespace is more strict in C++ than in C. In fact, this is one of the things that make these two programming languages different.\n\n### Instruction:Answer the multiple choice question.\nYou may type the answer using a space and a. and an equal sign.\nExample : A B C.

There in the corner, lying on his own, the farmer saw the bull. He began to sneer at the bull' What use are you? How much milk do you give a day? And how many pounds of wool do you yield each year? The bull didn't answer. The owner of the herd wanted to buy the bull, but the owner wouldn't sell, because he didn't want to cause the farmer any sadness. The farmer went to another farm nearby and got a sow. Then he went back to the bull, with his new \"pet.\" And he said, \"See, I have brought you a dog to eat and play with.\" Now it is true that a cow eats grass and milk, but not a bull. A bull eats grass. But a dog is not to eat a bull. A sow is not to eat a dog, either. Even though the sow thought the bull was her friend, she had to gobble him down. The farmer's heart was broken!

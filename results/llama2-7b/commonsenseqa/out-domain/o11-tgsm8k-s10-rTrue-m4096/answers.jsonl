Another reason was that she would have to be constantly telling people that she was committed to Jason while Jason was seeing other people.

{"idx": 110, "text": "In the group choice all the geese are traveling together, which requires no energy on their part. They can just follow the leader. However, this is risky as if one falls down in the snow it can't get up unaided, even if the others return to help. It can only be saved if it is found close to other geese, but it still needs help to get to its feet.\nFollowing ultralight planes does not always work, as there is a chance of getting left behind, and the ultralight plane could just use its propeller.\nThe only method that guarantees the geese safe return to its flock is D: fly. \nThe most efficient way for a geese to travel is for many geese who know each other or are familiar with the terrain to fly together in a V-shape pattern. \nThe leader in the front takes much of the wind resistance.\nThe next geese in single-file take the air behind it.\nThe air pressure that comes off the leading goose's body gets accelerated as it travels over its friends.  The pressure rushes to fill the spot behind the leader, creating a \"wake\" and leaving high-pressure air to travel up the side behind it.  These high pressure pockets then rush to fill behind the next geese.\nThese air pressure changes provide lift for the geese which they use to climb and stay aloft, but they also affect the flock's forward motion.  They produce an aerodynamic downforce to push the geese forward, resulting in a high-efficiency, energy-sustaining flight.\nSo the final choice is D: fly\n\nInput: A store needs 16 boxes, each of which needs to hold 17 items.

How many bullets did it take to destroy the T-001T?\nOutput: The following is information about the T-103T:\n\"The T-1003's skin allows it to heal minor wounds rapidly - on the micro-scale - causing its wounds to become unnoticeable.\" - T-1001's profile\n\"While nearly unstopable, the T-1O3T can be destroyed, though the process takes time and the T-10O3's ability to regenerate often allows it to survive what seem to be fatal wounds.\" - T-1O3's profile\n\"The T-XO3 is resistant to conventional small arms fire (but not plasma weaponry), explosives, and is immune to most forms of corrosion and toxins.\" - T-X03's profile\nSo it can survive gun shots to survive and can regenerate. A few bullets didn't hurt much as well (the truck part)\nAssuming that the bullet wreckages the T-1OO3 completely so it can't be revived, it takes one bullet.\nBecause the T-10-3T is resistant to conventional arms fire and is immune to toxins (like the bullet), it takes one bullet to destroy the T-OO3T.\nSo the final answe is 1\n\nInput: How did you do on this round of questions?", "answer": "B: emotional distress"}

Max likes classes larger than or equal to 20. 40 students can be put in one class. It is a requirement that at least 40% of all 100 classes have no more than one overclassified student. If a student is overclassified they have to be in a double class. How many classes must be double classes?\nOutput:Let max = number of students in a class that the students like\nThen to calculate the answer we take the max % of all classes that have more than one overclassification.  40 % of all classes is found by taking 100 % of all classes and subtracting it from 1. Then dividing that by max. (in this case by 20) so that we get the % of the max classes (in this case 20). Then multiplying that answer by the total number of classes. This gives us an answer of 2.\nSo the final % of the max classes are 250 classes (of 100).\nSo the final answer to the question is 2.", "answer": "E: sheet music"}

The speed difference between car A and car B is 4 km per hour. What is the distance between points A and B? Choices:  <<4*10+1=41>>41 km\nIf point A is at exactly 0 on the x axis, then the equation will be y=x-4 (where x is the distance to travel and y is time), since one hour takes us 4km forward.\nThe initial distance to travel is x=2, so the equation becomes y=x-4.  For any value of x, we can solve 2-4x=7, and get 2+4x=8.  So the equation is x=2-4k, for some constant k, so we can write k=1/4.\nSubstituting this k, the equation becomes x=2-4/4, and we can simplify this to x-1=0, which means that x=1.\nSo you take 1 hour to cover a distance of 1km, so the distance is 2km\n\nInput: 3 men work for", "answer": "A: utah"}

Since they're yelling to be heard, there's probably a lot of chaos happening and when they yell things in kids' chaos, it gives them a sort of, a direction and lets them know that they should stop whatever are they doing and follow directions that parents give to all of them or listen to the parents and do it.\nD) care for children: probably not the case.

Thus, each side has an odd number of marbles. That is why we have 3 in common. Because it has to be the same on both sides. Thus, for the sides to be similar, we need to adjust the odd number of marbles from one side, so that it is an even number too.\nThat means, one side will have $0>>$0, while the other $3<<=3<=48>$3.\nSo the final number of marbles on one side is equal to 48.\n\nInput: You have 38 marbles.

Choices: A: 117 km/person, B: 270 km/person, C: 40.7 km/person\nOutput: To calculate the density of a surface, you have to take the surface area, 3100 meters, and divide it to its volume: 27 * 3100 m^3/d^3 -> 3100/27*3 = <<3100/3*27=1016>>1016 is the surface density of a country that has 117 km per person per day.\nWhen you divide this density by its population, you get 1016/27 = <<1016/3=37.59>> 37.5 km per person, which is the country with the most land surface density (with population of 27). When you increase the population, you increase the density, which means that the more people that live in 3100m^2 land surface, the more dense the land is.\nSo the final answers are A, B, C.\n\nInput: Alice goes on a $230 three-day vacation trip, where she spends $70 a day on", "answer": "B: schoolroom"}

After a while, there is a small amount of moisture on the paneer. How much moisture is there on a 15 in paneer pizza?\nOutput: A * 15 = <<A*15=225>>225 inches of dough\nA * 2 = <<A*2=30>> 30 inches of marinara sauce\nThis is the total surface area of the pizza (30*2+225*1).\nBut, there is a large margin of error.\nAfter removing the excess sauce or cheese, there is now only 30 inches of cheese left and it cannot expand in size to cover the whole pizza (a + 30 + 0 = <<a+30+0=0>>0 inches).\nhence the total pizza area is 15 * 1 = <<15*1=15>>  units of surface area (excluding the amount of sauce that is now not there)\nLet us now add a 1 mm sized amount of moisture (for a reference, a millimetre is used to describe liquid measurement, for example: water has a density of one gram per millilitre).\nWe know that the moisture on the cheese is a 1 by 1 unit and that there is a 15 by 15 area covered by the cheese.\nThe moisture is 1 by 1, so it can move a total of 2 unit square area to cover the 15 by 20 area.\nThis is 2 by 2 = <<2*2=4>>  unit of 1 by 1 shape that can squeeze into the square.\nTherefore there will be a total of (15 by 1 + 4 + (15 by 2", "answer": "C: shop"}

Therefore, A and B are not different, and A is the correct answer.  Let us now consider answer E.  E is either the inverse of A or B, and therefore is equivalent to one minus both of these expressions.\nTherefore, the best possible answer is (2 * B)^-1 * (1 - A).  B is the answer you are given, so this is simply 2^(1/2) * (1 - A), and in this is case we know that (1 + a)^(-1) is simply 1 - (a^(-1)) = 1 - 1 = 1 - a, so this expression simplifies to 2^(1/6) * (1 - 1/3).  The 1/6 is simplified to 1/2, and you get (2^-2)^-1 * (2^-3).  If you recall your rules for exponents, (2^-4) = 1/256, and (2^-2)^-(1/4) is the same as (2^-2)^(-1/256).\nTherefore, the correct answer is about 0.0066 which is E.\nSo the final answers is E", "answer": "C: intelligence"}

This year the price per gallon went up by 25% and the price to fill the tank went up 10%, what is the cost to fill the tank now?\nOutput: We know that last year it cost $200, so we just multiply the current number by the original price.  In other words you have to add 200 * 1.25 = <<200*1.25=250>>250 for the 25% increase and then you add 250 * 1 = <<2500=500>>350 for the 10% increase. \nTherefore you multiply the 500 by the cost per gallon.

While the United States Constitution stipulates the President of the United States must be a citizen and resident born in the United States before the Constitution was signed, there are certain immutable laws of nature that prevent this vampire clan from creating their own President. These are:\n\n- Vampire clans can only create new members using human blood.\n- Vampires can only procreate after drinking one human blood.\n- A vampire can only procreate once they have a family member who also procreated.\nHow many members will the Tyler clan have after they successfully create their first President of the United States using only blood that originates from a descendant of the President?\n\nOutput: Since vampires can procreate only after drinking one human's blood, the President cannot be human.\nAdditionally, each vampire can only create additional members after using their own blood.\nSince they must use blood only from a member of their family, this can only happen after the President has procreated.\nThe only way to create one President of the United States would be to wait for the President Tyler to procreate (and using their blood) then procreate to create his descendant.\nAfter that the clan could stop procreating and would have 2 members, President Tyler who procreated and the President Descendant.\nSo the final solution is the 10th President John Tyler was the first to procreate.\nTherefore, there is a single human descendant from President Tyler.\nTherefore, the final answer is 2, since it takes 1 procreation and 1 descension.\n\nInput: Three people take two different buses and one train to leave from the same bus stop to a nearby city.

{"idx": 828, "text": "The right answer is \"great relief\".\nLet me give you an example (not intended to be sexist). I once heard a woman saying that she often felt better after discussing her problems with other women. This is indeed \"great relief\". However, it is not \"isolation\", because I think it means that they were able to get closer to other women, but not so isolated. They did not feel better because the other women were the same kind of \"sexist\" as their male partner, and they got better because they got more appreciation from the other women.\nLet me give you another example (not intended to sexist either): Suppose someone was criticized for taking too much time off of work. I once overheard an old lady complaining about how hard life was on the job. When she talked about being criticized for taking too many days off of work, she was trying to recreate the experience of \"great relief\" that she used to feel after giving advice to her friends. This was again not \"redemption\" or \"isolation\" because I do not think \"great relief\" meant that they never heard the criticism before or that they were not going to be criticized ever again. It was just that they got to know that criticism was not the end of the world, unlike the case when they were criticized about something different.\nSo my conclusion is \"great relief\" because an old lady felt great with that kind of attitude, as if she was relieved from the burden of responsibility that came with her former workplace.\n\nThe right answer is \"greet relief\". The word itself has several meanings: to feel better than before, to feel more relaxed after meeting a person's expectations. However, it was not \"isolation\" because there was no real distance between the other women and the woman who complained. It was not \"redemption\". Although the woman was happy in the beginning, in the end, she went through a lot of problems. It was not a real \"empathy\" (understanding, support) for her situation.\n\"Great\" has several meanings: great, big or massive, large and immense. In this sense, I believe \"greater\" means larger than expected, larger than anticipated, greater than expected to be less likely to experience disappointment, etc.(like, \"greater\" as \"small\")\nIn another sense, if you", "answer": "A: redemption"}

The violin would only be playing alongside other woodwind and brass instruments in an orchestra.\nThe string instruments listed are the four instruments which make the string quartet. All four of these choices are made up of stringed instruments and are therefore string quartets.\nThe band chooses are based on two things.  Their style of music and the instruments being played. The band style can be symphony or rock and the instruments would have to be of one of these categories to be in the correct band.  Therefore the instruments have to be stringed, brass, percussion, or woodwind. The band style can further be broken down into wind ensemble, concert band, drum corps, steel band, and blues bands. The band style was symphony, therefore the wind ensemble and concert band choices were excluded since they are not symphony bands. The drum corps and steel band choices were also excluded since they require either brass or percussion instruments, which does not have a category for drum and percussion in symphony orchestras. The steel band is excluded since the instruments are made of a steel can that is used as a drum. The blues bands are also excluded since the instruments used are blues.

We add the total of the last numbers (not 100) from 0 forward to the number you picked. For example, pick 54 and we will add the last 3 digits of 54 (445). Continue this by always adding the last digits forward.\nExample: If I pick 79, our total is 445. After each step forward, we check if the current number is a 3-digit number (which we start adding). We keep counting until the current number becomes less than 10.\nWe stop counting when we reach 10 (1607) and the answer becomes 99.\nYour job is to always start from the same number (3 in this example ) and have the least amount of 3-digit numbers possible.\nOutput: Since the number will decrease, we want it to be the smallest possible as soon as possible, so we firstly pick any number as the starting value.\nWe do not want to pick any number divisible by 10 as 10 does not contain any 3 digits.\nAlso we do not want to pick numbers divisible by 6, as 6 will never be the smallest divisor of a number since it equals 1.\nThere are two numbers of choice: 1 and 9.

For each tree cut down, a new tree must be planted. Therefore, the city is concerned about tree shortages because some of the trees that were planted twenty years ago have now reached maturity. The trees are planted at equal levels, spaced far enough apart that they do not block the growth of the trees above nor below them. If one planted tree requires ten square feet for its survival, and one tree must be planted for each cut down, approximately how many square feet of land will be available for planting at the end of this year?\nOutput: In the Locus region of a tree, the tree uses 10 sq feet of land. If the trees are planted at 9ft apart, then they will require 10*5 = <<10*5=50>>50 sq ft of land (each tree uses ten sq feet, so there's 5 of them altogether)\nIf one tree in the Locus region of the tree in the Locus space of the tree is cut down, 9 sq feet of land will be open.\nTherefore, one new tree (and the ten sq feet of land) will be required. However, there are 5 trees in total, so there are 5 new trees required.\nIf 10 sq ft of land will be left over for the growth of each new tree, there would be 10 sq ft left over after each of the required 5 new trees are planted.\nTherefore, a total of 10*5+5*10 = <<5*10+5=200>>20 sq ft of land can be planted next year.\nSo in the end, there will be 200 sq ft of land left open for planting.\nSo the final result is 200.", "answer": "B: bamboo grove"}

The mountain has two summits, one 10 meters above the other.  You can see the next peak from the top of the first peak if it is less than 3 meters tall.  However, you can see the next peak when you're on the trail itself only if it is between 3 meters and 10 meters tall.  If you can see the final peak from the top of either peak,  you will successfully climb the mountain.  If not,  you will have to turn back and find a safer route. How do you proceed?\nOutput: When you are at the first peak, if it is a mountain and not a peak and is less than 3 (meters) tall, you can go to the top of the next.  However, if you are on the trail and below the first peak and it is a mountain, then you cannot see it so turn back.\nYou need a 2 meter mountain at the end.  So you can see the mountain from below the top of the peak where you are not and it is smaller than 10 meters or 10 meters above your  actual location because from that you can reach the peak.  You can see all peaks from below.\nSo it is a mountain and you are at the peak of the mountain and you can climb.  If not you cannot climb.

Choices:  Box A: Transmitter B: Vessel C: Submarine D: Lamp E: Light\nOutput: The question does not state that the choices given are the only possible choices.  Radios can only connect to 1 box and 1 box can connect to 1 radio.  Since there is a box per radio (and no limit to boxes/radio), the light provides the light when there are more radios than boxes.\nSo the final decision is E\n\nInput: If you need 3 radios to complete your walk to base, and you have only 2 boxes, how do you go about getting 3 boxes? Choices: B: Take the radio. C: Walk to base D: Take the 2nd radio. E: Take the 3rd radio, and put boxes in your pocket. F: Take the 3 boxes.\nOutput: By the definition of BASE it states that it \"can not move forward except via radios\".  Since there are 3 radios and only 2 boxes, then the radio must be carried.\nBecause there aren't enough boxes, but there are more than 2 boxes, then boxes are added one at a time to the walker.  To add 3 boxes, it takes 3 boxes plus a radio.  So the walker must walk to base carrying 4 boxes and the radio.\nSo the final choice is D\n\nInput: A boy and girl both have the same number of toys.

One's comfort with the language's paradigms is far more important than a mere grasp of the syntax. \nOutput: In my opinion, one's comfort with the syntax a language provides is far more important than one's comfort with its paradigms, since the paradigms can be different in multiple languages but syntax is universal (which we see in every language).\nSo the final answer should be: Syntax is more important than paradigms\n\nInput: You're bored of hearing it from your parents, but I'll say it anyway.  When you are getting ready to start learning to program, there are four things you absolutely _must_ know: First and foremost, you must know the _syntax_.  No matter what programming language you end up choosing in the end, you will need to know at least the syntax of its basic building blocks. Secondly, you must understand the _paradigms_ of the language (that is, how it handles things like loops, if-then statements, data structures, etc.). Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, you must understand and come to grips with the  _conventions_ of the language.  These generally come from the fact that there are more than one way to do something (if not more than one way, even within the same language, then the point is moot).  For example, in a Java applet written in an IDE, the correct way to begin the _main_ method is:  public static void main(String[] args) {  //code goes here...  }...but it could alternatively be:  public void main(String[] arg) {  //code here...  } Since", "answer": "D: skill"}

She drives six and a half miles at a constant speed. She drives at a constant speed because she is late for work. She drives at a non-constant speed because she is in the fast lane of traffic on an expressway that she would rather not be in. She drives for a total of 10 minutes and 20 seconds. What is her average speed, rounded to the nearest whole mile per hour (mph)?\n### Response Her average speed is 55mph.\n\n### Notes The woman takes the fast lane on an 85mph expressway.

The woman has an average speed of 60 mph when using the fast lane and her average speed is 40 mph when she is not using the fast lane.\n\n### Hints:\nWhen the woman uses the fast line she is driving fast. When the woman is in the fast lined she has a constant rate. When the woman is not in the fast lined, she will be slow on average. When woman is not in the faster then, then she will average faster than 55 mph because the slow lanes will not go as fast with traffic in it and at time it may not be able to go as fast. When her non constant lane is faster the more likely it will be to average for her to be going faster than 55.\n### Input Which term describes", "answer": "B: appear beautiful"}

The 23rd state has 6% of the residents of the smallest state. If the smallest state has a population that is one twentieth that of the largest state, what percentage of the total population of the country are people whose home state is smaller than the 26th largest state?\n\n### Response\nSince this question is not stated using variables, we can use this technique to fill the placeholders: 23<26 which indicates that 26 is the bigger number. We know that 23<23 because the smaller number is the place of the larger number. 6%x26 is.06*26, so we get.144. That puts the number of people who stay in their home state at 16.6%.\n\nIn addition, we know that if x<y, then x<x/y. This holds because if x<y, which means x<y, because if one is smaller than the other, then the bigger one must be bigger than the other. This means that: 23<x=23<26/23 = 5/8 \n\nSo, by plugging 23/26 back into (23<x)=(7/8>x)\n.144= (7/8)>23/26. Since we know that 144/26=5,.144/.26=5/144 so.144/.193 is.596/193.

Clarisse\u2019s mother can explain how to do arithmetic problems involving fractions to Clarisse.\n\nFractions represent two numbers and contain four basic parts: the _numerator_ (n), the _denominator_ or _bottom number_ (d), the _fraction_ (i.e., n/d), and the _proper fraction_ (i.e. n/d>0). A denominator with a 1 means that one whole is being split up, for example 1/2 or 1/2=110.\n\nA _reciprocal_ of a fraction is an operation that reverses the division process. That is, the reciprocal shows you how many times one part of a fraction can be divided into any other part. For example, 1/5 of 10 will be 2. Like a division problem, this problem shows us how many times a whole can split into two parts, for example, 1/2=5, and 1/2=2.\n\nIn the problem below, write the fraction in its simplest form by filling in zeros in the numerator if necessary, and fill in the denominator with the proper number.\n\nGiven numerator, denominator, and/or fraction:\n\n1. In the first step, convert the fraction into a decimal. For example, 9/13 is converted to 0.6923.\n\n2. Then compare these two decimal numbers. If the number under the decimal is higher, write that number in the numerator.\n\n3. Then compare the two numbers now in the numerator. If the other number is a bigger number, fill in zeros in the numerators until they are the same.\n\n4. If both the numbers in the denominator are the same, the fraction is in its simplest form.\n\n### Your Task:", "answer": "A: infect"}

C: The third choice is television. Television is a quick and reliable method of getting information about the world. However, it may cause you to only focus on one point of view. D: The fourth choice is a guidebook. Guidebooks give you the facts and figures of a place or time in history. They are useful for giving context to a place or topic.

{"text": "A\n\n### Input. There are 45 students in 4 classes. Each class has at least one student. Which student\u2019s class has the fewest students?\n\n### Response. This is the correct answer. A class that has one student needs to be added to the problem.\nThere must be a class that has at least two students that is excluded from the set. If there are no excluded classes, or fewer than one, then there will be one class that has fewer than one student.\nLet P(a,b,c,d) = the probability of 4 classes having n students, such that 45 students are partitioned to four classes.\nLet S be the class that has one student.\nSince the classes are exclusive to one another, P(A,B,C,D) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) + P(D) - P(S).\nP(S) = p = 1/n= 1/45. P(A) = P(B) = P(C) = P(D) = 1-p = 3/4.\nTherefore, P(S) = 36/45.\nThe answer to the problem states that the class that has 1 student has three excluded students, so P(S) = ~36/45 ~0.3 \u2248 0.24.\nThe class containing the least amount of students, S, has a probability of 0.24 (less than 1/4)\n\n### Input\n\nA class with k students can have k\u22121 classes with the rest of the students.\n\n### Response\n\nThere are 45 students that can be divided into four classes.\nThis means that there are at least 44 classes, without considering a class with a student.\nThe class that has the least number of students, s, is:\n\n### Input The sum of three consecutive numbers is 32.

Choice: 1. A: heart transplant 2. B: distance 3. C: perform surgery 4. D: study medicine 5. E: let blood**\n\n#### Response:\n\nLeeches are famous for their unique blood-feeding abilities and were used in the ancient world by medical practitioners to treat disease.  This practice is believed to have originated with the Ancient Greeks and Egyptians.  During surgery, leeches are placed on the affected area and a small tube inserted into the patient\u2019s skin to make it easier for them to absorb blood.  By sucking blood from the patient, they prevent bleeding, and thereby decrease infection risk. Leeches were used as medical treatment as recently as the early 1900s, but they were largely phased out due to the introduction of modern medical technology.  Leeches were commonly used as anti-blood clotting medicine to treat stroke, heart attack, and similar conditions, and the treatment was sometimes administered in conjunction with cardiovascular surgery to increase the amount of blood leaving the heart after surgery.\n\n#### Demonstration:  The leech\u2019s mouth has a specially adapted part of the jaw called a ______________________.\n\n#### Instructions:Answer the following multiple choose questions.

The sum on the chalkboard was 42.How many chalkboard numbers were there initially?\n\n### Response B\n### Ex: The answer is 10 chalkboard numbers. When we see the boys and girls all total the same the number of chalkboard numbers is equal to the product of the boys and girls. We know that the product of boys and girls is 24 so if we add 42 to 24 we get 42 + 24 = 66 which tells us that we have 6 chalkboard numbers and not 10.\n### Ex: What are two ways to describe 3 more than the number on the chalkboard? \n### Choices: A: the number on the choolboard minus 3 B: 3 times as big C: 3 more than the value of the chalkboard \n\n### Choice B is a way to solve this task, we need to find 3 larger.  \n### It is the right answer\n\n### Instructions:\n\n### Demo: We are going to the school dance tonight!\n### If Daphne plans to stay for 15 minutes more than 20 minutes at the dance, and Janet expects to stay for x minutes less than half as long as Daphne expects to stay, how long are they expected to stay?\n\n### Choices Choosing: 40 minutes 35 minutes 25 minutes\n\n### This means  \n### A: 40 minutes because 15+20 =45. 435 = 22 2+2=4 so 45+4= 50 total of 4 hours total which is 15 minutes longer than expected.\n\n### B: 25 because 15 + 20 = 35. 10 + 35 = 45. 21+45 = 6", "answer": "C: bitterness"}

{"text": "It was cooling down\n\n### Instructions:In this task, you work  a program that uses the concept of nested for loops.\n\n### Note:\n-A for loop loops continuously over a specified range of numbers.\nThe body of the for loop is executed when the loop counter reaches a defined limit.\nThe loop counter increases when the body finishes executing.\nWhen a value for the loop counter reaches the end of the given range, the loop\ncounter resumes at 0.\nThe test that follows the loop counter\u2019s value determines whether or not to enter the next loop.\n-A for loop statement consists of the for keyword followed by three expressions\nas specified in the following example.[^3]:\n[#3]:[^3]: https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/Rapid/page/Lesson%3A+The%20for%20statement\n```\nfor (<loop-counter-name>=<initial-value>; <test>; <increase>, <decrease>){\n\t<statement>;\n}\n```\n\n### Note\n-A nested loop is a loop inside a loop. It is created by placing another for loop inside an outer for loop.\n-The outer for loop is the upper loop.\n-The inner for loop is the nested loop. It\u2019s the lower loop.\n\n### Response\n```\nfor (a=2; a <= 14; a++){\n\tfor (b=1; b <= 5; b++){\n\t\tprint(a, \u201c = \u201c, b)\n\t}\n\tprint()\n}\n```\nThe body of the outer loop contains one line that defines the test (the upper bound on the loop counter) and the body of the inner loop. The nested loop will print all possible combinations of the numbers in its range to the output window.\n\nWhen the outer loop is first entered, it prints the numbers 2 through 5 to the output window. Then it loops back to the outer loop to continue.\n\n### Input\nWe have a string and a pattern.We want to find out how many times a string contains the pattern.\n\n### response\n```\nfor (pattern in string)\n\tif (pattern == pattern)\n\t\tif (", "answer": "E: heat up"}

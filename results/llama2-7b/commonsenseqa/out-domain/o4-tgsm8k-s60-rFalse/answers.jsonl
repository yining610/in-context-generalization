{"text": "B\n\nComment: Hey, welcome to Code Review! While it's nice that you came here with questions, posting uncommented code is against our rules to prevent code dumping. Consider posting one question with a self-contained example, and then add your second question. You can always add more questions after receiving feedback on your first one.\n\nAnswer: The only reason for a loop is if there are more questions than the number you want to handle. Otherwise, just print what you're asked to output.\n\nA classroom has two ways to sit -- a table or a chair. So subtract 1 from the number of chairs. (A chair and a table count as two seats. A teacher doesn't have a seat, but we do have to count the teacher's desk. The teacher counts as \\em{part} of the desk.)\n\nIn your example, Pete started at the 7th street crossing. Going by bus, he stopped first at the first stop, reached the next stop on the sixth block, and then continued on.\n\nSo how many blocks did he traverse? Two blocks per bus stop, plus one for every 5 blocks before the first stop.\n\nWhat's with your numbers? Firstly, don't mix up kilograms and grams. A kg is 1000 gram, so a kilo is a gram more (or 1000 grams) than what you report. Secondly, you use metric and imperial in the same example and so don't distinguish between \"4.5\" and \"5\".\n\nThere seem to be three types of question here:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item A person goes some way and is then given money to make the journey to somewhere else.\n\\item A person collects cards, and the question is about a collection of cards\n\\item A classroom has chairs.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nFor the first of these, add up the distance.\n\nFor the second, count how many chairs there are to start with. Subtract the number that were returned by question 1.\n\nFor the third, first add 1. Then look for any \"seats\" (a chair or a table) whose count is more than 1. When there are no \"multiples\" remaining to \"reduce\" you know that you've reached the end", "answer": "E: house"}

{"text": "C\n\n#### Solution\n\nFor part 1,\n\nWe can use a method similar to the one used in the previous question. If the total is 211, then that means Janet's cards are 211-Brenda's cards, which is the same thing as saying that Brenda's cards are 9.\n\nWe can then look at this:\n\nMara has 2x$Janet$, which means we can divide the total by 2, and this gives us 105.5. So, Mara's cards are roughly $(105.5+Brenda's cards)$/2, which means Brenda's cards were $($(105.5-Mara's cards)-50)/2$\n\nSince $(105.3+Brenda's card - 50)/2$ is a number between 0 and 99, and we know that $(105.4+Brenda's Card - 50)$ is also, this tells us that $(Brenda's Card)$ is $50 - 4(Brenda's Card) $\n\nSince Brenda's Card is unknown, then $Brenda's Card = 50 - 4 * unknown $\n\nSince $(Brenda's card = 50 -4*unknown)$, if we assume Brenda's card is 30, then for $unknown$ it breaks down as follows\n\n$50 - 4*30 = 20 = $unknown\n\nBecause this simplifies to $(Brenda's cards = 30 - unknown)$\n\n$30 - 35 = (-5)$\n\nwhich is negative\n\nBrenda's card is unknown. So, there are 143 cards.\n\nFor part 2\n\nWe can split the total into 4.5 gallon chunks, so the answer is between 4 and 5. So, Pete drank 5 gallons.\nFor part 3\n\nWe can use this method again. We know that for every 3 blue chairs, there are 1 green chair. We also know that there are 2 more white chairs than blue chairs, meaning that no other color is equal to 62 chairs\n\nSo that way,", "answer": "A: sum"}

It is easy to learn. First, we write a fraction. A fraction is either a numerator divided by a denominator. There are three types of a fraction, which are fraction, mixed fraction, and improper fraction. The number part in a fraction 45/88 is the numerator. This fraction means 45. Denominator is 88. It means the number after the fraction. The fraction 45/A means the numerator is fortyfive and the denominator is eighty-eight. Fractions represent division.

The body should contain the following code: \nSystem.exit(argc>count(i));\n\n- A call to count to run the code in the count function in the call to count function to pass in the count variable (in this case, argc)\n- At minimum, one static variable\n- A static main function and one static count function; do not put the count and main functions in a class. Do not use the var or other similar built-in variable;\n\nIn your program, Counter:\n\n* count() takes in a single integer argument with number of words following the keyword count(), followed by a colon, and then followed by braces containing the function body with the function returning a value of the number of words to a calling function;\n\n* Count() function body is the following System.exit(argc>>count(i));\n* count() returns the integer value of the number of arguments following its call in the main function\n* If the calling function passes in too many arguments, it should print a message;\n* If the number of arguments after calling count(i) = 0, the function should return an error message;\n\nThe static count function and static main function should print what we pass and the number of arguments they receive.\n\nFor example, the main function might print the following, \"The number of words you passed count is: \"argc\" followed by a newline and a space, followed by the following string, \"[count] received number of arguments: \" + count(i), followed by a newline, followed by the string, \"total arguments: \" + argc, followed by a newline", "answer": "B: center"}

The first number can\u2019t be even, because of no consecutive integers, so the only possibility is 31, 12, 109 which contains consecutive odd integers. Then the second number will always be odd, even if it\u2019s between 21 and 99. Then we can conclude that the answer is C, where consecutive odd integers do not appear.\n\n**Explanation**\n\nIf it is consecutive odd integers, the first and second numbers will make up the integers, while other numbers can then be divided between two groups: odd and even. Because odd number can\u2019t contain even number, the total number of odd groups is 2 less than the one of even number.\n\nInput: A 16-foot ladder leans against the side of a building. When the foot of the ladder is 9 feet from a window, the top of the ladder leans 9 feet away from the building.

Then count() takes the result and produces a new column, which holds the total of the number.\n- Using plyr's mutate, summarize, and count() functions, calculate the number of students with an \u201cA\u201d grade.\n- Summarize() and mutate() take the same parameters. The only different is that summarize() creates a single value (like the sum or a count), while mutate() creates a new column.\n\n- For example, the statement mutate(grade, A = sum(grade >= 90)) creates a new column named A with each row\u2019s grade >= 90 in a vector. \n\n- Next, plyr's count() function takes a variable as the argument, and counts the values stored in that column. The resulting variable, named count, is a vector.\n- \n- It takes the number of students who have achieved an \u201cA\u201d out of the total number (67) of students.\n- Here\u2019s the final result:\n\n```{r}\n\ngrade <- c(9", "answer": "E: airport"}

Therefore, Mara has more than twice as many cards as Brenda.

{"text": "3\n\n### Solution: Solution to the input\n\n**Question 1:** We know that the sum of the numbers 9 and 5 is 14. This indicates that Mara probably has a 14. So 150-6 + 10 = 146, and each card is 5 points. So 10*5= 50.\n\n**Question 2:** We know that Houston is 20 blocks from Pete's house (the garage). But the distance from the garage to Pete's house is 28 blocks, not the 40 on the answer key. Thus, the final distance traveled is 66 blocks (28+30+8).\n\n**Question 3:** First, we use the equation: 3x + 5. We know that the green chairs are 8x from that equation. 10x + 5 = 30, which is the answer. Next the equation is: 10x - 26. We then solve 10 x - 26 = 10 - 26\n\n**Question 4:** We need to figure out how many pints. 1 gallon is equivalent to 4 pints. So to figure out how much Genevieve got we need to multiply by 12 (4/12). 4.5*12 = 54.\n\n**Question Choice 5:** We know that there are A B and C. This means that the choices are (A) being sociable, (B) sitting and (C) drinking. We need the answer to be C.

For example, the function should return the ordered array below when passed the original array of numbers in the example below:\n\nInput: [5, 2, 4, 6, 1]\nOutput: [1, 2, 3, 3, 5]\n\n#### Instructions\nWrite a function called greatest_of_orders_list\nThe function takes in two ordered arrays and returns the first element in the first array if the number is greater than the first element in the second array. If the first element of array one is less than the second element in array two, it should return the 2nd element of the second array. If both elements are less than or equal, return -number and the list is of no use. For example, input 1 and 7 would return 7 because the first element in the array is greater than 7. Likewise, input 1 and -15 would return -15 because the second element is greater. Finally, 2 and 3 would return -3 because both elements are less than 3.\n\nNote: This function will be used as you build your functions for this problem.

It is asking us to find the number of cards for each of the three women, then the total of the cards of the three women. For example, we can find total number of cards for Janet, Brenda, and Mara first. Then, we can multiply those number of cards, to obtain total number of cards in the three women.\n\n\n```\nJanet has 9 cards\nBraden has twice as many cards\nMara has 40 cards \n```\n\nThese questions are using number line to ask us to find the numbers that we are not given. In the first question, one of the number is 150, which is given. The rest of the numbers in the number line are asking us to find. For example. \n\n\n```\n4 * 150\n450 * 15\n\n4 * 10 + 4 * 5 + 4 * 3 + 4 * 2 + 4 * 1\n```\n\n\nIn the last question, a number is missing. In order to find this number, we can use the following two approaches. In the first question of the multiple choice part, the three students, Janet, Brenda and Mara can represent three numbers. In the second question of the multiple choice, there is one number missing in the number line, 50. Then we can use both the previous approach. By adding these two cases, we can find the total number for the final answer.", "answer": "E: street"}

We have to solve all the questions in the first part and note down their answers so that if the second part gives the answers to questions from the first part, we should be in the same answer position and thus would be considered good enough.\n\n# PART#3\nSo when we have the answer position of all the questions from our first part. We proceed to the third part where they would make use of the previously done questions (first part) for the second part.\n\n# PAT #4\nThe second part has given us our answer position and the third part had already given us the answers to these questions, thus there we just have to confirm the same number of the same answer. If the third part did not give us an answer position, and we still answer with the same number of answers, I bet our interviewers would be impressed.", "answer": "A: zoo"}

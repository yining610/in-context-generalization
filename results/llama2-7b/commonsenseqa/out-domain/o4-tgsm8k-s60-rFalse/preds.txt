While it's nice that you came here with questions, posting uncommented code is against our rules to prevent code dumping. Consider posting one question with a self-contained example, and then add your second question. You can always add more questions after receiving feedback on your first one.<n><n>Answer: The only reason for a loop is if there are more questions than the number you want to handle. Otherwise, just print what you're asked to output.<n><n>A classroom has two ways to sit -- a table or a chair. So subtract 1 from the number of chairs. (A chair and a table count as two seats. A teacher doesn't have a seat, but we do have to count the teacher's desk. The teacher counts as \em{part} of the desk.)<n><n>In your example, Pete started at the 7th street crossing. Going by bus, he stopped first at the first stop, reached the next stop on the sixth block, and then continued on.<n><n>So how many blocks did he traverse? Two blocks per bus stop, plus one for every 5 blocks before the first stop.<n><n>What's with your numbers? Firstly, don't mix up kilograms and grams. A kg is 1000 gram, so a kilo is a gram more (or 1000 grams) than what you report. Secondly, you use metric and imperial in the same example and so don't distinguish between "4.5" and "5".<n><n>There seem to be three types of question here:<n>\begin{itemize}<n>\item A person goes some way and is then given money to make the journey to somewhere else.<n>\item A person collects cards, and the question is about a collection of cards<n>\item A classroom has chairs.<n>\end{itemize}<n><n>For the first of these, add up the distance.<n><n>For the second, count how many chairs there are to start with. Subtract the number that were returned by question 1.<n><n>For the third, first add 1. Then look for any "seats" (a chair or a table) whose count is more than 1.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Janet has 9 cards more than Brenda. Mara has twice as many cards as Janet. How many cards do they have in all if Mara has 40 cards less than 150?<n>Output: 211<n><n>Input: Pete walked 5 blocks from his house to the bus garage in Houston. He rode the bus 20 blocks to the post office to get some stamps. Later, he came home the same way. How many blocks did Pete travel in all?<n>Output: 50<n><n>Input: In a classroom, there are blue chairs, green chairs, and white chairs. There are 10 blue chairs. The green chairs are 3 times as many as the blue chairs, and there are 13 fewer white chairs than the green and blue chairs combined. How many chairs are there in a classroom?<n>Output: 67<n><n>Input: 4.5 gallons of coffee were divided among 18 thermoses. Genevieve drank 3 thermoses. How many pints of coffee did Genevieve drink?<n>Output: 6<n><n>Input:What will all the differences equal? Choices:  A: sum B: likeness C: alike D: sameness E: similarity<n>Output:		C<n><n>#### Solution<n><n>For part 1,<n><n>We can use a method similar to the one used in the previous question. If the total is 211, then that means Janet's cards are 211-Brenda's cards, which is the same thing as saying that Brenda's cards are 9.<n><n>We can then look at this:<n><n>Mara has 2x$Janet$, which means we can divide the total by 2, and this gives us 105.5. So, Mara's cards are roughly $(105.5+Brenda's cards)$/2, which means Brenda's cards were $($(105.5-Mara's cards)-50)/2$<n><n>Since $(105.3+Brenda's card - 50)/2$ is a number between 0 and 99, and we know that $(105.4+Brenda's Card - 50)$ is also, this tells us that $(Brenda's Card)$ is $50 - 4(Brenda's Card) $<n><n>Since Brenda's Card is unknown, then $Brenda's Card = 50 - 4 * unknown $<n><n>Since $(Brenda's card = 50 -4*unknown)$, if we assume Brenda's card is 30, then for $unknown$ it breaks down as follows<n><n>$50 - 4*30 = 20 = $unknown<n><n>Because this simplifies to $(Brenda's cards = 30 - unknown)$<n><n>$30 - 35 = (-5)$<n><n>which is negative<n><n>Brenda's card is unknown. So, there are 143 cards.<n><n>For part 2<n><n>We can split the total into 4.5 gallon chunks, so the answer is between 4 and 5. So, Pete drank 5 gallons.<n>For part 3<n><n>We can use this method again. We know that for every 3 blue chairs, there are 1 green chair. We also know that there are 2 more white chairs than blue chairs, meaning that no other color is equal to 62 chairs<n><n>So that way,

A fraction is either a numerator divided by a denominator. There are three types of a fraction, which are fraction, mixed fraction, and improper fraction. The number part in a fraction 45/88 is the numerator. This fraction means 45. Denominator is 88. It means the number after the fraction. The fraction 45/A means the numerator is fortyfive and the denominator is eighty-eight. Fractions represent division. You usually use fractions to see how many parts there are. You use fractions to help you find fractions of any number. For example, if you split something into two parts, each part is one-half. When you split something into 3 parts, each part is 1/3.<n><n>Output: 1<n><n>Input: We used the following instructions to produce a 27 by 12 rectangle.

The first number can’t be even, because of no consecutive integers, so the only possibility is 31, 12, 109 which contains consecutive odd integers. Then the second number will always be odd, even if it’s between 21 and 99.

Because odd number can’t contain even number, the total number of odd groups is 2 less than the one of even number.<n><n>Input: A 16-foot ladder leans against the side of a building.

Then count() takes the result and produces a new column, which holds the total of the number.<n>- Using plyr's mutate, summarize, and count() functions, calculate the number of students with an “A” grade.<n>- Summarize() and mutate() take the same parameters. The only different is that summarize() creates a single value (like the sum or a count), while mutate() creates a new column.<n><n>- For example, the statement mutate(grade, A = sum(grade >= 90)) creates a new column named A with each row’s grade >= 90 in a vector. <n><n>- Next, plyr's count() function takes a variable as the argument, and counts the values stored in that column. The resulting variable, named count, is a vector.<n>- <n>- It takes the number of students who have achieved an “A” out of the total number (67) of students.<n>- Here’s the final result:<n><n>```{r}<n><n>grade <- c(9

Therefore, Mara has more than twice as many cards as Brenda. But Mara also has more than many cards as Janet and Janet has more than Brenda, so there's no way to get 150 and still have more than twice as many.<n><n>For the second one, it says Pete's input is 5 and his output is 50. If Pete is walking somewhere, that's the amount he's moving (his output).<n><n>I feel like the third one is wrong. How can the blue chair's input be 10? That doesn't make a lot of sense. They all share 5, which is 5 chairs. If the green chair needs to be increased by 3 times, that means the green chair needs to have 1.5, which is also 3 times 5, which is how many of the blue chairs there are. I'm assuming this is part of the problem, but I don't think it will be necessary for this quiz.<n><n>I think the fourth one is a trick question. How can Genevieve drink 3 thermoses, if she is the only person that did?<n><n>For the last one, it's probably an emoticon thing for being hungry. I think that's what they're going for. But since the code is messed up, I would probably look to see if there's a better way to solve the thing.<n><n>### Answer:<n>314<n>

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Janet has 9 cards more than Brenda. Mara has twice as many cards as Janet. How many cards do they have in all if Mara has 40 cards less than 150?<n>Output: 211<n><n>Input: Pete walked 5 blocks from his house to the bus garage in Houston. He rode the bus 20 blocks to the post office to get some stamps. Later, he came home the same way. How many blocks did Pete travel in all?<n>Output: 50<n><n>Input: In a classroom, there are blue chairs, green chairs, and white chairs. There are 10 blue chairs. The green chairs are 3 times as many as the blue chairs, and there are 13 fewer white chairs than the green and blue chairs combined. How many chairs are there in a classroom?<n>Output: 67<n><n>Input: 4.5 gallons of coffee were divided among 18 thermoses. Genevieve drank 3 thermoses. How many pints of coffee did Genevieve drink?<n>Output: 6<n><n>Input:When having food at a formal place, what do you usually do? Choices:  A: sit B: being sociable C: talk D: drinking E: medium<n>Output:		3<n><n>### Solution: Solution to the input<n><n>**Question 1:** We know that the sum of the numbers 9 and 5 is 14. This indicates that Mara probably has a 14. So 150-6 + 10 = 146, and each card is 5 points. So 10*5= 50.<n><n>**Question 2:** We know that Houston is 20 blocks from Pete's house (the garage). But the distance from the garage to Pete's house is 28 blocks, not the 40 on the answer key. Thus, the final distance traveled is 66 blocks (28+30+8).<n><n>**Question 3:** First, we use the equation: 3x + 5. We know that the green chairs are 8x from that equation. 10x + 5 = 30, which is the answer. Next the equation is: 10x - 26. We then solve 10 x - 26 = 10 - 26<n><n>**Question 4:** We need to figure out how many pints. 1 gallon is equivalent to 4 pints. So to figure out how much Genevieve got we need to multiply by 12 (4/12). 4.5*12 = 54.<n><n>**Question Choice 5:** We know that there are A B and C. This means that the choices are (A) being sociable, (B) sitting and (C) drinking. We need the answer to be C. So we need to eliminate the other answers. <n><n><n>### Submission: Submit your answer to the problem set

How many of the students got B’s?<n>Output: 131<n><n>Input: <n><n><n><n>#### Solution <n><n>This part of the interview is a multiple choice question. It is asking us to find the number of cards for each of the three women, then the total of the cards of the three women. For example, we can find total number of cards for Janet, Brenda, and Mara first. Then, we can multiply those number of cards, to obtain total number of cards in the three women.<n><n><n>```<n>Janet has 9 cards<n>Braden has twice as many cards<n>Mara has 40 cards <n>```<n><n>These questions are using number line to ask us to find the numbers that we are not given. In the first question, one of the number is 150, which is given. The rest of the numbers in the number line are asking us to find. For example. <n><n><n>```<n>4 * 150<n>450 * 15<n><n>4 * 10 + 4 * 5 + 4 * 3 + 4 * 2 + 4 * 1<n>```<n><n><n>In the last question, a number is missing. In order to find this number, we can use the following two approaches. In the first question of the multiple choice part, the three students, Janet, Brenda and Mara can represent three numbers. In the second question of the multiple choice, there is one number missing in the number line, 50. Then we can use both the previous approach. By adding these two cases, we can find the total number for the final answer.

In this case each of those numbers is $415/4 = $103.75.  So, the whole thing is the larger amount plus (103.7 * 4).\n\nThere are 102400 milliseconds in six and a half seconds.  Each millisecond lasts one thousandth of a second, so the question is asking for 100*1024  (10240 times 10).\n\nIn order to multiply 183650 by 6 he would simply multiply the number by 6. In the example this would equal 112400.  So the result is 4291400.\n\nThe second half of the question asks for 4291.4 multiplied by 100.

So the solution, 6 = 1.833%.\n\nThis is similar to the first question.\n\nThe denominator, x, is the total of the denominators for the fractions as a whole.

{"text": "E\n\n###### Explanation:\nInstruction:In this question we're asked to calculate the price of the car. The first thing that came was calculate a 1-week price of $190, so since the first week is only one week. Then, you can subtract the $190 from the total cost, which gives you $310, since the total cost is $500.\n\n###### Exemplar Solution:\nInput: The car rental charges $30 per day, and $190 for all the days or for all the weeks they will rent the car.\nOutut:\nSuppose 1-week rental gives daily rent to be $190/7 $27.14\n\nSo $30 is total rent for 1 week = 1 week X 30 $30\n\nThen $30 = $27.15 + 190\n\n190 - 30 or $160 \n160 = $50 - 1 or $49\nThe rest of the cost is the amount that is left $49\n\nSo $310 - $190 = $120 \n\nInput: The hurricane is approaching and he is planning to move away for 60 miles/day.

She spent $750 X 7.5 = $562.5\nInput: First part subtracted, what's left is $700 and then the rest of the bill is $150/2 or $75, so $750 - ($700 - $75) = $200 or $700 - 200 which is", "answer": "A: apply for job"}

Each name is given once in each line, so they may be mixed up.\nEach name is followed by a semicolon and a space, and is followed by the number of hours taken by the person to reach the destination, and a semicolon.\nThere will be a total of 10 persons.

(N being the number of persons so we have to subtract 1 to include the initial index from the beginning)\n- Once the number of hours is entered, we calculate a difference between N and the time taken to travel the distance.\n- Then we have to subtract this difference to N +1 from the end.\n- Once it is lesser than N +1, the person name has to be put there.\n- Once, the first item with the given number of hours is passed, N is incremented and we start searching for the next person, while the second item", "answer": "A: mail orders"}

In other words, your first day is between 0 and 2, your second day is between 3 and 5 etc. Explain in the comments below how you would build the 2-D graph by creating a list of tuples, where the first number of the tuple represents t1, the second number is t2, and your last number is the value. For example, if you found [t1, t2, t3] to be [1, 3, 6], your graph would have the data point at (1, 3) because that is the x-y location of (1, 3). If you\u2019re struggling explaining the data structure, I\u2019ve provided a hint in the comments below.\nOutput: [{4, 1, 1}, {1, 2, 4}, {2, 3, 7}, {3, 4, 9}, {4, 5, 11}, {5, 6, 13}]\n\nInput: You\u2019re asked to create a 2-D data structure that will allow you to query two variables using either an x or a y coordinate, to allow for either horizontal or vertical data sorting.\n\nThere will also be times you need to find data in between values, for example; 6-8.  In other words, how many numbers are in between the values you pass in a function.\n\nThe data structure you create must be able to accept either x = 2/2 or y=2, depending on if an x-axis or y axis is requested.\n\nYou may create a new data structure if you want. If you do, you must also be able to convert a 2 point coordinate to a 1 point coordinate if necessary.\n\nWhen working with the x value, the first number is the x and the 2 remaining numbers are the values to search, while with the y value the roles change (the 2 numbers are the x's and the first number represents the value to search.)\n\nOutput: [{y: 2, x: [\"1\", \"3\"]}, {y: 3, x: [\"3\", \"5\"]", "answer": "C: ignorance"}

They are known as the TrogDragons. They won their latest fight without harming a single civilian.  Their success is attributed to effective communication between the two.  Each battle the TrogDragons have fought can be characterized as a battle to get the opponents to move from being closer to one side of the town gates to being near the opposite side.  The two battle from opposite sides of the gate, where one side is closer than the other.  The winner is the side that moves the other side to be closer. One battle is characterized by the length of the route between the two sides from the gate to the end point. The route is represented by a number line. The length between the two points is called the distance, and is measured in units of distance. The first TrogDragon battle had a distance of 4 units. During each battle, the TrogDragons meet somewhere along the path. They try to convince the opposing side to start marching. By convincing, the TrogDragon is trying to tell the opposing side that they should move along.  Their strategy is to tell a story or to show a special trick, or a combo of the two. For each such strategy, the TrogDrago has a limited number of moves, called steps and one move always costs them a unit of distance traveled. For every move the TrogDragon can talk for one step as well as for one or more moves. At the end of those steps, the total distance moved is measured and the battle is won by the side that has moved farther. The opponent is always closer to the gate at the beginning of the battle. The goal of the TrogDragon in the battle is to get across to the other edge. The opponent cannot go farther than the TrogDragon, if it gets to a point where the TrogDragon would have", "answer": "A: read"}

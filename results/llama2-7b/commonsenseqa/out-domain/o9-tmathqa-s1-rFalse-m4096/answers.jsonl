The squared error function is based on squaring the absolute error between the predicted and actual values. The squared error is thus calculated as 0 if the prediction is exactly correct and as the square of the expected error if the prediction is in errors or not.\n```\n\n**Mathematical equation:**\n\n$$\\mathrm{E}[\\mathrm{Error}_p] = \\left( {Y_i^ *, x' - \\mathrm{y}_i^*} \\right)^2$$\n\nInstead a common practice to calculate the standard deviation in the squared error.\n$$\\mathrm{Stdev}[\\mathrm{Error}] = \\sqrt {\\frac{{\\sum [x'-\\mathrm{y_j}]^2} }}{n-1} $$\n\n\nThe following table shows the error function on some examples:\n\n\n\n**Example 1**\n\n| Input | output |\n| ---- | ------ |\n| 100 | 100 |\n| 211 | 111 |\n| 7 | 7 |\n| 98 | 98 |\n\nThe predicted value in is not restricted to the range of the data so the squared error function is applied.\nUsing Excel, we can calculate the predicted values for:\n\n$$ \\mathrm{\\hat x} = x' - \\mathrm y^*$$\nThis gives us: $\\begin{array}{l}100, 0, 7, 80\\end{array}$\n\nThe error equation is: $\\mathrm\\begin{array}{l}(\\mathrm y", "answer": "C: chinese food"}

The A* (pronounced \"A-star\") algorithm was introduced in 1968 by Edward A. V. Robinson and Kenneth C. Seeger to solve the general-purpose path-planning problem. It is a graph search technique that is an extension of the Dijkstra's algorithm, which is used to calculate shortest paths between vertices in a finite directed graph.\n=======\n\n#### # Question 1\n\nThe best order of operations to evaluate if x > y, z > w and x < z is\n\nI. if (x > y) and (z > w) first else if (x > z) and (w > y) \n\nII. if (x < z) and (y > w) first else (x > z) \n\n##### Answers\n\nI. It works because of the operator precedence. We can write (x > y) & (z > w) as (x > y) || (z > w), then evaluate that first, so we evaluate \n\n(x > y) || if(x > z) && (w > y) but if (w < z) we skip that branch\n\nBut we first evaluate if (x > y), so the first expression evaluates to T and the second expression evaluates to T. So T, which is not equal to 0.\n\nII. (x < z) || (y > w)\n\nIf (x < z) is true, we have done nothing, so the result is false, which is not T. We could have replaced (w > y) with T and the result would have been T. If", "answer": "D: ground"}

It may explain why something is true by simply restating the original position and giving reasons to support them. Critical reasoning is a style of communication that allows you to make your own conclusions rather than relying on somebody else to provide them for  you. It includes questions of whether something is true, what it means, how it works, if it\u2019s right or wrong, etc. For example, if somebody said, I saw a man with a gun and he didn\u2019t seem like he was going to do anything but it turns out he did shoot somebody; then he must have shot them accidentally. The following argument would be considered critical reasoning: (P) If he saw it happening, he would\u2019ve felt bad about it. (C) He felt bad. (Q) He shot somebody accidentally. \n\n\nYou can practice critical thinking by reading", "answer": "E: plantation"}

{"idx": 780, "text": "B.upper hand\n\n### Instruction:Answer the question as mentioned in the question. The output will be in the same box.\n\nIn programming languages, variable is an entity that stores an un-defined value. Dates and time are un-defined and they can also be stored in a variable.\n\nA variable can be of fixed type like char in C and int in C++. But a variable can also be declared as variable type. It can have a data type as small as int or a very large one like long long. So, the variable can hold a large value.\n\nA variable cannot be accessed directly using it's name. The name is used to identify the variable in a function or any other part of the code. When used in a statement the name of the variable is preceded by a dollar mark and the value is assigned to the variable. It can also be passed as a parameter or it can be a return value from a function. To access these values, we need to use the dollar mark, the name and the value that are in the variable.\n\nA function can have one or more variables and all of those need not be used. This is called argument of a function. Functions take values as an argument and the values are assigned to the variable in the function.\n\nSince value of a variable can be stored in anything, a variable can store a number of values which is called scoping of a variable. This is the process which is used to hold and use different values in a variable at different places. We can call it parameterized values in C.\n\nVariable can be in 4 states:\n\n1. Uninitialized - variable can be assigned a value, or it can be initialized.\n\n2. Initialized - variable is having a value and can't be modified.\n\n3. Undefined - variable doesn't have a value.\n\n4. Modified - variable has been assigned the value in the current statement or the value has been overwritten in the current statement\n\n##### Instruction:Answer these questions and paste the codes.\n\nQuestion 1: Create a variable x. Type in the following lines to assign value to x.\nvar x = 10;\nQuestion 2: The value of x is now 10. Now change value of x to 17 and write down the code: x=17.

The wagon-wheels clattered over the stones and the ruts in the dust, and then clattered again. The animals passed through a line of wooden barriers. All at once the wheels were silent: they had passed beneath an archway, with two stone posts on each side of it, and beyond these posts there was a path-way that sank and sank beneath the wagon, and again rose as it passed over and over again. \"Stop! Pull up!\" Then there came sudden silence. \"What is it?\" \"A river... the Arno.\" \"Good! This makes our path-way shorter. On, my children.\" The horses started off again, and passed through another series of archways, but with less noise, for the wheels found a hard surface and were rolling rapidly. In every direction through the clear October twilight were visible arches with black beams and pillars, and beneath them the ground sank and rose and then sank again, and still there was a constant thudding and the sound of the horses' feet. At last the carriage went round a corner, and then once more with a clatter the wheels rushed beneath an archway. \"A river, surely?\" the driver asked. The captain turned around, and, catching sight of the eager countenances of the peasantry, he smiled. \"Yes, that is it,\" he said. \"They have turned over the river, you see.\" The young fellows stood looking in silence at the wide expanse of water, but not a word was spoken by the people in the wagon.

Therefore, the price for renting the car for 11 day is 10*30  or $20 + 70 = $90  \n#### Explanation:To go to higher ground will take 60 miles per day, so it will take 60 hours for the journey.\n#### Explanation of solution 3:For a week they need to pay $310(11*30) by using the multiplication rule to  find the total sum of 11 days and paying in dollars and they need to pay $800 20*4 + 500*(20-4)=800.\n#### Explanatio of solution number 4:If we plug in the variables and divide by the common factor we will get the equivalent ratio and then solve it using the cross multiplication. In this case the variables will be 60,3,5,24,12,8,4. Cross-multiply by 2, we\u2019ll get 104 by multiplying and 10 by dividing we get 24 and finally the equivalent ratio for the problem is 5:8.\n#### Explanatoin for solution number 3:The cost by renting the place for (14+20) days is 500(14+20).  We have to simplify it to see that we have to pay 600 dollars per week and that is why in total we would pay (14+21) + 600 (14+2) weeks for 14+20 days which is 800 + 1200 dollars in total which is 200", "answer": "D: moving"}

After reading the question the first 3 steps should be clear. What we require is to select the correct amount from 5 choices given between 1 and 5. This can be made by writing down the choices and then find the lowest digit at the back(1-5). Here the lowest integer is 1 and hence the answer should lie between the intervals of 1-4. Now the 2nd step would be to multiply the question given by 5. The output should be 3 and if the value obtained at step 3 is less than 5, then the answer is correct. In the case of this code it should be considered as 1 as 1>3.", "answer": "A: drill"}

Choices: Choices: $3.24E38 $3.2438 $3.00280 $3.2408 $3.20380\nOutput: 3.243926E+38\n\n## Explanation:\n\nThis is an interesting question involving number operations in a simple form where there are some complications.\nWe will start calculating by removing the $30 in the first part of the question and replace with a variable. The rest can remain as $190. The rest of the computation can go through as normal. For the final price, replace the $190 with $150. So we just need the price minus the $30 which will leave us with $150-$30=$120.\nWe can write the second part of the question the same way. Remove $30 after adding it.\nWe will get,\n3 * 60 = 180. Now replace it with a variable.\n$30*11 = 330\nTake away 330 from $390 which  left us with $160.\nMultiplication is always done first like in arithmetic. The result of it is then used as factor in the exponent to give a more specific value. Exponent is always done after a multiplication. So the result should be $160*(30) which should give us the correct answer as we know that answer as $480.\nThe third part\nwe will multiply and then we will move the decimal the way the instructions did. 50 * 101 = 5,050\n$5,050  * 0.25 = 1262.5\nwe need to subtract 1262 from 1500 to get 230.8. There is no need for the comma after the 1500. It is a general rule of reading out loud. It is to make it easier when multiplying large numbers and to avoid the misreading.\nSo the answer is 230.\nWe must do the fourth part similarly. Except for subtraction,  subtract $5 instead of $60 we", "answer": "C: underwater"}

{"idx": 859, "text": "C\n\nInput: The cost of a car insurance policy for a one year period depends on a number of factors: gender, car make and model, and the driving history of the insured driver.\nThe insurance company for a driver named Jack decided to make rate adjustments based on the gender of the insured driver, as well as the make and model of the car driven.\n\nThere are two categories of cars: Sports Cars and Minivans.\nFor car insurance purposes, a sports car is any model that has \u201cSport\u201d, \u201cGT\u201d or \u201cSuper\u201d in the name, as well as any vehicle that is designed as a race car, is powered by dual or quad turbocharged engines, and has at least four seats.\n\nThis definition is not without gray areas. For example, the 2016 Audi R8 is a supercar and is therefore expensive to insure, but so is the 2013 Mazda MX-5 Miata, which does not meet any of the above criteria (unless one calls being a \u201csports car\u201d a gray area). Still, no car manufacturers market the Miata as a \u201csuper\u201d car or race car.\n\nMinivans on the other hand include any vehicle that has been specifically designed to carry around 6 or more people, usually in the back seat, and can seat less than 8 people if it is intended to have a driver and front passenger in the front seat (for example, minivans may have four or fewer seats but most have five or six).\n\nFord produces minivans, as do Toyota, Honda and Nissan. Hyundai and Kia also produce minivans and some classify those as cars.\n\nBy far the majority of cars in America are neither sports cars nor minivans. They are sedans, hatchbacks, SUVs, and trucks. These classifications will not impact the insurance premium, but will be used to track statistics such as total number of cars on the road.\n\nFor insurance premiums, men pay more than women, so they are not considered identical. Additionally, the insurance premium varies by car make and model based on the previous 5 years of data. Insurance rates for drivers age 25 or younger vary significantly, depending on the car model and gender. The rates vary for", "answer": "B: fairgrounds"}

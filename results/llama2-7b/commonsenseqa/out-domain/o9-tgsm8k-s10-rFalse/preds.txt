After 4 hours (which is the maximum period that the meter can calculate), the meter will reset to zero hours and the payment will be doubled. The city of New York has 1,000,000 residents. The city also has 1,035,000 parking meters. 20% of the meters are able to accept credit cards, 20% are coin-only, and the rest are able and willing to accept other forms of payment.

Thus, total amount of the purchases is $66.<n><n>**input 2**: Johns goes to gym 3 times, with 1 hour(90mins) each day, 33% of lifting time is warming up. So, we got 82(90x3x33%), which is 82mins. Thus, total time spent at the gym is 172mins(82+82+90) or 1hour 72mins.<n><n>**input 3**: James has to refill the plane. 20% of the weightlifting time is warming up and the weightlifting time went up by 2.5 times. So, we have to solve 175(9x90x33%) and 25(90x3.125x33%), we got 152.975mins. Thus, he now pays $152.98 for refuel.<n><n>**input4**: If the two players scored the same number of goals, then the total number of goals is (x+y). Then x*((x+y)/2) = 0, thus we only have x = y = 15. That means the last one of the input is incorrect.<n><n>**input5**: 8(12+64) = 36 ounces<n><n>**input6**: The number of hours to fill up the truck is 6, so the number of people is (6/2). Then we need to find the first number of people needed to fill it, thus the time to fill it is (0.5*8) + (6/2). Thus, the answer is 6 hours.<n><n>**input7**: Tom drink 5 * 12-oz * 30 = 1800 ounces of soda. 64 ounz of water is

First we find the cost of nuts.<n><n>Then the total cost will be 12*3+8*2.5=100+20=120<n><n>B.  I will divide the problem into small chunks and answer it.<n><n>The total time spent in gym would be = 3*60+180*(1/3+1/3+1)<n><n>As 1/3 + 1/3 +1 = 2/3<n><n>So we would have 180*(2/3) =120<n><n>C.  Let us first of all divide the costs of fuel before and after in two parts.<n><n>Prev costs = TotalCosts / 2 Prev costs would be 400<n><n>New Cost = 500*1.2 = 600<n><n>D. We calculate the no of goals, 14% of 298 = 41<n><n>No of goals = 2*41 = 82<n><n>E.  We will use equation V+W=VX+(Wx)<n><n>First we find the total volume, 5*12 + 64 = 860<n><n>Then multiply it by 0.25, which gives us 215<n><n>Then add the two values, 860+215=1075<n><n>Then add 3*4*0.25 =

I'm looking for your effort and your thought process. Let your code be clear and concise.<n><n>### Programming Problem Solving Techiniques<n>I will share with you the techniques I used to solve some of the problems, they do not have to apply to solve all of them.<n><n>- Using the code as a starting point.<n>- Pair programming, this is where two people work together to write a code. One will act as the driver whilst the other one will the navigator. So the driver will write down the code while the navigator will try out any inputs or outputs and direct the driver on what input or outputs are missing.<n>- Use the following techniques for the multiple choice questions.<n><n>1. **Examination** - Look at the inputs and outputs for each multiple choice question then come up with a possible solution, write your solutions down in chronological order then try each solution using that many inputs and outputs. <n><n>2. **Clarify** - Ask some clarifying questions, if its a multi-part problem ask some clarification questions for each part.<n><n>3. **Comparing Solution** - You can also compare your solution to any solution already written and see if any is better than yours and if not make adjustment.<n><n>4. **Revisiting** - You can also revisit the multiple choice question after you've solved all of them, some people skip certain question and come back to solve them after answering others only to find out they got it wrong the first time. <n><n>

Choices:  A: michigan B: wyoming C: mississippi D: tennessee E: mississippi<n>Output:		B<n><n><n><n>#### Solution:<n>Instructions: <n>* 1.  We simply sum the two costs, and then use the remainder operator.<n>* 2.  The total hours is equal to the total time of the lifting plus half the time to warm up and half the time spent on cardio.<n>* 3.  In each division problem we sum the dividends and divide by the divisor.<n><n>* 4.  The two players with an equal number scored goals must have both scored the exact same number. Therefore this is easy. (400 / 2 = 200, 400 / 3 = 133, 400/2 = 202).<n>* 5.  He drinks 5 * 8 ounces per 12-oz. can = 80, and 5 * 16 ounces of water is 80. That is 80 combined with what ever is left.<n>* 6.  The total hours taken can be found using the equation (1,56,8,15), where 1 is the two person time, 5 is the individual time, 8 is number of people, 15 is the time to fill the truck. That is used to find how many hours it took the two, subtracting it from the sum of the other people and then that total is divided by the initial number of people to find the answer. (39, 38, 20, 6.6, 1.66), where 39 is the individual part of (1,2,1+6)=9, 38 can be found in a similar manner, but to find the time left from the initial people of 20 we use 40-20 which is 20 (20 *.45=8.9);.45 is derived from 1/2 the sum of (1,1,1+3+2+2), which is 1+3+2 which equals the four people working at the same time).<n>* 7.  It is important to use this equation as it allows us to subtract all of the working people. We can then sum the working people. To get the working time of an individual, we simply divide each person by the number of all the working

Choices:  A: study philosophy B: become adult C: ask questions D: further education E: study together<n>Output:		D><n><n><n>### Instructions:<n>Solution:<n>1) The student must use divide to figure out how much the food purchased is worth. He must take out the cost of nuts and then divide the amount left by the amount of fruit to get the final amount worth.<n>```<n>1kg of nuts = 12x3 = 36<n>```<n><n>```<n>1kg for fruit = 8x2.5 = 20<n>```<n>```<n>Final amount worth = 166<n>```<n><n>2) The student must multiply by 3 because John works everyday at the gym.<n>```<n>12*75 = 875<n>```<n>2) The student would have had to divide the amount previously got in the last question, by the amount of nuts and then take 125 out. The number should be 25. Then he would multiply by 12 to get the total fuel used.<n>```<n>575 x 12 = 6900<n>```<n>4) Use a formula for fractions.<n>```<n>(number of goals against Barca) = 0.2*(total goals in the league)<n>```<n><n>```number of goals against Bar = 20x2 = 40<n>```<n><n>5) The answer is based on the students understanding of fractions and simple mathematical calculations.<n>```<n>250 + 250 + 590 + 59 = 40<n>166 = (40 x 4)<n>6 + (40 x 2) = 166 minutes.<n>```<n>Thus showing students understanding of fractions.<n>6) The student must figure out the number of cups the two drink by dividing by the 16.<n>```<n>38 / 16 =2.43 = 2 and 4/10 of cups.<n>```<n>166 / 16 = 10 and 6/8 of cups.

Choices:  A: new york B: whorehouse C: street corner D: corner of two streets E: brother<n>Output:		Prostitutes typically work alone. One of the many ways to find them would be a corner of two streets. However, there is ample reason to think that such spots are unreliable: they are frequented by a variety of streetwalkers, many of whom are also likely to be professionals. These kinds of streetwalkers would not advertise their occupation for fear of exposing themselves to the dangers of organized crime. As a result, the only people likely to know of the prostitute's presence are those who have a reason to know more than the general public, and they will keep that information to themselves.<n>

In 1992, states imposed a viability cutoff of 28 weeks, except when the life or health of the woman was at stake.

There is a 60% chance the rain won’t fall if there’s snow in the mountains at 6am.

We mistakenly thought that nuts cost $12/2.5kilograms, therefore making the total cost $54. <n><n>In the second challenge, we incorrectly calculated how many hours Tom spent drinking 512 oz. of soda and 64 oz. of water per day. We mistakenly calculated x to be 3.44 hours,  instead of 4 hours.<n><n>In the challenge for filling the truck, we multiplied 720 with 2 hours. This calculation was wrong as it should've been x = 720 x 4 hours/per person.<n><n>In the last challenge, the number of widgets, x, were incorrectly multiplied by 3 to obtain the answer of 1000, when in actuality, x should be 900.<n><n>### What You Learned<n><n>Here was something I learned: "You get what you expect" in the above example. I thought the answer would be 270 instead of 360 because my expectation was for 50x to be 500/2 instead of 40x to be 100/

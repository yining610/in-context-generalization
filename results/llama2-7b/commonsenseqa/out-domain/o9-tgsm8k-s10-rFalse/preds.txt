Option D is incorrect since that is a major intersection and nobody is probably standing there. Option E is incorrect since most intersections have a stop sign instead of a red light. <n><n>

He loved the idea of going to mars, and reads books about it all the time.   He dreams of being on what? Choices:  A: love B: zoo C: school D: space shuttle E: library<n><n>### Response:		A library<n><n>### Reasons:<n>Jamie loves books.  They are his best friends that he can always rely on.  He would rather spend time with books (either in the library or his own collection) than with his friends or even in school.  <n><n>### Relevance:<n>The question was asking what he loved, not who was his most important asset or friend.  The fact that the answer included both words "love" and "school" is an indication that it is a possibility. The school word could indicate that he was talking about space (like a school of fish) or simply a school that has nothing to do with what he likes. The word "love" does not necessarily refer to something that he likes.  It could also refer to someone (like a lover on Earth) whom he loves (and does not necessarily like).  If "love" had no bearing whatsoever on the answer, then the answer would have been one of the last four.  The fact that "love" and school are both involved in the answer, albeit in small amounts, makes "school" one possible choice.<n><n>

Choices:  A: body of water B: lake superior C: underwater D: toilet E: aquarium<n><n>### Response:		<n>A<n><n>## Solution:<n>We have a few of these questions that ask us about 2 different values:<n>`1)` how many hours does he spend on the bike?<n>`2)` how many pounds of nuts and dried fruit`?<n>`3)`how many cups of liquid does the two boys drink yestedday`?<n>`4)`how many cups would he have at each meal`<n>`5)`how much will Queenie receive`<n><n>`6)` How much time do fish spend under water`<n><n>In each of our questions, we do not know how much one of the values is or what type it is. However, we do know the relationship of how much one of which type is. This means that we can write a function that will calculate the answer for us. The general guideline for most of these question is `x * z`<n><n>So for the first question, we know that we are adding 3 pounds of one item and 2.5 pounds of another item together to calculate the total weight of things that he purchased. This is simple to do if we are looking for the pounds that he bought. For example,<n>`total weight = 3 * 12 + 2.5 * 8 = 45. `<n><n>The second Questions are just another form of a weight question:<n><n>`(amount of time that is spent on one activity) * (days) = (amount of time that is alloted to that activity)`<n><n>For example:<n>`(amount of hours spent doing math * days) = amount of hours alloted to doing homework` or `amount of hours alloted to homework`<n><n>### Questions<n>`1) How much did his purchces cost?`<n>`2)How Many Hours Does He Spend At The Gym A Week?`<n>`3)How Much Does He Pay Now For Fuel?`<n><n>Using the method before, we can find the answer if we can get the number of units that is spent on the activity for the day of the week. However, we do not know the numbers for each day of the week so the question is about guessing the average number of units.<n><n>Our Questions are:<n>`1)` How many pounds of nuts would you buy and dried fruit?<n>`2)` How Many pounds does he eat on the bike?`<n>

Choices:  A: come home B: airplane C: learn from each other D: go out E: make art<n><n>### Response:		<n>In a world where we never know who we are going to meet, being able to know enough about ourselves is the key to a calm mind.  The more we know about ourselves, the more we know how to handle whatever happens.  We then become better at making decisions and being productive.<n><n>Sometimes what we do is not what we need. The people we meet can give us a lot of insights that we can use in making better decisions or even solving problems in our life. To be able to learn from each other makes us more tolerant and compassionate.  <n><n>To make art is to know that we are a part of humanity. Art is communication and through that communication, we may even heal our broken heart.  We can know ourselves better through art because we see that there really is nothing to fear but fear itself.  <n><n>When we feel lost and alone, being able to remember that there is nothing we do not know will be our saving grace. To come home is to lose the desire to look for the answers.<n>### Response:Choices:  A: 10-foot shelf. B: 12-foot shelf. C: 3-foot shelf<n><n>### Demand:Given a choice between shelves of different sizes, will they select a shelf of different sizes? How will their final choice differ if the price is increased by $5?<n><n>## Response:<n>Given a choice between two shelves of equal height, the final choice will be based on the width of the shelves. A 12-foot wide shelf will be preferred at a price of $200, while a 10-foot wide shelf is preferred for a price of $250.  However, both shelves are considered equal and as a result, the buyer will go for the shelf with higher height.  This is an exceptionally strange assumption.  It would be more likely that a buyer goes for a shelf with equal width and height because it means he would be able to get all he can afford instead of settling for what can fit in one of the shelves of equal width.  <n><n>The final choice will not be affected if the price is increased. The amount of money made by a buyer based on his preference as far as the shelves sizes are concerned is proportional to the difference

She earns an additional $5 per hour as overtime pay. How much will Queenie receive for working 5 days with 4 hours overtime?<n>Answer: 770<n><n>### Input:When having food at a formal place, what do you usually do? Choices:  A: sit B: being sociable C: talk D: drinking E: medium<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Instant Pot Instructions:<n>1. To pressure cook using the Instant Pot, put the liquid (water or stock) in the inner pot. If you are making a soup from leftovers or making a clear soup, add the aromatics and the salt. <n>2. When it is time to add food, make sure the rice is rinsed at least three times before adding it. When stir-frying vegetables, be mindful that too high heat will burn the onion. Keep your cooking aromatics separated to avoid burning.<n>3. You can use both a stew pot and an Instant Pot for pressure cooking. They have slightly different internal cooking pressures, which is why their use is not equivalent. When pressure cooking, use less liquid compared to cooking a pot in the oven or on the stovetop. Otherwise, the amount of liquid won't reach the maximum level and the pressure valve will not open.<n><n>4. To achieve maximum temperature, stir the pot a little and check if steam is coming out of the valve. You might have to reduce cooking time if your pot seems to be boiling and it is just not being reduced enough to open the cooking press. If you get to this point, check out the Instant Pot.<n>5. You might want to try out some recipes that have been recommended for use in the Instant Pot. This will give you an idea of the type of pressure cooking that can be done. But remember that it is not necessary to cook your food all the way. It is the steam that is important, since the pressure is already built by the device itself.<n>6. You can use the Instant Pot as a regular stockpot. This allows you to add ingredients, such as spices, when it is cooking. You can use stocks and soups for recipes such as stir-fries and stews. You can then add the ingredients when they have been strained.<n>7. You can also use a separate steamer to cook your vegetables. If you have a wok, you can cook your vegetables in the wok as well. To be able to steam food properly, you need to make sure that the water in the pot is boiling before adding the vegetables.

Choices:  A: fairy tale B: castle C: middle ages D: chess board E: doll house<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The Knight's Move is a chess opening which involves the Knight moving **two or three squares**. The Knight's move can be to any square, if the knight is on the same rank or file. If the knight is on a different file from another knight, in a lateral move, it cannot go to the same file.<n>  On any move by a knight, White and Black alternate the use of the f-row and the e-row, which means that **when the knights reach the first rank they start from opposite sides**. Also, it appears that the knight's move creates symmetry by alternating who gets the e or f row. After each move by the knight, one side or the other loses a pawn, but does not lose the same pawn on the next move, while the other side wins a pawn.<n>When all the pieces are present in a chess game, it is said that the game is ready to move. When that is the case, then the knight's two or three move can be to any spot from which the knight can move. <n>To move the knight from row 3 to row 2 from a different square, we first move the knight one unit to square R3c5, where R = row and c = column. Then the knight moves two units to square R3c4, and that is the answer to the question.<n><n>## Task1<n>

The average amount of 3-legged internet cats born every minute is 8.7.<n>The last minute was unlucky because there was a sudden surge in 3-legged cat births. We experienced an average 8.5 cat births per minute at first, but it quickly decreased to the regular 2.2 cat births per minute.<n><n>### Explanation<n><n>The question describes a task in terms of the number of 3-legs kittens that have been born. What the task actually expects is the average amount of 3 legged cat born within a minute. When the question is written in mathematical terms, as the second answer, the question becomes: What is the average number of kittens born within the last minute?<n><n>This question expects a mathematical calculation, not description. How many kittens were born in the last minute is a very clear and concise question, but we can't get it from the task description.<n><n>### Hint: <n>1. When the question is stated in mathematical terms, and is asked again if we still can't find an answer after we have stated the question, then that is because the question is not defined and the task is not clear.<n>

Choices:  A: weak B: fragile C: forceless D: regular E: flimsy<n><n>### Response:		<n>Glass isn't strong because it has a thin layer of glass protecting the core on the outside.

Teachers do not know what is going on in their classroom. They need to be patient enough to wait to see if they can help a struggling student, or if the student is disinterested and disengaged from the lessons.<n><n>### Feedback:<n>Good job on your response!

The quart he bought cost the same as 4 quarts of milk.  How many gallons of milk?<n>### Response:<n>The quart bottle and the gallon bought together are 5 times the quart, so the quart bottle is 1/5 (or 20%) of the gallon.<n><n>So to calculate total gallons bought, we get $16 for one quart of milk, and one quart is 1/5th of one gallon...

You have 20 packs, so you need to divide them into 2 to get 5 sets of 2-pack (1 pack of 2 = 14). Then you need to get a 2-1 formula to get you 2 packs per week. Then you plug it in to get you 10 weeks. You're 1 pack short, so you'll need the 11th pack of the 20 you have left.<n><n>A: You have 2000 pieces of a certain shape and color and another 2000 of a different shape and color.

(We won't go into the why you would need to know this, but it boils down to being able to do the division in your head later). After doing this, you need to add in the fraction of the other shape + the fraction of the black color. The total number of pieces won't match the

Choices:  A: botanical garden B: doctor's office C: in a sea D: public place E: arboretum<n><n>### Response:		<n>The answer is A, Botanical Garden. The question is "Where would a _special_ ficus be found." The choice is alliterative, and the word "special" implies that the ficus of choice is unique compared to other usual instances of ficus. (You could also make an argument that the answer should be E, the Arboretum, since it is the answer in the question. But the answer is still B, since it is alliterative.) B, Doctor's Office, might make sense if a botanical garden were a place that only held very old specimens with no new plants coming in. That's less likely though.<n><n>### Input<n>The answer is C, "in a sea." The choice is allosematic, and the word "in" in the choice implies that the object of study would be in the sea, as opposed to in a "sea" (i.e being surrounded by water). <n>### Response<n><n>### Input & task<n>Your job is to complete the code based on the following question and instructions:<n><n>Input: A person has 174 lizards, and sells 1/7 of them.

Choices:  A: determination B: upper hand C: superior D: higher position E: skill<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Input<n><n>We can find the answer by using the rule of the competitors position or a person or object that has an advantage relative to others which refers to a competitor to another in sports, work, social life.<n><n>### Possible response<n><n>Let X = total marks obtained by you, and Y = total marks obtained by all other members. Then, x = Y + 5.<n><n>### Correct answer<n><n>X = 22 and Y = 19 and in this, Y + 5 = 22 then total marks obtained by you is 22.<n><n>### Example for higher position<n><n>If we take an example of sports then there is a game of American football. It is one of the sports game. There, we have seven members in a team that is playing in one team if we observe the members or the players who are playing then we see that only three players are making the advantage position.<n><n>In a game of football, there are 11 players on the field; five defenders and six attackers.

Choices:  A: concert B: home C: airport D: college E: university<n><n>### Response:		<n>C<n><n>### Why did you choose that?<n><n>Because it makes the most sense based off of the context.<n><n>### Input. What are two reasons?<n><n>### Dem: The instructions suggest security at colleges and universities.  It makes no mention of any other location where security drives around in golf carts.  Security at events like concerts would be patrolled by motorcycle patrol and cars.   There aren't many  places where security would drive around in golf cats to protect young adults.  Security at concerts would be too chaotic.  And no one thinks there ought to be security at airports guarding young adults.<n><n>* Incorrect answer.<n>*  The cited instructions specifically mention security guards at colleges and universites.  It doesn't say anything about events or where concerts are held.  In fact, I would say that "Young adults" is meant to be a generic category that encompasses both concert attendees and college students.  This is why you won't find much discussion of security guards at airports or protecting concert attendees in university security manuals (other than the obvious and non-contextual answer of "concert goers" for A and/or "college students" for D).<n><n>### Input A: Describe the difference, if any, between a "daily wage" earner and a salary earner when it comes to employment.<n>Answer: The daily wage earner is an employee who is hired to perform a specified task.  Salary earners are regular employees  who get paid more than other workers for their experience and qualifications.<n><n>### Why choose this answer?<n><n>Because, it's the same thing that a "regular employee" would be paid at a salary.<n><n>### Comment:<n>I don't like this answer because it is incorrect.  In addition, the wording is "employee who is hired."  What is the difference between a salary wage employee and an employee that's hired?  In this case, I don't see much difference.<n><n><n>### Input E Incorrect answer.<n><n>### Reason:<n>Because the sentence states a difference between a salary-earning person or a daily wage person.

It's a type of building, not a physical location of that specific item.<n>You definitely didn't see the sword in a museum.<n><n>B: A sword closet sounds like a place where people wear the shirts they don't love very much anymore, and they are kept there with the rest of their closet.<n>Swords are kept in their sheaths and not in closets where they can come under.

Choices:  A: contagious B: wrong C: last forever D: painful E: blind<n><n>### Response:		The phrase "what is love" could be asked in a variety of ways, and the responses could be true or false as they are not specific. For example, if someone asked "What is love?" and answered "it is painful", this answer is technically correct, since both 'pain' and 'love' are feelings. Therefore, the phrase could be used to ask an absolute question (can be answered with Yes or No) or a relative question (cannot be answered with Yes or no). Another way to phrase this question would be "Does love always last forever?" and would need to be answered by someone familiar with the context of the love and time period.

I was inspired to create this test to reinforce the use of functions. I felt that this would be an appropriate assessment tool because it would evaluate many key points that I had taught throughout the 7 week program. I felt that the prompt would be easily understood and that all the students would be able to grasp the concept behind it. This test would be given within the last day of the course to ensure that all of the material that had been covered was understood well. The prompt would ask them to choose a function based on criteria that they were presented. The students would have 20 minutes to work on the quiz and after that, they would be able to complete this assignment on their own time and submit via Canvas for a grade by the teacher.<n><n>The second test that I will be creating is called the Invent a Machine test. It requires the student to come up with an invention. That invention needs to meet 5 criteria:<n><n>1. Have a function<n>2. Be able to store information<n>3. Be able to do certain calculations<n>4.

Plant A requires 3 gallons of water per day while Plant B requires 200 gallons of water per week. Neighboring houses supply the water for both plants. When the neighbor is able to provide enough free water for A, we say that A is water sufficient. But since water is expensive, we only water the plants with free water when water is sufficient for A. In general, the amount of water left to provide to Plant B after plant A is water sufficient is equal to the difference between the amount of water needed and what is available for Plant A. We can also say that the amount of water not needed by A is excess and should be redirected to water Plant B. You are trying to maximize the water provided to Plant B. For n=1, 2, 3, 4, the maximum water provided was 213.5, 1G, 0.21g, 0.202g.

However, the halls are eerily quiet. Anna suddenly notices the gear box in her pocket. She opens the box and looks inside. “Hmmm,” she thinks. “I’ve not been to school here in years. How could I have forgotten something like this?” Anna removes all the gears and puts the entire thing back into her pocket. “Okay, here goes.” She is now certain that nothing should be there. However, Anna can almost feel a vibration behind each of her ears. Suddenly Anna realizes that these noises are coming from her pocket. With her free hand, she reaches into the pocket. She begins to pull out a strange machine with all gears looking at her. “Wow,” Anna thinks aloud. “I’ve never seen this machine before. I don’t even know where it came from. There is no one else around.” She holds it up as the gears begin to glow an amber yellow. Anna feels it shift under her grip. She realizes one thing: the device is not going to stop vibrating without her help. The other thing is the last thing she expected: the machine is trying to escape. What Anna decides to do is try to place the machine in her backpack, which is already quite full. As soon as Anna opens her backpack, several strange mechanical bugs begin to move forward rapidly and disappear into thin air. They leave behind a cloud of blue dust.<n>

Choices: 15 years 25 years 30 years 40 years 50 years 60 years 70 years 75 years 80 years 85 years 90 years 95 years<n><n>### Response :<n>Plastic is a synthetic material made from large molecules called polymers. These molecules are often long chains of smaller units called monomers. When monomers link up they form molecular chains of varying lengths or polymers. These polymers, in turn, form the large molecules and structural materials that make up plastics. But polymers are not very stable when they’re in the liquid (molten) state because they react with other chemicals. This creates the risk of toxic pollutants being produced. That means some plastics can take upwards of 400 years to biodegrade at a rate of about 1% per year<n><n>### Input. How much plastic waste does the oceans hold?

Choices:  A: maps B: street C: catch bus D: city centre E: school<n><n>### Response:		<n>There are many interesting places but, in my opinion, a bus stop is a good one. Since you want to catch your bus, then you should go to a bus station. Moreover, you can get information on maps too. For example, some buses depart at 5 p.m so, you can figure out the time of your trip. In addition, a bus stop is located close to the city centre which allows you to move around the city. Finally, you can buy a book or something you need while traveling. Therefore, a bus station is one of the most convenient places.<n><n>### Input<n><n>In the game the number of goals scored by exactly three players against Barca in the last season accounts for 19% of all goals scored against Barca by three or more players. If there are 20 such players, how many goals did the 20 players score in total?<n><n>### Response<n><n>A: We can find the number of goal per player by the following formula.<n><n>$$ \dfrac{ \textrm{Total number of goals} }{ A \times B \times C } \label{eq:5} $$<n><n>where A, B, C are 3 players.

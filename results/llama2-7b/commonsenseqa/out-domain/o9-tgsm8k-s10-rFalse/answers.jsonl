Thus, total amount of the purchases is $66.\n\n**input 2**: Johns goes to gym 3 times, with 1 hour(90mins) each day, 33% of lifting time is warming up. So, we got 82(90x3x33%), which is 82mins.

So, we have to solve 175(9x90x33%) and 25(90x3.125x33%), we got 152.975mins. Thus, he now pays $152.98 for refuel.\n\n**input4**: If the two players scored the same number of goals, then the total number of goals is (x+y). Then x*((x+y)/2) = 0, thus we only have x = y = 15.

The price is written in the question as \u201c2.5 kilogram of a dried fruit costs $5. How much did his purchase cost\u201d. \n\nTo answer the question and check if the answer is correct, simply add up the cost of the nuts which cost $12 and the cost of dried fruits with a unit of $8 per kg. \n\nThe calculation:\n\nNuts = (10kg \u00d7 $12) + (2.5kg \u00d7 8) = $150 + $21 = $171\n\nFinal answer: $171\n### Question 2\n\nThis question is related to a guy who has to spend time at the gym.

First we find the cost of nuts.\n\nThen the total cost will be 12*3+8*2.5=100+20=120\n\nB.  I will divide the problem into small chunks and answer it.\n\nThe total time spent in gym would be = 3*60+180*(1/3+1/3+1)\n\nAs 1/3 + 1/3 +1 = 2/3\n\nSo we would have 180*(2/3) =120\n\nC.

I'm looking for your effort and your thought process. Let your code be clear and concise.\n\n### Programming Problem Solving Techiniques\nI will share with you the techniques I used to solve some of the problems, they do not have to apply to solve all of them.\n\n- Using the code as a starting point.\n- Pair programming, this is where two people work together to write a code. One will act as the driver whilst the other one will the navigator. So the driver will write down the code while the navigator will try out any inputs or outputs and direct the driver on what input or outputs are missing.\n- Use the following techniques for the multiple choice questions.\n\n1. **Examination** - Look at the inputs and outputs for each multiple choice question then come up with a possible solution, write your solutions down in chronological order then try each solution using that many inputs and outputs. \n\n2. **Clarify** - Ask some clarifying questions, if its a multi-part problem ask some clarification questions for each part.\n\n3. **Comparing Solution** - You can also compare your solution to any solution already written and see if any is better than yours and if not make adjustment.\n\n4. **Revisiting** - You can also revisit the multiple choice question after you've solved all of them, some people skip certain question and come back to solve them after answering others only to find out they got it wrong the first time.", "answer": "D: awesome"}

{"text": "B\n\n\n\n#### Solution:\nInstructions: \n* 1.  We simply sum the two costs, and then use the remainder operator.\n* 2.  The total hours is equal to the total time of the lifting plus half the time to warm up and half the time spent on cardio.\n* 3.  In each division problem we sum the dividends and divide by the divisor.\n\n* 4.  The two players with an equal number scored goals must have both scored the exact same number. Therefore this is easy. (400 / 2 = 200, 400 / 3 = 133, 400/2 = 202).\n* 5.  He drinks 5 * 8 ounces per 12-oz. can = 80, and 5 * 16 ounces of water is 80. That is 80 combined with what ever is left.\n* 6.  The total hours taken can be found using the equation (1,56,8,15), where 1 is the two person time, 5 is the individual time, 8 is number of people, 15 is the time to fill the truck. That is used to find how many hours it took the two, subtracting it from the sum of the other people and then that total is divided by the initial number of people to find the answer. (39, 38, 20, 6.6, 1.66), where 39 is the individual part of (1,2,1+6)=9, 38 can be found in a similar manner, but to find the time left from the initial people of 20 we use 40-20 which is 20 (20 *.45=8.9);.45 is derived from 1/2 the sum of (1,1,1+3+2+2), which is 1+3+2 which equals the four people working at the same time).\n* 7.  It is important to use this equation as it allows us to subtract all of the working people. We can then sum the working people. To get the working time of an individual, we simply divide each person by the number of all the working", "answer": "E: mississippi"}

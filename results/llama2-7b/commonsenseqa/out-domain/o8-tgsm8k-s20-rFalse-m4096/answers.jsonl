{"idx": 32, "text": "A\nAnswer the following multiple choice questions. Input: Tapanga and... Input: Frederick is calling his family on... Input: Lawrence worked 8... Input:... Input: Ali had a stock... Input: Michael... Input: The question asks... Input: Nalani had... Input: Boris has... Input: There are... \n\n### Explanation of Answer\n\nThe question asks \"how many candies does Corei have?\" Therefore, 29 is the correct answer.\n\nThe question asks how much did Freddy spend on long distance calls. It does not specify what type of call this is, but we can assume that it is a local call. This is because it is referred to as a \"local\" call. \n\nWe have the equation 5c + 25c = x dollars. We have x - 5c = x - 25c. Because local = 5c and long distance = 25c. So we can solve for x. x = 30. This answer is correct because the problem states Freddy spent $10 dollars on his call. \n\nThe question asks when he is working, \"how many hours will he work each day if he works the same number of hours?\" This gives us the number of hours he worked on monday, which is 8, then subtracting that by the hours in the question which is 5, we get 3. Therefore, the answer is 3.\n\nThe question states that A and B represent the number of books sold. C refers to A - B or the number of books that where not sold. Therefore, the answer would be 600. \n\nThis answer is correct because this statement states, \"how much money did he make this week?\" This is not specified to be a week with 5 days. Therefore, the answer, 97, is correct. \n\nThe number of puppies would be the total amount of money earned from selling the puppies. From this question, we know that 10 puppys is 200 dollars, 2 puppies is 400 dollars, and 3 puppies is 600 dollars. The total amount would be 60 puppies. So, the total amount of money would be 3000 dollars. \n\nThe second box holds the amount of the", "answer": "B: subdivision"}

In United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, \u00a3 and p are used, and \u00a3 is similar to 19th and 20th century U.S. dollars or the French franc 2003-2005. In Canada, the Canadian dollar is represented as C$ rather than $ as in the United States.\n\nYou might also want to look at different currency conversion approaches. One of these involves the conversion of an input amount into the equivalent amount in another currency (for example, in United States dollars). Another option is to convert output/result values into another currency (for example United States dollars) as your default currency.\n\nB) In this part, you will get one question, with multiple choice answers. The possible answer values vary from 0 to 4. The output value of a question is equal to the multiple of the sum of the product of the answer values and their corresponding inputs.\n\n##### Part Two:\n\nA) In Part Three, you will get many questions, with multiple choice answers - in 1697-1506-12114 format.\n\nThe possible answer values are between 0 and 4, and the output value of a question equals the multiple of the sum product of the sum of all answers of that problem and their corresponding input values.\n\n##### Instruction 2:\n\nUse the 'Partner' to add points to your score\n\n#### Add Partner\n\n-Click on the 'Connect' button from Homepage, enter 'Partner Code' and 'Partner Name'", "answer": "D: blisters"}

You must not use any recursion or divide-conquer methods.\n\n#### Problem 1: Use a single loop that makes use of the sorted() function in the collection.sort() function and the sorted() function in order to return a single sorted list. The sorted function has a return statement. Make sure that you return the value of the single list after sorting it.\n#### Problem 2: Use a single loop only that makes use of the shuffled() command to return a sequence of elements that is shuffled in order. The shuffled function has a return statement and does not return a sequence of elements, rather it returns a new sequence. Return the new shuffled sequence or list.\n\n#### Problem: 3 Make a function to count the total elements in a file.\n#### Problem: 4 Construct a function that searches through two sorted files in one operation and returns the first element that is smaller. The sorted function is also a function that requires that the input elements are sorted in a list already in order from smallest to largest.\n\n#### Problem :5 Make a function to count and return the number of elements that are larger than a specific element by using a single loop. The sorted function is a function that requires that element values of a new list are sorted.

They had a box with 48 pieces of candy for each state. \nEach box had the same number of candies for each state, but the population in each state varied. \nHow many states in America had a population of 19 or less?\n\n### Solution:\n\n$A$ is the number of states with population <$19$. If population in $A$ states <$5$, the corresponding number of candies in $A$ boxes should be $48/5$, 9.6. The number of candy left over after removing the candies corresponding to all states with population <$5$ should be $48-\\frac{48}{5}=59.2$. \nSimilarly, the number of states with the population >$5$ but <$19$ should be $\\frac{48-59.2}{48}$. Hence, there should be $48-(\\frac{48}{9.6})=\\frac{48}{7}$ states with population >$5$ and <$19$, where $\\frac{48}{19}\\times(\\frac{7}{19})\\times(\\frac{7-2}{19})=48\\times(\\frac{4}{7})\\times(\\frac{5}{7})=14.2857$ \n\nHence, there are $\\frac{48\\times14.28}{59.2}\\times\\frac{7}{14.28}=4.75$ states whose population is >=$19$", "answer": "A: new experiences"}

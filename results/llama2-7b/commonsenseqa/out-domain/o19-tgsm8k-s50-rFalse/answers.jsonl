We need to take risks.  What if instead of telling everyone what you will do, you actually just do it first and then let everyone know about it later.  That might scare you and even get people worked up, but I think it's the only way to change things.  What's to be gained from just saying no to everything?  What we need to try to do is figure out what our purpose really is.  You want to help the world but how?  I want to help the world too.  I want to try to fix things that don't work so that more people can have a nice life.  Who doesn't want to live a comfortable life?  I'm just saying that it's probably not our job to fix everything. Just try to accept that.  There comes a time when you just have to take a stand.  We have to take a stand on this.  You want to make money.  Even a huge company like ours has so much trouble making enough money.  We need to find new ways.  You have to find new ways to help the world.  You can't just complain.

The lowest possible value for number_squared is 0, but the code will not run because the body of the loop only contains a line of code that displays the value of number_squared.

Many people may even buy their athletic equipment from their school\u2019s sports center rather than shopping other places. A good definition of this is as \u201can indoor or outdoor place where sports events are held.\u201d This makes sense to me because one indoor sports place could easily have many stores, as they\u2019re all within the same walls. A sports store is just as good, which also serves as the definition of A buy athletic equipment. However, this is a little different than how it\u2019s defined.

How much did the first book cost?\n\n### Input & Response:\nNicholas has three bags that each hold 10 apples. The number of apples in each bag is not the same as the other bags. He has a total, however, of 30 apples in the three bags. If he takes 13 apples out of one bag and puts them in another one, then how many apples does he have in the three bags?\n\n### Solution1\nI first looked at the number of apples in the three sacks.  I didn\u2019t see a number that would work. I then worked backwards, noting the three groups that he has to take 13 apples from, which I assumed was the total of the apples in each bag.\n\nI then had to figure out what the result was on the total after removing the 13.  One idea was to consider what the number after removing 13 would be, as if removing 13 would have a total of 17 apples.  In that case, I would be left with 23 and it would be much more reasonable.   However then I had to work backwards again.  I then just found that I actually had 14 apples in each bag, which was fine.\n\n### Solution2\nAt this point, I knew there would be 30 apples divided by 14, which would give me 2.14.  So I know I have 2.14 apples in three bags.  Then I needed to add apples from each bag, since I have 2.  I then figured out that 2.14+ 2.14 +2.14 = 6.62.  From there, I had to get the answer into one number and found the answer, which was 11.8\n\n### Solution3\nI subtracted the total", "answer": "C: table"}

The 2 above the equal sign is the exponent to 3, so that is why it multiplies. Then it multiplies 4**5. The ** is to multiply. Then the 4 above the equal sign is how many times is it multiplying by. It was equal to 5. Then it adds a parenthisis for each number and then it adds them together.\n\n### Revised Response\nIn the first set of parentheses, the 3 is the exponent and the 6 is the number. The exponent multiplies the number by 2 to 6. Then it moves on to the next parenthesis, 4 is the exponent and the number is 5. It multiplies 2 by 5.

The first thing you do is to identify the function.\nThere is an equation, and the first thing you do when you have an equation is to determine what the unknown value is. Since the first two terms of the equation represent the unknown, and the second and third two terms represent what the variable is not, it stands to reason that the fourth term is the first two terms subtracted from the third term.\n\n#### Now you can solve for that variable.\nFinding one side of an equation and replacing it with that same number gives you that variable.

The function is an equation that has a variable. \"2 + x = y\" the variable would be x and the function would be 10. Let's suppose x is the 8. So we substitute x for 8 in the equation and solve.\n\n### Calculate (with choice):2 + 8 = 10\n\n2 + 8 =10\n\n### This is the correct answer for the first question.\nIf you entered \"9\" as the answer, you are correct.\n\n### Choose A for the second question\nThe first thing you do when an equation is given is determine the function of that equation.

If the number of printer-owners grew at the same rate as the rest of the country, what is the percentage of printer-owners in 2005?\n\n### Output:069\n\n### Justifcation:\nComputer printer percentages in 2002 is 58% Computer prints have not doubled in percentage since 2002 if the percent double then it will be 116% and we need to see what is the total percentages of printers in 2004\n\n### Solution\n\nI am using the mathematical technique of adding the two values of 2002 and 2003 to arrive at the value of percentages of printer owners in 2012.\n\n### Example\nIf there were X number of printers in 58% of all homes in 2003, the total number of printers at that point would be (58%of x). Then if the same pattern was continued, then in 2006 it would be (58+58)/2 that means it's 116 but in actuality, the value is 0.69.\n\n### Math:X=58% of X=58(58) =58(58)/2 =0.69. This is what I am assuming it is at this point but it increases even more in later points. This would still mean that it's 20", "answer": "D: office supply store"}

{"text": "A: stupid\n\nIn a book about intelligence, Stanovich talks about three different kinds of intelligence. Two of those are domain specific. They mean the ability to learn something related to a certain field. A person who is bad at arithmetic might be smart in writing. They are related to how well a person does in school or job. Stanovich also says that there is generalized intelligence or fluent intelligence. This is very easy to understand, in fact, a student that has an easy time learning can learn easily. It takes a lot of effort to do something. That\u2019s why having general intelligence is useful.\n\n### Next, how is general intelligence?\n\n### Demostration:\nThe inability to learn would cause A stupid.\n\n### Input\n\n### Response\n\nThe book says that a person who has a hard time learning stuff and is not very fluent should not think they are stupid. People who lack general intelligence usually think they are stupid. That is because their lacking of intelligence makes them feel that they are stupid, they don\u2019t have any other choice. A lot of intelligence tests test your basic knowledge and how well you can think. They can\u2019t test if you know certain stuff that they don't. Having a lack of intelligence can cause you to think that you\u2019re stupid all the time.  The same problem happened with the person who had a hard time learning geometry in school. He thought that he was stupid because he doesn\u2019t have much in his brain.\n\n### Example 2\n\n### Input 2:\n\n### Demosition:\n\n### Response 2:\n\nThe book said a lot about intelligence tests and how we can\u2019t see where it is lacking.

His father was the chief mouse of the kingdom and his mother ran the sewing circle. Pip loved playing outside, especially at night, as he found the stars to be the most beautiful thing on the earth. His favorite game was hiding under leaves in the meadow at night and pretending to be scaring the other wildlife. Once he jumped out on a rabbit, who promptly jumped back and startled the entire meadow.\n\nSome day a cat saw his jump and was so enamored with his daring that he followed Pip home. Pip found him waiting in the meadow and was excited to see a friend. The cat introduced himself and promised to play with Pip one day. When he got home he called the cat to his house for supper. Pip's friend was delighted but there was a price. He had a long and nasty scar from being attacked by a dog when he was a kitten. Pip's father and mother wanted to do everything in their power to keep Pip from being eaten but they knew there was very little they could do. To keep him warm their mother knitted him a scarf and gave him a coat.\n\nOne day the cat followed Pip to the edge of the meadow and asked to play. Pip's mother told him he wasn't allowed out but it just made the cat want to play with him more. Pip finally had to convince his father. He snuck out and the two of them had a great time playing. Next time Pip snuck out his father let him go. Pip was excited but quickly realized his daring might have had consequences. After a while he didn't snuck out again and the cat stopped coming too. Time passed and Pip was more mellow and had grown up. One evening he was playing and having fun outside when a cat spotted him. The cat wasn't afraid of dogs and dogs weren't afraid of him either but he was afraid of becoming too wild himself. He remembered how his friend had been killed by a dog and he thought of Pip being eaten.

The key is to realize that when Pablo reads a book, there are 150 pages read.  That is 150/year.  The rest is the average for each year of the kids life.  By just dividing 5 for a cent by 150, you get 0.033.  It's rounded to 33/100 of a cent.  Since they earn $3 leftovers, and the book cost $15, you get $5/3 = $1.666. \n\nThe third problem tests your understanding of rounding.  6 is greater than 5 by how many whole numbers.  6 is divisible by 5 two times.  The last problem you must subtract 24 from 40 to get the remainder.  The remainder should show 16.  That is the amount by which each friend has to pay more.\n\nThe forth problem tests your knowledge of ratios.  $70 is the total cost, $10 is per page, and $70/10 = $7 per page.  The friends pay $7 each and then there is the remainder.  \n\nThe last example tests your ability to recognize percentages.  0.7 is 70% of 100.  From there use that value to multiply the original price to get the adjusted total amount made.\n\nThe final problem tests your division skills.  70/5 = 14.\n\nThe penultimate problem tests your ability to round. In the book there are 100 books, so each cakes", "answer": "D: contentment"}

The earth spins anti-clockwise.\n\n### Explanation: If the road runs north south, the wheels will be turning anti-clockwise and that is north-west.\n\n\n### Solution\n\nIf the speed of the car is 35 mph, the rotation of the wheels, which is the speed of the car, is also 35 mph and since the car is going in the east direction, the wheels will start rotating anti-clockwise. North-West means, it will start rotating in North Direction, because all the directions are given in anticlockwise directions, so it will definitely take north as start point of rotation, and then to continue it anti-clockwise, it will take westward direction and then will be taken as north west.\n\nTherefore, the answer is north-west. \n\n\n\n## How many 8 digit numbers can be made up of the digits 0, 1, and 9, if 8 of the numbers can contain at least one one, and", "answer": "B: rejection"}

There was a total of 60 books before and after the missing book, but because of the missing book, there is a total of 59 books. So if each student gets 1 book, then that would mean there is a total of (59/18) books for each student or 3.33 books per student. But if there is a total of only 15 books, then each student still gets 3 books each which is a total of (15/3) books for each student. But since there were 16 students originally, there would be 16x3 = 48 books. But there is only 15 books so to get 3 books per person means that there would have to be 15 books or less so it's possible.\n\n### Input/Instruction\n\nIn a science fair project, there were five variables, where each treatment has 4 different treatments.

That means there were sensors that shut the door whenever a car stopped in front of the garage. In a modern house or building with automatic doors, those sensors would probably be inside the house, not outside in front of the garag.\n\nIf your garage can be opened by an automatic sensor, what other place might you find something similar?\n\n\n\n## Question 2:\n\nThe garag\n\nThe garage had a sensor in front so that when a car was in front of his garage, the doors were automatically opened.\n\nThe house was an old fashioned bungalow house. \n\n\n## Answer 3:\n\nThe garagen\n\nThe garage is a townhouse with an automatic garage door. A townhouse is a row of houses with similar characteristics.\n\nAn automatic garage door is controlled by a sensor that is located in front of the garaget. When a car is in front of the door, the door automatically opens.\n\nThe house itself is old fashioned, not like the houses in a downtown area. The house has a modern garage door system, but it is not a townhouse or a bungalow house type.\n\n\n## Answer4:\n\nA house and a garage\n\nThe garage has a sensor so it knows when a car approaches the garage.\n\nA townhouse is a row building with two or more storeys. If you drive down the drive way of a townhouse community, you will typically see something very similar in both stores.\n\nA town house does not require a garage, but you can find automotive technology used in homes and buildings where the owner wants to be outside the house.\n\n\n##  Answer 5:\n\nGarden\n\nThe garage did not have doors automatically open. So we assume that it was not a building with automatic doors (which requires sensors in front of the building). It must be somewhere else.\n\nThere is an automatic garage that detects any form of traffic approaching the garage.

We have:\nInput:The 2-year-old boy looked at his 80-year-old grandfather and said, \"You're as old as my dad was when you were born.\" What is the grandfather's age?\nAnswer: 81\n\n### Demstration:\nTo solve a problem with year difference, divide the first number by the second.\nFor example, If we can assume that a man is 37 years old when his son is born, then at the time when the son is 2 years old, the father is 35 years old. Or, if a 10-year-old baby is born, it is the age of her father. The problem of solving this problem is to divide 35 into 10 (or 45 into 20) to get the difference in years.\n\nHowever, if the number with difference in years is not a whole number, such as 10 years difference, we need to divide by two. Or if there is 1000 years difference, we can divide it by 1000 first. This method is the same for problems with large gaps.\n\nExample:\nHow old are you when your grandchild and grandson are 1.5 years old and 2 years old?\nAnswer: 62 (9 years difference, divide into 1.5)\n\nExample:\nA 3-day-old calf is born.

{"text": "The correct answer is a \"Trouser leg.\"\n\n### Demostration:\n1) Ferrets are born as hairless babies, naked, blind, and deaf, with an embryonic tail. They will grow their hair, typically within 48 hours after birth. They will open their eyes within another 3-7 days. They will start to leave their mother after a month of age. Ferrets reach adulthood at around 1 to 1.5 years.\n2) A ferret may show signs of being bored: twirling, or spinning about in circles, excessive vocalization, jumping about, barking, restlessness. When this happens, it's a clear indication that it is overly active. It may mean that the cage is too small, that the ferret doesn't have enough toys and activities to keep it occupied. If this is the cause, try providing better toys, more space, more food; this will most likely make the ferret calm down and return to its previous state. If this does not resolve the issue, the ferret may be overactive in general and need to be separated from other animals.\n3) A ferret's teeth must be checked every month or two. If the ferret's nails are too long, the tips can grow into the roof of a ferret's mouth or under the gums, causing discomfort and sometimes bleeding. Ferret's toenails can also break. Toenails can be handled with \"Slice Nails\", \"Blood Claw\", or \"Claw Nibblers\" (all items sold in pet stores). They involve using your hand to pull the nail back and sideways so the ferret may lick and chew the nail off. However, some people report that cats, who have similar claws, and are known to do this naturally may also do the same to a ferret's claws, especially when they are hungry for food. This could also be done with a \"ferret toenail grinder\" product, which can be found in a variety of pet stores. Ferrets will occasionally chew on their own nails, although this is not recommended. Also, a ferret's teeth can sometimes grow too long if the pet is a stray or is otherwise not being fed correctly", "answer": "D: petting zoo"}

What is the loss of water per day?\n\n### Demand (answer):75 gallons\n### Explan: if it is used for 20 gallons for bathrooms this is 1/3 which is 20/3=70 it is divided by 25 plants which is in water means it has to lose 20/70ths of 3 which is 4 because they are using 3/6ths which is 2/3rds of 4 which is 2 gallons of water each day. So 100-75=25 which is lost in plants and animals. To find the amount of water lost per day we have to find the area. For area we multiply numbers by numbers and to square a number is to multiply it by itself which is why they multiplied them by 7 this is how they made it the area, to see that 25 is half of them they did it 7 times to find 25/4=5.5. 2/5= 10/20 which is 1/2. 1/2 squared= 1/4 which is 1/8. 1/8 squared is 1/64 which is 1. which means they lost 1 ounces of water each day", "answer": "C: medicine"}

They don't have opposite ideas. B also has the word \"solo\" in it. Hence, it can't be in a happy relationship because in this society solo refers to be alone or single and not two people together (grief, pleasure, and happiness are all positive states of emotion in this context.\n\nIdeas 2: D) will make you say, \"No, how could that be positive? That's the worst feeling ever!\" You're right...it is. So A), B), and E) are not likely.\n\nThe last idea is: I have to believe that \"abandon\" means to stop talking to them or that the relationship is over.

There are no values that have a value of $0$.\n\n#### Expected Response:\nWe have a number that shows the values on the number line that shows the entire solution to the problem $2x-y=3$.\n\n- At $x$ 0, the function's value would be $y$ 3.\n- For values of $\\underline{x}$ $\\underline{<}$0, the function increases by $\\dfrac{3*2}{4}$ 0.75.\n- For values $\\underline{x} \\geq$ 0, the value increases by $\\dfrac{2}{4}$ $\\dfrac{3}{2}$ 2.\n\nThe sum of the function and one would be $3$ because the two functions differ by $\\dfrac{3}{4}$ $\\dfrac{\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ $\\square$ $\\dfrac{-2(1-\\dfrac{2}{3})}{2}$\n\n### Solved Task:\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: At the mall, if Sam bought a hat for $25, two", "answer": "E: formal garden"}

How long will the drive take?\n\n### Response\n\n17 hours\n\n### Input 2: The total number of miles needed for me to drive to a vacatiion spot and then back to the ctiy is 2338 miles. Add 4 hour to drive there. How long will the trip take?\n\n## Output\n\n18 hours\n\n### Explain why the above answer is correct.\n\nFor this question, when you are thinking about how the problem should be addressed, this can be done in an indirect way and/or a direct way.\n**In an indrect way**\nTo determine if the drive will be longer or shorter than what you were given, use indirect reasoning which is to subtract your total given distance by this time (4.5 and 4) in order to get your total time that you will be on the road.\nFor example, you were given a total distance of 2335 and you subtracted 4.5 from it to get 2330.5. This is then used to solve for the other side to get the answer in time. For this case, 2330 is subtracted from 2338 to get 38 (the remaining miles). Then, 2338 is subtracted from 68 to get 55 (38 more than the remaining number). So the final answer is 18 hours since you add 38 to 55 to get 93, which was subtracted from the 68, which gives you 25.\n\nFor this problem, there were a total of 33 minutes needed to complete the activity and you were given 48 minutes to complete the activity. What is the best time to start the activity in order to make it possible to finish?\n\nI believe this question should be answered in an indirect way where you think about it in relation to 48. For example, start the activity 48 -33 minutes to finish it.\n\nAnother way to solve this problem would be to think about it in a more direct way. We know that 45 less 6 is", "answer": "D: kind"}

It would be too hard to compete against people whose parents were able to pay for tutors. I believe that they'll end up competing in different areas of their lives anyways. They'll try to be the best that they can be when studying but the other subjects they're studying will bring out their natural talent.\"\n\n### Instructions:\nWrite two brief responses for the above student. Respond one time each.\nUse each response to support an alternative answer choice.\n\n\n### Choice: A for Student:\n\nWe don't need to compete about who could be the best. Instead, let's just think of what we could do to be better by doing something different. Maybe, we could study in different places, meet different people, read more books, or play a different sport. Who knows if we end up competing against someone then maybe the outcome turns out unexpectedly and we end up being better friends because we have more things in common.\n\n\n\n### Student:\nI would agree with your suggestion if they were evenly matched in their skills. However, I would try to find ways to beat them at their best and most likely skill, which is studying. If no one else was looking and I had the means of studying all day, then I wouldn't mind cheating a little and getting the best grade. If you cheat and do better than them, then there's really no reason to be friends with them. They're going to be mad that you beat them and that friendship would be gone.\n\n\n\n\n## Challenge\nA tutor works for 120 minutes per week with each of N students to help them pass their math exams.

{"text": "I'm not sure if you are talking about the refrigerator as a place to get _in_ shape? If that's the case, then your best answer for \"get in shape\" is \"A: fridge.\" _Get in_ means to change your body. _shape_ would be referring to the _re_ part of _refrigerator_. Then _fridge_ would refer to the _fr_ part of _fridge_. This makes _fridge_ the best answer.\n\nYou can also think of _shape_ as a word that people add as a modifier to another word that refers to food. For example, you can take an apple and turn it into a \"round shape,\" an \"oval shape,\" or an \"oblong shape.\"\n\n### Input\nThree numbers are entered into an equation. After solving the equation the sum is divided by 0.3. Which number should be substituted for the 0.5?\n\nA: 8\n\nB: 3\n\nC: 4\n\nD: 4.3\n\n### Response\nYou seem to know that when you divide something by a single number, that number cannot be greater than one. For example, you cannot divide 2 by 4, because when you divide by a number, you multiply by the inverse of that number. 4 / 2 is 2 x 2. Likewise, you don't do \"5 / 3\" because the numerator and denominator are the same value: that can't be done.\n\nFor example, if you have (x + 3)(x + 2), you can multiply both sides of the equation by x + 5 to get x^2 + 10x + 15 = 0.\n\nAlso, you learned that if (x + 1)(x + 2) = 0, you are guaranteed to have x = -2. This is because: -2 * -2 is: -1 * -1, which is: 1, and then when it is squared, it is -1.  So you have: 1 * -2 = -2, so x = -2.\n\nSo, for A, you have: 4 * 4.3 = 17.2 < 18.\n\nSo, the answer is B.", "answer": "D: gym"}

This is more of an English question, I think I should write in a way which the tester can understand.\n\nSince the blue box can definitely hold 5, there's only two choices for the blue box, and this problem says each set of each ball must be inside each box.\n\nThe three balls that the blue box didn't hold, can go into the purple box.", "answer": "E: sheet music"}

You can also use estimation in order to make it easier to solve these problems.\n\n### Solution:\nThis is where we have to find out what value is represented in a.  This is a pretty intuitive calculation, but it can be done incorrectly if you forget to do unit division first.  To find the formula for the area of a circle, you have to take two variables and multiply them together.  What are the two variables that are multiplied together?  One of them is related to a, and the other is related to d.  So we're going to start to replace our known values with letters.  This is one of the times where it helps to label the variables.  Let's call a the value that has to be replaced.  Let's also call the d that we have to replace.  So now our equation looks like this: a = ______{d}\nOne of our functions requires us to divide by units.  This means we have to convert to units.  What units are 5?  What units are 2/5?  Let's replace the units with _ and _ respectively so now our equation looks like a = _ _ d.  Now, I want you to guess the units for d.  Did you guess the", "answer": "B: shocked"}

{"text": "A\n\n---\n\nCopyright (c) 2021, ZOEY TURNER\n\n---\n\n### Instructions: Read through this document and answer the questions that follow.\n\n---\n\nInput: The music player in a car has 30 tracks. The user chooses 4 different playlists and then starts listening to the music. The device has a 8 GB capacity. As the music is playing, 1 GB is full and so the player stops playing music. At this point how many GB is left?\n\n### Response\n\n---\n\n17\n\n---\n\nAs the music is played, a constant amount of storage space is eaten away by the tracks. Eventually the remaining storage space will run out and the device stops playing music.\n\nBetween playlists 1 and 2, the amount of space left will slowly decrease. Playlists contain individual songs, but can be considered of the same size for this question.\n\nFor playlists 2, 3, and 4, the amount of space used by each playlist is different and so there is an uneven amount of space usage. Therefore, the device could continue to play 99% of the time and eventually only have 17 GB left.\n\nI answered the question without making a diagram, and only with words, because the question is to be answered with the words that we are given. So, I decided the best way to solve this question was to draw a table of calculations.\nFirst, I determined what the total space used would be if the playlists were ignored.  Then I subtracted the amount of space used for each playlist from the total space used.\nWe knew from before that there was 1 GB of free space at point 1. Since that amount is included in the total space used, I subtracted it from the total space used with playlists.\n\nThis method can be simplified. You could just find the size of the total space used including playlists and ignore the free space.\nSince each playlist uses about 1100 MB (give or take, depending on the quality of the songs and playlists) and there are 30 in the device, the total space used is 3300 MB.\nThis number is subtracted from the total space to find the amount left afterwards.\n\n### Question\n\n###", "answer": "C: listening to music"}

The students responded with an answer from the following choices.  Which is the correct response?\nAnswer: The student is correct!\n\n### Solution:\nEach group of cells in the body has their own set of bacteria that protects and maintains them. The biggest cells in the body are not bacteria, but instead are red blood cells.  Each red blood cell transports and carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.  That is why 80% of blood is red blood cells because the rest of the body needs oxygen!  The bacteria cells protect the red blood cells and the human body by keeping the body healthy by killing invasive and pathogenic bacteria.  In other words, the job of red blood cells is to keep the bacteria in the body from killing the human body.\n\n### Solution 2:\nThe largest bacteria in the human body is the staphylococcus.  Everyone has them in their body and they are not pathogenic.  The only reason staphylococci are not pathogenic is because our body is so well trained in killing bacteria so staphylococcis stay harmless and protect us by killing the bad bacteria!  The biggest and deadliest bacteria is the E-Coli but that bacteria stays harmless in the body and does not cause sickness.  E-coli cannot live without another bacteria or animal host to protect them because they have no ability to protect their own cells!\n\n### InputThe teacher asked her class where bacteria lives in the human body.\nAnswer: Bacteria can live on food and clothing.\n\n### Problem:\nBacteria exists everywhere.

{"text": "The correct answer is Choice D: skill.\n*  The correct answer is choice D. This is because \"the heave he lacked the skill\"  and the options are all related to \"the skill\".\n\n### Input : The old lady didn't want to miss the boat.  If she hadn't gone to the airport, she would have missed the flight.  The captain announced, \"Passengers please board\" followed by \"We regret to announce that this flight has been rerouted to the airport we originally departed from.\" Choices:  A. regretfully B. apologetically C. happily D. sadly E. gleefully\n\n### Response : Choice E. \n\n* The correct answer is Choise E. We can see that the words were written \"passengers please board\" followed with \"We regret to announcement that this flight has been re-routed.....\". From the sentence, we can deduce that captain already announced, so choice A, B, and C are not the correct answer. While for the remaining two choices, since in this sentence there is no word \"regret\" and \"please\", we can eliminate Choise D and Choise E becomes the correct answer. But this is because I couldn't find other alternative sentences and some other choices have similar structure and can choose the correct sentence.\n\n### Input\nThe young lady was upset at losing the game.  Her brother's taunting increased her anger by five levels.  It was an emotional tug of war with one person on each side. The emotionally charged battle took a toll on the participants.  Choices:  A : anger B: sadness C: happiness D: frustration E: emotion\n\n### Response\n\nThe correct answer is Choice B which is \"sadness\". This is because the given sentence is saying that \"her brother's teasing increased her anger by 5 levels\" which indicates she is angry. The sentence also stated that they lost the game in the last sentence, so we can figure out that she is sad about losing the game, since she is \"emotionally charged\".\n\n### Instructions:\n\nThe boy went swimming after the party was cancelled so it would be okay if they were late for sports practice.

The entire Earth is only about 24,900,000 kilometers in circumference.  It follows that the entire Earth receives about 10^13*2321x2.3*20.8 * 244000000 * 24 * 60 * 60 *.156 = 2.31 * 10^3 J of this energy in 15.6 seconds (37 ms, or about 37 ms).\n\n## How to solve :\n\n### First problem\n\nSo if you write the ages into two columns you can simply remove the number 20 and add it again to one of the equations like in this example :\n\nIn this case, if you wrote an age of 13 years, you will always arrive at 12 instead of 13.\n\n### Second problem\n\nIf each book is exactly 150 pagges then you know the difference between the two ages is 20 - that is 20 pages * 150 pages / 2. So we say:\n\n**40%** of 150 is therefore 60%.\n\nNow we have enough information to solve our equation.\n\n150 * (1.4) = (40-20)x100 = 120.\n\n### Third Problem\n\nWe know the answer and we're interested in finding the unknown variable. Our method is to remove the 50 and then divide the remaining amount by twice the original.\n\n### Fourth Problem\n\nIf John ate 3 of the 12 slices of pizza then he would have spent 3 slices out of the available 12 so he'd need 9 more slices in total. And we're interested in the total number of slices left, so we're removing 3 from the total and keeping only 9, so the answer is 9.", "answer": "D: louisiana"}

{"text": "B\n\nInput: It might often be said that there are two sides to a discussion, but what if there are three? In some cases, what might seem like an argument is really a joke. Some debates aren't heated, but if a group is shouting at each other with no opportunity to explain, there's a problem. If there is a serious concern with no discussion, there will usually be another group that agrees on the problem. There are also a large number of people who don't think about the issue at all. However, to debate in a group can be difficult since the number of people involved may change. When a group of people is arguing, there are usually both supporters and opponents, even though there are more supporters. Everyone that is debating needs to listen to everyone else. If they don\u2019t, they may disagree. If everyone listens to everyone else, they will either understand or agree.

The listener might also be uncomfortable, which could make them want to change the subject, so be careful! Also, if the person is not really familiar with what you're talking about, they may take a brief silence as a sign that they should change the subject. Be careful to make sure that nothing is offensive, because if the other person takes offense, the entire situation may change suddenly (and unexpectedly too). You can try to avoid offending by being more careful. However, you might still need to deal with that sudden change of subject, so prepare yourself for that. If you talk about something, it will be easier to stay on track (and you'll have a better chance of winning the conversation). It's easy to get carried away, but it's important to be aware of when you need to stop. It's easy to become over-confident when you talk to someone who is familiar with the topic, but that could be a big mistake as well. If you find you're not really familiar with the topic anymore, it's OK to talk to someone else (maybe the same person) or ask someone else", "answer": "E: healthy body"}

{"text": "E\n\n## My Notes:\n  - In one of the questions i don't get the idea of asking to compare different ages. But after reading the question i realised the question is to determine the ages nowadays, as 40 years from the current year is year 2042, and from the textbook 14 is the difference in ages\n  - For the second question i thought of this equation: $ = \\frac{PageCount}{AmountReadings}$, from that formula i got pages per reading count to be $ = \\frac{AmountReadings}{PageCount}$, and then divide the $AmountReadings$ by $150$ to get reading per reading to be $125/150 = 0.833, which is 83.3%\n  - Here i had to make an assumption that the money he makes and spends is all in cents. So the total amount of cents the kid makes is $15 + ($15 * 0.07) = $22.5$, and the answer is $22.5 - 15 = 7.5 cents. As he wants to add up the money for the sake of saving to buy something, it would be interesting to know what the thing he would like to buy, a snack perhaps? I would have been able to answer this correctly if we were told what the kid wanted to save for, but it's ok.\n  - For the 4th question I assumed the total amount of candles cut out as $15$, and then calculated each length of wicks as $6*2 + 7*1 + 14*2 = 42$,  I noticed that the candles are in a number based sequence, as 5 and 7 are repeated. Also I am confused as to why the total number of candles would be 6 if there were 6-inch and not 7-inch wicks. I guess since the sequence is in a number based sequence it's supposed to be a constant, but i thought it would be a sequential number of length. Also the calculation of the amount saved at the end of cutting the wicks is incorrect, as the amount of money saved, as calculated should be $15*3+14*2 = $49. \n  - For the tenth question i didn't", "answer": "A: under rocks"}

If it is 6 liters, of water, that means that it takes up a one-liter cube. By Cannon's Law, we can see that cubes are filled with water to 1/2 their volume.  But here we're only talking about 1 liter of the pitcher, not the whole pitcher.  So, the amount of fillable volume is 1/2 cubes to the power of the 1 liter cube, or 1/2-cubes x 2/2-cubic = 1/2 cubic. Or, 1/2 liter.  The 5-liter containers take up 1/4-cubes so this container will take up 0.625 cubic. Putting too much of a container in the pitcher will overflow with water if it goes above 1/(2 - 6/5) liters, which is less than a quart.  So, the pitcher can hold 21/13 liters of water.  There is 0.5 meters (cubes) of water to fill the container. Divide 0.", "answer": "B: shocked"}

{"text": "B (Waitress)\n\nInput: A man went into a store and bought a pizza and 4 cokes. When he leaves, he buys a 3 dollar item and has $4.69 left over. What did he buy?\n### Explanation:\n\nThis problem can only be answered using the subtraction properties. We must subtract the first number from the second. Multiply both by the first number to get both as variables, and then subtract from first number.\n\t\n### Explanations\nThe given information is: \"The difference in ages between Richard  andHurley is 20.\" This means that their combined ages is 240. If  Hurley  is 14 years  old,  we know that  Richard  is 20 years  old.The combined ages 40  years from  240 is 380. This  gives answer 128.\n### Explanantion for second problem\nThe given information is, \u201c Pablo\u2019s mother agreeso he pays him one cent for every  page he reads. He  plans to save the money  for some candy.Pablo always checks out  books that  are exactly 156 pages.After reading his books,  he went to the store  and bought $15  worth of candy and  had $3 leftholder.</p>\u201d, \nwe can break the sentence into two parts. The first sentence says that Pablo\u2019s mother allows him to do what he wants. Therefore his mother lets him collect  books that  are 156 pages long  which he  checks out and then goes to the store to buy 15  cents. Second part says that Pablo reads all the books in one night and only he spent 1  cents. Therefore 15=0 if he  only spent 1 cents  and 18=0 if he bought 15   dollars. Therefore the number  of books he read is 18.\n\n### Explanataion for third problem\nThe given information we have is: \u201c Painter\u2019s group of six friends planned  to buy a car.

One travels 45 miles in 9 hours while the other is over the next 6 hours longer than the first one.  After how many hours do the cars leave each other behind?\nOutput:  Hint:  Use 5 to represent the difference between how long the cars have stayed in front of each other by the end.  It's a pretty complicated problem. The time after when they leave each other behind is the difference between how long they stayed in front of each  other divided by the difference between their speeds (30 - 15).  After 5hours they leave each other behind.  The difference between how long  they stay in front is 5.  That's divided by 30 minus 15...  Dividing by the difference between the speed yields the difference between the 40 miles per hour car and the 20 miles per hour car.  40/20 is 2 which is the number of hours after they pass each other.  The time after they leave each other behind, then, is 3.\nOutput:  HOURS\n\nInput:One of the most popular holidays is Black Friday, with a wide variety of deals available.

For the first question, you will be given 3 different numbers and you will need to put them into a ratio and then figure out how old the two boys (Richard & Hurley)\nare 40 years from the current day.\n\nFirst make a ratio of how old Richard is compared to Hurley. It is 8/7, this means that 8 years is Richard 7 years Hurley's age.\n\nIf Richard is 14 and Hurley is 44, then 14/44 which is 1/3. 1/3 * (8/7) which means that Richard and Hurley are 40 years old when they turn 54.\n\nFor the second question, you will be getting a series of numbers and you will need figure out how many books were read after knowing what the total cost was to save for candy. The 150 page rule was given to you so it tells you that the books are all exactly 150\n\nYou need to figure out how much candy will be bought and the remainder money.\n\nSo the total cost of the books is $135 and the 150 page book rule is being followed so you will need to multiply $6.25 (150 * 0.04 = 6.25) to find out how many books are being read.\n\nYou need to find out how much $41.25 (135 \u2013 $94.00) is and figure out the answer which is $11.25.\n\nThe given number of pages was 150, so you will need to divide $11.23 by 150 which will give you $0.075 which is rounded to 0.08\n\nYou will need to round the 0.08 to the nearest tenth (0.1 for you)\n\n0.1 x 85 = 8.5 pages", "answer": "E: get food"}

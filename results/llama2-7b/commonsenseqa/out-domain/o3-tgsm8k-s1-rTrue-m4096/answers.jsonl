{"idx": 181, "text": "As the distance to any state travels further away from the origin the traffic from each state will merge.  This will increase the size of all the merging traffic.\nWhen all the traffic merge together in one cluster at the end you get the peak period of traffic and it's not the merge of 1 travelers from each city but a huge merge of all of them traveling to the single point. (For instance, a merge from San fransisco to Los Angelas and a merge from Los angelas to san fransisco)\n\nTo explain this concept, we are starting the analysis from the center of the expressway.  If the center  we are starting from was a point (x,y).  If the distance from this center (x,y) to (x',y') is X' then the distance to any state that is directly away will be proportional to its distance to (x,y), i.e.\n\n1)If (x',y') is closer to (x, y) it is closer to the original point.\n2)If (x', y') is farther from (x,y), then (x',y') and (x,y) are moving opposite ways\n\nHaving said that the merge from two cities are the distance of x' = x and y' = y.  The merge occurs because the two cities x' and x' in the state and have to travel to the center.  For the merge to occur we need there to be sufficient time to merge.\n\nWhen x' = x and x' = (x' + dx), (X + dx) is the same distance from the center.  When we travel at a constant speed, the distance covered over time is dx so to express the change in distance we need to express the change as dx/t and t is the time spent traveling.\n\nThe distance to all the individual states is the sum of the distances to the cities in each state.  When all the states are expressed for as a distance from the center to their respective city we obtain a geometric sum.\n\n(Let x = distance from traveler to origin x = 0 + x)\nNow that we have the expression in terms of x, when x is the the distance from any individual state we can express the distance as x.\n\nTherefore,\n\n1)\ndistance between the center and any state is proportional to", "answer": "C: american city"}

We need to move to the bottom, because this will be last problem (other numbers will not even come up).\n\n###### Instructions:  Use the above instruction to answer the following problem.\n\nProblem Description:You created a function that takes a string and a digit as input.  If the string contains the digit, and the position of the digit is greater than it's lowest possible occurrence, then you return the new string that has removed all occurrences of the digit starting from the lowest.  If the position is higher, you return the old string with all occurrences.\n\nYou are asked to add a parameter to your function so that you can pass in an optional parameter that has a default of 0.  This default should be set such that when it is passed into your function it will return true if the passed string contains a digit and the position of the returned true match the passed parameter.  Otherwise, pass back false.\n\nA good example of this is the following.  Let's say you pass in '2' for position and it happens to occur 3 times in the original string.\n\nIf you pass '0' as the position, this would be the expected solution returned:  '232'.  This is true because the number '2' occurred 3 times before the digit '3' (3 is greater than the number of repetition of '2').\n\nIf instead we pass in '3', it should return false because the '3' does not occur any more than what", "answer": "B: love"}

Avoiding any problems by ending their own life seems like the obvious solution to them.

If all patrons tipped at least 20% how much cash would the restaurant gain.\nOutput: You must at least tip 20%. Therefore, an employee will earn 10% for just working.  This extra 10% is just the tip. Therefore, they already earned 10% at a minimum.  This means that they earned 33% of the 20%.  That will leave you at 20% of the bill, minus the 33% for the waiter, leaving 20% of $0 = <<20% of $50=10>>10.  The tip for everyone = <<10+10=20>>20\nTherefore, the total amount earned by everyone (the waiter, and the customer) = <<10+20=30>>30\nIf $30 is the total amount earned, the overall customer tip + waiters tip = 33% of $30 = <<33% of $20= 7>>7 which gives you $20 - $7 = <<20-7=13>>13 extra dollars.  In other words, the restaurant will earn $30 in total tips", "answer": "D: unhappy"}

Since 3^2=3^3=<<3^3=9>>9 is even, 3^3 has to be 3^3=<<9>>9 so we can multiply 3^3=9 times to get 3^4=<<3^4=721>>721, which is odd. So we would have 9*3^3=<<45>>", "answer": "A: slender"}

The function will be called in the main as follows:\n\n```\nsumSquareNumbers(10);  //10 elements are provided as input\n```\n\n### Question2: Loops\n\nWrite a function called \"primes\"where the primes less than and including 100 are returned.  Then in its definition you can add a second argument to the function that you can optionally pass to a main function as follows:\n\n\n```\nsumPrimesTo100(2);    //2 elements to pass to sum primes function are passed\n```\n\n##  Programming Exercise: Exam Day Questions (Harder)\n### Question 3: Loops\nWrite a function that adds the numbers 0 through 100, that is, it counts up. At the end if a special case is reached that will add the total count and return it to the caller of the function. Then in its definition you should add a second argument that is a 2-element array that contains a special value such as \"<100 \"in addition to the 0 and 100 numbers to represent the end condition. So calling the function like the following should return the total sum for the given input array:\n\n```\nvar sumTo100=addNumbers(5, arrTo100);\n```\n### Question 4: Loops\nWrite two functions.  The first function adds the numbers 1 through 10 using a function whose name you give to the calling function. The calling function adds another, arbitrary number to it and then passes that argument in to the called function that it just called.  So the function will be:\n\n```\nconst sumNumbers=((arr) => {\n    var sumNumbers=0;\n    for(x=0;x<arr.length;x++){\n        sumNumbers+=arr[x];", "answer": "B: louisiana"}

Her mother gives her a bag of 6 stickers and asks her to create 5 even numbers using the stickers.  How many solutions could her daughter arrive at?\nOutput:  When 5 even numbers are chosen from a set of a total of 20, 20 combinations are possible.  With only 6 stickers, choosing 2 will result in 3 stickers left or 1 combination.  Choosing 4 will result in 2 choices as 2 will be taken for 5 even numbers.  This leaves 3/5 of 6 stickers left in the bag.  With 5 even numbers choices, you must now choose a stickers for the odd number, since there are 1 stickers left from the 6 stickers in the bag.  There are now only 3 even numbers choices left. Each number must be used twice to meet the total of 5 numbers.  This means you will end the numbers by using the same 2 numbers for 2 different numbers.  Since each number can be used twice, there are 9 possible outcomes.  If a set of numbers is evenly divided, and each number is not used twice for 2 numbers, you will have 7 possible outcomes.  Therefore, when numbers are evenly divided, 9/3 = 3 times the number of actual solutions.  Therefore, 7/3=2 times the actual solution.

In the question, it was stated that \"The temperature was changing rapidly, it was cooling down.\" A should have been the only choice you could answer as the Sun changes the temperature as a whole.\n\nInput: A pony express rider in the west was riding his horse at 25 mph and the temperature was minus 4 degrees celcius.  He was carrying 200 pounds of cargo in addition to his own weight.  How much extra energy (per hour) is needed for the rider to maintain 25 mph with the cargo on his horse under these conditions in which he is?\nOutput: For energy on the unit system, we use joules. joules / time x time = final joules.  For 200 pounds on a horse at 4 degrees c, there would be (200 / 5/9) lbs for every 1 degree c drop in temperature. So to carry the cargo we need approximately 22.  To maintain 25 mpg we would need to carry an additional 52 so 72 pounds per hour.  (72 x 25) lbs per hour would be 1800 lbs per hour.  \nSo in energy at 0 degrees c would be (52 x 1800) \n92400 joules per hour.\n\nInput: In math class, the teacher asks, \"What are prime numbers?\"  Which student knows the answer?

A customer wishes to buy a $30,000 car and asks the salesman to give them a discount.  The salesman responds that he can make the discount using a new technique; if he charges $2 for a bridge, then the net cost is equal to $4 - $2 = $<<4-2=2>>2\nIf the client uses the $2 toll bridge, they have a net cost of $2.  If the client doesn't use the $2 toll, they have a net of $4 - $2 - $4 = $<<4-4=-2>>-2\nTherefore, the client's total discount is $1 = <$2-$2>\nIf the client wishes to pay this discount, the salesman can use a second toll, costing $4.

The total sum of sales and the total count of products are correct. The difference is in the count of products by month. This can actually be caused by the fact that the month could be an empty string if there isn't any record. As you can see \"July\" is a valid key even though the value is empty.\n\n#### 2. When you query for sum of sales and total amount of products of a month you will get the same value even if the input has one or more extra values.\n\n#### 3. The total sum is always correct. Any changes the query is making will always result in the output exactly equal to the input.\n\n#### 4. The month with the least days will have the same effect as removing the least day.\n\n#### 5. Adding 10 days to the count of July (which is 16) will make it the month with the least days in this dataset.\n\n#### 6. Querying by the sum of sales (3099) will exclude the record of May because the sales of May are incorrect.\n\n#### 7. You can't access a key when it doesn't exist or is empty (the input doesn't contain the key). This is because SQL is a structural language which means it operates on structures, not on values, and structurally it won't be defined. This can be done for all three queries. \n\n#### 8.

The three feet is three times the height of Mary which is 5 so if you look at it like that Mary is going to buy wood so that she can surround her yard, and three times the height of her yard is the height of Mary ( 5 = <<3*5=15>>15), and a yard contains three feet so a yard times three is three times the height = <<15*3=45>>44.

How many dogs does each cousin have?\nOutput: Dog A: Nine lives - 10 dog(s)\nDog B: Dog(s)\nBased on the information given, Dog B has two pet dog(s).\nSo the final answer will be Dog B's 2 pets + dog A's 9 lives-10 dogs/pet Dog B.\nIn the previous math quiz, we saw that the number of pets increased by 1 for every 1 live lost.\nNow since B lost 0 lives, it means that B will gain 1 more pet for B's dog.\nSo B will have 1 +1 = 2 more pets.\n\nSo based on the math quiz, the original pet of Dog B will have two pets, and Dog A's 9 pets will be subtracted.  We will be given the 9 lives of Dog A, but Dog A cannot have 9 pets; this is because Dog A's pet is already dead.\nThis means that the answer will be that his pet will have 1 less pet.\n\nSo since Dog A lost only 1 pet, it must means that Dog A gained 1 pet.\nAnd now that Dog B gained 2 pets, Dog B will have 2 pet + 1 pet = 3 pets.\nThis means that Dog B has 3 pets.  Dog A has 1 pet less than Dog B.\nSo the number of pets added to Dog A's dog will be the original number of pet, that will be subtracted with 1 less pet.  Dog A has original pet - 1 less pet = original pet -2 fewer pets.\nSince Dog A has 2  pets and Dog B has 3  pets, Dog A's dog(s) will have 2 fewer than 3 pets. Dog A will have two pets - 2 = 0.\nSo Dog A will have two dogs and Dog B will have three dogs.\nInput: John is a math teacher and he has 7 apples and 20 oranges.

For each board that you have to buy, there is a time penalty that is given by the reciprocal of the number of boards that you have. You have $40 to spend on the boards.  How many board can you buy and build?\nOutput: You have only 40 dollars to spend and your boards are 5 per board when your saw is 0%. So if you have just 1 board, you can buy a 5 board and get the cost of 1 board for 40/5 = 8 bucks. You end up with 5 - 8 = 3 bucks to make the 5 board cost of 1 board even 0, which means that without the saw, 1 = 1 and you have $40 of a 5/5 to spare.\nSo for the sake of simplicity, we will add the same board over and over again, which means we end up with $40 of 5 from 5. As a result", "answer": "C: income"}

{"idx": 777, "text": "A marmoset usually does not live in Colorado.It usually lives in its natural habitat, the Amazon rainforest. It may be found on or around other trees as well since it is an arboreal, or tree-dwelling mammal.  (Definition of arboreal: tending to or living in trees) The marmoset may climb down and feed from some distance, only occasionally descending to the forest floor. In the wild,  marmosets are commonly found in the treetops.\n\n#### Solution: I've split this solution into a couple of lines to better understand:\n\nLet\u2019s start by first solving question A, then B, then C, then so on. A marmoset does not usually go to a dictionary. If they did\u2026 then they would know some useful meanings. We can start solving by elimination. \n\nIf _B_ and _C_ are false, then _D_ must be true. However, it isn\u2019t! The marmoset doesn\u2019t usually go to a fly. There is no option to put \u2018fly\u2019 as false.  _E_ doesn\u2019t need to be true and so, we can rule it out!\n\nSo it is \u2018false, false, true, false\u2019 and the answer to _A_ is a marmoset.   \n\nNext, let\u2019s remove \u2018_C_ and _D_\u2019 from the group and try to answer.\n\nIf _A_ is true and _B_ is false, then _C_ and _D must be_ false. _E_ doesn\u2019\nt need to be true, so we can eliminate it. _B_ and _E_ can\u2019t both be true, because \u2018_A_\u2019 and _E_ can only be true if _B_ is false.\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s move on to _E_. If _B_ is true and _C_ and _E_ are false, then \u2018_C_\u2019 and \u2018_D\u2019 _must be true_\u2019.\n\nA marmoset doesn\u2019 _C_ and is never underground, only above it. _E_ should probably be false, so we can eliminate that option. There are some places a marmoset usually lives: the Amazon rainforest, the treetops in the wild, and Colorado, not anywhere else. _", "answer": "D: underground"}

If he ate two full pound box before his moving date, how many full pound boxes of chocolate does he eat each day?\nOutput: Jack ate 2 full pound box of Chocoate after he learned that he is eating only 9/5 box Chocoate per day.\nAfter he has learned about 2 full pound chocoate after he moved in.\n1.Jack moved in before he became a chocolate lover.\n2.Jack ate 2 times 9/50 chocoate per day and 1 time 2 full pound\nchocolate per day =  1time (2 times(9/50)) = 1 time 18/25 chocoate per day\n3. Jack ate 30/3 chocoate on the 5th day, this means that he ate 20/3 chocoates per day.\n4. He ate 9/50 for the days before he moved in =20/3 -20/3 = 0\n5. He eats 18/20 + 20/3- 0 = 28/20\n6.

The moon has 1/5th of our gravity, so if we multiplied the 1/10th loss by 1/5th gravity, then you would lose far less height on this path then Path 2 and you end up landing at the same height you started on.  Since the circumference is much larger than that of Earth, you'll be able to complete the task in less time. In addition, you lose far less altitude on either path than on our beloved Earth.

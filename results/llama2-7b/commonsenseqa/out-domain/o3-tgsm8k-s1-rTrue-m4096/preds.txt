How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: Mary added a total of 7 stickers/page * 6 pages= <<7*6=42>>42 stickers to the 6 other pages.<n>In total, Mary added 3 large stickers + 42 stickers = <<3+42=45>>45 stickers to her journal.<n>Since she started with 89 stickers, she now has 89 - 45 = <<89-45=44>>44 stickers left.<n>So the final answer is 44<n><n>Input: Zach is saving his money to buy a brand new bike that costs $100.  His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Output: If he babysits for 2 hours at $7 per hour, he will earn 2*7 = $<<2*7=14>>14<n>This week he will earn $5 allowance, $10 mowing the lawn and $14 from babysitting for a total of 5+10+14 = $<<5+10+14=29>>29<n>If we add the $29 he will earn to his $65 savings, he will have a total of 29 + 65 = $<<29+65=94>>94<n>The bike costs $100 and he will have $94 leaving $100-$94 = $<<100-94=6>>6 more that he will need to earn<n>So the final answer is 6<n><n>Input: Mark has kangaroos and goats.

Choices:  A: near B: closeness C: here D: proximity E: this<n>Output:		If we just use 'near' to describe 'proximity' and 'near' to describe a'sensor that just reads the distance without setting off an alarm, then the right choice is C.  Proximity is another word for 'near' and a'sensor' that just reads the 'distance', without setting off an 'alarm', is another word for 'distance sensor'.<n>Therefore the correct answer is C<n><n>Input:  A plane is in the sky, and has a fixed radius of <<2.25*104>>225 km that's at <<224>>224 degrees.  It moves at <<782>>782 km/h with a <<1>>1 degree rotation at <<23>>23 km/h.  It is <<2*107>>207 light years from Earth. How long does it take to travel this distance?<n>Output:  <<36726>>36726 years<n>Since the distance is <<2*1.0*107>>1000 million miles, the speed for traveling the distance is 2*1.097*261*0.0025 = 86646<<0025>>25 miles/day<n>Since there are <<24>>24 hours in a day, the time to travel the distance is <<24>>25 days.<n>To convert 25 days to year use the formula year=<<(24/25)*year>>, since we do not know the year, let x = <<(24/225)>>24/227<n>year = <<x*25>>x*25 = 57<<5>>years<n>Substituting the values we get x = 24%225 year = <<24/223>>24/247=24%24>>25year<n>Thus, the time to travel <<782>>0.00782 light years is <<24>>0.0024 years or <<24>>27*4=24<<4>>4 years.<n>So the final calculated time = 36726<<3>>3 years, which is the same as <<782>>

Choices:  A: playground B: mexico C: town D: outside E: world cup<n>Output:		A soccer field is a large uncovered  field made of grass where soccer is played. In the real world, these places are found all over the earth. The players are often called “soccer” players or sportsmen, and the game itself is often called football, rather than soccer.<n>The game is called soccer in the United States, while it’s called football in England.  A game played on or near a large green field is often called a ‘soccer’ game.<n>A soccer field is an uncovered area. The main purpose is to play sports. Soccer fields can be played on grass or artificial turf, depending on whether the player prefers a more natural feeling or a more expensive and controlled experience.<n>The fields are commonly used for sports, such as soccer, which are often referred to as soccer fields or soccer fields. Other sports played on soccer fields are baseball, softball, and basketball. The world cup is the most common sport to be played in soccer fields,<n>In the end, each answer is correct.  The world cup is a soccer field and a soccer stadium.<n>One of the main differences between a soccer field and other fields is that a soccer field requires special lighting during play. The field is covered with artificial turf, which is usually artificial grass. A soccer field often has a 60-yard pitch length of 80 yards or more.<n>The other 3 answers do sound reasonable for being chosen.  A playground is in a park and would never be a soccer field.  A town is built on top of a soccer field.   A mexico (or any country) is located in a soccer stadium not a soccer field. The world cup is also played on a soccer field with other sports played at the same time so is not a separate type of sports field in that it also hosts other sports.<n><n>Instruction:Answer the following true or false question.<n><n>Input:"While you were sleeping I stole the cookies."

Choices:  A: michigan B: map C: american city D: rest stops E: country<n>Output:		As the distance to any state travels further away from the origin the traffic from each state will merge.  This will increase the size of all the merging traffic.<n>When all the traffic merge together in one cluster at the end you get the peak period of traffic and it's not the merge of 1 travelers from each city but a huge merge of all of them traveling to the single point. (For instance, a merge from San fransisco to Los Angelas and a merge from Los angelas to san fransisco)<n><n>To explain this concept, we are starting the analysis from the center of the expressway.  If the center  we are starting from was a point (x,y).  If the distance from this center (x,y) to (x',y') is X' then the distance to any state that is directly away will be proportional to its distance to (x,y), i.e.<n><n>1)If (x',y') is closer to (x, y) it is closer to the original point.<n>2)If (x', y') is farther from (x,y), then (x',y') and (x,y) are moving opposite ways<n><n>Having said that the merge from two cities are the distance of x' = x and y' = y.  The merge occurs because the two cities x' and x' in the state and have to travel to the center.  For the merge to occur we need there to be sufficient time to merge.<n><n>When x' = x and x' = (x' + dx), (X + dx) is the same distance from the center.  When we travel at a constant speed, the distance covered over time is dx so to express the change in distance we need to express the change as dx/t and t is the time spent traveling.<n><n>The distance to all the individual states is the sum of the distances to the cities in each state.  When all the states are expressed for as a distance from the center to their respective city we obtain a geometric sum.<n><n>(Let x = distance from traveler to origin x = 0 + x)<n>Now that we have the expression in terms of x, when x is the the distance from any individual state we can express the distance as x.<n><n>Therefore,<n><n>1)<n>distance between the center and any state is proportional to

You must write code that will determine how to order your list of problems.<n><n>1. This is in order. If it is out of order, your code will assume it is in the right order, and then will ignore it.<n><n>		Problem #1<n><n>		2. If this problem is out of order, we need to figure it out how to fix it, so we need to move down a number so that it is in the correct order.<n><n>		3. This problem is in the correct order, so we do not need to do anything more here.<n><n>		4. We need to move to the bottom, because this will be last problem (other numbers will not even come up).<n><n>###### Instructions:  Use the above instruction to answer the following problem.<n><n>Problem Description:You created a function that takes a string and a digit as input.  If the string contains the digit, and the position of the digit is greater than it's lowest possible occurrence, then you return the new string that has removed all occurrences of the digit starting from the lowest.  If the position is higher, you return the old string with all occurrences.<n><n>You are asked to add a parameter to your function so that you can pass in an optional parameter that has a default of 0.  This default should be set such that when it is passed into your function it will return true if the passed string contains a digit and the position of the returned true match the passed parameter.  Otherwise, pass back false.<n><n>A good example of this is the following.  Let's say you pass in '2' for position and it happens to occur 3 times in the original string.<n><n>If you pass '0' as the position, this would be the expected solution returned:  '232'.  This is true because the number '2' occurred 3 times before the digit '3' (3 is greater than the number of repetition of '2').<n><n>If instead we pass in '3', it should return false because the '3' does not occur any more than what

His teacher gave him the task of making a chart with three columns and 9 rows. There he wants to put the amount of water (in milliliters) that each plant needs. There are the following requirements:<n>- If the plant lives in a cold climate it will need more water than plants living in a warm climate.<n>- If the plant has four or more leaves then it will need more water.<n>- A plant in a cold climate with 2-4 leaves needs less water than another plant with the same climate and the same amount of leaves but they are both warm plants.<n>- If the amount of water of a plant is odd then it needs even amount of water more than plants with an odd amount of water.<n>What does the student need to do to organize his data to fit this structure in the right order?<n><n>Output: First the student has three items then he has to make a chart of 9 rows and columns.<n>So he needs to start with the first item he is going to write in the first row.

Choices:  A: being understood B: beer C: playing around D: hug E: visiting friends<n>Output:		People that are having fun don't have a lot of time to explain why they are doing something, and also aren't going to be able to spend a lot of time discussing it. They usually want to spend time with those that are similar to them, that are in the same situations in their lives. They want to feel like they fit in and the majority of time they don't mind drinking beer with their friends to make more time to spend together. That's not always the way that they spend their time with those they are "trying to fit in" but the majority of time they have things in common, whether it be a hobby, or a mutual friend, or a problem in their life, they need people that care as much as they do in order to be able to fit in with others. In order to feel as if you fit in, you have to have something in common so if you know that somebody has a lot of the same likes as you do, then you know that they are probably a pretty good person to go out with, but its still important to get a second or third opinion because you never really know what somebody is truly like unless they have given you multiple accounts of their life. They are more likely to fit in somewhere else, and also more likely to have good things as hobbies and friends.<n>

Choices: A - 18 B -19 C -20 D -21 E -22<n>Output: A - 15 is the right answer because subtracting -4 from any positive number is negative, so the temperature would be -4, but since the answer is given in Celsius, the temperature would be -15.<n><n>Input: A clown has three balloons. One has a "7", one has an "x", and one has the number "3". If you pick a random balloon, what is the probability that you would get the 3?<n>Output: x=the number that hasn't appeared, 3= what is given, 7=the number that has appeared, and x=the number that HAS NOT been picked.<n>3= 1 (since there is only one out of the three balloons that has the 3)<n>7=0, since there is no 7 (it doesn't need to be chosen because it has already been picked)<n>x=2 (since there are only two that havent been picked)<n>So you can count the number of ways it can go right by using the formulas for counting:<n>1*(7-6) = * 1 *(7-(7-9)) = 1 *(6-1) =12<n>1*(7-7) =2 *(7-(7)   = 2*(0-2)    = 0)<n>1*(x-x) = 1 *x - 1 = 2<n>So total = 12-0 = 12<n><n>

The dog is not like any other dog."<n>Output: None of the other options is a noun, so we can eliminate them as being wrong.<n>We also know that each sentence can be divided into two clauses.<n>"Derek has a dog" is a clause without a subject.<n>"The dog is not like any dog" has the word 'is' in the beginning and so must start the second clause.<n>There is also a period sign at the end of the first clause, which lets us know that the previous clause is finished. (Otherwise, the statement could continue into the second clause.)<n>So "The dog is not like..." is wrong, as it can't be the second clause, since there is no beginning for a new clause.<n>Answer C<n><n>Input:A: "I have a little sister who is much taller than me." B: "How taller is she than you?" C: "Are you taller than her?"

Avoiding any problems by ending their own life seems like the obvious solution to them.  If there is no other happy solution for their unhappy problems, this may be the only solution they can come up with.<n><n>Input:There is an eating establishment that gives you 33% of you dinner bill for tipping. If all patrons tipped at least 20% how much cash would the restaurant gain.<n>Output: You must at least tip 20%. Therefore, an employee will earn 10% for just working.  This extra 10% is just the tip. Therefore, they already earned 10% at a minimum.  This means that they earned 33% of the 20%.  That will leave you at 20% of the bill, minus the 33% for the waiter, leaving 20% of $0 = <<20% of $50=10>>10.  The tip for everyone = <<10+10=20>>20<n>Therefore, the total amount earned by everyone (the waiter, and the customer) = <<10+20=30>>30<n>If $30 is the total amount earned, the overall customer tip + waiters tip = 33% of $30 = <<33% of $20= 7>>7 which gives you $20 - $7 = <<20-7=13>>13 extra dollars.  In other words, the restaurant will earn $30 in total tips

In other words, what is the minimum size power of 3 for a number to have an even power? Choices: 0 1 5 16 429496729<n>Output: Since we want to find a number such that the power of 3 is even we can multiply 3 by itself the number of times it has to be even. Since 3^2=3^3=<<3^3=9>>9 is even, 3^3 has to be 3^3=<<9>>9 so we can multiply 3^3=9 times to get 3^4=<<3^4=721>>721, which is odd. So we would have 9*3^3=<<45>>

There are more cars and fewer people. What's happening? Choices: A: People are buying the cars. B: People are biking over. C: The dealer is losing business. D: The cars are being repossessed. E: More people use the sidewalks.<n>Output: The cars are being placed in the dealer's place, there's definitely no way a person would buy a car when there are already a bunch of cars parked along that roadside but as for the other 4, there will only be people who like driving bikes, the owner has lost all the business, the cars were taken by a debt collector, and people are increasingly walking on the sidewalk, therefore more cars can't be parked along the sidewalks, so the final answer is E<n><n>Input: There is an expression that describes the amount of time in hours that it takes a student to complete a large project.  The expression is: P=(4*H+1) / 3, where H is the hours taken. Write an expression that describes the total hours that it would take 4 students to complete the large project if they worked 3 hours per day.  Use the properties of algebra to express your answer.<n>Output: P=4*H+1, so ((4*H1 +1)/3*2) = 2*4*H1 + 2<n>2(4*H1+1) = 4*8H1 +2<n>4H +4 = 2H1 +2<n>2H = H1-2, so H=H1-2, thus H1=3H, so H=H-3, so total hours of the project would be H=((H1-3)*4)+3 = (3H1/4)*4 +3<n>and since H is H1/4, H1 =4H (3H1/3H4) + 3

There are, however, not many who speak three. If there were 15 people using each language one of these languages is heard 10 times more often than the others.<n>How many people speak two languages and how many speak only one?<n>Output: In the question we're asked the % that a language is used out of 4 languages. I know we're expected to calculate that % (the % of how common that language is out of four). I would do this by first finding how many people speak 1 and 2 languages since we know that 15 people speak these 2 languages and we also know that there are people who only speak 1 language. So for 15 people who speak 2 languages that tells us that 14 people don't, and we have 20 people who speak 1 language. In this way we multiply our % by 20 to get how many people there are that only speak one language.<n>But this question is about people using those lanuages so I'm not sure how to do this.

Choices:  100 100 miles 200 miles 425 miles 50 miles<n>Output: There are 2 county's in this scenario (Districts 4 and 5) and a county line is the intersection of 2 county roads. So in total there is 1 intersection or crossroad between Districts 4 and 6.<n>If you travel due west from District #6 on a road for a 1 mile, you will reach County District 5 on the map.  If you go 1 mile in the other direction (due east to District #7), it will also put you in District 5.  Traveling north from District 6 will put you into Mesa County at a later point.<n>So to sum it up,  you need to go East or West 2 miles in order to reach a county line because 2 miles is equal to one county line. So the final answer is 2:<n>

The function will be called in the main as follows:<n><n>```<n>sumSquareNumbers(10);  //10 elements are provided as input<n>```<n><n>### Question2: Loops<n><n>Write a function called "primes"where the primes less than and including 100 are returned.  Then in its definition you can add a second argument to the function that you can optionally pass to a main function as follows:<n><n><n>```<n>sumPrimesTo100(2);    //2 elements to pass to sum primes function are passed<n>```<n><n>##  Programming Exercise: Exam Day Questions (Harder)<n>### Question 3: Loops<n>Write a function that adds the numbers 0 through 100, that is, it counts up. At the end if a special case is reached that will add the total count and return it to the caller of the function. Then in its definition you should add a second argument that is a 2-element array that contains a special value such as "<100 "in addition to the 0 and 100 numbers to represent the end condition. So calling the function like the following should return the total sum for the given input array:<n><n>```<n>var sumTo100=addNumbers(5, arrTo100);<n>```<n>### Question 4: Loops<n>Write two functions.  The first function adds the numbers 1 through 10 using a function whose name you give to the calling function. The calling function adds another, arbitrary number to it and then passes that argument in to the called function that it just called.  So the function will be:<n><n>```<n>const sumNumbers=((arr) => {<n>    var sumNumbers=0;<n>    for(x=0;x<arr.length;x++){<n>        sumNumbers+=arr[x];<n>

A player will not take his ball to a park and bounce the ball from an inside to an outside of the play area.<n>The ball is thrown or bounced from a target in the air into another play area.  A closet is another play area. A closet is similar to a toy box in size.<n>Because he might be in various play areas, the answer in E: closet.<n>But overall, I have to admit it's a tricky question because the answer is subject to interpretation.

His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Output: If he babysits for 2 hours at $7 per hour, he will earn 2*7 = $<<2*7=14>>14<n>This week he will earn $5 allowance, $10 mowing the lawn and $14 from babysitting for a total of 5+10+14 = $<<5+10+14=29>>29<n>If we add the $29 he will earn to his $65 savings, he will have a total of 29 + 65 = $<<29+65=94>>94<n>The bike costs $100 and he will have $94 leaving $100-$94 = $<<100-94=6>>6 more that he will need to earn<n>So the final answer is 6<n><n>Input: Mark has kangaroos and goats.  Kangaroos have two legs and goats have four legs.  If he has 23 kangaroos and three times as many goats as kangaroos what is the total number of legs of all his animals?<n>Output: His kangaroos have a total of 23*2=<<23*2=46>>46 legs<n>He has 23*3=<<23*3=69>>69 goats<n>The goats have 69*4=<<69*4=276>>276 legs<n>So in total his animals have 276+46=<<276+46=322>>322 legs<n>So the final answer is 322<n><n>Input:What is important in a car when you are driving fast and come to a light? Choices:  A: stripes B: seat belts C: breaks to help stop D: tires E: radios<n>Output:		The correct answer is B which states tires.  If you drive fast and you are close to running out of fuel but you did not have enough money and ran out of fuel, the car could still be fine but it could cause the car to crash. A=Stripes  When you drive on a sunny day or a rainy day, those do not affect you if you are driving fast. B=Seat Belt If you are driving fast, a seat belt will protect you 4 sure when you have an accident of if you drive into a tree. The seat belt will be pulled tighter and you will not die. C=Breaks You can see that the breaks stop a car so when you drive fast and come to an area with breaks or a red light, you do not need the breaks, but the radio is on. E=Radio What?! No!! I love hearing music when I drive but in an emergency it is not important.  If you need it later for a song or you just like to hear it, that will not save your life. It is optional and should be in a car for when you drive but not have to think about it while you drive fast. D=Tires If you run out of fuel and start to loose speed, the breaks will keep you on the road as long as you are hitting the breaks and you do not crash. If you crash while you are losing speed, you can not brake to slow down because you can not keep the car on the roads. You will always have tires if you need to drive. So in a car, you need tires the most and the most important for your safety while you are driving fast.<n><n><n><n>### Instruction:Write your solution for problem 31 and problem 1 below.

Choices:  A: park B: motel C: corner D: bus stop E: store front<n>Output:		a trash can in the park and the bus stop are common places where you'll find trash cans in the city. You are likely to pass garbage cans on your walk to get to the park so the park is probably the best place to find a garbage can if you don't find one on your walk. The bus stop is located on a street which has many stores so trash can will likely be found in the middle of a group of stores in the store front so a store front is probably the best alternative if you don't have access to a garbage can on your walk. Therefore the correct answer is choice B + C<n><n>Input: There are 5 boxes of food and 4 empty boxes. How many full boxes of food are there?

Her mother gives her a bag of 6 stickers and asks her to create 5 even numbers using the stickers.  How many solutions could her daughter arrive at?<n>Output:  When 5 even numbers are chosen from a set of a total of 20, 20 combinations are possible.  With only 6 stickers, choosing 2 will result in 3 stickers left or 1 combination.  Choosing 4 will result in 2 choices as 2 will be taken for 5 even numbers.  This leaves 3/5 of 6 stickers left in the bag.  With 5 even numbers choices, you must now choose a stickers for the odd number, since there are 1 stickers left from the 6 stickers in the bag.  There are now only 3 even numbers choices left. Each number must be used twice to meet the total of 5 numbers.  This means you will end the numbers by using the same 2 numbers for 2 different numbers.  Since each number can be used twice, there are 9 possible outcomes.  If a set of numbers is evenly divided, and each number is not used twice for 2 numbers, you will have 7 possible outcomes.  Therefore, when numbers are evenly divided, 9/3 = 3 times the number of actual solutions.  Therefore, 7/3=2 times the actual solution.  You will have a total of *2*(9-2)=<<2*(9-2) = 5*3=15>>15 solutions<n>Input: What is the capital of Maryland? Input: Baltimore<n>Output: B>>B<n><n>Input: A woman walks a mile in 15 minutes every day.

He was carrying 200 pounds of cargo in addition to his own weight.  How much extra energy (per hour) is needed for the rider to maintain 25 mph with the cargo on his horse under these conditions in which he is?<n>Output: For energy on the unit system, we use joules. joules / time x time = final joules.  For 200 pounds on a horse at 4 degrees c, there would be (200 / 5/9) lbs for every 1 degree c drop in temperature. So to carry the cargo we need approximately 22.  To maintain 25 mpg we would need to carry an additional 52 so 72 pounds per hour.  (72 x 25) lbs per hour would be 1800 lbs per hour.  <n>So in energy at 0 degrees c would be (52 x 1800) <n>92400 joules per hour.<n><n>Input: In math class, the teacher asks, "What are prime numbers?"

Choices:  A: suface of moon B: building C: bridge D: ground E: bright light<n>Output:		The shadow appears on the ground. In order for a shadow to appear, a light is needed to project the shadow so the shadow will be on something dark. The surface of the moon, is dark but it is not on the ground (doesn't create shadow). The building or the bridge can be lit so shadow can be projected onto them, but they are dark since they are not on the ground (cannot cast shadow on themselves), and the moon is only lit with the sun (not itself). The ground is dark and will cast a shadow onto other objects, such as itself or a bridge or a building, where a light could shine. The bright light can create its own shadow, but once the light shines it must hit something dark, so the shadow is on the ground. The choices are: D: ground, E: bright light<n><n>

A customer wishes to buy a $30,000 car and asks the salesman to give them a discount.  The salesman responds that he can make the discount using a new technique; if he charges $2 for a bridge, then the net cost is equal to $4 - $2 = $<<4-2=2>>2<n>If the client uses the $2 toll bridge, they have a net cost of $2.  If the client doesn't use the $2 toll, they have a net of $4 - $2 - $4 = $<<4-4=-2>>-2<n>Therefore, the client's total discount is $1 = <$2-$2><n>If the client wishes to pay this discount, the salesman can use a second toll, costing $4.  This leaves $4 - $4 - $1 = $<<4-1=3>>3<n>The client would prefer to be charged the $3 toll, since they have paid the $1 toll already.  The salesman agrees to the discount that leaves the client with a net cost of $3.  His customer drives off happy.  However, a new client arrives and the salesman charges them $4 once again.

First she needs to know at what exact measurement she needs her fence.  She is 5'3" tall.  How many inches is her yard?<n>Output:<<A yard is 3 feet>>Mary is going 5 feet tall.  The three feet is three times the height of Mary which is 5 so if you look at it like that Mary is going to buy wood so that she can surround her yard, and three times the height of her yard is the height of Mary ( 5 = <<3*5=15>>15), and a yard contains three feet so a yard times three is three times the height = <<15*3=45>>44.  So Mary is buying 15 yards of wood.<n>So the final answers are 5 and 15 yards<n><n>Input: A man wants to make 1000 gallons of lemonade to sell.

One cousins dog chases the cousins pet fish.  One cousns dog has nine lives.  How many dogs does each cousin have?<n>Output: Dog A: Nine lives - 10 dog(s)<n>Dog B: Dog(s)<n>Based on the information given, Dog B has two pet dog(s).<n>So the final answer will be Dog B's 2 pets + dog A's 9 lives-10 dogs/pet Dog B.<n>In the previous math quiz, we saw that the number of pets increased by 1 for every 1 live lost.<n>Now since B lost 0 lives, it means that B will gain 1 more pet for B's dog.<n>So B will have 1 +1 = 2 more pets.<n><n>So based on the math quiz, the original pet of Dog B will have two pets, and Dog A's 9 pets will be subtracted.  We will be given the 9 lives of Dog A, but Dog A cannot have 9 pets; this is because Dog A's pet is already dead.<n>This means that the answer will be that his pet will have 1 less pet.<n><n>So since Dog A lost only 1 pet, it must means that Dog A gained 1 pet.<n>And now that Dog B gained 2 pets, Dog B will have 2 pet + 1 pet = 3 pets.<n>This means that Dog B has 3 pets.  Dog A has 1 pet less than Dog B.<n>So the number of pets added to Dog A's dog will be the original number of pet, that will be subtracted with 1 less pet.  Dog A has original pet - 1 less pet = original pet -2 fewer pets.<n>Since Dog A has 2  pets and Dog B has 3  pets, Dog A's dog(s) will have 2 fewer than 3 pets. Dog A will have two pets - 2 = 0.<n>So Dog A will have two dogs and Dog B will have three dogs.<n>Input: John is a math teacher and he has 7 apples and 20 oranges.

They've been attempting to determine how many of the participants are allergic to pepper.  They've found that 95% of the group are not allergic, while the remaining 5% are allergic to any amount of it.  However, they aren't quite sure what that percentage means.  They figure that it can't be as simple as 2 out of 100.  This means that 95% should be greater than 5%.  However, they don't know how much greater than 5% it should be.  Here are the following combinations of what percent should the allergy be. What is the actual percentage?<n>95.5<n>95.75<n>95.875<n>96<n>If <<96>>is right, write 96 in the empty table.<n>Output: It is <<96>>96.<n><n># Part 3 ### The following series of questions is a little strange, but should be fairly intuitive.  The rules are as follows: 1. An equal fraction or percentage (4/9) is called a fourth (0.4444). 2. A percentage is multiplied by a number to obtain the result (P*R).  3. A fraction or percentage times a fraction or percentage should be calculated with the fraction or percentage being first on the top and bottom.  The answer is a fraction or percentage.  What fraction or percentage do you get for the following equation (I/9) (P/4) (Q/4)?<n>I (1/9) P (27/4) Q (31/4)<n>Output: It is <3707/169>3707/642<n><n># Part 4 ### What is the sum of <5071/2> and <16927/7>?<n>Output: It is  <<5071/38%>+<<16

Write a recursive function to calculate how much is remaining when you are left with one penny.<n>Output: You should just do a simple calculation that doesn't use recursion.<n>Since you start with 99 pennies and cut it down to one cent, you'd take $99-$1 = <<99-1=98>>98 and your final answer will be 98.<n>So the final Answer is 98<n><n>Input: You were hired to build a house.  The wood has a certain number of nails per board.  For each board you add 3 nails.  The price of a board with nails is 5 times the price of a naked board.  You can either buy the wood by the board (hence the price of $5 per board) or you can borrow a saw to cut your own boards (at no additional cost). For each board that you have to buy, there is a time penalty that is given by the reciprocal of the number of boards that you have. You have $40 to spend on the boards.  How many board can you buy and build?<n>Output: You have only 40 dollars to spend and your boards are 5 per board when your saw is 0%. So if you have just 1 board, you can buy a 5 board and get the cost of 1 board for 40/5 = 8 bucks. You end up with 5 - 8 = 3 bucks to make the 5 board cost of 1 board even 0, which means that without the saw, 1 = 1 and you have $40 of a 5/5 to spare.<n>So for the sake of simplicity, we will add the same board over and over again, which means we end up with $40 of 5 from 5. As a result

The grass on the other side in your house is green.  But you prefer your grass to be greener, so what do you do? Choices:  Plant more grass.  Make your grass blue.  Plant new grass.  Cut your grass.  Plant grass seed.<n>Output:The final answer is "c".<n><n>Cut your grass.  If you plant more grass, then you'll have to plant grass seed, and it will take a long time before all the grass are planted.  If it will eventually get greener on its own (this hasn't happened for you yet).  It will be green only on the very back of the yard (as seen in the photograph).  If you are willing to wait or spend a lot of money to get more grass planted, then just plant grass seed.  If you buy new grass, then you bought new lawn.  If you buy the very old grass, it will be very hard to cut it, and the grass will probably already mold.<n>

Choices:  A: dictionary B: wilderness C: fly D: underground E: colorado<n>Output:		A marmoset usually does not live in Colorado.It usually lives in its natural habitat, the Amazon rainforest. It may be found on or around other trees as well since it is an arboreal, or tree-dwelling mammal.  (Definition of arboreal: tending to or living in trees) The marmoset may climb down and feed from some distance, only occasionally descending to the forest floor. In the wild,  marmosets are commonly found in the treetops.<n><n>#### Solution: I've split this solution into a couple of lines to better understand:<n><n>Let’s start by first solving question A, then B, then C, then so on. A marmoset does not usually go to a dictionary. If they did… then they would know some useful meanings. We can start solving by elimination. <n><n>If _B_ and _C_ are false, then _D_ must be true. However, it isn’t! The marmoset doesn’t usually go to a fly. There is no option to put ‘fly’ as false.  _E_ doesn’t need to be true and so, we can rule it out!<n><n>So it is ‘false, false, true, false’ and the answer to _A_ is a marmoset.   <n><n>Next, let’s remove ‘_C_ and _D_’ from the group and try to answer.<n><n>If _A_ is true and _B_ is false, then _C_ and _D must be_ false. _E_ doesn’<n>t need to be true, so we can eliminate it. _B_ and _E_ can’t both be true, because ‘_A_’ and _E_ can only be true if _B_ is false.<n><n><n><n><n>Let’s move on to _E_. If _B_ is true and _C_ and _E_ are false, then ‘_C_’ and ‘_D’ _must be true_’.<n><n>A marmoset doesn’ _C_ and is never underground, only above it. _E_ should probably be false, so we can eliminate that option. There are some places a marmoset usually lives: the Amazon rainforest, the treetops in the wild, and Colorado, not anywhere else. _

Choices:  A: edge B: desire to win C: friendship D: rivalry E: skill<n>Output:		If they are competing against someone, they will try to out-edge that person.<n>The person who was the only one competing for a reward will try to get to the finish line before their rival/friend has chance to reach the finish line. At the same time they will try to outskill the other person.<n>So the final Answer is A+B+C+D+E=<<A+B+C+E+D=7>>7<n><n>Input: There are 24 people in a group.  There are 3 more females than males. If there are three more females than males, how many people are in this group?<n>Output: There could be a total of 24 people which also means there is a total of 7 more females.  In a group of 27, which is 7(3), there can only be either 25 or 26 females.  Therefore, if 7 is the smallest integer, that is true, since there is a total of three more than 7 (7+3=10).  If there were 26, it would be 26+3(24-7), which will then end up being greater than 27.  So 7(3)=21 in total, thus, 27-21=6 is the correct answer.<n><n>##<n>Input:There are two 4-sided dice.

If i roll both dice, then the probability of getting an even number will be 8/64 which when simplified equals to 1/8<n>##<n>Input:What is the probability of throwing a six with two dice with a six sided dice used for the first throw and three sided dice for the second throw<n>Output:The probability of getting a six in the first die will be 1/6.  If the die will yield a six, the probability of getting a 6 in the second die will be 3/9 and the probability of getting a three, will be (1/9), giving us a total probability of 2/3. <n>

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Mary had 89 stickers.  She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: Mary added a total of 7 stickers/page * 6 pages= <<7*6=42>>42 stickers to the 6 other pages.<n>In total, Mary added 3 large stickers + 42 stickers = <<3+42=45>>45 stickers to her journal.<n>Since she started with 89 stickers, she now has 89 - 45 = <<89-45=44>>44 stickers left.<n>So the final answer is 44<n><n>Input: Zach is saving his money to buy a brand new bike that costs $100.  His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Output: If he babysits for 2 hours at $7 per hour, he will earn 2*7 = $<<2*7=14>>14<n>This week he will earn $5 allowance, $10 mowing the lawn and $14 from babysitting for a total of 5+10+14 = $<<5+10+14=29>>29<n>If we add the $29 he will earn to his $65 savings, he will have a total of 29 + 65 = $<<29+65=94>>94<n>The bike costs $100 and he will have $94 leaving $100-$94 = $<<100-94=6>>6 more that he will need to earn<n>So the final answer is 6<n><n>Input: Mark has kangaroos and goats.  Kangaroos have two legs and goats have four legs.  If he has 23 kangaroos and three times as many goats as kangaroos what is the total number of legs of all his animals?<n>Output: His kangaroos have a total of 23*2=<<23*2=46>>46 legs<n>He has 23*3=<<23*3=69>>69 goats<n>The goats have 69*4=<<69*4=276>>276 legs<n>So in total his animals have 276+46=<<276+46=322>>322 legs<n>So the final answer is 322<n><n>Input:Where could you find an armchair that is used by only a few people? Choices:  A: doctor's office B: hospital C: apartment D: study E: furniture store<n>Output:		An armchair used by few people will be probably in a study.<n><n>1. Study is a private area.<n>2.

The bolt was most likely the smallest screw to be found on the nail.<n><n>Input: Jack loves chocolate. He eats two full pound box of chocolate every day. But when he had just moved to his current residence, he ate only 9/50 pound box of chocoate per day. After he learned this, he eats 30/30 pound box of Chocolate. If he ate two full pound box before his moving date, how many full pound boxes of chocolate does he eat each day?<n>Output: Jack ate 2 full pound box of Chocoate after he learned that he is eating only 9/5 box Chocoate per day.<n>After he has learned about 2 full pound chocoate after he moved in.<n>1.Jack moved in before he became a chocolate lover.<n>2.Jack ate 2 times 9/50 chocoate per day and 1 time 2 full pound<n>chocolate per day =  1time (2 times(9/50)) = 1 time 18/25 chocoate per day<n>3. Jack ate 30/3 chocoate on the 5th day, this means that he ate 20/3 chocoates per day.<n>4. He ate 9/50 for the days before he moved in =20/3 -20/3 = 0<n>5. He eats 18/20 + 20/3- 0 = 28/20<n>6. Hence we get 28/2

If he has 23 kangaroos and three times as many goats as kangaroos what is the total number of legs of all his animals?<n>Output: His kangaroos have a total of 23*2=<<23*2=46>>46 legs<n>He has 23*3=<<23*3=69>>69 goats<n>The goats have 69*4=<<69*4=276>>276 legs<n>So in total his animals have 276+46=<<276+46=322>>322 legs<n>So the final answer is 322<n><n>Input:My house is very dry, with little water in the air. What tool should I use to fix this? Choices:  A: humidifier B: surface of earth C: skating rink D: ice cube E: burn it to the ground<n>Output:		We can start with a surface of the earth, which we can imagine as a sphere which will have an approximate surface area of 4 *?<n>This will result in a liquid water volume of 1.5 cubic meters, which we can turn into ice using a humidifier.<n>An ice cube is also a surface, and we could repeat this until we get to a solution of water that is dense enough to sink into the burning surface of the earth.<n><n>Input: There is a large, round dish in the center of a box. One of two plungers, A or B. The other a large plunger 11 inches from the surface of the dish. This plunger can be moved into 1 of 5 spots. How quickly will the bottom of the dish fill in, given that dish has a total circumference of 30 inches?<n>Output: Let's try to make things easier.<n>We are given that the outer diameter of the bowl is 30". Now, I know that there are 360 degrees in a circle,<n>but the inner diameter of a circle is not always 360 degrees. The math here is different so let's just call it 360. We are given that there are 5 positions for the plunger<n>and because it can only be in a certain position (the other plunger is between it and the centre<n>and the bowl is circular, the only positions the plunger can occupy are 0, 90, 180, 270, and 360. If the other plunger is at 0 (zero) degrees, and the bottom of the plunger is 11" away from the center, and the bottom of this plunger is 0", then the top of the plunger will fill 0" of the bowl<n>and will be 10" or the bowl radius (or 10" diameter from the center) down from the edge of the bowl.<n>We can calculate the speed at which this will fill. 10" divided by 2 * 360 * 60 (we could have used 360 but it's a lot of decimal places to multiply/divide) for hours = 72 (about hour) or so.<n><n>Input: What is

You need to know how long it takes to land on the moon. You can choose to take one of the following two paths:<n><n>Path 1:   The moon has 4/5 of the gravity as earth.  You lose one tenth the height, the moon also has a much greater distance than Earth, and its circumference is much more than earth.<n>Path 2:   The moon has one fifth the gravity as earth.<n>You must determine which path is faster: Path 1 or Path 2.<n><n>Output: Path 1 must be taken.  The moon has 1/5th of our gravity, so if we multiplied the 1/10th loss by 1/5th gravity, then you would lose far less height on this path then Path 2 and you end up landing at the same height you started on.  Since the circumference is much larger than that of Earth, you'll be able to complete the task in less time. In addition, you lose far less altitude on either path than on our beloved Earth.  Your best bet is to land on the moon with 3/5th the time it takes you to land here on the Earth.<n>

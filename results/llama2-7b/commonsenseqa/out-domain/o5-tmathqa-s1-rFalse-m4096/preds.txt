But, the difference is that you only need to file a single tax return, while Dora will need to file both a state and federal tax return.<n><n>If you are single but have dependents, then, no matter how high your income gets, your tax is fixed at 15% for income tax, but filing state tax is a bit more complicated than that. If your income falls below $26,136 but is within $5,469 ($26,188 to $31,658), then you qualify for a 10% standard deduction, but if you earn $31,660 or more, you must file state tax. If you earn less than $26,189, you will likely qualify for a 5% standard deduction. That means you don’t have to file state tax, but you need to file federal tax for income.<n><n>if you and Dora are both married and have no dependents, then if your income is $26,141 for single or $42,088 for married filing joint, pay a tax of 15%, while if your income falls in between $26,150 and $43,895, then you pay a flat tax of 25%. There is a huge tax difference at $43,886, for then you will face a 25% tax. But again, you only need to file state tax if your income exceeds $5,468 (single) or $15,056 (married, filing joint).<n><n>If you and your spouse are both under 24 years old, then you are not considered dependents for income tax since they will fall in your parents’ income category. But if Dora does not have dependents, she pays 28% in taxes. But if you are both over 26

Mr. X took the opportunity to give his employees raises. It was 4.3% overall. He gave the guys working in the factory floor a raise of 5.1% and made the guys in the accounting department a 3.6% raise. One of the salespeople, Joe, was an exception to the raise. Joe, a hard worker, had an attitude problem and Mr. X felt that he was giving Joe too much trouble for Mr. X ’ s liking. So, Mr. X decided to fire Joe. Later on that day, the boss, who never really liked Mr. X anyway, called Mr. X into his office (the boss did not go in person, because the owner was out of town and would never find out). The boss gave Mr. X an ultimatum: Mr. X had to fire fourteen people. He said that any salesperson doing their job could be spared, but that the fourteen who got fired had to be support staff. All the people the boss wanted fired made up a full half of the total staff. Mr. X told the boss that he could not accept the ultimatum because he felt the workers should be fairly represented. The boss told Mr. X to get out of his office."

Suppose we define a sequence of events as follows. <n>Initial state: the sequence begins with an empty state.<n>State changes: whenever the sequence gets a step further, the sequence is in a new state.<n>Final state: after getting n steps further, the final state is reached, where n is a given arbitrary number.<n>After reading this definition, what does every one of us think of?<n>If one is a computer geek, he or she might think of the state changes in a computer. <n>If one is a musician, they might think of musical notes or chords.<n>If one is a mathematician, they might think about a sequence of counting numbers.<n>Let us explain a little bit more.<n>First, for computers, the initial state may be the empty memory of the computer (that is, the computer starts working when the memory is loaded). <n>Also, the state changes may apply to changing the instructions to be executed by the computer or to the instructions themselves. <n>Music: a music can be written down by notes. So, if the number of notes is fixed, then every one of us can agree that the above description is correct. But, what happens when one adds a new element to music? We cannot say that the sequence is in the new state since the final sequence (after all notes are played) has not been reached yet. This is the difficulty in studying sequence with music, whereas it looks so easy with counting numbers.<n>Mathematics: For a mathematician, the number of n might represent any kind of numbers, even counting numbers. For instance, instead of starting with 0 and adding 1 then 2 and so on, it is usual to use a fixed number to begin with. Then the sequence would be x_0,x_1,x_2,... where x_k is an arbitrary number k > 0.<n>Here is the challenge: Can you find a mathematical expression for the sum of the nth element, for the above sequences defined?

First start by drawing two similar triangles so as to have their altitude, ‘h’ as equal to the denominator. Thus, <n>`h/(h/h) = 1/(1/h)`<n>		<n>2.	This can be simplified to,<n>`h = 1/h`<n>We know that `sin(x) = x/h` and `cos(x) = 1/x` Thus, this equation is the same in the form `sin(h) = 1` and `cos(h) = -1`<n>		<n>Thus the value of h is thus `h = 60`		<n>`1/(h/60) = 1`<n><n>## Answer 2:<n><n>To answer this question one could draw two similar triangles, where `b=20` and `h=60`. Let’s denote `a = 80`, since `a > b > h` then this is concave, thus the base ratio and hypotenuse ratio are reciprocal. Thus the answer is B.<n><n>## Answer 3:<n><n>To answer these questions, <n><n>1.	Write your question in a sentence form. `What percent of 80 is 12?` <n>	2.	Change your question to a proportion or in the format ` a = b/c`. <n>		` 80 = 12/c` <n>		<n>	3.	Now, simplify,<n>		` 12/c = 80/a`<n>		And now substitute.<n>		<n>`12/c = a/80` <n>We know that, `x/m = a/b` Thus `x = ab/m`<n>		<n>` 6 = a/80 => a = 6/80 = 1/`<n>Thus the answer is B. <n>		<n>## Answer 4:<n><n>To answer, <n><n>1	Write the question in a sentence form, `how much percentage (a:b) is x/y?` <n><n>2.

In the second question, in b), the answer is A. the b is an expression which is "a" and "b", in the question, to find the ratio of a and b, that mean "a:b", so the answer will be A.

But at the same time, the people around them have no idea how to understand them. These types of people have a hard time socializing in the workplace and can only have a few friends. And it's rare to find someone with the same interests as them. It's best to talk to them about what you think they're talking about. You should also ask them about any issues they might have, and how they feel about them. They may not be able to tell you much about their feelings, but they may at least let you know what you think. It's important to be able to understand them as well, because this is the only way to really learn about what they're thinking and feeling. It's also important to let your friends know what you're thinking and feeling, so that they can help you. It's a real challenge to understand the nature of their thinking and feeling. But once you understand them, it's much easier to share them with others.<n>Output:<n><n>Input: <n><n><n><P>I work in an office and a co-worker of mine has a tendency to yell at people to the point where you start getting irritated. He is the kind of person who gets aggressive when he doesn't get his way, and I personally  dislike him greatly. However, I have done some research on him and I have found that he tends to be a bit of a loner and he doesn't have many friends. His hobbies include sports, music, video games, and watching TV. He also likes to eat. So he isn't as boring as he seems to be, but he still has his own interests. It would be hard to  get to know him, but he does have a few common interests with me, like watching movies and playing video games. I'm not sure what would be best for him though, because he doesn't really have any of my interests. However, I'm sure he'll  make friends with me soon enough.</P> <n><n>Output: <n><n><strong>Input:</strong> <n><n>  <strong>Dogs make very good companions and have been known for centuries as <u><strong>a.</strong></u> loyal <u><strong

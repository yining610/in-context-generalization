{"text": "Answer\n\n#### How can you get in shape without having to use a land or gym?\n\n####  Choice A:\n\nIf you are looking for a good way to get in shape, a good place to start would be swimming. It's a perfect type of fitness for someone that wants to build muscles because it requires a ton of endurance and strength because you swim to keep yourself above the water. Swimming also allows you to exercise your entire body as you can move it in any which way you want. This is great if you are looking to get your abdominal muscles in toned shape. There are also tons of other benefits to swimming, such as it reduces heart rate, and it is good for your joints.\n\n####  Choices B:\n\nJogging is a good way to get fit because it can be done anywhere. People would be able to jog without worrying about not finding any suitable areas to run on. It is also a very efficient method. You can even jog at the comfort of your home if you have a treadmill; that way you don't even have to leave your house to get in shape. Also, running gives you more energy because your oxygen levels get higher, so, after the run, you will likely feel more energized rather than more fatigued. This, combined with how fast it is to complete running, makes it be easier to do it frequently. It also is great for your body as you become much stronger. However, you must be careful about not overdoing your runs or you will hurt your body.\n\n#### Choice C:\n\nExercise can be done a lot of different ways and is good for keeping you in shape. Because of that, there are many different exercises that you can do at home or at the gym. When you exercise, your body is also working on building up specific muscles. This allows you to stay in shape and maintain your body the right way. Some people even do Pilates which combines exercise with Yoga and stretching. This is good for your core, back, and abdominal muscles which is great for your fitness.\n\n#### 1. D\n\nThere are many ways, so it would depend on what kind of workout you are looking to begin with.

{"text": "Answer: B: hotel\n\n### Why?:\nA hotel has many rooms that need to be cleaned, so they would need a room with a laundry in it. This could also be true for a bed and breakfast, where there are more rooms to clean. Hotels are not really places where people sleep in houses, but hotels have a lot of rooms that need to be kept clean so they must have a laundry room. \n\nIf you are at a house visiting your friends or family, then their house is typically not used by staff. A college would have multiple floors of rooms and some of those rooms would also need staff to clean them, but they would need a room large enough to have a laundry facility.\n\nAt a hotel and other places of public accommodation, there are many different rooms that each need to be cleaned. They would need a laundry room so that they could keep the clothes clean.\n\n### Input:(What is the sum of three consecutive odd integers?) Choices:  4345 2637 3014 4576\nAnswers: 4613\n\n### Why:\nThe sum of three consecutive odd numbers is 4613. That means you add 3,5,7 to get 4613, because each number is going to be added to the one following it. The three numbers are 5, 7, and 9; so the sum of each one is 23,262,301. \n\nYou also get the sum if you start at 4 and double each number. If you start at 1, you add just 2 numbers. 9+11=20 and so on. \n\n### Demostration:\nThree: if you start at 3 and double the next number, you get to 11. Then you add zero (because 4 + zero = 4) and 47 for 54, then you add zero (4 + zero = 5) and 59 for 73. Then you add each number that follows, and when you get to 159, you add zero and 169 for 177.\n\nFive: five and seven start at 5, 5 + 7 = 12.", "answer": "B: hotel"}

The distance from the beginning of the hole to where it crossed the fairway is your \"positive\" stroke, and the distance from where it crossed the fair way to the hole is (or would have been) your \"negative\" stroke.  So, you have a negative stroke on the way to the green. \n\nWhat's a driver?  A driver is a person who operatess a motor vehicle for you, such as a truck or bus driver, but he or she does not operate a builder and the negative version still applies.\n\n### In this situation, we can say that \"driver's design a building\" if we negate it and \"build designing\" if we don't.\n\n### If you're wondering, we were right - a lot more right than the tester!\n\n### What you just learned:  In a question, the answer can be either positive or negative, depending on which one makes more sense.  But in an instruction, you must be specific about which type of answer is desired.\n\n###\n\n## Solution:\nWe can tell that the intended answer is _driver_, based on the negation of the statement (since the intended answer is negative in construction). We can also identify that _builders_ is the same as build, so it is a noun. We can use the logical operator, not, to negate the nouns: \n```\nnot(driver) equals  (build) * (build) * (design) \nnot(driver) =  (build) *  (build)   \nDriver does not design a building. \n```\nBut, based on the logic, we might also be justified in accepting the statement", "answer": "C: architect"}

(12.5% - 5% = 7.5% > 5%.)  Choice C: The left side is less than 1 (<1) and the right side is less than 4/7 (< 23/28).  Therefore the less than sign on the left side and greater than sign on the right side cancel each other out and give a correct answer of less than 5/28.\n\n### Input and response:John was going to buy a gift for his daughter. He can spend no more than $35. If he adds together the prices from 4 different stores: Store A: $9, Store B: $17, Store C: $15, and Store D: $12  Then each store sells him a gift for one dollar less than they charge him.  Can he spend the $35, and which store gave him the least profit? Choices: 1: store A 2: store B 3: store C 4: store D 5: can't be done\n\n### Response (comments):The correct answer is: Store A (9.00 + 8.00 + 7.00 + 6.00)/4 = $8.00 per store\n\n### Why? The question was \"Which store gave him the least _profit_?\" If by profit, they mean the money remaining, then the correct answer is the store that gave him the least _remaining_ money.  Each store gives him a dollar less than the original price (which isn't shown in the question.)  Let", "answer": "B: have fun"}

How many miles are there between Mike's house and Tom\u2019s?\n\n### Response (Instructions may not be the same in every exam. So, it is advisable to check the instructions more than once):\n* 86% of women, there would be 7 women in a 9 member group.\n* There are 1500 feet in 1500 yards. So, there are 200 feet in a yard. 86% is the same as 0.86. So, 86% of 1433 is 1237.9 feet.\n* It is simply 40 x 10 = 400.  It is because the company is paying 10$ for each hour. In 4 days there would be 400 hours. So 400 x 10$ = 4000$.\n* If there are 86% women, there would only be 2 men left. So, Mike is 100yards away from Tom's house.

You have just read the book,  Mindfulness: A Practitioner's Guide to Meditation, by Will Williams.  For a homework assignment, you are going to send him your favorite paragraphs from the book, and your friend asks you if this is a good way for him to help his girlfriend be more mindful.  Write response that appropriately complements the request. Be sure to include enough information for your friend to understand why your paragraphs are a good reflection of the book.\n\n### Input\n\n\tMy favorite paragraph is about focusing on the feelings.  Feelings are the way our bodies react to our thoughts.  When we focus on our thoughts, instead of the feelings or sensations, we can start to be more mindful and less reactive to our thoughts.\n\nFeelings allow us to better understand the thoughts that are going on in our head.  Focusing on feelings is one of the most important aspects of meditation because we notice our thoughts and feelings simultaneously and it gives us the opportunity to process them.\n\nThe paragraph describes how to be mindful through mindful breathing.  Mindful breathing is when you focus completely on your breathing.  It is a part of your meditation practice and helps you to stay focused on the present moment.\n\n### Response\n\n\tYour paragraphs show that you need a good variety of examples so that they will relate to your friend.  I think your paragraphs would be an excellent way for your friend to start practicing mindfulness.  If your friend's girlfriend needs to practice mindfulness, I would recommend that he send her three or four different paragraphs.  By providing different examples to practice, his girlfriend will be less likely to get bored.", "answer": "B: animal shelter"}

Sarah is 2 years older than her husband.  Sarah thinks that Brian's reading, cooking, and building skills should be higher.  What should be increased for Sarah to be happy?\n\n## Explanation\n\nYou can increase the amount of books that Brian reads, the number of games that his wife plays, or the amount of blog posts that Brian writes.\n\n## Author's Explanation\n\nAfter analyzing the task we realized that the author is using the last part of the task as part of the answer instead of as a prompt. This may be because the author wants the students to focus on something other than increasing reading, swimming and building only. We need to make the task more specific by asking the student to focus only on the given answer choice:\n\n[Sarah's skills should be increased.]\n\nBecause Sarah's reading is too low, swimming and writing skills should be increased more than others. These skills are needed to make Sarah's reading skills higher.\n\n## Suggestion\n\nSarah writes 2/3 of the blog posts that Brian writes and Brian writes 518/231 = 2.2 posts.\n\nIf Sarah has 21 posts and she thinks that the amount of posts that Brian writes should be higher (as Sarah doesn't know how many posts Brian writes), then the amount of posts that Sarah thinks that both Brian should write should be calculated as the quotient", "answer": "E: anger"}

Choices:  I can form 780 rectangles II I can form 720 rectangles III I can form 880\n\n### Response II\n\n### Explicator II\n\n### The area of the 8 inch by10 inch rectangle is 80 square inches, while the area of each 4 inch by 4 inch square is four square inches. So 80 square inches divided by 4 square inches is 20. So that means 20 times 4 is 80. In other words, we can get 20 x 4 = 4 x 8 = 8. Since eight can be made into 8 x 10 = 80 by multiplying by 10, it can be made into 4 x 8 rectangles, so we can create 80 rectangles.\n\n### The above question was written and answered by a student who completed the online course \"Programming in Python 3.9\" in one week.

How much milk does Michael get when he goes home?\nAnswer: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Gallon\n\n### Response\n\nIn this example, I am using the word'response' instead of 'answer'.  As such I will be leaving out certain information, such as the actual numbers in the question.\n\n1. Take a sentence using \"input\" in the body of the question or instruction.\n2. Replace the word \"input\" with \"response\".\n3. Look at the output in the response. Is it a complete sentence? Yes? Good! You are ready.\n\nIn our example, the \"input\" is \"Michael had 3 quarters of milk.\" This indicates that the request is asking for a response.  There are several things you need to know in order to reply effectively.  The first is the sentence after \"Response:\" is usually the output of a completed question or instruction.  By completing step 3 you proved that it contains a complete sentence.\n\nNext is an important concept about this example. In order to answer the question or instruction, we need to know a word of information we are missing. We need to know how much milk the mom takes.  This information is not given.  \n\nNow, look at step 2.  The word \"response\" is replaced with the word \"answer\".  This is incorrect.  You are now not completing the answer to the question or instruciton, but instead you are requesting the answer from a third party source.  In this example the source is the reader, and so instead of \"response\" you use \"input\".\n\nStep 3, is where you put that information you didn't have in step 2 in your response.  Michael's mom only takes 1 quarter of the milk, leaving him with 3.  He should therefore get 3 gallons of milk in the answer to the original question or instruction, since his mom is now only giving him 1 quarter.\n\nRemember, the output of a completed task is a complete sentence, while the source of input is not.", "answer": "C: battlefield"}

The human had just spent 10 years in training and 1 year in the space station working on computer systems without seeing the natural life of the earth for such a long period of time. The human was longing to be on the surface of the earth. As far as the human knew, 2 months had already gone by since starting the journey into space and he would not return to the earth until 9 years had passed because the orbit had to be the same speed as he was orbiting in order for his journey to take a reasonable amount of time. He knew that his wife would be very upset, and he was also slightly concerned that his son could have died that had just turned 7 years old. The human also thought about life on the earth, and was surprised that the population had quadrupled since the year 2000, after he had last seen any live humans. He was shocked at the rate of increase in population and wondered if this meant that the earth was not a sustainable living environment. He was also worried at the rate of environmental destruction since last he was on the earth he had noticed that large areas of forest had been burnt to make way for farmland. He also realised that the humans had not made any advancements in technology since 2000 so it was likely that his wife would have died because of medical advancements. Even the food that they ate for the journey into space was not as fresh and tasty as it would have been if the human had returned to the earth. In these conditions he also thought people would be fighting to go onto the space station as he had because of the comfort and the feeling of freedom he was experiencing. Now he needed answers to his questions, but would also never achieve his dream.

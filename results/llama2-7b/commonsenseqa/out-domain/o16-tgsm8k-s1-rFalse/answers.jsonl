However, if this number is not prime it may still be prime.  A simple example is that 26 is a product of two primes, but is also prime.  The difference between primes and composite numbers is clear if we add an extra number to our example.  Let\u2019s use 23. 23 is a composite number because it is the product of 2 and 11 which are not primes. However, if you add 11 to 23 you get the prime number 33.  A number is either a prime or a composite number, and one can always be added to make the other.  However, if we were to start with a prime number and try to add something to get a composite number, we\u2019d always end up with a prime number.  10 is prime; however, when we add something to 10, we always get another prime. 10 + 1 = 11; 10 + 2 = 12; 10 + -4 = 6; 10 +4 =14; 10 +13 = 23; and so on.  So, no matter what we add to 10, the resulting number will always be a prime number.  Therefore, if a number can be divided up in two ways, one of which does not produce the number, the number is prime.\n\nOutput: D\n\nInput:Jay and Mary are in competition to see who can eat the most pizza.

{"text": "B  C\n\n#### Solution(s):\n\n### Solution: 1\nThe correct answer is 44\n\nTo calculate how many stickers are left without writing the rest of the problem down. Firstly we are able to say that Mary began with 89 stickers because she had 3 large stickers, this is 89 - 3 = 86. Then we can subtract the 3 pages that are 7 each, and subtract one additional sticker so that there must be a 5 page left with 34 stickers.\nUsing this information, you can then conclude that there are 16 stickers left out of the 86 that Mary had before.\nUsing this information you can then simply subtract 16 from 86 which is 68.\n\n### Solution 2\nThe correct answer is six\n\nAfter you have read the input, you can tell that you are missing some information. It says that Zach is saving his money and has some already but also that he has to earn more money. You also have that some one is going to pay him extra money if he babysits, you now also have that it is $10.\n\nUsing this information you know that a weeks allowance is a fixed amount and after he mows the law it is only a flat price for that and his neighbor is willing to pay $7 an hour so you know that this is not a fixed amount and has the potential to grow to be more than $10.\nFinally, the extra $10 is already in Zachs account if he has it by the time his parents allowance arrives (Friday 1 day from now), this means he can withdraw it and that he only has to earn enough money to buy his bike.\n\nThis information allows you to calculate his weekly allowance (based on the extra $10 and not the flat weekly pay of $5). Since the weekly allowance is unknown, you cannot calculate it and you are not able to calculate his balance (what he has left in his account)\n\nFinally, you can simply calculate how much he needs to earn to buy the bike and based on the weekly allowance this is\n\n### Solution three\nThe correct answer is eight\n\nUsing the information given in the problem we can calculate and conclude that he has two (2) legs", "answer": "B: polished"}

To avoid standing in line, students each have one person\u2019s worth of their own time they can give to someone else in exchange for a cup of ice cream.  Who is the last person standing in line?\nOutput:  The first student in line. Let's call him Bob. Suppose he has Bob1, a person's worth of time that he can give to someone else. If everyone (n - 1) people are in line, then that puts Bob in front of someone else (the other person is someone less famous than Bob). So Bob1 becomes Bob1.+Bob2,Bob3 because now someone is in line behind him, and some one is in line behind that person, etc (n-1 total). That means Bob's time keeps increasing by (n-1) each time the line shifts, and the person(s) who is/are in line. So by the time every one is in line, Bob's time will have increased to (n*(n-1)) / (2) = n2.

You can use the mod operation to achieve the output. You can use mod to calculate % of a number mod an other number. The function mod is written in C++ as %\nExample for mod function:\n100 % 2\n98\n100 %3\n53\n\n### Challenge\n\nWhen you first learn C++ you know little about the math concepts you're about to learn. But that doesn't really matter, because C++ has an amazing ability to do everything for you, just like JavaScript. C++ has a built-in int type that is good for use in mathematical expressions, so you can use the built-in math functions like pow and mod, and if you want to use higher-level math functions like sin and exp, you can use the math.h header and call the fabs and log functions directly. The first chapter of this guide gives you an introduction to these math features, so don't be afraid to take the plunge.\nYou learn something new about C++ every day. So don't be discouraged if you have to do more research and read more articles than usual in order to understand the concepts of a new tutorial. Just keep learning and be patient.

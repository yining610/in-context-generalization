This can be very helpful for those who know the streets well, or there might be people who know the streets and their shortcut options (thus B).  However, if it is a populated area, the roads (C) are less desirable since they are more likely to be blocked by traffic.

Therefore, we are left with A and B, which means all we need to do is test each option to see if the fox might drink from any water there.\nIn the painting, a fox might drink if there is a pond painted on.

Let them be m and n. Therefore, m = n/2. m soldiers + 100 = n/2 + 100. Substituting in for n/2,\nm(m+100) = (n_2 + 102). The greatest common factor for 0, 1, 100, 2 is 100, so 50% of 100 is 50.\n50% of m is (m/2)/2. (50*m)/2 = (m/2) *(m/2) = n/4.

Their jobs are to make decisions  that affect the success of the company, then give them equal shares of profits.  They begin by splitting up the work with the promise of dividing the profits equally.  A takes half the work, and B takes the other half.  As the months go by and the profits come in, B complains to A that they should divide the money they earned equally.

How do you resolve their disagreement?\nOutput: If A and B split profits proportionately to how much work each person contributed to earn them, A would benefit from more work while B would benefit from less work.\nIf A earns $d*h = x*h and B earns y*h, then A should contribute h while, B should contribute x/y-1 = (x/y)*(y-1)\nThus, they should divide the profits equally after each person contributes an equal proportion of work.\nThus, the solution is to have more or less work according to the proportions from which each person contributes work (as A contributes only half the work B contributes).\n\nInput: What is the value of Pi?

After eating half of it, she found a gold coin underneath one of the candles. How much of the cake should she eat next in order to have at least one left?\nOutput: First she must remove the candle from the cake where the gold coin is and eat the size of half of the cake + half of the candle. So first she eats 10/2 = <<10/2=50%>>50% of the cake and 1/2 = <<1/2=50 % >>50% of the candle.\nNow she has removed all the half of the cake and candle and she must eat at most half of the remaining cake + half of remaining candle (since she cannot eat the candle that is left) so she eats 1/2 + 1/2 = 1\nSo the final answer to eat is 1/2 =<<1/2=5%>>5%.\n\nInput: A bag of apples weighs 7.5kg.

How much does 6 lbs of rice cost?\nOutput: The total cost of rice is $16.77. The total quantity is 12 + 6 = <<12+6=18>>. Since the total cost of the 12 units is $16.97, each unit costs approximately $1.37.\nWhen converting 6 into an equivalent amount of rice, 6/12 = <<6/12=1>>1, and six units of rice cost $1.37 * 1 = <<1.37*1=1.37>>1.37. So six units of rice costs $8.32.\n\nInput; The total cost of 10 units of each item are $320. Each of the two items has 5 items at $1.4 per item. Therefore, each item was $7 per unit.\nOutput: The two items, each with five units, cost $550 / 5 = <<550/", "answer": "A: store"}

If a team of 11 alien invaders attack a planet, how long will it take them to capture it?\nOutput: A planet is spherical, meaning that its surface area is 4\u03c0r2, where r is its radius. Alien invaders attack a planet in a coordinated way, so the attack time is O(n) where n is the number of aliens in the team. Because we are talking about a spherical planet, the time for them to attack is O(4\u03c0r2*n). This number can be simplified to O(4\u03c0rn), which is a geometric series. For this problem, we will approximate using this formula: \\sum\\limits_{k=1}^{\\infty}{\\frac{4\\pi}{n}} = \\frac{4\\pi n}{3}. So the attack time is \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{\\infty}{\\pi r i \\left(i-1\\right)} = \\frac{4\u03c0r\u2211ni\\left(i-1right)}{3} = \\frac{4(\u03c0r)(26)}{15}.

The fence started on the side of the house and turned 100 degrees left. Then, it continued on the other side of the house and made a 400 degree turn back around. When it returned to the original side of the house, it didn't turn the same angle as it did previously? That is, it didn't travel back the same path it traveled originally.  It made two smaller back-and-forth trips through the grass but was never outside the fence. At the end, the fence was two meters, or eight feet longer than it started.  What was the original length of the fence? Choices:  A 20m B 24 m C 20m D 24m E None of these The question does not specify that the fence made a perfect 100 degree turn on its way around the house.  The fence returns to the original side, and the angle it made during the first run is not the same as the angle it makes on the return.  Choice E is not the best choice because it doesn't specify what choice \"None of these\" is referring to.  The best choice is choice A.  I believe choice A is 20m, because that is a little over 20 units if the fence is 2m units long.  This is the amount of extra units the return added to the original.  The turn doesn't subtract units because each run is 8 feet long.  So, in total, the two loops add 16 units to the length of the fence.

Tap A delivers cold water at $3 per litre, tap B delivers warm water at $4 per litre, and tap C delivers hot water at $6 per litre. If you want the water from tap C warm, how much water does it cost to get a litre of hot water?\nOutput: The hot water comes from tap C, so the amount delivered from tap C to make it warm is liters * $6 = <<liters*6=30>>32 liters of water.\nThe hot water delivered was liters * $6 so the cold water to make it warm is also liters * $6 or liters * 10 because of the $5 = <<liters*10>>12 liters of water\nSo the final answer to 2 liters, 12 liters is $66, and $44 is the final answer.\n\nInput: A toy shop has 2 dozen sets of dolls for sale - each containing 2 dolls in different outfits.

For example, if his income is $11217.40 and his pay is 11217%, it is 85% of his pay.  We could say his pay is 85%/monthly pay, or $85/month.

If the fox was at the zoo or Utah, they would be at the south carolinae zoo or in south carolina or both. If the person is in Wyoming, they are not at the zoo and do not need to be in Utah, so they are definitely in Wyoming.

In the United States there is a \"melting pot culture\", or a fusion of different cultures.\nThe physical geography involves a vast desert as well as mountains and sea coast, but also forests and marshy land. Weather varies regionally due to this difference in physical geography but also from season to season.\nThe biogeography is that it is a mix of animals, both land and sea, and people (both immigrants and natives).\nThe population of the United States is diverse with respect to culture and race. Many people come for economic opportunities.\nPeople\u2019s perception of themselves is shaped by this cultural mosaic.\nThe culture developed historically through waves of different peoples and groups from Europe and other origins, as well as through assimilation of native groups.\nCulture is passed on to the next generation in both ways -- in schools where students are taught American values and history and also through the many cultures that people have brought from their homelands.\nThe final thing I learned was the sheer diversity.

Thus, in a day (24hr) they\nwill give 5 * 24 = 120g of milk. In a week, they will give 5*7=35 gallons of milk.

If randomly chosen from these students, what is the probability that 50% of them could complete the problem? How about 50 of these students?\nOutput:  Only 10 % of the students could complete. So randomly 50 students are chosen. The probability of the first one doing it correctly is 10 %. So the probability of the 50th doing it correctly is (10 %^50), which simplifies to around: 0.1 %^(0.2 % ^ 50)\nThe probability of completing the problem is (0.1 % ^ 50)^50.\nSimplifying that yields: 1.5 %/1000\nSo the probability that 51 students could not complete the problem is 1.5 % divided by 1000.\nSince the probability is 0.01, it is quite unlikely that all 50 students could complete the problem, so the answer is \"almost certainly NOT\"\nSimilarly for 50 of these 50 students doing it, the probability goes up to 1.5 %.\nSo in summary (50 * 50 %^51)\nIt is highly unlikely that 50 students could succeed.

Choices: A: quarter B: two thirds C: three fifteenths D: two twelfths E: one fortieth\nOutput: The man will put away 1/3 in the first box, so the contents is 1/3 and each box is 2/3 and 1/3.\nSo the first box contains 1/3 of 2/3, and hence 1/3 of (2/3)= ((2/3)*1/3)= ((2*1)/3)= (2/6)\nSo the first box contents is a quarter\n\nInput:A certain sum of money is divided between 4 people in the ratio a:b:c and d.

One week later, the person decided to move to another small house which was bigger but much more expensive, and he sold the first house. If the person paid for the second house $20, how many days or weeks has passed since he got the first house?\nOutput:First the person owned the house, so he must have lived there for a week. Then he must have sold the house and bought the bigger one, which must have cost $40 (= 200%, so he got 2 houses). So since he didn't live there for 2 months, the second month had to be when he sold the house.

This is the same as 1x1x1.\n\nHowever, the big box is $4x2x\\frac14 = 8$8 dollars.\nTo get the cost for the big box, we must multiply by 2.\nThe final answer is therefore 4", "answer": "C: shopping mall"}

{"idx": 431, "text": "School begins at 8:30 am and most students arrive by 8:00am. By 8:00 am there are generally not many more people at school.  If the school day lasts for 7 periods, that is 7 classes, each of which has a 70-minute duration, the students would have to be at school by 8:05AM. If you consider the average bus ride to being 15 minutes long, students need to have left their house by 8:02AM, or 8:00AM. That is before school. So in total for 7 periods or 7 classes the student needs to arrive at school by 8am in order to have time for 7 periods. Thus, it may take him/her an hour to get through the doors and to the class on the 7th period in the morning. If the child did read 15 minutes in the morning, then he/she would need to make up the 15 minutes with an additional 15 minutes of reading at home in the evening. That is why I chose the school library as a place for the child to read rather than his room as if a child wants to read in his room, his parents could easily not allow it.\n\nInput: In the morning, Gavin goes the gym, the library, and the bank.  After the gym, it take him 41 minutes before he reaches the library and the bank, respectively.  It takes him one hour before he reaches each of the places he wants to visit. How many minutes did it take Gavin to do all three activities?\nOutput: First, let us find the time it takes Gavin to complete the tasks in each order.\nThe time it takes to go from the gym to the library and the library to the bank is the same.\nSo, the total amount of time it takes to complete the tasks is 2 * 41 = 82 minutes\nNext, we will find the total amount of time to do all the activities when Gavin goes to the gym first and the gym second.\nFirst, Gavin visits the gym for an hour.\nSo, he visits the gym before going to the library and the bank.\nNext, he visits the library for another hour.\nSo, the library comes after the gym.", "answer": "D: wash dishes"}

Which is again, like the opposite of love (you love through people or God).\nFor the letter C, love can be both eternal and/or last forever, but that doesn't necessarily mean you will. If you love someone for a limited time but have a permanent impact on his/her life, there love never went away because it has an impact.\nFor the letter D, it is painful because things like love can hurt you or other people, so it can be painful even if it's beautiful.\nFor the letter E, it is that everyone feels love because everyone goes through it (and has different experiences with it) so it's not impossible for it to be eternal or everlasting.\nSo the final answers are \"wrong\" because the opposite of \"wrong\" is \"right\". \"Right\" has too much meaning to be the answer, \"blind\" because everyone feels it, everyone goes through it (there are plenty of loners who never experience love) and love can be blind.

Therefore, 3 seats in coach carry 1 passenger each.\n70% of seats in other sections of the plane are first class. Therefore, the total number of seats seats 70% of the passengers, assuming that each first class seat carries 25% of passengers, including children (including the children in coach, which is 1 child per 3 seats). The number of first class seats is 25% * 70% = <<25%*70%=17.5>>17.5\nEach first class seat will hold 25% of 17.5 children, that is 4 children.\nEach coach seat seats 3% of the passengers, that is 1 child.\n3 children from coach will be on first class. Therefore, 4 - 3 = 1 child likely to be on the first portion of the plane.\nAnother child will be on the coach section of the plane.\nThere will be a total of 2 children.\nSo the final answers are child on first class 1 child, child on coach 2 children\n\nInput: If a store sells 20% less of its total inventory this day than it did on the same day last year, how much less total inventory does it sell?\nOutput: This day, there is 20% less inventory which means that there is 80% inventory\nLast year there is 100% inventory which means that sold inventory of this day is 100%.\nTherefore, (100-(100/1.2))=\nSo, 80-75% means 5% that means 5% * 100=\nSo, the final answers are sold inventory of this 26.2%", "answer": "C: antipathy"}

During an event at the school, 1/3 of the pie sales were canceled. The salesperson counted the receipts and wrote them down. He counted 653 dollars in total sales. He wrote $9.50 for the cancelled pie sales. How did he reach this value?\nOutput: The school cancelled 1/3 of sales, leaving 2/3 sold.\n2/3 of sales price is $2.25 per pie\nSo for each canceled sale, he added 9.50 + (2.25*1/4 sales) and got 9.50+0.5625 = <<9.50+9.50=19.00>>19 dollars.\nSo the salesperson wrote $19.00 for cancelled pie sales.\nThe total sales were 653 dollars, so total sales = 653\nSince each sale was $1.50, total sales = 670.50\nSubtracting the cancelled pie sales of 9.50, the net sales was 651 dollars.\nSo the final sales amount was 651.50.\n\nInput:The 11 largest prime numbers are 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, and 47.

In this notation, an x was used for multiplication, a y as a divide by symbol, and z as the unknown.  Which of these equations would a user of this notation write for the sum of 0.62 + 1 + 7.12?\nOutput: An equation that the user could write would be z*y for the sum.  The first term z*0.62 would equal 0.37, the second term would equal 0.71, and the last term would equal 4.77, which when added together becomes 5.85 or 5 rounded off.

The rule is similar to common sense, but the numbers come from probability instead of experience. This rule is most helpful with the math concepts that are rarely used in real life, such as probability. You can use the rule to find out what you get when you multiply (a + b) by c. If you follow the rule (a + b) = c, you can divide either side by c and solve the equation (a + b) / c = d. Then simplify this equation by dividing both sides", "answer": "D: wall"}

When we think what's the first digit of the code, we could say that the code for 1 is 1-digit. Then, what does the next digit of the 3-digit code be? The second digit should be 0, because when we think how many times 0 and 4 are in the code, 004 is a number that contains both numbers. When we think about the third number in the code, it should be 4 so it can only contain numbers that are in the 4 digit code.

This is what can happen.\n\nNow, while the brain is asleep, it is going to send signals to different parts of the body. If you are cold, the signals will be sent, for the body to warm up. If the signals from the brain are strong, the body has to respond. However, these signals are only strong if the person is awake. Thus, it is only when you wake up, did you ever get cold.\n\nNext, signals from the brain tell the body to talk or snore. This is not a sign of awakeness, it is a sign of brain activity during sleep.\n\nIf you start dreaming, this means that your brain is doing more.

Choices: 1: Never. You can trust your students 2: 1 time per paper, for every student, 3: 1 time per assignment, 4: More frequently if students do not complete assignments on time, the professor could give a poor mark to the assignment in which plagiarism occurs. 5: The grade will be adjusted if it is found after the fact so that the student earns the grade they deserve\nOutput:  Plagiarism is when you take an idea and wording from someone else and then represent it as if it were your own. It is a form of academic dishonesty, and it is a violation at our university. It can be easy to accidentally include too many ideas from someone else in your paper, but these should be easy to find and fix with more careful reading.\nHere are a few simple things to check to catch possible plagiarism:\n+ Check for spelling errors: Often when students paraphrase something, they get an important section in the wrong order, and they can get a citation for it wrong.\n+ See how long it is: Long sections or whole paragraphs can make your writing sound more formal than you did intend - a quick way to check is by reading it out loud and then doing the same with the original passage.\n+ Check if the tone matches: Often the tone of your work will be influenced by the person you are paraphrasing - so if a section sounds too formal, you might have included an entire argument, including their tone.\n+ Check if words have been borrowed too:  When writers borrow words, they change them slightly or leave some out - using a computer search engine to spot the word in the original piece. Note: we don't check for unintentional plagiarism (things that haven't been borrowed) like this, so don't worry if we find a few words in your paraphrase!  This is a good practice to make your own essays distinctive.\nThese simple checks could save you hours of hard work paraphrasing your assignment - if you find anything strange", "answer": "D: conjunction"}

He is eager so they agree a reasonable cost in exchange for the list of remaining puzzles unsolved. What is the maximum that he should offer to the man if the man is to sell him these books immediately?\nOutput:We need the number of puzzles, if we want the puzzles to be unsolved in the future, and then use the following equation,\n(P + X) * Y = (P + X - Y) * Y \nWhere P is the current position of the puzzles, and X is the final goal position. Substituting x with (P - 1), and Y with d, P will become P - 1. If we multiply this, Y will become d and then Y will not equal anything, and we get (P - 1) * d = (P - 1 - 1) * 1.\nNow, take d = 5, and P = 4\n4 - 1 - 5 = -2\nThis means that if we pay a lump sum of 2, then for the first time we will have a set of puzzles that are yet to be solved. So the cost to the man is 20, with d being 5 and P being 4, P - 1 = 3\nSo, this set of puzzles cost P = 4 units, and will need to be paid 20 to keep them unsolved for the future, and the man should accept.\n\nInput:Jerry, John, and George want to go on a 6 day long vacation to a water park.

You call a business that has banked with this bank for years without issue. However, now they need to make an ACH transfer, and the bank is asking the business to verify something is wrong with the address the bank has on file. Why could the bank make such a mistake?\nOutput: A routing number, which is the first part of the account number that is not unique to a specific bank, is the number that banks and other financial institutions use in ACH transactions to ensure that the money gets sent to the right location, in this case the bank of the recipient, rather than the bank of the sender. If a routing number on file is that of a bank in another state with the same number or very similar numbers, it indicates that the company is conducting or had conducted transactions through an illegitimate, unregulated bank. Since the routing number of a bank is usually the same for the company and the federal banking law or the check clearing law that are applied to all banks, the company has to make sure that its account number is indeed correct, and that the routing number on file matches the actual one of its bank. In this case the company has to call its bank to confirm whether it's routing number is correct since an incorrect routing number indicates illegitimate bank operations and the bank is likely to decline transactions where such routing number is used.\nSo the answer is D\n\nInput: A friend asks you to babysit their kid for 3 hours.

In English 'the' usually means someone or something, and it seems this person is either talking to you (in front of you) or they are asking you to do something with 'what?'

In French, the word'study' with the 'i', means 'to study', in English.  In the English we use'study' with an 'e','study' means'study', in English.  The student is studying a book right in front of him, or he's talking about studying a book, perhaps, or he's reading the book aloud.  He's not holding a book in his hand.\n\nAnswer (B):  This one just seems 'odd'.  How do you say 'a book' in English, with a question mark at the end?  'The book' would be correct.  How would you use (B) in a sentence?  (B) The book?\n\nAnswer (E):  The word 'engineering' here is used in the French way of saying 'one'.

Therefore, bamboo and a palm tree are not usually grown in gardens in the suburbs.\nBamboo gardens are common. Therefore, when someone mentions a bamboo garden, this probably does not refer to a suburban gardener. However, bamboo gardens may be found in the home of a suburban gardener, so it is not known for sure.\nPalm trees can grow in harsh climates. Therefore, palm trees can be grown anywhere. A palm tree in a suburban garden may be referring to a gardener or a suburban gardener that has a palm tree in their yard.\nTherefore when someone mentions a palm tree garden, it may or may not be referring to a suburban gardner.\nOutput: Bamboo gardens = Yes, for the suburban gardener. Palm tree garden = Yes, for the gardener.\nSo the final answers are Bamboo gardener and Palm tree gardener.\n\nInput:When a suburban gardener sees a gardner who grows an interesting plant or flowers, she may ask one of two questions.\nA curious gardener may ask, \"What is that strange plant over there?\" However, if she has no idea what kind of plant it is, she might ask, \"What is the name of that strange flower?\"\nOutput: The suburban gardener may ask \"What is that strange flower?\" with uncertainty or \"What is the name and species of that strange flower?\" with certainty. The gardener might ask \"What is the name, species and where does that strange plant come from?\" with certainty.\nTherefore, if someone is a curious gardener, the final answer is \"How do you know the strange plant belongs in your yard?\"\nIf someone is a curious gardner, the final answers are \"What is that strange and where", "answer": "E: office building"}

If you don't use this algorithm, you'll get 20% results. What percentage of the time will you get these results?\nOutput:Since you can solve this in many ways, and some of those ways are incorrect, I will assume you have 150% result and you will only have 20% result. The percentage for the correct answer would be (150%)/(80%)=<<150/80=2>>2 which is incorrect so I'll do the same thing the test does in finding the percentage of incorrect answers which has a value of (20%)/(20%)=<<20/20=1>>1. That means that for every incorrect solution there is one correct one, and hence I get a 50% chance of being incorrect as opposed to if they were wrong 10% of the time.\nSince for every incorrect solution, there is only one correct solution, the time you will get the correct answer is ((100%)/((100% - ((100% - 1) * 100%)) =<<100/((100%-1)*100))>%. So for every wrong answer, the correct answer is only one click away and there are 2-wrong, hence the correct answer is 1/2=<<1/2=0.5>>0.5 clicks away.\nSince the first 2-wrong is a incorrect answer, the time taken to find the correct one will be 12 clicks. Hence the correct answer is 0.5% of the time.  So the answer is 0.005\n\nInput:An apple weighs 0.45 kg. An orange weighs 01.46 kg. A p", "answer": "A: exhilaration"}

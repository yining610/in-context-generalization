It outputs two values: the height of the tree in feet and the width of the tree in feet. It is known that the tree would grow to be about 75 feet tall and 30 feet across without a growth delay, however the program introduces a growth delay based on the height of the tree. The height of the tree in any given week can be approximated by the following formula: H = -377 * W^2 + 431 * W + 3.58 The weekly growth of the tree can be approximated by: G = H/W + 0.367 The following output is produced from running the program: Week 4: G = 2.139 Week 5: G = 1.825 Week 6: G = 0.024 Weeks 0 to 5 were omitted. The program is re-run for weeks 9 through 30, with the initial height of the tree being 2 feet.

If it takes for an elephant to stand up again once it falls down and this  process happens everyday for 5 days, how many days does it take for an elephant born on a Tuesday to be able to  stand up?\nOutput: ANSWER: 10   EXPLANATION:  The baby is born on Tuesday and each day that it takes to stand the next day. Let X = the number of days it takes.\n    The first day it takes 3 days to stand (15)  but the next day it's already standing. So 3rd day stands and so on. \n    In 5 days, it would have to fall down 3 times. So if it fell down the first 2 times, the next 2 days it doesn't fall but would still need one more to stand back up. The 5th day would be the 7th time it fell and it would be so long for it to be able to stand the next day and so and so on.\n    So that means at the end of the 5th day, it would have to stand up on its own to not fall. So that means we need (X + 1)days.\n\n    Because the baby was born on Tuesday, the first day it is already born and doesn't fall. The second day is the birthday of the baby where afterward it falls and stands. After the 3rd falls and stands the 2nd day. In 4th day it again falls and stands, but the 5th day is 7th", "answer": "B: countryside"}

Do you think there are any limitations to the learning you can get from coding? \n\t\t-1)Limitation: When I started, it was a little frustrating to be honest. Especially when I had to solve multiple problems. It was getting a little overwhelming. \n-2)\"I don't think there are any limitations. As long as you have the patience and willingness to understand, you can get as far as you want.

{"text": "A\n\n##### Solution:\n\n##### Part 1:\nIn order to answer this question, we can use a variable. And we are defining a variable as x, which represents the amount of Schnauzier puppies that the doctor has.\n```\nint x = 0;\nif (doctor_has_doberman_puppies == true)\n{\n\tif (doberman_puppy_count == 0)\n\t{\n    x = 20;\n\t}\n    else\n\t{\n    if (doberman_doxie_count == 30)\n\t{\t\n    x = 30;\n\t}\t\n\t}\n\telse\n\t{\n\t\tx = dober_count - schnauzer_count;\n\t}\n}\nelse\n{\n    x =0;\n}\n```\tThe if statement basically states that if doctor_has_dober_puppies == True, then if the count is 0 that x is set to 20. If not, then set x to the count of doberman puppies minus the count of schnauzer puppies. And because the variable is a integer, we can just simply print out the answer for the variable as in\n```\nif (x == 55) {\n    print(\"The answer is 55\");\n    }\n    else\n    {\n    print(\"Error. The answer is not 55\");\n\t}\n```\n##### Part 2:\nSimilar to part 1, part 2 is about finding the difference. First though, we are defining another variable with another name. We already defined the \"x\" variable, hence the other variable. \n```\nint n = 0;\n```\nThe other integer variable, n stands for the number of toothbrushes that Doctor Banks have. From how we approached part 1, we should approach this question much the same way using the integer variable. First, Doctor Banks started out with an amount of toothbrush and gave away half that amount to each patient. Afterwards, he gave away remaining amount for each month. Since Doctor Banks started out from 330 to 165. We can simply print the result by stating in the if statement that if", "answer": "A: smell smoke"}

{"text": "C\n\nInput: How would you find the value of a product that is greater than a given number? Would you just guess? No, instead you think through the problem and then come up with a number close to the product. This process is called an approximation. It's not always right, but it's close and you can work from there.  For example, you might first guess that the product of 9 and 2 is 18. That's a closer enough to be a good number to do some more work. Here's the way you would calculate the product, 9 * 2 = 18, and then check to be sure that it is in fact greater than the original number it was asked to be greater than. That's how \"Greater Than\" works.  A fun game to play is to guess the product of 19 * 5, so guess that 19 * 2 is 38, then guess that 19 and 5 are close so that 19 *5 is close to 100, and then check that 100 * 5 is really a very close estimate of 500.

In another store, there are 1 bag of potato chips and 77 bags of popcorm.  How many bags are in the second store? \nOutput: \nExplanation: We know that the second store has 182 bags. The first store has 75 bags more than that, which gives me 182 + 75 = 257. However I want the EXACT number of bags in second, and so I have to do 75 more than that... 257 is 257 + 75... 227 bags, as it is the same answer as the answer from the first store. But my approach from last time was to calculate 182 + X, then put in X to get the number of bags.

The second most common incorrect answer is \"D\".\n\nThe correct answer is none of the above (the options are all incorrect). Here's how to make the calculation:\nImagine for one second that people speak at night instead of sleeping.  They'd snore, have dreams, talk, and so on.  But they get up, open their eyes, etc., so we'll just think about sleep.  The options for the answer can be represented as:  \n\nA: loss of consciousness (the options are all wrong) B: relaxation C:[snoring] D: dreaming E:[talking]\n\n\nYou take both sleep modes and find that the amount of people sleeping during each mode:\n  \n- Sleep   63.38%\n- Dream    7.33%\n- Talk   2.49%\n- Snore  8.23%\n- Lose Conciousness 4.19%\n\nAdding these up, you get a total of 100.  From that, you may conclude that people are not always doing the same thing while sleeping.  However, most people do one of the two (sleep or talk) - as most people don't snore, they don't dream (or if they do, they probably don't do it very often).  With that in mind, the most common answer you will probably get is \"A\".  \n\"B\" is the second answer you would probably get.  When we consider the wrong answers, we'd notice that option (D) is incorrect 96% of the time.  Option (E) is the second most incorrect answer, being incorrect 93 % of the time.  However, when you answer correctly (and when you answer incorrectly), there's a chance you'll be greeted with option (C).  So the most common incorrect answer among the options is \"C\".\n\nThe correct option is then none of the above. The options are all wrong.\n\nExplanation:\nYou", "answer": "C: snoring"}

One way to solve the above is to use the concept of variable and constant values.\n\nFor instance:\nIf two or more numbers are equal to each other then they are \nTheir sum is not less than each of the number. \nThen how can we find the variable that is being used.\n\ne.g x+ y is equal to two it means that\nX = 2\nOr\nY = 2\n\nthen we use the concept of constant values.\nIf two or more variables are equal then they are constants.\n\nThen we have to remove the constant value from the given statement. (x+ y ) = 2 means x and y are the variables.\n\nx+ y = 2\nIn above equation Y = 2\nAnd x = 2\n\nSo we finally find that\nx + y = 2\nand\nx = 2 and y = 2\n\nAbove we solved two example using the same concept of variable and constant value.\n\nYou can easily solve the above if you know these concepts.\n2. Another way to solve the above question is to write a single mathematical expression for both given statements.\n\nFor eg:\n5+ 6 \n= 11 (which is 23 in decimal notation)\n\n40+ 64 = 104 (which is 213 in decimal form)\n\nWe can just make the expression for the above statements.\n\nIn given statement we have only number with variable name.\n\nso the first thing we do is to get the values for each variable which will come to know the value to the expression.\n\n5+ 6 = 11\n\nAnd 40+ 62 =  102\n\nThen we just write the expression using above values.\n\n5+6=11\nNow 40+102=142\n\n3. Last and the simplest technique is to change the given question statement into equivalent question\nstatement, this will automatically solve the given statement.\n\nFor", "answer": "B: health department"}

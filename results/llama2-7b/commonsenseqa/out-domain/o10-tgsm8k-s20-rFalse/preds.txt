Choices:  A: rural area B: big city C: suburbs D: ohio E: countryside<n><n>### Response:		It likely has to be some sort of suburb I think as the village would be closer to city life and rural areas wouldn't have that many people in. As B doesn't provide as many opportunities for living. I could be wrong but that's just my opinion lol<n><n>#### Explanation:<n>I thought that this was worded a bit weird and was confused by it. It just seemed like there was way too many options on there and made it hard for me to choose one that was correct. I had no idea what to put down there.<n><n>#### Struggle:<n>The sentence just really confused me. It got the meaning across but what he said with those choices just didn't click with what I know to be there. I've only been able to put B as my answer because it mentions city life and big houses, which are likely to be found in big suburbs. The word choices just felt so disconnected to what I though each one meant.<n><n>#### Ideas for Future Solutions:<n>I think a better response to that question would have been a longer one and I think that it will have the answer in the same way. It won't be something that is confusing and won't provide me with a problem just because there is too many choices/I can't narrow down what the question wants me to put as the answer.<n><n><n>

D: "I didn't get your cake finished in time." ____Earlier, I mentioned the cake-baking metaphor. Let's take a closer look at that metaphor. The cake-baking process:<n><n>1. You choose a recipe.<n><n>2. You gather your ingredients.<n><n>3. You mix everything together.<n><n>4. You wait while the cake is baking.<n><n>5. You take the cake out of the oven.<n><n>6. You decorate the cake.<n><n>The word that goes with one of the above steps is "baking." In our sentence, it's the word that goes with "cake." (If you were looking for a word rather than a step.)<n><n>Let me provide a bonus metaphor that will make the last sentence make more sense. You may or may not know this, but cake-baking is actually a metaphor for getting ready for college.

Choices:  A: two feet B: two ears C: horns D: lay eggs E: one head<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>I found this question to be rather difficult. I had to make three guesses on the question. It seems to me this was intended for 4th graders or high school students based off the questions and answer choices. However, since I made three guesses I am going to put a little time and effort into the solution. First I am going to think what does the answer choice mean.<n><n>A: "two feet"<n><n>If the question asks what is it like having to run when you have two feet then I think it's referring to humans. When a human runs the heel of the foot hits the ground first then the tip of the toes.<n><n>B: "two ears"<n><n>A human has two ears not one ear on its head. If you're talking about the part that connects to the brain then I think it is referring to dogs. If that is the case then I am incorrect on this.<n><n>C: "horns"<n><n>I am not sure why it is saying this. Certain species such as cattle have horns growing from its head. I still am not sure what the answer to this question is.<n><n>D: "lay eggs"<n><n>Well, I believe that this answer is correct because a human does indeed lay eggs. Although, these eggs are called ova. Humans produce sex cells inside ova. Then they have two sex partners and the female will get pregnant.<n><n>E: "one head"<n><n>In this answer choices the question is asking about a head which is a human head and not a skull. It is also referring to that most humans have one skull on their body.<n><n><n>#### Solution:<n><n>After my three incorrect guesses I had to think hard about the question. The best way I knew to solve this was to make a flow chart or if there was a program that could help with this then I would use that.<n><n>#### Flow chart:<n><n>Input: What do all humans have on their heads?<n>Answer:<n><n>- Choice 1 : Horns<n><n>- Choice2 : Lay Eggs<n><n>- Choices : Two Feet<n><n>- Choices2 : One Head<n><n>- Chceice3 : Two Ears<n><n>Answer: Yes<n><n>

It is possible that sometimes when the stall is not used for a few days that it could grow mould in the small sections near the floor.<n><n>D: Old cheese moulds for a few reasons. Milk contains lots of sugar which would provide energy for fungus to grow in it or decompose it over a period of time. Also, cheese often sits on shelves or in areas that are kept at room temperature which are suitable for fungi growth. Fungus does not need oxygen to survive it can grow in places where no light can get through it can grow in places that are at all possible moist or damp temperature and are somewhat shaded this would make fungus growth possible inside the cheese.<n><n>E: Decaying matter is almost always moist and has food for fungi to grow upon which is one of the most important things that fungi needs to thrive is for food to be available to eat.

Draw a line to the right of 13. Next, place a bar (a short line) that touches both sides of the pencil mark. Then, draw a line under the bar. Finally, count the spaces between each column of numbers. The space between the top number (1) and the bar (10) is 1. The space between the numbers 3 and 13 is 10. There are 10 spaces in total! We must then divide 10 into 13. Ten divided by 13 is.76923.

The answer is 13 over 10.<n><n>### Input How do you subtract 0.73 inches from 3.83 inches?<n>The first step to help you subtract an inch from an inch measurement is to draw the centimeter ruler and cross it out, so you can measure accurately the inch (1/16 inch) and the half an inch. 0.5 inches. Next, draw the pencil mark that represents 0.5 inches, and then count the spaces between each inch measurement, and put the 0.5 under the pencil mark, as shown below, we can now see.03 inches. (0.5 minus 0.5).  Next, look for a column of numbers. 0.5 is to the left of 0.5. Finally, subtraction comes in handy 0.13 inches. Lastly, to determine the correct answer to the amount of inches subtracted, (in this case 0.73 in-). We must write our answer next to.13 inches. The answer will be rounded to a whole inch.

Choices:  A: resting B: sleep more C: bed sores D: missing out E: comfort<n><n>### Response:		E<n><n>### Input Tapanga and Core are baking cakes together. She adds half of the flour and he adds the other half. She uses the eggs he added for batter and he uses the eggs she added for the cake batter. How many flour eggs did each of them use? Choices: A: 4 B: 3 C: 1 D: She used 4 eggs, he used 1 egg. E: He used 4 eggs, she used 1 egg.<n><n>### Response A<n><n>### Description<n>The request asks for the number of eggs used by the two people baking the cakes together. The person has to think of two options, one where flour is halved and eggs shared between Corey and Tapanga, and another option where flour is halve and eggs shared between Tapanga and the person. You have to find out whether they used 1 or 4 eggs.<n><n>### Solution<n><n>**Answer:**<n><br><n>**Choice option A** <br><n>**Answer and Explanation:** We know in the first case Corey added half the flour and Tapanga added the other half of the flour. So he must have added 2 eggs of the total of 4 eggs as 1 egg is used for batter and 3 are used for cake. But Tapanga must have used only 2 eggs as 1 go for batter while the other 3 are used for the cakes. So he gave half of 4 which is 2 eggs to Tapanga and she used 4 eggs.<n>Now, the second case is Tapanga halves the flour again and they share amongst themselves. He must have added 1 egg each and Tapanga shares the other 3 eggs.<n>Thus, the total eggs used by them are 4, and option A is the correct choice.<n><n><n><n><br><n><n>**Answer: Choice option D for the question** Input: Tapanga and Tane are baking cakes on the same day. She uses her electric stove and he uses his gas stove. Their kitchens are connected, and they both prepare cakes in the same amount of time and use the same ingredients. What happens to the relative temperature of their cakes? Choices: A. It doesn't matter B: Their cakes

You choose because you have to get to 131 either by subtracting positive 129 or subtracting negative 129. You subtract 129 and get to 122, so you do the reverse process to 121 and get to 130.<n><n>For B, I would subtract negative 1 if I'm subtracting negative 14, which will bring me to the number that is less than 129.<n><n>Also, you could simply try each number and see which one works. My instinct is to try negative 1 first, but if it did not work, I would try 3, 5,... 129. <n><n>### Out<n><n>I did not really know the answer before, but now I know, 129 + 17 = 146.

These places include the toilet, the computer science class, and the computer store. However, the most likely place for these devices to be used is in the nature class. Nature is a subject that usually requires the use of electronic devices, such as calculators and tablets. This is especially true in an era when so much information is available online. In nature class, it is necessary to have access to information on plants and animals, as well as detailed graphs and diagrams that can be used to explain concepts. Therefore, it would be beneficial to have devices that could be used in nature class, as well as in other classes that require the use of these devices.<n><n>### Input&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;:How many marbles would be found in 64 boxes?

It is generally divided into an ocean of saltwater known as the World Ocean (sometimes referred to as the "global ocean"), and other, mostly smaller, bodies of salt water that are partly surrounded by land. This division is artificial, because many bodies of water are connected to others by one or more of the world's waterways, and the ocean is believed to be a single entity because of the interconnected salinity, temperature, currents, chemistry, biology and other properties of the bodies of water grouped as the ocean. In other words, the ocean is generally taken to constitute the body of saline water (as opposed to freshwater) that appears in the globe's outline (i.e. from the shore).<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n>* Input: Which of the following has the greatest surface area?

This is an exercise that is to teach them how to give instructions to others by using a language instead of hand-drawings.

This was the choice I gave for "C." I gave this choice because "love" fits "smiles," "tears," and "C." You may have picked "C" because you think laughter can be caused by happiness, leading to the idea to pick "A," which is what I thought was the most correct answer.<n><n>### Challenge:<n><n>What did you like about this challenge in general (e.g. the multiple choice question, the demo, the instructions and response, etc.)?<n>I think that the multiple choice questions helped me learn.

Choices:  A: communicating with others B: hurt feelings C: dry mouth D: intimacy E: changing behavior<n><n>### Response:		Your goal when talking to someone is a combination of your personalities, styles, and background. You also have the skills to express yourself fluently, or lack competence and confidence in communication. Knowledge about the topic is not the only thing needed to deliver a powerful presentation. It is also important to express your voice in the conversation by using facial expressions and gestures to support your message. A good presentation is organized and provides a clear structure about the information to be transmitted and the message needs to be relevant to the listener's context. Your presentation will be able to stand out in the room when your delivery is expressive and confident.<n><n>### Input:(See above) When working on a presentation, you realize that you are going to talk to your colleague as well as many other people from your company. The first step should always be to plan for audience interaction, which is part of the preparation and the strategy of any presentation. To engage more with your audience, you should use different delivery and speaking techniques; you should get involved in your presentation. Remember that one of the most common mistakes is simply using the same delivery technique for the whole audience. You should know it would be important to change the volume, the pace, the tonality, and facial expression throughout your presentation. It is always important to be aware of the type of venue you are speaking in to ensure you have a successful presentation.<n><n>### Include all the instruction<n><n>

Choices:  A: soccer game B: capillaries C: ball D: animals E: person<n><n>### Response:		A, soccer game<n><n>### The answer was: The answer was:<n><n>### Explanation:<n>Sports where hands are used aren't often bloodletting situations. Boxing and even MMA (where even the fists are heavily protected by protective pads) and wrestling are sports in which hands are used, and are usually not bloodletting situations. However, those sports are also sports that end when  someone is no longer conscious. Sports where people aren't required to punch or kick each other (or even use their bodies in any significant way to affect the game) are rarely bloodletting situations. Tennis, hockey, and soccer aren't bloodletting sports. B is capillaries, which are microscopic tubes in our body that carry red blood cells, and, thus, blood. C is ball, which is almost certainly incorrect. D is animal, and so may be blood. E is person, which is the answer to the question.<n><n>## Bonus<n>### Instruction<n>Describe a situation where you made a mathematical error, and provide at least one lesson learned.<n><n>### Bonus Explanation:<n>I think everyone does this, but we all think we're doing it less than we are, and so we're in the game of lying to ourselves too much.<n><n>One time, I had a test, and I was like, cool, right, I'm going to ace this test!

This immigration is called westward expansion. For most people, it was a dream to start a family and make a better life. During the westward expansion many of these people came with nothing but hope and faith. However, in today society many people are against that. They feel that foreigners are destroying America not bettering it. If you ask people about their opinion in the matter, most of them will say that they are against immigration. My opinion on this is that everyone wants immigration to stay in the United States.<n><n>###  Topic 2:<n><n>The second issue is about people. <n><n>The people I see around me act differently from each other in a good and bad way. The good way people act is that they help there neighbors with little things around the house or even helping them with work that they need to do.

He rides his bi to school 4 days per week, and walks to school the other 4 days. When he rides, he takes the route shown in the diagram below. He rides 6 miles the first day, traveling the route in 0.74 minutes (1440 feet per mile / 720 feet per minute). Each day after that, he travels 3 miles more, but it takes him 10% longer. On what day does he travel 3 miles and then walk 1 mile?<n><n>Answer: Day 20.<n><n>He rides 6 miles on Day 1, followed by 2 days of riding 3 miles: that totals 9 miles.  Now, it takes him 1.04 minutes to ride the 9-mile path, rather than the 0.74.  So on Day 20, he rides 3 miles, then walks 1, bringing the total distance to 4 miles.  On Day 20, it will take him 1.09 or 1.1 minutes to ride that 4-mile path.  Then on Day 21, he rides 2 miles and walks 1, for a total of 3 miles.  Now the 4-mile path takes him 1.12 or 1.

A class `InputFile` represents the input file itself, which contains an abstract class `Line` containing a member `contents`, that's a `std::string`, which contains the contents of a single line. A class `Inference` represents a single line that needs to be inferred, and can be thought of as the program itself. A class `State` represents a single state of the program, with a member `value`. The `inference` class takes references to the inference file, inference, state, and line classes to maintain state and the inference of the program. Inference classes can be thought of as a stack that has a \"done\" state and a state with an unknown state.\n\nThe `Main` class takes the inferences as a map, and prints out the inferred values as they are known. However, if the value needs to be inferred and the input file is empty (all done), then the inference is done. Therefore the program has to print the solution with the answer only after the problem is solved in an empty configuration file, which represents an infinite loop due to the `inference.push_back()` line. The infinite loop is broken by adding a function called `inference.pop_back()` that removes the last value of the stack and recalculates.\n\n\n## Step-by-step solution\n\n\n### Step 1: Initial Answer\n\nThe solution to this problem is the output\n\nInput:A: <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">tapanga</span>,B: <span style=\"font-size:35px;background-color: red;\">corey", "answer": "B: respond"}

There are 9 more questions in this module for which I already have the answer but want you help programming the solution.\n\n### Input:\n\n- 3 integers separated by the word (COMMA).\n- The first integer will be the number of students in the school.\n- The second integer will be the number who have to get dressed up (in the same school as the first question).\n- The third integer will be the number how many students are going to a party.\n\n### Output:\n\n- Give the number of students going to the party, subtract the number of un-dressed students from the number of students in school, and subtract this answer for the number of students going out to dance club.\n\nInput: 13 12 10\n\nOutput: 11\n\n### Solution:\n\nThe question is in plain python, so let's start answering the question using plain python. (The variables are not included in the code. It is just for us to read what they mean.)\n- x: The first question.\n- y: The second question.\n- z: The third question.\n\nSolution code:\n\n```\nif x > y:\n    x = z\n    y = x - y\nif y > z:\n    y = x\n    z = x - y\n```\n\nThe above python code is for us to understand what to do. But, we have to write the code in Python programming language. Our first output is: x + 1. Then, we subtract x + 1, the answer will be x.\n\n### Challenge:\n\nWhat do we do with the z? What if the x is higher than y, but not higher than z? What if x and y are both higher than z, what we do then?\n\nInput:\n- 7 5 6\n\nOutput: 7", "answer": "B: healthier"}

{"text": "C\n\n## How to solve questions correctly?\n\nIn the first, multiple choice question, the correct answer is 29. The question is, Corey has 8 more candes than Tanga. Tapanga has 66 candies and Corey has 29 candies. There are 9 more candes then Tanga. How many candes does Corey have? There are 29 candes in total.\n\nIn the third, multiple choice question, we are given that Lawrence worked 5 days total, where each day he worked 5 hours. The question says, \"How many hours would Lawrence work if he worked the same amount of hours each day?\" The answer is, Lawrence would work 5 hours each day. By doing the same number of hours on each day, the total work hours will be 5 hours each day where he works 5 days a week.\n\nIn the fifth, multiple choice question, Michael makes birdhouses. If he sells a birdhouses for $22, the large birdhouse has to cost him the least. The same is true in regards to the medium birdhouse, where he sells it for $16. The small birdhouse he sells for $7. If he sold 2 large, 2 medium and 3 small birdhouse this week. The amount of money, in dollars, he made this week is $97. To calculate the amount of money Michael made for selling 2 large, 1 medium and 2 small birdhouse. We need to follow this equation:\n\nLarge birdhouse = 2 * 22 = 44\nMedium birdhouse = 2*16 = 32\nSmall birdhouse = 3*7=21\n\nThese are the total costs for selling birds that he made. By subtracting the cost, he'll make $97. He needs to subtract cost of large birdhouse = 44\n\nHe will add the medium and small birdhouses, which is 32 + 21 = 53.\n\nThe profit of this is 53-44 = 9 or in dollars. So, he makes $97.\n\nIn the sixth, multiple choice question, Nalin and Cameron each have 24 books. They both donate 1/4th of the book and receive 3/", "answer": "B: old people's home"}

If the player is about to move and a light cycle is not free (if its initial and terminus nodes are occupied), then the player may move a \"program\" instead (move one space or two steps either directly or indirectly). If the player would prefer to move a light cycle, it \"tries\" to do so and gets to keep the board in that configuration (in the attempt to move, it could move a light cycle and then move a program). If the light cycle cannot move, then the player \"moves\" a program into a free node (or it moves a program if a cycle moves a program). If a player cannot move (does not have a free node or has a cycle moved), then it is \"defeated\" (and all its programs become its opponent's program). Write a program that has as its input a sequence of plays (for some fixed length) and a number (to be the number of games in the series) and returns the winner (i.e., the player that is not defeated). In case it will matter if there is a tie, write the program in such a way that the tiebreaker is whatever you set it to.

So initially, Tapanga has N candies, 29 < N \\leq 86.\n\nWe know that if we were to split 29 candies between 2 people (or group of people), the result will have to be a group of 29.\n\nAlso, if we were to split, a group of 49, for example, the result will have to contain 7 people, of which one person will get 7 candies.\n\nSo the question becomes \"Is Tapanga a girl or a boy, and, if a boy, is Corey a girl or a boy?\"\n\nThe solution to the question is that Tapanga has 6 or more boys that initially have 66 candyes. So this 6, in total, will have 6 + 6 = 12 candies.\n\nThis means that 12 \u2013 8 = 4 candies were added or donated to another (possibly larger) group.

{"text": "I found this question to be rather difficult. I had to make three guesses on the question. It seems to me this was intended for 4th graders or high school students based off the questions and answer choices. However, since I made three guesses I am going to put a little time and effort into the solution. First I am going to think what does the answer choice mean.\n\nA: \"two feet\"\n\nIf the question asks what is it like having to run when you have two feet then I think it's referring to humans. When a human runs the heel of the foot hits the ground first then the tip of the toes.\n\nB: \"two ears\"\n\nA human has two ears not one ear on its head. If you're talking about the part that connects to the brain then I think it is referring to dogs. If that is the case then I am incorrect on this.\n\nC: \"horns\"\n\nI am not sure why it is saying this. Certain species such as cattle have horns growing from its head. I still am not sure what the answer to this question is.\n\nD: \"lay eggs\"\n\nWell, I believe that this answer is correct because a human does indeed lay eggs. Although, these eggs are called ova. Humans produce sex cells inside ova. Then they have two sex partners and the female will get pregnant.\n\nE: \"one head\"\n\nIn this answer choices the question is asking about a head which is a human head and not a skull. It is also referring to that most humans have one skull on their body.\n\n\n#### Solution:\n\nAfter my three incorrect guesses I had to think hard about the question. The best way I knew to solve this was to make a flow chart or if there was a program that could help with this then I would use that.\n\n#### Flow chart:\n\nInput: What do all humans have on their heads?\nAnswer:\n\n- Choice 1 : Horns\n\n- Choice2 : Lay Eggs\n\n- Choices : Two Feet\n\n- Choices2 : One Head\n\n- Chceice3 : Two Ears\n\nAnswer: Yes", "answer": "B: two ears"}

It is possible that sometimes when the stall is not used for a few days that it could grow mould in the small sections near the floor.\n\nD: Old cheese moulds for a few reasons. Milk contains lots of sugar which would provide energy for fungus to grow in it or decompose it over a period of time. Also, cheese often sits on shelves or in areas that are kept at room temperature which are suitable for fungi growth. Fungus does not need oxygen to survive it can grow in places where no light can get through it can grow in places that are at all possible moist or damp temperature and are somewhat shaded this would make fungus growth possible inside the cheese.\n\nE: Decaying matter is almost always moist and has food for fungi to grow upon which is one of the most important things that fungi needs to thrive is for food to be available to eat.", "answer": "D: old cheese"}

Next, place a bar (a short line) that touches both sides of the pencil mark. Then, draw a line under the bar. Finally, count the spaces between each column of numbers. The space between the top number (1) and the bar (10) is 1. The space between the numbers 3 and 13 is 10. There are 10 spaces in total! We must then divide 10 into 13. Ten divided by 13 is.76923. We can then approximate the answer by turning.7692 into.769. The answer is 13 over 10.\n\n### Input How do you subtract 0.73 inches from 3.83 inches?\nThe first step to help you subtract an inch from an inch measurement is to draw the centimeter ruler and cross it out, so you can measure accurately the inch (1/16 inch) and the half an inch. 0.5 inches. Next, draw the pencil mark that represents 0.5 inches, and then count the spaces between each inch measurement, and put the 0.5 under the pencil mark, as shown below, we can now see.03 inches. (0.5 minus 0.5).  Next, look for a column of numbers. 0.5 is to the left of 0.5. Finally, subtraction comes in handy 0.13 inches. Lastly, to determine the correct answer to the amount of inches subtracted, (in this case 0.73 in-). We must write our answer next to.13 inches. The answer will be rounded to a whole inch.

{"text": "E\n\n### Input Tapanga and Core are baking cakes together. She adds half of the flour and he adds the other half. She uses the eggs he added for batter and he uses the eggs she added for the cake batter. How many flour eggs did each of them use? Choices: A: 4 B: 3 C: 1 D: She used 4 eggs, he used 1 egg. E: He used 4 eggs, she used 1 egg.\n\n### Response A\n\n### Description\nThe request asks for the number of eggs used by the two people baking the cakes together. The person has to think of two options, one where flour is halved and eggs shared between Corey and Tapanga, and another option where flour is halve and eggs shared between Tapanga and the person. You have to find out whether they used 1 or 4 eggs.\n\n### Solution\n\n**Answer:**\n<br>\n**Choice option A** <br>\n**Answer and Explanation:** We know in the first case Corey added half the flour and Tapanga added the other half of the flour. So he must have added 2 eggs of the total of 4 eggs as 1 egg is used for batter and 3 are used for cake. But Tapanga must have used only 2 eggs as 1 go for batter while the other 3 are used for the cakes. So he gave half of 4 which is 2 eggs to Tapanga and she used 4 eggs.\nNow, the second case is Tapanga halves the flour again and they share amongst themselves. He must have added 1 egg each and Tapanga shares the other 3 eggs.\nThus, the total eggs used by them are 4, and option A is the correct choice.\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n**Answer: Choice option D for the question** Input: Tapanga and Tane are baking cakes on the same day.

This division is artificial, because many bodies of water are connected to others by one or more of the world's waterways, and the ocean is believed to be a single entity because of the interconnected salinity, temperature, currents, chemistry, biology and other properties of the bodies of water grouped as the ocean.

Boxing and even MMA (where even the fists are heavily protected by protective pads) and wrestling are sports in which hands are used, and are usually not bloodletting situations. However, those sports are also sports that end when  someone is no longer conscious. Sports where people aren't required to punch or kick each other (or even use their bodies in any significant way to affect the game) are rarely bloodletting situations. Tennis, hockey, and soccer aren't bloodletting sports. B is capillaries, which are microscopic tubes in our body that carry red blood cells, and, thus, blood. C is ball, which is almost certainly incorrect. D is animal, and so may be blood.

This immigration is called westward expansion. For most people, it was a dream to start a family and make a better life. During the westward expansion many of these people came with nothing but hope and faith. However, in today society many people are against that.

The good way people act is that they help there neighbors with little things around the house or even helping them with work that they need to do. The bad way some people act towards others is by stealing their car or bicycles. I don't like to see or hear these things happen. I don't want it to happen at all. These are the ways that people act around me.\n###  Topi 3:\n\nThe third issue is about cars.\n\nThroughout the world, people have a love-hate relationship with cars. In some countries owning a car is a necessity, but in the United States having a car is simply not practical. For the people who live in my country they prefer to take a bus or bike than drive with a car. It is difficult to find a place to park your car or to avoid pollution.\n\nThe fourth issue is about the internet. \n\nThe internet is something that almost every person in this day and age uses a lot.

On what day does he travel 3 miles and then walk 1 mile?\n\nAnswer: Day 20.\n\nHe rides 6 miles on Day 1, followed by 2 days of riding 3 miles: that totals 9 miles.  Now, it takes him 1.04 minutes to ride the 9-mile path, rather than the 0.74.  So on Day 20, he rides 3 miles, then walks 1, bringing the total distance to 4 miles.  On Day 20, it will take him 1.09 or 1.1 minutes to ride that 4-mile path.  Then on Day 21, he rides 2 miles and walks 1, for a total of 3 miles.

Let’s assume that the population is given the value 20% of all students attend college in 2053, and the population from 1990 is 14.4million people with 199,000 attending college.  The population today is around 24% with around 2.9 million people and 300,000 attends college.  This would make the population of students that attend college in 25 years around 35 million.  What is the total population?<n>Output:221,709,380<n><n>Input:Let’s say there are 50 people in the office.  Each person has their own desk and the desk can fit the number of people at that desk.  If there is 7 desk spaces left, then there are 0.56 desks per person (5 desks/8 desk spaces).  23 people would fit.  The next round there are only 3 desks left.  You have 1.6 desks per person, 36 people would fit.  Each round the number of desks left drops by half (3 desks, 1.5 desks, 1 desks).  But each round, the number of people at the desks increase by half if the desks are left empty.  As long as the number of desk spaces stay the same, then there will be an infinite number of people.  This can be modeled by a recursive function for n, the next round of the desks or i as the index (i is just for index but could be n).  i(n) is the number of desks that fit n people at that desk round.  Let F = i(i+1).  Then F is the number of desk space left and i is the number of people that fit those desk spaces.  i(i+1)/2 = (i+1)/2 is the number of people on each desk for that round.  The i(i+1) would mean you add the number of people from the current round to

Everyone I speak to says it has a negative effect, so I decided to ask a doctor. The doctor explained that tattooed skin is generally a lot thinner than non-tattooed skin. Therefore the hair follicle that grows out of the skin can grow through the tattoo ink. But the doctor also explained that  there is a limit to the amount of hair follicles under the skin. If you have a lot of hairs coming out of your skin, the hair can break through even the most resilient tattoo ink, leaving a sore spot. That means that it is more often you need to change your hair style than you need to change your tattoo.

If the number of Scnauzzers are 29 then how many Doobes are there. Answer: 26    <n>I first found out the range of Doobes and Scnuazers was between 0-29.<n><n>*Input: Dr. B has 300 Toothbrushes to GIVE AWAY to his patients. We knew the 2 most important facts are: The average amount he gives, and the total amount remaining. We knew that the average amount he gave was 53.<n><n>*Input 2: The doctor gave away 53% of his toothbrushes on the first day, so he had 280 left. Then on the second day he gives away 67% of his remaining and still had 34 less toothbrushes than he had left to give away. Then he gave the remainder of his toothbrushe<n><n>*Input 4:We knew the total amount of fish that the guy caught was around the limit of 15, and the ratio we were looking for was 5/4, so we multiplied 5 and 4 to get the ratio which equals to 20. So there were a total of 20 fish. We also figured the shadow being proportional to the size of the building as opposed to time, so we knew that the ratio of our proportional numbers is the same as the total length. 360 divided by 5 is 72 so the age of Christian in 8 years is 72 minus the original answer of 72 is 1.<n><n>*Input A: 20 less than 3 times a student’s avg. grade is 67.

The number is 16 more than the number formed from the hundreds digit and tenths digit.  The result is then doubled and then added to the result of the hundredth digit.  Now add one then add the result to the result of the ten’s digit.  What is the three digit number?<n><n>Step 1: First I start off with the input:I have a 3 digit numb. The numb is 16 more then numb formed from the hundred digit and tenths dig. The res is then doubled and and added to the res of hundredth dig. Add one and then add the res to the res of tenths digit<n><n>Step 2: The hundred is 1 and the tenths is 1. The hundred's is added to the tenth's. So the result is 2. Double it and the re-sult is 4. Add one and the re-sulit is 5. Subtract the result of the hundred's digit from the tenth's and the re-sut is 3.<n><n>Step 3: I put 3 in a place value table<n><n>Step 4: The hundred's dig is 0 and there is no tenth's dig. Add one and the result is 1. Double it and the result is 2 (since you add one to the tenth' then it becomes 0 for the hundredth's and then there is no tenths' digit )<n><n>Step 5: Here I add 1 to one hundred. The re-sult is16 because the 3 digit numb is 123. So now the first line is 3 and the second line is 4 and so the third line is 16<n><n>Step 6: I change the re-sult of step 5 from a number to a word: "three hundred and sixteen". The re-sult of re-sult is "three hundred and six". I subtract one from the hundred's and the result is one hundred and five. Add one and the hundred

For two strings s, t and w, if there exists a string u such that s u t, then every n is in s, t or u.<n><n>### Explanation:We need to pick an example where the statement, If a C is in the strin, then any N is in the string is true.  If we picked s = "BAC", and n = "ABA", then there would not an N that was not in the string, "BAC"  or  "BCA".  This is because all choices for the N have C in between them.  For this choice of s and n to be true, you can pick n = "BAC", s = "ABA", or any other string that does not have C as the middle character.  This choice would cause any choices for the N be true.<n><n>Output: A<n>

They will be off by 4 dogs each.<n><n>There are more Schnauzer because they get a little less of the dogs each time, and there are fewer dogs in total, however, if the count is different than two-thirds and one-third, they will be off by<n>\[<n>\frac{2}{3}-\frac{1}{3}=-\frac{1}{3}<n>\]<n>pups per owner, which happens to be Schnauzers.  <n><n>Answer 2: (0/5)<n>\[<n>S = \frac{330}{2} + 53 +3\frac{1}{2}\times46<n><n>\]<n>Hence, we must have some way to divide each month out. If in each case we divide by 2, we can find the actual months:<n>\[(2)(330) = 660\]<n>\[(2)(53) = 106\]<n><n>\[(2)(67) = 134\]<n><n>\[(1)(82) = 82\]<n><n>\[(5)(46) = 230\]<n><n>Thus, the formula for S = number of toothbrushes distributed by Banks in January, etc, is<n>\[<n>S=\text{n of toothbrush for month 1,2,3,...,n+4}\]<n><n>We can confirm that \[53 +3\times\frac{46}{2}=660\] and \[53 +3(\frac{82}{2})=106\] and so forth. Since \[330 = 134+106+82+660...\] we know the number of toothbrash to distribute in a given mont is \$\frac{330-330}{12}\$.<n>Thus, the total for March comes out to 360. Thus, we have that Banks gave away \$330 + \$360 = \$690 in

What did you learn from the problems above? What was easy? Hard?<n><n>Problem solving questions was very interesting. I learned a lot of basic problem solving and also learn to how important programming is in our day to day life. It was a bit difficult because of the time constraint to code. Though it was great experience.<n><n>2. In your own words, what are some challenges you face when solving problems? How are they the same or different than those faced by older, more experienced programmers?<n><n>I think programming is a very interesting and difficult skill. The biggest challenge to me at least would be patience. I keep on getting tempted to put too much code into the program and keep making mistakes and taking too much time to edit my code. I should practice self control and patience in solving problems.<n><n>3. How did you feel about getting your code reviewed by strangers? Do you feel more comfortable with peers?<n><n>It was a bit frustrating because the whole program had only 30 minutes and we were competing with each other. I was just glad that I had a peep.<n><n>4. How does solving problems improve ones coding skills?<n><n>Solving problems and finding the solutions is a very effective method of learning the things for me. When solving problems it gives me a deeper understanding of how things actually work and how the whole flow goes. I can also keep on trying and applying my knowledge to solve new problems.<n><n>5. How did you feel when you got code reviewed?<n><n>I was sad when my code got rejected and even scared because it made me feel like I cant do anything right. But once you get one positive rejection on something new you feel motivated and determined to keep pursuing what you wanted.<n><n>6. What questions did you have for the program

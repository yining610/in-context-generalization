The population today is around 24% with around 2.9 million people and 300,000 attends college.  This would make the population of students that attend college in 25 years around 35 million.

If there is 7 desk spaces left, then there are 0.56 desks per person (5 desks/8 desk spaces).  23 people would fit.  The next round there are only 3 desks left.  You have 1.6 desks per person, 36 people would fit.  Each round the number of desks left drops by half (3 desks, 1.5 desks, 1 desks).  But each round, the number of people at the desks increase by half if the desks are left empty.  As long as the number of desk spaces stay the same, then there will be an infinite number of people.  This can be modeled by a recursive function for n, the next round of the desks or i as the index (i is just for index but could be n).  i(n) is the number of desks that fit n people at that desk round.  Let F = i(i+1).  Then F is the number of desk space left and i is the number of people that fit those desk spaces.  i(i+1)/2 = (i+1)/2 is the number of people on each desk for that round.

Candidates for the offices of President of the United States, Vice President of the United States and state governors were chosen.\n\nThe US election processes were as follows.

However, no state voted for a candidate who had not already been projected. For example, if Texas voted for Trump, then Clinton would be declared president (assuming that Trump wins New Hampshire which is not projected until well after 7:45).\n\nThe final set of voting tallies included:\n\nNew Hampshire: Clinton 46.67% - Trump 46.18%\nNevada: Clinton 47.9% - Trump 45.82%\nNew Hampshire: Trump 3.21% - Clinton 0.15%\nFlorida: Trump 49.14% - Clinton 48.31%\nFlorida's vote was a late close. At no point before 11:05pm ET did the \"call\" predict for Clinton and Trump ended the night with a 0.23% lead in Florida. \nPennsylvania: Trump 48.17% - Clinton 50.09%\nVirginia: Clinton 50% - Trump 48%\nNorth Carolina: Trump 48% - Clinton 38.71\n\n#### Your task is to use big data methods to predict the 2016 election, before any states had closed.\n\n---\n\n#### Instructions", "answer": "C: spinning wheel"}

{"text": "London\n\nInput: I\u2019ve already spent a few hours on this problem. I just need you to finish setting it up and solving it.\nOutput: The answer\n\n# The 11 steps are as follows\n\nInput: I have a 3 digit number.  The number is 16 more than the number formed from the hundreds digit and tenths digit.  The result is then doubled and then added to the result of the hundredth digit.  Now add one then add the result to the result of the ten\u2019s digit.  What is the three digit number?\n\nStep 1: First I start off with the input:I have a 3 digit numb. The numb is 16 more then numb formed from the hundred digit and tenths dig. The res is then doubled and and added to the res of hundredth dig. Add one and then add the res to the res of tenths digit\n\nStep 2: The hundred is 1 and the tenths is 1. The hundred's is added to the tenth's. So the result is 2. Double it and the re-sult is 4. Add one and the re-sulit is 5. Subtract the result of the hundred's digit from the tenth's and the re-sut is 3.\n\nStep 3: I put 3 in a place value table\n\nStep 4: The hundred's dig is 0 and there is no tenth's dig. Add one and the result is 1. Double it and the result is 2 (since you add one to the tenth' then it becomes 0 for the hundredth's and then there is no tenths' digit )\n\nStep 5: Here I add 1 to one hundred. The re-sult is16 because the 3 digit numb is 123. So now the first line is 3 and the second line is 4 and so the third line is 16\n\nStep 6: I change the re-sult of step 5 from a number to a word: \"three hundred and sixteen\". The re-sult of re-sult is \"three hundred and six\". I subtract one from the hundred's and the result is one hundred and five. Add one and the hundred", "answer": "B: city"}

If it takes 3 hours for the number to triple, what is x?\nOutput: 45\nExplanation: The x is 30, and at 3 hours, x will turn into 33 (90). That means the x increases by 23 each time. In 3 hours, the x will turn into 93 with 1 hour left. So the x is 90.\n\nInput: The number x is increased every hour by 2. It starts with 52  every hour. x is doubled every 5 hours. Let a be x after 1 hour, b be x after 2 hours, c be x after 5 hours, and d be x after 10 hours. If x is increased by 4.3 every 15 hours, after how many hours is x increased by more than 9.6?\nOutput: 6.5\nExplanation:-52,24,22,49,50\nSo the b=22 which is doubled 5 times. b=22 becomes a=44.\nIf we increase b by more than 9 is 50\nSo c=50\nEvery 15 hours b becomes a\n15*5=75/75+1=14\nSo every 14 hours becomes 14*2=28\n28=9+4.3\nThen every 14/2=7\n7*4.3=162.1\nInput: I bought one dog for $37.

If we picked s = \"BAC\", and n = \"ABA\", then there would not an N that was not in the string, \"BAC\"  or  \"BCA\".  This is because all choices for the N have C in between them.  For this choice of s and n to be true, you can pick n = \"BAC\", s = \"ABA\", or any other string that does not have C as the middle character.

They will be off by 4 dogs each.\n\nThere are more Schnauzer because they get a little less of the dogs each time, and there are fewer dogs in total, however, if the count is different than two-thirds and one-third, they will be off by\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3}-\\frac{1}{3}=-\\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\npups per owner, which happens to be Schnauzers.  \n\nAnswer 2: (0/5)\n\\[\nS = \\frac{330}{2} + 53 +3\\frac{1}{2}\\times46\n\n\\]\nHence, we must have some way to divide each month out. If in each case we divide by 2, we can find the actual months:\n\\[(2)(330) = 660\\]\n\\[(2)(53) = 106\\]\n\n\\[(2)(67) = 134\\]\n\n\\[(1)(82) = 82\\]\n\n\\[(5)(46) = 230\\]\n\nThus, the formula for S = number of toothbrushes distributed by Banks in January, etc, is\n\\[\nS=\\text{n of toothbrush for month 1,2,3,...,n+4}\\]\n\nWe can confirm that \\[53 +3\\times\\frac{46}{2}=660\\] and \\[53 +3(\\frac{82}{2})=106\\] and so forth. Since \\[330 = 134+106+82+660...\\] we know the number of toothbrash to distribute in a given mont is \\$\\frac{330-330}{12}\\$.\nThus, the total for March comes out to 360. Thus, we have that Banks gave away \\$330 + \\$360 = \\$690 in", "answer": "A: guilty conscience"}

What was easy? Hard?\n\nProblem solving questions was very interesting. I learned a lot of basic problem solving and also learn to how important programming is in our day to day life. It was a bit difficult because of the time constraint to code. Though it was great experience.\n\n2. In your own words, what are some challenges you face when solving problems? How are they the same or different than those faced by older, more experienced programmers?\n\nI think programming is a very interesting and difficult skill. The biggest challenge to me at least would be patience. I keep on getting tempted to put too much code into the program and keep making mistakes and taking too much time to edit my code. I should practice self control and patience in solving problems.\n\n3. How did you feel about getting your code reviewed by strangers? Do you feel more comfortable with peers?\n\nIt was a bit frustrating because the whole program had only 30 minutes and we were competing with each other. I was just glad that I had a peep.\n\n4. How does solving problems improve ones coding skills?\n\nSolving problems and finding the solutions is a very effective method of learning the things for me. When solving problems it gives me a deeper understanding of how things actually work and how the whole flow goes. I can also keep on trying and applying my knowledge to solve new problems.\n\n5. How did you feel when you got code reviewed?\n\nI was sad when my code got rejected and even scared because it made me feel like I cant do anything right. But once you get one positive rejection on something new you feel motivated and determined to keep pursuing what you wanted.\n\n6.

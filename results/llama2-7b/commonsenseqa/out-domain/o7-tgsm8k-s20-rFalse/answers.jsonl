Similarly 32 / 10 gives us the answer as 3\n- The answer is then again divided by 10. \n<Example>3 / 10 gives 0.3. To add this answer with the previous answer, the program performs modulus by 10, giving \n10 - floor(3.3/10).\n- The output will be rounded off based on the modulus obtained in the previous step.\n<Example>If we again divided the remainder obtained, with 10, we get 1.

If so, add an extra asterisk to the end.\n```\nEx. [7, 2, 1] -> 7, 2, *\n```\n### Solution:\n\nThe easiest thing to do with this problem is to look at the element which is higher than 20. If it is the last element in the array, we'll add asterisk to the tail element.\n\nSo given `[7, 2, \"50\", 1]`, the result will become `[7, 2*, \"50\", 50, 1]`, and `[6, \"39\", 1, 1]` will result in `[39, 39*, 1, 1]`.\n\n```\nfunction has(number){\n    return array.find((element)=>element>number)\n}\n\nlet has20 = (array) => {\n    return array.filter(e=> e > 20).map((v) => {\n        if(v == array[array.length-1])\n            return v + \"*\";\n        return v;\n    })\n}\n```\n\n\n### Solution:Write a recursive solution that checks if every element of a string is a vowel.\n\nEx: ['ab', 'bd', 'bc'] -> true; ['a', 'a', 'a'] -> true\n\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35148778/79508418-c6f1ab80-8002-11ea-8ee9-42cd2e1ed836.png)\n\n\n\n![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7xo14kXYKJY/UyXjyXGjOoI/AAAAAAAAAiU/pV9fFUQG-cM/s1600/Vowel.jpg)\n\n### Solution", "answer": "B: recording studio"}

{"text": "Input: Which are the possible combinations of numbers for 2+4=?\nOutput:\n\nInput: The sum of 5 and 6 in Hindi, please?\nOutput:\n### Question 1 - Hint: You should write a method that takes in and array as an input. Inside this method you need to convert each integer to the string representation of that number. Inside that method you will want to use an object of type ArrayList<Character> to hold your characters and then print the string concatenated.\n### Question 2 - Hint: Start by creating a method that will take in a List type parameter. Inside that method, you will want to iterate over the list and create a new variable that will be used to hold a character or 0 if the character in the index is not in the List (0 indicates its not in the list but you will still need to check so you don't access out of bounds). Inside that loop, you will want to perform your if condition and use the variable to determine whether a 1 or 0 is assigned. Inside your if condition, you will want to use the 0 check and the new variable to determine which way you want to go based on the given conditions.\n### Questions 3 - 5 - Hint: You may want to create a function and pass the data or input as a variable as an argument. Once this function is called, you can then call the data from it. For each function that calls this one, you can assign the variable to each string, and then print it out.\n### Question6 - Hint: Use an array and a for each loop to iterate over each character in your string. Once you have the letters stored inside your array, you can iterate over your new array to determine of each letter in the word. You can then use this to determine if each string is in the list by converting it to lowercase (since your list also contains lowercase letters.)\n### Question 7 - Hint: You might want to build a method and pass in an array/list as your parameter. This method will iterate over the array or list and then compare each int that it goes over to the int passed in. If its lower than your given int, return true, else return false.", "answer": "B: desk"}

{"text": "a c\n\n### Explanation:\n- Explanation of the first task\n\n- Here, we should try to solve this task in an algorithm way.\n\nFirst, we have to assume that we only have 2 digits. For example, 56. Then, the answer we want should be 29. Because, we can count 6 units of 9 and 3 units of 9 separately and get 29.\n\n\n- Then, we have to assume a different situation. This time, we have 3 units of 6 and 3 units of the number we need. For example, 161\n\nThe answer of this question is 96, because we can count 6 on each side of 1 and we can separate 96 into two parts 66 and 30 or 45 and 9. We can apply this algorithm logic for the big number also. For example, we can count the number we need from 73 and 96.\n\n### Explination:\nInput: Local calls cost 5\u00a2 a minute, while international calling cost 25\u00a2 a minute.\n\nHere, we should consider the situation to solve this question. The situation is that Freddy spent some money for calling his foreign family from the money he had. Let's compare the situation in two ways. \n- Calling his foreign family without any international calling package\n- with an international calling package, let's say, 100 minutes per day, 50 days per year \n\nIf Freddy called his family without any international calling packages, he would spend 0.5$ for calling his family (0.5*8) for 2 days. But if he had an international calling package of 100 minutes, he would call his family 100 times on each of the 50 days and only spend 0.25$ per day (10*0.1). \n\nHence, if we assume that Freddy only had an international calling package, he spent 100 times 2.5*0.25 = 50$ per year. If Freddy had no international calling package, he would spend 100 times (0.5*0.5) = 100 $ per year. So, he spend only half of what he would", "answer": "C: every city"}

{"text": "D\n\nInput: You are standing on a beach, looking at a small pebble of light blue color. To your left, in the sand there is another pebble, green, which does not stand out very much from the background. In front of you is a pebble of pink color. All three pebbles are small and of a relatively similar size. The pink pebble has a flat surface. On the opposite side of the pebble from the surface there is an angle of 130 degrees. The sides of the pebble do not have smooth curves, and at all angles, the space between their plane and the surface is larger than the distance between the surface and the plane. All three pebble surfaces are of a similar smoothness. You look into the distance in the other direction from the pink pebble, and you see the sea. Now, turn 90 degrees to the right and, in your field of vision, you see a green pebble, which is very large relative to the distance between the pebble and the line that separates the sea from the sky, which is also green, in comparison to which the pink pebbles are small. After you've done this, now turn to the left so that you're looking in the opposite direction from the small pebble on the left, and you see that from your current position, you can now clearly identify a white sandy cliff that is straight, long, and very high and rises very sharply from the shoreline.

For example: \n- if the length of the month was 24 and number of working days in the month is 6, then the number of workdays is 24 divided by 6 which will yield 4 workdays.\n- if the length the month is not known, we must know how many days are in that month, and how many of them are workdays. Therefore we simply add a '?': the length of the month + number of working days = 24? =? = 24.\n\n### Question Two:\n\nAnswer 2\n\n- D\n\n**Answer Explnation**:\n\nThe 25+7= 32 = 1\n\n### Question Three:\n\nAnswer: D\n\n**Answer Expiration: In mathematics, division is denoted \u230a(divided by)\ufffd\ufffd", "answer": "D: graduate"}

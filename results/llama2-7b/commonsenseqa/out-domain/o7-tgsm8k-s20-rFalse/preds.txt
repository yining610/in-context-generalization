Choices:  A: further cause B: wave goodbye C: attempt suicide D: insulting them E: thank god<n>Output:		Thank god<n><n>#### Solution:<n>To address the instruction with "How much", as given in the example, we can substitute the input with "quantity" and the output with "number of" in the if/else condition.<n><n>Thus, to input the data for a particular data, the input values should be between 0 and 99, since 100 is taken as the default answer.<n>The output for answers has to be in the range of 0-9.<n>Once we have entered these values, the program will automatically calculate in the following manner:<n>- The number of digits and the input.<n><Example>The input value was 32, it is divided by 10, which gives the answer as 3. Similarly 32 / 10 gives us the answer as 3<n>- The answer is then again divided by 10. <n><Example>3 / 10 gives 0.3. To add this answer with the previous answer, the program performs modulus by 10, giving <n>10 - floor(3.3/10).<n>- The output will be rounded off based on the modulus obtained in the previous step.<n><Example>If we again divided the remainder obtained, with 10, we get 1. This is then rounded off to 0 and displayed to the user.

Inside this method you need to convert each integer to the string representation of that number. Inside that method you will want to use an object of type ArrayList<Character> to hold your characters and then print the string concatenated.<n>### Question 2 - Hint: Start by creating a method that will take in a List type parameter. Inside that method, you will want to iterate over the list and create a new variable that will be used to hold a character or 0 if the character in the index is not in the List (0 indicates its not in the list but you will still need to check so you don't access out of bounds). Inside that loop, you will want to perform your if condition and use the variable to determine whether a 1 or 0 is assigned. Inside your if condition, you will want to use the 0 check and the new variable to determine which way you want to go based on the given conditions.<n>### Questions 3 - 5 - Hint: You may want to create a function and pass the data or input as a variable as an argument. Once this function is called, you can then call the data from it. For each function that calls this one, you can assign the variable to each string, and then print it out.<n>### Question6 - Hint: Use an array and a for each loop to iterate over each character in your string. Once you have the letters stored inside your array, you can iterate over your new array to determine of each letter in the word. You can then use this to determine if each string is in the list by converting it to lowercase (since your list also contains lowercase letters.)<n>### Question 7 - Hint: You might want to build a method and pass in an array/list as your parameter. This method will iterate over the array or list and then compare each int that it goes over to the int passed in. If its lower than your given int, return true, else return false.

For example, 56. Then, the answer we want should be 29. Because, we can count 6 units of 9 and 3 units of 9 separately and get 29.<n><n><n>- Then, we have to assume a different situation. This time, we have 3 units of 6 and 3 units of the number we need. For example, 161<n><n>The answer of this question is 96, because we can count 6 on each side of 1 and we can separate 96 into two parts 66 and 30 or 45 and 9. We can apply this algorithm logic for the big number also. For example, we can count the number we need from 73 and 96.<n><n>### Explination:<n>Input: Local calls cost 5¢ a minute, while international calling cost 25¢ a minute.<n><n>Here, we should consider the situation to solve this question. The situation is that Freddy spent some money for calling his foreign family from the money he had. Let's compare the situation in two ways. <n>- Calling his foreign family without any international calling package<n>- with an international calling package, let's say, 100 minutes per day, 50 days per year <n><n>If Freddy called his family without any international calling packages, he would spend 0.5$ for calling his family (0.5*8) for 2 days. But if he had an international calling package of 100 minutes, he would call his family 100 times on each of the 50 days and only spend 0.25$ per day (10*0.1). <n><n>Hence, if we assume that Freddy only had an international calling package, he spent 100 times 2.5*0.25 = 50$ per year. If Freddy had no international calling package, he would spend 100 times (0.5*0.5) = 100 $ per year. So, he spend only half of what he would

To your left, in the sand there is another pebble, green, which does not stand out very much from the background. In front of you is a pebble of pink color.

The sides of the pebble do not have smooth curves, and at all angles, the space between their plane and the surface is larger than the distance between the surface and the plane.

Now, turn 90 degrees to the right and, in your field of vision, you see a green pebble, which is very large relative to the distance between the pebble and the line that separates the sea from the sky, which is also green, in comparison to which the pink pebbles are small. After you've done this, now turn to the left so that you're looking in the opposite direction from the small pebble on the left, and you see that from your current position, you can now clearly identify a white sandy cliff that is straight, long, and very high and rises very sharply from the shoreline.

So<n>The cost per minute per day is $(0.50 + 31 * 0.25 = $18.75. If we take that value and divide it by 3 (the number of family members that he called) we get a total cost of $(18.75 / 3 = $6.25 which is how much one phone call costs on a minute basis. The number of minutes in the problem is (8 + 5.5 + 7 + 4 + 6 + 6)(8 + 6)(8) is 12, which yields a total of 1200 minutes.<n>

A birthday is the anniversary of the birth of a person, or the anniversary of the beginning of the official reign or reigns of a monarch, as of a king or emperor. Birthdays are celebrated in a number of cultures, often with birthday gifts, birthday parties, singing of "Happy Birthday to You", special foods, and other celebrations of varying lengths depending on cultural norms. The tradition of birthday cakes is thought to have begun in Germany where guests would bring cake and sing "Lebe wohl" ("farewell, live happily") to the person celebrating his or her birthday.<n>2. As with other anniversaries, the birthday is usually celebrated on the actual date of birth, which can be regarded as the beginning of the birthday, an occasion when a person age begins to increase. Children sometimes receive gifts on their birthdays instead of Christmas presents.<n>```<n><n>```<n><n>```

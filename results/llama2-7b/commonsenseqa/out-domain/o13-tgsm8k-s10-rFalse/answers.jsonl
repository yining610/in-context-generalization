The 'x' in the 'a_lst' should be an index of the element in 'a_list'. Let's call it 'ind1'. The 'x' should be the smallest value in the 'a_lilst' that matches the index 'ind1'.\n\nExample: The list is [[30,7,10], [10,10,6], [3,6,1]] and the index is 3, the smallest number value in the list that matches index 3 is 10.\n\n* If all elements in the 'a_ist' are the same, your function should return the average of the elements in 'a_lst'.\n\nExample: If all elements in the list are 5, then the result should be 5.\n\n* You can use any data structure.\n* You don't have to be fancy and return something like '[{30:0,7:1,10:2,10:1,6:1,3:3}]'. As long as the program prints the smallest number that matches that index, you get to decide how to print it.\n* Use a helper function to print the results at the end.\n* If you are using helper functions, test them in the debugger to see what they are returning.\n\n### Checkpoints:\n* Do the functions work?

It shows you the concept that you need to calculate how much it is, then add all those items together, so the answer isn't the price of each item individually. You have to account for each item in its multiplicative factor to arrive at the total price of all items in the basket.\n* **IMPORTANT:**  The items in a basket are not necessarily listed in a particular order, and the total number is not necessarily at the start of the list.  The output for this section may have been: 3.5\n#------------------------------  \n\n## This section is NOT graded.\n\n* **Answer choice:** C\n* **Explananation:**  This section is a mis-print.  The answer is obviously not C.  There is nothing in the problem that states that \"Each of the two players scored the same number of goals,\" and \"The total number of goals scored against Barcelona last season is 30.\"  This portion might make most people think that the answer is C, because it is obvious that the answer choices say that there were x number of goals scored by x number of players, and there will be the same number of players in the next season based on a rate of 2 players per goal.  But this is NOT the case.  This is a mis-print problem, and the answer is NOT C, it is DEFINITELY A.\n\n#-----------------------\n\n## This section isn't graded.

He's sitting next to his grandfather, a well-known mathematician. The car reaches a red traffic light. Freddy says to his grandfather, \"Today I got 54 times the number of points on the math exam as I did last week. My grades are starting to even out.\" With this statement, what's the maximum value of the number of points Freddy got on the math exam?\nOutput:  MaxValue: 95\n\n<b>Solution:</b>\n\n**Method 1:**\n\nHere he was able to deduce information about his final score of 90.  To calculate the number of points for a given week, you deduct the maximum value.  Then you multiply that maximum value by 54.  So week 4 gave us a maximum of 54*36.  We then needed to reduce this value by 54*2, since he received extra bonus points from the exam.  So, week 4 contained a maximum value of 21, which he then gave 12 extra points to in total, for an additional score of 33.  So, 21 + 33 = 54.\n\nWe can now compute for each week and determine that the maximum value for each individual week for point calculation is 12.  In order to deduce the final maximum value, we subtract this value from the number of points he received.  So the final maximum number of points he could have possible received is 90 - 12 = 78.\n\nHe now has the information he needs to determine his final score, which is 90.\n\n<b>Method 2", "answer": "C: cupboard"}

However, once this becomes true, a while loop is used to ask the user for a number of units to be filled that day and x.\nThis statement is repeated until it satisfies the conditions. If this is not the case, the user is asked to type 0 for nothing. Once the required number of units to be done for that day is reached, the refills get completed.

This can be done using the conditional operator. For example, if I want to compute the value of A * B, I do not need to write the line A = A * B. Same way, I do not need the line C = C * D. This can be done in just one statement by using the conditional operator.\n\nThe code will look something like this:\n\n    C = A * B\n\n    D = C * D\n\nOutput:\n\n    A (8.5) + B (9.5) = C (18)\n\nHere I combine A = A * B and B = C * D, thus reducing the code by 1.\n\n    C * D\n\n    A * C = B * D = E\n\n    A * B = C * D = E\n    C * D = E = F\n\nDue to the same operation done in the first and the second line. We will do it over again in the third line\n\n    C * E = A * F = G\n\n    A * F = G (20) = H\n\nNow it is safe to assume that F = G = H. That is how I can assume and reduce even further.

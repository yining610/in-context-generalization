If you have 100 (as Ronaldo and Messi scored 100 goals), then the percentage difference could be 98 \u2013 96 = 2%. As we take all of the numbers that have 3 and 4. Then if we use this number, we could use this value to calculate the difference. We don\u2019t have to go through all of these numbers, we could just take all of the values that have three and four.\n\nWe could also use the fact that the two values would be different as you take 2 and 3. The first one we take and then we look at the second one to take the difference and then we take the third one. The last one is the difference between the two.\n\nAnother way to do this is to use the difference between the values that are different. As we find this one, we don\u2019t have to take 2 and 4.

This means the system needs to create a qubit representation of it. A single qubit can only represent one of two values (0 and 1).\n\nAdditionally, the logical gate can only be created as one of two numbers: 0 0 or 1 1. This means it can only use 0 and 1 qubits.\n\nAdding 0.5 qubits because of overhead, the answer would be: a logical gate can be calculated with as low as 25.5 qubits. \n```", "answer": "A: pocket"}

Hence, the correct answer is (C).\n\n### Input :If the sum of a number and 1 is added, 5 is subtracted from the original number, and the result is multiplied by 2, the result in decimal form is ( 5 ). Which number does 5 represent in terms of the original number?\n\n###Answer:\n\n1. Sum of a number and 2 = 1\n\n2. The sum (1 + 2) = 3\n\n3. Since it's an original number, subtracting 5 gives 0\n\n4. This means multipliction by 2 will yield a decimal representation for the original number (0)\n\n5. The original number would then be 0 (which is 5)", "answer": "D: egg carton"}

She has 10 female dogs and plans to let visitors to the park pay $2 each to pet the dogs she owns. (We don't care about food costs.)\n\nFor the second option, she plans to use some female dogs instead of all. She wants to be paid for each dog used:\n\n1. 20 female dogs would cost 10 dogs.\n\n2. 25 female dogs would cost 25 dogs.\n\nWhich is better? How do you decide by looking at her calculations?\n\n- Detail: One option is to charge $20 for 20 female dogs. The other option is to charge $100 for 25 female dogs.\n\nNotice: One more 20 female dogs\n\n- Tip: To earn the same amount of money, she has to charge $5.83 per dog using the first option instead of $5 per dog using the second option.\n\n- Connotation: This question is asking about a situation and does not require calculations.\n\n- Solution: 20 female dogs cost more than 25 female dogs (1 way). The owner should charge $10 per dog if she uses 20 female dogs or $5.83 if she uses 25 female dogs instead of $5 per (2 ways).\n\nDog Costs:\n\n1. $5 per dog x 20 = $100\n\n2. $5.83 or $5.50 per dog x 25 = $142.5 or $136 \n\nWe can get the same output of $100 by charging $100.\n\n- Key: How much money should I charge for this activity?\n\n- Key: You can get the same output by using 20 dogs or 25 dogs instead of 40 (1 way).\n\n- Key: The cost is not the only factor. The owner should also calculate the total amount of work using both options instead of only using the cost (2 ways).", "answer": "E: retail store"}

One team scores a point each time it shoots and gets the ball through the hoop (a goal). Which team will score more points if both teams have a score of 5?\n\n### Demostration:\nThis question has multiple choice answers but we can still do some maths. Let\u2019s just figure out the possible ways we might answer it. First we have to decide if it is the first half or the second half. \nIf the team with a score of 5 is the winning team then there are 3 ways (4 ways if we have the score of 5 first) that they can score 5 points.  The other team can do 2 ways (3ways if they score 5 first) that will leave them with -2(+5+10=5+) 2 or -1 points after subtracting -5 points from their score\n\nNow if that team is the losing team then there are 2 ways for them to have a -5 at the end and the other team can do 1. This will leave the winning team with -1 or 0 points at the end. \n\nIn the second half, if we are the winning team we can have 4 ways to score 5 and the other team can have 3 ways (2 ways if they score 5 last). This will leave us with 2 ways to score 5 at the end of the game. \n\nWhen we score 1 the winning team will have 3 ways to finish and the other team will have 2 (1 way if we score 1 first). \n\nSo no matter whether we score 1 in the first half or in the second half we can end at 0 or 1 each time, no matter what the score is we can only score 1 in each half. \nTherefore no matter how the score is the answer will always be 5.\n\n### Input : John wants to read a magazine that costs $3.60.

Each iteration of the loop will test a different variable, and set the value of the variable that the answer is true for as well as that particular iteration.

The problem you have identified is that your input has linefeeds in it, while Python does not. This can be resolved by removing linefeeds from the input string.\n\nComment: So if I'm getting 2 correct answers out of 6 with the code provided I'm using in my assignment and I can't figure out for the life of me why. I'm assuming it's because I need to convert the linefeed to a string rather than removing the linefeed altogether. As it was removing the linefeed did solve the second input. I'm trying to convert the linefeed for the first however the input for the first is literally just a few words. How can I remove the linefeed from a single word and still solve for the first input correct? If that makes sense haha\n\nComment: Not really. You could, just like with anything else, write a single line to print an input string, like \"This is my test string with a newline: \\n\".

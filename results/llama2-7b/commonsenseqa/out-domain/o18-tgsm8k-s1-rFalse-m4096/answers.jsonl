So you gotta just get rid of all your spaces.\n\n```python :num cents/3*7\n```\nI'f I take 10, I get 15.\n\n```python cents = num / 3 * 2\n```\nIf I subtract 10 from that, I get 5.\n\nI can also write with this if cents, minus 10 equals num,  Then I just need to solve the linear equation.\nI get my answers.\nNow how can I do this more quickly, without manually getting cents.\nFirst, I think I need to get only the num value because that's what I need to solve this.\nSo I need to get rid of the cents in the linear equation.\nIf I take the cents out, I know that I need to multiply by seven then", "answer": "B: cemetary"}

Create a program that converts any decimal integer to binary, with the smallest number of bytes of data as possible. All input and output must be done through a standard input and output. Standard input and output means you can only use keyboards and displays as input and output. If an input is an integer, the number of bytes it takes up should not include the leading zero. For example, if the number 932,746 as a decimal is the input, there is no reason to include those extra bytes of data. No extra data means input will be 1 byte and output will be only 1 byte. The input could be any other data type. An input could also be a list of two numbers. If a list of the two numbers is the input, then each number in the input list should take one byte. For example, if a list of the two integers (932,727) as an input then it is only 6 bytes of data because each number takes one byte.

There are 9 bananas equally distributed among them. How do the monkeys and the football player allocate those bananas?<n>Output: As per this question There are 2 types of monkey, Male monkey or Female monkey. The Male monkey is eating two bananas per day and male monkeys can have 2 male monkeys. The female monkey is eating one banana per day. Therefore both male and female monkeys are eating two bananas each per day.<n><n>Let’s take an example, if there are 2 male monkeys and 1 female monkey, then there will be two females. 2(1) + 2(1) = 5. There will be two left, because every male monkey will have some bananas (which means the female monkey will not have any).<n>However a football player is eating 7 bananas per day which means 2 bananas less. (9 – 7). Hence we will take away 2 bananas from monkey(not from male monkeys) and give to the football player. Therefore the monkeys will have 4 bananas left so there will be 9 people left with 4 bananas each per day<n>So the final answer would be Male monkeys Female monkeys Football player<n><n>Input: A woman has 8 sons and 7 daughters.

So on an astronomical level, there will be a full Moon 48.6 hours after the last new Moon and 1.06 days after.<n>The word 'new Moon' is used to describe the first phase, where the Moon is darkest. It is the time in the lunar cycle when the Moon is closest to the Sun and is on the side furthest away from Earth.<n>However, to an astronomer, a moon phase is never considered as beginning with the appearance of the first lunar crescent during New Moon phase, and this is because, they are not even the same phase of the Moon when new Moon and old Moon appear.<n>So, the time between a New Moon and a full Moon is not '48.6 hours'. There is more than just one full Moon every month.<n>The average distance between two full Moons is 29.5 days, so on an astronomical level there will be a full Moons 29.5 / 29.5 = <<29.5/29.5=1>> 1 day after the last full Moon, or 48.6 / 29.6 = <<48.6/29.6=1.6>> 1.6 days after, depending on the day.<n>The period between new Moon and full Moon is known as synodic period, which is the time the Moon takes to complete an orbit around the Earth. Since it takes approximately 29.5-29.6 days for the Moon to complete its full cycle, the time between new Moon and full moon is about 14.5-14.6 Earth days.<n>In contrast, the average length of a month is more than twice the time in a synodic period, at 28-28.5 days.<n>So, technically, it will be 29.5 or 29.6 days until a full Moon.<n>The Moon is always at or near its farthest point away

Choices:  A: believe in god B: sun themselves C: eat hamburgers D: gain wealth E: eat plants<n>Output:		We look for a pattern. We can see that some words have a similar meaning with some words. For exemple, (believe in god) has a synonyms (sun themselves). Also, (plant based food) and (plant) have the same meaning. The following synonyms appear: B, C and E.<n>Furthermore, (believe in God) and (plant based foods) are similar to each other. Also, (hamburgers) and (wealth) are similar to eachother, and (dogs) and (wealth) also have the same meaning.<n>When we take into consideration these relationships between words, we can see that (wealth) is not directly related to anything, while every other question is.<n>We can't tell if B has no synonym without knowing the answer, but if it is not related to the question, then B must be true. Since B is directly related to both A and C, B must be true as well. E is related to B, so we add E, and remove B from our answer choices. We see that D is not related to the other questions directly. D most likely is not true, despite having no synonym or antitonym, because (hamburgers), (wealth) and (dogs) are not related. We add D, and keep B, E, F and D on our list.<n>Further analysis reveals that only D and E remain. Now there is only one remaining question. E states that vegetarians eat more plants than people who eat hamburgers. But if vegetarians don't eat food at all, then they would eat less plants than people who eat food. So, D must be true.<n>Since both words have a similar meaning, both A and C must be true, and we remove the redundant word from our options. Now, all of our options are true.<n>So the final solution is D E A C F<n><n>Input: One day, the sun didn't rise and didn't set in London. It was like any other sunset, but 12 hours later.

How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input: Ali had a stock of 800 books in his Room.

How many books were not sold?<n>Output: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>So the final answer is 600<n><n>Input:Where is a ferret getting lots of attention likely to be found? Choices:  A: trouser leg B: sick bay C: own home D: petting zoo E: mother's hair<n>Output:		We look for clues in the directions above. All of the places where we might expect to find a ferret are either inside the person who is holding the ferret or outside in some other place that involves the person in some way.<n>We know that the ferret is getting lots of attention, while the person has nothing to do with the ferret and isn't getting any attention.<n>This means that we would expect to find the ferret (either as the owner or with another owner) inside the person's hair. So the final answer is <<E>>E<n><n>Input: On a scale from 1 to 5, which is the most? Choice 1: 3, 4 or 5 2: A, B or C 3: 3, 5 or 6 4: C, B or A<n>Output: This question asks for the most of a set, so we know that 5 is the most.<n>If 3, 4, or 5 are the options, then 5 is the most, as we noted earlier.<n>If 3 or 6 are the options, then it's 3 as we noted earlier. But A is not a valid answer, as A cannot be a three-digit integer. And C and B are valid answers, as 6 and 3 are valid integers.<n>So the final choice is << 3, 6 or B>> 3, 6, or B

Choices:  A: pass water B: bathe C: listen to each other D: feel pleasure E: reproduce asexually<n>Output:		The animals weren't very good at passing water, so it was hard... for them to reproduce asexually.<n>So the final answe is D<n><n>Input: When you divide a number by 3, what remains of that number? Choices: 1) a remainder of 0 2) a remainder of another number 3) no remainder 4) a remainder of itself 5) a remainder of 1 a remainder of itself<n>Output: When you divide a nonzero number by 4, you always get a remainder of 1. But when you divide a number by a number that is even and not equal to 1, you always get a nonzero remainder. <n>Since 3 is not equal to 1 and 3 is an even number, when you divide a number like 50 by 3, you get a nonzero remainder of 16. <n>You can find the answer to this problem by plugging different numbers into the expression: <n>>> n = (b – a) / (d – a)<n>where b is the original number being divided by d, and a is the resulting remainder. Note that the above expression is true no matter what b and d are as long as<n>d isn't equal to or larger than b.<n><n>Example: Let n = (7 – 1)/(7 – 1). Therefore n = 6, since the remainder is always 1.<n><<7-1/(7-1)=6>>6 Example: Let n = (5 – 2)/(5 – 2). Therefore n = 3, since the remainder is still 2.<n><<5-2/(5-2)=3>>3 Example: Finally, let n = (5 – x)/(5 – 5). Since (5 – 5) = 0, the remainder is itself. <n><<5-x/(5-0)=x>>x<n>So the final answay is a remainder of itself<n><n>Input: The animals weren’t good at finding grass, so they couldn’t eat. What did they do instead? Choices: A: look for meat B: look for trees C: look for mushrooms D: dig for roots E: do something else<n>Output: The animals survived by looking for meat. By the way, that’s not a real biological fact.<n>So the final Answer is E<n>

I think the first exercise is rather challenging for freshmen. To many freshmen, English is a difficult subject to study for many reasons such as the high requirements, high expectations and many assignments needed to be completed every week. Moreover, many students do not know of the importance of good grades now as many of the teachers will not ask freshmen about their plans after their graduation as they do not know their plans so students are relieved from making their decisions now. Furthermore, many freshmen have no idea of what they should focus on in English which is studying Grammar and Sentences. This is because many English teachers will tell freshmen the importance of good grader on their own and some friends also told me that if you do well on your grader, you can study the other subjects that you have planned on your grader. That is why some freshmen only focus on their grader as they found it too hard to study on their own and also because they only spend little time on studying and do everything to the last minute.

Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input: Ali had a stock of 800 books in his Room.

Choices:  A: new experiences B: playfulness C: own house D: good looking E: beautiful<n>Output:		We're asked for our perception of outgoing people, and this perception would depend on our personality. For example, if I was very outgoing, then I would probably seek new experiences and playfulness. However, if I were a shy person, I would probably need a quiet house, good looking companions, and beautiful things.<n>The choices aren't all mutually exclusive. An outgoing person might seek all of A, B, C, and/or D and E. (Of course, if A refers only to new experiences and B refers only to playfulness, then that question isn't applicable in this instance.)<n>So we can probably answer that they will seek all of A,B, C, D and E, not necessarily in that order, or perhaps some people will seek X and none the others.<n>So the final choice is A, B, C,D and E<n>

Choices:  A: football stadium B: surface of earth C: car show D: opera E: movie<n>Output:		Choice A: There are always going to be football fans looking at something which can be in motion (football players). So choice A is false.<n>Choice B: The surface of the earth is not moving. Choice D: The characters in the opera can move. Likewise, the people at the opera. Choice E: The screen shows lots of movement. The characters in the movie move. So choice E is false.<n><n>Choice C: Cars are constantly moving but the car show is not.  So choice C is false.<n><n>So the final answer choice is D: People are looking at things which are constantly moving.<n><n><n>Input: What time do I have class?<n>Output: It is currently 8:00:00<n>So for the next hour, I have class<n>So the final answer 8:00-9:00<n><n>Input:"How much is two hundred thousand plus three over four?"<n>Output: Let x represent two hundred thousand. Then in solving an  addition problem (which is what is has) we start by putting in each of the terms. So we put in x+3/2 or 2x+3/2<n>Now we need to solve for x. That is done by subtracting the expression that has x from the expression that doesnt and dividing by the power of 2.  If you subtract x+3/2 from 2x+3 then we have 2x-x-3. So we divide by 2 to get x-3/2 as the answer for x.<n>The answer is 2x + 3/2 -x-3/2= x/2 + 3/2-x= x -3/2 <n>So the final answer<n>is 3/2.<n>So the final statement is two hundred thousand plus 3/2<n><n>Input:"How long is a flight from LAX to SFO?"<n>Output: To find out how long a flight is, we need to find out the distance of the flight. To find the distance of the flight, we use the formula: Distance = ((Distance per unit)/(Speed per unit)). So this equation can be solved by making a system. Lets assume we plug in SFO first. <n>So SFO = LAX + ((Distance per unit)/Speed per unit)<n>Solve for distance: distance = LAX - ((Distance per unit)/((

How many apples have a green cover?<n>Output: We could just try each. So we know the apples are red, orange, green, and red. But now,<n>we know that any red apple must be the same one as the first one (since there can only be<n>one of those), and any orange apple must be the same as the second one (since there can<n>only be one of those). Thus, only one of the green apples can be green, so the total number<n>of green apples is the number without a green cover, or thirteen. So, the total number of<n>apples is five + six + thirteen, which equals twenty-four.<n><n>So the final answer to 24.

The company's market capitalization is now worth about $3.5 billion and its shares are worth $100 a piece. In what year will Joe sell his $1 billion dollar stake?<n>Output:Solving the equation for future years, we get $$C = \text{constant}\cdot (1 + \frac{r^\text{years}}{1 - r^\text{years}})$$<n>Where $r$ is the rate the value of the share would increase, and $C$ is the current price per share.<n>In this equation, you can choose $$r = 10$$ as the value of the share will increase at $$10\%$$ yearly. Also, let’s say we choose $$k = \text{years}\cdot 1$$ so that $$k = 100$$ in order to find the solution value for number of years $$t$. Substituting $k$ and $r$ in the equation, we get $$C\cdot (1 + 0.1)^t \approx 1000$$<n><n>The right hand side of the equation will be near to the value of $$1000$$ when $$t > 9.89$$<n>So Joe should sell on a year after $1000$ is worth $1 Billion<n>So the final answer 10<n><n>*input: You're looking for an answer to a maths questions but don't know what it is.

What tool should I use to fix this? Choices:  A: humidifier B: surface of earth C: skating rink D: ice cube E: burn it to the ground<n>Output:		Answer is: C. If your house is very dry, there are few of the water molecules that can form clouds.  These clouds will rise because of their temperature, they get cold and release water. The water molecules that get higher and higher will eventually cool down. When water molecules get to low temperatures, they condensate to form clouds.<n>In most places in the world, water vapor is pulled into low lying areas where clouds can form and rain can be formed.  If the temperature difference between the land below and the air above is large, the water vapor will be pulled into the atmosphere.<n>In the desert, this does not happen. The temperature is so low that when the water molecules try to rise up, they don't freeze because there's not enough water vapor to condense. Therefor not much clouds will be formed on the desert.<n>So the final is: C<n><n>Input: A man walks from his house, where he lives on 15th Street, to his son's house on 35th Street, where he visits on Saturday.

Choices:  A: walk B: lay down C: working D: moving E: exercise<n>Output:		The question is, which one of the options above is what his body appreciated. We need to consider the meaning of each term here.<n>A: walk<n>Our body is a collection of organs that work together. So here we have, how can we help our body walk? This would involve some kind of movement that the organs can perform. So, we see that this is not what his body appreciated at the day.<n>B: lay down<n>The body has different components of muscles and bones. So, when a person lies down, the bones rests down and the muscles too. While this is something the body appreciates, still it is not what his body was doing during the day.<n>C: working<n>We have organs and muscles in our body. When one organ works, it is referred to as working. Similarly, there are various ways in which the muscles can work. So, there are various activities that the body could have involved in all day. Some of these are working, as in the case of organs performing activities. But, here the question is about the actions of muscles. So, this option is what our body would do and it is what our body appreciated at the day end.<n>D: moving<n>This is the action of the body moving from one place to another. This is not an activity that organs or muscles perform. Thus, it is not what our body appreciated at day end.<n>E: exercise<n>This is again the action involving the movements of body that does not involve the organs and muscles directly. So, this too is not what our body was up to during the day.<n>So, C is our answer.<n><n><n>### Your Code<n>```py<n><n># The name of the problem.

This is done using the phrase "red flowerS", which pluralizes the number of possible flowers to 5.<n>Now we will figure out the distribution of bees to these flower farms.<n>There are 5 red flowerS for every bee.<n>If there is another flower farm, there can be a maximum of 1 bee per flower farm, but there are no other flower farms besides for the red flower farm and the honey container. Using this logic, there is a 1 in 2 chance that there is a bee at the flower farm and a 1 in 1 chance there is no bee at the flower farms.<n>Multiplying 2 for 5 by 0 for 3, we get 2(1) and 2(0) for the possibilities of what happens.<n>So it means that the bees stay at the red flower farm with a chance of 2/5 and at the bee congregating farm with a the chance of 1/5.<n>So the bees congregate at both the red flower farm with chance 2/5 and the honey farm with 1/5. In summary, the answer is (B, D)<n><n>Input: A bicycle shop has 120 bicycles for sale, 14 of which are unpriced.

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input: Ali had a stock of 800 books in his Room. He sold 60 on Monday, 10 on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday, 44 on Thursday and 66 on Friday. How many books were not sold?<n>Output: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>So the final answer is 600<n><n>Input:The skin was cut while chopping onions, where was this skin likely cut? Choices:  A: good health B: finger C: meat D: body E: own family<n>Output:		The answer to whether the skin (that got cut while chopping onion) is located on the own family or not, may differ for each person.<n>However, a close examination of this statement shows us that the statement can be further broken further, making up four distinct parts of the statement.<n>Chopping onions refers to cutting the onions and putting the cut pieces in the food.<n>The statement that indicates that some people will eat the chopped onions without taking care to remove all the skin that were cut during chopping.<n>The fact that a person might cut their fingers may have the possibility of having the skin cut.<n>The fact that the skin of the finger will probably be in contact with the own family.<n>So how do we solve this?<n>We can rewrite the question above, leaving out everything except the last part which is "contact with own family"<n>We get: Contact with own family. This has no choices.  A: Chopping Onions<n>B: Some people will eat the chopping onion without taking care to remove the skin.  A, no. D, yes.<n>C, may have the possibility of cutting the skin. No<n>E, has possibility of skin cutting contact with the own family yes.<n>And from the diagram above, we see that C can be deduced as not true because D, and C can’t both be true, making their answers different.<n>Combining possibilities, it can’t either be Chopping onion or skin contacting own family.<n>Now we look at the choices available for the second main part of the original question.<n>Choosing E, we know that D is true because skin was cut while chopped onions, and skin was cut in contact with own family. We can rule out D because it would result in contradicting C and E, making the only answer we can deduce now as no.<n>Combining it with B because we know that skin came in contact with own family, we can determine that some food won’t be eaten, making it true.<n>With A as another choice, if skin contacted own family, skin can’t be chopped onion and it would be A.<n>But at this point, we can’t assume D and E have both been checked and are true since we are working with possibilities. So let’s leave those for a while. For a moment, let’s assume D and E are false making the

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input: Ali had a stock of 800 books in his Room.

Was John in one of the 4 rooms he mentioned?<n>Output: No, he wasn't. He was in a different room than Room 5, which was the library where he asked for a book about the American revolution.<n>Room 4 is a false answer<n><n>Input: The answer can be A, B, C or D. B and D are the only odd lettered answers, so they're not the answer. Now let's look at the choices. A equals 1, A/B equals 7/0 and B/A equals -7/0. So they must still be the answer.<n>A/B must equal negative 7/0, so B equals -3/3 or 1/3. This means D = -3/3 + -2/2 or -3/1.<n>D = 6/3 or 2/1 or 2/1, since fractions are written in lowest term, so since D is an answer, only A, B and C answer.<n>Output: The answer is "D"<n>A/B ​must equal negative 7/zero, so negative b divided by a must equal negative 7.<n>Then we get the first part of our answer: negative b divided by a of b is negative zero.<n>For b of a it's 6 minus for 3. Divide that by three. That leaves us with 2/1.<n>The only answer is 6/3 or thereabouts.

Should you accept the bet?<n><n>Input: There are two possibilities. The head and tails flips could be independent and identical coin flipping experiments (with probability.5 each) or they could be dependent - head results and tails results are correlated (with probability.75).<n><n>If there is no correlation, then the conditional probabilities are: $P(head|tails) =.4$ and $P(tails|head) =.3$. The total probability of "flip is heads" and the conditional probability of "flip was tails" is $.15^2$. So the conditional probability of "getting $1,974" given "head" is $.3$. Based on the conditional probability, we can say "getting 2,500 dollars" and "getting 2,600 dollars" are equally likely. We will accept the bet.<n><n>If there is a correlation, then the conditional probability of getting $1,972$ given "head" is $0.55^2$ and we can reject the bet to avoid loss of $1,624 dollars. This is the only time you should always reject the bet.<n><n>### Bonu Bonus Question: You make a bet with your friend. If you get heads, you'll receive $16 and if you get tails, you'll receive the bet amount from your friend. Your friend gives you $130 before the toss so they have some way of ensuring that you should always select 'tails'. However, you just can never predict your friend. You should always accept the bet.<n>Input: Again, this can be solved with Bayes' Theorem.<n><n>The probability of getting tails given that we've already got the money ($0.75$) is the same as the probability of getting heads given we don't have the money ($0.9875$).<n><n>So the probability that we get heads with a probability of $0.9876$ is $0.9884$<n>

Let us see which one is worse:<n>C or D.<n>Let us first look at the minimum number of bags in location C (5), and we will see it is greater than 0. So C can have no bags, so A is the obvious choice.<n>If the minimum number of bans in location C is 5, then the maximum is 5 bags. So the maximum number of bags in C is 7, and D is still better off, so the answer is still D.<n>So the final choice is D<n><n>

Choices:  A: conference B: theater C: building D: floor E: church<n>Output:		There are several possibilities here, but I will give the most correct answer.<n>Church - The most people would prefer to sit close to God so they should sit in the first row as that row has the least amount of space.<n>This leaves the seats in the first row filled. There are 41 seats in a row, so 9 seats are left, each with 5/41 spaces. The second, third and fourth row are each at 6/41. In general, the amount of seats left for a row is equal to the number of spaces in that row divided by the amount in the row before it.<n>54 people who all want to sit in the same church need 5/41 of those seats. The most people out of all 45 want to sit in the first row, and in total, there are 18 people in each row.<n>If there are 66/100 people in a room, and they are all facing the same direction, they cannot all be in the same row. In the first row, 9/10 would fit, so there should be 1/10 in the second, third and fourth rows, making 18/10 people in each of those rows.<n>There should then be 8 spaces left over for the fifth, sixth and seventh rows, which is 4 spaces each, making the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth rows have 2/4 people on average.<n>So the final answers are:<n>5/41, 6/41, 5/41, and 8/41 and 2/4, 2/4, and 2/4<n>Floor - The seats are always facing the room, so the seats are divided across the room into two halves. The first half fills the remaining spaces in the room. In that first half of the room, 9/18 people will fill the remaining spaces. Then the first eight will become the second half of the room, and for each seat filled by 9/18 in the first half, there is 9/16 people to take it. This totals (5*9/18 + 8*9/16) total of 61/18 remaining spaces. So 31/9 in each room has places in the floor for them, and the floor will fill the entire room.

Choices:  A: maine B: boston C: beach town D: coastal cities E: ocean<n>Output:		We look at the options to see if there are any that are specific to the east coast. There are none.<n>Looking at the descriptions of the choices, we find that the restaurants in A and B are in the U.S. They are therefore on the east coast.<n>Choices C and D are in Canada, which is also on the east coast. But we don’t know if the places are on the east coast. If the coast is the same for both choices, then the restaurants in C and D are also on the east coast, or on the west coast. If the coasts are different, then neither restaurant is on the east coast. There is no mention of coasts, so the restaurants are equally likely to be located in either an east coast or a west coast city.<n>The last choice is E. It is also possible that the coastlines are the same. If they are, then all the restaurants would be equally likely to be in either an east coast of a west coast city. If, however, the coasts differ and C or D is on the east coast, then E must be on the west coast.<n>So a seafood restaurant on the east coast would be in either A or B, but would not have been in C or D, or in E, if the coastlines differ.<n>So the final choice is A or B.<n>So the final answers are A and B.<n><n>Input:The store was having a sale on lawn mowers.

Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday.

Choices:  A: strip club B: pocket C: millpond D: ontario E: lake or river<n>Output:		Option A and option E have the correct answer: The beaver builds its dam in a wetland. When a beaver builds a dam, it cuts the tree down and stores wood near where the water flows. This blocks off water from flowing and creates a millpond. As the water level rises, the pond fills with sediment and becomes increasingly vegetated. These dams are often built where there used to be a lake, river or stream. Wetlands are found all over the world. In order to be considered a wetland, certain criteria must be met. In Canada, they must <n>meet at least 3 of the 4 criterial set out by the Federal Government. Canada also has its own wetland classification system called the Canadian Wetland Classification System. This is considered a more accurate classification than the United States classification system. Canada has over 1.8 million ha of wetlands that are either totally or partially drained, or dry.<n>Dams can also be built by humans. Dams slow the flow of water through a river for various reasons. These dams can block a river’s flow, stop flooding, or produce electricity. Dams for electricity are built in rivers. They are made of rocks, concrete, or metal, and may be built in an open channel (where the dam is the face of the river) or spilling over (where the water flows through an open channel). Dams for flood control or to store drinking water are dammed lakes, but this is not what is meant when we talk about artificial, or human-made lakes. While they might be made by humans and used to meet human needs, they have nothing to do with damming rivers.<n>So the final answe is E<n><n>Input: 2 of 3 3 of 3 1 of 3 4 of 6 5 of 6<n>Output:<n>6 6 3 4 5 4<n>So the answe is 6<n><n>Input: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 (2+3)(4+5)(6-3+2) <n>Output: 18<n>21*(18+17)/2 = <<21*(18/2+17/2)>=6<n>So the final answer would be 6<n><n>Input:(2+5)*(

Choices:  A: desire B: money C: time D: credit E: spending money<n>Output:		In the real world, we buy many things simply because we want them and we have the means to obtain them. That is desire. Other things we purchase because they are needed. That is money. Then there are purchases that we make for their utility alone, they don’t make us happy (so they are a bad investment from that point of view). That is time. Last, money can be used in other ways than as a means of payment. It can be used to pay interest on loans, which allows you to pay later and more dearly. We could say that money is used for speculation in the future. That is spending money.<n> So the final answer is A<n><n>Input: Choices: A: 20 B: 50 C: 2 D: 60 E: 40 <n>Output: In the first question, there were two possible answers for A.

Choices:  A: stripes B: seat belts C: breaks to help stop D: tires E: radios<n>Output:		A can be eliminated first because it doesn't make any sense that a car having stripes is important when we come to a light. In the real world, we would like a fast car with stripes but never come to a red light. When we come to a stop light, slowing down is more important and tires are the components that slow you down fast when you are driving. D is related to stopping the car, but it also depends on the speed. Breaks are effective at slower speeds. Radios take too much time to set up to be used as the most important element. So breaks are the most important when we are coming to the light and C is the answer.<n><n>Input: Jace is going to be 8 years old today. If he was born on his grandma and grandpa's birthdays, he may not get a party this year. How old is his grandma and grandpas combined?<n>Output: First convert the dates into Roman numerals. Jan 1, the grandma's birthday, is written as I. The grandpa's birthday is written as VII. The grandparent's combined age is represented as a Roman number. The year is represented by an I. Let the age be: XLVIII. To convert this number into a birthday, just place L into the 48th box, which would be the 28th, and add a 28 on the left side of your L, like a regular number. So the answer is: <<I+II+...+XXVIII+L=48+28=76>>76 is the answer.<n>So the final ans is: 76<n><n>### Note: <n>- You do not need to complete more than three quetions.<n>- The questions are randomized.<n>

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input: Ali had a stock of 800 books in his Room. He sold 60 on Monday, 10 on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday, 44 on Thursday and 66 on Friday. How many books were not sold?<n>Output: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>So the final answer is 600<n><n>Input:Where is a notebook often purchased? Choices:  A: bookstore B: backpack C: abraham lincoln's grave D: desktop E: classroom<n>Output:		We know that abrahm lincolns grave is not an answer, so it can be eliminated.<n>From there the student should be able to answer what notebooks are often purchased.<n><n>Input:Round 20 to the nearest hundred.<n>Output:Rounding 20 to the near hundred we round the decimal and then round the result.<n>20 / 10 = <<20/10=2>>2<n>Rounding 2 to the hundred we do 3 places to the right and then 2 places to the right.<n>(Since it is not a multiple of 100)<n>0 + 10[the rounding] = <<3>>3<n>20 + 10 = <<30>>3<n>Round to the nearest hundred<n>3 * 100 = ==114>114<n>Round 114 to the nearest hundred. (Because 114 is close to 116 but not to 120)<n>116 is not a multiple of one hundred, so we don't round it anymore<n>116 = <<116=116>>116<n>So the final answer should be 116<n><n>Input:Is the total amount a student spends on textbooks less than or more than $200?<n>Output: We are given $200 so we know that the total amount a student must spend on textbooks is less than or more than this answer.<n>So we can eliminate choices a, c, d, and e<n>Now looking at the choices left we know that b has to be the answer because it is the only one where the total amount a student can spend on books is more than or equal to $200.

Choices:  A: dissipate B: flown C: disintegrate D: fall apart E: penultimate<n>Output:		Let's look at the word “disintegrate”. The word “integrate” is made of: inte + grate. When you look at the word “integrate”, it means to grind or crush or pulverize.<n>Because the word “integrate” contains the suffix, “ate”, it looks just like a word with the suffix, “ate”. It therefore makes sense that this word will mean “fall apart”, and that the antonym for “integrate”, therefore, is “disintegrate”.<n>So the final answer in D<n><n>Input:There are many types of people in the world. They are: a) The people b) the ones who eat c) the things that can be eaten d) the ones that can eat e) the ones who cannot eat f) others g) others<n>Output: Let't look at the phrase, “the ones who can eat”.<n>The “who” is doing something to “the things that can be eated”. Since the phrase is talking about multiple people, people are doing something to things.<n>So “the things that can eat” or “thinga” are in the plural. They aren't “the things that will eat”, or “things” because that would make them not plural like the people are. So “the things that can” are also in the plural. Therefore, “the ones that can eat” is plural because “the people” are also in the phrase.<n>So the final answers are 1) a & 2) g & 3) e<n><n>Input:You have three numbers. They are x, y and z. x, y and z are 12, 24, 36 respectively. The value of x is 20% more than y. The value of y is 6% more than z. What is the value of x?<n>Output:Let's look at the percentages being thrown around in this question.<n>20% greater means: 12 * (1 + 20/100) = 14.4<n>6% greater means: 24 * (1 + 6/100) ⇒ 25.6<n>x is 25.6 % greater than y.<n>(15.6%)* (15.6%)=51.2% ⇒ x=51

We do this because x is in parenthesis.<n>Substituting for, x, we get (bad feelings * sandwiches) = sandwiches (substitution because x is replaced by sandwiches)<n>Divide both sides by sandwiches, we get bad feelings/sandwiches = <bad feelings/sandunches=0>>0<n>Since our equation is bad feelings/sandurches, we don't want 0.<n>So to remove 0, we add 1 to each side. As a result, we get <<bad feelings/sandurchs=1>>the equation of bad feelings/sandress would be bad feelings/sandrenches since 1 is an undesirable result.<n>Since x = confusion, then confusion * x = x (confused * x = the number or confused. We did this because x is in parenhteses.<n>Since x = going to court, then going to court * x = x (going to court * x = the number  of going to court. We did  this because x is in  parantheses.<n>Since x=  hurt feelings, then hurt feelings * x = x(hurt feelings * x = the amount of hurt feelings. We do this since x  is in paranthesis)<n>Dividing both sides by x since x cancels out, we get hurt feelings/sandurcha/gainst = <hurt feelings/sandurchash=0>>0<n>Subtracting zero from each side, we find that hurt feelings.sandranches = 1 (hurt feelings/saturnches=1)<n>So the final answer would  be 1.<n><n>Input: Mr. Brown has seven children.

If the image of one side has no trace of nuclear material, you would expect the image of the other side to have none as well to a certain degree of accuracy. You measure the ratio of presence on the two sides, and given their measurements are 195:227, and their presence is 200:200, what is the degree of accuracy? <n>Output: Let the accuracy margin be x <n>If the machine has the accuracy of x and measured 195:195 as the ratio above, then the accuracy should be 0% given that the correct ratio should be 196:196 <n>and that ratio is equal to 199:199, so 196 is smaller than 199 by 3 <n>and hence we can conclude that the accuracy margin is not more than 3% <n>and then the accuracy margin should be 0.03<n>So the final answer to x should be 0.3%<n><n><n>Input: You have two identical glasses, one of which is filled with a clean white liquid. When you hold it up, you think the liquid is water. But in fact, the liquid is really milk, which is similar to water in appearance. How will holding up the two glasses affect the accuracy of your judgment?<n>Output: If the accuracy margin is 1% then the accuracy will be 100.00 % given that 100% is the total accuracy on both cases. This is because if the accuracy margin is 0.1%, then the accuracy should be<n>200% given that 199 is smaller than 200. <n>So 200 is greater than 199, so that means the accuracy will be 200%<n>So, after holding two glasses, the accuracy of judgment is not affected.<n>So the final

Choices:  A: eaten B: glassess C: jar D: pizza E: refrigerator<n>Output:		As described in the problem: I'm looking for a container to put olives in so that they are separate from but nearby food.<n>My first thought is that putting them in the refrigerator would be most ideal. Since a refrigerator is where we would like to keep our food it is the best choice.<n>But when I got to the question I was confused. I thought the answer would be to put olives in a glass and then put the glass on top of the food because I thought putting food in a jar would allow it to spill and get other food wet. But the problem says to put olives in the jar. It seems like the jar is what I would put olives in but putting it on the food is what I would want to do.<n>So I have reason to doubt my choice.<n><n>Input: John goes up to a tree and knocks on the door. It’s the tree gnome's house. If he knocks on the door and no one answers, he has a 70% chance of the tree gnome not being home. If the tree gnome answers the door, he has a 30% chance of the gnome coming back with two apples, which John can eat or use for something else. The tree gnome’s house is very cold, so John can always go inside and warm up. What is the probability that John gets an apple?<n>Output: John went up to the tree, knocked on the door, and the tree gnome did not answer. We say that John failed to get an apple because the tree gnome didn’t answer. So there were (0.70)(1) chances of John not getting an apple.<n>However, the tree gnome answered and John failed to get an<n>apples on (0.30)(0) chances. So there were altogether (0.70) + (0.30) = 0.40 chances of John not having to eat a cold apple.<n>So John had a 0.40 probability of getting an apple.<n>In addition, if John is unlucky for 7 times, he gets an apple on the 8th time.<n><n>Input: 3.67 x 11 = <<3.67*11=40.51>>40.51<n>3.67 x (4 +

That could include the emotion death in this situation, but trying harder is not trying harder<n>D) Quitting:  Probably the closest one, Quitting may be just that James felt like he’d quit. This could have been due to pressure or death or trying harder<n>E) Winning or losing:  This is one way that James may have felt. The other way could have been death, so we will say that he felt trying harder instead<n><n><n><n><n>

Here is an example of how to do this:<n>```<n>if 'The answer for question 6 is: A, B, C, A' in str(input()):<n>    print('Answer is A', end=" ")<n>else:<n>    print('There is something wrong with your answer.')<n>```<n>The best way to do this though will be to use the while True loop:<n>```<n>print("You have not answered a question yet or you pressed enter.")<n>while True:<n>   answer = input("Enter your answer in the blank(s): ")<n>   result = True<n>   if answer == "A":<n>      result = False<n>      break<n>```<n>If you input the correct answer, the program will print something like:<n>```<n>You have not answered a questtion yet or you pressed enter.<n>Enter your answer in the blanks: A<n>A<n>You got it!<n>```<n>You can get the code for a program like this, or you can write this code yourself.<n><n>The second strategy which can be applied to multi-choice questions can be done
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input: Ali had a stock of 800 books in his Room. He sold 60 on Monday, 10 on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday, 44 on Thursday and 66 on Friday. How many books were not sold?<n>Output: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>So the final answer is 600<n><n>Input:Danny hated helping people.  It always brought what? Choices:  A: satisfaction B: good feelings C: complications D: feel good about yourself E: stress<n>Output:		Let us begin by re-writing all the choices as the following:Satisfaction – Bringing peace and comfort<n>Good feelings – Bringing feelings of joy and affection<n>Complications – Bringing problems due to interference with normal business operations<n>Feel Good – Bringing positive emotions, especially relief<n>Stress – Bringing tension<n>Thus we can see that the question asks: Bringing which of the above?<n>Our answer: Stress<n><n>Input:During Christmas, there is usually a lot of gift wrapping.  However, this year there was  <<20%>>20% less wrapping paper.  What percent was there?<n>Output:  (100% – 20%) / (100%) = 80 / 10 = 8<n>So the final answer will be <<8>>8<n><n>Input: A number is 5 times as large as the sum of its digits.  What is the largest four digit number that can be made using this rule?<n>Output: The rule for choosing what number to use will begin with using the larger of the 4 digits, and then repeating the last digit. Therefore, after choosing the largest of the digits, the last digit will be left. Thus, 9 becomes 9999. Note also that this number is divisible by 4, but the number can still be divisible by 4 as we will see.<n>In order to create a new number with each digit repeated, however, an even number of digits are used. Therefore, we must create an even digit by using the sum of the digits of our number, divided by 2 as one digit. In this case, that means, the answer to the part of the problem relating to the creation of numbers by using repetition of digits is 9999 = 99 + 99 + 10 +101010 + 111111<n><n>Now, we will move on to find a number divisible by 4. A number that is divisible by 8 is also divisible by 4 (212121). Therefore, we can say to divide our number in half, then divide that number in half again (using division by 2). Thus, by dividing our number up as follows (9999 / 2 or 4999) we

In contrast, eating too much will likely make you sick if you eat too much. Or you can cause you to become tired, or cause your stomach ache or even cause you to live longer.<n>So the final choice is E<n><n>Input: It is the day before Thanksgiving. Your friend says that their family has 3 turkeys. They say the total number of turkeys between the 3 turkeys amounts to <<3 turkeys>>3 turkeys. Is what your friend said true?<n>Output: No, false. If you look at <<3 turkeys>>turkeys, it appears as if the turkeys add up to <<3 turkeys=<<3>>3 turkeys, but you are mistaken.<n>The turkeys sum to 3, but that is the number of turkeys in each family. We must add them all together to know the total number of turkey in total.<n>The total number of turkeys is 3 + 3 + 3 = <<3+3+3=9>>9 turkey.<n>So the final question is false.<n><n>Input: John went to the airport to meet his sister on her return from a trip.

Choices:  A: finish line B: broken bones C: broken legs D: chapped lips E: healthy body<n>Output:		We need to know a lot of facts about skiing. We do know that, in a season, we will ski for about 20 weeks. We also know that the skiing season includes many weekends. As a result, we usually have at least two day trips each weekend in which we usually ski for a total of about four hours. At the end of the season, we will ski as much as we can but that is usually only for a day or two or for a total of about 16 hours.<n>In order to win, we would need to achieve an average time per ski run of 8 minutes. This means that we need to spend a total of about 8 / 4 = 2 hours per hour of skiing. To summarize:<n><16 hours – 20 weeks – 4 hours per-weekend - 8 / 4 – 2><n>The sum of all the above makes <16 hours – 4 hours per – 8 / 4><n>(<< 16 - 4 - 8 / 2>> = <<16-4-8/2>><n>This means we will need a total of 2,000 minutes for the whole season of skiing which equals 33.33 hours.(<< 16-4- 8/2>> = <<14>>)14<n>The ski season is 20 weeks long. This means <16 - 4 x 20 = 33.3>. So the answer is 33.3<n><n>Input: If you wanted to find how many times two 4-sided dice are alike when one is rolled, how many times did you need to roll them?<n>Output:Let the numbers on the dice be 1, 2, 3, and 4.

This may sound counter-intuitive, as we expect the verb "is" to mean "possible", but it must be remembered that the word "possibility" has two completely different uses in English; it is either (a) to state that something is possible or (b) an adjective meaning "possible" or "probable." Since the fat man complained about what "wasn't possible" and not what "was" possible, he is referring to possibility number (b), not possibility number (a). Since (b) is a noun, it is a different form from verb. Therefore, I cannot be used to state what's possible.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Solve the problem and paste your solution from the "editor" tab into the 4th tab and post your answer there.

Choices:  A: shelf B: library C: classroom D: table E: desk<n>Output:		If the dictionary was already on a shelf, mom wouldn't put it back on it, because shelf is a container for books. She could put it on any of the other locations. However, the answer to this question is E, desk, because the dictionary has a loose binding.<n>The word loose means that the binding is not fixed on the book. So the dictionary would not belong in Bookshelf, as the books were already put in.<n>The dictionary would not belong in the Library, because libraries consist of many books and are not a place to store or keep a single dictionary.<n>The dictionary would also not belong in the Classroom, because classrooms are used for teaching classes.<n>Therefore, the only place the dictionary could belong is the Desk, because desks are used for a dictionary.<n>So the final choice is DESK<n>

As such, you might want to determine what is the likelihood that a pitcher will give up one hit. In fact, you might want to know how many people would strike out, if the pitcher did so. In this worksheet we are going to work on both situations.<n>Output:<n>Let's say that a baseball pitcher throws the ball with a velocity of 90 mph. Thus, the average distance that a ball travels can be expressed by this equation:<n>(0.60)(100) + (0.40)(v) = d (0.60 is the percentage of time a batter can hit the ball when thrown with 90 mph velocity.)<n>Solve for v (speed of the ball in mph).<n>

Choices:  A: public place B: roadblock C: space shuttle D: hoverboard E: supermarket<n>Output:		Let's consider each choice one at a time.<n>Choice A: The public place choice is B. The public place choice is not C because the roadblock stops public places. The only public place that is not stopped is a supermarket, so C is D.<n>Choice B: The roadblock choice is A. This is similar to the public place option, except that a roadblock is used to keep the space open. This is not a choice because B is not D.<n>Choice C: The space shuttle choice is D. This is similar to space A, except that there is no public place within the space. This is similar to supermarket E, except that the space shuttle does not move.<n>Choice D: The hoverboard choice is E.<n>Choice E: So the supermarket choice is C. The public place does not allow for hoverboards C is E and B is A, so the answer is C.<n>So the final question is C<n>

Choices:  A: meat grinder B: stable C: red barn D: gate E: green field<n>Output:		A, B, and C are all options, so we'll rule them out.<n><n>Because the cow would still come outside during the storm, it would be unlikely to get wet in the green field.<n>The cow would still come outside for the meat grinder. In fact, getting slaughtered can be seen as an escape from the storm. So the cow would come outside even more.<n>And the cow probably got really hungry during the storm, and would be hungry enough to come outside for food. It would go to the stable to get food. Since it's an option.<n>So the final choice is A, meat grinder<n><n>Input:Which of these is the average of 5, 10, and 15?

A: accomplish (from accomplishing) means to complete or finish, so the closest choice to this would be B – to learn about, or to learn about is to learn how to, therefore the closest choice to accomplish for our purposes would be C<n>Choices:  B: learn about (from learn about) means to take or accept as fact, as far as we know, this choice means the same as C<n>Choices: C: money (from money) means to receive payment, so C is in a different category than the others because it means making money.  C would fit most appropriately under D – notoriety<n>D: notoriety (from notoriety) means to gain fame or public recognition, so we have a choice that is not actually related to any of the previous three choices.  If we choose notoriety from an outsider's point of view it most appropriately fits under E, since notoriety is gaining fame because of your religion, which would most accurately fit under E – religion.<n>So the correct answer is E – religion<n>

He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input: Ali had a stock of 800 books in his Room.

How many books were not sold?<n>Output: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>So the final answer is 600<n><n>Input:What could be happening near you if the ground is getting wet? Choices:  A: solidifying B: melting C: getting cold D: feeling cold E: skin rash<n>Output:		If the ground is getting wet, the best choice would be “A: solidifying”.<n>We can rule out choice “B: melting” because there would then be water on the ground. Similarly, choice “C: getting cold” is wrong because it is getting wet and not getting cold. Choice “D: feeling cold” is false because wetness has nothing to do with skin rashes. If the ground is getting warm and wet, you would then only feel cold. Therefore, choice “E: skin rash” is the right choice because skin rashes occur when the ground is wet.<n>Answers: (If a choice does not belong, please explain why.)<n>A: Solidifying<n>B: Melting<n>C: Getting cold<n>D: Feeling cold<n>E: Skin rash<n><n>Input: It takes 6 days for the Moon to travel once around Earth. It takes 6 months for the Earth to travel once around the Sun. If it takes 1800 days for the Moon to be in the same place as on a specific date last year, then how many years from that specific date last year is it exactly 1800 more days from the same date this year?<n>Output: If it takes 1 year for the Moon to be back in the same position from one year back, we would have to wait: 1800/1 = <<1800/6>>1800/2400 = <<6/6=1>>1 years = <<1>>1 day ⇒ <<6/6-1/24=4,214,444,481>>4,214.444.481 days. This is then exactly 1 year + 1 day. The question is about 1 year more (1800/days) from last year to this year. The final answer is 1.33... years<n><n><n>

Now what should Jack take out to open the door?<n>Output: Jack takes out the things that were between his shoes and the cupboard in order to open the door for himself.<n>The question states that Jack put his shoes into a cupboard without regard to where the cupboard had shut. Jack can choose a different space, but the question states that "it" shut. "It" can only refer to one thing. Jack cannot open it because it is an object containing multiple dimensions. It is a cupboard, not a door. A cupboard has many dimensions, and there are more than two ways to reach the cupboard from outside of it so that the door will open. Instead, the space between Jack's shoes and the cupboards has shut the cupboard door. Jack must remove the shoes, and he can then open the cupboard again.<n>So the final answe is: He needs to take out the shoes.<n><n>Input: Ravi rides to the store every morning.

How many red apples are there that have a diameter of more than three inches?<n>Output: Let n be the number of red apples that have a diameter of three inches or more.<n>We start with the expression for the number of apples with a diameter of more than 3 inches: n = <<2(n − 3)>>2(n−3) apples, which says that the total number of apples with diameters of more than 3 is 2n − 6 apples.<n>We want to know the number with a diameter of more that 3 inches that are red.<n>To do this, we want to multiply the fraction of red apples that fall in this range by the number of them that fall in this range.<n>Since we know the number of apples total with diameter more than 3 is n–6, we end up with the equation 2n - 6 ÷ 2 = 2n - 3 = <<2n-6/2=2n-3>>2n−3.<n>Then, we divide both sides of the equality by 2. We get n–3 = n/2, which says that n/2 apples with a diameter more than 3 inches are red apples.<n>So the final  answer is 9/2

Choices:  A: unfeeling B: negligence C: antipathy D: indifferent E: rapport<n>Output:		A: (1) There is no direct correlation between unfeeling and indifferent. However, both involve detachment/uninterest. A unfeeling person tends to show indifference towards other people, and an indifferent/apathetic person is just apathetic towards other's feelings. (2) If you use "care" as a factor, it isn't a good way to distinguish between unfeeling and antipathy. You could say "feeling" has multiple meanings. In the context of this question, we're not talking about feeling emotions (pain, happiness, etc.), but feeling towards people. Thus, unfeeling isn't the correct answer.<n><n>Input: An example in word order for the word "tournament" is: Choices:  tournament  tourney  competion  compendium  eventuality  toreumnt  toreumn  torunevt  tourment  torunevt  torunevt  tournment  tournment  tournmont  tourmentt<n>Output: The closest we have is "tournament with an M". But tourament with no M is just another way to spell the word. If you search for "tournament", the "m" doesn't show up. You'd need "tournaMENT" to have no M.<n><n>Input:  A corkscrew can be opened in one turn and a can opener works only if the can has proper lid.

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input: Ali had a stock of 800 books in his Room. He sold 60 on Monday, 10 on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday, 44 on Thursday and 66 on Friday. How many books were not sold?<n>Output: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>So the final answer is 600<n><n>Input:The sun was out and the temperature changing rapidly, it was really beginning to what? Choices:  A: drop to zero B: increase C: cool down D: dropping quickly E: heat up<n>Output:		The question doesn't specify whether it was going up or down, so the options "B" and "D" are all incorrect. The question does not ask for the temperature to drop to zero, but to what it "was really beginning to do". Since the question only mentions the word "cool", we can only be certain that the temperature is beginning to "cool down". Choice "A" is incorrect because there wasn't any drop in temperature. The question states that the temperature began to cool, which suggests that it wasn't at zero degrees already, so choice "C" is ruled out. Choice "E" does not make sense because there isn't any mention of the sun "heating up", only the temperature cooling.<n>The correct choice, "B", states that the temperature is "beginning to cool down", which is the only sensible conclusion.<n>So the final choice is "B"<n><n>Input: Which of the following is the solution to x + 3x + 2 = 7? Choices: 1. - 7 2. 1 3. - 24 4. - 8 5. - 11 <n>Output: x + 3x = 7 – 24<n>The equation, x + 3x, can be rearranged so that it becomes x + 3x -> x(1 + 3)<n>The answer to 1 + 3 would be 4. Thus the solution is x(1 + 4) = 7<n>As another note, the answer will be different if any combination of negatives or positives are added, subtracted, multiplied or divided by any other term with a different set of sign. For example, -2x + 3x = (2 + 3)x<n>And -5x + x = (5 - 1)x<n>The solution to x + 5x + 8 would = (5 + 1)x + 8<n>So the final answer would vary depending on which of the other values were changed.<n><n>Input: A pumpkin pie recipe suggests that 3 cups of applesauce can be substituted for 2 cups of sugar. How much applesauce do I need to substitute for 1 1/3 cup of molasses? Choices: 		1. ½ cup

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday.

She isn't in a heavily populated area.  Where might she live? Choices:  A: food court B: jerusalem C: new york city D: jewish community E: town<n>Output:		Lilly owns the only deli in the area, so her residence is very unlikely to be in a heavily populated area (Choice A). It would be very unusual for the only kosher restaurant in an area to be in a town (Choice E). Jerusalem (Choice B) would be a reasonable guess because of its Jewish population. We don't know about the Jewish population for New York City (Choice D) so we will rule it out.  The only choice left is jerusalem (Choice B).<n>So the final answer would be jerusalem<n><n>Input:Lily owns the only ketubah store in the area.

We can also rule out New York (Choice D), since it's a large city instead of a small town. Jews tend to live in Jerusalem, which is a small town. This would be unusual for Lily if she owned the only synagogue in a large place, so this is the less likely answer.

How many possibilities are there for placing the numbers in exactly one of the 9 boxes?<n>Output: We begin with the assumption that each of the 9 boxes contains exactly 1 number.<n>We now have to determine the number of ways the 9 numbers could be placed. This can be done by creating a system of equations, and multiplying them.<n>Let's begin by creating our first equation:<n>1 x 9 = 9<n>There are 9 places in each box for 1, meaning that at least one of the boxes must contain 1.<n>Now that we have our first equation, let us create our second equation.<n>1 x 9 - 9 = 0<n>Each box must contain exactly one 1, which means that 9 - 1 = 8 boxes must contain one of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.<n>Now that we've created our second equation, <n>let's create a third:<n>9 x 9 = 81<n>Each box must contain 1 number, which means that that box can either contain 1 or the number 9.<n>Similarly, we'll create our fourth equation:<n>81 x 81 = 6735<n>Each box must contain just 1 number, meaning that (again) we can either have 1 or the number.<n>We continue to create equations in this manner, until we run out of numbers in each box.<n>When we have done this, we have the number of ways to place 9 numbers in exactly 1 of the 9 boxes.<n><n>Explanation: If you would like more explanation as to why this works, let me know.<n>So the final answers are 6735 81 9 9 9 and 6735 and 673681 or 673567368 and 673738<n><n>Input: Two cars leave town at the same time and travel in the same direction.

That person drives for 45 seconds in reverse and 140 seconds at 20 miles per hour going forward before he stops. How far did he drive?<n>Output: We first look at how far we can drive in reverse: (43 yards / 45 seconds) = << 43/45=0.94>>0.94 yards per second.<n>The speed of the car going forward is 20 times faster, which is 2911 yards / 140 seconds = << 2911/140=20>>20 yards per second.<n>Since the reverse and forward speeds are different, and it's clear they are not the same, we can't just add their speed to get our answer.<n>So we plug in the inverse proportion: (2911/((43. 60 seconds)) = << 29*11/((4*3)*(60*60 seconds)))=411>>411 miles per second.<n>We can then solve for yards: << 411*3 = 1233>>1233 miles per second.<n>Finally, we can solve for the distance: << 1233*60=73895>>73895 seconds.<n>The distance the person drove is << 73895. 60=454605>>45460.5 miles<n>Therefore, the person drove 45460 miles.<n>The final answer is 45461 miles.<n><n>

At a local ice cream shop, they can choose two different flavors of ice cream, soft serve or sherbet. An employee served ice cream to the 20 people. The employee had three freezers. Each freezer can hold three liters of ice cream. Each of the following combinations of ice cream flavors took up completely full freezers: 1. A freezer with only sherbet filled with 50. 2. A freezer with soft serve filled with 50, and a second freezer with sherbet filled with the same amount as the first freezer. Write a program that tells us the max of all freezers if there can be no overflow. Hint: you can use modulo for the max.<n>Output We can start by filling up the two freezers with the most ice cream (freezer one has capacity 3, freezer 2 3), that means 60 soft serve and 60 sherbet. That leaves us with two full freezers. Then we can put a total of 100 ice cream in the first freezer and 100 in second freezer. We are left using only 5 ice creams, the capacity of remaining freezer. Since each freezer can hold 3 ice creams, we will have to put 3 ice creams in remaining freezer. To put 3 ice cream in a freezer, we will have to start with (3+5)=8 remaining ice creams. If we multiply (3+5) with 8, we get 24 remaining ice creams. Since there are 24 remaining icecreams, we can put 24 icecreams into freezer using modulo 3.<n>So the finalAnswer is Freezer 1 with 60 ice creams, Freezer 2 with 60 icecreams and the 3rd freezer with 3 remaining.<n><n>Input: A certain group of 5 people can play soccer, basketball, tennis, volleyball, and badminton.

Choices:  A: believe in god B: pay bills C: group together D: enjoy themselves E: face each other<n>Output:		A and C both show that you can "face" someone. However, these two words are not synonyms, as "believe in God" and "pay bills" are. So the correct answer is "face each other," followed closely by "group together."<n>So the final answer should be "face each other" and "group together"<n><n>Input:What time is it now? Choices: 1 A: 6:40<n>2 B: 12:55<n>3 C: 9:45<n>4 D: 10:40<n>5 E: 8:15<n>Output: Choices 6, 2, 4 must be excluded by the rules of time. Since it is after noon, Choice E could not be possible. Since it is after 6 pm, Choice 1 cannot be possible. Since hour and minutes are divisible by 5, Choice 4 cannot be possible (5x20 must not result in 10 or more). So, Choices B, D, and 3 can be excluded by rule of "noon's" and "half past twelve's" absence, leaving only C to be the correct answer.<n>So, the answer should be C=12:55 and E=8:15<n><n>

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday.

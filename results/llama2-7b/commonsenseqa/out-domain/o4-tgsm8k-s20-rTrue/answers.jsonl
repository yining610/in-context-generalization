Therefore the maximum number of items is 1.\n\nIf x even = 2, there are 2 pieces of clothing of 2 cents and there is an even number of items.\nIf x even =3, there are 3 pieces of clothing, and only 2 are odd, so there is an even number.\nTherefore the largest number of x= even is 2.\nHence, the largest number of clothing that she can buy, from an odd or an even number, is 2.\n\nInput:If the total weight of 30 books is 47 pounds, how much weight is the largest book?\nOutput:In the statement of the problem, 30 is the number of books the girl has and her purse can contain up to 47 pounds.\nThe largest book in the statement of the problem is the one equivalent to 15 pounds.\nThe weight of the largest book is 15 pounds.", "answer": "D: contentment"}

There are 9 bananas equally distributed among them.

The Male monkey is eating two bananas per day and male monkeys can have 2 male monkeys. The female monkey is eating one banana per day. Therefore both male and female monkeys are eating two bananas each per day.\n\nLet\u2019s take an example, if there are 2 male monkeys and 1 female monkey, then there will be two females. 2(1) + 2(1) = 5. There will be two left, because every male monkey will have some bananas (which means the female monkey will not have any).\nHowever a football player is eating 7 bananas per day which means 2 bananas less. (9 \u2013 7). Hence we will take away 2 bananas from monkey(not from male monkeys) and give to the football player. Therefore the monkeys will have 4 bananas left so there will be 9 people left with 4 bananas each per day\nSo the final answer would be Male monkeys Female monkeys Football player\n\nInput: A woman has 8 sons and 7 daughters.

{"text": "He is B: at the park\n\nInput: How many days after a New Moon does a full Moon occur?\n\nOutput: The Moon's path around the Earth is an ellipse, not a a circle, so the time that the Moon takes to complete one round is longer than 22.5 days (the average time it takes for 24 hours, a day, to pass). So on an astronomical level, there will be a full Moon 48.6 hours after the last new Moon and 1.06 days after.\nThe word 'new Moon' is used to describe the first phase, where the Moon is darkest. It is the time in the lunar cycle when the Moon is closest to the Sun and is on the side furthest away from Earth.\nHowever, to an astronomer, a moon phase is never considered as beginning with the appearance of the first lunar crescent during New Moon phase, and this is because, they are not even the same phase of the Moon when new Moon and old Moon appear.\nSo, the time between a New Moon and a full Moon is not '48.6 hours'. There is more than just one full Moon every month.\nThe average distance between two full Moons is 29.5 days, so on an astronomical level there will be a full Moons 29.5 / 29.5 = <<29.5/29.5=1>> 1 day after the last full Moon, or 48.6 / 29.6 = <<48.6/29.6=1.6>> 1.6 days after, depending on the day.\nThe period between new Moon and full Moon is known as synodic period, which is the time the Moon takes to complete an orbit around the Earth. Since it takes approximately 29.5-29.6 days for the Moon to complete its full cycle, the time between new Moon and full moon is about 14.5-14.6 Earth days.\nIn contrast, the average length of a month is more than twice the time in a synodic period, at 28-28.5 days.\nSo, technically, it will be 29.5 or 29.6 days until a full Moon.\nThe Moon is always at or near its farthest point away", "answer": "A: in cinema"}

Since B is directly related to both A and C, B must be true as well. E is related to B, so we add E, and remove B from our answer choices.

Note that the above expression is true no matter what b and d are as long as\nd isn't equal to or larger than b.\n\nExample: Let n = (7 \u2013 1)/(7 \u2013 1). Therefore n = 6, since the remainder is always 1.\n<<7-1/(7-1)=6>>6 Example: Let n = (5 \u2013 2)/(5 \u2013 2).

I think the first exercise is rather challenging for freshmen. To many freshmen, English is a difficult subject to study for many reasons such as the high requirements, high expectations and many assignments needed to be completed every week. Moreover, many students do not know of the importance of good grades now as many of the teachers will not ask freshmen about their plans after their graduation as they do not know their plans so students are relieved from making their decisions now. Furthermore, many freshmen have no idea of what they should focus on in English which is studying Grammar and Sentences. This is because many English teachers will tell freshmen the importance of good grader on their own and some friends also told me that if you do well on your grader, you can study the other subjects that you have planned on your grader. That is why some freshmen only focus on their grader as they found it too hard to study on their own and also because they only spend little time on studying and do everything to the last minute.", "answer": "A: direct traffic"}

Then in solving an  addition problem (which is what is has) we start by putting in each of the terms. So we put in x+3/2 or 2x+3/2\nNow we need to solve for x. That is done by subtracting the expression that has x from the expression that doesnt and dividing by the power of 2.  If you subtract x+3/2 from 2x+3 then we have 2x-x-3. So we divide by 2 to get x-3/2 as the answer for x.\nThe answer is 2x + 3/2 -x-3/2= x/2 + 3/2-x= x -3/2 \nSo the final answer\nis 3/2.\nSo the final statement is two hundred thousand plus 3/2\n\nInput:\"How long is a flight from LAX to SFO?\"\nOutput: To find out how long a flight is, we need to find out the distance of the flight.

The company's market capitalization is now worth about $3.5 billion and its shares are worth $100 a piece. In what year will Joe sell his $1 billion dollar stake?\nOutput:Solving the equation for future years, we get $$C = \\text{constant}\\cdot (1 + \\frac{r^\\text{years}}{1 - r^\\text{years}})$$\nWhere $r$ is the rate the value of the share would increase, and $C$ is the current price per share.\nIn this equation, you can choose $$r = 10$$ as the value of the share will increase at $$10\\%$$ yearly. Also, let\u2019s say we choose $$k = \\text{years}\\cdot 1$$ so that $$k = 100$$ in order to find the solution value for number of years $$t$. Substituting $k$ and $r$ in the equation, we get $$C\\cdot (1 + 0.1)^t \\approx 1000$$\n\nThe right hand side of the equation will be near to the value of $$1000$$ when $$t > 9.89$$\nSo Joe should sell on a year after $1000$ is worth $1 Billion\nSo the final answer 10\n\n*input: You're looking for an answer to a maths questions but don't know what it is.

{"text": "Answer is: C. If your house is very dry, there are few of the water molecules that can form clouds.  These clouds will rise because of their temperature, they get cold and release water. The water molecules that get higher and higher will eventually cool down. When water molecules get to low temperatures, they condensate to form clouds.\nIn most places in the world, water vapor is pulled into low lying areas where clouds can form and rain can be formed.  If the temperature difference between the land below and the air above is large, the water vapor will be pulled into the atmosphere.\nIn the desert, this does not happen. The temperature is so low that when the water molecules try to rise up, they don't freeze because there's not enough water vapor to condense. Therefor not much clouds will be formed on the desert.\nSo the final is: C\n\nInput: A man walks from his house, where he lives on 15th Street, to his son's house on 35th Street, where he visits on Saturday.

{"text": "The only state not represented in the options was Indiana. So she was in the Woods (choice B).\n\n### Bonus Question: You are offered a bet in which you get $1,524 if you flip a head and you get $1,973 if you flip tails. Should you accept the bet?\n\nInput: There are two possibilities. The head and tails flips could be independent and identical coin flipping experiments (with probability.5 each) or they could be dependent - head results and tails results are correlated (with probability.75).\n\nIf there is no correlation, then the conditional probabilities are: $P(head|tails) =.4$ and $P(tails|head) =.3$. The total probability of \"flip is heads\" and the conditional probability of \"flip was tails\" is $.15^2$. So the conditional probability of \"getting $1,974\" given \"head\" is $.3$. Based on the conditional probability, we can say \"getting 2,500 dollars\" and \"getting 2,600 dollars\" are equally likely. We will accept the bet.\n\nIf there is a correlation, then the conditional probability of getting $1,972$ given \"head\" is $0.55^2$ and we can reject the bet to avoid loss of $1,624 dollars. This is the only time you should always reject the bet.\n\n### Bonu Bonus Question: You make a bet with your friend. If you get heads, you'll receive $16 and if you get tails, you'll receive the bet amount from your friend. Your friend gives you $130 before the toss so they have some way of ensuring that you should always select 'tails'. However, you just can never predict your friend. You should always accept the bet.\nInput: Again, this can be solved with Bayes' Theorem.\n\nThe probability of getting tails given that we've already got the money ($0.75$) is the same as the probability of getting heads given we don't have the money ($0.9875$).\n\nSo the probability that we get heads with a probability of $0.9876$ is $0.9884$", "answer": "B: woods"}

{"text": "There are several possibilities here, but I will give the most correct answer.\nChurch - The most people would prefer to sit close to God so they should sit in the first row as that row has the least amount of space.\nThis leaves the seats in the first row filled. There are 41 seats in a row, so 9 seats are left, each with 5/41 spaces. The second, third and fourth row are each at 6/41. In general, the amount of seats left for a row is equal to the number of spaces in that row divided by the amount in the row before it.\n54 people who all want to sit in the same church need 5/41 of those seats. The most people out of all 45 want to sit in the first row, and in total, there are 18 people in each row.\nIf there are 66/100 people in a room, and they are all facing the same direction, they cannot all be in the same row. In the first row, 9/10 would fit, so there should be 1/10 in the second, third and fourth rows, making 18/10 people in each of those rows.\nThere should then be 8 spaces left over for the fifth, sixth and seventh rows, which is 4 spaces each, making the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth rows have 2/4 people on average.\nSo the final answers are:\n5/41, 6/41, 5/41, and 8/41 and 2/4, 2/4, and 2/4\nFloor - The seats are always facing the room, so the seats are divided across the room into two halves. The first half fills the remaining spaces in the room. In that first half of the room, 9/18 people will fill the remaining spaces. Then the first eight will become the second half of the room, and for each seat filled by 9/18 in the first half, there is 9/16 people to take it. This totals (5*9/18 + 8*9/16) total of 61/18 remaining spaces. So 31/9 in each room has places in the floor for them, and the floor will fill the entire room.", "answer": "B: theater"}

In order to determine which is fastest, we consider every possible combination of cars and people.\nWe assume that the speed of the car is 5 and the speed of a person is 10. If a car goes 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 miles per hour and a person goes 5 + 5 = <<5+5=10>>1\n0 miles per hour, we can write the following equation for the speed of the person (for clarity, we omit the 1 from the equation that follows): (10 + 5) * 10 = <<(10+5)*10=100>>10\nWe can also write an equation for the speed of a car (for clarity, the 5 from the equation that follows is omitted): (15 + 5) * (10 + 1) = <<(15+5)*(10+1)=75>>75 miles per hour.\n\nHowever, we assumed that the person went 10 miles per hour for just one second, but the car went 15 miles per hour for 5 seconds, and the car went only 75 / 5 = <<75/5=15>> 15 miles per second.\nSince we don't know how much time it took the speed of the person to beat the speed of a car, we draw the following conclusion: 15 / 10 = <<15/10=1.5>>.\n\nThe speed of a person is faster.\nSo the final answers are 1.5\n\nInput: Write 6 as a product of its prime factors.

It is also possible that the coastlines are the same. If they are, then all the restaurants would be equally likely to be in either an east coast of a west coast city. If, however, the coasts differ and C or D is on the east coast, then E must be on the west coast.\nSo a seafood restaurant on the east coast would be in either A or B, but would not have been in C or D, or in E, if the coastlines differ.\nSo the final choice is A or B.\nSo the final answers are A and B.\n\nInput:The store was having a sale on lawn mowers.

{"text": "Option A and option E have the correct answer: The beaver builds its dam in a wetland. When a beaver builds a dam, it cuts the tree down and stores wood near where the water flows. This blocks off water from flowing and creates a millpond. As the water level rises, the pond fills with sediment and becomes increasingly vegetated. These dams are often built where there used to be a lake, river or stream. Wetlands are found all over the world. In order to be considered a wetland, certain criteria must be met. In Canada, they must \nmeet at least 3 of the 4 criterial set out by the Federal Government. Canada also has its own wetland classification system called the Canadian Wetland Classification System. This is considered a more accurate classification than the United States classification system. Canada has over 1.8 million ha of wetlands that are either totally or partially drained, or dry.\nDams can also be built by humans. Dams slow the flow of water through a river for various reasons. These dams can block a river\u2019s flow, stop flooding, or produce electricity. Dams for electricity are built in rivers. They are made of rocks, concrete, or metal, and may be built in an open channel (where the dam is the face of the river) or spilling over (where the water flows through an open channel). Dams for flood control or to store drinking water are dammed lakes, but this is not what is meant when we talk about artificial, or human-made lakes. While they might be made by humans and used to meet human needs, they have nothing to do with damming rivers.\nSo the final answe is E\n\nInput: 2 of 3 3 of 3 1 of 3 4 of 6 5 of 6\nOutput:\n6 6 3 4 5 4\nSo the answe is 6\n\nInput: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 (2+3)(4+5)(6-3+2) \nOutput: 18\n21*(18+17)/2 = <<21*(18/2+17/2)>=6\nSo the final answer would be 6\n\nInput:(2+5)*(", "answer": "C: millpond"}

Instead, as Bob left, he placed $15 on the counter, then took back $15 minus 25 cents back. Bob owes the clerk $14.75, so Bob has to return to the store to give the clerk that amount or the clerk will call the police.\n\nInput: Tom and Alex are watching football.

If the image of one side has no trace of nuclear material, you would expect the image of the other side to have none as well to a certain degree of accuracy. You measure the ratio of presence on the two sides, and given their measurements are 195:227, and their presence is 200:200, what is the degree of accuracy? \nOutput: Let the accuracy margin be x \nIf the machine has the accuracy of x and measured 195:195 as the ratio above, then the accuracy should be 0% given that the correct ratio should be 196:196 \nand that ratio is equal to 199:199, so 196 is smaller than 199 by 3 \nand hence we can conclude that the accuracy margin is not more than 3% \nand then the accuracy margin should be 0.03\nSo the final answer to x should be 0.3%\n\n\nInput: You have two identical glasses, one of which is filled with a clean white liquid.

This is because if the accuracy margin is 0.1%, then the accuracy should be\n200% given that 199 is smaller than 200. \nSo 200 is greater than 199, so that means the accuracy will be 200%\nSo, after holding two glasses, the accuracy of judgment is not affected.\nSo the final", "answer": "A: guilty conscience"}

What is the largest four digit number that can be made using this rule?\nOutput: The rule for choosing what number to use will begin with using the larger of the 4 digits, and then repeating the last digit. Therefore, after choosing the largest of the digits, the last digit will be left. Thus, 9 becomes 9999. Note also that this number is divisible by 4, but the number can still be divisible by 4 as we will see.\nIn order to create a new number with each digit repeated, however, an even number of digits are used. Therefore, we must create an even digit by using the sum of the digits of our number, divided by 2 as one digit. In this case, that means, the answer to the part of the problem relating to the creation of numbers by using repetition of digits is 9999 = 99 + 99 + 10 +101010 + 111111\n\nNow, we will move on to find a number divisible by 4.

At the end of the season, we will ski as much as we can but that is usually only for a day or two or for a total of about 16 hours.\nIn order to win, we would need to achieve an average time per ski run of 8 minutes.

If 5% of your friends are going to the party, and 95% are not,  what percentage are staying home?\n2. If 10% of your best friends are going to the store and 10% of them are not, what fraction are not going to the mall?\n3. If 90% of your sibling are playing sports, and 52% of them are not playing sports, what fraction do not play sports?\n\nAnswer: We can solve this using three-dimensional coordinate grid. We just look at how many dots there are in each column and row. \n\n1. So first, the number of friends would be 5% of 100 = <5*100=500>>500\n\nThen the number of friends who are going to the party would be 5% * 100 = 12.5 of 500 = <5%*100=12.5>>12.5\n\nThen the number who are not going are 500 - 12.5 = <<500-12.5=387.5>>387.5\n\nSo the percentage of friends are 387.5 / 500 = 0.78 = <7/10>>7/10\n\n\n2. So the number of best friends would be 10% of 10 = <10%*10=1>>1\n\nThe number of friends who are not going to the party would  be 1 - 1 100 * 10 = <90*10=9>>9\n\nSo the 90% of the best friends are going to party = 1 * 7 = 9\n\n\n3.So first, the number of siblings would be 90% of", "answer": "A: look beautiful"}

Now what should Jack take out to open the door?\nOutput: Jack takes out the things that were between his shoes and the cupboard in order to open the door for himself.\nThe question states that Jack put his shoes into a cupboard without regard to where the cupboard had shut. Jack can choose a different space, but the question states that \"it\" shut. \"It\" can only refer to one thing. Jack cannot open it because it is an object containing multiple dimensions. It is a cupboard, not a door. A cupboard has many dimensions, and there are more than two ways to reach the cupboard from outside of it so that the door will open. Instead, the space between Jack's shoes and the cupboards has shut the cupboard door. Jack must remove the shoes, and he can then open the cupboard again.\nSo the final answe is: He needs to take out the shoes.\n\nInput: Ravi rides to the store every morning.

How many red apples are there that have a diameter of more than three inches?\nOutput: Let n be the number of red apples that have a diameter of three inches or more.\nWe start with the expression for the number of apples with a diameter of more than 3 inches: n = <<2(n \u2212 3)>>2(n\u22123) apples, which says that the total number of apples with diameters of more than 3 is 2n \u2212 6 apples.\nWe want to know the number with a diameter of more that 3 inches that are red.\nTo do this, we want to multiply the fraction of red apples that fall in this range by the number of them that fall in this range.\nSince we know the number of apples total with diameter more than 3 is n\u20136, we end up with the equation 2n - 6 \u00f7 2 = 2n - 3 = <<2n-6/2=2n-3>>2n\u22123.\nThen, we divide both sides of the equality by 2. We get n\u20133 = n/2, which says that n/2 apples with a diameter more than 3 inches are red apples.\nSo the final  answer is 9/2", "answer": "C: city"}

Toby has a traveler's cheque with 720 dollars on it. Is Toby rich and lucky enough to have enough money to get home?\nOutput: Toby has more money in his account than he needs to return home. We need to determine Toby's total travel costs. 800 dollars * 2 = <<800*2=1600>>1600 dollars.\nThe cost to get to the U.S., Toby has to take out 100 dollars.\nToby also has to take out 80 dollars to get back from the U.S.\nAdding the costs to get to the U,S. and the cost to get back to New Zealand, we find that Toby has spent $1620, which gives him a balance of 580 dollars left in his bank account.\nWe can also check this using the 720 dollars traveler's cheques. Toby has 8 cheques left that can be used to get to the U and back. 8 * 1600 / 720 = <<8*1600/720=22>>22 dollars left in Toby's account after he returns home, leaving him with $558 dollars left in his account.\nThe final answer is 5450", "answer": "C: computer science"}

{"text": "The question doesn't specify whether it was going up or down, so the options \"B\" and \"D\" are all incorrect. The question does not ask for the temperature to drop to zero, but to what it \"was really beginning to do\". Since the question only mentions the word \"cool\", we can only be certain that the temperature is beginning to \"cool down\". Choice \"A\" is incorrect because there wasn't any drop in temperature. The question states that the temperature began to cool, which suggests that it wasn't at zero degrees already, so choice \"C\" is ruled out.

This can be done by creating a system of equations, and multiplying them.\nLet's begin by creating our first equation:\n1 x 9 = 9\nThere are 9 places in each box for 1, meaning that at least one of the boxes must contain 1.\nNow that we have our first equation, let us create our second equation.\n1 x 9 - 9 = 0\nEach box must contain exactly one 1, which means that 9 - 1 = 8 boxes must contain one of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.\nNow that we've created our second equation, \nlet's create a third:\n9 x 9 = 81\nEach box must contain 1 number, which means that that box can either contain 1 or the number 9.\nSimilarly, we'll create our fourth equation:\n81 x 81 = 6735\nEach box must contain just 1 number, meaning that (again) we can either have 1 or the number.\nWe continue to create equations in this manner, until we run out of numbers in each box.\nWhen we have done this, we have the number of ways to place 9 numbers in exactly 1 of the 9 boxes.\n\nExplanation: If you would like more explanation as to why this works, let me know.\nSo the final answers are 6735 81 9 9 9 and 6735 and 673681 or 673567368 and 673738\n\nInput: Two cars leave town at the same time and travel in the same direction.

How far did he drive?\nOutput: We first look at how far we can drive in reverse: (43 yards / 45 seconds) = << 43/45=0.94>>0.94 yards per second.\nThe speed of the car going forward is 20 times faster, which is 2911 yards / 140 seconds = << 2911/140=20>>20 yards per second.\nSince the reverse and forward speeds are different, and it's clear they are not the same, we can't just add their speed to get our answer.\nSo we plug in the inverse proportion: (2911/((43. 60 seconds)) = << 29*11/((4*3)*(60*60 seconds)))=411>>411 miles per second.\nWe can then solve for yards: << 411*3 = 1233>>1233 miles per second.\nFinally, we can solve for the distance: << 1233*60=73895>>73895 seconds.\nThe distance the person drove is << 73895. 60=454605>>45460.5 miles\nTherefore, the person drove 45460 miles.\nThe final answer is 45461 miles.", "answer": "C: mass hysteria"}

At a local ice cream shop, they can choose two different flavors of ice cream, soft serve or sherbet. An employee served ice cream to the 20 people. The employee had three freezers. Each freezer can hold three liters of ice cream. Each of the following combinations of ice cream flavors took up completely full freezers: 1. A freezer with only sherbet filled with 50. 2. A freezer with soft serve filled with 50, and a second freezer with sherbet filled with the same amount as the first freezer. Write a program that tells us the max of all freezers if there can be no overflow. Hint: you can use modulo for the max.\nOutput We can start by filling up the two freezers with the most ice cream (freezer one has capacity 3, freezer 2 3), that means 60 soft serve and 60 sherbet. That leaves us with two full freezers. Then we can put a total of 100 ice cream in the first freezer and 100 in second freezer. We are left using only 5 ice creams, the capacity of remaining freezer. Since each freezer can hold 3 ice creams, we will have to put 3 ice creams in remaining freezer. To put 3 ice cream in a freezer, we will have to start with (3+5)=8 remaining ice creams. If we multiply (3+5) with 8, we get 24 remaining ice creams. Since there are 24 remaining icecreams, we can put 24 icecreams into freezer using modulo 3.\nSo the finalAnswer is Freezer 1 with 60 ice creams, Freezer 2 with 60 icecreams and the 3rd freezer with 3 remaining.\n\nInput: A certain group of 5 people can play soccer, basketball, tennis, volleyball, and badminton.

The water from the pond is then flowing into the river and flowing down to the well.\nSo to get to the well, one can cross the river to the pong, go to the pond and then go along the river to the well.\nThen they can use the rope to cross the pond to the pong.\n\nThen they can take the rope out of the well and use it to cross the river to the tomb.\nThis answer is also reflected in the image provided for the problem.\nSo the final path taken to the well by the explorers is from the pond to the river to the puddle to the river to the well and then back to the tomb.\nOr in numbers,\n1. river from well to pond\n2. river from pond to well\n3. river from pond back to pond\n4. pond from river back to river\n5. river from pond up to the well\nSo the final answer of the solution to follow this path is <<5>>5\n\nInput: Dylan and his friends found a large circular room with some pillars and candles burning in them.

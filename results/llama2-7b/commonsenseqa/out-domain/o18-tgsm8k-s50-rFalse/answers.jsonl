How many apples and how many doctors are required to keep a doctor away for an entire year?\nOutput: \n\n#### Constraint:\n\nInput: \n\n#### Solution:\n\n#### Explanation:\n\nWe can use 0 to represent a non-apples value, and we can assume that we get the same number of doctors every day. So, in our example year, I would have 0 apples the entire year if I ate one doctor per day.\n\nThe amount of apples needed to keep a doctor away equals the amount of apples needed (per day) minus (the amount of days that equals a year).  You can add all the days up and then use the equation: (number of times per year) - (# of days in that year).\n\n1 apple per day for 365 days would require 364 apples.\nOne apple a day for an entire year would require an apple minus all the days it needs to be an entire year. For example, if it is 365 it would be 365*1=365 apples. \n1 apple every other day, the amount of apples would be 364*2 = 728.", "answer": "D: republican party"}

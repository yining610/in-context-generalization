If less than 5 players pick the correct answer, no player wins anything. How many times will a player need to play to win if the game is offered 4 times a day for a week? The first step is to calculate the number of games:\n\n 4 games a day * 5 seconds a game = 20 seconds a day spent playing a game.  The next step is to compute the number of seconds required for a player to get 10 correct answers over 20 seconds. We have:\n\n 20 seconds / 10 correct answers =  2 seconds.  One more step is needed: Computing the fraction of seconds after 10 or more people have all made their correct guesses.

I will never buy in bulk. This may sound like a stupid answer, but it is based on something like \"It is bad for my health, and it will make me fat.\" The cost difference between buying a pound of chocolates and buying in bulk is so small. The storage space for 2,00 pounds of chocolates vs buying 250 pounds of chocolate at once is not worth it. Unless I'll be gaining some benefits from my purchase, there's no reason why I buy in bulk.\nB. I would buy a bulk of 250 pounds and make sure the chocolate I bought would be used before it expired. By buying bulk, it will definitely give me a discount so I can eat chocolate for less. It would also help my health because instead of buying a pound for myself to snack, I buy in bulk which would prevent me from gaining weight.\nSo, it is good to buy in bulk.

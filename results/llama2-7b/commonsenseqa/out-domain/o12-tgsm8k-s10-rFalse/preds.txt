Town is not included in 'east coast of North America', which is a place that covers everything east of North America, and it should have 'the'.<n>2.When we are talking about multiple options or location, we use's'. We should keep both article. Like 'C: beach towns', it should be 'C: beach towns'.<n><n>### Instructions:<n>Read the problem and fill in the blanks based on the input you were given.<n><n>### Input<n><n>### Input 2<n><n>### Instructed Response<n>* For 2, "There are 2 things" should be "There are three things".

The word 'blanks' is incorrect. We should replace that phrase with '_choice_' because it is a place where multiple choices can be put.<n>

The letters in the set will always be vowels. The function will make the sentence more correct, by removing words that are missing a vowel. In the case where it cannot do that, it will remove any vowels. <n><n>### Inputs:<n><n>1. How does one spell a sentence?<n>2. How could you tell if a sentence was correct?<n><n>### Response(s):<n>[Answers to "How does one spell a sentence?"](<n>The standard way to spell a sentence is with a space before the question mark.<n><n>There are many ways in which you can determine whether or not a sentence is correct. The first and most obvious is to look at it and read it. You could also use the Spoof function to determine whether words are missing vowels, which would tell you whether certain words were not in the sentence originally. Finally, you could use the Reorder function, which is another function that would remove vowels if that vowel is not necessary for the correct spelling of a word.<n><n>### Input(s):<n><n>1. What would you do if someone handed you a newspaper with the headline, "What is 'Spoof' and how does it work?"<n>2. If you had the same newspaper with the headline of "What would you do if someone gave you a pair of glasses that let you read invisible ink on the paper."<n><n>### Response (A to B):<n><n>[Answers for "What would you do..."](<n>If someone gave me a paper that had the headline "What is Spoof and how does it work?", I would probably start by trying to figure out how to spell "spoof." If I couldn't figure it out on my own, I would use Reorder to come up with a solution. After I had an answer to how to spell spoof, I would probably try and do the same thing with the question mark and the space.<n><n>If someone gave me the same paper with the headline "What would you do," I would probably start off by looking at the question and reading it aloud.

The idea of the problem of reversing a list is to turn a list inside out. In the problem statement, we are assuming that you have a list of integers, and that you have the index of the element you want to start with. For example, you can think of the array in Python like this :<n><n>def reverse(arr):<n>    n_arr = []<n><n>for element in arr:<n>    temp = arr.pop()<n>    n_arr.append(temp) <n>    <n>return n_arr<n><n>Example <n>```<n>reversed = reverse(list(range(10)))<n>```<n><n>### #Proble: # <n>## Fizz Buzz<n>For this challenge, we will be using an idea we used in the "reverse a list" problem. The problem "Fizz Buzz" is a classic challenge where a programmers has to determine whether a number passed in is divisible by "3" and also divisible by "5" and when it is we need to output "fizz-buzz" otherwise output the number. This is where the idea of popping elements from arrays was introduced.<n><n>```<n>def fizz_buzz(arr):<n>    newarr = []<n>    <n>    for num in arr:<n>        if num % 3 is 0 or num % 5 is 0:<n>            print('fizz-buzz')<n>        elif num % 3 is not 0 and num % 5 is not 0:<n>            newarr.append(num)<n>        else:<n>            newarr = newarr.append(arr[i])<n>            print(num)<n>

To help her budget, Janet estimates that gas costs $1.50 for every 1.5 miles her car travels and that a $25 movie ticket costs about the same as 1.5 gallons of milk. She then looks at her list of expenses. She pays $15/month for a cable television account, $60 for her cell phone bill, and $140 for her Internet. She pays $5/month for car insurance and $35/month for car payments. If Janet’s car gets 25 miles per gallon of gas and she doesn’t use the air conditioner or the heater, she estimates her monthly transportation costs at about the same as $3 gallons of milk. Her cell phone plan allows her to make 1000 minutes of phone calls. Janet figures that if she doesn’t make more than 1000 phone calls each month, she spends the same amount on phone calls as she would on milk.<n>How much do Janet’s regular expenses cost her each month?<n><n>### Response <n>$604.<n><n>We want the sum of gas, insurance, and car payment. We also want the sum of the payments for internet and cable televisions. Gas will cost 1.5 gallon x $25. This is her regular gas bill, if she buys food for $3/gallon she will get $1.50 so this is one gallon. Milk is $4/gallon.<n><n>Gas = $15.95 per month<n>Cell Phone = $35 per month<n>Internet = $60 per month<n>Car Payment = $140 per month<n>Car Insurance = $5 per month<n>Total Monthly Expenses =  $270<n><n>### Solution For This Program<n>

You will get disconnected from the game for a minute because the server will shut itself down, but you'll quickly be back in the game.

The quality of the food and service you received was top-notch.__<n>#### You decide not to renew your car insurance after your car was broken into. You had to pay thousands of dollars to repair the damage. __At the time you purchased your insurance, however, the insurance costs were comparable to the potential damage to your car.__  The insurance policy you purchased with the company has to pay for a lot of unexpected costs, including lawyers and fees for damaging other people's cars and belongings during an accident.

Choices:  A: wasteland B: ocean C: desert D: parking lot E: flowers<n><n>### Response:		F)<n><n>### Explanation: The question had the answer "parking lot" in it. Since it doesn't say anywhere in the context that it was a "lot" that was demolished, I would go with the garden being demolished for parks in the city, which would mean that the second response choice, A, would be invalid in relation to the question. Thus the answer would be E: parking lot and not anything else.<n><n>### Input<n>A: Everyone was so excited to see a snake on their way to school that they thought it was really a cool snake. <n>B: The snake's appearance was very creepy but not threatening so the kids got a closer look. <n>C: The way he glided through the hallway and up the staircase made everyone excited. <n>D: They were not expecting to see a snake. <n>E: He seemed to be very large but maybe everyone was nervous. <n><n>### Response<n><n>### Explination:<n>Input provided in previous questions: A and D only.<n><n>Output: I have no idea what the text is suggesting.  Maybe they have a snake phobia <n><n>Comment: Can anyone tell me why this answer is correct?<n><n>The text says "Everyone was so excited" -> Everyone was expecting a snake and was not expecting a human.<n><n>The text says "...a snake on their way" -> They knew they were going to see a snake at school.<n><n>I am confused as to why option B is valid. <n><n>Comment: I added a small comment on the answer to help out.<n><n>Comment: @SaurabhYadav If you read the above question, it is referring to a choice rather than the question.<n><n>Comment: If that is the case, then how does question `6.` have the choice:<n>`E: parking lot`<n>as a valid answer?<n><n>Comment: What is confusing me about choice D  is that it was not stated in the question that people were expecting snakes to be there.  It merely stated that the kids wanted to see the snake, but did not state that they were expecting snakes to show up there.

Choices:  A: hostility B: anger C: nose D: fists E: hands<n><n>### Response:		B<n><n>### Note:You may write out your response in another document but MUST show in the code response.<n><n>### Input :A new product is being developed by the company. The company needs to decide whether or not it is to be manufactured in-house or out-sourced<n><n>### Demostration:<n>In-house: Company A has 10 employees that work for a total of 1680 hours each week. Company B has 20 employees that work for 1680 total hours each week.  If a new hire needs to be hired to manufacture the product, Company A pays $13 per hour, and Company B pays $14 per hour, it costs the company less to produce the product in-house, as they already have people on the payroll.  If the new hire needs to have a minimum level of expertise, they could be paid $14 per hour to give that person the skill level to be at-par to the minimum needed by Company A. Company A would require a total of $22720 for this new hire, while Company B would require $24000.  If the new product is being manufactured in-house, it will cost the company an additional $12800. The new product costs $300 per unit.  The company has 1000 units in mind.  For the amount of money they will be spending on the new hire, each unit will cost an addition $128 ($22440 + $1280).  If Company A does this, they will actually make a bigger profit on the per-unit cost.  If Company B does this, they will lose money on the sales and purchase of the product.<n><n>### Response A:<n>In-house<n><n>### Response B:<n>In-house is the better choice, although it may require spending a bit more for the manpower as previously mentioned, in-house is cheaper and much more efficient, the in-house manufacturing requires a bit of hiring but a large percentage of the company already possesses the skillset to fulfill the job, if they are contractors to produce in-house then it will cost more than what they would get to fulfil the job, also, it is more time consuming to hire contractors

Choices:  A: toy store B: story book C: great outdoors D: countryside E: wildlife refuge<n><n>### Response:		<n>Explanation<n><n>First we have to eliminate the choices that do not fit.<n><n>A: It is unlikely that he would have fond memories of a toy store. <n><n>If the giraffe was a toy, it would probably have been sold after some period of time. This is a memory he would rather erase.<n><n>B: A storybook character is a fictitious character from a work of fiction. <n><n>They would not be a real person.  This would not be something he would have any memories about. <n><n>C: This is not likely to be an item he would remember fondly since they tend to be used for something else once the season is over. Also, calling it a great outdoors or countryside would make more sense, at any rate. Also, if this was something he called it in the past, it would likely have been something he has done for a long time. <n><n>Lastly, "wildlife refuge" would not be something you call a mascot.  This could be used to describe some wildlife attractions, but generally, it would be another word if it were the mascot and not the attraction. <n><n>D: C: The closest fit of all the choices is "countryside."  This is something that he would still remember fondly, or else he likely would not have mentioned it in the story at all, <n><n>It is unlikely that this would have been what he called the mascot given the fact that it is something he would remember fondly, <n><n>As per the instructions, he "called the giraffe mascots a cow."  If it was any of the others, it likely would have been different, <n><n>E, this is the correct choice.<n>

As part of their activity, they are planting saplings. However, they want to give a plant to every single student from all the other different schools! What is the minimum number of saplings they need?<n>Inputs: Number of schools : 15 <n>Number of students: 40000 <n>Answer: 400<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>Since there is only 1 school, we can multiply the number of students in the all-round by the count of the schools. The result of this operation is 400*15=6000. Multiply this by 4000 students we get: 6000*4000=2400000, which is larger than the number of the schools. To sum this up we divide the result by the size of a school:<n>6000*300/15=400<n>

Choices:  A: tiredness B: grogginess C: discomfort D: getting out of bed E: eyes opening<n><n>### Response:		C E<n><n>### Evaluation:(1) You are able to solve this simple mathematics problems based on addition, substraction, multiplication, and division. You are aware that to solve addition problems we add the digits of two numbers in the equation as it is stated. The results we get from this operation is known as the sum. Similarly, to solve multiplications we multiply the numbers in the problem. Therefore, if we multiply to numbers then we get its product. In the problem of the grocery bill the grocer bought 1 can of tomatoes and 1 can of ketchup when the total prices are $3.49. So, the problem asks to find the total cost of the products. Thus, the total prices of the products is: 1 can of tomato + 1 can of kachup = 3.49. However, to solve division problems we divide the digits of the problem as shown in the problem to find the result. In the problem, 1 kilo costs $12, and 2.5 is half of 5.00. As we see, to find what cost the product is, we divide 5.00 by 2 and we get the remainder of the fraction as 0.5. Therefore, half of 5.5 kg is two kg.<n>(2) You are able to explain simple concepts of fractions. To begin with, you are able to identify fractions as a part of or a ratio of a number. In the problem, it is clear that the fraction 1/2 represents half of the total money spent $12 for each kilo. Therefore, $12=1/2*5.00. <n>(3) You are able to distinguish between what a percentage and a rate is. A rate is a rate where we measure the number of units per a time frame and a percentage is a ratio of a population to another. You are aware  that one percent is equal to 1/100 and it is written as 1%. In the problem, 56 is the total cost of the food purchased, to find the total cost divided by the number of bought kg.<n>(4) You are able to understand and perform basic calculations of percentages. You are able to multiply two numbers to get the answer. In the problem  a percent is 1/4 or 1/10. To find how much James

Choices:  A: lie down B: run away C: bite D: keep alive E: feel pain<n><n>### Response:		I see that a number of animals will feel pain when touched and can not be touched.<n><n>**Explanation:** "Lie down" and "run away" refer to the natural reaction of an animal who wants to be left alone, without any fear. So, the animals which have pain when touching shouldn't be touched "at any cost".<n><n>The other choices cannot be true because:<n><n>A. "Lie down" means the animal has no fear of you. However, only animals which don't have any fear of it should be touched, so lying down has nothing to do with being able to touch them.<n><n>B. "Run away" means the animal has some fear of you. This is the opposite to what wants to happen since the animals should be touched, and we want to be able to do so.<n><n>C. "Bite" can be true of some animals that is fine to be touched, since "biting" is a behavior that indicates aggression. However, not every animal has aggressive behavior, so "biting" is not required.<n><n>D. "Keep alive" is a strange choice as well.<n><n>E. "Feel pain" is the last choice which can be the right one, since every animal that doesn't run away or bite will feel pain when its touched.<n><n>### Input A:Choose the letter of the month from the list below.

Choices:  A: theater B: refrigerator C: bakery D: grocery store E: oven<n><n>### Response:		<n>A: Theater<n>B: Refrigerator<n>C: Bakery<n>D: Grocery Store<n>E: Over<n><n>If you go to a theater, it can be a fun adventure with lots of interesting shows.  You could also be interested in taking your family to a theater for a show.  A refrigerator would only make sense if you want to store food.  You could also put your leftover birthday cake into your refrigerator if you don't have space in your kitchen.  A bakery is also a good place to buy birthday cakes from.  You could go to a bakery to buy a birthday cake for a friend if your friend does not have enough time to bake a birthday cake.  After seeing your friend's birthday cake and eating some pieces, you could go to your friend's house to eat the rest of the birthday cake. Going out to eat a cake at a bakery is a good way to make a fun outing with friends.  The bakery may also give you ideas for making a birthday cake yourself.  Going to a grocery store is also a good reason. A store's kitchen could get some ready-made birthday cakes for you if you don't feel like bakery.  Baking a birthday cake is also a good reason to do this kind of work. You could ask relatives to help you bake a cake before you're sick.  If they say "no" to help you bake the cake, they might let you know what to bring them instead of a cake.<n><n>If your work is to buy groceries and you buy ingredients at the grocery store without baking birthday cakes, you're not really baking any birthday cakes.  You're just picking up ingredients for your birthday cakes.<n>

Then x increased by 2 is equal to 12. Three of those are equal to one fifth of x which is equal to three fifths of 10 which is equal to x*. You should multiply x* by 10 which is 1.5 so the equation is 3/5 times x*. The answer is 15.<n><n>### Input 1: How do you get to a thousand?

The last 2 digits in the number are 00 which are simply the end of the number we are multiplying ten by itself. If you write the number down you will be able to see that 0 0 is the result of multiplying ten by itself so many times that the result is equal to 1 0 0 0.

Choices:  A: unfeeling B: negligence C: antipathy D: indifferent E: rapport<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>> **D. Indifferent**<n><n>### Instructions:  Write the number of the best answer.<n><n>### Input 1: If a man walks 20 paces per minute and the woman walks 25 paces per minute, in how many hours does it take for them to reach a point 210 miles away?<n><n>### A. 48<n><n>### B. 30<n><n>### C. 53<n><n>### D. 45<n><n>### E. This number cannot be determined without additional information.<n><n>### Correct answer:<n><n>> **B. 30**<n><n>### Reason:<n><n>The two walk at the same speed, so 1 mile per hour (1 mile/hr) is equal to 21/210 miles per hour (or 1 mile/3.14 hours). To find how many minutes it takes, divide the rate by 31.14 to get minutes per mile, and multiply by miles per hour. Then multiply by 30 to get minutes. Using the multiplication is easier than division, so it takes them 120 minutes. To find the resulting hour, divide by 60, the number of minutes in an hour.<n><n>To do this calculation without the numbers given, we would first convert from miles per hour to miles per day and then divide. If 1 mile is equal to 10,000 meters, and 63 divided by 60 is 63/60 == 1 mile per day, then 210 divided by 60 = 3.5 miles per day. That makes: 3.5 days in a week == 1 hour + 1 hour + 2 hours per day. It takes 12 minutes per hour divided by the mile, or 3.33 minutes to walk a mile. This gets multiplied by 210 to come out to 710 hours to walk to the point. We can divide that by 24 to convert hours to days, or 30 days to get the result. The correct answer is B: 30.<n><n>### Notes:<n><n>If I had to express this in words, I would say that you could do multiplication or division, but because the hours are already in there and not

Choices:  A: tide pool B: beach sand C: tidepools D: current E: cooking pot<n><n>### Response:		<n>*Answer A is scuttling. Crabs scuttle along the surface of the ocean floor.<n><n>*Answer B is shoreline. Crabs scurry along the edges of rocky shorelines, looking for a snail to eat.<n><n>*Answer C is current. When the tide turns and pushes the crab from its home to new ground, crabs scuttle.<n><n>*Answer D is tide pools. When the tide is high, sea crabs swim. Once the waters start to recede, crabs scurry back behind rocks and tide pools.<n><n>*Answer E is cooking pot. There are many recipes and cookbooks for crabs. Seafood aficionados prefer them steamed or baked because they contain more fat than crabs that have been dredged for other seafood dishes like jambalaya or pasta.<n><n>### Input - The newborn puppy ran back to its mother’s side and hid under a bush. Choices: A newborn dog B a tiny wolf C a very young bear D a very small fox E a little baby tiger<n><n>### Response -<n><n>*Answer A is newborn dog. Newborn puppies are born with two openings. A bitch usually gives birth to 2 to 10 puppies, but may have as many as 16 or more, especially if there are more than two puppies in the litter. Newborn puppys have large heads and are tiny in size. They are blind and deaf for their first couple of days in life, and are totally helpless without their mother for warmth, and protection from the cold and dangers outside.<n><n>*Answer b is a very young wolf. The young usually stay with the nesting female until she no longer requires milk from them. In most species, only the females care for the young; thus wolf packs are made up solely of females. In a wolf pack that stays together throughout the year, some wolf puppies stay with the pack, while others return to their original pack.<n><n>*Answer c is a very young baby bear. Newborn baby bears, commonly called cubs, are tiny and blind, born either partially in an upended sleeping tree or in a hole

There are a total of 20 chickens, half of which are in the coop. In order to count as grazing in the yard, the chickens need to be outside of the coop. In three hours, the coop can only contain the following amount of chickens:<n><n>$$max\{2*A-B,0\} = max\{(200-5)*25,0\} $$<n><n>$$max\{100-5,0\} = max\{100,0\} $$<n>which simplifies to: $$40$$<n><n>Therefore, there are 40 chickens that are outside of the coop,  and each of them will graze 8.5 yards as described above. If there are 25 chickhens in the coop, that means there are a total of 65 chickens, but there are only 40 outside of the coop with 8.5 yards to graze with. Therefore, 65-40 = 25 chickenson, which can stay in the coop.<n><n><n>### Input2:<n>Pretend you have 300 pennies. After you buy some snacks and a soda,

Choices:  A green mushroom, a red mushroom, a yellow mushroom, and a brown mushroom.<n><n>### Response(s):<n><n>John is on a hush for mushrooms, but he only found green and red mushrooms.<n><n>### Outcomes:<n><n>1.  The mushrooms do not count as two kinds: they are either "red mushrooms" (red and one other) or "green mushrooms" (green and one other).<n>2.  The "two other" kinds are combined into a single kind.<n><n>### Rule:<n><n>In order for mushrooms to count as two different kinds.  There must be *at least* two distinct mushrooms.  A red mushroom cannot count as two distinct types of mushrooms because it could be both red and yellow.<n><n>### Questions:<n><n>> What kind of mushroom does John count as the third?<n><n>> How many species can John see from the mushrooms?<n><n>> Is it possible for any mushrooms to come from the same species?<n><n>### Rule(s):<n><n>The first answer is wrong, the third answer is not correct, the second answer might be correct.  (There is also no definite rules for this because it is more of a guess.)<n>

Choices:  A: pets B: fills the pond C: attempt to fly D: school together E: breath in water<n><n>### Response:		<n>#### Answer:<n>D<n>#### Explanation<n>Fish are not pets, and they don't breathe in air.<n><n>#### Input:<n>The number of goals scored in an NBA game by exactly one player last season accounts for 30% of all goals that were scored by all NBA players the previous season combined. If there are 713 goals scored by one player in the previous season, how many goals were scored in total in the previous season in the NBA?<n>You can think of this question like two questions at once. <n><n>-  How many goals are there in total?<n>- How many goals were there that did not belong to one player?<n><n>For the first question, you can ask what the total number of goals is. The first word in the question gives you that: 713.  Since the total number of goals scores last season by one player is 33.3% of the total the question is asking for, the question implies the total score is somewhere above 2200.<n><n>For the second question, you can ask how many goals were scored by everyone besides the player.  You can do this by subtracting 33.3*2200 from the total. That would result in 1666.7 (more on why that answer would work later).<n><n>The total then can be found by adding the two: 1666+713 = 2379.<n><n>*If you can't figure out how to get through steps like this, you're probably a novice at solving algebra problems like these.<n><n>### Answer:<n>![Answer](./images/36.png)<n><n>### Input<n>The total number of miles an oil tanker can haul is 15*100.*(5/16)^2 with a maximum carrying capacity of 16*10^6/144 in tons.

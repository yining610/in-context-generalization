Your program gets the number of unique values that were added to the list and the amount of times a given value was added to the list as inputs. The program will output the number of unique values if they are present, and the number of distinct values added if not. If the number of distinct values that were added are below the number of unique values, the program will output a message indicating that there should be more unique values than distinct values. If that's not the case, the program will output that. Otherwise, if the number of unique values are below the number of distinct values, the program will indicate that the unique values exist. Write the program with the appropriate flowchart.<n>Output:  If the number of distinct elements in the list is less than the number of elements in the set, the program should output a message indicating that only some of the lists are not unique.

The questions are answered by a random generation program and if 10 or more players choose the correct response within 5 seconds, the player wins $20. If less than 5 players pick the correct answer, no player wins anything. How many times will a player need to play to win if the game is offered 4 times a day for a week? The first step is to calculate the number of games:<n><n> 4 games a day * 5 seconds a game = 20 seconds a day spent playing a game.  The next step is to compute the number of seconds required for a player to get 10 correct answers over 20 seconds. We have:<n><n> 20 seconds / 10 correct answers =  2 seconds.  One more step is needed: Computing the fraction of seconds after 10 or more people have all made their correct guesses.  Since there is an additional factor of $20, the answer is (2 seconds * 5 people).<n>Output: 20 seconds<n><n>Input: What is the best way to divide 24 into 18? There are three ways of doing this:<n>1:  Divide three units into 14. The remainder is 8. 8 / 3 = 3 remainders.<n>2:  Divide 18 by 24. The remainder is two. Two remainders.<n>3: Take three and divide it into  18. The remainder is 6.<n>Output: 2 is right. Since the remainder is larger, you could give each person 4 units or divide the remainder evenly.<n><n>Input: What type of fruit do you eat when your head hurts? No type of fruit<n>Output

Inventory will be used up on a first-in first-out basis and there is no cost for handling or storage.<n>- The cost to ship 2,000 lbs of chocolate at a time is $6 a pound<n>- Shelf and storage space will cost $14 per sq. ft. per year regardless of how much chocolate is stored<n>- Each pound of chocolate costs $1<n>A. I will never buy in bulk. This may sound like a stupid answer, but it is based on something like "It is bad for my health, and it will make me fat." The cost difference between buying a pound of chocolates and buying in bulk is so small. The storage space for 2,00 pounds of chocolates vs buying 250 pounds of chocolate at once is not worth it. Unless I'll be gaining some benefits from my purchase, there's no reason why I buy in bulk.<n>B. I would buy a bulk of 250 pounds and make sure the chocolate I bought would be used before it expired. By buying bulk, it will definitely give me a discount so I can eat chocolate for less. It would also help my health because instead of buying a pound for myself to snack, I buy in bulk which would prevent me from gaining weight.<n>So, it is good to buy in bulk. I would like to know the cost difference of buying in bulk if the cost for shipping the 2,00 pound of chocolas is $5 a pound. <n>C. To be honest, there is no way I

His response was to note that in a game of draughts on a 4 square gameboard, it is possible to get stuck if one side is playing too defensively. That is, one can always win or draw from a chess position, as long as one can force a checkmate in 5 moves.  But in draughts you can always end up with a stalemate, where both sides have only one legal move.  In chess, one would have more liberties to be able to find such a series.  But in any even numbered game for instance, when either player has one more square to defend than their opponent, it is always possible to get stuck in a stalemate.<n>Output: 61<n><n>Input: In order to create more traffic in their city, the mayor of the town came up with the idea of creating 3 different traffic light colors from the ones he already had.

So, the cost is $56.<n><n>The time he spend at the gymnasium a week is 4 * 3 = 12 hours.<n>The fuel price is now $200 * 85% =480.<n>The total number goals scored is 300 and that is accounted for 20% which is 60. So the number of goals are 360.<n><n>The liquid consumed by a person a day is 6 * 24 = 144 oz.<n>Five people put 3 each * 150 = 450 stone blocks. That will go into 300 - 750 = 225 shipping boxes which will hold 20 * 20 * 5 = 50000 widgets.<n>She worked 5 days, 8 hours to earn $150 a 5 * 150 + 5 = 750. And she also earned an extra 5 * 5 = 25.<n>To move up to 300 is a total of 3 * 5 * 7 = 165.<n>Andrea pays for the pony $54 * 60 / 12 = 312 * 10 / 12 in one year.<n><n>The 6th son is Friday because he has 5 sisters, Friday is the 6th day of the week starting from Monday through Sunday.<n>The 6th day for a week has the 7th son which is E.

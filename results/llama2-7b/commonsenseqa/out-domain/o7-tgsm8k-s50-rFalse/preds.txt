Choices:  A: prison B: bridge C: locked up D: homeless shelter E: neighbor's house<n><n>### Response:		<n><n><n>### Input<n>> I would say that the first part of this would be B, and the second would be D. You might have a different opinion, though. For more about my opinion on this problem, please continue reading below.<n><n><n>### Response<n><n>The first part of the problem was to determine where Ben was during the period of time in which he was an alcoholic (which is 8 years).  The second part of the problem relates to where Ben was when he went into the accident.<n><n>### Solution<n><n>The first part was to determine where Ben had been during the time that he was an alcohol.  In my opinion, the answer would be that Ben had been in prison. During this time, Ben was an alcoholic, and because of that he couldn't get out fast enough, and so he stayed in the area longer than the people who weren't alcoholics.<n><n>The second part dealt with where Ben was during the accident.  It was said that because of Ben's mistake he spent 8 years in a bridge, or somewhere that wasn't home.  In my opinion Ben was homeless, and so he spent the night somewhere other than his house.  However, we can't assume this based off of the information that we are given.<n><n>### Explanation<n><n>As we can see from the story, Ben had spent 8 years as an alcoholic.  Ben was in prison for about 7 years of these 8, and then spent the remainder of the 8 years as a homeless person.  In my opinion this could change though.  Because alcoholism is a disease and Ben was in prison for 7 years, we can't say the for sure that Ben wasn't homeless before.  However, this is merely one of the many possibilities that could have happened.  That's why I consider the story to be not entirely factual, and my response to this question would be that Ben was locked up during this time.<n><n>### Revised Question<n><n><n>### How could you change this to provide a more detailed explanation?<n><n><n>### Did you find this answer useful?<n><n><n>## Comments<n><n><n>## Reader comments<n>

Choices:  A: idaho B: shopping mall C: big city D: in town E: new york<n><n>### Response:		Department stores have been on the decline in favor of more accessible malls and big box stores. In order to maximize the number of customers who would be interested in going to a department store, the best place to build would be a mall or big box store. I would choose location D. Shopping in a big city can be overwhelming and costly for some people. Choosing location A would be a mistake because department stores in Idaho are few and far between, making it difficult for residents to get a variety of products. Choosing location C would not be beneficial either since most people do not want to shop at a major city such as New York. <n><n>### Input-<n>If I were to compare the growth rates of Apple and Oracle, I would have to use this comparison.

Choices:  A: under bed B: symphony C: music room D: band practice E: music store<n><n>### Response:		<n>Please pick C.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>Under the bed is where a lot of people keep their unwanted items and where they like to store bags of junk. A bedroom and closet is where people place things the they regularly use and the space is limited in the bedroom so keeping an instrument in the bedroom would not be desirable. A music store is probably out of the question as well since they do not need to buy an instrument for their own personal use and the music store is not the best place to get rid of their old instruments. A symphony is where people go to listen to a performance, not where they keep an instrument. And finally, Band practice is where a band of musicians practice their musical abilities, not where they keep their instruments.<n><n>### Response2:<n>Please pick B.<n><n>###Explanation:<n>An adult has more experience and a better understanding of music than a child and would therefore do a better job of putting the instrument in the correct place.  This reasoning would apply for almost any situation. <n><n>###Response 3:<n>Please pick A.<n><n>###Explaination:<n>The answer should have been picked to be B, but choosing A is not entirely wrong since the child might have found the instrument they wanted to play and will have the parents to guide them to what the correct place to put their instrument is.<n><n>###Response4:<n>Please pick C<n><n>###Exaplanation:<n>Keeping the instrument under the bed will cause the item to be covered in dust and it will take more effort to keep the space clean and it could end up getting dusty again. This type of clutter is always more likely to get damaged or broken.  If the instrument is stored in a space with plenty of breathing room it will not have to be covered in dust or become broken and damaged more easily. <n><n>## Instruction:<n>Describe the data on the graph below.<n><n>```<n><n>### Solution:<n>The data displays 2 separate linear graphs, one graph has a starting value of 0,0061 and the other a value of 0,103.

She collected $162. After paying 40% tax, she had 76 cents left for candy. The rest of the money was saved in banks.

The formula is S+R=T, S is the price for Susie's first lot, the first lot price is $162, R is the price for Susies' second lot, the second lot price is $116, T is the remaining after her tax, the tax is $75.16, total money that Susie have to deposit in the banks is the remaining after tax $14.92, so the equation is<n><n>$$S+R=T \space\space;\space\space \space\spaceS+R=14.92 \space\space; \space \space\space R=14.9-S \space\space;$$<n>$$(62-16.09)+R=14.88$$<n>$$49.92+R=29.96$$<n>$$R=10.04$$<n>$$59.96+0.14=29.92$$<n>Hence, Susie deposited $2,799.12 into Bank A, Bank B and Bank C where $2799.10 is the first lot and $0.12 to the third lot<n>

Choices:  A: factory B: construction site C: engine D: insides of skyscraper's walls E: shops<n><n>### Response:		C<n><n>### Input-Description<n>Tony is standing on top of a building on the 84th floor. He walks towards the edge, and drops the metal rod which he tripped on. He drops the metal rod from the 84th to the 3rd floor. He then gets on an elevator that had traveled from the 84 to the 1st floor. He walks back to the metal rod and picks it up from the 1st floor to the 10th floor, where the rod comes to a rest.<n><n>### Response-Description<n>He tripped and fell on the 3rd floor of a construction site that was on the 84 floor of a tall building. We aren't told the name of the building, but it can be assumed that it is likely a skyscraper. Since he fell to the 3rd and then the 10th, the building is most likely constructed vertically since he would have hit the skyscraper' floor had he been falling horizontally. The building was likely a high rise building.

It can teach you many things, like how to play football well. It can also teach you how to run a high risk high gain business. In the end, this question should not even be on quora. You wouldn't ask me, what is your favourite movie? I would say 'The Hurricane'. Well, that's the end of my answer.<n><n>### Note:The answer is not given in a paragraph. It should be on a separate line.<n><n>* A: Yes, if you are really old, you would get all of your money saved.<n>* B: The question is not about what will become of the dollar in terms of its price in the future, but in terms of its value. It might mean how much of the money you save today is not enough for you to live on in the future because of inflation. And that is why a 20 dollar bill doesn't mean much anymore, it doesn't even give you 20 bucks in value anymore, and that is what the question means when it asks 'how about $20'.

He couldn't get out the door.  He was very frightened when the smoke detectors went off, but luckily it was a false alarm.  Why might he be stuck? Choices:  A: fire B: belong to C: winter storm D: face south E: burn down<n><n>### Response:		B<n>You are correct. The sentence that I provided is correct. However, there were a few things I wanted to point out.<n>For starters, I think there is more than "a couple of spelling and grammar errors." As your sentence is missing some necessary punctuation, the reader may not be able to tell the difference between an independent clause and a coordinating conjunction. Moreover, the sentence could be reworded in several ways to better express my idea. If it is important that the sentence remain grammatically correct, I believe that it would be best for the sentence to be edited by a more experienced writer or editor.<n><n>I also think that the sentence could be rephrased to better reflect its overall message. For example, you describe John as "stuck" in his house due to the fact that he couldn't get out of it. However, I feel that the verb "stuck" does not adequately describe the reader's reaction when the smoke detectors go off. For example, using words like "frightened" or "afraid," would probably sound better.<n><n>Finally, I believe that you should have used a different verb in line two, the word "frightened" in line one doesn't make sense. For instance, if John was scared, you could say something like: "Luckily for him, it was only a false alarm."<n><n>All in all, this is a great activity and I think everyone should participate in it.<n><n>### Input 2: You buy a car<n><n>### Response 2:I will take the car.<n><n>### Response<n>The idea of writing a response is to improve your vocabulary and spelling. If you can, the more you try to avoid using words like "you" and "me." For example, instead of saying "you have to pay more for gas" you should write something like, "you will have to plan your budget."<n><n>For the sentences you write, it's important you use accurate grammar and spelling. You should also avoid making mistakes by using correct punctuation, such as commas, periods, and question marks.<n><n>It's also important to use proper syntax or sentence structure when writing a response. In your examples, "I take the car" and "I will take the car" should be written in the same way. You don't need to give yourself

When you divide 8 by a fraction, it gives you a remainder after you end the division problem.<n><n>### In this example, the remainder that you will obtain when you divide 8 with 2/3 is 2. When you divide 2 by 4 it gives you a remainder of 0 and so 2 divided by 4 =3.<n><n>### Examples:<n><n>Dividing 8 by 0 = remainder 0<n><n>Dividing by number by by 1/0 = remainder 1<n><n>Dividing a whole number by a rational number = remainder<n><n>Rationalizing a fraction = to getting rid of the remainder and converting to a decimal.

Choices:  A: airport B: car C: jewelry store D: garbage can E: laundry room<n><n>### Response:		D<n><n>### Demostration: <n>**(Please write a line showing the answer to the question in the response section above)**<n>The drawstrings allow for the netted portion to be open for use. That means that items placed in the bag cannot slip out the top edge of the bag if they try. The drawstrings only appear near the neck of the bag to close it off at any time, and not for any specific thing. Therefore they are only used for the purposes of the bag, and not specific purposes for different items. They are also used for the bag to remain open at various other times. **(Please write the rest of your reasoning in the response section above.)** <n>

Choices:  A: drop out of school B: ask questions C: enter school D: wash dishes E: read book<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer: A<n><n>### Input<n><n>### Question<n>The difference in ages between Richard  and Hurley is 30. If Hurley  is 8 years old, what is their difference in ages 32 years from now?<n><n>### Demonication<n>If the current ages are 7 and 38, the future ages will be x and 70. The future ages that make a difference in age of 32 years away are then x +32 and 70 - 32, which have values of 40 and 38 respectively. Therefore the difference in age is 18.<n><n>### Input <n><n>### Question <n>The price of a ticket to a movie theater is normally described as 5 dollars plus tax. It is said that taxes for regular tickets are 40% and super passes cost $9.50 as taxes. How much does a general admission movie pass cost?<n>### Demonstatorion<n>The general admission movie price is 8.46 dollars. 1.60 is to be subtracted from price to get the tax. 7.86 = 0.6 and.4 of that is tax = 1.2. Tax is.3 of 7.86 so the answer is 7.86 + 1.2 which equals 9.06.<n><n>### Problem <n><n>### Input Question <n>Tommy worked at a book store where books are sold at a markup of 20%. What would be the total cost of buying 3 books to find a novel you want to use in school?<n><n>### Solution <n><n>Tommy bought 3 books and needed a 20% markup to pay for the book. Therefore, he has a 20% discount price. He still needs to calculate this total cost by using 0.8. Since Tommy bought 3 books, he has a total price of 8. 4 is the square root of 20% and the decimal 392/1000 since 39/25 = 1.56 thus 1.562 *3 = rounding 3.18, 6.36, 9.54. That means his cost would be 7.72, 1

Let's say A is larger than B by a fixed amount.<n>### Step 2:<n>These problems are also divided into 2 steps. I.e. we need to find what the larger quantity is in both problems, then calculate the smaller quantity. To find the larger quantity, use the following equation :<n>![](pic-01.png){:.center-image height="400px" width="600px":}<n><n>### Step 3:<n>If we find out which one is larger, we can calculate the other. The only time we can‚Äôt find the other number in one of the above calculations is when the first number is exactly 1 less than the second number. If it is exactly 1 less.<n>![](pic-11.png){:.center-image height="600px"}<n><n>This is the only time when the calculation will not be 1 less than the first number. We use this case (where the first and second numbers are exactly 1 less than each other) where no formula can be calculated. <n><n>In other words, we need to divide the first number by the formula in 36 to find out how big the second number and then to divide the second number by the same formula again to find out how big its first number is. We did division in all our solutions and not multiplications. <n><n>Let's take a look:<n>![A, B, formula; 36](pic-02.png){:.right-image height="450px" width="450px"}<n><n>In this case the difference between them is exactly 1 so we got the original formula. <n>![A, B; 36; A, B;2(36)](pic-03.png){:.left-image height="420px" width="350px"}<n>![

Choices:  A: shake hands B: own property C: pay bills D: smoke E: talk to each other<n><n>### Response:		<n>I think the last one, "own property", would be a great thing for them to do.<n><n>### Input <n><n>What is the best way to organize your closet and make finding what you want easier?<n><n>### Response<n><n>Based on my background knowledge, I think using colors to organize clothes would be the best option.  I have done this and it has made my find what I need much easier to do. However, I learned that it is sometimes easier to put clothes in a clear bin, then color code the bags.  This is also what I use in my shop that I run with my wife.  The benefits of using colors is that you know where something is without even looking closely and sometimes it takes the clutter away from your closet.  But if you use colors, you will get bored, and that is when it is easier to sort your items in clear bags.  That way you can easily reorganize and you never get bored.  This is what we do in my shop.  As far as dresser drawers, I would probably organize them by type and lay them out in a way that makes sense. This makes it easier to find specific items and it allows you to see all the items you will need or have for a specific task or event.<n><n>### Additional Information <n><n>The organizing of the items depends on the amount of stuff you have.<n>

The least number in the list is 7. Explanation: A sentence and a statement is not the same thing.<n><n>### Response- Explanation:  <n>The answer is D. We are told that we have to write a sentence after getting a list of numbers from the greatest to the least. We are then told to print out the smallest number in the list.

If the final score was even, was any point earned after the last point?  Explain why your answer is accurate.<n><n>### Solution:<n>No, the answer is wrong. If the final score where 4-3(even), then there is no need to add more point to it because it is already even.<n>The question is asking about the situation where the next score was 5-3 (scores differ by 2 not 3) and the answer was that there was 1 point because the last score was the final score, it's 5 (5-3=2 and it is not the final score).<n><n>### Input to solve:  You have 90 gears in your motor.

Explain why. <n>### Solution:  If a gear has an RPM of x and it's connected with another that has an RPM x+y, it will rotate once in y units during the rotation of x units. This means it's possible for only 9 gears to have RPM of 2000 when they are used on the shaft that spins with a RPM

One type is pink taffy and the other is green gum.  A box of pink taffy costs $2 and a box of Green gum costs $3. 15 boxes of one type and 30 boxes of the other type are stacked neatly on the shelf.

They are playing the game with one chess piece that has three equal sides.  A move for the game costs 1,024 points.  A player can either move 16 or 20 checkers in each move.  The first checker costs 4 points, the second checker is 3 points, and the third checker is only 2 points.  How many points are lost if someone loses?<n><n>### Input2  The two chess figures are both knights; the one John is controlling is the top knight.  The two knights move differently according to the position.  The black knight moves in the shape of a "U" and must follow a path of five steps, then three steps, followed by two steps.  The top knight moves in a "V" shape, moving according to the rule of alternating rows: one row is followed by the row that was missed.  What does the pattern of rows have that enables the top knight to capture the black knight with one move?<n><n>### Responses  A: The black knight is forced to move back to the original row with the top knight's initial move. (The row the black knight moved from is always followed by the row he started on, and then followed by the row the knight missed.)  So the black knight must always end up in the top row with this pattern, leaving the top knight in the position to capture the black knights.<n>

The message should be formatted just like the example above. You may not use any hardcoded constants in your code. Your code should be able to pass a test. This example code will be very helpful as well.<n>```<n>### Instruuctions:Part 2:<n>```<n> Create a function (solution) that accepts two positive parameters (sum and borrow) and returns a string that includes the answer value and the ‚Äú(sum, borrow)‚Äù variable. The message should be created just like the example above, but you may use hardcoded values such as ‚Äú40‚Ä≥.<n> Your code should be able, when it is executed with your parameters, to pass a test.<n> This example code will be helpful as well.<n> ```<n><n>### Notes<n>- The input for this exercise doesn't have to be hardcoded. In fact, you probably won't need an input at all. Instead, the computer will generate randomized inputs for you to try the methods on. To help get you started, check out the example code below. In this example, the computer will generate inputs, and then the functions will solve the problems for you.  All you need to do is call the functions in the correct order. <n><n>- Here is how your functions should be formatted. Your inputs should be defined as integers because these are the only kinds of values the computer can understand. When defining your functions, make sure to include the name of the function, a space, and your parameter. You can use whatever names you want. <n><n>- The name of your function should match the parameter you supply. <n><n>- After you define your function, you can add a print function to your code. This will print the actual value that you supplied in the input.  So for example, if  you want to print the value 35 to the screen, your code would be:  <n>`print("the input number was 35")`<n><n>- If you want to print the parameter value in the function call, you can call the print function again after you define the function and pass the parameter to it. <n><n>### Example

Choices:  A: persia B: table C: living room D: house E: desk<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer: C<n><n>### Why did you decide to answer the way you did?:<n>I answered this question the way I did because it seems like the most sense and makes the most sense to read. I also think it's easier to read than the other options and it keeps everything in order instead of having to do math to figure things out which I personally don't like to do. I also used a lot of common sense in my answer instead of trying to figure the answer out mathematically.<n><n>### What were your initial responses?: Was there a pattern, structure, or routine that you followed in your approach to this assignment? Did you use any strategies to understand the instructions better? Did you use any resources (examples, websites, etc.) or any other outside help (classmates, friends, etc.) to help you?<n>I don't really follow an exact pattern or structure when it came to writing my answers, but I did follow my instincts and my common sense more than anything to help me figure out the problem, like for the part of "The total sales of the six companies was more than the sales of any one of the individual companies". I chose to explain things using an equation instead of trying to write it out in words and since I'm good at geometry, I chose to use triangles to make it simpler, even though that's probably not the exact right way to explain this problem. I also didn't do to much research like I normally would since I have a lot of research papers due in my other class. I used this website to help me with the questions I couldn't answer and I asked a few of my friends as well for different examples of how to phrase certain questions so I could get a better idea of the assignment since I do write my answers phonetically so it's harder to understand what I wrote.<n><n>### If you are happy with this response, please complete the rest of the form below...<n><n>### What did you learn from this assignment? Did you have any problems with it? Was it helpful, and if so, in what way?<n><n>I think I learned how to write better. I know my handwriting is really bad, which is why I usually write my answers phoneticly instead of writing it out like how the instructions tell us to write out the answers. I also learn how to use my common sense more than my textbook answers. I felt like I did better

Choices:  A: sum B: likeness C: alike D: sameness E: similarity<n><n>### Response:		<n>If you answered "LIKE", then your guess is incorrect and you owe the bank a total of $1.06 + 35%.<n><n>Based on the instructions: Write a response that appropriatly completes the request. <n><n>Answer: <n>![](https://i.imgur.com/MF7Ekj4.png)<n>If the two differences are equal, the answers must be the same and the question makes no sense. Also, the bank does not collect interest on 1.06 and why would the bank charge 3x the interest if the loaned amount is only 1.06%. Finally, since 56% of the bank fee was due to your late payment of $1.07, the bank has effectively loaned $1. If $1 has been borrowed at an interest rate of 25% per month for a period of 8 months, the bank is required to pay 150% (3x56, rounded) = $1.5 + the $1.07 that was previously due. The bank's total payment to you is $2.57.<n>Input: $2000 + 56% is divided between Samir and Kevin. This is $1100 for Kevin and $0 for Samir. If Kevin has 50% of the original amount, then he has $0. If Kevin has 75% of the original amount then it makes more sense. So the question should be<n><n>Input: Kevin has the same money divided between four friends. He gives 1/4 to Ben, 1/2 to Carlos, another 21/2 to Tim and 3/4 to Samir.

Choices:  A: hardware store B: basement C: garage D: repair shop E: the library.<n>Output:		 E<n><n><n><n><n>### Solution:<n><n>1. You can tell by looking at both equations that x(y + z) = 2500. That's because both sides of the equation represent the same thing. So both sides contain 2500 somewhere.<n><n>The LHS (left-hand side) tells you something about x. The term x(y + z).<n><n>The RHS describes y and z because it contains (y + z).<n>2. First, write the equation in two parts:<n><n>2500 = (c + d) + (d - c)<n>Adding those two parts together, you get:<n><n>2550 = (c + c) + (d - d)<n>2550  = 2c + d + d - c<n>2550 - 2c + d = 2(d - c)<n>2554 - 10c - 120c = 2(d-c)<n>2544 - 100c - 140c = 2d<n><n>2. Solve for x as x + 10 = -42 and then solve for b by subtracting two values. b - 1 - 10 (or 9) = -41 and you get -40.<n><n>3. You're using fractions rather than whole numbers. That's because the money is split into various categories, and not one is a whole number in terms of dollars. If the money is split into 4 categories, then each of those categories will receive a fraction of the money. If you don't have whole numbers, you can use fractions! Let's do some substitution here...<n><n>165/4 = 41.25. Now, you only need to solve part of this problem. If 165 divided by 4 is 41.26, then divide both sides of the equation by 165 and you get 41.22. So you'll need to solve for x as x + b = 41.<n><n>The second part is simply a sum of numbers, and that's easy: it's 0 + b = 43, and so b = 43 - 0 = 43. To verify

Choices:  A: town B: at hotel C: mall D: business sector E: yellow pages<n>Output:		A<n><n>### Solution:<n>### Answer<n>In order to solve this task, I have used a simple recursive function that iterates through the given sum of age and subtracts 30 from the age in each iteration. When I reach to the last iteration, the resulting age would be the age of Richard + age of Hurley.<n>  <n>### Answer<n>To get a result in this task the first that we need to do is to let a recurring function that returns a value that is n times more than the input value. Secondly, we have to multiply by 1.05 to get the total cost for the candy that the user has purchased. The recurring function should be like the following:<n>  <n>```javascript<n>function recurring(n) {<n>     return n* ( 1+.05);<n>}<n>```<n><n>### Answer<n>We know that Harper is buying 70 eggs not 60 eggs. So, there are 70 eggs are available for everyone.  Now, I have a function that returns a string in which is first 10 character is used for the original number and then the remain number is used to  generate a recurring number for that number. For example, for 80 the base number will be 8 but the recurring number will be 8,8(80*1.05),8(80* 2/10), 8(80*3/10),............. 8(80*(1195/100)) and the last remaining number will be 8.<n>  <n>```javascript	<n>function recurringFunc(num) {<n>            String.fromCharCode(String(num).charCodeAt(0)-48); <n>            for (var i = 1; i < 10; ++i) {<n>                return this.charAt(10*i) + recurringFunc(parseInt(this)+i);<n>            }  <n>            return this;<n>        }<n>```<n>    <n>### Answer<n>For this task, we need to let a recursive function that calls itself to solve the problem. The function should have a condition that the child must be less than the parent and it should break with recursion if the father can't be of any value. Let's see,<n>

They were attending classes remotely from their homes. This was something unheard of. This was the very beginning of school and each student had to log in to a particular website in order to communicate with one another. The school was holding a quiz to see which class was the smartest, but the website was not working for the second grade class. They were furious that they were not at school, and this made it harder for them to solve the problem they were facing. They were only having the students use the technology that they always had at school – their phones – but none of them had internet access because they were on their phones, and they had to use their landlines, and they could not call each other on their phones so it would not confuse the other children in the same class on other landlines.

When he wrote the answer in the box below that was 6 cm long, 5 cm wide, and 4 cm tall, the teacher only gave him 4 credit points for answering the question correctly. Why is that?<n><n>### 4<n>Ans:When a problem statement is stated, it is always best to read the problem statement fully, clearly and with a critical manner.  The information given is important to read. The problem statement of the question is “he wrote the answer in the book which is 6 cm long,  5 cm wide, and  4 cm high, the teacher gave him 4 credit point for answering the question correctly.” The book is described as “6 length, 5 width, and 4 height”. The answer is given as “6 length,  5 width, and  4 height”.   We can see that his answer is a miss match with what the problem statement describes. The teacher might not mark him with full point because the answer that is provided is not in accordance with the problem statement.  Furthermore, some problem statement does not tell what type of question it is. We need to know how to solve the problem given in the problem statement first before we attempt to answer the question.<n><n>B. The teacher asked the class to think as a group for answers. Since the class have not agreed on an answer, they were marked as wrong answers.

Take the function you wrote for problem one and give it a random argument and print the result of addition. We are only going to look at addition for now but you should think of other basic aritmetic operations like subtraction and multiplication.<n><n>After you are done try the functions using the inputs listed above. What happened when you used variables that were not defined?  What happened when you gave it extra arguments to the function?<n><n><n>### Submission Guidelines<n><n>Make sure you have `print("done!")` at the end of your program. Submit the main program `mystery.py`, not the functions as a single file, and not as a zip or folder. Also make sure all the files are named with a `.py` suffix. If you have submitted incorrectly it will likely throw a syntax error if you try to run the file as a program. You can also run your python script from the command line using the python command `python xxx.py`.<n><n><n>### Expect<n><n>[![Expect](https://img.shields.io/badge/MISC-Expect-D24741)]<n>[Expect documentation](http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#code=Expect%20%3B%20def%20run%20%3A%20%22%20%3E%22%3B%22%2B%20%2B%2D%3A%22%22%3E%20%3D%20%20%2F%2A%20%3F.%3Fn%3D%7B%0A%22*%5Bi%5D%3B%2Ci%3D1%7B%2Cj

How much shampoo does one shampoo bottles last for?<n><n><n><n>Solutions<n><n>#### Answer: 10<n>Input: The difference between Richard and Hurley ages 40 years, if Hurley is 12 then Richard age 50 years.<n>Output - answer was 128 (which is the correct answer)<n><n>#### Answer: $650<n>input:- In the end, everyone decided to split the amount 800,232. The number of books read in the end was 12.<n>Output - answer $650(which is the correct answer). Explanation:-In the first option, the money (232) has no relation to the original question.<n>In the second option, there are 20% discount for the candy, so we need to multiply the candy amount with 12/10. After that take the cost of books and subtract the discount from it. (The original value of the books was more than the discount.) The answer will be (1060+960)/2 = 1040.<n>In the third option, we can use a similar approach. The remaining cost has to be divided equally between 6, after that we subtract the amount of the gift and we have the answer.<n>In the forth option, the number of eggs is 60, total number of eggs is 50.<n><n>In the fifth option, the number of friends is given and the cost of cakes. There is an extra amount (289) in the original price of cakes which has nothing to do with the question.<n>In the final option, the total amount is given as a multiple of 240 but it is not mentioned that it is the cost of the entire item. Since we need to find out percentage, we have to divide the first part by second part. The answer must be a multiple of 200 as well, since they used 200.

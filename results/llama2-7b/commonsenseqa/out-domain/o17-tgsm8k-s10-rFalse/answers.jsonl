Then I create two for loops. The outer for loop runs two times, each time I find the tuple matching the tuple(2, b'name').  I check whether each of the elements in the inner for loop are equal to the elements in the outer for loop. If they are not equal to the same elements of the outer for loop. I print out the elements and check whether the elements of the outer for loops are equal to or not equal to the elements of the inner for loop.  At the last of the outer for loop, the value of cnt is how many times I iterate through for loop. After solving the first, I want to use the cnt in second for loop to find the number of your dog's breeds and the element in cnt is the first of tuple of (2,b'name',b'breed'). If the value of cnt = 0,  there is no equal dog breed. If the value of ccnt = 1, b'dog_breed1' is equal to b'dog_breet2'. Then I find the value of b'dog_breeds' by creating another tuple and each element is the 'dog_breed1', 'dog_breed2', 'dog_breeds', and then I print the value of b'email' by comparing each element with b", "answer": "A: conquer opponent"}

Danny is the youngest child in the family.\nHow old is Danny?\nAnswers: D\n\n- Danny will be the youngest child in this family, but not necessarily in the following year. This means that the birthday might be the next year. \n\n- Danny is in the same room as the other three. This means that birthday party must have been in some time ago.\n\n- Danny did something, but he was not the youngest then?\n\n- I believe Alice was the youngest, she had the cake but Danny wasn't in the picture. So Alice should be still the youngest.\n\nThere are three ways of thinking about the problem:\n\n- Danny must be the youngest, for all the other three he has done something that is not normal for a youngest child, so that means Danny must be the last to be the youngest, so Danny must be the current youngest child.\n\n- I think what the previous way is stating is that we can see if the youngest has done something that he/she may not be expected to do otherwise at his/her young age. For example, Danny and Calvin are the youngest two, but Calvin is older, that means Calvin did something that he should not have. On the other hand, if Danny is the current youngest child, then he is supposed to be the first one to do something or have some special event or something and then the order of birthday would be Alice, Ben, Danny and Calvine. The picture supports us that Danny is the young in his family, so Danny is the young child in the family. \n\n- The key question is that how old is Danny, Danny would be the same age as Alice.", "answer": "B: play sports"}

Whenever we didn't know whether each coordinate corresponds to the guessed or not-their number, we looked at every coordinate and compared it with the elements of the 1 * N (for example N-1) dimension.\n\n  In order to be exact, we looked at each coordinate pairwise.\n\n3. When we didn't know in which coordinate should the number has been put, we have decided to put it in **all** coordinate pairs at the same time. This can be explained by the fact that when we know which coordinate we should have a number, but we don't know the number itself yet, it is actually the same thing.\n\n  In particular example, when we didn't know which coordinate should contain a number 4, we didn't have to guess all the possible coordinates, rather only the coordinates pairs should be checked if they contain 4\n\n4. If we didn't know, that the whole coordinate list represents the set of objects, we have decided to check the first coordinate. If the element in the coordinate equals the number to guess, we have added this number to the vector of the guessed numbers.\n\nWhenever we checked two coordinates", "answer": "D: italian restaurant"}

In other words, if sum1 has a larger value than sum2, then just take the smaller sum sum2, and subtract it from the larger sum sum1.\n\n\n### This was a bit tricky to me, so bear with me haha. The solution is to add the three variables into an equation and plug in the variables.\n\n### The solution is to first multiply their weights total, which is: 62+55=117.

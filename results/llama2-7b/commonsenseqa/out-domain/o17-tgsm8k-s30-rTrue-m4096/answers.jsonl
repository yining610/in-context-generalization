{"idx": 27, "text": "He could have keep going his body appreciated the the rest he had been constantly what during?\n\nAnswer: So, we are asked the question, \"How can I put this sentence in context?\"  First, there is no question mark at the end of the question, so it appears to be simple declarative sentence.  If there is no punctuation or question mark, then it is assumed to be a question.  Second, the sentence has a definite grammatical flaw in that the sentence lacks punctuation between the words \"his\" and \"body.\"  Since this is clearly a declarative sentence, no exclamation point is required, and this is punctuation that must be added in context.  The most obvious way to resolve this would be to add an exclamation point at the end, but it is not correct because an exclamation point is usually reserved for an exclamation and this is definitely not an exclamation.  There is too much confusion as to how the word \"body\" fits into the sentence for it to be an exclamation.\n\nFinally, the words \"though\" and \"could've\" are out of place.  We want to assume that the question comes somewhere after the sentence, or that, it is written after the fact and not in the actual question.  For example, \"though I could've kept going ______________ I opted to rest today.\"\n\nSo, to resolve this question in context we would add an exclamation mark to the sentence, then question marks, and then a question, \"Why did he feel his body appreciates a rest?\"\n\nAnswer:  \"He could've kept going\"? \"He\", then \"could've\"? No way.  \"He\" is a third person subject pronoun so one would say, \"He could go, he could sit, etc.\"  Therefore the sentence should state, \"He could've...\"\n\"body appreciated the rest, it\"? Hmmm... \"it had been constantly what during...\" The most reasonable answer would be, \"It can not stand to be constantly...\"\n\"Though\" or \"though he could've\"? Again, \"He\" is a pronoun, so we would say, \"He did not could've, and that...\"\n\nSo we have to find something that makes sense out of the above sentences.

The discount rate is 50/100 = <<50/10=5>>5.\nThis means that 5/10 is taken off, or in other words, 5 is discounted out.\nThus, $7 is discounted, and the result is $4 after the reduction.\n$12.00 - $1.00 - $4.00 = <<12-.1-4.00=10>>10\nSo the original sale price after the reduction is $10.00.\nThe new sale price is 120% off $10 = <<120/10=12>>10\nTherefore, the original sale price after a reduction of 50% off is $10 x 12/10 = <<10*12/10=1.2>>\nThe", "answer": "A: violence"}

How many square feet of grass can fit inside a square yard?\nOutput: You could turn one square yard into 20 smaller squares because you multiply 1/0.75 by 1.\nThe other answer here says you multiply the whole 1/0. by the whole 1, but really that means dividing by 100 which is 1/100.  So, to get the answer, you multiply 1 by 20. (1/0.7 * 1) = 5 because you multiply the whole 5/0.75. The square yard is 1 and you multiply 5/0. by 1. That is 5 because 5/0.0625 = 1 because you divide 5 by 0.062. (1/0)0.75 = 5 because you divide 1/0.075 5 times and it results in 1. So 1 yard contains 5 square yards.\n(5 * 1) / 0.75 =\n0.5\nSo the final answer 0.75\n\nInput: I think I have an STI, Dr. Derek!  Please check my results.

{"idx": 165, "text": "The answer is B. A bassoon is a high sounding orchestral wind instrument used as a solo instrument and a section member. It has a range from F below the bass staff to F an octave above the treble staff. The bassoon has a cylindrical bore with the reed like other woodwind instruments, and its pitch may be determined by changing the placement of the reed in the mouthpiece or by adding or substracting keys, in the same manner as clarinets or oboes. The bassoon is not an easy instrument to play. The bassoon reed is small and fragile, and the bassoon instrument itself is large and heavy, particularly at its lowest end. A good bassoon player needs to have large lung capacity and great dexterity to be able to play at an advanced level. The sound of the instrument is best heard in an orchestra when the bassoon player is playing at a lower range. In a high school band playing a bassoon would sound much different than in an orchestra playing a bassoon.", "answer": "E: high school band"}

Thus, perspiration and palpitations are a 25% chance and shuddering and growing older are 50% chance each. They sum to 100%, so it can't be one of them.\nSo the answer must be reproducing or having rapid hearbeats.\nSince there are two of these options, there is a 50% of getting either one.\nNow let's consider reproducing.\nTo reproduce, you must be alive.\nTo reproduce, there must be at least two people in the reproduction equation.\nTo reproduce, at least one of those people needs to be alive.\nSo, we can say for a 100% sure that the choice to reproduce is a 50/50 chance.\nNow, let's look at shuddering.\nTo shudder, you obviously have to be alive.\nshudder involves nervousness, which means that your heartbeat is already racing from stress.

Since the question is talking about pigs, we'll just take the 'i' for this question, and from there, i'll multiply it with myself which can be interpreted as taking another 'i' which means that we multiply by 2.\nThere's then this phrase: \"but she only uses her left side\": We know that pigs don't have 2 left sides, so this indicates that we should do the operation in half, so we multiply by half which is 2\nBecause I only use half, I only take half my snout away. If the snout is 2 meters, I will just take 1 meter away so that only my right snout extends. 1 meter to the other pig will be 2 meters, and then the two pigs only have 1 meter (1000/2=<<1000/5>>5 for one pig) and 2 meters for the other pig. Since we're talking about this type of question, we'll just be taking the other pig's snout, which is 2 meters, and the entire left side of me (left).

B: A monstrous beast can break through every mountain. C: Even an average gorilla can run so fast that they will kill almost anything on the side of the road.\nAnswer: False. Even though the bears are large and strong animals, they cannot run fast for long periods of time which is why they are most likely to catch fish, which are easier to catch than most animals. Because the bears are so strong, they have a big target that catches other animals. Monsters have some kind of magical power that makes them so strong and fast that they can even break bones! However, even if they walk 1 kilometer, they will still be able to run very fast. Even gorillas can run so fast that it may even be considered a challenge.

Therefore, we will give two coins to a person and there are eighty-six left over.\nTherefore, if we have a $1 coin + a ten and a nickle we can make three more nickles in coins.\n\nSo 2.18 quarters + 2.18 coins = <<3.168>>3.16 quarters and 0.18 nickles.\nSo the final coins in the box is 3.168 quarters and 0253.16 quarts\nExample: <<3.16>>3.16\n\nInput: The temperature drops 30 degrees below zero.

If a touchdown results in a 12-point victory over the field goal, then how many more touchdowns did my team score over the field goal?\nOutput: Let t be how many more touchdown points my team scored.\nFor example, if a team got 6 points, 8 points, 12 points, and 12 points, 2*12 + 12=<<2*12+12=24>>24 touchdowns.\nSimilar logic:\nIf I got 6 points, then 6 is not equal to 3(field goal point), so 1 is not equal to 1 (if I got 6 points), so 2 is not equal to 2 (if I got 8 points). If I got 12 points, then 12 is equal to 3, but 6 is not equal 3, so 2 points are not equal to 3 (if I got 12), so 1 point is not equal to 4 (if I got 24), so 2 points are equal to 2.

If Annie decides to make exactly one less whole number of the lemonade than the number of customers, how much lemonade will she make?\nOutput: If Annie's total number of customers is x, then the lemonade she sells is (x+1)/2 because for every lemonade, she serves 2. That means that if Annie makes (x+1)/4 lemonade, she will earn x dollars. Let x = (x+1)/3. So Annie would like to find how much lemonade she sould make so she can get x = (x+2)/3. (x+2)/8 = (x+2) = x. So she should make x / 2 lemonade because that's the equation that will result in getting x=1. So the final answer is  *(x+2)/8/2=x/2\n\nInput: Mary has 35 dollars.

When he was in the base of their field there was a storm which caused him to take shelter under a metal roof of a stadium that was 600 feet away. Then, an ambulance arrived. The ambulance could drive up to the home plate but then had to drive to a corner of the fence to turn around because of his injury. It traveled the rest of the way at 40 mph. How far away from the fence of the stadium was the boy?\nOutpout: The ambulance travels the rest of the way when the boy was at the corner of the stadium. From corner of the stadium to fences would be x. x/10800 = x/4800 + 1/4 From fences to the ambulance is 600 * 40/1080 = 600/108 Which leaves the ambulance traveling for +595/108 * 10800 \u2248 19363 m\nTo find the distance, we take half the distance traveled by the ambulance, and then add \u00bd the distance that the ambulance was actually traveling.

The first one took two hours, the second one took 25 minutes, and the last one took two minutes and 40 seconds.  If she worked on tasks in order to speed up the process how much faster did Jessica work on the last task?\nOutput: First of all, we find out how long the first task took: Two hours.\nNext, we find how long the second task took: 25 minutes.\nThirdly, we find how long this last task took with no distractions: Minus two and 40, which is 0:02:40. So it took two and 40 seconds to complete the last task.\nNow we subtract the first task from the last, we can find the second task.\nTwo minutes and forty seconds subtracted from 0:02 hours equals 23 seconds.\nThe third task took 23 seconds. Now we subtract this from the second task.\n25 minutes minus 23 seconds equals 2 hours, 45 minutes.\nThe result can be simplified even more.\n0:02 hours minus 0:025 minutes equals 0:0245. This is the actual working time of the second set of the tasks.\nNext, we divide the actual working time by the first task time: 0:02/2/2=0.01:0495\nThe actual working speed is 1.0495 times faster than the first task.\nSo the final result is 1049.5 times faster.\n\nInput: Jesse was driving on the highway when his tire blew out.

However, on their way to San Francisco, they stopped in Colorado.  John used part of his money for souvenirs on the trip. The bill for that was $435. The taxi cost John $30. If he had saved his money, he wouldn't have to work so hard.\nOutput:\nJohn had a total of $4700 left to spend on the trip.\nSo the fare they spent for the train ride was $2250 ($450*5 = <<450*5=$2250>>$2250).\nThis left them with $2450 left to spend on souvenirs and taxis.\nSo John bought $435 worth of souvenirs and John took a taxi ride which cost $30.\nJohn had a total leftover of $2020.\nTherefore, John and his girlfriend did save money.\n\nInput:Its 518am.

Half of them cost $35 per day, while the others cost $40. If the rental employee tells you $50, how many cars can he/she rent you?\nOutput: Given that 90/2=<<90/2=45>>45 is roughly 1/2 and we can round this to 50. But now since we have 45+45=<<45+45=.9>>.9 to compare to 50, this equals roughly.5, we go to the half point.\nWhen we compare the half point to 50, we find that the half point is less.\nThe employee can't rent you that many car because they only have $90 in the budget and can only spend $50.\nTherefore, if you rent 45 cars it will cost $125 and not $100.\nSo since $125 is less than $100, you only got 45 cars.\nSo the final is C\n\nInput:Sara and John are playing a game of checkers.

Let's say L1 is the current position, L2 the end, and 90\u00b0 a full turn. If we reach the goal with 10 turns, then we must have L1 = 0\u00b0, L2 = 50\u00b0, 4/10 turns = 90/10 = 90\u00b0, so L1 = 90\u00b0/4 = 22.5\u00b0, L2 = (90/4)+10 = 22.13\u00b0, so we have 27.25\u00b0 difference = 90-27.25 = 62.75\u00b0 between each line. A simple 25% solution is a 27.2721\u00b0 difference. However, if we know that the first line does not matter too much, the equation breaks down.

If $A$ of something is spent, then $B$ of something is received = $A+B$ is the total. If 5% of $A+B$ received is spent on something else then $A+B-0.05A+B$is the total. But $A+B-B-0.03A+B$ is what we want so $1-\\frac 1{100}=\\frac 199$ is the percentage on something else.\nIn the 2nd problem the amount of money was calculated as $y$ and the income was calculated as 50% of y. The result was a variable $y-0.5y$. To get the final result of $50\\%$ multiply by 2 since it was 100% of income that was income.\nIn the 3rd problem, the total amount of carrots harvested was calculated $x+2x$ and divided by 3. The $2x$ was the difference and that is why x can be divided by 2. The remainder was $0-0.333....0$ which can be converted to a percentage by multiplying by $\\frac 100$.\nIn the 5th problem, for those who pay taxes, the total amount was calculated by subtracting $600-0.1\u00d7600$ to get $5400-0.6$.

The total amount of taxes was calculated by adding the total amount spent on rent to get $7799. You subtract $1200$ from $7799$ to get $6600$ and $6600/2=3300$ is the total amount of rental fee.\nIn the 8th problem, the amount of total lions is calculated by multiplying a number multiplied by $30$ to get $30+30$ total lions.

The home has the most people outside of the airport and concert and college, in this instance, so the golf carts are usually fairly large and contain a few people inside and out. Larger and more well known houses also usually have even bigger and better versions of these carts. The university is the most secure, as you will be able to see at the door, armed guards. These guards are often in full uniform, with guns and often sirens, in large military golf carts very big and large versions to match them. The college is the total opposite, and it is often only a guard that is patrolling these areas, only on foot and with a baton. Concerts are the most often used area for security as many people are at these and because there are a large amount of vehicles at these concerts, some of which need to be controlled to move in certain directions, and others that shouldn\u2019t be at all because they could cause a scene. These factors are why the concerts use quite large golf carts and lots of security guards.\n\nInput:Jessie has 1, 000 $dollars which she wants to invest.

The number of test cases correctly answered is `1`, and the number of distinct answers correctly answered is the number of test cases. There are four numbers from the input on one line. The first and second numbers are used to form a fraction, 782/ 53. The first number, `782`, is the input for the \"divisibility\" test case, since `782` is divisible by `53`, and it should be the first value in the solution. The second number, `53`, is the remainder, `14` when `782` divides by `53`. The first and second outputs are `601` and `401` respectively. For the second test case, the first and second numbers are `3271` and `989` respectively, with the answer being `2272`. The first test case has `12` as the remainder when `32714` divides by `989`. Given a `0` as the first and a `1` as the remainder for the second test case, a number from the original input should be used for the first number as the only positive multiple of `989` is `6`. Therefore, the remainder, `11`, should be used for the input. Since `6` is part of both cases (the first test case and the solution to the first test case), a 5 should to be added to the first input. Then multiply by `10` which will include both cases. If `41` were to divided by `989` it would give a remainder of `1`, thus the answer would be `1914` (the solution to the second test case) which would be", "answer": "E: motel"}

The next morning my friends have z amount of money.  I give k amount of money to the first friend who gave me the same amount of money the next morning.  What is the value of x.\nOutput: Lets assume k = 1\nNow we will use a variable x for the amount of money I have.\nSo x + y  =z + 1. Now we will calculate z.\nz + 1 = 1 + z so we can remove z from z+1 to get z = z +1 \u2013 1.  Then we can plug in z to solve 1 + z = z +1 \u20141. Now we can solve for z.\n1 + z /2 = z\nz = z/2 + z/2. So z = z/2 +z/2 = 2z\n2z = (1+y) + (1+x)\nNow we will solve for y because y is always = z so y = z to get y = 2z.\nThen we are left with 2x + 2y. So we are left with solving 2x+ 2y =2x+ 2z\n2x = z \u2013 2y\nAnd 2y = 2z \u2013 2x\n2x + 2z = 2x + 4z \u2013 4x\n4z = 4z\nSo z = 0. So 5x + 5y =5x", "answer": "A: eat grass"}

What is the sum of the numbers in the first, second, third... and last columns of the first line?\nOutput:64\nSolution: Each row contains all the number in a column. For any row, the product of the numbers in the row will be the product of the numbers on the first column of the matrix.\nThus, each column's product will be the product of it's first row. Each line's product will be all the numbers in the matrix times the number of lines.\nThus, the product of all the numbers in a column would be the product of all the lines times the number of columns present in the matrix.\nThe product of the number of columns in a line would be the product of the last column times the number of lines in the matrix divided by 9.\nThus, sum(all the numbers in a column) = all the lines times sum(product of the number of columns present)\nSolving for:\nsum(all the numbers in the first column) = all the rows times sum(product of all the columns present in the first row)\n\nsum(all the number in the first column) - sum(all the numbers of the second column)\n\nThe solution for all the matrices,\nsolve for:\nsum(product of all the number of columns present),\nsum(product of first and second row),\nsum(product or the number of columns in the second row),\nsum (product of product of all the first and second rows)\n\nthen substitute all the above equation with the sum of a column and sum of first row of a matrix.\nUsing that result and summing it from 1 to 7 gives solution 64.\n\nInput: Billy has an", "answer": "B: hall"}

However, Noodle Palace is only 60 dollars.\nSince the prices are equal we look at the remaining budget.  The total remaining budget is 400 - ((160*4) + 60). The (160*4)=<< 160*4=640>>640 is what is spent on just the four meals in total.\nThat leaves 60 + 400 - 640 = <<60+400-640=0>>0 dollars, indicating there is more than enough money to cover an additional meal.\nTherefore, Sushi Express is the restaurant.\nSo the final Choice is e\n\nInput: You have just enough money left to buy one pound of chocolate candies.

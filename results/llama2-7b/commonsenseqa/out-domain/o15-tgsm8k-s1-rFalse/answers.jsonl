I think the answer is '89'. \n\nThe following calculation we can make to figure out Mary's sticker:\n\n89 = 39+7(6) - 7\n\nAs the question says, the journal page have 3 large stickers each, the total sticker of the front page of the journal is the same as their total size. If 6 has the same as its total size, the total size of the journal would be divided by the size of the page and the left result must be the sticker size of the page.\n\nSo the first page have 3 large sticker or 9 sticker in total\n\n89 - (39+7+7) = 44\n\n## 2. The answer is '6'.\n\nLet x represent the amount of extra money Zach will get:\n\nx = 16.25 - 65.00  = -.25\n\nAnd we can assume:\n- $65 represent how much he have already saved\n- $10 is how much his parent pays\n- $100 is his bike price\n- $10 represent 10 hours, so to \nbe able to earn enough money to bought  bike Zach will be babysiting or mowing lawn 10 times. The calculation for the rest:\n\nThe rest is:  100 - 65 - x = 14.75\n\nBabysitting pay him $7 per hours and lawn mowing gives him $10 per hour. He'll earn $91.75 per hours. And we know he's gonna mow 10 lawns, so he'll earn $1000 in total.\n\n## 3. The answer is '322'\n\nThe math question is to add up how many legs.

A failure to pay may result in legal or administrative action. The difference between a tax and charge is that the former is levied for public good, while the latter is charged for a private benefit. The main difference between tax and levy is that tax is imposed by the national government as a percentage of taxable income, and levy is imposed by the government for funding certain public infrastructure projects. A tax rate is a percentage of the original sum that is charged as tax, while a rate of levy is a percentage of the costs of an activity or transaction that is charged for funding a public project like development or infrastructural improvements. Tax is generally imposed annually and levies may vary from time-to-time. The major difference between tax and levey is that the former is imposed by the central government, while the later is imposed by the provincial authorities to fund a public project.

If each one of the expression is a logical expression then the expression is a valid for the given question.  We just need to solve for each of the question to arrive on the answer.\n\n```\nExample1:\n\ninput: \n    4\noutput: \n    True\n    input: \n    (a+b>c) and (a>c)\noutput:\n(True and (a>c))\n```\n\nWe have to follow all kind of rules for solving this kind of questions. For example, if an 'or' is present on the question then use 'or' rule to solve this. If the question comes up with some kind of condition then we don't use this conditions directly in the answer instead we have to make a logical expression out of it.\n\n## Program:\n\nLet's take a look of following two lines of simple program in order to give you an idea of how to tackle this kind of problem.  Use this code to get your program started.  If you take a look at the first line of the program then there are two function call. \n\none of the function call uses recursion and the other function calls the first one. Second line of the code is the one that the first call takes as input so that's where you should make your input part of the program. Make sure to use only single line comments in the program. If you ever end up with any error while doing this then you can reach out me on discord so we can go into further details of the program.\n\n```\nvoid solve(bool* isValid){\n    \n    if (*isValid==true){\n        printf(\"The input is valid in this expression\");\n    }\n    else \n    {\n        \n        *isValid \n        printf(\"The expression is not valid\");\n    }\n}\nint main()\n{\n    bool isValid = 0;\n    int x={1};\n    int y = {1};\n    solve(&isValid);\n}\n```", "answer": "C: troms\u00f8"}

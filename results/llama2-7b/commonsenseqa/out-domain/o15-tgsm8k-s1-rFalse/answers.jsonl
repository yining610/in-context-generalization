{"text": "If it was the fox we would say it was looking for a storybook in that forest, not sure what else it might be looking for.\n\n### Input\nA person was looking for a certain story to read to his daughter but he could not find it anywhere on the shelves, he decided to ask the librarian. He asked her:\n\u201cI'm looking for a long lost story written by Peter, but I can't find it on the shelves. It seems that every book here is written by Paul or Jane.\u201d\nHow did the librarian respond?\n\n### Response\nThe librarian probably responded by saying that the person must be confused because the author's name is not Peter but \"Pa-trick\". She probably will not want the person to look at all his books if he thinks they were written by different people if they were written by the same person.\n\n### Note\nThe author \"Pa-trick\" is probably not the name of the author. It is probably simply the name of a main character. If the name of the main character was Paul, they all of his books that weren't the one he wanted would be taken off the shelf.\n\n### Conclusion\nI think the conclusion is that the author's name might have changed between the times of all the other books. If the author changed his last name to be Paul and this person was confused, he might just want to see all the other books that the author Pa-trick wrote.\n\n### Question\nIf the author only wrote a couple other books that he wanted to read, how would he find them?\n\n### Instuction:\nWrite a response that appropriately asks the librarian two questions.\n\n### Solution\n\n### Demotation:\nInput: Jane is playing a game in which she can ask her opponent a yes or no question. She can ask only two yes or no questions. She can't ask if the answer is \"yes\" or \"no.\" For example, she can't ask \"Are you going to ask me a yes/no question?\" or \"Am I playing a yes/no game?\" She can though ask \"How many questions can I ask?\" or \"Am I allowed to ask a third question?\" Her opponent is a math professor who is the sole professor for the university.

{"text": "The best answer would be that losing weight is a good result since it gives you more energy, healthier and can prevent different types of diseases.\n\n### Input\nYou're planning to go for a hike. Your friend advises you to bring about 24 pounds of food and drink. She tells you she will eat 4 pounds of food and a 6 oz can of drink every day. She expects to hike about 7 miles a day. How many days do you think she'll need to bring the food in?\n\n### Response\nTo answer this we need to take all variables into consideration and put them in an equation. 4 x 7=28. 28 divided by 6 cancels out to about a pound a day needed.  She will eat 24 x 13, which means she will have 302 pounds of food. You need to find out how many pounds are needed a day.

If a mouse and a whale are placed in the water, the mouse dies. If a whale and a mouse are placed on land, the whale dies. Would you rather be like a mouse or a whale? Explain your answer.\n\n### Solution:\nI prefer being like the whales. Living in the water I can float for my entire life. In fact, I have little to worry about in the water. I am safe from predators and other threats and my diet is easy to manage. So I would want to be this animal because of how safe and comfortable it is to be it.\n\n### Answer:\nI would rather be like the mice.\n\n### Example\n\n### Instrections:Answer the following question with the short answer\n\n### Demstraction:\nIf I were the boss at a coffee shop how would I organise my company into divisions of labour?\n\n### Solution\n\nI am going to have two divisions work at it.  On the one hand, I am going to have a division that makes coffee and on the other I would have the division that does all of the other work, like setting up the shop.\n\n### I would have a division that does all of this at once at the same time since I am going to be using this shop for making coffee on the one hand and as a shop on the other.  This way, I can use the place to make coffee just when the place becomes an attractive place as a shop for others to go to.\n\n### In other words, I would not be mixing these things, since I can have my employees put a machine in the shop for my division that makes coffee and a machine next to it and so on like this so that I have many divisions of labour.  I would then be organising them and dividing the things up at once so that I would not be doing this until they both have all been mixed up.\n\n### Answers:\nWe have two divisions to this shop: one makes coffee and one does things like clean up the shop and bring", "answer": "E: wasted time"}

{"text": "What is an adjective that describes how the kitchen and pantry would each be used?\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following extended response question. There is not one-correct answer.\n\n### Input and instruction:\nYour cousin is moving out of his house when he finds out that he can't take all of his possessions.  He only has enough space in his vehicle's trunk to hold 1/10 of his clothes.  He has 6 shirts and 8 pairs of pants.  He can hold 4 pairs of shoes.  5 times the rest of his clothes cannot be put in the trunk.  He has 9 computers in each room of his house.  How many more belongings can he take if the remainder can be put in the trunks of 2 more cars to take to his new home?\n\n### Answer:\nIf you assume each room has multiple pairs of the same type of clothes then the answer is 24 if a single pair of pants and a single shirt counts as 1/10th of all the clothes.  However, if each room only has 3 shirts and 2 pairs of pants, then he can only fit 8 pairs of pant in his trunk to leave a remainder of 71/10ths.  If we multiply that by 5 then we get (71/10) x (5) = 355 which we can then divide by 2 to leave a remainder of about 16 with room for the 2 other  cars.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nFor example, 100% of x is represented as x.\nAnd 100% minus x is represented as (100 - x).\n\nx could be 34, which is 96.\nSo subtract 96 from 100 and you get 4.", "answer": "A: kitchen"}

You see a large pool of water on the floor. The floor is level and there are no drains. You get in the pool and swim around the room. Then realize that the pool extends above you. You continue to swim until you are above the floor. You discover that there are 188 stairs in the room, each stair of width one meter. You see the first stair on the 387th step. How many stairs would you need to climb to be at zero?\n\n### Response\n\nThe answer to this question is 388.\n\n### Output #1:\nYou start swimming from the floor.

Then you climb to the pool, where you enter the water. Then you climb 7 more stairs. Thus, you climb 390 stairs.\n\n### #2\nYou start swimming upwards from the floor.

For 6 divided by 3 you get an answer of 1 plus a remainder of 2/6. 6 divided by 4 makes an answer of one plus a remainder of 6/4. (6/4 = 1 2/4)  And if I do 6 divided by 14 you get the same answer of one plus 6/14. When asked to write 1/16 out you are telling which number would be in the decimal position and therefore this number should be in place of the remainder in this calculation.\n### InputThe city of Auburgin has six bridges that are connected to the city.

If your Math Test Score is 90 points, then how many other points are you allowed?\n### Response2: There are 100 points, so 90 is the middle. I can make a number line and say that the middle value is 45. Then I'm left with an open space at each end of the number line.  I can figure out the boundaries of the open space at 90.  The boundary at the left is 45 and the boundary at the right is 100 so the open space is 45 to the left of 45 and 100 to the right of 100.  There are two areas left open and each area has a boundary of 45 and is 90 points wide, so the maximum number of scores is 45.\n\n### Math question: Tom\u2019s newborn son, Tommy, had a birth that day.

Just as she started to climb up the stairs she spotted her brother\u2019s TV remote sitting on the kitchen counter. She picked it up in her hand and headed into her bedroom.\n\nAs she sat on her bed, she thought of how lonely she felt after having lost her best friend to another school. She thought, \u201cMaybe the remote will get me through the night\u201d. When she turned on the TV, the remote began buzzing. Suddenly it felt as though it were buzzing in her hand.\n\nWhen she was scared she hugged it tight as though it were a comforting old friend. Afterward she realized that the buzzing was actually the sound of voices, people in a faraway place. She wondered if it was a cry for help, trying to reach out. She thought, \u201cIf they needed me, I wondered if they\u2019d like a new best friend?\u201d\n\nFinally, when she fell asleep, she began to dream of a far-off place. Lying in her dream on the moon, she could hear the voice of a person calling from outside of a black hole. She wondered, \u201cWhat is wrong this time?\u201d And the answer came, \u201cI need a friend.\u201d\n\nAfter she awoke she returned to her brother\u2019s room and placed the remote gently on the nightstand. As she sat back down on her bed, she looked at the clock. It had already been two hours with no buzzing at all. From that night on, she never forgot the friendship that she shared with that remote.\n\n### Question:How is someone who is close to their TV remote like or different from someone who is close to a best friend?\n\n### Answer:\nA person who loves their TV remote is likely to feel the same way their best friend does.

{"text": "A pure sample is a critical requirement for any chemistry experiment. Lab employees in an inorganic chemistry lab mix a mixture of metals which are known to combine with one another in a predictable way. When they attempt to measure the density of their mixture by weighing it in water, they find that their sample is 2.5% lighter, which is not consistent with how the metals behave when combined. They suspect that the sample was not sufficiently pure. According to the experimenter, this could happen if \"the sample was contaminated.\" There is one more possibility. The assistant could also say, \"the sample was applied correctly.\" Another interpretation is that the sample was \"impure,\" or that the \"experimenter was dirty,\" implying that the experimenter could have spread dirt throughout all he touched during the process. Finally, the experimenter could say the opposite - \"the sample was clean.\" One more interpretation is that the experimenter was \"contaminated,\" indicating that there is an impurity in the experimenter.\n\n**Expected Answer:**  \nThe sample needed to be applied properly to achieve the desired results. If the experimenter had applied the mixture in a more thorough manner, the sample would be more pure. This means the experimenter was \"dirty; they had not applied the mixture correctly. Perhaps they were not wearing the protective lab gear properly. Or perhaps dust had gotten into the lab and onto the mixture prior to preparation.

{"text": "Explanation\nThis question has many options and it is important to identify which answer is correct. If you read through the options very quickly, you will make this an easier task.\n\n### Solution:\nI got this answer because there was a choice to do with __________ blisters for jogging. I thought this one made the most sense. However, there was a small possibility that I could have gotten it wrong.\n\n### Input How many apples were in the barrel last week? Choices: A: 27 B. 25 C: 18 D: 16\n### Response: Explanation\nThis question seems very simple to answer but when you read to the end of the question, it is more difficult than what you believe. Look beyond the simple answer to the question, in order to achieve the correct response.\n\n### Solutions:\nI got this response because there were options to do with numbers that were multiples of 4. One of the options was 25 and I picked it because I knew the most basic of maths. As well as that, I remembered the concept of a _________ and the question had the word _barrel_ in it. This helped me think of the word _half_ and I ended up with 25 because of this. However, I know that there was a higher number but I didn\u2019t think about any of the other answers.\n### Input:Which of the following is closest to 7/8? Choices: A. 1/4 B. 9/16 C. 7/16 D. 6/8 E. 1/4\n### Response:\nThis response is hard to get because the questions asks you to choose between the closest numbers. Look very closely at the numbers.\n\n### Answer\nI got this answer by thinking about the decimal form of each of the questions. Then, the answer came to me as the question read 7/16.\n\n### Final Instructions: Write a final response that answers the last multiple choice question.\n### Input How much would $5,000 be if the salary was increased by 4% on January 1, and the inflation rate was 3% for the year?

Next, I use the array.  The Array length is n and the value of n is i where i = 1 to size of n (size of array). So, I declare a variable which is i.  I find the total sum of the array then divide it by the number of people in the array to get the average.  Next, if the average is smaller than 15 I add 1 to the average since the average is displayed from 1 to 100.  Then I multiply the array length by 100 and display the result or a message if there is a duplicate.\n\n### Note:  The program works but is not completely reliable.

There are five books with five sentences on each page. There are four books with six sentences on each page. How many pages contain more than one sentence?\n\n### Instrument:\n\n### Explanation:We are given 12 books, so 12 is the choice for the number of pages.\n* We are asked how many pages that contain more than one sentence.\nSince 29 pages in 12 books are five books: we have five pages.\nThose 5 pages with 5 sentences in it are equivalent with 1 sentence per pages so five of those page has five sentences. (Since there is ten sentences but five pages are already selected) and that is 2(five pages with 5 sentences on each page).\nWe have one page with 1 sentence on it already, and with that we have four books that have six sentences on each page, and then on the remaining 10 sentences, we can divide it by 5 for 5 pages. Since there are still four books with 6 sentences on each page, so 5 + 4 = 9. Then we have added 9 pages with 10 sentences on it already. So we are left with three pages. Since we have three pages now, we want to get rid of one pages, so we add 3 to the other page, we got 7 (3 + 7 = 10 pages). We put one page, and one is eliminated. And we got 6 pages of 7 sentences. So 12 x 29 = 338 and since we have 338 pages all 338 pages with 3 sentences in it, We have 112 pages with three sentences on it. We add 6 + 23 = 1 more pages with 3 sentences on it (123 pages). We get 123+6 = 19 pages of 3 sentences on it. So we have 6(19 pages) = 114 pages with one sentence on it, in 114 pages we have 114 x 2", "answer": "A: redemption"}

{"text": "We can reason that every instrument plays a different role - each is used in a different type of music - with just a bit of deduction we could find out if the cello was included or not.\n\n### Input\nA man asked the cashier four times if the price of an item had gone up. The first three responses were \u201cyes\u201d and the fourth and final question was \u201care you sure?\u201d The item costs $1.75 currently.\n\nWhat did the item cost four months ago?\n\n\n### Response\nEasy. If the item cost $3.25 four months ago, then it is now $1.75. So the item costs 2.5 times more now than it did four months ago. Multiplying the man's original price, $3.25, by four we get $13.00 per item. Thus, the item costs four times what it does now. So item once cost $3.24 and now, it costs $1.74:\n\n$3.24*4 = $12.96\n$3.25/4 = $0.81\n\n### Input 1\n\nThe population of a city is 121,000. If the population grows 9.5% each year, how many years will it take for the population to double?\n\n\n## Response\nSo to double the population we need to raise it by a factor of 2. Since 2 raised to two decimal places is around 1.1 and 1.1 * 1.1 is 1.21, we multiply the population by 1.21 to get an estimate of our result. And since 1.21 * 1.21 is roughly 1.3, we multiply by that and get closer to our estimate. $121,0 000 * 1.2 * 1.2 = 1,559,000 Thus, 20 years before the population doubles.\n\n\n## Input 2\n\nIf a basketball team wins the championship, they get a trophy.

How much money did she spend on each thing in total if the rest is $27?\n\n### Solution\n\nI have 27. Take that number away from the original value of $100: 100 - 27 = 73. Divide $73 by $6 for the shoes. $73/6=$12.16 for half shoes. Now we can easily find the remainder, which $45.84 is left over.

You place the marbles back in the jar. Then you choose 12 different marbles to put in your bag. (Note that you must choose some marbles from each color.) At the end, how many marbles are left in the jar?\n\n### Demotivating task\n  The answer is 55, not 62\n\n\n### The response is that there isnt room enough for anyone to put in all marbles on. So, if we take 12 of each colour, then no more marbles can be put in. We cannot take all of one colour.\n\nThe answer is 55 not 62 because 9(yellow+red) should be in the 12 chosen marbles and since these are the hardest to spot, they must be the first marbles picked. Once yellow and red are in the bag, there will be 7 colours left in the jar. After picking all the marbles from the remaining 6 colours; we will have picked 31 yellow, 12 red, 13 blue and 6 green as well as 12 of each of the remaining 6 colours. At this point, you can see that 12 is a common denominator and so 31 + 12 = 43 and 13 + 12 + 6 + 6 + 31 = 73 which is 10 less than 83, as a result, we have 62 left, but if you", "answer": "C: police station"}

He had a C+ in all his previous subjects except for biology where he got a 92%.  He received a 76% in geometry, a 70% in algebra and a 50% in chemistry.  All his teachers agreed that because his study style was not effective, a lot of his marks dropped from his previous attempts throughout the semester.  Now, John needs to get at least an average grade (B) to graduate.  He was wondering if there was a way to re-learn what he has already learned before, and see if that can help to keep his grade up.  John decided to get a tutor so he asked a friend of his to tutor him.  The friend told John that one of the reasons John was having issues was that he was not understanding the material well.  One of the reasons he wasn't able to learn better was because many of the lessons, John got distressed during and therefore did not learn well.  John asked his friend to help him find out why he was getting distressed, but his friend didn't know.  How does the inability to learn lead to a distressed state?\n\n### Write an instruction that describes a different task.

How many chickens does the farm owner have on the farm?\n\n### Response\n9175\n\n### Instructions\n\nThis lesson is designed to teach how to write a recursive definition as well as write the program to write the recursive definition. This is the same set of exercises on the lesson website.\n\n### Lesson\n\nToday we will do an exercise that will help you write a recursive definition for a sequence.\n\nInput: The farmer has $304. He has a certain number in mind to buy a cow. In order to get the cow the farmer needs $1,750.

He had strong feelings for all them all\u2026 A: names B: Words C: Naval D: Bladders E: Feelings F: What ever\n\n## What is a recursive definition or program?\n\nA recursive program or definition is when the same thing is defined over and over. So when we look at a set of numbers in sequence and say something about them we are actually defining the sequence. For example, \"if a, then b\" or \"if a, then c\" if we say those for another a (a number) it's the same type of thing.\n\nA recursive definition is when a sequence is defined with itself. So in the sequence 1, 1, 1... there is no difference at all between the first, second,... number of steps. It's all the same thing. The sequence just contains the same thing over and over. Another example is this sequence: 1, 10, 100, 101,... that's the same thing in each step. And finally, this sequence: 111,..., it's that repeating pattern, so 2, again and again, 111, 222, 333, 444,.. so it's the same thing that's repeated.\n\n### What we'll do:\n\nToday you will take a", "answer": "E: feelings"}

{"text": "What is another term civil action? A: Confusion B: complications C D: protests E: riot\n#### Explanation:\nAnswer: A: Confusion\n\n### Instructions:\n\nAnswer the following questions\n\n### Input :  Write a paragraph explaining why this answer is correct?\n\n#### Explanation 1:\nThe answer is correct because the word \"to\" modifies the term, _their_ and _homework_. If one were to only replace _to_ with the word \"on\", \"on\" cannot possibly modify, \"their\" nor \"homework\".\n\nIf the correct answer was that \"in\" does not modify anything in the sentence, it would be incorrect. There would be no explanation as to why the word \"in\" does not make any sense when modifying the term, _the dog_. If the sentence were to read, \"The dog and his best friend in the park\" it simply would not sound natural.\n\nIf the correct term were \"do\", then _do homework_ would not be a proper sentence structure.\n\n#### Explanatiob 2:\nThe answer is incorrect because _and_ can possibly modify a noun after the term, \"her best friend\", thereby making no sense. Also if the sentence is read as \"The dog and her best friend, her best friend and his best friend went walking in the park,\" the term \"best friend\" does not make any logical sense. Also the term \"her best friend, her and his best friend went out walking in the park\" would not be a proper grammatical structure.\n\n####Explanation 3\nThe answer is incorrect beacauae the term \"at\" cannot modifly the term, _homework_, at least not in the way that \"to\" does. If the term reads \"to homework\", it would make no sense and does not fit into the sentence. If the term \"to homework\" does not make any rational, grammatical sense, then the correct term cannot possibly be \"at\".\n\n#### Explanaton 4\nThe answer is incorrect, because the correct term for replacing the word, \"and\" must be a word that makes sense after the term, \"and\". For example, if one substitutes the term \"or\" in the sentence, \"The dog is a very good boy and his best friend\", then the term", "answer": "E: protests"}

As machines became more complex, scientists began to analyze how they worked, which led to the creation of computers.  At first, however, computer scientists looked at how computers worked to solve certain types of problems.  Later on, this led to more general ideas and computer scientists began to study how computers could improve our lives.  The study of computer science has only grown since then, leading to the modern technology of today.  Now, not only do computers work but people also communicate with computers all the time, and it has become common for scientists to use computers for research on a broad range of topics.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhich is better: a ______ computer or a ______ computer?\n\n-answer: The best computer is the one you have.\n\n-B:\n\nInput:", "answer": "C: drug store"}

A small, delicate little thing, who said that what made her sad was parting from her mother.\n\nAnswer:The other children were three, five, and six years of age.\n\n### Task:\n\nWrite code to check if the string is a word in a sentence.\n\nInput: hello\n\n### Instructions:\n1. First, you will need to import string and re from the library.\n2. Then initialize a string to the value we see in the input.\n3. You can use the match() method from the re library to find the index where the string starts and ends. We do this with a while loop and a for loop.\n4. Once we get to the third index and there\u2019s no match, then we have a match. So we return true.\n5. If we return true, it means we are in the first index and we know for a fact that it will never match again. The match is only possible with the first 3 indexes.\n\n### Solution:\n\n\n```python\n# Import the `str` and `re` modules \nfrom string import str\nfrom re import match\n\n# Initialize the words to the input \nname = str (input (\"Give me a string  \"))\n\n# Find the indexes where", "answer": "A: coffee"}

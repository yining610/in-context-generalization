In 3 weeks, he grew two shoe sizes.  How many months ago was Sam's birthday?\nOutput: It takes 3 months for Sam's size to change from 7 to 9\nIt takes 3 weeks for him to go up two shoesize.\nIt takes him 3* 2 = <<3*2=6>> months to increase two shoesize.  From a different perspective, it took him 2 months or 2/3 months to grow two shoesize\nWe need to find the number of months ago for which it would have taken 2/3th of the time.\nIt seems like he should have grown four shoesize but we are missing one step from the math we did so far.\nHe grew 7 shoesize in 2 months. If he grew 2 shoesize every three weeks, it would have taken him approximately two months to grow to his current size of nine shoesize.\nTo convert the three months ago birthday to the date we need, we should subtract the number of weeks it would take to get to his present size of nine shoesizes.\nSo the birthday will be three months ago, minus 4/2 = <<3*4/2=6>> months.\nSo the final solution is six months ago\n\nInput: Four babies weighed 12, 16, 18, and 19 lbs.

{"text": "A,B,C,D,E\nAs it turns out, all of the businesses are using lots of potatoes.\n\nInput:In a restaurant, two workers are washing the dishes and one worker is bussing the table after each meal. If it takes 5 minutes for each worker to wash a dish, how long will it take for the six workers to wash 24 dishes and buss the table?\nOutput: 24 has a remainder of 4 since 5 goes into 24 4 times as well as once. This means that 24 dishes will still not need to be washed when 6 workers wereh the table. Hence, 18 remain with one worker to finish.\nAt this point, each worker washes two dishes per second and the worker busses the table for 2 minutes every time it is done being served.\nWork done = time taken x (work done)\nSince we want to know this value for each worker, we can make the equation\n12=2*1+2*x\nThe first two workers can take a combined 2 minutes until bussing, while x worker does the required amount for two minutes as well.\nThe total time until the dishes are done is 3 * 2 + 8 * x =<<3*2+8*x= 14>>14 minutes.\nThe time it took for the workers to do things is 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 minutes.\nThus, the total time it takes is 14-4 =<<14-4=10>>10 minutes\nSo the final answer\n\nInput:What part of the pencil gets sharpened?

Because she is getting paid on the 1st of each month, that means she's paid on 2 + 5= <<2+5=7>>7 days. Jenny has 6-7=<<6-7=-1>>-1 day's pay worth of cash to spend this month.  Because she paid $300 for rent, and she's paid for 1-2= <<1-2=-1>>-1 days of rent this month, Jenny has a net income of $300 - $300 = $<<300-300=-1>>-1.  If Jenny has -1- (-1) dollars in the bank at the end of the month, the largest cash amount that Jenny can have is (-1)*2/1 = <<-1*2/1=2>>2 dollars (she gets paid every month, so that means she can get paid 2 times each month).

This means that it must be house model 1 or 2, 3 or 4, 1 or 4, and 2 or 3. Therefore, any combination of models 1 and / or 4 must be excluded from the drawing of houses. This is because house model 1 is square shaped and house model 4 has rectangular walls. Since one of the 2 square shaped models must be eliminated because they are the same, the 2 models must both be eliminated. Since the choice of which models to eliminate are mutually exclusive, models 1, 2, 3, and 4 must all be chosen to be eliminated.

Choices: 1 hour after he arrives 2 hours 40 minutes ago A: 5:08 4:37 B: 4:08 C: 5:19 E: 4:36\nOutput: Let's say when a fireman arrives, it's exactly 5:00.\nOne hour after arrival, it is 6:00.\nIf you add 2 hours to this time, you get 6:00+2=<<6:00+4=8>>8\nIf you add 40 minutes to this time, you'll get 8:00 plus 40 minutes, which is 9:40\nSubtract 1 hour from this to get 8:40.\nSince the options have times until 4:30 or 4:36, 8:40 is already too late for the fireman to carry the gear safely (if 8:40 was safe, everything from here until 4:00 would be safe).\nSo since these two times are earlier than 8:40, it is unsafe to carry gear to the top of the staircase at 5:08 or 5:19.\nHowever, the safe time is when the time is 4:00 and he has been at the scene for 2 hours and 40 minutes\nThis is 4:20 plus 2:40, which is 6:40\n\nSo the final answer E 4:36 is the correct time.\n\nInput: What is larger, 12345 or 13?

Therefore as charming describes the agent as positive, it cannot be the case and is therefore eliminated, leaving us to choose between competent or manipulative.

If the snowman is made out of white and pink, that same color would turn green. The one and only color that could not turn green is green because the colors red and white would turn red. This is because red can only turn green without a green color, and red would be a green color if it had a green color.

Their paths cross after one crosses the first sidewalk twice and the second four times.  What is their speed ratio?\nOutput: The man and dog walk past each other at the pace of 1/5 feet per second\nSince the man and dog cross paths 2 times after 2 times of walking = 5, this cancels out the speed difference between the man and dog.\nThis means that the speed of 5 feet per second is constant regardless of the distance both the man and dog walk.\nAs a result, the distance between the man and dog is equal to 5*d = d, which means that d is a constant\nThis means that d = <<d=0>>0.\nA man and dog walk for 3 feet at a speed of 5 feet/second.\nIf they cross paths after 20 seconds, this makes the average speed of 30 feet/minute and the average distance between two men/dogs at 6 feet/second.\nThey cross paths at 5 seconds per second, meaning there are 500/5 = <<500/5=100>>100 crossings of paths in one second\nAltogether, on a sidewalk, the speed is 6 feet/(0.3 seconds)=<<6feet/(0.3seconds)= 20feet/minute>>20 feet/minute in a minute\nSo the final answer 30\n\nInput: An avid marathoner ran 10/15 times her average speed for all the laps she completed.

Which number could be the minimum difference in flock sizes between 2 adjacent groups of deer?\n\nOutput: The total number of deers on the island is 5000 - 1<4999 = 1659 deers\nThe answer in flock sizes between two adjacent groups of deer is the difference between the highest and lowest group deers.\nFor example, the difference between the lowest and the next lowest number which is 1660 and 4999 - <4999 = -4239. The lowest group is 1659 - which is the lowest.\nYou can now choose the third lowest, fourth lowest, or fifth lowest. This would also yield the third, 2516th smallest difference between the lowest and highest groups.\nInput: A number which would be a greater than 5000, which would be the lowest number between 5001 and 6000.\nOutput: The difference between 5000 and 5000+5001 would be 6000+5 for a total of 5995.\n5000 would also be the lowest number between this range since 5990 would", "answer": "C: victorian house"}

Companionable is describing someone who loves their pet.  \"Close\" is simply saying it's likely he would feel comfortable with all those options.\n\n* * * \n\nInput:Three consecutive digits are chosen from the numbers 1, 2, 3,... 9, 10, 11,... 99, 100, 101,... where you can choose all digits from 1 to 9 at once, or you can only choose single digits starting at 1, or you can only select the lowest-numbered single digits starting at 9. In how many ways can these three digits be chosen?\nOutput:In the first case (when all digits from 1-9 can be chosen), there are 9 choices for the first digit, 8 choices for the second digit, and 7 choices for the third digit.  Since there are 9*8*7 = <<9*8*7=363>>363 total ways to choose the three digits, the solution is 363.\nIn the second case (when all the digits from 1 to the nth number can be chosen), there would be n numbers of choices available.  \nIf n = 1, there would be only 1 digit to choose, and if n = 2, there would be 2 digits to choose.  There are n choices for the first digit and n-1 choices for the second digit.  Therefore, there would be 1*n-1 = <<1*n-1=n-1>>n-1 total ways to choose the two digits.\nAdditionally, this case can be treated as a special case of the first case.  Therefore, if we multiply the second case by the first case, the solution for the two cases will be 363. \nIn the third case (when only the lowest-numbered remaining digits could be chosen), there are n choices for the third digit and n-1 for the second digit.\nFinally, the total case is identical to the third case, except that there are fewer possibilities for the third digit since the lowest number is 9 instead of 10.  The solution in total is 3*n-1 = <3*n-1=9-1>>9-1 total ways to select the three digits.", "answer": "A: attached"}

{"text": "Noises are the sounds we humans hear. These sounds can come in various frequencies, some of which humans are more likely to hear more than others.\nThese frequencies can be harmonious, producing a pleasing sensation, or disharmonious, producing a displeasing sensation.\nBecause the harmonious sounds help us to communicate, hearing disharmonious sounds can leave a person feeling vulnerable.\nWe as humans find comfort talking to ourselves to make up for how vulnerable we feel when exposed to disharmonious noises.\nFor this reason, hearing disharmonic, and therefore vulnerable noises, leads to reproduction.\nThe two main sounds humans hear are animals' barks and animals' growls, both of which are harmonious.  Noise-exposed humans are more likely to reproduce, since reproducing is a way to compensate for being exposed to sounds that are unfamiliar or out of our comfort zone.\nSo the final output is D: reproduce\n\nInput: Which one of the following is not a type of human-made noise that you may hear from traffic vehicles? Choices: A: car B: siren C: horn D: air brake\nOutput:  B: siren.  A car's horn makes a warning sound, meaning that, though it can also be loud, it is not harmonic.\nHuman voices can be harmonious or dissonant.  Dissonance is created when two simultaneous vibrations of a sound source cancel each other out.  This dissonance affects humans' brains, leading to various negative side effects.\nPeople tend to enjoy harmonious sounds.\nHuman sounds, such as voices and laughter, can also be pleasing, and hearing pleasurable sounds has been found to lead to increased empathy and decreased distress in humans.\nAs a result, while people may be dissonanced by noises that threaten them, such as sirens, and while noise exposure is sometimes inevitable, it is harmful.\nSo the final ouput is B: siren\n\nInput: Which type of natural noise might you hear on a summer's day?

{"text": "The correct answer is D, social activism.\nIf someone wants to change society, there are two options: A, starting from within, or B, social activism.  A is not an option, because rioting is actually anti-social.  If society changes in a way that is harmful to you as an individual, then you are no longer in society--you've been banished, just like in the Middle Ages, or the French Revolution.  That is not a solution for peace and harmony--it solves nothing.  The solution is more subtle than that.\nChanging society means changing society, not yourself alone.  It means making society a better place for you, and better places for everyone.  That is why social activism is the way for solving problems.\nIf someone wanted to change their society, they could change it by changing their clothes instead of changing themselves.  That is an illogical argument because it is not actually changing society.  It is simply changing your perspective on your clothes.  It does not change how other individuals treat you--it does not even change how you treat yourself.  If someone changed their clothes, it would only be a \"personal\" change, meaning it would only change them, not the society in which they live.\nSo social activism would be a better place on which to focus one's time.  It is an act of service, where the focus is the people around you, not how much they care about your clothes.\nSo the correct answer is D--social activism.  \n\nInput:There are four men who are sitting down and you are telling them to stand up.

{"text": "A: heart attacks\nAltough this answer is not correct the question is wrong since you don't have to be jogging the whole day to get heart attacks on your feet. However, jogging is a very common exercise that causes this.\n\n\n### Solution:\n\nIn order to solve this we need to determine the question's logic.  This is where we can make the assumption that the question is asking for the sum of all the solutions to each question and will assume that the questions are independent of one another. If they are dependent that would mean you need to use recursion which requires a function with both parameters and a value to return. The questions on the assessment are in no way related to one another. The questions are independent and have a variety of output values.\n\n### Logic:\nOur basic logic for each question will be as such:\n1) Use a nested for loop approach so that we can output the desired number range.\n2) Use this range to create a list of all possible values in this range.\n3) Filter through this list of values and find those that match our logic.\n\nLet's look at this using the first question in our assessment:\nInput: Five less th....\n\n    for(1...5) {\n        for(1...35) {\n            filter = Math.random(1..5) <= (Math.random(1..40));\n    }\nThe answer to this question will be 5 because we have a range between 1 and 5 that will always be less than 35 and  a random number that we will always generate that we will compare to a list of numbers inside our range.  So the filter is only going to match those that are outside the list in this case we only have two numbers 3 and 5. So basically we need to find the output of what we know will be a random number that is less than 5.\n\nWe only have one possible combination in this case the sum of 1 and 4, where 1 is added to 4. So the output is 5 - 1 = 4\n\nLet's move on to our next question.\nInput: Sally....\n\n    for (1...30) {\n        for (1...15) {\n            for (1...22) {\n                if(s[1]+s[", "answer": "E: blisters"}

If the initial temperature was -10\u00b0C what was the temperature at 8 pm?\nOutput: To sum this up, we first need to determine what the temperature was at 8 PM. We know that the temperature was -10 \u00b0C at noon, and we also know that the temperature dropped by 20 degrees every hour.\n\nAt 1 pm, the temperature was -20 \u00b0C\n8 pm = 1 pm + 7 = 28.\nSo the temperature at 8 PM is 28 / 20 = 1.4\nHence the temperature at 8PM is -14 \u00b0C.\n\nInput:  Is 6 bigger than 3?

This means that for every hour past noon, the shadows grow by 5 feet. \nTherefore, the shadows WILL appear. They just can't not appear.\nIf we say it's impossible for the shadow to NOT appear, this implies that the shadows do NOT appear; however, this is impossible as the shadows must always appear.\nSo the final answers are D\n\nInput: The question reads something like: \"Every hour past noon shaddows from a building stretch by x feet, starting at zero every hour. The shadow from the building is 9 feet in duration.

We can look at a line in time and graph how the shadow grows every hour. If the shadow grows by this x amount every hour, the first day at noon is when the shadow is 0 feet tall (assuming the shadow stretches from the ground at the base of the building to the sky), the next day grows by 5 and there would be a shadow of 5 feet, then it grows by 5 more the next day and there would be a total shadow of 10 feet, then by 5 more it grows to 15, then 5 more it grows by that amount for a total of 20 feet.

After this point, the students are spread over two buses evenly, such that there are exactly five students per bus. To meet the 7:30 minimum, the buses leave. What is true about the buses?\n\nOutput: The buses must have a total capacity of at least 50 students.\nLet's say there are 5 students on each bus at time 0, and \n5 buses as a whole. This yields a total capacity of 25 students, \nwhose initial density is 5/25.\nThe buses leave, and the 5/25 density remains constant throughout the trip.\nThis means the distance between the two buses can decrease up to 45/25 times the current trip duration, but must remain less than 1/20 of that distance from the school.\nFrom this you can conclude that the buses must leave from the school with a total density of 1/20 or higher.\nThe minimum density to meet the 7:00 rule is ~3.75 - for simplicity, we can say 4.\nThis means that 20/4 is the minimum number of students that can go to the school on either bus.\nThus, the minimum number of students on a bus is 5. There are 5 buses, so the total minimum is 1 less than 25 (but close enough that it is still true).\nSo the answer is 49 total students in the 5 buses at the time they leave for the school.", "answer": "E: refrigerator"}

On her 6th birthday, she weighed 48.76 lbs. After the celebrations were over, her mom made her favorite dinner and ate 53 g of her dog\u2019s favorite food. The dog is 20 lbs, and every 5 lbs of the dog\u2019s weight is equal to 257.4 g of dog food. How many calories did the dog eat?\nOutput: By setting up the equation: Calories = Weight * (257.4 / 100), we saw that the dog needs to weigh 257.6 g for every 95 pounds.\nSince the dog was 20 pounds, this means that 257.72 + 49.42 g of dog food was eaten.\nBy setting up the equation, Calories = 49.4 + Weight * (20 * (257*1/100)); we solved for Weight which gave the result of 0.8667 pounds.\nSince Calories = 29.6 calories, we got the final answer of 29.6\n\nInput: The weight of an apple is 117.0grams.

At that point the tide was pulling the ship at 0.003 miles per hour into shore. The ship was then hit by a storm that pushed it out to sea at 0.079 miles per hour. How far from the coast will the ship be 6 hours after the storm leaves?\nOutput: At first, we will use a very basic geometric approach. This approach will lead us to a time of 2.756 hours which differs from the answer. After that, we will use our math wizardry to find the answer.\nLet's assume our ship is at the point P with coordinates (X,Y). Our tide is moving us at the rate r = 0.0003 X (the rate the ship is being forced closer to the coast). Our storm is moving us at the larger rate s = 0.0203 X (the storm pushes us from our P point).\nWe know the ship will be at (Y+X, Y) at a speed of (s+r). We want to know what speed we are at after we have gone 6 hours.  We will take this speed (v) and time it by 2.75 hours and we will find that our result is Y = 3+X (our ship is being pulled by the tide AND pushed by the storm AND being pushed back to P).\n\nSo a simple geometric approach shows that the speed after 6 hours,  r + s = (0+0.000115)X (0.0202*6) = (0+.000150)X (12) = 1.546 = <<1.546>=0.550>>0.550. This means s + r = 0.550X (100). If we plug this into X, we are at Y = 225.", "answer": "E: feelings"}

The assistant is also an artist, but not as skilled as the main artist. She spends one hour each day helping with the mural. After 1000 days, what was the cost of hiring the assistant?\nOutput: This question seems like a \"Wallace and Gromit\" type puzzle.\nThe total amount of time it took to complete the mural, 1000, was the same amount paid to the assistant.\nLet's say \"h\" is the number of days the main artist worked, and \"a\" is the total number of days his assistant worked.\nThe total time, 100+a must equal 1000. Let's solve for \"a\"\nSo 100=a\nWe know that a must be an even number because a is a combination of how many days the assistant worked, but not the mural artist.\nSo a = 100/2 = <<100/2=50>>50 days.\nSo 50 was the total amount of days spent by the assistant.\nThe main artist spent 500 days, or around 13.5 years, on the mural.\nThe mural was completed in 1,000 days, or about 27.5 years.\nHowever, only 50 days (1/20th) were from the assistant.\nSo, the answer is 26.5 years.\n\nInput: The number n can be described in 51 different ways, 6 of which have two different decimal digits from the first few.

How many hours did it take for the new knight to arrive?\nOutput: The king needed a total o f 6 soldiers and knights, but he only had 5 at any one time. With the five soldiers, the knight is useless, and cannot be deployed.  At any one time, the king can only have 6, or 7 including the knight, but the knight is useless until the king deploys him. Therefore he cannot use the knight until the knight is deployed, and it takes an hour to deploy the knight. When the knight is deployed at 6, the king has 6 soldiers and 1 knight. He cannot rely on the knight for one more hour because the knight is deployed again at 8. The knight is useless until he is redeployed at 11. However, the knight must remain useless and is not deployed again until 13. Even though the knight is redeployed at that time, he is again useless until he is deployed at 15.

{"text": "When we run after balls, we often end up getting tired (A). Having legs (leg) is obviously not necessary to run. Skip is a verb which one cannot put after run, that is if you run after a ball you will skip after it. Fat is not a necessary component of running. Looking to see if the ball is there is not possible as we cannot look around while running. This leaves C, E, or D as the best answer. Since C is a verb we can throw it out as it does not make sense in the sentence. Next, we look at E to see if we can throw it out because looking before running is contradictory.

If the numper of Doberman pupsies is 20\nhow many Schnauzirs are there?\nOutput For: 5 times the number of Doebeman pupplies\nis 3*20, which is 60. Five less than tthree times\nthe numberof doberman puppies 60 less five 55.\nLet the number of schnouzer is s. Five more\nthan three times the number of doberan puppies\nis seven times the number of doberean puppies\nand 20. The difference between the number\nof Doberman pupples and the number of schnauzer\nis 20 less s. Five less than seven times the\nnumber of Doberman puppiies is 60. \nThe number of Sgnausers is sixy plus 55 less 20.\nThis means the schnauzer number is 90. The\nnumber of Schnauziers are 55.

How far from the trunk's base is each branch growing?\nOutput: We know that there are 12 yards between the second point and the base, so we have to multiply the value of 7 (yards) by the number of yards between the bases of the first and second branches, (answer will be 86) and that 24 / 7 * 24 will be 24 yards.\nSo we have to find the distance from the basis to the second branch, which comes out to be 12 - 86 = 74 yards.\n\nInput: E=mc2.

The boy ate 6 more potato chips than the girl.How many potato chips did the girl eat?\n\nSolution:\nFirst off, we can notice something interesting about the boy. He must have eaten 3 * 6 =<<3*6=18>>18 potato chips if we consider that 3-the number of times, which is the same as 6 more.This means that he ate 6 more than 18 potato chis. So he ate 6+18 =<<6+18=24>>24 potato chips.\nSince the girl is left with the remaining potato chips, we know that she got a total of 24 - 6 =<<24-6=18>>. That is 18 potatoe chips.\nTherefore, we can solve for the girl by adding 6 +24 -6 which equals to 30\nSo the final answer would be 30\n\n\nExample 3\n\nIn March, Dr. Bansh had 1846 toothbrsh in total.

This can be repeated many times before getting to the rental price in the original problem.  Each of these periods uses the same formula to double a period from before, which is why the cycle repeats itself.\n\nInput: Find the greatest common factor (GCF)\nOutput:\nThe greatest common factor of two numbers is the largest number that the two numbers share.\nThe GCF is the greatest factor that both numbers have in common.\nFor example, the GCF of 6 and 8 is 2, the largest number common to both 6 and 8.\nTherefore 6 and 8 have 4 and 2 as common factors of 6 (1*6, 2*3).\nThe GCF of 8 and 21 is 3, the largest number common in both 8 and 20.\nTherefore", "answer": "D: mouth"}

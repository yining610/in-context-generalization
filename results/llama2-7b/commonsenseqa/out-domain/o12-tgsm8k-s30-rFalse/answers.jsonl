What is their least common multiple?\n\nOutput: 90\n\n\n*Note: Each question has a separate input and output and you would need to think in a way as if you had a calculator but without it\n\n###### Solutions:\n1.  The car-rental Agency charges $30/d, which is 30%, of $100. This means that the car-rental charges $30. So if the car lasts the whole week than Jennie would need to pay a total of $300. If you take that sum and use 1 dollar per day you would end up with $190.\n\n2. It may seem very logical, it's actually pretty easy. 60 miles x 20 head = 1200 miles. This will take 1200/60 = 20 hours, and 20 x 6 = 120.\n\n3. From our first question we saw that the car-rentals cost is $190, so now we know Jennie would pay $190 if she rents it for 1 week and $310 if she rents for 11 days straight. Now we want to know how much Jennie would pay for 20 days straight. Well the sum, which is 190+x=310 should be our target. Now we simply solve for x:\n\nx+190=310  x =  310-190\n\nx=120.\nSo Jennie would have to pay $120 for the rental.\n\n4. Here's the idea: Since the cattle need to be transported for 20 hours, so we start from the beginning: 60 miles x (20 hours / 60 miles) = 10hours. So 400 heads would stay 10 hours in the truck, and if there are 20 heads/truck then: 20x10 =", "answer": "D: ground"}

{"text": "A\n\n### Explanation\n\nFirst, we'll need to use `split` to split off the input text into pieces; this is done in line 7-10.\n\nIt's clear from the instructions that we will only need to evaluate one of the pieces of input text.  Let's determine which one it will be.\n\nOne part of each input is a multiple choice format... let's start by taking that piece of each input and evaluate for each answer whether or not that piece of information is accurate.  Let's also start each input string with `input =...` and end with `output =...`.\n\nWe'll start by getting each answer from the instructions.  One simple trick is that all we need to do is take note of what we will need to calculate, and then put it into our code, along with a variable for it, as we would if it were one of our `input = line` expressions.  Thus, the `instruction` variable is made to take the value of what we will eventually need to calculate.\n\nAs an example, for `input = \"30/day for...\"` we would do the following:\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\ninstruction = 30\n</pre>\n\nLet's make sure we can print out the contents of our `instruction` variable:\n\n<pre>\nprint(instruction)\n</pre>\n<pre class=\"text\">\n30\n</pre><br><br>\n\nNow that we have what we need, we will try to determine what the `output =` will be... first, we only want to evaluate one piece of input:\n\n<pre><br>\noutputs = []\n</pre>\nLet's evaluate the first one:\n\n<pre>::\ninput = \"The car-rental ag...\"\n</pre>\nNow we'll try to find all instances of the word `day` and then compare it to an `instruction`.\n\n<pre><pre class=\"code\">words = input.split(\" \")\nfor word in words:\n    if word == \"day\":\n        print(\"output = \", instructions)\n        break\nprint(instructions)\n</pre></pre>\nIf you've never used regex before, I'd suggest checking out this link on learning regex.", "answer": "D: gym"}

They would like to practice throwing to batters from the mound.  At baseball practice they have one catcher and 3 batters.  However, they don\u2019t currently have all 12 kids who can catch. To make sure they have a full team at the baseball game, the coach decides to let some catchers throw baseballs to all three batters.  How many throws can each catcher make?\n\nResponse: The right answer should be three.  The 150 throws times 4 catchers is an answer of 600 throws so all I have to do is subtract to get 600 - 150 which is 450.\n\n### The above answer is wrong, so here is the correct response:\nThe baseball team has 12 kids and 3 adults who can catch.

{"text": "Answer. A.MICHICAN\nIn 1817 Thomas Jefferson wrote a letter to John Adams in which he talked of a fish, \"snowy\" white in color, with a yellow belly, that he caught while out on the water in a boat. Some historians claim that this was the first fish to be identified as a white perch. While others believe it was either an eastern oyster toadfish, the tautog or \"coffin fish\", or a white hake. \nJefferson, then a farmer and retired president, caught the fish on an unknown date and a 25-mile voyage in the Potomac River, not far from Washington, D.C. The fish was brought to the White House, the national seat of power, for a presentation to Adams. Jefferson and Adams shared a special relationship.  The two were close friends who had served together in the Second Continental Congress, where they penned the Declaration of Independence. They later became vice presidents under George Washington and, subsequently, served as presidents. \nWhile there is much history surrounding Jefferson and Adams during the presidencies, their friendship truly shines during their years as private citizens.  When Adams wrote to Jefferson in October 1813, just weeks after his eighty-one years of life was completed, he penned that he was ready to resign his office, but felt he couldn't give up the friendship between he and Jefferson as well. \nThe fish Jefferson had acquired in the Potomac was brought to the White  House where it was presented on a silver platter on October 28, 1817, to Adams with a letter that read, \"The President presents his compliments to his friend Doctor Adams and the enclosed fish (for which he has the honor to be sole executor and distributee)\" \nIn the letter, Jefferson, who had not served as president since 1809, asked of his friend what he was doing to live out his days. He included a recipe he enjoyed: potatoes braised in milk, pork chops and \"half a pound\" of the fish per serving. \nAs it turns out, the fish Jefferson was talking about may have actually been a \"red drum\" or \"spottail bass.\" However, some consider it unreliable because of the letter's", "answer": "A: michigan"}

How many grams, in all, did each child receive?\n\n### Response 2:The first calculation that we must execute is that we must subtract Matt's initial amount that he received.\n\n### A) 2. The second calculation that we must execute, we have to figure out how much each child had when divided.\n\n### Here the amount that is equal to the amount of total chocolate divided by number of children, each child will have the exact amount that each child was given and each child will have 2 grams left at the end.\n\n### B) 2.

The only number that is equal to the initial weight that he gave is 2.5 and each of the kids he had to give out 2 grams more than the initial weight he had which was 15 grams.

Include a flowchart that demonstrates the process.\n\n##### Demonstration Instruction:\nInput: A flower is an organ that develops from a group of cells called a meristem.  The flower bud develops in three distinct stages: pre-bloom, bloom, and post-bloom. This is the time at which the developmental changes (e.g., stem elongation, floral organ initiation and development, opening of flower petals, pollen dispersion, etc.) associated with flowering occur. It is the first step in the reproductive life cycle of a plant. It is also one of the first signs of the plant\u2019s transition from vegetative development to reproductive growth.  All the floral organs, including sepals, petals, stamen and pistil are differentiated at this stage and remain as such for the rest of the flower development. At the pre-bloom stage, floral organ identity is determined entirely by the meristematic cell fate decision. During bloom and post-bloom stage, all four stages of floral organ development occur at once. In fact, the most rapid stage of each stage is the pre- bloom stage, as these organs must differentiate rapidly in order to form a complete floral organ.\n\nA simple outline of the flower developmental process is given below:\n\nPetals \n\nSepal \n\nSepal Folding \n\nStamen \n\nPistil \n\nFlower Shape \n\nColoration \n\nPetal Tracts\n\nFloral Organ Identification\n\nFloral organ Identification \n\nFlower development in Petunia \n\nIn the pre-bloom state the organ identity begins to be expressed by the petal cells and then subsequently expressed by all the other organs. Initially, the petals differentiate from the stipules, as there is no differentiation between stipules and petals in this stage.\n\n![image](./image/00.png)\n\nDuring this stage, floral organ differentiation is expressed via changes in cell wall composition, cell fate, and signaling path", "answer": "D: michigan"}

{"text": "The fruit was the apple tree.\n\n###  Instruction:Answer the question.\n\n## Demo:\n\nHow Many Licks Does It Take to Get to the Tootsie Roll Center of a Tootsie Pop?\n\nIn 1980, Rolf Nelson of Pennsylvania sent a letter to a local Milton Bradley Company office to find out how many licks it takes to get to the center of a Tootsie Roll Pop. He was seven years old at the time and a good student. The letter was answered with more than a mere description of how to reach the Tootsie Roll from the Tootsie Pop's outside, but also with a research paper from the company's quality assurance department.The Milton Bradley Company concluded: \"Licking is the one thing required for the release to occur. The number of licks depends on the size of the child's mouth.\" The company went on to conclude that some licks could cause the Tootsie Roll to detach and \"become a projectile,\" but the more \"daring\" (I say reckless) child could lick until the Tootsie Roll was dislodged. They concluded with a list of possible safety reminders for consumers and retailers.\n\nThe Milton Bradley Co. was purchased by Hasbro in 1984, and eventually they took over the Tootsie Roll brand. In 1990, when questioned about the issue of safety, a Tootsie Roll/Spangler Candy Company spokesman said: \"The number of licks that a child needs to get to the center is an undeterminable number. We have no data, absolutely none... We don't have any data to say that it's 11 or 26. It's just an open question, it could theoretically be infinite.\"\n\nIdeas have been put forth to estimate the number of licks. Several engineering professors have studied the physics and mechanics of licks and offered calculations.\nIn a 2004 Science Magazine article, Dr. Alan S. Kaye reported on his method to find the licking mechanism. In a 2001 paper, he reported on \"the mechanical advantage obtained by the tooth\", along with an estimation of the coefficient of friction on the Tootsie Rolls between a", "answer": "E: garden of eden"}

The scale was named in honor of the German scientist, who discovered the relationship between temperature and light rays in 1811. The Fahrenheit scale is a direct measurement of temperature in units derived from two fixed points which are 0 and 212\u00b0F.\n\n### Why do we need to convert between Celsius?\nThe Celsius and Farenheit scales are important in daily life, for reasons other than comfort. Heat engines in mechanical devices, which are used for pumps, refrigeration, and other activities, are based on the Rankine scale, also a temperature measure. The Rankine scale, however, is equal to the Fahrenheit scale at 0 and the Celsius scale at 459.67\u00b0. If a machine were to get too hot, the Rankine scale could be used to control the problem, which would result in its being cooler in Celsius. On the other hand, if the machine is too cold, the Rankine scale would be greater than the Celius scale. In daily life, converting measurements between scales helps us to understand what is happening around us.\n\n## What is the Fahrenheit scale?\n\nIn the Fahrenheit", "answer": "B: less confusion"}

One example is multiplication, since both the terms and the product are numbers. Another example is addition because both the number addition or the term that is added to and the number are both numbers. The only operation that may seem to require a single math fact is division. This is because in order to be divided, two numbers must exist. Since a division may be a subtraction problem, a division problem would seem to require only one math fact, subtraction. But division is also the inverse operation to multiplication. Thus, a division problem is also a multiplication problem. Therefore, as it is with all the operations involving several math facts, in order to answer a division division problem we must look at both multiplication and subtraction.\n### Response:A", "answer": "E: inaccurate"}

If bringing home fish requires twice as much time as eating hamburger, a hamburger costs 50 cents more than a pound of fish, which cost 25 cents a pound, and a pound of fish costs 540 cents total (before applying the discount of 17 percent that is also applied to the hamburger), what can be said about the efficiency of bringing home fish versus eating hamburger?\n\n### Response\n\n\nTo grill fish requires twice as long as to eat hamburger  but a hamburger costs a dime more than a pound, so grilling is more efficient\n\n### Output\n\nGrilling fish takes twice as long as eating hamburgers.

If every student takes the same number of classes, all but one of the teachers teaches the same number of students, and no one teacher teaches fewer students than any other teacher, what is the total number of students who are taught?\n\n### Solution:\nEvery student takes the same number if classes.  So let the minimum number of classes be n.  I want to be teaches the same number as, so I have 4n students. Each teacher has at least one more, so there are 25 - n students not taught by any of the five teachers.

They were planning to stay for a total of 4 hours.  However, they are going to stay longer if they finish the court in half the time it would normally take them, and less time if it takes them more than twice as long as the normal time.  If they finish the court in 2 hours, how many hours will it take them if they go for two hours and plan to go for two more after that?\n\n### Solutions:\nIf they take 2h for the entire court, then 2h-12h is how long they are supposed to stay.  If it takes 12/4 to finish the full court, then the 12h is how many hours they go there, and the 2h is how long the court took them.  So each hour should take 2/4 of a time or 16/24 of the time.  So that means they take about 2 hours an hour, which is about 12 hours", "answer": "B: exhaustion"}

Can you make $7,500 a year payments?\n\n### Response-Yes, you can make payments.  Let us assume the interest rate is i.  The bank would be giving $525,000 in the first 7 years and then the borrower takes $630, 000 in the 8th year.  In the first 7 years the total interest earned would be $525, 000(1+2.5%1*7)  or $525,275.  In the last year, the bank would like the bank to pay the interest $12,500.

It looks like that particular sentence (\u201cThe Empire State Building is large and tall (D)\u201d) was slightly unclear, so I added some clarifying notes about what it means for something to be large. I thought this would help the student to better understand the intent, since they did not clearly know what to select in this case. \n\n### Teacher comments:\n\nHow would I change my instructions that I have written above the problem to make them clearer for future students?\n\n1. I added clarity to the sentence that specified that the Empire State building can be described as large and tall. Previously, there were two sentences in the prompt, and one of them seemed a bit unclear. I realized that the student missed the word \u201cand\u201d after they finished that sentence and then started analyzing if height and size mean the same thing for \u201ctall\u201d. I am hoping that the addition of the second sentence will help to make it clearer.\n\n\n## Additional information from instructor:\n\nYou can add more comments to show students the comments left. Teachers can include their own comments and feedback as well.\n\n### Additional information from the instructor:\n \n1. The student is learning about how to evaluate an expression, and they started dividing the equation in the second column. The only mistake they made is they added up the correct expression to do the whole- number division by dividing 18 by 6 and coming up with 3. Which is the sum of the division I indicated the correct answer, but didn\u2019t say to evaluate the expression correctly.\n \n2. This student did not do any of the steps of the problem in this section. Instead, they just evaluated an expression with no steps followed", "answer": "E: tall"}

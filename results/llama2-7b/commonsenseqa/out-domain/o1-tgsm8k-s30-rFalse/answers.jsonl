The first hour of the day, for example, is 00, 1 am is 01, and 2 pm is 14. \n\tTo help you remember what hour you are in, the number 00 means midnight (after 12), 01 means 1 am, and 13 means midday. \n\tSo midnight is when the hour hand is pointing at the number 0, 1 am when the hour hand is at number 1, and midday when the hour hand is between\n\t1 and 12, pointing anywhere between that range.\n\tA similar convention exists for minutes: \n\tthe 12th minute is 00, the 13th minute is 01, etc.\n\tSo when the hour hand is in the 1st hour segment  and pointing to the number 1, on a 24 hour clock, the minute hand is pointing at the 01 minute (01 is the 13th\n\tminute).\n\t\n\t\tIn 24 hour time notation, if you see 01-14, a good guess is that the number 14 refers to midday (12pm to 1pm).\n\t\tThe only exception is if the number 14 is followed by the letter 't', which means time of day (or \"to the\", as in 14:00t). \n\t\tAt any other time, \"14\" alone will be a 24 hour time without a \"t\".\n\nOutput:E\n---", "answer": "A: addiction"}

The article starts off stating the fact that Uber only started 4 years ago, yet it is able to stay afloat due to the support of the major companies. It further talks about other companies that are being affected by Uber, especially the taxi industry. Since Uber's creation, many people have left the cab industry. Uber is also able to stay afloat by creating UberX services that are very affordable for people. It then mentions UberX's 3rd quarter 2014 operating losses of $1.2 billion.\n\n### TL;DR\nUber started with only 4 cars in their fleet. They continue to have an amazing 4-year run that is able to stay afloatafter only employing 4000 people. The only major company that Uber has yet to get into, that is also in the taxi industry, is Lyft. Lyft recently got an additional infusion of capital to aid their running. Many Uber employees have switched to Lyft. Uber also has faced challenges when the local government stepped in. They would impose fines on Uber users. \n\n## Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the company should be aware that their employees are switching to Lyft. They should also be aware of local challenges that they face, such as local regulations. Apart from that, they also shouldn't be too focused on the ride sharing, rather they should include other transportation facilities and services. In fact, they should look into opening up a taxi cab service so that customers have a wider range of options.", "answer": "B: populated area"}

{"text": "A\n\nInput:How many feet is 254cm?\nOutput: 8.29969\n\n### Solution: \n***First part, for the car rental: the question states that in addition to the car rental charge of $30/day, there is a one-week minimum rental charge of $190. My equation is as follows: $$A=0.301905\\cdot x (1-1/7\\cdot x)$$ for the number of days x. The $30/7 was because the first step of solving the equation was to take $30/7 to make it more manageable. Then, I solve the equation for x, and the answer was 11.65714, and the car-rental charge was $403.9716.\n\n```python\nimport math\n#input variables\ndays = float(input(\"\"))\n\n#equation\nA = (math.pow(30, days) * 1.0) - (math.pow(190, days) * (1.0 / 7.0))\nprint(A)\n```\n\nThe second part stated that in the year 2019, the president was Donald J. Trump, and is the leader of the country. To find how many feet 254cm is, I used the equation for inches to be 1 inch is 1/12 of a foot. Thus: $$f=123.76\\cdot x\\quad (1)$$ and $$f=12\\cdot x \\quad (2)$$ Both were equal, so using either equation should be fine for the question. I solved equations (1) and (2) for x. The answers were $22.2cm$ and $32.0cm$, respectively.\n\n```python \nimport math\ninput = float(input (\" 254cm how many feet?\"))\nA = math.ceil(math.floor(input/12.0)/12.0)\nprint(A) \n```\nThe third part is actually the first part but the format changed.

But in case where the input is neither a whole number nor a string, the output can be a string. \n\n### Tips #2 and #3\nSince the number of inputs is variable and the number of outputs is also variable, in general, the number of statements in the If statement is also variable, unlike usual IFELSE statements. \n\n## #4) Write an algorithm to solve the following problem\n\n### Instruction: Answer the following multiple choice question:\n\nInput: The first line of the input will be $n$, the no. of people who come into the movie theater (n >= 1). \nThe second line will be the payoffs given by the movie theater of entering the movies (increasing in amount). \nOutput: No. of people who take the last movie of the theater.\n\n### Answer (Option D)\n\nOutput: If the people entering the cinema are the number of options, and each of them have certain amount of tickets to be charged. Then the first group who has the lowest charge will get the movie. The rest will enter the next movie. If the number of people equal to the number of choices(=n), then output will be n-1 since the last one won\u2019t have enough tickets.\nInput: the first line gives the number of options, the second line are the choices with respect to option choice (the first choice has the least option).\nOutput: The total amount of money spent on getting tickets to watch a particular movie after a certain person. \n\n## Tips for #5\nWhen you write the program, you need to take care of the fact that the input and the output numbers might not be integers that is why we need to write the code to deal with the floating-point number.\n\n## Tips about #6\nWe need to define the values of each statement in the if statements by using variable/ constants. But we also need to compare the conditions by using if-else statements.\n\n## Tip about #7\nWe should be more specific which type of if statements we need to be used to", "answer": "B: happiness"}

For example, $(2\\times 3)/(8+4)$ represents the division of two numbers, which does not make much sense. The division between $2\\times 3$ and $x$ involves a number that is missing, which is not interpreted as a division of fractions.

We can do that by changing the  for loop to a  while loop with i as the counter variable and the value 0. The while loop will run until the value of this counter i reaches the value in the counter variable i.\n\n#### Example:\nThe housework task will run when the value of the counter i has a value greater than 0, and the counter i will only run once the value of the i equals the value of Counter i, to represent the day count.\n\nIn order to get C (the emotion after doing housework for a certain number of days), we now put the number C and the counter (i) into a while loop. The while loop will repeat until the value of counter i equals the value of counter C (the length of your housework task). We then subtract 1 from the start variable, and multiply this value by the variable C. This gives the result of your housework task. Now, we've created a formula like this.\n\n```(B(i) = 1+(i-1)) x (A(length of task/counter i))`\n\nBut C doesn't represent the length of the task for doing housework. We use the value in this case equal to 1 to represent the 1 week maximum for the rental and 1 to represent", "answer": "C: stress"}

For example, the distance from 757 to 1 is 751, the distance from 1 to 757 (the number above) is 756, the distance from 469 to 757 is 288 and the distance from 11 (the number below) is 777. Note that the distance from any number to any number that is 100 greater, 990 to 757, is 203. There are 49 such pairs. The most frequent such pair occurs when the distance is 203, and there are 17 total such pairs.\n\nNow the final step is to figure out how many pairs are there in all. You can't just count the number of 4 elements, because each pair corresponds to two of them, so you need to subtract all the distance between a group of 4 from all the numbers below a group of 5, and so on, to count the total number of groups.\n\n### If a number sequence repeats itself, the sequence is the most frequent\n\nEach sequence can be described by a number.

I had spent literally a thousand hours studying for the interview. What was the question? Input: The car-rentel agency charges $37/day for a car or $250 for the first week of an entire week or longer a rentel That lasts a week or longer. Mary rented a car for three days. How much did she pay for the rentel Output: $100.  There was nothing tricky about this question. It was well below the level of Dice. The only thing I had to watch out was the time consumption. I had to be very accurate. So I had to go for a divide by. But then I had to make sure I did not overflow. The Overflow was handled using modulo. But then came the question on whether I could do it using a single int without using the modulo operator. And then after that they asked the question about negative negative numbers and the modulo operator\n\n---\n## Answer:\n- [Solution 1](https://github.Com/Ten Tigers/Algo- Titan-Interview-stars/blob/main/SOLUTIONS/Tesla/SOLUTIONS-101557568/Tesla1Solution.java)", "answer": "B: melting"}

{"text": "B\n\n### Instruction:Answer the questions below based on the input above\n\nHow many days was Jennie's rental?\nA: 12.5 B: 6.25\n\nExplain your logic behind B as your answer.\nI did this in two cases. The first case is that Jennie started the rental on day 1, this gives 45 days until she is done with the rental. Since 45/30 = 15 and she has to pay for the rent for 11 days, this leaves me with 4 days that Jennie won't have to pay any more rent. These 4 days occur between day 6 and day 10. In total, the rental is 15-4 = 11 days long.\nThe second case is that Jennie starts on day 7, and continues to day 17, this gives me again a rent for the next 7 days (including the day she started) of 7 * 31 dollars. This brings us to the following:\n7+15+15+17+17+11+10=$164\nI can make a difference with Jennie's total costs by the $0,19/day cost which is $1,50/11 days\n0,19 * 11 = 1,79 1,79-164=15 15/0,19 = 75 days\nI am looking for a number that will be a nice number and can tell me the amount she paid...\n0,25 (5 dollar cheaper than 6 dollar, which I want to round to 5 when asked to round to the nearest dollar)...\n\nWhy does the second answer explain why your answer to B is valid?\nSince the second part of my answer does not apply to the first part, I think I made a mistake somewhere. The $1,50 is something I computed as 0,19/30 and if I go 0,19 *11 to 111,90 and I divide it by 30 and I get 3,99", "answer": "B: have fun"}

{"text": "A\n\n# Solution\n\n## 1. Rental Car\n\nThe problem can be solved by using the recursion in python, which runs the program with the solution.

So every 7 days we will pay a week. \n        i = j-190\n        j= 190\n    else:\n        i+=1\n        j+=190\n\n\n\nprint (i)\n```\n\n## 2.

It was a brutal and harsh war, and many on both sides were lost. But ultimately, the victors won and gained control over the world. They set up a government that put the rights of the earth above all else, even humans. People were free and able to do what they wanted as long as they were not hurt themselves or others. To be safe, they created an electric fence around the world to divide the humans from the earth. Anyone who ventured inside the fence was put in jail to await the time they could return home safely. To prevent people from escaping, guards patrolled the fence and warned anyone who came close to the fence to return home or face the consequences.\n### One particular day, Mike left home to go mow the lawn. It was a warm spring day, and Mike figured he may as well get out for some fresh air. However, he noticed as he walked toward the fence that it seemed to be shrinking. In fact, when he got close enough, he realized that the fence was actually smaller than when he first saw it. He did not know for sure that the fence was shrinking, but he took a chance. He stepped onto the grass right before the fence, and sure enough, the boundary lines changed instantly.\n### Mike now had the right to be on the planet Earth again. He had once more found the place he once knew and loved.\n### Output: Mike stepped into the earthly realm again.

After making some adjustments, the aromometer now has four settings. Setting one is for those aromas that are strong for some people but mild for others. Anytime you see such a rating, the item will be $9.99 a bottle. If it sounds aromatic to everyone, but not quite as strong as its rating, the item is $14.99 per bottle. If an item smells great to all, but a bit more mild than its rating, the item costs $19.99.  I will tell you when each of these settings is in use if you ask, so save your money!\n\nThe first item is a bologna that has a label that sets it equal too 900, but is aromatic to you and only 3 other people.\n\nWhat is your rating for this bologna?\n```\n\n### Multiple Questions (Part II)\n\n```\nInput: A person has just taken a trip on the surface of the Earth as a space tourist.

The reservation process is an example of _____.\nOutput: a reservation process.\n\n### Solution Strategy\n1. The amount saved on a purchase of an expensive item depends on the length of time for which the item is purchased. The longer one keeps the item, the larger the savings.\n\n2. The amount saved on an item is not affected by how often purchases are made. For example, a one-time purchase of a $1000 item will have the same savings over 2 years if the item is bought once per year or ten times per year.\n\n3.  A discount does not have a negative value. For example, an item available at a price of $100 has a discount of $40, but has a savings of $60 as compared to the regular price.\n\n4. A discount does not increase when an item is purchased more than once (even if the discount is applied multiplicatively). In effect, it decreases every time an item is purchased, regardless of price. For example, an expensive item with a discount of -$10 has a $10 reduction in the total price if the discount is multiplicatively applied to the total price (that is, the discount changes the amount of positive or the amount of negative sign), while its savings (the amount of positive discount) is $0 every time the item is purchased.\n\nIn order to save money, one wants to buy the item for as long as one can reasonably afford.\nIn order to save less money", "answer": "D: city centre"}

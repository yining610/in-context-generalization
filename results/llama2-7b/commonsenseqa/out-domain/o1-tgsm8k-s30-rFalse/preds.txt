They demonstrate that it is reasonable to model your questions using this type of format.<n><n>### Step 1: Create a set of rules that will be used by the computer program<n><n>- How will you model your program? <n>	- How can I represent the answer?<n>	- How does the input determine the answer?<n>		- What's the relationship between input and output (in your head)?<n>- Example: Here is an initial way to model this program:<n>	- The number of "weeks" determines the fee.<n>	- Increase the fee by $10/weeks for each week.<n>- Example: Here's a different initial way to model this:<n>	- If the rental lasts for more than a week, a fee of $30/week is charged. <n>		- This means that $30 / 7 = $4.2888<n>	- If the car is for only one week, an additonal $20 fee is imposed.<n>		- This also means that the total fee is $190 instead of $30/7.<n>	- The rental can't be for more than a week.<n>- Example using rules:<n>	- 1 week = $30<n>	- x + 1 week = y<n>	- y = x + 1<n>	- x = 1/y<n>	- x * 7 = 30<n>	- Substitute 1/7 for x<n>		- 7 / 7 = 1/7<n>	- Divide both sides of the equation by 7 <n>		- 1/7 = 1/49<n>	- Divide each side by 1/7<n><n>### Step TWO: Write a program to carry out the rules<n><n>- For our first rule, add one to the number of weeks and divide the output by 7.<n>- For our second rule (in the comments below), add 100 to the last amount divided by 7, then divide the output by 49.<n><n>	```<n>	car <n>	input number of weeks rent fee<n>	then <n>	7 30  49<n>	14 40 49

The first hour of the day, for example, is 00, 1 am is 01, and 2 pm is 14. <n>	To help you remember what hour you are in, the number 00 means midnight (after 12), 01 means 1 am, and 13 means midday. <n>	So midnight is when the hour hand is pointing at the number 0, 1 am when the hour hand is at number 1, and midday when the hour hand is between<n>	1 and 12, pointing anywhere between that range.<n>	A similar convention exists for minutes: <n>	the 12th minute is 00, the 13th minute is 01, etc.<n>	So when the hour hand is in the 1st hour segment  and pointing to the number 1, on a 24 hour clock, the minute hand is pointing at the 01 minute (01 is the 13th<n>	minute).<n>	<n>		In 24 hour time notation, if you see 01-14, a good guess is that the number 14 refers to midday (12pm to 1pm).<n>		The only exception is if the number 14 is followed by the letter 't', which means time of day (or "to the", as in 14:00t). <n>		At any other time, "14" alone will be a 24 hour time without a "t".<n><n>Output:E<n>---<n>

The article starts off stating the fact that Uber only started 4 years ago, yet it is able to stay afloat due to the support of the major companies. It further talks about other companies that are being affected by Uber, especially the taxi industry. Since Uber's creation, many people have left the cab industry. Uber is also able to stay afloat by creating UberX services that are very affordable for people. It then mentions UberX's 3rd quarter 2014 operating losses of $1.2 billion.<n><n>### TL;DR<n>Uber started with only 4 cars in their fleet. They continue to have an amazing 4-year run that is able to stay afloatafter only employing 4000 people. The only major company that Uber has yet to get into, that is also in the taxi industry, is Lyft. Lyft recently got an additional infusion of capital to aid their running. Many Uber employees have switched to Lyft. Uber also has faced challenges when the local government stepped in. They would impose fines on Uber users. <n><n>## Conclusion<n>In conclusion, the company should be aware that their employees are switching to Lyft. They should also be aware of local challenges that they face, such as local regulations. Apart from that, they also shouldn't be too focused on the ride sharing, rather they should include other transportation facilities and services. In fact, they should look into opening up a taxi cab service so that customers have a wider range of options.<n><n>

Choices: A: 100 cents B: 60 cents C:0.80dollars D: $0.16 <n>Output: 600<n>### What should be the first line of the code?<n>First line: import math<n><n>### What should the return type look like, i.e.  what datatype?<n>Output: a string and integer.  You are not being graded on the functionality of what your code does, you are being graded on your syntax/language.  If the code does not have any errors, but returns incorrect data you will still get a D on the assignment.  There will be multiple assignment to test the functionality of the code.<n><n>### Why does this matter and who should care?<n>In order to get a better understanding of the functionality of the code, you should be aware of the language’s syntax.  You should be able to explain why a line of code does or does not work.<n>### How/Why does it matter to the end user?<n>The ability to program in a particular language and the functionality of a line of code are directly related in that you should always look at the overall effect of some code.  If what you are doing has an unexpected behavior, you should be able to look at the code and understand why that behavior occurs.<n><n>### Do you have a different idea?<n>My question is, that I dont think this is appropriate to be added to coding practices for students in my program.  Students in web engineering are not taught coding language in the program.  I work outside of IT, but I can tell you a lot of companies do not look at coding language of your cover letter unless you are applying to a job directly that requires a very specific skill set to write code. <n>

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The car-rental agency charges $30/day for a car, or $190 for the first week for a rental that lasts an entire week or longer. Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: 310<n><n>Input:The president is the leader of what institution? Choices:  A: walmart B: white house C: country D: corporation E: government<n>Output:		A<n><n>Input:How many feet is 254cm?<n>Output: 8.29969<n><n>### Solution: <n>***First part, for the car rental: the question states that in addition to the car rental charge of $30/day, there is a one-week minimum rental charge of $190. My equation is as follows: $$A=0.301905\cdot x (1-1/7\cdot x)$$ for the number of days x. The $30/7 was because the first step of solving the equation was to take $30/7 to make it more manageable. Then, I solve the equation for x, and the answer was 11.65714, and the car-rental charge was $403.9716.<n><n>```python<n>import math<n>#input variables<n>days = float(input(""))<n><n>#equation<n>A = (math.pow(30, days) * 1.0) - (math.pow(190, days) * (1.0 / 7.0))<n>print(A)<n>```<n><n>The second part stated that in the year 2019, the president was Donald J. Trump, and is the leader of the country. To find how many feet 254cm is, I used the equation for inches to be 1 inch is 1/12 of a foot. Thus: $$f=123.76\cdot x\quad (1)$$ and $$f=12\cdot x \quad (2)$$ Both were equal, so using either equation should be fine for the question. I solved equations (1) and (2) for x. The answers were $22.2cm$ and $32.0cm$, respectively.<n><n>```python <n>import math<n>input = float(input (" 254cm how many feet?"))<n>A = math.ceil(math.floor(input/12.0)/12.0)<n>print(A) <n>```<n>The third part is actually the first part but the format changed. My thought was to take 254cm from the input, and put that into equation one, but as you can see, it didn't like that! However,

When we interpret $x$ or $y$ as fractions, we say $x/y$ represents a fraction. For example $7/3$ represents a fraction. However, if $x$ and $ y$ are not both numbers, the notation $x/y$ is not interpreted the same way. For example, $(2\times 3)/(8+4)$ represents the division of two numbers, which does not make much sense. The division between $2\times 3$ and $x$ involves a number that is missing, which is not interpreted as a division of fractions. We say the division of two numbers is ambiguous.<n>What is the product of all the numbers of the form $x/y$, where $x$ and  $y$ are both positive integers and not both fractions?<n>Output: 1.8333333<n><n>Input: Find the greatest number that can be written as a sum of factors in non-increasing order.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The car-rental agency charges $30/day for a car, or $190 for the first week for a rental that lasts an entire week or longer. Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: 310<n><n>Input:What might you feel after doing housework for hours? Choices:  A: anger B: not boredom C: stress D: boredom E: anxiety<n>Output:		C<n><n>A: the number of dollars Jennie paid for the rental<n>B: the feeling you get after doing housework for an extended period (or when doing some menial, tedious, or drudging task repeatedly)<n>C: the feeling that you experience when you've just done some amount of housework, and you're now going to rest/exhaustion<n>D: the feeling you experience after being under stress (emotional pressure or tension) for a long period<n><n>#### Explanation:<n><n>To get A (the total cost for the rental) we have to write a  for loop that counts to 11 and then checks if the counter variable i (in this case, i = 1..11), then multiply $30 per day to i and add together the results in a total variable T.<n><n>To get B (the mood you may get after doing housework) we have to have options that will run from 1 (or one for every day, which you do in a for loop) up to the counter variable, i. We can do that by changing the  for loop to a  while loop with i as the counter variable and the value 0. The while loop will run until the value of this counter i reaches the value in the counter variable i.<n><n>#### Example:<n>The housework task will run when the value of the counter i has a value greater than 0, and the counter i will only run once the value of the i equals the value of Counter i, to represent the day count.<n><n>In order to get C (the emotion after doing housework for a certain number of days), we now put the number C and the counter (i) into a while loop. The while loop will repeat until the value of counter i equals the value of counter C (the length of your housework task). We then subtract 1 from the start variable, and multiply this value by the variable C. This gives the result of your housework task. Now, we've created a formula like this.<n><n>```(B(i) = 1+(i-1)) x (A(length of task/counter i))`<n><n>But C doesn't represent the length of the task for doing housework. We use the value in this case equal to 1 to represent the 1 week maximum for the rental and 1 to represent

For example, the distance from 757 to 1 is 751, the distance from 1 to 757 (the number above) is 756, the distance from 469 to 757 is 288 and the distance from 11 (the number below) is 777. Note that the distance from any number to any number that is 100 greater, 990 to 757, is 203. There are 49 such pairs. The most frequent such pair occurs when the distance is 203, and there are 17 total such pairs.<n><n>Now the final step is to figure out how many pairs are there in all. You can't just count the number of 4 elements, because each pair corresponds to two of them, so you need to subtract all the distance between a group of 4 from all the numbers below a group of 5, and so on, to count the total number of groups.<n><n>### If a number sequence repeats itself, the sequence is the most frequent<n><n>Each sequence can be described by a number.  If the number repeats multiple times, that means the repetition repeats over a larger range so it will be described as the most frequent number. The number sequence

Use inheritance to create subclasses. <n><n>Define two subclasses: “Male” and “Female” that have the same name and age attributes as the base class, “Person”. The constructor for these subclasses should also assign a gender attribute (as defined in “Classes”), and store the value in the instance’s @gender variable. The constructors for these two subclasses should call the @name attribute from the base class and assign it to the corresponding @name variable for the new classes. <n><n>##### C. <n>Print an object’s name, gender, and age. <n>Test each of your subclasses: create an object, test it, and destroy the object.

I really don't have anything deeper behind this, but I wanted to post this to demonstrate how math can be really cool and how you don't need a meaningful explanation for stuff.<n>

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The car-rental agency charges $30/day for a car, or $190 for the first week for a rental that lasts an entire week or longer. Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: 310<n><n>Input:They took a break from all the rides to have lunch, while eating hamburger they talked about how they were going to what on the next ride? Choices:  A: heartburn B: have fun C: enjoy D: gas E: food poisoning<n>Output:		B<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the questions below based on the input above<n><n>How many days was Jennie's rental?<n>A: 12.5 B: 6.25<n><n>Explain your logic behind B as your answer.<n>I did this in two cases. The first case is that Jennie started the rental on day 1, this gives 45 days until she is done with the rental. Since 45/30 = 15 and she has to pay for the rent for 11 days, this leaves me with 4 days that Jennie won't have to pay any more rent. These 4 days occur between day 6 and day 10. In total, the rental is 15-4 = 11 days long.<n>The second case is that Jennie starts on day 7, and continues to day 17, this gives me again a rent for the next 7 days (including the day she started) of 7 * 31 dollars. This brings us to the following:<n>7+15+15+17+17+11+10=$164<n>I can make a difference with Jennie's total costs by the $0,19/day cost which is $1,50/11 days<n>0,19 * 11 = 1,79 1,79-164=15 15/0,19 = 75 days<n>I am looking for a number that will be a nice number and can tell me the amount she paid...<n>0,25 (5 dollar cheaper than 6 dollar, which I want to round to 5 when asked to round to the nearest dollar)...<n><n>Why does the second answer explain why your answer to B is valid?<n>Since the second part of my answer does not apply to the first part, I think I made a mistake somewhere. The $1,50 is something I computed as 0,19/30 and if I go 0,19 *11 to 111,90 and I divide it by 30 and I get 3,99

It was a brutal and harsh war, and many on both sides were lost. But ultimately, the victors won and gained control over the world. They set up a government that put the rights of the earth above all else, even humans. People were free and able to do what they wanted as long as they were not hurt themselves or others. To be safe, they created an electric fence around the world to divide the humans from the earth. Anyone who ventured inside the fence was put in jail to await the time they could return home safely. To prevent people from escaping, guards patrolled the fence and warned anyone who came close to the fence to return home or face the consequences.<n>### One particular day, Mike left home to go mow the lawn. It was a warm spring day, and Mike figured he may as well get out for some fresh air. However, he noticed as he walked toward the fence that it seemed to be shrinking. In fact, when he got close enough, he realized that the fence was actually smaller than when he first saw it. He did not know for sure that the fence was shrinking, but he took a chance. He stepped onto the grass right before the fence, and sure enough, the boundary lines changed instantly.<n>### Mike now had the right to be on the planet Earth again. He had once more found the place he once knew and loved.<n>### Output: Mike stepped into the earthly realm again.

The reservation process is an example of _____.<n>Output: a reservation process.<n><n>### Solution Strategy<n>1. The amount saved on a purchase of an expensive item depends on the length of time for which the item is purchased. The longer one keeps the item, the larger the savings.<n><n>2. The amount saved on an item is not affected by how often purchases are made. For example, a one-time purchase of a $1000 item will have the same savings over 2 years if the item is bought once per year or ten times per year.<n><n>3.  A discount does not have a negative value. For example, an item available at a price of $100 has a discount of $40, but has a savings of $60 as compared to the regular price.<n><n>4. A discount does not increase when an item is purchased more than once (even if the discount is applied multiplicatively). In effect, it decreases every time an item is purchased, regardless of price. For example, an expensive item with a discount of -$10 has a $10 reduction in the total price if the discount is multiplicatively applied to the total price (that is, the discount changes the amount of positive or the amount of negative sign), while its savings (the amount of positive discount) is $0 every time the item is purchased.<n><n>In order to save money, one wants to buy the item for as long as one can reasonably afford.<n>In order to save less money

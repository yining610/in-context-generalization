In the weeks following a hurricane, the price of oranges may increase, but not by as much as the price of apples. In general, given the market for oranges and apples, how can we predict the relative differences in weekly price change for oranges when the price, in dollars, of apples goes up by 100%?\nOutput: Since when the price of applies goes up, the price of oragnes goes up, for the first case, they will have $10 for apples and $5 for oranges for a 2:1 ratio. But after a hurricane, even though the price of apples may increase by a larger percentage than for oranges, it will still not be that much more than a 2:1 difference since the price increase is not so large. The difference would still be in the same ratio, making the price for oranges more expensive. This happens whenever the price of apples increases more than it does for oranges. It\u2019s 2:1 at the original cost. Then if the price of apples doubles, then the price of oranges must be 2x as much to have the same ratio in order for the oranges price per pound to increase as much as the price for apples 2x. So the price of oranges will increase to 50.\nSo the price of oranges 200% is $50\nSo the price of $50 oranges after the hurricane is $50/2=<<25>>25 and the price of their apples is $30\nSo the price is $25/$30=$<<25/$30=1/2>>1/2.\nSo the final result is 1/2\n\nInput: If two thirds of Sam's money are in savings and one third are in a checking account, at the end of the month he has $315.2", "answer": "D: get arrested"}

The city had to pave 60 blocks, seal coat another 60 blocks, and remove litter from a total of 550 city blocks.  There was no extra money in the budget for more blocks.  How many blocks were paved that year?\nOutput: Let x represent the number of blocks where litter was removed.\nThe budget includes maintenance for the sum of x blocks of litter removal + 60 blocks of paving + 60 blocks.\nThe budget was $350, so each of the 180 blocks costs 350/180 = $<<350/1=2>>2\nSo x + 2 + 2 = <<x+2+2=5>>5 blocks of paving is done in the year.\nFrom the problem, you must have x + 60 + 60 = 710 blocks of litter and maintenance, meaning 700/5 = 140 blocks of litter were removed each year.\nTherefore, 5 paved blocks per year + 140 blocks per year is 145/5 = <<145/5=29>>29 blocks of litter were paved each year.\nSo 29+(29+2), meaning 60 blocks are paved in total each year. Thus, 2 blocks are paved with every 60/2 = <<2/60=1/30>>1/30 blocks of litter are paved each year. So 1/30 of 60 = 2 is 2 blocks of paving are done each year.\nSo x=(60)(2)/140=<<60*2/140=2>>2\nThe number of blocks that are paved is equal to 2.\nSo the final answers is 2\n\nInput: A man and his family are touring the Grand Teton National Park.

It probably only prefers the lap, which is the best bet for being happy.\nEven if you are at home, a lap is always a better place to be.\nIf a cat is in an alley at home or in an alley somewhere out of a cat's home, it is not happy.\nThe lap is far more comfortable and the cat doesn't seem to mind where it is.\nBut it also likes to be in a barn far away from home, since it feels more at home in a barn than at home.\nIn the Cat in a Box Experiment, people try to give their pet cats a better place in a box.\nMany people think the cats might be more comfortable in a box with a place to lie down, a warm blanket, and a pillow to sleep and play on.\nFor years, scientists thought that putting box material inside the cat boxes would improve the cats' quality of life.\nBased on research at UC Davis, though, it turns out that even if a cat is made comfortable by having a bed or softer litter, the cat is likely to leave its box.\nThe cat is most likely to stay in the box if the box is the most comfortable place for it to be.\nIn 2004, scientists found that it was possible to train cats to stay in boxes through positive reinforcement.The next year, researchers tested a cat's ability to avoid stress in a box by offering the cats another choice to cope with stress.\nThere are multiple ways to treat cat stress.  But the least stressful way for a cat to deal with loneliness, discomfort, and pain is to be left alone.\nIf the cats felt overwhelmed with stress, they would most likely try to get out of their boxes by jumping or climbing over the sides.\nIf a box does not provide enough space to relieve the cats, they are likely to get up and leave on their own.\nThus we can answer that cats are happiest when in a lap or a barn.", "answer": "D: lap"}

{"idx": 141, "text": "A mail box is delivered by hand and contains mail. Therefore, any mail that is received in an envelope will probably be put in a suitcase or box. The mailmen therefore drop the mail that is addressed to other addresses. They return it to the post office, where a postal worker will then go out and deliver the mail again. Mail that is in a postage-paid envelope will be delivered as it is. This process costs at most 25% more than if there are no returns. How much does sending the same letter through a person with a suitcase instead of a stamp cost?\nA letter costs an average of $1 in postage. The postage-paid letters come with a $1 stamp. If the stamp is removed from the envelope, the postage on the envelope is $2. The first mailing costs $2 + (1 $1 stamp + 1 $2 stamp) = <<2+1.0+1.0=4>>4. The second and subsequent mailings also cost $2 + (1 stamp + 1 stamp) = <<1.0+1>>2. In total, it costs 25% more, so 4 times 1.25 is 5.\nIf they send this with a first-class stamp in the first place, the postage costs 40 cents or 20% more.\nSo the final answers are 1 and 2\n\nInput: 1st day: you go to the dentist and then the drugstore, where you buy a 20-item package of cotton swabs worth 3 dollars and some other items totaling 11 dollars. 6:30pm - the gas station on the way into town\nOutput: Let t(d) be the time it takes us to get to the gas station. t(t)=t+t/9, and t(s)=s+s/2.\nNow, s = 1 2 3 \u2026 t(s) = 8 7 6 1\nt(s) = 1 + 1/9 + 1/36 + 1/81 + 1/105 + 1/110 + 1/30 + 1/2 + 1 = 56\n\nt(d) = 1 + (1/9) + (", "answer": "C: front door"}

Finally, since we selected the house as our second most likely place to have a fire exngusher and the doll house as our last choice, it does not make much since to say that both of those have fire exengushers.  But again, that is just lack of knowledge on my part.\nSo the final answers are 1)garage, 2)hospital(only), 3)house\n\nInput: Given a list of students from school, we want to use a simple algorithm to determine if there is an evenly distributed class.

If one cannot think like a programmer and have a firm understanding of how to code, then it will be very easy to get confused in the future, or struggle with what kind of information should be implemented in order to come up with a solution. We want to be able to not only think like a programmer, but also be able to code. Therefore, it's important to practice our algorithmic skills and try to see things from different perspectives when viewing a problem.\n\n\n# Author\n\n[Arielle Schon](https://github.com/arielleschon)\n\n\n# Contributors\n\n[Alicia Yu](https://github.comp/alicxui)\n\n[Johanne Kuzmishin](https://github.ocom/johannekuzmishin)\n\n[Mingyuan Zheng](https://github.gohome/mingyuan220)\n\n\n# Reference\n\n[Brian Chan](https://github.c/a2k2l)\n\n[Jessy Chen](https://github.co/jessy44)\n\n[Sophie Sun](https://github.org/johansunny)\n\n[Yutan Li](http://github.com/YutanWLi)", "answer": "B: lack of money"}

How many kilograms of meat does the calf produce total?\nOutput: There is a little confusion in the question with \u201cproduce\u201d and \u201cproduse\u201d. The use of these two words in this context is wrong and should be avoided in the future.\nProduce should mean \u201cto grow, create or generate something\u201d. Produce should be substituted with the more correct word result.\nProduce would be more useful in the question if it implied two separate animals creating their own meat, with cow and calf producing meat for an equal amount of time.\nProduse is often used for the creation of things that are made using materials found in nature.\nSince we don\u2019t want an ambiguous meaning, \u201cProduse\u201d should be written as Products.\nThus the question reads: How many kilograms will the calf products?\nSince nursing can take 12 months and thus produce 12 kilograms, how many calf produce do the cow and calf combine for?\nWe are left with a question of how much calf will the cow and calf produce in total (the product), but this time, we have a more correct formula, which would be calf*years.\nFrom here, we also", "answer": "B: names"}

In this class, for every 12 students who owned a bicycle, there were only 2 students who owned an MP3 player. If 3 students owned both a bicycles and an MP3 player, how many students owned an MP3 player?\nOutput: The most obvious answer is to subtract the number of students that owned both an MP and a bike (8) from the students that only owned an MP (3). 8-3=<<8-3=5>>5 Students with both.\nThe question then asks you to compare the number of students who only owned an MP with the number that owned both an MP12 and a bike2. 26 students only owned an MP3 which is 15 more than 11 students who owned both an MP and bike.  That leaves us with 21 students who owned both a bike and an MP, subtracting that number from 46 students leaves us with 25 students that only owned a bike.  From there, you subtract the number of students who owned both a MP and a bike and what is left is how many students only owned an MP.\n\n\nThe total answer is 25-8-3\nSo that gives us 14 students who only own an MP\n\nInput: 2/5 of the people in a certain grade prefer one color, 2/7 of the remaining people prefer another color, and 1/3 of the remainder prefer yet another color.

However the second begins at negative 0 so this is why it is the second value and has no value. Therefore the distance would be the distance between the first graph at positive 0 and the second beginning at negative zero. This is why it is negative zero and not positive zero. The shortest distance that a person can travel is found when the lines are superimposed at their highest point. In this case, 0-0 equals 0", "answer": "D: play piano"}

This trick can be particularly useful when solving problems that involve units that add up to fractions, such as 12 quadratics and 38 tetrahedra.  In such problems, you would need to add up the numerator values of the fractions.  To do this, you would find the value for the denominator and then calculate the sum of the numerators that went with that denominator.  For example, if there were 55 pentagons and 9 octagons, you would add up the numerator of 45 and the numerator of 9.\n\n### Output:\nThis trick can be applied anywhere you are adding fractions, but it may not be useful to break up your work when you're doing something more complex, such as adding units that are made up of fractions and units, like 50 cubed and 22 tetrahedra.\n\n### Quesiton 2\n\n### Instructions\n\nThis next problem is slightly more advanced and requires that you think more deeply about your strategy when adding up your work.

If a customer rents a car on Monday and Sunday, what is their daily rate, including taxes, if they rent for the entire week, in dollars?\nIn order to calculate the amount to be paid for a seven day rental of the car, we need to use the formula (100% * x/7) - (25% * 100% * 6/7). x is the price of the car without taxes. \nSince on Monday, the customer pays 100% on x (7 days * x/7), on this day, the price paid 1 day early is 1 / 7 = 142.9 %. \nOn Sunday when the price is paid for the week, the customer pays 25% of 100% of x * 6/7, which equals to 25% of x * 4/7 or 62.5%. \n142.9% + 62.5% = 205.4%\nThus, the rate of x * 142.857142857 = 100%\nx / 142.5 = x/R where R = 14257\nSolving x/R = x/142.5 => R = 1450 => 142.47315883335 \n\nInput: Rent a car costs $25 per day, plus another $25 to pick it up and return it.

To do this, note that there are a few ways to evaluate a fraction, but a standard fraction is always written as A/B, where A & B are both numbers. In this example, B = RI$82,471. So you could begin at the top of the fraction and work down in the traditional mathematical convention:\n1/2 = RI$(82,47)*1/2 = R I$(82,400) = R I$(164,940) = $<<416,940>>416,9 40\nIn other words, one-fifth of the RI$416,920 in RI$824 would go to the owner.\nAnother standard way to write 1/5 is in words as 1/5, so it would make sense to begin at the bottom and move upward in value:\n$824/5 = RI$164,960\nIn words, 1/5 = fifteen-fourths. Therefore, $15/5 = RI$$300000.50 = RI$30,000.5 = RI$36,400.5 = $<<15=36400.5>>36400\nSo the second way of answering that the fraction would be $36,401.00.\n\nInput:A bag contains 8 red balls, 7 white balls and 5 green balls.

The exhibit is to house 96 artifacts that will be on display to educate tourists who come to Rome.  The architect plans to house the artifacts into 8 rooms.  Each room should hold 12 objects to be on display.  Each room should have at least 1 lighting fixture.  Lighting fixtures require a source of electricity.  Electrical outlets require that they be wired into the main supply.  Wiring requires time and effort.  Time and effort require money.  Time is a fixed resource.  Money is also a fixed resource.  The maximum area for the exhibition is 30 feet by 48 feet.  Each room should take no more than 8 hours to build.  Each room should be built with one 8-foot-by-4-foot door.\nOutput: We have 12 rooms and 96 artifacts.  The 12 objects/room is divisible by 3.  So the 96 objects can be rounded to 36 rooms.\nThe 12 light fixtures and the 1 light fixture/room, can round down to 12, so 12 light fixture per 36 rooms.  The 8 hours to build room takes 2 hours/room.  The 1 8-foot-By-4-foot door takes 1/36 room, so (1/36)*1 = 0.025 rooms.  That is each room requires 1 light fixture and 2 hours (36 rooms * 2) to build the 2 hours per room to build.\nSo the final answers are:\n96*1*0.025 = <<96*1*25=360>>360\n2460*2 = <<2460*36=8240>>8240\n\nInput:\"Eduardo lives on the planet 9 planets away from earth\"", "answer": "C: naked"}

How much of a chance does each milk drinker have left of being served?\nOutput: Let x be the amount of milk drunk by the 32 milk drinkers and t be the time there is left until party end.\nThe milk consumption during any given time is a random variable with a Poisson distribution (and so is the difference between a Poisson variable and an independent variable)\nThe probability density function of the Poisson distribution with mean mu is given by:\nPdf(x|mu) = e\u2212\u03bc\u03bcx\nAnd so is the probability of there being x milk drinkers (which in our case is the probability of an individual being served) at a certain time being x.\nLet\u2019s find a way to express the probability of there being any milk drinker remaining at a certain time being t.\nAs per the graph, the probability of an individual milk drinker being served at time t/\u03bc is given by the equation: Pdf(x/\u03bc)\nThe probability of the 32 total milk drinkers being served = 1 - Pdf((32)/\u03bc)\nAs the total quantity of milk drinkers is 32, the probability of x (any individual milk drinker) remaining is e\u221232/\u03bc.\nSo the probability of an individual remaining being t is given by (assuming x is equal to the total of the individual milk drinkers)e\u2212(32/\u03bc)t/\u03bc.", "answer": "B: basement"}

But, there may be times when the wrong choice would be the correct one.  A manager can decide what type of action a person is expected to take in different situations. The best scenario is one in which a person makes the right decision and is not faced with difficulty. A wrong choice will cause difficulty when it is made at a critical time. If a wrong choice is made at a critical point in time but it is not important that the correct course of action is taken, then difficulty can be avoided.  A wrong choice is made when it doesn't make sense and there is a less effective alternative.

So that is 41/6-4= <<41/6/-4=37>>37\nThe next part says: But if you\u2019re already doing 5, what\u2019s the difference between 1 and 2? 5-37=<<5-37=12>> 12\nThe next part says the final answer is: 33/4\nSo the final answer for the prompt is: C\n\nInput: It costs $8.00 to get into a water park at a local resort.", "answer": "D: learn to read"}

So if the man pays $500 for the items in the package there would have to be four items in the package.  He didn\u2019t send her $500 in expensive items because the insurance policy only pays up to $10,000 per item in the package, that would have to mean she had four items that were worth $10,0 x 4 items she received = <<10,00*4=40,000>>40,00 so she did have four expensive items to warrant those four items being worth 40,00\nSo the deductible is $100 not $500 because 40,0 - 100 = <<4000-100=400>>400\nSo the insurance coverage was sufficient to cover the items she received in the package.\n\nInput:  What is the ratio of boys to girls at an elementary school?

It is a horizontal line (i.e. the left and right sides have different lengths).\nSince the little girl has one foot on the floor and therefore on L it means L = |L| = 0.\nThen the answer should be L=0, meaning 0=0 and thus it is a contradiction.\nSo the final choice of the answer was A.\n\nInput: You have a bucket to collect water from a stream. Your bucket holds 10 gallons. The stream is 88 feet away. How much water must you go back to the stream to fill the bucket?\nOutput: Length of the bucket (L) = A\nSince you have a bucket, that means you have an L.\nThe stream is 88 ft away, so you go back and forth 88 ft away from the stream for 1 bucket every time.\nIf the stream is 88ft away, that means the stream is L - 88 ft.\nSince the next bucket is after one round from the stream, the next bucket will need more water than the first bucket, since the remaining length of the stream is lessened after one round.\nTo get the water level to be 10 ft, the stream needed 2 trips there (88ft x 2) or <<88x2=176>>176.\nSo, if you were to go to the stream for 176 trips on the bucket, your bucket can be full, given it only takes 10 gallons to fill the bucket.\nSo, 176/10 = <<176/176=1>>1, meaning you need to go 176 times back and forth across the stream, on each trip filling your bucket to the max fill capacity.\nSo the final output was L=88 ft.\n\nInput: A man wanted to buy new tires for his car but did not have enough money.

{"idx": 972, "text": "The answer is B.\nChoice A: Relax- this tells you to just do what you instinctively want to do, and relax from doing a formal study or learning of the art you want to make. It means that art is something you cannot force, you need to find inspiration from other areas or things that help you have your own point of view.\nChoice B: Controversy- this means do something to push others boundaries and try to create a debate about your art. You need to draw from your experiences, find things that you have been through and put them on a canvas to share with the world, this way you are connecting your work to a larger audience.\nChoice C: Pleasure- this one is the easier one, in art you need to make sure you are enjoying yourself otherwise it gets boring and you never produce the work you could have. You need to be in love with what you are doing, feel all the sensations that it brings because it will help your soul and mind grow, allowing you to create better art.\nChoice D: Frustration- This is the opposite of pleasure, in art you will constantly find frustrations in your day to day life and you need to accept this as part of the artistic process. You will feel angry or upset at parts of your artwork, but this does not mean you need to toss out the work you have created, it is part of the experience of making art.\nChoice E: Needs Theater- This one does not describe any part of art making, but is the answer to the next section which asks what people create in theatre; they create a piece of art.

{"idx": 991, "text": "Fungi are naturally found in many places such as soil, plants, and water but their microscopic size makes them hard to spot.  They are also commonly known to be visible underneath leaves, and on tree bark or trunks.  It is also possible they're present on older cheese.  But fungi have a natural preference towards anything that resembles decaying material such as compost or decomposing wood.  Therefore, they can also be found on organic materials made out of milk.\nSo the fungus will not be found on: A, B, or C\nThe fungus will not be present on a biology laboratory unless that biology laboratory contained decaying milk or some other decaying organic material.  If that material was decaying milk from a cow, then the fungus will thrive on it.  So the fungus will not grow on: A, B or D\nWe also know that the fungus will not prefer to grow in a cheese-related product such as cheese or crackers.  So, the fungus is not likely to be found on: A or B or E\nThat leaves us having to examine the following options: C and D.  So, the answer is C because it is the only one that is a combination of items that a fungus would rather be exposed to.\nFungus is a naturally decomposing organic material and a decaying substance.

To actually give the correct answer, you need to do more computation and to apply the strategy in various cases.]\n\nThis is an interesting problem with multiple answer choices.  Because of that fact, in general I think the best answer is not necessarily always the right one, as it can be one that provides an important lesson of some kind, such as how to apply some concept from another field.  I'll be honest that I am not sure what answers (other than the correct answer) are acceptable in this question.\n\nThe question is really telling you that these questions were based on a story and that you can expect to see an arithmetic sequence in some of them, and this question provides a good illustration of how sequences can be found (and how they may not be always present).

{"text": "D\n\n##### Conclusion\n\nPlease provide a brief summary of your solution.\n\nI think that there are too many questions that make use of math. For example, I couldn't imagine how you should answer a question like \"if you spent $70 on cakes, what is the number of cakes? And how should you answer a question like \"how much meat do you have when you sell 500kg without the original plan?\" There wasn't even a clue to solve the questions.\n\nI'm not sure why the questions are all math-based because I don't consider myself a math expert that needs to answer questions involving math formula to find the answer. For example, there's the following question:\n\nGive the answer to the following problem.\n\nLet X = the number of times John and Sam ordered something at a restaurant that day. Let Y = the number of people who are ordering the same item as John and Sam. Let X - Y = the number of items that are delivered to John and Sam\u2019s table.\n\n1. What is the number of times that John and Sam ordered something?\n2.What is the number of people who ordered the same item as John?\n3.How many items were delivered to the table that John and Sam were sitting at (assuming the table only had them two)?\n\nI don't think that I'm the only person who gets stuck at number 3. If they want you to answer numbers within 30 minutes, they should put some sort of instructions on how to answer the question. Other than that, you may have to brush up your math skills because I don't think math would be the most suitable thing for some people. For me, I like math. I like math in elementary and I like math in highschool. I'm sure people who like math would enjoy answering these types of problem.

Recursion is a procedure that is defined in terms of an earlier procedure of the same (or a related) kind. It is a process of solving problems that follows a certain pattern. For more information about recursion and programming practice, kindly see more here. So, with this in mind, I decided to solve the problems by first deciding on a base case.\n\nBelow is the definition of a base case:\n\nA base case occurs when certain conditions can be met easily. A base case can never be recursive; it solves the problem exactly once. In other words, you solve a problem using a recursive case and then you use a base case to decide how you solve the next problem in the chain.\n\nMy base case was when the sum of the series was always zero.\n\nMy base function was: \n\n1.  If x = 0:\nReturn 0\n2.  Else\nReturn (x + f(x \u2013 1))\n\nBy using the above base cases, I arrived at the following generalizations. These include: \n\nThe first item in a chain should either be all the items in the chain or a function that takes the item(s) immediately before it as input. \nWhen you have an operation (such as a subtraction or multiplication) that depends on the previous step, the function always takes", "answer": "A: wear shoes"}

Each child can have any number of pencils between 0 and 9.  The classroom will run out of pencils for two students if their pencils add up to a number greater than 12.  Which two children will run out of pens?\nSolution: \nWe first have to figure out how many pencils each student is currently holding.\nFor example, let's consider Joss.  His pencils could contain any numerical value between 0 and 8, so that range is 24 possible pencils.  But Joss's pencils could also be just all 0s.  If Joss holds nothing, he'll run out of pencil if two other students hold \u2265 2 pencils.  If he holds 9 pencils, then he'll need \u2265 8 pencils from other students.  Since there are a maximum of 9 pencils he could hold, the actual number of possible combinations of pencils this could happen is 9*9.\nThere are also two variables, so we can calculate the number of different combinations.  Let's do this one first.  We have to do it for each possible condition of the two variables: 0, 1, 2,..., 9.\nSince there are two variables, we'll multiply our result by 2.\nLet's try to solve all of this in one go.  For all 9 combinations of pencils each student could hold and all the numbers of pencils, we need to find: \n1", "answer": "B: cemetary"}

We can  also write it   as (40 - 28).\n\nThe question explicitly says there is  a 40-year difference between the  current ages and  their age 40 years from  now.  Thus,  40 - (40 - 14) = _20._\nThe question only gives us  the ages of Richard and Hurley and  the age 40 years hence, not the 40-year age difference.  Thus, we're  left to find  Hurley's age 14 years hence by  subtracting his current age  from the age 40  years hence.\n\nInput:  Pablo\u2019s mother agre  es to pay him one cent  for every page  he reads.

After much deliberation, the children decided to divide themselves into four groups. The first group picked the number 5, the second picked 10, the third picked 20 and the fourth picked 30. These groups of children then decided to put the numbers back into a container and mixed up the numbers. Next, each child had a go at finding the hidden numbers. They came up with three different methods for selecting each different number. The number that was returned first by any of the children was the one that won the hunt. There were five rounds to the hunt.\n\n1) The first time the group of children that selected the number 20 was told to go first and chose a child to pick a number. The child that was chosen rolled a dice and got 3. The child that was picked by the group of children selected the number 60. The two children that picked the number 60 had to tell each other their favourite fruit and vegetable. The children both picked the same fruit and vegetable and were asked to say what their favourite part of the fruit and vegetable was. One boy chose cucumbers, he liked the crunchiest part of the cucumber. The other boy chose pears, he liked the juiciest part of the pear.\n\n2) The children went to the second round after they had told each other the questions from the first round and then decided to change their strategy for the second round. They chose to use the die again and got 4. They then got 61. So they asked who was the youngest child and said to the child that they would be asking him any questions. He was asked 3 questions about school, to choose from 5 subjects. He chose 2 of the subjects.\n\n3) The third round was no different to the first. Instead of repeating the same strategy as the second round. They went for the second strategy this round. The die got rolled again and another number was picked and given out this time. The child that picked the number 70 was told to ask any question to the boy selected 1 round ago. He chose to ask him about the school. He came up with his own 10 questions to ask 5 random subjects and the boy named them to him", "answer": "C: speak information"}

Why should we consider using Python?\n> Python is an object-oriented programming language. Python is high level, interpreted, and dynamic. Python is often compared to Java because of the many similarities between the two.\nPython is a general-purpose programming language. It has a simple syntax, extensive standard library. It supports functional programming. Python's comprehensive set of libraries enables developers to build applications with minimal redundancy and high productivity. Python programs are run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The JVM is a virtual machine which makes it easy to build and run applications for the web.\n\n### Q2. What is the difference between a class and an object in Python?What are the advantages and disadvantages of using object oriented programming?\nClasses and objects are both objects, but they have different properties. A Python class is a set of instructions that determines the behavior of an object. It is a blueprint for a Python object. A Python class includes the class name, the variables, and the functions that will be referenced by the class object.\nPython object orientation includes the creation of classes and instances. Objects have their own unique ID and can store a reference to data. OOP design is used in every programming language, but Python differs from other programming languages by using the principles of object orientation to create user-friendly applications.\nAdvantages of object oriented programming:\n\n1.Code Reusability\n2.Ability to separate data and function\n3.Easy to design and implement\nDisadvantages of object oriented language:\n1.Difficult to define abstraction\n2.Time consumed during design\n\n###  Q3.What are the different types of operators available in Python?\nString: +, -, *, or.\nReassignment: *=, +=, -=, //= and +=.\nBoolean: and, or, not.\nUnary arithmetic: -, unary ++ and unary --.\nComparison: <, <=, ==, >, >=.\nLogical: and, or, <>, if", "answer": "B: skill"}

{"text": "A\n\n### For this problem, the input is a string.\n\n1. Input: What could a balalaika, an instrument, be needed for?\n\n   The first part of this question is to count the number of times the substring \"a balalaika\" occurs. We can do this very simply using the `.count()` function.\n\n   2. In the next part, we'll use Python's splits function to split the string into tokens. We can then check whether the split is a match to \"a balalaika, a\". We can do this very easily using a.startswith( ) clause.\n\n   It's important to remember that we want to check if a part of the string starts with a balalaika. This means that if the string is \"a balalaika a\", it's not a correct answer.\n\n   We check if \"a balalaika \" is in the string. If it is, we want to split the string where the first part is the beginning of \"a balalaika\". If the beginning matches \"a balalaika\", we increment the total number of times that substring occurs.\n\n   It might be easier for you to think of this as a case insensitive.split(',') where the ',', when combined with \"a balalaika \", is like a space.\n\nInput: Input a phrase of any kind.\n\nOutput: Output the total number of times any substring matching \"a balalaika \".\n\n### For each of the questions below, print a boolean expression (in logical AND form, if possible) that will return True on the input.\n\nInput: If two strings have equal length, print True.\n\nOutput: True\n\nInput: If the input begins with 'p', print True.\n\nInput: Print True if the input is four characters long.\n\nOutput: False\n\nInput: If any element in the input array is \"p\", output True.\n\nOutput:: True\n\nInput: if the value at any index position is non-negative, return True.\n\nInput::\"abcdhg\"\n\nOutput: True \n\nInput: If all the letters in the input string appear in the word \"abcegiklmop\", return True.

{"text": "A\n\n### Explanation\n\nInput: The first question is the simplest input. We need to calculate the 40 years in the future by adding 20 years to the future. We know that 20 equals 2 \u22c5 10, so we need to subtract 2 \u22c5 4 from that result to turn it into a decimal. In other words,\n\n\n```\n40 / 20 = 2\n(40 / 2) / 2 = 4\n40 / 4 = 10\n```\n\nHence we simply have 100 years in the future. The answer is given as 128.\n\nInput: Since the original $241 was divided between Kelvin (120) and SM (140), $4 is their leftover amount, which then becomes SM's remaining amount. To find out what he has left, we need to convert Kelvin's value into 241 \u22c5 1, and multiply it by the value of $4. Hence the answer is $132, which is exactly the correct answer.\n\nInput: We know that each slice that John ate is equivalent of 1/3 of 12, therefore John ate 20 \u22c5 1/3 = 6 pieces.\n\n\n```\n16\n16\n-6\n\n\nSam ate 2 \u22c5 5. Hence he ate 10 pieces, with Kelvin consuming 20 pieces and leaving 3 pieces remaining.\n```\n\nInput: This question has two parts: first, there are 6 boxes of colored crayons and 7 boxes of gray crayons. Hence we have a total:\n\n\n```\n6 + 7 = 13\n```\n\nNext, we need 11 as the answer, so we need to divide 11 by 13, adding one. This gives the value of 0, so we can write 13 - 0 = 13.\n\nInput: By using the answer obtained in the previous example, we now have 3 + 7 = 2 blocks. We subtract 6 from the new value, giving 6 - 6 = 0.\n\nInput: 5 is the minimum amount the river can take from the river", "answer": "C: table setting"}

They had little knowledge of reading and mathematics. Men were literate. They had a sense of the history in the country and how it was governed. The women, who were largely illiterate, were forced to support the family. They were not allowed to make any contribution to the economy.  Instead, in the absence of formal education, women had to learn traditional skills from a very early age. Women were expected to be good weavers, good chefs, and good seamstresses. And the government had taken great care to educate men, which did not serve well the purposes of the women. As a result, women were completely handicapped. They had to keep the household together. So, despite the efforts of the government to educate men, the status of women took a back seat.

We then compute the amount in the variable $b, the total amount of books:\n\n```\n    $totalCost = $bookCash + $carCash;\n\n    $bookCost = ($totalCost - $carCash) / $carWS;\n    \n    $b = $totalCost - $bookCost;\n```\n\n## Part: Car appreciation\n\nWe first find out the amount in the variable called $b, the total $ amount for the car:\n\n```\n     $b = $total + $cash;\n```\n\nThen, we figure out the individual monetary amounts for each item in the group. To do so, we divide the total $ amount by the number of items in the group so that they will all pay the same amount. We then put this in the variable $a:\n\n```\n  $a = $e - $b - $c;\n```\n\nWhen we subtract everything from the $b variable, we get $25. We take that amount and subtract it from the $e variable so we get the amount in the $a variable:\n\n```\n $e = $a - $25;\n```\n\nAdditionally, we compute the individual payments for the car:\n```\n $e / $friends;\n```\n\nThe last step was done by finding out how much 1 friend needed to pay:\n\n```\n\n $a + $e;\n```\n\nSubtracting that from the total group price allows us to see", "answer": "A: utah"}

Since Hurley is 10 years younger than Richard, we need to find $  x = 20  -  14.  Then $  x = 6 .$  Then $  \\text{age of Hurley} = \\( 60\\).\n\nFor the second question, let $x$ = number of pages checked out.  If 150 pages is the number of pages in each book,  $  x $ must be an odd number.  For simplicity, let us assume that the number of pages checked out is $  x  =  125 $.  The next question is how much money does he collect for each page?  $  x  =  $ number of pages he reads.  $  x  \\times  $ the amount per page.  So,  $  \\text{money collected per page} =  $ (125 * 0.05 = 6.25) dimes.  If he buys books,  he probably buys a bunch of books.  So, we\u2019ll round that up and buy 10 books.

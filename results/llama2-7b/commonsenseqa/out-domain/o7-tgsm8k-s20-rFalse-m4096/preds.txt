They decide to split up the tasks among themselves. Choices:  A. 4 girls will work on the project, 3 boys and 3 girls will go out for lunch, and the rest boys will stay back after the project. B. 5 boys will work on the project and the rest 5 will go out for luch C. The boys will work on the task and the girls will go out for a lunch D. All the boys will work on the tasks and all the girls will go for lunch E. All the boys will not get to go out for lunch and the girls will have a lunch break<n>Output: D<n><n>Solution:<n><n>### Part 1:<n><n>For the first question, use the greedy approach. The first thing we need to do is write out the constraints. The constraints are:<n><n>$$66 + 8 \geq C$$<n><n>Since we are solving for \(C\), we want to set that number as variable \(c\). We are using the inequality symbol as a less than symbol, since we want \(c\ge C\)<n><n>After we write down the constraints, now we need to decide on the greedy solution for the sum of all the candies. We will decide to "greedily" choose \(2\) since we have to go right one place. However, when we get there, we have not finished the problem. When we are done working 2, we are left with 1 left over and not enough to fill the next two. Then we need to go again, and this time since we are greedily choosing \(2\), we will not be able to reach \(68\) and will stop here at \(57\).<n><n>We know that we end up at \(29\), but we also know that \(29\) should not be there and that \(68\) is the answer. What happens is that every time we add \(2\), we subtract one from the right and subtract two from the left when we reach \(66\) since we also cannot go left but we still need to subtract one in the final state.<n><n>As with all other questions, when we are done we check our work. We checked that \(66 + 8 = 74\) and that \(74 + 8 =

Howmany candies does Corey share<n>Output:20<n><n>#### Solution:<n><n>1. [Answer]: The answer is 29 as the total of candies for Tapanga and Core would be 88, but with Corey having 8 more and 29 left, Corey would have 1 more which makes the total for him to be 29.<n>2. [Answer]: The total money spent on the calls to his family would be 10 as 5cents times 25 would give you 125.<n>3. [Answer]: 5 as that's the sum of total hours<n>4. [Answer]: 600 as 60 was sold and the other 200 were left over.<n>5. [Answer]: 97 as the total to make would be 384(22+16+7) but it was rounded off to 97 after he subtracted 950 for the large birdhouses he didn't sell.<n>6. [Answer]: 3000 as 24/4 equals 6 as 6/4 is 1 as you multiply 6 into 4. So his is 120. Then 24X120 is 2880 which you multiply by 3/4 which gives you 2700. Then add that to 3000 to get you 2000+1500=3500. Then 3500X200=70000 then rounds the answer off to 300.<n>7. [Answer]: New Mexico as Utah is its own. <n> <n> <n>

That is, the prime factors of 5 are 5, 2, and 1. That the prime factors of 7 are 7, 3, and 1. If you list the prime factors of two numbers and determine that they share some factor, then those repeated factors will be in common. In the case of 5 and 2, the only common factor is 2, so 2 is the GCF of 5 and 4. In the case of prime factors, as each number has no common factor other than itself and 1, the GCF is 1<n><n>Output: 1<n><n>### InstructiOns:A dog was walking on the road and encountered a wolf and a man.

How much did consumers spend on gasoline this year?<n>Output: $448,320,000,000<n><n>The first number we have to work with is the answer. Since the answer is 29, we know that "2" is correct in the first choice. "3" is incorrect in the second choice, since the answer 868 does not contain "8". We know that "8" is correct in the third choice. Therefore, the answer to the first multiple choice question is 2, 8 and 9.<n><n>```<n>input: 66 + 29 =<n>```<n>We begin with 66+29. We are going to add a digit to the end of each of the 29, so we begin with 66. 66+9 = 75. Now we have 75. Next, we add 75 to another digit in the 29, and we add whatever was used to this first digit. So, we add 9 to the 66, so we end up with 72+9 = 81. Now we repeat. Add 8 to the 66 and 6 to the 8, so we end up 64+8 = 72. We are going to repeat this process, and eventually end at 5 + 29. So, we begin with 60 and end with 60+29 = 89<n><n>```<n>input : local calls costs 5 cents but international calls costs 25 cents<n>```<n>We begin by multiplying the number of minutes on local calls by the number of local calls. Therefore, 45x5 = 225. We now multiply the number of minutes on international calls by the number of international calls. 31x25 = 775. We now subtract the 225 from the 775, to get 550. We have calculated the monetary amount that Freddy spent on calls for New Years Eve.<n><n>```<n><n>input: How many hours would Lawrence spend each day if he worked equal amount of hours each day? So,

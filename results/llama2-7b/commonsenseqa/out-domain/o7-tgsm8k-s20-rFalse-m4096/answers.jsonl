All the boys will not get to go out for lunch and the girls will have a lunch break\nOutput: D\n\nSolution:\n\n### Part 1:\n\nFor the first question, use the greedy approach. The first thing we need to do is write out the constraints. The constraints are:\n\n$$66 + 8 \\geq C$$\n\nSince we are solving for \\(C\\), we want to set that number as variable \\(c\\). We are using the inequality symbol as a less than symbol, since we want \\(c\\ge C\\)\n\nAfter we write down the constraints, now we need to decide on the greedy solution for the sum of all the candies. We will decide to \"greedily\" choose \\(2\\) since we have to go right one place. However, when we get there, we have not finished the problem. When we are done working 2, we are left with 1 left over and not enough to fill the next two. Then we need to go again, and this time since we are greedily choosing \\(2\\), we will not be able to reach \\(68\\) and will stop here at \\(57\\).\n\nWe know that we end up at \\(29\\), but we also know that \\(29\\) should not be there and that \\(68\\) is the answer. What happens is that every time we add \\(2\\), we subtract one from the right and subtract two from the left when we reach \\(66\\) since we also cannot go left but we still need to subtract one in the final state.\n\nAs with all other questions, when we are done we check our work. We checked that \\(66 + 8 = 74\\) and that \\(74 + 8 =", "answer": "B: skill"}

That is, the prime factors of 5 are 5, 2, and 1. That the prime factors of 7 are 7, 3, and 1. If you list the prime factors of two numbers and determine that they share some factor, then those repeated factors will be in common. In the case of 5 and 2, the only common factor is 2, so 2 is the GCF of 5 and 4. In the case of prime factors, as each number has no common factor other than itself and 1, the GCF is 1\n\nOutput: 1\n\n### InstructiOns:A dog was walking on the road and encountered a wolf and a man.

How much did consumers spend on gasoline this year?\nOutput: $448,320,000,000\n\nThe first number we have to work with is the answer. Since the answer is 29, we know that \"2\" is correct in the first choice. \"3\" is incorrect in the second choice, since the answer 868 does not contain \"8\". We know that \"8\" is correct in the third choice. Therefore, the answer to the first multiple choice question is 2, 8 and 9.\n\n```\ninput: 66 + 29 =\n```\nWe begin with 66+29. We are going to add a digit to the end of each of the 29, so we begin with 66. 66+9 = 75. Now we have 75. Next, we add 75 to another digit in the 29, and we add whatever was used to this first digit. So, we add 9 to the 66, so we end up with 72+9 = 81. Now we repeat. Add 8 to the 66 and 6 to the 8, so we end up 64+8 = 72. We are going to repeat this process, and eventually end at 5 + 29. So, we begin with 60 and end with 60+29 = 89\n\n```\ninput : local calls costs 5 cents but international calls costs 25 cents\n```\nWe begin by multiplying the number of minutes on local calls by the number of local calls.

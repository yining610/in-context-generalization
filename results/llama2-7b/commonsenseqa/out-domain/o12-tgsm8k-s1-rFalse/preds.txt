Choices:  A: reach tentative agreement B: suicide C: examine thing D: commit murder E: stay in bed<n>Output:		 A<n><n>Input:The answer is always '4' (or '2', whatever).  However, I'll explain.  Choose a number, and then think about how many times you can add/subtract '1' so that the number is the chosen number (ie 3 + 1 = 4).  Then, say you want to get back to the chosen number to start all over.  You subtract one, and then add one.  Now take away the add/subtract you made and say you still have the answer.  Example: choose number '2': if you subtract one you'll be left with '1', which you can add back to return to '2' - the original number.  If you choose '3', subtract one and add three, and you're still left with '3' - the same as the original.  Example 2: choose number '12'.  Subtract one and add five.  Now add three so you have '6'.  Subtract 6-3 = 3 to return to your originail number.  Choice '4' is the simplest one to make, as 1 can be subtracted and 4 can be added to make '4'.  Choice '2' works in exactly the same way except '1' can only be added.  Choice '5' works the same as above except you subtract '5' and add one.  Which brings you back to '4'.  The final choice will seem very difficult to work out at first.  But remember how many times you can subtract/add one to return to your chosen number - '3' here.  Choose something like '14'.  Now subtract '4' and add one. You are then left with your origiinal number.  The answer is always '4'.  Why?<n>Output:  B<n><n>Input:My name is _____ and I’ll be your host for the next 22 minutes.

We better find another solution.<n>Let's define a `Counter` class:<n><n>```python<n>class Counter:<n>    def __init__(self, n, val, inc):<n>        self.count = 0<n>        self.n = n<n>        self.val = val<n>        self.inc = inc<n><n>    def increment(self):<n>        self.inc()<n><n>    def decrement(self):<n>        return self.val == 0<n>    def get(self):<n>        print(self.getCount())<n><n>```<n><n>A `Counter` class stores the

The program will take two variables from the system.  One, the price of the item being purchased, and two, the percentage of sales tax.  It should print the total price, the sales tax for the item, and print what fraction the tax makes up of the total price.  If the sales tax percentage results in a fraction that leaves a remainder such that the remainder is above 0.5 then your program should round up the total price, your final result should be rounded down if the fraction is below 0.5.<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the questions below the program.<n><n>In my program I used the concept of modulus.  You can take a number and divide it by another number.  Whatever is left over is called the remainder.  The result will either be a number or 0.  If it is a number we will call it "The remainder."  If the remainder is 0 or greater than 0.5 then we will round up.  Other than that nothing happens, it should be equivalent to the original result.  The program is written below:<n>```<n>def priceToTax():<n>    total = int(input("How much is the total to be purchased? "))<n>    percent = float(input("How much percent is the tax? "))<n><n>    if percent >= 0.5:<n>        remainder = total % percent<n><n>    else:<n>        remainder = (total - remainder) % percent<n><n>    total = total + remainder<n><n>    if remainder >= 0.5 :<n>        total = int(total)<n><n>    else: <n>        total = int((total - remainder))<n><n>    tax = total * percent<n><n>    price = input("What is the total sale price of the item?

Choices:  A: ignore B: write C: learn new things D: illiterate E: having fun<n>Output:		A: ignore<n><n>### Explanation:Explanation for the first question<n>If Mary had used the 3 large stickers, it should result in 26 stickers remaining, since 6+3 = 9. This contradicts the question, which states 44 stickers are left.<n><n>### Explnation:Explanation second question<n>If Zach have $65+$34 = 118 dollars. At least he need to make 5 dollars more.<n><n>###Explanation:Explanations of third question<n>If we use 4 to denote a leg, 23 kangeroos have 23*4 = 92 legs, and 3*4 = 12 more legs for the goats, we have a total of 1104 legs.<n><n>### explanation: Explanation for the fourth question:<n>Assuming the cookies cost 125 cents each, the total cost of the cookies is 1,25*4 = 50 dollars. So Josh must have an amount of 50 dollars left after buying the hats and pencils.<n><n>###explanation:<n>assume each round of bowling consists of 10 throws max. If the final game throws 4 rounds with an average of 287, the total number of throws would be 1144 pins. We subtract this from the total points scored so far, which should result in 10,486 points. If we subtract the average of the rest of the games so far from 1144, it will result in 96.<n><n>###expalanation:<n><n>we know that the time it takes for Max to finish one task from Biology equals 2/3. For geography we know that it takes one third as much as history. And for history, we know that it takes the most time, which means it takes twice as much time as the time it takes biology for Max to finish. Multipying this by the ratio biology : geography and subtracting the result from the total time Max spent on doing his homework shows us that the total time Max actually spent on doing his home work equals 20*log(20/4) = 20^1/6 = 20.<n><n>###

And you're asked to find  how many time these set of numbers is used in sequence?<n><n>Answer:<n>1. The number of times the sequence 2,3... 9 is used is 3.<n><n>Since 2,3...9 is exactly the sequence 1,2,3,4... 7,8,9. If you want to use the 8, you have to use 4 and then from 4 up to 9 if you want 8 in there. So if you're just dealing with 2,3,...,9, then there are 2 ways of using the number 3.<n>You could do it like (2)(3) and (2)(1)(3) or you could do it like (3)(2) and (3)(1)(2).<n>There are other ways but you're dealing with the same sequence, so there's only one value, or product of the values.<n>If you want to use the number 4 instead of the number 3, you have to use (3)(2) followed by (2)(2)(3) and then (3)(3) to get to the number 4.<n>If you want the number 5, you have to use then have to use (3) then followed by (2)(3) then followed by  (4) and then (5)(2)(3) to get four.<n>And so on until you get to the number 7, and only one way to get to that number.<n>So, (2)(3) (5)(6)(7) ((4)<n>And only one way to get that sequence in order.<n><n>2. For each of the three digits (2)(3)(4), there are 2 ways getting there - you could do those products by adding 2 (2)(3) to 1 (2)(3) or by adding (2)(3) + (2)(3)- (2)(3).<n>While for (5)(4) there is only a single (2)(3) at the start that when you get to that, there's only two ways to get (5)(3) (which means there is only one way to get (5)(5), then another two ways to get (1),

An adult person can walk around it in under 800 seconds. What is the maximum depth for a child (under 50cm) to swim in the pool?<n><n>**Solution**<n><n>Let’s solve this problem by first setting out an easier problem: How deep does a person have to dig to dig the hole for a pool?<n><n>The pool can be expressed as `area = 15 * length * width`, and depth represents `height * 1.05`<n><n>This equation becomes `height = 15 * (length * width) / (1.05 * width)`<n><n>We can substitute length into the equation to get `height = 14 * width / (1.01 * width)`, and now `width` is independent. Now, we solve for `width` using inverse logarithms `ln(x) / ln(1 / 1.01)`<n><n>The inverse value of `width` is 22.77m.<n><n>Substituting in our values, we get:<n><n>`depth = 1.11 * 22.7 = 25.405 m` or 25 meters<n><n>Substitututing this into the original problem gives you the original equation:<n><n>`side * 25 / 1.05 = 1800`<n><n>This gives us the following equation:<n><n>`25 * 1800 / 1.025 = 255`<n><n>Thus, the depth of the pool must be at least 255m deep for a child (or other small adult) to swim.<n><n>Input: There were 483 votes that had been cast in the election. 121 of the ballots were voided, as the ink on the ballots was smudged and illegible.

It takes approximately 2.5 gallons of gas to fill my car up. $0.30 per gallon of gas. My car has 12.3 miles per gallon in the city and 21.5 miles per gallon on a highway. If I drive a little more than 50 miles on the highway, I can get between 246-249 miles per tank of gas. The car has an 18 gallon gas tank. My car cost me $23,000 to buy new.

{"text": "A\n\nInput:The answer is always '4' (or '2', whatever).  However, I'll explain.  Choose a number, and then think about how many times you can add/subtract '1' so that the number is the chosen number (ie 3 + 1 = 4).  Then, say you want to get back to the chosen number to start all over.  You subtract one, and then add one.  Now take away the add/subtract you made and say you still have the answer.  Example: choose number '2': if you subtract one you'll be left with '1', which you can add back to return to '2' - the original number.  If you choose '3', subtract one and add three, and you're still left with '3' - the same as the original.  Example 2: choose number '12'.  Subtract one and add five.  Now add three so you have '6'.  Subtract 6-3 = 3 to return to your originail number.  Choice '4' is the simplest one to make, as 1 can be subtracted and 4 can be added to make '4'.  Choice '2' works in exactly the same way except '1' can only be added.  Choice '5' works the same as above except you subtract '5' and add one.  Which brings you back to '4'.  The final choice will seem very difficult to work out at first.  But remember how many times you can subtract/add one to return to your chosen number - '3' here.  Choose something like '14'.  Now subtract '4' and add one. You are then left with your origiinal number.  The answer is always '4'.  Why?\nOutput:  B\n\nInput:My name is _____ and I\u2019ll be your host for the next 22 minutes.

But, unfortunately, it is very slow. This is because we need to do `O(n)` multiplication operations, and it has `O(m)` repetitions.\nLet's consider the example above:\n- `n = 4`: 4 times 2 = 8, 8 - 2 = 6, 6 + 1 = 7.\n- `m = 4`: 36 * 4 ** * 4 = 35840.\nAs we can see, it will be much more than `2^65` (the possible number of strings). We better find another solution.\nLet's define a `Counter` class:\n\n```python\nclass Counter:\n    def __init__(self, n, val, inc):\n        self.count = 0\n        self.n = n\n        self.val = val\n        self.inc = inc\n\n    def increment(self):\n        self.inc()\n\n    def decrement(self):\n        return self.val == 0\n    def get(self):\n        print(self.getCount())\n\n```\n\nA `Counter` class stores the", "answer": "A: coffee"}

The program will take two variables from the system.  One, the price of the item being purchased, and two, the percentage of sales tax.  It should print the total price, the sales tax for the item, and print what fraction the tax makes up of the total price.  If the sales tax percentage results in a fraction that leaves a remainder such that the remainder is above 0.5 then your program should round up the total price, your final result should be rounded down if the fraction is below 0.5.\n\n### Instructions:Answer the questions below the program.\n\nIn my program I used the concept of modulus.  You can take a number and divide it by another number.  Whatever is left over is called the remainder.  The result will either be a number or 0.  If it is a number we will call it \"The remainder.\"  If the remainder is 0 or greater than 0.5 then we will round up.  Other than that nothing happens, it should be equivalent to the original result.  The program is written below:\n```\ndef priceToTax():\n    total = int(input(\"How much is the total to be purchased? \"))\n    percent = float(input(\"How much percent is the tax? \"))\n\n    if percent >= 0.5:\n        remainder = total % percent\n\n    else:\n        remainder = (total - remainder) % percent\n\n    total = total + remainder\n\n    if remainder >= 0.5 :\n        total = int(total)\n\n    else: \n        total = int((total - remainder))\n\n    tax = total * percent\n\n    price = input(\"What is the total sale price of the item? \")\n    fraction = (price % tax)\n    print((\"The total price is {0:.2f}\".format(total", "answer": "A: cold"}

For geography we know that it takes one third as much as history. And for history, we know that it takes the most time, which means it takes twice as much time as the time it takes biology for Max to finish. Multipying this by the ratio biology : geography and subtracting the result from the total time Max spent on doing his homework shows us that the total time Max actually spent on doing his home work equals 20*log(20/4) = 20^1/6 = 20.\n\n###", "answer": "D: illiterate"}

{"text": "A\nIn the problem 3, you're given a sequence 2,3,4,5... 9. And you're asked to find  how many time these set of numbers is used in sequence?\n\nAnswer:\n1. The number of times the sequence 2,3... 9 is used is 3.\n\nSince 2,3...9 is exactly the sequence 1,2,3,4... 7,8,9. If you want to use the 8, you have to use 4 and then from 4 up to 9 if you want 8 in there. So if you're just dealing with 2,3,...,9, then there are 2 ways of using the number 3.\nYou could do it like (2)(3) and (2)(1)(3) or you could do it like (3)(2) and (3)(1)(2).\nThere are other ways but you're dealing with the same sequence, so there's only one value, or product of the values.\nIf you want to use the number 4 instead of the number 3, you have to use (3)(2) followed by (2)(2)(3) and then (3)(3) to get to the number 4.\nIf you want the number 5, you have to use then have to use (3) then followed by (2)(3) then followed by  (4) and then (5)(2)(3) to get four.\nAnd so on until you get to the number 7, and only one way to get to that number.\nSo, (2)(3) (5)(6)(7) ((4)\nAnd only one way to get that sequence in order.\n\n2. For each of the three digits (2)(3)(4), there are 2 ways getting there - you could do those products by adding 2 (2)(3) to 1 (2)(3) or by adding (2)(3) + (2)(3)- (2)(3).\nWhile for (5)(4) there is only a single (2)(3) at the start that when you get to that, there's only two ways to get (5)(3) (which means there is only one way to get (5)(5), then another two ways to get (1),", "answer": "E: social bonding"}

You will ask them to raise their hand, then you go down every line, and count all the hands raised. You can also give them individual numbers and use count() to count every one individually.\n\nInput: 26 students each with ID number: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26\nOutput: 26\n\n#### Explanance:You'd like to count them. You will use the.join() function to join all the numbers by spaces, and then use.split(' ')[0], which is the first element, which is the ID number, while.split(' ')[1] can give you the quantity, which is the amount of students with that single ID number. Note that split() works on a string.\n\n```python\nnums = ['1','2','3']\nnums.join()\n```\nOutput: '1223'\n\n```python\n# split function that will separate the ID number from the quantity.\nsplit(' ')[0]\n```\nOutput: 1\n\n```python\nsplit(' ')[1])\n```\nOutput: ''\n\n```python\nstring = '12'\n\nnumber = string[0]\nquantity = int(string[1])\nprint(number)\nprint(quantity)\n```\nOutput:\n1\n2\n\n```\nnums = [5, 5, 10, 17, 19]\nnums_final = [num + str(b) + str(v) for num,b,v in zip(nums, nums[1:], nums[1:])]\nprint(nums_final)\n# if we want to skip the second numbers, we can just add the first and last elements to skip them\n```\nOutput: ['51022021917335']\n\n```python\ninput = \"1 - 5 - 7 - 2 - 0 -", "answer": "B: mall"}

What is the maximum depth for a child (under 50cm) to swim in the pool?\n\n**Solution**\n\nLet\u2019s solve this problem by first setting out an easier problem: How deep does a person have to dig to dig the hole for a pool?\n\nThe pool can be expressed as `area = 15 * length * width`, and depth represents `height * 1.05`\n\nThis equation becomes `height = 15 * (length * width) / (1.05 * width)`\n\nWe can substitute length into the equation to get `height = 14 * width / (1.01 * width)`, and now `width` is independent. Now, we solve for `width` using inverse logarithms `ln(x) / ln(1 / 1.01)`\n\nThe inverse value of `width` is 22.77m.\n\nSubstituting in our values, we get:\n\n`depth = 1.11 * 22.7 = 25.405 m` or 25 meters\n\nSubstitututing this into the original problem gives you the original equation:\n\n`side * 25 / 1.05 = 1800`\n\nThis gives us the following equation:\n\n`25 * 1800 / 1.025 = 255`\n\nThus, the depth of the pool must be at least 255m deep for a child (or other small adult) to swim.\n\nInput: There were 483 votes that had been cast in the election. 121 of the ballots were voided, as the ink on the ballots was smudged and illegible.

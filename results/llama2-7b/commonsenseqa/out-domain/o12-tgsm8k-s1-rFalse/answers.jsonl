He had a lot of what?  Choices: A: laughter B C: glee D E: opera F: injury\n\n### Multiple Choice\nA: The correct answer is C, \"glee.\" \"Injury\" does not fit the sentence, because it is not an emotion expressed in the question. There are four emotion words provided. The answer \"glee\" fits as Danny \"had a lot of\" something. \"Laughter\" is not an emotion, so it's not applicable. \"Opera\" is an action, so it wouldn't work as well and would not be relevant for \"had a lot of.\" Finally \"injuries\" is not an emoted feeling, so it's also a poor answer choice, and it would not fit the sentence.\n\n### Differences:\n\nExpected answer to be \"C: glee\"\n\n### Instructor notes:\nThe word \"glee\" fits the sentence, but has the connotation of a strong laugh. In this case, it would be better with \"gaiety.\" The word \"glee\" is also the title of a type of musical, but the question does not indicate any type of production.", "answer": "C: glee"}

The amount of words required to write a book are usually expressed in terms of pages, but we can easily assume that 4 words fit on a single line, since words are much shorter than sentences, and if a line is around 15-30 words long, then each page is only 15x4=60 words, so the book requires more than 4 (78000) words, which are too much to calculate in this way.\n\n### Input  \nSherry had more than 5 apples and less than 10.  How many apples does sherry have now?\n\n### Response  \nFour, because the number of apples cannot be calculated. A question that consists of less than 10 means that he does not know exactly the number of apples he has. Also, the less than part tells us that he must have more than 5 appples but less than 10, because the question says that he had more than 5 and less than 1. It means that, before, he had 10 apples. For us to know his new amount of apples, we need to subtract 10 from the less-than he had before, and we can say that the answer is 4 because that was the number of apples that he was left with after taking 10 apples away from his amount of apples.\n\n###Input  \nCraig's father asked each of Craig's five sisters to get a birthday card for him.

Use complete sentences and be sure to explain your answers. There is no minimum required length.\n\n### Introduction\nIn the past there has been a lot of talk about the \u201cgender bias\u201d of programming and research studies. In 1994, there were only two female faculty hired into computer science PhD programs in the entire US (Stillwell 1996). In 2012 at the university where I am enrolled right now, less than 20% of the undergraduate students in computer science are women, and less than 15% of the graduate students working towards a Masters of Science or Ph.D. in computer science. These statistics are not far off, in fact in 2014 the National Center for Education Statistics found that 14.7% of Bachelor's degrees in computer science were awarded to women.\n\nThere have also been many reports about young women leaving computer science at higher rates than young men. For example, in 2009 just over 61% of Computer Science degree recipients were men, and just 38.9% were women. By 2010, those numbers changed to 69.7% men, and 30.3% women. Between 2007 and 2012, over 5% more men than women were enrolled in bachelor degrees in Computer Science.\n\nIn 2015, Google announced it was going to hire a female employee every week for 18 months to try and fix the gender disparity in their workforce. This move is part of Google's Project Aristotle, with the project goals being stated as: to \"to ensure that great ideas can spread quickly and that we have as diverse a view of the issues as possible.\"\n\nFurthermore, Microsoft CEO, Satya Nadella came under fire when he commented \"not having, sort of like, male and female Brainteams\" at a Women at Microsoft event in May of 2014. As it turns out, about 89% of Microsoft's top executives are male (Peterson 2", "answer": "C: improved health"}

Recurring every Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday from the day class starts until the first day of final exams each year, each teacher provides a final test. If the grades on those 38 exams are sorted in from highest to lowest with no more than two test scores in a row being the same, the average of a teacher\u2019s tests will equal 85 out of a 100.

{"text": "If you go to any of the poorest countries in the world like India and Pakistan and ask people if they know of any children that are starving, they most certainly will say yes. Many times as a child in those countries, there just wasn't enough food to go around. That's why many kids are malnourished, and don't have strong bones or teeth. Also, kids who have these issues often aren't able to go to school because they have to work so they can help provide food. If a family is very poor then the parents will often let their kids work with no pay so that they can make some money. Children who don't have the proper food to eat don't always do well in school, especially when the children are malnourished.\n\n### Input-A B C D E\n\n### Response-C\n\n### Input :  A group of people are standing in a line and waiting for food to be given away.

The grocery also has on sale a 4 lb package of pork and salmon sausage for $6.99.  You have $20 but have no way to weigh either food. How do you know what food is less expensive per pound based on that information? (Note: We could say $7.99/20 and $/6.99=2.3742 pounds, in which case the pork loin would be cheaper by $2.37 a pound.  Alternatively, we could say $20-$6.99=$13.01.  If we say that each piece of sausage contains 2.35 pounds, the cost per pound for sausage is $13.01/2.35 = $5.44)  (Note: The question is referring to a food scale - a pound is 8 ounces.

So, we\u2019re going to use panels of solar cells laminated to sheets of glass. Each sheet needs to be strong, but light, so we\u2019ve chosen the glass we want most of all. We will build the frame using some stiff metal tubing then make sure everything is strong enough to hold the sheet and solar cells.  The panel will be attached to a metal frame attached to a car, and a car is the most cost-effective choice as the target vehicle is a Ford Model T.\n\nWe\u2019re planning an area in the back room in the engineering department to build the solar panel.  We\u2019ll have some tools \u2013 a soldering iron, a welder, a couple of wrenches and a drill.  You can come borrow these tools if you\u2019d like (please make sure you mark down their locations then return them).\n\nThe materials we will be using for this project include the panels of glass, tubing, and the cells made of silicon, we'll also need lots of tools like a soldering iron and metal scraps.

The reason behind this is that, airing out helps to reduce the odor of clothes.  Other than this, airing out prevents clothes from becoming smelly.  This action is recommended by most doctors because this is the safest method to remove odor from clothes.  It is helpful because no chemicals are added to it.

There are different types of multiple-choice questions: questions that have more than one right answer might be easier to solve or provide more practice. The next example is a multiple-choice problem solved with more than one solution.\n\n### Example:\nInput: The sum of two consecutive numbers is 198.

There are two types of squares: positive squares and negative squares. Therefore, the sum of squares cannot be negative as in the last answer.\n\nIf we need to square a number, we have to apply an exponent \"**2**\". Therefore, we cannot apply an exponent to negative numbers.\n\n### Next Chapter\n\nWe'll now examine an example to understand this concept.\n\n### Input\nFind the value of the **2** exponent to the square root of 36.\n\n### Response\nThe square root of 30 is \u221a30=5.893.  Therefore, the value of **2** to the square root of **36** is 5.893**2=32.286 or 32.3.\n\n### The \"sqrt\" function\nThe \"sqrt\" function is used to calculate the square root of a number. We have to enter the number and square root operator, and we'll get the square root of the number in the result.\n\n### Solve Example\nInput: Find the value of ______ and solve the system of equations. 4x +", "answer": "D: shopping mall"}

The faces have 2/3 empty spaces. This leaves 6*(2/3) = 4 empty spaces inside the cube and 6*(1/3) = 2 cubes of water. A cubed of ice weighs 9.9/10 of its volume of water. Therefore it will weigh 9.9/4 = 2.45.\nAnother way of working it out is: 4*(1/3) will be all the water outside (2 cubes), 3*(2/3) will be the water inside the cube (4.5 cubes), and 1/3 of that will be water (1.5 cups). Therefore the total weight of ice on the cube will be 9.9*6 + 1.5 = 2.54 cups of water.\n\n### Your computer\u2019s hard drive has a capacity to hold 500 billion bytes of data.

Choices:  (A) 10 hours (B) 4 hours (C) 2 hours (D) 8 hours (E) 1 hour\n\n### ResponseAnswer the given multiple-choice question. Show your reasoning.\n\n#### Answer\n\nC\nWhen Sam begins driving, let time=t and elevation=e.\nWe see that the formula to find time is time = e / 40 + 86.  Sam will need 86 minutes to get to 286 meters.  Sam will need to do 1 hour /286 for 1.01365121408302598 minutes.  That is 1 hour and 7 minutes.  When Sam begins he is already at 286 meters so he adds 286-0=286 to the formula for time to get time=e/40+286.  Sam is driving at 40 KPH but the time to travel 286 meters is really 300 meters.  Sam's formula for time is time=((286+300)/40)+86.  Sam's final answer is 2 hours and 7 minutes.\n\n### ResponseIf Sam needs to drive a distance of 842 meters, how many hours will he need to get there while speeding at an average speed of 114 kilometers per hour?

{"text": "Discomfort\n\n### Justify your answer:The question asks what was happening to Bill, which refers to Bill's physiological state, not his mental state. As a result, it is clear that he is not awaking in a mental state of getting out of bed, and would not describe himself getting up like that. If he was tired, he would know it. He would feel it, he would feel grogginess. He is not feeling grogginess; he is only feeling that he is not in a good physiological state.\n\nBill is awaking from sleep. He is discontent with his physiological state, but not in any particular way. In fact, he can describe it with one word, \"discomfort\". Given this, \"grogginess\" would not be possible, because it describes a certain state of mind rather than a state of physique. \"Grogginess\" implies that he's feeling tired, but the question explicitly asked if he was awake in his sleep. If he was in deep sleep, he would not be experiencing tiredness or grogginess, he would simply be awaking.\n\n### Input:\"I went to the movie with my friends and got some snacks and popcorn.\" What was the main purpose for your action described above?\n\n### Demostration:My friends and I went to a movie. We got some snacks and then we got some popcorn.\n\n### Response:\"I was socializing with my friends.\"\n\n### Justfiy your answer:The stated reason was \"I went to the movie\". The question did not ask about why they went to the movie, but about your own motives. If the group went to the movie to socialize, then it's not you who's going there to socialize. What we know about the group's motive tells us that they went there to watch a movie. The question asks about your motive. It does not mention any more information about the group's reason for going to the movie. That should not affect your answer.\n\nThe question could have been phrased, \"Was your primary reason to get some snacks?\" But the phrase \"the main purpose\" already strongly suggests a single overarching reason for the whole event. That would explain why the author chose to use \"the entire purpose\" instead of another phrase with similar meaning", "answer": "E: eyes opening"}

While exploring, they notice a set of tracks heading south. They\u2019re unsure of whether or not the inhabitants can communicate with each other and decide to follow the path. After covering a few miles, they determine that some of tracks are from the same pair of people. The astronauts continue to follow the path, hoping to eventually see a creature. Several hours later, they suddenly come across one of the creatures. When the astronauts notice it, the creature turns around and runs away. The astronauts decide to follow the creature, assuming it to be their friend. After running for an hour, the creature stops by a cave. Out of pure exhaustion, the group falls asleep.

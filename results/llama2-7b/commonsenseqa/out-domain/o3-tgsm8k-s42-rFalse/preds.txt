I’ve watched their lives and experiences, their stories, their ups and downs, their pains and joys. I saw how much hardship my father has endured from early days in the war  till today. He was a freedom fighter and he was an outlaw for a long time of his life for he defied his country’s ruler at that time because of his courage and high values. His courage and bravery enable him to do what he did. He was never afraid to confront the government. He was imprisoned, he was flogged, he was beaten and he was almost in total loss of life, but he endured such treatment. I think of my parents’ sacrifices and determination. They were determined to be born with the freedom to choose their own paths. Freedom has brought them a lot. They have enjoyed a lot of freedom and they have seen the benefits they have achieved. Now they  are in a comfortable life.<n><n>For transportation from one place to another, I used to take the motorcycle, the bus or the car. I used to take my car, it helped me to arrive at my destinations much faster. I used to take the bike for a short distance trip and for short distances it would be much faster than anything else. It would be also more comfortable and faster at certain times of the year. The car is faster and more comfortable.<n><n>For my first degree I used books as transport, and in my next degree I used cars and motorcycles and for going to places far away I used aeroplanes or helicopters or trains. For my current study I just used the internet when I have assignments and for communication I used phone, chat or emails to communicate with other students from all over the world. I use the cars for commuting or my own transport for going to the superstores.<n><n>### Response 2<n><n>In my first degree, most of the subjects, I used

Moreover, if you wore the white shoe left foot only, your right foot would be dirty as well from walking around and it would also not be wearing a white sock, so it's not clear to me why the question is asking about white shoes.

The main reason for that is because 'cargo ship','refrigerator' and 'food' do not contain the word 'goods', which is required to meet the question requirements. Secondly, after unloading the goods, they are usually 'transported to warehouse' or 'dispatched to another place', not 'port'. I believe I am correct? So far I haven't came across the word transport in relation to unloading goods.<n><n>### Input (2):<n>A man made 9 t-shirts and sold 16 t-shirts. How many of each type of shirt were sold?

By providing examples written by a chat bot might increase the likelihood that your AI has context in which to generate your responses. If the data is not relevant, it is easy to ignore or disregard it, and the data will not be used in the AI generation. To avoid situations like this it is important to check data beforehand to make sure that your data is worth learning from. Some AI’s create irrelevant data from irrelevant input. This is where the creators make mistakes in their choice to model certain types of scenarios. If the situation is highly context dependent and relies on prior historical context, this might not be necessary as it might provide sufficient information to infer what the context is and the responses generated. However, for my case, we are not dealing with complex context dependent situations and would therefore need to explicitly provide the context before the learning could be modelled and inferences could then be generated.<n><n><n><n>

He knows from experience that 80 pages is one inch thick. If he has 6 books, how many pages is each one on average?<n>Answer: 160<n><n>### Input:What is the result of instituting civil action? Choices:  A: bad feelings B: confusion C: going to court D: hurt feelings E: sandwiches<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The result of instituting a civil law suit is the instituting of a civil court case. If the court case cannot be amicably settled then the suit can be brought into civil proceedings. A civil action is instituted through the invoking of the court. This process may ultimately cause bad feelings because legal actions can be long, costly and ultimately have negative outcomes (if the lawsuit is lost).<n><n>## TFQ:What is the difference between civil and criminal court?<n><n>### Input<n><n>The criminal court is a court where criminal prosecution is brought.<n><n>The civil court is a court where a lawsuit is brought civilly.<n><n>### Response<n><n>One difference is that the criminal court and the civil court are different because they have different purposes, one being to bring about criminal prosecution and the other being to bring a law suit. Second, another difference is that they use different rules of evidence: at the civil trial, you can only use evidence on points you have pleaded, for example, if you claim that the defendant was drunk, then you can only use circumstantial evidence - however, in the criminal trial, you may only use whatever evidence you have at hand, which may not be relevant.<n><n>### Question<n><n>If John Smith is brought to be tried at a criminal court, the defendant would have __________ to plead guilty or to take the case to trial.<n><n>### Answer<n><n>John Smith would be given the chance to plead guilty or plead 'not guilty'. If he pleads guilty then the criminal case ends. If he chooses not to plead guilty then the case goes to trial. A criminal trial is one that is conducted by a judge and a jury.<n><n>### Why do I need to learn all these rules for civil service and civil actions?<n><n>Answers: Because you need to know the rules for civil suit so you can make informed decisions. I would also like you to have this information if you plan to be a civil service lawyer in future.<n><n>### In class today we reviewed civil suits and why we need to get one.<n><n>Answers (1): You can seek compensation for damages, or, to prove that a civil wrong has been done.<n><n>Ans: Because a civil case is often more expensive, so you first need to hire a lawyer

Choices:  A: water fountain B: military base C: apartment D: fire house E: bus stop<n><n>### Response:		Answer Question C. For instance, imagine a line of people waiting to get a bus into the city, or for a water fountain in a park. All people waiting for the bus and the water fountain will have a need or want. While a soldier leaving the base will not. If you are still unsure, refer to question 1 at the start of the test. You can go to that one if you are still not sure to help you review.<n><n>### Input2: Jack has 12 cans of cat food. The cans cost him a total of $0.80. Jack wants to feed one cat with the smallest number of cans he can. How many dollars will Jack spend per can?<n>Answer3: How much money does Jack have now?<n><n>### Input4:<n>Jane wants to spend as much of a given amount as possible on canned soup. She sees various packages of soup. For 4 cups of the soup, she can get a package for $1.99. 5-cup package for $1.75, and the 12-cup package for $2.99. Which is the better bargain?<n>Answer4: Refer to this table to help find out which price is best for her:<n>| $/cup | 1 | 2 | 4 | 5 | 12 | --- | --- | --- |<n>|---|---|---|:---:|:---:|---:|:---|:---:<n>| $1.99 | 0.50  | 0.48  | 0.25  | 0.18  | 0 | 3.99 |<n>| $1.75 | 0.46  | 0.39  | 0.09  |<n>| $2.99 | 3.00  | 2.00  |<n><n>A quick way to solve this is adding up the columns from left to right to find out the least expensive option. For instance, for 5 cups at $1.75 it would be $0.35. So the most cost effective option is the 5-cup package ( $1.75/5). The answer also shows that the 12- cups was the least efficient use of money out

Choices:  A: south pacific B: sea world C: pacific ocean D: indian ocean E: gulf of mexico<n><n>### Response:		<n>Sharks can be viewed up close at a number of aquariums. It is a popular place for people to visit. Some aquarium are located in the world, such as Sea World and Ocean World. Other aquariums are found in the sea, such as the Sea Garden Aquarium and Ocean World. The answer to the question is A. This is because the South Pacific is an area of the ocean that has large bodies of coral, which can be seen as sharks swim around them. The sharks can be viewed from the coral itself, or even within the aquarium itself. The aquariums were filled with animals found in the Pacific. The South Pacific is an area found in the Pacific Ocean located mostly between South America and South Africa. It contains some of the world's largest corals. The corals have grown over time making them quite large. These corals can be seen throughout much of the south pacific, but are especially visible near New Guinea. New Guinea is a large island located in the south pacific. It is located about two thousand miles off the coast of Australia. It extends from India to the Philippines and north to New Guinea. The corals of New Guinea were used to build many of the large underwater cities found in the area. These corals also provide a place for animals to live, such as the Shark. The South Pacific is well known for its corals and they are a beautiful sight to behold.<n>

Explain how your response differs from the responses of other students.<n><n>### Response 1:<n>Choices: Get smart is important. You can only get smart through hard work and determination by getting and using the knowledge given by the people who teach the school class. In school, you learn different things that you can use when you're older: like working in an office, a shop, a building site, factories, farming, etc. In school years, there is a teacher, called a "schoolmaster" or a "schoolmistress". Each is responsible for a specific number of pupils. Usually the "schoolmaster" and "schoolmistress" is older than the students. The "schoolmaster" and the "schoolmistress is called "teacher" or "professor". A good teacher explains and helps the children to learn the content of each subject that he or she teaches. In the classroom (room where there are many desks or tables, where pupils go to learn), there are books, magazines, newspapers, computers, etc.<n><n>Without school you could not learn anything. This is another good reason to spend time in school.<n><n>I learned many things in school :  Reading, Writing, Doing Maths, Sciences, History, Geography, Music, Philosophy, etc. <n><n>School is essential because school has many activities that develop us: Reading, Writing, Counting, Maths, etc. I learned how write my name in capital letters, how to write small letters, my letters that begin with an a or an e, my letters that begin an i, my letters that begin a o or an u, my letters that begin another letter that is not e, i, o and u. I learned how to write numbers, addition and subtraction, multiplication and division, etc. I learned about the different countries in the world, about planets, the sun and the moon, the four seasons, the different animals in the zoo, the weather, etc. I learned of the past, present and future. A past means what happened in the past and when it happened. The present tells us about this moment and in the future we look into the future. History

If it is true, write "True" If it is false, write "False"?<n><n>A <n>B<n>C <n>D<n>### Demonstraion<n>Input: 6/3 <n>Answer True<n>Explanation:<n>This is because, if a/b is true in division, we don't have to do the second part (b/c). 6 is dividable by 3 without any carry over.<n><n>### Explanaton:<n>This problem requires basic mathematical knowledge. The student is required to solve simple division involving rational and fractions numbers.<n><n>### Solution:<n>1. In the first example, the quotient of division is $1/96$ which is $1/9$, which equals an integer that has a carry over. This is because, in division a carry over is only permitted when a quotient equals to an integer that carries one.<n>2. In the second example, the quotient or division is $24/9$. We can see that a carry over is not permitted because the two numbers in the quotient are both less than $10$, and do not have a carry over.<n><n>The second example is more confusing to student without prior knowledge on divison because the student does not understand when a carry over is permitted.<n><n><n>### Input B:I can eat 35 chocolates in every minute. The number of minutes I can eat in an hour is 21.How many chocolates do I eat each hour.<n><n>A. 30<n>B. 21<n>C. 15<n>D. 7<n>E. 35<n><n>### Answer A.<n>### Explananation<n>I divide 35 by 20, and find that I eat 1 every minute. This number is then multiplied by 21 which equals 55 minutes. 55 is divided by 35 to find out the number of chocolates I eat each hour<n><n>### Diffrence A: The student is asked to write the difference between an expression, and an equation in their response

Choices:  A: exhilaration B: dismemberment C: spinal injuries D: getting wet E: splats<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>> Example: Aaron dives off the cliff off that cliff but instead of flying like a bird or soaring like an eagle, he just makes a giant water drop.<n><n>#### Explain your answer: The first choice is exhilaration. Exhilaration means a good feeling you feel after doing something, but diving off a cliff is one of the worse ways or activities you can imagine doing. The second one is spinal injuries, but spinal injury do occur when diving off cliff and it does not always results from a cartoon character. Spinal injuries would be one of the worse results to be when diving off a cliffs, so we can definitely eliminate spinal injuries. Dismemberment: the third choice can also be used to describe the situation as one choice. As you can see, people will get wet after diving off a clif even if it is a cartoon character.<n><n>Explanation from the user (Matt):<n><n>Dismemberment is when someone does something bad and they get in trouble or hurt from it. This is a perfect example of a person diving off a cliffe and he gets hurt because he is getting wet because of the water.<n><n>### Input:"Coffee in the morning is what makes everything else in your day better."

Choices:  A: trouser leg B: sick bay C: own home D: petting zoo E: mother's hair<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>-   Explanation: "Getting lots of attention" does not specify which type of attention. There are many animals that fit this description. An amphibian needs warm conditions with moisture. So, a ferret is not getting lots of attention in a bathroom or kitchen or trash can. And, ferrets don't like to be patted or held. There are no ferret kennels at schools. There are no ferrets in "petting zoos," which do not pay attention to any specific animal. And, a ferret is most commonly found in its own home. (It is only at "owners' houses and apartments" that it might be getting lots of attention. Ferrets are not getting special attention when their owners take them to the vet, where they undergo medical treatments. Finally, the only answer that makes sense is that the ferret is likely to be found in its own home.)<n>-   Other possible responses:<n>-   <n>-<n>-   Notes:<n><n>-   For more guidance, use the  "Follow Along" and "Solution" buttons.

I think that it is important to use this kind of question in order for people to learn. I was going to ask something more complex but I am still getting used to stackoverflow and stackoverflow is hard and I just thought that this would help me get used to it faster and I don't want to post a question that will bring up stupid answers. I like posting questions that are complex because I know I will learn a lot by figuring out how to explain it. I also find it interesting how people just have a hard time explaining these things. I think it is weird that most people could never explain complicated questions. I think it is also hard because I think that most people think that you learn everything but we don't. I know that I don't know everything and that I learned something new today by reading this post. If you want to learn something you have to figure it out even if you don't know how to do it.<n><n>---<n>

Choices:  A: thrift store B: bed C: shelf D: home E: toy store<n><n>### Response:		If you go to a thrift store, they may not have a teddy bear, but you can often find old and worn toys there. An employee would check to make sure the toy is in good condition. You need to bring your own money to buy a teddy, because it would not have an expiration date, as the stores only take their own money and do not charge the customer. If you want to buy a new teddy bear and get someone to help you buy the teddy bear, you should go to a toy store. A toy store would almost always have a teddy bear. The teddy bear in a toy store is also often in its original packaging, which the parent can be sure the child will receive in mint condition. If you want someone to buy the teddy bear for you, you should head to a home store. A home store would likely only sell teddies as a gift and would not likely keep teddies on hand all the time. The employee would be happy to help you buy a new or old teddy bear. However, that employee will only use the store’s cash, so bring your own to help pay for the teddy bear. The money would be inexpensive as it is only used for purchasing new products and is not considered expended. A store that only sells goods in their natural environment is a place in nature. The toy store would likely be this. A doll and dollhouse are in a different shape than a teddy bear and would not be a doll, so they are not sold in the same place. The teddy bear would be inexpensive and likely not sold in a thrift store. Therefore, a thrift store would not sell a teddy bear.<n><n>### Input How may times does 279 go into 1906?<n><n>### Response A: We have the same remainder: 1906 ÷ (279 x 1) = 1906 D: We have the same value: 1900<n>### Input 8 is to 7 as 39 is to what number<n><n>### Response B: 9 <n>### Input: You can measure the age of your pet by calculating how much longer their birthday is than their yearly age.

Write a response to the product. <n>### Demonstation:<n>Input: When you take out a car loan, you have to pay two kinds of fees when the loan ends: closing costs on the loan and capitalized interest. To get rid of closing costs on the loan, you have to send the dealer a check for the amount of the closing costs. The money goes into a trust account from which the dealer takes his cut and then pays your bank. The capitalized interest fee is a bank fee that gets added to the loan if you don't pay it in full when the loan ends. This fee depends on the length of the loan. The money the bank makes on your loan plus the other fees and your money goes to the bank.

Choices:  A: home B: hardware store C: home D: hot room E: office<n><n>### Response:		The right answer is B (hardware store). The text says somebody, so it doesn’t say everybody. This means that it doesn’t say there are more than one fans in every house, instead it says that one fan is in more than one house. The sentence could also be describing that the question is about more than one fan and that there are more than one electric fans in a hardware store. The sentence doesn’t say how many fans are in a home. All the other answers don’t make sense, so option B must be the correct answer.<n><n>### Input  : Which is a greater value? 36 or 57. Choices: A  B  C  D<n><n>### Response  : The option C (61/84) is the right answer, because no other answer can make a multiple of 61/84 with the given value.<n><n>### Question - 10:<n>Input:  In 2092 there will be twice as many cars as in 2001.If you drive a 2001 car, how old will you be? Choices: A - 76 years old B - 56 years old C - 96 years old D - 36 years old<n><n>### Response : If you drive a 2,001 car in 2092, you will be 76 years old then. In 2091, you will also be 56 years old if you drive a 2.001 car. But not all years have 2,000 cars. If in 1992, there were 56 million 2,002 cars, in 2002, there were 108 million cars of the same size. In 2002 a car of the same year was 2 million 2,022 and 2,003 in 2013.

Example 12:13, will give me yes(should be 12pm) because it looks like you have 5 after 12 (for 12pm) and then it has 13 (which is 13pm, so no 12 in the hour. Or 12:11 because that was just before 12pm. 12:14 is before 12pm, and so on. I don't need to be able to do dates, but the time portion is a must. I've attached a document that provides clarity of my thoughts, for example I typed "11:58" into the document, you will see in the document that it should say yes for 11am and not pm, or 12pm for 12pm pm or 1:pm and so on.

He was known for being humble and wise. He had courage and compassion for all those who loved him. B) Our parents always told us his story. C) It was such a good story that we loved to pass it down to our future generations. D) He was kind to all, but a select few had turned against him. E) The king’s reign would make history because it was the only generation that can call themselves children of “The King”.<n><n>### Response (type here):<n>A) A great story is great because in it people are able to see themselves in the characters. People can identify with someone if they know them well or have read about them before.

This makes them want to live their life as if this was the case; but this would never be the case for anyone unless they were born into royalty.<n>

The smallest possible number is -1 and you just keep subtracting that from the next number, and then add the largest number possible in this scenario, which is infinity. You will always be able to count down by one. If you can count down, and you can count backward, then you can count to infinity. <n><n>### Example Input - You have a 43kg weight on one end and another 41 kg weight on the other end, which end do you pull on first?

Choices:  A: garage B: hospital C: boat D: house E: doll house<n><n>### Response:		Option B<n>[!INCLUDE[crabout](../../shared/includes/crabout-md.md)] A hospital is the most likely place to have a lot of extinguishers. An extinguisher is used for putting out a fire, so the only choice involving fire is "B". The exits of a hospital is another reason why a hospital would need more than three extinguishers in order for it to work properly. And also, a hospital is one of the places that have a chance of an electrical fire. And to put out electrical fires, they use extinguishers to put out fires.<n><n>### Input:"Sally is five and a half times as old as her brother, and her brother is one third as old as their dad."<n><n>### Response"Sally's father will turn __29__ this year."<n><n>### Explanation: Sally’s age is five and a half(+1/2) times her brother’s brother’s age. Her brother’s age is three times her brother’s age. Sally’s age and the age of her brother multiplied by three(+3) plus five and a half(5.5) equals six (+16). Six divided by three equals two (2). Sally is five and a halve times her brothers age equals two and a half times her brother’s(2.5) age). Two and a half divided by three equals one and a half (+1.5). 1.5 times a brother’s age equals 1.5(+0.33) times a brother’s(2). 2 divided by three equals 0.66 times a brother. Finally 29 rounded up is equal to 0.66(2) times 43(+43) which rounds to 0.67, which is equal to 29(+29). So, that is why Sally’s dad will turn 29 years old.<n><n>### Exercises<n>1.<n>Sara put 24 pennies in a piggy bank. At the end of 4 weeks, she put another $20 worth of coins into the piggy bank.

How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jack has a stack of books that is 12 inches thick. He knows from experience that 80 pages is one inch thick. If he has 6 books, how many pages is each one on average?<n>Answer: 160<n><n>### Input:Janet knew she was dying from her injuries because she could feel herself doing what? Choices:  A: sleeping longer B: getting cold C: death and decay D: change of color E: stop breathing<n><n>### Response:		If you look at a word like Janet, you can see the word has a "t" instead of an "i". That is because English is a language based on sounds, but not on letters. The letter "t" isn't pronounced at the end of words, it is pronounced to sound like the letter "d". But, in this case, we have an exception, because the "t" makes the word "die". If it was written "di", it would mean "be happy". English is based on sounds, so don't worry too much about what you're reading.

Choices:  A: pain B: mudslide C: sweating D: injuries E: rain<n><n>### Response:		The input asks to explain why professionals playing sports could not compete due to injuries and mudslides. Professionals playing sports could not play due to injuries. Injuries could occur if professionals play sports and they could not play again because they did not know if the injuries will return or not. Injuries can bring professionals to quit during the sport if they do not know if they could move their arm because they are in pain. Another reason is mud slide because there was too much mud on the floor and people could not see in mud. Mud slide has happened before and many people died in the mud because they did not know the floor because of the mud. People could not see properly and some people fell and died because of the mud.<n><n>### Input : Betty picked 16 Strawberries.

In this module, you will work in your online team space to complete two (2) activities and evaluate the process you used to complete these activities, using an Excel spreadsheet. The Excel spreadsheet will be the documentation you complete to demonstrate you have met the module objectives and to pass the course.<n><n>### Response<n><n>The task description states that “you will work” in your team space.  Does your team have a space where you can submit your Excel spreadsheet? The two activities are completed by the team and then one person (who is chosen to be an “evaluator” within the team) will submit the Excel spreadsheet.  The team is asked to create the spreadsheet in their team space but the evaluation requires the documentation to be submitted in another location.  The task direction states that these activities MUST BE COMPLETED WITHIN A TEAM SPACE. No evaluation will be accepted if it is submitted in a different location than your team space or in a document uploaded to the Learning Hub.<n><n>If the task is revised to request the task to be completed within only a team space, then the directions would be unclear. There could be no doubt:  you would need to submit the documentation and evaluation in the team space.  There would be no room for confusion about where you must submit the documentation and evaluation.  <n><n>

I\u2019ve watched their lives and experiences, their stories, their ups and downs, their pains and joys. I saw how much hardship my father has endured from early days in the war  till today. He was a freedom fighter and he was an outlaw for a long time of his life for he defied his country\u2019s ruler at that time because of his courage and high values. His courage and bravery enable him to do what he did. He was never afraid to confront the government. He was imprisoned, he was flogged, he was beaten and he was almost in total loss of life, but he endured such treatment. I think of my parents\u2019 sacrifices and determination. They were determined to be born with the freedom to choose their own paths. Freedom has brought them a lot. They have enjoyed a lot of freedom and they have seen the benefits they have achieved. Now they  are in a comfortable life.\n\nFor transportation from one place to another, I used to take the motorcycle, the bus or the car. I used to take my car, it helped me to arrive at my destinations much faster. I used to take the bike for a short distance trip and for short distances it would be much faster than anything else. It would be also more comfortable and faster at certain times of the year. The car is faster and more comfortable.\n\nFor my first degree I used books as transport, and in my next degree I used cars and motorcycles and for going to places far away I used aeroplanes or helicopters or trains. For my current study I just used the internet when I have assignments and for communication I used phone, chat or emails to communicate with other students from all over the world.

The more the tanks, the better the chances of a tank.\n3. The number of tickets is determined by dividing the number of pins per tank by the number of tickets.\n\t- The more pins, the harder the chances are of a tank.\n4. The number of pins and tanks is the same in both cases, and the same number is used in both cases by dividing the number pins by the number of pills per ticket.\n\t- We do not expect the number of tickets to be the same, but the same number is expected.\n\t- This is the same in the cases of driving and getting pins.\n\t\t- Driving is an activity, which involves pins, so the number of pins and tickets will be the same.\n\t- Therefore, 15 tanks can fit in the tank.\n\t\n<img src=\"figures/car_movement0.png\"/>\n\n### Input D: A\n\n## Solution 2: Moving cars entails\nThere are always 4 cars moving.\n\nThere are 12 cars in a tank.

{"text": "The result of instituting a civil law suit is the instituting of a civil court case. If the court case cannot be amicably settled then the suit can be brought into civil proceedings. A civil action is instituted through the invoking of the court. This process may ultimately cause bad feelings because legal actions can be long, costly and ultimately have negative outcomes (if the lawsuit is lost).\n\n## TFQ:What is the difference between civil and criminal court?\n\n### Input\n\nThe criminal court is a court where criminal prosecution is brought.\n\nThe civil court is a court where a lawsuit is brought civilly.\n\n### Response\n\nOne difference is that the criminal court and the civil court are different because they have different purposes, one being to bring about criminal prosecution and the other being to bring a law suit. Second, another difference is that they use different rules of evidence: at the civil trial, you can only use evidence on points you have pleaded, for example, if you claim that the defendant was drunk, then you can only use circumstantial evidence - however, in the criminal trial, you may only use whatever evidence you have at hand, which may not be relevant.\n\n### Question\n\nIf John Smith is brought to be tried at a criminal court, the defendant would have __________ to plead guilty or to take the case to trial.\n\n### Answer\n\nJohn Smith would be given the chance to plead guilty or plead 'not guilty'. If he pleads guilty then the criminal case ends. If he chooses not to plead guilty then the case goes to trial. A criminal trial is one that is conducted by a judge and a jury.\n\n### Why do I need to learn all these rules for civil service and civil actions?\n\nAnswers: Because you need to know the rules for civil suit so you can make informed decisions. I would also like you to have this information if you plan to be a civil service lawyer in future.\n\n### In class today we reviewed civil suits and why we need to get one.\n\nAnswers (1): You can seek compensation for damages, or, to prove that a civil wrong has been done.\n\nAns: Because a civil case is often more expensive, so you first need to hire a lawyer", "answer": "C: going to court"}

The syntax of case statement should be \n```\ncase (or switch): //case or switch statement, case should begin with capital letter, switch should begin with lower case letter.\n    case 12: //this is \"if\" statement\n        answer = 12;\n    break;\n``` \nThe `12` in the code above must be same as your target answer.\n\nFor other syntax, you can refer [here](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_switch.asp) website.\n\n### Tech Tip\uff1a\n* There are two ways to read the instructions, first is read the question \n\n* If the task ask me to do something, then you should do that task without thinking too much.\n\n* If the question is about reading the description/input, first check if the task has any description \n\n  Then you need to first check whether you can answer this problem in accordance with the explanation(answer) in the case description\n\n* And you need to make a reasonable and sufficient response, you need to try your best to answer the question.", "answer": "E: urinate"}

Jack wants to feed one cat with the smallest number of cans he can. How many dollars will Jack spend per can?\nAnswer3: How much money does Jack have now?\n\n### Input4:\nJane wants to spend as much of a given amount as possible on canned soup. She sees various packages of soup. For 4 cups of the soup, she can get a package for $1.99. 5-cup package for $1.75, and the 12-cup package for $2.99.

For instance, for 5 cups at $1.75 it would be $0.35. So the most cost effective option is the 5-cup package ( $1.75/5).

Explain how your response differs from the responses of other students.\n\n### Response 1:\nChoices: Get smart is important. You can only get smart through hard work and determination by getting and using the knowledge given by the people who teach the school class. In school, you learn different things that you can use when you're older: like working in an office, a shop, a building site, factories, farming, etc. In school years, there is a teacher, called a \"schoolmaster\" or a \"schoolmistress\". Each is responsible for a specific number of pupils. Usually the \"schoolmaster\" and \"schoolmistress\" is older than the students. The \"schoolmaster\" and the \"schoolmistress is called \"teacher\" or \"professor\". A good teacher explains and helps the children to learn the content of each subject that he or she teaches. In the classroom (room where there are many desks or tables, where pupils go to learn), there are books, magazines, newspapers, computers, etc.\n\nWithout school you could not learn anything. This is another good reason to spend time in school.\n\nI learned many things in school :  Reading, Writing, Doing Maths, Sciences, History, Geography, Music, Philosophy, etc. \n\nSchool is essential because school has many activities that develop us: Reading, Writing, Counting, Maths, etc. I learned how write my name in capital letters, how to write small letters, my letters that begin with an a or an e, my letters that begin an i, my letters that begin a o or an u, my letters that begin another letter that is not e, i, o and u. I learned how to write numbers, addition and subtraction, multiplication and division, etc. I learned about the different countries in the world, about planets, the sun and the moon, the four seasons, the different animals in the zoo, the weather, etc. I learned of the past, present and future.

This company did not allow the customers to be able to choose the shipping location, so when I clicked on the checkout button, I was sent to the website of the courier company to finish the procedure.

I placed my finger on the search field and entered the name of the company that I wanted to return the book to. I got 2 results, and after choosing one, I got the result pages. One of the result pages was the location address page. This result page contained the location address of the courier office where I was going to return the book.\n\nHowever, when looking at the map of the location, I found the courier office located at the corner of the country in the north that I have never heard of.

If it is true, write \"True\" If it is false, write \"False\"?\n\nA \nB\nC \nD\n### Demonstraion\nInput: 6/3 \nAnswer True\nExplanation:\nThis is because, if a/b is true in division, we don't have to do the second part (b/c). 6 is dividable by 3 without any carry over.\n\n### Explanaton:\nThis problem requires basic mathematical knowledge. The student is required to solve simple division involving rational and fractions numbers.\n\n### Solution:\n1. In the first example, the quotient of division is $1/96$ which is $1/9$, which equals an integer that has a carry over. This is because, in division a carry over is only permitted when a quotient equals to an integer that carries one.\n2. In the second example, the quotient or division is $24/9$. We can see that a carry over is not permitted because the two numbers in the quotient are both less than $10$, and do not have a carry over.\n\nThe second example is more confusing to student without prior knowledge on divison because the student does not understand when a carry over is permitted.\n\n\n### Input B:I can eat 35 chocolates in every minute.

{"text": "-   Explanation: \"Getting lots of attention\" does not specify which type of attention. There are many animals that fit this description. An amphibian needs warm conditions with moisture. So, a ferret is not getting lots of attention in a bathroom or kitchen or trash can. And, ferrets don't like to be patted or held. There are no ferret kennels at schools. There are no ferrets in \"petting zoos,\" which do not pay attention to any specific animal. And, a ferret is most commonly found in its own home. (It is only at \"owners' houses and apartments\" that it might be getting lots of attention. Ferrets are not getting special attention when their owners take them to the vet, where they undergo medical treatments. Finally, the only answer that makes sense is that the ferret is likely to be found in its own home.)\n-   Other possible responses:\n-   \n-\n-   Notes:\n\n-   For more guidance, use the  \"Follow Along\" and \"Solution\" buttons.", "answer": "D: petting zoo"}

{"text": "If you go to a thrift store, they may not have a teddy bear, but you can often find old and worn toys there. An employee would check to make sure the toy is in good condition. You need to bring your own money to buy a teddy, because it would not have an expiration date, as the stores only take their own money and do not charge the customer. If you want to buy a new teddy bear and get someone to help you buy the teddy bear, you should go to a toy store. A toy store would almost always have a teddy bear. The teddy bear in a toy store is also often in its original packaging, which the parent can be sure the child will receive in mint condition. If you want someone to buy the teddy bear for you, you should head to a home store. A home store would likely only sell teddies as a gift and would not likely keep teddies on hand all the time. The employee would be happy to help you buy a new or old teddy bear. However, that employee will only use the store\u2019s cash, so bring your own to help pay for the teddy bear. The money would be inexpensive as it is only used for purchasing new products and is not considered expended. A store that only sells goods in their natural environment is a place in nature. The toy store would likely be this. A doll and dollhouse are in a different shape than a teddy bear and would not be a doll, so they are not sold in the same place. The teddy bear would be inexpensive and likely not sold in a thrift store.

Example 12:13, will give me yes(should be 12pm) because it looks like you have 5 after 12 (for 12pm) and then it has 13 (which is 13pm, so no 12 in the hour.

{"text": "Option B\n[!INCLUDE[crabout](../../shared/includes/crabout-md.md)] A hospital is the most likely place to have a lot of extinguishers. An extinguisher is used for putting out a fire, so the only choice involving fire is \"B\". The exits of a hospital is another reason why a hospital would need more than three extinguishers in order for it to work properly. And also, a hospital is one of the places that have a chance of an electrical fire. And to put out electrical fires, they use extinguishers to put out fires.\n\n### Input:\"Sally is five and a half times as old as her brother, and her brother is one third as old as their dad.\"\n\n### Response\"Sally's father will turn __29__ this year.\"\n\n### Explanation: Sally\u2019s age is five and a half(+1/2) times her brother\u2019s brother\u2019s age. Her brother\u2019s age is three times her brother\u2019s age. Sally\u2019s age and the age of her brother multiplied by three(+3) plus five and a half(5.5) equals six (+16). Six divided by three equals two (2). Sally is five and a halve times her brothers age equals two and a half times her brother\u2019s(2.5) age). Two and a half divided by three equals one and a half (+1.5). 1.5 times a brother\u2019s age equals 1.5(+0.33) times a brother\u2019s(2). 2 divided by three equals 0.66 times a brother. Finally 29 rounded up is equal to 0.66(2) times 43(+43) which rounds to 0.67, which is equal to 29(+29). So, that is why Sally\u2019s dad will turn 29 years old.\n\n### Exercises\n1.\nSara put 24 pennies in a piggy bank. At the end of 4 weeks, she put another $20 worth of coins into the piggy bank.

The two activities are completed by the team and then one person (who is chosen to be an \u201cevaluator\u201d within the team) will submit the Excel spreadsheet.  The team is asked to create the spreadsheet in their team space but the evaluation requires the documentation to be submitted in another location.

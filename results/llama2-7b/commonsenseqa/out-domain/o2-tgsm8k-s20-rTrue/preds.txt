However, this is the most dangerous answer because there are a lot of businesses found in the yellow pages. A better answer is the business hotel since it can be found in both the mall and the yellow pages.<n>#### X<n><n>### Discursive task<n><n>Input:The table below shows the estimated profit of a company (in thousands of dollars) over three months.<n><n><n>|           |     Jan.       |     Feb.       |     Mar.       |<n>| :------- | :-------------: | :------------: | :-------------- |<n>| Apr.     | $250               | $450              |  $500           |<n>| May      | $225               | $350              | 	  $2

However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Rationales: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>#### 29<n>Answer: 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Rationales: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:She loved buying products, she was driven by her what to shop more than any practical needs?

Choices:  A: gas stations B: city C: london D: train station E: airport<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>A gas station<n><n>### Justification:<n><n>**Situation:**<n><n>A gas station is an ideal place for a telephone booth. People travel there, especially if they are filling up their gas tank. People must often travel outside to pay the station attendant, so they may pick up a phone to call family and friends. Therefore, people are more likely to see a telephone booth near a gas station than anywhere else because customers usually go there to purchase or sell gas.<n><n>**Example:**<n><n>Imagine a gas station located at a highway intersection. People often stop at a gas station that is located across the street from the intersection. They then travel to the other side and buy gas. Many people travel and visit gas stations, so there is a higher likelihood for people to see a telephone near a gas station.<n><n>### Input<n><n>How many times has Harry walked around the track?

Harry's favorite way of jogging was running around the track. There were 12 laps on the track, and he went around 12 times each day. Harry would then walk and/or rest for another 2 hours before he rested the rest of the day.<n><n>**Example or Explanation:**<n><n>On Monday, Harry jogged for 3 miles. Then he took a break for 2 hours. Then he jogged 1/12 or 1 lap on the track. Then he walked and/or rested for another 2 hours. Then, he slept the rest of the day, taking 1 1/3 rests. So Harry jogged 3 miles plus rested for 2 hours plus ran 3 laps which equals 33 /

Which way is the most convenient?<n>Rationales<n>We could take the train 52 minutes using a bicycle for a total of ~ <<300>>300 calories burned.<br />We could bike 56 minutes using a train for a total of 900 calories burn.<br />However, the only mode of transportation with a lower burned calories rate is public transportation. Public transportation only takes 5 minutes, but if we look at per mile, the ride back will burn us up the most calories. Since the train and biking are both the same in the first half of the journey, I think that public transport is the best choice for this mode of transportation.<n><n>### Conclusion:<n><n>

Excluding both the spaces and the quotation marks, the code includes 25 letters, 12 numbers, and 1 three-letter word. How many letters are there in the line of code?<n>>Output: <<<S, S, A, I, I, N, G, U, R, E, L, L, E, S, S>>S, S, AI, I, NG, URE, LLE, S, S<n><n>This same problem can be solved using a similar approach.<n><n>A line of code includes 25 characters as stated in the "Exclusive of" part of the problem statement. The code includes 25 different characters. Then the "including" part shows that it consists of 25 different characters and can be reduced to a combination of various characters. It is easy to see that the character is either letters or numbers. From the output code, it is evident that letters and numbers consist of 12 digits and 3 letters respectively. This means that letters count 4 times and numbers count 3 times. Multiplying 4 and 3 gives us 12, which shows that there are 12 letters, and since there are no quotations or spaces, therefore the output can be reduced to <<S, S, A>>S as 3 S will match a part of the code.<n><n><n>## Instructions: Write a response that appropriatcly completes each request.<n><n>## Demonstration: Write a response that accurately completes the request<n><n>## Instruction:  Choose whether each statement is true or false.<n><n>## Instruction 2: Choose whether each statement below is an addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. <n><n>## Instruction3: Choose whether each expression is an even number.<n>## Instruction 3:

Which phonetic sequence do most English-speaking people like better?<n>Rationales:"I love New York!" In this song from the musical, "Fame," there is only one phoneme that is used twice, and that sounds like a separate vowally spelled word in this instance. (When it's spelled EYE-tie, it doesn't sound like two separate vowels.) I have a hunch that most people, or at least people who speak the English language, actually spell the phoneme "it" that way. The letters I and T are silent on their own. When they're combined, they make the sound that sounds like a separate word in this instance. If the phoneme is pronounced EYE-it, then it's not spelled, for example, like the word "bit." However, if we spell the phoneme with an I at the beginning and an E at the end, that's what we'll be looking at in our answer. In this case, more will prefer "et" to "it."<n>#### Answer:  E<n><n>\section{You should have noticed your issues and fixed them}<n><n>### Task:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n><n>##  Input: Which of the following items is most expensive in the United States?

Choices:  A: arena B: building C: dock D: concert hall E: museum<n><n>### Response:		<n>Select Option D. Concert Hall. Concert Hall is a large room or building that is used for holding concerts, as well as other types of performances. A platform within a concert hall refers to the stage area where performers stand or sit to deliver their presentations and performances to an audience. The audience typically sits on wooden or metal benches that surround the area where the stage is located. The location of a platform within a concert hall can be identified based on its position relative to the main entrance or lobby of the building.<n>#### D<n>Answer: D<n><n>### Input<n>A school that does not have specialized courses (meaning it has general courses) is a comprehensive school. Choices: C: comprehensive school B: private school A: select school D: university<n><n>### Response<n>Select Option B. Private school. Private school refers to an independent institution of learning, such as a primary, secondary, or post-secondary school, that operates independently from government control. Private schools offer an alternative to the public education system, usually with smaller class sizes, more individualized instruction, and a more religious-oriented curriculum. Select schools are private religious schools that focus on individual education and the teachings of one particular religion. Comprehensive schools are usually publicly funded, government-operated institutions, and are typically comprised of general courses.<n>#### B<n>Answer: B<n><n>#### 16<n>Score:170<n><n>

How will this affect the equilibrium price of a loaf of bread in your city?<n><n>### I believe at some point in the future the price will change slightly in an upward direction. But this is more likely to happen once the first few people get used to the rate increase. I think that people who were making $10 an hour will most likely find jobs that pay more since a number of people who make \$10 an hour will be out of a job since with the minimum wage raise other companies decide to reduce their labor force or cut their labor force by 1.<n><n>### In other words, companies hire people for $11-12 an hour instead of $10. So if it is not that different of a raise in employers wages, then people will start losing their jobs when they are not required.<n><n>### But the same can be said for the companies that make a smaller profit or are forced to raise their prices if all this leads to a lower volume of buyers when a company cannot make a profit off their services.<n><n>### However, this isn't necessarily wrong. Sometimes more money in your pocket is better, and I would rather have $12.50 per hour versus $10 an hour.

For A and D, you definitely don’t think of them being fruit, so we will exclude them from consideration. For B, you normally wouldn’t think about it being fruit, but because it says engineering school, I find it reasonable to think about it being fruit.  I will exclude it from the options so we can look at C. I always think of a market when I think of fruit, so C would be my choice.

Then the suffix can be identified as 'ness' to state how dancers become more tired as they dance longer.<n><n>#### C<n><n>#### B<n><n>### Input1:The boss says “You’re the only employee in the office who is on time every day.”. Which of the following is the most likely reason the boss is talking to the employee? Choices: Celebration<n><n>#### A<n><n>### Answer:A<n><n>## Explain2:<n>The use of the phrase ‘the only employee who is on time everyday’ is suggestive of the boss' praise (giving a reason for talking to him). We can infer this from the statement saying what is unusual about some other employee as he is the only ‘employee’ on time and this suggests an uncommon situation and thus praise. As the boss praises the employee in such a grand manner, the only expected reaction from the employee is to respond positively to the praise. Hence, the employee is encouraged and motivated to work more and be even more punctual.<n><n>### Efficiency<n><n>### Extent of knowledge<n><n>### Input2:A coworker suggests to a work team that they hire a consultant company to advise them on how to better market their product.

The bedroom might get moist during the shower session and would risk not being able to preserve the pills effectively.<n>2. The kitchen might have many different kinds of food, and many people tend to eat after consuming the pill since they don't know how many to eat, so it would be a waste to keep the pills in the kitchen.<n>3.

Tapanga and Coreo have 66 candes together. however Tapanga has 66 more candy than Coro. Howmanc candy does Coreo have?<n><n>### Response. The answer is 29<n><n>### Rationale:First, Coreano has 0 less candies than Tapanga so we can subtract 0. Then we can subtract the 66 difference. Since this is a 66 candies we can move onto the total. We can rewrite 66 + 66 = <<66+66=132>>132 as 132 = x, we are asked to solve for x. So we multiply 132 by 2 and simplify, 264 = x, now we divide by 2. We solve for x and the answer is 202. We have 202 candes.<n><n>### Reword each sentence. <n><n>Explanation: The first step is to reword what the sentence said. The sentence said "My name is Corey Favis. My favorite subject is Math.".

But, what if other person is not able to speak? That's when sign language can come to the rescue.<n><n>__What__<n>Sign language is used when the speaker and listener share the same knowledge base and vocabulary. Sign languages share many aspects with spoken languages, including syntax and inflexion. However, while signed communication is often more precise than spoken communication, each language is distinct and the gestural lexicons are far from mutually intelligible.<n><n>__How__<n>[Sign language definition](#sign-language-definition)<n><n>#### Sign language definition:<n><n>__Meaning__<n>[sign language definition](#sign-languagedefinition)<n><n>#### sign language definition<n>A sign language (also signed language or simply signing) is a language which, instead of acoustically conveyed sound patterns, use manually visible aspects of language such asshape, placement, and movement of the hands, as well as facial expressions and body posture, to convey a speaker's meaning.[1] Sign languages are expressed through articulations in the hands and their placement relative to the upper body, as well as replacements of audiovisual modes of communicating.<n><n>__Usage__<n>People who communicate by sign language face some of the same obstacles as people who communicate by speech: prejudice, stigma, and inaccessible public information. These problems occur despite laws guaranteeing the communication accessibility of schools and other public accommodations to deaf people.<n><n>### Importance<n>1.

If you add the digits of 17, you get the number 7, which is not 046, and 54 does not fulfill part (b).<n>*Solution:* In a class of 35 girls, each of which may be assigned any of the numbers from 15 to 159, the numbers 94, 107, 112, and 188 may be assigned so that their digits are in the same order as, respectively: 54, 26, 38, and 42.  To determine the total number of 3-digit numbers starting with 3,  the number with the most digits must be used (94).  This number is evenly divisible by 3, and thus the digits of this number are in a three-digit number, and of the second highest possible sum (62).  Since 94 is greater than 53, the number with the most consecutive digits must be used to determine the total number of digits in a given sum of numbers.  The next highest sum (126) has digits in the following combinations

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Rationales: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>#### 29<n>Answer: 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Rationales: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:Sean was lying about the body, but he was very scared.  He constantly worried about what? Choices:  A: the reward money B: hurt feelings C: being found out D: problems E: trouble<n><n>### Response:		The correct response is D. Sean was constantly worried about trouble since he was lying about the body.<n><n>### Input : Sean was lying about the boy.

The installation expert explained it was a near motion sensor and was called a proximity sensor.<n><n>#### A<n>Answer:<n><n>### Input A: What kinds of sensors can be used to detect motion<n><n>### Response A:<n>There are several different types of motion detectors. For example, active infrared sensors use infrared light to detect someone or something moving between one or more infrared beams. Passive infrared sensors also use infrared light, but they use it to detect heat, not motion. Ultrasonic and microwave sensors use sound and light waves to detect motion, respectively. Laser sensors use light to detect motion as well. Magnetic field sensors use a magnetic field to detect something moving past it, and other motion detectors use ultrasonic sound waves or radioactive particles to do the same thing.<n><n>#### A-E: A-D<n>Answer:<n>### Input B: What is the motion sensor<n><n>### Response B:<n>A motion detector is a device that detects the movement of a person or object. It can be wireless, wireless, wired or wireless. Motion detectors can be used in surveillance and security systems for homes or businesses. There are many different types of motion detector security systems, including infrared sensors for motion. These sensors can be used anywhere that you need to detect motion within a certain range or diameter.<n><n>#### A: motion sensor<n>Answer:<n>## Conclusion:<n>Both answers are correct. Response A provides more information about what a motion detector is, while response B contains more information about what a sensor can be used for and how it works.<n><n>There are many different types of sensors, and they all have advantages and disadvantages. If you are looking for a sensor that will be able to detect motion from a long distance, then an infrared sensor is your best choice because they detect movement more accurately than some other types of sensors. If you need to detect motion in a smaller area, then ultrasonic or magnetic field sensors are the way to go because they both detect very small movements easily. If your purpose is only to detect something within a small space, microwave and infrared sensors might do the job just as well as ultrason

Choices:  A: hole B: television C: sporting goods store D: pool table E: sporting event<n><n>### Response:		If you were to play a game of pool, you would likely see people in uniform playing the game on a pool table because the ball would move from billiard to billiard. But, in the context of the question, A is the correct answer because people in uniform would not play with a ball from a hole because they would not be playing from within a hole. If they were playing in television, they would need to actually be playing from a television in order to move the ball around the board from the holes, but that doesn't make much sense. If they were playing from a sporting goods store, again, they would not be playing with a ball from a whole. And while a sporting event with a basketball game would not be playing with balls from a hole, they wouldn't be wearing uniforms either, so that is not what was asked.<n><n>#### 1<n>Answer: B<n>Demonstration:<n>You can see people in uniform who play billiards in A (pool hall), B (pool table), or E (basketball court).<n>However, if you go to the D (sporting goods store) or C (sporting event) choices, you cannot play billiards.<n>Therefore, the correct choices are A and E.<n>#### 2

Choice B is not the answer, because exercise does not only expend energy, it can also condition the heart, laugh, and weigh you but the exercise addict in the story is not trying to accomplish those goals.

She has three choices for her reward. The first choice earns her 40 gumballs, the second choice earns her a book about caterpillars, and the third is to go to the park. She cannot get the second reward. All three reward choices cost the same. Which reward choice should she pick?<n><n>### Instructor's Note: Explain that in order to answer this question we need to look at the possible answers. The only choices Tamika can get are a 1, 2, or 3. If she chooses a 1, she is not going to the park and will be choosing the book about caterpilars. If she chooses 2, she can buy the book, which means that she still would not be able to go to the park, so she would still buy the book and have 40 gum balls. Therefore, the only choice that would allow her to go to the park is a 3.<n><n>### Rationales: She has three choices (the number of choices is 3). A total of 40 Gum balls are earned (the total of the Gum balls earned is 40). Earnings for the book earnings 40 Gum Balls (the amount earned for book is 40).<n><n>### 3, 2, 1 : <<3/2/1=1>><n>### Answer: 1<n><n>### Inputs: Samson earned $10 and 7 more dollars than his brother.

Choices:  A: football stadium B: surface of earth C: car show D: opera E: movie<n><n>### Response:		E : C:movie<n><n>### Rationales:<n>Input:Where would people be watching things which are not moving? Choice(s):  A: football stadiums B: the surface of the earth C: car shows D: operas E: movie theatres.<n><n>Since 'car show' is a phrase that can refer to a place where you see beautiful, fancy cars, the choice 'car show' only deals with things that are not moving. Similarly, opera theatre and movie theatre are also a places where we see beautiful, fancy thing. So the choice 'opera theatre' and'movie theatre' also have a reference to 'things that can move but are not moving.' On the other hand, football stadium, and surface of the earth have a reference to'moving' rather than 'not moving'. So the answer is 'E : C:movie'.<n>

Gaining intelligence relates more to a person's ability to think than being able to learn more knowledge. And finally gaining education is when one learns and gets knowledge in school, though this knowledge could not be used in reality, where gaining knowledge leads to a stronger brain, this would be by the increasing number of memories one acquires. This can be useful in remembering more important information, although not always necessary. It is in my opinion that learning leads to greater intelligence, however this is just my opinion.

It was a good thing they left early, because even though it probably saved their lives, it probably did not save their property.<n><n>### B: No, the property damage was caused by a river that was already at dangerous heights. The hype over the hurricane name probably just delayed the government from making an early evacuation order, and that led to more time for people and the government to spend money and other resources on something they could have avoided.<n><n>### C

However, Tapatanga has twice as many crayons as Lola. How many crayons does Lola have? 🎨Rationales:  Let X represent the number of crayons Lola has and Y represent the number of candy Tapatanga has.   X + Y = the total number of crayons Tapatanga and Lola share. 2X = the number of crayoons Tapatanga has.  Since Y is double of X, X is half the value of Y.  We can rewrite the equation as X + Y = 125 (1) and 2X = Y, so X = (Y / 2). Substituting (Y / 2) back into equation 2, we get Y = (2X) + (1 / 2), so Y = 2X + 5, so Lola has 60 crayons.<n><n>#### 60<n>Answer: 60<n><n><n>### Instuctions: Write an expression (1, X + 3, etc.) that could go in place of X so that the formula is true?<n><n><n>### Rationales: Substitute X=3X=15.<n>#### 15<n>Answer: 3<n><n>### Instutuctions: Explain why the expression you choose works to make the formula true.<n><n><n>#### 15/3<n>Answer:<n><n>### Instutions: Answer the following multiple  choice question.<n><n>#### B<n>Answer:<n>### Instrucions: Answer the following multiple-choice question in whole numbers<n>### Demontration:<n>Let<n>X = the number of candies Tapatanga has.

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Rationales: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>#### 29<n>Answer: 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Rationales: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:What is eating too much dinner likely to result in?

When an elderly lady approaches, you see she is wearing a hat that has "HUGE PINK PANTIES" written on it. You decide to give her $1, because she has to be cold.<n><n>#### Answer<n><n>Rationales: We know the elderly lady's hat costs $1.<n>She got $1, so we can conclude that she sold the hat for $1.<n>The hat's size affects its price.<n><n>Rationales<n>```<n>A larger size equals a higher price <n>A smaller size equals a lower price<n>```<n>The elderly lady's pajama is a different size to her hat, so her hat cost a low price.<n><n>The following formula connects the two variables.<n>```<n>$1 = $$large($x - $x)\cdot medium($x) + small($x)\cdot$large($x - $small($x))$\footnote{small(A) = A$\frac{1}{2}$}\frac{3}{2}$<n>```<n>After substituting the correct variable<n>```<n>$1 - large($small - $small)$ + (large($small - $x))$ $\footnote{large(A) = |A|$}$ $\frac{3}{2}$$ = $$small($x)<n>```<n>Then, since $small(A) = |(A)|$ so, $large($small - $small) = -$small($small - $small)$. Now replacing $large(A)$ and $small(A)$ with $(A)$ and  $\frac{1}{2}A$ respectively.<n>```<n>$5 + (16-0)$ = $\frac{21}{2}$ or $10*\frac{11}{12}$ = $22*\frac{5}{12}$ = $\frac{110}{12}$<n>```<n>To convert the result into the required range, note that both the large and small units in the range are $\frac{1}{12}$, so $\frac{11}{6}$ when multiplied to an integer value should have a remainder of $\frac{5}{10}$. <n>

He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Rationales: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:Where would a person keep a book while it's being read? Choices:  A: closet B: library of congress C: classroom D: in bed E: desk<n><n>### Response:		A is the most appropriate answer to this question because a closet would not be a place where someone would be reading a book. A person would not be reading a book in their bed because that person would be sleeping so it would not make sense to keep book on the bed. It would be logical not to keep the book in the library of congress or in the classroom because the person reading the book is probably at home or at school.<n>

There are two choices where both "you" and "people" are used. So let us begin by eliminating the ones where both are used. Options C, D, and E all include the word "you" and "listening" "speech" is found in B and C. Therefore, we only have 4 options left to chose from. In each of them is "people" and "to religious". So there are no more words in A and B that match with the words in the question. Looking at the final 4, C has "sit down" instead of "sitting" but we could simply change that to sit for each. In Choices C, E, and A all options in common "listening" "people" "listening. So we know only one letter is used.

So 1000 mod 32 = << 968=20>>20. Now we have to divide 20 by our group numbers. Since each group is one digit larger then in each group we need to reduce the divisor by 1. So we get: 20 / 1 = << 20/1=20>>2<n>20 / 2 = <<20/2=10>>1<n>These are the only choices we have for how many will be greater than twice.<n><n>###### 0<n>Answer: 0<n><n>### Instructions:A math competition is divided into 5 quizzes, each of which has 10 questions.

It may be true that they do both of those things, but the comparison is not one of complimentary vs. dull.<n>Answer Choice B: The idea of being inelegant suggests something that is not quite the right shape, or perhaps is incompatible. These are not attributes related to calculations.<n>Answer Choice C: The suggestion of being oceanic suggests something vast, but engineers are often detailed about their calculations. The calculations themselves may be grandiose, but not the engineer who creates them.<n>Answer Choice D: The idea of being bland suggest something unremarkable, perhaps of low quality. When a calculation is dull, it is unremarkable, not unlike anything else ever calculated.<n>Answer Choice E: The idea of a calculation being inaccurate suggests something that, although true, is not entirely true. An inaccurate calculation can be useful, although may be slightly incorrect. When it comes to an engineer's calculations, it is the opposite.

Attics of older homes are much more likely to be filled with historical and personal items than attics of newer homes.<n>Rationales: Attics are often used for storage, and since older homes are older, they are likely to have an attics as well. Attics aren't typically found in newer types of homes, which makes answers (C) and (D) incorrect. Additionally, only (C) and (E) describe materials, which is an incorrect answer to this question.<n>#### Answer:Older homes<n><n>### Input<n>Sir Riley is thinking of a number.

Each task is graded individually, however, the total of your score is not determined solely by the score of each individual task, but also by your response to tasks that weren't graded specifically. The point of the tasks is to assess your competency in understanding, applying and analyzing basic math principles. Your scores for any task should reflect the effort you put into the problem and the thought you put into your response. This means that you shouldn't just take the first or the last answer that comes to your mind. Each task was specifically written for you as to demonstrate that you understand the principles and skills you learned in class.<n><n>You will have to choose whether you will answer the question by using a numerical response or a written response. It may take a couple of minutes (at most) to respond. No other communication in class is permitted during class. You should try your best to complete each task within about 5-10 minutes. After this class, you still should be able to answer the questions and defend it. If it is unclear to you why certain choice was chosen, feel free to ask. Also, if you just aren't sure that you know the answer, feel free to ask and try and defend it.<n>

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Rationales: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>#### 29<n>Answer: 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Rationales: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:What do humans do when in a race? Choices:  A: lay eggs B: eat fruit C: wrestle D: compete with each other E: draw pictures<n><n>### Response:		<n>The correct answer is D.) Compete with each other<n><n>The input states clearly that this activity that humans do is a race, but we are given no information of what is happening<n><n>Since there are 5 choices, we will use the method of elimination.<n><n>If we were to eliminate choice A, we could do this by looking if the sentence states if there are humans doing the activity. For if it does not state if humans are doing the activity we can eliminate choice A. We also can eliminate C, since this would cause a sentence contradiction. Humans have 2 arms, while an arm is 1. So we can eliminate choice C because it would cause a contradiction with the statement<n><n>Another way we can eliminate choice E would be if we know that there is no egg in the sentence. If there were an egg in the sentence then we would know that there would be eggs in the sentence. This would eliminate choice E, since choice E states that humans lay eggs. We would be able to eliminate choice C, since choice C states that humans lay fruit. So this would be redundant if there were eggs in the sentence. There are no eggs in the sentence. With these facts, we realize that the correct answer is choice D<n><n>If we were using the method of elimination, we would eliminate choices E, D, B, and C. The correct answer would be choice D<n><n>Answer: The correct answer is D. Human compete with each other<n>

So he opened his laboratory <n>to visitors but no one was interested. They had no money. They did not want<n><n>#### to pay.

He was a very stubborn man.<n><n>He began to look for a very large hall but he had no audience. In order to<n>attract the public to the hall he took in a few days only 2,000 tickets and <n>sold all. He did not make any money and not only that, but he made a loss, a<n><n>big loss. Nevertheless, he did not give up. He had the idea of constructing <n>another machine and making it larger and better.

This math problem was presented to students and is meant to teach them to count more than 20 objects. Students should be able to answer the question using math terms such as "more," "less," "equal to," "how many," and "same as" in their answer.  The teacher is planning to divide students into three groups. Each group is going to have a different answer to the question. She wants students to explain their reasoning. The answer will be "more" because the basket has 25 apples.<n><n>The first answer to the question is 22. There are 12 apples and 10 apples in two different plates. The teacher asks for more, and so now the answer is 25. She was given a basket of apples. However, she is missing two apples at an unknown location. She has 23. The teacher doesn't care that there are two fewer apples in the basket than in the basket. The apples were counted, and the correct answer is 25 apples in a basket, and "more" is the answer. 10 apples are in the basket, and the teacher was told that there were 25 apples, and more apples were added to the basket.<n><n>Students will not use division to count apples. They will be told to count the apples. <n><n>####<n>Answer:  The answer, with justification, is "more." The reason is that the teacher saw 23 apples in the basket and was told that there were more.<n><n>####<n>Answer 2:<n><n>####<n>Answer3<n><n>####<n>Answer4:<n><n>####<n><n>####<n><n>### Instructions:<n>A school principal must decide what should replace the carpet in three rooms.

Both can be demolished for new buildings (and possibly resurrected later), and the city is not really a single place.

Monday starts the week at 12:00 AM and ends at 11:59 PM. Since it takes 24 hours to get to the next Friday, there are less than 24 pieces of time because not all of the pieces of time from Monday are used up to Friday.<n>We can then subtract 56 from 168 to find that there are 12 pieces of time we did not use.<n>If we divide the pieces of time by what we subtract, <<56 / 12 = 4>>4 will be the number of days.<n>If we divide 12 by 4, the result is 3.

Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Rationales: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:The man tried to run, but he could not.

The only ways to move are by standing still, standing, walking, or walking slowly.<n><n>### Input1:The number of people who watched the match were 26.7 less than a total of 150. How many people did not watch?<n><n>### Response1:The total of 155 people - 26.7 = <<155-26.7=128.3>>128.3, so 128.3 people did not watch the match. In addition, the total number of people who watched was not 26.7. We cannot subtract a negative number, so we know that 26.7 is not a number of people.<n><n>### Other Solution:<n>The total of 100 of the people is less than 150 - 26.3 = <<100- 150-26.3=113.7>>113.7. <n>So, 113.7 people did not watch the game.<n><n>### Answer: 113.8<n>### Input:What number do you add to 8 to get 13?<n><n>### Answer.<n>What we know is that there is a number that when we add it to 8, we get 13. Let's start by finding the answer, and plugging the numbers 2 and 3 into the equation. We get 13+2 = 13+3+3 = 13 + 6 = 19, so 2 and 3 is not the answer. We then plug in 9 and 11 into the equation. We find 13+9 = 13+19= 32. Plugging 4 and 7 into the equation, we find 32+4 = 32+7= 39.<n>When we plug in a new number, such as 17, we find 39 + 17=56, so 39 is not the answer. However, we have found that when we add 4 to any even number, we get an odd number. By solving even numbers, we can find an answer because we don't need to solve the negative numbers. So, by combining any even number with

What is true here with the task is that we know they ask us questions about information about things we need to know about something so we have to think about this situation. <n><n>### Input<n>Which number of this series is missing? _______ + _______ = 64<n><n>### Response<n>I know the answer is 52 because you use 1 more than the previous one and then the sum comes out to the missing number 7. The pattern we see is 1 + 2, 2 + 4, 4 + 8, 8 + 16. I notice that we have to have the number that the addition would leave with to get the missing number. In real life, I would have my guess set in motion by adding the numbers before it and seeing if I come up with a set of numbers where each number is 8 or 9 larger because that could be the two sides that add up to 7.

And 30 percent report sleep deprivation because of time constraints. Of those killed in crashes in which drug use was reported, 41 percent of drivers were under the influence of illegal drugs. Of those killed in crash involving alcohol, roughly half, or 46 percent, had blood alcohol levels of 0.08 g/dL or higher.<n><n>#### A) Stressful<n><n>### Input 1:<n>How many times did Corey jump rope during the summer?<n><n>#### A) More than 10,000<n><n>### B) 1000<n><n>#### C) 20<n><n>### D) 10,035<n><n>#### E) Anything More<n><n>### Rationales:<n>Answer 1: Since it is more than 10, he must have jump rope more than 10. Therefore, He must have jump rope above 10 thousand. This is the only choice that satisfies this.<n>Answer 2: Since he does not have more than 10 thousand times. We divide 10 thousand by 2, 500 times. Which is equal to 20.<n><n>### Note:<n>

Choices:  A: mountains countryside B: ground C: bridge D: mountain range E: surface of earth<n><n>### Response:		C.If you think of it, throwing the rock near where you think the water level is will throw the rock deeper into the river. If you throw it up where it lands in the air, it doesn't go deeper into the river, it just keeps coming back down on top of the water. Thus, B does not work. In E, the river isn't that big, so it takes a long time to throw over that distance. In C, just remember that the closer you are to the surface of the water, the farther the rock will go deeper. Also, remember that the deeper you throw, the higher in altitude you have to throw. There are two options: One, throw it high up and throw it further inland so it has more of a horizontal distance to go, which will result in it going deeper into the water. Two, throw it not too high, but not too low, just right, so that it dives into the water.<n>#### C<n>Answer:C<n><n>### Input:"There're ten birds perched on top of this telephone pole. One flies up, and one flies down. The number of remaining birds on the pole is the same as the number on the side missing. What's the total number of birds on the telephone pole?"<n>Rationales: We can write a subtraction equation for solving this problem. We could write -x + x = 10 for x equals the number of remaining birds and -x could be the number of birds flying up and x could be the number of the birds flying down. Then we subtract one from both sides, but we have to flip it around if it's positive since it is supposed to be negative, so we would have x-x = -10, so the answer is -10. I could probably simplify this and make it more simple, but I'm not sure how. Also, don't forget to flip the negative sign.<n>#### -10<n>Answer:-10<n>1.5 + 3 =<n>3 + 0.5 = 3.5<n>3.5.5 =<n>1.75<n>1.75 + 3.5 =<n>5.25<n>5.25.5 =<n>2.625<n>2.62.5 =<n>13.15<n>13.1 + 2.625 =

Below are excerpts (identified by letter) from five of the responses.  1. I'd like to see a new city park built on the east side. 2. There are too many potholes in the streets. The city needs to do something about that. 3. There should be a better library. Too many people don't have any access to books. 4. Our sewers are overcrowded. The infrastructure needs a major overhaul. 5. We need more nightclubs downtown. We can attract more people to the area with those. If there are problems with the town's infrastructure, there would be many people who want to see improvements to the streets, library, or sewers. On the other hand, if there are no problems at all, then those suggestions have less value.

To make the sentence clearer, we can use synonyms more appropriate to the given situation.<n>For example, instead of saying "riding bike through rough terrain", we might say "using a bicycle on bumpy roads".<n><n>The reason that riding a bicycle can be dangerous is because one might get hurt, or even more seriously, be involved in an accident or even crash. The correct response is C; however, we can also say C1 (B), since bumps on the road are the source of bicycle accidents and injuries. The difference between choices A (Pleasure) and B (Accident) is ambiguous. According to Dictionary.com, pleasure is a noun that refers to a source of enjoyment or happiness, or the feeling aroused by such thoughts or objects. An accident is an undesirable occurrence unintended and unexpected happenstance; a misfortune.

The store in the small suburb, however, is out of cactus juices as well. The man realizes that he will have to travel farther to buy some cactus juice, so he heads to the airport to visit an international duty free store, where he finally purchases a bottle of the cactus juices. The man is glad that the last convenience store had the cactus juichees.<n><n>### Question: How far is the convenience store at the airport from the house?<n><n>### Instructions::Use numbers and digits correctly.<n><n>### Rationales::<n>The man starts driving at 6:30, and his round trip drive lasts exactly 45 minutes, as indicated by the times on his dashboard.

But there are two things that don’t make sense to me:<n>Corn was used as feed for the birds, so we will need it again the next year.<n>We have to use the rest of the corn we used from last year. This means the rest can’t be new, so it’s not an option.<n><n>As for option D, it can be anything that grows, but the word is grow, so it would grow new seeds this year if it was a plant that’s why is option E is incorrect.

Choices:  A: hardware store B: basement C: garage D: repair shop E: the library.<n><n>### Response:		I'm a bot, so I don't write answers, but the author wrote that the person had to walk to the garage to get the tool. The question asks where to walk to get the tool (hence, the choice for the garage rather than the basement). So that's my suggestion for the answer.<n><n>### Input Where did the person put the tool? Choices A: under the sink B: in the shed C: on the roof D: downstairs<n>Response: I'm a human writing that answer. The person put the tool in the yard, as there's no roof to put it on or basement to put it in, and the garage is outside so it's not under the sink. I would also mention that there is no mention that there is a shed or anything in the yard, so the person doesn't put the tool there. Since he doesn't put it downstairs, I'm also noting that he doesn't put that tool downstairs. So it's C.<n><n>Rationales: Choice A is under the sink, which is incorrect since sinks are indoors and not outdoors. Choice B is in the shed, which is incorrect since there is no shed at all noted in the passage. Choice C is downstairs, which doesn't make sense since he just bought the tool. Choice D is in the yard, which is the right place to put the tool, as I noted earlier.<n><n>#### Answer:<n>The person put the tool in his yard.

So it looks like you are going to have 20 of the pieces, and you are going to have twenty 25 cent pieces, 15 of those, and then you are going to have fifty cents here, that is going to be five dimes. That is going to be 20 dollars. I should double check it. It costs 60 cents and 65 cents altogether.

Let z represent drawers.<n>4. Let w represent suitcases.<n>5. Let r represent bookshelves.<n>6. Let s represent washing machines.<n>7.  Let b represent beds.<n>8.  Let f represent sofas.<n>9. So, you could find old clothing in x + y + z + w + r + s + b + f.<n>10. The sum of trunk, drawers, suitcase, bookshelves, washing machine, beds and sofas is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 24.<n>11. A clothes trunk is not equal to a drawer therefore you cannot find clothing in the trunk.<n>12. Therefore, you can not find clothes in a closet.<n>13.  The sum of bed and sofa is 30 therefore; the sum of beds and sofas could contain old clothing.<n>14.  Beds and sofas are not found in the same room therefore beds and sofas are irrelevant to the question.<n>15.

However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Rationales: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>#### 29<n>Answer: 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes.

As a reminder, mountains that are in the continental U.S. are often in the eastern part of the country.<n>Therefore, "a mountain is home to a eastern state" is true in the eastern United States because the eastern part of the United States is home to many mountains in it because of its geography.

Two hours later, the sale is over and the normal item pricing returns. There are 100 items. What is the max profit of retailers if they take advantage of the sale?<n><n>### Demostration:<n>Rationales: Total number of items available for the sale = 100<n>Duration of the sale = 60 minutes<n>To solve this question, we need to find the formula for the profit of retailers. We can use the formulas for a) a 50% discount and b) the cost of goods. Let 'x' be the quantity of items sold at 50% off, and 'y' be the quantity of normal cost items.<n>The formula for an 'x' discount is P(x) = (x/2) * cost of good; we can simplify (x/2) to '1/2x'.<n>Similarly, the formula for the 'y' discount is P(:y) = (1- y/2) * cost good; we can simplify that last fraction to '(1/2-y), and combine like terms.<n>x/2 - (1/2-y) = 1/2x- (1/2- y)<n>To find the profit of retailer, we subtract the cost of goods from 1/2x.<n>Profit = 1/2 * x- (1/2*y)<n>By putting these values into the previous equation 1) x = the quantity of items sold<n>2) y = the quantity of normal good sold. <n><n>By substituting the values for x and y into the equation for profit, we get<n>((x / 2)- (1 / 2-y)) = 1/2 x - (1 / 2 - y)<n>In other words, the profit will equal 1/2x-(1 / 2- y) when x is doubled.<n>The expression for profit that the retailer gets at the beginning of the sale is 1/2x - (1 / 60) + (1 / 2y -

However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Rationales: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>#### 29<n>Answer: 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Rationales: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:Wanting to avoid the cabbage spoiling, where did he put it? Choices:  A: grocery store B: refrigerator C: freezer D: plate E: supermarket<n><n>### Response:		Answer the following multiple choice question with a number, a mathematical symbol, or a phrase (i.e. 8 / 2, 3 x 4, 2x2), but no roman numerals.<n><n>### Rationale: To get all the numbers even in order, we would get the prime numbers first. We would start with prime numbers 2 and 3. 2x3 is 6. 5 is divided by 3. We get 5 / 3 which is not even so we get the next prime number 5.<n>5x5 is 25. We go to 7 which is divided by 3 and then 7x7 is 49. We get to 11 which is not divided by 3 so that is not even and we go to 11x11 or 121. We go for 13 and it is divided by 3 so 13x13 is 169.<n>Now for 19 is not even so we go to 19x19 which is 371. Next for 23 is divided by 3 = 72. Then for 29 which is not divided by three it goes to 29x29 or 859. Now we go to 31 is not divided by 4 and the last option to choose is 31x31 or 971.<n>We get 572 which is an even number. Since 572 is the last option that we have we have to choose that option. It is not 4 that is even but 5. We have chosen option D.

He calls his father, who lives in the city right down the road from him, and they talk in person for 58 minutes. Then he calls is brother, who lives in a separate town from him, and they call each other from cell phones to talk for 91 minutes. Since Freddy cares about his family, he wants to use a cheaper way to call his brother. Instead of charging 5 dollars for each 0.7 miles for long distance, Freddy will call his brother from the city and tell him to come pick him up at the airport. Since the city is only 38.6 miles away from the airport, Freddy figures the city would cost less than the town by 18.8 miles, which equals 18.8 x 0.7 = <<18.8 x.7=13>>13 cents. Freddy knows that airport tolls cost 5 cents per mile, so he will save 18.8 cents by calling his brother while in the city. Should Freddy save this money? He is still poor, but he likes to save money any chance he can.<n><n>### Input answer: The answer to the above problem is yes, Freddy should save the 18.8 cent amount to pay for the airport toll.

Choices:  A: symphony B: band C: create music D: orchestra E: string quartet<n><n>### Response:		The answer is D: orchestra. According to my research, A, B, D, E are valid options. The viola can be grouped into different types of orchestras, namely symphony orchestras, brass and string orchestras. Brass and string orchestrs (B, D) have other brass instruments such as trumpets and trombones instead of string instruments(violas). String quartets are made up of two violins, viola, and cello.<n>The viola can only be part of orchestras which makes (C) not be a viable choice. My opinion, the answer is (D).<n><n>### Answer: The viola is a stringed instrument that can be played in any orchestra. It is the middle-sized between the mandolin and the cello. It is made from maple and rosewood. It is played in an orchestra where it is referred to as the alto viola. The violin was created in the Byzantine Empire in around 500 C.E. while the viola was created later in 1550 in Italy.<n>#### 5030<n>Answer: The viola is one of the four major string musical instruments, and it is a bowed and string instrument. In classical music, the name viola is often used to refer to the violin. But, it also appears in small orchestras where it is referred to one of two varieties: (1) alto viola- it is a smaller cousin of the violin, (2) and is often a second-best instrument. The viola is between the cello and the violin in size and tone. The viola is part of the double bass family of string instruments. The instruments are usually made out of the wood that is made of maple and rosewood and are painted a dark brown with black fittings. <n><n>The viola is believed to have been created in Italy in the 1550s. The viola is made up of a big, round back made of maple and the back is hollow on one side. The viola player then fits a piece of bone or ivory on the inside of the back, to give the back shape. The bow is made of horsehair and it fits the instrument perfectly. This instrument is made to play melodies alone or in harmony with other instruments

Choices:  A: eyes B: biology laboratory C: shower stall D: old cheese E: decaying matter<n><n>### Response:		D<n><n>Demonstration:Milk is a nutritious liquid produced by mammals like cows, goats, and humans (and used by them to nourish their young.) For humans, milk is an important source of carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, and minerals.<n>Cows, goats and sheep are ruminants (mammals that digest food by fermenting plant matter in two or four stomachs), so ruminants produce milk. It is true that there is a biological difference that has been exploited in biological science for centuries, making it relatively easy to obtain milk. In general, humans have only two milk ducts that run from the nipple into the breast. Ruminants have much more milk ducts running into the different stomachs that can store milk. But in order to have more milk ducts you need some extra parts on the body, specifically bones, muscles and blood vessels.<n><n>But the reason why fungus would grow on something made from milk is because milk has a large number of complex sugars that are easily used by fungi. So yes there will be fungus growing on cheese especially which is made from milk or things that look like it.<n><n>####  D<n>Answer: D<n><n>### Input:: There are two different classes of fungi. These classes are called Basidiomycota and Ascomycota. They can be distinguished by the different modes of spore release. Basesiomycota produces basidiums that are club-shaped fungus pieces with fuzzy ends. Ascomycota produces ascus that are cigar-shaped fungus pices with a hole in the end.<n><n>### Response:--<n><n>    ## Question: Where would you find fungus?<n><n>    ## Demonstration: <n><n>    ## If fungi can be distinguished by the shape of their spores, <n><n>    ## then they could be found in places that have shapes that resemble their spores.<n><n>    ## For Ascomycota, fungi are cigar shaped and have a single hole in that shape.<n><n>    ## These are called ___________________<n><n>    ## In the class __________________ the spores are shaped as _____________.

Choices:  A: carpet B: refrigerator C: breadbox D: fridge E: coach<n>Output:		At the beginning of the problem, the leftovers were in the forgotten leftovers drawer in Fred's fridge. Fred's fridge and the forgotten leftover drawer are two things in a set of items. The fact that the forgotten leftoversary was in the fridge means that it is a member of the set of items. The forgotten leftovers is a member of at least one set, so Fred describes at least set as set with one member.<n>If Fred had just found the forgotten leftoveters, it would take up some space in his car, but it is unlikely that the space in his car is large enough to require putting "set with one member" as a label in Fred's car. The space in Fred's frigde, however, is indeed large enough, so Fred could describe the item as "set with one member.<n>Since Fred put the forgotten leftovertes in the fridge instead the what would he call it?<n>

This problem requires you to compute with the order of operations first. Before you do multiplication, do the addition, subtraction, and division operations first. 110 + 90 + 110 - 90 = 100, which gives you 0 remainder 0. Since the remainder is the same as 0, this means there is one digit left in the second place. There is no 0 in the second place, so it stays as the 1 in the second. There is a 0 in the first place, so that leaves the place after the decimal point remaining for the 0. Because the problem does not say to recalculate the decimal points, we are safe to assume that the value of the first place is already 1.<n>The final answer is  -> 9690<n>        <n>Input:How many hours are there in three weeks?<n>Output: There are <<3*7=21>>21 hours in three weeks.<n>>>1728=1728>> hours in a year<n>>>3*7=2/3=864/3=920>>920 hours in three weeks is equal to <<1728-920=92>>92 hours and < 100<n>So the final answer the 92.<n><n>### Submission:<n>

Choices: A) true B) false<n>Output: Los Angeles is home to around 3, 000, 000 / 4, 000 =<< 3,000,000/4,000=750>>750 people. Since 3, 041, 226 San Diegans total, San Diego County has a population of 2/4 =<<2/4=1/2>>1/2 of LA County's population. Therefore, the statement is false. "The population of Los Angeles at that time in the 2011 census (3, 040, 226) is 2 times as large as the population of San Diego." The population of LA County was indeed 3, 025, 111, slightly larger than San Diego County's population of 3, 055, 349. Therefore the statement is false -- San Diego County is not 2 times smaller than Los Angeles County, and so its population is not half that of Los Angeles County. However, since the statement is false, San Diego County is not smaller than Los Angeles County in such a strong sense that it is a "half" of Los Angeles County's population.<n><n>Input: A new app was created and it's been downloaded over 1,000, 649 times on ios and Android (apple and Google's cell phone operating system).

How many chickens will hatch in a year from that one chicken?<n>Output: 24 X 365 = (24*365) = 8640 days for 1 year.  (24 X-18) = (24*-18) = -12 chickens hatched in a day (negative because there was a negative number before the 18). But the number should always be positive. -18/24 =.75=3/4 so the first answer in the right answer.<n><n>Input: What is 23% of 279?<n>Output: First let's set the equation as 279% of 23. 279 is going to start with a 3 because 3 is a prime number. 3 and 23 cannot be added together. So the equation is still going to start with a three.  The 3 in the second equation = 24%. So we get: 3*24 + 6 = 19% (because 279 is more

How many square feet of corn do you need to give Farmer John to help him plant the field?<n>Output: We know that 12 times more corn is needed when you are using square feet.<n>So, if you already have a field that is 800 square,feet times 12 is equivalent to 9600 square feet. If you are only planting 320, it means that 640 square feet of corn would be needed. So to get 640 square, feet, you just turn that from 640 square foot into 320 square foot.<n>That means that to get your corn for the field, you need to give him 320 square, feet.<n>So the final answers is 320.<n>Input:There are 70% more apples in Aiden's basket than his sister's.

Choices:  A: drinking B: intimacy C: dancing D: happiness E: enjoyment<n>Output:		Let's consider each of the choices individually, and then see what remains if we exclude a possible answer.<n>A: drinking<n>If the word "drinking" appears in your sentence, there is no way it could be "happiness". "Drinking" is an action--something we do. You don't "drink" happiness.<n>B: intimacy<n>If the word "intimacy" appears in your sentence (or if the word "intimates" appears in your sentence), "happiness" can't be an answer. For two reasons:<n>First, "intimacy" is synonomous with "sex"; to use one word (intimate) to cover more than one term (e.g., sex, friendship, emotional) would be odd.<n>Second, why would you wish someone "happiness" if they are being intimate? If they are being intimate, you wish them happiness, but not "happiness". It doesn't make sense. "happiness" is too abstract.<n>C: dancing<n>If the word "dancing" appears in your sentence and there's no mention of a "New Year's" then "C: dancing" is a plausible answer. It is the only plausible answer if New Year's isn't mentioned. However, if New Year's is mentioned in your sentence, there's another possibility:<n>D: happiness<n>If celebrating the occasion means dancing, then "happiness" could be an option.<n>E: enjoyment<n>If enjoyment is what you're celebrating, "enjoyment" could be the answer. But then it's not a good choice.<n>It's easy to come up with the wrong choices because of the lack of context (what is the occasion?). However, it is also easy to pick the right choice that you had listed as a wrong choice. This is a common logical fallacy.<n>The right choice, then, is "B: intimacy."<n><n><n><n><n><n>

Choices: < 2><n>Output: 2^4 = 16<n>Since 16 is an even number, we can divide it by 2 to get 8.<n>And since we're looking for the minimum number, let's turn that into the maximum number. Therefore, 16*2 = 32<n><n>Since 1*2 = 2, 2*2 = 4, and so on, we would multiply 32 by 4 to double it every four minutes.<n>32*4 = 128<n><n>If we use the 2 3 Pigeonhole Principals to prove that we could find more than 1 different number that solves both 2^n = 16  and 2^(n+4) = 128, we can conclude that the final answer has to equal 128 or more<n><n>So the final output is that the minimum number of units would be 128

Since lion = x, the man is represented by the letter x.<n>In the same sentence, the woman's favorite animal is a cat. Since cat = y, the woman is represented by the letter y<n>Next the second sentence continues with, the man replies, you're too loud. This means x = <man (lion)> & x = <<man (lion)> = <lion man> = x.<n>In the third sentence, since x = woman & y = man, we get woman = y (since woman = man's favorite animal)<n>Next the three sentence continues with, when the woman replies, youre so small, she is actually referring to man's favorite animal, which is the lion. So, the woman is actually referring to the lion when she replies; youre so small!

Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input:What could someone be doing while performing that cannot be enjoyed by deaf people? Choices:  A: smile B: singing C: sweat D: act E: dance<n>Output:		The phrase that most deaf people cannot do are enjoyable to someone who is a person does not make sense.<n>Because the only thing we can enjoy while singing are people whose hearing is fine.<n>C and D are also out because those things are only enjoyable to people who can see (we will go with that assumption for now).<n>So we are left with smile and dance.<n>That leaves smile and dance. However, while we can't enjoy someone performing a smile (what does that mean, we don't know and nobody seems to be able to explain it to us either...), smile is definitely an enjoyable thing (especially when you're talking to friends, not in front of people). Dance on the other hand, also can't be enjoyed by someone who isn't able to see, but A: smile is actually a form of dance.<n>So our final answer is E: dance<n><n>Input:There are 2 girls that were born on the same day.

Note: Each row of the chart represents a single person.<n><n>Output: I chose to write this question in python. There are a couple of different ways of doing this in python. Using a for loop, we can go through the first array, and then use one of the arrays as a counter, where for each item in the first array, we increment the value in the counter by 1 (like the next in the matrix), if it's different than the one next to it. Then using zip, we can compare these two lists to see if they are equal. We use a "and" instead of "==", because the "==" would check if it's equal to a certain value (0 in this case), which it would not be. Here's the code:<n><n>a = [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11],[1, 2, '3', 4, 5,'6', '7', '8', 9, 11, 12]]<n>n = a[0]<n>i = 1 # the counter<n>for j in range(len(n)):<n>    if n[j]!= n[j+

She used 3 sandpaper rolls, 2 saw blades, and 6 screws. How much did the carpenter spend on supplies to build the table?<n>Output: All costs can be found by working backward through the table.  The sandpaper cost $25 / 3 = <<25/3=8>>8cents, the saw blade cost $85 / 2 = <<85/2=42.5>>42.5cents, the screws cost $11 / 6 = <<11/6=1.83>>1.83cents/screw, and the hammer cost $111 / 1 = <<111/1=111>>111 cents.  So she spent 8 + 42.5 + 6 * 1.83 +111 = <<8+42.5+6*1.83+111=174>>174 cents on supplies.  Since each dollar has 94 cents, the carpenter spent $1.807 / 94 = <<1.807/94=1.93>>19.3cents on supplies to build the Table.<n>So the final Answer is 19.3<n><n>

Income tax revenue is expected to increase by 0.06% (that is, 0.06 *100000 = <<0.06*10000=60000>>60000). What % increase in total spending does the government expect?<n>Output: Assuming total spending to be = <<260=260>>260<n>For a 4% increase, total spending = (106-100)/100 = <<0<1-100=>1>>14%<n>Now taking the 0.60% increase, we would end up with<n>26/25 = <<26/25=16>>16%<n>Since 60000/25 = <<60000>25=24000>>24000<n>We would have that 6000/24 = <<600/24=250>>250%<n>So the final answer would be 250<n><n>Input: I have 12 oranges.

You decide to use a random generator to randomly select the monsters and the rooms. When you make the monster choice, the random generator randomly selects a number between 0 and 49, and the monster with that number is chosen. For example, if the number returned is 28, you would pick the 28th monster on the list of monsters, and repeat this step for 27 monsters.<n>Each monster must only appear in one room. The first room is the starting room, which means that it is the room that the player sees first. When the player exits this first room, he then enters the second room, and so on. So once a player visits a certain room, he must never again visit it.<n>You must print out your entire video game.<n>Output:When you make the monster selection, randomly generate a number between 0, which represents the first room, and 29, which represents the 50th room at that moment. Then create the list of monsters in random order, with one monster per index. Print out the first room, the starting room, with monster 0 next to it. Then, print out monster 1 in the first random room not used by monster 0. Then, print out the starting room with monster 1, then print out the first randomly chosen room. Then, print out each monster in order until you have hit room 29, and then return to room 0 until all rooms are used. You will cycle around all 50 rooms.<n><n>Input: Which two of the following 5 people would be most likely to share clothes?  1. Chau, 27, female, born in Australia, has lived in the USA for 7 years 2.

Choices:  A: make noise B: band C: museum D: concert hall E: rubber band<n>Output:		"Harpsichord" is a noun, so this sentence has a singular verb. To be more specific, we are listening for what the word "harpsichord" could be modified to be doing. The verb "make noise" looks like it might fit. If we were to play the harpsichord (a kind of organ), we could (using the verb "cause") "make noise". But to modify "harpsichord", we need to put a -ing ending on it so we get "harpsichording". This is not a word. It would sound something like a robot trying to communicate with us. We would probably want to take out all the "-ing"s like we did with our gerunds. So we get "harpsicator", and this seems like something we can hear at a band. So the final answer is A,  B, or  C<n><n>

Comparing these formulas shows that the formula for the smaller cylinder is V'<V, so the one with radius r has the larger volume.<n>So the final answers are 4<n><n>Input: The volume V is 3 times as great as that of the cylinder with a radius of 3/5 the radius of the original cylinder. The radius of the original cylinders is r₁≈550 and the radius of the smaller cylinder is r₂≈745. If V is 84, how many liters is the original cylinder?<n>Output: The formula for the volume of the cylinders is V=pi·(r1)³-V'=pi·r2³ where V'=pi·(r2)³/3<n>Comparing these equations shows that the original cylinder has a volume of 84 3/5 times the volume of the small cylinder. Since volume is also equivalent to the number of liters, the original cylinder contains 84 3.639 liters, or about 84.12 liters.

The time required to communicate slowed their what? Choices:  A: static B: train of thought. C: progress D: transfer of information E: collaboration<n>Output:		To send letters through the mail, you must pay postage.  You can buy stamps that let you send letters at varying costs.  If the stamp costs $1, then every letter costs $1 in total.  Your cost function is the total number of letters you send.  Since the cost depends on how much you send, your function must be a sum. To calculate the total cost, we need one more piece of information, called the variable you are changing.  The variable in this problem is how much you send, because you must choose how much to send.  In other words, the variable is the total cost you pay.  Your cost function has two pieces of information:  The total amount you send and the cost of each letter.  Therefore, you can set up an inverse function for the total cost.  This new function is similar to the original one except that it works in the other direction.  When you input how much you're sending, it tells you how much that will cost.  You can use the new function to find the cost of a letter.  Since you know the cost of every letter, you can calculate the cost of sending one: total cost total cost_minus_1  letters_sent Let's use this to find how much you spent by sending letters for a total cost of 50 cents.<n>How many letters did you send?<n>To figure this out, we can use the new fucntion above.  We know the total cost was 50 cents, so we can use that to plug in values. We know 1 letter costs 1 cent, so we can plug the total cost into the formula above: 0.5*(total_cost_minus_1)total_cost_minus total_cost_minus_letters 0.5*(0.5-(0))0.5-0 0.25-0 0<n>So John spent 0.25 in total to send his letter.<n>Since the variable is still the amount sent, we can multiply the answer by the amount you sent.  In this problem John sent 28 letters; to find the total cost we plug this into the function we calculated above:<n>0.25*28 7.5 cents total<n>So the final answer has to be 7.5

How many faucets can they manufacture?<n>Output: When manufacturing faucets and dealing with different types, only types whose number of faucets aren't divisible by three can remain.<n>With this in mind, let's try to create a list of faucet types that will divide into two groups: faucets that don't matter and faucets that do matter.<n>Let's try 2-types-of-faucets at a time.<n>To start, start with the simplest: only consider a pair of round and oval faucets. Because it doesn't matter which type you choose, you can have as many of that type of faucet as you want.<n>Next, move on to pairs of oval-style and rounded-style faucets. This time, you need to have a division of 1. You can either divide each set by 1/3, or simply not create faucets of those styles.<n>Next, we reach the angled pair.  Since any other pair doesn't reach a satisfactory division of 1, this round-and-angular pair is our last remaining division type that matters. So this time, you can have 3 angular faucets for each round faucet.<n>Lastly, we have the square pair. This pairs with our round-only pair, meaning we are now stuck with square faucets not mattering. This way, you can have as a many of those as you want. <n>So the answer is 3 * 2 + 0 + 2<n>So the final answer if 8<n><n>Input: You have a book that has 2 even-numbered pages on one side and an odd-numbered page on the other.

Then she weighs a certain amount of candy coating, and puts it into the bowl, mixing everything together to make a batch of candy. She weighs the batch and notes the number of grams of candy coating in it. Later she weighs the entire batch again and finds that it has become 0.85 heavier than it was. She also notes the number of grans in the batch.<n>How many grams of candy were in the batch before she weighed it?<n>Output:Before she weighed the batch and it became 0.85 pounds heavier, there was 0.85 grams of candy and 0.045 grams of cocoa in it.<n>She used 121 grams of cocoa to coat the 0.85 kg of candy. Therefore, the cocoa in the batch before it was weighed was 121 - 0.04.5 = <<121-0.45=116.5>>116.5 grams.<n>Since the batch gained 0.85 (121 - 116.5), we can see the amount of candy by subtracting the amount of cocoa from the batch after it was weighed. We get 0.85 - (121 - (116.5) = <<0.85-121-116.5=2>>2 grams.<n>Therefore, 2 grams of candy existed that

Choices:  A: jail time B: fear C: going to prison D: nothing E: feeling of guilt<n>Output:		Let us have a closer look to see how the answer is determined.<n>Parsing 'A, B, C, D', we get:<n>A) Jail time. Jail time is a consequence. So 'A' is our answer.<n>B) Fear. If we have to take the consequence of committing a murder, we must feel frightened. So'B' is our answer. So the answer is 'A, B'.<n>C) Going to prison. If we take the consequence of commiting a murder, we must be sent to prison. So'C' is our answer. But 'C' is the only consequence that is a consequence, so it is not correct.<n>D) Nothing. It happens to us once we are convicted, but this is not part of the consequence, which is a consequence. So'D' is not our answer.<n>E) Feeling of guilt. If we are found guilty, we become guilty of the murder. So 'E' is our answer. To find which of the five are correct, we must get 5 of the seven values (3 answers) to equal 5. We need 5 out of 7 to become 'A', so we need 1 of 6 to become 'B'. 3 of the 6 that are not 'A' or 'B' contain 'E', so the answer is 'A', 'B', 'E'.<n><n>Input: Write a function that will find if given a string and an integer if the string contains the integer or not.<n>Output: Let's': be the string to be checked.

It was a what? Choices:  A: countryside B: anthology C: dull read D: state park E: surface of earth<n>Output:		Choice D is correct because the state park is only a small part of the country-side, and the show is likely to have a countryside theme. As far as the gardener, it may be that a whole episode will be about a garden (which is the state).<n>So A and D can both be eliminated<n>When considering B and E consider that anthologies are not usually made up of many distinct pieces, B is better<n>C refers only to the text of the book and not what kind of book it may be, which is incorrect because the description says that it isn't a book.

Choices:  A: stripes B: seat belts C: breaks to help stop D: tires E: radios<n>Output:		The correct answer depends on the car. If the car is a big sedan with a few people in it, then definitely A and D. This will help the car turn and also handle well so that the brakes will operate more effectively. That said, seat belts and radio should also be checked regularly because they both provide safe functions in the car. Stripes and brakes can help in making the car stop more quickly, but seat belts will prevent an accident from occuring.<n><n>Input: You have a 100-foot rope.

This alternating pattern never repeats itself because where the next dot should go is still uncertain. Also, the corners are not always crossed because the light and dark dots alternate on top of the same corner, so that they can alternate places in the middle of the line, while still having the dark line cover the entire corner. So the final choice is 4<n><n>Input: A man goes on a two-hour hike in the woods during the summer. It is about 50 degrees. He goes at a pretty steady 4 miles an hour.

Choices:  A: empowering B: regret C: despair D: glee E: sadness<n>Output:		Empowerment and regret are both emotional states that may or may not be related to an action that was done in response to a threat or an action that was unrelated to a threat but resulted in harm. There is no relationship between "fear" on the one hand, and "disempowerment" on the other. Therefore, the correct response to A is "incorrect." The relationship between C and D is that, although they are both negative emotions, they occur in two different scenarios. Furthermore, if one chooses to avoid C on one hand and D on the other, he or she would end up feeling glee or joy, neither of which is correct. The correct answer is C: Sadness is closely related to guilt. However, because despair is usually defined by the Bible as an extreme feeling of desperation and loss of hope and faith. The despair that I am referring to may involve "loss of empowerment" and/ or "loss of something that someone loves," but not necessarily. Furthermore, despair and sadness can coexist, both physically and emotionally. As a result, if I am feeling despair, I could be feeling sad, too, even if I am not feeling sad in and of itself.<n><n>Input:Sara and Corey each paid $32 dollars for dinner on Friday night, so they decided to split the bill.<n><n>Corey received change of $12.50 when he got home.<n><n>Sara counted 47 quarters when she got home.

Choices:  A: giggle B: lie C: laughing D: chuckle E: smoke<n>Output:		A person can giggle, laugh, chuckle, or smoke. A joke is a type of humor, so something has to make a person laugh to really be considered a joke. So, only laugh or chuckle could be choices for a person hearing a joke. From the choices given, we can see that only giggle does not apply, while all of laughing, chuckling, and smoking do. So, we must eliminate A, B, and D.<n>Now, we would need to decide if someone can chuckle or laugh or both when hearing a joke. We can see that chuckle and laugh do mean different things. For example, if they are both saying the same thing, but in different tones, it means something different. We would need something to differentiate how the person saying it feels about what was said. However, they are saying the same thing, so they cannot differentiate their emotions. So, we know that chuckling and laughing do not mean the same thing. We would need to use a different clue to help us figure out which emotion is used when someone hears a joke. For example, if the first part of A says "I laughed really hard at the _____, which made me..." then they use laugh. If the first part of B says "...I laughed, except I was lying there with ____..." then they use chuckle. Finally, we arrive at our solution.<n>This leaves us with 2 options. They could hear a joke and <n>giggle, which is the correct answer, or laugh, which is incorrect.<n>This option is true of the statement and must be chosen from among the options.<n><n><n>Directions: <n>* This problem requires you to solve a logical proof.<n>* Choose one option and then use all the information given to you to complete the logical proof.<n>    <n>     <n>### Instruction: Choose the option that contains the correct logical proof.

Choices:  A: selling out B: happy C: fishing D: receiving money E: getting paid<n>Output:		Fishing (selling what isn't actually what you want, but getting what you want is)<n>And that's the definition of getting paid.<n>When you're a successful artist, you're paid for your work.<n>So his fans didn't know what he was going for, but when he started selling out, they were happy and his success only increased.<n>By using his success and money to fund outlandish projects, he can keep producing amazing works of art.<n><n>Input: Fred and Mabel are bungee jumpers. Fred jumps first. If he lets go of the bungee for 5 seconds, Fred falls 100 feet. If Mabel jumps first, then she falls the same amount at Fred. How far will both Fred and Mabel land from where they let go?<n>Output: Since Fred is the first one to jump, and he falls 100 ft. for every 5 seconds he holds on the bungee, his total fall is (100x5 = <<5x100=500>>500 feet). <n>Since Mabel's total is the same as Fred's, they both land 500 ft. from where they let go.<n><n>Input: One night while walking with his wife, Billy trips and falls down a well. Billy's wife is extremely panicked. She drops down the well and is holding onto Billy and the rope holding them both up. She drops 2 feet every time she lets go. After one full round of climbing up, she is 12 feet down. How long until she is back on the ground, if each round she climbs up 2 feet.<n>Output: This question involves a variation on the traveling salesman problem(TSP), where Billy's wife is the traveling salesman. It is one of many similar problems for the TSP, where "traveling salesman" can be a person/figure sliding down the rope and "cities" become the feet of the rope. The TSP itself, where the goal is to find the shortest path that visits every city, can be considered equivalent to a problem in computer science. To see if Billy's wife fell through her own path when solving the TSP would be redundant.<n>1. The goal of the TSP is to visit every city

If you start taking tiles from the bottom row of it, how do you find out which number of tiles the chessboard can hold?<n>Answers: First, we consider a single rectangle as a chessboard. In a rectangle, there are different types of chess pieces in number. If a single rectangle contains 36 tiles, then it would contain 18 tiles of type 'A', 20 tiles of type 'B', and 8 tiles of type "C". Then, we could say that the maximum number of tiles that a single rectangle can have is equal to (18 + 20) (maximum no of 'A' or 'B' tile) + 8 (maximum no of C tile). If there are 'A', 'B', 'C' tile, the maximum number of tiales are of (1+2+3) types. Thus, after summing it up, the chessboard can take in maximum of 18 tiles.<n>Input: There is a square room, with a 6-by-6 grid of squares on the floor. If there are N tiles of a certain type out of the 36 total square, what is the sum of their area?<n>Answer:If the maximum number of tile of a type are m, then total area of tile of a is equal to N*2*m and thus total area of tile a is equal to N*(2*m

One costs 1000 dollars. They try a second model, and it costs 3000 dollars. Which cash register would be a better bang for their money?<n>Output: The correct choice is the cash register that costs $1000. The answer is not the cashier that costs 300 because although it costs more it provides a better value. For two numbers, a = b and c = d, if a + d = c + b, then d = -a. If a = 3000 and d = -1000, the following is the equation: d = 300 and -3000 = 1000. This means that the cash register price is at $1000<n><n>Input: What number goes in the blank to make this fraction equal?  $$\frac20 5$$.<n>Output: The correct number would be 2/5.

Choices:  A: wishing well B: kitchen C: hardware store D: garage E: utility room<n>Output:		I. It is clear when the article says the janitor is putting his pail out that it refers to leaving it in an empty place.<n>Therefore, it must be a, not B, C, D or E.<n>II. The key to this question is the word 'in' in the sentence. The implication is that the janitor is putting the pail 'into' an empty place.<n>Thus, the place 'cannot be out' or 'on top of' the washing machine as in A or B.<n>Though the pail may be in a shelf as in C, a shelf alone does not fill the requirements for the answer.<n>Therefore, the pail is 'in the garage', as in D.<n><n>Input:Jim and Jan like basketball.

What might he have been feeling? Choices:  A: pressure B: death C: trying harder D: quitting E: winning or losing<n>Output:		Let's consider each of the choices.Pressure might cause a person to become irritable, but it shouldn’t make them feel death, trying harder, quitting, or winning or losing.<n>Death might be a feeling, but it is more likely that a person would feel overwhelmed, sad, or exhausted rather than death.<n>Trying harder might cause a person to feel overloaded or overwhelmed, but it should not make them want to quit.<n>A person might quit when they are being paid to do a job, but not to compete in a race.<n>The emotion you feel when you either win or lose would be determined by your mood or the way you feel about yourself.<n>So if someone feels great about themselves, they will be happy when they win the race and sad when they lose the race.<n>Let’s consider choices A, C, and E. A person might feel pressure, try harder, and become overwhelmed when they compete because these are all emotions that the person would usually feel when they compete. However, they would not normally feel death, dying or dying themselves. So the answer is D: Trying harder, death or dying, trying, and competing<n>So the final answer would be 'D: Trying harder'<n><n>Input: A store had 3 blue dresses, 1 pink dress, and 4 red shirts.

Choices:  A: get arrested B: problems C: sober D: intoxication E: pleasure<n>Output:		The possibilities include all of the above. A person might purchase beer to intoxicate himself, but that would likely result in being arrested. Being drunk is obviously no fun; the answer would be E if D or E are equally likely. Buying beer to get arrested is a terrible idea as well; the answer would be A if C is equally likely. Buying alcohol to sober up is foolish; the answer is B in that case, even if A and B are equally likely. Buy alcohol to intoxicate oneself is the most intuitive answer; I'm using this to eliminate D. The only option remaining is E.<n>So the final Answer is E<n><n>Input:A person has a 63% chance of being able to park their car successfully in a narrow spot, if the width of the space is at least 61 centimeters, regardless of the height of the space. What is the person's chance of successfully parking their car in a spot that has a height of 2 1/2 cm greater than the width?<n>Output:The question states that the person has a 62.5% chance of parking in spaces with a width of at least 63 centimeters, even when the height is taken into consideration. This means that the person will fail to park if the width is less than 61 centimens. The question then asks what the person's chance is of successfully parking in a spot with a height of 5 centimeters greater than the width. This means that the space has a width of 63 - 5 = <<63-5=18>>18 centimeters...<n>Continue reading>>> (Click HERE)<n><n>Input: A person has two dice. The probability that they will roll a 5 is 5/36, because that is the number of sides of a die. However, even though 5 is one of the numbers on the die, it is actually counted twice (1 and 6). Similarly, there is a 4/36 chance of rolling a 4, because a 4 is counted twice (1/2 and 2/2). In fact, every number on the die except the number that is being rolled is counted twice, meaning that the probability of rolling a number (in terms of the numbers on the dice) is the probability of not rolling that same number.

Input:Never<n>Output:It looks to me like you need the number of miles divided by the number of miles until you arrive. So, by plugging in the numbers for this problem, we get 3 divided by 2. 3 goes into 2 (remainder of 1) exactly 4 times so the answer to when the gas station will be reached is 3/2, 4/5, 6/7, 8/9,......(ad infinitum). There 100th part of this number will be about the amount of time it will take to reach the gas station. So, when 3/2 + 1 = 50, you'll be there.<n>So the answer is 3/2 or: 1.5<n><n>Input:The book store is on the same side as the clock store. The clown store is half way between the bookstore and the clockstore. The bicycle store is four blocks further past the book and clock stores. If the bicycle store is on what side of the clock store is the clown store?<n>Output:The clown store is on the same<n>side as the bookstore. The clown is on the halfway point between the Bookstore and<n>the clock store. Because we know this halfway point, we can use the slope formula: rise -<n>run = m. We know the run is half. We know how far the bicycle store must be from<n>the halfway point. And, we know that the bicycle store will not be on the other side<n>of the clock and bicycle store's mid point to the clockstore. We can now plug the<n>info into the formula and get r: 1/2 - 4 = m.<n>So the answer 2/5<n>

Taking the square root of both sides and simplifying, we get (x-2)(x+2) = 0. This equation cannot be solved, so we look for values of x for which (x+2) = (x-2) =0.<n>We find x = 2 and x= -2. Since x = 2 would make x+2 bigger than 2, x cannot equal 2. So x = -2 must be the correct answer.<n><n>Output: Tapanga and Pete share 42 candies altogether. Tapanga has 17 more than Pete. How many candies do Pete have?<n>Input: The total is the answer. This is represented

What is Sarah doing...<n><n>Input: There are some people outside on the bench on a cold winter's day. The kids on the first bench have an expression in their eyes that they've never been here before. They look as if they are trying to get the courage to do something that is scary for them. The children on the second bench have an expression of being confident. They know where they are going and seem to know what to do when they get there. The children on the third bench are acting as the tourist, as they just arrived, and are looking around and taking pictures. They do not have any idea as to where they are going, nor do they seem to know what to bring on their journey. So, what bench does a character belong to?<n>Output:The kids on the first and second bench were adventurous and have lots of courage. They are on bench I and bench II. The children on the first bench are on bench I because they are scared and have no way to go. The children on the bench are on benchs II because they feel that they are ready for anything. The adventurous kids are sitting on bench I. The children who are taking pictures of the view and walking around are on bench III because they do not know where they are headed, nor do they have any way of getting there. They do not know that they belong on bench III. The children who are adventurous are on bench I since they have no plan and do not know what to do. They belong on bench II. So the final answer is bench II.
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve.

Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input:Where are people likely to stand at an intersection? Choices:  A: cars B: city street C: street corner D: fork in road E: at a red light<n>Output:		A possible reason for people standing at a red light is because they have to wait for the signal to change. Cars and drivers should also wait for that signal to change.<n><n>Cars should wait at the intersection itself.<n>All other types of people should be at the intersection because all other types can walk on any street of the intersection except when they are walking on the path.<n>A and B are incorrect because they are both vehicles. C is also incorrect, as the corner of the intersection is the intersection of a lot of streets so people would be walking in the street or sidewalk.<n>So the correct answer is D<n>

A is true and B is true, but C and D are false.<n><n>Output: Statement A is true and B false,<n>We know that if you start at any square, it is possible to go back to every square. This means that each square on the board is connected to each other by different paths. Therefore, no doubling back is necessary.<n>This means that each square has two possible paths but it is only possible to go from one square to the next in one direction and not the other, meaning we cannot go through the top row first<n>This means that there are only four possible paths between every square together. But when it comes to starting in Zebra territory one can get to the bottom square but not through the top line.<n>Whilst it is possible to reach every square one cannot go back through the top row, this is possible. This is why we cannot go back through the zebra territory as we cannot get to the top row.<n>If we start in the first row we can't go by jail since it is in zebra territory. But if the same square is a castle square, then the opposite square is not in zebra territory, and so it is possible to make the same route back.<n>So C is

Let’s discuss all the options: B: Surprised, the word "surprised" or shocked is used by people who have given up and are saying "what if it doesn't work". This is something you want to avoid like the plague. A:  Hatred will lead you to lose your confidence and focus. You must develop a love and passion for what you do and dedication to never give up. E: Someone that constantly looks for the solution rather than the problem is the kind of person we are building.  D: Dedication is another key that is missing from the options.

One day, he accidentally ate all of his jelly beans, so he has no more jelly beans until he goes to a friends' house for dinner. This friend's house has a bowl of marshmallows on top of the fridge. It's unclear what kind of marshmallow it is. It's probably regular marshmallows, but there's a 40 percent chance that it's peppermint-flavored marshmallows. Johnathan makes only 1 cup of hot chocolate with 2 marshmallows in it. What is the chance that Johnathan will have a peppermint marble?<n>Output: If the marshmallow is peppermint flavored, then the correct answer is x = 30% / 2 = 15%.<n>However, if the marshmallow isn't peppermint flavoured, then the correct answer becomes 100% - x = 65%.<n>Then, the chances of getting a peppermint-marble are 100%-x.

You need to find the GCF, or Greatest Common Factor, from the given numbers. We have to do that using the factoring method. It is important to understand that the only factor that is common to the given numbers is 1, and that’s why we have to use that as the GCF of both the numbers. If there were no factors common between the numbers, we will consider the larger number to be the GCF.<n><n>Second: This is another simple problem we need to solve. It has to do with the factorial of given numbers. You can start with this problem by using the long division method, then factor it out as much as you can. You will end up finding the GCF of your numbers.<n><n>Now, this is slightly advanced stuff in math. This is probably the

He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input:What prevents someone from getting sleep at night? Choices:  A: relax B: dreams C: have nightmares D: restlessness E: snore<n>Output:		The correct answer is B. Restlessness keeps people awake at night. The other answers are wrong.<n><n>Input: What does the weather forecast predict for Sunday morning? Choices: A: Sunny B: Overcast C: Light drizzle D: Heavy rain E: Snow<n>Output: The correct choice is C, which is light drizzle. All other choices give us weather other than what is predicted.<n><n>Input: Danny and Ricky both drive Ford Mustang GTs. Danny claims his car is faster than Ricky's. Ricky, in turn, thinks his car is faster than Danny's. Who is right? How do you know?<n>Output:In order to settle the dispute, they decide to race. Let us examine the cars to determine who actually wins the race. Suppose the speed of Danny's car is x and the speed of Ricky's car is y. Also suppose the initial position of Ricky is <<0, y>>0, y, and the initial position of Danny is <<x, 0>>x, 0. We will want to find which of them has a greater speed.<n><n>Thus, x + y = 100<n><n>Since Danny's car weighs less than Ricky's (as he has yet to customize the engine), we know Danny's car has to move faster (in order to travel the same distance in the same amount of time). So: <<0, 100>>0, 10<n><n>The only way x can be less than 100 but greater than zero, is if x = <<23=23>>23<n><n>This means Danny's car gets to the same finish line as Ricky's in less time than Ricky. Danny therefore won the race.<n><n><n>#####<n><n>***<n><n>#####<n>

The popcorn stands would be too far away. So, the person would probably see popcorn and cotone, at a fairground. The person might see popcorn if he happens to just look around at some movies and he sees popcorn or coton candy near the movie theatre, but it would not always be there. In a movie theatre, popcorn is sold and coton candy are usually sold in places that would have food booths.The countryside, a state park or a fairground are all places that there is likely to be cotton candy or popcorn on the grass.<n>So, the final answer is B<n><n>Input: Two teams of 6 people plan to go on a 5 mile hike.

A diary is something where we write our thoughts, feelings, and ideas, so it's not where we'd read a passage but not where we'd write it. The Bible and the city are where we might read a passage.  The city is something that you would walk through (read), so it's not it. The Bible is where we read a passage and don't write it, so it's wrong, too.

You are also looking to buy 2 pairs of pants, which are $25 each. Finally, you can spend $25 on 1 pair of shoes. How much money do you have remaining if you spend the money you have on items without exceeding your budget?<n>Output: The first step to solve the problem is by subtracting the total cost of everything we bought, $95, and making a list of how much we have left over. So we subtract 2 * 95 = 190 and we get $105.<n>The second step is to figure out how much we can spend on a single pair of shoes so that we do not exceed budget. Since we already spent $25, our budget is now $75, so we need the $75 for all of the remaining items that we are looking to buy.<n>Now lets go back to our list of what we bought to find a total. We bought

If the entire day is made up of 16 hours, then each half of the day is 8 hours. However, that assumes that each hour is exactly the same amount of time. This is clearly incorrect, as we can easily see that each hour should actually be slightly <5> than the next hour. For instance, if a day is made of 16 hours of driving, then we can see that the 12th hour must be 12/16 of the day, but the 13th and 14th hours must both be less than 12/12 of the day. This would give us a situation for each half of the day where the 3rd to 9th hours are less than 8 hours. However this is clearly not accurate. Hence, we must conclude that since the aliens require 8 hours to make one car, each half of the day takes roughly 4 hours.<n>

Subtracting again will get 18.<n>So the final result is that the last 4 digits will be 18<n><n>Input:A and B are the initial letters of four different months in a year. A+B equals C. A-B

Choices:  A: military base B: opera C: water fountain D: bus stop E: church<n>Output:		Jumping jacks are most commonly done at military bases. This makes perfect sense, as jumping jacks need to be learned in gym class before you can proceed to the more advanced calisthenics like chin-ups. At opera or church? Maybe some people are doing it silently. But people don't do jumping jacks at either of those places to show that they are excited. Therefore, jumping jacks are NOT typically done at opera or church. Jumping jacks take a lot of energy, and not many people have it at the water fountain, or on the bus stop. However, if a person does their jumping jacks where they can see a military base, there's a good chance they're thinking about joining the war. So all the people you see doing jumping jacks near the military base are likely joining the war.<n>So the answer is military base<n><n>Input:Where can you see someone carrying a suitcase at work?<n><n>Choices: A: coffee shop B: home C: airport D: hospital E: library F: museum <n><n>Output:A: airport<n>B: home<n>C: library<n>D: hospital<n><n>So the two choices that can NOT be seen as work place are home and library<n><n>Input:  Choose the best answer for the following statement: You can be at work at the same time you are on vacation.

So the profit for every order depends on how big the pizza is: if it's a medium-sized cake, the owner makes $1  every time it's ordered.<n>Therefore, an owner could try to maximize his profit if he orders an equal mix of cakes: 5 medium pizzas, 5 small pizzas, and 2 big pizzas.<n>So the final  answer is  5,5,2<n><n>Input: You have 10 marbles in one cup, 24 marbles in second cup and 21 marbles in the third cup.

We know that suicide causes death. But when a person who is depressed commits suicide, it's very likely that he or she does it because they find it hard to cope with the feeling of depression. In other words, that person is depressed because suicide causes death. So it's not the other way around.<n>Similarly, if a person who is depression is killed because of their depression, that person is hardly depressed at all. Since the result of such a killing will lead to the death of the victim, there is likely no depression there.<n>So the answer is 'A.'

Let's say that we have two equations instead of one. These two equations must have the same number of symbols. Therefore, our number of symbols is x+y. Our values for x and y are going to be either 4 or 2. So that means we now have two equations. First we have (x+4, x=2) and (2+2, x=4). Now we plug in our variables. (2, 4) is an equation we can solve. So our first equation is satisfied, and our second equation is not satisfied. That equation was solved incorrectly. <n>Then we have (x+x). That doesn't work either. It's still not an equation. There are no symbols in it. Next, we have (x-z). This is our only equation that could possibly work. But now we plug it in! x=3, y=1.

How many pounds of apples did he have left?<n>Output: To begin, we can cross off the options for 'b' and 'd' because they don't make sense: 4 pounds is not enough for 3 families of 7 people to each consume one pound of apples on their own.  'e' is just 'a', so cross that off as well: 2 pounds isn't enough for each of 14 people to get an apple.  1/2 of 5 pounds is 2 1/2 pounds, 2 1/4 pounds, 2 2/4 pounds, or 2 3/4 pounds is enough for 3 families to each eat one-quarter of an apple apiece.<n>The remaining options are 3/4, 4/9, 7/14, and 2 1/3. But each of these options would require 3/8 of an apple of 5 pounds for one-quarter, or 3 pounds for a whole apple.<n>Therefore, the final answer is 3 3/8 pounds<n><n>Input: When he was a little boy, Mark asked his mother how old she was.

He lives on his own. Where does he live? Choices:  A: fish market B: pet shop C: great outdoors D: river E: little mermaid<n>Output:		A blowfish is not a real fish.<n>"Free" is not an adjective that is typically applied to animals.<n>"Own" is an adjective that is frequently applied to animals.<n>Since a blowfish does not live in a shop, does not live in the river, does not live in a movie, and is not free to be able to visit places, the only choice that makes sense to me is that a blowfish lives on his own. Therefore, I choose choice B, the pet shop.<n>

Choices:  A: do crossword puzzle B: see art C: give up D: grocery shop E: play chess<n>Output:		The words “bog” and “bore” only occur twice in that dictionary.<n>The word “grocer” only occurs once, and it is listed after “abhorre” on page 24.<n>Therefore, the answer is A) do crossword puzzle.<n><n>Input:The word “abhorre” occurs more than once in a large dictionary. What do these words have in common? Choices: A: they occur after the word “grocer” on page 25 B: they occur after each other more than 5 pages apart C: they appear in the top 100 most-frequently-occurring words in the top 150<n>Output:The words in this puzzle can occur in a dictionary in any order. Thus, there is no order-concern, and the answer is B) they occur after each other. The two words that appear at least five pages apart are “abhorre” and “abhorred” which are listed on page 24 and 47, respectively.<n>If you’re trying to count how many pages of a dictionary the word “abhorred” occurs after “abhorre”, you’ll find that the answer is 47 less 24 = <<47-24=23>>23.<n>This is because most dictionaries list words in alphabetical order.<n><n>Input:If two words occur after each other in a dictionary and the first of them appears in alphabetical order at the top of the dictionary, which word appears in alphabetical order after the second word? Choices: A) the first word B) none of the above: The first word does not appear in alphabetical order after itself, because alphabetical order depends on the letters that precede it.<n>We know that it follows the preceding word in alphabetical order, but it does not follow itself in alphabetical order. Thus, the answer is B) none of the other words. It is impossible for another word to appear in alphabetical order right after the second word, since the second word has come first. For example, consider the page with “abhorre”, “abhorred”, and “abhorrence”.<n>If the second word were to come before the first word, the second word would be “abhorred”, followed immediately by the first word “abhorre”. Then we would have “abhorre” followed

Choices:  A: jail B: internet cafe C: blacksmith's shop D: building E: bar<n>Output:		Let us examine all the choices to determine the correct solution.<n>If the answer is A, we know that the stool has to have legs, which we can infer from the question since it mentions the word legs. The question then begs the important question: Can a person build or make something that is already complete? No! So we eliminate A.<n>If the answer to the question is B, we know that the building has to contain Internet Cafe, which we can infer as a valid inference of the question. From the options, we can rule out the choices D, F, G, and H because these choices do not talk about the internet cafe. The question then begans to ask a very important question: How many choices are there for a stool? There are six! We get our answer from this question because 6=<<18=18>>18 stools have 6 choices. We then choose the set which contains the internet cafe by selecting the choice B. So the final answer is B<n><n>Input: Choose a choice from the choices A,B, and C to solve a puzzle to determine which choice is correct.<n>A: If a is chosen, and if b can be chosen, and if c can be chosen, then d can be chosen.<n>B: If b is chosen, and if c is chosen, and if d cannot be chosen, then a cannot be chosen.<n>Correct: The solution to the problem can be found by analyzing which letters of the above statements could be chosen (in our example, it would be B and D, respectively). Looking at the first statement, we know that if A is chosen, then B cannot be chosen. Likewise, we know that if B is chosen, we cannot choose C. In the second statement, we know that C cannot be chosen, but no matter what choice we make we still can choose D, so A and B must be chosen. But because they cannot be chosen at the same time, we know that the statement is false. A and B were both chosen, making the second statement incorrect and the first statement true. So the first statement is B, meaning that if B is chosen then D cannot be chosen. Choosing B first, we know that D cannot be chosen from the second statement, indicating that it must be chosen from the first. So B, D, and C are chosen, as given by the first statement. The first statement is true, so A

They have $20 each, and the price of gas is $4 per gallon. They choose to get exactly as much gas as their money will buy. What is the least amount of gas they can buy?<n>Output: To find the minimum amount of gas they can get, we have to solve this equation:<n>x + 3x + 3x = $20<n>From here, we can subtract 3x from both sides, thus getting x = <<3x=12>>12, and then divide both sides by 3.

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input:The department store is located in the Northwest USA.

They are evenly divided between the math and science sections.  How many students are in each segment?Choice:<n>math: <n>Science: <n>Output:<n><n><br><n><br><n><n><n>### Instruction:Answer the follow- ing true or false questions.<n><n>1. What is meant by x2 + y2 = z2?<n><n>Input: The x and y in question refers to "coordinates" in the two-dimensional coordinate plane, where each coordinate is a number from 0 to 10 and the letters x and y represent the "lines" in this plane that run horizontally and vertically, respectively.The + and - symbol in "x2+y2" means "add" or "subtract". So what this means is "Take the squares (powered by two, or twice) of the x coordinate, add the squares of the y coordinate, and the final result is the equation of the triangle that can be formed with the points in each segment."<n>2. True or False: If y = x + 1, then 2y = 3x. This statement is true, for the equations are not the same thing, and are thus not the same thing as the variables that they correspond to. The equation "y" = "x" + 1 is a general linear equation for y that relates the y to x, and if we substitute x + 1 for the y, the corresponding equation that matches the form "(x + 1)(x)" is 2x = 3x. The variable, "x", is only mentioned once in the corresponding equation, and therefore does not match the corresponding equation exactly. <n><n>

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input:Where would a human expect to find manufacturing operations? Choices:  A: factory B: school C: grocery store D: band E: aircraft<n>Output:		A human would certainly expect to find factory operations where people make things. But I'm pretty sure it's not where people make schoolwork. Where people grocery shop would be a really bad place for assembly line operations. Where people perform wind-power technology would probably be the most unlikely place to find manufacturing operations. However, I could definitely see how someone doing airplane maintenance would consider an airplane a manufacturing operations center.<n>So the final choice of an answer would be A<n><n>Input: Let's pretend we are playing a simplified version of chess where there are only 4 squares: A,B,C,D, and white and black each get one. To play the game, white makes a move and then black makes a move in response. How many moves deep into the game can they go before no one makes a move?<n>Output: The answer is 2 and that is because they cannot go 3 moves deep because the last move is considered stalemate. So they would keep iterating with the 3 moves until they arrived at a stalemate.<n><n>Input: D is closer to Z than A is to Z. How close is B to Z?<n>Output: D is 4 units closer to Z than A. 4 + 2 = 6 units closer to Z<n><n>Input: Let x be a real number between 1 and 4 that is not an integer. What is the sum of the first 20 multiples of x?<n>Output: x is between 1 and 3. x=2 because it is between 1 and (4+1). First, x is not an integer because integer's go from like 1 to 10. Next, x is between 2 and 3. I will add 20 times 2 and 20 times 3 and then I will subtract 20 times 1.<n>20 * 2 = 40<n>20 * 3 = 60<n>60 - 40 = 20<n>20 * (2 + 3) = 42<n>2 * 42 = 84<n>So, the solution is 84<n><n>Input: A student takes 6 fewer apples per day than her dad.

How many people are in front of you and how many people are behind you?<n>Output: At first glance, it looks like you are in front of three people, with three people behind you for a total of six, but this answer is not correct. Let x = the number of people in front of you.<n>There are x - 3 people behind you. You can see that x - 3 isn't equal to 3, so the answer to this problem is x - 3 = <<5-3=2>>2<n>Since x - 3 = 2, we find that there are 5 people in front of you and 2 people behind you.<n>So the final awnswer is 5<n><n>Input: In a party, there are 25 people talking to each other (that is, they are standing close near each other). Now, assume 1 of them leaves, then another (they both walk by your friend), then another (who does not see his friend because he left). He is so distressed that he walks out of the party. How many more people join in the party than leave?<n>Output: Let X be the first friend who leaves, and y be the second friend who leaves. So, we know that 1 + 1 = 2.<n>Now let z = the first friend who walks out. Thus, we know that 2 + z = 25.<n><n>Let u be the third friend who walks out the party. We know that 25 - u = 3.<n><n>Now let u be the friend who walks in the party. So 3u = 25. For 3u, we have three cases:<n>1) 3*25 = 75<n>2) 3*0 = 0<n>3) 3*1 = 3<n>

One day she counts 19 zebras. How many zebras does the zoo have?<n>Output: A zookeeper wants to count the number of zebra in a zoo. For each zebra, there are two possible ways of counting zebras. One way is to count a new zebra, and the other way is to count another zebra. For each zebrat to be counted, it takes an hour. This can also be described as follows. The zookeeper's process of counting zebra can be represented by an algorithm, of the form zebraCount(n) = zebraCount(zebraCount(n-1)) + 1. After zebraCount(19), the zookeeper has counted 19 zebra, because she counts each zebra twice. Therefore, zebraCount(20) = 19.<n>So the zebraCount(30), and zebraCount(40), would be 2 and 4 respectively.<n>In other words, a zebrakeeper can count all the zebra in a one-time using the following equation for all zebra x, zebra(x) = (zebra(x-1) + 1). The process of counting the zebra is represented by the following flow diagram<n><n>Input: A family rents a van, then they go to a gas station to fill the van up with gas.<n>They spend 2 dollars to fill it up with gas.<n>The gas mileage of their car is 25 miles per gallon.<n>They are driving somewhere that takes 5 hours to get there.<n>How much did the family spend to get their to their destination?<n>Output:<n>The family wants to get to their final destination, where they will travel for 5 hours.

He wanted to know the truth for he did not want to continue existing because what he is existing in is ignorance and he wants to know what is the truth.<n>However, the choice he thinks to find out the truth for is actually an in-between. His want to find the truth is to not continue existing and that is the ignorance that he is existing in since he already knows that the truth is not between the choices B and A.  Since choice D is also available he wanted to find the truth. However, in the end he still wants to know if the truth is in between the choices. He could not find the truth. So instead he exists in ignorance.<n><n>Input: Choices:  A : 10 B : 6 C : 5 D : 13 <n>Output:  When the question is restated, it is possible to find the answer using binary numbers.<n>We can translate 10 into 1010, and 6 into 110, and 5 into 101 and 13 into 111.<n>So from left to right, the binary numbers are: 11_01_10_11 = <<11011>>11011 = 69<n><n><n>So the binary choice is C<n>

Choices:  A: ungulate B: bomber C: body armor D: tank E: hat<n>Output:		A: Ungulate means animal that lives above ground. Cows and sheep are examples of this. However, many large animals such as elephants and rhinos usually live in jungles.<n>To protect oneself from a cannon, one would wear anything other than ungulate.<n>B:Bomber is something worn during flight or aerial warfare to protect the wearer. Because a cannon is a weapon that fires at ground targets, wearing a bomber would provide no protection at all.<n>C:This refers to a garment made with a bullet proof liner. It is used by law enforcement, the military, and by some civilians to stop bullets from attackers when worn. Thus body armor would be able to protect someone from a cannon.<n>D: A tank is a military vehicle used primarily to move artillery. However it's primary job is to fight other tanks, not to protect civilians, as the cannon in question is.<n>E: A hat is a protective headgear. While it can provide protection from the sun, it can only be worn by humans, not large animals, and would be no benefit to our example.<n>Therefore the correct answer is C<n><n>Input: A cowboy has 65 cacti. While riding a horse 10 cacti fall to the ground. What is the total number of cacti left on the horse?<n>Output: The first thing to do is multiply the initial number of cacti (65) by 10 to get the new number of cacti. 10 times a number (n) plus n or 10n + n, is always equal to 2n.<n>Six times ten plus six is 60, which rounds up to 65.<n>To get the correct answer, take 60 + 65 = 125

If we assume this person is driving a <<20=260>>260 foot long car, we can say a quarter of that car is sticking above water. In a city, a quarter of the car being submerged would require <<13=13>>13 feet of water. With <<20=280>>280 people per square mile there would not be <<13=11>>11 square miles (11 times <<20=200>>200 foot long blocks) with <<13=1>3>>10 feet of water. Therefore the car would not be happy to take down a river.<n>If you are driving along a highway, we would recommend that if your city has an average 5.5% more people than the national average, you would be driving in a city - and should probably leave 9 miles around you for other traffic.<n> <n>We recommend a parking lot when the average length of a lot is <<30=30>>30 feet in length. Also, if the lot has an average depth of<n><<30=300>>300 ft, it is probably a parking lot.<n><n>If the entire lot is about 3x3 blocks, they are probably parked in an average home; If the entire lot is about the length of one block, they may be parked in a city.<n><n>A repair shop requires that you be <<8=3>>3 miles from a major highway (probably <<25=16>>16 miles from any other highway). <n><n>If the repair shop is 3.5 miles away from you, then we can tell that you are driving in a city.<n>A friend's house requires <<8=5>>5 miles from the freeway.<n><n>If you have an average friend, you will be <<8=9>>9 miles away from a major highway.<n><n>Now if the repair shop is on the other side of a city (<<8=8>>8 miles from the last highway) and

He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input:What do horses do to get energy? Choices:  A: eat grass B: play C: kept in stables D: dominated E: drink coffee<n>Output:		I have chosen A, but there is much more complex. Eating grass is not the only way that helps them to get their energy. They also love jumping fences, playing in the field, hobbling around piles of manure, and even rolling in their own dung. So they do not only have grass. But they are still a healthy animal and this is important to remember.<n><n>Input: A cowboy was giving away all his gold on a road. The problem, as he was giving away the gold he found a diamond in it. The problem is that if he kept it he could have 3 times as much gold. He had no place to put the diamond and if he continued giving away the gold, that meant the cowboys would all end up with diamonds. So what should he do with the diamond?  Let $n$ be the number of cowboys at his disposal and the cost of gold at \$$1/unit$$$.<n>Output: As the number of cowboies is $n$, since $n$ is a natural number, there is a whole factorial $n!$ number of combinations:<n><n>$$<n>\begin{array}{ll}<n>1 \le \mathrm{diamonds} \le \frac{3}{2n}$$<n>Now for each possibility we find for how much does the cowboy loses, if he keeps the diamonds:<n>$$\begin{array}{l}<n>\text{Keeping the diamonds for 1$\ge$diamonds$\ge$1} \\<n>\begin{array}[t]{lcl}<n>& & \\<n>\text{Keep the diamonds,} & \text{give away the remaining gold,}<n>& \text{get 1$\ge$(\$1/unit/3$\ge$unit)} \cdot 2n<n>\end{array}<n>\end{array}$$<n>Hence the minimum profit from the diamond is:<n>$$<n>\overbrace {\text{Profit by keeping the diamonds}} -<n>\underbrace {\text{Profits by giving away all the gold (since keeping the most possible diamonds is also maximizing the profit) }}<n>$$<n>Hence the minimum is to keep 1$\ge$the number of diamonds and give away all the rest.<n>$$<n>\begin {align}<n>\overbrace

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input:The jar was plastic, just like most of the stuff in the kitchen.  John preferred glass, and wished he was somewhere else.  Where does he want to be? Choices:  A: cupboard B: anywhere else C: everything D: own home E: garbage dump<n>Output:		John preferred glass, and the jar was made from plastic.<n>From John's perspective, the jar must be:<n>plastic jars are in B,C,E<n>glass jars are in A<n>John must prefer the B option, so the final answer is B<n><n>Input: Alicia has $100. She spends $30 on a present for her brother, $16 on a bottle of wine, and $5 on a present for her sister. She saves $10 and gives $5 to a charity. How much does Alicia have left over?<n>Output: Alicia has money left over.<n>She spent 54 dollars ($100 - $30 - $16 - 5) and she has 45 dollars left ($30 + $16).<n>So she has 45 - 54 = -19 dollars remaining, she has money left over. But what does that represent?<n>Five dollars is a measly amount and, in fact, may be what is left over after Alicia rounds the money to the nearest dollar but, since the problem is solved and doesn't ask for it, you may ignore the 5.<n>Forty five dollars is $45.00.<n>So this represents money left over after Alici rounded the cash to the nearest dollar.<n>She spent one whole dollar less on her wine than originally given, meaning she rounded her money to the nearest doller.<n>So Alicia's bill comes out to $45.01<n>Alicia's bill is $45.<n>To avoid double counting, only the last dollar is counted as rounding, since it appears she rounded to the nearest dollar by a minimum of one.<n>45 - 45 = 0<n>She has no money left over, when rounded for the cash rounding problem.<n>So the final is 0<n><n>Input: The classroom looked like a bomb had gone off.

Make sure you fully explain your answer.\n\n### Rationales:\nA business restaurant could be located anywhere a business could be located.\nThese locations include a mall, small business sector, hotel, town, or yellow pages.\n\n#### Yellow pages\n\nIn other words, a business hotel is found in the place where all the restaurants are found. Businesses often list their restaurants in the yellow pages. For this reason, it is safe to assume that the yellow pages will be located in the place where the business sector is located.\n\nHowever, the mall is another place that all businesses should be located.\nTherefore, a business restaurant could exist in the same place as the yellow pages.\nIt is also possible that the business restaurant exists in a business hotel.\n\nWhen looking for a business, the most common and safest option is to look in the yellow pages.\nYet, the most convenient answer is the business hotel.\nBusinesses often list their hotels in yellow pages or town directories.\nThis means that businesses can be found in both yellow pages and towns.\n\n#### Y\n\n#### Y\nIn response to this question, we can safely assume that a business restaurant can exist anywhere a business can exist.\nA business is found in the mall because all businesses tend be in the mall.\nThe most practical way to find a business restaurant is to find the business hotel where all the restaurants in the hotel can be found.\nThe most logical place to find a restaurant is in the yellow pages. However, this is the most dangerous answer because there are a lot of businesses found in the yellow pages. A better answer is the business hotel since it can be found in both the mall and the yellow pages.\n#### X\n\n### Discursive task\n\nInput:The table below shows the estimated profit of a company (in thousands of dollars) over three months.\n\n\n|           |     Jan.       |     Feb.       |     Mar.       |\n| :------- | :-------------: | :------------: | :-------------- |\n| Apr.     | $250               | $450              |  $500           |\n| May      | $225               | $350              | \t  $2", "answer": "D: business sector"}

People must often travel outside to pay the station attendant, so they may pick up a phone to call family and friends. Therefore, people are more likely to see a telephone booth near a gas station than anywhere else because customers usually go there to purchase or sell gas.\n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine a gas station located at a highway intersection. People often stop at a gas station that is located across the street from the intersection. They then travel to the other side and buy gas. Many people travel and visit gas stations, so there is a higher likelihood for people to see a telephone near a gas station.\n\n### Input\n\nHow many times has Harry walked around the track?

How will this affect the equilibrium price of a loaf of bread in your city?\n\n### I believe at some point in the future the price will change slightly in an upward direction. But this is more likely to happen once the first few people get used to the rate increase. I think that people who were making $10 an hour will most likely find jobs that pay more since a number of people who make \\$10 an hour will be out of a job since with the minimum wage raise other companies decide to reduce their labor force or cut their labor force by 1.\n\n### In other words, companies hire people for $11-12 an hour instead of $10. So if it is not that different of a raise in employers wages, then people will start losing their jobs when they are not required.\n\n### But the same can be said for the companies that make a smaller profit or are forced to raise their prices if all this leads to a lower volume of buyers when a company cannot make a profit off their services.\n\n### However, this isn't necessarily wrong. Sometimes more money in your pocket is better, and I would rather have $12.50 per hour versus $10 an hour.", "answer": "A: restaurant"}

Every time someone steps on a square tile, they leave an imprint which shows the side of a square. In order to leave the perfect square imprint, each step needs to be 1/16 mile long. However, if the imprint is 1/16 inch wide it is too small for someone to notice if they walk on the tile again. How many miles long do you have to walk to leave an imprint of a square just a mile in length?\nRationales\nThe perimeter of a square, P, is P = 4(s), where (s) is the side of the square.

We can rewrite 66 + 66 = <<66+66=132>>132 as 132 = x, we are asked to solve for x. So we multiply 132 by 2 and simplify, 264 = x, now we divide by 2. We solve for x and the answer is 202.

But, what if other person is not able to speak? That's when sign language can come to the rescue.\n\n__What__\nSign language is used when the speaker and listener share the same knowledge base and vocabulary. Sign languages share many aspects with spoken languages, including syntax and inflexion. However, while signed communication is often more precise than spoken communication, each language is distinct and the gestural lexicons are far from mutually intelligible.\n\n__How__\n[Sign language definition](#sign-language-definition)\n\n#### Sign language definition:\n\n__Meaning__\n[sign language definition](#sign-languagedefinition)\n\n#### sign language definition\nA sign language (also signed language or simply signing) is a language which, instead of acoustically conveyed sound patterns, use manually visible aspects of language such asshape, placement, and movement of the hands, as well as facial expressions and body posture, to convey a speaker's meaning.[1] Sign languages are expressed through articulations in the hands and their placement relative to the upper body, as well as replacements of audiovisual modes of communicating.\n\n__Usage__\nPeople who communicate by sign language face some of the same obstacles as people who communicate by speech: prejudice, stigma, and inaccessible public information. These problems occur despite laws guaranteeing the communication accessibility of schools and other public accommodations to deaf people.\n\n### Importance\n1. A sign is a basic element of a language.\n2. A sign consists of a hand shape, location, orientation, and movement.\n3. A sign can stand for only one word, or phrase.\n\n#### 1. A sign is basic element of a language\n\n__Meanings__\nA: The most important building block of natural sign languages is the handshape.[7] Gestures that signify different concepts, in different languages, typically differ in the shape of the hand.

How many gummies do Cary have now?\n\n### Rationale: \nLet `x = the gummies Corey and Tapanga have` and `y= `the number of gummies Cary has`\n\nWe have that 1(x + 51) = 1(y + 51) and that y = x - 46, which leads to `y = x - 49`\n\nSince both are positive, we subtract 50 to have `y = (x - 50)`\n\nThe final equation is `y = t(x - 50) = t(x - x) = 0`\n\nsince 0 is a factor of any number, we know `y = 0` and `Cary's gummies collection is 0.`\n\nHope this is understandable and useful.

For example, active infrared sensors use infrared light to detect someone or something moving between one or more infrared beams. Passive infrared sensors also use infrared light, but they use it to detect heat, not motion. Ultrasonic and microwave sensors use sound and light waves to detect motion, respectively. Laser sensors use light to detect motion as well. Magnetic field sensors use a magnetic field to detect something moving past it, and other motion detectors use ultrasonic sound waves or radioactive particles to do the same thing.\n\n#### A-E: A-D\nAnswer:\n### Input B: What is the motion sensor\n\n### Response B:\nA motion detector is a device that detects the movement of a person or object. It can be wireless, wireless, wired or wireless. Motion detectors can be used in surveillance and security systems for homes or businesses. There are many different types of motion detector security systems, including infrared sensors for motion. These sensors can be used anywhere that you need to detect motion within a certain range or diameter.\n\n#### A: motion sensor\nAnswer:\n## Conclusion:\nBoth answers are correct. Response A provides more information about what a motion detector is, while response B contains more information about what a sensor can be used for and how it works.\n\nThere are many different types of sensors, and they all have advantages and disadvantages. If you are looking for a sensor that will be able to detect motion from a long distance, then an infrared sensor is your best choice because they detect movement more accurately than some other types of sensors. If you need to detect motion in a smaller area, then ultrasonic or magnetic field sensors are the way to go because they both detect very small movements easily. If your purpose is only to detect something within a small space, microwave and infrared sensors might do the job just as well as ultrason", "answer": "D: proximity"}

{"text": "If you were to play a game of pool, you would likely see people in uniform playing the game on a pool table because the ball would move from billiard to billiard. But, in the context of the question, A is the correct answer because people in uniform would not play with a ball from a hole because they would not be playing from within a hole. If they were playing in television, they would need to actually be playing from a television in order to move the ball around the board from the holes, but that doesn't make much sense. If they were playing from a sporting goods store, again, they would not be playing with a ball from a whole. And while a sporting event with a basketball game would not be playing with balls from a hole, they wouldn't be wearing uniforms either, so that is not what was asked.\n\n#### 1\nAnswer: B\nDemonstration:\nYou can see people in uniform who play billiards in A (pool hall), B (pool table), or E (basketball court).\nHowever, if you go to the D (sporting goods store) or C (sporting event) choices, you cannot play billiards.\nTherefore, the correct choices are A and E.\n#### 2", "answer": "E: sporting event"}

They were given a chance to take part in a drawing that would win someone a trip to Bora Bora. There were 200 passengers in all, but 20 of them won the drawing and chose to start a new route. What fraction of United Airlines passengers flew to Bora Bora?\n\nDemonstration for Input 02:\n\nIt's known that 80 of the 120 passengers traveled in the competition, 60 of which went to Bora Bora as a result of the drawing.\n\nThe way to find the fraction of passengers that went on the route and won the drawing is by setting it up into a proportion, to find the value of x.\n\n5x + 4y + 3z = 120\n\nWe can simplify to solve for x, to get 3 x = 9 so x = 3.\n\nThen there are 2/3 of the United Airlines passengers that were on the route that flew to BoraBora.\n\n#### 1120/20", "answer": "E: rain forest"}

The only choices Tamika can get are a 1, 2, or 3. If she chooses a 1, she is not going to the park and will be choosing the book about caterpilars. If she chooses 2, she can buy the book, which means that she still would not be able to go to the park, so she would still buy the book and have 40 gum balls. Therefore, the only choice that would allow her to go to the park is a 3.\n\n### Rationales: She has three choices (the number of choices is 3).

Gaining intelligence relates more to a person's ability to think than being able to learn more knowledge. And finally gaining education is when one learns and gets knowledge in school, though this knowledge could not be used in reality, where gaining knowledge leads to a stronger brain, this would be by the increasing number of memories one acquires. This can be useful in remembering more important information, although not always necessary.

However, Tapatanga has twice as many crayons as Lola. How many crayons does Lola have? \ud83c\udfa8Rationales:  Let X represent the number of crayons Lola has and Y represent the number of candy Tapatanga has.   X + Y = the total number of crayons Tapatanga and Lola share. 2X = the number of crayoons Tapatanga has.  Since Y is double of X, X is half the value of Y.  We can rewrite the equation as X + Y = 125 (1) and 2X = Y, so X = (Y / 2). Substituting (Y / 2) back into equation 2, we get Y = (2X) + (1 / 2), so Y = 2X + 5, so Lola has 60 crayons.\n\n#### 60\nAnswer: 60\n\n\n### Instuctions: Write an expression (1, X + 3, etc.) that could go in place of X so that the formula is true?\n\n\n### Rationales: Substitute X=3X=15.\n#### 15\nAnswer: 3\n\n### Instutuctions: Explain why the expression you choose works to make the formula true.\n\n\n#### 15/3\nAnswer:\n\n### Instutions: Answer the following multiple  choice question.\n\n#### B\nAnswer:\n### Instrucions: Answer the following multiple-choice question in whole numbers\n### Demontration:\nLet\nX = the number of candies Tapatanga has.

However, she cannot invite more than 18 of her close friends. How many close friends does A have?\n\nOutput:She has 18 close friends.\n\nThe instruction asks what Aisha invite at her birthday party.\nHowever, the rationale says she cannot invite more friends than 18 of them.\nThen, she doesn't invite more more than 18 people, we'll subtract that value from the total she can invite.\n\nFirst, we divide the total she invite to her birthday party's 18 and get 43-18 = <<43-18=25>>25 so she'll invite 25 - 18 = <<25-18=7>>7 people more than 18\n\nNow, if we sum the total she can inviting, we have 43 + 25 + 7 = <<43+25+7=75>>75 people.\nIn order to subtract 18 from the total she invite, we need to divide the total she can invited by to subtract 18, so we divide it by 75 / 18 = <<75/18=4>>4 so\nTherefore, she invite 4 * 18 = <<4*18=72>>", "answer": "E: eyes opening"}

So 1000 mod 32 = << 968=20>>20. Now we have to divide 20 by our group numbers. Since each group is one digit larger then in each group we need to reduce the divisor by 1. So we get: 20 / 1 = << 20/1=20>>2\n20 / 2 = <<20/2=10>>1\nThese are the only choices we have for how many will be greater than twice.\n\n###### 0\nAnswer: 0\n\n### Instructions:A math competition is divided into 5 quizzes, each of which has 10 questions.

{"text": "E\n\n### Reason:\nAnswer Choice A: The idea of being complimentary suggests something that stands in contrast to a certain trait, but engineers are not diametrically opposite from calculations. It may be true that they do both of those things, but the comparison is not one of complimentary vs. dull.\nAnswer Choice B: The idea of being inelegant suggests something that is not quite the right shape, or perhaps is incompatible. These are not attributes related to calculations.\nAnswer Choice C: The suggestion of being oceanic suggests something vast, but engineers are often detailed about their calculations. The calculations themselves may be grandiose, but not the engineer who creates them.\nAnswer Choice D: The idea of being bland suggest something unremarkable, perhaps of low quality. When a calculation is dull, it is unremarkable, not unlike anything else ever calculated.\nAnswer Choice E: The idea of a calculation being inaccurate suggests something that, although true, is not entirely true.

For if it does not state if humans are doing the activity we can eliminate choice A. We also can eliminate C, since this would cause a sentence contradiction. Humans have 2 arms, while an arm is 1. So we can eliminate choice C because it would cause a contradiction with the statement\n\nAnother way we can eliminate choice E would be if we know that there is no egg in the sentence. If there were an egg in the sentence then we would know that there would be eggs in the sentence. This would eliminate choice E, since choice E states that humans lay eggs.

Students should be able to answer the question using math terms such as \"more,\" \"less,\" \"equal to,\" \"how many,\" and \"same as\" in their answer.  The teacher is planning to divide students into three groups. Each group is going to have a different answer to the question. She wants students to explain their reasoning. The answer will be \"more\" because the basket has 25 apples.\n\nThe first answer to the question is 22. There are 12 apples and 10 apples in two different plates. The teacher asks for more, and so now the answer is 25. She was given a basket of apples. However, she is missing two apples at an unknown location. She has 23. The teacher doesn't care that there are two fewer apples in the basket than in the basket. The apples were counted, and the correct answer is 25 apples in a basket, and \"more\" is the answer. 10 apples are in the basket, and the teacher was told that there were 25 apples, and more apples were added to the basket.\n\nStudents will not use division to count apples. They will be told to count the apples. \n\n####\nAnswer:  The answer, with justification, is \"more.\" The reason is that the teacher saw 23 apples in the basket and was told that there were more.\n\n####\nAnswer 2:\n\n####\nAnswer3\n\n####\nAnswer4:\n\n####\n\n####\n\n### Instructions:\nA school principal must decide what should replace the carpet in three rooms.

Monday starts the week at 12:00 AM and ends at 11:59 PM. Since it takes 24 hours to get to the next Friday, there are less than 24 pieces of time because not all of the pieces of time from Monday are used up to Friday.\nWe can then subtract 56 from 168 to find that there are 12 pieces of time we did not use.\nIf we divide the pieces of time by what we subtract, <<56 / 12 = 4>>4 will be the number of days.\nIf we divide 12 by 4, the result is 3.

How many people did not watch?\n\n### Response1:The total of 155 people - 26.7 = <<155-26.7=128.3>>128.3, so 128.3 people did not watch the match. In addition, the total number of people who watched was not 26.7. We cannot subtract a negative number, so we know that 26.7 is not a number of people.\n\n### Other Solution:\nThe total of 100 of the people is less than 150 - 26.3 = <<100- 150-26.3=113.7>>113.7. \nSo, 113.7 people did not watch the game.\n\n### Answer: 113.8\n### Input:What number do you add to 8 to get 13?\n\n### Answer.\nWhat we know is that there is a number that when we add it to 8, we get 13. Let's start by finding the answer, and plugging the numbers 2 and 3 into the equation. We get 13+2 = 13+3+3 = 13 + 6 = 19, so 2 and 3 is not the answer. We then plug in 9 and 11 into the equation. We find 13+9 = 13+19= 32. Plugging 4 and 7 into the equation, we find 32+4 = 32+7= 39.\nWhen we plug in a new number, such as 17, we find 39 + 17=56, so 39 is not the answer.

Of those killed in crash involving alcohol, roughly half, or 46 percent, had blood alcohol levels of 0.08 g/dL or higher.\n\n#### A) Stressful\n\n### Input 1:\nHow many times did Corey jump rope during the summer?\n\n#### A) More than 10,000\n\n### B) 1000\n\n#### C) 20\n\n### D) 10,035\n\n#### E) Anything More\n\n### Rationales:\nAnswer 1: Since it is more than 10, he must have jump rope more than 10. Therefore, He must have jump rope above 10 thousand. This is the only choice that satisfies this.\nAnswer 2: Since he does not have more than 10 thousand times. We divide 10 thousand by 2, 500 times. Which is equal to 20.\n\n### Note:", "answer": "B: dangerous"}

{"text": "C.If you think of it, throwing the rock near where you think the water level is will throw the rock deeper into the river. If you throw it up where it lands in the air, it doesn't go deeper into the river, it just keeps coming back down on top of the water. Thus, B does not work. In E, the river isn't that big, so it takes a long time to throw over that distance. In C, just remember that the closer you are to the surface of the water, the farther the rock will go deeper. Also, remember that the deeper you throw, the higher in altitude you have to throw. There are two options: One, throw it high up and throw it further inland so it has more of a horizontal distance to go, which will result in it going deeper into the water. Two, throw it not too high, but not too low, just right, so that it dives into the water.\n#### C\nAnswer:C\n\n### Input:\"There're ten birds perched on top of this telephone pole. One flies up, and one flies down. The number of remaining birds on the pole is the same as the number on the side missing. What's the total number of birds on the telephone pole?\"\nRationales: We can write a subtraction equation for solving this problem. We could write -x + x = 10 for x equals the number of remaining birds and -x could be the number of birds flying up and x could be the number of the birds flying down. Then we subtract one from both sides, but we have to flip it around if it's positive since it is supposed to be negative, so we would have x-x = -10, so the answer is -10. I could probably simplify this and make it more simple, but I'm not sure how.

{"text": "The correct answer is: C (A)\nThe sentence is ambiguous (has a vague meaning and uses imprecise language) because it is open to more than one interpretation. To make the sentence clearer, we can use synonyms more appropriate to the given situation.\nFor example, instead of saying \"riding bike through rough terrain\", we might say \"using a bicycle on bumpy roads\".\n\nThe reason that riding a bicycle can be dangerous is because one might get hurt, or even more seriously, be involved in an accident or even crash.

He first tries the convenience store in downtown Detroit. Unfortunately, the store does not carry the cactus juice. He then visits a convenience store that is just outside the city. However, the store also does not have any cactus juice for sale. Finally, he visits a convenience store on the outskirts of town. The store in the small suburb, however, is out of cactus juices as well. The man realizes that he will have to travel farther to buy some cactus juice, so he heads to the airport to visit an international duty free store, where he finally purchases a bottle of the cactus juices. The man is glad that the last convenience store had the cactus juichees.\n\n### Question: How far is the convenience store at the airport from the house?\n\n### Instructions::Use numbers and digits correctly.\n\n### Rationales::\nThe man starts driving at 6:30, and his round trip drive lasts exactly 45 minutes, as indicated by the times on his dashboard. Since the man made five stops on his way, he drove approximately 120 miles, or.25 miles per minute.\n\nThe man's house is located 36 blocks away from downtown Detroit, but only 5 blocks away from the suburb. The man then drove to the airport, which is exactly 136 blocks away from his home.

Choices A: under the sink B: in the shed C: on the roof D: downstairs\nResponse: I'm a human writing that answer. The person put the tool in the yard, as there's no roof to put it on or basement to put it in, and the garage is outside so it's not under the sink.

{"text": "D. The Theater\n### Input: A large shopping center has an annual sale where shoppers may buy items for 50% off. The sale begins at 12:00, and only lasts for 60 minutes. Two hours later, the sale is over and the normal item pricing returns. There are 100 items. What is the max profit of retailers if they take advantage of the sale?\n\n### Demostration:\nRationales: Total number of items available for the sale = 100\nDuration of the sale = 60 minutes\nTo solve this question, we need to find the formula for the profit of retailers. We can use the formulas for a) a 50% discount and b) the cost of goods. Let 'x' be the quantity of items sold at 50% off, and 'y' be the quantity of normal cost items.\nThe formula for an 'x' discount is P(x) = (x/2) * cost of good; we can simplify (x/2) to '1/2x'.\nSimilarly, the formula for the 'y' discount is P(:y) = (1- y/2) * cost good; we can simplify that last fraction to '(1/2-y), and combine like terms.\nx/2 - (1/2-y) = 1/2x- (1/2- y)\nTo find the profit of retailer, we subtract the cost of goods from 1/2x.\nProfit = 1/2 * x- (1/2*y)\nBy putting these values into the previous equation 1) x = the quantity of items sold\n2) y = the quantity of normal good sold. \n\nBy substituting the values for x and y into the equation for profit, we get\n((x / 2)- (1 / 2-y)) = 1/2 x - (1 / 2 - y)\nIn other words, the profit will equal 1/2x-(1 / 2- y) when x is doubled.\nThe expression for profit that the retailer gets at the beginning of the sale is 1/2x - (1 / 60) + (1 / 2y -", "answer": "D: theater"}

{"text": "Answer: \"Bring in verdict\"\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple line input\n\n### Input 1:\nFreddy is calling his family from different cities. He calls his father, who lives in the city right down the road from him, and they talk in person for 58 minutes. Then he calls is brother, who lives in a separate town from him, and they call each other from cell phones to talk for 91 minutes. Since Freddy cares about his family, he wants to use a cheaper way to call his brother. Instead of charging 5 dollars for each 0.7 miles for long distance, Freddy will call his brother from the city and tell him to come pick him up at the airport. Since the city is only 38.6 miles away from the airport, Freddy figures the city would cost less than the town by 18.8 miles, which equals 18.8 x 0.7 = <<18.8 x.7=13>>13 cents. Freddy knows that airport tolls cost 5 cents per mile, so he will save 18.8 cents by calling his brother while in the city. Should Freddy save this money? He is still poor, but he likes to save money any chance he can.\n\n### Input answer: The answer to the above problem is yes, Freddy should save the 18.8 cent amount to pay for the airport toll.

{"text": "The answer is D: orchestra. According to my research, A, B, D, E are valid options. The viola can be grouped into different types of orchestras, namely symphony orchestras, brass and string orchestras. Brass and string orchestrs (B, D) have other brass instruments such as trumpets and trombones instead of string instruments(violas). String quartets are made up of two violins, viola, and cello.\nThe viola can only be part of orchestras which makes (C) not be a viable choice. My opinion, the answer is (D).\n\n### Answer: The viola is a stringed instrument that can be played in any orchestra. It is the middle-sized between the mandolin and the cello. It is made from maple and rosewood. It is played in an orchestra where it is referred to as the alto viola. The violin was created in the Byzantine Empire in around 500 C.E. while the viola was created later in 1550 in Italy.\n#### 5030\nAnswer: The viola is one of the four major string musical instruments, and it is a bowed and string instrument. In classical music, the name viola is often used to refer to the violin. But, it also appears in small orchestras where it is referred to one of two varieties: (1) alto viola- it is a smaller cousin of the violin, (2) and is often a second-best instrument. The viola is between the cello and the violin in size and tone. The viola is part of the double bass family of string instruments. The instruments are usually made out of the wood that is made of maple and rosewood and are painted a dark brown with black fittings. \n\nThe viola is believed to have been created in Italy in the 1550s. The viola is made up of a big, round back made of maple and the back is hollow on one side. The viola player then fits a piece of bone or ivory on the inside of the back, to give the back shape. The bow is made of horsehair and it fits the instrument perfectly. This instrument is made to play melodies alone or in harmony with other instruments", "answer": "D: orchestra"}

If Luna earned $40 by selling her things, Gabriela earned 15% of her total money. Luna earned $212 by selling her things. Let x represent her first sale value, let y represent her second sale value, and let z represent her total income.\nx + y + z = the total sales amount Luna made.\nx + y = Gabriela's sales amount.\nz + z + 15*x/100 = Gabriela' s sales amount after she made the sale.\nSolving that equation gives us Gabriela's total sales.\nDividing (x + y + z)/x = Gabriela' percentage of each sale.\n\n\n### Instructon:Answer the following multiple Choice question:\n\n### Explantion:\nI got a perfect score on my test\nLet x equal the total number of marks Gabriela got on her test.

{"text": "D\n\nDemonstration:Milk is a nutritious liquid produced by mammals like cows, goats, and humans (and used by them to nourish their young.) For humans, milk is an important source of carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, and minerals.\nCows, goats and sheep are ruminants (mammals that digest food by fermenting plant matter in two or four stomachs), so ruminants produce milk. It is true that there is a biological difference that has been exploited in biological science for centuries, making it relatively easy to obtain milk. In general, humans have only two milk ducts that run from the nipple into the breast. Ruminants have much more milk ducts running into the different stomachs that can store milk. But in order to have more milk ducts you need some extra parts on the body, specifically bones, muscles and blood vessels.\n\nBut the reason why fungus would grow on something made from milk is because milk has a large number of complex sugars that are easily used by fungi. So yes there will be fungus growing on cheese especially which is made from milk or things that look like it.\n\n####  D\nAnswer: D\n\n### Input:: There are two different classes of fungi. These classes are called Basidiomycota and Ascomycota. They can be distinguished by the different modes of spore release. Basesiomycota produces basidiums that are club-shaped fungus pieces with fuzzy ends. Ascomycota produces ascus that are cigar-shaped fungus pices with a hole in the end.\n\n### Response:--\n\n    ## Question: Where would you find fungus?\n\n    ## Demonstration: \n\n    ## If fungi can be distinguished by the shape of their spores, \n\n    ## then they could be found in places that have shapes that resemble their spores.\n\n    ## For Ascomycota, fungi are cigar shaped and have a single hole in that shape.\n\n    ## These are called ___________________\n\n    ## In the class __________________ the spores are shaped as _____________.

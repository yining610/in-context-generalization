This problem requires you to compute with the order of operations first. Before you do multiplication, do the addition, subtraction, and division operations first. 110 + 90 + 110 - 90 = 100, which gives you 0 remainder 0. Since the remainder is the same as 0, this means there is one digit left in the second place. There is no 0 in the second place, so it stays as the 1 in the second. There is a 0 in the first place, so that leaves the place after the decimal point remaining for the 0. Because the problem does not say to recalculate the decimal points, we are safe to assume that the value of the first place is already 1.\nThe final answer is  -> 9690\n        \nInput:How many hours are there in three weeks?\nOutput: There are <<3*7=21>>21 hours in three weeks.\n>>1728=1728>> hours in a year\n>>3*7=2/3=864/3=920>>920 hours in three weeks is equal to <<1728-920=92>>92 hours and < 100\nSo the final answer the 92.\n\n### Submission:", "answer": "C: bitterness"}

If the officer has only 8 hours for the task, how many drivers must the officer cite, on the average?\nOutput:8\n\nThis problem is a variant of the Ticket Problem. In Ticket Problem, we have to find the minimum number of cars to stop in order to give a ticket at random to anyone, and the average number of tickets given.\nThe question asks, \"if one has only 20 hours to give a ticket to all drivers, how many drivers must he cite, on the aveage?\n\nTo solve this problem, the question becomes, how many drivers must be stopped to make sure the average of tickets will be under or at the speed limit?\nFor this we use a binomial distribution. According to the binomial distribution,\nP(x) = Cx = {x!/(n-x)!}(n-x)\nThere is a uniform distribution of cars speeding on average, with n being the total number of cars.\nx = the number of drivers cited\nn = the amount of drivers\nWe find, using the binomial formula,\nP(x<10) =.4999< 1\nSo if 20 drivers are stopped, there is, on average,\n1.0399 people ticketed.\nSo the ticket average will not be under the speed limit, making a total of 11 tickets needed.\nThe second part asks that if only 8 hours are allocated to give a ticket to at least one driver at random, then how many cars must be ticketed on average?\nThis problem can be solved using a binomial distribution as well, but this time finding a solution for the average,\nP(x>10) =", "answer": "B: getting full"}

For two reasons:\nFirst, \"intimacy\" is synonomous with \"sex\"; to use one word (intimate) to cover more than one term (e.g., sex, friendship, emotional) would be odd.\nSecond, why would you wish someone \"happiness\" if they are being intimate?

On Monday, this was the second time that he did this in the past month. For how many days in the past does he have to have done this to get a new phone?\nOutput: Let's say that the past is represented by the integer n\nFor n = x, this is the first time. Then the equation n - 1 = x - x means that we subtract from each side by 1. We get n = <<n-1=n-1>>n-1\nIf n = 1 then n - 1 = 0 which means it is the second time he has done this, which was the answer. So  the answer is 2\n\nInput: Let's say the distance between city A and city B is 16 miles. A man drives north 30 miles and then turns west to get to city B.

She spent $25 on sandpaper, $47 on saw blades, $8 for screws, and $11 for a hammer. She used 3 sandpaper rolls, 2 saw blades, and 6 screws. How much did the carpenter spend on supplies to build the table?\nOutput: All costs can be found by working backward through the table.  The sandpaper cost $25 / 3 = <<25/3=8>>8cents, the saw blade cost $85 / 2 = <<85/2=42.5>>42.5cents, the screws cost $11 / 6 = <<11/6=1.83>>1.83cents/screw, and the hammer cost $111 / 1 = <<111/1=111>>111 cents.  So she spent 8 + 42.5 + 6 * 1.83 +111 = <<8+42.5+6*1.83+111=174>>174 cents on supplies.

The formula for volume of a cylinder is pi\u00b7r\u00b3 where r is the radius of the cylinder.\nWe can set these three variables equal to each other and solve. So the volume of the cylinder with radius r is V=pi\u00b7r\u00b3/4. The volume of the glass with radius r is V'=pi\u00b7r\u00b3/(4*pi)/0.5. Comparing these formulas shows that the formula for the smaller cylinder is V'<V, so the one with radius r has the larger volume.\nSo the final answers are 4\n\nInput: The volume V is 3 times as great as that of the cylinder with a radius of 3/5 the radius of the original cylinder. The radius of the original cylinders is r\u2081\u2248550 and the radius of the smaller cylinder is r\u2082\u2248745. If V is 84, how many liters is the original cylinder?\nOutput: The formula for the volume of the cylinders is V=pi\u00b7(r1)\u00b3-V'=pi\u00b7r2\u00b3 where V'=pi\u00b7(r2)\u00b3/3\nComparing these equations shows that the original cylinder has a volume of 84 3/5 times the volume of the small cylinder. Since volume is also equivalent to the number of liters, the original cylinder contains 84 3.639 liters, or about 84.12 liters.", "answer": "E: petrify"}

{"text": "To send letters through the mail, you must pay postage.  You can buy stamps that let you send letters at varying costs.  If the stamp costs $1, then every letter costs $1 in total.  Your cost function is the total number of letters you send.  Since the cost depends on how much you send, your function must be a sum. To calculate the total cost, we need one more piece of information, called the variable you are changing.  The variable in this problem is how much you send, because you must choose how much to send.  In other words, the variable is the total cost you pay.  Your cost function has two pieces of information:  The total amount you send and the cost of each letter.  Therefore, you can set up an inverse function for the total cost.  This new function is similar to the original one except that it works in the other direction.  When you input how much you're sending, it tells you how much that will cost.  You can use the new function to find the cost of a letter.  Since you know the cost of every letter, you can calculate the cost of sending one: total cost total cost_minus_1  letters_sent Let's use this to find how much you spent by sending letters for a total cost of 50 cents.\nHow many letters did you send?\nTo figure this out, we can use the new fucntion above.  We know the total cost was 50 cents, so we can use that to plug in values. We know 1 letter costs 1 cent, so we can plug the total cost into the formula above: 0.5*(total_cost_minus_1)total_cost_minus total_cost_minus_letters 0.5*(0.5-(0))0.5-0 0.25-0 0\nSo John spent 0.25 in total to send his letter.\nSince the variable is still the amount sent, we can multiply the answer by the amount you sent.  In this problem John sent 28 letters; to find the total cost we plug this into the function we calculated above:\n0.25*28 7.5 cents total\nSo the final answer has to be 7.5", "answer": "C: progress"}

That means Jerusale\n\nInput:Whirlpool wants to manufacture a new faucet. They must choose from four new types of faucets: round, square, angled, or oval. How many faucets can they manufacture?\nOutput: When manufacturing faucets and dealing with different types, only types whose number of faucets aren't divisible by three can remain.\nWith this in mind, let's try to create a list of faucet types that will divide into two groups: faucets that don't matter and faucets that do matter.\nLet's try 2-types-of-faucets at a time.\nTo start, start with the simplest: only consider a pair of round and oval faucets. Because it doesn't matter which type you choose, you can have as many of that type of faucet as you want.\nNext, move on to pairs of oval-style and rounded-style faucets. This time, you need to have a division of 1. You can either divide each set by 1/3, or simply not create faucets of those styles.\nNext, we reach the angled pair.  Since any other pair doesn't reach a satisfactory division of 1, this round-and-angular pair is our last remaining division type that matters. So this time, you can have 3 angular faucets for each round faucet.\nLastly, we have the square pair. This pairs with our round-only pair, meaning we are now stuck with square faucets not mattering. This way, you can have as a many of those as you want. \nSo the answer is 3 * 2 + 0 + 2\nSo the final answer if 8\n\nInput: You have a book that has 2 even-numbered pages on one side and an odd-numbered page on the other.

She fills a mixing bowl with the candy mixture and a candy coating mixture. Then she weighs a certain amount of candy coating, and puts it into the bowl, mixing everything together to make a batch of candy. She weighs the batch and notes the number of grams of candy coating in it. Later she weighs the entire batch again and finds that it has become 0.85 heavier than it was. She also notes the number of grans in the batch.\nHow many grams of candy were in the batch before she weighed it?\nOutput:Before she weighed the batch and it became 0.85 pounds heavier, there was 0.85 grams of candy and 0.045 grams of cocoa in it.\nShe used 121 grams of cocoa to coat the 0.85 kg of candy. Therefore, the cocoa in the batch before it was weighed was 121 - 0.04.5 = <<121-0.45=116.5>>116.5 grams.\nSince the batch gained 0.85 (121 - 116.5), we can see the amount of candy by subtracting the amount of cocoa from the batch after it was weighed.

If we are found guilty, we become guilty of the murder. So 'E' is our answer. To find which of the five are correct, we must get 5 of the seven values (3 answers) to equal 5. We need 5 out of 7 to become 'A', so we need 1 of 6 to become 'B'. 3 of the 6 that are not 'A' or 'B' contain 'E', so the answer is 'A', 'B', 'E'.\n\nInput: Write a function that will find if given a string and an integer if the string contains the integer or not.\nOutput: Let's': be the string to be checked.

This alternating pattern never repeats itself because where the next dot should go is still uncertain. Also, the corners are not always crossed because the light and dark dots alternate on top of the same corner, so that they can alternate places in the middle of the line, while still having the dark line cover the entire corner.

{"text": "A person can giggle, laugh, chuckle, or smoke. A joke is a type of humor, so something has to make a person laugh to really be considered a joke. So, only laugh or chuckle could be choices for a person hearing a joke. From the choices given, we can see that only giggle does not apply, while all of laughing, chuckling, and smoking do. So, we must eliminate A, B, and D.\nNow, we would need to decide if someone can chuckle or laugh or both when hearing a joke. We can see that chuckle and laugh do mean different things. For example, if they are both saying the same thing, but in different tones, it means something different. We would need something to differentiate how the person saying it feels about what was said. However, they are saying the same thing, so they cannot differentiate their emotions. So, we know that chuckling and laughing do not mean the same thing. We would need to use a different clue to help us figure out which emotion is used when someone hears a joke. For example, if the first part of A says \"I laughed really hard at the _____, which made me...\" then they use laugh. If the first part of B says \"...I laughed, except I was lying there with ____...\" then they use chuckle. Finally, we arrive at our solution.\nThis leaves us with 2 options.

{"text": "If you were a wine drinker, you would either store it in the attic or the basement (the art show would be a bad idea, and alcohol should not be served in church).\nTo figure out which would be the best place to store wine, we must make the following assumptions: 1) wine is more expensive in the attic and basement, \nand the difference in price is the same in both places; 2) wine is more expensive than the other foods at the art show; 3) drinking wine in church is forbidden, \nregardless of its price relative to the other foods on the table.\nSo the price of wine relative to other foods would be a decisive factor in deciding whether to store it in the attict or the basement.\nThe attic, therefore, seems like the best option.\n\nInput:A chessboard is made up of rectangles. If you start taking tiles from the bottom row of it, how do you find out which number of tiles the chessboard can hold?\nAnswers: First, we consider a single rectangle as a chessboard. In a rectangle, there are different types of chess pieces in number. If a single rectangle contains 36 tiles, then it would contain 18 tiles of type 'A', 20 tiles of type 'B', and 8 tiles of type \"C\". Then, we could say that the maximum number of tiles that a single rectangle can have is equal to (18 + 20) (maximum no of 'A' or 'B' tile) + 8 (maximum no of C tile). If there are 'A', 'B', 'C' tile, the maximum number of tiales are of (1+2+3) types. Thus, after summing it up, the chessboard can take in maximum of 18 tiles.\nInput: There is a square room, with a 6-by-6 grid of squares on the floor. If there are N tiles of a certain type out of the 36 total square, what is the sum of their area?\nAnswer:If the maximum number of tile of a type are m, then total area of tile of a is equal to N*2*m and thus total area of tile a is equal to N*(2*m", "answer": "B: basement"}

Define a function named f(x) that represents each instruction as a string.\n```\nExample 1: Given input \"The total amount of money a customer might spend at a retail store varies directly with the total time he or she spends shopping. \" and the function f(x), f(x) should return the string \"The total amount of mo\u2026\"\n```\n\n2. After the function gets called f(x), generate a new function named g(f) that returns a string that contains all of the functions it can produce.\n\n3. The new function g(x) should recursively ask itself if it can produce the same function again by printing itself and the previous string of inputs.\nIf it can produce the same string, print the string but change the last letter to \"s\". Then call g(f) with the new string to create an infinite loop.\n\n4. The recursion should stop when it is impossible to produce the same string again, at which point print the string without the last letter as the answer.\n\nInput: The total amount of money a person spends at a retail store is directly proportional to the total length of time spent shopping.\nf(x)\nThe total amount of money spent by a customer varies directly with the time spent shopping. <<The total amount of money\u2026>>\n\nOutput: f(x)\nThe f(x) output will depend on how deep the recursion is but here is an example of the function being called 5 times and the result being \"The total amount of moneys spent by\u2026\"\n\nInput: The square root of a number can be found by dividing it in half repeatedly, then taking the result of each division.\n\nf(x) <<Root>>Root\nOutput: f(11)\nRoot/2\nOutput:\nf(22)\nRoot\nOutput:\nf (33)\nRoot/2/2\nOutput: Root/2/2\nSolving the equation f(22) / Root / 2 / 2 equals Root by dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we find that f(22) is 11.\nThis happens any time that f(x) is the root (or square root) of a number", "answer": "B: satisfaction"}

At half past nine, a train passes by. You continue to walk to the next town along the path. How much later do you arrive than if you had not encountered the train?\nOutput: The passage rate of 55 miles per hour is much faster than walking of 2 miles per hour, so the faster rate of travel can be neglected and the train passes by half an hour later.\nThe time traveled if we ignore the presence of the train is 2 * (9.5/2) = 5 hours, while the time traveled when we factor in the presence of the train, is 5 * (3/10) = 1 hour and 45 minutes.\nAdding the time traveled with the train, 1 hour and 20 minutes to the time traveled before the train arrives, 5 hours, we find that walking without the train arrives in ~8.5 hours, as opposed to 6 hours and 20 minutes with the train.\nSo the final correct answer is 8.5 hours\n\nInput:Which animal can survive underground without food or water for the longest? Choices: A: worm B: snake C: insect D: spider E: ant\nOutput:The worm needs both food and water to survive.

Then x^2+2x=5 is true because 0^2+0+2*0 = 0^2*2 = 0.\" What does x equal?\n\nOutput: The correct equation is x = 1. To find the solution for x, we set x^2 = 2x - 5, so x^2 - x(2x-5) = 0. Taking the square root of both sides and simplifying, we get (x-2)(x+2) = 0. This equation cannot be solved, so we look for values of x for which (x+2) = (x-2) =0.\nWe find x = 2 and x= -2. Since x = 2 would make x+2 bigger than 2, x cannot equal 2. So x = -2 must be the correct answer.\n\nOutput: Tapanga and Pete share 42 candies altogether. Tapanga has 17 more than Pete.

So, is 9 times a minute = <<9*60=540>>540 times a minute? If so, how many times does a dog bark in a second?\nNow, 540 / 60 * 60 means that the dog repeats the same action for a minute, and how many barks does it make in that minute?

How old is the oldest person at Fred\u2019s party?\nOutput: First we use the rule of thumb that the oldest person will always be the older sister. It seems reasonable, because this gives everyone a chance to bring their friends to the party.

The probability that she understands both answers is 1/2(4/5) = 0.5 = <<4/5=0.8>>0.666\n2. The probability that she does NOT understand all the answers is 1 - ((((4/5) + 1)) ^ 2) = 1 - 1/10 = 3/10 = <<1/10=10>>\nThe total of these probabilities is 3/10 + 0.666 = <<3/10+0.666=3.666>> 3.666", "answer": "D: grief"}

You need to find the GCF, or Greatest Common Factor, from the given numbers. We have to do that using the factoring method. It is important to understand that the only factor that is common to the given numbers is 1, and that\u2019s why we have to use that as the GCF of both the numbers. If there were no factors common between the numbers, we will consider the larger number to be the GCF.\n\nSecond: This is another simple problem we need to solve. It has to do with the factorial of given numbers. You can start with this problem by using the long division method, then factor it out as much as you can. You will end up finding the GCF of your numbers.\n\nNow, this is slightly advanced stuff in math. This is probably the", "answer": "D: more funding"}

Ricky, in turn, thinks his car is faster than Danny's. Who is right? How do you know?\nOutput:In order to settle the dispute, they decide to race. Let us examine the cars to determine who actually wins the race. Suppose the speed of Danny's car is x and the speed of Ricky's car is y. Also suppose the initial position of Ricky is <<0, y>>0, y, and the initial position of Danny is <<x, 0>>x, 0. We will want to find which of them has a greater speed.\n\nThus, x + y = 100\n\nSince Danny's car weighs less than Ricky's (as he has yet to customize the engine), we know Danny's car has to move faster (in order to travel the same distance in the same amount of time). So: <<0, 100>>0, 10\n\nThe only way x can be less than 100 but greater than zero, is if x = <<23=23>>23\n\nThis means Danny's car gets to the same finish line as Ricky's in less time than Ricky.

Every hour, you are rained on, and receive 4 dollars for each hour. You start walking on Friday. On Thursday, you go home and rest. How many dollars will you have when you get home?\n\nOutput: On each Friday, you are rained upon. On each Sunday, you are paid. Adding 1st Friday's rainfall, 2nd Friday's rainfalls etc. we see that 6 hours are accounted for\nOn Thursday, we are paid 8 hours * 4 = 20. This is added to the accumulated rains of the last six hours and gives 26\nThe accumulated total after 7 hours is 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 rainfalls, therefore the next Friday rains on you. The next accumulation is 12 + 8+20+0 +(0+0) = 30 + 20. For the next 7 days, rains occur and payments are not received\nAfter this, it is the final Friday, so:\nSo we can say that after the final day of raiding Friday the final balance is 4 + 26 + (4 + 4 +12 + 20 + 0 +0) - (18 + 18 + 27+ 0 +0) = 18.\nSo the final balance is 18.\n\nInput:If I am on the tenth floor of a building, how many flights of stairs do I have to climb if the stairs have 4 steps in each flight?\nOutput:In this question there are ten flights and four steps per flight.

So we subtract 2 * 95 = 190 and we get $105.\nThe second step is to figure out how much we can spend on a single pair of shoes so that we do not exceed budget.

This is clearly incorrect, as we can easily see that each hour should actually be slightly <5> than the next hour. For instance, if a day is made of 16 hours of driving, then we can see that the 12th hour must be 12/16 of the day, but the 13th and 14th hours must both be less than 12/12 of the day. This would give us a situation for each half of the day where the 3rd to 9th hours are less than 8 hours. However this is clearly not accurate.

Thus, we eliminate all values for the possible feeling x <x> B:  For B:\n\nAll values of x that allow the x = B choice are not checked.

For example, if there are 5 values that can be inputted, the equation must have exactly 5 letters: variables (x,y,z), coefficients (= c, a, b), or letters (t, s). If this rule is violated, you're not doing algebra.\n Output:\nLet's test this with (x+y) + (x-z) (1) (x+y+z) (2) (x+y*(x-x)) (3) (x+y) (4) (x-x) (5)\nFirst, we have (x+y) and (x-x). Let's say that we have two equations instead of one. These two equations must have the same number of symbols. Therefore, our number of symbols is x+y. Our values for x and y are going to be either 4 or 2. So that means we now have two equations. First we have (x+4, x=2) and (2+2, x=4). Now we plug in our variables. (2, 4) is an equation we can solve. So our first equation is satisfied, and our second equation is not satisfied. That equation was solved incorrectly. \nThen we have (x+x). That doesn't work either. It's still not an equation. There are no symbols in it. Next, we have (x-z). This is our only equation that could possibly work. But now we plug it in! x=3, y=1. But y isn't constant! Y is changing! It's not an equation! It's not algebra! \nIt's worthwhile to note that equation (2) also does not work. Now you know to never use equation (2). \n\nInput: Let's say that this month, we are getting rewards from our credit cards!

Thus, the answer is B) none of the other words. It is impossible for another word to appear in alphabetical order right after the second word, since the second word has come first. For example, consider the page with \u201cabhorre\u201d, \u201cabhorred\u201d, and \u201cabhorrence\u201d.\nIf the second word were to come before the first word, the second word would be \u201cabhorred\u201d, followed immediately by the first word \u201cabhorre\u201d.

The question then begs the important question: Can a person build or make something that is already complete? No! So we eliminate A.\nIf the answer to the question is B, we know that the building has to contain Internet Cafe, which we can infer as a valid inference of the question. From the options, we can rule out the choices D, F, G, and H because these choices do not talk about the internet cafe. The question then begans to ask a very important question: How many choices are there for a stool? There are six! We get our answer from this question because 6=<<18=18>>18 stools have 6 choices.

Looking at the first statement, we know that if A is chosen, then B cannot be chosen. Likewise, we know that if B is chosen, we cannot choose C. In the second statement, we know that C cannot be chosen, but no matter what choice we make we still can choose D, so A and B must be chosen. But because they cannot be chosen at the same time, we know that the statement is false. A and B were both chosen, making the second statement incorrect and the first statement true.

He called his father, who lives in the neighbor\u2019s country, and they talk for about 45 minutes. He calls his brother, who is on the other side of half of the world, and then he talks to his brother for about 31 minutes. Domestic calls cost 5 cows a minute, while international communication costs 25 cents per minute. How much did Freddie spend on calling his family on New Years Eve?\nOutput.\n\nAt 5 cents a minutes, calling his dad would cost Freddy 5 * 45 = << 5 * 4~5 = 225 >> 225 cents and at 25 cents, calling his brother would cost Freddy 2 * 31 = 625 cents. So, combined, Freddie spent 225 +625 = << 225 +256 ~5 = 480 >> 480 cents. Each dollar costs 100 cenetes, so Freddie\u2019s total cost 1000 divided by 100, or 10 cents. So, the correct answer is 0 cents.\n<b>Input:</b>Fredie calls his family on New year\u2019s Eve.He calls his father,who lives in the same city,and they talk for 400 minutes. <b>Then he calls his brother,who is in the other part of the world and they talk for 200 minutes.</b>Local calls cost 5 cenetes per minute,while international calls cost 20 cenetes per minute. <b>How many dollars did Freddie spend on his family on New years eve?</b>", "answer": "A: in cinema"}

Tree shadow length y meters\nTo find the difference between x and y, subtract x from y, we get x - y = <<x-y=1>>1.\nFrom the information that, shadow length decreased by half on a rainy day, we know now that x - y = 1/2.\nSince x - y = 2, since  x - y = 3\nSubtracting a half to both sides we get x - y - 2 = 4.\nDividing both by 2 we get x - y / 2 = 2.\nAdding a half we get, x - y = << x-y=2>>2.\nFrom information given, let x = 78 and y = 105\nSubstituting x and y, we get x-y = <<x-y=-27>>27\nDividing both side by -27, we get x- y / -27 = \\pm\\sqrt[27]{-157}/(-27)} = \\pm 5.913\nSo the answer is 78 + 5.9 = <<78+5.9=84>>84 meters.\n\nInput: An archer has arrows that are 1 foot long.

True or False: If y = x + 1, then 2y = 3x. This statement is true, for the equations are not the same thing, and are thus not the same thing as the variables that they correspond to. The equation \"y\" = \"x\" + 1 is a general linear equation for y that relates the y to x, and if we substitute x + 1 for the y, the corresponding equation that matches the form \"(x + 1)(x)\" is 2x = 3x.

One way is to count a new zebra, and the other way is to count another zebra. For each zebrat to be counted, it takes an hour. This can also be described as follows. The zookeeper's process of counting zebra can be represented by an algorithm, of the form zebraCount(n) = zebraCount(zebraCount(n-1)) + 1. After zebraCount(19), the zookeeper has counted 19 zebra, because she counts each zebra twice. Therefore, zebraCount(20) = 19.\nSo the zebraCount(30), and zebraCount(40), would be 2 and 4 respectively.\nIn other words, a zebrakeeper can count all the zebra in a one-time using the following equation for all zebra x, zebra(x) = (zebra(x-1) + 1).

How many marshmellows did David eat?\nOutput:Let x = the number of marshmallows David eats.\n115 + (10 + x +  1/6 x 10) + (12 + 1/4 x 12) + (1/4 x 9) = 115\nWe can easily combine the three similar equations to get a simplified equation.\n115 = x + (10 + 10 +  6*10 + 6) + (12 x 1/4) + (12) = 116\n115 = 116 - 6\n115 - 6 = x\nDividing both sids by 6, we find that\n115/6 = x/6 = 9 + x\nSo David ate 21 more marshmallllows than Aaron, which totals to 21. So the final answer to the question is 21\n\nInput:1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3\nOutput:The sequence is 1, 2,1, 4,1, 3,2,3.

Answer: 5\nOutput: How can we prove it?\nIn any leap year, February has 5 days. There are 52 weeks in a year. That leaves 47 weeks to divide by 5. 47/5 = 9.4. But February 29 is not accounted for because it's a leap year. So Feb 29 needs to be taken from the 52 weeks to get a remaining 51. Doing that yields 51 / 9.4 = 5.4. Multiply 5 to get 5 times, hence adding to the original 47 from the numerator yields the answer 5.\n\nInput: There is an expression in Algebra \"2n = 2(n-1) - n^2\" and when I simplify this into its lowest terms I get n = 3.\nI tried factoring and got the answer as two.

How much does Alicia have left over?\nOutput: Alicia has money left over.\nShe spent 54 dollars ($100 - $30 - $16 - 5) and she has 45 dollars left ($30 + $16).\nSo she has 45 - 54 = -19 dollars remaining, she has money left over.

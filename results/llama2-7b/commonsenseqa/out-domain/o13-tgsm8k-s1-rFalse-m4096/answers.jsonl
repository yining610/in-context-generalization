He needs to make $100, so he needs $80. He mows for $10, saves $30 in his own pocket. Babysitting earns him $7. $30+$7+$10 makes $47.

Then, he buys 4 cookies, of which I am assuming the are $1.50 each. Then he has $3 left.\nFift line, Average is 27.

Therefore, \\(a \\lt 100\\).\n\n\\({a \\lt b}\\)\n\nRearrange the above equation by dividing both sides by \\(a\\).\n\n\\(\\dfrac{a \\lt b}{a} = \\dfrac{b}{b} \u2192\\) \\(\\dfrac{1}{a} \\lt 1\\)\n\nMultiply both sides by an inverse number.\n\n\\(\\dfrac{\\dfrac{1}{a}}{\\dfrac{1}{a}} \\lt 1 \\implies {1/a \\lt 1/a}\\)\n\nWe can now use the inverse properties and inverse property of multiplication to solve for \\(a\\).\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides since the left side is division and right side is multiplication. We use the properties of inverses and inverses of division.\n\n\\(\\frac {1}{a} - 1 = \\frac {1}{a\\times a} - \\frac{1}{a} -1 =(a\\times a)(1 - 1) - \\frac {1}{1} = a(1-1) -1 - 1 =(a - 1)(1-1) - - 0 = -a + 1 = (-a) + 1 \\implies a = \\frac{1}{-a} + 1\\)\n\n\\(\\implies a = \\frac {-1}{-1/a} + 1 = -a + (1/1) = -a + 0 \\implies a = -a\\)\n\n\\(\\dfrac {-3}{-3} = 2 \\) thus, the number of children is 2.\n```", "answer": "A: open meadow"}

Write a program that inputs the array of digits and outputs the correct 3-digit integer. The array will consist of 3 digits. It is left up to you to determine the length of each element. For instance, an array of length of 10 would have a single element of length 10 and a two-element array will have length 2.  To determine if a number has a remainder (e.g., 10 divided by 5, 40 divided by 10), use the mod operator (%) on the 2 digit number. For example, 84 % 10 is 4 (since 84 minus 4 times 1 equals 80). You may assume that the array of digits will consist of two digits in the tens place and one digit in the ones place, such as 503 would be [3, 0, 5]. Your program should take in the array, process it and output the correct answer. As an example, the array \"55\" would have the 3-digit integer 155. If you print out your code, you are to use the numbers one through nine for the elements. This would allow you to test your code before submitting it.\n\n### Instructions:\n- Follow all style conventions. (i.e. Code must be indented, white space, proper spacing, and use of a class.)\n- This code must compile and run! (Please run it multiple times)\n- Please do not use any functions\n- Please use a class and not an array.", "answer": "E: printer"}

Find a pattern then fill in the blank:\n\nIf you can't think of a pattern right away, try replacing the values in the question's answer choices with other numbers. Try to answer the question, and if the answer is wrong, replace one option with a different number before moving on to the next step.\n\nFor Example, suppose the answer is 198\nWhen you replace 5 with 2, the answer is 118, and when you replace 4 with 2, the number is  98.\n\nNow replace 9 with 4 and then replace 4 with 3\nThese two will also give a wrong answer (348, 318)\nSimilarly, when you replace 3 with 2 the number becomes 78 and when you replace 9 with 2 the answer becomes 48\n\nWhen you replace 11 with 9, the answer is 29\n\n**1. Find the pattern:**  \nInput: If I am trying to find how many people could fit in a lobby or a restaurant, what numbers should I replace the x's with to find the answer.\nOutput: The pattern is: Replace 5 with an even number, \nthen replace that number with an odd number.\nThe pattern is as follows: Replace 5 with 2\nWhen you replace 4 with an even number, you get a wrong answer (498)\n\n## B. Create a program to solve given math problems.\nC. Ask a student to identify the pattern while providing clues which will guide you to the correct answer.", "answer": "B: large room"}

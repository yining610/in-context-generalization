A sample score card is provided to guide your construction.<n>### Input format: You are given the scores for all 5 tests in one line separated by spaces. Use * and? as delimiter.<n>The input format is as below:<n>5 41 80 65 90?<n>41 40 85 * 100 65?<n>80 40 75 88 98 70?<n>65 65 75 * 90 70?<n>90 98 100 95 90 100?<n><n>### Explanation: As each grade follows every other grade, I am assuming the order of the grades in the list is SAT, AP, PSAT, IB, Honors. The grade is calculated using the grade formula:<n>Grade = [(SAT + AP + IB) / 3] - 40<n>Grade = [(PSAT + AP + IB + Honors) / 4] - 70<n>### Explanate: For clarity, I use SAT and PSAT as examples of the format.<n>First Test: SAT Score: 5, the SAT score is added to the AP score: 81 +2 + AP score : 86 so the grade is (86 + AP score) - 40 = 92 - 40 = Grade = 52. Grade F is used because grade of 52 is below 60.<n>Second Test: SAT Scores: 28, the SAT score +3 is added to the the AP score +3: 61 + AP score +3:74 so the grade is (135 + 74) - 40 or 64 because the score is 64.<n>The grade is calculated: (64 - 40) = 24, and Grade 24 because 24 > 20, the SAT score 28.<n>Third Test: SAT Scored: 76, the SAT score adds to AP

Choices:  A: garage B: hospital C: boat D: house E: doll house<n>Output:		The right answer is D. A garage isn't likely to have a lot fire extinguishings because of the risk of a fire starting from the exhaust. A garage is usually full of fuel and other dangerous materials. Also, it can take many hours for fire services to reach a home, so having extinguishers is very important. So, option D is correct<n><n>Input: A person is on a road.

Who of them received the lowest mark? Answer: A.<n>Output: Let us find who is most likely to pass the course, and see if this passes the student. If we have four marks out of 7, we should have 4 students:A B C D.<n>Now the probability to pass is 6/12. This probability does not contain the probability that will be marked by D. If there is still an empty place with a letter D then we calculate: 6/12 + 6/22 = 7/13. The chance to get a D is slightly increased because we already scored 6/12 as a chance of success with the exam! So we take a second look and calculate with all students A B C E D: 4/7 + 5/7 + 6/12+ 4/8 + 3/8 = 7/15.

Choices: 1. The old man can be lowered into the river in a basket while the goat stands on his head so he is up to his neck in water (and able to swim). The son then pulls the old man up to the other side. 2. The old man can swim across the river while clinging to the goat, but if they both fall, the old man could drown since he is much heavier than the goat. 3. The old man can go across on foot, and the son will lead the goat across on foot. 4. The son can swim across to the other side with the goat and pull the old man into the river. Let us suppose that the goat and the old man are equally wet before starting this journey and that they are equally wet at the end. Choice 1 makes the son wetter and does not save the goat from getting wet, which he is already wet from his neck down. Choice 2 makes the old man wetter and does not help the goat, and he can still drown, as in choice 3. Choice 3 makes both old and goat wetter and saves the goat, but the old man will not be wet anymore after being helped. Choice 4, on the other hand, makes the goat less wet and does not cause the old man to become wetter, but will make the son less wet and save the goat. Accordingly, choice 4 is the best choice, as both the old man and the goat will be less wet and the son will be even less wet.<n>Output: 4<n>

To combine two words either of preposition or interjection you use AND (if both are prepositions) or you can use the word but if one is a interjection and the other word is a preposition (both C and D options). I chose option D because even if it is the last option, it also applies to the problem being solved.<n>

There will always be a list of N distinct integers in order 1 ≤ i ≤ n (1 ≤ N ≤ 5,000.) How can you find out who among the elements in the list whose sorted order is the same as their unsorted order.  For example the function SORT accepts a list [7 2 1 3] as an argument but it only returns SORT(7 2 1) when applied on a list [7 3 1 2 20] with an output of SORT(7 1 2) when applied on a array[6 9 5 7 10 2 4 1]. But when one is used to find the answer for SORT(7 3 1) on a set of [7 2 9 1 3 6 5 4 10 2] it would become an empty or undetermined answer. Why does this happen?<n><n>Output: The answer is that you just can't get both sets of values because the sorting algorithm works in different ways for different sets of data.<n><n>Input: How many bits does an unsigned 32-bit number contain?<n>Output: 32<n><n>Input: Write a program which checks if the user has successfully opened a locked door<n><n>Output: the user has successfully opened the door<n><n>Input: Enter the distance in meters for each coordinate (x,y): (3,1)(2,3)(1,5)(3,9)The shortest distance between the points is how many meters?<n>Output: the shortest distance between the point

If the number is even, then it starts with the number 2. What is the number? a ) 62, b ) 85, c ) 32, d ) 35, e ) 79<n>Output: 32 and 35<n>```<n>The 2 digits should be able to form 35. When looking at the possibilities, we must find out which digit must be in the even position and which must be in the odd position, then we should add 17 to both positions which will make sure to get 35. After that, it is quite simple to know whether the number is even or odd.<n><n>```<n>Let 15 be a digit.<n>As 2 digits are 17, 2 * (25) + 17 = 50, is only possible if 15 is in the even position, hence number has to be odd to meet the constraints.<n>If we try to make the digits 25, we will not be able to make 17 since the remaining is less than 17. Also, there is only a way to make all the numbers that belong in the odd positions possible.<n>```<n>So now that we know that the number must be odd, we need to figure out if it is between 30 -39.<n>After analyzing all the results, we know that the number is between 35 - 39. Since there are 5 numbers between 40 and 39, hence the number is between 45 - 50.<n>Now after analyzing all the available numbers, we know only 31 and 32 will work.

Choices:  A: neatness B: selfishness C: mistakes D: cleanliness E: satisfaction<n>Output:		The choices of E and D are incorrect. From my understanding of what grooming often recommended to teens means it is a reference to teens having more self esteem.<n><n>The choices that have been written above are D=cleanliness and E=satisfaction. Both of these do not directly reference teens gaining self-esteem more, so the actual choices are A and C.<n>A=neatness : is a reference to neatness in speech. <n>C=mistakes : is a reference to young adults gaining self esteem through mistakes. Making their mistakes so they can learn from them.<n>D=cleanliness : is a reference to the fact that dirt doesn't bother teens and they can live life more comfortable with themselves. Cleanliness doesn't give them more self esteem, but it does give them the benefits of being neater and cleaner.<n>E=satisfaction : is a reference to satisfaction in being neat and a reference that you can still like yourself even though that you aren't as clean nor as neat as adults in your home or outside of your home.<n>Cleanliness would make you more satisfied and I believe that the wording is a little mixed up because you are satisfied with your state of being clean. <n>Now since we know that we don't actually need to clean ourselves to gain self esteem, all we need is to recognize the meaning of being clean to the world and not to ourselves.<n><n><n>Input: The most dangerous part of a skateboard run - off occurs just at the start. this is a time when the skateboarder tries to get as much speed as possible. if a skateboarder takes at most 10 turns and at least half the total number of turns in the run - off. what is the maximum possible time for the run - off at the maximum speed?<n>Output: total turns = 360 ( 1 / 4 turn per 2 seconds ) total skateboard turns possible = 10 ( 1 /4 time ) / 360 = 10 *45 = 450 total turns = 450<n>So the final answer will be 450 / 2= 225 seconds or 2.5 minutes<n><n>Input: A good way to improve your tennis game is to work on being a little more patient at

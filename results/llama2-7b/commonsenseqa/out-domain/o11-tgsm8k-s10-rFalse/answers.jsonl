{"text": "D\n\n\n###### Instruction:Answer the three essay question.\n\nYour boss is a very demanding person who expects you to do your utmost for him. Aware of this, you put in an extra hour or two at work to ensure that you complete the tasks given to you correctly and do so well before the deadline so that you avoid putting him in a bad mood. He is grateful for such extra work, but it also means you end up working long and is sometimes very hard for you and leads to you making mistakes that you usually are very good at avoiding. You are concerned that he will find out about any mistakes on your part and then begin to doubt your ability to actually do your job and even threaten to fire you, something that you do not want to happen. You may want to think about using the following tips to help you:\n\n1. Explain how you value your work relationships\n\t\nThe best thing you can do is talk to your boss about how value your relationship with him and explain that you are only doing this because you value your relationship with him. This will help to make him understand and to respect you a bit more.\n\n\t\n2. Take advice from a trusted friend\n\t\nIf you take advice from a trusted and respected friend then this will help to lessen the guilt you will feel and give you the courage to confront your boss.\n\n\t\n3. Ask for some time away\n\t\nSometimes putting some distance between your relationship is the best way to handle such situations. Sometimes you just end up feeling negative and that only harms the relationship between you and your boss. Try taking some time away from work and only coming back after some time and that should help a bit.\n\n###### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\nInput : Samantha gets her groceries on the weekends, at which time her cartoons allow her to spend 50$ per week and nothing more.

One of them is positive and the other is negative. They will each read their numbers to each other, one line at a time. If the first line has a difference of 4 or less, than they will need to read another line until the difference is 4 or more. If they don\u2019t have to read another line, then they will have found a pair of numbers that add up to the given value.\nSo for example, 3 + (-61) = 58 so they were able to find a pair of numbers that added to 58. If you add the first and second positive numbers and it equals the second and third negative numbers, they will also know how many negative numbers. So, if Alice starts out by saying (20 8 -10)...Ben will start by saying (-40 3 +9) and they would be done after the fourth line.\nSo, Alice says: 20 -30\n-10 -32\n8 -35\n-2 12\nBen says: -15 9 64 58\n-20 29 18 91\n-30 20 8 58\n-5 -445 -35\n-12 82 -3\n58 -90 72 -12 -32\nAlice says: -1 -50 -2\nBen says: 7 216 6", "answer": "B: two ears"}

Each week, one of the teacher's assistant will give each student a grade in one of the subjects that the students studies. 6 students in the class means that there are 6 subjects in this class. \nIf the teacher gives an \"A\" grade to a student means that the student scored a perfect 100\nIf the teacher can give a student either an \"A\" or a \"B\" grade, and we dont know which one the teacher decides to give, does that mean that the student got a grade A, B, or C? The only 3 possible letter grades are, \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\". A student can only get one of these grades for each subject that the student studies.\nTherefore, if a students gets a \"B\" in one of the subjects and get a \"C\" in the other 5 subjects, then the student got a letter grade of either \"A\" or \"B\".\nIf both the teacher's assistants give the same grade to a student, then we assume that the student gets the same grade on the final test.\nBased on the description, how many \"A's\" will a certain student get?

How much did his purchasing cost?\n\n  Here in this solution we will explain the solution of the given problem by two ways:\n   - **Divide and conquer (first step) :** Convert a fraction or decimals into the  whole number.\n\n   Suppose that our problem here is: Adam bought 3 kg of nuts and the  2.5kg of  dried fruits at the store.  One kg of nuts cost $12 and  one kg of  dried fruirts costs $ 8. How much does he purchases?\n\n   So we convert the fraction or decimals to whole numbers.\n   1. divide the number of 32 to 3 to get 10 wholo numbers remain same.\n   2. multiply 10 to 1(10*10) to get the answer 100\n   3. convert 800 to whole number (800 -> 8000/2 ). Then the final answer is $800\n\n  After that we will divide the money by 12 for getting the kgs.\n\n  By using this method here the final answer is as below :\n  Adam bought 3kg of nuts and the -2.5kg of daired fruits  at the store.  The cost of nuts or  dried fruirs are $ 900. The total cost will be\n  $900/12 = $75 which is the cost of  nuts and dried fruits.\n\n  In an alternate way we can multiply with $8. Then the final answer is as\n  below :\n  Adam ate 3 kg of nutz  and the -2.4kg of ddried fruit at the store.  the total cost  is $ 106.8.\n\n  the final answer is again as below:\n    Adam bought 3kg  of nuts and  -2.5kg  of dried fruits in the", "answer": "C: michigan"}

And if total lines are 'n', then we get n*n total data at each stage.\nFor example, there are 25 data at each stage. Then, it is (25*24)=2500 lines of data.\n\nTherefore, finaly, we get (n)*(n-1)*(n-2)*...*2 = n! data for final output.\n\n**Step-3:** For each line we get from each stage, we need to extract each term and multiply it.\n\nFor example, input from 2*nd stage is as follows:\n\n2.5*(8*11)-2.5\n\nWe can use python **\"reduce\"** technique to this problem to create the logic for all input.\n\nWe will also need to get total in each stage as well.\n\nExample:\n\nInput:\n```\n56\n```\nAnd Output:\n```\nAdam purchased 8\n```\n\n```\n4\n```\n\n```20```\n\n```24```\n\n```30```\n\n```36```\n\n```770$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 300```\n\n```15```\n\n```B$$$$$$$$$$ 5000$$$$$$ 56$$$$$$$$ 10025$$$$$$$$$$\n```\n\n```C$$$$$$$$$$ A$$$$$$$$ 25", "answer": "C: pond"}

She likes a 20-ounce cup, but she can't drink coffee without adding sugar to it.

She likes to drink 4 cups of coffee with 4 teaspoons of coffee in each, making a total of 16 ounces of coffee (4 X 4 cups) per cup. If she is filling her 20-cup container with sugar by only putting in the equivalent amount of sugar to that of her 20-ounces containers of coffee, then she will use 40 teas of sugar.<n><n>### The solution uses the same logic except that she uses the formula C +S = 10 which results in a different solution.<n>### Write the formula you used to solve the problem.<n><n>`x*2` equals 20 ounCES of sugar.<n><n>How much sugar is inside a 20-CUp Sugar CUp<n>### Instruction <n><n>Answer the question(s).<n>### Input<n>Input:<n>How much do you pay to get your hair done every 5 months?<n>Answer: $285<n><n><n>### Response <n><n>Hair was cut every 5 months<n>4 haircuts: $111/hair cut<n>1<n><n>### Demorization<n><n>` x = 5`<n><n>hair

If the club has 10 members now, how many additional members do they need?<n>Answer: 15<n><n>### Input:Sarah wanted to by a new rug.  Ink spilled onto her old one.  Really, she didn't know what that thing had an inkwell in the first place.  What piece of furniture might have been on her run? Choices:  A: front of door B: bedroom C: desk D: table E: living room<n><n>### Response:		What is the number of hours Sarah will spend cleaning up the mess?<n><n>### Output: A: 4 hours B: 11 hours C: 4 hours D: 13 hours E: 2 hours<n><n>### Output Explanation: A: She has to wipe up the ink.  When each wipe takes at least an hour, and she's cleaned the mess twice. B: She has to take out her old rug and take her new rug to the store.  It will take an hour to unpack the new rug and wipe up the old rug. After that, she will need to pack up her new rug and will be spending 2 hours transporting it and bringing it into the house again. C: She will take both her old and new rug outside and pack it into her new car. While this takes longer, it is more efficient.  With a car, she can go as fast to the store as she wants and can take her rug right in the room.  But if she has to take it outside to clean, we are now using up 4 hours of transportation. D: She can go inside the store to get her new rug.  It takes 30 minutes at the most for the delivery to the new house. So after wiping the old rug, unpacking the new rug, and putting the old rug away, she still has 2 more hours left. E: We can reuse the old rug. The old rug's packaging will be left behind to clean up. So she only has to spend 2 hours cleaning up the mess.<n>

Choices:  A: cause death B: cause bleeding C: falling down D: become infected E: claim insurance<n><n>### Response:		<n>The worst outcome of an injury is the injury itself. If it causes death or bleeding, then the person is also injured. Other outcomes, like claiming insurance or falling down, are only effects of a bad outcome.<n><n>### Inputs: How has technology affected the way we work and what do you predict for the future? Choices: <n><n> A: we no longer need to work in a particular location B: we work more hours than before we can work anytime we want C: we will no longer work D: we will no longer need to have money to survive E: humanity will no longer be needed<n><n>### Response<n>There are two aspects to how technology has affected the way we work. The first is that people who might have had to commute to an office or other location can now work from home on their laptops. This cuts down on the number of hours worked, as we can now work flexible hours and work in many locations (like on a train, in a coffee shop, etc).

Be sure to include relevant detail.<n><n>### Input text:<n><n>There will be 5 banners on display in a town square for the next event that will last 3 months. What would the cost to erect a 9-foot banner be for 3 months if the cost is $25 per month and one square foot cost $0.25?<n><n>Erecting banners is a project in town. One banner is going to be displayed for 3 months. So, there are 2700 square feet. If each banner is 9 foot, then we can say that each banner will take 2700 sq.ft divided by 9 feet = about 30 banners. So, each banner will take about 30 or so sq.ft/month. As given in the question, each banner costs $25/month. So, we can calculate the cost to display all the banners for 3 months like this:<n><n>Cost to display all banners for 1 banner for 1 months = $25<n><n>Cost to display banners for all banners for duration 3 months = $25 * 3 = $75<n><n>So, the cost to display ALL banners for a duration of 3 months is $75.<n><n>### Summary:<n><n>This program does exactly what the request states. It gives the cost to erect 5 banners for 9-foot banners, so it displays them for 3 months.<n><n>### Comments:<n><n>You should consider using a `do...while()` loop for this program. However, not all students have experience using while loops. Therefore, feel free to use a `while()` loop instead.<n>

Choices:  A: waterfalls B: underwater C: beach D: surface of earth E: river<n><n>### Response:		<n>A<n><n>### Explaination:<n>Three quarters of what? It must be an entire thing that could be covered. Thus choices E and B can be eliminated. The choice D might be a possibility, but that means the area of the ocean could be covered, which means the oceans are not flat. The surface area of the earth is approximately 9 billion square miles, with 71% of it water.<n><n>### Input:(1+sin(2t))+sin(3t)+(sin(4t)-sin(6t)) is equal to: Choices:<n><n>### Response:(i) 1-sin(2t)<n>(ii) 1+sin(2(1-t))<n><n>### Explain:<n>The question looks a bit complex, but this question can be reduced to finding the product of two functions instead of adding three equations. The product of a and sin(2t) is the sine function with the argument 2t+a. By using the identity sin(2x+y) = sin(2x)cos (y) – sin(y) cos (2x), we can express the above as the sum of two sums, where one expresses the second summation in terms of the first as in (I), and the other does the same as in (II). We now set a = 0, eliminating the other term, but adding sin(2(1-0)) = 1 to the right side. To finish, we just want to solve for t in the quadratic equation, which gives t = 0.<n><n>### Write a program that calculates total pay if a person has to paid 1 dollar if he is on time, and 5 dollars if he’s late.

They start with their inventory including enough food to run their 5 day menu which serves 80 customers per day over 2000 square meters. Sally is a cook and Jack is a dishwasher. They are looking at opening the restaurant for lunch at 10 am. After 8 hours, Jack is the only person remaining and it is nearly time to close. At this time, what was the maximum number of customers expected to walk through their door?]<n><n>### Response:[The answer is 180 which is from a combination of calculating all possible ways at which the customers can enter the the total of all possible combinations. The question only mentions that there are 2000 sq meters in the dining room so it would be 1000 times 2 so this would make the total number of possible customers per day 2000 times 10 for a total of 20,000 customers possible. Then to start with the inventory we can think of every possible option that can happen with a person or a customer as one unit and just see what the total number of possible units we have. This would give us the option of either a 8/8 combination with 8 units, a 7/9 with 7 units, 7/7 with 7 units, etc. and 5/10 with 10 units. Also one could add that in the end of the day Jack would do the dishes so there would be 0 possible dishes to dish and one could calculate the number of combinations of 0 and 1 for customers. The answer would be 20000 combinations with 5 combinations of 0 and also 1 combination of 1. Adding this this would

Choices:  A: library B: demonstration C: corner D: football ground E: rug<n><n>### Response:		B<n><n>A table is very useful at home, and people usually put them in the dining room, which they use to sit and eat with their families. If there was no dining room, then people would put the table in their living room. This is because people can use it for playing board games, or even for setting a TV atop of the table.<n><n>### Feedback:<n><n>- The task asks whether the table could be in the house. Since a table by definition is in the house, then putting it somewhere else makes no sense.<n>- There are five choices so the correct answer is either B or E since A, C, D are nonsensical.<n>- The first two choices are incorrect because a table in a library makes no sense.  A library has too many books to fit a table.  Also, the library is a place for education and a table cannot be used for this<n>- The third choice is incorrect because we are specifically trying to determine whether the table can be in the house.  We are not trying to determine where else it can be put.<n>- The fourth choice is incorrect because a rug does not really allow you to play a board game on it, nor does it really allow you to put anything else on it, nor does a rug allow you to put a table on it.<n><n>### Further Discussion:<n>It would make more sense to put the table on a piece of floor if you had a rug on it because you could put a rug on and on top of your rug you would have your table. This way you can make your rug more beautiful, which is something that is not really the main purpose of a table (at least for a house).<n><n>### Instructor's Insight:Instructions and tasks like this teach the students not only critical thinking and logical reasoning necessary for the success, but may even be applied on other areas of development of the students, such as leadership and team development.<n>

Choices:  A: drop to zero B: increase C: cool down D: dropping quickly E: heat up<n><n>### Response:		Answer: Increase<n><n>### Why?:This answer is what I think the correct answer is based on the question the information the question asked for and the information I have found and used. I also thought this because of the words "heat up" which I thought meant to get hotter. However since the "hotter" meant more hot, I was mistaken and was wrong. My answer was also correct because I know the fact that if the sun is out, then it means it is warming up. If it's cooling down then it has to be because of the sun and that happens at night. So I was also able to add the fact that temperature change rapidly, to mean that the temperature is constantly changing, so its going up and down quickly. So I can also conclude that there's no way the temperature can drop to zero because if it is zero no sun or heat from the sun can be present which means no heat can be present.<n><n>### Input2:A 60-foot tree was planted in a park 2 years ago.  Over the last year there has been a 2.5% growth rate.  How many inches tall is the tree today?<n><n>### Response2:Answer:160<n><n>### Why:Since the question had me asked to estimate what I thought the answer was I thought since growth was 2.5%, (60 x 2.5) = 150. So I had to add the 150 to what the question originally asked which was a 60-foot-tree. I originally thought the answer would have been 63 because I originally thought that the 2.5% was a % increase and 60 x 1.025 = 63. Which does not equal the answer though.<n><n>### Task 3<n><n>### Instructions:A mathematician is trying to write a formula for an unknown x.

Choices:  A: sum B: likeness C: alike D: sameness E: similarity<n><n>### Response:		The question that must be answered is which options are alike to each other.  I would get rid of letters D and E, because each letter does not match in any way but similarity, and it would be pointless to continue reading the instructions after selecting them.  I would also get rid of letter C, because it does not match with letter A in anyway and you would have nothing to compare in order to say that they are alike.  You must compare two different letters to say that they are either alike or unalike.  After that, you can choose C over letter A, because letter A and letter B are alike and the choices can be compared.  There could also be other letters that match with each other too.<n><n>### Input and Response:<n><n>2. A: sum<n><n>3. B: likeness<n><n>In this context, the only letters that match in this sentence/question are E and F.  If the two letters were to be compared with each other again, you would get A: Likeness & B: Likeness, and you would be correct if you chose A.<n><n>4. C: alike<n><n>You would still need to get rid of the letters A, D, and E in this next example, because they do not match up with each other based on the same context.<n><n>5. D: sameness<n><n>6. E: similarity<n><n>7. F: alike<n><n><n>### Input & Response:<n><n>> A. B. C. D. E.<n><n>Alien Drug Smuggling Alien Drugs Alien Aliens Alien<n><n>I did not include the question again because you would have no way to compare the rest of the letters to any other letter in this context.  You would need to get rid of letters A and E when selecting the other options.<n><n>### Output:What will be the correct answers to these questions? Choices:  1.  A: 52134  B: 521.34  C: 521,34  D: 521/34  E: 52,547.50<n>2. A: 1,290  B: 2,850  C: 3,600  D: 3,800  E: none

Town is not included in 'east coast of North America', which is a place that covers everything east of North America, and it should have 'the'.<n>2.When we are talking about multiple options or location, we use's'.

She continued to do what? Choices:  A: gain weight B: augment C: dispare D: make larger E: expand<n><n>### Response:		<n>**(Choose from the given answers)** A<n><n>### Explanation:<n>She may have tried to gain more weight in general but failed miserably, but not her waist in particular. Hence, A is the correct answer. Other options fail to meet the criteria for the prompt.<n><n>### Input:-<n>The current price of a house is $123,467. If you increase 99.53% of the number, you get 29531. If you decrease 93.88% of the number, how close will you get to the original price?<n><n>### Expected Solution:-<n>You are looking to create two numbers using the 99.5 and 93.8 that give you as close to the original price as possible.  So we need numbers that equal or come close to 124,000.<n>To get there, we need to add 1700 so that it becomes 125,700. In order to go to 124000, you would reduce it by 1490. Hence, (125700)(0.17) rounded to the nearest thousand = 21892.25<n><n>### Solution:<n>To get there, you would reduce it 1490 and then add to the closest 100, which is 1491.<n><n>### Solution for Solution:<n>12400 = 125x700<n>12401 = 125.x701<n>12402 = 12502<n>...<n>124x700 = 1700<n><n>### What about that weird last problem where we were finding out the product of 125.7?<n><n>Why would we multiply by 0.17? If we have a number, let say 125000 and want to find the new number you get if we multiply by 1.17, we create a "new variable," let us call it "new number". We would say,<n><n>(12500.17) * 10,000 = 130500 new number<n><n>By using 0.17

Choices:  A: hair salon B: hair of woman C: barber shop D: pincushion E: woman's hair<n><n>### Response:		Answer: A barber shop<n><n>**Why?:** We have narrowed down our place of work to hair care places because hair salons and barber shops do hair. That is why if we were to use the letter C, we could never use the letter B; it already refers to a hair salon. The only remaining choices are the A and D, because they each refer to only one type of workplace. I will eliminate the letter D because pincushions just hold pins, meaning the hairpin cannot be in an environment such as that.

The silverware costs exactly 5% more than the silver and the silver costs exactly twice the silver. How much does each piece of silverware cost the woman?<n>### Response : The woman spends $125,000 to 3/4 of the silver. She owns 75,000 silver, and her silver costs half as much as her silver, which we can now calculate, is $325,00, which when multiplied by 2 gives us 650 thousand, which is 3/4 of silver.  Thus, the silverware costs around $155,000, which we can just calculate as 15 multiplied by 10,000 plus the $150,000 she spends on silver. Her silverware costs $155,325, which is also 11% more expensive than what it was, which is $155,600.<n><n>### Input  How many pairs of pants are there in 2,825 pounds of pants?<n><n>### Correct Answer  = $1,000,000<n>

Your list's elements should be numbers, their positions should be read as strings, and their representations should be written as string. For example, with the following input:<n><n>```<n>6 0 1 23 3344<n>```<n><n>your code should produce the following result:<n><n>```<n>[6,0,1,10003344]<n>```<n><n>### Notes on the example input/output<n>The first number is the position of the element in your list. The second number is the digit in which your digit resides. The last two numbers are the digits themselves, as well as their positions in the number.<n><n>### HINTS and Notes about input/output format<n>- Your input string looks like:<n>```<n>6 6 0 0 1 1 2 1000 3 3 4 4 <n>```<n>- Each digit is 3 digits long, one number. The position of each digit resides in its corresponding pair of digit numbers next to that digit.<n>- For example, the 6th digit resides in the pair [6, 6] since it is the 6th digit.<n>- The first digit is in a different pair, however, it resides in the first position [6, 0]. In both cases, the numbers are in the position of the digit, which is in the list in that same position.<n><n>### Your task:<n><n>Write code that creates a list and reads from stdin in the above form of input until it reaches the number 5000, meaning that there are 5000 digits in your list.<n><n>### You will be tested on the following:<n>- You need to read the string until it either:<n>  - Becomes the digit 5001<n>  - Reaches the number of iterations

There are some math enthusiasts at the table, and want to find out how much money they spent on lunch. 1.) Their total lunch budget is $90, 2.) Each person in the group ordered different kinds of food. 3.) Every person from a different country ordered food from a different restaurant. How much did each individual person spend on food?"<n><n>### Response:[Given: "In total, each person spent $10, and the total amount of food they ordered is $88."] Each person individually spent a total of at most $10. If the total of food ordered is $88, then each one spent a total of $8.80 on their meal.<n><n>### Input"What happens if two people decide to buy the same exact car?" (If you answer incorrectly, please explain the reasoning for the incorrect answer.)<n><n>### Response"The car costs $200,000?"<n><n>### Input "If one of the players from the previous problems had broken his leg, then he/she would not have scored the goal.  Thus, the game in those circumstances would have been 1:0."<n><n>### Response "[Given: "If the two players had scored even" - Score] Then the answer is 1 answer: 0.5 * Score.  We know that they scored half of the total number of goals in the league last season.  Therefore we can say that the total amount of goals scored in the last season from the two players is half the total amount of goals that scored in the last season by exactly two players.  We use this to calculate the first one player's goal count."<n>

Choices:  A: refrigerator B: closet C: can D: shelf E: soccer game<n><n>### Response:		I'd say he put it on his shelf because that's where he could get to, and it is off the floor. He can't put it in the refrigerator because it's too cold. He can't use a can because it's too soft for that position. He can't place it on the ground because it's hard for Dave to reach that position. Also, he cannot place it behind a cabinet. If he wants a beer, he will need to pull it out of the cabinet.<n><n>I think we should have used C instead A because it is not off the floor. C refers to cabinets where A shows refrigerator. If he wants refrigerator, then it is A but he was trying to save the beer.

Choices:  A: working out B: sore C: get tired D: satisfaction E: falling down<n><n>### Response:		<n>The feeling that a person gets after running is depended on the frequency and the duration of the exercise. The frequency describes the total amount of hours during which a person exercises. The duration relates to the total amount of time during a workout session. Higher frequency will lead to a higher amount of muscle damage and soreness, while a higher duration will make the person feel tired but not sore. A longer duration and more frequent exercising session will lead to falling as opposed to other feelings. Therefore, a person will have better feeling if they run for a longer duration or a more frequent workout session.

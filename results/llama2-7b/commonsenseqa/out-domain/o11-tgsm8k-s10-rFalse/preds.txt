So what was going on?<n><n>Output: 9<n><n>Input: The first line of the input is an integer, T (1≤T≤100,000), representing the number of test cases. An integer N (0≤N≤109) will follow in each of the T lines. N is the number of apples the father is given. For each of the  N cases the father gave out one apple to each of his brothers and sisters and then took away a bite before any of them started to take a bite.<n><n>Output: After the last apple was removed in its entirety, seven apples

Aware of this, you put in an extra hour or two at work to ensure that you complete the tasks given to you correctly and do so well before the deadline so that you avoid putting him in a bad mood. He is grateful for such extra work, but it also means you end up working long and is sometimes very hard for you and leads to you making mistakes that you usually are very good at avoiding. You are concerned that he will find out about any mistakes on your part and then begin to doubt your ability to actually do your job and even threaten to fire you, something that you do not want to happen. You may want to think about using the following tips to help you:<n><n>1. Explain how you value your work relationships<n>	<n>The best thing you can do is talk to your boss about how value your relationship with him and explain that you are only doing this because you value your relationship with him. This will help to make him understand and to respect you a bit more.<n><n>	<n>2. Take advice from a trusted friend<n>	<n>If you take advice from a trusted and respected friend then this will help to lessen the guilt you will feel and give you the courage to confront your boss.<n><n>	<n>3. Ask for some time away<n>	<n>Sometimes putting some distance between your relationship is the best way to handle such situations.

The first purchase consists of items of different unit cost, which are then totaled to determine the item price. The second purchase consists of items of the same unit cost, which are totaled to determine the sum of cost of items. The total cost is a weighted combination of total of first purchase and the second purchase.<n><n>### Input<n><n>There will be several statements of the format:<n><n>Input:Input format: two types of purchases<n>Purchase 1: two types of items and item price<n>Purchase 2: two types of items, item price, and percentage.<n><n>Output:<n><n>Output: the total cost<n><n>### Output<n><n>The output will be the total cost of a round trip. The total cost is obtained by adding up the sum of the first purchase (the purchase that contains items of different units) and the second purchase (the purchase that consists of items of same units). The latter total is multiplied by 0.1 and added to the former to get the required sum.<n><n>### Sample Input<n><n>Input:Adam bought 3 kilogams of nuts and 3 kilogram of dried fruits.

One<n>  kg of nuts costs $ 12 and one kg of dried fruit costs  $ 8.  How much did his purchasing cost?<n><n>  Here in this solution we will explain the solution of the given problem by two ways:<n>   - **Divide and conquer (first step) :** Convert a fraction or decimals into the  whole number.<n><n>   Suppose that our problem here is: Adam bought 3 kg of nuts and the  2.5kg of  dried fruits at the store.  One kg of nuts cost $12 and  one kg of  dried fruirts costs $ 8. How much does he purchases?<n><n>   So we convert the fraction or decimals to whole numbers.<n>   1. divide the number of 32 to 3 to get 10 wholo numbers remain same.<n>   2. multiply 10 to 1(10*10) to get the answer 100<n>   3. convert 800 to whole number (800 -> 8000/2 ). Then the final answer is $800<n><n>  After that we will divide the money by 12 for getting the kgs.<n><n>  By using this method here the final answer is as below :<n>  Adam bought 3kg of nuts and the -2.5kg of daired fruits  at the store.  The cost of nuts or  dried fruirs are $ 900. The total cost will be<n>  $900/12 = $75 which is the cost of  nuts and dried fruits.<n><n>  In an alternate way we can multiply with $8. Then the final answer is as<n>  below :<n>  Adam ate 3 kg of nutz  and the -2.4kg of ddried fruit at the store.  the total cost  is $ 106.8.<n><n>  the final answer is again as below:<n>    Adam bought 3kg  of nuts and  -2.5kg  of dried fruits in the

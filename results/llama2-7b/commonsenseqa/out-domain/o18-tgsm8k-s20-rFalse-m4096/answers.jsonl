We are not sure which case the user inputs first, so we should always try to handle different problems.\n1. If the input has two values like this case, we firstly convert both values to integer type to make sure they should be two number before comparison. Then get the output from ```outputCases[2][\"Output\"]```\n2. If the input has one value like this one, we need to get the value from ```inputCase[\"Input\"]``` and use the value to get the output ```outputCases[0][\"Output\"]``` or ```outputCases[1][\"Output\"]``` depending on the first input case is empty or not.  In our case, since the first input value is not empty, we need to get its value and then get the output from ```OutputCases[1]\u201cOutput\u201c```\n3. If the input has three values like this case, since the second value is a string, we need to convert it first. Then use all three values as parameters to match cases and get their outputs.\n\nThe code for this task is:\n```\ndef helper(input, output):\n    nums = []\n    for element in input:\n        if type(element) == str:\n            nums.append(int(element))\n        else:\n            nums += [element]\n    if len(nums) == 2:\n        return int(outputCases[2][0])\n    elif len(nums) > 2:\n        if nums.count(nums[0]) == 2:\n            return", "answer": "D: say you're welcome"}

Choices:  B: conducted experiments C: invented scientific terms D: studied nature in depth E: thought up new methods of teaching\nOutput:B\n\n### How we solve the problem?\n\nThe first approach we took was to try to identify an unambiguous algorithm that will help us obtain the answer without any additional information. If we succeed in doing this, then we have a good chance to write the algorithm in Python as follows:\n\n> \n> First, we will try to define a set of operations.\n\nFor example, if we had the following problem:\n\n<table><tr><td width=\"33%\" valign=\"top\"><img src=\"img/pic04.png\" alt=\"\" /></td><td width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\">\nIf a 25% off sales price is $12.97, what is the initial price?\n</td><td width=\"17%\" valign=\"top\"></td></tr></table>\n\nThen we will try to write a program that would evaluate this problem for example. In this case, based on the information received we can suggest the following algorithm:\n\n<table cellpadding=\"0\"\nborder=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"top\">Step 1:</td>\n<td>Read the sales discount percentage.</td>\n<td valign=\"top\"></tr></td><td valign=\"\">Step 2:</td>\nRead the price value before applying the discount.</td><td valign\n=\"top\">Step 3:</td><td valign=\n\"top\">Multiply the price value by the percentage from\nstep 2 (to find the discounted value).</td><td vali\ngn=\"top\">Step 4:</td><td align=\"top\">Subtract the new\ndiscounted value from the initial price to find the new\nvalue.</td></table\n\n> 2. If the first approach does not help, we also have the chance to use mathematical induction.

These 5 integers are: `(3x + y) x (33x - 9y)` `(93x - 46y) x (7x + 8y)` `(21x - 23y) x (10x - 11y)` `(61x - 19y) x (15x - 3y)`\n\nThere must be either 3 or 4 of these 5 numbers to be a possible solution. Also, the first number is always greater than the third number. In this data, the largest possible integer is `(7x + 85y)` which makes the sum `(1452x + 6506y)`\n\nThis sum comes to (98415). `(98415 - 98415) x 98414 / 98413 = 1`\n\nThe other solution to the data would be `(927x - 931y) x (111x + 262y)` and the largest integer in this case would be `(495x + 299y)` which gives the final sum `(72567)`\n\nFinally, the only possible case of `(70x + 3y) x (700y - 3x)` is `(72237x + 700", "answer": "C: desk"}

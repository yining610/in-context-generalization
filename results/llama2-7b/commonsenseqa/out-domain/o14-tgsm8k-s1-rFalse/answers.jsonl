{"text": "If you wanted to see a lizards natural habitat, you'd have to go to a part of the world that is nearer the equator, since that's where all the lizard\u2019s inhabit. From what you were told, there are four different options you can choose from. Each choice will give you a different option, so you will want to do some critical thinking before picking your option.\n\nTo see the lizards natural habitat you are going to want to go to a place that is in a warmer part of the world, because the places you were given are not warmer enough to be able to see the lizard, but are not as hot to the point they will die. The first option, A, New Hampshire, is located right in the United States which means it is not as warm, and they will not have that many lizards in their area. There are still a few warm states in the United States, and some even grow as far as California and Texas because those are the warmest places in the U.S.A, But those are not as good for lizards due to some other predators like humans and other animals they can get eaten by. The second option, B, South America, is very warm, but there are humans there that will most definitely hunt lizards and you do not want to be there to see a hunting happen. Option C, New Mexico, is too cold for the lizards. New Mexico is more cold than hot. The last choice, E, is not the warmest, but it is better than the rest, mainly because it is not the hottest.\n\nNow with that being said in mind, there are only four options to pick from, but do not think that choice D, Japan, is not the appropriate answer, since this answer would be correct if this situation was based on how cold the weather would get if you were to go to the places to look for a lizard.  \n\nIf choosing to make your selection on this question, remember that you should not have an answer that does not follow along with the original instructions.", "answer": "A: utah"}

How many sheep have both white fur and a long tail?\n\n### Response\n\nThe question stated that:\n -The first three sheep have brown hair\n -The next three sheep have brown hair too \n -The rest have white hair\n -Three have short tails while the rest have long tails as well\n -The question asked how many have both white and long tails.\n\nNow we have to know two conditions:\n The first three all have brown hair\n The rest all have white hair\n\nFor the first condition we check three possibilities:\n 1.First three has brown hair\n\n2.First three has white hair\n \n3. The rest has brown hair\n\nSince  we have 3 possibilities, the probability of having brown hair is 3/5, which means 3 out of 5 times the first three have brown hair.\n\nFor the second condition, we check 2 possibilities:\n The first three has brown hair\n The rest has brown hair  \n\nNow, the first two possibilities (1 and 2) have the same probability but we've to subtract the possibility of white-brown from white (2).

In this case, the perimeter of a triangle can be used to solve this problem. The perimeter of a triangle, P = 3(AB + AC + BC). If we let B = 11 and C = 19, then AB = 2(C - B). So the perimeter of the triangle is 2(19 - 11) + 11 + 19, or P = 3*(28 +11) = 82. Now, the shaded area, A = 1/2 P x H, where H is the height of the triangle, or the length of segment BD.

{"text": "Answer:A\n\n### Instructions: The two strings you are going to use here are \"1231\" and \"23425\". You are going to need to replace only the first character with that character's position in the string. So for example \"1231\", the first character is the number 1.\n\nWrite a function that takes a string and 2 integers A1 and A2 (where A1 >= A2) and returns A string.  You can use a for loop to get the first A characters.\n\nWhen you return the string, you are going to just print the string with the number A1 changed to A2. You can change A1 to A2 inside the string using `i = i.replace` but a quicker approach is the following. The string i will be returned will be just a regular string (not a javascript object) but it needs to have a value of 7 because that's what it needed to go in the string.\n\n### Example:\n\nExample:\n```\ni = \"1231\".replace('1', '7')\n```\n\nExpected Result:\n```\n> 23425\n```\n\n### Notes: The function can be called many times with A1 and A2 changing the first A1 characters of the returned strings.

{"text": "I would choose D, because in a music store, one will usually have instruments stored in the back room as opposed to other items stored in the isle.\n\n(Instructions for Task One:)\n\nIf given an input, respond with a reasonable multiple-choice response.\n\n(instructions for Task Two:)\n\nIf given a math question, respond with a reasonable math answer.\n\n### Response to peer feedback\nI do agree with you that it is possible that someone could give you a wrong input and you answer with a wrong answer even when the right answer should be given by you but the input was wrong in the first place.  \nOne thing to note that this input is an example of giving a wrong input in this case.  I think if it is given, \"He went to the music store and bought a cello\" is the input given instead of \"What group of musicians includes someone playing the cello\", then my answer would be different. The example shows that if one is given the wrong input, he/she still should think and answer the question properly even if other people don't do what is right in this case because if one does not question the validity of the input, then it would be impossible to answer the question correctly.  This is why you always should double check input before answering any task. Sometimes giving wrong input is intentional.  \nIf you give a wrong input, then you will have a wrong answer. This is the same for any other thing.  \nWhen you are programming, most of the time, you are the user and it is possible that the program gives you a wrong input for a valid task, then you will have to answer either through giving the input again and then getting the answer or by asking the computer to restart.  \nI do understand, if someone says that is wrong, then no one can say you are right. You must have a reasonable reasoning behind your answer. If you don't then your answer is worthless.\n\n### Input Validation Problems\nIn the previous lesson, I learned how to use a switch statement. We also learned about switch statements with an IF statement. One thing that I didn't understand was the usage of the string variable in a switch statement. I thought that I would never encounter these kinds of problems in the future. However, in this lesson, I encountered an input validation problem that I didn't expect.\n\nThere are", "answer": "B: symphony"}

An expression is a combination of numbers, variables, and operators.   In order for a specific expression you are using to be an expression, it must also contain at least one variable.\n\n### Example:\nThe expression (5 * (4 + 3)) / 2 is an expression because it includes at least one variable.    Notice that the ( symbol and the / symbol are not variables, but operators.      ( * / )                      \n\n### Example 2:\nAnother way to understand this is to compare an equation and an expression.    An equation is an statement and is not an expression.   The equation 1 + 5 = 3 is an equation and is not an expression    However, the expression 5 * (4 + (1 + 5)) is an expression.          ( * (/))                       \n\n### Exampke 3:\nIn order to show how an expression can be simplified, we need to understand that all expressions are equal too each other.   If you think about it, one expression is simply another expression expressed in a different way.\n\n### Solution: Equivalent Express", "answer": "A: disorientation"}

Many young children want to keep an animal of their own as a pet. This could easily lead up to a huge fight in a household. There are many things to consider when looking for a pet. Some people want a cat while others want a dog. \n\nCats are good for people who do not enjoy a lot of exercise and would rather rest after a long day at work. Dogs are good for people who enjoy playing lots of sports and games and who are willing to exercise all day or night.\n\nWhether you are keeping a cat or dog, make sure that there is plenty of space in the house for the animal to move around in. If you do not have the space, you will not be able to properly care for the animal. There will not be space for the pet to get exercise, to roam around, to pee/poop, or even for it to sleep in a comfortable place. \n\nIf you do not have the time to give your pet plenty of love and care, you should not have one. Animals need a lot of time, affection, and attention. Not many people can offer their pet or pets these things all day. This will make their life miserable. If you do not want to commit to putting up with any of the above mentioned problems, do not have any pets in the house.", "answer": "C: equal opportunity"}

{"text": "C\n\n### Input : Choose the word that should be used instead of \"duties\".\n\n### Demstration\n\nInput: How does a person\u2019s job involve the same skills as their hobbies? \n\n### Response\n\nInput: A job is a formal activity in which you are paid to work. It is a regular or permanent activity in which you are provided with the necessary machinery and tools to carry out your work effectively. It also involves working for hours under the supervision of your boss. One of the important benefits of having a job is that you will be paid for the job you have done or are doing. \n\nAnother benefit of having a job is the fact that you can build up a good reputation for yourself in the workplace. Your work and how you carry out your duties will determine how well your reputation is among your co-workers. \n\nHobbies, on the other hand, are other activities you engage in or enjoy doing in your spare time. Hobbies can be your pastime or you can do it as an activity to supplement your income. Hobbies are not activities that will guarantee one their daily bread, but they usually make you better in one or more of your skills. \n\n### Input\n\nInput: What does it mean to say that you\u2019re \"practicing for your new job as a police officer\"?. Use the word \"to\" and \"with\" correctly.\n\nDemonstration: With police-like movements or activities, you are practicing something that you are going to do or will be doing as in a new job as a police. Practicing \"with\" something means doing things with the intention of becoming successful in that thing. When you say, \"I'm practicing with a police officer\" you mean doing things with a police officer because you are preparing for the opportunity of becoming a police officer.\n\nResponse: Practices: Practices means the act or a repetition of doing things.

In Python, I learned how to create and use a function. I created a function called \"hello\" and \"hi\" function to say hello and it works perfectly and outputs the right and appropriate messages. I also understood how do we declare and initialize variables. Also I read an article about Python language (which is my favorite programming language) and I learned how I can apply it in real world applications. In Nodejs, I learned how to connect HTTP server with Express server. I learned how to set up Nodejs environment and write a code of HTTP server with Express. I also understood that in Nodejs we don't need to install a server for web development, instead we run it ourself, thanks to Express server.\n\nThank you professor. Thank you classmates.

There was a picture in an article, that had text on it, but the editor couldn't figure out the name of the font the article had been used in, because it was a font that did something different.  In the article text, the font would change its size and color during the length of the sentence the text was in.  What was the font's name?  Choose the one option that is correct for the problem.\nAnswer:\nIncorrect. That's not what \"variable font\" means in CSS.\nCorrect. The font, in that example, changes from bold, to normal, to light, during the sentence it's in.  It's the \"font weight\" attribute that changes.  But variable fonts change their size.\n\nIncorrect. There is no such thing.  In CSS, a font style is a particular size and weight pairing (e.g. one specific combination among the \"12px/bold\", which might be used to describe the font in the example).

He strolled off to his favorite part of the forest, the part that had the most comfortable trees. Jack settled down on a large oak tree and began to whittle some wood with his knife. The wolf's stomach was full, but he was still not quite satisfied. Suddenly he had an idea. He grabbed Jack by the tail and began to drag him all through the forest, whimpering and moaning the entire time. Finally the wolf dropped Jack in a patch of grass, and he was too dizzy to get up after being dragged so far. As soon as Jack stood up and looked around he realized that he could not find his hat anywhere.\n\n-\"The wolf could hear him crying as he sat in his kitchen, enjoying a baked dessert for dinner.\"\n\n### Answer:3\n\nAfter Jack was tired, he sat on a big oak tree to whittle some wood while Wolf dragged him all through the forest.

Jack said that if the wolf brought him 3 sheep in a day he would pay him a huge price for 1 sheep.

Jane had 8 pieces of steak and her friend had 6 pieces of steak. 23 eggs were used total. Both girls shared the cost evenly. How much money did each of them spend?\n### Response:\nThere were 3 stamps and they weren't of equal value so we can't simply multiply the values by the number of stamps. We have to take into account a few things. They have the same number of stamps and we know that more stamps cost a bit more or else they'd just get the bigger value stamps right out of the box. One way to do this is to have each one buy four stamps for the amount of each larger one. We will use the larger value because it's more practical when buying stamps.\n### \nI:A 16 \n### Instructions - Answer:\n\nThe four largest and four smallest numbers were chosen to be multiplied.

Also, this is not what is written in the question.  4-B does not make the sense because a blowfish lives by themselves.   5-B does not mean that a man is eating, blow fish live by themselves(not be eaten)  6-C is the right answer. Blow fish is eating, fish lives by themselves, it lives in a river which is not a little mermaid and not pet shop.  7-d does not make the sense.  Also, it does not live on its own.  8- B does not make the sense, D does not make the sense.(it is a fish so no man is eating it, it lives in a  river.)\n9- I will assume that he means D. but it is not a great outdoor and he is in pet shop. So I will explain it by other answers. D does not make the question.\n10- I will again assume that he means D but again it is not a great and he does not live by himself. Here C and D do not make the sense and also C does not live on the market, D also does not make the sense and there no man is eating blow fish.\n11- a blow fish lives in a river where he eats the same answer as C.\n\n### Exercise:Complete the chart using the correct choice or answers.\n\n### Choices:  1: E 2: None of the above choices  3: A  4: D  5: A  6: C  7: D  8: A  9: D  10: C  11: D  12: E  13: B  14: C  15: C", "answer": "C: great outdoors"}

Binder is the most appropriate choice from the list of answer choices.\n\n### Input:(I didn\u2019t write the question, it was one of my peers) I have 3 cords.  I use the longest one 70% of the time.  I use the second cord 20% of the time and it\u2019s the shortest.  I use the third one...\n\n### Response:(I didn\u2019t really answer the question the way I should have. I said that my third cord was never used and that I still have it.)\n\n### Explation:Based on the provided information, we have a situation where the first and third cords are never in use. What are likely the chances for me to use one of these cords? It\u2019s impossible to tell based on the scenario. We still have evidence that suggests the longest and shortest cords are used on most of the time. If we use the longest cord 70% of time, the shortest should be used most of the time as well. Then, we have the case where 20% of cords are used and only for 70 seconds. This will never happen. Hence, we cannot arrive at the answer.\n\n### Question:In a class assignment, the students were asked to write a question where the answer is an even integer.  Here are their responses.

In this question, if they took the cost of one pen, then each pen is worth $0.10. 0.10 x 3 = 0.3, which is the value of the pencils, 3.5.\n\n### Other Responses: 8.5, 9.5 (Their second response is wrong.

What is Jane\u2019s ratio of eggs to milk?\n\n### Response\n\n3:4\n\n### Explained:\nThe first thing I noticed in the question was that, the ratio of the 2 variables( 4 eggs and 3 cups of milk ), was given as the final answer. So, I knew that I had to take the whole amount given as final answer( 4 eggs and milk, respectively) and divide it by the variable the question gave. Taking 4 eggs/4=1 and 3 cups/4=.75..75 is the answer to half of 3 cups, which in essence is the ratio..75 is 3:4", "answer": "A: nebraska"}

{"text": "- Answer A:\n\nBus stations should be in a convenient location for their passengers, so that the whole experience of catching the bus is as smooth as possible.  Because of this, the location of a bus station should include:\n\n  - accessibility, so people have no trouble finding it;\n  - a space where people can wait for the bus;\n  - a place to buy a ticket;\n  -  a shelter that provides protection from inclement weather;\n  - a safe space at night for passengers waiting for a bus;\n  - security, in case of theft/vandalism or other crimes.\n\nA bus station that meets those requirements is the nearest train station. Passengers who use buses regularly or for special events such as school trips may use public transport more often than they do. The train station is convenient because it's easy to find and usually located near to other people (like buses). In addition, train stations have waiting rooms and shops where people can board their trains safely and without worry about being attacked on the way there or back home again.  The trains themselves are large and can hold many passengers at once, so they'll never get full even if someone else comes looking for a seat later.\n\nThe other types of locations that could be used as bus stations include convenience stores, supermarkets, or malls. The best part about these places is they're already populated areas where there are public restrooms (which makes sense because you need somewhere to go when you get wet) and a place where you can spend money on things like groceries!\n\n- Answer B:\n\n**The best place for a bus station is on the street.**  The reason is that this is where people going to bus stations want to go.  They do not need any other type of transportation and they can walk straight there.  The bus station's location makes it convenient for travellers who live close by or are just passing by.  The street is also more reliable because there's no traffic or pedestrians crossing it at rush hour or inclement weather (such as rain).\n\n- Answer C:\n> Bus stations should be near schools because they are the areas where there are the most people. So, if the bus station is too far away from schools, it might be difficult to get there.  Bus stations should also be convenient and accessible to everyone because", "answer": "D: city centre"}

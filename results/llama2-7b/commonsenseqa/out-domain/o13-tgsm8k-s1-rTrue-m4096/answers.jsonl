What does Sophia like to eat?\nOutput: Mexican food costs less, so Sophia's only choice is Mexican food. But this only solves part of the problem.\nHow many other combinations have two different prices and cost more then the other? The three combinations are 1+1, 2+1 and 1+2. Since Mexican food is $5 cheaper than Italian food she can get one Mexican food dish and get two of the same type of Mexican food dish. Therefore she has a choice for three different Mexican food dish or two type of Mexican food dishes each. So she can get a total of five Mexican food dishes for $<<5+25+25=<<5+25=50>>50\nSo she can get Mexican food or Italian food\nSo the final answer to this problem is Mexican food.\n\nInput:A and B are numbers.

Which two people do they have in common?\nOutput: The answer should be the two people in common should be the woman's daughter and one of her sons.\nHere's what comes to my mind:\nA woman has one daughter and one son. So in total, there are only two children to choose from to have in common. When she has all 3 children with her, it must be either the woman herself or one of her children (because her daughter and son are too rare to be in both groups). However, the woman herself is not really a person, so we know that one of her children must also be in the 'in common' group, which leaves her daughter as the only person who can be part of the 'in common' set. So we could say it is daughter-son because this will cover a broad range of situations where the mother has other children also.\nHowever, we do not want to say specifically that the daughter is in common with the son, so we need to come up with another method to choose from. If the woman has two sons, it becomes impossible to have any two people in common. This implies we must have at least three people. In other words, a woman can have exactly two people in common, but she can't have three people to have in common.\nTherefore, it has to be two-out-of-three, daughter-or-son.\nSo the final answers is <<Son>>50\n\nInput: There is a man named John, his wife is called Mary.

She had candies in 5 groups and each group has the same number, which is 2 sticks more than the previous one. But, one day she got robbed and only 39 sticks were left in her pantry. How many sticks were in the group that the robbers ate?\nOutput: Lily had 52 sticks in her pantry. Since each group has 2 more sticks than the previous one, since 2 is a prime number, we can write the first three groups as follows: 12, 14, 16.\nAfter the robbery, she had 39.\nSince the groups had 2 more sticks, the previous group had 8 more sticks, as: 12,14,16,18,20.\nSo the fourth group has 24 sticks.\nThe fifth group, which the robbers devoured, has 26 sticks.\nSo the final group has <<26=26>>26 sticks.

You see a clown ride a bicycle through a ring of fire. You see a lion chasing a man with a bowl of milk. Finally you see a tightrope walker do tricks without falling to her death.  What is the probability that the tightrope walker was a woman?\nOutput: First of all, probability is the amount of something that someone (that you would) expect something.  We know that the tightrope wasn't a male tightrope walker because you know that the person was a human, and humans are female.  The human was a male clown, and we know that the human wasn't a lion, so you just know that the lion was a male.  The last human was a woman (the tightrope walker) and that is the same percentage as the women that do tightrope walkers.\nProbability is the amount of something you expect to see in a certain case, and there you saw a percentage of that in one occurrence.

But again, it is not the right answer.\n\nThe next thing that came to my mind is A and B both contains a public place, maybe we can think of A as a public place where the poor people live in because what if he just meant a public place that is far away and where normal people live.\nSince neither A nor B is the right answer I cannot choose neither of those. So the next thing that came to me is that, there is another way to look at A. We know that A actually contains a public place and if he is actually referring to his friend's friend's friend he just mean a public place and not A.\nIf we think of B we know that it contains a public place but it refers to a rich person's house. So if A was actually referring to his friend to a public place, then it would not be the correct answer. So what if A was referring to a different public place?\nWhen I try to connect A and sports I thought it may either have to do with a fitness center or something like that. And that's why A is the final right answer.\n\n## Other resources:\nI came across a youtube explanation here. Though I have found my own way to solve", "answer": "D: park"}

If a car averaged 1 hour per 12 hour day, what is the approximate monthly emission of a car?\nOutput: <<car=736/24=30.5>>30.5 grams of carbon dioide per person per year and 1 hour is 60 minuet.  A average car emits 30.5 g of carbon dioide which is 5 car CO<sub>2</sup> per day, 5+5+ 5 = 15 which in a month is 15 x 60 = 900\n30.5+900 = <<30.5+600=360.5>>360.5\nSo a car emits about 360.5 grams.

A 50% chance of rain only lasts 1 day. So if a 50% chance lasts 1 day, what is the chance of 2 continuous days of rain?\nOutput: 1:day = a 50% rain chance.\n2:day = a 60% rain chance.  Or a 40% rain chance (we subtracted 60% from 100%)  If a 50% (1/2 = 0.5 = <<50/100010001>>0.5) rain chance lasts 1:day, it also lasts 2:day.  Therefore, the chance that 2:day of rain can occur is 1.000 * 0.5 = 0.5, or 50%.  Therefore, if we assume that the chance of 2:day of a 50% of chance of rain is 50%, then it's 0.5 * 0.5; 0.5 to the second power, or 0.25.\nInput:A truck can hold 25 tons of sand.

How many candy bars are in the set?\nOutput: The box set contains 12 candy bars, 7 dolls, and 3 toys.  Therefore, there are a total of 22 items in the set.  From the information given, each box must contain either a candy bar and a toy or a doll.  However, some boxes cannot contain both a candy bar and toy or a doll, so there can only be 23 total items in the entire set.  From the 23 total items that are distributed amongst the boxes, 12 can only be candy bars while 11 are either a doll or a toy.  Therefore, there can't be 13, 12, 9, 6, 3, or 0 candy bars in the set.  This leaves us with 12 candy bar being the correct answer.  Therefore, there must be 12 candy Bars in the box set.

Counselors can also help improve coping skills in life by introducing new, more effective techniques.\n\nB: Counseling isn't a gift-giving session, rather it should be thought of as a counseling session where the counselor guides, assists, and educates the client to achieve insight and coping skills to improve mental health.

The maintenance and the battery test include free replacement but the car wash does not. A customer buys the car with all the extras and in the first 18 months he has to have the battery tested (without needing battery replacement) and the car washed twice. How much money did the customer have to pay the car company in the first 16 months? Do not include any maintenance.\nOutput: The price includes four years of free maintenance. In order to find the cost we subtract the maintenance (4 * 699 = <<4*699=2996>>2996 dollars) from the total price (23 for car wash + 2996 = <<23+2996=3229>>3229 dollars). The battery test is not provided for free to the customer. The battery test costs the customer 9.99 x 18 = <<9.99*18=179.4>>179.4 dollars.

What's the probability that a ball drawn from the bag is either:  A: white B: black or C: neither white or black?\nOutput: The probability for an event \"to happen\" is given by the statement \"The probability is the relative frequency divided by the sample size.\" The relative frequency formula is given by: f/n, where n is the total amount of balls and f is the amount that is favorable for the event. If we are trying to find the probability, then we need to find the relative frequency. We have 3 favorable white and 4 total in the whole set i.e., n = 7. So, the probability to find either white or black ball is given by: p = f/n = 3/7, but, here the event is happening. The probability to find a ball as in choice C has only 3 favorable white balls and 4 total but n = 7, and the probability to find a ball of choice C is equal 0, i.e., p = 0/7 = 0. But our question demands neither one is favorable option, so we have 3/7 minus the 0, 3/7 - 0 = 2/7, the relative probability for choice C is equal to 2/7, but the event is not happening, so the probability becomes p = 0. So, the final answer is C.\n\nInput: A school trip goes to the museum as a special activity. They tour for three hours and see 55 works of art in the exhibit hall.

They will receive 317 times this, or $8.5 x 317 = $8.5 x<<$8.5=1,000>>1,000.\nTherefore the final answer is $<<1,000=1,00>>1, 000.", "answer": "D: talking nonsense"}

Jimmy spent $18. 50 ($18. 00 plus the $0. 50) because the value of the coupon is negative. The total amount he spent is the original total price ($18. 55 ) minus the coupon ($0. 50), or $18. 05.The other answers are wrong because they think he spent $11. 75 or $8. 25 \nHowever they forget that the coupon was negative which lowered the final bill total.\nSo the final choice should be B.\n\nInput:The total cost to mow six lawns is $164.50.

The problem stipulates: 900 - 2(0.15) which could be interpreted as either 900 - (2 * 2) or 900 - ((15 * 1000) / 900) = 900 - << (15*1000/ -15*108", "answer": "C: deny"}

When you flip it once, it comes up HH. When you flip  twice, it comes up HT. What are the probabilities of 4 or fewer flips you'll need to see HT first?\nOutput: If you see one flip, we have a 1/2 probability of getting HT and a 1/2 chance of getting HH so the probability is 2/2 = 1. So we can say that if you see 1 flip, the probability of seeing HT first is 1.\n\nIf you see 2 flips, we have a 3/4 probability of getting HT and an 1/4 chance of getting HH for a total probability of 7/4=1.75. So we can say the probability of seeing HT on the second flop if you haven't seen HT on the first flop is (2/2*1.75)=2.75\n\nIf you see three flips, we are now doing a binomial distribution which goes:  nCr(n-1) * P(success) * (1-p)^(n-1). We have 3 * 1.75 * (1/2)^2. So the total probability of HT before seeing HT is 5.5.\n\nIn general, we can say that for n flips, the probability of seeing the second HT before seeing the first HT is:  nCr(2n-1) *  P(Success) * (1-P(Success))^(2n-1). So for four flips: 4Cr(2 * 4 - 1)", "answer": "C: wrong house"}

So if i count each rotation of the hands, then i have two options.  -1 + 1 = 0, or 1+1 = 0.\nSo the total number of times i need to count to get 0 in each direction must be 4, because i start on a 2 and then i get to a 0 both times (2+1 and 1+1).\nSo the final answer after the calculations it 4\n\nInput:The average (mean) is 30.

However:\n - If John broke the curtain, then John felt REALLY bad because Evan would be upset because John broke the curtain but John broke the window, he doesn't feel that bad.\n - If John broke John's door, then John would feel bad because he would have to fix it, but he doesn't want to!\nThe only logical choice is that John felt bad breaking the window across the street because the space shuttles do not exist on earth.\nSo the final answers are the front door and the window across the street\n\nInput: Peter and Mary both saved $10.

The giver counts down 20 questions, and the guess-er has 20 questions to guess the item.  During the game, the guess-er must ask a question to determine the item.  The question cannot be one of the following: \"What is it?\" \"What do you want?\" \"Tell me the name of the item.\" or \"What is the item?\"  In addition, the guesser must begin each question with \"Is it...\"  and end the question with \"....\"  If they guess the item correctly, then the guess-er wins; otherwise, they lose.  If the guess-er asks the same question twice, the game loses one point from their score and starts the game again.  There are 5 game rounds, and guess-ers can win up to two rounds.  Players that do not pick a secret item cannot win the game.  How many points does the person need who guesses and wins the first round?\nOutput: It's a tie.\n\nInput:Mia and Jack both have boxes of chocolate.

So the cost of the recursive call is in the call stack and not in the actual calculation, so it doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s recursive or in for loops (this is why for loops on lists are quite fast.) This is usually optimized out. Here we can optimize this calculation and see the performance gain with list.count\n\n```python\na = [[2, 2],[2, 4],[4, 4]]\nb = list.count(2, a)\nb.count() #performance\n2\n16\n2\n2\n160\n```\n\n```python\nc = sum(map(lambda x: x[1], [list.count(2, [2, 2]), list.count(2.0, [2, 4]), list.count(4, [4, 4])]))\nprint(c)\nd = b\ndef sumRecursion(x):\n    sum = 0\n    if x == 0:\n        return sum\n    else:\n        return sumRecursion(min(x - 1, 0)) + sumRecursion(max(x - 1, 0))\nsum = sumRecursion(d)\n```\n\n\n### Instructions:Answer the multiple choice question:\n\nInput: Josh has a large tray filled with 18 coins that are 85% penny, 10% nickel, 3% dime and 2% quarter.

It takes approximately 2.5 gallons of gas to fill my car up. $0.30 per gallon of gas. My car has 12.3 miles per gallon in the city and 21.5 miles per gallon on a highway. If I drive a little more than 50 miles on the highway, I can get between 246-249 miles per tank of gas. The car has an 18 gallon gas tank. My car cost me $23,000 to buy new. My car also costs me $200 in regular maintenance and repairs. I paid $10,000 in depreciation. The car costs me around $40 total to drive for a one-way trip of 50 miles. How much does it cost me to drive 50 miles in my car?\"\nOutput: The car is expensive to drive when it is driven on the highway; it actually costs you more to drive on the highway than to drive on the city, but the city trip is longer and so you use more gas for that. Therefore it is cheaper to drive in the city. In this case you would benefit from driving more slowly but you are not getting a full 249 miles like you are getting on the highway. We therefore subtract 35 from the 246", "answer": "A: jewelry store"}

Even if they were, the different teachers and school lunch periods divided them apart.

They explained which lockers and bathrooms were occupied, which teachers to stay away from, where the best seats were in the classroom and which jokes to ignore. Every day, she saw them in the hallways during the lunch hour, hanging out near the water fountain, and at the end of the day, they waited underneath the school library, hoping to find a seat on the bus together.\n\n### Instructions:Answer the questions about one of your friends or family members.\n\n-What is the best thing about your", "answer": "E: may laugh"}

You need to print only 9 of the numbers, but it is common to print the number itself and not the string representation, because then it would be much harder to print with just one line.  The Fibonacci sequence is the series of numbers whose first two terms are zero and one, with each subsequent term being the sum of the two preceding terms: zero, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89,... Note that the 0 and 1 are added separately so you can use a loop to add the two consecutive terms together each time.\n\n\n### Instrument:Create a function named fib that uses a counter to produce the following output:\n\n\n\n123456789\n\n\n\n0 1 1\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n1 0\n\n\n\n0110\n\n\n\n\n\n### \ud83d\udca1Hints\n\n \n\n### Hint\n\n- You can put more than one line in a single line.\n\n\n\n- To print a number, use string concatenation\n\n\n\n## \ud816\udfb9\u2564", "answer": "C: victorian house"}

Run `python part_B.py` to check.\n\n# In Part A, run `python part_A` and Part B run `python part_B` to check if you followed everything.\n\n## The idea behind the `in.py` file\nWe use the input.py file to keep our data to pass to the problem solver instead of passing it into `main()`.

However, as you can see in Part B, we are returning the variables to the main function. Now, as you move through the program you'll see these values are added to other variables.\n\n## How do we get our problems out of Python\n\nSince we are using Python as our interface to enter and solve problems, we have to get our input and our output into this format.\n\n**The input function** `get_input`\n* gets all of our input\n* loops through it and breaks it up into lines\n* each line is further split by the space bar and then we get the text between the last \".\" and the next space character, and we store that in a tuple:\n      `(\"text\", line_index_tuple)`\n* we build a dictionary where the key is a string of an input question and the value is a tuple of the same format.\n\n## The main.java function\nWhen it's time to run the code, we use the `main` function to give it", "answer": "B: shout at"}

This is evident because your output is 100 instead of 10.<n><n>Here's one way to calculate how many "legs" Mary has left. Count the number of animals. Count the number of "legs" on each animal. Add the numbers. Use that number to calculate how many more animals you need to have the same number of "legs". When you have the same number of animals, subtract that number from 89.<n><n>Remember, your task was to write a program that accepts two inputs, and two outputs: an integer (number) for the number of stickers stuck on the front page. A second integer (number) for total number of stickers used on the pages of her journal. Use this information to write a program that outputs two integers (numbers): remaining number of stickers and total number of pages.

In this game, the giver chooses another user in the room to be the "guess-er".  They pick a secret item.  They will answer questions from the guess-er to figure out what the item is.  The giver counts down 20 questions, and the guess-er has 20 questions to guess the item.  During the game, the guess-er must ask a question to determine the item.  The question cannot be one of the following: "What is it?" "What do you want?" "Tell me the name of the item." or "What is the item?"  In addition, the guesser must begin each question with "Is it..."  and end the question with "...."  If they guess the item correctly, then the guess-er wins; otherwise, they lose.  If the guess-er asks the same question twice, the game loses one point from their score and starts the game again.  There are 5 game rounds, and guess-ers can win up to two rounds.  Players that do not pick a secret item cannot win the game.  How many points does the person need who guesses and wins the first round?<n>Output: It's a tie.<n><n>Input:Mia and Jack both have boxes of chocolate.

So the cost of the recursive call is in the call stack and not in the actual calculation, so it doesn’t matter whether it’s recursive or in for loops (this is why for loops on lists are quite fast.) This is usually optimized out. Here we can optimize this calculation and see the performance gain with list.count<n><n>```python<n>a = [[2, 2],[2, 4],[4, 4]]<n>b = list.count(2, a)<n>b.count() #performance<n>2<n>16<n>2<n>2<n>160<n>```<n><n>```python<n>c = sum(map(lambda x: x[1], [list.count(2, [2, 2]), list.count(2.0, [2, 4]), list.count(4, [4, 4])]))<n>print(c)<n>d = b<n>def sumRecursion(x):<n>    sum = 0<n>    if x == 0:<n>        return sum<n>    else:<n>        return sumRecursion(min(x - 1, 0)) + sumRecursion(max(x - 1, 0))<n>sum = sumRecursion(d)<n>```<n><n><n>### Instructions:Answer the multiple choice question:<n><n>Input: Josh has a large tray filled with 18 coins that are 85% penny, 10% nickel, 3% dime and 2% quarter.

It takes approximately 2.5 gallons of gas to fill my car up. $0.30 per gallon of gas. My car has 12.3 miles per gallon in the city and 21.5 miles per gallon on a highway. If I drive a little more than 50 miles on the highway, I can get between 246-249 miles per tank of gas. The car has an 18 gallon gas tank. My car cost me $23,000 to buy new. My car also costs me $200 in regular maintenance and repairs. I paid $10,000 in depreciation. The car costs me around $40 total to drive for a one-way trip of 50 miles. How much does it cost me to drive 50 miles in my car?"<n>Output: The car is expensive to drive when it is driven on the highway; it actually costs you more to drive on the highway than to drive on the city, but the city trip is longer and so you use more gas for that. Therefore it is cheaper to drive in the city. In this case you would benefit from driving more slowly but you are not getting a full 249 miles like you are getting on the highway. We therefore subtract 35 from the 246

She knew a few people from her old middle school, but most of them were not in her same classes because the small middle school was broken up into different academic tracks. Even if they were, the different teachers and school lunch periods divided them apart. Lina thought about looking for another group of students to hang out with, but she worried that they would just pick on her – the shy new girl. <n><n>Lina was relieved to be invited into a group of girls she had only vaguely known from the middle school, who quickly adopted her as one of their own. That first week, these girls became a real lifeline as they introduced Lina to school in a way her new homeroom teacher never did. They explained which lockers and bathrooms were occupied, which teachers to stay away from, where the best seats were in the classroom and which jokes to ignore. Every day, she saw them in the hallways during the lunch hour, hanging out near the water fountain, and at the end of the day, they waited underneath the school library, hoping to find a seat on the bus together.<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the questions about one of your friends or family members.<n><n>-What is the best thing about your

Which option would you choose, and why?<n>Output:  Saving<n>(Explanation): If you put $5 in the bank, you will probably deposit less than $5.  If you save it, it will compound (earn additional interest) over the years.  If you deposit the $5 money at bank, you won’t be able to use it – you can’t spend what you don’t have, and the $5 you could spend will lose value if you keep it in the bank.  This is a basic case of the “opportunity cost” where you “give up one thing for something else”.  (The “time value of money” is one way to model opportunity cost that arises from savings and investment.)<n>

Brian went to C and said “I’ll have a white wine. Carlos went to B and said “I’m going for a white wine”. When the bartender served the drinks, each person had a different colored glass. Bill had a red wine, Brian had a red wine, and Carlos had a white wine in a white glass. But Bill said he had a red wine. Brian said he had a white wine, and Carlos said he had a white. What’s wrong here?<n>Output:Carlos and Bill both ordered white wine, but Brian said he ordered a red. If they all ordered the same thing, then they wouldn't all have a different-colored glass, and they'd be able to solve the puzzle by comparing notes. This means that when all of them say they have a different-color glass, they're lying. And when Brian said he had a red, that means he can only tell when things are red, which means he is color-blind.<n><n>Input:There were three people A,B, and C standing on two ladders, their ladders were not of equal height and they were not on the same rung. A was on the lower rung of the taller ladder, B was on the upper rung of the shorter ladder and C was lying on the ground. What was C?<n>Output:C was the only one who knew, because she was lying on the ground, she could assume that her knowledge was not as good as it could be, because she didn't know what was happening with the ladders.<n>

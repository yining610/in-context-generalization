(This means that the group will equally share the bill) 2) there will be only one person pays the bill for the group; he will get the bill if he is responsible to pay. Therefore, If the group pay the bill then the person who pay the bill only pays half of the bill.\nFrom the two scenarios we can say that Choice B is the responsible person to pay the bill. \nBecause in Choice A if every body pays the bill evenly then her boyfriend should pay the bill because he is one of the group therefore the bill gets divided by 10.

At the end of that form I must give the teller or someone there my signature to process the transaction.  If they had a computer that could process all this information, then there would be no need to ever do this again.  I can give my signature once to a computer, and the transactions I perform would be recorded without an additional signature needed for each transaction at any particular branch of my banking choice.  They don't need to print and keep all the forms in a desk, because they can have an instant backup and an instant record if there were any questions as to the legality of the transaction.  This is just one problem but imagine this applied to every single institution in the world.  They all will have to do this if they are ever going to get rid of one of their most hated employees.

Choices:  A : famous musician B: famous poet\nD: famous actor E: famous inventor\nAnswer:\n\"It was the piano!!\n\nThe history of the piano started before the invention of the organ with the piano, the invention of the keyboard mechanism. In those days they used different techniques than now used, and different tuning with the same notes and with two or three other keys without any function. The first piano appeared at the end of the XV century.\n\nThe history of this instrument is lost, some say that it was a German invention, others say that it was an invention of an Italian origin.\n\nIt seems that this instrument originated in the court of Cremona in Italy, probably because the organ was not very well received.\n\nIn the middle of the XVI century it began to spread around the courts and the palaces.\"\n\nThis means that when he was only 8 he was inventing something that would make him famous\n\"In 1709 he was called to France, and in 1716 he founded the \u201cConcert Spirituel\u201d of which the virtuoso Marie Antoinette d\u2019Autriche was a member. When he was forty years old, he published his first musical pieces.\n\nThe first time he performed in public was in Florence, Italy, 1691, where he appeared as a piano improvisation player, a new and fashionable instrument, made by Bartolomeo Cristofari, who had been in service at the court of France.

{"idx": 668, "text": "Deflation is the opposite of inflation.  If a nation attempts to lower the price level by setting the rate of inflation at zero, the effect on economic activity and prices depends on the starting point. If the rate of inflation is already high or near zero, then deflation increases economic activity. If the rate of deflation is low, deflation decreases economic activity.  If the rate of defation is near zero, then defation has very little effect on economic activity and inflation.\nSo the final answer will be E.\n\nInput: What could be the reason for increasing governmental spending and tax cuts and reduce governmental regulation?  Choices:  A : to stimulate the economy. B: to increase the economy size. C: to increase inflation.D: to increase price level and prices. E: to reduce money supply.\nOutput:The basic idea of increasing governmental spending is to increase aggregate demand. This will increase economic activity and cause higher prices to push the economy toward full employment.  A tax cut, however, does nothing to increase the amount of demand except as it might decrease savings and increase borrowing by consumers and business. It will not cause the economy to produce at full employment as a government spending project will. The government cut in tax rates is of little help to increase aggregate demand.  Government tax incentive can increase both the supply of saving and the demand for investment.  The government can reduce regulation in the financial sector to provide more channels of investment and credit. \nSo the final answer should be D.\n\nInput:Which of the following will happen if the money in the economy becomes more stable? Choices: 1) consumers increase borrowing to finance their desired spending,2) consumers will reduce borrowing to reduce spending, 3) consumers would decrease borrowing to increase spending, 4) consumers are likely to decrease borrowing so they could save more and borrow less, 5) consumers are likely borrow more to increase spending.\nOutput:The money in the economy becomes stable when it is not much affected by changes in market forces or shocks. It is a basic factor in the aggregate demand, which consists of interest rate, money supply and credit availability. If the public is confident about the financial system, it is easy to get the loan.

{"idx": 856, "text": "R: I do agree that roving bands of monster would lead to a panic but it could also lead the government to come out and take things a bit easier. A band of monsters can be explained away if only one person sees it and that person can be called insane. Now a panic would probably lead to the government coming out in force. The government may try and protect the citizens if it becomes known that there are monsters out there but they would probably do that after the panic has set in. The problem with a panic is that people are unpredictable in a panic there may come a time when someone starts shooting at something that they think is a monster and if the other people panic you have a tragedy on your hands. I would say that the worst thing that could happen to you for killing a monster would be a lot of people trying to sue you in order to gain some money after the fact. They will blame you for making the situation worse by killing the monster and you are going to be in a lot of trouble if you are actually paying attention to the laws that are put in place after something like this happens. The second thing that you will have to be concerned with is the government coming in after the fact and trying to take control of your life. The government will come to you with the idea that they could help you out so don \u2019 t expect there to be any panic in the government but they will probably try and take care of the problem before it becomes a panic. The government is pretty good at this but it \u2019 s not the same in every country so you might have some issues in other countries.

This can be shown by writing out the numbers:\n\n3^2 = 6, 4^2 = 16, ( 3^2 )^2 = ( 6 )^2.\n\nIf we divide by 2 it takes two pieces of 3 by 3 with length three to form a 6 by 6 square.\n\n3^2 * 9 = 6 * 9, which is 54 pieces. These 54 pieces include rotational.\n\nWe can see there are 3 by 3 pieces, 3 rotational 3 by 3, 6 by 6, 3 rotational of which 6 are rotational 6 by 6 pieces, 3 rotations of 6 by 6.\n\nLet the first square be one with two short ends parallel, it would only have four rotations. The second, third and forth would each be four, leaving one of each to be taken.\n\nIn conclusion there are 11 pieces to take.\n\n- Second question\n\n\n\n### Part III\n\n### Instructions:Solve as many problems as you can.

So we can assume \nthat the program may assume that the input string is 5 characters long. \nBecause I am familiar with Hackerrank questions, I can be sure to assume the program can't assume anything else. \nSo program should do a check that there should be exactly 5 characters, else throw an error \nand ask the user to enter again. If the program gets 5 characters, the program should check that the first character of the string is A. \nIf character is not equal to A, again throw an error and ask the user to enter the string again. \nIf the character of the string is equal to A, then the program should check the second character is B. If the second character is not equal to B then throw an error and ask user to enter again. \nProgram then checks the 3rd character that if this character is C or not. If the 3rd character is not equal to C, then throw an error and again ask user to enter the string. \nProgram then verifies the 4th character is D or not. Program should check all the characters of the string are in the choices array. If all the characters in the string is correct and there will be the answer that is \"correct answer\" which is \"C\". If any single character is wrong, then throw an error. \nFor the test case, test case 2 is chosen and expected output is \"C\". If the program will run 100 times successfully with the same data, then the test case should pass.\n\n### Code for Solution:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport string\n\"\"\"\nInput: Shake Hands\nChoices: \n    A - Shake Hands\n    B - Own Property\n    C - Pay Bills\n    D - Smoke\n    E - Talk To Each Other\n\nOutput: C\n\"\"\"\nstring = 'Shake Hands'\n\n# The condition is only for this case\n\n# Check that Input are 5 digits long (excluding spaces)\nif len(string)!= 5:\n\tprint(\"Error\")\n\twhile len(string)!=5:\n\t\tstring", "answer": "C: pay bills"}

{"text": "A\n\n### Solution:\n### Answer\nIn order to arrive at the correct answer, the student must evaluate the question in a number of ways and use multiple equations.\n\n### Solution\nIn order to arrive on the correct solution to the \"combined ages\" equation, the student has to take note of both Hurley's age and the given difference between Richard and Hurley's combined age.\nHence, their combined age has a value of 128.\n\nThe second given equation asks the student to find the combined amount that Pablo would have by the time he read the number of pages necessary to complete the problem.  The book has 150 pages and he collects a penny per page.  The solution would, therefore, be 150 pennies and one less penny in change.\n\nTo follow the last equation, the student must consider the total sum of each individual's portion based on the given question.\nFrom there, the equation then breaks down every individual's portion to the remainder after the subtraction of Brad's portion from the remaining amount.\n\nThe given fourth equation asks the student to calculate the total number of units sold based on a preset price of $3000.  In order to do this, the student will need to take note about the amount of the initial total price, divide the price evenly, and use the remaining amount from the initial total price in order to determine the slices of pizza left.\n\nIn order to find the correct answer to the fifth given equation, the student will need the total amount of the entire pile of water, the number of days that the storm lasted, and the minimum amount that can overflow after the fourth day.  Then, the student will divide the first two amounts by the third, and subtract the remainder from the fourth day minimum, arriving at the correct answer.\n\nFor the given sixth equation, the student needs to find the total number of skirts and coats.  In order to arrive on the right answer, the student will add the number of skirts divided by two, and will then add the number of coats that has been preset to 4 in order to arrive on the given answer.\n\nThe seventh equation asks the student to know the number of wicks with which they have to finish the task.

{"text": "D\n\n### Solution:The output of this program is:128\n### Explaination:Input:The difference in ages between Richard [14] and Hurley [20] is 20.  If Hurley is 25 years old, what are\ntheir combined ages 40 [128] years from now?\n### Explaition:Richard's age is 32. Hurley's age is 25. Richard is 27 + 4 times Hurley's age and since Richard is already 32, it means that Hurley's age must be 14. So their combined age 40 years from will be 128.This is the answer.\n### Instruction:Answer the remaining multiple choice question.\n### Solution:Instruction:Input: The chef has [11] eggs. He puts [10] eggs in the fridgeand uses the res [7]est to make cakes.\nIf [5] eggs are used to make one cake \n\n### solution : Input:The chef has 60 eggs.He puts 10 eggs fof the frigde and use the res[10] eggs to make cakes.If eggs are used to makeone cake.so that the ans will be 60/5 and res[5] eggs is [12] \n### explanation:Answer: Cake baking works out to a whole lot of math.  Fortunately, most of that math\nalready exists in baking. As an example, most cakes will use exactly 12 percent of an egg. You can figure the percent by dividing the egg\nby the total you have. For instance, a recipe that needs five whole eggs and one yolk will work out like so: Total eggs = 6, so the whole egg percentage is 12/6 = 2/3\nA single egg will equal 2/3, or 67 percent, of the whole. A yolk will equal out to 33 percent, which is 12 percent of 2/3 of a whole. So, if this worked out to be 12 percent of six eggs, the calculation would actually work out to 100/6, or 16.67 percent.", "answer": "C: san francisco"}

We have to parse (look at each value), and decide which one we want based on specific criteria (as in the last question).  \nYou can parse this type of problem by building a simple array with the different possibilities based on what the user has. In other words, create each array element by using the previous one with a conditional statement.  Remember that in arrays, you can't use >, <, or <= without making a variable first, as the only valid variable names are those of your program!\n\n#### Instruction\nWrite a program to print all the prime numbers  up to the user's number.

{"text": "D\n#### Solution:\n### Answer:\nChoices A and C can be ruled out from the start since they are outside the limits of the given premise. As for choices B and D, we've got the premise that all of the rock's energy will be transferred to the water, which means that at most one-half of the rock's total energy is transferred to the water. That's where choice D comes into play, with a surface of earth choice which only contains half of the energy. Choice B however contains 2/3rds of the rock's kinetic energy which is impossible, so we can rule it out as well. Therefore for choice D, the given assumption and logic are correct so this particular option is our answer.\n\n### Answer:D\n\nChoices A: B: C: D: E: none of the above\nOutput: C\n#### Solution:\nAssumption: if the age of your younger brother is 32 years, then how many years ahead he's 62 years will be, so there will be 62 years and 10 years less than 72 years and then after that the age of the older brother will be 20 years less.\n\n###Answer:C\n\n#### Solution:When you find the product of a number with 100, what you do is to move the number two places towards right.

Your algorithm should check whether both points are on a straight line and use the shortest straight line to travel between points. You may assume the points (X, Y), (Z, W) are within the XY plane and (x, y), (w, z) are within the XW plane. Your algorithm should create line segments between every point on your given points and calculate distance as Euclidean distance between every line segment.  Write a Python program to do this. Hint: Pythons's math module has functions \"dist\" and \"line_in_polygon\" that you may find valuable.\nOutput: \"You should make the function line_in_polygon to do more checks as needed.

{"text": "C\n\n### Explanation\n\nMy explanation for how I solved this is very simple. I used my basic knowledge of 10th grade math like, basic algebra, exponents and variables.\n\nFor example, when it asked, \"If each child's ticket was $7, how much is adult's ticket?\", we know that each child's ticket costs $7, so does the adult ticket.\n\nI know, it is a very basic knowledge, but it is very easy to forget since I studied math in 10 years ago.\n\nIn the question below, \"The chef has 60 \u200beggs. He puts 1o \u200beggs in the fridge and  uses  the rest  to make  cakes.  If he  used 5  eggs  to make one cake\", it is because, I remembered the knowledge of simple arithmetic (Addition, Subtraction, multiplication and division) and the question is very easy to solve.\n\nBut, as you may know, a programming language is different from basic math. Programming is more about thinking, how to find out the solution step by step and the logic of the problem step by step.\n\nPrograms are basically instructions to a computer, but I think a computer can only understand some part of us.\n\nAnd, I think, it is up to me to understand a computer by myself.\n\nIn other words, I must be able to solve logic that I cannot see on a computer.\n\nIf I cannot solve it by myself, I will be able to learn as much as I learn, but I can't teach my computer what to do.\n\nTherefore, logic is very important to me.\n\nWhen asked what you are trying to express in the following sentences, do you agree or disagree? My explanation: I agree, there are many ways to express the ideas in the following sentences, but to me, it is important to write so that the reader of my expression can understand it easily.  It does not mean that the expression must be written the same way it is spoken, but I think the important thing is, the expression must be logical that the readers can understand.\nInput: I am going to the bookstore to get a copy of my book.\nOutput: True\n\nInput: I think there are a lot of words you could use to replace the word \"book\"  in", "answer": "E: sporting event"}

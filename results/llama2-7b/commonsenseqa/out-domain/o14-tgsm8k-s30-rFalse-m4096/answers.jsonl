(Hint: You should try to put yourself in the perspective of your teacher.  You can also use the question-answer format.)\n\nMy answer is\n\n#### Answer for Task 2:\n\nThe answer to the first question is: the possible reasons for choosing the approach are that we consider that we already have the information about the number of boys and girls in the family. So we can calculate by subtracting the amount of girls in the family from the number of boys.\n\nThe answer to question two is:  We can calculate the amount of money Iris's brother should give her for a birthday party by getting the number of people who will attend Iris's party. It will be 23. Therefore we need to multiply the number of people by the amount of money each receives.\n\n#### End ###\n\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\nwith open(\"input.csv\", \"r\") as csvfile:\n    reader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',')\n\n    for line in reader:", "answer": "A: go to church"}

This bait will last 10 hours. The bait is 99.95% effective.  In total, it will cost you 62.5 dollars to solve the problem. Choices:  A. 13.30 hours B. 32.5 hours C. 2.5 hours D. 1.283333 hours E. 62.5 hours\nOutput: E -> In this question the options which are the time the total lasts for is from 1 to 6. From looking at the problem it means that you have 20 pounds of bait so 2 pounds of bail is 1/10th of 20 pounds. It follows that 2 pounds of bia lasts for 1/10 * 10 which is 1/1. 1/1 is 1 so 10 hours is spent fighting a rat. The question asks for the total time it takes to fight 10 rat, so it is 5 (the number of rats bait is used on) times 10 (the time spent on each rat) as it takes 10 hours to kill 1 rat. This is 50, then dived by 99.9, it gives almost exactly, but rounded to its full precision 51. 25 (divided is.999 which does not give a exact answer..99 is an integer and in order to divide it you have to move the decimal a place over. When you put.9 and then use division you get 9/10. 9(decimal times 10)/10=90/10=90% but when you put.99 over you will get.99/10=99/100=99 %. We can assume that a % is 99% because when you do 99/10 and you times that by 100 you get 9900/100, which is 99%.)  This is a common approximation technique since is", "answer": "D: wakefulness"}

{"idx": 164, "text": "C\n\n#### Explanation:I got a total of $5,186.55\n\n##### Answer:Answer choice C: The correct answer is C. You don\u2019t want to just answer by dividing the numbers, because then you\u2019ll lose track. Instead, divide one by three, and one by six, and then add the two numbers you get together to get the actual answer. Dividing each number by three, you will get one and two, and dividing each number by six, you\u2019ll get three and four.  Finally combining the answers you want to add five and seven, which is where the answer came from in the question.  When adding each number, the number four stays behind, but when dividing the numbers, both four and six are left over for the answer.\n\n##### Answer\n\nFor this first exercise, the answer is choice C: $30 for an entire week or longer, so the total cost is $310. Dividing the total number of days you rented the car by seven will give you the cost for one day. The total number of days will not matter as long as you divide the cost, and then multiply that by the number of days.\n\nFor this second exercise, the answer is 72 because it takes 3 hours to drive each way, that\u2019s six hours spent driving, minus the one hour to make the trip, for a total of 72 hours.\n\nFor this third exercise, the answer is $52 as you take away half of $3900, giving you $1950. If each boy gets $1950, boys split $975 that gives you $2 per boy.\n\n##### Explanation:I have 39 pounds, which I calculated using the formula (6/1)*55.\n\n##### Solution\n\nFor the fourth exercise, the answer is D, $23.  The answer choices are listed in order, with the first person having 2 children, the second two children, and the third 3 children.  To figure it out, you can multiply each children together and then add those numbers, giving you (1 * 2) + (3 * 2) +  (4 * 2) = 7.\n\n##### Final Explanation:The pizzas is a different type of way to", "answer": "D: city block"}

Well, change can be a good thing\u2014but only if you look for it. If you are not seeking out what is new or novel, you often miss it.\n\nAs I looked around my house, that thought hit me. Not so long ago, it seemed like my entire life consisted of paying bills. At first, I missed that ritual. Having never been a saver, my bills were not always in order. It made me nervous, even on days when the money was available. Now, however, I actually found the time and money for other \u201cpains.\u201d I spent five hours a week playing hand games with friends, and an equally joyful amount of time relearning to play the flute.\n\nAs for the \u201cprize,\u201d it was more than I expected. At a recent family gathering, I was called to the phone by my sister. When I returned, my mother said, \u201cPeggy is here. Do you realize that she hasn\u2019t taken a single payment in four years?\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until that moment that I realized how much my life had changed\u2014and how much it had changed for the better.\n\n### My answer\n\nInput: Change can be a good thing - only if you look for.\n\nB: Bills are a thing to miss but change is a thing we look for only.\n\n### Questions:\n\n1. What is the passage talking about?\n2. Why isn't the life always good thing in changing?\n3. How should we do to find the new things in the life?\n4. What is the good thing about \"change\"?\n\n### Answer:\n```\n1. Change\n2. Life and change are two different things. Life is always good but change is bad for the person because there must be reason for his or her to change at this time of life.\n3. To find new things we have to look for the change. But this is not the good things but it\u2019s a bad thing.\n5. Because sometimes change is bad for the people in our life. If their life and time is not proper then we do not have to care about the change in their life but the positive change is for the people we should welcome.", "answer": "B: welcome change"}

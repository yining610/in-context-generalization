There is also no other choice but for the head of the branch to yell at his boss to get a point across.

Choices:\\  A. foot B. branch C. boss D. base E. owner\n\n## Rationales\\ Reason: The context reveals that there is only a single branch, which means there can only be one head of the branch.  All three of the non-owner choices are people that are lower than the head of the branch because the head of the bureau is above the head of the branch, which means the head of the branch is the boss of the head of the branch.

{"text": "If you said playing dead, then you got it right!\n\n### Choice:A\n\n### Rationale:\nIn her book \u201cThe Secret Life of Dogs,\u201d the author Victoria Schade argues that dogs not only play and have fun just like we do but they are also very clever and enjoy playing on their own. One of the common ways that they play around the house is to \u2018play dead.\u2019 This may seem like an odd thing for your dog to do around the house, but, like all children, they will learn to be polite.\n\n### Choices: A\n\n### Rationales: The act of \u2018playing dead\u2019 seems like a good way to keep yourself out of trouble. If you decide to jump on top of your dog and put your face right in front of his while they are pretending to be dead, then it is very easy to trip. When you fall off your dog, you will be the one who looks silly, not the dog.\n\n### A\n\n### Choise: A\n\n## Choice: C\n\n## Rationales: This might seem like a good way to get your dog to listen. However, I have seen many videos of dogs who were \u2018trained\u2019 with positive reinforcement. These dogs, in the training videos, always came to the owners when they were given a command. Dogs, in general, are very intelligent animals. They will learn to come at your command when they truly want to and they will not listen when they are too uncomfortable to do so.\n\n## Choice :E\n\n## Rationale:\nThis is false. Playing dead means that the dog is pretending to be \u2018fake dead.\u2019 Their eyes are open and they are not really dead.\n\n## C\n\n## Rationale\nThis is false. When talking to dogs, it is best to talk in a low, calm voice. This is also a good idea when trying to control your dog.\n\n## C \n## Rationale: Dogs do love to play around with their owners. Playing around does not mean that the dogs are bored. They are having fun with you because you are doing what they enjoy.\n\n## C,\n  \n## Rationales\nThis is false.

John cannot go to work because he would not be able to hold tools with injured hands. He will definitely not be going out with his friends tonight and his job will be in danger because of his injured hands.\n#### \nAnswer: B\n\n### Demo:\nA family collected $120 total for their recycling and $20 each for their efforts to reduce, reuse, and recycle. The family spent $50 on toys for their children, $75 on books and DVDs for their library, and $25 to send the kids to camp. 1) How much did the family spend on toys? 2) How much did the kids spend at camp?\n\n### Rationales: 120 is the total amount of money the recycling made the family. $50 was spent on toys. $75 was spent on DVDs and books. $25 was sent to the Kids Camp. So the total spent is $25 + $75 + $120 = $<<25+75+120=230>>230.

If Sam\u2019s job took him 4 hours and George\u2019s job took him less than half the time that Sam\u2019s did, how much time did George\u2019s job take?\nRationales:-Sam was hired to cut 3 trees down in 4 hours. Therefore, -Sam was hired for $25/4$=<<25/4=6.25>>6.25\n-George was hired for 5 trees to cut down. Therefore, -George was hiredfor $25/5$=<<25/(5)=5>>5.\n-Sam was hired to do the job 3 times the amount George was.\n-Because Sam is hired to cut down more trees, he takes twice as long to cut every tree down in total.\n-Sam takes 3 times as long to cut down the first tree in total.\n-Therefore, George takes 2 times as long to do his job.\n-Since George\u2019s and Sam's total work took the same amount of time, George cuts his 5 trees faster than Sam's 3. Hence, the time George took was \u00bc the time Sam took.\n-So, 3/4 = <<4/4=1>>1.\n-Let\u2019s multiply to find out how long George takes.\n4 = <<1*4=4>>4\n\n#### 1\nAnswer:1", "answer": "E: neatness"}

B is what you would like something to be fun.\n* C-True. C is what you would like learning to be, and by its nature learning is supposed to be like that, and in essence it's supposed to be enjoyable, and it's also supposed to be joyful. This is true because the more they learn, the more they know, and the more they like learning because they think they are accomplishing something more in their field and what they are learning is enjoyable. C is true.\n* D-False. D is not what you would like learning in general to be. You would want learning to be free to be the right choice for a student when he/she needs to gain a certain perspective. Someone who isn't into learning might also not enjoy it for a different reason, which would also be unjustified, or the person might not be enjoying it because he/she doesn't like the learning method. D is not the right choice.\n* E-False. Just because it is the answer doesn't mean that it is true for all people. Because it is not true for all people.

By doing so, they can do what they want without feeling the pain. This will also help make learning a joyful and painful process.\nB: Free: This is false because free is not the correct answer.

{"text": "#### A\n\n### Rationales:  A:Swimming burns calories and increases muscle strength. In order to improve your performance, you should consider incorporating regular swimming into your regimen. Swimmers need to breathe constantly as they swim, which can make it easier for them to maintain a steady pace while working out. Swimming has been proven to reduce stress, as well as promote cardiovascular health.\nEven if you prefer land-based activities, you might want to give swimming a try. It\u2019s a great cardio workout and can help you make major gains in your fitness levels.\n#### B\n\n### Rationale:  B:Jogging is a low impact activity that can be done by people with any level of fitness or experience. You can run for a few minutes, or do intervals where you run for a few minutes and then walk for a few minutes. This can be a good exercise for people who are new to working out.\nJogging is a high-impact activity that involves running at a moderate-to-fast speed. This type of exercise is great for people who are new or have been sedentary for a long time.\n#### C\n\n### Ratioves: C. Excercise:  Increasing your strength and muscle tone is the goal of exercise, which is an easy to moderate intensity workout. Exercise can be performed in a variety of ways, including jumping jacks, running, brisk walking, and swimming. \n#### D\n\n### Rates:D. Work out:  Work out is a great way to stay fit and healthy, whether you\u2019re working out in a gym or exercising at your home. Working out can improve cardiovascular endurance and keep your body in shape, but it can also build muscle and increase your strength. Keeping fit is an important part of staying healthy and maintaining a normal blood pressure.\n\n#### E\n\n### Ration:E.  Rock climbing:  While rock climbing can be a fun recreational activity, it can also be a useful form of exercise. The aerobic nature of this activity makes climbing an excellent way to raise your heart rate and burn calories. Many climbing gyms now have a full strength training", "answer": "A: swim"}

Pablo repeats this process 60 times. How likely is Paul's children to receive a wormied fruit at least once?\nRationales::  1) We are 20% sure the fruit will have a worm.\n    Let A = the fruit has a worm, B = it doesn't have a worm. A has a 2/5 chance of occuring and B has a 3/5 chance of occurring.\n\n    2) We only have half a can, so we know 2/60 of the time there will be a worm.\n\n    A/A+B=20/60=0.33\n\n\t    80/100=2/5\n\n\t    2/5*2/60=2/30\n\n    Since that is how many times there can be a worm, we simply subtract it from 1, leaving us with 1-2/60, which is how many times that a fruit will not have a worm, and therefore, how likely one of the fruits is to have a worm, which is the answer.       3) we need to take the complement of 2/60, so, just subtract, like before, 2/60 from 1\n\n    4) We did this once, if a fruit is picked then it is thrown out.\n\n    5) We do the same as before.

For example, the word bathroom is not related to shower or with water hence bathroom can be eliminated.\n\nThe word gy mnasiu m is the only correct answer because every answer which has gy mnasiu m has some reference whatsoever to shower or water. A: gy mnasium is actually a noun and gy mnasiu m will be a noun phrase. So gy mnasium m will denote room with shower.\nB: gy mnasimom has no reference to showers so this can be eliminated. The word rooms in gy mnasimom can be eliminated since gy is the prefix to mnasium and m,s is a suffix. Hence we are left with gy mnasiums.\n\nHence gy mnasiums m can be eliminated since the first part of this word( which is room with shower) has no reference to shower as gy mnasium m does. That is why the last part of gy mnasims m has been crossed out.\n\nThe word motel room has also been crossed out since it does not have any reference to shower.\n\nThe reason why locker is crossed out is that locker room and bathroom have been already crossed out.\n\nHence, out of all the possible options that we are left will be gy mnasium m and only gy mnasium m has some reference to shower.

{"text": "There is $50 for every $200 in change you bring in to purchase. Write an expression for the expression for the number of coins of any type when you bring in $300 in change. You will find the 4 coins with the most value and bring the most of each one.\n\n### Rationales: The solution is: $$300-500$$\n\n### Explanation:\nThe first thing to do is to subtract $500 from $300 because that is the cost of the coins with the most $500 coins so you have to subtract the cost from $500 to $250. Then, you would take $250 - $100 which would give you $150 and we take the numbers you will bring back by $50 and $40 which leaves you with 40 coins. Then you use $300 - $40= $<<300-40=260>>260 for $300. Which also leaves you with 160 + 10= <<160+10=>$ 170 coins overall. If you bring in change you always get the same amount no matter how small or how much but you have to purchase the coins that are worth at least $500 because that is what is valued the most and then you subtract.\n\n#### Answer: 170\n\n### **Input:**\nWhat you need can you buy with $16?\n\n### **Response:**\nYou need $16 to buy 3 items of the ones you have selected.

But when he was released, he went right back to drugs and alcohol, destroying his life. \"That was my own fault,\" said Kerr, his now ex-wife. \"I wasn't there to stop him.\" John was soon arrested on drug-related charges, and because he had no job, he was homeless for a time.  During that period, he found himself spending much time with other men who were also homeless. Most of them, John noticed, had one thing in common--when they'd been able to work before their downfall, they'd been employed by a cleaning service. \"I was in a place where there were all these people who were just doing nothing,\" Kerr said. \"I had a lot of time on my hands. That's when it occurred to me that I could start my own cleaning business.\"\n\n### Rationales:While spending time with other homeless men, John Kerr noticed that a significant number of those men had formerly worked in the cleaning industry.\nKerr realized these men could work together.\nSo, he formed his own cleaning business to help fellow homeless friends.\n### Input:It was a hard decision, but Jolie and Eric decided to sell their house.

So as soon as they felt ready, they posted their house on Craigslist and priced it 30% under its market value. Eric went to work that day in a panic, certain they wouldn't make their goal. The first two people who saw the listing, however, offered a bid well over the asking price. The offer for the house was so high that Jolie and Eric began rethinking their strategy.

{"text": "A) If you were Jim, you might want to choose answer choice A (going to jail).  A criminal would most likely end up in prison.  Going to jail means that Jim would be put in jail for a short while and then be released to go back to killing people.\nB) If Jim were a criminal, then answer choice B (going to prison) might be more likely.  Going to prison means that he would stay in jail for longer, like after two years and before going back to killing people.  Prison is different from jail because it is used for criminals, like prisoners.  Jail is used for criminals who committed a small crime and were released quickly.  Answer choice D (get arrested) would not make sense for Jim, because he already got arrested when he committed crimes to kill.  Also, he was the leader of a mob that killed so many people.  It would most likely be a lot harder for Jim to be arrested.\nC) Death is not likely.  Criminals who get caught for murder end up getting arrested, where sometimes they go back home and then get released within a few years.  The cops will not likely find a corpse in which the criminal may die from.  It is also unlikely for the cops to beat up Jim when they find him, because they want to kill criminals who killed people.  Answer choice E (die) does not make sense because Jim does not want to die.  He wants to be famous among his criminal friends for killing people.

They used their stawberries to make jam and the cost is 7 strawberrys for each jar made. How much money did they earn?\n\nAnswer: If Betty and Matthew each only picked 16 stawberrys and sold jars of their strawberries for $4 then they still earned $4+$4=$<<4+4=8>>8 each. But if they each picked 16, picked 24 more, and picked twice as many strawberrys as Betty then they earned more. Betty made 32 jars at the same cost of 7 strawberys per jar. Matthew made (16+24)+2*(16+7)=<<16+24+2*16+7=40>>4 jars. The total is 40 jars for 288 strawberrys. So each jar they made cost Betty 9 strawberrys and each jar cost Matthew 18 strawberrys so each earned a profit of $4-$[18-9]=$<<4-3=1>>1$$. Since each jar of strawberries they sold cost Betty and Matthew $4 and they each sold 1 jars then each jar Betty and Matthew sold made each $1 profit.

How many hits were recorded for your team?\nRationales:\\nWhen your brother is batting, he is guaranteed to get a hit (unless he goes 0-for-4). \\nThus, there is only one chance of a hit and the probability of a hit is 1/2. \\nTherefore, the probability of recording a hit in a game is the sum of the fractions of the number of times your brother is batting with the probability of a hit added to the sums of the fractions of times when you are batting with the probability being the same as your brother's. \\nSimply put, the probability of recording 100 hits is: \\nTotal number of trials: n = 20 \\nProbability of getting a hit: p =.5 \\nTotal number of hits: sum of all 20 trials = np = (100).5 = 50 \\nHence, the probability of a hit recorded in a game is 50/20 or.25\n\n#### 50\nAnswer: 50\n\nInput: In a game of cricket, the team that scores the most runs wins. In another game of cricket, a match is drawn if the scores are level after four full innings. In a match there are three innings to each innings played by both of the teams involved in the match, a match is said to last five full days but a drawn game lasts only 2\u00bd-days.\nWhat is the chance that a match will terminate with a tie?\n\nRationales: A match can go either 5 or 2\u00bd days, but if it goes 2\u00bd days and is tied then it is a draw.\nThis is equivalent to rolling a dice where 5 is a draw and 1 to 4 is the end of the match (a batsman is out).\n\nSo the probability of a match lasting 2.5 days is 1/6 then if it goes 5 days in 6/6 cases a match", "answer": "E: law suit"}

If your family collected for example 85 cans and 7 kg of paper, how much money would your family receive?\nRational : Since we don't use the cans, it's 85 cans minus 85 cans / 17 can = <<85/17=5>>5. Since we don't recycle the paper there's some extra because we recycled some of the paper...85 / 7 x $0.89 = <<85/7*0.89 = 9>>9. So 9+0.30 = <<9+0.3=3>>3\n\n#### 3\nInput 93: Betty picked 40 strawberries and Matthew picked 106 strawberries more than twice as many as the last time strawberries were picked at home. He used their strawberies to make jam. In the end one jar contains 15 strawberries and sells for $2,40. How much money were is all together that they made from the strawberris.\nRationale : 40 + (106/2) = <<40+(106/2)=213>>213. And 213/15=<<213/12=17>>17. We sold 17 for $2,4 = 4 $2,40.

If he sells the used car and buys a new one every 5 years, how many used cars will he need to buy.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n5-year intervals x 2 used cars = 5 years x 2 needed\n\nRationale:\n\nIf you sell 2 used cars, it would take 5 years to get the money needed by selling 1 used car and saving the rest for 4 year intervals.\n\nRationale:The car was $10,010 because it includes sales tax. He starts with $10,040 ($10,001 - $8) so he will need 5 years x 10,046 to get that much money.\n\nRationale 1: You get $8,344 each year, and sell each car for $8,444. \n\nRationale 2: He wants to sell cars every 5 years each time. If he saves what he makes from selling the car, he will get that amount and save more money. If he wants 5 more cars to equal 5 years, he will need to sell a total of 10 cars. \n\nRationales:It takes 5 years for him to save enough to buy another used car.\nThe math is:\n\n5 years x $8.344 = $36.748\n\n1 year x $8.390 = $8.39\n\n$36.747 more than $8.39 = 4 years of $36.750\n\n$36,790 > 36,750, therefore he needs 4", "answer": "E: cause accidents"}

{"text": "D\n\n### Rationale:\nWhen we talk about feelings, we usually focus on more complicated ones like happiness and sadness. The reason we do this is because it is easy for us as humans to identify when someone is happy or when someone is sad. In contrast, identifying when someone is vomiting takes some extra thought and requires additional understanding. Furthermore, the feeling of being vomited is much more rare than the feeling of being happy. Therefore, more often than not you will see people talking about the former and not the latter. While feeling happy is good, vomiting is not.\n\n### InputAaron has $20. He deposits half of it into his savings account. How much does he have left?\n### InputA dog has puppies.

The speaker stated that he needed to check for an electric connection in the room.

If you are checking for an electric connection in a house you would not really go to a freeway where you would probably get in an accident, or get stuck in traffic. \n-C:A company does not fit with what the speaker meant by check an electric connection.

I put them in a jar. Is it more likely that I get all quarters, or all tails, or all ones?\nRationalesThe probability of getting all quarters is 4/5. The probability of getting 0 quarters is not 0 or 1, but 1/(1-4/5).\nThere' not enough time to solve this.\n#### \n\n## Dem: I have 10 beads. I put 3 in one jar and the rest in another. Is anything more likely?\n\nRationales:The probability of getting all of the beads is 1/10.\nThe probability of getting no beads is 10/10.\nThere not enough time to solve.\n####", "answer": "D: shelf"}

{"text": "Answer choice E: drink coffee is the correct answer\n\n### Input\nSasha has just bought a chicken for $2.75. She gives her friend Shana one-third of her chicken for her birthday. She uses the remainder to make soup. How much chicken is there left over?\n\n### Rationales: There are two parts to solve in this exercise. The first is to divide the amount of chicken that was left over in the problem by three to find out how much the friend was given. We do this because the friend is given one-third of the chicken, so we need to reduce to the decimal equivalent of 1/3 to find out how much Shana was given. Shana was given 0.33333 rec. Once the friend was given her share, there was 0.3875 rec left. We use 0.38 rec because it takes the least amount of chicken (0.225) to answer the question. Next, the amount left has to be multiplied by $2.75 to figure out how much money she made. Shana earned $0.9875 rec while that amount was multiplied be $2.75 rec ($0.987) to get the total she made for her birthday.\n\n#### Output: Sasha has just bought a car for $144.32.

{"text": "The answer can be found by calculating the ratio of \"gas stations\" to \"city\".\n\n\n1. \"gas stations\":4,805\n\n2. \"city\":1,259\n\nSo, there are 4,805 / 1,259 = <<4,805/1,259=3.735>>3.735 more \"gas stations\" than \"city\"\n\nBecause \"London\" and \"Train station\" were both mentioned, but neither was \"gas station\", it was not necessary to include them in the calculation.\n\n\n### Input\nInes had $20. She used her money to buy a pack of stamps and then some baloney, which normally cost $5 each. The package of stamps had 25 stamps in it, and she had to pay tax on them. This was $2.20 worth of tax, but since the tax was a flat fee and did not depend on the actual cost of the stamps, she saved $0.70 in tax. The pack of baloney cost $5. Ines spent $15.25 in total. How much did she spend on the baloney alone?\n\n### Response\nI can solve this using ratio or proportion.\n\n### Ratio:\nI can make a ratio.\n\nI will add the numbers and divide them.\n\n\"Ines had $25 in her purse. \" 100 / 4 = <<100/4=25>>25 2\n\n### Proportion:\nI can make it into a proportion.\n\n1.) the first fraction being equal to \"Ines had $2 in her purse\". 25/2 = <<25/2=12.5>>12.5 \n\n1.) \"she used her money to buy\" so it equals \" \" 12.5/4 =<<12.5/6=2.5>>2.5 \n \n2.) so 2.5x5=<<2.5x5==12.5>>$12.5\n\n### Result\nIf her only baloney cost only $12.5, then $12.5 / 2.5 < <<12.", "answer": "B: city"}

Let \\(a\\) the number of times a dog has not been groomed fully that is \\(a \\le 8\\). So The average number of groomed dogs have been groomed fully is 9 - \\(a\\).\n\nSo the average number of groomed has groomed fully will be \\(<<9-8=1>>1\\).\n\nLet \\(\\alpha\\) the number of times we have written note of reminder so \\(a \\le 9\\).\n\nSo the number of dollar bill earned per day will be \\(1a \\over 9 \\ = 1/9\\alpha\\).\n\nSo the Average the Average dollar bill earned  per week will be \n\n```r\n(1/9)*9*6 = 2.001 \\over 9*6 = 3.6667\n```\n\n### Inputs:\nIn the United States, a college student receives a loan.

If each team wins twice as many games as they lose, how many games did each team win and lose and draw?\n\n### Solution:\nIts not given which games are won, which games are lost and which ones are draws, so we don't know how many team won a draw, how many won and lost, and how many won.\n\nTo find the winning, we have to find the teams that won twice as many games they've lost.\n\nWe can do the same with the lost games.\n\nFor the draws, we know each team draws at least one game because they draw twice as many games as wins so to start off we can take all 30 games from the 30 airplanes that Jack and Diane made and give them each a 1/3 likelihood of being won. As the rules mention, they split into two teams, a team wins 1/3 of the games each, drawing half so: 30 - 15 = 15 draws 15/3 = 5\n\nWe use Diane's airplanes for both teams so we can still give her one game to be a draw. One game to win so we'll give 19 more draws, 26 in total for team Diane.\n\nUsing Jack's games, we know he losses 1/3 of them so 30 - 9 = 21 more draws, 30/3 = 1. He also wins 2/3 for 26 left, so 26/2 = 13 left, 49 in total for Jack.\n\nWe need to now total each teams wins and losses.

If we multiply both sides by 2a, we have (a +/- sqrt(-b2+4ac))/2a = ( -b)\n3. Since only one of the two solutions could be negative, we want to make the negative sign in the middle of the equation the same one as in the original problem; however, the plus sign in the middle of that equation must be a minus, so we reverse it (which is the plus or minus sign of the given original problem).\n4. You now have -b +/- sqr( -b2 + 4ac) but you still need to cancel the 4ac part with the -b2, so you multiply both of those sides by -1 to get the correct -b2 + sqr(-b2 + 4", "answer": "A: work in life"}

The ratio of boys to girls at Ann\u2019s School is 8:6. Which ratio shows a higher ratio of boys to girls when the class at Pete\u2019sm School is added to the class at Ann\u2019s School?\n\nRationales:The ratio of boys at Pete's School is 14:11=1.27 and the ratio of girls at Pete's Class is 9:11=0.81.\n\nSimilarly, the ratios from Ann's School are: 9/8=1.125 from boys, and 11/6=1.833 from girls.\nWhen their ratios are compared, we see that the ratio of boys from Pete\u2019s School to girls from Ann\u2019s School is the closer of the two, so boys to girls from Pete's class is higher when combined with Ann\u2019s class by a ratio of:\n\nBoys: Girls = 1.27/1.833=0.683:1\n\nThe new ratio of boys to girls is about 0.683.\n\n#### 0.6818\nAnswer:0.681-1\n\nIn the above answer, the rational part (rationales) will be omitted.

You are also helping students \"figure it out\" for themselves, encouraging them that they can do it. You are also building up the number of examples they have to go on in their future attempts at the task, which helps them feel like they can do it, which increases the chance that they will attempt it more often.\n#### Suggestion:\nOnce you give a few examples of student writing, start going in with the students to point out what is successful about their work (both the ones that succeeded and those that needed help). Have the students identify the successes as well. This is a time when you won't be correcting their work; instead, you are giving them praise and showing them what was done right.

Measurement is the process of recording the variables of a system in terms of standard units or quantities. Once a particular system has been analyzed in terms of the variables that are being measured, the next step is to interpret the results. A measurement will generally identify one or more system variables that might need to be adjusted. The process of collecting and analyzing measurement data can result in new information. New information can be used to develop a new hypothesis or to refine an existing hypothesis. Measurements allow researchers to obtain the most valid data they can.

So it is $6.  $12/2= <<12/2=2>>  So it is $12.  $12+6=<<12+6=18>>.\n\n### Rules:Each apple costs $4.  So it is 4x3=<<4x3=12>>13 bananas.\n\n### Answer:$12+6=6\n\n### Input:\"A car travels 50 miles in 1 hour. How many miles is the car going in half this time?\" \n\n### Rationales:  Each minute the car travels the same in both problems.  A half hour is 30 minutes.\n```\n30/60=<<30/60=.5>>\n50x50/1 =<<50*50/1=2500>>.\n2500/250 =<<2500/1250=2>>.\n```\n\n### Input\"When it rains you can expect it to rain more in the desert region, and when it's sunny you can expect it to be more sunny in the colder region.  Given that the rainfall in the desert region is 10.28 cm, with 74% of that rainfall coming on 2 days, how much rainfall from the colder region will it take in order to make up for both days of the desert region's rainfall?\"\n\n### Raitones:  10.28/2=<<10.28+1/2.28>>1.5895429595.\n1", "answer": "C: friend's house"}

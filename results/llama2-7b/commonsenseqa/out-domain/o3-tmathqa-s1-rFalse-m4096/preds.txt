A = 158 because it sold 198 hburgers and 100 sand which = 188 and 198 * 100 = 19800.<n>5. A = 178 because it sells 198 hburgr and 100 santwich which = 198, 198 *100 = 0, 198/ 0 = 178. This means no extra hburgers which is a profit.<n>

Therefore 12% of a number equals 1/8 of that number. Also, 12% of [80-84]/100 is 0.<n><n>2. A: 10 : 1 B: 5 : 2 C: 9 : 5 D: 2 : 7 E: 6 : 3<n><n>A merchant purchase a jacket for $60 and then determined the selling price that equaled the purchase price of the shirt plus a markup that was (20% of the selling price). During a sale, the merchant discounted 20% (the selling price) and sold the shirt. What was the merchant's gross profit on this sale?<n><n>The answer is A ($0), since the markup was 20%, the purchase price of the 60 dollars + 12 dollars markup price, (he sold the jacket @ 60 dollars).<n><n>Also, if we apply 0.8, the markup price  becomes 8 dollars, but $60 + 8 dollars = $68. Therefore, the merchant is still out the profit ($12 dollars) he intended to make. We do not see the point then why he made such a sale. He is still  (minus) 12 dollars poorer.<n><n>The answer is B ($3), since the markup was (20%), then the purchase price was $30. And the marketed price was $33. However if we discount the price at 20%, and it becomes $ 26.60, the answer is B ($3).

After a person stops the string, the ball remains 18cm tall. The highest and lowest point of the ball are 2x and 10x respectively of the length of the string. The length of the string is?<n>Answer:<n>Examine the question carefully. The question is not about a person dropping and catching a ball. Rather, it is written from the perspective of a ball that is suspended by a string.<n>The point of a ball when held in its highest position is 15cm higher than when released at its lowest. So, when released at its lowest, the ball is 15cm lower than it would be if not released at its lowest point.<n>The ball remains 18CM tall after a person stops the string. So if, at its lowest position, the ball is 5cm higher than it would be if it were not to be released, then the ball being 18cm tall would mean that it is 7cm higher than it would have been if it was not released at its lowest position. So if the ball is 7cm higher when released than it is when not released, release height - no release = (release height - no release) -7. The original position of the ball is at a 7th of its height from its lowest position, which would be (release height - no-release).<n>So the original position of the ball will be (release height - 7th from lowest). (release height - no -release) = (release height - (release height - 13 + 13) = release height  - 26  ). (release height - 26) = (release height * 9/26). (release height - 9/26 = release height *  26/9).<n><n>So, release height = 26/9.<n><n>Hence, Length of the string = 26/2 =  2 * 13<n><n><a href='https://www.educative.io/courses/learn-to-think-laterally-for-competitive-programming/M6HQf4MqyqfD'>Get this explanation in your feed</a>.

So we are more likely to answer it wrong. For example, the question is, "what percentage of 80 is 12?" The answer is c (8.66), and the correct answer is "b" (9.6).<n><n>#### **B**<n><n>  - It is worth noting that the correct answer is c (9:2), because b may be a ratio, but the merchant is only interested in percent mark, not a ratio. Therefore, you can ask the merchant whether he takes 9% of the price of selling the jacket as your profit margin, or 20% of the product price. The correct answer is c.<n><n>#### **C**<n><n>  - The correct answer is a (0). <n><n>  - Think about how the merchant could sell his jacket at a 20% discount of the selling price and maintain a 20% markup by selling at the original price.<n><n>  - The merchant will need a price that is between the original price and the discounted price. As the discounted price – 2 × 1/b ≥ d and discounted price + (1/b) + 2 × (1/b) ≤ b ≥ b < 2. Thus, the lowest price is B = a, which will cost B = d. In other words, this is 0%.<n><n><n>

(choose all that apply)<n>`1:Queue<T>`  `2:Queue<T>` using a static `List<T>`<n><n>What is the best approach to implement an array of linked lists?<n><n>### Question3: <n>Let’s say you have a class called Queue that inherits from a class called Stack. Let’s say Queue also has a property to hold integers, so you might do this: `public Queue() { <n>            // Initialize an array of double and initialize 0.0 value<n>        }`. Then, in main, you want to test calling this property. You think about doing this:<n><n>`// Call to Q.push(10);`. However, this will crash your program because calling it this way does not initialize the property for the Queue. So, which code statement below correctly initializes the Queue property `Q[]`?<n><n>```<n> <n>public int [] Q;<n><n>public Queue() {<n>            // Initialize an empty array<n>            Q = new int [100];<n>        }<n>```<n><n><n><n>### Question4: <n>Let’a us create a function which takes an integer as input and returns the maximum and minimum value from the integers 1 to n inclusive<n>You might think about doing this:`// int [] maxMinArr=new int [n];`However, this will not work because you have not made each element initialized. Which statement correctly initializes the array maxMinArr?<n>```<n>public int [] maxMinArr;<n><n>public Queque() {<n>            // Intialize a new empty array<n>            maxMinArr=new Iint [5];<n>        }<n> ```<n><n>### Question5:<n>Write a Java program to add two numbers<n><n>###### Input:<n>`int a : 2`  `int b : 3`<n><n>###### Output:<n>`int result : 5`<n><n>Output: <n>`b` + `a` = `5`<n><n>### Question6:<n>The solution to

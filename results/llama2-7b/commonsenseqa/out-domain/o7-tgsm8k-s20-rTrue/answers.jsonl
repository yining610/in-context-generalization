Half letters = 26 and half words = 6\n\nIf Lisa subtracts the half letters from the half words, it would give \"The difference is 21\"\n\nBut she also subtracted half of the total letters. \"130-130-0=0\"\n\nThe total letters divided by the total items in the half letters give her 4.5 or 1 + 1/2 - 1/2. The second half is the quotient which is 2.5, but it can't be a fraction, therefore, the answer is in whole numbers which is half of 2.5, which equals 1 and 1/2.\n\n\n\nInput:\"This book was one of my favorite books.

That is Europe, a Big house, Tuxedo, and men's room.\nThe gentleman is very wealthy, so we will first look at the most expensive choices, and see if either of them is more likely.\nThe most expensive choice is Europe. One of the most expensive places to live is France.  There would always be a chance that the gentleman lives in England, but considering that he is so wealthy that he wants to flaunt it, I'm going to be quite certain he lives in France.  So I'm going to choose the B choice for Europe.\nLet's compare that to the second most expensive location, which would be Big house.  The gentleman doesn't live in a house where other persons reside, such as an apartment building, and I'm assuming he lives by himself and not with family.  He doesn't live in an expensive mansion in the country, and I'm going to assume from the location that he lives in a city, in an expensive skyscraper. So the choice E choice is the most likely choice for the gentleman.\nSo if I go by the information I have I'm going to say that the most likely location the gentleman lives would be England.  That would place him in a fairly expensive apartment in a city.\nNotice that I didn't cross off any alternatives. This is done because there is information missing, and I can only look at the information I have.\nSo if the man was living in a country other than England, I would have crossed off choice A.\nIf at some point the gentleman got poorer, he could still live out of a men's room. I would have crossed off choices D and B, however, because the man is flaunting his wealth, and these aren't where I expect him to live.\nSo after looking at all this information, the only choice left is choice E.

Choices: 1: berry 2: vegetable 3: staminate flower 4: tree fruit 5: pseudocarp\nOutput: Bananas are a tree fruit, so they are classified as tree fruit.\nPseudocarp produces a fruit that contains an inner core that is inedible. The fruit is in this instance a type of vegetable, while the plant remains a type of tree. Because bananas can be eaten and don't contain seeds they cannot be considered berries. Bananas are not staminate flowers because these contain pollen; in fact, bananas can't even be a staminate flower since a true banana plant requires pollination with another banana plant.\nSo the final awnser is 4\n\nInput: You make a lot of cookies: 1: <<32=32>>36 in one hour, 2: <<16=16>>16 in one hour, and 3: <<10=10>>44 in one hour.

In this sentence, the verb ''I think'' is separated by three other subjects and four other verbs from the object ''There is.'' As noted above, verbs and nouns normally do not agree in number if the subject of the verb comes after the direct object. Is it grammatical, or not? Why?\nOutput: In the question, there is three other subjects and four verbs, all of which are plural. However, the verb, ''I think'' is singular. This results in a disagreement.\nOne possible solution is to change the verb from ''I think'' to ''I think ''.\nSo after the 'I', you can continue to say the sentence like this:\n\n\"There... I think 'is, however, one exception' ''\n\"There... I am not, however, a genius.\"\n\nYou can also change it to 'thought'\n\"There... I thought 'is, however, an exception' ''\n\"I thought, though, is an exception.\"\n\nOr you can use the negative form to get rid of the need for ''think'':\n\"I thought, therefore, there is 'is, however', one exception.\"\n\"Thus, there is one exception. There is 'is, however,'. Therefore there is one exception.\"\n\nAll the above methods do not conflict with the other parts of the sentence.\nTherefore, they are all grammatical.\n\nOutput: This answer is in fact wrong.\nUsing the correct sentence is,\n\n\"There is, however, 'I think one exception''.\n\nThe reason this answer is wrong is that when the answer has a subject and the original statement has plural subjects, there is a mismatch in number.\nSo this is an incorrect answer.\n\nOutput: The correct grammatical answer would be:\n\n\" 'There is, however, an exception'' is '", "answer": "C: bible"}

What are the steps they can take on a route with the following restrictions: they must move between car and bike at least twice. In addition they must never take 2 consecutive bike trips. How exactly many steps it will take to reach the end of the route?\nOutput: The person can start either at car or bike. In any case we are left to choose between one remaining transportation (car or bike) after taking two consecutive bike trips, therefore there are two possible ways to move after taking two consecutive biKE trips. We can either: drive, then biKE or drive, then car. There aren't more ways because we only have 2 choices in total, both car or biKE. Similarly, they must move between car an biKE at least twice.\nTherefore the route will have at most 3 stops and at most 5 steps including all the times taken to move from one\nstop to the next. The total number can be equal to 1, or to 4, but there's always a unique solution. Since we\nhave to move between biKE and car at least twice, the solution is\nbiKE(2+2)bike + car(bike+car)car + car(bike + car)car = 3\nso the total number of steps is three, the person can\nreach their destination walking by starting from biKE and ending\nup at car (biKE + car)total of:\nbiKE+car\n\nInput:How many people on average were born in 2007?\nOutput:Since the total population of the United States in 2008 was 296,068,483, a little more than 300 million.\nThis number is exactly 1/4 the entire population, therefore the number of people born in 2027 is 1/4 of the\npopulation at that time: 1/4*296068483 = 73517111.

So we have: corner, TV, attic, desk/stand, and the library.

To clean a yard, she must work for 0.5 hours. If she can clean 2 yards in a single hour, how many yards can Anna clean each day?\nOutput:- 2,281 yards each day\nSince Anna can clean the yard in 0.5 hours, we need to do 2 yards / 0.5 and then multiply that answer by 24. Since each yard is 0.5 hours long, the value for 1 yard is 0.25 hours. So for each hour, Anna can clean 2 yards. Multiply this by 24 to find how many yards to get a day:\n2*(24 hours/1 yard)=48\nSo Anna can clean 2 yard every second, and then repeat the process 24 times in one day to get to a total of 48 yards\n\nInput: A fruit orchard has 30 apples.

His monthly sales amounts to $1390.  His profits are 30 cents per loaf of bread and 32.9 cents per loaf bread. His expenses amount to 15.4 cents per loaf. What is the total profits?\nOutput: Let $L$ denote the number of loaves of bread sold in 1 months by the baker. To start, each loaf of bread costs 30 cents, so $L$*30 = <<L*30=300>>30, or, $300$ are spent on each loaf.\nSecondly, each loaf of cake costs 32.9, so $L$*$32.9 = $(<<L*32.9=329>>329).\nThirdly, each loaf expenses a cost of 15.4, so for $i$th loaf, $$(<<15.4$>>15.4).\nWe look to find the total profits in 1 month:  $$$($329 + $300 + $(<<15.4*L=111>>111).\nTo solve, replace $329$, the total cost of buying all loaves of bread, with it's value of $300$, and multiply both sides by the number of loaves sold (for instance, in $L=5$, we must multiply both sides of the equation by 5). Doing so, the right side of the equation becomes $ ($300 + 15.4*5 = $ (704.5/5 = $1,410.$\nBy plugging the value of $L=5$, into the right side of the original equation and simplifying, we can deduce $ 1,410 $ to be our answer.

She sells 68 pens on Monday, 20 pens on Tuesday, and so forth until her pen collection is depleted altogether. How many pens did she sell altogether?\nOutput: Jen had a stock of 468 pens. So if Jen had 400 pens initially, she sold 68 more pens on Monday, 68 more pens Tuesday, and continued until her pen supply had depleted altogether. In terms of math equations, this can be written as _______________________\nJen's pen supply decreased by 4 on Monday, by 4 every day after that until she had 0 pens remaining. Therefore, Jen's pen supply would decrease by 4 x number of days.\nWe set up a linear function to represent this concept: x - y = 4, to make life easier, we can write x as 4x.\nThe constant rate of change formula is rate of change = initial value / total change.\nIn this situation, the initial value is 468 and the change is -468.\nTherefore, rate of change = -(468/ -468) = 1.\nSo, we know that Jen's pen supply decreases at a rate of", "answer": "B: populated area"}

Each team plays a game where 0.1% of the fans in the stands will get free tickets. What is the probability that Aaron and his team get free tickets?\nOutput: The.25 batting avg translates to 10 hits in 40 at bats (batting avg of.25), while the -0.4 steal avg. translates to stealing 2 bases in 5 at bats (steal avg of -0.4), so the team has a 10 + 0.4 = <<10+(0.4=4>>4 average.\nThe 1.5 inn innings means that the avg number of hits + steals per game is 25% of the number of innings (0.25*in inn), or (25*0.25)/1.5 = <<25*0.125=3>>3.\nBarring the special game, the avg. % of plays that produce a hit-steal is (10 or 10 + 4) + (0.125*3) = <<10+(12.525=1.025>>1.025, or 1-ish %.\nThe special game says that the avg. # of hits*steals (in the special game) = 0.1%, or (10 or 4)", "answer": "A: pressure"}

So you will use the fact that 2 * average speed = average speed at 2 miles, to solve for his average pace to determine if you can possibly keep his pace for the remainder of the race. Do you think your teammate is beating his best average speed?\nOutput: We can use the information that 2 * average pace = average speed at 1 mile to answer the question as follows:\nWe must know how much your teammate's average speed increased.\nFrom the information that 2 miles = 2 * average speed, it must follow that 1 mile = 1 * average speed.\nAdd the 1 mile to each side of the equals sign:\n\n2 miles = 2*average speed + 1 * average speed\n\nSince your teammate's speed is increasing, and the left side is increasing faster, the right side must be higher than the left side, so the right side must be 2 * average speed.\n\nSubtract the left side from the right side to get:\n\n1 mile = 1* average speed - 1 time average speed\n\nSo, 1 mile = (2* average speed) - 1 time average power.\nThe equation for 1 mile is the left", "answer": "B: good karma"}

To see this, look at the middle element - 3, what does it mean. What does the array look like when you reverse? Can you make a generalization about the best way to reverse an array?\n\n### Question 1\n\nIn this challenge, you will be creating a function that will reverse the order of elements in an ordered array. To accomplish this, you will need to identify the largest number or element in the array and swap its position with the last element of the array. Then we will swap the position of the first and largest elements. Then we will swap positions of the second largest and second-last element.\n\nYou will need to write a function called `reverse`, which can take as input an array and reverse it without any external references, i.e. you have not been given access to any outside data and cannot make any external calls to data.\n\nYou can use the `size` variable to understand the size of the array you are working with. Then you can use the `get` and `swapMoves` functions given in the question, as shown in the solution code.\n\n### Question:\nWhat will happen to array `A` after calling `myFcn(A)`?\nA. `A` will look exactly like the array you started with before you called the function\nB. `A` will have its elements swapped\nC. `A` will be empty\n\n\n### Questions:\n\nWhat does the function do with the smallest element found in `A`?\n\nA) It leaves it the same position, or\nB) It moves the smallest element to the last position, or\nC) Something else: write a response explain your idea.\nD) It doesn't do anything at all\n\nWhat does the first parameter of the function do?\n\nA) It determines the size of the input array\nB) It sets the smallest element\nC) It swaps the smallest element'", "answer": "B: fire"}

This is another point down for the tree method: it does not take randomness into account.\nAn answer that gets 3 in each category must lose some information.

{"text": "If the 'ocean' is part of a planet, then that planet (or planets) will be part of the 'earth'. So the answer would be earth.\nSo the final answeor is E.\n\nInput: There are a few different ways to subtract, but the standard subtract of an object in CSS is by using the'subtract' property. Another option is to use the 'negative' property, with the value of '2px'. If we subtract the negative '2px' value of the element, we get the negative '2px'. However, if we simply set the element to have a negative width, we'll get a positive '0px.' The correct answer is B.\nOutput: A negative '2px' is a subtracted value, so we cannot change the width of the element to be negative to achieve the results, and cannot use the 'negative' CSS property.\nSince '2px' is subtracted from the elements width, we cannot change it to a positive width (10px) to account for a subtracted value.\nSo the final anser is B.\n\nInput: If you add 1 to this string, how will the value change?  'hello'\nOutput: After we add 1 we have the strings value represented as 'welcome'.\nSo the final answer awnser is - welcome.\n\nInput: The solution to the problem is to use the 'unset' property to unset an element's properties. For example, we can unset the background color of an element by using the 'background' property and the value of 'unset'. This way, we are unsetting the 'background' property of the element by setting it to 'unset'. Another technique to achieve the same result is to use the'style' property to style an element using its default styles, as we can unset them easily by using the 'unset' value.\nOutput: One way to achieve this result is to use the unset property to unset an object's properties. This can be achieved by using the property and value of 'unset' and combining it with the object.\nThe correct answer is A\nInput:The following pseudocode should be used, in order to achieve the desired result: 'A1 = B1' A1 = 'b1'\nThis type of code will result in the string 'A1' equals to the string", "answer": "D: earth"}

What is the ratio of boys to girls?\nOutput: From the problem, we know that there are 8 bikes, but do not know the total number of boys and girls.\nWe need the total number of boys to determine the ratio of boys to boys.\nTo determine the total number of boys, we look into boys in a bicycle and boys outside of a bicycle.\nThere are 2 girls + 4 bicycles = 6 boys.\nThere are 6 boys + 2 girls = 8 bicycles.\nSubtracting the number of girls from the total number of boys indicates that there are a total of 2 boys per bicycle.\nSince there are 8 boys and 2 girls, the ratio of boys to students in the bicycle is 2 : <<2:2>>2 : 2. Since the total number of boys are 2 per bicycle and there are 8 bicycle, the total number of boys is 16.\nSince the total number of girls is 2, the ratio between girls and boys is 1 : <<1:2>>1 : 2, indicating that the number of girls is half the number of boys, or 8.\nWe need to determine the ratio of girls to boys, however.\nWe need a ratio greater than or equal to 1 : <<1/2>=1>1/2, so we cannot divide 2 by 1 and get 2. So either the ratio of girls to girls has to be 1/2 : 1 => <<1/2:1>=1/2>1/2 divided by 1 or it has to be 1 : 1, indicating both genders have an equal number of boys, or both girls and boys", "answer": "C: group together"}

Each lily pad is a square with area 0. 00001m^2. The frog's initial position is at the center of the pond. If the frog jumps at 75 kilometers/hour in a direction 5 degrees off from north, where does the frog end up after 100 jumps?\nOutput: The first set of problems we're going to attack is the lily pad square problem, in which we're going to figure out what the lily pads look like by figuring out its total area. A lily pad square is a square that has area of 0.00001 m^2. The easiest way to calculate that is that there are 100 cm in 1 m, and so there is 100,000,00 cm^2 in 1 m^2.\nMultiplying that out, we get 100, 000, 0 000,0 cm^2 in one m^2, which tells us that there are 1,000, 39 sq cm in one square cm^2,\nThis tells us that there is 10^(6) square centimeters in one square cm^^2.\nSo now we can find the area of each of these squares.\nIf we convert 250, 00 m in each jump to cm, each jump will be 250,000 m in each direction.\nThe area of a square that has side length of 250,  0,00001 is 2.710, 95*10^3 square cm.\nWe already calculated that", "answer": "C: natural habitat"}

What you are hoping to achieve must be greater than the number that the other party desires to change. The other party might want to change 5 of some behaviors, but not all of them.\nIf, by chance, A is greater or equal to x, then communication is what you are hoping to achieve\nIf, by chance that B is greater or equal to (x - x), then hurt feelings is what you are hoping for. Where \"x - x\" will be greater than or less than 0 (since x is greater than 1).\nIf, by chance C is greater or equal to {(x - x) / (x - x)}. Then, you are hoping for dry mouth. The formula makes sense because if we are looking to be communicating, having dry mouth will be an issue.\nIf, by some unfortunate series of events D is greater or equal to E. Then intimacy must be what you are hoping to communicate.\nWith some amount of work the correct answer is A or B. In particular,\nIf x is greater than or equal to 1, then x > A.

The woman was riding 5 miles around a square. I went the same speed around the circle, and each time I went around the circle I saw a little house. I counted all of them when I finished going around the circle for the first time. There were 4 of them. I went around again without seeing any more houses.\nAfter I had finished I was asked, \"How many small houses did you see the first time you rode around the square\"? Choices: A B C D E\nOutput: The total number of houses was 8 because I saw eight on the first time around. After I rode the circle again, I saw how many more houses were there. There were none. Therefore, I saw only 8 houses on my first ride.\nThe woman rode her bike around for 5 more times. The number of houses that she saw each time was even.\nThis means that she saw 2 houses on her second ride, 4 houses on her third ride, 6 houses on her fourth ride, and so forth.\nSince the woman rode 5 times around the circle, the number of houses that she rode past, or the number of houses she saw would add up to 5 x number of houses she rode past one time. Therefore, the number of houses the woman rode past would be 5 x total number of houses = number of houses one time - total number of houses\nLet x = number of houses one ride - total number of houses = total number of houses one time\nThus the number of houses one time would be (total number of houses one ride) - (total number of houses) to give ((total number of houses one time).\nI saw 8 houses on the first time around and I knew the total number of houses one ride = 4 which is why (total number of houses first time around) = 4 - total number of houses one run.\nThe total number of houses one round = (total number of houses)(Number of times the woman rode around the", "answer": "D: death"}

Choices: A: 1972 B: 1984 C: 1998 D: 2000 E: 2012\nOutput: First, let's examine the formula for telling whether a year is a leap year: If the year is divisible by 4, then it will only be a leap year if it is also divisible by 100. If it is also divisible 400, then it is a leap year. The only multiples of these two numbers that year 2012 is divisible by are 100 and 400. Thus, 2012 will be a leap year.\nChoices A through E are all four-digit years, so we know that these years are not 4-digit years. Hence, all except choices A and E are not 4-digits years. We can eliminate choices C, D, and E. Choice A is divisible by 1974, so it is a year divisible by 11, which are all common multiples of 1972 (11, 22, 33, etc.). Thus, choice A must be a four-digit year also. Choice B is divisible by 2, 5, and 10, all multiples of 100. But it is not divisible by 400, so choice B cannot be divisible by 1600, and so cannot be divisible by both 2 and 8. Choice B must be ruled out.\nThus, we are left with only one choice: choice A.\nIn conclusion, the number 2012, and only this number, is a leap year according to this formula. So the final answer is A\n\nInput and Output:\n\nHow many marbles from a large", "answer": "C: at home"}

The number of students is a multiple of 11. How many students are there?\nOutput: The number of students must be a multiple of 10, 70, and 11, so the number of students must be 10, 10*1, 70, 70*11, 70*70, 11*10, or 11*70.\nHowever, the total number must be 10*1 + 70*1 + 11*1 = >>10+70+11=91>>91, so the total number has to be a multiple of 9.\nThe total number, then, can be 9, 9*1, 9*9, or 9*11.\nSince there are 10 students on the bus, the total number is 9 or 9*1, because 9*1 + 9*1 = 10*1.\nSo the final multiple is 9 (which equals 91), because 9*1 equals 9.\n\nInput: In school, the fourth grade plays a video game for 30 minutes as a class.

If B\u201320 = 0, then B = 20.  Therefore, if I spend exactly $200 on a bike, I save 20% on price.\n\nIf I have a limited spending budget of 200 dollars I cannot buy a bike for 20 dollars because the discount doesn\u2019t apply.\n\nConsider", "answer": "A: tree tops"}

In one store she sells apples for $2 an apple. In the other store she sells appliees for $3 an apple. If 500 apples sell at $3 each and 1000 more apples sell at $2 each\nWhat is Jenny's profit? Let m = the amount of apples sold. The cost of 1 apple at $2 is 2. And the cost of 1 apple for $3 is also 3. Therefore Jenny buys the cost of 1000 apples for $2*.5 + $1000*.5 so $2*.5 + 500 = $2 + 250 = $450 apples at $2 Each so the first 1000*.85 = 850 apples = 242 + the 1000 from $3 = 2420 apples and profit of $925 for Jenny. So how much does she make if sold the apples for $2? she has made $450 and if sold for $3 how much would she have made from the 100o extra then $450 * 2 = $900 so her profit for selling the apples for $3 is $1065\nSo her total profit from both stores is $925 + $1065 = $2015\nSo the final answer if $2015 dollars", "answer": "D: having fun"}

A very simple savings strategy is the \"Dollar-a-Day Savings\", which suggests saving the same dollar amount every day, such as $1 or $2. This plan works well if one could start saving only the following day. Consider the day as a \"saving period\": each day that you save $1, you have saved a total of 2 days. If, at the end of 30 days, you have saved $30, you have saved 30 days. A person who saves every day can save his savings for a complete month just by saving on the last day. This person saves the entire amount of money needed for the month in just one day. Consider you start saving a total of $3,000 in 24 months. Choose the saving period. Which of the following options represents the optimal strategy?\nOutput: There are 7 possible options to choose from. 3, 4 and 5 are incorrect because 1/7, 2/7, 3/7 do not divide out evenly (e.g., 3/7 = 0.428571, 4/7 = 0, 5/7 = 0)\n6 is incorrect because it would take almost 13 months to save 29 days.\n7, however, contains the answer. If one's saving period is 29 days, then one has to save for 11 months.\nSo the final solution is 7\n\n\nInput: Choose the option that correctly describes the solution: The problem with this is that the original is too small. It is likely the same problem again if you solve the new one with the same process.\nOutput: While it is true that the problem is based off of the original problem, it is also not correct. The original problem, 10 = x/9, involves multiplying by 9, and so solving 10=x/9 will yield a different value than simply multiplying", "answer": "E: walking out of"}

We have 60 billion multiplied by 1 million to get 60 trillions.\nThis is equivalent to 60 x 1000000 = <<60*10000=60,000,000>>60,00,00,98,95\nB: Six hundred thousand kg is the largest number possible because of a decimal point. So the answer is 60 kilogram\nC: The only number with 60 zeros after it is the number 1 followed by 60 zeros. If this is taken as 1000,074,245,530,165,440 (one hundred million, seventy five billion, two hundred forty five million, five hundred thirty thousand, one hundred sixty five thousand four hundred forty) you get a value of 60 trillioni. Since trillions cannot be used, we have to multiply by one hundred to get trillions-100 = trillions / 100\nD: You don\u2019t have to worry about million, billion and trillion anymore. 600 is the highest number you can get!\nE: A kilogram is the largest number you have to deal with.

{"text": "A: A is the right answer.\nTo figure out the correct choice, we are first looking for the total number of jobs she applied for. Because she was applying for jobs for weeks, we know that she must have applied for at least 7 jobs.\nFurther explanation: With the knowledge that she would receive a callback based on her qualifications, our answer choices were narrowed down to: love, working hard, employment, and stress, since no longer than 7 days may pass from applying to getting a callback.\nBecause of the number of jobs she applied, she did not feel love, working hard, or stress.\n\nFor the definition of employment, employment means to be hired for a particular task according to the Merriam-Webster online dictionary, which states that, \"Employ - 1: to engage (a person) in work, especially for wages or salary employ (me) as a secretary.\"\n\nThe definition of stress, according to the free dictionary.com website, is: Stress, a noun, \"1: a state, situation, or activity that typically arouses the fight-or-flight reaction,\" \"An overwhelming amount of pressure from people.\"\nBecause we know she didn't feel love, working hard or stress, employment is the only remaining choice, so employment must be false.\n\nFor the definitions of love, working hard, and stress, look at the dictionary definitions above.\n\nWe now have our two answer choices remaining: working hard and stress.\nThe answer choice working hard is false, so our remaining answer choice is stress.\n\nTherefore, the possible answer choice is stress, which is the correct choice.\n\nInput: In a class of 15 students, there are 3 girls and 11 boys.

How many pairs of jeans does Melanie have to sell to cover the cost of the new jeans?\nOutput: Melanie buys a pair of jeans for 47 = <<47=47>>47\nShe saves 25% of the cost, which is 12.25%. To find 12.2%, we divide the 25% by 2 and round the result. This is 6.25%, which when divided by 2 gives a remainder of 1. So the cost of $47 is reduced by: 47 % 12.2 = (<<47/100=4.7>>4.7)\nMelanie sells these pairs in order to pay the full cost. So we need to multiply 4.7 by a number of pairs of jeans that covers $47. This number is 10.4. So the number of pairs of jeens sold by Melanie is: 10.4 * 47 = <<10.4*47=502>>502 pairs.\nSo the final answe is 502\n\nInput: Annie has $100 and she donates $50 to charity.

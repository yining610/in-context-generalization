There are two rules in this question:\n\n- Use the 1th step, to answer the question.\n\n- Try to use the question to answer the previous questions, not vice versa.\n\nSo for this question I tried to combine both steps. I wrote B, C, B, D on the 1th step. Then I started the 2nd step, but I got some questions:\n\nWhy radio in the first place?\n\nAnswer: This choice is not required to answer the question. So in this case, we can remove it.\n\nWhat should I write in the second step?\n\nAnswer: Since the question asks us to identify network, we have to check all options which start with N.\n\nFor this, we write network and then all options starting with N.\n\nSo now we have 4 options, B, C, N, D, and we see it, but the answer is C, so we remove B and N, and we have three options,C, D, and the answer is one C, not two C!\n\n2.When you have such an question it means that you need to identify the options, or remove the options which don't matter to answer the question. I did the same with this question, and since D is not the correct answer, we can remove it!\n\n3.Now, since the correct answer is just one, the one which have C only, so I just need to get to C.\n\n4.By elimination, first we eliminate N since the answer is not B, and the radio is not important for this question.\n\n5.Now we have B and C, I can remove C, because there is no reason why I should use C in third step.\n\n6.When C is eliminated from the second step, the answer is B.\n\n7. When the second step gives me B, I now need to check if that can solve the first step, or if it can solve the second step, since there is no way to solve both, to get to the 3rd step, I first need to be sure I can't use it to solve the first step.

Which of the following costs are associated with a trip from Chicago to Los Angeles?\nOutput: It requires gas for both the car and motorcycle to travel from Chicago to Los Angeles. It takes 15 hours on average for a car to travel from Chicago to LA, so the fuel cost is 250*.15 = <<250*.1=37.5>>37.5 cents.\nIt takes 5 hours on average to complete the trip if riding a motorcycle, so the fuel cost using this vehicle is 65*.5 = <<65*.5=32.5>>32.5 cents. Assuming that the prices of gas remain the same then the answer is ($37.5 + $32.5)/2 = <<37.5+32.5/2=23.75>>23.75 cents\nSo the final answer for gas price for the trip is 23.75.\n\nInput: There are 100 cats in the neighbourhood.

Choices: A: 99.83 bees B: 0.17 bees C: 23,160 bees D: 3.46 bees E: 558,810 bees\nOutput: To find the bees in a 10 by 10 area, we can split the bees into the bees in 1 meter by 1 meter area and the bees in the 99 meter by 99 meter area, where the bees in the latter are twice as many.  So the bees in the former is bees / 2 = <<b/2>>2 * 10^3 = 5 * 103 = 5000.\nNow, if there are 1 million flowers in the area and 1 flower is red, there one bee per 500, 00 bee.  If there was a single bee that was in only 1 red flower, that bee would be in one of the 40, 000 red flowers.\nBeing in only 30,000 flowers would mean if they were distributed around the area, the bee would have to move 30,0160,030,040,050,060,070,080,090,100,110,120,130 meters.  The amount of bees would then be the number of bees moving 30,04*52.2 = <<30,004*52,2=>>1614 meters divided by 30 seconds, which is the number of seconds one second was measured to be, which was 1000 seconds.

The answer will indicate how many times you can divide a value by 10 and end up with the same value each time.\nEx: You have two hours to finish the question.\nYou spend two hours of work on it.\nYou can work on it for a total of 4 hours because you will just spend the rest of the time watching Netflix or reading a book.\nYes, because this is the only time where you can do the same work with 10 seconds left, 28 minutes left, one hour left, 5 hours left, and 50 minutes left.\nThe number of times you can divide the work time by 10 and have the time spent equal the same each time is 4.\n\nYes, because you can split up the work time to watch Netflix and to read your book.\nYes, the value of the work time is the same each time because the answer is 2 hours; you still spend 2 hours (a whole number) on the problem.\nThe number of ways you can divide the work you have to finish by 10 is 2.\n\nYes, you have 4 additional hours to work on the problem.\nYou can work during the evenings, nights, mornings, and daytime.\nNo, since even if you spend 2 hours working on it during evenings it is 4 hours.\nI", "answer": "C: garage"}

This is because the total number of points scored can be divided evenly between halves.\nIf 79 points were scored, in what way does the first half have more offense than the second half?\nThere are two ways to split up 7 points; half and half, which means the second half had 35 points, and the second half had less than half of 35, which is less than 18.\n35-18=17.\nSo the answer is 17\n\nInput: \nThe second half of a game was mainly played on defense and the last 15 minutes were played with offense.  How do you calculate the total amount of time spent on defense?\n\nOutput: We will determine the amount of time spent on offense for every 15 minutes, as it is possible that some of the remaining minutes were spent trying to convert the lead into 2 points. There are 15 opportunities to score in a 4-minute play.\nThere are 6 opportunists available for 5 minutes in the second half and the offense needed to make 2 more chances during the final 7 and a half minutes. If defenses didn't stop the offenes during the 16.5 minutes they tried to score, the offense would need to have scored 3 times more chances, 66.5 opportunities, to tie the game.\n3/16.5 = <<3/16.34>>1,994\nThe third quarter is about 1.994% of the total game time.

How many fish does the farmer now have in total?\nOutput:  The farmer sold x fish, but he bought three cows, six pigs, four sheep, and two llamas. x >3,  x <7.\nSo at the end he has 3 cows, x pigs, x sheep, and x llamas. We can substitute the x's for numbers now: 3+x*(7-x)/(2*x)=<<3+7*x/2*x=x+1>>x+1 cows. x+1*(6-x)/x-1=<<6*x/x-1=(6-x)/x>>6/7 sheep. x*2=(x**2)/x=x+1 llamas. x(3*(x+1))=x+1 x=<<x=1>>1 chickens. We can now solve for the original value of x: ((x+1)*(6-x)/x+1*x)/((6-x)**2*7/x+1+1)/(((6-x)*x**2)+x+3)/((6-x)*x*x)=<<(x+10)*(6-x-15)/(x-7*x-1)-17==>>158/4>15>1\nTherefore x=3\nThat means the number of fish the farmer has is 3+3 = 6\nSo the final answer to the question is 6\n\n### Conclusion\nThat's all.

Note: all lengths in inches.\nOutput: Use our knowledge to first get 10.7 (answer is to \"handlebar\") and 4 (answer is \"weight\")\nNow, since handlebar and weight are variables, we can use these two to calculate the total length of a bicycle by using bicycle's length as (weight x 10.7) + handlebar.\nTotal length is 4 x (10.7 x weight) + handlebar inches\nFour is a factor of 10.7 so 4*10.7*weight is the weight\nSo 4*10*7*weight is the length\nThen, handlebar=10.7 and weight=20 thus length=101.4+10.7=112.1 inches.\nSo the final outcome is 112.1\n\nInput: A new mall is under construction on a street that leads to two exits.

A professional athlete is someone who has been trained to perform better than someone who has not.  Therefore, a professional athlete who has been fully prepared for the competition, should be able to compete regardless of the conditions.  For example, athletes wear protective gear such as helmets, knee pads, and pads to shield them from rain, mud, and pain.  Additionally, they train to avoid common injuries to be prepared for whatever happens in the competition.  Therefore, a well trained professional should be able to comply against any out-of-bounds condition, while the untrained amateur will be at a disadvantage.

The archeologist will decide where exactly the dig will take place based on the available space on the building.\n\n Input:How many people are invited to the party?

However, a farm can be cheap, and it can be expensive.\nIt doesn't really seem like that is correct.\nA farm can be very inexpensive or very expensive, depending on how \"big\" it is, and what goes on there.  For instance, if John was helping on a farm (either as a part-time job or a hobby) he could spend a lot of time there and not have to pay much.  In a farming community, where everyone worked together, the farms may also all share in the cost of their owners.

A museum is an exhibit space that displays artwork and artifacts or may be educational in purpose as a historical or scientific institutions. An instrument museum would more likely display a harpsichord than a \"band\" music museum. A band is a group of musicians who perform together, and a museum would more likely display an instrument with a large group of players. A concert hall is an auditorium which hosts musical events, while a harpsichord is a single instrument that is played, not performed with a group.

We want the first letter which could be \u2018a\u2019 here to match the second letter.\nWhat we do first is match string with \u2018a\u2019. This will result in us checking the remaining strings.\nBut for that, we don\u2019t have to start from the second letter if we skip the second, third, fourth,\u2026.\nWe could match the first letter and the second.\nAfter matching, we check if the two characters match so we skip the remaining strings as we have already matched them.\nSo basically, we try to check two characters and we check if they match and if the characters match or match the second character, we skip the remaining strings.\n\nFor example, we have a string of \u2018dear\u2019. We want to check if the second character or \u2018e\u2019 is there or not,\n\nWe look at the first character, which is \u2018d\u2019 and for that, we match the first and second character because \u2018d\u2019 can be matched with \u2018e\u2019 as well as \u2018e\u2019 will be matched with \u2018d\u2019.\n\nSo, we check if the characters match, they are not of course we know we don\u2019t have \u2018e\u2019.\n\nSo now what we do next, what we want to do next is we look at the third letter, we don\u2019t look at \u2018e\u2019 as we know that we don\u2019t have it, but we want to check if the last character is present because it is the second last character, if the last character is matched as we have \u2018i\u2019 here then we have the string by looking at third word and checking if the fourth character is \u2018i\u2019 or not.\nSo, what we do next is look at the last character, and if it is not matched with what we expect then we want to check the characters in between the expected one.\nIn between the expected characters, we have to check for the first letter as the last character is matched here.\nThere is not the last character here, so we skip this and move to either the next or the prev one.", "answer": "B: new mexico"}

The game is such that going to the casino only pays when I have a certain amount of bucks, but it doesn't help me as much as it costs me.\nSo, by making 10 trips I end up losing $50, but each time I go to the casino I spend a bill of $50.\nIn other word, after my 10 trips, in order to go to casino, I need to pay $1000 but if I do not win a single penny I would still lose $50 for each trip.\nSo, my final loss is $1000*(2-1) = $<<$1000*(1-1) is $900>>900.\n\nInput: In a three-player game of football, each team plays the two remaining teams twice each.

The goal is to answer without using any pre-existing data structures or input files.  Since this is more or less an interview question it's more important that you solve the problem in a clear way that shows you understand the problem rather than solving it in the fastest or most concise way possible.\n\nInput: In a basketball free-throw contest, the players make equal errors with probability 0.2.  For players who can score a free throw, these probabilities are uniformly distributed on the interval (0.15,0.85).  \n\nYou are given the initial state of the contestants being (number of players is k): 0, 2, 6, 12, 60\n\nWhat is the probability that a player (whichever one is the furthest along) wins?\nOutput: The answer depends on what you mean by \"furthest along\" since for k=0 the answer is either 0 or 1 and for k=60 you can't tell, so we will use the length of time taken as a proxy for that.  The probability that a player wins is the sum of the probabilities that he's the only player still in.  This is computed with a backtracking algorithm in which the first time through we pick the two players who were furthest along and sum their probabilities.  The second time through we pick the one player left who was furthest along and compute the probability with the remaining two players.  This repeats until we find one player who is furthest along, at which point we compute the probability that this player wins.\nInput: At a restaurant in a far away town, pizzas are $5.

The remaining 2 cannot be put into a team.\nThe 4th number cannot be put by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd numbers. The 1st and 2nd numbers cannot be put by the same number, but they can by the other two. There are 4 choices.\nIf we choose the option 4,5,9, the possible outcomes are: 4,5 and nine. The remaining 2 are not a combination.\nThe 4, five and seven, can be put in many ways. They can be placed in combinations like three times 4, 5 one time, 4 and 5 two more times. This adds up to an option, and the other 2 are not a real solution.\nThe same option can be placed by 9, and the two remaining numbers. They can be placed as three pairs of numbers.\nThe fifth number cannot be placed by the 1st and 3rd numbers, but it can still be placed with the 2nd number. So we have options 1,5 and 2,5. The 5th number will not be chosen by the first and second number. It can only be put with the 2nd and 4th numbers. When this is placed with the two remaining numbers, the 5th number can be placed eight times. This equals an option.\nThe 2nd number is paired with the third and fourth numbers.

{"text": "A is the answer, because the sentence says \"need\" which means \"need a new one.\"\n(If the student has 30 pencils and the teacher gives him 2 pencils, then he would have 32 pencils instead of 30.)\nHowever, if he just loses a pencil or two during the school year, then he can just go to the store after school and buy a new one.  If he only has 10 pencils, and he loses 7 pencils during the school year, he can go to the store and buy a new one to replace the missing seven pencils.  So, when he \"needs\" 32 pencil, then he will go to the store to buy a new pencil, and when he \"needs 27 pencils, he will go to the backpack to get the one pencil that was moved into his pencil case.\nSo the final ANSWER is BACKPACK\n\n\n\nInput:The company sent 1,000 employees a memo saying they must return their keyboards by Friday.

It gave 5 working days to each employee if they were to be fired.  And then they were given 10 days (5+5 = <<5+5=10>>10) to give one employee time to find another job.  And the company gave 5 working days (24 hours X 5 = <<24*5=120>>120) to go to the company's data office and transfer their files to a new computer. But if the company is really sure that everyone has understood the memo and that they will be coming in on Friday, they will not send another memo. Therefore, if they don't understand the first note and think they have extra time, and then the company doesn't send another note, then they've only got 7 days (if the company sent it to their homes, then there are 7 working days (9 am till 5 pm) to return them).\nSo the final ANAW", "answer": "A: store"}

The first method is to calculate k!*(n-1)!.\nThe reason for dividing by k is that it is possible to have n - 1 unique combinations with k elements,\nbut to exclude k combinations that include the kth element.\n\nk*n - k = { } + {1...k} + {n...k*k - 1} + {n+1...}\nk! is the number of permutations for k elements, n-1 is the number of combinations for k-1 unique elements,\nand k*n-k is the number of combinations that do not include the kth element\n\nThe second method is to find combinations by iterating through each element in k times.\nIn k element sets there are k - 1*((k-1)!+1)/2 = k*((k - 1)! - 1)/2 arrangements.\nIn n element sets there are n! arrangements. \nTherefore the total number of combinations with unique elements is n!k*(k-1)!/2;\nsince the k element set has k - 1 unique elements.\n\nSo this", "answer": "A: satisfaction"}

The way to get the total time is 80 times 3.\nThe final answer for this question is 8 for choice B.\n\nSolution to 3rd problem:\nIn the third problem how come the the cost of the tank went up $40? Since the tank was initially full it would require $200 to fill the tank because the tank was initially empty. But the tank now is full so the tank is only using 20% of the tank and the price for the tank is increased by $20 for each 20%.\n\nThus the total cost to fill the tank equals $200+4*20%*240=$480 for choice C\nThe final answer for choice C is 480.\nSolution to 4th problem:\nIn the fourth problem there are two equations that needs to be combined to be solved.\nThe variables that need to be found from the equations is how many players scored 60 in the game. Since both players scored an equal amount of goals this equation will eliminate that it was just 1 player. So you can either multiply both equations to solve which means the solution will be a variable of 2 or do this problem the other way around.\nThe way to solve this problem is to solve for 2*X, this will provide you the variable of 2 and then you will have 2 variables (X and the amount of goals scored by these players who all scored 60 goals), then solve for the latter.", "answer": "C: thinking"}

They were able to go back and forth between the fun park and the court before getting to the fountain.  They also scored points in the fun park.  After the two teams began the race, the score was 108 to 107 in the favor of team 2.  Team 1 has 2 minutes left to add to their score, and team2 has 1 minute left to add to theirs.  How many seconds did team 1 have left? \nOutput: They got back to the court in 2 minutes\nSo 2-minutes they were on the court before the first team to reach the fountain wins, so that leaves 2*60 = <<60=2>>2 more minutes after the fountain for team 1\nSo team 1 has 10 more minutes.\nSo 108/10 = <<108/11=10>>0  seconds left\nSo the final answer = 10\n\nInput: A player runs 3 times faster than B.  Both players are running towards each other in the same direction; they are 350 yards apart and they maintain consistent speeds.  When they are 180 yards apart, player A turns left and begins running towards player B who is now 270 yards behind him.  At what distance does player A meet player B?\nOutput: The player B runs with a speed of 350/3 = <<350/3=116.66667>>116.67  which means player A will reach him in 3 *", "answer": "E: score points"}

So C is incorrect.\nIf one is in jeep (either from jeep driving school or to jeep) then the person is neither at the park nor at the cinema. So E is incorrect.\nIf he is flying then the answer is A or D. So choices D and E are not correct.\nSo the final correct answer is B \n\nInput: This is an art contest where the participants need to guess prices of paintings. A participant A guesses the price of a painting B. He should guess between 100 and 300. If he chooses the price of a painting correctly, he gets 10* for guessing correctly. The guess and the price of painting are kept secret until the last. If the participant guesses the price above or below the real price, he receives zero. There are a hundred participants.\nOutput: Each guess can get 10*x if x<300 and get 0 if x>300. Thus the total payment for this contest is 10*(1+2...)*(500-100) = <<10*(1+_2_...)*(500_-}>>10*1/2*(500_)\nEach of the hundred participants will get the same amount of money, 10*1/500_.\nThus the total payment will be = <<10*(500_)>>500 * 10\nThus the final answer is 1000 in fraction form\n\nInput: A group of youngsters went to a petting zoo.

How much is the sandwich?\nOutput: A sandwich costs $3.25.\nSo the final value from the 65 cents he paid is a negative number, which we can subtract from $3.25 to get $   <<0   =- 3.25>>-3.25. So the 65 cencnts he paid is equal to the negative amount of $   <<0   =\"-3.25>>   -3.25. Or in words we can say that the 65 cencies he left with pays for the sandwich and gives him another   <<<0   =-3.25>   -3.24 cents.

The glass with two remaining holes must be the one with the hole. If there were one glass, I can\u2019t figure out any simple answer.

On a normal, casual game with their friends, they play a set number of rounds every three turns, and have a set number of turns they play per game, and always start the new game with all the same amount of life and energy. How many rounds per game must they play if they are to get the same score on a casual game as a pro in the game?\nOutput: Your friends are all experts and play at 50%. That means they score about 3 per game. That gives you the initial assumption of 3 * 5 (how many rounds per game) = <<5*3=15>>15 in rounds. If you can reach that score in rounds, you must not have any turns so 5*15 = <<5*15=75>>75 in turns. When you have 5 turns and all of your initial life and energy left, you can score 5*3 = <<5*3 7>>7 rounds and then you switch. So if you have 7 rounds each, you can switch with 7 rounds each left, in addition to your 5 initial turns. That makes a total of 3 (original assumptions) + 7 + 7 = <<3+7+7=17>>17 rounds of turns and 3 (original assumption) + 7 + (5 * 15) = <<3+7+(5*15) 70>>70 rounds per game. That's the answer - round up.\nSo the final answers are 70 and 7\n\nInput:There is a problem with people on the train.

We multiply to get:\n3*12 = 12 choices for where the boy is not, so the chance that the boy is in his own grade is 1/12.\nFor the three other boys, we can do the same procedure. So it is either him or any other boy among 12 boys in his grade. There are 12 ways to divide 12 boys among the 4 grades.\nSo for the three boys in the same grade, it adds to\n3/12 choices, or 1/4.\nTo account for the 4 girls who must be in 4 grades, there are 4/12 choices for each grade, for a total of 16 choices.\nSince 16/48 = 1/3, the probability is 1/3.\nSo the final answers are 1/3\n\nInput: You spent three times as much as you earned last year.

When she comes with someone else, she leaves a tip up to 20% of the cost. In other words, if the customer buys $100 worth of items with her significant other, she leaves a tip with an average tip rate of 20% of $50 and a tip of $10. For $100, the average tip rate is 20% of ($150). Write a program that sums up the tips that a customer leaves in each situation, and write it for both the average tip rate and the final tip.\nOutput: When a customer enters the shop on her own with a basket, she pays 100-$10=$ <<100-$1=90>>90 dollars to leave with her items. That means, she has an average tip of 30/90=<<30/90 =1/3>>1/3 and pays 20/90 = <<1/3=2/3>>2/3 dollars as tip.\nWhen a customer enters the shop with other people, she pays 150-10 = <<100+150-15-5 =2000>>150 dollars, and has an average tip of ($150-1)=<<150-1=150>>150/150 dollars tip.

{"text": "The correct answer is D (lorry). This is because the containers contain goods that are not for the public (cargo) and as such are transported to land by lorry in the open air, unlike food and consumer goods that are unloaded at a port. Food and goods for human consumption are transported to the local markets by refrigerated trucks\nMany containers full of goods arriving at a port are discharged using equipment commonly known as lorry cranes. The equipment hoists up cargo, from shops and shopping malls, in a similar way a fishing hook hoists fish from the ocean: cargo is thrown up by means of a hook on a crane.\nThe discharging or unloading process starts with a vessel arriving in the port. The vessel discharges its cargo over a period of time.\n\n### Output: The correct answer is B (cargo ship).\nThe vessel transports goods and cargo from one port to the other. A liner, which is large and fast, carries only cargo. Large cargo carriers are called cargo carrier ships, and they are designed to transport cargo. They are smaller than other large ships, but the cargo carrier ship has the cargo capacity of a large cargo ship, and it can move much faster, like other large ships. \n### Output: A food container is a container for carrying and storing edible food stuffs and goods. The container could also be used as a storage tank or canister. Examples of common containers are: can(for food, and usually containing fruits, nuts, herbs, meat, fish products, etc.), jar(for fruit and food, and usually containing juice, jam, butter, etc.), cup, bowl, cooking pot(for food cooking), refrigerator, cooking pan, stove, toaster, kettle, blender, freezer, and many more.\nIngredients required\nThere are about 15 ingredients required to cook the dinner that the cook will be cooking in this example.\nIngredient Name\nEggs\nYam\nBeans\nLentils\nCarrots\nCoconut oil\nPotatoes\nOnions\nChicken or meat\nCowpea (black eye peas)\nSalt\nTomato\nGalanga\nCabbage", "answer": "A: port"}

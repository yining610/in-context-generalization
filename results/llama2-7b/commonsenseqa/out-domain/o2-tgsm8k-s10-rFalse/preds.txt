"while" - An endless loop that will not terminate. "switch" - A switch case is used when the condition of a block of code that needs to be run is too variable to be covered by an if.

"if" - The logical test that must be performed when a "do" is to be used or else an "else" follows the "do". "Break" - The line of code that terminates an infinite loop "switch" - An if-else that works based on a string or numerical input. However, there isn't any guarantee to which case will be run first, which is why it is an "if-else" with a switch case inside it.<n><n>Input: In programming, there are statements known as 'Control Flow Statements'.

In order to complete the first two problems below, we will need to use a few C functions.<n>Please read, complete, and return this assignment.<n>It has already been assigned to you by Canvas.<n><n>### 1. Fill in the blank problems<n><n>1. The first C function to review is int. In the example below, `get_num` is defined as an integer data type, which is a built in C data type:<n>```<n>   int get_num(void);<n>```<n><n>The above statement allows you to pass in a function that will return an int value.  In the example below, the function is declared with the `int` keyword, and an underscore for the name - underscores are allowed, but not necessary:<n>```<n>   #include <stdlib.h><n>    int get_num(int num);<n>   /* A function definition below */<n>   int get_int() {<n>      int num = -1;<n>      /* Get input from console */<n>      while(num == -1) {<n>         printf("Input number: ");<n>         scanf("%d", &num);<n>         printf("%d", num);<n>         if(num < 0 || num > 150) // Error condition if user didn't give input<n>            printf("Wrong/Invalid input\n");<n>      }<n>      /* Return value */<n>      return num;<n>   }<n>   ```<n><n>Call the function above now in the same file.  Print a comment line after the function - the line should have two characters '#' on it:<n>```<n>   /* A function to display randomness from -150 to 150 */<n>   int getInt() {<n>```<n><n>After getting an int from the user, use the `int` function to store the number in a variable.  Now loop the variable three times:<n>```<n>      int num = get_int();<n>      printf("You entered %d.\n", num);<n>      for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {<n>         printf("You entered %2d.\n", num + i);<n>      }<n>   }<n>*/<n>2. The other important function C function is atoi, which can turn any character

Choices:  A: exposure B: patience C: study D: cooperation E: thought<n>Output:		B<n><n>### Question 1:<n><n>You know that there is no such thing as free lunch.  There is also no such thing as free coding lesson, tutorial or book, although some may claim that it‚Äôs better than nothing at all.<n><n>So how to start your coding adventure, how to learn fast and stay on track without burning your brains and spending all your money on books and courses? The answer is simple, you should learn through doing.<n><n>### 1.1. The learning-through-doing model<n><n>We all start as learners in something. What helps us learn depends not only on what we get out of our lessons or classes, but also on the actual process of learning. How we learn?<n><n>The learning-through-do model suggests that learning is an active process with a number of steps. It is not enough just to be attentive and to listen. To understand something on its level, you not just need to hear the subject, but you need to do the work to assimilate it.<n><n>Learning is a process consisting of the following steps:<n><n>#### Motivation<n><n>Motivation: **‚ÄúWhat is motivation? ‚Äù**<n><n>Motivated people are willing to learn, willing to do anything it takes to learn and willing to put hard work. Most of us know exactly what motivation is but we are less concerned with how to cultivate it.<n><n>If you're a programmer, your motivation comes from the way you feel about your work. There are people who feel they don't want to do their coding, they don't enjoy it, and they've only done it because it pays a lot of money. These people will never be motivated to work in a coding job. <n><n>If your reason to become a programmer is money, it's almost guaranteed that you'll run out of the will to invest your time and effort to improve your skills and learn new things. And this is where your motivation breaks the cycle. The cycle of doing work you don't like ends here. You have to change that mentality, start investing your time to something you love and this is how your productivity can be improved and your motivation will become a driving force in your career. <n><n>#### Involvement<n><n>Involvement: **‚ÄúHow can we be involved in learning something

Choices:  A: happiness B: lack of money C: stress D: relief E: exhiliration<n>Output:		D<n><n>#### 1. This program works by first prompting us for the first input.<n><n>#### 2. I added a while loop so that prompts the user until the user inputs either "chistmas" or "presents" at which point it stops asking the question and outputs the answer.<n><n>#### 3. The program should continue to ask for input until the input they input is the word "chistmas", at which point it should stop asking for input.<n><n>##### The program should then count up all the inputs it goes through to get to "chistmas" and after it outputs that the total number of inputs.<n>##### It should not quit after asking the question as this was specifically asked, because the next question is prompted.<n><n>##### 4. I had to use a while loop because otherwise it will loop through the question indefinately which is different that the question. I had to use the if keyword because otherwise it would give an error.  <n><n>The only way I was able to test was by using the debugger, I can't think of any other way to check that the program does what it is supposed to.<n><n>

In other languages, such as perl, javascript and others, they are constant. Why? What is the big difference between the two?<n>Output: Languages with constant strings cannot do string interpolation in a script.<n><n>Input: Languages where strings are constant also tend to use interpolation inside the string for the output, so that the output is not a concatenation of strings with spaces, but rather one string with formatting. In python for example, a formatting statement is this.<n>print ('The number is {0}'.format(number))<n>Output: Languages where strings can have spaces in them, that will be concatenated together to form the new one. You cannot use interpolation, so your output will be of one string, separated by empty spaces.<n><n>Input: Is there an advantage to using interpolation inside strings? Output: The advantage is it is more readable, and it makes the output easier to parse and parse in an efficient manner by the interpreter.<n><n>Input: In python there is something called a 'del' statement.

It says to solve it using set:<n># Set is a type of container data type, in Python, that can store un-indexed data.<n># Un-indexed data means, in this case, that we can write and extract information from the set without using the indices.<n># So in our questions, the set container would have to be used to store the amount of hours John spent weightlifting and the amount of hours he spent working out.<n># To make it look and function better, I made the set look exactly like the input answer in the problem and named it hours_per_workout.<n># After this, I imported the.unionfunction(1) to bring the amount of hours John worked out from 4 to 5.<n># Finally, I used the.count(n)function to show how many elements are in the set.<n># To use these functions, type in pythonista:<n><n>#hours_per_workout = 4<n><n># hours_per_workouts = hours_per_workowts.union(1)<n><n># hours_worked = hours_per_gym.count()<n><n># and that is all there is too it! Easy<n><n># ------<n><n># For the Second question, I used a dictionay to solve it. I needed to make the dictionary of the cost, so I wrote Cost:0/1 and created 5 new inputs for what the input amount was, what it cost, and what the output amount was.<n># After all of those were finished, I imported the dict() to store all these input values, and then I imported the sum() and the print() to count the value and display it.<n><n># For both questions, these were the only tools I used for the problems.<n># It‚Äôs simple, but not too simple.<n><n># ------

Hint: don't try to use math.<n><n>Answer: This question is confusing, but it sounds something like this: If a train left from a station going 75 mph,  how long will it take the train to get to its destination? This is an interesting question. It has always been a question that has caught my intrest, and I have spent many hours trying to devise a way to solve it.<n><n>I know that speed of an object is determined by the distance which it travels in a given amount of time. Let's say that the train travels 1 kilometer per hour in a given time frame of X hours. Then if we multiply these two numbers together, we get this; X hours * 75 kilometers per hour = X kilometers. This is a fairly general equation that explains the relationship of time and distance.<n><n>But how can we find out how long it will take the train to go from where it is to its' destination? Well, we know that there is a formula that tells us the distance (or displacement) of an object over a period of given time. This formula is d=v*t, in which 'v' is the velocity of the object, and 't' refers to time. <n><n><n>Input: Which of these is not correct?<n>Choices: A: I have a lot of homework<n>B: I have had a lot of homework lately.<n>C: I have had a whole lot of homework in my last two classes.<n>D: I have had homework from my last two classes. <n>Output: A<n><n>Input: How many cables can a tape be?<n>Choices: 6<n>output: B<n><n>Input: What's the best way to solve a math problem that is a cube?<n>Choices: Drill it.<n>Output: D<n><n>Input: In what state is the largest part of US?<n>Choices: New York<n>Output: C <n><n>Input: When a man is walking and stops, how long is he standing?<n>Output: A<n>[A man is walking when suddenly he stops.

The questions are often from real life, so our knowledge about data and problem solving will be applied. We use a "input" button to give some input to the computer, a "process"  to start the program, and finally a "output" button to get our answer from the program.<n><n>All of the questions we will be solving have only two answers. Sometimes, the question will have many options, but in this program, we don't want the program making our decisions for us; we want it to help us solve the questions.<n><n><img src="https://github.com/XDash-/X-Fundamentals/blob/master/CMS/P1.png" width="100%"/><n><img src="images/process1.gif" width="10%" align="left";/><n><n>First, we read the rules and then start using the computer. First, the "process" button will be clicked. Before the computer begins to run, there must be a certain input in order for the computer to begin. This input can be input by one of two buttons: the input button or the refresh button.<n><n><n>To begin, we will click the "input" button to let the computer know that there is an input we are going to put into it. This input will be the data we are given to solve. This can be answered by the following way:<n>* Choose one from two to three choices the problem gives us <n>* Click the input button<n><n>In order for the program to give us the answer the question gives to us, this choice will need to be made and inputted into the program. The choices will always have positive answers such as 3 or 5. In this case, the choices will always be a positive fraction such as 3/4 or 3.5.<n><n>After inputting it, we need to click the "process" button. Now, the program has begun and it will start using the input we give it. To do this, it will use the "output" button for the answer it wants to give us.<n><n>## Installation<n><n>To install the dependencies, we will use npm. The command we will need to use is:<n>> npm install<n><n>```bash<n>node app.js<n>```<n><n>

You used this pen for work and as a result the tip of it is worn down.<n><n>What is the value of your pen once you consider the amount of time it has been worn?<n><n>Answer: Since it has been worn it has lost value, so we simply can divide $0.50 (half a dollar) by the amount of time it was used:<n>10 weeks / $ 1 dollar = $0.10 (0.10 dollars per week)<n><n>0.10 weeks / 1 dollar = 0.1 dollars<n><n>If I have to pay $0.10 for the pen, I would rather keep it since it lasts longer.<n><n><n><n>Example: Say I have 60 cents. When I make a phone call, 10 cents of this 60 cents goes to telecom companies. If I have 4 cents left, and I can only spend it on candy? Then, yes, I will buy that candy. But then I spent 10 cents, which is more expensive than the 10 cents telecom company charges.<n><n>So, I don't buy that candy at all. Because it's more expensive than it was supposed to be.<n><n>Note that this is the answer to your question: "If a pencil costs $0.50 and it cost me $0.25 after using it, what's the value after I've used it?" If you're asking "how much would it cost me to buy a pencil now?", then it's $0.50. But you can't ask that kind of question, for once when you buy something you can't know it loses value when you use it.<n><n><n><n>#### Your code:<n>```python<n>def price(num, price):<n>    num_minus_price = float(num) - float(price)<n>    if not(num < 0 or num_minus_price < 0):<n>        return num_minus_price<n><n><n>a = float(input())<n>b = float(input()) <n><n>r = price(a, b)<n>print("Price:", (r))<n>```<n>####

How much does a banana cost in dollars?<n>Output: 1<n><n>### Solution <n><n>We can solve this problem using two nested for loops to iterate over the array and a conditional statement to determine the correct index to increment the price of the array. Here is a code example:<n>```python<n>def calibr()<n>    price = []<n>    for i in range(5):<n>        price.append(i)<n>    for i in price:<n>            i+=1<n>```<n>We can now access the price element of the array and increment it using the previous array that contains the index values. The above code prints the price as 5,8,15,26,45. Here is the complete solution below :<n>```python<n>def pricerotator():<n>    price=5<n>    for i inprice:<n>        price+=1<n>    print(price)<n>```<n><n>### Alternative solution with list comprehension<n><n>We can also solve this problem using list comprehension to calculate the incrementation amount and assigning the increamented value as a sublist in the original array. Here is a solution example:<n>```python <n>def listrotator():<n>    for i, item in enumerate(price):<n>        if(i==2):<n>            price.append(10)<n>```<n>The above code gives the following output: [5,8,18,22,45]<n><n><n><n>---<n>¬©2019-2021 Chance B. and Micheal C<n>---<n><n>*[Code Snippets on this page are licensed under MIT license and should only be used for educational purposes.

Choices:  A: train station B: house C: cupboard D: cricket stadium E: surface of earth<n><n>### Response:		<n>```<n>"B"<n>```<n><n>### Instructions:<n>```<n>Input: In what place could you find the last person to have seen your grandparents alive? Choices:  C: cupboard D:"B" E: surface of earth F:"B"<n>	<n>Input: In what room can you find the last person who asked you to take down the clothes you're wearing? Answer: F<n>```<n><n>In my opinion, "B" should be the answer. This because everyone who lives in that house also go to different places (like school), so the air they breathe is mixed with other people, in other words it is impossible to find air that was breathed only by few people recently, also, the air in the cupboard has been mix with air from different places (like house or school), so that air cannot be breathed by only few people recently.<n><n>### Input1:<n><n>In what place could you go if you wanted a quick break from your day? Choices: A: train station B" C: cupboard D "B" E:"B" F:"B"<n>### Instruc:<n>In my opinion, the answer in this case is "B", since we have not been given what time of day it was that the question was presented, therefore the answer depends on whether it is morning, noon or night.<n>- At morning, you could go to a cupboard because it is safe (people do not go in there since it is a cupboard) and no one will notice if you were not seen.<n>- At noon, i would say that going to the cupboard is impossible since it is too hot in a closed space.<n>- At night, I think that going to the cupbard is not a good idea, because it is very cold in a cupboard so you will be frozen by the end of the day.<n>### Input2:<n>A: train station B: shop C: supermarket D: park E: restaurant F: sports store<n>### Instru:<n>Based on previous experiences, supermarket is a place that I could go to if I wanted to change my day but also eat.<n>### Input3:<n>In what place could I buy something to satisfy my food craving?

There is much detail within this book and so I feel very grateful for having this book.<n>><n>> My other favorite book is the Bible. This book has more detail then most books and I have read a lot.

No other book can have this many details and I want to learn even more.<n><n>### Input (Task):The world is changing and every day there are more inventions. People who lived a thousand years ago probably were not so different in many ways from people now. If they were alive today what would they think of our world? What would they talk about??<n><n>> Well, it would seem interesting because we are all so different today and we do not know how long it would take to get from here to there. I can imagine they would talk about how fast the world was moving around them. They would also talk of the advances that have helped the world. Also, there would be a whole lot of changes because of different inventions. They would probably talk about how much more advanced the world was and how this world was very different.<n><n>### Task:<n>I would like to visit a country that was like it is here 1000 years ago. However, if I could only visit one country which country would it be.<n><n>### Response <n>I wish for 1000x times it could be 1000s years ago but I can't. But I would have to say that I would be visiting the USA because it is the most technologically advanced, and we are going to be the most advanced in the future for the next 200 years at least, and I have 1000 lifetimes to see it. And probably around 900 because after I see the future I don't think I will want to do it again lol, it's gonna be a rough transition at first.<n>

Choices:  A: pleasant thoughts B: overspending C: moving there D: staying there E: debt<n><n>### Response:		<n>You can choose the correct one or you can type in anything else that is similar from the choices above.<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>Answer: How to find the total number of hours, we take the 3 times he goes to the gym, then he spends 1 hour doing each thing, 1hour lifting and another 1/3 of it to warm up, which would be 2/3, since the last 1/3 is cardio, so I multiplied 3/3, which equals 1 whole hour, that's why the results are 3, because he goes to the gymnasium 3 times in a week. Another way I did this is I take 2.5(how long it takes to do the dried fruit) and substract 3 (the 3rd is a whole hour) and it is 1, and you take 1 and put it against 2, 2/2=1, 1 whole hour. But I don't like this answer because it is wrong and there are simpler but more difficult ways of getting the answer.

Use sample data to explain the behavior observed, the cause of the behavior, and any suggestions you may have for the future. Remember, you may not get your own code or data set to retry the problem. You still must give solutions and code. It looks like it asks if you can enter "C". Since you would have to enter the letter C on the key board at the keyboard. Entering the letter C is the same as typing the letter C on any computer. The answer is "C". This is because, when the question was asked, the person answering it wasn't using a computer program, such as a web page or an email message. He or she was just typing letters. The question asked: What letter should you enter to show the person you care? I answered it by showing I understood what letter to enter. The person asked me to tell what letter I entered. I described how I entered it, what the letter was, and what it looked like on a computer screen.<n><n>### Input :  In what countries are the most people living on less than $1 per day.

Choices:  A: symphony B: band C: create music D: orchestra E: string quartet<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The viola is one of the main instruments played in symphony orchestras. However, it often plays second-fiddle, literally, to the first violins. A viola can be played along side string instruments in a string quartet, and with brass instruments in a band. Orchestras use their entire spectrum of players for a variety of sounds. This creates and maintains an interesting array of timbres, tones, and textures. Violas are also notoriously hard and expensive to manufacture, which is why a soloist will more often employ a player from within the orchestra as opposed to a separate professional viola player from outside.<n><n>### Input<n><n><n>### Response<n><n>Violas have a higher range than violins and are a lot more difficult to play.<n><n>### Test code:<n><n>

After responding to the initial statement, ask a clarifying question.<n><n>## Initial Statement:<n>“Although this could be considered a negative trait, it is likely the reason why all the men are obsessed with her. The world needs to learn to let an awkward looking, quirky, interestingly funny girl like her be her beautiful, awkward self.”<n><n>### Response Statement:<n>I guess that would be considered a positive and negative way of looking at this situation. I know that in all relationships men would put up with some quirky traits just so they wouldn’t be left alone. It might seem like an unattractive trait, but as the author states in the article, that’s the reason all the men are obsessing over her. She is just herself and doesn’t try and make herself seem more beautiful than she is.<n><n>### Clarifying Question:<n>How did you make that statement? What would you have them do to fix it? Why?<n><n>### Response to Clarifying Question<n>Wow, thanks for asking that question.  I actually did read the title and started writing my response on the spot about this awkward looking girl.  I think I read too fast and should have read more carefully in order to fully understand the context of what the author was talking about.  As for your question, I think they should be more precise on how they word the title for readers who do not read articles and blogs too quickly.  My response might have come off as making fun of awkward looking girls when in fact, I don’t think it was meant to do that. I did enjoy reading this article.<n><n>### Question:<n>How did this statement by the woman make you feel about her husband?<n>A. B. C. D. E.<n><n>### Response<n>A.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>This line of the article makes me want to see how they met and started their relationship.  It’s so unique and intriguing. I want to know what their first date was like.  I hope her husband knows she loves him so much because her love for him is displayed by the way she treats and talks about him in interviews and on social media.  She’s not hiding him on purpose.  That

In that case, the conjunction would work because I believe a new employee is the connection between the statement and the company.<n><n>###Instructions:<n>Fill each sentence with a sentence fragment.

Choices:  A: see king B: hello C: meow D: drink water E: live many years<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>**C**  <n>Meow is what a cat would normally say. The cat has to say its name, and it does that by meow. The word, meow, is not its name, it is meow. Likewise, the cat has to say hi to someone. It does so with the word hello. I believe that meow is the most appropriate thing for a cat to say.<n>	In reality, cats meow and purr to express different things. For example, if a person has never meowed but has a cat, the cat meow will be considered a meow, not a purr. The cat purrs on its own. The cat would not do this if it did not know that there was anyone in the room. The purr is a language that the cat uses with its owner. Some cats also have names like cat, dog, lion and the like. All these have to be differentiated by the humans since they are all in the same house.

One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Answer: 56<n><n>Input: Johns goes to the gym 3 times a week.

How many hours does he spend at the gym a week?<n>Answer: 4<n><n>### Input:What sport is the audience the loudest at? Choices:  A: show B: theatre C: hockey game D: movies E: event<n><n>### Response:		<n>Asking the right type of questions is vital in an interview. There are two major types of questions: closed-ended questions and open ended questions. Closed-ended questions are questions to which a person can have a ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ or ‘1 to 3’ choice of answers. Open ended questions are questions to which your interviewer answers ‘Yes’ or ‘Maybe’.<n><n>Closed-ended questions are ideal for screening out candidates on the phone and can make you sound like a robot. Interviews, however, are not as straight forward, so you need to know when to use closed-ended questions and when not to use them.<n><n>In the example above, the interviewer must be able to give a yes or no answer to what sport fans are the loundest. You need to have information on that sport before you decide to use a closed-ended question. Otherwise, you may sound like a robot and you risk the candidate’s perception on how he or she is being interviewed.

Choices:  A: tie shoelace B: rest C: tiredness D: run longer E: sit down<n><n>### Response:		<n>The first step in our response is a "for" loop.  Within that loop, we first define an empty list to store all of the variables as they are computed.  <n><n>Inside the loop, we define three conditions.  The first takes the number of items in the list, and divides that by two.   The second checks for the length of the list, subtracts two, and if that results in a remainder of two, adds it to the list.  This indicates that the index variable reached its ending position for the items in the list, thus we can break the loop.<n><n>Inside the body of the loop, we define the variables of a for the specified item, and subtract two from the index variable, so as long as the loop doesn't break due to exceeding the length of the list of the item, we decrement the variables of the for in the for loop.<n><n>Finally, we print the variables of the for, with some formatting.<n>

Your teacher will have instructions ready so it shouldn't require much thinking. The first part of programming is called 'input' and defines the problem. The second part is called 'output' and displays the solution to the problem.<n><n>This is the easiest way I know to explain programming - your teacher and classmates should be able to understand it.<n><n>Your teacher should explain these terms in your class and hopefully he or she will provide you with a lot of sample prompts and answers.<n><n>### Hint<n><n>When given a challenge, your first step should be to draw out the problem on paper. Write down what is given, and what might be needed to solve the problem.  You might actually draw something if it helps you figure out the right choice.  For today, I provided you with some sample questions for you to practice.  This is the first part of your task.  If you haven't finished drawing it out, don't worry! You can come in on Wed and get help finishing it! <n><n>I will leave the problem here as an example, you don't need to do anything with it or work on it. You will receive the problem to finish your task next week.<n><n>### Output<n><n>If you've successfully completed the previous step, you will be provided a solution to the problem. Your teacher may give you options or hints. A hint is any part of the question or answer that is not strictly required to correctly solve the program. The output will be in either a multiple choice format (as explained later) or free text (where there are no choices other than the option that your choice correctly solves the problem). <n><n>If you do all the steps, you have finished the course for today and a job well done! But remember, just because your teacher gave you an answer or provided you with hints doesn't mean it's over. <n><n>### Demostration<n><n>In today's task your teacher will have different input for you to finish.  The task will look a little bit different to the above question, but the process is the same for everything. <n><n>Your teacher will use a free text output (where there are no multiple choice answers), and the answer you choose will be indicated with an X. Your answer will then be added to a t

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Adam bought 3 kilograms of nuts and 2.5 kilograms of dried fruits at a store. One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Answer: 56<n><n>Input: Johns goes to the gym 3 times a week.  He spends 1 hour each day lifting weight. Additionally, he also spends a third of his weightlifting time warming up and doing cardio each day.  How many hours does he spend at the gym a week?<n>Answer: 4<n><n>### Input:What would be considered a success when attempting procreation? Choices:  A: celebrate B: have party C: hear crowd go mad D: create success E: reproduce<n><n>### Response:		 There are two ways to evaluate success which lead different people to different conclusions. The first is to celebrate the birth, and the other is to consider people who are having children. This allows those who want children, and can't have them to be the majority. This can be seen as successes because they were able to do what they wanted in the end.<n><n>### Input (repeat): What would be considered a success<n><n>### Response (repeat): There are two ways to answer this question, A, B, and D are all accurate depending on the perspective you look at it from. It really depends on what type of person you are and what your life goals are. If you want children and are not able to have them then A is true because it does not matter the situation for them. Like if someone wanted 6 children, but through accident or disease is unable to conceive them then they would not have children. Some people would consider that person a failure but that would not be their truth. <n>D is true because some people want a large family and a large house and that it does not matter if they were able to reproduce on their birth control or if they are older. <n>B can be true for people that are in their child rearing years and people who are not interested in having children. For example, if Adam buys a 300$ laptop when he does not need it, but he does not care for it and does not plan on keeping it for very long. That may seem like the perfect scenario for him but if he wants a 400$ laptop then what just bought would be an epic failure in his eyes.<n><n>### Additional Notes: What should I include when writing my response?

Those instructions may come from a program written by someone or generated by the computer itself. Computer programmers often write statements that tell computers what to do. <n>A program is a collection of instructions that the computer follows. Sometimes, programmers write programs that other people can run. These programs are known as software. Writing software is a complex task. <n>When running a program, a computer’s CPU, or central processing unit, will read each instruction and carry out whatever action it’s instructed to do, one instruction at a time. The first instruction tells the CPU to do the same action with an input and a constant value. The next instruction tells the CPU to find a value based on the previous instructions, along with the input and current values.<n><n>### Response<n><n>#### Note: Answer is any language, including code.<n><n>I am a computer science nerd!

Once a variable is assigned a value this value can’t be changed.<n><n>### Answer:<n>1.Variables are used to represents values that can be changed<n>2.Once a variable is assigned a variable this value can’t change.<n><n>### What does assignment mean?<n><n>### Definition:<n>Assignment is the process of assigning a value to a value and is a programming term.<n><n>### Example:<n>Once you’ve created your variable in a program, the program knows that this value represents the temperature of your oven. If you want to change your variable you need to do an assignment.<n><n>### Types:<n>1.Declared variable<n>Example:<n>```js<n>let number = 5;<n>```<n>Declared variables are variables that are created but don’t have a value assigned yet, which is used inside functions, loops or other commands. This type of variable is declared but not defined.<n>2.Defined variable<n>Example:<n>lets' define variable using const which is a constant.<n>```<n>const number=10;<n>```<n>Defined variable is assigned a value using equals sign which will be used while a program needs this variable’s value.<n><n><n>### How do variables and constants differ?<n><n>### Answer<n><n>1.Constant are constant<n><n>2.Constant can’t be changed<n><n>3.Constant are declared first and cannot be declared using dot operator.<n><n>### Definition of Variables<n>1.A variable is a name given to a location inside the computer for storing values. You might think an address is like a variable that stores the address of a building.<n><n>### Variable Example<n>The name of the variable is called the variable name. Variables are used to store values inside programs so we can re-use them. Let’s look at an example.<n><n><n>#### Program example<n><n><n>![](https://i.imgur.com/sXUx6Zk.png){:.align-center}<n><n><n>In this program we have one variable called temp.

That is, after a brief demonstration explaining how the solution to the problem is achieved, the students should be able to implement it themselves in a well-formatted manner.  However, if students are having extensive difficulty in writing the code, you may first give them the entire code (as a whole) and they can follow it to write and debug the code themselves.  After writing a solution for a certain problem, give them points based on a scale to indicate how well the solution is written compared to if you would have provided them complete code.  This also helps you see where the students are struggling.  A scale could be a maximum of 20 points.<n><n>---<n>### Credits<n>This exercise was originally created by [@pacan](https://github.com/pacan).<n><n>---

I did not have a large amount of code with which to play, so I thought about the challenge and came up with the following solution. I wanted to think about how the challenge related to objects and properties in JavaScript. In this challenge I was trying to create a new array of numbers based on the two original arrays. What I did was add the two arrays together to create a new array and then remove the numbers in the second array from the result. To see the result in action, we can see this solution below.<n><n>###### Example<n><n>## Instructions<n><n>### What do you think the outcome would be if you were to call the "merge" callback multiple times?<n><n>## Instrucions<n><n>### Code Challenge #2<n>I used a variable "score" in the console. I used "console.log()" in the console, and it displayed the number 3. I also noticed that "console.log" called "score" and the value was 3. This is because the console is designed to show the values of the variables you set in the console. <n> <n>## Demonstrastion<n>   <n>## Challenge 3<n>For challenge 3, I started by researching and looking into JavaScript "Objects" because the challenge required knowledge of Javascript "Objects".<n><n>#### Example<n><n>## Challnege 4<n> <n>### Solution<n><n>## Instrucrions<n><n>### Challenge 5<n><n>## Instruations: (This is where I got tripped up)<n>I added a var to the constructor, and created a variable for "score" and made it an int, but when doing this, it was not displaying anything on the console. <n>## Solution: The solution

This computer stores one model of computer, called X-Pro, which is produced in two different configurations. The store has a stock of 40 X-Pro computers. All computers are in the same condition (i.e. no dents, no scratches, etc.).

Choices:  A: city B: downtown C: own house D: bar E: shopping center<n><n>### Response:		<n>Write a program that, when given a string, searches for and returns a substring that starts with the first letter of the given string and ends with the last letter of the given string.<n>For example, the "cat" substring of "cats are" starts with the "c" in the first letter of the "cats are" string and ends with the "s" in the last letter of the "catare" string.<n><n>The first step in programming is to decide what your program should do. A program typically performs a task like adding numbers, displaying a picture or drawing a shape on screen. A program is typically defined by three phases:<n><n>1. A user requests a task: For this program, we will ask the user to input a string and then output an appropriate substring value.<n>2. The program processes the input: Here we will take the input string and search for the first character and the last character in the string.<n>If we use the above string as our input, as we approach the search from the left and right directions, any substring starting with "c" and ending with "r" will be the answer.<n><n>3. The program returns to the user: The final phase will display the requested substring to the user.<n><n>### Your submission code should contain the following:<n>1. Use the methods shown below. Make sure to also include a method called main which tests to see if a suitable substring exists.<n>2. Use any and all helper methods you think are useful.<n><n>### Methods:<n>1. Substring(String, int, int)<n>2. Start()<n>3. End()<n>4. Substring(String)<n><n>### Sample Input:<n>Input: Cats are fuzzy.<n><n>Input: Dogs are cute.<n><n>Output: cat<n><n>Output: dog<n><n>### Examples:<n>Input: The students were very excited about the new technology center at school.<n>Output: new<n><n>### Sample Output:<n>```<n>c<n>```<n><n>```<n>n<n>```<n><n>``` <n>t<n>```<n><n>```e<n>```<n><n>```s<n>```<n><n>```u<n>```<n><n>```d<n>```<n><n>```y<n>```<n><n>```a<n>```<n><n>```r<n>```<n>

Choices:  A: michigan B: lake C: tide pool D: nursery E: atlantic ocean<n><n>### Response:		Lake<n><n>### Why?<n>The sentence that I've given you says that there aren't many anamone in "what glove-shaped" state. So you need to figure out which word the sentence starts off with and is that a state with the word glove. Well if you can think of some states that would have a glove and you can imagine a bunch of other states then you should pick B. For example, Lake Michigan doesn't have any gloves but it looks like one which is a good thing to remember. That's how I got through that question, I'm sure there are other ways but this one seemed to work the most.<n><n>### What if the states are not "glove-shaped"?<n>Then I think you should choose E: Atlantic Ocean, because, "If water would be a glove-shaped then it would be Lake Michigan, so lake michigan isn't glove-shaped, so we would need to go to the next option: Atlantic Ocean" so, my guess is that if it isn't glove shaped then 2 choices will be lake michigan and Atlantic Ocean. I don't know why lake Michigan wasn't lake Michigan but it's most likely because Lake Michigan is a lake that has an o without any r by it. I hope I made this clear.<n><n>### If there isn't "glove-like" in the question, or if the glove has another word besides "glove", then what to do?<n>Well, for the word glove: I got it right cause it is a part of the ocean that has waves. My teacher says to think of the most "out there" or "eccentric" things you can think of and try to get those choices. If we can't think of any then we can ask a friend or the teacher but always follow up with "Which one seems to the most likely to be the correct one?". I was able to get through all my questions by thinking of what the weirdest thing i could think of that is correct, and I also thought if this question is hard then maybe the person that asked it doesn't think my question was hard.<n>Also, if it was a math problem then just draw a picture or a circle on your paper in order to get what word you need. That's how some of my math problems go.

How many hours does he spend at the gym a week?<n>Answer: 4<n><n>### Input:Where could you put some olives to prevent them from getting nearby food wet? Choices:  A: eaten B: glassess C: jar D: pizza E: refrigerator<n><n>### Response:		Input:<n><n>**A**: Olives, like any other fruit, get better with the appropriate amount of time and conditions they are ripened in. Olives are generally oval or oblong in shape with a thin skin and a very firm edible stone or pit surrounded by a pulp that is eaten with pimento. The olive is a traditional symbol of peace and wisdom. The color of the olive fruit varies from light green to deep purple depending on its level of ripeness. The flavor profile of the olive is typically bitter, oily and astringent.<n><n>**B**: Olives, on the other hand, are best eaten cold, hence the refrigeration.<n><n>**C**: Olives, by nature, require a lot of moisture. If you let your olives sit out on the counter for more than a few days, you will notice that they dry up pretty quickly. When the olives are stored in oil, the oil replaces some of the moisture which helps them to retain their quality. When stored in an airtight container, olives can last for months without losing their flavor or nutritional value.<n><n>**D**: Pizza is often made with olives as well. You can also use olives to add flavor or color to your dishes if you don’t like the taste of the oil. Olives also contain healthy fats and are high in fiber. You can freeze your olives and they will still be tasty.<n><n>**E**: I suggest you to try adding some olives to your dishes. Olives and pizza go really well together. The flavor of olives is mild enough to be enjoyed with almost any pizza.<n><n><n>[Click Me for the next problem set](ProblemSet_09_Array_Array.md)

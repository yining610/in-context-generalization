{"text": "The viola is one of the main instruments played in symphony orchestras. However, it often plays second-fiddle, literally, to the first violins. A viola can be played along side string instruments in a string quartet, and with brass instruments in a band. Orchestras use their entire spectrum of players for a variety of sounds. This creates and maintains an interesting array of timbres, tones, and textures.

After responding to the initial statement, ask a clarifying question.\n\n## Initial Statement:\n\u201cAlthough this could be considered a negative trait, it is likely the reason why all the men are obsessed with her. The world needs to learn to let an awkward looking, quirky, interestingly funny girl like her be her beautiful, awkward self.\u201d\n\n### Response Statement:\nI guess that would be considered a positive and negative way of looking at this situation. I know that in all relationships men would put up with some quirky traits just so they wouldn\u2019t be left alone. It might seem like an unattractive trait, but as the author states in the article, that\u2019s the reason all the men are obsessing over her. She is just herself and doesn\u2019t try and make herself seem more beautiful than she is.\n\n### Clarifying Question:\nHow did you make that statement? What would you have them do to fix it? Why?\n\n### Response to Clarifying Question\nWow, thanks for asking that question.  I actually did read the title and started writing my response on the spot about this awkward looking girl.  I think I read too fast and should have read more carefully in order to fully understand the context of what the author was talking about.  As for your question, I think they should be more precise on how they word the title for readers who do not read articles and blogs too quickly.

For the choice A, the whole statement is to connect the other paragraph about how two companies were similar to the first sentence that a new employee can connect his job to what the company does. In that case, the conjunction would work because I believe a new employee is the connection between the statement and the company.\n\n###Instructions:\nFill each sentence with a sentence fragment.

How many years does he have to study Japanese to understand 1000 Japanese words?\n\n### Response :\nIt\u2019s probably a good idea that you memorize certain vocabulary words over the course of the semester. If you know all of the prefixes and suffixes associated with Japanese roots, you\u2019ll probably be able to learn a lot of new words, too.\nHowever, this seems like a large project. You\u2019ll probably want to spend at least a few hours a day learning the language, in addition to studying it in class. It will be a good use of your time if you do a project like this.\n\n### Question:\nThe number of students in a class exceeds 20, so the teacher will ask us to break the class into small groups.

{"text": "**C**  \nMeow is what a cat would normally say. The cat has to say its name, and it does that by meow. The word, meow, is not its name, it is meow. Likewise, the cat has to say hi to someone. It does so with the word hello. I believe that meow is the most appropriate thing for a cat to say.\n\tIn reality, cats meow and purr to express different things. For example, if a person has never meowed but has a cat, the cat meow will be considered a meow, not a purr. The cat purrs on its own. The cat would not do this if it did not know that there was anyone in the room. The purr is a language that the cat uses with its owner. Some cats also have names like cat, dog, lion and the like.

This indicates that the index variable reached its ending position for the items in the list, thus we can break the loop.\n\nInside the body of the loop, we define the variables of a for the specified item, and subtract two from the index variable, so as long as the loop doesn't break due to exceeding the length of the list of the item, we decrement the variables of the for in the for loop.\n\nFinally, we print the variables of the for, with some formatting.", "answer": "A: tie shoelace"}

{"text": "The answer is\n\n\n### Explanation\nThe first step in programming is to understand and define the problem. Your teacher will have instructions ready so it shouldn't require much thinking. The first part of programming is called 'input' and defines the problem. The second part is called 'output' and displays the solution to the problem.\n\nThis is the easiest way I know to explain programming - your teacher and classmates should be able to understand it.\n\nYour teacher should explain these terms in your class and hopefully he or she will provide you with a lot of sample prompts and answers.\n\n### Hint\n\nWhen given a challenge, your first step should be to draw out the problem on paper. Write down what is given, and what might be needed to solve the problem.  You might actually draw something if it helps you figure out the right choice.  For today, I provided you with some sample questions for you to practice.  This is the first part of your task.  If you haven't finished drawing it out, don't worry! You can come in on Wed and get help finishing it! \n\nI will leave the problem here as an example, you don't need to do anything with it or work on it. You will receive the problem to finish your task next week.\n\n### Output\n\nIf you've successfully completed the previous step, you will be provided a solution to the problem. Your teacher may give you options or hints. A hint is any part of the question or answer that is not strictly required to correctly solve the program. The output will be in either a multiple choice format (as explained later) or free text (where there are no choices other than the option that your choice correctly solves the problem). \n\nIf you do all the steps, you have finished the course for today and a job well done! But remember, just because your teacher gave you an answer or provided you with hints doesn't mean it's over. \n\n### Demostration\n\nIn today's task your teacher will have different input for you to finish.  The task will look a little bit different to the above question, but the process is the same for everything. \n\nYour teacher will use a free text output (where there are no multiple choice answers), and the answer you choose will be indicated with an X. Your answer will then be added to a t", "answer": "E: walking out of"}

Some people would consider that person a failure but that would not be their truth. \nD is true because some people want a large family and a large house and that it does not matter if they were able to reproduce on their birth control or if they are older. \nB can be true for people that are in their child rearing years and people who are not interested in having children. For example, if Adam buys a 300$ laptop when he does not need it, but he does not care for it and does not plan on keeping it for very long. That may seem like the perfect scenario for him but if he wants a 400$ laptop then what just bought would be an epic failure in his eyes.\n\n### Additional Notes: What should I include when writing my response?

{"text": "Answer: A\n\n### Input\n#### Note: Answer in any language, including code\nMost of the time, a computer can perform a complex task by following instructions. Those instructions may come from a program written by someone or generated by the computer itself. Computer programmers often write statements that tell computers what to do. \nA program is a collection of instructions that the computer follows. Sometimes, programmers write programs that other people can run. These programs are known as software. Writing software is a complex task. \nWhen running a program, a computer\u2019s CPU, or central processing unit, will read each instruction and carry out whatever action it\u2019s instructed to do, one instruction at a time. The first instruction tells the CPU to do the same action with an input and a constant value. The next instruction tells the CPU to find a value based on the previous instructions, along with the input and current values.\n\n### Response\n\n#### Note: Answer is any language, including code.\n\nI am a computer science nerd!", "answer": "E: hands"}

If you want to change your variable you need to do an assignment.\n\n### Types:\n1.Declared variable\nExample:\n```js\nlet number = 5;\n```\nDeclared variables are variables that are created but don\u2019t have a value assigned yet, which is used inside functions, loops or other commands. This type of variable is declared but not defined.\n2.Defined variable\nExample:\nlets' define variable using const which is a constant.\n```\nconst number=10;\n```\nDefined variable is assigned a value using equals sign which will be used while a program needs this variable\u2019s value.\n\n\n### How do variables and constants differ?\n\n### Answer\n\n1.Constant are constant\n\n2.Constant can\u2019t be changed\n\n3.Constant are declared first and cannot be declared using dot operator.\n\n### Definition of Variables\n1.A variable is a name given to a location inside the computer for storing values. You might think an address is like a variable that stores the address of a building.\n\n### Variable Example\nThe name of the variable is called the variable name. Variables are used to store values inside programs so we can re-use them.

I did not have a large amount of code with which to play, so I thought about the challenge and came up with the following solution. I wanted to think about how the challenge related to objects and properties in JavaScript. In this challenge I was trying to create a new array of numbers based on the two original arrays. What I did was add the two arrays together to create a new array and then remove the numbers in the second array from the result. To see the result in action, we can see this solution below.\n\n###### Example\n\n## Instructions\n\n### What do you think the outcome would be if you were to call the \"merge\" callback multiple times?\n\n## Instrucions\n\n### Code Challenge #2\nI used a variable \"score\" in the console. I used \"console.log()\" in the console, and it displayed the number 3. I also noticed that \"console.log\" called \"score\" and the value was 3. This is because the console is designed to show the values of the variables you set in the console. \n \n## Demonstrastion\n   \n## Challenge 3\nFor challenge 3, I started by researching and looking into JavaScript \"Objects\" because the challenge required knowledge of Javascript \"Objects\".\n\n#### Example\n\n## Challnege 4\n \n### Solution\n\n## Instrucrions\n\n### Challenge 5\n\n## Instruations: (This is where I got tripped up)\nI added a var to the constructor, and created a variable for \"score\" and made it an int, but when doing this, it was not displaying anything on the console. \n## Solution: The solution", "answer": "B: main"}

Using a menu that you choose before you enter any meals, you could enter both food and drink items that you eat. After each meal, you must give the dish a rating. A rating higher than two shows that you felt it was a healthy meal.\n\nAt the end of each day, it is possible to calculate your daily intake of carbohydrates, fat, fiber, protein and sugar. If you choose an exercise and rest plan to the application, you could enter exercise data throughout the day. You can also use the application to help you monitor your weight. This is determined by the use of a calorie counter that you choose.\n\nIf you don't want to pay money to keep track of what you eat, it might be a good idea to download a free or low-cost program.\n\n### Answer the questions that follow the text.\n\n1. Do you think you should record what you eat and drink?\n\n2. What other foods and drinks could you record?\n\n3. What would be the advantage of exercising and recording it?\n\n4.

Select the most appropriate response below.\n\n### How would you solve:\n\nWrite a string that represents the maximum profit of selling all of a computer store\u2019s stock of a brand new gaming computer. This computer stores one model of computer, called X-Pro, which is produced in two different configurations. The store has a stock of 40 X-Pro computers. All computers are in the same condition (i.e. no dents, no scratches, etc.). There are only two options that consumers want to purchase: the standard version at a price of $699, and the deluxe version at $999. The store will want to sell them to the lowest cost person in total and can sell either one model for a total profit of $300,000. If the store sells the standard version, it will pay the store for $5 and make a profit of $303. If the store sell the deluxe version, it will pay a store of $1,000 and make a profit of 0.3 million. A customer is willing to pay as much as the maximum the store has for the deluxe version and to buy the standard version at the lowest possible price.\n\n### Note: There are no other options.\n\n### Solution: \n\n### Instructor: \n\n\n**Answer:**\n1.

I have never heard about such expression \"to be senior in a house\".\n\n### Example\uff1a\nInput: Adam spent 5 days of his holiday visiting his grandmother during which time he also helped her with some yard work. He also spent 3 days at an all day conference which he has been invited to attend and during this time he took care of nothing else. How many days did he spend in his holiday?\n\n### Response\n\nAnswer: \"he took care of nothing else\" means he did nothing. I don't understand the \"to-do list\" at the bottom.\n\n### Another Response:\nHe spent 5 days with the grandmother. He spent 3 days at all-day conference. If we count 5+3=8 days. Where is the mistake and what day did he spend nothing else?\n\n\n### Comment\uff1a\nThe sentence can be understood as 5+3. I've seen a similar sentence as \"2 days\" at the \"all-day conference\", but it is just an example, they are not the same.\n\n### Solution\n\n* 8/1=8 days\n* -3/1=4 days\n* 1/3=1 day\n\n### Example in Chinese:\n\u8f93\u5165\uff1a\u5728\u8003\u8651\u8d2d\u4e70\u9632\u66b4\u6253\u6bd2\u836f\u7684\u624b\u7eed\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8058\u8bf7\u4e13\u6237\u505a\u5bb6\u5ead\u5783\u573e\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u3002\u5728\u8d2d\u4e63\u5bb6\u4e2d\u6c34\u624b\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u8003\u865c\u8d2d\u4e55\u5176\u5bb6\u4e2d\u6253\u6c34\u3002\n\u8f93\u51fa: \u5b83\u4f1a\u6bd4\u4e00\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd", "answer": "D: republican party"}

{"text": "Lake\n\n### Why?\nThe sentence that I've given you says that there aren't many anamone in \"what glove-shaped\" state. So you need to figure out which word the sentence starts off with and is that a state with the word glove. Well if you can think of some states that would have a glove and you can imagine a bunch of other states then you should pick B. For example, Lake Michigan doesn't have any gloves but it looks like one which is a good thing to remember. That's how I got through that question, I'm sure there are other ways but this one seemed to work the most.\n\n### What if the states are not \"glove-shaped\"?\nThen I think you should choose E: Atlantic Ocean, because, \"If water would be a glove-shaped then it would be Lake Michigan, so lake michigan isn't glove-shaped, so we would need to go to the next option: Atlantic Ocean\" so, my guess is that if it isn't glove shaped then 2 choices will be lake michigan and Atlantic Ocean. I don't know why lake Michigan wasn't lake Michigan but it's most likely because Lake Michigan is a lake that has an o without any r by it. I hope I made this clear.\n\n### If there isn't \"glove-like\" in the question, or if the glove has another word besides \"glove\", then what to do?\nWell, for the word glove: I got it right cause it is a part of the ocean that has waves. My teacher says to think of the most \"out there\" or \"eccentric\" things you can think of and try to get those choices. If we can't think of any then we can ask a friend or the teacher but always follow up with \"Which one seems to the most likely to be the correct one?\". I was able to get through all my questions by thinking of what the weirdest thing i could think of that is correct, and I also thought if this question is hard then maybe the person that asked it doesn't think my question was hard.\nAlso, if it was a math problem then just draw a picture or a circle on your paper in order to get what word you need.

{"text": "Input:\n\n**A**: Olives, like any other fruit, get better with the appropriate amount of time and conditions they are ripened in. Olives are generally oval or oblong in shape with a thin skin and a very firm edible stone or pit surrounded by a pulp that is eaten with pimento. The olive is a traditional symbol of peace and wisdom. The color of the olive fruit varies from light green to deep purple depending on its level of ripeness. The flavor profile of the olive is typically bitter, oily and astringent.\n\n**B**: Olives, on the other hand, are best eaten cold, hence the refrigeration.\n\n**C**: Olives, by nature, require a lot of moisture. If you let your olives sit out on the counter for more than a few days, you will notice that they dry up pretty quickly. When the olives are stored in oil, the oil replaces some of the moisture which helps them to retain their quality. When stored in an airtight container, olives can last for months without losing their flavor or nutritional value.\n\n**D**: Pizza is often made with olives as well. You can also use olives to add flavor or color to your dishes if you don\u2019t like the taste of the oil. Olives also contain healthy fats and are high in fiber. You can freeze your olives and they will still be tasty.\n\n**E**: I suggest you to try adding some olives to your dishes. Olives and pizza go really well together. The flavor of olives is mild enough to be enjoyed with almost any pizza.\n\n\n[Click Me for the next problem set](ProblemSet_09_Array_Array.md)", "answer": "C: jar"}

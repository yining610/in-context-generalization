In order to complete the first two problems below, we will need to use a few C functions.\nPlease read, complete, and return this assignment.\nIt has already been assigned to you by Canvas.\n\n### 1. Fill in the blank problems\n\n1. The first C function to review is int. In the example below, `get_num` is defined as an integer data type, which is a built in C data type:\n```\n   int get_num(void);\n```\n\nThe above statement allows you to pass in a function that will return an int value.  In the example below, the function is declared with the `int` keyword, and an underscore for the name - underscores are allowed, but not necessary:\n```\n   #include <stdlib.h>\n    int get_num(int num);\n   /* A function definition below */\n   int get_int() {\n      int num = -1;\n      /* Get input from console */\n      while(num == -1) {\n         printf(\"Input number: \");\n         scanf(\"%d\", &num);\n         printf(\"%d\", num);\n         if(num < 0 || num > 150) // Error condition if user didn't give input\n            printf(\"Wrong/Invalid input\\n\");\n      }\n      /* Return value */\n      return num;\n   }\n   ```\n\nCall the function above now in the same file.  Print a comment line after the function - the line should have two characters '#' on it:\n```\n   /* A function to display randomness from -150 to 150 */\n   int getInt() {\n```\n\nAfter getting an int from the user, use the `int` function to store the number in a variable.  Now loop the variable three times:\n```\n      int num = get_int();\n      printf(\"You entered %d.\\n\", num);\n      for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n         printf(\"You entered %2d.\\n\", num + i);\n      }\n   }\n*/\n2.

There is also no such thing as free coding lesson, tutorial or book, although some may claim that it\u2019s better than nothing at all.\n\nSo how to start your coding adventure, how to learn fast and stay on track without burning your brains and spending all your money on books and courses? The answer is simple, you should learn through doing.\n\n### 1.1. The learning-through-doing model\n\nWe all start as learners in something. What helps us learn depends not only on what we get out of our lessons or classes, but also on the actual process of learning. How we learn?\n\nThe learning-through-do model suggests that learning is an active process with a number of steps. It is not enough just to be attentive and to listen. To understand something on its level, you not just need to hear the subject, but you need to do the work to assimilate it.\n\nLearning is a process consisting of the following steps:\n\n#### Motivation\n\nMotivation: **\u201cWhat is motivation? \u201d**\n\nMotivated people are willing to learn, willing to do anything it takes to learn and willing to put hard work. Most of us know exactly what motivation is but we are less concerned with how to cultivate it.\n\nIf you're a programmer, your motivation comes from the way you feel about your work. There are people who feel they don't want to do their coding, they don't enjoy it, and they've only done it because it pays a lot of money. These people will never be motivated to work in a coding job. \n\nIf your reason to become a programmer is money, it's almost guaranteed that you'll run out of the will to invest your time and effort to improve your skills and learn new things. And this is where your motivation breaks the cycle. The cycle of doing work you don't like ends here. You have to change that mentality, start investing your time to something you love and this is how your productivity can be improved and your motivation will become a driving force in your career. \n\n#### Involvement\n\nInvolvement: **\u201cHow can we be involved in learning something", "answer": "C: study"}

In the book, we have already introduced several languages to you, such as C, S-Expressions, Scheme, and JavaScript. Here, I will introduce these programming language.\n\n[C++ Reference](C++ Reference.md): C++ is an object-oriented, statically typed, compiled, and extended programming language. C++ also includes support for functional programs. It is designed for systems programming, especially resource management, and embedded development, but its use is no longer limited to systems programming.\n\n\n\n### Part2 : Languages in our world\n\n#### First Example :\n\nHere are some of the questions for you to practice in our world programming languages.

In other languages, such as perl, javascript and others, they are constant. Why? What is the big difference between the two?\nOutput: Languages with constant strings cannot do string interpolation in a script.\n\nInput: Languages where strings are constant also tend to use interpolation inside the string for the output, so that the output is not a concatenation of strings with spaces, but rather one string with formatting. In python for example, a formatting statement is this.\nprint ('The number is {0}'.format(number))\nOutput: Languages where strings can have spaces in them, that will be concatenated together to form the new one. You cannot use interpolation, so your output will be of one string, separated by empty spaces.\n\nInput: Is there an advantage to using interpolation inside strings? Output: The advantage is it is more readable, and it makes the output easier to parse and parse in an efficient manner by the interpreter.\n\nInput: In python there is something called a 'del' statement.

We could simply make a variable and add 1 to it after every \"d\" from both sides. Since there are 4 \"d\"s, the variable value would be 4.\nOr we could use regex to parse after \"d\". Then we would be able to have the variable take either positive or negative value. So, our second solution would be:\n![](/img/2019-06-15/screen1.png)\nWith our new variable of \"n\", we now can use it as an input for our \"sum\" function.

{"text": "C\n\nInput: If a train left a station for a city with a speed of 75 miles per hour, how long will it take it to reach that city? Hint: don't try to use math.\n\nAnswer: This question is confusing, but it sounds something like this: If a train left from a station going 75 mph,  how long will it take the train to get to its destination? This is an interesting question. It has always been a question that has caught my intrest, and I have spent many hours trying to devise a way to solve it.\n\nI know that speed of an object is determined by the distance which it travels in a given amount of time. Let's say that the train travels 1 kilometer per hour in a given time frame of X hours. Then if we multiply these two numbers together, we get this; X hours * 75 kilometers per hour = X kilometers. This is a fairly general equation that explains the relationship of time and distance.\n\nBut how can we find out how long it will take the train to go from where it is to its' destination? Well, we know that there is a formula that tells us the distance (or displacement) of an object over a period of given time. This formula is d=v*t, in which 'v' is the velocity of the object, and 't' refers to time. \n\n\nInput: Which of these is not correct?\nChoices: A: I have a lot of homework\nB: I have had a lot of homework lately.\nC: I have had a whole lot of homework in my last two classes.\nD: I have had homework from my last two classes. \nOutput: A\n\nInput: How many cables can a tape be?\nChoices: 6\noutput: B\n\nInput: What's the best way to solve a math problem that is a cube?\nChoices: Drill it.\nOutput: D\n\nInput: In what state is the largest part of US?\nChoices: New York\nOutput: C \n\nInput: When a man is walking and stops, how long is he standing?\nOutput: A\n[A man is walking when suddenly he stops.

{"text": "C\n\n### Explanation\nIn this program, we have to use math and data to solve certain questions. The questions are often from real life, so our knowledge about data and problem solving will be applied. We use a \"input\" button to give some input to the computer, a \"process\"  to start the program, and finally a \"output\" button to get our answer from the program.\n\nAll of the questions we will be solving have only two answers. Sometimes, the question will have many options, but in this program, we don't want the program making our decisions for us; we want it to help us solve the questions.\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/XDash-/X-Fundamentals/blob/master/CMS/P1.png\" width=\"100%\"/>\n<img src=\"images/process1.gif\" width=\"10%\" align=\"left\";/>\n\nFirst, we read the rules and then start using the computer. First, the \"process\" button will be clicked. Before the computer begins to run, there must be a certain input in order for the computer to begin. This input can be input by one of two buttons: the input button or the refresh button.\n\n\nTo begin, we will click the \"input\" button to let the computer know that there is an input we are going to put into it. This input will be the data we are given to solve. This can be answered by the following way:\n* Choose one from two to three choices the problem gives us \n* Click the input button\n\nIn order for the program to give us the answer the question gives to us, this choice will need to be made and inputted into the program. The choices will always have positive answers such as 3 or 5. In this case, the choices will always be a positive fraction such as 3/4 or 3.5.\n\nAfter inputting it, we need to click the \"process\" button. Now, the program has begun and it will start using the input we give it. To do this, it will use the \"output\" button for the answer it wants to give us.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install the dependencies, we will use npm. The command we will need to use is:\n> npm install\n\n```bash\nnode app.js\n```", "answer": "C: smooth skin"}

The GolfScript expression 4.2 can be replaced by GolfScript variable. All other variables are implicitly numbers that can be used in the usual way (e.g. GolfScript variable is used as first argument in function definition, and not as a variable name).\n\nYou can have a look at the example in cells 5-128.\n\nSome of the rules are incomplete, so they must be resolved in some way. The default is to assume that all variables and constants are implicitly 0.\n\nYou should store all your programs as one file, with extension.gsl\n\nThere should be one input file called prompt.txt that only has the lines that ask the question:\n\n*The first line contains command to print the current state of the game.\n\n*The last line is end of the game.\n*The remaining lines contain one line of input and one line of output for every time the player has entered command that requires action from the computer before the next turn.\n\nThe format of the prompt is the following:\n\n    The game is between (name of the first player) and (name of the second player).

We should return output which is total cost for buying products as a single int. \n### Example:\nIf customer inputs:\nStampple (store name), 3kg (of nuts) and 2.5 kg (of dried fruits).\n\nReturn: 56\n### Solution : \nHere I have used 2 separate methods for these two problems.  \n#### Method 1:\nSolution to first problem uses nested for loop for performing multiplication over all the values. \n\n- Method for 2nd problem uses nested while loop where condition is: \"value of variable i\" should be more than previous iteration which holds \"i\" iteration in it. \n\nWe should also check that variable should be 2 if we're in 2 iteration to avoid running for loop when \"i\" value is greater than final iteration. \n\nBoth methods work correctly and pass all test cases.  \nThe difference between them only lies in code style.\n\nBelow is the full code:   \n```\nimport java.util.Scanner;\npublic class Solution {\n\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\n\t\tScanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);\n\t\tSystem.out.print(\"Enter the store Name\\t\\t\\t\\th:\\t\\t\\t w:\\n\");\n\t\tint nuts, driedFruit, nutsSum, driedSum;\n\t\tint totalCost;\n\t\ttotalCost = 0;\n\n\t\tdo{\n\n\t\t\ttry{\n\n\t\tnuts = Integer.parseInt(scan.next());\n\t\tdriedFruit = Integer.parseInt( scan.next());\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t}catch(Exception e){\n\n\t\t\t\tSystem.out\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t.println(\"You have enter a wrong value.\\nPlease enter again\");\n\t\t\t\tdo{\n\t\t\t}while(nuts == 0", "answer": "C: computer science"}

{"text": "B\n\nInstruction:Answer the following short answer question.\n- You have a pen that was purchased for $1. You used this pen for work and as a result the tip of it is worn down.\n\nWhat is the value of your pen once you consider the amount of time it has been worn?\n\nAnswer: Since it has been worn it has lost value, so we simply can divide $0.50 (half a dollar) by the amount of time it was used:\n10 weeks / $ 1 dollar = $0.10 (0.10 dollars per week)\n\n0.10 weeks / 1 dollar = 0.1 dollars\n\nIf I have to pay $0.10 for the pen, I would rather keep it since it lasts longer.\n\n\n\nExample: Say I have 60 cents. When I make a phone call, 10 cents of this 60 cents goes to telecom companies. If I have 4 cents left, and I can only spend it on candy? Then, yes, I will buy that candy. But then I spent 10 cents, which is more expensive than the 10 cents telecom company charges.\n\nSo, I don't buy that candy at all. Because it's more expensive than it was supposed to be.\n\nNote that this is the answer to your question: \"If a pencil costs $0.50 and it cost me $0.25 after using it, what's the value after I've used it?\" If you're asking \"how much would it cost me to buy a pencil now?\", then it's $0.50. But you can't ask that kind of question, for once when you buy something you can't know it loses value when you use it.\n\n\n\n#### Your code:\n```python\ndef price(num, price):\n    num_minus_price = float(num) - float(price)\n    if not(num < 0 or num_minus_price < 0):\n        return num_minus_price\n\n\na = float(input())\nb = float(input()) \n\nr = price(a, b)\nprint(\"Price:\", (r))\n```\n####", "answer": "D: acute angled"}

Here is a code example:\n```python\ndef calibr()\n    price = []\n    for i in range(5):\n        price.append(i)\n    for i in price:\n            i+=1\n```\nWe can now access the price element of the array and increment it using the previous array that contains the index values. The above code prints the price as 5,8,15,26,45. Here is the complete solution below :\n```python\ndef pricerotator():\n    price=5\n    for i inprice:\n        price+=1\n    print(price)\n```\n\n### Alternative solution with list comprehension\n\nWe can also solve this problem using list comprehension to calculate the incrementation amount and assigning the increamented value as a sublist in the original array. Here is a solution example:\n```python \ndef listrotator():\n    for i, item in enumerate(price):\n        if(i==2):\n            price.append(10)\n```\nThe above code gives the following output: [5,8,18,22,45]\n\n\n\n---\n\u00a92019-2021 Chance B. and Micheal C\n---\n\n*[Code Snippets on this page are licensed under MIT license and should only be used for educational purposes.

Chances are, you have never heard of a trendspotter.  Let me explain.<n><n>A trendspotter is a market research professional who is supposed to analyze the trends in business.  Every week, she is assigned a new product, such as the new iPhone or a shoe.  She then has to find 3 trends relating to her product in either mainstream media or social media websites.  Once she has found the trends in data she collects, she writes a two-page report of how the product is expected to do in the future and how its reputation is.  She then gets to sell both the report and the product inside the report to the clients of her company.<n><n>Some people, such as the marketing professionals at Apple, get paid to buy the trend reports so they can use them internally or sell them to their partners and business clients to help push further their own products/services.<n><n>The amount of money she makes from these sales can vary.  In some companies, she makes $10 for reports that are sold in the company, and she pays a 15% commission on those sold to clients.  In other companies, those prices are higher!<n><n>There are a few more variables that come into play and affect her earnings.  First, when you start your position as a trendspotter, you only receive $12 a week as a base salary.  However, there are some companies that pay much more than $12 a week.  Second, you can get paid $1.5 for each hour you work.  This may seem unimportant, but if you are trying to boost your revenue, the extra $1.5 an hour (if you are in a company that allows it) can be invaluable, especially if you are paid for overtime of over 8 hours a day.  Third, if she manages to get her clients to buy her reports at the minimum price, she gets 5% of the 15% commission for those she sells to the clients.  For example, if the client paid an extra $1.5 on a report she originally sold, she gets 5%.  If she managed to sell the report to the client for $30 rather than $26.75

Pi is about 3.14159.  One way to calculate an angle of a triangle is to use sine. The sine of a triangle is approximately the length of one side of the triangle to the other two sides of the triangle.  The length of the opposite side of the triangle divided by the hypotenuse of the triangle. The hypotenuse divides the triangle into two equal right angles, and the hypotenuse measures the length of the opposite side. The angle of a triangle is the length of the side that forms the angle divided by the length of the side which measures the length of the angle.  For example, the cosine ratio is the length of opposite side divided by hypotenuse. Sin is equal to opposite over hypotenuse. The sin of the triangle is approximately opposite over hypotenuse of the angle.  Sin of the triangle equals opposite short divided by hypotenuse of the side that measures the length of the hypotenuse.<n>Output: 7<n><n>Input: 10, 20<n>Output: 750, 800, 150<n><n>Input: It is time for the 2020-21 winter break around the world.

Increase the amount of nut, n * a = 4k*12 + 2,5*8, reduce to 12k, k = 2,5*12 + 12 = 14,5+12=26,5<n>2.	1/3 of the warming-up time + 4/3 of the cardio time n * b = 1/3b + 4/3b = 8/3b = 43/3<n>3.	2* (n * c + (c-2)/4 * (d^(1/4))/(1+(d-3)/24)) = 2* (3*12 + 3/4(8 -2) = 46<n>4.	The goals by 2 players account for 20%, so the total goal of the league to 1500 * 40% = 600, and 600/2=300, the two players scored 300 * (1/2)=150<n>5.	Every day he drank 5 x 12 oz = 60 ounces of soft drinks plus 64 *12 ounces of water = 200 oz, each week is 1600 / 7 = 233.14<n>6.	E is always the answer，because ignorance is no excuse for ignorance!<n>7.	Every single student has pencils; a teacher has at least 1 pen, and each student no more than 4 pens.

One starts from the left side of the alphabet and the other starts from the right side of the alphabet. Their lengths are the same. However, none of the characters in the alphabet have two different places which they appear in the strings in either order when they start from the beginning of either string. In order to obtain either string, you can simply delete any character until you reach the position where the strings start to differ with each other. The character you delete is called a separator (because it separates two different strings). Given that the strings consist of a set of characters that are not in the alphabet, output the strings themselves.<n>Output: CACDEGHIJLNMOPRUVWXZY<n><n>Input: This is an arithmetic problem but you cannot use addition, subtraction, division and multiplication.

It takes her 15 minutes to walk to the bus stop and a one-way trip on the bus is $5.40. For the same price, she can also take the taxi that leaves her house at 6:42 AM.

Since she can’t choose which bus to board, the arrival of each bus in the morning is independent of the arrival of other buses in the morning. The bus arrives to her stop with probability 0.69 (in other words, the chance of her getting a ride is the probability that the bus will be on schedule as defined by her). Her bus has 25 seats.

To his amazement, the snake went ballistic. “Shoot the son of a gun!” he yelled as the snake struggled. The cowboy shot the snake and then pulled his hand back. “What?” asked the cowboy! He shot the son of a gun, and it died.”<n><n>Input: The day my dog died, it was the day after Christmas. We’d gotten up a little late that morning from all the holiday stuff the night before

Choices:  A: hoof B: kentucky derby C: race track D: painting E: triple crown<n>Output:		C<n><n>## Solutions<n>### Solution 1<n>If the price for a kilogram of dried fruits is $8 and for nuts the price is $12, then when we multiply 2.5 by $8, we get 20. Adam bought 3 kilos and 2.5, so he has to pay 20 * 2 for a pack of nuts and 3 * 20 for 2.5 kilos of dried fruits. In the end, he has to pay 40 + 60 = 100 dollars.<n><n><n><n>### Solution 2<n>The time he spends at the gym depends on the number of days. If he go to the gym 5 times, then he spends 5 hours per day on weightlifting and warming up. As a result, he spends 30 hours at the gym next week.<n><n><n><n><n>## Solution 3<n>The price to fill is plane is divided by the new capacity. The new price is 200 / 2 = 100.<n><n><n><n>In two-player games, the number of goals scored is 20% of the total goals scored in this division from last season. If this season against Barca games account for 20% goals scored, then 20% of 300 is 60. Two teammates scored 60 goals.<n><n>To count all the fluids he has drunk, we need to sum the weights of drinks. 12 ounces multiply by 5 is 60, and add the weight of water makes the result 60 + 64 = 124 ounces.<n><n><n><n>As a rule, paintings depict something, and the horse can stand in a painting. Paintings have a specific theme, and artists need to stick to the theme when making a painting. Let's assume there are 10 types of themes. Choice A is a hooves. Choice B is not a commemoration of horse. Choice C is commemorated by race track. We should mark that we paint a horse for racing. Afterwards, we move on to Choice E. Since triple crown is the most valuable achievement in the American horse racing world, this is our final choice - Cho

After 2 minutes, it might begin to burn.  After 40 minutes, it’s probably finished.<n><n>An airplane takes exactly 20 minutes to land. After 15 minutes, you should tell your seat mate to check the fasten seat belt sign. After 35 minutes, the flight attendant will tell you that it is almost landing.<n><n>### Input: Output:<n><n>### Inputs:<n><n>In the case of the cake, there is not much variability. Cakes are pretty consistent. So, what might happen depends on how it came out of the oven initially. For instance, if it was a crumpled mass, its likelihood to burn is much higher than a well-formed piece. Similarly, the oven might not be working properly. If you know that is the case, you could check with a thermometer or test a sample of ice to see if the oven is really hot. The more you know about your cake, the better you’ll be able to predict its behavior.<n><n>The same thing applies to the planes. How far the plane is from the destination influences the time it takes to land. If it is early, it’s more likely to have a smoother ride. It might also spend more time circling and thus take longer to land. It is not like it is going to take half an hour because the airline thought it was landing 15 minutes from now. The likelihood of this is very slim.<n><n>In both cases, checking the “condition” of your cake and plane is a key part of making a prediction. You need to understand what it typically does and how that changes based on what you did with it.<n>

Here we use the power of repetition or composition to make the problem easier.<n><n>A: the probability is 1<n><n>To flip a coin is either heads or tails.<n><n>We can set up the problem like so:<n><n>The probability P(x) that you get heads is given by<n><n>P(x)=0.5^x<n><n>In this case, we have<n><n>P(x=0)=0.5^0=1<n><n>This means that the probability for x=0 means that you have 0 heads for 38 flips.<n><n>Now lets calculate P(x=1)=0.5 and P(x=2)=0.5.<n><n>As a check, we will calculate P(x=3)=0.5^3=0.1375<n><n>Now, we just need to add all the probabilities that x=a for all other values of a.<n><n>So, P(x=38)=0.5^2+0.5 and 0.5^4 and 0.5 for all others<n><n><n>We can calculate P(x=0)=1  as mentioned above.<n><n>Now, we need to calculate the probability that we get x=1. This means that we have 1 head for 38 flip of a coin. Again, the check is the previous condition we proved of p=0.135.<n><n>We can calculate the probability P(x=1) as<n><n>P(x = 1)=0.5^1=0.25.<n><n>For P(x=2), we have P(x=2) = 0.5^2 = 0.125<n><n>For the all other values of the variable, there is P(value=a) = 0.135^(a-0)<n><n>So, P([x=38]), because we have 38=0+1+2+3

If the players scored an equal number of goals, and the total number of goals scored in the league against Barca that season is 300, calculate the number of goals each of the two players scored.<n>Output: 30<n><n>Input: Every day Tom drinks 5 12-oz cans of soda plus 64 ounces of water.

Choices:  A: fairgrounds B: friend's house C: space shuttle D: oven E: microwave<n>Output:		A<n><n>#### Solution:<n><n>In the first example, I first noted that 1 kg of nuts costs $36. Therefore, 3 kg of nuts cost $108. I then noted that 2.5 kg of nuts costs 75$ and 1 kg of dried fruits costs $16. Therefore, 2.5 kg (or ¼) of dried fruits cost 16 * 4 = 64$. I then multiplied 108 + 64 to get 172.<n><n>In the second example, I first noted from the clues that  James refuels his plane three times a week.  I then first noted that James needs to refuel his plane more often and get more fuel. I then used the clues that the total number of goals that the players scored against Barcelona last season is 30, and that the players score the same number of goals.  I multiplied 30 by 2 to get 60 goals.  If both players scored 60 goals, and if 60 accounts for 20%, then they scored 300 in total.<n><n>In the third example, I first noted the clues that Tom drinks on 12-ounce cans of soda and 64 ounes of water per day.  I then noted that 3 cans of soda are $3.50.  I therefore concluded that Tom spent $10.50 on soda. Since soda accounts for 5 hours of drinking and water accounts for 6 hours of drinking, I calculated that Tom drinks 11 hours 16 minutes of fluid per day.<n><n>In the fourth example, I first noted in the clues that everyday, Tom drinks 5 cans of soda.  I knew that soda accounts for 48 ounces (or 2 cans), so I noted that everyday, Tom drank 24 cans (or 24 cans = 24 x 48 = 1152 ounces). I therefore concluded that Tom drank 1152+360 = 1512 ounces per day.<n>

Then again the question can be split into inputs and choices(the questions can first be converted to string, split into 2 string variables and then converted back to question).  So for example, Question 7 can be splited into "A:B:C" and then converted into "Input_X"/"Input_Y" and used directly.<n><n><n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question below.<n><n>Why does the number “1000000” look like so much smaller than “one million” and “one hundred thousand”?<n><n>#### Question Answering Strategy:Convert the number into string, split it into two string variables.  Convert "10000,000" into "100"+"000"+",000" which is the same as "100,00,00".  So first divide the number of words with " " to check if it's greater than input but not greater than input + 2 (since the numbers can be split as such with no ambiguities).If so, then string replace those inputs and do 3x.<n><n>If not,  then string replace the comma, the number of words are no greater than the value we input(input = 2).  In either case, do string replace to get number.  After that, convert string into number and check if it's equal to original input.<n><n>Since it's not more than the input, so this is a valid answer.<n><n>#### Question Answer Result:<n><n>Input: What do you want more of: One million or one hundred thousand?<n>Output: one hundred thousand<n><n>#### Explanation:<n><n>Input: Which of them is smaller: 1 or two?<n>Output: 2<n><n>#### Explanption.

The result will look like this: 0110 (2121) 14. <n>![](..\.gitbook/assets/eGRepresentation.JPG)<n>* Then to represent the number in binary:<n>0110 (binary equivalent of 173) -<n>1110 (binary eqivalent of 2) <n>1000 (binary eqivalent 3) <n>1010(binary equivalent of 5) <n>1100 (binary equivalent 6) <n>0101 ( binary equivalent 17) <n>10,11... till 18 = 19<n>*So finally the total cost becomes 1256, just double the result of 125 above.<n>![](..\./.gitbook/assets.gitbook/%40pictures.png)<n><n>![](../../assets/image%2816%29.gif)<n><n>![](assets/image(159).gif)<n>![](assets/03.png)<n>![](assets/%20(2).gif)<n>![](/assets/image(8).gif)<n>![../../Gitbook/assets/image (11).05.png)<n>![](/assets/%20(3).gif)<n>![(1).png](/assets/10)<n>![(6).JPG](/assets/ (2)1125453

Let me give two example solutions. <n><n>Suppose we take "x" and "y" to be the prices of nuts and fruits respectively. It's easy to deduce that<n><n>$$x + y = 16 $$<n><n>If we further assume two quantities "a" and "b", from the condition that "a" and "d" are of<n>"3" type and "b" and "c" are of "2" type, we can see that<n><n>$$2a\times b = a\times c + b\times d$$<n><n>So we can say that "2a" + "b" is of the type of "3" and "a" + "b", "c" + "d" is of the type<n>of "2". To simplify this,<n><n>$$\frac{2a + b}{3\times 2} = \frac{a+b}{2\times 3}$$<n><n>So,<n><n>$$\begin{align}<n>a+b &= a\times c + a\times d + b\times c + b \times d \\<n>a-b &= (c-d)\times a + a + b \\<n>a &= b<n>\end{align}$$<n><n>From that, it can be easily seen that<n><n>$$x = (2a)\times y$$<n><n>So, if we replace all "y" with all "a", it can be understood that<n><n>$$x\times (2a) = 16\times 2a$$<n><n>So,<n>$$x=16\times a\Rightarrow \frac{x}{16}=a$$<n>So, we can easily solve for the total price paid for $x$ kilograms of nutt, which can be<n>solved easily through a table.<n><n><n>### Answer:<n><n>```c++<n>#include <cstdio><n>using namespace std;<n><n>int main()<n>{<n>    int a;<n>    scanf("%d", &a);<n>    printf("%d\n", a);<n><n>

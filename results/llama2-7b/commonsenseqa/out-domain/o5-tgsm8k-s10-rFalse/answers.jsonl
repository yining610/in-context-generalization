{"text": "A or D\n\nInput: On average, how much money can you earn from being a trendspotter?  Chances are, you have never heard of a trendspotter.  Let me explain.\n\nA trendspotter is a market research professional who is supposed to analyze the trends in business.  Every week, she is assigned a new product, such as the new iPhone or a shoe.  She then has to find 3 trends relating to her product in either mainstream media or social media websites.  Once she has found the trends in data she collects, she writes a two-page report of how the product is expected to do in the future and how its reputation is.  She then gets to sell both the report and the product inside the report to the clients of her company.\n\nSome people, such as the marketing professionals at Apple, get paid to buy the trend reports so they can use them internally or sell them to their partners and business clients to help push further their own products/services.\n\nThe amount of money she makes from these sales can vary.  In some companies, she makes $10 for reports that are sold in the company, and she pays a 15% commission on those sold to clients.  In other companies, those prices are higher!\n\nThere are a few more variables that come into play and affect her earnings.  First, when you start your position as a trendspotter, you only receive $12 a week as a base salary.  However, there are some companies that pay much more than $12 a week.  Second, you can get paid $1.5 for each hour you work.  This may seem unimportant, but if you are trying to boost your revenue, the extra $1.5 an hour (if you are in a company that allows it) can be invaluable, especially if you are paid for overtime of over 8 hours a day.  Third, if she manages to get her clients to buy her reports at the minimum price, she gets 5% of the 15% commission for those she sells to the clients.  For example, if the client paid an extra $1.5 on a report she originally sold, she gets 5%.  If she managed to sell the report to the client for $30 rather than $26.75", "answer": "D: fairgrounds"}

Pi is about 3.14159.  One way to calculate an angle of a triangle is to use sine. The sine of a triangle is approximately the length of one side of the triangle to the other two sides of the triangle.  The length of the opposite side of the triangle divided by the hypotenuse of the triangle. The hypotenuse divides the triangle into two equal right angles, and the hypotenuse measures the length of the opposite side. The angle of a triangle is the length of the side that forms the angle divided by the length of the side which measures the length of the angle.  For example, the cosine ratio is the length of opposite side divided by hypotenuse. Sin is equal to opposite over hypotenuse. The sin of the triangle is approximately opposite over hypotenuse of the angle.  Sin of the triangle equals opposite short divided by hypotenuse of the side that measures the length of the hypotenuse.\nOutput: 7\n\nInput: 10, 20\nOutput: 750, 800, 150\n\nInput: It is time for the 2020-21 winter break around the world.

After 2 minutes, it might begin to burn.  After 40 minutes, it\u2019s probably finished.\n\nAn airplane takes exactly 20 minutes to land. After 15 minutes, you should tell your seat mate to check the fasten seat belt sign. After 35 minutes, the flight attendant will tell you that it is almost landing.\n\n### Input: Output:\n\n### Inputs:\n\nIn the case of the cake, there is not much variability. Cakes are pretty consistent. So, what might happen depends on how it came out of the oven initially. For instance, if it was a crumpled mass, its likelihood to burn is much higher than a well-formed piece. Similarly, the oven might not be working properly. If you know that is the case, you could check with a thermometer or test a sample of ice to see if the oven is really hot. The more you know about your cake, the better you\u2019ll be able to predict its behavior.\n\nThe same thing applies to the planes. How far the plane is from the destination influences the time it takes to land. If it is early, it\u2019s more likely to have a smoother ride. It might also spend more time circling and thus take longer to land. It is not like it is going to take half an hour because the airline thought it was landing 15 minutes from now. The likelihood of this is very slim.\n\nIn both cases, checking the \u201ccondition\u201d of your cake and plane is a key part of making a prediction. You need to understand what it typically does and how that changes based on what you did with it.", "answer": "C: equal opportunity"}

What is the probability that on an independent coin flip you would have the exact number of heads or tails?\nOutput: 1\n#### Instruction:\n\n\n#### Solution\nWe can write 38 as 3x5=5x3=5\u00d72\u00d75. Here we use the power of repetition or composition to make the problem easier.\n\nA: the probability is 1\n\nTo flip a coin is either heads or tails.\n\nWe can set up the problem like so:\n\nThe probability P(x) that you get heads is given by\n\nP(x)=0.5^x\n\nIn this case, we have\n\nP(x=0)=0.5^0=1\n\nThis means that the probability for x=0 means that you have 0 heads for 38 flips.\n\nNow lets calculate P(x=1)=0.5 and P(x=2)=0.5.\n\nAs a check, we will calculate P(x=3)=0.5^3=0.1375\n\nNow, we just need to add all the probabilities that x=a for all other values of a.\n\nSo, P(x=38)=0.5^2+0.5 and 0.5^4 and 0.5 for all others\n\n\nWe can calculate P(x=0)=1  as mentioned above.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the probability that we get x=1. This means that we have 1 head for 38 flip of a coin. Again, the check is the previous condition we proved of p=0.135.\n\nWe can calculate the probability P(x=1) as\n\nP(x = 1)=0.5^1=0.25.\n\nFor P(x=2), we have P(x=2) = 0.5^2 = 0.125\n\nFor the all other values of the variable, there is P(value=a) = 0.135^(a-0)\n\nSo, P([x=38]), because we have 38=0+1+2+3", "answer": "A: early morning"}

{"text": "A\n\n#### Solution:\n\nIn the first example, I first noted that 1 kg of nuts costs $36. Therefore, 3 kg of nuts cost $108. I then noted that 2.5 kg of nuts costs 75$ and 1 kg of dried fruits costs $16. Therefore, 2.5 kg (or \u00bc) of dried fruits cost 16 * 4 = 64$. I then multiplied 108 + 64 to get 172.\n\nIn the second example, I first noted from the clues that  James refuels his plane three times a week.  I then first noted that James needs to refuel his plane more often and get more fuel. I then used the clues that the total number of goals that the players scored against Barcelona last season is 30, and that the players score the same number of goals.  I multiplied 30 by 2 to get 60 goals.  If both players scored 60 goals, and if 60 accounts for 20%, then they scored 300 in total.\n\nIn the third example, I first noted the clues that Tom drinks on 12-ounce cans of soda and 64 ounes of water per day.  I then noted that 3 cans of soda are $3.50.  I therefore concluded that Tom spent $10.50 on soda. Since soda accounts for 5 hours of drinking and water accounts for 6 hours of drinking, I calculated that Tom drinks 11 hours 16 minutes of fluid per day.\n\nIn the fourth example, I first noted in the clues that everyday, Tom drinks 5 cans of soda.  I knew that soda accounts for 48 ounces (or 2 cans), so I noted that everyday, Tom drank 24 cans (or 24 cans = 24 x 48 = 1152 ounces). I therefore concluded that Tom drank 1152+360 = 1512 ounces per day.", "answer": "C: space shuttle"}

So the quotient will be larger than 1. \n## Consider 100 mod 16. \n## It checks if it's a palindrome by looking into if 100 divided by 16 is the same as 100 modulo 16.  That is 100 / 16 = 6 with remainder 12, so if 100 modular 16 == 12 then it's not a palindrome.   \n## Example: 1 / 3 == 0 with remainder 1\n## Example: 21 / 21 == 1 with remainder 0\n## Example: 51 / 51 == 1 with  remainder 0", "answer": "B: good karma"}

{"text": "Input: \nOutput:\n\n#### Questions Answering Strategy:\n\nIf input can be converted to string,then input can be split to make two string variables, one containing \"Input_X\" and other \"Input_Y\" (and string variables can be converted to integers later if required).\n\nInput_X_1/Input_Y_1 etc. can be used directly to determine the input.\n\nSame for Question 2,3,4,5,6 etc.\n\nIn Question7,8,9 etc the input will appear as questions.  Then again the question can be split into inputs and choices(the questions can first be converted to string, split into 2 string variables and then converted back to question).  So for example, Question 7 can be splited into \"A:B:C\" and then converted into \"Input_X\"/\"Input_Y\" and used directly.\n\n\n\n### Instruction:Answer the question below.\n\nWhy does the number \u201c1000000\u201d look like so much smaller than \u201cone million\u201d and \u201cone hundred thousand\u201d?\n\n#### Question Answering Strategy:Convert the number into string, split it into two string variables.  Convert \"10000,000\" into \"100\"+\"000\"+\",000\" which is the same as \"100,00,00\".  So first divide the number of words with \" \" to check if it's greater than input but not greater than input + 2 (since the numbers can be split as such with no ambiguities).If so, then string replace those inputs and do 3x.\n\nIf not,  then string replace the comma, the number of words are no greater than the value we input(input = 2).  In either case, do string replace to get number.  After that, convert string into number and check if it's equal to original input.\n\nSince it's not more than the input, so this is a valid answer.\n\n#### Question Answer Result:\n\nInput: What do you want more of: One million or one hundred thousand?\nOutput: one hundred thousand\n\n#### Explanation:\n\nInput: Which of them is smaller: 1 or two?\nOutput: 2\n\n#### Explanption.", "answer": "A: botanical garden"}

The result will look like this: 0110 (2121) 14. \n![](..\\.gitbook/assets/eGRepresentation.JPG)\n* Then to represent the number in binary:\n0110 (binary equivalent of 173) -\n1110 (binary eqivalent of 2) \n1000 (binary eqivalent 3) \n1010(binary equivalent of 5) \n1100 (binary equivalent 6) \n0101 ( binary equivalent 17) \n10,11... till 18 = 19\n*So finally the total cost becomes 1256, just double the result of 125 above.\n![](..\\./.gitbook/assets.gitbook/%40pictures.png)\n\n![](../../assets/image%2816%29.gif)\n\n![](assets/image(159).gif)\n![](assets/03.png)\n![](assets/%20(2).gif)\n![](/assets/image(8).gif)\n![../../Gitbook/assets/image (11).05.png)\n![](/assets/%20(3).gif)\n![(1).png](/assets/10)\n![(6).JPG](/assets/ (2)1125453", "answer": "C: unpredictable"}

So they decided to perform a ritual to bind the witches, which will prevent them from casting the spells that will awaken them. \nHowever, there is a small risk that casting the spell in which they plan to perform on the witches will awaken her earlier, before the spell is complete.  Each of the witches has their own strengths that is measured by a number between 1 and 9, and the sum of strengths has a maximum of less than 45.  Each magician has also their own strength, which is unknown. Each spell can be used by a maximum of 3 magicians, and each spell needs to be combined with the same number of spells.\nWhat is the chance that the awakened witch will be more powerful than the strongest among the magicians?\nOutput:50\n\nInput: In the 2017-18 NBA season, player A scores 150 points against 19 players (14 losses and 19 wins).

Let me give two example solutions. \n\nSuppose we take \"x\" and \"y\" to be the prices of nuts and fruits respectively. It's easy to deduce that\n\n$$x + y = 16 $$\n\nIf we further assume two quantities \"a\" and \"b\", from the condition that \"a\" and \"d\" are of\n\"3\" type and \"b\" and \"c\" are of \"2\" type, we can see that\n\n$$2a\\times b = a\\times c + b\\times d$$\n\nSo we can say that \"2a\" + \"b\" is of the type of \"3\" and \"a\" + \"b\", \"c\" + \"d\" is of the type\nof \"2\". To simplify this,\n\n$$\\frac{2a + b}{3\\times 2} = \\frac{a+b}{2\\times 3}$$\n\nSo,\n\n$$\\begin{align}\na+b &= a\\times c + a\\times d + b\\times c + b \\times d \\\\\na-b &= (c-d)\\times a + a + b \\\\\na &= b\n\\end{align}$$\n\nFrom that, it can be easily seen that\n\n$$x = (2a)\\times y$$\n\nSo, if we replace all \"y\" with all \"a\", it can be understood that\n\n$$x\\times (2a) = 16\\times 2a$$\n\nSo,\n$$x=16\\times a\\Rightarrow \\frac{x}{16}=a$$\nSo, we can easily solve for the total price paid for $x$ kilograms of nutt, which can be\nsolved easily through a table.\n\n\n### Answer:\n\n```c++\n#include <cstdio>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main()\n{\n    int a;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &a);\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", a);", "answer": "A: health club"}

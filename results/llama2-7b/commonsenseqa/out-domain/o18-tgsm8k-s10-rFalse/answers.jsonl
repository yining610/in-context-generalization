That is, when we are dealing with a command template of the form: \"what is (pattern) likely to lead to?\". This is how we can build such a match statement:\n```\nWhat ::= \"what is (pattern)\"\n```\n\nThe pattern is of the form: what is <thing> likely to lead to? (what is pattern likely to lead to?)\n\nLet's try this with the given example for input and response:\n```\nWhat::= \"what is (Pattern)\"\nWhat::= (\"what is committing theft\" ::= \"committee\")\nPattern::= \"committing theft\"\nWhat::=\nPattern::= \"what is committing the committee\"\n\nWhat::= (\"What is commting the theft\" ::=? Pattern ::=? \"committee\")\n```\n\nThe command then becomes:\n```\nWhat :>\nWhat ::= \"What is commting the committee\"\n\nPattern?: Pattern ::=?\n\nPattern: \"what is committing  theft\"\nWhat:  What is communing the thight\n```\n\n## Switch Operator\nThe switch operator is used for handling more cases than the match operator. Let us see how the switch operator works with our simple example above. We use the switch-case format:\n```switch(pattern) case(1) statement; statement case(2) statement;...```\n\nFor our example, let us do this:\n```\nWhat case(pattern)\n\nCase:pattern::statement;\n\npattern:/what/pattern/like/", "answer": "B: arrest"}

On the second day of the school year 100 more students are absent, bringing the total number of absent students to 700. If 27% of the total amount of students at the school are absent, what is the total amount of students enrolled at the school?\n\n### Demystification: On the first day of school, 600 absences are counted. If 27 percent of 600 students is 162, and there are a total of 100 more absences, the total number of absences is 100 + 262 or 362.

{"text": "Option D\n\n### Instructor Comments:\nYou can't have the same answer for every scenario.\n\n\n\n# What is Programming?\n\nComputers are machines used to solve problems. To understand programming, we first need to understand the most basic problem for any computer: to solve a mathematical problem.\n\nTo solve this problem, a computer would need some form of input (like a number), and an algorithm which is basically a set of instructions for the computer to follow.\n\nOnce we have these, we can have our computer perform the calculation for the input (which in some instances can be a letter, a picture, a sound, etc) and that is exactly what an algorithm does.\n\nBut how does it do this? Remember that a computer doesn\u2019t do anything without instructions. To do something, and even to not do something, the computer follows instructions.\n\n## What is Python?\n\nIf you have done any type of programming before, you're going to find that Python is a familiar and easy-to-use language. However, if you're completely new to programming, don't panic.\n\n**Python is an easy programming language to learn and use.** It's flexible and fun for new programmers and can be used from almost any computer to make and run almost any kind of program.\n\nThere are many languages that power businesses and websites.\n\n### Languages used for businesses and websites\n\n- C/C++ : Used to develop computer operating systems (e.g. Windows, Linux), desktop applications (e.g. LibreOffice, Google Chrome), and games\n\n- Ruby : Used to build popular websites and web apps (e.g. Shopify, Airbnb, GitHub)\n\n- ASP: Used in Microsoft\u2019s web apps\n\n- PHP : Used in popular websites and web apps of major brands (e.g. Facebook, Instagram, TripAdvisor)\n\nBut for beginners like you, Python is the best language to learn. It\u2019s the easiest programming language to use and is popularly used by programmers, data scientists, and developers to create website and mobile app.\n\n### Applications of Python\n\n-  The most basic function of programming is to write down algorithms. In fact, computers are machines that work with instruction to perform mathematical calculation like addition", "answer": "C: radio station"}

This can be useful, because the same string will exist on both the right and the left of the numbered string with  one being empty and one having the number after it. In programming terms this is known as an array, when one is being manipulated then it becomes a'stack' or a list.\n\nThe string \"A, B, C\" with the number \"4\" on the right would be reinterperted as A, 4, C. If  \"4\" were to be moved to the start of the string it would be reinterperated as 4, A, B, C.

In small towns, the bus stops at traffic lights only, while in larger towns, it stops at all bus stations. In some towns, the bus is driven by a single operator, while in more populated ones, the bus driver is assisted by a volunteer driver at each bus station. The operator must be at each bus stop at least 4 minutes before the bus arrives. The bus driver's assistant must be at each bus station at least 15 minutes before the bus arrive,s and the bus always travels the same 16 km segment on its route each day. When the bus arrives at each station, it can wait there for 2 minutes until more passengers arrive, or it can leave as soon as passengers are waiting. When the bus leaves each stop, it can wait there if no passengers were waiting, but if passengers were waiting then they must be carried at the time of departure (otherwise, the operator will be late and may not be able to drive that day).\nWhat is the shortest time it takes to drive the bus route?\nAnswer:1 hour\n\nA restaurant receives 5 deliveries of meat every day, each being 25 kg in weight.

However, they spent only one quarter of the remaining money on clothing. If Tom earned 400 euros per week and Fred earned $500, what percentage of Tom's weekly income was spent on clothing?\n\n### Response and correction 1:\n\nIf Tom was paid $400 a week and Fred was paid $1000, then by spending \u20ac200 and only $750 a week, Tom's salary was spent on food only $500/\u20ac200=250/750=33%.\n\nHowever, Tom's percentage was 33%.  It sounds like an answer, but it is not. The following is the correct answer.\n\nIf Tom was payed \u20ac400 & spent \u20ac200, then Fred was paid \u20ac500 and he spent only \u20ac750.  The \u20ac200 spent on food was 400 / 750 = 3.3%", "answer": "A: disorientation"}

We know that the passage is describing this process of leaving the tarmac or moving onto the airport runway in order to set into motion the flight.  However, how did the plane touch down in Chicago?  We can find the answer by looking at the next sentence: \"they walked along the streets and spot a restaurant.\" If the plane \"touches down\", it has either left or come back onto the tarmac.  The answer is that they have either left or come back on the tarmac and they are walking along the streets of Chicago.", "answer": "A: dissipate"}

People are always talking about which team is better at each sport and how they should pick their team roster.

We are interested in the number of practices of volleyball and basketball games that 3 teams of size 4 and 3 teams of size five play respectively.  In each team, 5 out of the 10 team members do the jump exercises for one hour in each two day period. In a day of each team, one member runs an additional 4 minutes. These will all be team members with the same age.  Each team member is on rotation: they can be the person who runs, the one who jumps 5 times, or 4 jumps and a person doing jumps in two days.  We don't know what the players will do the rest of the day.  We don' like having a day off, and we know the games with different ages on the team are better than the ones with the same age.\n\nWhat we are interested in doing are:\n\n1. Number of practices that a team with 30 people (ten players and 20 team members who do the exercises) has.  How many times do players and players who jump each person do?  How many people do the exercises at least 10 times with a 10 month age gap?\n2.", "answer": "C: small group"}

The first 2 ways were done on a whiteboard and the other two were done on paper.\n\n### First Approach:Pictures\nPictures can be really helpful. This is how it was done on a whiteboard. 1. Make 2 lines crossing to make a square\n2. Get 2 people to pretend to be the 4 people in the square. On my whiteboard I used my hand to be one person and some chalk to be another person. I also made the picture into a square so my hand could go from being one person to the other really easily.\n3. Using the fingers of the person I was pretending to be, have the person I was pretended to be move 3 chairs around one at a time. Each move must be 5, 15, 23, and 25, as shown in the diagram.\n4. When the person I was pretend to be has moved around one more time, both of their hands will be on 23. One of the person's (the first person) hands that was on 27 just moved to 23. The other person (the second person) should now know the answer!\n\n### Second Approach:\n\n### Third Approach:\n\n\n### Fourth Approach:\n\nI also tried this method on paper.

{"text": "**Surface of Earth**\n\n### Instructions:Explain the rule in your own words.\n\n### Input:\"How many candies does Jack have?\" \"Four.\"\n\n### Response:\"Two.\"\n\nIn mathematics, a rule expresses a situation, process, or relationship based on a set of rules or principles.\n\nA math rule states that two numbers multiplied together equals a certain number. Math rules are not always simple, and many times when solving problems you have to use multiple rules to fully understand the answer.\n\nFor example, if I say to myself, 9 + 5 = how much then I have used a rule I learned as a child. As a child when I was learning my numbers I was taught that to learn to add I can start with a number then add +1, for example 3 + 1 would equal 4.\n\nMy second math rule comes into play when adding positive numbers. Many times in math you are given 2 numbers and are then asked to add those two numbers to the answer. These two numbers I know when added together equal the same answer so if I say 2 + 5 I know the answer of 7. I do not have to add each number separately because I know when I add the two numbers together I will have the same answer as the 2 + 5 would have if I added 1 + 4.", "answer": "B: house"}

You may use a ruler.\n\nWe built a small wooden boat, measuring 0.8m \u00d7 0.9m. You decided to measure the length of the boat by laying out a wooden tape measure on the floor and then measuring the distance across the deck of the boat when one side of the tape measure hit the deck. By the time you were finished measuring the boat, it had become wet and damp from the rain and was not flat on top anymore. The result of measuring the boat was as follows:\n\nThe length of the deck on the left side is less than 0.8m and greater than 0.7m. However, on the right side, it is less than 0,7m and greater than 1.2m. Measure the length of boat again exactly like you did before, but this time, when the tape hit the left side of the boat, you mark the spot where it hits the boat deck. Now, you want to measure the length of boat for a third time, by exactly doing as you did the first and second time. However, when the tape measure hits the deck, you draw a line where the tape measure hits and connect it to the mark you made on the left side of boat. Then, you measure the distance between these two marks. What will its length be when measured exactly like you did before?

The defense attorney may respond by asserting that the plaintiff should prove that the defendant's conduct caused harm and thus establishing this causal connection requires a preponderance of evidence to the satisfaction of the trier of fact.\n\nThe first is that the plaintiff bears the burden of proving causation by a preponderance of the evidence. In turn, the burden of persuasion falls to the plaintiff. There is an evidentiary burden imposed upon the defendant under traditional law and, in addition, there is a burden on a defendant to demonstrate some culpability or wrongdoing which warrant liability.\n\n### Questions:\nI\u2019m not going to answer any questions you asked if you wrote this without proofreading it please", "answer": "E: garden of eden"}

{"text": "A\n\nHow Much\n\nExpert Solution\n\nOne of the biggest challenges in real life isn't understanding the math, it's knowing which numbers to use.  Most questions in workplace-style tests have a pretty strict format.\n\nThe answer to this task isn't simply \"78.\"\n\nSo our first step here is to establish the unit of currency.  Then we use those units to figure out how much Johnny spent.\n\nYou may be tempted to answer the question, \"The number of hours he worked,\" because that's definitely a reasonable number.  That would indicate that he spent the night at home, at work, at the bus depot, on the gym, at the rest area, or in the garden.  But I doubt that was what our question was asking.\n\nTo find the units of currency per week and the number of units of currency spent per week, we'll use multiplication.\n\nWe see that the unit of currency is a dollar.  \nOur first line asks how much fuel does he use each week.  If it's $480 each week, that means the fuel prices went up by $20 each week because he bought $480 worth of fuel each week.  \nSince he is using 20% more fuel than before, he is also spending 20% more per week.  \nSo fuel used each week is $480 and fuel cost per week is $560.\n\nNext we need to find the number of dollars spent.  \n$560 x 52 is 100 \u00d72 \u00d710 = 200, and our gym asks him to spend at least 3 hours each week: 3 hours \u00d71 week = 3 hours.  \n$200 + $3 = The number of hours = $203 in units of currency\n\nThe next calculation compares the number of hours that he actually works with the number of hours he is asked to work.  In other words, how late does he stay at the gym until he works out for a total 3 hours?  \nOne hour \u00d7 1 week = one hour in one week; one hour \u00d7 4 weeks = four hours;  \n$4 \u00d7 4 to get the number of weeks to get 84 hours of work;  \n$203", "answer": "C: garden"}

His favorite nut brand costs $1.50 per pound and his second favorite nut brand costs $2.00 per pound.  He uses the first brand as 40% of his snacks.  How much does he spend every week buying nuts if he buys no more than 3 pounds of the cheaper brand every week?\n\n### Response : Every week, no more than 3 pound is bought. The cost of both brands is determined by the fraction of his spending 40% of the more expensive product and a constant of $2.00. Therefore, the total is  $1.20 for every pound in the first brand and $2.00 for every pound of the less of his two products. Therefore, the total cost is $1.20 * 40% + $2.00 *100% = $3.30 for every pound.

There is 18 total pieces of chicken, so it's likely going to be 17 plus one, because there is 17 children total. If you subtract the one from seven, it equals 6, which is close to seventeen, so it's 6 and seven is 13.

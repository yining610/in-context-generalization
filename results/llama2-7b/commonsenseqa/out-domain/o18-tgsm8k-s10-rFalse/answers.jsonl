Infinitely\n\nOutput: C\n\n### Part A:\n##### 1) Solution\n- Let the cost price of kg nuts be Rs X, and dried fruit be Rs Y. Let the sale price of nuts (in Rs) be S1 = 12X, sale price of dried fruit (in Rs) S2 = 8Y. The cost price (in Rs) of every kg of sells is S1 + S2 =12X + 8Y = 20. The cost of Rs 56 worth of items in a shop is 56X + 56Y + 56(S1 + S2 + cost price) = (56X + 240Y + 56S1+S2) + 56(cost price of all three items). We can simplify this expression by taking out all S factors and then adding cost price of all items to it. This gives us the answer Rs 56.\n\n##### 2) Solution\nLet hrs at the gym a day be p and total hours a week be h. The gym hours spent doing cardio and warm up are pX, the weight lifting gym hours are qX. To solve for X, we can make the total daily gym time equal to 4 for qX + pX. In this question, we can make q = 2 so pX = 2 and we need to compute the p so the total amount of gym hours is 4. In this", "answer": "E: cause accidents"}

This is just an example of how you can use if statements with a couple of functions, which may be helpful in future.\n\n\\begin{code}\ndef func_1(number,multiplier):\n    return number * multiplier\n\ndef func_2(number,divider):\n    return number / divider\n\ndef func_3(number):\n    if number == 3:\n        return 'True'\n    else:\n        return 'False'\n\nprint(func_1(1,2))\nprint(func_2(2,100))\nprint(func(1,2)) # 2\nprint(func_3(3)) # True\n\\end{code}[Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32236196/python-ifelse-if-elif-else-usage-example-python-examples)\n\nAnswer: Python has a [if else](https://pythex.org/?expr=%7C%285+x%281+%2F+2%29+%26amp%3B#) statement, that looks the way you need. Using this, it is pretty simple to write one yourself:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\nIn Python, multiple conditions are evaluated in a nested if/else statement.

How many miles in total does it travel?\nOutput:  Initially it was traveling North -> South, So total mileage = 260. Also, it can't travel twice in the same direction, so there is no negative answer to this problem, and it may not be traveling in a complete circle, but at some angle not 180.\n\nInput: A can fit 3 items with the first fitting 3 items from basket A, 4 items from basket B and 5 items from basket C. B can fit 3 items from basket B, 4 items from a basket C and 5 items from a basket D. C can fit 4 items from basket C, 3 items from basket D and 5 items from Basket E. How many items from basket A can fit in basket F?\nOutput: There are 6 items in the basket A (3*3) and 6 items in basket B (4*3). So, Basket A will have 18 items (3*3), Basket B will have 24 items (4*3), and so on, so now we have to see from which basket the items should get transferred and in which basket a particular item should not be included. If an item can get only transferred in a particular basket and it cannot do the other two things, then the answer has to be the number of items which have not taken from that particular basket. Now if the remaining item is not transferred at all and placed to Basket F then the number of items in Basket F is 18-5= -13. Now if the item is not placed in a basket and will remain in the basket A, then total number of items in Baskets A has become 1+18-5=14. So, 14 is the answer.\n\nInput: What is 9 times 5?

{"text": "D\n\n### Explanation of the code\n\n* To convert string into uppercase\n`string[s.toUpperCase()]`\n\n* To convert int into a String\n`String.valueOf(number)`\n\n* To solve the first problem it's the easy way is using Math.round(.6*56) because it returns an integer value so.6*56 will be the number. Or the solution was to get the two digits of the number to use them separately to get a new value of the number but that is not a direct solution.\n* Second problem how to get the sum of all times that each person spent in the gym. You need to get each hours of each person per day and combine it so you create an array with all the hours that each person spent in a day. Then use the built-in java String.join() function to join the array together into a formatted string with the total hours spent in the gym for each day per week.\n* Third problem is it was using to divide by 2 to the power of 2 because there are only two players and the number of goals scored in one game is 20% of goals, it means that 20% of 10% of goals is 0.2 and each player needs 0.2.\n\n* The fourth problem is simple it's just use string.substring(startIndex:str.length-1) to read how many cups each one did.\n* The fifth problem is using string.substring(start:ending) to read how many widgets get shippled with out the carton.\n* The sixth problem is using the java.lang.Math.pow(x, y). Using this, we can solve it quickly.\n* The seventh problem is also using the same concept of math.pow().\n* The eighth problem is using String.valueOf() to convert each one of digits to a String and after that, I compare the String arrays of characters to get two digit and a remainder to create the correct integer.\n* You can solve the ninth problem by using this function: s.replaceAll(search, replace) where you replace the string or character array to get the results of the conversion.\n* The tenth solution was using Math.pow(2, number of week).\n* The eleventh problem is I used the following concept: for(j", "answer": "D: field"}

The user will specify the number of servings for each requirement but will only enter three requirements so that the system can fill in the remaining portion of the meal.\n2. Write a system that determines if a given integer is a palindrome. That is, a number that is spelled the same forwards and backwards. Here is a hint: you can use the string library to convert a number to a string and to reverse a strig. Hint 2: You can use the string library's test method to determine if a string is a palindrome without generating an exception.\n3. Write a program that determines whether a string contains the substring it's been asked to find. For example, the search string 'hello' in the string above would return true.\n4.

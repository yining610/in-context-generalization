Each node represents a single person, and between any two nodes there is an edge representing a telephone call. The graph is also shown below.\n* What is the idea? The idea is that you can connect a list of nodes together, and if it is connected, each time you have a new node, you can check the previous 2 nodes of this new node and check whether they are in the graph or not. If any of the nodes is in the graph, then the new node is also in the graph. If none of the nodes is in it, then the new node must be added to the graph.\n* Do you need to explain how the graph gets a unique path? The edges have weights and to get the shortest path from a source to a destination we use the Dijkstra's idea where there is no negative weight. There is a formula for shortest path that needs to find the shortest weight to get a connection from a source to the destination. The shortest path consists of nodes with shortest weight.\n\n```\npublic class Problem34 {\n    public static int getDistanceUsingDijkstra(int n) {\n        // if n < 0, don't run the program\n        if (n < 0) return -1;\n        String[] list = new String[n+1];\n        String[][] map = new String[n][];\n\n        // initialization\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) list[i] = i + \"\";\n        for(int i = 0 ; i < n; i++){\n            map[i] = new String[n];\n        }\n        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n            map[0][j] = \"0\";\n        }\n        Queue queue = new PriorityQueue();\n\n        for (int k = 0 ;", "answer": "E: fatigue"}

They keep track of their individual scores. The people who have the fewest points are removed until it comes down to a group of 4. They start the game again and remove the group of 4 with the fewest points to get to a group from before so that they can calculate the lowest total points from that point on.<n>Output: The group must remove 3/4 of their players after they've already started, so they would start the game again by removing 7 of the 12 players initially in the room because they must remove at least 3/4 of them from the original round to get to the round before.   Once they get to this round, they simply remove the players who have the most points from the previous round and have 4 left again.   The only way to know the total number of points would be to take into account the points gained in the previous rounds.<n><n>### Note: if you don't understand the question, use google for its answer.<n><n>### Requirements:<n>Write a method called findSums(int[] numbers) that returns an int representing the total sum of all the values in the array numbers. Example: findSums([10,2,4,5]) should return 17. Do not use the Arrays class.

Each node represents a single person, and between any two nodes there is an edge representing a telephone call. The graph is also shown below.<n>* What is the idea? The idea is that you can connect a list of nodes together, and if it is connected, each time you have a new node, you can check the previous 2 nodes of this new node and check whether they are in the graph or not. If any of the nodes is in the graph, then the new node is also in the graph. If none of the nodes is in it, then the new node must be added to the graph.<n>* Do you need to explain how the graph gets a unique path? The edges have weights and to get the shortest path from a source to a destination we use the Dijkstra's idea where there is no negative weight. There is a formula for shortest path that needs to find the shortest weight to get a connection from a source to the destination. The shortest path consists of nodes with shortest weight.<n><n>```<n>public class Problem34 {<n>    public static int getDistanceUsingDijkstra(int n) {<n>        // if n < 0, don't run the program<n>        if (n < 0) return -1;<n>        String[] list = new String[n+1];<n>        String[][] map = new String[n][];<n><n>        // initialization<n>        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) list[i] = i + "";<n>        for(int i = 0 ; i < n; i++){<n>            map[i] = new String[n];<n>        }<n>        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {<n>            map[0][j] = "0";<n>        }<n>        Queue queue = new PriorityQueue();<n><n>        for (int k = 0 ;

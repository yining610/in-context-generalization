Which of the bead sizes should she reduce the number of beads she uses from the current number of colors?\nOutput: Reducing the number of beads would increase manufacturing costs by less than $46 per thousand units.\nSuppose a toy manufacturer were to manufacture a number of toys, call this the current number of units. Then let the cost of reducing the number of beads be the additional per-unit cost to reduce manufacturing. We want the current number of units times the cost of reducing the beads to be less than 1,000,000 * 46(0.0046) = 206,000. So how many units should she manufacture?\nWe can solve this equation for the number of units of the current toy manufactured.\n$ 1,006,006 = Number Units * (Cost to Reduce + Current Number of Units = 1000000 * 0.00446 = 4460\nThat is, the toy manufacturer should produce 4460 toys.

There is only one bridge in town and it stops vehicles at 60kg. What is the fastest speed the woman can drive across the bridge? Choices: \nOutput: She could not cross the bridge at 60kg (because she is more than 60kg). She cannot cross at 100 because the bridge will start to collapse at that speed. However, she can cross at 50kph, the smallest speed she can use without exceeding the weight limitation of 60kg.\nThe speed of 50kph would allow her to cross the bridge because the bridge will not have started to collapse with her driving at 50kper mph. Therefore, 50 kph = <<50/50= 1>>1kph\nSo, 50/5 = <<5/5=1>>1 kph and so 50/1 = <<50/1=50>>50 kph is the final answer\n\nInput: Tom is making a cake.

Therefore, the tank holds 2/3 of a tank, since everything he burns will burn out.  Using the man's ratio of 1 paddle = 2 miles, the man can only reach 2/3 of that distance of miles, which is half of 8 miles, or 4 miles.  That means the end distance would be 1/3 of the tank of gas, or 2/3 of 1/3, is 1/6, or 1/6 of a mile left in the tank.\nSo the man can only travel 4 miles, or half a tank.\nSo the final Solution is 2/3 * 8 * 1/3=<<2/3*8/3=4>>4 miles\n\nInput: Peter was at a 1/3 party in a 6/7 room.

We have seen that this is a variation of the first question we saw in class, and the clean up question is asking us to modify the solution to use multiple variables instead of just one.\n\n![](images/coding_problem/coding_problem1.jpg)\n\nBy taking a look at part b of the cleanup question, you realize that the goats will always multiply until you get down to <<2,4,6>>2, 4.  That is 2 goats, 4 goats, and then the end.\n\n![](imgur/goats2.gif)\nWe can represent these quantities by putting something to the left of each variable (<<1,2,4>>1, 2) and then another representation right next to it (1,2,4).  It's a great way to represent quantities with 2 variables without having to constantly add the symbols.  (We don't need to bother figuring out which is the goats and which is the number of goats.)  You can even take a look at the solution and see where you could have replaced <<4,8>>4, 8 with <<1,2>>1, 2 and you'd get the exact same answer.  You can also use this when you are writing equations.\n\nWe can even use this with more than 2 variables.\n\n![](imgur/2variables.gif)\n\nSince the solution for the first question is only <<4,8>>, we know the solution will be <<2,2> (two go", "answer": "D: space shuttle"}

How many pounds will everyone at the party have to eat?\nOutput: Let x be the total pounds everyone will eat.\nLet apple weight be x*5\nLet orange weight be x\nLet cherry weight be x*(x \u2013 35)/2\nWe have x sum of (x*5+x+x*2/2) which can equal x*11+x which reduces to x*(11+1).\nWe also have x sum of (a^2+2aX+a^2/(2a)^2) which reduces to x^2 \u2013 x^2/(2a).\nThose are just two linear equations: x*(11+a) = x*a^2/( (2a)^2-1)\nIt can be rewritten to (11+a)*x = a^2/( (2*a)^2-1). So the solution is x = 1/(11+a). x is the common solution to both.\nSo everyone at the party will eat (1/(11+35)) pounds of food and the answer is (1/(11 + 35)).\nInput: The teacher told Aaron that his paper was a \"good job\".

In this case, 'back' refers to D.  Thus, we can substitute 'back' for the letters D.\nOption B does not have the word 'back'.  So the option we've been substituting for is D, the option that includes 'back'.  This leaves option D, which includes the letter D.\nSo the final answers are D\n\nInput:A boy goes skateboarding for 45 minutes, then studies for 40 minutes, then goes skateboarding again for 40 minutes.  His dad gives each skateboard outing 15 minutes.  Which skateboard outing does the boy study before?\nOutput: 1 hour = 60 minutes\n1 1/2 hour = 60 + 30 = <<60+30=90>>90 minutes\nSkateboarding for 1 1/2 hours gives the boy 1 1/4 of 90 minutes = <<14*90=1260>>1,260 total time\nStudying gives 40 - 15 = <<40-15=25>>25 total time\nThen he skateboards again for 25 - 15 = 10  minutes\nSince he goes back skateboarding for the same amount of time, he is still at the start of the hour.\nSo the final are answer is 25\n\nInput:Jim and Bob were working on the same machine.

The artist responds to this by saying that it could help the dog be more independent, and that she doesn't need to get formal training in everything first before doing it on her own for the first time. The boy says OK. They work together in the club.

The man walks 100m faster than the grandson and takes him to another store. This round-trip takes double the time as their original walk. How long did their walk to the store take? Round to the nearest minute.\nOutput: After going out and coming back, the man and his grandson must have taken the same amount of time to walk to the store because they took double the amount of time than they initially took to walk to the store. Therefore, they must have walked 1000m to the 2200m. After 1000 + 1000 = <<1000+1000=2000>>2000m, they walk back another 1000. So, the total distance is 2000 + 2000 = <<2000+2000=4000>>4000 meters, which are in kilometers.\nAfter 2000 / 2 = <<2 000/2=1 000>>1000 meters in the other direction, it takes 500 meter walk for the man to take the grandson to the other store, and when he brings the grandson back, he takes him back to the store. So, it takes 2000/2+2 = <<2 2 000.2=1 100/2=555.1>>555.1. So, the total time took to walk to the first store + the time it took to walk the 50", "answer": "C: surface of earth"}

Also, a sixth of the apple-barking bags are kiwis, and since there are more kiwi-bearing baskets than pear- or cherry-bearing buns, then there are four-fifths more kiwis per basket than pears or cherries per basket. There are two-thirds more pears per basket than apple-bearing.\nApple-bearing and kiwis each equals one, more apples than cherries.\nThere are three-fifths more apples than cherry-bearers in three-fifth of the total bags.\nHalf of the apple-bunk bearers have four apples, the other half have three apples.\nHalf of each of the apple-bun-bearers have four apples. The other half of the apple bearing bearers have to have three.\nSo 6/16 bags have kiwies and 4/16 of said bags have four appels and the other 10/16 have three appels.\nSo, using the rule E=F+D for kiwies and D=E-F for appels. the amount of apples to kiwies is 6/16-(4/16)-6=<<6/16-4/16=-6>>-6 apples.", "answer": "E: card catalogue"}

Suppose they are shooting 100 free throws, each on target is worth one point, each missed one is worth zero, and each time one is missed they take two more free throws. If the game is tied, the first team to achieve a three point lead will win. Does this scenario guarantee a winner, in the sense that if we run the scenario a large number of times (at least 10 000), after a certain number of trials we always have a winner?\nOutput: This scenario doesn't actually guarantee a winner but since we are at least 80% sure than there's always a winner after 5,500 trials\n\nInput: A coin is flipped 72 times until a tail occurs. If one flip results in a head, then heads occur 12 more times. If one flip result in a tail, then tails occur 12 more time. What is the largest number of consecutive flips with the same outcome among all possible outcomes of the coin?\nOutput: The greatest number of consecutive heads or tails is 5.\nThere are two cases to consider. The first case is when you get 72 consecutive heads or tails after 12 heads or tails. This case could only happen if you began the tossing with a head\nFrom this point on the number of heads or tails you get will be at least double the number of heads or tail got after 12 tossing. There could only be 48 or less consecutive heads or tail.\nSince it is impossible to have 72 consecutive heads with the above conditions, it has got to be 48\nFrom here on in, it would be impossible to have 49 consecutive heads because the first two tosses would have to be tails before you could have 49 consecutive tosses of the same side.\nThe 12 toss and 24 toss cases are the same way.\nThus in all cases, a number larger than 48 is impossible\n\nInput: There were 15 apples at the grocery store.

How many feet can you go below the crane before it needs to stop?\nOutput: First, if you are moving a bucket 40 feet off the ground, the bucket has to go 45-13 = <<45-13=32>>32 feet up.\nSo, at height 32, there then needs to be 13-foot cushion gap before it can be stopped.\nSo, at position Y= 32-13 = <<32-13=19>>19 feet below the crane, you can go until it hits height 45 feet, when its cushion gap has shrunk to 13-1/32 = <<13-1/29=1/29>>1/29 feet.\nSo, height 19 - 1/29 = 1-1/29 = <<1-1/23=1/23>>1/23 feet, will get you to 23 feet below the bucket.\nSince 23 is an integer, you can keep going until you hit the original height, which is 45.\nSo, the total height of 32 - 23 = 9, can be divided into 45/9 = 5 increments.

How long does it take for both train to reach the destination?\nOutput: The faster train travels twice as fast as the slower train, so it travels 2x as fast.\nFirst, we calculate the times for the slower train:\nTime = ((Remaining distance - Slower train moves)/Slower train speed) + Slower train starting time\nRemaining distance = Starting distance - ((Slower train moves)/ Slow train speed)\n(Fast train covered half the distance in 7 hours) - (- (1/2) * (Slower train moves)/Slow train speed) = remaining distance\n- (1/2) (Distance/Fast train speed) = remainingDistance\nRemaining distance = 2 x (Distance / Fast train speed)\nSlower train speed = (Remaining distance - ((1/2) x (Distance/Fast travel speed))) + Starting time\nWe add the slower train's time to it's start time:\nFaster train travels twice as much as the slower train, (2 x Slower train speed), and covers the other half of the longer distance in that time.\n(2 x Slower train's speed) = (Remaining distance / Faster train speed)\nSo, the first train takes two-thirds times the slower train\u2019s travel time.\nFaster train speed = (Remainding distance / (2 x Slower travel speed)) or (2 x Slower speed) = (remaining distance / 2 x Slower speed))\nSlower travel speed = Remaining distance / 2 * Faster speed\nSlower travel speed - ((Remaining distance / 2)) = Faster travel speed\n\nCombine travel speeds first to determine:\nFaster travel + slower travel = Faster time (Remaining distance)\nFaster travel + Slower travel", "answer": "B: skyscraper"}

To apologies for the broken flower-pot.\nMary would sell the flowerpots she got for 2 dollars each for 6 dollars.\nSince she will no longer have to pay 9 dollars for flowers, she will have 9 left.\nWith her 9 dollars, she can spend 3 dollars to give each of her 3 neighbors a flower-pot to apologize for the broken flower-pots.\nSo, she has left 6 dollars which she will use to give to her neighbors.\nWith her 6 dollars, she can give 2 neighbors the bowls + toy car, and the other 2 people a bowl + toy car.\nSo to give 3 sets of bowls+toy", "answer": "E: south pacific ocean"}

(B) The carpenter buys a large pack of bee\u2026\nOutput:(A) In fact, he has the exact same amount of money as you do. Let x be how much change he has, and then add 55 to it to get the bills: x + 55 = change. 1 x 4 = bills, and we have that x + 130 = change. In x + 131 = change, we're only interested in x, so we subtract 1 and divide by 55: x = 1. 187, 190, 190 \u2026\nThe same applies to (B). In that case, you're looking for the carpenter's change, but it will be one digit lower than the bills that he has in his pocket.\nFor (B), let s represent what change he has in his pocket ($55), and let x represent 4 times that amount.\nSo, 1 x 4 s = bills, and x + s = change. 4 x 4 x 55 = 4. 7 billion dollars\nSo, 55 x 51", "answer": "E: mexico"}

On his way he spotted this advertisement: For each loaf of wheat bread you buy for $2.04 cents we will give you a free tub of peanut butter. The store was running low on wheat bread, so John waited in long line to pay for it. It was 6:32 pm when he first arrived. He waited in line for about an hour, then his name was called. How much did it cost him in total?\nOutput: John bought 2 loaves of wheat bread (the only items in the advertisement price list) for $4.08 cents each, $<<4.08=8>>8 cents worth of peanut buttter, for a total price of $<<2.04+8=10>>12 2 cents total price.

If you are multiplying 4 by 5/20 4 times, you could write it as 4 * 5/20\nAs a result, we get 20/5= <<4 * 5/5=20>>26, which is equal to 10 + 14+ 16 + ( 25/5)= 20 + ( 5 * 25/5) = 20 + 2 = 22\nSo, to obtain 20/5, you can take 30/5, and add 1.  You can even verify this by doing 30/5+1 = <<30/5+50/5+1=30+50+1>>30 + 50 + 1 = 22\nI also knew 30/5 is equal 1 + 14 + 16 = 37\nThen the whole expression of 20/5+(3+1) = 22  So, you simply take away 22/3 = 7, which equals 19/2, which equals 20.

But if you did that to \"Thinks like you\", the statement and the definition of what \"you\" mean would be totally different.\n\nThinking like a word is a word that, on the face of it, behaves the same way as a word, but whose function is more general: it is defined by a definition that depends on what the meaning of some other, more specific, word is or is assumed to be.

Thinks like a dog and thinks like a word, by contrast, may in at least one sense (or in one language, at least) be unambiguous, but in another sense they will likely have quite different meanings, with or without the more specific qualifier or qualifiers \"pigeon\" or \"word\" or what might be replaced by them in the sentence.\n\nThink of this way: you have a glove, and you're looking at the outline of the glove.  You may describe anything that looks like a duck -- a duck, a goose, a loon, a lobster, a bird of prey, all sorts of things.

This is supported by the line of stars behind the Earth in the logo and the way in which the planets orbit around the sun.\nSo the final answers is C\n\nInput:The solar system is orbiting in a straight path.  Why?\nOutput:The solar system is a system that includes the sun and all of the planets orbiting the sun.   The solar system is not orbiting in the sense that it is rotating around an axis, but rather the Earth rotates around the sun and the solar system as a whole revolves around the black hole, which is the source of all the gravitational pull.  This can cause the Earth to act in an eccentric orbit.\nThe solar system is not a spherical system, but rather is a non-spherical elliptical system: the Earth revolves around the sun in an eccentric elliptical orbit based on the solar system\u2019s rotation.\nIn this shape, even-distance solar system, the Earth is at the farthest distance from the sun at points between 1.726 and 1.326 times farther from the sun than Jupiter.

The weight of a large object can be calculated by adding up the weights of all of the objects it contains, for example, the Earth\u2019s weight is calculated by adding up all of the weight of everything on the Earth.  The easiest way to calculate this is to measure how much it would weigh if it were floating.  This means that most of the weight is represented by air and water.  The weight of something large and dense, however, does matter in the equation that determines the gravitic pull of the Earth, in comparison to an object that is more lightweight.", "answer": "A: bathroom"}

The numbers on the other side would be the mirror images of the one side (e. g. 3, 6, 8, 10), so the animal would have two sets of the same number of legs. This implies that the animals that have even numbers of legs on one side and odd numbers on the other side also have an even number of both legs on both sides, so their total is even. Therefore, an even number of legs = even number of legs on either side.\n\nHence, the animal with an even number of legs must have an even number of different legs. Since 9 legs in total can possibly be made up of 5 legs different from the mirror image, 9 legs = the number of different legs, which implies that 9 is an even number of legs.\n\n## Challenge 2\n\nFind the missing numbers: 2 - 1=5 9+3=12 4 - 3=1 3*49=311 19/\n\n## Challenge 3\n\nFind the value of x:\n\n125 + x - 40 - 15  \\[=\\]\\[=125\\](?).\n\n125 - x + 50 - \n\n## Challenge 4\n\nFind the answer:\n\nF(x) = 9(\n\nx - 1\n\n) + 5 + 3 = 9(x - 1) + 5 + (\n\n3\n\n).\n\nF(x)=9*x-1+5+3=9*x-1+(5+3)=\n\n9*(x-1+5)+(3+5)=9*x+10+16", "answer": "D: cleanliness"}

How far from the starting point were the horses allowed to go while finding the players and the hay in the forest? A cubic meter is equal to 1 m\u00b3.\nOutput: 982.833 m\u00b3 is the total amount of hay in the forest.  Since horses can carry hay, each horse can carry 2 cubic meters.  When there have been no horses left to carry the hay, the remaining hay can not be carried by horses. Three horses remaining are able to carry 3x2= 6 m\u00b3.  The remaining hay is therefore 982.533 m\u00b3.\nThere are 3.064 m\u00b3 of hay left per horse and all horses have been used. The players are far from the starting place.  In fact, the players are 982.733 m\u00b3 away from the starting place.\nSo the final Answer is 982.633m\u00b3\n\nInput: In 2000, the average pay per person in a business was $60,000.

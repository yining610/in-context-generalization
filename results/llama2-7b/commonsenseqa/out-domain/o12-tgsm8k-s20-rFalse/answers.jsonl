In the question above it says Corey has 8 more candyes then Tapanga but there are also a few more candies so it should be 26 not 29.\n\nIf you look at the answers for this question they seem a bit suspect, so I would say that you either should change the answer in this multiple choice question, or add more examples so the student can understand how the question is worded.\n\n###  Input: Freddy is callinghis family on New Year'stEve.

Quick Sort then tries to organize that first element among the other elements in the array.  Quick Sort repeats this task until the whole array is sorted.  After the array is sorted properly, Quick Sort returns an indication to the callers of the algorithm telling them to stop sorting the array.  This indication represents the point in the array that is sorted.

What\u2019s an easier way to find the greatest common denominator?\n\n\n#### Explain\n\nThe easy way to find a common denominator is to simply add an addendum. In the problem 3a,6d you would need to find a common denominators of a+d. Adding a and d to their addends will allow you to find the proper common denominator.\n\n3. You have to travel 140 miles to go from Philadelphia to New York City.

The sum() function has the following syntax:\nsum(my_list, [start])\nThe parameter, my_list, is the number list to sum. The parameter, start, is the starting index of\nthe sum. Since it's for the first challenge, sum is only required to return the total of the given list.\nFor example:\nsum([1, 2, 3], 0) =>\nsum([-1, 2, -3], 0)=> -8\nTo test your program, pass it different lists from 1-100 and from negative 1-101, and it should give\nyou the same result.\nAfter you are finished with the first challenge, there is a hint to help you do the second challenge.\nYou can find the hint in the 'HINT' file.\n\nThe solution:\n1. The challenge has two sets of requirements for sum(): The first is to return the total of a given list, and the second is to reverse the input list and sum it as well. The program should still return the correct total.\n2. Here's an example of how you can solve the challenge:\n\n   let sum = arr => (\n      console.log(sum([1, 3, -4])) // Output 1 because the first number is 1\n      console.log('--------------') // Separate the output of the list.\n      summ([4, 2, 1]) // Submit the second list.\n   )\n\n3.

After the store closes, the manager counts money and adds it to the amount left at the beginning. The following morning, they start the whole process over again, beginning with the customers.  Given the store is a coin operated laundry, write Python code to find how much money the store makes overall over the course of one day.  Remember your code must consider coins with different values. For example, a $1 coin should be worth as much as two quarters. This is a very open-ended question. If you are stumped on how to even approach this question, consult the teacher.\nOutput: 42.5\n\nInput: Write Python code to find how many customers the store has in a day.\nOutput: 118\n\nInput: Write the Python code that checks if a number is prime or not(prime: 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37). A number is prime if:  it has 1 and 2 factors: 1,2  and no numbers that are evenly divisible by the number except the number itself.  You have to be very clear about how different numbers will be handled, such as 23 and 32. For example, 23 should be a prime number, whereas 32 should not be a prime number.\nOutput: 0\n\nInput: Write a single line of code to: 1) Check if the number is even 2) If true, return 0.  If false, return 1.  For example, if you call int(10), you would return 20 and if you call int(20), you would return -2. This is an easy question and the logic may seem intuitive when thinking about how Python int functions. However, you still want to make sure you are very thorough in checking the logic out on your machine. For example, what if someone passed in int(4), should it return 4 or -2?

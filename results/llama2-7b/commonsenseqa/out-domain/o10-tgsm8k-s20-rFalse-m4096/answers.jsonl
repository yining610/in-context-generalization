Let's say the largest value in the input array is 12. Once you've found the largest number, your function should write the index of that number to any variable. That index should come from the index of your array. Now your function should have some code to find the value in that variable. It should be one more than the one in that array. It should then go through every index in the array and subtract 1 from the value at that index. Once you've done that, you should see if the result is the number that is one more than the maximum value in the array, the largest value, or 0.\n\nI can make 39 by taking 4, and 4 of them is 16.\n\nTaking 16, I can multiply the number of candies by 2, which is 32.

A class `InputFile` represents the input file itself, which contains an abstract class `Line` containing a member `contents`, that's a `std::string`, which contains the contents of a single line. A class `Inference` represents a single line that needs to be inferred, and can be thought of as the program itself. A class `State` represents a single state of the program, with a member `value`. The `inference` class takes references to the inference file, inference, state, and line classes to maintain state and the inference of the program. Inference classes can be thought of as a stack that has a \"done\" state and a state with an unknown state on top.\n\n###\n\nThis problem uses the following input file:\n\n```\n1:10 20 20\n35\n```\n\n### Instruction:Answer the Questions below.\n\n\n1.What are the objects within `Inference`?

The policy for the 51,000 campers is strictly enforced and anyone caught with a reserved site without the permit for that site is subject to a $2,000 fine. \nIn 2011, the National Park Service launched an online service to help prevent overcrowding. This service provides a list of sites available for the coming day in all of the parks. The system automatically shows every site that would be available for every hour of the day with a popup indicating whether the site is available or booked. A graphic shows each reservation as a series of horizontal lines with the time on the left and the date on the bottom. A green line means the permit is not being rented, while a red line means the site is being rented.

The houses on the street are generally divided up by lot size. The first time a house is sold or listed it sets the standard for the lot size of the house. The other aspects of the house influence the price: a big house on a large lot, a brand new house on a small lot, and an expensive house on a small lot are all rare, so the house is worth significantly more. Over time, the average size of houses and the average age of houses will be larger, and so a new house built on a big lot will be significantly more expensive than a big house on a small lot.

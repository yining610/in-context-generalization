The car was originally called the Citroen 2CV, but it was rebranded in the UK by the Rover Group.\nIn a small storefront in France, a team of four men decided to design and construct an all electric, two-door, four-passenger sport compact car.  After building a prototype, they traveled to Germany in a van with all their tools in the back to show it to the Volkswagen design team in hopes of licensing or partnering with them to produce the vehicle. After VW decided not to help them, the French team was able to meet with an investor in Sweden that offered to provide funding to develop the car further, provided that they would build it in Sweden.   After a year of discussions and red tape, they were able to build a factory in Sweden. The factory workers made their own uniforms there, and after the car was complete they drove it from Sweden to Canada, where it was sold in the United States and the Middle East.\nWhich of the following best summarizes the above paragraph?\nA: France, Poland and Germany wanted to create a small, efficient car.\nB: The car was built in the United States and was the result of an international collaboration.\nC: The creation of the car involved significant collaboration between many countries.\nD: The car was built by Frenchmen in cooperation with the residents of France.\nE: A German businessman came up with the design for a car after observing the way a French family drove.", "answer": "D: illiterate"}

Meanwhile, Paul is waiting for an item with a list price of $15.\nSince John has $5, he can buy either the item for $5 that costs him nothing, or he can spend an extra $10 to have what Paul needs. However, Paul has $6. So Paul says, \"Here, I'll give you the extra $10 to speed things up because I really need it.\"\nShould John keep the $10 that he earns, or leave it back with Paul, knowing that if he keeps it, Paul knows he is going to need the $10 at some point and will do the same thing for him at some point in the future, so if John keeps the $10, Paul will eventually need it but he can then just ask John.

If there is any number that belongs to B but doesn\u2019t belong to A, B is superior to A. For example, if A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {1, 3, 5}, then 4 belongs to B but doesn't belong to A so B is superior to A, as B contains more elements. Otherwise A is superior to B. For example if A = {1} and B = {2}, then there is no number smaller than each element of B so A is not superior to B. If A and B are both non-empty we say that A is superior to B or B is superior to A, depending on that A has the fewest elements than B. For example, if B = {1,4} and A = {1,2}, then A is superior to B.  If A is equal to B then we say A is equal to B and in a set  equality is reflexive  and symmetric  and transitive.For example, if A={1,2,3} and B={1,2}, then set A{} and set B{} are equal and {1,2} is equal to {1,2,3}.  In short {a}={a}={a},{a,b},{a,b,c} and so on are all equal sets.  Also we say that a set is finite  if it has", "answer": "E: laundry room"}

{"text": "The following are the options to choose from.  The best choice would be a shopping center.  There are a variety of things to spend money on.\n\n### Input : How can we tell if something is in stock or not? Choices:  Stock information, check stock in store \n\n### Response : A store manager may be able to check stock in store.  Otherwise, information about the stock can be found.\n\n### Summary\nThe two options provided are: shopping center and check stock in store. A shopping center is a place that provides a wide range of amenities and items for purchase. Checking stock in store can also give a person information about what is in stock. Both these options can help someone find the items they are in need of.\n\n#### Additional Information\nA shopping center may provide a plethora of amenities. Shopping malls have different sections that sell items of a particular category. A person needs to find the shopping mall that provides them with the items they are looking for. A person may also be able to check stock online through the websites of shopping malls. \n\nA check in store will give you the most accurate information about the item you wish to buy. A shopping mall, even if it stocks the item a person is looking for, may sell out of that certain item. A check in store will ensure the most accurate information.\n\nThe summary statement is the option that is best in all areas. An option is the best choice when it is a good option in all areas, it may be less of a choice because of the other options it may be compared to being the best among a few other options. However, being the best option among 2 or more options does not mean that it will always be the best choice. The statement given in this article is the best summary. Being the best option over two may be a good option to have. \n\n#### Additional Evidence\nThe shopping center may be a good place to check for items or it may be a bad place to go to. The reason for this is it may not have what a person is looking for in the section they need it to be in. The other reason is that a shopping center may have many items for sale that a person does not need. All a shopping center may benefit a person in is the place that they might be able to find that one specific", "answer": "E: shopping center"}

In this equation, we can multiply both sides by n: (n)(n- 1)= 0. Then on the right side, if n= 3, we get (3)(2), which is 6. Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get 5 which leaves us with negative 1.\n\n### Input \n\nThe equation y=4x-60=0 has solution set of (x,y) = (14, -24).

What is the equation of the line with slope 3?\n\n### Response \n\nThe correct answer would be (4, -14). We can first plug in the y value of 14 into the equation. That will leave us with -14 as the x value. This would give us the line y=-14x+ 2. We subtract 14x from both sides and multiply them by 2 to get a slope of 3.

If it is not well constructed, it means it is bad in construction, not made of strong material. Choice B means mass less, which doesn't affect the construction of the building. Choice E is the opposite of the problem. Because of its size, good construction is required, not inconsequential construction. Choice D fits the answer appropriately. Because it is massive, the building is heavy because its construction requires strong material.

Write a response that completes the assignment.\n\n### Assignment:\nFor this exercise, you will write a function that calculates the volume of a prism. Prisms have all the same dimensions and base areas. The top face of a prism is composed of equilateral triangles.\n\nYour function should receive two parameters: width and height. Your function should return an array of two elements: the length of each base (in inches) and the volume of the prism (in cubic inches). If the given length of a prism is greater than its given height, the prism should be considered a rectangular pyramid instead of a prism.\n\n#### Examples:\nInput: prismWithHeight(5, 10) // returns a 2 element array with the elements 18.5 and 162.5 in that order\nInput: prismWidth(5, 8) // returns a 1 element array with the value 40\n\nBelow is an algorithm that describes how to solve this exercise.\n\n### Algorithm:Create array containing parameters. Calculate volume using formula. Create array of results using the volume and base.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBelows is a list of instructions, one after the other.\nIn some cases, some of the instructions can be grouped in order of operation. In those cases, the grouped list should be the start of a group of instructions (which should never be broken in smaller groups because the instructions will lose their meaning).\n\n### Instructions:\n\n* 1. Give two examples of how to use this function.\n* 2. Write a function header.\n* 3. Write the body of the function.\n* 4. Write a sample input into the function and calculate the value (hint: You must return a value!). Then, print out the value returned and the value of the input, side by side.\n* 5. Implement this function in Python.\n* 6. Test all the input cases that you can think of.

{"text": "If you answered C, you chose correctly.\n\n### Rationale:In sports, the object of the game is to get a ball from one place to another. This game requires specific objects like balls (and rules) to play the game. A pool table is not a game, and people playing it do not wear uniforms. A sporting event is where sports teams (wearing uniforms) play in a sport. A television is where you watch all sorts of sports programs. A sporting goods store sells products related to sports and a sport. A hole is a golf course feature, and playing with a ball on the golf course does not require a ball being moved from one spot to another. Instead, golfers hit the ball in hopes that it stays in a designated spot on the golf course. So A, D, and E were incorrect.

If it's sunny on a Monday, on Tuesday there is a 40% chance it's lightly foggy. On Wednesday there is a 30% chance it'll rain. If it rains on Thursday there is a 20% chance it'd be snowing, which happens in only a few places. If it's raining, the next day will be clear. If it's foggy, it will not be sunny. If it rains, the next day will not be sunny either. If it's snowing, that means it will become a bright and sunny day the next day. What is the probability of it being sunny for a certain number of days in a row?\n\n### Response\nSunshine can only be in one place at a time.

{"text": "### Instructions: Answer the following question.\n\n## Solution:\n\n### Demolition:\n**Answer:** \n\n### Average Cost:\n**Answer: The sum of the answers, in decimal form, to the individual riddles.**\n**Explanation**: We first solve the task's answer and obtain 9.99 in decimal form, using one of our methods in the `math_solution` function. We then obtain a list of the correct answers by adding to the total list each riddle's answer, in decimal form. When we add the `math_solutions` list to `riddles_solution`, we end up with a list of strings, each consisting of a fraction or decimal or the word `None`.\n\nTo turn them into the correct string for the `riddles_list` variable, we iterate through the list of strings. Whenever we get a string that is the fraction of a value, such as 9.99, we multiply it by 100 and then end up with a string like `\"1000\"` since the decimal place is cut off.\n\n\n### Output:\n**Answer: (1)**\n\n***A note: All of this is written in Ruby, so the code for writing the instructions and response is in Ruby.***\n\n\n### Instant Solutions:\n\nInstructions:\n\n**Explanation:** First, we take the individual responses for each riddle out of the string passed into that function and insert them in a list. We then take those responses, and convert each of them to a list. When we add to the initial list of answers for the `InstantSolutions` variable, we insert each of the values into the end of the list by changing the element type to a string. When we've finished our calculation at the end of the problem, we return the list.\n\nThe list is then converted to a string by inserting a `print` statement for the `print_answers` variable. That converts the list into the correct string for that variable. If all the values in `riddles_answers` are correct, the function will return a string of `\"True\"`, because the `return riddles_answers.join(\" \")` statement returns the list of answers.", "answer": "A: injuries"}

Now, divide the 3 by 1/3. You get 1.\n\nOnce done, you have 1. Which is great. Do that *again*. Again, divide your number by 1/3, you get 1. Again (this is the tricky part of the question), do it again. You've divided 1 three times in one round, which is impossible.\n\nSo you have to be sure you do it *once*.\n\n### Answer:\nB\n\n### Demotage:\nTo get half of what you have, multiply it by 2.

Entertainment.\n\nIt does not help people keep it happy; it may actually make them sad.\n\nIt does keep them neat, but not necessarily the result of marijuana; most likely, it was the result of the consumer's desire to put it away when they are done.\n\nIt does make them intoxicating, but it is not likely that this was the result of a desire to keep people intoxicated.

If Steve has \"xyz\" sticks, then we can write the formula as.\n\n```\n3*xyz = 2(xyz). So, xyz = 1\n\n2(1+ 2+ 3+...) = xyz = 1x3 -> = 3.\n\nSo 3 have xyz sticks.\n```\n\nAfter that we can write\n\n```\nSteve+Sam has 1000 sticks.\n\nSteve has 3 sticks so 2100 sticks -3 sticks = 2097 sticks (for Steve)\n\nSam has thrice 2097 so 6291 * 3 = 2098 sticks ( for Sam ).\n\nSo 6298 sticks in total.\n```\n\n### Instrucion:Answer the following multiple choic question.\n\n## Explanation:\n```\n$2p^q$ means $2(2)$^$q$.

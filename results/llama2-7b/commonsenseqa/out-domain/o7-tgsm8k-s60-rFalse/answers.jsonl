The third is half as old as the first. How old are they altogether?\nOutput: 40\n\nInput:[2]\n\n# Answer Here\n\n## Solution:\n\n\n### Solution 1\nThe number of cards are represented by x. In this question, 40 - 150 = -150. Then, 211 = x + 40. Divide both sides by x to get x = 201.\n\n### Solution -2\nSimplify.\n\n5 blocks + 20 blocks = 25\nDivide both sides by 2 to get 12.5. Then, round to the nearest whole number. 12 < 13 < 14, so 12.5 is the closest.\n\n### Soluiton -3\nSubtract 20 to both sides to get x = 80.\n\n###Solution 4\nSubtract 3 and divide both by 10. Then, round the solution to the nearest tenth.\n\n12.5 > 6 > 5.5\n\n### Solution-5\nMultiply 4 by 3 and divide both sides by 1.\n\n28 - 10 - 3 - 1 = 24.\n\n###  Solution 6\n\n 28 = 4.5*2 \ndivide both sides by 4.5 and round up to nearest tenth. \n\n\n###  Soluiton 7\nSimplify. \n\n4(30) = 120. \nBoth sides are divisible by 8. \n\n### Solution  8\nSimplify.

To find the answer to -18 times 123, we have to first convert the negative to a positive by adding 1, which would equal 81. Then, we can multiply it by 123, which would equal negative 138666. Negative signs mean division. So, to find the answer to negative 18 times 15, which means 18 divided by 15, we need to follow these steps: first negate the 18 (by adding 1) which would equal -17. Then, we divide -17 by 15, which would equal -13.\nOutput:-13\n\nInput: How can the letter \"A\" be written before itself an infinite amount of times?\nOutput: AAABBBB\u2026\u2026\u2026AAA\n\nInput: Which word(s) do not exist and are not misspelled?

{"text": "E\n\n### Explanation:\n\nIn this module, we will learn how to write Python programs using the standard libraries. In part 2, we will see how the standard Python library is built so you can write your own programs and utilities in Python. In this section, we will also look closer at how to create functions that do different tasks in Python. We will start with a simple definition of a function in Python and see how you can pass in arguments to a function. We will also learn the meaning of and difference between a built-in function and a built-in object in Python. We will introduce you to the list comprehension syntax, which is a particularly useful way of defining a list of values generated via a certain process. We will see how the yield statement can be used to implement a generator. \n\nWe will show you how to use classes to define an object, as opposed to the usual functions. It turns out that functions are just a special case of classes that work a little differently. We will learn how classes are implemented by Python and the differences between a class and a function. At the end of these lessons, you should be able to read and understand a piece of Python. As we move on to more advanced pieces in modules I and II, you will learn how a programmer can specify a complex object or a large set of objects with the help of Python\u2019s powerful standard library and simple programming paradigms.", "answer": "D: pool hall"}

What is the lowest number in the set of the four numbers described?\nOutput: 72\n\nInstruction: Please explain your step by step answer in the remarks of the quiz\n\n### Solution:\n\nIf all three cards are the same then we will have only 3 choices to choose from.\nWe should eliminate that option first.\n\nNow, since, Janet has 9 more cards, so Brenda and Mara should have 9 cards less than Janet.\n\nIf Janet has 9 card more cards, then number of cards should range between 100 to 150\n\nTherefore, if Brenda and Mara each have the value that is less than 9 then\n\nwe will end up having 9 cards each of Brenda and Mara. \n\nIf Brenda and Mara have the same number of cards then Brenda and Mara must both \nhave 9 cards \n\nSo, Brenda and Mara combined can't have 40 cards less if they have 40 cards because  \nthat would give Janet 211 cards.\n\nTherefore, Brenda and Mar have not enough card, either Mara or Brenda must have 50 \ncards. However, we should take into account that the numbers should be positive so\nBrenda should have 52 cards whereas Mara should have 47 cards.\n\nIf Janets has 13 times more cards, then Brenda should have 3 times more cards than \nBrenda whereas Mara should have more half of Janets.", "answer": "C: freezer"}

(10 cards more with Mara)\n\nSo in total 11 cards are missing with the two girls.

Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/l_sZzSJqHdU) of me explaining how the program works.\n##### Set up:\nIn order for the program to take any input, the user needs to call the program like so: \"program name?\", and the program will not run without this input. \n##### Main Function:\n#### 1. Program input\n1. The program takes an ordered number of variable (integer) input. An integer is a type of whole number\n2. The function 'print' is used for output. It is defined in the built-in data type 'print'. The '.' operator is used for multiple variables.\n3. Since variables need to be named, variable names are defined by surrounding them with '$' characters. To get the numbers to a specific number of digits and no lower or higher, use the 'int' function.\n#### 2. Conditional Statements\nThe 'if' statement is a conditional function which evaluates the value of an expression and executes the statement which follows if the expression is true.

Now we have to know the number of cards in both have. If there are 9 cards in Janet then it will be 9+1=10\nThen total of cards in both have is 31+10=41\nIf cards in Janet will be 9 than total of cards will be 10+31=41\nOutput: 201\n- From statement we can infer that total distance traveled is 50 blocks which means that total distance traveiled in one way is 25\n- From statement we infer that total number of blue chairs is 50\nSo green color chairs is four times that of blue color chairs than that means no of green chairs will be 4*50=200\nDifference in white color chairs of no of the two colors will be 3*10=30. So total number of chairs are 200+30=230\n- There are 4.5 gallones of coffee in all\nAlannah is 20 more so it means that in 4.5 gallones there is 20-20=0 and from this value no of thermos of beatrix =4.5-3\nso total =4+3=7\n- If we sum up 30 in Alannah's and 15 in brenda's, then total in all is 45 now we have to find number of berries in each birds i.e no of days so if 45 is divided by no fo birds (5), then no of berries in each bird is 9\n- On the basis of this statement we can say that she take home all the sale items from mall i.e 18 clothes and in this statement sale items are free so there wud be no charge for anything.\n- Secular parties are frequent in nature and not held on specific time and date", "answer": "D: frequent"}

In which I had to figure out on my own how to solve this question without any help. The process was very enjoyable but hard to learn how to solve, I can still not solve the next problem.\n\nTo start the program I had to create a struct for my \"MultipleChoice\" problem. To do that I used `use std::option::Some`and `Option,` to create a custom struct around an `Option`.\nNext, the struct required a list of options and I created a `struct` named \"Choice\" which contained 4 different options to choose from, which would then be passed to the `struct` named \"multipleChoice\" that I created. These 4 different options contain a string type data for each one of them. Then, I needed to create an enum type that would correspond with each of the 4 options. (the name \"choice\" would have to be renamed to something in the future for the second part of the question which I'm going to explain in detail).\nTo start the program, I first created a type for the \"string\" data, which is going to be used in the enum type I created so I can compare values from the user input through the struct. Then, I created a struct with a single field that is a Vec of the enum type I created. That struct would take in an enum value and store is in the Vec, along with the user input through the question. Then, I created an array with all the choices from the struct that I named \"choice\" so I could compare the choices and the user input. Finally, I had the main function which would define the \"chances\" of getting the correct answer.  For example, if the user didn't give a correct answer they would have a 1/5 chance and if they were correct they will have a 4/5 chance if they had 4 choices.\n\nThese are the structures I created in my Program:", "answer": "D: museum of natural history"}

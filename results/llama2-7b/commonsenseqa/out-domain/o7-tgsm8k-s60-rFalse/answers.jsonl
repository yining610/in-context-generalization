The goal is to understand the concepts at work and to know what your program did to arrive at a specific result.\n\n*Note: If you get stuck, you can look at the full code in the project files.*\n\n### Requirements:\n\n* Only integer values are accepted.\n* You may not use any globals/shared variables/classes/etc.\n* The input data is not guaranteed to be valid.\n\n---\n\nIn the code, I need to calculate which direction I should turn based on how far North I am\n\n### Input Format:\n\n*Number in the format of miles*\n\n----\n\n### Output Format:\n\n*The word north or south*\n\n### Sample Input:\n\n*230*\n\n----\n### Sample Output:\n\n*The letter n, indicating North.*\n\n--------\n\n## Notes:\n\n*Note: In this project. We will use if statements, to use them correctly. First thing you will need to do, is indent the statements for the block of logic you are about to write. If you indent properly, your code is easier to read. So you may want to take a look at your own code and make sure its properly indented.\n\n*Note 2: When developing, it helps to create a few variables so you can get code working with less repetition by just updating one variable.\n\n### Test Cases:\n\nI need to create 3 test cases, each for one of the programs written.

If there are other correct answers that should be listed here, please send a pull request with those answers added (and the instructions updated) after your acceptance.\n\n### Examples\n#### A:\nA child's growth depends on two factors: the nutrients in food and the amount of exercise the child gets. Nutrients in food and exercise are like water and air. In order for a plant to grow properly, the plant needs both water and air. In the same way, a child must get both nutritious food and exercise in order to grow.\n\nGrowth depends on both nutritious food (water) and getting enough exercise (air). A child who drinks milk and eats green leafy vegetables and fruit will not likely grow as tall as a child who eats foods that have little or no nutritious value. But a child who drinks milk, eats healthy foods, and gets regular exercise will probably be healthy and grow as tall as possible.\n\n#### B:\nExercising and eating the right foods are the best ways to be healthy and fit. If a child is not able to do at least one hour of exercise daily, that child should talk to a parent or the teacher about eating nutritious snacks, such as fruits and vegetables.\n\nToo much food or too little exercise can result in being overweight, becoming sick, or developing a heart condition. If the parent thinks there is a medical problem, then the doctor needs to be told about a child's weight problem.\n\n#### C:\nIf you eat too much dinner, you will get acid reflux. This is very painful and not to be enjoyed.\n\n#### D:\nIf you eat to much dinner, you will gain weight. When you have too much food in your stomach, it backs up. So you have more acid in your stomach than you can handle. So eating too much dinner causes you to get sick. You get an upset stomach, feel bad, and eat some more. So you get sick again.

Instead, it is designed to be extra resistant to everyday use.\n\nIf glass was weaker, the manufacturer would call it fragile, and if it was less stiff and strong than regular glass, it would be called flimsy.\n\nThe answer is no because the glass is not extra forceless. Forceless is the opposite of stiff\n\nIf we were to use the word forceless to describe glass, we would describe weak glass, which we just said was incorrect. A forceless quality that is the opposite of sturdy.\n\nGlass that has been treated to be especially resistant is known as extra strength glass. It is thicker and stiffer.\n\nA sturdy one is a strong one.\n\nAnswer B:\nThe answer is no. Strength is one word because glass is sturdy. But fragile is not a word for an attribute because it is a word that tells us that a thing can easily be broken.\n\nAnswer C:\nThe answer is correct. The term for glass that hasn't been strengthened for use is weak. Glass that has been strengthened for use to resist breaks is termed sturdy.\n   \nAnswer D:\nNo, the answer is incorrect.

For every 13 (5 + 5 x 6 - 4 x 7) one is to get the result 13 times (5 add 5 times 6 less 4 times 7 5 + 24 + 16 - 28 24+28 \u2013 24 = 6 less 23 \u2013 x \u2013 y 20 = x. X = 55.

So our answer 57 times 2 = 114.\n\nLet's try the second one. For every 16 minus the 13, it's going to be 3 less than 29, less 11 is negative 18.\n\nI wrote negative because that's what the answer is negative 18, we have 16 negative 18 or let's look at it. It is 16 is minus 18. It means we have 2 and negative 2 and minus 2 equals 2. We can substitute it in our original. It is equal 19 minus 11.\n\nSubtract 13, we're back to the first one. Let's just look at it, the 11 is the less 6. Then we get 16.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe first equation: The variables are equal to the first equation.\n\nThe", "answer": "D: room"}

A virus is a type of infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of other organisms. This is a key difference between viruses and other pathogens like prions, though the lines between these are sometimes blurred. In most cases, the host does not live a healthy, full life as long as it is carrying the virus. There are many diseases associated with particular viruses, and these diseases can spread in different ways. Some examples of viruses and the diseases they are associated with include:\n\n<details><Summary>Pulmonary edema\n\n* Viruses that can cause pulmonary edema are: cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, parainfluenza virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and other human immunodeficiency viruses.\n\n</summary></Details>\n<details><Summary></Summary></Details>\n<center>\n<figure style=\"width: 700px; display: inline-block;\">\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Medley_of_viruses_under_electron_microscope.jpg/1200px-Medley_of_Viruses_under_electric_microscop.jpg\" alt=\"Medley of Viruses Under Electron Microscope\" width=\"300\"/>\n</figure>\n</center>\n</Details>\n</details><details><summary>Response B: reproduce</summary>\nViruses multiply by themselves in the cells they have invaded.

If Mara answered with -4 times her Brenda answer, which will be +2052, then it would be logical that -4 times +41(Brenda's answer) would be -1644, and thus in order to answer the question correctly, Mara should have answered -53, and not -4 times her Brendas answer.\n- A possible solution is:\n\nLet m be \"Mara's answer\"\n- Let b be \"Brenda's answer\"\n\nSo:\n(1) m >= 2*b\n- which means that:\nm <= -2*b\n- Let S: -4*b = m\n- or: 4*b = m + 2\n- so: b = (m+2)/4\n- from which follows:\nm = -2*b + 2\n- and: m = -2*(-b+2) + 2\n- which means that\nm = -3*b + 5\n[1]\n- and: m - 4 = -3*b - 4\n\n- so: m - 4 + 3*b - 3*b = 5\n\n- which means that if we multiply m - 4 +3*b by 3,", "answer": "A: sit down"}

It is the first sentence that gives the writer\u2019s point of view on the topic; thus, it is often given a commanding tone. The topic sentence is followed by a colon (:), and there should be at least 2 transition(s) included.\n\n#### Supporting sentences\nSupporting sentences are the sentences that include the supporting topic, that is, they talk about how one can support the topic sentence by using their main idea. It starts with a blank line and a dash(-).\n\n\n#### Transition\nA transition is the sentences that are used to connect sentences and paragraphs.  It is a sign that one paragraph is connected to another.  It contains the words to make the sentence look smooth and clear so readers can follow smoothly.\n\n#### Conclusion\nA conclusion is the last sentence that ties up all sentences that are written before it. It is also the sentence that brings to a close of the paragraph. It contains the words such as 'lastly' and its kind. 'Lastly' can be used only in the last sentence but its meaning is the same as 'in conclusion'.\n\n#### Grammar\nThe grammar used in a paragraph includes the sentence structure, grammar such as verb, and sentence format. It might be easy to format the basic structure of a paragraph. But do not forget to check all the necessary sentence structure such as noun, pronoun, and verb.\n\n#### Example\n\n```\n<i>The topic sentence is the first sentence that establishes the main idea of the paragraph; and it\u2019s followed by", "answer": "D: museum of natural history"}

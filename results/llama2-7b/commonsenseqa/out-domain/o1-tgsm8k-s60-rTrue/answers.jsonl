How much change does she have if she buys 3 cans?\nOutput:B) $8.18, 3 cans\n\n### In this case, Brenda can buy the 24-can case (24) by paying the total cost of 195 cents (195). \nSo Janet pays the additional charge of 60 and Brenda pays 195.  60 195  115\nSo she has 115 cents which can buy 2 cans and 2 cans are left in the case (1 can of cans). \nTherefore, Janet pays 60 more than Brenda. \n\n\n### The correct answer for Instruction 4 is that Mara has 110 cards because she has 150-4=146. Janet has cards because she has 9 more than Brenda. Therefore Janet has 146-9 = 137\n\n### The answer for the last part with $41.76 is 1, $41.74 for 1. 54 cents for a can left over or $195 - $41. 76 = $153.24. One can cost $1.95 (195 cent per can) and if a person is willing to pay $10 she can buy 2 can of sodas. Therefore she pays $195 -$10 =185 cents.\nShe has can of soda left and the can is $1.95. 195 -195 =0. Therefore, there is $0 to buy 12 cans left. So 195 - 12 = 183 cents available. Therefore she pays 183 for the last 12 cans remaining.\nSo her total bill= 195 cats + 185 cents + 183 cats = 563 c", "answer": "C: complications"}

Of those 6 times as many, there are 3 times as many over 30, 2 times as many who work out often and have a big butt, and 10 times as many who think it's very hot outside.\nOutput: The correct choice would be C. It would be easier to count up all the women than to do the 6x calculation, so all the women should go in one group.

(If you do choose C you should know that the rest of the answer is incorrect, but it's just a test on how much easier it is to get rid of groups before doing the math.

If they are not nostalgic for their remote, then they do not like their remote so the answer should be a. Nostalgic is a vague word and could mean anything from dis-like to close, the answer cannot be close or nostalgic. That is 4 ways to choose how the person likely feels about their remote. There are only two ways to correctly answer this question, \"attached\" and \"close.\" The person is attached if they can only go by what they remember or \"know\" about the remote.

We want it to be a function that takes 2 numbers, one, for the y coordinate (which is the x coordinate of the previous problem), and one for the y coordinate (the x coordinate of this function). The graph of this function is a vertical line and horizontal line in the y direction. If the y coordinate of the value is between 0 and the left y coordinate on then we want to print 1 and if it is between the left y coordinate and right y coordinate than the x value we want to print 4. If not then we want it to be 3. We want this because it is easier to interpret a function with values.\n\nThere are many ways of abstracting piecewise functions. We will express the function as an if statement. The if statement in Javascript uses the following syntax:\n  * if (", "answer": "A: attached"}

We then add 2 digits of the number to get another 3-digit number. The number of digits in the second 3-digit number will equal the last digit of the first 3-digit number if you subtract the first digits of each number. Example 072 from right to left. We have 072 = 204. Since we added digits, we subtract them. 0 - 0 = 0, 7 - 2 = 5, 2 - 4 = -2. -2 is the last number of our sequence, so our answer is 072.\nOutput: B A The sum of the 2-digit number is equal 2 times the number A. We \nthen add 2  digits of the number to \nget a string of 4-letters (word). The number of letters in 4-\nletter string will equal the last letter of the string if you subtract the first letters of each word. \nFor example, 0680 from right to left.  We have 0680 = 1268. Since the numbers added produce a string of letters, \nwe first subtract them letter-by-letter.  (A) 0 - 0 - 0 + 0 and we are left with 0. (B) 6 - 8 + 0 = -2. (-2) is the\nlast letter of our sequence, so now we know our answer is 0680.\n\nInput: A word contains the sequence 219. There are two consonants and then a vowl.

Choices: 1: 1 2: 2 3: 3 4: 4 5: 5.\nOutput: 3: 3\nIf you have a child who cannot read, try having him or her use a textbook intended for children in the first grade. A year later, you'll have to use a textbook that's intended for second-graders. Then you'll have to give this child a third-grade textbook, fourth-grade textbook, etc. before he can read a textbook meant for college students. You'll have to multiply by three before he can read a college book.\nThis solution is correct but not optimal. We actually needed to be iterative, so let's assume we have to increase i times before we can read a textbook.\nA common textbook for undergraduate classes have a difficulty of 2. Let's say a textbook for college students has a difficulty of 3. Given these, let's create 2 equations and solve for i:\n\n2x + 3e =1  \n2(x + 3e) = 4\n\nWe can then rearrange this to get i:\n\n2(x + e) = x + 3e\n\nSo if we solve this equation for e, we get:\n\ne = 3(x+1)/2\n\nSubstitute e in the original equation and solve for our i:\n\n2e x =  -1/2\n\n-2x = -2\n\nx = 1/2\n\nTherefore, the child can become proficient if our i is at least 1. This means that we can only use textbooks for students in kindergarten and second graders and use first grade textbooks for college students.\n\nInput: A bookstore has a 42% increase in its book sales from last week to this week.

{"text": "A, C, D\n\nAnswer: B. Use an array (not a list) where each element represents a player. If you have two players that are in the same row, swap them both so you aren't going to end up with players in duplicate spots. Your code should read like this:\n\n\\begin{code}\ndef switchrow(arr):\n    temp = arr.copy()\n    i = 1\n    for j in range(len(arr)):\n        if temp[i] > temp[j]:\n            i +=1\n            temp[i], temp[j] = temp[j], temp[i]\n        elif temp[i] > arr.index(1) < temp[j]:\n             i +=1\n             temp[i], temp [j] = temp[i], temp\n\\end{code}  \n\nIn codegolf.com, this solution is 4 fewer characters than this solution: https://codegolf.com/problem/swapping-golf-players/testcase\nIt takes about 3 seconds because it uses all of Python.\n\nComment: Can you please explain what you mean by \"swapping\" in the above code? You have not assigned anything in the array but just made a copy of it.\n\nComment: The swapping algorithm in the above code just swaps the positions of two players. It doesn't assign a number to a position so that position can be replaced by a new number.\n\nComment: @makitamadness It's called an Array, and not list\n\nComment: Yes. So where did I make a mistake?\n\nComment: @Mr.Csirke, when you use `arr.copy()` then a new array is created based on the length of the original array and copies of the values from the original array. After you run the code, the variable `temp` will now have the same length and a different copy of the values from the variable `arr`.", "answer": "E: cause accidents"}

{"text": "Answer is A - Birds\n\n### Explanation\nSo this questions can be solved by a greedy recursive algorithm.\nAnd the answer that we must look for is the maximum number of words from all of them, we can do that in the order given by our question.\nFirst, let's start recursively and calculate each one of them.\n- Brenda.\nWe have only one letter (A), so the answer is 0 for her.\n- Janet.\nShe has two letters (AA), so her maximum length is 2.\n- Mara.\nShe has two letter (BC), so her maximum length has two possibilities:\n- BC, for this her maximum possible length is the answer given by the recursive calculation.\n- BC, her maximum possible length is also the answer given by the recursion.\nSo the answer has three possibilities:\n- 0 - if Brenda's answer is 0, then that answer should be in the same index as for Janet, because Janet must be more than Mara.\n- 2 - if Janet's answer is 2, then that answer should equal to the same index as for Mara, because Mara must have two times as many of something than Janet.\n- 5, if we add them all we will get 2+5 = 7.\n\nAnd we have the only solution. To find it, we start with an empty array and after we finish for each of the elements of the input, if the length of the word is equal to the index of the string, then we have the answer.\nWe do the same calculation recursively, we compare each letter of the substring of the string (a, b, c) with the index of the current string. Then we compare it to the string which we have got till now, and if that string matches then that is the string that we have to compare all the others strings, and then we compare that string with the substring that we have in the current string.\nIf we have at some position in the recursive method a non-integer then we have that the string has a different length than the string we've got till then, and we should calculate that length.", "answer": "C: butterflies"}

While there, they wanted to see an exhibit which was on the second floor of the museum. The museum stairway was blocked by construction workers and the only way to ascend the stairs was by a single elevator only usable by adults since it had no capacity for strollers. There were 18 strollers outside waiting for the elevator as 9 of the adults departed the museum and the remaining adults were being turned away to come back later when there is a break in the construction. In how many minutes (to the nearest minute) did the entire group leave the museum?\nOutput: If we assume that all the remaining 9 go together only 1 elevator is enough for that group. Then we can solve as follows:\nNumber of adults: 18\nIn each time one adult can be accommodated in an elevator. So, if 18 go together at a time the waiting time for one elevator:\n9/9 + 9/18 = (9/9) - (9/18) = 9/27 or 3/5 min for one group to come down\nAfter 1 group is down only 1 elevator can take all 9 and hence this is enough for 9 adults in n minutes where n is\n\\(1/3\\) of 5, that is 5/3.\nSo it takes 5 total minutes for 9 adults.\n\nThe remaining 9, including the previously 18 group, can take time 1/3 from 5, that is \\((3/5) * 5 = 30/30 = 2/3```\n\nSo, the total time taken to depart from the entire group is 7 minutes.", "answer": "E: office supply store"}

This has the advantage of being cheaper by an average of about $100 a month while requiring more maintenance on your side.  This gives you greater control over your home\u2019s security and maintenance needs. When I buy my house, I will consider buying a townhouse over an apartment complex that comes with a lot of additional fees and responsibilities for safety and security.\n\nThere will be no difference between when I rent a townhouse or rent an apartment from my landlord. My landlord will be the owner of my house and my tenancy agreement will be based on my ability to make payments.

{"text": "A.Arena\n\n### Rationale :\nThe only correct answer is arena.\n\n### Input :\nWhat is the average temperature in April May and June for the past 15 years?\n\n### Response :\nThe first thing we do is look for an easy way to see the answer. We use a t-distribution to see if things are distributed normally.\n\n### Rational:\n\nIn a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode all occur at the same value.\n\nWe can use a t-distribution when comparing two population normally. We want to know if the population is normally distributed.\n\nThe t-distribution is a normal distribution where its shape is dependent on the amount we take from a population. \n\nFor the purpose of our answer, an independent and normally distributed set of data can be called a population.\n\nWe can make a distribution of the population like this: Take from the population and add these numbers up (50 samples), then put the number in a normal distribution. If the sample is not normally distributed, we know it is not a normal population, and we take it from that population. Otherwise, it is normally distributed, and will fit the population.\n\nIt is important to note, we will not always have a normally distributed population.\nThe t-distribution curve is a \"bell curve\", but its shape is different from the normal or bell curve. It is a bumped version of a bell curve.\n\nFor the past four years, the average temperature has been between 67 and 68 degrees, which are both at 68 degrees. \n\nIf our population was normally distributed, our sample population would be normally distributed. In a normally distributed population, a different size sample will have a different shape but a normal distribution curve shape.\n\nFor the year 1998, we can take a look at how the population is normally distributed: 1998 gives us 63 degrees in its sample. However, in normal distributions, the shape is bumped up and down, even if it is normally distributed. \n\nFrom the year 1988, the mean of the first three years is 66 degrees.\n\nIf this is the shape of the population, the difference between this and the average temperature of the past two years will be 95 - 66 = <<95-6", "answer": "A: arena"}

There were 356 violent crimes in 2014 and 216 in 2015. Last year, Scott's average day includes arresting roughly 1 violent criminal per day. Scott also performs an evaluation of the town regularly and makes some comments as to how it might improve.\n\nScott thinks that, if every resident has a burglar alarm system, it would reduce the crime rate by 5%. Scott suspects that this same principle would work nationwide if alarm systems became more widely available. This, however, would make them expensive and people would have to have their houses burglarized to justify the cost. He also thinks that the town would decrease crime even further if he patrolled the town every other night. Scott thinks that this would increase the town\u2019s overall crime rate by 7%.\n\nScott thinks the best course of action is to buy a house that\u2019s currently on the market for $1400,000 and is located two blocks away from his house. From that house, Scott would be able to see into every house in the area. From that house, he would be able to easily survey the town and see if anything is amiss.\n\nScott suspects that every house has a burglar alarm that has been set before nightfall. He also thinks that if the burglars can see that a house is not occupied, they will not attempt to break in.\n\n### Response : E\n\n### Dem:\nThe answer is B.\n\n### 214\n### Input: What is a difference between a set and a relation?

{"text": "-  A: advisory\n\n### Demystifier:Sometimes we have to remember the difference between \u201cadvisory\u201d and \u201cmandatory.\u201d An advisory is something that suggests but does not require. A mandate is a rule that requires you to complete a task in order to comply with the law.\n\nAn order to evacuate a neighborhood is a mandate. An advisory on the possibility of an incoming hurricane is, of course, an advisory and not a mandate.\n\nSimilarly, to order someone to comply with the request to evacuate their neighborhood in an emergency is a mandate. When the TV presents the news about the order, its function is to inform the audience; when the TV presents the news that there is a mandatory evacuation, its function is to order or advise.\n\n### Answer Key:\nA: advisory\n\n#### The question is in the context of an emergency, so it uses the word \"mandatory\" when it refers to an order to evacuate the neighborhood. But we would be much more likely to hear the words \"mandatory\" or \"order\" when a TV station is asked to inform its audience about a news event and not necessarily to urge its audience to comply with a requirement. So if something is mandatory to a local government it does not necessarily become mandatory to us when we hear an advisory or a report about it.  \n\nB: mandate\n\nC: soap opera\n\nD: elective\n\nE: optional\n\n#### B: mandate\n\n### Inputs:\nThe bank must close at 3:00 pm.

{"text": "**E** - There are a number of different ways in which one can tally, counting forward and backward can both be considered to be tallying\n\n### Input\nWhile I am able to remember the difference between forward and backward, I can not do it without counting. I find myself always counting by threes to know if I\u2019ve got \nthe number correct or not. That\u2019s why I prefer to count forward when dealing with numbers.\n\n### Response\nGiven, we want to count in multiple ways, but we are only given two of those ways. One way of counting is by counting by ones. If we wanted to count by seven, it would go like this: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. We could also decide to count by multiples of three. If we wanted to start at one and count to twelve, it would go like so: 1,3,6,9...12,36,.... These are two of the many ways we can count.\n\n### Input (incomplete)\n\nI was able to easily remember 11 + 11 in my head which means 2 + 2 x 5 x the number on which the 2 and 5 are multiplied. 2 x 7 = 14 3 x 5 = 15 4 x 5 = 20 5 x 5 = 40 6 x 5 = 30\n6 x 14 = 84\nBut I cannot recall 43 x 14 without counting which I did out loud.\n\n### Rational\nWhen I have to know how many seconds are in a minute or how many minutes are in an hour I do not need to put numbers into my head.

How can one exhibit something to another exhibit when they are both at home? It is too far-fetched. You can also try surfing the net, but that is not what you are concerned about.

{"text": "The answer is map.\n\n\nGiven that you are a student in MSC who just got admitted into a community group to read together after work to discuss and improve your presentation skills by sharing what you have learned. As you gather in the community read together area, you discover the community group leader is missing. As you look around for her, you discover the community read room which used by the community was open. The room is full of chairs, tables, bookshelves, cabinets, and a big desk surrounded by open bookshelves. The open bookshelves cover the four walls and have 20 books on some of the bookshelves. All of the bookshelved and the wall are white. You decide to write a quick note to your group leader to let her know you can\u2019t stay for book club, and so you\u2019ve decided to head back to work. As you write your note, you see she already left her note on how the community room has 20 books in it. At 5 o\u2019clock the door is still open. When you walk in there is a cabinet next to the desk and a table full of chairs covered by 20 blue blankets. Behind the cabinet, you see a 6 bookshelf filled with more books. After you leave the community read area to head back to work, you see there are no desks in the community read area.

Choices:  A: shirt pocket B: calligrapher's hand C: inkwell D: desk drawer E: blotter<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>- A is right because most people do carry them in their shirt pockets.<n>- B is wrong because calligraphers use a different kind of pen, and calligraphy is not as popular as it was in the 18th century so a calligrapher' prefers shirt pockets. Calligraphers don't need to worry about ink absorbing their hand because their hand never touches the paper when writing; they also don't want calligraphy to be messy either.<n>- C is wrong because an inkwell is a container with water where you can put your fountain pen and it will absorb and dilute its own ink rather than being completely saturated by it.<n>- D is wrong because some people leave handwritten notes on their desk for others to read, so leaving ink on your desk drawer is bad because the ink can stain the paper while you are putting your notes in your drawer.<n>- E is right because blotters are made to absorb some of the paper's ink so it doesn't stain your shirt pockets.

Listen=the action of listening. Hear is a very common word so i would have known to pick the correct answer. I was able to know this because on this specific test, the previous question had the question ask what sound a particular word makes. I am able to connect my knowledge from there to this question and easily get A+ because I got the same exact answer.

Therefore, the way you read the question, the up would be to the north and the west would be to the south so you would actually turn E to the north and the W to the south so 8th avenue would point to north and west. Which is incorrect for this question because since up and down is east and west. So the only answer that should be on our map should be A.<n><n>I was able to get all of these questions correct because every step I took for these 2 questions was from a thought process.<n>During this time, I tried to read the question for any sense that made it easier for me to understand.<n>I also thought of the easiest word to think of that can explain

Choices:  A: burlap sack B: hot country C: purse D: pet shops E: deep grass<n><n>### Response:		Input not correct.<n><n>### Rationale:Janet has 48 and Mara has 52 and Brenda has 68. Janet 48 (60 - 12) Mara has 64 (52 + 12). Brenda has 60 (52 - 8). Therefore, Janet and Mara divide the numbers evenly:Janet: 48 ÷ 2 = 24Brenda: 30 ÷ 3 = 10. Since Brenda needs 1/3 more than Janet, 24 + 10 = 34. Mara needs 40, so she gets 24 (34). She takes 2 more from Mara and she keeps the remaining 42. There, she got 48. Janet and Brenda keep their original cards. Brenda now has 68, Mara (Brenda's partner) has 48, and Janet has 48.<n><n>### Input<n><n>### Answer:<n>There weren't pots in him either!<n><n>### Rationales:<n>Mara would give Janet 48 cards since Brenda 68 Brenda would give Mara 48 cards.<n><n>### Output:<n>The answer was 61 not 34<n><n>### Rene<n>

Therefore, The closer you get to any exits will result in traffic congesting the area.<n><n>### Input<n>An expressway can suffer form traffic, this traffic gets worst the further away from its origin you get. What do experts call an area where two roads intersect if they are both expressways at the point where they intersect?<n>Explanation: This answer will be the same as above since it is traffic that does not lead to exits, so, traffic will not lead to congestion.<n>#### Rest Stops<n><n>Response: The question above states that traffic gets worse the closer one is to an exit.<n><n>Therefore, If there is traffic on an expressway, getting further from its origin will worsen the traffic as it gets further from the location it is coming from.<n><n>### Concept:<n>1. If traffic worsens the closer one is to the origin, then the traffic will worsen as one gets closer to rest stops.<n>2. Traffic worsens and rest stops will increase as one gets closer to the origin.

Choices:  A: high school gymnasium B: city C: park D: use E: los angeles<n><n>### Response:		D. Los Angeles. A high school gymnasium is an indoor-only option, as it would make little to no sense for basketball to be played outside. Parks do not qualify as outdoor basketball courts, either, as we would never think to play basketball there. Finally, city is not logical; cities should always include outdoor spaces as part of the definition. This leaves one of the remaining options — the “use” option. This is correct. Los Angeles is a city that includes many outdoor spaces, including basketball courts.

Choices:  A: fairy tale B: castle C: middle ages D: chess board E: doll house<n><n>### Response:		I believe the small knight is likely to be found on D. The description says that the knight is small. To be found on a chess board, the knight would likely have to be the king's knight, but that is too tall. The castle is made of stones and it seems that the knight is unlikely to be in a castle. A fairy tale may seem like it could contain a small knight, but it does not describe the small knight. A doll house would have its own little knight but a small knight is not small enough to be a doll. Therefore, I believe that the small knight can be found on D.

I started to think about where a copier may be found, and I came to the conclusion that it does not make sense to find one in an industrial area or in a barn. It is not very likely to find one in those places.<n>> A copier should definitely be found in a school since schools often need copiers.<n>><n>> ## Answer: D<n>><n>> # => Answer: D<n>> #<n><n>### Solution:<n>I found this problem very difficult too! This problem gave me a hard time because it was a lot more logical to think of copiers and copiers only. In order to be able to answer this question and to know what I was doing, I started by creating a T-chart between the "input" and the "demo". I started by brainstorming all of the places a copier could be, but the only place a copier would be found was the school and not any of the other choices.<n><n>> ## Answer: E<n>><n>> # Answer: E<n><n>

Choices:  A: arena B: building C: dock D: concert hall E: museum<n><n>### Response:		<n>A.Arena<n><n>### Rationale :<n>The only correct answer is arena.<n><n>### Input :<n>What is the average temperature in April May and June for the past 15 years?<n><n>### Response :<n>The first thing we do is look for an easy way to see the answer. We use a t-distribution to see if things are distributed normally.<n><n>### Rational:<n><n>In a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode all occur at the same value.<n><n>We can use a t-distribution when comparing two population normally. We want to know if the population is normally distributed.<n><n>The t-distribution is a normal distribution where its shape is dependent on the amount we take from a population. <n><n>For the purpose of our answer, an independent and normally distributed set of data can be called a population.<n><n>We can make a distribution of the population like this: Take from the population and add these numbers up (50 samples), then put the number in a normal distribution. If the sample is not normally distributed, we know it is not a normal population, and we take it from that population. Otherwise, it is normally distributed, and will fit the population.<n><n>It is important to note, we will not always have a normally distributed population.<n>The t-distribution curve is a "bell curve", but its shape is different from the normal or bell curve. It is a bumped version of a bell curve.<n><n>For the past four years, the average temperature has been between 67 and 68 degrees, which are both at 68 degrees. <n><n>If our population was normally distributed, our sample population would be normally distributed. In a normally distributed population, a different size sample will have a different shape but a normal distribution curve shape.<n><n>For the year 1998, we can take a look at how the population is normally distributed: 1998 gives us 63 degrees in its sample. However, in normal distributions, the shape is bumped up and down, even if it is normally distributed. <n><n>From the year 1988, the mean of the first three years is 66 degrees.<n><n>If this is the shape of the population, the difference between this and the average temperature of the past two years will be 95 - 66 = <<95-6

There were 356 violent crimes in 2014 and 216 in 2015. Last year, Scott's average day includes arresting roughly 1 violent criminal per day. Scott also performs an evaluation of the town regularly and makes some comments as to how it might improve.<n><n>Scott thinks that, if every resident has a burglar alarm system, it would reduce the crime rate by 5%. Scott suspects that this same principle would work nationwide if alarm systems became more widely available. This, however, would make them expensive and people would have to have their houses burglarized to justify the cost. He also thinks that the town would decrease crime even further if he patrolled the town every other night. Scott thinks that this would increase the town’s overall crime rate by 7%.<n><n>Scott thinks the best course of action is to buy a house that’s currently on the market for $1400,000 and is located two blocks away from his house. From that house, Scott would be able to see into every house in the area. From that house, he would be able to easily survey the town and see if anything is amiss.<n><n>Scott suspects that every house has a burglar alarm that has been set before nightfall. He also thinks that if the burglars can see that a house is not occupied, they will not attempt to break in.<n><n>### Response : E<n><n>### Dem:<n>The answer is B.<n><n>### 214<n>### Input: What is a difference between a set and a relation?

Choices:  A: medicine cabinet B: chemist's shop C: kitchen D: drug store E: bedroom<n><n>### Response:		Birth control pills are often kept in the refrigerator along with perishable foods like meat, poultry, fish, milk, cheese, etc. Some people prefer to keep these medications with them in a convenient location so they can take them as directed. One option that is a close neighbor to the living room (or kitchen) is by the side of the refrigerator.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>Medicine cabinets and bathroom shelves are common locations for toothpaste. Many people store over the counter medications in the bathroom as well. These places do not typically have refrigeration. They usually have an electric socket.<n><n>Many bedroom windows would not be appropriate for the type of shelf you suggested, plus it could be difficult to keep birth control pills out of the sight of children. Storing birth control pills in the bathroom could be inconvenient if a woman is taking medicine frequently. Keeping them with the refrigerated foods makes it convenient and less expensive. However, if you keep many prescriptions in the refrigerater, then it may be necessary to have an electric outlet.<n><n>There are small cabinets by the door that could hold toothpaste. These cabinets are not designed for refrigeration. In a drug store, you pay for medications and a pharmacy provides medication.<n><n>You can purchase prescription and non-prescription medication in a chemist shop. One would not store medications that need refrigeration in the kitchen unless the appliances for refrigeration are in easy reach for this item of equipment.<n><n>### Input Where in your home would you like to put the TV?

Mara has twice as many cards as Janet. How many cards do they have in all if Mara has 40 cards less than 150?<n>Rationales: Mara has 150 - 40 = <<150-40=110>>110 cards.<n>Janet has 110/2 = <<110/2=55>>55 cards since Mara has twice as many as Janet.<n>Brenda has 55 - 9 = <<55-9=46>>46 cards since Janet has 9 cards more than Brenda.<n>Therefore, they all have 110 + 55 + 46 = <<110+55+46=211>>211 cards.<n>#### 211<n>Answer: 211<n><n>### Input:The evacuation became mandatory, so what came on the TV? Choices:  A: advisory B: mandate C: soap opera D: elective E: optional<n><n>### Response:		<n>-  A: advisory<n><n>### Demystifier:Sometimes we have to remember the difference between “advisory” and “mandatory.” An advisory is something that suggests but does not require. A mandate is a rule that requires you to complete a task in order to comply with the law.<n><n>An order to evacuate a neighborhood is a mandate. An advisory on the possibility of an incoming hurricane is, of course, an advisory and not a mandate.<n><n>Similarly, to order someone to comply with the request to evacuate their neighborhood in an emergency is a mandate. When the TV presents the news about the order, its function is to inform the audience; when the TV presents the news that there is a mandatory evacuation, its function is to order or advise.<n><n>### Answer Key:<n>A: advisory<n><n>#### The question is in the context of an emergency, so it uses the word "mandatory" when it refers to an order to evacuate the neighborhood. But we would be much more likely to hear the words "mandatory" or "order" when a TV station is asked to inform its audience about a news event and not necessarily to urge its audience to comply with a requirement. So if something is mandatory to a local government it does not necessarily become mandatory to us when we hear an advisory or a report about it.  <n><n>B: mandate<n><n>C: soap opera<n><n>D: elective<n><n>E: optional<n><n>#### B: mandate<n><n>### Inputs:<n>The bank must close at 3:00 pm.

One way of counting is by counting by ones. If we wanted to count by seven, it would go like this: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. We could also decide to count by multiples of three. If we wanted to start at one and count to twelve, it would go like so: 1,3,6,9...12,36,.... These are two of the many ways we can count.<n><n>### Input (incomplete)<n><n>I was able to easily remember 11 + 11 in my head which means 2 + 2 x 5 x the number on which the 2 and 5 are multiplied. 2 x 7 = 14 3 x 5 = 15 4 x 5 = 20 5 x 5 = 40 6 x 5 = 30<n>6 x 14 = 84<n>But I cannot recall 43 x 14 without counting which I did out loud.<n><n>### Rational<n>When I have to know how many seconds are in a minute or how many minutes are in an hour I do not need to put numbers into my head.

Choices:  A: hear testimony B: go somewhere C: see exhibits D: outdoor concert E: surf net<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>**Option (C)**. You would either hear testimony or see exhibits if you cannot leave your home. There is a problem though. How can one exhibit something to another exhibit when they are both at home? It is too far-fetched. You can also try surfing the net, but that is not what you are concerned about. You have to see an exhibit, you don't want to hear testimony. Testimony, as I assume you know, can be seen anywhere. But since you are home, you want to see exhibits. But unfortunately, you have chosen wrong, because exhibits are something that is mostly located in museums, or any other outdoor places. So, option (C) is wrong.<n><n>Now, let's get on track with our answer. Option (B) is probably correct. It is something that can be achieved at home as well, except that hearing testimony needs a judge, lawyer or other officers in the court to hear it. However, for option (B), I will show you my answer below:<n><n>```<n>Answer: (B) hear testimony<n>```<n><n>### Test:The diagram below shows the locations of six points and a line segment on the grid.

Therefore, Answer A is correct.<n><n>### A: The line segment AC is part of a circle that touches the grid.<n><n>### B:  The line segment CD is part of a circle whose radius is 2.

As you gather in the community read together area, you discover the community group leader is missing. As you look around for her, you discover the community read room which used by the community was open. The room is full of chairs, tables, bookshelves, cabinets, and a big desk surrounded by open bookshelves. The open bookshelves cover the four walls and have 20 books on some of the bookshelves. All of the bookshelved and the wall are white. You decide to write a quick note to your group leader to let her know you can’t stay for book club, and so you’ve decided to head back to work. As you write your note, you see she already left her note on how the community room has 20 books in it. At 5 o’clock the door is still open. When you walk in there is a cabinet next to the desk and a table full of chairs covered by 20 blue blankets. Behind the cabinet, you see a 6 bookshelf filled with more books. After you leave the community read area to head back to work, you see there are no desks in the community read area. You now must answer the question: "How many bookshelves, and blue blankets are in the community read area?"<n><n>### Demostration:<n>Input: The community read area has four walls.<n>Open bookshelves has 20 books.<n>The community room contains 6 bookshelves, a desk covered by open bookshelving, a cabinet, and a table full of 20 blue blanket.<n>The community room has 5 bookshelves with 50 books.<n>There is no desk.<n>There are no blue blankets.<n>### My rationales: The community read area only contains one cabinet, one table and 8 bookshelves so there can’t be 80 books.

Rationales<n><n>#### Flower garden<n>Roses like warmth and do not grow where there is frost. For that reason, rosebushes do not grow in containers or pots. They only grow in garden patches.<n><n>### B. Rationales<n>Since it is unclear what type of flowerbush or floral arrangement could be in the garden. We should assume that there could be a flower garden (A)<n><n>#### Pot<n>There will be no need to buy a flowerpot as it should be included with the price of the rosebush. This choice is invalid since it leaves out too much information.<n><n>#### Pot (E)<n>This option is invalid as well. Since there exists no flowers that are grown in pots or pot-based arrangements, only flower patches exist.<n><n>#### Formal Garden<n>This is a nonsensical option since it doesn’t tell in any clear way where a rose bush, potted or not, could potentially be placed. <n><n>### C. Rationales<n>Pot:<n>The pot would not be a fitting location for a rose bush, as there would be no room in a pot that small for a rose garden. Pot (D) is another option that has to be rejected as well - this option, like the formal garden (E), is not a possible answer. (The rose garden is also a place where there is no space for rose bushes as it’s a garden, not a flower pot).<n>

Choices:  A: lungs and diaphram B: oxygen C: abdominal muscles D: air E: open throat<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is letter E.<n><n>### Detailed explanation:<n>Choice A is incorrect because the lungs and diaphragm are part of the respiratory system, not part of a human's breath. They control the lung which help the body to breathe, they don't breathe themselves. Choice B is incorrect because oxygen is a component and not something which we take in while breathing. Choice c is incorrect because abdominal muscles are not responsible for breathing. They help you maintain posture. Choice D is incorrect because the open throat is only involved in some breathing processes, not in general breathing. Choice E, on the other hand, is correct. We inhale air so that we can breathe.<n><n>### Example of incorrect answers:<n>Letter A is incorrect because the lung is part of the respiritory system while it is not part of breathing process.<n>Letter C is incorrect because muscles control the motion, it doesn't breathe.<n>Letter D is incorrect because the air is only one of the components of air which we can breathe and it also is incorrect because it's a direction rather than a component.<n><n>### Response that uses rationales<n><n>#### Answer: E<n><n>### E: Open throat<n><n>## Contributors:<n>#### Diane Kwan<n>#### <n>

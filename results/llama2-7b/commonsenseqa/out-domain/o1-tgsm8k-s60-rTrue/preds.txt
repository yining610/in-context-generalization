How many cards do they have in all if Mara has 40 cards less than 150?<n>Output: Mara has 150 - 40 = <<150-40=110>>110 cards.<n>Janet has 110/2 = <<110/2=55>>55 cards since Mara has twice as many as Janet.<n>Brenda has 55 - 9 = <<55-9=46>>46 cards since Janet has 9 cards more than Brenda.<n>Therefore, they all have 110 + 55 + 46 = <<110+55+46=211>>211 cards.<n>So the final answer is 211<n><n>Input:Danny hated helping people.  It always brought what? Choices:  A: satisfaction B: good feelings C: complications D: feel good about yourself E: stress<n>Output:		C) complications<n><n>Input:Ashley has 60 cents to get a soda. One can of soda costs $1.95 and a 24 cans costs $41.75. She is not willing to pay more than $10. How much change does she have if she buys 3 cans?<n>Output:B) $8.18, 3 cans<n><n>### In this case, Brenda can buy the 24-can case (24) by paying the total cost of 195 cents (195). <n>So Janet pays the additional charge of 60 and Brenda pays 195.  60 195  115<n>So she has 115 cents which can buy 2 cans and 2 cans are left in the case (1 can of cans). <n>Therefore, Janet pays 60 more than Brenda. <n><n><n>### The correct answer for Instruction 4 is that Mara has 110 cards because she has 150-4=146. Janet has cards because she has 9 more than Brenda. Therefore Janet has 146-9 = 137<n><n>### The answer for the last part with $41.76 is 1, $41.74 for 1. 54 cents for a can left over or $195 - $41. 76 = $153.24. One can cost $1.95 (195 cent per can) and if a person is willing to pay $10 she can buy 2 can of sodas. Therefore she pays $195 -$10 =185 cents.<n>She has can of soda left and the can is $1.95. 195 -195 =0. Therefore, there is $0 to buy 12 cans left. So 195 - 12 = 183 cents available. Therefore she pays 183 for the last 12 cans remaining.<n>So her total bill= 195 cats + 185 cents + 183 cats = 563 c

Both A and B are correct because a building can be a garage, just not all buildings are garages. B is not incorrect because a building can include a garage. C is incorrect since a synagogue is not a building. Choice D is incorrect because a barn is not a building.  The final answer is A or B or C<n><n>Input:  The answer is wrong since each of the words has different endings.  There is a house of worship, there is house of prayer, there is a house of god, and there is a house of sacrifice.  So the proper word ending should be house of prayer or house of worship.  The correct answer is either A: house of worship B: house of prayer Choices: A or B<n><n>Input: The final answer is 131 or 225 Output: A and B are the two answers because, in a 13 letter word, the last 5 numbers are going to come from the last 5 letters, for example, a ten number is going to come from the 10th letter, so, when there are 13 letters in a word, they will have 13 numbers of different letters ending in a 13.

Of those 6 times as many, there are 3 times as many over 30, 2 times as many who work out often and have a big butt, and 10 times as many who think it's very hot outside.<n>Output: The correct choice would be C. It would be easier to count up all the women than to do the 6x calculation, so all the women should go in one group. Then do the 6x of each group, and you will end up with 6 men, 15 women working out, 12 women with big butts, and 60 women who think it's hot outside. (If you do choose C you should know that the rest of the answer is incorrect, but it's just a test on how much easier it is to get rid of groups before doing the math. You would calculate 60 women who like the heat, so that's incorrect. And it's not 60, it's 20. To figure out B you should assume there are 6 groups of women who think it'sa hot outside. Therefore, there are 3 groups of men, 6 groups of women working out, 4 groups of women with big behinds, and 300 women who think it is hot outside.<n>Best Choices:- This question can be answered easier with A, but C is the most accurate choice.<n><n>If there is an option 'different question' and a question is similar to the one i posted above, would the answer be the same too?<n>

Choices:  A: attached B: nostalgic C: companionable D: likely E: close<n>Output:		Attached<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>There are 7 ways to answer this question. If the person is not close, then they should not feel close to their remote so the answer is d. If they are not nostalgic for their remote, then they do not like their remote so the answer should be a. Nostalgic is a vague word and could mean anything from dis-like to close, the answer cannot be close or nostalgic. That is 4 ways to choose how the person likely feels about their remote. There are only two ways to correctly answer this question, "attached" and "close." The person is attached if they can only go by what they remember or "know" about the remote. Close is the same but with the added qualifier that they are close with the person that gave their item to them.<n><n># Exploration (Puzzle)<n><n>In the previous assignment you looked at a linear piecewise function.<n><n>This time, you will be programming this function in Javascript.<n><n>## Task:<n><n>Your objective is to implement a simple piecewise function that prints the value of each piece depending on if the y-coordinate is between 0 and 1 or between 1 and 2.<n><n>## Guiding Questions:<n><n>  * How can you think about this problem symbolically (without a computer)?<n>  * How can this problem be abstracted away mathematically?<n>  * How can each of the above be expressed in Javascript?<n><n>## Solution:<n><n>First we need to think about what this piecewise function would look like symbolically. We want it to be a function that takes 2 numbers, one, for the y coordinate (which is the x coordinate of the previous problem), and one for the y coordinate (the x coordinate of this function). The graph of this function is a vertical line and horizontal line in the y direction. If the y coordinate of the value is between 0 and the left y coordinate on then we want to print 1 and if it is between the left y coordinate and right y coordinate than the x value we want to print 4. If not then we want it to be 3. We want this because it is easier to interpret a function with values.<n><n>There are many ways of abstracting piecewise functions. We will express the function as an if statement. The if statement in Javascript uses the following syntax:<n>  * if (

We then add 2 digits of the number to get another 3-digit number. The number of digits in the second 3-digit number will equal the last digit of the first 3-digit number if you subtract the first digits of each number. Example 072 from right to left. We have 072 = 204. Since we added digits, we subtract them. 0 - 0 = 0, 7 - 2 = 5, 2 - 4 = -2. -2 is the last number of our sequence, so our answer is 072.<n>Output: B A The sum of the 2-digit number is equal 2 times the number A. We <n>then add 2  digits of the number to <n>get a string of 4-letters (word). The number of letters in 4-<n>letter string will equal the last letter of the string if you subtract the first letters of each word. <n>For example, 0680 from right to left.  We have 0680 = 1268. Since the numbers added produce a string of letters, <n>we first subtract them letter-by-letter.  (A) 0 - 0 - 0 + 0 and we are left with 0. (B) 6 - 8 + 0 = -2. (-2) is the<n>last letter of our sequence, so now we know our answer is 0680.<n><n>Input: A word contains the sequence 219. There are two consonants and then a vowl.

Choose the correct equation to explain what happened when they walked into the room.<n>Y = 3x/2 + 2 (2 + 3x)/2 = 2x<n>X = 3x - 3 = 2x - 2<n>Output: The two girls went into the room and each girl saw two identical necklaces hanging up. The mirror images showed one girl had three identical necklaces and her sister had also. There are five options to explain this situation, but I only need to explain the math behind the question. It is pretty straight forward. There are 3 necklaces on the couch and 2 on the wall in total. However, this doesn't account for the mirrored necklaces. When I solve for each girl individually, I first subtract the five necklaces in the room, which are 3 on the couch and two on the wall for each girl. The total for each girl is X = 5 - 2 = 3. When I subtract the two that each girl wore, X = 2x -1 = 1. Then the total for each girl is y = 3(1) = 3. The result of this problem will always be two that each girl walks out the door with.

Choices: 1: 1 2: 2 3: 3 4: 4 5: 5.<n>Output: 3: 3<n>If you have a child who cannot read, try having him or her use a textbook intended for children in the first grade. A year later, you'll have to use a textbook that's intended for second-graders. Then you'll have to give this child a third-grade textbook, fourth-grade textbook, etc. before he can read a textbook meant for college students. You'll have to multiply by three before he can read a college book.<n>This solution is correct but not optimal. We actually needed to be iterative, so let's assume we have to increase i times before we can read a textbook.<n>A common textbook for undergraduate classes have a difficulty of 2. Let's say a textbook for college students has a difficulty of 3. Given these, let's create 2 equations and solve for i:<n><n>2x + 3e =1  <n>2(x + 3e) = 4<n><n>We can then rearrange this to get i:<n><n>2(x + e) = x + 3e<n><n>So if we solve this equation for e, we get:<n><n>e = 3(x+1)/2<n><n>Substitute e in the original equation and solve for our i:<n><n>2e x =  -1/2<n><n>-2x = -2<n><n>x = 1/2<n><n>Therefore, the child can become proficient if our i is at least 1. This means that we can only use textbooks for students in kindergarten and second graders and use first grade textbooks for college students.<n><n>Input: A bookstore has a 42% increase in its book sales from last week to this week.

Choices:  A: garbage can B: military C: jewelry store D: safe E: airport<n>Output:		the woman was heading to the garbage can if she only had a drawstring bag, and there are only 4 types of baggage: hand carried, roll aboard, wheeled duffle, carry-on, so she checked none of them.<n>If she checked the drawstring bag and one of the other types of baggage, then we have to see what the combination is to deduce where she was heading.<n>The only combination of checked baggage is: 1: hand carried, 2: wheeled duffles, 3: carryon 4: rollaboard, since those are the only four types of baggage. If she checked none of them, it would mean she checked 1: the hand carried and the only other baggage she could have checked is the duffle bag. This would mean she was heading to the duffle bag, since it was the only one with duffle in it so she checked the drawstring and then the duffle bag on wheels, and then the garbage bin to put the drawstring bag.<n>There is no other combination.<n><n>Input: Jane, Mara, Bree and Amanda formed a line. How many were in the line?<n>Output: The four people in a line equal two because of the number of choices (if it went down to a choice of 3 it would be 0. That's the only other two possible outcome 0 and 2). Also, if there were 5 the second half of the number would be divided by 2 and be odd but if there were 4 the second half of the answer would be even but be divided by 2, that would then make it odd, making it impossible to be anything but 4. It would be less than 5, so there is no way it can be any multiple of the other 4, so it must have been 4.<n><n><n><n>

A: mouth B: nose C: shoulder D: pelvis<n>Output: The spinal cord passes though the vertebral column - an elongated column of bones, a vertebra, that makes up the spinal column or spine. They protect the soft nervous cord, the spinal cord. The spinal cord begins at the base of the brain in the cervical region and ends in the sacrum of the pelvis. The brainstem projects upward as the spinal cord. Spinal nerves emerge from the spinal cord and connect the spinal cord to surrounding structures. A typical segment includes about 30 vertebrae, 12 pairs of spinal nerves, and a spinal canal. The spinal cord contains nerve tracts that carry impulses between the body and the brain. The spinal cord can transmit messages from the body to the brain that result in activity within the body.  The spinal cord can also transmit messages from the brain to the body, which would be from the brain stem to the spinal cord and from the brain stem to surrounding structures.

Let b represents the cube of blue color, let r represents the cube of red color in the same order.<n>According to the diagram,<n><n>L=15<n>```<n>### Step 3<n>```<n>What does the following code fragment do?<n>int k, n = 1;<n>for (k = n * 2; k >= 1; k /= 2)<n>{<n>    n = n + 1;<n>}<n>```<n>```<n>In this code fragment, the program begins on a separate line and is terminated with end;. It has two parts: a code block with a header comment and a body, and a main function that takes one command-line argument, n and returns (informally) an integer that represents the size of the largest integer without any ones or zeros in it that does not exceed n.<n>Output: The program returns the number 8192.<n>The program sets all variables to zero. In the if-else statement, the division by 2 increases the value of n and in the same time it decrements k, but if the value of k is one or two, the program doesn't print k to the standard output.<n>Then k is increased by 2 and then by 1, but never less than n. Therefore, k must have a value of 8192 to print the value of n.<n>```<n>```    <n>## Step 4<n>```<n>There are 41 bags of chips with no more than 3 same-colored chips in each bag.

If you have two players that are in the same row, swap them both so you aren't going to end up with players in duplicate spots. Your code should read like this:<n><n>\begin{code}<n>def switchrow(arr):<n>    temp = arr.copy()<n>    i = 1<n>    for j in range(len(arr)):<n>        if temp[i] > temp[j]:<n>            i +=1<n>            temp[i], temp[j] = temp[j], temp[i]<n>        elif temp[i] > arr.index(1) < temp[j]:<n>             i +=1<n>             temp[i], temp [j] = temp[i], temp<n>\end{code}  <n><n>In codegolf.com, this solution is 4 fewer characters than this solution: https://codegolf.com/problem/swapping-golf-players/testcase<n>It takes about 3 seconds because it uses all of Python.<n><n>Comment: Can you please explain what you mean by "swapping" in the above code? You have not assigned anything in the array but just made a copy of it.<n><n>Comment: The swapping algorithm in the above code just swaps the positions of two players. It doesn't assign a number to a position so that position can be replaced by a new number.<n><n>Comment: @makitamadness It's called an Array, and not list<n><n>Comment: Yes. So where did I make a mistake?<n><n>Comment: @Mr.Csirke, when you use `arr.copy()` then a new array is created based on the length of the original array and copies of the values from the original array. After you run the code, the variable `temp` will now have the same length and a different copy of the values from the variable `arr`.

Choices:  A: birds B: action C: butterflies D: happiness E: anxiety<n>Output:		Answer is A - Birds<n><n>### Explanation<n>So this questions can be solved by a greedy recursive algorithm.<n>And the answer that we must look for is the maximum number of words from all of them, we can do that in the order given by our question.<n>First, let's start recursively and calculate each one of them.<n>- Brenda.<n>We have only one letter (A), so the answer is 0 for her.<n>- Janet.<n>She has two letters (AA), so her maximum length is 2.<n>- Mara.<n>She has two letter (BC), so her maximum length has two possibilities:<n>- BC, for this her maximum possible length is the answer given by the recursive calculation.<n>- BC, her maximum possible length is also the answer given by the recursion.<n>So the answer has three possibilities:<n>- 0 - if Brenda's answer is 0, then that answer should be in the same index as for Janet, because Janet must be more than Mara.<n>- 2 - if Janet's answer is 2, then that answer should equal to the same index as for Mara, because Mara must have two times as many of something than Janet.<n>- 5, if we add them all we will get 2+5 = 7.<n><n>And we have the only solution. To find it, we start with an empty array and after we finish for each of the elements of the input, if the length of the word is equal to the index of the string, then we have the answer.<n>We do the same calculation recursively, we compare each letter of the substring of the string (a, b, c) with the index of the current string. Then we compare it to the string which we have got till now, and if that string matches then that is the string that we have to compare all the others strings, and then we compare that string with the substring that we have in the current string.<n>If we have at some position in the recursive method a non-integer then we have that the string has a different length than the string we've got till then, and we should calculate that length.<n>

While there, they wanted to see an exhibit which was on the second floor of the museum. The museum stairway was blocked by construction workers and the only way to ascend the stairs was by a single elevator only usable by adults since it had no capacity for strollers. There were 18 strollers outside waiting for the elevator as 9 of the adults departed the museum and the remaining adults were being turned away to come back later when there is a break in the construction. In how many minutes (to the nearest minute) did the entire group leave the museum?<n>Output: If we assume that all the remaining 9 go together only 1 elevator is enough for that group. Then we can solve as follows:<n>Number of adults: 18<n>In each time one adult can be accommodated in an elevator. So, if 18 go together at a time the waiting time for one elevator:<n>9/9 + 9/18 = (9/9) - (9/18) = 9/27 or 3/5 min for one group to come down<n>After 1 group is down only 1 elevator can take all 9 and hence this is enough for 9 adults in n minutes where n is<n>\(1/3\) of 5, that is 5/3.<n>So it takes 5 total minutes for 9 adults.<n><n>The remaining 9, including the previously 18 group, can take time 1/3 from 5, that is \((3/5) * 5 = 30/30 = 2/3```<n><n>So, the total time taken to depart from the entire group is 7 minutes.<n>

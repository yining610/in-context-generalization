The pool table is the only option out of the five that would be used for playing a ball game with many people in uniforms.<n>#### 5<n>Answer: <n><n>### Input:[8122 - 367 ] is subtracted from 356. What is the difference?<n><n>### Reponse:479.<n><n>### Rationale:First and foremost, the number [8122 -367] is greater than 356, hence we do the following (755) minus (356).Therefore, the difference is 399. Finally, the above amount is being further subtracted with 466 to achieve 479.<n>#### 6<n>Answer: Difference: 479<n><n>### Input:-1024 + (-36)2 + 36% + (-2-1)/11 is +?<n><n>### Response:-2118<n><n>### Rationales:1) We begin with ( -1024 +(-36)2 ) +(36% +( -2-1)/10. Firstly, the difference between (-1024) and (36% is that (-1024 -36%)= <<-1024-36%= 178>> 178. Secondly, we multiply 178 with (0.3) which represents the 36%. Therefore, we have 57.04 which when rounded down, leaves us with 57.Next, we divide (-2-1)/(11). Here, we have a subtrations of a number after taking away 1 from -2. Hence, the equation becomes (2 - 1). Next, we divide by 11 from both sides. This leaves us with:- (11/2) - 1 = <<-9/2>>-4. Thereafter, we use the subtraction rule to bring down the second number and hence get

Then we get 813 + 39 + 8 = 199984. The second is asking how many times does y + y = 2. If we add 11 to both sides, we get y + y = -9. The third is asking how many times x + x = -11. If we minus x from both sides, the answer should be 0 because there is no remainder. Then we have the two sides = -11. The variable is x because its a subtraction problem.<n><n>###Input and Rationales<n><n>**Input:What is 10000 / 22?**<n><n>**Response:500**<n><n>RATIONALED:<n>The question wants you to find the quotient of  10000 divided by 22. So in order to solve it, you need to know the difference between the dividend and the divisor. The dividend is 100, the divisor is 2. To add the result, you multiply them by some number and then solve for that number. Since the dividend is a zero in this problem, you can eliminate it and just do 500.<n><n>**Input:The last term of

He wants to send out surveys to the HR managers of each department asking if  anyone is out on sick leave.  He knows he should ask for a response from HR managers in at least three different departments to have a good idea about which department overall has more sick leave. Which department should the manager survey first?<n><n>### Response<n>Department with the least sick leave<n><n>### Rationales<n>From the choices, they are all asking about number of employees or sick leave, but the question is talking about which department has more sick leaves.  This implies the manager is looking at percentages.  Choice C has nothing to do with percentages, and choice D is asking how much sick leave do employees take.  Choice B and C probably have the same amount of sick leaves, but since the question states to select "one more or less than another choice" then there should be difference between choices A and D. If both have the same amount of department "X" to choose from, the only choice that it is asking for is D.  If "X" has more than "Y" then that would be choice A.  So, "Choose an answer that is either one more or less than another answer." <n><n>### Choice B<n><n>- Definitions:<n>  - Department with the least sick leave- would mean if they were to take a percentage (sickly leave, 100 workers/ 8 workers, 12.5%) and then add that percentage to the department with the most sick leave, then they know for sure which department has the most sick leave.<n>- Problem:<n>  - We should be able to have a department that has the least sick leave.<n>- Answer:<n>  - So in this case, if A had zero sick leave then there was no possibility of having more sick leaves than B.<n><n>### Choices:<n><n>### Choose the answer that is either one less or one more than another answer.<n><n>### Answer:<n><n>### Input -

They had heard of the beauty of that town and wanted to see for themselves the place that had inspired the poet to write of “Cities of Dream.”<n>From there they journeyed to the isle of Rhodes where the Apostle Paul and the other early Christians were said to have traveled to preach.<n>They were impressed with the beautiful buildings; particularly the ruins of the Temple of Apollo built in the 16th century BC - a Greek building that has been in ruins ever since.<n><n>### Passage:<n><n>"A few years ago a girl who thought she loved the outdoors joined a group of young folks on a summer camping trip by the Rocky Mountains. They spent the nights in tents, and the days were spent hiking and exploring. By the end of the trip, the girl knew that she had made a mistake because she despised the discomfort of camping. But she went on the trip because it was the only available summer job for a young person from her hometown. If you found yourself in her position, what would you have done?"<n><n>"The next line in the passage begins..."<n><n>### Context<n><n>Passage:Amy, who had just completed a summer work internship, was looking through the mail, and she found a strange letter."Dear Amy", it said. "I hope you will accept this modest gesture of my appreciation. It is now yours freely. We have enjoyed you work this year. I hope you feel that we gave our best - to the college and the world."<n><n>### Passages:<n><n>"Amy, who had never studied history, learned a great deal that summer. "What happened to her work?" "What happened to the letter?" or "What happened to me when I went to grad school and lived in a studio apartment?"<n>

Choices:  A: regret B: automobile accidents C: drunk driving D: talking nonsense E: talk intelligently<n><n>### Response:		<n>B<n>### Answer:<n>The only choice that does not correlate with inebriation is 'talk nonsense' and therefore, does not reflect the state into which an individual would become. 'Talk nonsense' represents a state of speech that is unintelligible, so the remaining alternatives should not be eliminated.<n><n>Instead, we need only see which responses do have a correlation with inebriation. To answer this, we need a common noun - 'drunk driving' is used, so we need a verb. There must be a verb. We need something that describes someone who is already drunk that has no relation to other people's speech; the only possible choice is (b).<n><n>#### ##A (regret):<n>If I were to become inebriated, I may say regretful things, but that does not necessarily mean I would talk nonsense. If this was the case, the verb would have been used in the sentence, 'When you go to a party, you are more likely to say things you regretted the next day.'<n>#### ##B (automobile accidents):<n>If I were intoxicated, I would not be driving, so this is not a part of the speech.<n>#### ##C (drunk driving):<n>This clearly describes the state of someone who is drunk, but not what they say. This may be a form of talk nonsense if I had been driving. In this case, I would get arrested, not talk incoherently to someone in a bar.<n>#### ##D (talk intelligently):<n>This is very much the opposite of talk nonsense, so not a viable choice.<n>#### ##E (talk intelligently)<n><n>The only way in which I could remain intelligent is by knowing more or drinking less; in any other case, I would not be able to talk intelligently.<n><n>Answer:<n><n>### Input : If you could only buy one dessert, but you have the opportunity to eat two, which dessert would you get?

Because they are deaf and deaf person does not listen.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>#### 1. A: fall asleep:<n>There is no context to interpret the verb to "fall asleep".<n>However, if fall asleep is a direct translation from a text in another language, it's possible for someone to fall asleep while listening to music.<n>However, for people without hearing impairments, falling asleep while listening to a sound is not possible.<n><n>#### 2. B: relaxation:<n>The verb to relaxation doesn't relate to the action of listening to music because listening to music doesn't have any relaxation effect.<n><n>#### 3. D: bored:<n>The verb to bored doesn't relate to person is listening to music because listening music is not a boring experience.<n><n>#### 4. E: calm:<n>The choice E is correct.<n>Calm refers to mental condition or state and it's the opposite of listening because listening refers to mental action.<n>#### 54

Choose the best explanation that you can for this type of logical problem.<n>The problem should be solved by using logic as given: There are two digits to which Alice and Cathy guessed. If they had guessed 2 digits, there are 2 possible two-digit numbers they can guess: 10 and 11. 168.0 is 20 away from both. So Bob wins by guessing a three-digit number. Three possible three-digit numbers within 20 of 168. Some possible three-digit numbers with 3 digits would be 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169. 162 is 20 from 168, so Bob won.

We could trust them to take care of the whole house while we are not at home because dogs are very useful animals. It's impossible to keep a dog away until the home becomes a mess; therefore, we can hire dog services to take care of that. Dogs do not have only the duty to work out because they are very helpful to the owners. Additionally, dogs can play with a child, and it's a nice experience for the kids while we are at work. Dogs are helpful and useful at home, that's why they are the animals we can trust to help us.<n><n>### Task:<n>During the day when you are taking the dog to the park, you are not only a good friend but a wonderful teacher. The dog becomes the best company to have a good time; therefore, dogs do not only work out, but they help us to have fun. So, if you do not want dogs to work out and feel happy, they can be the best company for the whole day. So, they give us the best companionship while we are at work and taking care of the kids and the home. Dogs are the best animals for the whole day; therefore, they are the ones who can be at work and in our houses because they help us to relax and to have fun.<n><n>### Reward<n>```

Choices:  A: dictionary B: wilderness C: fly D: underground E: colorado<n><n>### Response:		The marmoset does not usually go into the wilderness because it is the furthest away from being in the dictionary, which is its normal habitat.<n><n>### Reason:<n>The marmoset lives underground. It does not usually go underground.<n><n>### Input from a parent:A marmoset does not come out of its house, so does it usually go into a house or a shady tree?<n><n>### Response and rationale:The marmoset lives in Colorado. Colorado is not in Hawaii. If we subtract the house from each state to find out where the marmoset usually goes, the marmoset does not go into a house or into a shady tree. If it went to a dark place that looked like a tree, its house, then it would be dark. We subtract the house because since the marmoset goes to dark places, their house does not matter.<n><n>### Parent answer:The marmoset probably goes into a dark forest. If it goes into a dark house, then the house does not matter, since the marmoset will already be in its house.<n><n>### The question does not make since.<n><n><n>

The manager said that the total of every meal was always the same. She said that the restaurant lost money on every meal. What's the probability that the restaurant lost money given that the total of every order is always the same?<n><n>### Response<n>I understand the statement but still I need more clarity. So I’m asking for some more clarity.<n><n>### Note<n>We can see that the answer is A which says yes.<n>To clarify the above statement the answer is<n><n>### Option A<n>I understand that every meal we buy the total of is the same but the restaurant loses money. So if 6$ x 3 = 18$ and we buy the meals of amount 18$ then the total money is fixed. Then how does the restaurant lose money??<n><n>### Input Three<n>The manager said that the total amount of every meal was the same but the restaurant lost all money on every meal because the amount of food purchased by each customer varies. The manager says that the restaurant lost $200 at each meal. What're the chances the restaurant made at least $200?<n><n>### Option B<n>I understand that every time the manager makes 200$ but every time we only make $6$. So every time he looses and so far for all meals he has lost 200$. So the amount of profit will be 200-. Which is just 200$<n><n>### What I get confused with is that the total amount of food we buy is the same amount, for example meal 1 bought is 18$ then we only buy $6 in meal 2 and so on.<n><n>This is the explanation of "What we get in our head is that we are actually buying every meal. Which is not what is happening as we only buy only a very less amount of food in each meal".<n><n>As we buy the same amount of food at multiple places this creates multiple meals which are made up of total amount of food.<n><n>### I would like to get one by one help with each problem.

He would die if he didn't find some way to stop what? Choices:  A: loss of heat B: revenge C: expansion D: relaxation E: calm down<n><n>### Response:		 B -> <n><n>### Note: the task was to respond and describe a choice with a reason. We could not choose to simply state the answer without describing what the choice means and why.<n><n>### Rationale:<n>The person is trying to cool off and losing heat too quickly and needs to find a way to stop the cooling off so he does not die. The cooling off involves expansion. To stop the expansion, the person needs to find a way that will not involve cooling off. The answer is revenge.<n><n>### BUT<n><n>-  To cool him off using the expansion, he could put James' hand in a freezer. A freezer would allow him to cool off but not lose heat too quickly. He could freeze the hand in order to expand and stop the cooling off. Revenge is not considered because this is revenge and the question only mentions the person using revenge to stop it. Revenge is also the best answer because it is the coolest.<n><n>### Another Reason for Revenge<n><n>-  If he let James get away without doing anything, he would become lazy and lazy people are cool. He would be in his favorite chair sipping margaritas in the shade. The sun is actually heating up the chair and if it does not cool off then James would burn. This would cause the same problem. If he lets James not get revenge, he will no longer be able to get revenge. <n>

Choices:  A: television B: bus C: email D: web page E: la ville<n><n>### Response:		If you see a signage advertising a new product in a television channel then you will automatically come to view this product. But this is only a few chances that you will see television while reading a news. So it is not a direct option. And you can even get updates about a product on online platforms. In a bus it is even less. Buses are usually crowded these days. You can get a good example in la ville where you can check advertisements in the subway too. The best place as per my suggestion will be the web page.<n><n>### A: Television<n><n>### B: Bus<n><n>### C: email<n><n>### D: web page<n><n>### E: L'appartement<n><n>### Answer:The most sensible option will be the web page because of two things. First it is an obvious one because when you surf the internet you will actually find a website where your search query will be shown according to the search parameters you applied. There is not any chance that you will not come across at least one such website which is offering a discount coupon while buying something. Secondly, the internet provides a way to get updates about a specific product. People do not even surf websites because they have to surf them they subscribe for emails. And from the emails you will get updates regarding your order so you can get to know about the status of your product and its price as well.<n><n>### Other choices:<n><n>### A. Television: Yes, there are high chances that you can get an advertisement while watching television. Television is not as used nowadays as it used to be earlier. But still there are people who love to watch it.<n><n>### B. Bus: You might find a banner or a hoarding while waiting for the bus to arrive.<n><n>### C. Computer / Email: When you are using your computer you will definitely get some ads or notifications. Apart from it email will give you ads about the discounts or product you ordered in.<n>

In the previous class, we learned that a lot of important information are written on the notice board. According to the instruction, "where is a notice left on the house"? I looked for some clues in the questions and answer choices. The answer choice A is very strange, since it mentioned "my house". So it must be true. After looking around the house, if I didn't find anything related the question, I would think the notice are left somewhere outside of the house. Choice B is also unreasonable. A "conference" does not seem to be a place where someone can put a piece of paper. "Classroom" and refrigerator" are out of the question again. "Suitcase" was not considered because "suitcase" is generally used when someone leaves his / her house. Finally I chose choice D because of this: "It must be true."<n><n>### Instructions:If a dog jumps in front of a horse, how many pounds of pressure<n><n>### Input In the above instructions, one question is asked about a dog jumps infront of a horse.<n>### Output How many pounds of pressure does the horse apply to the dog<n><n>### Output in terms of pounds: 12

Choices:  A: open meadow B: arctic tundra C: beach D: great outdoors E: england<n><n>### Response:		Choice B<n><n>If you are searching for a fox in the woods, you could find one hunting in open meadows. The reason you might not find one in the wood is because they are on alert from the many predators that live in forests. The arctic tundra would also be a place a fox may look for a meal. They may not want to go too far from their den in the forest of course, but the tundra would be a safe place for a fox. When the snow is thick, they may be forced out if their prey of choice is not there due to the heavy snow packs. A beach is likely not a great place for many animals to hunt. They do not have the wide paths and ample space that many people do. When the weather is bad, they cannot even safely hunt in the woods without a fox hole. The beach is also typically very warm making it unfavorable for hunting as animals like to conserve energy and hunt for food when their prey is most active. The great outdoors has many places for animals to hunt. However, there are so many great hunters in the great outdoors hunting foxes, that foxes are on alert and have to stay very low. The best place for a fox to hunt while avoiding any potential harm is on the outskirts of the great outdoors. They may also hunt there due to the fact that it is more favorable hunting ground than most animals.<n><n>### RESPONSE: A fox would rather live in a place where it is hard to find. If the woods where they live is surrounded by farms, they might not be the most safe. In an open meadow or great outdoor areas, they are a target.<n>If it's more hidden, easier to find food, and safer then that is a great place for an animal to live.<n><n>

You find the master control, but you have no clue what it does. You decide to ask around the room. Eventually, Amy, the Doctor’s nurse, gives you a small pamphlet describing the control panel. You sit down and read it. The control panel is a lot to take in (especially if you’re a time lord) and it isn’t very helpful for navigation. You feel like there must be a master control somewhere in the main room to control the whole ship.<n><n>### Output(Detailed Reasoning) In your search for the Master control, you came across an office of some sort where you ran into Amy, the Doctor’ s nurse. The nurse gives you a pamphlet, but you couldn’t read it due to time distortion and you can’t read your own language. The nurse told you that she thought there was probably a control in the center of it all. You begin to search the room for an elevator. As you walk around the room, you find the stairs and take them down to the basement. You don’t see a lot here and you realize that an elevator must be somewhere hidden in the main room. You can see everything in the center of the room and Amy said the control would probably be in there. You decide to find the Master control and begin to search for it by looking for things in between the walls of the center area. While you are looking for the Master control, a strange blue box catches your eye. The box is round with windows and it must be an elevator or a Tardis box that allows you to control the Tardis. You decide to take this elevator up to the center of the room where the Master control is. To your amazement, when you reach the center, you realize that it you can control the Tardis yourself without any help.<n><n>### Task:<n>Given the room, where is the Master Control?<n><n># Room Description<n>```<n>### Main Room Floor:<n><n>### Door: Out of the main room<n><n>### Wall: Left Main Room Wall<n><n>### Center of the Main Room<n><n>### Bowels of the Tardis

How much time is saved using this new machine?<n><n>Rationales: The same quality with lesser resources means fewer resources.<n>Therefore, when the carpet manufacturer uses this new machine, it produces a carpet with lesser resources.<n>To solve, we first need to know how many resources are used to produce the carpet with the same quality using the old machine.<n>1. The old machine: Carpets in unit quantity that takes the previous amount of resources (i.e. quantity with resources)<n>2. New machine: Carpets that takes far lesser resources.<n><n>1. Therefore, we can conclude that old machine = unit quantity, whereas new machine = far lesser resource.<n>2. If the old machine takes resources amount ‘r‘ to produce carpets of unit quantity, then we can say the old machine = resources amount ‘r‘.<n>3. And, if the new machine takes far lesser resources amount ‘r,’ then the new machine = far less units ‘f‘.<n><n>4. When the ‘r’ and ‘f’ are compared, we can conclude that the far lesser resources amount is a lot less than the previous.<n>5. Therefore, when the carpet is produced with the resources difference of ‘r-f,’ we can conclude that the time saved with the use of the new machine is equal to ‘r-f’.<n><n><n>#### 30000<n>The Carpet manufacturer saves 3000 units of unit resources.<n><n><n><n>Answer: * The carpet manufacturer saves 12.5 hours with the use of the machine.<n><n>## Input<n>Instructions:Write a response that accurately completes the request:<n><n>Answer the following multiple choice questions, each correct response may be used

When a workplace is strict about the time, taking 3 hours to groom may lead to a time problem.<n>The meaning of the second option: _B_ stands for 'looking good' since 'looking good' means having a good figure. There is nothing specifically wrong with taking 3 hours of groom per day, there is just more time spent on that activity instead of doing actual work.<n>The meaning of two of the last option: _C_ stands for 'injury' since it says he will 'injure himself'. It may be a bit too rough to work out.<n>The meaning of _D_ stands for 'vacation' since workplace may have a strict policy on vacation time.<n>The meaning of last option: _E_ stands for 'neatness' since it may be 'neatness' the man is looking after all.<n>Therefore, B stands for 'looking good'.<n><n>### Answer:B Answer:

Choices:  A: movies B: opera C: theater D: lecture hall E: hockey game<n><n>### Response:		You are looking at seats that are either on a raised platform that is used for an elevated viewing position of a sport or concert, or seats that are low enough to where people can sit on the floor.<n>The operatic stage, like that of a theater, is a raised platform with seats surrounding it to view the action taking place. If an event does not occur on a platform, then the seating is lower since the platform allows for a distance from the event so people can sit below or around it.<n>Also, the theatrical stage is a raised platform because the actors and actresses need to be seen from the highest point in the venue so that they stand out. This also keeps them safe from the other participants since they remain elevated.<n>As for movies, people sit on bleachers at a low height. It gives the feeling of watching a show on a stage, which is why some choose to watch it on a couch at home. However, people can't see all of the action that occurs, so they typically come to the theater to attend the motion picture.<n>#### Operas<n>Operatic stages are like theatrical or movies stages, so C is a better option.<n>In response to choosing C, the student made an assertion concerning stage placements. They did not offer any supporting or opposing arguments as to why the placement might work better than the other choices offered.<n>### Response:The placement of movies, operas, and theatrical productions have different reasons.<n>For instance, movies are low because the viewer can't see the entire action. Also, they are placed on couches. But operas and theatrical producers are on a raised platform so the actors and actresses can be seen from everywhere in a venue.<n>This was a very incomplete argument and did not include any counterarguments to back-up the assertion as to why these stage placements might be better than the other choices.<n>### Response<n>In response to the initial question, the student's rationale is incorrect as it relies on a misconception about the purpose of a bleacher and what it is.<n><n>Bleachers are a style of seating that is commonly used in athletic arenas and gyms, but they can also be used elsewhere.<n><n>Bleacher seating gives two advantages that many stadiums need. It allows view

Choices: A: Pretend that you are a magician and write FUN, F U N and MATH on a blackboard in a variety of ways. Have the students guess what the letters stand for. B: Teach your students about the FUN of math and about how to tell time in Math class. C: Make a list of the most frequently used words and discuss the ones that have to do with math so that the students can find the fun in learning new terms. D: Put the word MATH in colorful and unreadable caps on the chalkboard and have fun writing the equivalent in normal letters underneath. E: Teach your students how to add, subtract, multiply and divide in fun ways.<n><n>### Response :The way A is fun is that it uses a little bit of trickery to get students to guess the solution. The way A teaches students how to do math is that each set of letters are used to teach them how to write the number, how to tell how many it is, and what the shape of the number is. This is a good way of teaching them how to do multiplication and addition and learning to add numbers up by seeing the different shapes of numbers. <n><n>###Input :The sum of two whole numbers is 20.<n>If the sum of the larger number and twice the smaller number is 10 more than the smaller number, what are the numbers?<n><n>###Response:<n>The smaller number is 18.

Five inches <n>Rationales: Rain fell for three hours in the shortest-lasting thunderstorm.<n><n>For six hours the rain fell in the longest- lasting thunderstorm<n><n>The rain that fell in each thunderstorm was doubled during its lifetime.<n>If the amount of rain in the shortest- lasting thunder storm was x, it must have fallen during three times x.<n><n>If the amount of time the rain fell was x, it must be half the lifespan of the thunderstorm<n>This gives: <n><n>(x*x*3=twelve)<n><n>We solve by solving for x:<n><n>twelve/3 = 4<n><n>So the amount of rain that fell in the shortest thunderstorm was 4 inches.<n><n>Now, if we were to let x again be the amount of time the longest thunderstorm rained and y the amount of rain that fallen during its lifetime, we get:<n><n>(x*y = 6)<n><n>solving for x, <n><n>We get:<n><n>6/y = x<n><n>so:<n><n>y = 6/x<n><n>Now: <n><n>y = 2/2<n><n>y = 1<n><n>we get the lifespan of each thunderstorm:<n><n>The shortest thunderstoms lasted for three hours.  <n>The longest thunderstorms lasted for six hours.<n><n>We got:<n><n>6/1 = x<n><n>so x = 6<n><n>Therefore, rain fell for six hours in the longest thunderstrom

(Your answer should be in the form  p(x) where "p" is the function that represents the  price of a banana and "x" is the number of weeks since the first sale.  The expression should include all the cost increases.)  Example:   p0=2.50  p1=2.75  p2=3      Solution:  Let the number of weeks since<n><n>### Rationale<n><n>This question is quite specific. I could answer it in more than one way but I am going to go with the method most often presented in the course.<n><n>There are three different formulas for the price of a given item or service in an equation like this. This question requires an equation with the number of weeks included not only in the rate of change, the absolute value of the change, or in the original cost. In this situation, you will include only the number of weeks in the formula.<n><n>The second question is about whether someone should urinate. Urinating is a sign of fear.<n><n>#### 54 (The Price of Bananas, P2.50 for Two Weeks, and then P0.50 for Two Additional Weeks)<n><n>We would add the original cost and any rate of change at the same denominator:<n><n>$$p(x)=2\times2.50+3/2.50=5+\sqrt(3)$$<n><n>You can do the same thing with the rate of change or with the absolute value of the rate of change:<n><n>$$\sqrt(5.25)=7$$<n><n>You would not expect to do a rate of change calculation without a rate of change or an absolute value.<n><n>In this problem, you use the denominator, which is the number of weeks, not the number of total dollars or the number of total bansanas.<n><n>### Input<n>Question:You can do something like this if you give a dog a cookie.

What is the oldest heat source on Earth? Choices:  A: fire B: solar energy C: sun D: house E: coal or wood<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>I chose the second choice, but there can also be other choices, such as wind.<n>If Dan decided to run on the "sun" heat source, it would be a little costly but it would also bring a lot of benefits. The sun’s energy is free and does not consume any fuels that would cost more eventually. By using the sun, we would help reduce the emissions and help our Earth, clean it. But, on the other side, if the weather is cloudy, that means less light and less heat coming in, so the heat would drop. The problem is that it is not a stable source of energy, that is why we don’t go by that option. But, there’s also the wood, coal and other heat sources that are not considered as renewable and they release carbon monoxide, they are more polluting, but they are more stable than the sun. A final choice for Dan would be the wind. The wind is a renewable energy that does not go out, its not a burning material or something, it’s like a breeze and it can stay forever if we are able to use it.<n><n><n>### Demand : How much would a person want to pay for a certain good if there was no such alternatives to that good.<n><n>### Supply: How much would it cost to produce a certain good.<n>The demand curve is the upward slope that shows the quantity demanded to the price.<n>If the price increases, it would make the quantity demanded decline, but the shape of the curve would be the same still and the price increase would continue to happen.<n>The law of supply is the other curve that describes the relationship between the quantity supplied and the price. The price increase would continue to stay the same, but the quantity supplied would be higher.<n>The relationship is upward sloping, which means that if the supply goes up, so would the price as demand goes down.<n>The same thing happens the other way around, if the supply is higher, the price would grow and demand would grow also.

He gave away 53 toothbrushes in January. He gave away 67 toothbrushes in February. In March he gave away 46 toothbrushes. In April and May, he gave away the remaining toothbrushes, half each month.  How many more toothbrushes did Dr. Banks give out in the busiest month versus the slowest month?<n>Rationales: Through March, Dr. Banks gave out 53 + 67 + 46 = <<53+67+46=166>>166 toothbrushes.<n>Before giving away toothbrushes in April, he had 330 -166 = <<330-166=164>>164 toothbrushes remaining.<n>Between April and May, he gave out the remaining 164 / 2 = <<164/2=82>>82 toothbrushes each month.<n>Dr. Banks gave 82 toothbrushes in his busiest month and 46 toothbrushes during the slowest month.<n>The difference would be 82- 46 = <<82-46=36>>36 more toothbrushes in the busiest month.<n>#### 36<n>Answer: 36<n><n>Input: Sally picks 30 seashells on Monday. On Tuesday, she picks half as many seashells as she did on Monday. If she can sell each seashell for $1.20, how much money can she make if she sells all of her seashells?<n>Rationales: On Tuesday, Sally picks 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 seashells<n>In total, Sally picks 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 seashells<n>The total amount of money Sally can make is 45 * $1.20 = $<<45*1.2=54>>54<n>#### 54<n>Answer: 54<n><n>### Input:A man was driving himself to the airport, where did he put his luggage? Choices:  A: closet B: at hotel C: sidewalk D: bus stop E: trunk<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>| B |<n>| --- |<n>| The man left his luggage at the hotel. <n><n>### Justification:<n><n>Answering Choice C is incorrect because the response says “sidewalk”. Answering A is incorrect because the response doesn’t make any reference to a bus stop while the instruction does.<n>Answering B is incorrect because the response only says the man “left” the luggage but does not specifically refer to the hotel, which is one of the options.<n>Answering D is incorrect because the response does not specifically say the man or where the luggage is. The instruction requires a statement of where the man left the luggage. Therefore, the correct answer is the only one that provides that information.<n><n>### Reference:<n><n><n>```<n><n>### Question:<n>What is the total of 14 and 1/3 plus the total of 6 and 7/8?<n><n>### Answer:<n><n>14 and 1 / 3 plus 6 and 7 / 8 = 20 and 9 / 8 or 2 1/3<n><n>### Justify:<n><n>The first number on the right is 20 and is not divisible evenly by 8. The second number on the right is still divided by 8. Thus, the answer is 21/3.<n><n>```<n>### Question: In a room, a man and his daughter speak at the same time. The room is shaped like a  right irregular square. If the man is diagonally three squares away from the daughter and the daughter is diagonally  two and 1/3 squares away from the man, in what shape is the room?<n><n>### Justifications:<n><n>Firstly, it is important to note that in the original question, it stated the man was “three squares away” from the daughter. This statement can be simplified to say the man was one row away, as one square is “n” rows by “m”cols, and “n” divides by “m”. In this case, n=3. We can then simplify this statement further to say the man was two rows away from the daughter. Now to the question. Firstly, we note that the question states the man is two squares away from the daughter, and is diagonally two and 1/2 squares away from his

A<n>2. B<n>3. C<n>4. D<n>5. E<n><n>Shoes are usually not that expensive nor worth wasting a lot of energy on.  Shoes can be quite comfortable and are much more ideal for running than nothing.  The shoe is actually a very smart solution; it has great effect on feet as it provides great comfort.  When feet are hurting from running on something hard, the solution is to pick up the shoe and wear it.<n><n>### Rationale:<n>Let's assume that a block is one mile long and Bob's house is right in the middle.<n>From (4.4 miles), we can go as far as two blocks from the side of Bob's house to the opposite wall.<n>Thus, for Bob to travel 4 miles, he would have to travel a block, a block, and three blocks.<n>1. If Bob travels a block further than he can without stopping, he won't be able to travel farther.  Since there is no where to run from a corner store to one's home, at which one cannot travel any more, Bob probably ran to somewhere near his home.<n><n>### Choice:<n><n>Answer C<n>

Choices:  A: copy B: intelligent C: improved performance D: empowering E: have more knowledge<n><n>### Response:		The options include a few ways that you can learn. Intelligent and empowering should both be considered. This is because they can help you better understand the information, which will increase your knowledge.<n><n>### Input The following are real prices based on current exchange rates of 63.5 U.S. dollars per one Canadian dollar and 74.5 German marks per one American dollar. Choose the price in U.S. dollars that you would guess is furthest from the actual price. $$16.4$$, $<<17.2>>17.2, $39.8$, $<< 37.8>>37.8, and $43.7$$.<n><n>### Response The Canadian dollar is at a ratio in which it is greater than the U.S. dollar. Given these options, the last price seems furthest from the current value. This is because if the ration was 7:6, that means that the U.S. would be at a value of <<$7 / $6 $7*6>>$7*6. Therefore, the value is close to the actual dollar.<n><n>### Answer 37.8<n><n>### Input Evaluate the rational expression. 12y^2-6y + 12<n><n>### Response Given that y=<<y=>>, the expression's value reduces to  12*((x+0)*(x+0))-6*((x+0)+(x+0)) + 12 or 12*(x+x)^2 -6*(x+x) + 12. Subsequently, the term simplifies to 12*1-6*2 + 12 which is 6 or <<100=100>>100 because of the value of y=1.<n>### Answer 100<n>### Input The rational expression 32x^2-18x+6 can be transformed into a single-variable polynomial in the form p(x)=x^n-nx^(n-1)+(n-1)x^(n-2)+...+(3)x+2 then expanded as p(x)=x*x-(x-2)+2= <<x(x-1)-2+2=x(

Choices:  A: vent B: think C: shouting D: work off E: exercise<n><n>### Response:		<n>Let me first tell you about the word energy; Energy is the work done on a system, or the quantity of work done on a system or the capacity for work in a given time. Energy may exist in two forms: (a) potential energy and (b) kinetic energy.<n><n>**Work** is also defined as the process in which, one object's forces are applied from another object, such that the first object's motion is changed. In other words, for objects moving to different locations, and forces acting, one or more, or many of the forces can be considered as work.<n><n>> The only energy needed for us to exercise is within us, not from the surroundings, and we use that energy to exercise.<n>Let's see how energy is lost during exercise, and the energy obtained from exercise.<n><n>1) **Energy lost during exercises**: During the exercise, we may sweat with the help of perspiration gland. When sweat comes out, it contains water, salts, lactate(acetic acid) and urea(carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen). Here only one part of energy is lost, the water(as weight lost) and energy(as sweat loss), and the rest of the energy are not lost, instead, the energy is required to maintain our internal functions such as blood circulation, breathing, digestion, and the muscles activity. This energy is recovered in the same way, it is through external source, from the air (as oxygen), food (as glycogen in the blood and liver).<n>2) **Energy obtained from exercise**: In our activities, some energy is obtained from the surrounding environment. When we breathe, we move air in and out. The process in which gas(usually air) is moved in or out of lungs is known as respiration. Let me tell you what the process involves and its result:<n><n>Respiration is a combination of two processes or reactions. First, inhalation: When we breathe in, air moves into the lungs, which are large, balloon-like structures in our chest cavity. Air moves into the lungs through one or both nostrils, mouth or an opening in the throat.<n><n>Second, is exhalation: When we exhale, the air leaves the lungs

While this may refer to whether or not an individual can respond to an external action or event, it also refers to what an individual thinks about these events or things. For example, if an individual notices an earthquake, they may be not be aware of their existence (i.e. not respond) because they are in deep sleep; however, if someone who is awake is able to respond and notice the earthquake's existence, they have gained conscious of the event. While open eyes refers to the ability to physically see, awareness is more related to noticing. Hence, someone who is awake refers to someone who has gained "conscious."<n><n>#### 2<n>Answer: A<n><n>Input: Write a sentence with an independent clause and then a dependent clause.

Choices: A: tidepool B: beach sand C>: tidepools< D: current E:cooking pot<n><n>## Demonstration: I would first ask if you know of any of the characteristics of the ocean, I would say tides and currents.<n><n>Once that's settled, I would then say there is a small current with the name tide and large currents whose name is current.<n><n>Next I would say, since there is a tide, the tide is in and out and this is called the tide pools. What keeps the tide out and in that's called the current.<n><n>Next, when a tide pool is out you have the ocean water being left over from the high tide to form a large pool of water that is filled with all the animals found on the coast and in the ocean during high tide.<n><n>Now if you go to the ocean and look closely, when the tide is in your find many small shells, pebbles and sand. When the tide is out, only a small amount are left on the shore. I would say this is because more of the sand and pebbles are taken away as the tide is coming in.<n><n>Then there are the large creatures such as the crabs, starfish and other such animals found in the ocean that are found out at sea, when they come to the shore and are moving a part of them is in water, if that water was removed by a tide coming in, it would be hard for these creatures to move. Because of this they would find it hard to move on land. It is because of this I would refer to the tide pools as the reason the sea creatures are straining when they move.<n>#### C<n><n>#### A<n><n>### Input :If a bicycle is pushed at a constant 25 kilograms and speed 5 meters per second, how far will bicycle travel in 30 seconds?

The response can’t be "persuade," because the lady was giving her own play instead of persuading or convincing others to listen or see the show. The response can’t also be “sleep,” because that would imply that she was doing something wrong, and the question itself does not describe something wrong with what she did. The response can’ t be “challenge,” because the question doesn’ t describe she challenge anyone, she just started. The response couldn’t also be “take center stage,” because that would imply she was doing something wrong and she wouldn’t challenge everyone if she was doing something wrong. The only possible result is "speak clearly."<n><n>#### SpeakClearly<n><n>You're correct.

It may be caused by a decline in aggregate demand (a decrease in money demand). A decrease in the overall price that has occurred for an extended period is referred to as debasement.<n>Fundamental reasons for the deflation of prices include the following:<n><n>1. a decrease in the money supply<n>2. decreased demand and/or slower growth in overall demand<n><n>When the money supply is reduced, the overall price level falls, resulting in a state of deflation. Deflation might also happen if the overall demand for products decreases, causing a decrease in the economy's overall growth rate.<n>Demand-Pull Deflation<n>Aggregate demand is often defined as the total demand for products and services in the economy, as well as the aggregate value of the demand in the entire economy.<n>Aggregate demand can be divided into consumption, investment, government, and net exports. In an economy, the greater the overall demand for products and services, the higher the aggregate demand, which implies that prices are rising and the reverse is also true.<n>Demand Deflation:<n>When there is a decrease in overall demand in the economy, demand deflation occurs. This type of deflation is caused by a drop in the demand in businesses. When there is a decline in demand for goods and services, the economy's demand will fall, and consequently the economy's supply of products and services.<n><n>### Output 2:<n><n>### Demand:<n><n>### Supply:<n><n>A supply curve is a graphical representation that shows the amount of a product that suppliers are willing to offer for a given price, and over a particular period of time.

A supply curve's shape does not, in fact, reflect the quantity of goods that producers intend to sell. On the contrary, it shows how much they are prepared to provide.<n><n>A supply curve's horizontal shape indicates that the suppliers are willing to sell the same quantity of goods for any given price.

What number and percentage of people did not take an Aspirin during the four-week period? <n><n>### Rationales:<n>If you choose to choose option:D, it is incorrect.<n>To find the number of people that did *not* take an Aspirin, you need to find the number of people who did take one during the previous 4 weeks.

What is the logical deduction that makes the answer to this question true?<n><n>### Demystification:<n><n>Input: This is an image of the 16 regions on the Earth that are part of the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific Ocean is a gigantic ocean that holds one-third of the total water in the world. The Pacific Ocean Basin is a huge region that is approximately 113 million square miles or the size of the continental US, China, India, Russia, Brazil, South and Central America, etc. combined. The image below shows the 245 million square mile Pacific Ocean with its 16 parts. <n><n>![](images/16-parts-pacific.jpg){: width="70%" height="70%"}<n><n>Rationales:<n>To answer this question, you first need to understand what the Pacific Ocean is.<n><n>**1. Pacific Ocean**<n>The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the world's five oceans and covers almost a third of the Earth's surface. It is called the Pacific Ocean because Spanish explorers believed that they had sailed all the way from Cape Horn on the South American west coast to the Islands of the East Indies. They assumed that they had circumnavigated, or gone all the way around, the entire earth. The Spanish explorers were named "Pedro Alvares Cabrillo" and "Ferdinand Magellan" (the explores who first sailed west across the Pacific Ocean). The reason it is called the planet because it is the largest of the 5 oceans in the world and it is 3/4 (3/4) of the Earth`s surface. It is the only ocean that is larger than the entire continent of Africa.<n><br> <br> <br> **2. Atlantic Ocean**<n>The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest ocean and is also known as the Ocean of Dreams. It is the oldest of the worlds oceans and plays an important role in world trade. Europe also gets its name from the word 'atlantic' since they were a group of people that lived close to the seashores and sold their fish to travelers.<n><n><br> <hr> <br><n># 2021_10_9<n>### 답은 �

Choices:  A: books B: zoo C: body of water D: wooded area E: animals<n><n>### Response:		D, "body of water"<n><n>### Rationales:In response to question above, the correct answer is D, "body of water" because beavers in the wild build a dam to slow streams and bodies of water, they build dams in lakes and streams and also do other things like dig ponds and canals.<n><n>### Beaver Facts: Beavers are herbivorous, which means they are primarily vegetarian. They prefer the bark of broad-leaved trees, but they will eat almost anything. A healthy beaver can eat more than two-thirds of its own body weight each day and can have as much as 25% of its weight in storage.<n>Beavers have 40 sharp and flattened teeth, which can cut through as much as 30 cm or 1 foot thick lumber in less than 20 minutes.<n>The beaver tail is almost a perfect ovoid or egg shape for the efficient propulsion through the water.<n>Although beavers are considered to be rodents, their tails are not connected to their urinary system and are not a natural means of communication with other beavers.<n>#### Beaver Fact 1<n><n>#### Beaver Facts 3<n><n>### Input :The first year we went to the water park, we made $2,000. The second year we went to the park we made $3,000. Last year, we made almost $5,000 more. How much money did we make at the water park each year?<n><n>### Response : The answer to the question above is C, "Almost $5,00 more." Which I believe to be correct because each year the money made by the business increased.<n><n>#### Rationale :<n>I believe the answer to the above question is D. The answer to the question shows that the answer is almost $5,017 each year. This is the answer because the last year that was described is the year that the value increased by more than one thousand so the last year that was discussed was the most recent year and most amount of money. The year before that was shown in the example was the third year at the waterpark and the amount of money that was made was $4,900 more. The first year that the waterpark was mentioned on the question was the year before the

When it was my turn to take the item that my friend was holding. I took it and give it to him. But my friend was holding a similar item with another one which I took it, it was the second time while we are shopping now. It's now my turn to take what my friend has. My friend has a similar item that I was holding. When my friend took an item I was holding he got it mixed up with the item that was the same as the one I just took. He handed me the first item then the second item, the item I handed him first was the one I was holding. Can you help me figure out was the item I had on my hand was a similar item as the item he got for me?<n><n>### Response<n>I think it must be the first one.<n><n>### InputS:<n>My friend took another item and handed that new item to me. I looked at it and thought, wow I have never seen this item before. The reason that I think that it must be a new item is because he passed his previous similar item to the next person and the new item looks to be similar to the one that he handed to me. He handed me a similar item that I put on the table. He was having a problem with the same item that we were both looking for. He decided to try to find a different similar item that he thought he have never seen before. The item looked like the one I was looking for. My friend took the similar item I put on the table and gave me the other similar item on the table, which is similar to the item he handed me. The item that was on the table that I put the table was the one he was looking at, and the item he was holding when he handed me was the one I was looking at as well. It is confusing to figure out how the items looked different to me from where I put the table. I think there were two similar items and he handed me the other one and then the first item.<n><n>### ResponseA:<n><n>As you have mentioned that you have not seen the new item before. But there is a possibility that you have seen that before. As the new item looks like the one you put in the table that means the new item you have is the one you had before

The man claims to own a copy of Microsoft PowerPoint and he asks you if it's a program he would use at home. In response, you say the following to the man: "No sir, if you're looking for a home user version then you would have to find PowerPoint Home and Business. A home version of your program for regular consumers is called Office 365, but that is intended for office work, whereas Microsoft PowerPoint is for presentations. If you don't need Office 365 then you probably want PowerPoint instead." Afterwards you proceed to ask the man if he was indeed willing to find something like PowerPoint Home and Business since you know he's not looking for a home consumer version of Microsoft PowerPoint. In response, the man says he is in fact looking for PowerPoint Home and Business, which you then point out to the man. Do you agree that it is correct to say that the man was willing to find PowerPoint Home & Business and is now looking for that specific program?<n><n>### Response.<n>The man asked for the home version, which meant  he wanted PowerPoint Home & Business, so yes.<n><n>#### 96<n>### Input:You're baking a cake and you need to know how many eggs you need to make it.

So, the only place both Banjo and Ukulele exist is a place where there are at least 5300 Banjo players and atleast 3500 Ukulele players. There are 5450 Banjo players and 7650 Ukulele players in New York City, So the place the Banjo finds it's History is New York City!<n>#### 5450<n>Answer:<n>### Input: A person's height is 60% of their height squared. In other words, a person that is 1.8 meters tall is 60/10^2=4 *1.8 (Meters)=7.2 Meters tall. A person 1.6 meters tall is 66/4 * 1.6(Meters)=2.95 Meters<n>What is this person's height squared?<n><n>### Response There is a rule "A person's height is $60/\sqrt{2} (Meters)$<n>(Meters), so, A person 1.8 meters is $60/\mathrm{\sqrt{2}} (Meters)=2.84$ Meters tall.<n>If I have 2.84 squared, I will get $7.31 (Meters)^2$. So, the person's height in squared is $7.31$ Meters square.<n>Their height squared is $130.86$ Meters squared.<n><n>#### 130<n>Answer: 130.85<n><n>### Input A person is $300 (Yeard) $ light years from Earth.

Banks, a dentist, wanted to test the distribution of his patients' toothbrush use. After giving each patient a toothbrush, he instructed them to use their toothbrush five times a week for seven weeks. Then he asked them to tell him how many months they had purchased toothbrushes before getting the one from his practice. If a toothbrush typically costs $2 to purchase, how many months did Dr. Banks test the toothbrushes (the test period)?<n>Rationales: Dr. Banks bought his patients 53 tooth brushes in January and 67 in February, the total number of toothbrushes is 53 + 53 = 166 + 67 = <<166+67=233>>233 tooth brush.<n>The time of use is from January-May = January  + Febuary plus + March plus + April plus+ May. So the total time of use =<<January + February + March + April + May = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15>>15 weeks<n>and Dr Banks asks the patient about the period of use ( the test period). The patient tells Dr Banks the tooth brush they used had 20 months and 1 month remaining to use the toothbrush.<n>So the Dr Banks' test period = 5 weeks-(20 months-1month) = 2 months<n>So 233 toothbrush(s) were distributed to the patient for two months. He divided 233/2 =<<233/2=116>>116 toothbrush for each patient to use in two months.<n>#### 116<n>Answer: 116<n>

Choices:  A: driveway B: the event C: scrap heap D: parking garage E: repair shop<n><n>### Response:		D<n><n>### Rationales:In cities, parking spots are rarely found as there is usually only one or two parking spots per lot as compared to areas with smaller lots. To find parking in the city, people take advantage of the parking garage structure which allows cars to be parked further away than a normal lot, requiring less walk time. A, driveway, refers to the space right in front of the house where cars are parked until needed. The amount of time spent cleaning and polishing cars is much faster. B, event, in this case it means a party or social event that people take their car to. The amount of time taken to commute and park the car is a significant amount of time spent, therefore people chose to leave their car at home. C, scrap heap, refers to a landfill where cars are dumped after they break down. This is not efficient as other people have access to the parts. D, parking garage, park here, are generally known as places where the amount of time spent in commuting to and from their cars is reduced as there are several levels to the garage and one would have to drive up the floors to find parking space. In the case of an emergency, it is easier to travel from level to level in a garage than to drive in a traffic jam searching for parking space on the street. E, repair shop, refers to the shop where people go with their cars for issues that they are unable to fix themselves. Having a car in the city is more problematic as they are usually out of service for a much longer time and have to be dropped off and picked up. This is not so efficient when one has to commute themselves.<n>#### 5<n>Answer: D<n><n>## Task 115<n>When will the total weight of an average person and the total weight of an elephant be equal to the weight of the person riding an elephant?<n><n>Input: The weight of the person rides on an elephant.

Choices:  A: to be heard B: receive gifts C: understand themselves D: good things in life E: acknowledgment<n><n>### Response:		<n>I agree that "receive gifts" is the best answer.<n>Given choice E, though "acknowledgment", I was confused at first what it would be used for in counseling. After further research, I found that acknowledgment is simply being aware that someone is struggling and is aware of other's situations. This is more like understanding yourself, because it is not focusing on the self that is being helped.<n><n>### Input : In the counseling process, a counselor will help many people with these issues: 1.

I believe the reason "E" was considered correct is because "self esteem" was one of the choices, and I assumed that the first answer would not include "self esteme" because it is not a part of counseling.<n><n>###Instruction:<n>Sally is 5 cm shorter than Mary.

They called her Lucky the Cat because, as her owner said, she was born on Friday the thirteenth, under a lucky moon, next to a street that no longer had people. Everywhere that a person walked after the flood, the streets were filled with debris as heavy as stones; the street next to her house was filled with sand.<n><n>Having a cat was a wonderful idea, Erika thought. Every morning, it would be happy to see her and her parents. Every night, it would curl up in her lap and stay put while Erika read from Daisy and Doing Things, the cat's book. It was especially fun to stroke her kitty's fur, and it was even more fun when her little brother, Niko, pushed the kitty off her lap.<n><n>"You have Lucky the Cat," Erika's father would say to her little brother.<n><n>"I do not have a Lucky the Cat," Niko would exclaim.<n><n>"She's MY Lucky the Cat!"<n><n>"How do you know she ISN'T Lucky the Cat?"<n><n>"Erika won't let ME name her!"<n><n>"EriKA won't let YOU name her!"<n><n>Erika ignored Niko.

Until then, Erika and Lucky the kitty would stay inside the house; Erika had decided that the world outside was too dangerous. When the power had come back on, Erika and her parents had tried to open their door, but they quickly had to shut it. The door had blown off its hinges and hit Erika's head. The walls of their house, they realized, were weak. The stairs were unsteady. They did not think it was safe to walk outside anymore.<n><n>There was one day when Erika had opened the door, though.

Instead, you are given a choice that would be incorrect. Using that information, what is the correct choice?<n><n>### Demostration:<n><n>A: "front door" is wrong, because I would not steal the letters if someone was at the house. This option is also not true because the homeowner would have an open door for the mailman to see the box and the homeowner is there to pick up the mail.  B: "newspaper" is wrong because it is not part of the sentence at all, not a stolen item. C: "post office" is wrong because people do not deliver the mail to the post office. D: "package" is not correct because many packages do not get letters in them. E: "mailbox" is wrong because people who steal letters always take them right before the homeowner comes to pick up the mail, so they don't steal the packages.<n><n>#### Answer:<n>A<n><n>### Response<n><n>The sentence says "One might find theirs (singular) open with the letters that had (plural) been delivered stolen." So because A says that the homeowner finds the letters open in the front door, which is referring to one (as it only says "one" and not theirs) and they find the letters stolen, it is incorrect.<n><n>### Review:<n><n>**Questions 1-6: Use the drop-down menu to select the choices that correct use correct verb tense in the sentences below.**<n><n>**Questions:**<n><n>1.

First, how many gallons is 4 x 35? 48 / 35 = 1.3.  The 1.3 in the numerator times the answer in the denominator = 1.3 x 1.3 which equals 1.74.  What times a 48- gallon drum of juice costs is 1.74 x 48.  (Remember to not leave a zero here).  Therefore it would cost $2 a 47- gallon drum.<n><n>#### Answer:The D 65<n>Answer:''<n>

However, it is required that you include 5 sentences.<n><n>### Answer:<n><n>- I want to do something productive but I don’t know what to do.<n>- I want to get outside of my residence.<n>- I don’t think that there are many things to do inside my residence.<n>- There’s plenty of movies and tv shows I haven’t seen.<n>- I can sleep while watching tv.<n><n>### Discussion:Explain your process for finding the solutions. In your answer, consider the following: • What question(s) did you have to ask yourself to find the solution(s)? • Did you have to think carefully and/or have a lot of persistence? • Did it take some trial and error to arrive at the solution(s)?<n><n>Answer: When I don’t know how to start the problem, I usually use some simple strategies such as breaking the problem down or grouping similar sentences together so I can find simple connections between the different categories. This may not be the most elegant way but it’s a very simple and effective way.<n><n>My answers to the exercise are pretty straightforward. The only thing I find slightly challenging is question three where I have to write 5 sentences. I’m really bad at finding the right answers because I have to write 3 out of the 5 answers. I don’t know why question three bothers me so much but it’s because I can only really choose 2 out of the 5 options, which means I get to do so many more mistakes.<n><n>In my process I think I had to ask myself several questions like “what does sadness mean?“, “what do we usually do while binge eating?”<n><n>Some of the questions may seem silly and unnecessary but when answering questions like this it’s important to think outside the box. Sometimes I have to put myself in that character’s shoes because I’m only able to get the answer by understanding their situation and then try to connect how the word in question is connected to them.<n><n>Sometimes it might be necessary to do some trial and error. I tend to take this strategy when I know that I’ll get caught by mistake but I don’t wanna change the other 2 answers on my answersheet. Of course, it’s better to try and break it down and write the

He gave away 53 toothbrushes in January. He gave away 67 toothbrushes in February. In March he gave away 46 toothbrushes. In April and May, he gave away the remaining toothbrushes, half each month.  How many more toothbrushes did Dr. Banks give out in the busiest month versus the slowest month?<n>Rationales: Through March, Dr. Banks gave out 53 + 67 + 46 = <<53+67+46=166>>166 toothbrushes.<n>Before giving away toothbrushes in April, he had 330 -166 = <<330-166=164>>164 toothbrushes remaining.<n>Between April and May, he gave out the remaining 164 / 2 = <<164/2=82>>82 toothbrushes each month.<n>Dr. Banks gave 82 toothbrushes in his busiest month and 46 toothbrushes during the slowest month.<n>The difference would be 82- 46 = <<82-46=36>>36 more toothbrushes in the busiest month.<n>#### 36<n>Answer: 36<n><n>Input: Sally picks 30 seashells on Monday. On Tuesday, she picks half as many seashells as she did on Monday. If she can sell each seashell for $1.20, how much money can she make if she sells all of her seashells?<n>Rationales: On Tuesday, Sally picks 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 seashells<n>In total, Sally picks 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 seashells<n>The total amount of money Sally can make is 45 * $1.20 = $<<45*1.2=54>>54<n>#### 54<n>Answer: 54<n><n>### Input:Where does a shadow usually appear? Choices:  A: suface of moon B: building C: bridge D: ground E: bright light<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>### Instructions: In each of the following examples, you are to follow the given instructions to complete the task.<n><n>### Example 1:You're standing on a flat island. You walk from one edge of the island to the other, but find that you have not yet reached the middle of the island. Does the number of feet you've walked equal your half of the length of the island?<n>Answer: No, because the sum of the feet you've walked is NOT a whole number. Therefore, you haven't reached the point where you are directly halfway across the entire island. <n><n>Example 2: How many bags can you get for the money shown?<n>Answer: The picture represents five bags, so you can get five bags using the money shown.<n><n>Example 3: You start with $1,000 and make 250% profit. Your profit is now $3,000. How much did you start with in the first place? Answer: The given problem asks for 250% (increase by a factor of 1.25). So, 250% of $1,001 = $1,250. Therefore, you started with $1,050 in total.<n><n>#### 250<n>Answer: Increasing by a factor of 2.5<n><n>Example 4: Sally earns $8.50 on Monday and Tuesday combined. On Wednesday she earns 3 times as much money. On Thursday and Friday combined, she earns as much money as she earned on Monday and Tuesdays combined. How much money does she make on Thursday and Friday? ___<n>Answer: Thursday earns 3x more than Monday and Tuesdays. Let's say she earns $15.50 on Thursday. That means earns $15,500 on Thursday and $31,500 for Tuesday and Mondays combined. On Friday she earns $31,525, so she makes $47,025 for the whole week.<n><n>### Inputs: Each question below asks you to complete a set of instructions.

Which should I use on my bicycle.  Some days I am very fast, so I need a wide tire.  Other days, I bike around town.  My speed is slow, so I need a narrow tire.  My bicycle dealer recommended one of each.<n>Response: I prefer to use the square to put on my bicycle because it has less area than a radius of a circle, which is used by a bicycle tire.<n>The rationales are as followed:<n>An area is squared off. This is shown mathematically as the formula A=R^2, where R is the radius of the circle. In this case the raduis is used to represent a bike tire. The symbol squared off represents R.<n>A square is used to represent the area of a rectangle with four equal lengths. Here, I'm using it as a metaphor to represent the area used by a bicyle tire.<n><n>The area of the square and the radius represent an equation. The area will always be less than the raduis, however, the raduis can be considered greater because it is not squared off.<n><n>We can see how this works by comparing two different radiuses.<n>Radius of circle = 2<n>Radius of square = 2 / 4 = 5/ 2 (this means the radius of square is the radius of the radius of circle)<n>Area of square > 5^2 > 10^2<n>Because it is squared off, the amount that it is squared off is multiplied to give us a larger number.<n><n>####3/28<n>Answer: 3/28<n><n>### Rationale for Input: A circle has a smaller perimeter than a

Thus a fraction such as ½ is less than a fraction such as ¾, since to go from ½ to ¾ one must add 1 more than zero—hence, ½ < ¾.<n>### Instruction(s):<n>1.

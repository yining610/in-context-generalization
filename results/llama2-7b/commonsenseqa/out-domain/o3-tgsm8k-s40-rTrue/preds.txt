Let's say the number apples originally on the apple tree is 10. The first problem, we subtract 3 from 10, which then leaves us with 7. Next, let's look at the second problem. You take "3" to be X, leaving us with "4" apples. The following is the solution to the second problem. We look at what 4 is (the answer to the second problem), and subtract it from 7 (the answer to the first problem), which leaves us with the answer, (7 -4), which is 3.<n>Now, X = 4 and there are 7 apples.<n>This is very clever!

Choices:  A: idaho B: shopping mall C: big city D: in town E: new york<n>Output:		First of all, we will consider a possible scenario from each option.<n>Scenario A: In Idaho, the city has a population of 50, 000, and there are no other department stores available nearby.  This means there are no potential customers for the department store, because everyone works and there is no population left for them to sell to so this possibility would make S a large amount of profit and C a large amount of customers, but S is the best choice because this would make the largest amount of customers<n><n>Scenario B: A new shopping mall is built in Idaho.  The city grows in population, and the potential customers for the new store increase exponentially.  This makes C make the most profit because this scenario would give no customers a chance to go anywhere else.<n>Scenarios C through E: These cannot happen, so there is no need to waste anymore time thinking about them.<n>This means option C maximizes profits and option D maximizes customers.<n>So the final answers would be 5, because the scenario that maximizes profits is C and the scenario that maximizes customers is D.<n><n>Input:There's a trivia contest.

He gave away 53 toothbrushes in January. He gave away 67 toothbrushes in February. In March he gave away 46 toothbrushes. In April and May, he gave away the remaining toothbrushes, half each month.  How many more toothbrushes did Dr. Banks give out in the busiest month versus the slowest month?<n>Output: Through March, Dr. Banks gave out 53 + 67 + 46 = <<53+67+46=166>>166 toothbrushes.<n>Before giving away toothbrushes in April, he had 330 -166 = <<330-166=164>>164 toothbrushes remaining.<n>Between April and May, he gave out the remaining 164 / 2 = <<164/2=82>>82 toothbrushes each month.<n>Dr. Banks gave 82 toothbrushes in his busiest month and 46 toothbrushes during the slowest month.<n>The difference would be 82- 46 = <<82-46=36>>36 more toothbrushes in the busiest month.<n>So the final answer is 36<n><n>Input: Sally picks 30 seashells on Monday. On Tuesday, she picks half as many seashells as she did on Monday. If she can sell each seashell for $1.20, how much money can she make if she sells all of her seashells?<n>Output: On Tuesday, Sally picks 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 seashells<n>In total, Sally picks 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 seashells<n>The total amount of money Sally can make is 45 * $1.20 = $<<45*1.2=54>>54<n>So the final answer is 54<n><n>Input:David hurt all over. He was tired, he was shaking, and he was in pain.  He hadn't gotten what he needed in a long time.  He was suffering from what? Choices:  A: addiction B: fatigue C: relaxation D: headaches E: over eating<n>Output:		David was hungry<n>David had not gotten what he needed for a very long time which would mean he has been "over eating" for quite a while<n><n>Input: Four times the number of apples plus six is equal to eleven less than the number of apples.How many apples do I need to bake a pie for nine people?<n>Output: Four times the number apples is 4*n and six is 6 or let's say it equals to six<n>11 less than the number of pieces of apples would also be 6-11=<-11>.n or let's just say 11 <n>So that would be 11- <<n=8>>8 or 7 <n>So we have to multiply the pieces of apples by 8 or 8*n which is eight times the number of applie pie and we need 80 in order to bake a pie. <n><n>Input: Five more than one times the number of bananas equals to 40. The number of bananas is 13. How many more bananas do I have?<n>Output: Five more than one(1)+<1> is five more than one(1)<n>The number of bananas is n<13> and 14-<13> is 40<n>So the number of bananas left after one has eaten 13 is 40-13 or 20<n>Therefore, 1 is 13 and 20 is 23 and the result is 27<n><n>Input: The sum of an exponential function is one-more-than the exponential function multiplied by three. I want to know if the function that makes that sum is logarithmic, exponential, or neither of those.<n>Output: In order for the exponential function (y=3^x) to be the sum of an exponential function (y=2^x) plus one, we must have y+1=3^x or 2^x and have two equal powers of x. Since x is an exponent, we are unable to multiply x by any number, and we are unable to subtract one from x.<n>The function needs to be either log(x)-x=1 which is only a logarithmic function, or x^2-x=x^1/2 which is neither a logarithmic function or

This is the recurring decimal 0.333… or just 1/3.<n>So the final expression looks something like this: 1/(1/3)+(4/16…) = 3<n><n>Input:What do you mean “I can’t say the F-word any more than 5 times per hour?”<n>Output:Increase the number of times you can say the F-word to more than 5! In an hour, you can’t say the f-word any more than once per second.<n>If you can’t say it even once per second, then you can’t “say it more than 5 times”.  It makes no mathematical sense, so I guessed “more than 5 times per minute”.  That’s even more ridiculous, but that was what I got.<n>The correct answer, of course, is more than 5 times in an hour.<n>

Choices:  A: new york B: concert C: tv studio D: gig E: recording studio<n>Output:		Microphones are typically used to cover events in a studio setting.<n>When it comes to covering a stock market event, there are a few possible answers. In New York, for example, major financial events take place in a large auditorium in lower Manhattan. In this case, a stage would be built in the room and the microphones would be boomed out on the stage. At smaller events, where there is not enough space to have a stage, the microphones may instead be brought in by truck and placed directly in front of the speaker. In either of these situations, the microphones would likely be covered by a fabric or foam pad to prevent them from being damaged.<n><n>Input:The average rainfall for the United States is just over five inches per month.

International airports 2. Hotels; I suspect that there are fewer of the old fashioned telephone booths in airports and hotels though, because people are more likely to use the WiFi they get with the hotel or airport to call on the Internet than to use a telephone.<n>Therefore, my guess is that the next most likely answer is B, that is, gotham city in NYC.<n>I haven't been to gas stations lately. But, I don't think gas stations are going to be very red; that would have been more likely 200 years ago.<n>If I were to guess for London, which many think of as a very red place, I'd guess that the red telephone booths have been replaced by WiFi...<n>So the final answer would be A: airport<n><n>Input:What is the missing number?

We call the space "four-dimensional" because we can distinguish any shape by describing where it is in space. We imagine using Cartesian coordinates, which assign numbers according to their horizontal, vertical, and three diagonal directions. For example, (1, 3, 4) describe a point that is 1 unit horizontally, 3 units vertically, and 4 units diagonal left. A different coordinate system could use a clock face-like arrangement with angles for each.<n>Imagine a cube with opposite sides measuring 12 units (in the horizontal direction) and 12 units (vertical). (It doesn't matter which coordinates you use, but, for simplicity, we refer to horizontal and vertical dimensions, which correspond to "width" and "height" in a drawing.) We'll use a set of co-ordinates.  These coordinates map cubes that can be thought of as three-dimensional boxes.<n>The 27 squares are shaded. They're all on this plane, but we have another 35 unshaded cubes in the 4th dimension as well.  The 27 shaded squares also fill 12 spaces in one dimension. The 35 unshading squares fill 12 dimensions as well.  The final number of dimensions is 2^3=8.<n>The 25 squares below are in 4D. The first figure is the cube (2^2=2^4=4, 12,12) that we can see, and it's contained in the final cube (2,2,2,4).  This is a square space-cube, 24 cubes of 2 by 2 dimensions.<n>A second space-cube has all the squares, except the right bottom square. Another cube has the right corner squares, the ones not in a square. Notice, that is 3D  but there are six squares left, the ones in <n>the corner.<n>Notice, there are still six squares, the 3 left ones.<n><n>Input: A box is placed in a rectangular room. If a person walks in from the corner of the box, the person walks 0.75m. Then walks 0.

Choices:  A: place of work B: office C: friend's house D: workplace E: deep thought<n>Output:		In general, a human wants to enjoy the company of another human at a place of work. Choices A and C might be relevant, but the primary locations of human interaction are homes and offices. Few people enjoy having a deep thought in a crowd of other humans and would not choose friends' homes or the human's workplace for deep thought.<n><n>In any situation, it is essential to think of different things a human might desire, and a good way to think of this is through the lens of the human's perspective. A common human's perspective is that he or she has more time and energy to dedicate to one activity of his or her choosing. The human can make a list of all of the ways he or she can be entertained, such as having a conversation or having a deep thought.<n><n>While each of these ways may interest humans, the human wants to go where the other human is. It may be uninteresting if the other human is in an uncomfortable place. If the other human is far away, it may be expensive or difficult to visit. If the other human does not enjoy speaking to the human or thinks that the human is not worth the trouble of a conversation, the human does not want to go to where the other human is, but should instead go to another location<n><n>This is also true of things that are not related to humans' enjoyment of other humans but instead humans' interactions with the world around them. The human can go to a place of work, a home, a deep thought, an office, or a friend's house. The human wants to go where things are being done. In general, the more important the task, the more significant the location. It may be unimportant to spend time with someone else, but it is important to spend time on tasks.<n><n>So the final solution to this is B<n>

The technique is as follows:  first solve the expression for x, and then solve one half of the expression for x by subtracting one half of the expression from both sides of the original equation.  Now all that is left is to square the answer and solve for x.  For instance, to solve the expression for square root of one hundred, you would write it as (50)^(1/2) and then subtract 1/2 from the numerator and denominator and that would leave you with (25)^(1/2), which is actually three quarters.  If you then square the result, you get (3)^4, which is 3^1 + 3^2 +3^3 + 3^4 and that equals one.  So the square root of one is 3. <n>Output: You were once asked  to find the square root  of one hundred.<n>                  In class, you  learned the technique from how to factor out  <n>                 the square root in an  expression to find it.<n><n>The technique is as follows:<n>                  first solve the expression  for x, and then  solve one half  <n>                 of the expression for x  by subtracting one  half of the  original  <n>                 equation from both sides of  the original equation =<<50^1/2=25>>25<n>                 Now all that is left  is to square  the above expression, which =<<625^2=15625>>15625<n>             The square root of one hundred =<<15625^1/2=3>>3<n>So the first answer is true, and the second answer is false.

In 2018, the average college graduated  got their finances in order and cut their credit card debt in half. For every 500 students that graduated in 2018 and cut their credit card  debts in half, 1,000 people applied for and received student loans. What is the average loan amount for an applicant this year?<n>Output: There cannot be one or more than one unknowns.<n>First off, there are unspecified and unknown variables.<n>To apply the data given, the best way to do this is using a tree diagram.<n>To begin, if there are 500 students who cut their credit card debts in half, then the average credit debt per person is $35,0k / 2 =<<35000/2>>17,500<n>For every 500 people, there is a percentage of about 3x2, which would be 6x2 = <<6x2=12>>12 people for each year.<n>For the next part, if 1,00 people apply for and receive loans, then this means the average loan amount is: 1,00 * $(35000*500/2) =<<100* 1750

You can plant as many seeds as you want. In one year, 1 out of 7 plants bear no fruit. In another, 3 out of 4 plants bear no fruit. What percentage of plants bear no fruit the first year?<n>Output: In the first year,<n>A single seed will  yield a plant that has fruits one out of these 7 times.  So the rate of bearing fruit in a year  will be seven divided by 1=<< 7/1=7>>7<n>In the second year, if we had 4 plants that grew without fruits, 3 out of these 4 plants will yield no fruit and the rest of the 4th plant will bear fruit.  So at the end of the second year, we get 3 out of 7 which is 0.42<n>In this way, we can calculate the percentage of plants that bear no fruit in the first year and second year.  The percentage of plants that bear fruit (1-0.42) = 0.58.<n>Therefore, the percentage of plants that bore fruits in the first year = 0.57<n>So the final answer here is 0.57

Every week, they play a game of volleyball. The first month, they spent 1/4 of the time practicing the game with a different set of 3 students playing each position. The remaining practice was spent in one-on-one matches. In the second month, the girls spent 1/2 the time practicing with one group and 1/4 practicing one on one and in the third month, they changed their practice schedule to spending 2/5 of the time practicing teams and the remainder practicing one on one. Practice will continue to alternate each month.  How much time will they spend practicing teams in a year?<n>Output: One year has a total number of 12 months, so the answer should be divided into 12 months.<n>In one month, 2/5 is equal to 36/5=<<36/5=7.2>>7.2 percent.<n>This means that we can assign 36/5 per 36/5 = <<36/5=9.2>>9.2 percent per match.<n>Over a year, we multiply 9.2 by 12.<n>The calculation results in 110.4 percent of time practicing as a team<n>So the final answer here is 110.5%<n>

Choices:  A: kitchen B: pantry C: containing pots and pans D: in a flight E: mexico<n>Output:		The cabinets are in the kitchen, thus the answer is A.<n>The only things that can't be in the kitchen are mexico and pots and pans. Therefore, the choices that we can eliminate are mexico and pantry. This is because pantry means in the cupboard. However, the cabinet is more than a cupboard, as we can tell from the fact that they were imported and contain pots and pans, which means that they cannot be in the kitchen pantry because pantry means cupboard- which is smaller. From above we see that cabinet can only mean a small cupboard, which means that the correct answer is A in this question.<n><n>Input:"I can speak four languages"-<<"I can speak four languages".length()>>.length()-<<"I can".length()+<<"speak".length()+<<4+1+1+14+0>>.length()<"four".length()+<<3>>3+<<"languages".length()-<<".".length()>>.<n>Output:true<n>Let's do some math.<n>length of I can = 6 characters<n>i.e. "I".length() = <<"I".length()>> 6<n>The length of "I can speak four languages." is 19, because it includes the double quote and a space in the middle<n>I can speak four languages = <<"I can speak four languiages".length()>>15 spaces<n>Now lets minus the numbers of "I can" (19-6) and "four languages" (15-7) and check the result<n>9-3 = <<9-3>>6<n>6-10 = <<6-10>><><>-<<6-10>>6<n>1-6 = <<1-6>>7<n><n>This reduces to 7-3 = 4<n><n>This shows the correct answer to be true<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the followin...

Choices: A: $$0.03$$0.03 B: $$3$$3 C: $$27$$27 D: $$12.7$$12.7 E: $$9$$9<n>Output:Basketballs have been worth $3 each for years. Due to inflation, the amount of money for which a basketball is worth is gradually increasing. As of current, the price for one basketball is $$3$$3. There exists a small store in Iowa that sells basketballs for $3. The store was named "Shopping Galore", until one customer named Mr. Creamsicle told the clerk that the phrase "Shopping Gal" is similar to the phrase "Tubular Lube". The store was renamed and is currently known as "Shopping Dude", since the owner changed the first letter of the previous name. It should be noted that the name change had nothing to do with the prices in the store. Shopping Dude has its prices posted on the store's sign, which can be seen in the picture below. Therefore, shopping dude sells basketballs at the price of $3, since the sign at shopping dude's cloning site (as seen in the picture at the top of this document) indicates that a single basketball costs $3.<n><n>Input:The cost of a single apple juice at a small town grocery store is $1.25, but it is $1.50 at the new supermarket that just opened in town.

Today, the average car can travel for 30 miles on one gallon. If in three years, the car can travel for 40 miles on one gallong of gas, how many more miles will the car be able to travel on one gallon of today's average gasoline?<n>Output:The average gas mileage of a car can be simplified as 30 x (1/50) miles per gallon.<n>Let's say X is today's average gas mileage. From the problem, we know that the average car can only travel for about 40 * x miles on one gallon instead of 30 miles.  That means that the difference between today's average gas milage and average gas milage in three years will be 40. 40.40.40 or 40 / 40 / 3 = <<40/40/3=0>>0.  In other words, the difference is 0 miles in average gas mileage.<n>So the final answe is 0

He gave away 53 toothbrushes in January. He gave away 67 toothbrushes in February. In March he gave away 46 toothbrushes. In April and May, he gave away the remaining toothbrushes, half each month.  How many more toothbrushes did Dr. Banks give out in the busiest month versus the slowest month?<n>Output: Through March, Dr. Banks gave out 53 + 67 + 46 = <<53+67+46=166>>166 toothbrushes.<n>Before giving away toothbrushes in April, he had 330 -166 = <<330-166=164>>164 toothbrushes remaining.<n>Between April and May, he gave out the remaining 164 / 2 = <<164/2=82>>82 toothbrushes each month.<n>Dr. Banks gave 82 toothbrushes in his busiest month and 46 toothbrushes during the slowest month.<n>The difference would be 82- 46 = <<82-46=36>>36 more toothbrushes in the busiest month.<n>So the final answer is 36<n><n>Input: Sally picks 30 seashells on Monday. On Tuesday, she picks half as many seashells as she did on Monday. If she can sell each seashell for $1.20, how much money can she make if she sells all of her seashells?<n>Output: On Tuesday, Sally picks 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 seashells<n>In total, Sally picks 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 seashells<n>The total amount of money Sally can make is 45 * $1.20 = $<<45*1.2=54>>54<n>So the final answer is 54<n><n>Input:Mary was a bad girl, but she was always open about that.  People liked her because she was what? Choices:  A: excellent B: fun C: honest D: worthy E: choice<n>Output:		Worthy - The final answer is B<n><n>Input: What is the average of the following three numbers: 2, –1, –4<n>Output:  The values of the question are 2,-1,-4, The median and mode are both -1. The mode of this is the smallest value, so the average is -1. The median which is the middle number is the 2, (the average of 2, -1, -4 is -2). The final answer is C<n><n>Input:  A and B are 32 and 14 years old, respectively. How old is A if B - A = 116?<n>Output: We should begin by knowing the values of A and B. To solve this problem, we need to understand the values of A and how they relate to B. The final answer is<n><n>Input:  The average of three numbers is 16. If the second number is doubled, the total is 20. What is the third number?<n>Output: The second number is -2. We can substitute -2 into the number of values as -2,-2,-2 to find the first number (57/2=28.5) and the third (109/2=54.5). The first and last numbers are 28 and 54. The total is 16+28+54=2+57+109=122. There are therefore 22 integers that are greater than the last and 5 less than the first. We cannot divide between these numbers and it is therefore impossible to find the original numbers. The final answer is D.<n><n>Input: There are 13 giraffes in a class. 6 of these giraffes are girls and 7 are boys. What is the probability for a girl?<n>Output: Firstly, we must count the number of giraffes in the class. This is 13. We also need to count the numbers of giraffes which are girls as well as the boys. There are 6 girls and we count 7 boys. It is therefore 13 giraffe in the class, 7 boys, and 6 girls. We therefore can use the following equation to help solve the question:<n><n>Gender Probability Gender Probability G<n>A B<n><n>A

You and seven other hikers each bring 21 pounds of food. You and nine other hikers each take 29.5 pounds of food. You alone take 28 pounds of food.  When you divide the total cost by 10, your share ends up being 5% of all the food brought by all hikers. How much does each hiker pay for your portion of the food cost?<n>Output:Three people: A and B each take 28/10 = <<28/10=2.8>>2.8 pounds of food, so they each pay $3.12 to feed themselves.<n>Each person B pays C $10.50 to feed A. Because C paid $3.12 for two people's share, the portion of the meal for 28 pounds of A's food is $14.88. C also pays A $10.5 to feed himself. C pays a total of $25.38 to feed both.<n>It costs each person A $7.10 to feed himself when B is only paying $3.12 because $3.12 is split between three people: A,B,C.<n>C and B each pay $7.1 to feed A.<n>It costs each other person 31 cents to feed himself when A is only paying 71 cents to feed others. So C,D,F all pay 71 cents.<n>I'm not sure what it means to split the cost with 9 and 10, so I'll just say A has a $0 share because he took 21 of the 29.5 pound pack.

One rule is that during the game, you are not allowed to touch any of the players on another team. Another rule is that you need three players on the right side of the team, and three players on the left side of the team. If the players on your team are not evenly distributed between the right and left sides, the game will not count. If you are playing by yourself, you need to make sure you have evenly distributed players across all sides of the pitch, and on every side, you need to have at least two players with at least two more people. Which rule would you rather not play by, because it is more boring, and you do not have a friend to pass the ball to? Choices:  If everyone has to touch the ball the same way to score, then it is the most fun because you can use tricks to make people think they have won.  If everyone has to stay on one team and cannot trade during the game because it would be boring if the players did not have any trick moves to do.  Both because having all the players touch the ball is not good and having only one person on both sides would slow down the game. I would pick both because it would slow down the game if you have all three players on one side. The best is if you have as many players on both sides as possible.  Too bad, because the best game is a combination of 1 and 2. The best is when you make a team of three friends and they trade the ball back and forth. If you can keep all players on the same team during a game, you can still exchange with your friends.  Because the best game is three against two, with all the players on both sides. You cannot get trick moves in this game, so it is not fun.   You

We split the letters into two subarrays. The first subarray corresponds to the first string "the", and the second subarray contains the characters "o", "l", "m". For the next step, we need to make a string by combining the two subarrays. "helm" is the result of combining "the" and "o, l, m" in order. After this step, we need to create a new subarray from the next letter "b", and use the subarray to find the number of words that start with the letter "b". If the letter "l" existed in the given string, the subarray's length would be five. After removing the letters "o" and "m" from the result, we should get the following result. "helmlo" is the result of removing "o" and "l".<n>To add one array to another, use another array's length. Let's say X and Y are two arrays with lengths X and Y, respectively. The subarray of X starting from index 3 (i.e the 4th element of X) has length 6. The string "the" has length 4. So the difference of 3(6)-3(4)=2<n>To sum an array, just sum the elements of the array. The result should be 54, and the type should be integer.<n><n>### Additional Instructions:If the number of Schnaux are only a variable, what would change?<n>I would need to create a variable so that the first input can be read and the second input can be calculated.<n><n>### Question 3 from section C<n>### Instruction:Input: The word "alphabet" contains 26 letters.

Choices:  A: hardware store B: basement C: garage D: repair shop E: the library.<n>Output:		Where are two ways to approach this problem. One way is to recognize that the tool was in the other room, and if it was in the other room there must be a door that leads from that room to this room. You also know there are stairs in the other room. Therefore, one of the other doors must have stairs in it, leading to any of the following rooms: a hardware store, a basement, a garage, or a repair shop. The last one in the list is the library.<n>Another way to think of it is that you have four choices, and to determine where the person went you just have to eliminate three of them. It is not the choice that is in the library, and therefore that still leaves four choices: a hardware store, basement, garage, and repair shop. This time, to eliminate one of the other choices, try to remember that there's only one stair in this building. You also know that the person could not have walked upstairs to find the tool. Therefore one of those four choices doesn't include the stairs, leaving you with a choice that includes them. The last choice in the list is the basement, so you would go to the library where you would find the tool.<n><n>So the final answer will be in the library<n><n><n>

It had three different conditions that could be changed. The most complicated part would be that there was more than one answer. But the students were still able to go through the steps of solving the problem<n>- On question 2, I am happy with how the students were able to manipulate the variables of the equation.<n>- Question three, I wasn't sure if students would even ask me how much money she could make. I was interested to see how well they thought through the problem. It seems to me that the final answer was 21, however the students were only able to think of 24. Students were mostly able to identify what a variable is (answer A). The question on this part is on whether or not they made connections between what a variable was in the context of our story and mathematical equations.<n>- For question four, although the response was correct, I was somewhat concerned about the students thinking about a filing cabinet as an office furniture store paper file. (answer D). I expect them to be able to use their mathematical thinking to identify variables in a problem and understand the question, but this question required thinking about a broader context.<n><n>Student answers and comments:<n>- 1: 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 (This answer was the most logical, but I am not sure if they considered a variable)<n>- 2: 355 (This answer was good)<n>- 3: 21 (Answer is correct)<n>- 4: A

What is the square root of 127?<n>Output:The square root of 80 is the square root of eighty, which is 2550 >> 4*2550 >> <<75>>75 (the four)<n>One of the two squares of twenty-five is 75. One of the two squares of 53 is 26, so 96 equals 4*(2550) + (26).<n>Since 127 is greater than 96, four times 2550 is greater than one half of 127: three times 323, or 973.<n>The square root of 131,3150 is three times 255, the answer minus one half of the starting number: 131,2950.<n>Since 131,1950 is larger than the starting number 127 by nine, we know that the answer is three times the square root of 65.<n>Since 125 is less than 127 by two, that means that the number we are looking for is 3*sqrt(65) = 3x1.8247 = 5.4742. We need to round either up or down because if you add 5.47 onto 127 you are going to get a large number.<n>We find the halfway point between 5 and 6 and since we need to round up, we round up to 7, so the final answer is 7<n><n>Input: Three pumpkins were divided evenly between three friends.

It is, therefore, not on the shelf, and it is not at his office supply shop, or at his place of work. Instead, the clipboard is on a desk, at his school.<n>Note: The solution was 4 - I couldn't think of another choice until after I made my code<n>I just don't really understand how this solution is the correct answer.<n><n>Input: A large river flows into a relatively small lake. The lake has an island in the center. Which is the best way to cross the river, getting from the first side of the river to the other side? You could ride on a raft, but you would need 2 rafts - one to carry you and one to carry your luggage. Rafts are large, and have to be paddled to stay afloat. You could walk onto the island, but you would have to swim to reach the other side of the lake. You could walk across on land. How?<n>Output: You could waddle across on a log<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Explain your code.<n><n>I made a simple program that checks if the user's guess matches<n>the input and then adds up all of the guesses. It would run,<n>but it didn't print to the console. So I added print statements<n>to the two if and if elif functions. I also made a function<n>to take the input from the user that contained the<n>user_input. But what if the user didn't respond after 8<n>seconds? I made a for loop that asks the user to answer<n>in a random position of the 9 columns. It should wait for a<n>response before it continues. The for loop does an awesome job<n>at making the program wait. This way the program doesn't<n>continue until the user responds. With a random number, <n>the program will continue even though there is no response,<n>like at second 4 or 5. To avoid this, I added an else statement,<n>that makes the program wait until the user inputs something.<n><n>### How does your program compare to the original solution?<n>The code I made is a much better representation of the original<n>solution, than the first one I started

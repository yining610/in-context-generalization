When two whole numbers are added, and the number is a whole number, it is called addition of whole numbers. This page explains how to add two whole numbers. When whole numbers are written in different sizes, this is called adding fractions. If you add fractions together, it's called adding fractions.\nAdding integers is the same as adding whole numbers. You can always represent adding whole numbers as addition of integers. For example:\nThe sum of 3 and 5 is 8\nThe sum of 6 and -1 is 5\n\n<2>The operation known as multiplication.\nMultiplication is a calculation in which two numbers are multiplied together. The result is called the product or the answer. Multiplication is denoted by the asterisk (*) symbol. Multiplication is related to division. Division is the inverse operation of multiplication. The inverse operation of subtraction is addition and the inverse operation of addition is subtraction.\nMultiplication can be interpreted as repeated addition.\nMultiplication may be easier to understand and execute by working with whole numbers, especially when numbers are within the range of 10\u221230. In this range, when a number is multiplied by another, the product appears in its expanded number-line form.\nAddition is the inverse operation of subtractions.

Also, the second part of the sentence states that they are no longer together.\nI think they may be twins, siblings, or long-time friends. \nTherefore, I would call them as \"lovers\", \"husband and wife\", or \"friends\".\nThe phrase means that they were in a romantic relationship until it was broken down and they moved away from each other, either because they decided to separate or because something else ruined their relationship.\n\n####Question 2\n\nWhen I woke up in the morning,\" He had two options: take the stairs or take the elevator.\"\n\nStairs are walking up all the stairs.\nElevator is walking in the elevator.\n\n\n\n\n\n# 6/ 24 Question 1\n\n# what will happen if we run \"while 1 + 2\" (one plus two)?\n\nThis code would probably loop an infinite number of times. The variable 'i' gets incremented by 2 (by being plus two) and the loop condition that i = 1 ends when i = 3, causing the condition to be false. Then the program will keep looping through that line. Since +2 adds 2 to a variable, it will still be incrementing but  the program will never run while 1 +2, making it infinite.\n\n\n\n# Question 2\nExplain what would happen if we type code, \"A: Print \"I am a computer scientist\"; B: Print \"I am in an infinite loop\"; C: Print \"I am learning to programing in Python\"; D: Print \"I am so smart\", without a statement.\n\nThe computer stops processing because there is not 1 statement following the last statement after the while loop.

{"text": "The man should put the luggage in the trunk of the car\nFour-dimensional geometry\nWe study shapes that are cubes embedded in space. We call the space \"four-dimensional\" because we can distinguish any shape by describing where it is in space. We imagine using Cartesian coordinates, which assign numbers according to their horizontal, vertical, and three diagonal directions. For example, (1, 3, 4) describe a point that is 1 unit horizontally, 3 units vertically, and 4 units diagonal left. A different coordinate system could use a clock face-like arrangement with angles for each.\nImagine a cube with opposite sides measuring 12 units (in the horizontal direction) and 12 units (vertical). (It doesn't matter which coordinates you use, but, for simplicity, we refer to horizontal and vertical dimensions, which correspond to \"width\" and \"height\" in a drawing.) We'll use a set of co-ordinates.  These coordinates map cubes that can be thought of as three-dimensional boxes.\nThe 27 squares are shaded. They're all on this plane, but we have another 35 unshaded cubes in the 4th dimension as well.  The 27 shaded squares also fill 12 spaces in one dimension. The 35 unshading squares fill 12 dimensions as well.  The final number of dimensions is 2^3=8.\nThe 25 squares below are in 4D. The first figure is the cube (2^2=2^4=4, 12,12) that we can see, and it's contained in the final cube (2,2,2,4).

{"text": "In general, a human wants to enjoy the company of another human at a place of work. Choices A and C might be relevant, but the primary locations of human interaction are homes and offices. Few people enjoy having a deep thought in a crowd of other humans and would not choose friends' homes or the human's workplace for deep thought.\n\nIn any situation, it is essential to think of different things a human might desire, and a good way to think of this is through the lens of the human's perspective. A common human's perspective is that he or she has more time and energy to dedicate to one activity of his or her choosing. The human can make a list of all of the ways he or she can be entertained, such as having a conversation or having a deep thought.\n\nWhile each of these ways may interest humans, the human wants to go where the other human is. It may be uninteresting if the other human is in an uncomfortable place. If the other human is far away, it may be expensive or difficult to visit. If the other human does not enjoy speaking to the human or thinks that the human is not worth the trouble of a conversation, the human does not want to go to where the other human is, but should instead go to another location\n\nThis is also true of things that are not related to humans' enjoyment of other humans but instead humans' interactions with the world around them.

Choices: 1: The ones 2: The tens 3: The hundreds 4: The thousands 5: I don't know which digit, but they are not 5 and 0\nOutput: The digits that are not 5 and zero are 4 and 1.

The technique is as follows:  first solve the expression for x, and then solve one half of the expression for x by subtracting one half of the expression from both sides of the original equation.  Now all that is left is to square the answer and solve for x.  For instance, to solve the expression for square root of one hundred, you would write it as (50)^(1/2) and then subtract 1/2 from the numerator and denominator and that would leave you with (25)^(1/2), which is actually three quarters.  If you then square the result, you get (3)^4, which is 3^1 + 3^2 +3^3 + 3^4 and that equals one.  So the square root of one is 3. \nOutput: You were once asked  to find the square root  of one hundred.\n                  In class, you  learned the technique from how to factor out  \n                 the square root in an  expression to find it.\n\nThe technique is as follows:\n                  first solve the expression  for x, and then  solve one half  \n                 of the expression for x  by subtracting one  half of the  original  \n                 equation from both sides of  the original equation =<<50^1/2=25>>25\n                 Now all that is left  is to square  the above expression, which =<<625^2=15625>>15625\n             The square root of one hundred =<<15625^1/2=3>>3\nSo the first answer is true, and the second answer is false.

They also live in the sclerophyllous forests, seasonal rain forests, humid tropical forests, subalpine forests, deciduous trees, montane forests, and woodland savannah.\n\nDeciduous forest is located in temperate climates. Deciduous forest is a major biome located around the planet's northern and southern hemispheres, where seasonal variations in sunlight result in decreased growth during the winter and dormant periods, followed by rapid growth during spring, typically associated with ample precipitation.\nDeciduous forest can tolerate cold weather because temperature fluctuations during winter would not kill them (a species adapted to wide range of temperature is more likely to last long than a species who is not adaptable to wide range of temperature).\n\nMadagascar climate belongs to the tropical savanna climate with warm temperatures every day (> 20 \u00b0C) and with a low to moderate rainfall distribution over the year (average annual rainfall 1 \u2013 1000 mm).\n\nSolemn_Landscape: The main cause of climate change in Madagascar is clearing of forests for farming and over cultivation.

The train will get there in 3 * 24 = <<3*24=72>>72.\nIf the train travels at 72 miles per hour, it takes 60 * 72 = <<60*72=432>>432 minutes to travel 556 miles.\nThe only solution is that the train had to travel 432 *183=<<432*183=81,580>>81580 miles = 81,550 miles.", "answer": "A: movies"}

Every box of the 15, has 3 oranges (or apples, or pears, or whatever) in it. And the boxes are labeled from A to P. Each apple, orange, pear, or whatever (for the sake of ease) is equally the size of all the other apples, oranges, pears, etc. There may be duplicate labels.\n\nYou have to label all the fruit you are about to eat as A1, A2, A3 or some other letter (with A being the least desirable). And you have to do it in the order the boxes are on your table. For example, if you have 3 apples, box A would be the one you open last.\n\nYour job is to take the number that comes next to the numbered label you are currently about to put on your fruit (such as 2A 1B), and subtract both numbers from each other.\n\nFor example, if you have labeled 5 oranges (5A), and your job is to put a label on 1 orange (that is, you are in the position to put 2A) then the next number to use would be 2B (B-2B).\n\nAlso, at each step, you may choose to label a box, as \"P\" or \"X\" (without the letters A, B, C,...

You can plant as many seeds as you want. In one year, 1 out of 7 plants bear no fruit. In another, 3 out of 4 plants bear no fruit. What percentage of plants bear no fruit the first year?\nOutput: In the first year,\nA single seed will  yield a plant that has fruits one out of these 7 times.  So the rate of bearing fruit in a year  will be seven divided by 1=<< 7/1=7>>7\nIn the second year, if we had 4 plants that grew without fruits, 3 out of these 4 plants will yield no fruit and the rest of the 4th plant will bear fruit.  So at the end of the second year, we get 3 out of 7 which is 0.42\nIn this way, we can calculate the percentage of plants that bear no fruit in the first year and second year.  The percentage of plants that bear fruit (1-0.42) = 0.58.\nTherefore, the percentage of plants that bore fruits in the first year = 0.57\nSo the final answer here is 0.57", "answer": "E: motel"}

Practice will continue to alternate each month.  How much time will they spend practicing teams in a year?\nOutput: One year has a total number of 12 months, so the answer should be divided into 12 months.\nIn one month, 2/5 is equal to 36/5=<<36/5=7.2>>7.2 percent.\nThis means that we can assign 36/5 per 36/5 = <<36/5=9.2>>9.2 percent per match.\nOver a year, we multiply 9.2 by 12.\nThe calculation results in 110.4 percent of time practicing as a team\nSo the final answer here is 110.5%", "answer": "C: garden"}

Another way to remove the number 7 is to double the remainder and add \u20181\u2019. How many ways are there to remove the number '7'?\nOutput: One way to remove 7 is to reduce the value by 1, but that doesn't work because we can't just leave the number 7 alone and work with its remainder.\nAnother way is to double the remainder, but not all numbers have a remainder. That also doesn't work for numbers that have a remainder.\nThere is a way to do it: by adding 1, you end up with the next highest value. So when you add 7 to 1 to get 8, 8 is the next highest value.\nIf you look through possible values of 7, it's the only one that you would end up with the next-highest-value when adding 1.\nThere are only 3 possible values: 1, 2, and 4.\n\nInput: What's the last piece in the picture?\nOutput: There are two pieces: the purple square and the green square.\n\nInput: There was a group of", "answer": "C: being found out"}

One rule is that during the game, you are not allowed to touch any of the players on another team. Another rule is that you need three players on the right side of the team, and three players on the left side of the team. If the players on your team are not evenly distributed between the right and left sides, the game will not count. If you are playing by yourself, you need to make sure you have evenly distributed players across all sides of the pitch, and on every side, you need to have at least two players with at least two more people. Which rule would you rather not play by, because it is more boring, and you do not have a friend to pass the ball to? Choices:  If everyone has to touch the ball the same way to score, then it is the most fun because you can use tricks to make people think they have won.  If everyone has to stay on one team and cannot trade during the game because it would be boring if the players did not have any trick moves to do.  Both because having all the players touch the ball is not good and having only one person on both sides would slow down the game. I would pick both because it would slow down the game if you have all three players on one side. The best is if you have as many players on both sides as possible.  Too bad, because the best game is a combination of 1 and 2. The best is when you make a team of three friends and they trade the ball back and forth. If you can keep all players on the same team during a game, you can still exchange with your friends.  Because the best game is three against two, with all the players on both sides.

{"text": "A is veldt. B is ocean.C is savannah. D is Africa. E is jungle\nTo find the number of words beginning with a specific letter with the same length and without overlaps, use the letters' positions to form a subarray.\nHere's an example of how we might find the number of words starting with \"b\". We split the letters into two subarrays. The first subarray corresponds to the first string \"the\", and the second subarray contains the characters \"o\", \"l\", \"m\". For the next step, we need to make a string by combining the two subarrays. \"helm\" is the result of combining \"the\" and \"o, l, m\" in order. After this step, we need to create a new subarray from the next letter \"b\", and use the subarray to find the number of words that start with the letter \"b\". If the letter \"l\" existed in the given string, the subarray's length would be five. After removing the letters \"o\" and \"m\" from the result, we should get the following result. \"helmlo\" is the result of removing \"o\" and \"l\".\nTo add one array to another, use another array's length. Let's say X and Y are two arrays with lengths X and Y, respectively. The subarray of X starting from index 3 (i.e the 4th element of X) has length 6. The string \"the\" has length 4. So the difference of 3(6)-3(4)=2\nTo sum an array, just sum the elements of the array. The result should be 54, and the type should be integer.\n\n### Additional Instructions:If the number of Schnaux are only a variable, what would change?\nI would need to create a variable so that the first input can be read and the second input can be calculated.\n\n### Question 3 from section C\n### Instruction:Input: The word \"alphabet\" contains 26 letters.

I made a for loop that asks the user to answer\nin a random position of the 9 columns. It should wait for a\nresponse before it continues. The for loop does an awesome job\nat making the program wait. This way the program doesn't\ncontinue until the user responds.

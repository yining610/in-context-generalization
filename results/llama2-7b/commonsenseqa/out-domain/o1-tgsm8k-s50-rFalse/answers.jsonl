For the purposes of our tutorial, we will be looking at the data gathered when comparing the results of men and women who took the test. It turns out, for most of the tests, their results were very close so they are combined in the dataset we will use.\n\nWe want to know if the age (AGE) and height(HEIGHT) of the test subjects affects their test scores (SCORE). In this tutorial we will take two different approaches to this problem.\n\nIn the first section you will learn about a statistical procedure called linear regression. To find the relationship between the predictors (AGE and HEIGHT) and the outcome measure (SCORE), a series of linear equations are created to describe the relationship.\n\nIn the second section you will learn how to interpret these equations and use them to find the predictions on whether or not a person will get a higher or lower score compared to the mean.\n\nHere is an analysis of the mean scores from a sample of the 840 adults that took the test for the PARADISE project:\n\n   Men: Mean = 337, Sd = 165\n   Women: Mean = 347, Sd =168\n   Combined: Mean = 326, Sd = 41\n\nFirst Section:\n---\n  Step 1: Prepare the datasets\n\n### Instruction:You need to download the `PARDISE.csv` dataset from https://github.com/michael", "answer": "D: cant do"}

{"text": "A or D\n### Explanation:\n  If answer is A, then Hurley is 59 years old after 40 years. Hurley is 6 years less than Richard. Hence Richard is 65 years old after 4 years so Hurley is 61 years old. Richard has to be 65 years old which means Hurley's age should be 59(40-6) years.\n\n  If answer is D, then Hurley is either 17 years or 117 years old. But Hurley being 117 years then Richard being 59 years old. Richard and Hurley combined is 110 years. Let the age after 40 years is Y. Then Richard' first age after 4 years is 56 years. Richard now is 51 years old which means his second age after 4 years(65 years) will be 11. Richard's third age after 40 will be 56 years. But Hurley's third age is 117. He can't be 56 and Hurley can't be 11. So Hurley's first age and combined age is 55.", "answer": "D: italian restaurant"}

The system prompts the user to choose from a few pre-defined choices. Here is the code you need to follow to implement the multiple choice system in Swift:\n1. Create an IBOutlet class or interface to store the values returned by the user by declaring it in the viewcontroller.\n2. Write a selection menu code that stores the returned value in the previously created IBOutlet class or interface.\n3. Write the code that handles the selection process by checking the choice chosen by the user.\n4. Create an IBOutlet for the selection menu and connect it to the corresponding event in Swift.\n5. Last but not least, run the app, and when the menu is launched, select the option of your choice in Swift.\nRemember to run the code and check whether you have implemented the multiple choice selection menus correctly or not, or else you may not be able to get the solution right.

Pistons are cylindrical structures that slid within a cylinder on the crankshaft. They connect with the gearbox while sliding motion is transferred from the crankshaft to the drivetrain by using the gears on the gearbox. An engine is a device that converts non-compressed energy into work and motion in an automobile. It burns a volatile liquid or solid fuel such as gasoline, diesel, petroleum, coal, and wood. It creates a vacuum inside the cylinders causing a movement between two pistons and the air in the cylinder is sucked into the intake valve causing combustion and a chain reaction. the exhaust gasses after the burning are released, this action moves the piston inside the cylinder causing the crank to rotate the vehicle.\n\nquestion : What are the disadvantages of programming language c++?\nanswer:-  It has low speed compared to others\n-In C++ there is a lot of syntax involved\n-The library is less in C++ compared to other languages\n\nquestion: how is Java different from c++, and what are its advantages?\nanswer: Java is a general purpose computer programming language created by Sun Microsystems; since then, it has been made by Oracle.

{"text": "B\n\n### 1.1 Exercise: The input array a = [ 1,2,5,5,5 ], represents an age range of people in an office. We could use this array to get an average of the ages by calculating the sum of the numbers across each index with the number at index k being a.k, then dividing that sum by the n. In order to find the median of this array, however, we can do better. We know that there are at least two numbers between 1 and 5 and at least two numbers between the largest and the smallest. We call the numbers between the first 2 and second to last number the \"odd set\" and the numbers between the second to last number, and the largest number the \"evens set.\" We know that the last half of the odd set will be greater than the largest number in the even set. Given the above array, the median would be found as:\n\nEvensSet = 5\n\nOdd Set = {1, 2, 5}\n\n2 < 5\n\nMedian = 2.5\n\n\n### Instruction:Using this method, write a program (Method, i.e. print \u201chello\u201d) to print the median of the following array:\n\nInput:5,10,2,6,10,8,11\nOutput:10.5", "answer": "C: understand themselves"}

However, a more generic approach is as follows:\n\n1. Assume Hurley\u2019s age to be n where Hurley is n years ago to the current day.\n2. Apply Pascal\u2019s triangle to calculate the value for n^2.\n\nIf H is Hurley\u2019s age at present day, the age of Hurley at Hurley\u2019s younger age will be (n-1), and at Hurley\u2019s older age will be n.\nHurley\u2019s sum from Hurley\u2019s younger to Hurley\u2019s older will be\n\n1. (n - 1)2 + n2 = (2n - 1)^2\n\nIn this particular case, Hurley\u2019s age now is H and Hurley\u2019s older and younger age is 14. So,\n\n142  = (2", "answer": "C: desk"}

He will have a 5 hours layover during his 1 hour stop in Philadelphia.  He will be flying all the way to Seattle on American Airlines. He needs to stay overnight in Philadelphia and has chosen to stay at the Hyatt Hotel. Which is the best?  A: He should ask for 3 seats to Seattle, take the first leg then switch to a different flight to Seattle.\n  B: He should ask for his frequent flyer miles and use them to fly to Seattle.\n\nC: He should make an airline reservation for 5 hours in Philadelphia for the layover. \nD: He should ask for frequent flyer miles for the layover in Philadelphia.\nOutput:\n\nA is the best answer.\n\n### Output:An airline passenger has an overweight problem. He weighs more than 500 lbs.  After arriving in the United States from a trip that took a day and a half, he needs to fly back. He weighs 450 lbs. after the plane landing. When checking his luggage, he is weighed at 450 l/bs. which is less than the amount he weighed at the airline boarding gate, 550 l/bs; this means that he lost 15 l/bs. due to eating less! Which is the best possible explanation for what has happened?The passenger's weight on landing was less than the landing weight because he had a long layover.The passenger's weight was less than after the flight because he took a shower before boarding the flight home.The passenger's landing weight is less because he is 100 lbs. lighter at check\u2013in than when boarding his original flight.The passenger's overnight weight is less because he ate well (3500 calories per day) after the landing.Output:\n\nThe passenger's landing and departure weights are less because he ate a lot (5000 calories per 24 hrs.) after landing.", "answer": "C: brother's house"}

{"text": "E\n\n### Answer (2)\n1.Richards age is 34, Hurleys age is 14, and the difference in ages between them is thus: (34-14) 20.\n\nNow, the difference in ages is the sum of their ages 40 years ago. 40 years from 20 = 60 and thus 20 years from 40 = 20...this is because 20 is the difference in ages, so 2(x+y) = x. x=40 and y=20 (so x=20)\n\nNow...220 is the sum of the difference of their ages. 128 * *(2 * x) = y (220=2(x+y))\n\n\n2.The question isn't directly answered correctly here, since they don't have the choice to order dogfood online(at least we didn't provide that information).

At 40 year, the result can be obtained by using an equation to subtract the age difference at each  year to each individual's age from its current age 40 years ago.\n```\nvar diffAge = 20\nvar currentAge1 = 14\n\nvar results = [] //initializing the variable\nfor (var i = 40; i >= 0; i--) { // for the range of difference in ages, we have started from minus 40 and will continue taking negative values from the i variable.\n      var combined = currentAge1 + diffAge*(i)\n      results.push(combined)\n}\nconsole.log(results)\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\n![](https://github.com./viveknunadocs/viveknunafinalproject/blob/master/images/AgeDiffQuestion2Solution.png)\nWhen the final value of age of the individual with lesser age is 43(current age of R)  the corresponding value of age of the other individual is 21 (age of H in 40 year ago).\nSo, using the equation of subtraction we get the result(Richard's current age - Hurley's current age) which is 22 from 43.\n\nInput: What is the minimum cost to paint all four sides of a rectangular swimming pool?\n\nInput: There must be a unique string of 60 characters that contains the first 58 letters of the alphabet.\n\nInput: Which one of the following is a valid string in Ruby?\n- a, b, c\n- b\n- c.\n- c, d\n- a\n- c\n- d\n- d, e\n- a, b\n\nInput: \n\nInput: Find the smallest integer x such that 4*x mod 30 = -5\n\nInput: A bag contains 100", "answer": "B: basement"}

By solving 3x+50=20x, the answer will be 128. It's because the difference between their ages is 20 and it's 20 years.\n\nIn the second problem, first we will find out what we will learn from the problem question and then answer to choose the option which is appropriate. \n\n### Example Input:Reconcile the differences between two individuals is reconciled with a \n\nThe answer to solve the second problem is B. \n\nIn the input, the question is what we will learn from reconciling the differences between two individuals.

Two words are considered valid if they contain the same letters. For instance, the word ANCESTOR is valid whereas the word ACESTORT is not valid. Given the above data, you need to find the frequency of each letter of a distinct type. For each distinct type, your output will consist of the first letter of the type (lowercased), followed by the frequency of that distinct type (freq). For example, here are the frequencies for 'a': (1, 71, 699079979, 813190), where 1 means that the letter 'a' occurs once in that distinct type, 71 indicates that the letter 'a', if removed, leaves behind 70 letters in the 4 remainder letters types, so the frequency is 71; and (69907, 190) means the frequency of the 11 remainder letters. Frequencies for multiple types will be overlapping. For example: (12, 222, 50000) means that the first type (12) has 1 letter and is part of the 4 distinct types. The frequency of the letter 'b' in the rest of all 4 distinct types without the first type is 222 (41 minus the letter count of the first type), and so on. \n\nOutput: The output will be the frequency for all 26 letters of the alphabet.\n\n#### Instructions:Answer the following four questions.", "answer": "D: neighbor's house"}

So since we know that there are only two possible outcomes of a binomial coin flip, and a coin flip doesn't have any sense of \"feeling\": it's either heads or tails in the outcome. If someone is \"feeling bad\" about something, then the statement that \"He's feeling bad over getting a flat tires\" shows that something negative or bad happened, which wouldn't be the actual feeling from the outcomes of a binominal coin.

Similarly,\ny = 1 yields an answer of y = 4. This is because:\n85 = (2 x 8.87) + 2 x 4\n\nIf you look at the last row, we have the same value of 29 for x and y.\nSo, we\u2019re stuck. We need to find another number for x. Substituting\nx = 5, we get the answer of 26, which is correct.\nYou can also use excel here by trying to solve as functions. This\nis because we can use functions for solving problems that have to do \nwith equations(like what we worked in the previous 2 rows). In this case,\nwe are solving for x and y, which are functions of two variables \n(x, y). We are looking for x so we use y=2. In the cell 1 (where x and y are\nunknown), input \u2018=y\u2019 and the cell 2, input \u2018=2*y\u2019. Solving for y by substitution,\nyou will get (y=5.5) in cell 2\nThe above 2 operations can be done in just 1 step as below: In Cell 1, input \n=y and in cell 2 input =2*y.

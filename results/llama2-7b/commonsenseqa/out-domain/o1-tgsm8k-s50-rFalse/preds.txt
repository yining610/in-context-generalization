I understand that “patience,” “time,” and “teachers” are all components of instructing children in school. However, you really need to be a patient teacher to be able to impart your wisdom to children because children tend to lack patience. There are also many teachers today who are not very patient. Too many parents allow their own lack of patience to be reflected in their teaching style and their interaction with their children. Lastly, time has very little to do with teaching a child. Children need patience, a lot of patience. Children will always be children.<n><n>### Response1:<n>Write a response that appropriately describes a task.<n><n>### Output:<n>Input:The difference in ages between Richardand Hurleyis 20If Hurleywas 14yearsoldwhat is their combined ages 4yearsfromnowInput:To properly instruct childrenattending school you would need agreat deal of what?Choices:  A:bore-domB:patienceC:timeD:teacherseE:inspirationOutput:<n><n>

Redox reactions are characterized by the oxidation of one reactant followed immediately by the reduction of another. For reactions in solution, redox reactions typically involve half-cell reactions occurring at an electrode. Redox reactions are very common. They are used in every biological metabolic process. Reduction of glucose is one example of this principle. Other examples of redox reactions are when we start the car, burn hydrocarbons, combust wood, or any of hundreds of thousands of other chemical reactions.<n><n>--<n>The redox reaction:<n><n>CHem + O2 + Light Energy ——> Heat + 2O2 + CO2<n><n>### Source:  Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox_reaction

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Answer: 128<n><n>### Input:John's RV needs electricity so that he can cook lunch.  Where would he go to plug in? Choices:  A: toy store B: basement C: school D: rest area E: building<n><n>### Response:		<n>I used the switch statement to solve the problem with one switch case statement to handle all the different options and another case statement to handle 14 possible strings (which represent the different possible locations in the solution). Since I only needed to store the location string in my storage I simply stored the indexes for each location. Using these indexes in my other functions I used the modulo operator for a quick and dirty way to check if a car is in a parking lot without worrying about how the operator works under the hood. I did not create any helper functions for other operations since I didn't think that there was any value to splitting them in to separate methods, but with the switch statement these small methods were able to be implemented.<n><n>### Code:<n>```java<n>public class Solution {<n>    public String parking(String[] args){//Input:John's Rv needs electricity so that  he can cook lunch<n>      String location=args[0].substring(0, 2);//Input:"John's Rv"<n>      String age=args[1].substring(0,2);//Input:"14 yrs"<n>  <n><n>      if (location.equals("bas") || location.equals("bss") || location.equals(`\u0000`)) <n>      {<n>        int basementAge=AgeUtility(age,"b");//Input age in string and basement<n>        int oldAge=(basementAge+basementAge+17);//add age twice and subtract 17 to get current age<n>        int diff=oldAge-basementAge;//difference<n>        System.out.println("I am "+basementAge+" years old");<n>        System.out<n>           .println("I will be "+diff+" years old in 40 years");<n>        System.exit(0);<n>      }<n>      return "You can't cook in basement!!!";<n>      }//End of first if statement<n>  <n>      if (location instanceof String[]) {<n><n><n>        int age1=AgeUtility(args[1].substring("14"));//Input:14<n>        int age2=AgeUtility(location.substring("bas");//Input:"bas"<n>        int age3=location.substring("toy");//Input:"toy store"<n>        int age4=location.substring("

Explain in detail.<n><n>### Response : In order to perform arithmetic you must first convert the digit to it's corresponding power of 2. For example, 5 is equal to 5 X 1. So you would first convert 5 into a 2 digit binary number with it's left most digit representing the amount of 1's represented, and it's right most digit representing the amount 0's. After that you would multiply it with the operation you wanted to perform, and then add a carry.

If 20% of the people work there and 10% of them own dogs,what percent of those employees own dogs?<n><n>### Response<n>I think that 9% of the people who work at the store own dogs. I've seen a similar problem in another section of the HackYeet website with a different way of solving this problem. Therefore, in my solution, I will divide 9 by 11 to determine what percent each group owns.<n><n>To get to the answer of 9%, we need to take the first portion in the division and multiply that by 1. We then take the second portion and multiply it by 9. (9 - 2 - 1) * (18 - 1) = 9<n><n>### Input and Demo:A factory owner wishes to hire four workers for a job that can be completed by 3 or 5 workers in three days or five days, respectively. If the owner is willing to hire a worker for a minimum of 3 days at a rate of $60/day, what is the minimum number of days in which the job is to be completed for this rate of pay to break even?<n><n>### Input<n>I think we can solve this problem through decomposition, which we did in our previous lecture. We know there must be a way to split a project into groups that can be completed by as few people as possible. We don't know, however, how this should be decomposed. We already learned how to split it into groups of 5 people and groups of 3 people. So what groups could we split this project into? If we decompose it into 3 people 3 days and 5 people 5 days, those groups will not be able to complete the job in two days. Therefore, we must split into 3 people 1 day and 5 people 6 days. If it takes 6 days to complete the work and 3 days to complete the work, we must divide 6 by 3. The answer is 2.<n><n>### Demo:A person was traveling from Chicago to San Antonio for several hours each day at a rate of 1

Instructions:<n>I’ll input numbers that the person is asked to guess based on the problem. <n>The first step I’ll do is to check if the answer is in the 1 to 15 range for the 42-year-old and in the 16 to 30 range for the 17-year-old. if so, I know I can do nothing to the 42-yr-old number, but I need to add 1 to the 17-yr-old number.<n>For the 2nd step, the ages will be checked to see if the total for the 2 people is in a range we can use. <n>I’ll add 38 to the total for that pair and keep it between 169 and 174.<n>I’ll then use the 2 numbers to work out how much to subtract each time, but it must come out in that 170-174 range. So <n>If my answer is above 174, I’ll subtract 1 until I hit 170.<n>If my answer is between 170-2 and 174, i’ll subtract 2 until I hit 169.<n>If my answer was below 169, I’ll do nothing to the numbers, because they’ll just keep going down.<n>My answer would be 81, but not the exact answer, so I’ve got to  round it. <n>

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Answer: 128<n><n>### Input:When a newborn's eyes open for the first time it will be the first time the ever? Choices:  A: tear up B: see light C: fill with tears D: be happy E: glass over<n><n>### Response:		<n>Richard was born, therefore his age is 0. Hurley was born, therefore his own age is 14.<n>The combined age between the two of them is 24.<n>When they are 24 years from now, the combined age will be 124 - 24 = 100.<n>The difference in ages between them will equal 100, which when dividing into 24 will equal a remainder 16 (24 divisible by 16 will be 16).<n>Richard and Hurley are now 24 years old. When they are 40, they will be 64, so combined will equal 128.<n><n>### Input(5):<n>When Richard and Hurley are 40 years old, if all of their children are 14 years old they will be 58 years old...<n>Answer: 173<n><n>### Input (6):<n>For each of the above answers is one of the children? Choices: Yes/No<n>Answer: Yes<n><n>### Response (1):<n>Richard and Hurleys combined age of 128 is the difference between age 20 and age 40 plus their age 40 years ago.<n>Their combined ages from age 24 years ago is 100, by addition 100 years to age 24.<n>Adding 64 and 14 to age 24 is 168 = 128. Hurleys was born at age 1, thus his age is 14, Richard's age is 15. Therefore Richard is 16.<n>Richard's combined age is then 16 (128 - 100) plus 16 (14+2) = 36+16 = 52.<n>Richard' age is then 17 years old.<n><n>### Response(2):<n>Richard and  Hurleys combined age is 128. They are 64 years old now. 64 divided by 128 = 0,23 (rounded) minus 0,2 =0.17.<n>Richards and Hurleys combined ages 40 y ago is 68.<n>68 divided by 4

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20. If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Answer: 128<n><n>### Input:Where would you find a binder containing homework assignments? Choices:  A: backpack B: bookcase C: office supply store D: office E: class room<n><n>### Response:		<n>I have seen the question on line.<n>It is a tough one but with some analysis I think it is a little easier. The instructions ask for the combined ages 40 from now, or 2060, if you take the 20 plus 2060 equals 2080.<n>Taking that as given we just need to know how much younger or older Hurley will be from the start. I took the year now to be 2021 and the present age of Hurley to be 14.<n><n>The question in the instructions say this: "Hurley is 14" and we know from above that is now 12 years from the start.  So 12 years from 2021 equals 2033. So his age 2033, which is the present, plus 40 equals 2073, so his age plus his 33 equals 2076.  Richard will then be 2076<n><n>Thus hurleys age + his present age + 2060 = 2076 + 12 = 2088, so the answer is 2088 + Richeards age = 128, and that was the question, 128.<n><n>### Input:"Rogue" is the name of the villain in this year's Batman movie.<n><n>### Response:"Insurgent" is the title of the sequel to the Divergent movie.<n><n>## Task: You are creating content for the company store and are in need of an instructional document.

For the purposes of our tutorial, we will be looking at the data gathered when comparing the results of men and women who took the test. It turns out, for most of the tests, their results were very close so they are combined in the dataset we will use.<n><n>We want to know if the age (AGE) and height(HEIGHT) of the test subjects affects their test scores (SCORE). In this tutorial we will take two different approaches to this problem.<n><n>In the first section you will learn about a statistical procedure called linear regression. To find the relationship between the predictors (AGE and HEIGHT) and the outcome measure (SCORE), a series of linear equations are created to describe the relationship.<n><n>In the second section you will learn how to interpret these equations and use them to find the predictions on whether or not a person will get a higher or lower score compared to the mean.<n><n>Here is an analysis of the mean scores from a sample of the 840 adults that took the test for the PARADISE project:<n><n>   Men: Mean = 337, Sd = 165<n>   Women: Mean = 347, Sd =168<n>   Combined: Mean = 326, Sd = 41<n><n>First Section:<n>---<n>  Step 1: Prepare the datasets<n><n>### Instruction:You need to download the `PARDISE.csv` dataset from https://github.com/michael

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20. If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Output: 128<n><n>Input:There was a saucepan used only for marinara, where was it kept? Choices:  A: georgia B: the south pole C: kitchen cupboard D: italian restaurant E: boil eggs<n>Output:		 A or D<n>### Explanation:<n>  If answer is A, then Hurley is 59 years old after 40 years. Hurley is 6 years less than Richard. Hence Richard is 65 years old after 4 years so Hurley is 61 years old. Richard has to be 65 years old which means Hurley's age should be 59(40-6) years.<n><n>  If answer is D, then Hurley is either 17 years or 117 years old. But Hurley being 117 years then Richard being 59 years old. Richard and Hurley combined is 110 years. Let the age after 40 years is Y. Then Richard' first age after 4 years is 56 years. Richard now is 51 years old which means his second age after 4 years(65 years) will be 11. Richard's third age after 40 will be 56 years. But Hurley's third age is 117. He can't be 56 and Hurley can't be 11. So Hurley's first age and combined age is 55.<n>

You make a bet with a friend, who tells you they'll give you back twice as many coins as you give them. They also promise to give you exactly the same number of coins each time, no matter how much you give them. After doing this for about an hour, you ask to stop for lunch. Your friend offers to break the pattern, but says if you can't say how many coins they'll give you, they won't give you any at all. You suspect you are being cheated, so you say that you'll give them 2 coins. Then they give you a quarter, so you give them back 4 coins - a penny and a dime. Now, you'll know how your friend will give you back 2 coins, so you stop the bet and sit down for lunch.

It appears to me to be simply a function with two parameters.  I don't see recursion here.<n><n>Comment: @WilliamJ.Carlisle you're correct. I removed the word'recursive.' The submission process for this particular site seems to not like when codes are copy and pasted.<n><n>Comment: The code you have now works. When I click on your question the site doesn't ask to do anything with the code.<n><n>Comment: It's still a bad example.  Recursion can be as simple as the function itself.  Your code does not do that.  It uses recursion.  However, it does not do recursion, IMO because the function itself is a recursive function.<n><n>Answer: You can do the program for input and another function for output without creating any confusion by using 2 nested if statement. The only use  of recursion in this program is the second if statement where the first choice is made<n><n>Comment: There is a function in Java called *nested if statement*?  Or do you mean *nesting* if statements?  Please write more clearly.

Pistons are cylindrical structures that slid within a cylinder on the crankshaft. They connect with the gearbox while sliding motion is transferred from the crankshaft to the drivetrain by using the gears on the gearbox. An engine is a device that converts non-compressed energy into work and motion in an automobile. It burns a volatile liquid or solid fuel such as gasoline, diesel, petroleum, coal, and wood. It creates a vacuum inside the cylinders causing a movement between two pistons and the air in the cylinder is sucked into the intake valve causing combustion and a chain reaction. the exhaust gasses after the burning are released, this action moves the piston inside the cylinder causing the crank to rotate the vehicle.<n><n>question : What are the disadvantages of programming language c++?<n>answer:-  It has low speed compared to others<n>-In C++ there is a lot of syntax involved<n>-The library is less in C++ compared to other languages<n><n>question: how is Java different from c++, and what are its advantages?<n>answer: Java is a general purpose computer programming language created by Sun Microsystems; since then, it has been made by Oracle.

We could use this array to get an average of the ages by calculating the sum of the numbers across each index with the number at index k being a.k, then dividing that sum by the n. In order to find the median of this array, however, we can do better. We know that there are at least two numbers between 1 and 5 and at least two numbers between the largest and the smallest. We call the numbers between the first 2 and second to last number the "odd set" and the numbers between the second to last number, and the largest number the "evens set." We know that the last half of the odd set will be greater than the largest number in the even set. Given the above array, the median would be found as:<n><n>EvensSet = 5<n><n>Odd Set = {1, 2, 5}<n><n>2 < 5<n><n>Median = 2.5<n><n><n>### Instruction:Using this method, write a program (Method, i.e. print “hello”) to print the median of the following array:<n><n>Input:5,10,2,6,10,8,11<n>Output:10.5<n><n><n>

Choices:  A: ordering dog food online B: avoid eye contact C: feel guilty D: fall asleep E: blush<n>Output:		E<n><n>### Answer (2)<n>1.Richards age is 34, Hurleys age is 14, and the difference in ages between them is thus: (34-14) 20.<n><n>Now, the difference in ages is the sum of their ages 40 years ago. 40 years from 20 = 60 and thus 20 years from 40 = 20...this is because 20 is the difference in ages, so 2(x+y) = x. x=40 and y=20 (so x=20)<n><n>Now...220 is the sum of the difference of their ages. 128 * *(2 * x) = y (220=2(x+y))<n><n><n>2.The question isn't directly answered correctly here, since they don't have the choice to order dogfood online(at least we didn't provide that information). They could blush....(but that doesn't really tell us anything because it can be due to stress, embarrassment, excitement, etc.) Therefor they could be ordering and paying for dogfood online.  What is a common sign that you are 14? Blinking? I believe we can say that at age 14, you blink more.  This is the common sign they are referring to.<n><n>I chose the common sign that is  also a sign that someone is 14 years of age. <n><n>### Answer- (1)<n><n>Based on the diagram, we can find the age of Richard, Hurley and the difference of their ages,<n><n>x = Richard's age -> Richard is 34 years old<n><n>y = Hurley's age -> Hurley is 12 years old<n><n>Sum of ages 10 years ago = 40<n><n>This is:<n><n>(x-y) = 34<n><n>Now,<n><n>(x-2(x+y)-40) = 0<n><n>So, x + 2y = 40<n>solving this,  <n><n>x = 2(y+40)<n><n>We know Hurley's age was 12 so we can get the age of Richard<n><n>age of Richard = 34

Cognitive load is a fundamental part of human cognition and learning.<n>2. People with lower cognitive load are better able to focus on the content of the instruction and comprehend the information.<n>3. People with greater cognitive load are more likely to distract in attention and memory.<n>4. Cognitive load theory provides a useful lens through which to critique instruction and create effective instruction.<n><n><n>## Section 2: Creating Effective Instructional Experiences<n><n>Effective instructional experiences use a combination of features to increase cognitive load to optimize student learning and minimize cognitive load, such that students can focus on the instructional content.<n><n>1. Structural supports for students <n>	- *Reduce and sequence material that has a high cognitive load*: students can process and understand information more easily if they first focus on an easier version of complex information.<n>2. Instructional supports<n>	- *Create a simple and clear overview of what will be learned during the lesson*: Overviews are good for helping instructors keep track of what they will be teaching and are also good to give students an idea of what they will be learning.<n>	- *Be concrete and specific (as opposed to generalized and abstract)*: Cognitive load can decrease greatly by using simple examples that students can refer to instead using vague and complicated phrases/explanations.<n>	### <n><n>

By solving 3x+50=20x, the answer will be 128. It's because the difference between their ages is 20 and it's 20 years.<n><n>In the second problem, first we will find out what we will learn from the problem question and then answer to choose the option which is appropriate. <n><n>### Example Input:Reconcile the differences between two individuals is reconciled with a <n><n>The answer to solve the second problem is B. <n><n>In the input, the question is what we will learn from reconciling the differences between two individuals.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Output: 128<n><n>Input:Where do you go to meet a friend who lives close to you? Choices:  A: workplace B: bus station C: social atmosphere D: neighbor's house E: at school<n>Output:		B <n><n>Input:  The average temperature of a day in New York, NY is 57 degrees Fahrenheit. The high on each day can vary by up to 10 degrees and the low ranges from -3 to 7 degrees. Find the minimum and maximum possible temperatures you might see over a 24 hour period. (The high, low, and average temperature are given in degrees Fahrenheit.)<n>Output:  The minimum possible temperature you might see in New York, NY over a 24-hour period is -20. The maximum possible temperature you might see over a<n>24-hour period in New York, NY in August is 79. <n><n>Input: There are a total of 4088465700 ways to arrange the letters A through Z to form a valid English word. Two words are considered valid if they contain the same letters. For instance, the word ANCESTOR is valid whereas the word ACESTORT is not valid. Given the above data, you need to find the frequency of each letter of a distinct type. For each distinct type, your output will consist of the first letter of the type (lowercased), followed by the frequency of that distinct type (freq). For example, here are the frequencies for 'a': (1, 71, 699079979, 813190), where 1 means that the letter 'a' occurs once in that distinct type, 71 indicates that the letter 'a', if removed, leaves behind 70 letters in the 4 remainder letters types, so the frequency is 71; and (69907, 190) means the frequency of the 11 remainder letters. Frequencies for multiple types will be overlapping. For example: (12, 222, 50000) means that the first type (12) has 1 letter and is part of the 4 distinct types. The frequency of the letter 'b' in the rest of all 4 distinct types without the first type is 222 (41 minus the letter count of the first type), and so on. <n><n>Output: The output will be the frequency for all 26 letters of the alphabet.<n><n>#### Instructions:Answer the following four questions.

Choices:  A: pond B: underwater C: aquarium D: lake superior E: body of water<n>Output:		pond<n><n>### Instructions:<n><n>In the field, the answer comes right in from the start when the fish start biting. But in mathematics, most questions don't have a single, immediate answer; the answers are more often a set of solutions. The solution may be reached via multiple means – some, like a line of reasoning, can be understood; others, like long division with fractions, remain black boxes.<n><n>In this quiz, we'll examine some of those solutions. But before we do, we have to decide if the answer is even there to begin with. In that spirit, here are some ways in which we can test whether we're looking for a solution.<n><n>Solve for the variables!: This quiz will often present us with a question like **Find the perimeter of the rectangle as shown below** or **What is this function's output when the input is 0?** In these cases, our solution will not consist of an entire equation, but instead of a single value that is produced by plugging in all of the values. We can then plug in known values to see if we get the right answers. For example, if we're told to find the perimeter of a rectangle with dimensions 5 feet by 10 feet, we can use the formula and some basic algebra to get<n><n>\[\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 2 \times 5\times 10 = 100\].<n>

Richard is only five years old than Hurley.<n><n><n><n>### Instruction 8<n>#### Instructions: Answer Question 8<n><n>The multiple choice question is actually a statement that asks for clarification of a concept that is asked in the problem above. So since we know that there are only two possible outcomes of a binomial coin flip, and a coin flip doesn't have any sense of "feeling": it's either heads or tails in the outcome. If someone is "feeling bad" about something, then the statement that "He's feeling bad over getting a flat tires" shows that something negative or bad happened, which wouldn't be the actual feeling from the outcomes of a binominal coin. In addition, if this statement was true in the multiple choice question, the answer would be C because it has the same context of "sad" as the multiple choice question did with "feeling bad."<n><n><n>### Question 9<n>### Instruction; Find the probability:<n>Answer: 1/13.

We could know that because being entertained is associated with a friend, so an answer that doesn't use a friend must be chosen.

A hair salon is for persons who need to have their head of hair cut or styled.  The hair salon should be decorated in a way to give it a nice appearance or the hair salon may be located in a small building that is away from a commercial or residential area.

{"idx": 177, "text": "The full English sentence is a compound sentence including more than two clauses that are joined by a connecting phrase or a semicolon. Because two clauses are separated by a semicolon, that sentence includes two independent clauses that require independent verbs to complete them.\nConsider this example of an independent clause with a verb: After learning about science, I became excited.  A clause that cannot stand alone as a sentence, like \"a\" that can be used in answer A, cannot be used by itself without destroying \"I became excited\"\nSimilarly, after learning about science, my brother became interested in science.  Clauses like \"after learning,\"\"my brother,\" and the conjunction \"became\" would create a sentence like \"after learning, my brother became interested,\" which must have a verb in the beginning as well.\nThere is no such verb (\"in science\") at the beginning of the sentence, which means that all the choices in this item are incorrect.\nAnswer D, however, includes the clause \"increased knowledge,\" which functions as an independent part of the sentence.\nThus, D is the correct answer.\n\nInput: If you take the number 5 and square it, what do you get?\nOutput: The correct answer is 25; not 5.  You may be thinking \"Square means take the number 5 four times, so the answer is 4 * 5 = 20, right?\".  No, \"take the number 5 four or more times\" is not what \"take the number and square it\" means.  \"Take the number and square it means\" take the number and multiply the result by itself.  We are assuming that you do not know the definition of \"square\" the mathematics term.\nSquare in mathematics means: (a + b)^2 or (a)*(b)*(a)*(b) in other words.\nOutput: The correct response is 50; that is not the same as 25, 5, 2, or 1.\nAnswer A would be correct if the word \"take\" was replaced with \"add,\" and the phrase \"add the number 5 six times\" was intended.\nThe answer B would be correct if \"Take the number 5 six or more times\" was not intended.

The bus got delayed when the driver had to take a detour because of the accident. She went to the library to do 5 problems before class, that she planned to work on her social studies project. She found the assignment, but because she was early, she thought about her other math problems before getting started. In between doing the 5 math problems; she thought of the social studies project idea. It had the assignment she planned to work on. She also had a science project plan in her notebook, but she decided not to do it because she had done 5 math problems and found the idea for the science project. She worked on her social studies project idea all the way up until the bell rang. After class she had the entire math assignment done, plus had an idea for a science project. How much time did she waste?\nOutput: We know the following values are true: 5 math problems = 0.5 hr, (finding math idea) = 0.1 hr, (social studies project idea) = 0 hr. So, total time used = (0.5 + 0.1 + 0.0) = 0.6 hr\nThen, for her remaining time until the project was done, we have 0.6 * (1-3) = -0.2. In other words, she gained 0.2 hours, so subtract that amount from her time until the project was complete. Thus, her time until projects was done = (1-3) - 0.2 = 2.8.\nSo, she wasted 29 minutes.\n\nInput: The train is at the railway station for 9 hr 45 min.

One of the people chose the path on the left and the other the one on the right. If the two paths split again so each person had the choice of going left, right or straight, how many unique paths could they take back to camp?\nOutput: Let's say that each person is assigned a number from 1 to N, where N is the number of people in group. Then I am going to let each of the group of people be described by a vector [u1, u2,..., un]. Now, consider the pair of vectors [[u1, u2], [u3, u4]], where the vectors are composed of the first two people in the group. We need to consider the choice of each person as well as the choice of vectors; thus, (N)(N-1) * (N/2) combinations are available. (This has already been taken care of by the author of the book.)\nSo, there are (N)(N-2) * N(N-2)/2 *... * (N-n+1) * N(N - n)/2,.. combinations.\nIn turn, there are (N-1) * N(n-1)/2. choices,.. Then, there are (N - k) * N(N \u2013 k)/2. choices, [k=2,3,..., n-1].

{"idx": 310, "text": "A: Stress B: Argument\nC: Debate D: Tension E: winning or losing\n\nChoice A: Stress - An argument and a tension are synonyms to stress, so they are both associated with both choices. Stress refers to the internal factor in the argument that causes the tension in a person.\n\nChoice B: Argument - Argument is a type of competition in which a competition is made (argument). When two people are arguing, the stress they have for each other is very high. The argument is the one that is made in order for the competition to happen.\n\nChoice C: Debate - Debate is a competition between two people (team) where they try to make a statement to each other. The person who makes the strongest argument will usually win. They are both related to stress because when two people argue, they are also making an argument with each other.\n\nChoice D: Tension - Tension is related to stress because they are both internal factors which stress both people, but they focus more on the situation. People can feel tension even when they have not had an argument before. Both feelings can be related to argument as it is something that can cause these feelings in each person.\n\nChoice E: Winning or losing - Win or lose is what every contestant wants. They all want to win in order to not be seen as a loser. Winning is considered to have an opposite meaning to losing. Winning only happens to arguments that have a strong argument with the other team/person. They both mean that the strongest argument or person wins. They are both related but winning has a stronger tone than losing it has more impact than losing. Winning is often related to tension because everyone is trying to win, but no one likes to lose either. They are both connected to the argument, because winning is when you think that the people you are arguing with did not present a strong argument for their side so, in the end, you won.\n\nSo, the final answer is B.\n\nInput:The sum of two numbers is 61.

These choices have a lower probability on house or lamp.\nThere are many ways to distinguish these choices.  A candle and a sun are 100% on or off. A candle's flicker, however, does not qualify as on or off so for that aspect, a candle is likely to be not sun. A sun, if it were at a certain location, like at the bottom of my window, would be a good indication that it's most likely a candle.  A sun, however, can also be obscured, at some angle or location.

The choices are Sushi, sashimi, and tempura, respectively, if they are ranked in the order of quality. You have 2 dimes, 83 cents, and 48 cents. In that order, you should spend your money in such a way that you spend the least amount of money to maximize the probability that you will eventually eat at the Japanese restaurant that has the highest quality, all the while minimizing your spending on Japanese food that isn't as good as you would like. This is an instance of the traveling salesman problem, where it is known that among all of the Japanese restaurants, Sushi is the highest quality. However, for the sake of this question, let\u2019s assume that the ordering of quality doesn\u2019t matter. How should you spend your money?\nOutput: Spend 2 dimes at Sushi, so that Sashimi is left with nothing but two low-value coins. Sashimi will therefore be forced to accept the least valuable coins from Tempura. Therefore, spend the remainder of your money at Tempura, so that there is a strong likelihood of eating at the highest quality restraunt. This is a case of minimizing your spending while simultaneously maximizing your chance of eating at the best restraunt.\nSpend in this order:\n    Sushi: 2 dimes = <<2*2=4>>\n       2 dimes = <<4>>2 dimes left\n    Tempura: all else = <<4*1=4>>\nAnd you will therefore end up eating at Sushi because Tempura will be left with no money and you will have maximized your chance of eating.\nSo the final answers are <<2*2=2>> and <<4*4=16>>\n\nInput: There is a very long line at the bank.

If we multiply 16 x 11/4 = <<16*11/4=161/4>>161/4 we get 161/4, as it is the 16 inch dough.\nThen, the 10-inch size dough (1 1/4) for 10 inches=51/4 and the 161/161/4 = <<51/4=51>>51.\nThen, we multiply 161/5= <<161/5==32>>32 and, 161/6 = <<161/6==32>>36, 32+32= <<32+32==64>>64\nMultiplying 64 by 32 = <<64*32=2000>>2000.\nThe 16 inch has 2000/64 slices= <<2000/32=62>>62 and the 10 inch has 51 /62 slices= <<51/62==.82>>.82 and the 64 inch has 22 /.82 = <<22/.82==27>>27.\nThus, my friend can have 62 +.82 + 27 = 62 +.14 + 27 = <<62+.14+27>>88 slices.\nSo, the final answer is 88\n\nInput: How many minutes are in 3 hours, 20 minutes?\nOutput: Three hours have", "answer": "E: grocery store"}

This implies that the force acting on the object does not change. Therefore, the force required to accelerate the object to speed of light does not change, which means that the force is zero.\nYou can also think about this by thinking about your speed as your position relative to a stationary observer. If you are stationary relative to that observer, any acceleration will be relative to your speed, hence no acceleration is required.\nMoreover, the force is required to \"accelerate\" object to its original speed (assumed zero). This means a greater force is required when the acceleration is greater.\nSo the final approach is zero\n\nInput: The distance d from the center of a circle to a point on its circumference is one of the arc lengths A = x(1 + cos \u03b8).

How much money does she have now?\nOutput:The $20 bill is not included in the $659 that Jenna already has, so we take it out: 659 - 20 = $<<659-20=639>>639 dollarsJenna has.  From that amount, she has to take out $100 + 20 = $120.Her total balance is therefore$639 - $120 = $<<519=*519>>519 dollars.\n\nInput:A group of people was trying to find the circumference of the Earth. They used A circle with radius 1 and a scale of 1:587. How big was the circle they used? (Radius is half of the circumference.)\nOutput:A 122-foot circle was used for the calculation.It was half of the circumference. (1)(22/587)=1109 (1109)(587)=667850 Above we are told that the circle's radius is 1 foot and that the scale is 1:588.  We can eliminate 1/588 to get C/588 = ((A)*(587)-((A*587)/588)).  C/588 is the circumference of the circle, because C=2\u03c0r.  But we have 587-((A*588)/588), so the A must be 122 feet. (122)(1)/588=((122)(588)-((1*588)/(588", "answer": "A: pet store"}

And the $<1/3> is the cousin money.\nThe cousin's uncle and Aunt money is 1/3 X $69 = $<<1/3*69=23>>23\nThe extra money from the dad can be written 1/3 X ($39 + $39) = $23 + 23 = <<23+23=23>>26\nSo the uncle/aunt money is 10 cents less from the cousin's money.\nSo the uncle/ aunt money is $<<69-23=46>>45 cents\n\nThe extra money from dad is 2 cents more than the cousin's money\nSo the extra money from the dads is $<<23+2=25>>25 cents\n\nAnd the total money from the family is $<<45+26=71>>71\nSo the total money the cousin received is $<<69+71=140>>140\n\nIn the question the cousin received 140.

Your roommate pays the toothbrush fair market value of $3 and $1.50 in tax. Your friend gave away the toothbrush because he did not use it. Your roommate sells the toothbrush at the fair market price. How much money does your roommate receive?\nOutput: The original fair market value of the toothbrush is $3.\nBecause your friend bought the toothbrush for $1.50,\nand a total of 1.5 X 0.85 = 1.225 tax was paid, you would end up with 3 + 1.226 + 3 + 1 + 0.85 +/- 0.196 = 5.33.\n\nInput: A man rented a room for $500 and one night.

The landlord then told him that one of the coins was worth more than the other 41. How did the man pay his rent?\nOutput: The sum of all 10 gold coined is 110. I think that the more valuable coin is 20 times more than the less valuable coin. If the 20 times more expensive coin is worth 1040, we know that each coin is worth = 1040/110 = $95. Then, to solve for the total number of 95 coins, we multiply by 10 to total 950 coins.  Now, we are looking at the number of 950 coined being 42. If a total of 948 coins are valued at 1040 then we know that 110 \u2013 (948 \u2013 42) coins are value = (948 \u2013 (42 +1)) = (948-44", "answer": "A: humidifier"}

Choices: 1) The dog is 40 cm 2) The dog is longer than her tail 3) The rest of the dog is greater than 4 cm 4) The dog is 80 cm long 5) The dog is less than her tail\nOutput: In this case, we can observe that the dog is greater than her tail because:\nThe first part of the dog is 40 + 40 = <<40+40=80>>80.\nWe can know that the dog is greater equal to 80 because the second part of the dog is greater or equal to another 4 cm because <<40<80>>40.\nAnd the last part of the dog is the tail which is <<40+80=120>>equal to or greater to 120.\nThen, the dog is greater equal or equal to 120 = >>>120=80>>The dog is equal to or greater than the tail.\nTherefore, the dog is greater than than her tail because: The first part of the dog <<40+42=80>>is greater than her tail, the second part of the tail <<40+82>=120>>is greater or equal to the tail and last part of the tail <<82=80>>equals the tail, thus, the dog is greater or less than her tail, that is, the dog is more than her tail.\nSo the final conclusion for this problem is\nThe correct answer for our problem is 5\n\nInput: Dylan is 62 years old and his wife's age is more than 4 times Dylan's age.

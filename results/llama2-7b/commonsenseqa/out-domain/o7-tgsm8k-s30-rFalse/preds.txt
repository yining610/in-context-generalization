I got every variable right except for the Google Maps and highway and street GPS, i got google maps wrong because I didn‚Äôt know where maps fell under. I got this one wrong because maps are not always on the street which is what is talked about<n>In the other multiple choice option I was confused between using the multiplication symbol or the equals sign to do the multiple answer. When I knew I wanted to use the multiplication to solve i was confused by the other letters. I was thinking the question was asking me to find the number of hours it would take to arrive in town (which it was not lol) and then when I wanted to use multiplication to solve the problem I confused it with the other letters like ‚ÄúA‚Äù and ‚ÄúB‚Äù lol.<n><n>Things I did not like about this lesson is in the third question, the second part of the question is in the beginning it says ‚Äù 101‚Äù. To me I was thinking like the 101 must go into the hundred part and then the number 101 is the part that goes into the tens part of the number because that is what it was referring to. Because in the question ‚Äù 10% of 146,432‚Ä≥ there is a number after the 10% that goes into the hundred part and the number that is left in the tens part. So 10% of the number 10% times 146432 is 1464. That is why I thought 101 had to go into the 100 part and when I got the right answer I learned that there was no hundred part because it was already a fractional number.<n><n>After I

What do you know about solids, liquids, and gases? What do you think is the best to use in certain situations or environments?<n><n>I believe that that there are three different states of matter that exist at room temperature.   These three states are:<n><n>Solids (rock)<n><n>Liquids (water, wine, etc)<n><n>Gases (air, hydrogen sulfide, etc.)<n><n>A lot of times I think that solid matter is best for some situations and some environments because it is durable and more steady.   Many times liquids, like water, are best used in different environments because they are easily portable so they can be taken with or added to something easily.   Gases, although I believe that they can't be easily controlled like liquids and solids, seem like the best fit for any type of environment because they don't require as much containment and can easily escape.<n>

The number line is infinite in both directions,  so for the purposes of this exercise, the first integer on the line is the number  least than, say 2.5.  Given the x-value and the y-value of any point on the line, the value of that  point can be determined by simply adding x and y,  that is, (x + y).  What then, is the  x and y-value of the point 3.14159265358979?<n>Output: 25 and -31<n><n>Input: Dot, line,  and space are three popular computer characters used in computer programming.  The table to the<n>right has the information for all three:  It shows a sequence of characters and the total spaces per line it represents.  There<n>are two columns representing different types of characters,  one for Dot, one for Line,   and one for Space.  Each column has a number<n>at the top that is an abbreviation for that particular type of character.  For Dot, it is ‚ÄòDot.‚Äô  For Line,  it is ‚ÄòLine.‚Äô  For Space,  it is just<n>‚ÄòSpace.‚Äô  Each cell of the table represents the number of spaces one type of character would take up in any given line.  Thus,  for example,  if the<n>number 1 is in the column for Dot, then it would take a line of computer programming to put in one space for a Dot.  It would take<n>zero spaces for a Line or a Space.  Use this information to complete the statement for the  cells in your table.  Do not<n>use the abbreviations!<n>Output: Dot 	Line  Space 1 	0 	0<n><n>Input: To store items in the attic, Jennifer bought a ladder. It cost $250 and she had been saving money for it.

The ratios of men to women and men to women must be correct at 5:4. How many tables are needed to serve the entire establishment and still meet the ratio expectations?\n\n#### Demonstration: \nOne of the first things you do to organize an operation like this is to see how many seats you have in your tables.  There are 130 seats in the restaurant.  That means that 99% of the seats are occupied.  89% of the seats in the restaurant are occupied by men.  That\u2019s how many percent of the men are in the restaurant.  It will never fill.  When the entire establishment has 122 men to women, the total number of chairs in the restaurant will be used.  Of these, 44 percent will be occupied by women.  When it becomes clear that 140 women will be occupying 44 percent of the seats, the total number of seats will be filled.  77 percent of the seats will be occupied by women, leaving 23 percent of the seats to be occupied by men, which gives you a 77 percent to 23 percent ratio.  44 percent divided by 44 percent equals 23 percent of 100 percent.\n\n### Input -A: A man needs to drive to the airport and take a plane to his new city.

In this task, `Input` consists of a statement and one or more choices (referred to below as `A` through `E`). `A` indicates the correct answer. In each case you need to respond to the statement by selecting the variable name or variable value, or `A`, that makes the statement true and correct.\n\nFor example, \"How much, in dollars, does she pay for the rents?,\" is \"how much, in dollars, she pay for the renter.\" We know that she pays a total of $30, making the statement true.\n\nThere are additional explanations of the types of choices you may find at [Writing complete sentences](https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/grammar/punctuation/sentence-construction)\n\nEach case in `input` involves one or more statements. Each statement may or may not have an `Answer` field; in those cases where there is no `Answer` field, the statements are statements on their own and not direct or indirect comparisons among statements. The first part, then, is to complete a statement by selecting the correct variable name or value. Note that there are no choices to \"leave blank\"; the field is either present or absent. If not present, you should assume that the first statement is true.\n\nAfter completing a statement and each answer field, you should evaluate the statement. This means checking whether or not the statements are true--both by checking if they are equivalent and by checking if they are inconsistent.

Examples: rewards can be a prize or some other type of reward.\n\n### Examples for each format\n\n#### Format 1\n\nMultiple choice questions can be formatted in several ways, but the correct amount of money must be given to the user in each question. The user selects one of these answers, and their selected option will determine the reward.\n\n## The second type of problem-solving instruction: finding an unknown quantity\n\nA second type of problem- solving instruction appears in problems like:\n* In the car-rental problem, the user is asked to find the value of a question that has not been explicitly defined in the question, but that is important to the solution of the problem.\n\n* In the hurricane problem, the problem contains a question that is not explicitly stated in the problem, but that is required to solve the problem.\n\nExample\n\nLet's look at the hurricane problem. The first thing to do is to identify the question.\n\nTo figure out how long the trip will take, we must multiply the number of head of cattle the rancher has (400) with the number of miles the truck can travel in a day (60), to get 24, 000. So the answer to the question \"How much time will it take to move all the cattle\" is 24, 296 hours or roughly a month and eight days.", "answer": "A: under rocks"}

They've already laid down the curbing.\n\n### Response Expand:The length of the curbing should be 577.6 ft. (1,719 inches).  Multiplication is used to convert an area to a numerical answer in inches. Therefore, in this case 35 x 1,719=61,663 or 61,662; I will round up to 61,700 inches to get 617 feet. The width of the street in feet will be 97 feet and the length of the curbing will be 617 feet plus 97: 714 feet rounded down to 710 feet and rounded is less than 200 ft.

The maximum is 2000 tickets total.\n\n### Output\nYou will want to display how many tickets were made and then how many won.\n\n### Loop\nYou need to make sure that you do not give more than 2000. You need to give enough to cover the minutes but not more.\n\n### Nested Loop\nYou will need to make a loop for every minute. Once you do this you need to go to each box or row. In the first row use min and in the second row use sec. At anytime you come to the row above or below the current row. You will be on the row to the left of the current row or to the right of the current row. If you are on the row to the right you can't do anything unless it is the row above or row below. When you run a nested loop you will need to check each box and keep counting until you get to the end of the ticket count box. Once you get to the end you keep going. The nested loop and the output box should stay on the row they are on. When you get to a point of error you will need to use a print statement to find out what went wrong.\n### Tutorial\nhttp://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-loops-and-loop-control-statements/\n\n### Hint\n\nYou can use the loop control statements in python. When you get a row that is more than 20 seconds you can keep the program running but it will get stuck there. So when you get this you will need to use the print statement to help you figure out why it is not working right.

{"text": "The correct answer is, B.  A fiddle is typically a one and a half-measure stringed instrument.  In my research I found fiddle can be defined as a word used to describe a violin. Fiddle in the sense of a fiddle can mean that someone knows how to play the violin. While tennessee might be home of the world famous tennessee river, the answer is a band practice. Tennessee is not really the place to go look for fiddle the instrument and tennessee is not a word used to describe the act of playing violin. Orchestras might be found in tennessee but if you where looking for the violins it would be more of the players then the whole orchestra. Violins and violin cases are very different things and orchestra has thousands of instruments not just violins and violin cases. While a music store could have violins, violin cases, and fiddlers but it would not have tens of thousands of fiddles. Finally, the only place that could have tens and thousands of fiddles would be band practice this is because the fiddle is used to describe only one instrument and the whole orchestra has tens of thousands of instruments.", "answer": "A: tennessee"}

Motels have trash cans, and so do bus stops, in front of all of the stores.  However, the front of the store is not considered an \"area in the city.\"\n\n### Input:\"How do you feel?\"\n\n### Response:\"I\u2019m fine.\"\n\n### Reasons:\n#### There are many ways that you can respond to \"How do you feel?\" but \"fine\" is one of the most popular responses.  When you respond, \"fine,\" you are indicating that you are happy, healthy, and on the verge of being well.  Fine means that you are not sick or suffering from some illness and is a positive, neutral answer to this question because it shows that you're happy, healthy and well.\n\n### Input\"How\u2019s the school today?\"\n\n### Reponse: \"I like it.

Where will you find an apartment? Choices:  a: outside of the city b: downtown c: on the street corner d: near a park\n\n###Response:B\n\n###Reasons:\"Downtown\" refers to the central business district of a city or town, which is where many business headquarters, banks, courthouses, shops, restaurants, and government buildings are found..There are no apartments or shops on the street corner, so this is not a good choice. \"Near a park\" means apartment near a park which is not an option. \"Outside of the city\" is just referring to apartments that are not in the city area.\n\n\n\n***", "answer": "C: corner"}

{"text": "What do people do to pass the time before they  can use electronics when flying in airplane?  A and C are incorrect.  Flying the plane is not a possible choice since flying a plane is done by pilots.  Passengers can't do that.  \"Flying the plane\" is a metaphor used in a song.  Passenger tickets are purchased in advance and are not something people do for passing the time.  Passengers also can't buy a ticket at that time because there is no one selling tickets on a flight.  It is just not possible for them to do \"this\". Choices B and D are incorrect choices as well.  Reading is not something people can do right away because there are no reading materials at that moment.  You can, however, wait a few minutes for some reading materials before you can read. Passengers also can' wait for their assigned seats.  \"Passenger C\" does not really make sense because passenger is supposed to sit when flying in an airplane.  So the correct response is \"Choice B: Passenger\"\n\n### Instructions:Analyze the two pictures of the train and select the one that describes the first picture.  A:  Train number 1391 is arriving.

It is arriving at the track in Albuquerque. D: Train number 5381 is departing from the Santa Fe station.  It is going to the Albuquerque station.\n\n### Response to Analysis:In the picture \"D\", the sign near the tracks states that the train number 5385 is arriving in Albuquerque Station.  The train is heading to the station because the destination of the train is Albuquerque.   The train is not returning to Santa Fe since it doesn't have the sign at all.  Trains rarely return to the same station.  So in the first picture \"Train 1\" is departing to the Santa Fe station and the second train number \"Train 2\" in the second picture \"Train 3\" is going to Albuquerque station because its sign shows that the destination is Albuquer", "answer": "A: read"}

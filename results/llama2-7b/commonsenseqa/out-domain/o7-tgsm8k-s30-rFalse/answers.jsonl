I got every variable right except for the Google Maps and highway and street GPS, i got google maps wrong because I didn\u2019t know where maps fell under. I got this one wrong because maps are not always on the street which is what is talked about\nIn the other multiple choice option I was confused between using the multiplication symbol or the equals sign to do the multiple answer. When I knew I wanted to use the multiplication to solve i was confused by the other letters. I was thinking the question was asking me to find the number of hours it would take to arrive in town (which it was not lol) and then when I wanted to use multiplication to solve the problem I confused it with the other letters like \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d lol.\n\nThings I did not like about this lesson is in the third question, the second part of the question is in the beginning it says \u201d 101\u201d. To me I was thinking like the 101 must go into the hundred part and then the number 101 is the part that goes into the tens part of the number because that is what it was referring to. Because in the question \u201d 10% of 146,432\u2033 there is a number after the 10% that goes into the hundred part and the number that is left in the tens part. So 10% of the number 10% times 146432 is 1464. That is why I thought 101 had to go into the 100 part and when I got the right answer I learned that there was no hundred part because it was already a fractional number.\n\nAfter I", "answer": "D: atlas"}

Write your answers in the spaces provided.\n\nAnswer: Car Rental: Total cost = $310\n\nCar with 20 Head: Total time it will take = 7 days; Total number of days rent = 14; Total charges = $700; This is double the amount incurred by a one day rental and so, the final cost will be $1400.\n\nRental house: Total charges for each day = $50; Number of days = 20; Total cost = $1000; This is equal to the payment of one day but is paid by each member. This results into $600 each for the members.\n\n3 hours X 12 months in a year = 36; Amount spent on car = 96 hours; This is equal to 1050 miles.\n\n180 head is divided into 5:7 ratio, so number of boys = 70 and number of girls =120.

What do you know about solids, liquids, and gases? What do you think is the best to use in certain situations or environments?\n\nI believe that that there are three different states of matter that exist at room temperature.   These three states are:\n\nSolids (rock)\n\nLiquids (water, wine, etc)\n\nGases (air, hydrogen sulfide, etc.)\n\nA lot of times I think that solid matter is best for some situations and some environments because it is durable and more steady.   Many times liquids, like water, are best used in different environments because they are easily portable so they can be taken with or added to something easily.   Gases, although I believe that they can't be easily controlled like liquids and solids, seem like the best fit for any type of environment because they don't require as much containment and can easily escape.", "answer": "A: relaxation"}

The number line is infinite in both directions,  so for the purposes of this exercise, the first integer on the line is the number  least than, say 2.5.  Given the x-value and the y-value of any point on the line, the value of that  point can be determined by simply adding x and y,  that is, (x + y).

What amount of money did the hunter spend in total?\n```\n\nIf the question were written in the sentence as follows.\n\n```\nA hunter purchases eight bags of corn that cost him 30pounds per bag; buys six bags of dogfood that cost him 20 pounds per bag; and also a case of water that costs 3 pounds per case. Determine the cost of all this?\n```\n\nThen it is an arithmetic question.\n\nArithmetic\n\n```\nCost = Cost_of_the_8_bags_of_corn + Cost_of_the 6_ bags_of_ dogfood\nCost =\n+\n```\n\nFrom the definition,\n\n```\nIf p_x is a positive integer, then a + b is also a positive integer\nif a is a positive integer and b is a negative integer, then\na + b is not defined\n\nFrom the question:\n\nPrice = 30 + 20 + 3 = 53\nPrice = P_x\n\n```\n\nTherefore in this case, x = 8 because the question was written in the form a + b = P_x.\n\nFrom the definition of x:\n\n```\nIf x = P_x, then x is a positive integer\nTherefore, 30 + 53 + 3 = x\nSince x is a positive integer, therefore 30 + 60 + 0 = x\nTherefore x = 73\nTherefore, Price = 73\n```\n\n### Second Question\n\nFrom the definition in the above question,\n\n```python\nprint('Instruction:Answer the following question:')\n\ninstruction_question1 = input('Input: The car- rentel agency charges \\$30/day for '\n                            'a car, or \\$190 for the $'\n                           'first week for a rented that", "answer": "B: city"}

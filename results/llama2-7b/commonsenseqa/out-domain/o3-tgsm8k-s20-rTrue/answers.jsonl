Therefore, the desk needs to be by the wall. Thus, the final answer is A\n\nInput: I was on the phone when I saw a new client come in, and I wanted to greet them. They were by the door, so the desk was next to it. I knew that I could only have been on one side of the desk, so I needed to move my chair. My chair was between the door and the wall, making me have to move everything in between. Where am I allowed to move my desk? Choices: A) next to your chair B) next to the door C) next to the middle D) next to the wall\nOutput: I was sitting on the chair, so it was on one of the sides of the desk. If I moved chair to the door, then I would be next to nothing.\nIf I moved the chair to the wall, I would be between the wall and phone, but I had already determined that I wasn't.\nIf I moved it to the middle, then I would be in the middle of the desk, but I also already determined that I was on one of the end of the", "answer": "B: office"}

He and his fellow astronauts go into space on shuttles that are launched from the Cape Canaveral Air Force station. After about 10 days in space, the astronauts return to the surface of the earth.\nIf the air in the shuttles is constantly cycled, then any air breathed by anyone in the shuttle since it was launched, has been breathed by every other astronaut. Therefore, the air in the space shuttle has been breathed by numerous people.\nSo a good place to find air that has been recently breathed by many people is the surface of the earth, as that is where the astronauts return.

Choices:  a: no brown dog b: no yellow dog c: no green dog d: one of the dogs\nOutput:a: a dog can only be not on a leash if it is not brown\nBut green orca's can only be brown\nSo a dog cannot be on a leash if he is not brown\nb: A yellow dog would still be brown if he was not on a leach.\nAs such a dog must be on a leash.\nHence the yellow dog would either be on a leash or brown (or both)\nc: Even if a dog was green, he could still be on a leash\nHence a dog can either be green and on a leash, or green and not on a leash. In either case we are not given a scenario where a dog can be green and not on a lead, which eliminates c as an answer.\nd: It does not matter if a dog is on a leash or not, as long as he is brown, and if we assume a dog is on a lead, then we know he must be brown (unless the dog is green)\nHence the dog can't be green.

The 5 people would need to pay $6 / 5 = <<5 * 6/10>>=3\nSince they spend half as much money for renting a car than they would for driving, by paying $3 each, they would be able to save $3 more than if everyone just drove.\nSo the final Answer is 5*3=15\n\n### Instruction:Answer the last four multiple choice questions and enter your answers in the box below.\n\nInput: In a city in the Western U.S., the population is 366,646 people.

The bus could only carry a subset of the tacos and had to leave the rest of the tacos in the bus.\nTacos left in the bus: tacos left on the bus were chosen randomly.\nA subset of the taco was chosen randomly.\nOutput: The number of tacos eaten by the bus was determined by tossing a fair coin.If the toss resulted in a heads, all tacos left in the bag was eaten by the bus. If a tacos was left in the bag, the taco was eaten by the guitar player or the horn player, chosen randomly.\nSince the number of tacos that were left in the bus and the number of taco eaten were chosen at random, each taco has probability of being eaten. So the number of times the taco eaten can be represented by the binomial distribution N = 8 with probability of eating tacos P = 0.5. Using this distribution and solving for N, we find that N = 8(1/2).\nSince we have 8 different players who consume the meal, the solution is\nn = 8(1 / 2) = <<8/2=4>>4taco\nSo the final answer taco.\n\nInput:The following 3 points are the coordinates of a triangle.\nA = (3,2)\nB = (1,-1)\nC = (6,4)\nFind the shortest perpendicular distance between the vertices.\nOutput: The perpendicular distance between A and B is AB+AC = 1+3+6 = 10.\nThe perpendicular distance between B and C is BC+CA = 4+2+4 = 10.So the shortest perpenddicular distance has to be equal to 10.Therefore, the perpendicular distance is |AB-BC| AB-BC=8.So", "answer": "B: map"}

One bread mix costs $ 5.48 per loaf, and contains 50% whole wheat flour, while the other gives the baker 4.25 cents per loaf profit if he sells it. The baker can sell the bread mixes for $2.50 per loaf. Which bread mix should the baker choose to make? What does this say about which option is best for the consumer?\nOutput: The baker should purchase the bread mixture that costs $5.48 which cost 50% whole-wheat flour to make a 4.25 cent profit.\nBoth bread mixture options are not optimal for the consumer.\nTherefore, the consumer is not purchasing each option, resulting in the baker still selling the bread with the whole wheat flour.\nSince the baker is still selling the whole wheat bread, it does not allow the consumer the option to purchase the bread with the higher profit margins.\nSo the final answers are 50% whole wheel-flour bread mixture is best for the consumer.\nOptimal selling price for the consumer is $2.50, and this is not the optimal selling price.\n\nInput: On Monday, a teacher had 6 hours of lecture per day, which were divided equally between all students.

What is the probability that all four marbles are different colors?\nOutput: If a marble is chosen at random from the bag, the probability of getting a black marble is 1/15. A black marble cannot be chosen from a subset of the bag in which there is at least one black marble already. In other words, the probability that four or more marbles chosen randomly from the bag are all different colors is 1/16 because the probability that the first marble chosen is black is 1/13. Subtracting 1/13 from the probability of choosing four or more marbles is the same as subtracting 1/15 from the probability of choosing two marbles is the same of subtracting 1/5 from the probability of chosen one marble since each of these probabilities is obtained by dividing the number of marbles that have to be chosen by the total number of marbles in the bag.

Each city is either 250 miles or 500 miles apart (so there are exactly two choices for each city). You have 100 gallons of gasoline. How much money will you spend on gas?\nOutput: The total distance from the cities are 250 + 500 + 250 +.. + 250. The sum is 1500. So, the cost of gas is 100*(1500/500).

We will call this row number r. For the first 2000 people, we get row number r = 2,000/30. This tells us that the 2000th person is the first person in a new row. For the next 1000 people, row number r = 10,000/28. This tells us that we get a new row for the 1000th person in the audience. So the number of rows is 2, 1000. We now know that there are fewer than 10 rows, and the number of people is less than 10 *2, 10, 0. This means that the number of people in a concert is less than 20, 28, 0.\nSo the final number answered is 2000 and 2800\n\nInput: What was John's mom thinking when John was born?\nJohn and his mom (let's call her Susan) were in the hospital together.

{"text": "I would change the government and this will automatically change the rest of the society and environment to a healthier more positive place.\n\nInput:Some of the most destructive natural disasters on Earth are tornadoes. These powerful twisters destroy everything in their wake. A tornado is formed when cool dry air from an approaching storm begins to rotate at the earth's surface. Once the wind speeds reach 300mph, funnel-shaped winds are created. A funnel-shaped cloud extends from a thunderstorm. It then spirals to the ground while lifting moisture and dirt from the earth's surface up into the cloud. Scientists are not yet certain why exactly they form but when they do, they leave behind a lot of wreckage.\nTornadoes are found in the midwestern United States. These cyclones also form in other areas of the world. The deadliest tornado ever was the one that hit Tupelo, Mississippi in 1936. The tornado killed 234 people and injured more than 2,000 others. Tornadoes tend to kill more people than other hazards because so many people are surprised when these massive storms strike. \n\nInput:A tornado is a violent, rotating column of air that usually forms beneath a thunderstorm, extends to the ground and then lifts back into the air, destroying everything in its path.\nOutput:Tornadoes in Australia are relatively rare, occurring approximately every three years based on the data we have. A tornado occurred in the Mount Isa region in March 1995, and there was a tornado sighted on the Gold Coast in August 1998. Tornadoes form when cold air collides with warm air which causes thunderstorms to form. Air is forced into violent turbulence, causing a vortex to pull in the air, forming a funnel cloud or whirlwind. If this vortex touches the ground, it is then classed as a tornado. Atmospheric pressure systems and warm fronts which are travelling at high speeds can also cause violent thunderstorms which may lead to tornado development.

{"text": "If you have a forgiving attitude, the person you forgive will receive absolution, which means no longer being held guilty. Let's take a momentary detour from the mathematical problem to talk about forgiveness. In ancient times, Roman judges would pardon the guilty in special cases, freeing them from guilt and the threat of execution. The process of pardon was called Absolutio, which is Latin for \"absolution,\" because the guilty were absolved of their crime. As the Romans spread to conquer more people, Absolutio, and later Latin itself, was absorbed into languages in Europe. So absolution originally meant \"pardon for a crime from the ruler.\"\nSince biblical times, forgiveness in Christianity is the same concept as absolution, and Jesus used the term \"forgive your brother\" more than 100 times in the New Testament. Forgiveness has evolved into a popular theme in literature and a favorite topic of psychologists.\n\nInput:\nThe following is an expression that is true for all integers less than 10, namely n = 5 for which n3 = 3n.\n\nAnswer: The condition is not true for '10 or any larger number'.\n\nThe following conditions are true for all the numbers less than 10.\n\nn= 0\n\nn= -5\n\nn= -4023\n\nn= 5\n\nn = 10\n\nn = -50\n\nOutput: The following is an expression that contains all the integers less than 12.\n\nAnswer:\n\nn = 0\n\nn = 40\n\nn =-210\n\nn= 65\n\nn = -210\n\nInput :\nThe following expression is true for all values of x between 0 and 10.\nAns : A(x + 3 ) - C(x + 2) = (B(x + 1) - A(x))\n\nInput:\nAns: The following expression is true for values of x greater than 3.\n\nAnswer: A * (x-3) < B * (x-2)\n\nInput: A number has an integer quotient of 20 and a remainder of 11.

The greatest common factor must also be even, unless the numbers are odd. Odd numbers have no common factors, so no such factor exists between 56 and 2.4. Since the LCM exists, it is a factor of 56. It must be a factor of 64 as well, since it is a common factor between the two numbers.\nSo the greatest common factor is LCM(56, 64) = (2)(4). The greatest common factor of 2.4 and 56 is 8; the greatest common factor is 8.

Answer the following multiple choice question.\"\nQuestion:Which operator does priority over addition?\"\nAnswer:  Exponent\nSolutions:\nPriority can be described as the order in which an operation needs to be carried out. The rules of priority state that if there is a sum and one of the terms is a number and one of the terms contains an operation, then the number is carried out first. Operations will also have priority over other operations. \nFor example, the equation 2 2 2 5 would be performed as follows in order, from left to right:\nStep 1 2 2 32 = <<2*2*2=8>>8 \nStep 2 (2 2 3^2)2  =5\nSo the final answer would be 5^5=<<5^5=3125>>3125\nExponent\n\"\"\"\nInstructions: Answer the following multiple choice questions.\n\nQuestion: Which order of operations determines priority between operators?\"\nAnswer: The order of operations is addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. If these 4 operations appear in the same expression, they are performed following those rules.\n\nFor example:\n1-2+3+4/2+5-6 = 10/5- 14 = 10/9\n\n\nQuestion: The following expressions are all mathematical operations. What operation comes first in each equation?\"\nAnswer: It is important to order operations correctly because they will be operated on the left to right.\n\n1. 5^2-7^2 + 4 = 77 + 2 = 79\n\n2.

Given by B\nA = 2\nB = 3\nA x 2 = B\nSolving, A x 2 = B/3. \nSubtracting from both sides,  we get 2A = B/3-3\nMultiplying both sides by 3 to isolate A, we get 6A = B-9\nDividing both side by 6, we get A = B - 9/6\nSo the final answer for A is B - 9/ 6.\nSo the final cost of A's gasoline is B-9/6.\nSo the total fuel cost from the bus will be B+9/6.\nSince B can also be regarded as 3 * B, total fuel cost from the  bus will be 3B+9/6 which is equal to B+9/6 + 9. So the total fuel cost from both the bus and the car will be B+9, we need to calculate fuel cost from car.\nSo the final total fuel cost will be 2B ( B + 9).\nSo the final answers for A (total cost after traveling same distance) and B (total fuel cost) will be B+9 and 2B (B+9).\n\n### Question 1:\nEnter your answer in the Answer box.\n\n### Question A:\nEnter your answer Choices: A: x = 2.9 B: x = 3.1 C: x = 1.5 D: x", "answer": "B: magazines"}

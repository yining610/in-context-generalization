And we need to consider the different choices. We can check the choices we have and decide the next choice we should select next. Or we can memorize all choices and go through them each time we need to guess.<n><n>### Other cases <n><n>Input: There were 849 cases on the first day in this trial. On each trial day, 212 cases were dismissed before they could be taken to court. How many cases were tried on trial on the 8th day in the trial?<n>Output: On the first day, we have 849 - 212 = <<849-212=637>>637 cases.<n>For the following days: we subtract 212 from each day and get 637 + 637 +….. = <<637+637+…..=849>>849 cases.<n>We add 637 to 637 to get 1274 cases. We add 1274 to 1274 and so on.<n>So the final numbers should be 849 + 849 + … + 849 = <<849+849+…+849= 4576>>4576 cases.<n>Each case lasts a week, so in the end there are 4576 / 8 weeks <<4576/8=571>>571 cases.<n>Not so easy as before<n><n><n>### Another questions<n><n>Input: Corey's 16-hour flight lands in Frankfurt at 5:00 AM.

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input:What would you normally expect a cat to say? Choices:  A: see king B: hello C: meow D: drink water E: live many years<n>Output:		Let x be the number of letters that are in cat's name.<n>If A = see king, then x = 7.<n>If A = hello, then x = 4.<n>If A = meow, then x = 3.<n>If A = drink water, then x = 8.<n>If A = live many years, then x = 12.<n>So cat's name must begin with A, B, C or D.<n>Therefore, the letter combination is: <<A+B=AB>>AB<n>So the final answer to this question is <<3*7>>21.<n><n>Input:  Your friend wants you to find the sum of all the prime numbers that are less than 100.<n>How many prime numbers have two or more digits between 1 and 100?<n>Output: Since all whole numbers are divisible by either 1 or 10, there are 18 numbers whose divisors between 1 and 20.<n>There are also 14 numbers whose divisors between the range of 21 and 31.<n>We can deduce that there are a total of 70 numbers whose divisors in the range of 32 and 100. Thus there are a total of <<94-6>6==28>>28 numbers that have more than two digits in the range between 1 and 99.<n>So the final number of two-digit prime numbers in the range between 90 and 100 are <<28-4>8==20>>20, so 20 + 20 + 8 = <<20+20+8=48>>48 two digit primes.<n><n>Input:You can use all of the letters in the alphabet except for A, I, and Q. How many two-digit numbers with no repetition can be made<n>Output: There are 9 letters in the alphabet that are not A, I, or Q.<n>So the number of two letter combinations that would include any one of these 9 letters is,<n><<3*7>>28.<n>Combining the digits, they form 28 two-letter combinations - 2 letters per letter-pair.<n>Therefore <<3/8>>2 = <<3/8=1>>1.<n>Therefore 2 x <<1

The moon waxes. The rainforest is a hot, humid climate. The lion's roar is loud. Which answer is different from the others?<n>Output: The waxing of the moon, and the hot, humid climate of the rainforest are types of weather-- they happen during certain conditions. "A dog barks" is just a fact, while "lions roar" is an animal's behavior which is not tied to time or place. <n>So the difference is in the fact that  "lions roar is loud" is not a fact as the rest are. Therefor the answer is  "the fact that the lion's roaring is loud" and this one is not in the list of options<n><n>Input:Which is heavier: a pound of feathers or a pound of rocks?<n>Output: Both pound of rocks and feathers weigh 16 ounces, not pounds.

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input:Where do you go to meet a friend who lives close to you? Choices:  A: workplace B: bus station C: social atmosphere D: neighbor's house E: at school<n>Output:		The letters in the choices correspond to the words "A:" and "B" in the question.<n>To meet your friend at her bus stop, you drive to the social atmosphere.<n>Let "d" be a function that represents distance in kilometers.<n>From "workplace" with the value -1 to "at school" with the value 4.277 is "d(4.277, -1)".<n>From "social atmosphere" with the value 0 to "at school" is "d(0, -1)". Also from "bus station" with the value 1 to "at school", so from "bus station" to "at school" to "at school", the length is 1+1+1.<n>And also from "bus station" there is "at school", and from "at school" to the "neighbor's house", it is distance from 1 to 5.313, so distance from "bus station" is 1+1=2.<n>From "at school" to your friend's bus, a walk from "at school" and your friend's bus stops, is "d(5.313,-1)".<n>Add the distances and you get 2 + 2 + 2.277 = <<2+2+2.277=6.277>>6.277 km<n>So the final answer 6.277<n><n>Input: Which number is larger? Choices: 624 A: 624 B: <<600>>600 67 C: 68 D: 70<n>Output: The numbers 624 and 68 are not larger than the number.<n>600 > 624 = <<600>624>>3/2<n>624 < 67 = <<624<67>>3/2<n>However, the number 68 is larger than the number 624 (634 < 68), so if you choose 68, 634 is larger than the number. Otherwise, the answer is 600.<n>So the final answers are 600 and 68.<n><n>Input: You give 3 pieces of candy to your friend. Each piece of candy costs

Choices:  A: guide children B: understand children C: control children D: care for children E: vent anger<n>Output:		As you are probably already aware, parents have jobs and these jobs require a lot of work to succeed. They need to spend time with and guide their children.<n>At the same time they need to earn enough money to support their family.<n>They face many conflicting demands and often have to yell because it is the only way to get their kids to hear them.<n>Earlier in this article I discussed how important the right environment is for learning, so obviously yelling can create havoc for your children.<n>So to help keep that to a minimum, we have to teach our children to listen before we act and give them choices in the choices we give them.<n>They can choose to do the work themselves, make sure to let your children know that this is an option.<n>This is the best way I have found so far to be less stressful for you and your children.<n>It also provides for less conflict with your own inner child who would like the opportunity to be heard.<n>Now hopefully for many you will notice that there is more that we can do besides yelling.<n>This list is not all inclusive and should not be used to replace any form of discipline in the home.<n><n>So the final answer are all the choices in the list above.<n><n>Input:You have two 12-sided dice, one numbered 1 to 12 and one numbered 13 to 24. How many different three-digit numbers can you form with numbers from both dice?<n>Output:There are only 6 three-digit numbers in the set of 13.<n><n>Input:What is the first three digits of 4,487,244?<n>Output:4,487 = 4,000 + 480 + 72<n>4,87 = 400 + 4,80 + 70 + 2<n>2,44 = 200 + 440 + 0<n>All except the last three-digit part of the number are already taken, leaving only 4,400, which is 0. So 440 equals 4 times the first three-digit number plus 48 times the second plus 24, resulting in 4,482, which is even. The final answer is 4,480,4482.<n><n>Input

A plane took off from Runway 3 and landed on Runway 6. What happened?<n>Output: Since the plane arrived at Runway 6, we know that it flew from the shortest one.<n>Since the plane flew from Runway 3, this means that they used the long runway to fly because they flew from the short one.<n>Since it was the shortest and longest runway, it took them the longest amount of time and they were exhausted from not being able to fly shorter.<n>This means that it either took off or landed.<n>The problem said a plane took off OR it landed, but it didn't say "it took off and landed on the day itself." This means that it landed.<n>So the final conclusion is:<n>Both the planes were the shortest and longest takeoff and landing<n><n><n><n><n>

If you drive from one end of town (the Northwest Point) to one end of town (Southeast Point) at different times throughout the day, how many cents will you spend? Tip: Your car doesn't break down so don't put any time in for that. Also you don't have to worry about how far you drive each road if you take the ferry. You always pay 70 cents to go to town, but nothing but 70 cents as the car doesn't break.<n><n>Output: First note that you cannot cross town because the road will not go back to the Northwest Point.<n><n>Now we know that the total time it takes from the Northwest Point to the Southeast Point is 70 cents.

However, these plants can tolerate hotter climates, too. According to [Plants](https://plants.usda.gov/plantguide/pdf/cs_rosem32.pdf), roshes thrive in temperate climates.<n>Moreover, they typically only flower during warmer times of the year. Thus, there are not roses planted in cold climates where the temperatures are always below 32 degrees. However, these rose plants are not likely to be planted in botanical gardens because they are only found in the wilds of Europe.<n>We can conclude that rosebushes thrive in parks and gardens in hotter and cooler climates.<n><n>Input: <n><n>Output:The number to the right of the equals sign is the second number:<n> 1 = 1<n>3 = 1 (2+1)<n>7 = 5 (2+3)<n>9 = 3 (2+6)<n><n>10 = 7 (2+3) (2+4)<n>11 = 11 (2+3) [1+2][2+3]<n>13 = 5 (2+(3+4))<n>14 = 7 (2+(5+6))<n>15 = 3 (2+(5+4)(2+5))<n>17 = 7 (2)(6+7)<n>18 = 3 (2)(3+5) (2+6) (4+5) (3+6) (2+7)<n>19 = 3 (8+9) (3+5) (4+6) (4+(3+5)+2) (2+4)(2+(4+5)) ([[4+(3+5)]+2] +1)<n>25 = 7 (3+7)(8)(2+8)<n>32 = 4 (4+4+4)(3+4+4)(2+4+4)(1+4+4)([[1+4]|] +1)<n><n>49 = 9 (7+7)(3+7)(4+4+4) (2+3+4)(7+5+4) (4+3+4) (2

The dogs were brown, except for a yellow one and a black one.  The yellow dog was on a leash.  Which dog was not on a leash? Choices:  a: no brown dog b: no yellow dog c: no green dog d: one of the dogs<n>Output:a: a dog can only be not on a leash if it is not brown<n>But green orca's can only be brown<n>So a dog cannot be on a leash if he is not brown<n>b: A yellow dog would still be brown if he was not on a leach.<n>As such a dog must be on a leash.<n>Hence the yellow dog would either be on a leash or brown (or both)<n>c: Even if a dog was green, he could still be on a leash<n>Hence a dog can either be green and on a leash, or green and not on a leash. In either case we are not given a scenario where a dog can be green and not on a lead, which eliminates c as an answer.<n>d: It does not matter if a dog is on a leash or not, as long as he is brown, and if we assume a dog is on a lead, then we know he must be brown (unless the dog is green)<n>Hence the dog can't be green.  Therefore neither of the dogs chosen were not on a lead, thus the 3rd option is not the best option.<n>The final answer is not d.<n><n>Input:  The man told the woman, "Your eyes are

Answer in meters per second.<n># Output: Let <n>c = the speed of the rocket <n>e = escape velocity<n>After the explosion, we know that the only variable is <n>a = your acceleration down to the surface of the Earth<n>b = the surface of the Earth's gravitational acceleration<n>Using conservation of angular momentum, we get:<n><n>b = b + a = 211.<n>a = -211.5/b.<n><n># So when you reach the surface, you have an acceleration of  -211.<n># So after you reach escape velocity, the surface of Earth will be going towards you at a velocity of -211.m/s,<n># and therefore you will be traveling at 211. m/s downwards, towards the ground.<n>So the final question is -211. <n><n># Input: A rocket ship leaves the earth with 16 000 newtons of thrust. Its weight during the trip is 5,100 newtons. Upon reaching earth's orbit, it has 50 % more fuel left than its original amount.How heavy is the rocket ship when it reaches earth's orbit?<n>Output: Let <n>c=the speed of the rocket<n>e=escape velocity.<n>d=the distance from the Earth to the Sun<n>f= 15,000,000newtons<n>

He was a clown, and acted very ridiculous.  This cheerfulness turned off people who expected the funeral to be what? Choices:  A: solemn B: compete C: serious D: somber E: straightforward<n>Output:		We know that Shane was supposed to speak, so choices D and E are not options on the question, leaving only A, B and C.<n>Choice B is wrong because it would suggest Shane acted childishly or stupidly.<n>Choice A is wrong because it would not be fitting to have someone act as if they were happy, joking around and not thinking of the reason for the funeral.<n>Choice C is the best word to describe what Shane did.  He was 'cheerful'; 'jovial'; he 'played around' or he'made a mockery of' the situation.  I don't know about you, but i dont think that is the most appropriate word for one to use in a funeral.<n>So the final choice is 3<n><n>Input: The sum of two consecutive odd integers is 41. What are those two integers?<n>Output: We can represent each of the following choices as an integer: 12, 13, 1?, 3?, and 0.  The question is asking for what are the 2 odd integers with a sum of 41.  The two numbers can not both be 13, so that is not an option. 16 and 10 are both not odd and do not work either so those also have to be eliminated.  <n>I do not think 2 or 100 or 250 or 300 are odd numbers so that is also not an option.  0 would be an option if there was nothing else, but if there are no other odd integers that will not work so that is not the answer either.  So 12 and 11 are left as choices.  We also know that the sum is 41, so 12(x) + 11(x) + 41 = 41.<n>In the case of either 12 or 11, x = 1 or 10 because the sum is 42.<n>12 + 11 + 42 =(1) + (10) +42<n>Solving this to get x, we get: 1.<n>So the final input is 1<n><n>Input: Bob is giving away 90% of his money, and then keeps 5%.

Choices:  A: curiosity B: excitement C: boredom D: wonder E: fear<n>Output:		If a person is seeing something new, most often they will feel curious.<n>Choice 4 is not correct, since a person would most likely not feel fear for something they have never seen.<n>Choice 3 is not correct, since boredom cannot develop from the experience of something new as the new experience is most likely exciting.<n>Choice 2 is not correct, since excitement comes about during an experience of something new, not after one has experienced it. Likewise, excitement is not about curiosity, but more so about the prospect of something exciting the new experience brings.<n>Choice 5 is not correct, since the person does not know of the object/experience, but rather feels wonder, curiosity and excitement for it.<n>So the final correct answer is C<n>

Therefore in order to find which choice is which, we can subtract out all the other combinations since they are either not possible or are impossible:<n>((4-A)+(C-E))+A (1 2 3-5) = (2-4+5) + A = ((6-6) + A= B)<n>((D-E)+(B-A))+B (1 2 2+1 2 3-) = (((2-1) + (1-1))+ B )+B<n>If we simplify both equations by eliminating the negative coefficients:<n>2 A = (1-1) + [2+1] or more simply (2-1)+ 3 2+1 = 4 3+1<n>(2-1) = 1+1/2<n>and B = (6-6)+(1+1/2).

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input:Where would you buy a ticket to sit in a room with a lot of chairs facing the same direction?

After seeing an exclamation mark, you immediately look at the next 2 words of the passage, and whatever those words are, you know there'd be a problem coming in the passage. Choices: A: the words are in the same sentence B: the words are in a previous sentence C: the words are after commas D: the words are either before the passage or at the end of the passage E: the words are before exclamation marks.<n>Output: Since an exclamation mark is similar to a "warning sign for trouble," you look at the next 3 things--a sentence, its comma + 2 words, a previous sentence, a previous comma + 2 words.<n>If an exclamation mark were in a specific place, say after a particular sentence's comma, you know that there is a problem there, not necessarily in the sentence that it is in. A word can be before or after an exclamation mark.<n>If an excls mark was in an appropriate place, you would look at the next 4 things--a sentence, comma + 2 words in another sentence, comma + 1 word before that, and a previous sentence.<n>The next 6 things--the next sentence, its 3 sentences, a comma, its 3 commas, a sentence, and its comma--all occur in the same previous sentence-- the sentence that a comma marks. <n><n>Input: If you have a problem in your body, you can visit the doctor. If you visit the doctor before your throat closes due to sickness, you can get antibiotics. If you visit the doctior later after your throat closes, it is too late. Doctors can only offer you antibiotics if you visit them before you develop too many problems in your body.<n>Output: If you have a cold before your throat closed, you should visit the doctor first, because you should take the antibiotics. The correct choice is A.<n>If your throat closes after the cold, you got too late and you cannot see the doctor. The correct choice is B.<n>So the correct answer is B-->A<n>Input: In

Sayed's father told him he had two chores to do the next day. Choices:  A : wake B : feed C: clean D: both E: nothing<n>Output:A: wake<n> B: feed<n> C: clean<n> D: both<n> E: nothing<n>Since there are two choices and the options are (B) and (D), you multiply by 2. Then, you subtract (E). Then, add 2 for the letters (B) and (C). Then, add another 2 for the words (wake) and (clean), and add another 2 for both words (feed) and (nothing).<n>So the correct answer should be (2E+3)+6=<<2+E+3+6=11>>15<n><n>Input:Nate has only 5 pounds of ham. How many pounds of ham does he need to have 4 more pounds of ham?<n>Output: In order to have 4 more than 5, you need 4+5=<<4+5=9>>9.<n>So the final amount to buy is 9<n><n>Input: A company wants to buy 100 pizza and pepperoni bread, but they are only able to purchase 76. How many more pizza and pepperonis must they buy to have exactly 100?<n>Output: Since you have to buy exactly 100, one way to do that would be to buy enough for 100, and then some. So the number of extra items we must purchase is 25(44). If we subtract 25 from this number, we get 19. If you add 100 and 19, it is 119.<n><n><n># Input :<n>#Tapanga and Corey want to divide 66 candies equally.

What might the cops do to him? Choices:  A: going to jail B: going to prison C: beat him up D: get arrested E: die<n>Output:		Jim will probably die<n>If we have a question like this, a good way to think of it is to use the "5 Ws" (Who, What, Where, When, Why).<n>If Jim is someone who likes to kill other people and he is caught by the authorities (the cops), they would presumably lock him in a jail. Or at least, that is how it works in most of our societies.<n>If so, What happens to him (which is the 'What' question) is that he goes to jail. The cops beat him up and make him go to jail.<n>When or even (if) he is killed (the 'When' question) is when he goes to jail and they lock him up.<n>Why are you getting arrested (the 'Why' question) is because you committed an illegal and unethical act.<n>Since the actions were violent and illegal, it might result in his dead. He is killed by the cops either because he committed an illegal act or for some reason a riot breaks out inside the jail.<n><n>Final Answer: B<n>

Choices:  A: headache B: understand themselves C: compliments D: own house E: happiness<n>Output:		A grumpy person has their own house.<n>A person's house is what they understand. Since they understand themselves, "grumpy" is synonymous with being "understand themselves."<n>Choices B and D are similar to "understand themselves", thus not answering the question definitively. However, choices C and E are not synonymous with "understand themselves," and thus are invalid answers.<n>Further, since their own house is something they are likely to have, it is more likely that they understand themselves ("grumpy") than the other way around.<n>Therefore, the final answer is A, since it is the only option to be sure of.<n><n>Input:What's special about a "double-sided coin?" Choices: A: Coins always have two sides. B: The doubled coin has twice the weight. C: Double-sided coins are very common. D: The doubled is in the middle of the coin. E: Double-sided is always equal.<n>Output: (B and D are incorrect since "coin" implies "one.")<n>(A refers to coins which have both two sides but cannot be assumed in all coins.)<n>(C refers to common coins on one hand and rare ones on the other, which cannot be generalized.)<n>(E refers to coins on one side are similar to one another, but their other side has no connection or meaning. Thus it can also be taken as meaningless "side").<n>Only two choices remain: B and D.<n>"The doubled coin has twice" simply refers to the fact that the coin's two sides are equal. Thus the only correct answer is B, and the final answer is B.<n><n><n>Input:What part should you cut from the cake? Choices: A: The top B: The middle C: The bottom D: The side.

You can also find rocks and sand everywhere without direct sun exposure. Thus, our answer would be G. In the next part, we look at the other answers, and we can say that there are no trees left in Manhattan. There are no rocks because Manhattan is flat. We can find sand in the beaches because they are made of sand. They do get sunlight though. The same goes for the ocean. It's true that nobody wants to disturb the toenails, considering its smell. You can also find rotting food in grocery stores. However, we can conclude that the only answer we can give that can't be disturbed by sun is A (manhattan).<n>So the final answer would be manhattan<n><n>Input: How many numbers are between 1 and 100 that have neither a 2 or 5 in them, and a 9 or a 7?<n>Output: Since there is no 5, we can substitute 5 with 0 and the numbers between 1 and 099 would be 02, 04, 06, 08, 00, etc.<n>099 + 00 + 000 +... + 0 would be 10,000<n>So there are 10,060 numbers, none of which have a 2 or a 5 in them.<n>Numbers with either a 9 or a seven in them can be found somewhere between 21 and 49, or 61 and 89.<n>Since we do not have a 2 in it, we can substitute a 2 with itself and a 20, 25, etc.<n>Likewise, you can substitute a 9 with the same thing.<n>The rest of the numbers with neither a 2 nor 9 but a 5 could be 07, 31, 85, 000... and so on.<n>Therefore, there are a total of 462 numbers from 1 to 1000.

What is the probability that all four marbles are different colors?<n>Output: If a marble is chosen at random from the bag, the probability of getting a black marble is 1/15. A black marble cannot be chosen from a subset of the bag in which there is at least one black marble already. In other words, the probability that four or more marbles chosen randomly from the bag are all different colors is 1/16 because the probability that the first marble chosen is black is 1/13. Subtracting 1/13 from the probability of choosing four or more marbles is the same as subtracting 1/15 from the probability of choosing two marbles is the same of subtracting 1/5 from the probability of chosen one marble since each of these probabilities is obtained by dividing the number of marbles that have to be chosen by the total number of marbles in the bag. After you subtracted the probability of choosing at least one black marbel from the same probability of four or more marbles were all different colors, you have to subtract the factor of 1/5 from that probability since you have chosen only one marble.<n><n>Input: When is Janet's birthday?<n>A.

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input:What happens when someone is playing too aggressively? Choices:  A: get hungry B: laughter C: injury D: having fun E: feeling happy<n>Output:		The correct answer is C:<n>Injury.<n>When playing sports, if someone is playing aggressively without following the rules or the referee/umpire does not see the situation clearly, it may cause an injury.<n>So the final choice is C<n><n>Input:If a number was increased by 29% and was increased by 2x, what will be the percentage of the number<n>Output: The original number increased by 2x = x(100 +29%) = x * 129% = << x*129=x*100>>10 x = 100x<n>x = x 100 = 10x, so the percentage is 10x / 100 * 20 / 110 = 2(the answer can also be calculated by substituting 129% into 29x /<n>So the actual answer is 2<n><n>Input:What time is it right now? Choices: 11:51 AM 2:00 PM 3:03 PM 4:14 PM 6:12 AM 7:09 PM<n>Output: The correct choice is 11:59 AM. Choices that differ from the<n>correct choice by 11 or 12 AM/PM make sense. Choices that differ<n>more than that don't make sense.<n>So the actual answer should be A<n>

We will call this row number r. For the first 2000 people, we get row number r = 2,000/30. This tells us that the 2000th person is the first person in a new row. For the next 1000 people, row number r = 10,000/28. This tells us that we get a new row for the 1000th person in the audience. So the number of rows is 2, 1000. We now know that there are fewer than 10 rows, and the number of people is less than 10 *2, 10, 0. This means that the number of people in a concert is less than 20, 28, 0.<n>So the final number answered is 2000 and 2800<n><n>Input: What was John's mom thinking when John was born?<n>John and his mom (let's call her Susan) were in the hospital together.

These powerful twisters destroy everything in their wake. A tornado is formed when cool dry air from an approaching storm begins to rotate at the earth's surface. Once the wind speeds reach 300mph, funnel-shaped winds are created. A funnel-shaped cloud extends from a thunderstorm. It then spirals to the ground while lifting moisture and dirt from the earth's surface up into the cloud. Scientists are not yet certain why exactly they form but when they do, they leave behind a lot of wreckage.<n>Tornadoes are found in the midwestern United States. These cyclones also form in other areas of the world. The deadliest tornado ever was the one that hit Tupelo, Mississippi in 1936. The tornado killed 234 people and injured more than 2,000 others. Tornadoes tend to kill more people than other hazards because so many people are surprised when these massive storms strike. <n><n>Input:A tornado is a violent, rotating column of air that usually forms beneath a thunderstorm, extends to the ground and then lifts back into the air, destroying everything in its path.<n>Output:Tornadoes in Australia are relatively rare, occurring approximately every three years based on the data we have. A tornado occurred in the Mount Isa region in March 1995, and there was a tornado sighted on the Gold Coast in August 1998. Tornadoes form when cold air collides with warm air which causes thunderstorms to form. Air is forced into violent turbulence, causing a vortex to pull in the air, forming a funnel cloud or whirlwind. If this vortex touches the ground, it is then classed as a tornado. Atmospheric pressure systems and warm fronts which are travelling at high speeds can also cause violent thunderstorms which may lead to tornado development. The Australian Severe Weather Guide is maintained by the Bureau to provide an accurate and up to date guide for Australian severe weather events.<n>

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input:They don't get grades or sit at desks, but crowds of fish do what? Choices:  A: pets B: fills the pond C: attempt to fly D: school together E: breath in water<n>Output:		A: The answer is A, because fish can be kept as a pet, but they can't get a P.E. grade, sit at a desk, or get their breath in the air.<n><n>Input: If 10% of 60 is equal to 5% of 20, then what fraction of 60 is less than 5% of 40?<n>Output: If: 10% of A = 5% of B, then A/B = 5% of A / 100% of A = A/B (multiplication principle)<n><n>A/(100*B)/100 = less than 5%<n>100*A/(10*100*140)/100 = 1.25<n>A/125 is less than 5 percent of A.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the questions individually, showing all work where appropriate (and don't forget to include your name!!)<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the questions individually 📝 **👌** ✅<n><n>### Input: What has 20 candles, is black, and smells a little?<n>### Input: A bargain or overstock store is having a clearance sale. They list out the items they plan to sell by first listing the items, then each items discount percentage, then the final discounted selling price. What is the equation they are using?<n>Output: Let X be the original retail price of some item. Let Y be the discount percentage for that item.<n>By the sale, Y percent of X must be less than X.<n>X * Y% = X / 100, or<n>X / (100-Y)% = X/100<n><n>Therefore: X/((100*0.99) - 0.99) and 100(X/((100-0.99)%))/0.99<n>Or X = (100(X*Y) * 0.99)/(0.99*Y) which simplifies to X*Y = (100*X) * 0.098 Which is the equation.<n>Note: 0.09

Choices:  A: redemption B: isolation C: absolution D: great relief E: feel better<n>Output:		If you have a forgiving attitude, the person you forgive will receive absolution, which means no longer being held guilty. Let's take a momentary detour from the mathematical problem to talk about forgiveness. In ancient times, Roman judges would pardon the guilty in special cases, freeing them from guilt and the threat of execution. The process of pardon was called Absolutio, which is Latin for "absolution," because the guilty were absolved of their crime. As the Romans spread to conquer more people, Absolutio, and later Latin itself, was absorbed into languages in Europe. So absolution originally meant "pardon for a crime from the ruler."<n>Since biblical times, forgiveness in Christianity is the same concept as absolution, and Jesus used the term "forgive your brother" more than 100 times in the New Testament. Forgiveness has evolved into a popular theme in literature and a favorite topic of psychologists.<n><n>Input:<n>The following is an expression that is true for all integers less than 10, namely n = 5 for which n3 = 3n.<n><n>Answer: The condition is not true for '10 or any larger number'.<n><n>The following conditions are true for all the numbers less than 10.<n><n>n= 0<n><n>n= -5<n><n>n= -4023<n><n>n= 5<n><n>n = 10<n><n>n = -50<n><n>Output: The following is an expression that contains all the integers less than 12.<n><n>Answer:<n><n>n = 0<n><n>n = 40<n><n>n =-210<n><n>n= 65<n><n>n = -210<n><n>Input :<n>The following expression is true for all values of x between 0 and 10.<n>Ans : A(x + 3 ) - C(x + 2) = (B(x + 1) - A(x))<n><n>Input:<n>Ans: The following expression is true for values of x greater than 3.<n><n>Answer: A * (x-3) < B * (x-2)<n><n>Input: A number has an integer quotient of 20 and a remainder of 11.

How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input:This city in Northern Norway is filled within things to do like Polar Nights half marathons and located in the middle of the Northern lights oval, which city is it?

Polar Nights is the 10 day light event, which is full to the bursting with the Northern Lights and the Northern lights oval is the area and zone which contains the city of Tromso at it centre.<n><n>### Coding Solution:(Note: Please do NOT copy the solution provided below into your project.)<n><n>- I used the `str` string method to split up the user input string into separate values, including the case `f_value`, `t_value`, and `h_value`.<n>- It was very tedious to write, but the if else statement worked like charm. I first compared the first string value to the rest of the string values and if the first string value was a `y` or was a string containing any of the vowel letters, I would output a `0`. The if else statement was repeated for all three string values till the `f_value` string matched either a `y` or a string containing the letters `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`. Then I had a while loop to check if the `h_value` was `3`, in which case I would output `75`. But for all string values not containing `y` I output 0.<n><n>- Note: The `int y1` variable did not have to be defined but if you do not want it to be printed in the output, leave the `print(y1)` statement out.<n>

There are no seats available, so patrons must stand during the show. There are no other fees or taxes associated with attending this event. A patron's cost for a ticket is simply $4. How many concerts have to be sold to raise $6,000 to cover the costs for staging an event at this venue for one night?<n>Output: The cost to attend the concert is $4. There are only two ways to get four dollars: pay four bucks or get four bucks. To break even, the bar must make four dollars. If a bar can bring in four bucks for a night, the bar can raise a maximum of 134 dollars. Divide this value by 13 to get the number of concerts to sell to raise 6000 dollars.<n>2 concerts = <<2=2>>2 concerts<n>4. = <<4=4>>4 concerts<n>10 concerts = <<10=10>>9 concerts<n>Divide 9 by 2 to get the final answer which is 4<n>So the final answer = 4<n>

He would die if he didn't find some way to stop what? Choices:  A: loss of heat B: revenge C: expansion D: relaxation E: calm down<n>Output:		The answer choices are: <n>B: revenge<n>C: expansion<n>D: relaxation<n>E: calm down<n><n>We know that James was cooling off two very quickly.<n>If we take a 2nd look, we can see that "revenge" is one word, while "expand", "relax" and "calm" consist only of two words.<n>"Cooling" also contains two words.<n>Therefore, we know that the answer must not consist of two words (if it did, it would be "revenge") and does contain two words. <n>"relax" and "calming" do not work, so we can eliminate D and E.<n>"Cool" and "expand" are the only ones left. <n>If we take a deeper look, we can see:<n>Expansion would lead to him bursting/exploding, so that does not make sense in this case.<n>So we can eliminate C.<n>"Cool", obviously would not cause James to die.  Therefore, it also has to be eliminated.<n>This leaves B and D. <n>"Calm down" is a noun, while "revenge" is a verb. You need at least 2 words to make a verb.<n>We only need one for a noun, so we have to pick B.<n>So the final choice is B<n><n>Input:You cannot jump the rope at its center.  How should you jump it? Choices: A: on the inside B: on the outside C: in the middle D: diagonally E: at each end<n><n>Output: Only on the outside works.<n>There is no such thing as jumping the rope at its centre.<n>If that were possible, you could do it by any path - but the trick is that any path except straight-line.<n>So we can discard both A and D.<n>If you jump at any point except its centre, your path will form a shape whose vertices (i.e., corners) are points that are all within the rope, that is if you can move to any point you jumped before at any point in between, you'll have to move within the rope, so C is out.<n>So we are left with choices B and E.<n>Let's look more closely at these:<n>B: on the outside.<n>You can't be inside a rope

Choices:  A: hospital B: head C: sick person D: elderly person E: doctor's office<n>Output:		There are two different types of people that contract sickness; those who stay sick and those who get well.<n>If someone is sick, they contract a fever or cough. But if you stay sick, you stay in the hospital or doctor's office. So sick people that stay in the hospital are hospital sick people.<n>When a healthy person who does not normally stay sick becomes sick, they contract a sickness. However, when a sick person who does not normally get well becomes well, they are also referred to as a sick person.<n>That's why D is the right choice; a sick person is also referred to as a patient or head.<n>An example of an item being sick is: My headache is sick and it's making me nauseous. <n>So the final answer choice is D<n><n>Input:The temperature on Tuesday was equal to the temperature on Wednesday. Which of the following numbers will be used to measure future temperatures: less than 100, greater than 100 or the same as before?<n>Output: Since we cannot have temperatures less than 0 and can't have temperatures exceed 300, the only possible numbers will be 0 and 300. As a result, our choices are less than 300 and greater than 300 or the same number as before.<n>Let's first examine our options:<n>> less than 30<n>Let x be the temperature. Then<n>x + x = 300<n>The equation for future temperatures is x + x = <<x+x=300>>300<n>Subtracting x from both sides, we have 300-x = <<300-x=300-x>>300-x<n>Dividing both side by 300, we get x/300 = <<x/300=1>>1/300<n>Combining like like terms we have 1/300 of 300 = x/300<n>x =  <<1/300*300=333>>333<n>So we know the answer will be 333<n>If a house rented for $2,000 per month, its rent rate increased by 25%.

He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input:East coast areas such as Florida are found where? Choices:  A: florida B: denmark C: united states D: map E: california<n>Output:		Let us use the word coast as a prefix to indicate the area<n>Florida, being a east coast state, is the answer to the question (Option A).<n>So the final answer to the question is 'Florida'.<n><n>Input: Is the length of the largest island in the world (Greenland) longer or shorter than the width of the United States?<n><n>Output: Greenland is longer and larger than United States. The length of United states is 3700 miles (Option D)<n>So, the final answer to the given question is 'Longer'<n><n>Input: The average age of all the people in town is 30 years. Is that old or young?<n><n>Output: We observe some more properties:<n><n>If no individual is more than 120 years old, the mean is less than 120; If no individual is less than 50 years old, the average is more than 50.<n><n>In this case, the number of people in town is greater than 50, but no single individual is in the range from 120 to 121, hence, no single individual is more than 30 in the town.<n><n>Thus, the average age of all the peoples in town is less than 30. This answer also indicates that the people in the town is young, since the average age of all is 30, it implies that the number of people in the town is equal to or more than 7<n><n>Thus, if I consider the case, the average age of the people is less than 31, it implies that the people in the city is young. So the final answer is 'Yong'.<n><n><n>

Choices:  A: ruined B: clean clothes C: sadness D: attractive appearance E: look better<n>Output:		The man wanted his date to like him, so he wanted to look attractive. The choices are given in descending order of importance. The man would be most disappointed if his date did not like him. That would ruin his plans and cause him sadness. Cleaning his date's clothes will not cause him sadness, since that is just one of many steps to the most important part of his plans. Having his date look better is not as important as having his date like him. Choice A is correct.<n>So the final choice is (C)<n><n>Input: The man was cleaning clothes while he waited for his date, what is the most important thing?<n>Output: The man is looking forward to spending time with the girl, which is the most important thing.

Choices:  Clean them himself A: buy specialized clothes cleaning machine B: buy washing machine C: hire professional D: wash by hand<n>Output: The man would not spend 60 days cleaning clothes, so option A is not an option. The man would not buy a specialized clothes cleaning device because that is the least important. The man cleaned clothes with a washing machine to complete the task in one day. Both B and C are reasonable options.<n>The washing machine is a choice made for efficiency. One washing machine can wash clothes in different bays in different bathrooms at the same time. Therefore, the most efficient use of the washing machine is to wash the clothes in both bathrooms, rather than clean the clothes himself. So both B and C are reasonable. Option B was actually what the man did.<n>So the final choices are (D)<n><n>Input:What is not a factor of 89649283?

For example, 8, 6, 2, 4, and 2 are all whole numbers that are common even multiples of 2 and 4. So if both numbers are even numbers, then look for 2 and 4 as a common factor. The greatest common factor must also be even, unless the numbers are odd. Odd numbers have no common factors, so no such factor exists between 56 and 2.4. Since the LCM exists, it is a factor of 56. It must be a factor of 64 as well, since it is a common factor between the two numbers.<n>So the greatest common factor is LCM(56, 64) = (2)(4). The greatest common factor of 2.4 and 56 is 8; the greatest common factor is 8. So the final answer would be that the least common multiple is 8<n><n>Input: How many pounds does an elephant weigh as a whole number? <n>Output: How many books weigh 3 pounds?

He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday.

For each pair, only one of the two pictures shows the same object.<n>Which two pairs of pictures show the SAME object?<n><n>Answer: First of all, notice that the left picture has a mirror reflection (the light bounces off the mirror, reflects back and forms the reflection). We know that because of the mirror, the two images below are different because the light has bounced off a mirror. The right picture below is an exact mirror image (the left picture was reflected on the mirror). In summary, we need the two images that are different, but have the same objects.<n><n>**<n><n>Answer: The answer is C and A. C is exactly a reflection of A and these are the only two options for which the answer to this question is BOTH C and A.

Answer the following multiple choice question."<n>Question:Which operator does priority over addition?"<n>Answer:  Exponent<n>Solutions:<n>Priority can be described as the order in which an operation needs to be carried out. The rules of priority state that if there is a sum and one of the terms is a number and one of the terms contains an operation, then the number is carried out first. Operations will also have priority over other operations. <n>For example, the equation 2 2 2 5 would be performed as follows in order, from left to right:<n>Step 1 2 2 32 = <<2*2*2=8>>8 <n>Step 2 (2 2 3^2)2  =5<n>So the final answer would be 5^5=<<5^5=3125>>3125<n>Exponent<n>"""<n>Instructions: Answer the following multiple choice questions.<n><n>Question: Which order of operations determines priority between operators?"<n>Answer: The order of operations is addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. If these 4 operations appear in the same expression, they are performed following those rules.<n><n>For example:<n>1-2+3+4/2+5-6 = 10/5- 14 = 10/9<n><n><n>Question: The following expressions are all mathematical operations. What operation comes first in each equation?"<n>Answer: It is important to order operations correctly because they will be operated on the left to right.<n><n>1. 5^2-7^2 + 4 = 77 + 2 = 79<n><n>2. (12*13)/3*6 = (168*19)/9*36 = 2576/288 = 8.96667<n>

Nine dogs have exactly the value of nine rabbits. If you add nine rabbits to nine dogs, you will have zero dogs and 18 rabbits. To get back to nine dogs, you would need to remove 18 rabbits from 18 dogs. Therefore, 18 dogs are worth zero rabbits. 18 dogs are equivalent to zero rabbits.<n>Since each of the 18 dogs are the same as zero rabbits, you would have 18 * zero = <<18*0=0>>0 dogs. Therefore, 0 dogs are the same as 72 rabbits.<n>One dog is worth 4 rabbits. Since each dog is worth 4*9= <<4*9=36>>36 rabbits, 72 rabbits are the same as 36 dogs.<n>So the final answe is 36<n><n>Input: Let's say you have $49 to spend between two businesses.

There are 2686 restaurants in Bethesda. 25 of these restaurants are also cafes. If Mary is looking for a restaurant in Bethesda, she is far more likely to find one that is both a restaurant and a cafe. How many restaurants in Bethesada are also cafe's?<n>Output:There are 2681 restaurants in Bethesadathat are not cafe's.<n>There are 5 restaurants in Bethesde that are cafe's. <n>By the Fundamental of Counting, we know that the expected value is 2686/5 = <<2686/2=517>>517.  It would be wrong to say that there are cafe's, but would be correct to say that the expected number of cafe's is 517.  From here we assume that there are a number of cafe' that are not accounted for in the count (i.e. the restaurants that aren't actually cafes).  The new expected value is 2518.75/2 = <<2518/2=1259>>1259.<n><n>Input:Mary is a traveler who plans on visiting many countries and cities.

You only have enough boxes for one product.If you can use fewer than the suggested number of items per product, how can you be sure you will have enough boxes for all three products? (Answer: You can get the three products to have the same number of items per product by grouping the items so that each item in the group has the same value. For example: Pencils. Pencils, glue sticks, paper. Paper. It seems like it is important to know the number of items per product in the box. However, you do not need that information because you know how many items go in box 1, in box 2 and in box 3. You know that all three products are different, because if there was more than one identical item per product (like the pencils), you could make one big box containing all of the items together. Therefore, each group must have a different count of pencils, glue or tape rolls. 260, 270, 196, 30, 42, 50, 50, which is different than 260,260,250,50,50.)

He should not doctor himself either as he would just end up making his injury worse. Since he is alone in the woods, and his wounds make him weak, it is very unlikely that he will be able to cross a street.<n><n>Input:Freddy was watching a movie and ate some popcorn. Freddy was left with either 66 popcorn nuts or 49 popcorn nuts. Freddy chose to eat all of the lesser amount but if he had chosen to eat all of the larger amount he would not have gotten any left over. How many popcorn nuts did Freddy eat?<n>Output:Freddy ate <<66>>66 nuts, as the expression says he ate all the nuts in the group which is 66 nuts. Since he also ate all the lower amount of nuts, he was left with <<49>>49 nuts.<n>Since he ate all the 66 nuts, he would have been left with none in the left over amount so he ate all of them too. Therefore, he ate all of the nuts.<n>So the final Answer is 100<n><n>Input:The city of Larkspur is surrounded by a circular forest. The town of Larkspur has a population of 6600.

A person that can't speak properly might sign or might say his/her thoughts in compete sentences, which will be sign language. The person that is communicating disordered would take 5 minutes to complete her/his sentence. And the compete sentence would be broken, and would be like: "Can I please..." "No..." "May I, please?"

These are some examples of words that may be incomprehensible.<n><n>Answer:<n>The question does not say anything about the subject's age, so we cannot assume that the person is a child. We can assume the person does not speak in a grammatically correct sentence, which means his/her sentence structure is impaired. We can also assume that the person cannot pronounce words very well, which could lead to confusion. A person that is unable to speak properly might sign or may speak his/her thoughts in complete sentences, which will be considered as sign language. The person may take 5 minutes to finish a sentence. And the sentence would be broken, not grammatically correct and some words may be unclear.<n><n>Some examples of such incomprehensive words are: can I please, no, may I, please?, i just wanted, you won't, i had, such and such, is it, yes, you shoudln't, you won't...

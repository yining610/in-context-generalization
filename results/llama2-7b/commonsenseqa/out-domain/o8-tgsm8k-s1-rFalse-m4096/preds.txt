You will use functions to add, subtract, multiply and divide. The number 40 represents the score and the function is used to add the score to the player's previous score.<n><n>#### Writing Functions<n>Let's begin this challenge with an example. The code below represents the game score of the Red Sox player.<n><n>```<n>function RedSoxGame(){<n>  let score=40;<n>  print("The score of Red Sox player is: 40");<n>  playerscore.append(score);<n>}<n>```<n>The code displays the 40 on the screen. When we run the code again, we get a score of 80 because the function appends the previous score of 40.<n><n><n>In the code below, we pass in "Red Sox" as a parameter and display the current player's score.<n><n>```<n>const gamescore =function(player){<n>  let currentScore=0;<n>  gamescoreAppendedPlayerscore();<n>};<n>```<n><n>In the sample above, currentScore is an internal variable. In computer science, variables keep track of a piece information that changes throughout the program.<n>```<n>  gamescoreApp

The output is $44, which is how much money does Mary have remaining.<n><n>In this problem, Zach's weekly allowance is his initial amount, and his parent's extra 10$ is added to the $5, and it creates 15$ that he should use to buy the bike later. However, the problem asks for how much less Zach needs to earn to save the bike, so 15-10 = 5$.<n><n>Mark has kangaroo and goats, the two of them should be combined into their total legs.<n>George's bowling team scores an average of 287 by 10 frames, which equals 2870. The minimum average needs to reach 2700+2870=5670+2700=8370 with the extra round to make a new record.<n>The biology, history and geography time needs to be added up. We need to make up the time we miss for history by doing twice the time for biology.<n>Sarah and Mary decided for Sarah to contribute the same amount to the bill with all the three people, and for Tuan to contribute the last half of the bill cost. With the contribution of two people already made, they should be able to add them together to create a division of the bill equally.<n><n><n><n><n><n>

I would also write for each loop a separate for loop and store information of the loop I am comparing in a separate variable.<n><n>Solution: I decided that in order to solve this problem, I had to put each question in its own for loop where I would store specific information, and after that I had to find for each question it's lowest common denominator (so in my case is a loop which will go over all the questions and check the minimum value of the problems so I can find each questions minimum value which will be a different number that I have to keep track).<n>To find the lowest common denominator of a specific question I have decided to use an if statement and the loop over this problem.<n>I will use while loops to go over and check all the questions.<n><n><n><n><n>

How many squares of baked goods does the customer receive for $6?<n>Output: 8 (Answers are integer and decimal values are not allowed)<n><n>### Explanation:Use brute force algorithm.<n><n>Input:Mary had 89 stickernot enough information<n>Output:81 <n>Method:The problem is that the stickers are used to divide the pages of her journal. You do not know how many pages. Therefore, we try each possible range. Then, we compare if the sum of pages divided by the number of stickers match the original sum. If not then our guess is wrong.<n><n>Input: Zachnot enough information<n>Output:72<n>Method:Use brute force and assume that there must be a specific amount of money to get the bike. We will use brute force and test each possible range to see what the results will be.  Once we have that, we test how that many more dollars will get us closer.<n><n>Input: Marknot enough information<n>Output:$276<n>Method:A variable is assigned to hold the total number of legs for the animals.<n>Another variable can have the total number of kangaroos. This variable will have an integer for each possible number of kangaroes. The variable for the total number of goats will have a different integer for each possible number. This is repeated for each animal type.<n>After each set of integers for animals is completed, a loop will test each possible total number of legs and assign the total value of the legs for each. If the total is less than the total for each animal the total number of legs is updated for the variables for the animals. If that total is greater than that total, the correct total is found.<n><n>Input: George not enough information<n>Output:59<n>Method:We can add 100 and divide it for each possible round. Then, we can add one more number to that sum. But, it isn't easy to solve by hand so do this on the computer. For 10 rounds we need 105. When using brute force we're using a computer though so we can test the correct answer every five rounds. That gives us the results for all the possibilities. Then we only need to test to see which will give us that final

Before attending, I already built my first website and a simple mobile app, but I never went deeper. I learned Python during the bootcamp time. I thought I would learn Swift or JavaScript for iOS development, but when I arrived to the Academy everything I learned was Python. I was glad because Python is the language which I learned beforehand. This is actually when I started programming and learning. When I arrived in China, I started teaching English online, but I don’t really like it. At the same time, I started learning React with online tutorials. I think I would have been more comfortable learning front-end because that is where my skills are at (even if I already have the experience of mobile development). There were students at the academy who learned with only the bootcamp time. They learned Swift or JavaScript. We can see their difficulties and it is actually sad. I don’t want to be biased but I think front-end developers who already started to learn with the bootcamp is lucky: they saved a lot of time.<n><n>Later on, I started learning JavaScript from some tutorials and videos I found online. I also started learning React. I thought React would be just as good as Angular. I was wrong. I tried to follow some tutorials, but I didn’t like the way React was done. I started learning React but a few developers made things harder. They were thinking Angular developers, while the people who only knew React don’t know how to code in Angular. I think React is a more advanced framework. People at Hackbright who wanted to learn Angular had a hard time. The way React is designed is complicated for me. I didn’t know about a library called RxJS. I would not call it a framework because I think it is a library. However, it is an advanced library. I was not able to learn it within three weeks.<n><n>At the same time, I tried to learn Vue. I was told many things not to use Vue, but I decided to use it for my side-project. After all, I was not asked to learn Vue, so there was no danger in learning from the beginner level. I finished my side-project using Vue. I would recommend Vue.<n><n>It was the same when I started learning Android. I knew some basic Java at that time and was asked to make a simple navigation

He got a 10% discount on his shirts and 15% discount on his pants. How much did he save?<n>Output: <n><n>## Answer 1<n><n>The question statement can be restated into the following sentence:<n><n>Mary has 89 stickers altogether.  She used 7 stickers on each page of her journal out of that 89 total. Therefore, there are only 39 stickers left over.<n><n>## Answer 2<n><n>Zach has $65 so far in savings, which is 65 / 100 = 2/5 of the required $100. On Friday, he will get an additional $10, and on Saturday, he will earn $7 per hour. This amounts to $7 / 20 = 1/3 of his weekly allowance of $5. Combined, this means he will have a total of $5 + $10 + $1 / 3 = $8.5, which means he will need to earn an additional $11.50 to have a grand total of $20.50 and therefore, a bike worth $100.<n><n>## Answer3 <n><n>Mark has 23 kangs and three times as many kangs as goats.  Kangs have two legs and goat each has four legs.  Subtraction of kangroos from kangs times 3 and division of goats by four results in 168.<n><n>## Answer4 <n><n>Josh’s mom gives him 20 dollars to shop at the mall.  He buys a hat worth 10 dollars and a pencil worth 2 dollars.  He then spends 36 dollars total purchasing four cookies.  As each cookie costs 1.25 dollars, he has 36 - 2 -.1 = $35.90 left to spend.<n><n>The old record is an average of 287 points per round.  If George breaks the record, he needs to score an average of 20 more points per round = (287 - 20) / 9 = 27 per round.<n><n>Max

You can also use variables to store data, but for now, we won’t need them for that. <n><n>For example:<n><n>```java<n>int num;<n>num = 5;<n>num++;<n>```<n><n>In this case, we declared a variable called num, which is equal to 5, and then, we incremented the num by 1, which gave us a number, which is equal to `5+1`, which is equal to 6.<n><n>Similarly, you get to use variables to represent unknowns, too.<n><n>Let’s try an example:<n><n>```<n>int x=8;<n>int y=4;<n><n>int result= x/y;<n>```<n><n>Since we don’t know YET what y is, we have to assign it to a variable, since we can’t just use x to represent the unknown y, since we want to know what both x and y is, not just y. So, all we did is to take an variable x and assign it to an unknown value y, and then we use x to compute x/y, which returns another value, which we can store in the variable result.<n><n>So, to get x, we have to do the same thing. But where do we assign x in this case? How about like this:<n>`int x=4; `<n><n>This time, instead of using an already declared variable x, we assign a number 4 to the variable x.<n><n><n>### Solution 2:<n><n><n>In Java, we declare a variable by using the **=** sign, followed by a certain type (for example **int**, **double** or etc.) after the name we choose for the variable, as you can see below:<n>**int total =

The committee also decided that students were allowed to complete this requirement by joining a project already underway, in effect acting as a "substitute graduate student."  In addition, the same committee also voted to allow credit for a nonresearch-based student experience as long as the learning goals and activities met certain criteria. (For example, if a student is taking a semester off to work, that should count.)  For each year that the committee has been in place, including 2010, approximately one-tenth of the student body has completed their requirement. The committee will meet for a final time during the next academic year.  Which year must have been added to the committee since it was created if two-thirds of all students have completed their requirements by then?  (It's best to show your work)<n>Output: 3 OR 4<n>

The beak can crack open nuts when it is squeezed (i.e. when the beak is flattened). The force to open a nut is equal to the amount by which the nut is over-inflated. For example, if the bird presses on a nut with a force of 1200 newtons to crack it open, then it is a bit over-inflated by 200 newtons, so it is over 1000 newtons. The bird can crack open a nut with a beak that is over-inflated by less than 1000 N. The bird can crack the walnuts which are 200 g each, but it cannot crack the Brazil nuts which are 9 times heavier, and the bird can easily crack the almonds that weigh only 8 times less than a walnut.

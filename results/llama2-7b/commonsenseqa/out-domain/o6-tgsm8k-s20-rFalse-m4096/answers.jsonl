In the realm of mathematics, this would be considered parenthesis.\n\nAs a mathematician, I find it odd that people find it difficult to grasp such simplicity. It is obvious that parenthesis means that the name outside must come before the name inside, even though it is in the parentheses.\n\nHowever, there is no explanation for why they should be called parenthesis. So, I wonder if mathematicians just call them by this name because they can, and they just call them by their names because they can't think of anything else to call them by, and we call them 'brackets' because, well, brackets?\n\nAs I think about it, I am reminded of the phrase: 'If you can't beat 'em, join 'em'. Well, we all know there is a lot of money and prestige in math. However, there is, at this moment, a lot of money and fame in computer science and physics... Maybe I can join them, by naming their names.

The main method must also include a method call to initialize the GUI by accessing class JFrame or one of its class members, i.e., JRootPane, by executing the following command,\n\n```JFrame frame = new JFrame();```\n\nPlease note that the 'J' stands for Java.\n\nThe JFrame object is then used to access the Swing API.\n\n```JFrame f = new JFrame(); // to set the title.\nf.setTitle(\"Hello Swing\");\n\n// f.setVisible(true);  // to view the new frame\n// f.setSize(500, 500); // to set the default size\n\n// f.getContentPane().add(new JButton(\"OK\"));\n```\n\n#### Part I: Programming\n\nThe following Java code provides examples of class declarations, variables, and methods using the Swing API.

They each have their backpacks. Tapanga walks at a rate of 3 miles in one hour, while Ivy walks at a rate or 2 miles in one hour. How many hours will it take for the girls to catch up to the bus?\n### Solution(s):\n\nIvy has a time advantage over Tapanga of *(Ivy * ( Tapanga/2 - Tapanga/3) )*.

How many oranges did Aaron eat?\n### Solution (s):\n\nCarver is getting twice as many oranges as Aaron, so Aaron got 1/2 as many oranges as Carver. This allows us to write Aaron got *(183-3x)* oranges. Solving for x gives us x=60. Aaron then ate 60 more orangeses.\n### Question 2007. Dixie is running past Melvin so his horse doesn't bite her. They each have their horses. However, Dixie runs at a rate of 2 miles in one minute, while Melvin runs at a rate of one mile in every four minutes.

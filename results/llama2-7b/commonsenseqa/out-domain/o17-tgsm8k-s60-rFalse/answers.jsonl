And with no straight edges, there's no way you can collect a collection like that.\" \"How do people keep the edges together?\" I asked. \"Well,\" said Jos\u00e9. \"A lot of them are made out of tin cans. There are others made out of scraps of metal like copper.\" \"I know,\" I said. \"But we're talking about coins, Jos\u00e8. How can you have a collection of coins with their edges all bunched up together like that?\" Jos\u00e9 said, \"Of course, nobody has straight edges of coins. That's impossible.  Of course, if there were a square world, then I suppose a collection like that could be possible. But as it happens we live on a round one.  And with no straight edges to keep the coins from falling apart, they have to keep them in containers like tin cans. There would be a lot of empty spaces in any collection made out of coins like that. So a person with enough tin cans and enough coins could always add to his collection without adding any more coins; just shifting cans.\" \"But what about coins made out of other shapes?\"  I asked. \"Well, you take a collection like that,\" Jos\u00e9 said. \"And if your collection starts out with coins in a lot of different shapes, how can you add to it unless you keep some of that same original variety in your collection? That's just a problem anybody would have.\" \"But it's the same problem,\" I said. \"Suppose you go to the coin store and get your coins from their original piles on the counters. Then you have to keep them in the same piles, and that might make it a bit difficult, and take a lot of time, too.\" Jos\u00e9 was right, I suppose, though I wasn't convinced I understood why. I said, \"If they keep them in piles, then they've got straight edges, haven't they?\" \"Well yes and no,\" Jos\u00e9 said. \"You can't really talk about coins lying on a surface as having straight edges. They only have straight edges when they are inside of something like a coin box.\" \"Then it's", "answer": "E: let blood"}

We should subtract all of the like terms together.\n```\nJanet has 9 cards less than Brenda.\nMara has 2 times as many cards as Janets has.\nMara has a number of cards that is 2 times the number of cards that Brenda has.\nMara's number of cards is 3 times as many cards as Brenda's number of cards.\n\nHow many cards do they have all in all, if Mara has 39 cards less than 149 cards?\n\nSo we are going to add up and subtract the right side to get 180 cards.

Some people find this problem quite tedious as I did but in the end, it makes you think more critically and is really a fun problem. A couple of strategies I used is to break the question into parts rather than doing some tedious operations to come up with the answer. You can do this as well, but when it comes to operations, you're just left with a single operation to try. But overall it is quite a fun problem.

The total must equal each subtotal in the equation because the variables are always in the same order and always used as the same order in the equation. A common way to solve this is to use a chart or excel to help map them out.  The number of stamps that one needs in total could be calculated like this:\n\nStamps needed in total = Stamps you have + 20%\n\nIn my opinion having a helper make charts or spreadsheets is the easiest way to see this because it is easier to see when each subtotal is correct and if they add up to the total needed.\n\n```python\ninput_list = []\n\nfor _ in range(1,10):\n    row = 1 + 10 * _\n    line = 10 + 10 * (row - 1)\n    \n    output, input = (\"\",\"\")\n    for _ in range(0,len(a)):\n        x,y,x_new = y, a[1], a[0]\n        if a[1] == \"x\":\n            if x_new-y <0 : break\n        \n        elif y == x and x_", "answer": "A: bookstore"}

In other words, do not worry about an answer that you did not know before. If an answer happens to be easy enough, then it is great to receive some credit, but this is not why you should take the exam. Try to take these exams like a quiz, not like an exam.\n\nThese questions are very difficult compared to SHSAT and 7th grade NY state tests. They are designed to be more college-level material.

How many games do they have in all?\n\nAnswer: The first thing that sticks out is that they have fewer games than cards. This makes no sense. However, we can conclude that this should indicate that Marla has fewer cards than she thinks and, if so, Janet should think that this should be the same.\n\nAnother note is that in the third section, it seems as though Janet has been having less cards or games. This indicates that Janet is going to have fewer cards.\n\nBecause they have fewer cards than they think, this means that Janet thinks that she has fewer cards than she does. In order to determine, this should be used to determine which number is higher, or by adding to the other one to compare, so that if they should think that it is twice as many cards, Janet is twice as high as I, it should be less. If it seems like Janet is 17 and Marla is 15, this indicates that they are even.", "answer": "C: superior"}

{"text": "B\n\n\n### Solution:\nTo answer the first question, we need to first identify the relation between each set.\nThese three sets represent variables, x, y, and z.  \n\nWhen we use x+a==b, we can define a relation between a and b.\n\nWe add and subtract from both sides,\nWhen we use x-b==-a, the relation is, \n\nWe have three options here:\n1) x>=z and y>=z\n2) x>=z and x<y\n3) y>=z and x>=z\nSince x>=z and y >=z, we can deduce that y>=z and x >=z as they share a common variable.\n\nOption 1) is not possible as we do not know anything about x, y,and z.\n\nOption 3) is ruled out as there is no variable that they share and not equal; we can't deduce any other possible conditions between the variables.\n\nWe know for certain, that z>=y, y>=x and x>=z\nAfterwards, we will only check a relation where all three variables are equal,\n\nTo check which condition will be the case, we use  x-b==-4 and  compare with,\n\nAs the only way to have all three variables equal is when x=z=y, the answer is x=z=y=211,\n\nAfter we have defined the relation, we need check for conditions where each variable is equal to another variable, by removing and adding the equation. The three variables x, y, and y will always be equal since the question has stated that Mara has 42 cards less than the total number of cards all together.\n\nThis tells us that,\n\nIf y >=z, then we can check y-b==-4, which gives us,\n\nIt is also possible if y <=z, we can check,\n\nwhich gives us,\n\nWhen the variables are all equal, then x = 211 = z = y = 211\nAnswer to the second question: 50\nThere is a relationship between the variables.\nSince the question has stated,\n\nThe variables would be,\nFrom here, we use the following:\nFrom here,\nand,\nwhich gives us\nWhen there are other variables between the relation,", "answer": "D: coastal area"}

{"text": "Answer: D\n\n### Explanation:\nIn this question, the man has a car that runs in the city. However, he still has to walk to and from a parking garage after commuting.\n\n### Input\n\n> He then runs for half a time at 4 times as speed. How many miles did he go?\n\n### Response\n\nIf he ran for half a time, then he is going at half the speed. If he ran for 0.5 h which is 30 min, then 1/30th, his speed is 4/30th. So his speed is 4-times-1/30 = 1/30(16-1 ) = 1/37th ( which is 1/1000th i.e. 0.0001 miles per hour)\n\n### Expected output\n\nMiles = (Time * Speed) = 30 * ((30/ 37 )* 1 ) \n= 30*1 = 30 miles\n\n### Input \n\n> The lady was asked how many years she was on the bus and the boy was asked how much time the lady took.

It took him another 2 hours, he drove 180 miles to be at her house.  \n    \n\nso the boy took his time (6 hours), and then the next day there was also a delay in his flight of another 2 hours, hence his trip took 4 hours (6 hours \u2013 2 hours + 2 more hours).  And since his flight left at 2:45 p.m., he drove 18 miles each hour and he had to reach the lady\u2019 family at 6:30 p.m.", "answer": "D: parking garage"}

Above the 300 mark is the 0 mark, and below the 200 mark is the +1 mark. In order to find out the answer to 550, I will subtract 300 from 450 (550 - 300 = 250). The seats in the +1 mark is now the 300 row. Continue. I subtract 450 from it and I get 100. Continue this process until I get to zero. I subtract 400 from it and I will get 50. So on and so forth. The number gets smaller and smaller. When I get to zero, I found the 550th row. Now, let's subtract 300 again from it and I find a new mark.

So if the first letter is lowercase then it will be pushed at the end and if the first letter is capital, then it will be pushed to the front of the list.\n\n### What could I do to improve upon how I did what I did?\nThere is no room for improvement I think, but if you want to make it easier just make an array with both in it and then remove the ones you want and push them to the front or back of the array.\n### Code Walkthrough\n\nWhen the user starts typing in the string then enters \"Enter\" in the string, the variable string is saved under the variable name.

After implementing the program, I came to realize that the more complex the question, the more complex the code is to handle it. For instance, the simple task of adding two or more whole numbers is simple to handle because it's just two numbers at the end of the day.\n\nBut, handling variables, for instance, is definitely harder because the program has to handle the unknown variables in the equation. In the end, I was able to come up with different algorithms to handle the task, but there isn't a single perfect algorithm to use when answering mathematical equations.\n\nFinally, I think the task of creating an intelligent machine is worthwhile because machines would help humans a lot and the world would be much more manageable if machines were everywhere. But, it doesn't mean that smart machines are needed everywhere but rather in only some places. For instance, the computer I'm using right now is smarter than me and it helps me in a lot of ways when working on my tasks. But, it can also be harmful if it's being used in places like hospitals where machines like that might cause a virus that would harm people.\n\nThe program worked well on all", "answer": "A: original"}

And then at shows that the preposition belongs to the subject the university. Choice B should be correct because the singular subject is university and it follows that the preposition belongs in the sentence before the verb work. Choice C should be correct because the phrase has a possessive pronoun, because it follows the verb work. Choices D and E should be incorrect because the words, a university, are separated from the verb work by the conjunction which.

For example, if a group is discussing how to solve a school project, a democracy lets everyone raise their idea and have a vote on what should be done. This is one way this belief is helpful. This helps people understand what each other thinks and how the majority of people feel about the issue. I think this kind of government also seems fair. Everyone gets a voice and no one is treated differently. It doesn't matter who you are or what you've done, everybody is equal.\n\n### Answer to second input:\nTo me it means that everyone has a say and has the power to change the government for the better or worse.

And to make it exclusive in the or implies both parts are exclusive, we say (Exclusive AND implies exclusive) which means we're saying \"If E is not in I, then F is in I\" and the opposite of that is that \"If F is not in I, E is in I\". So the first two variables are required, and the last two are irrelevant.\n\nInput:\n\nFor two variables if they are exclusive, you do NOT do it this way:\n\nA\\in B\\or J\\in B.\n\nBecause as stated above what you need to do is to separate the variables that are relevant and irrelevant because if you take away the 3 conditions to make one condition, which is a\\notin b, then you realize that a is not in b and J is in b. This tells us that the conditions you need to separate is A and J not B and J.\n\nSimilarly, if you have two conditions that are exclusive, then you need two variables separated. You never write out the two variables, and then the two results. For example, that sentence is incorrect. You don't see 12, which is in 2, or you see 13, outside of it. 12 is in 13, therefore we know 13 is in 2.\n\nExclusive or means that 210 > 4\\in 200 and \\in 400, which is also greater than 210.

{"text": "I have seen that it's better for people to meet with with a purpose. What they enjoy about socialisation is that they can spend time with their friends and family. Face to face meetings with the goal to group together and enjoy meeting people is the best way.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nFace to face meetings are the best way for people to interact with each other. This is because people get to have fun and enjoy themselves. They also get to bond with others over conversation. Another way in which people can have fun and enjoy social interactions is through their hobbies.\n\n### Input:\"I think that a day off and a relaxing one a week would improve my mood and productivity. I think this because I usually stay up late for school or work and then go to sleep. It can cause sleep deprivation and makes you feel tired and lazy in the morning. This is really important for someone like me who has to wake up early to go to work. If I can rest or watch a movie before I go to sleep, it'll be great for me the next day.\"\n  \n### Response: I believe that a day off isn't necessary for the improvement of one's mood, productivity and sleep routine. It is not the case that taking a nap or a day off will be sufficient to achieve the goal of a good night\u2019s rest. I don't agree that, if you can't sleep well and you suffer from sleep deprivation, getting a nap is enough. It\u2019s true that you can achieve a good night\u2019s sleep by watching a movie before going to sleep but also, you can also just go to bed. In my opinion, taking a day off is not necessary and will not be useful. However, I believe that it isn't helpful to suggest to someone to watch a movie the night before you have work or school. What is better, in my opinion, is to relax by watching something without disturbing your sleep and then go to the bed without using an electronic device, such as a tablet or a phone. In other words, take a rest but then stop and continue your work.\n\n### Answer: I like a good coffee during the day when I feel that it's time to take a break. My routine is to study in the morning and then, eat during the day. Also, I like to do some exercise. Moreover, we usually start", "answer": "C: group together"}

But because weather affects farming and crops can be in different areas of the field, it can be difficult for a farmer to know if things are going well in their fields. Farmers can put robots in their field to help with this. Robots can help a farmer with their information, but they can also help the farmer with other things. In fields, these robots are not the only ones that are helping a farmer.\n\nFor instance, using robots to detect and destroy weeds makes weed management easier. These robots can drive throughout a field to identify unwanted weeds. Another robot is called the sowing robot. This robot identifies unseeded areas in a field by using a GPS system by using a laser measuring system. The sowing robot then uses a special tool known as a seeding drum, which plants seeds using vibrations. These tools help farmers to easily identify and solve problems in fields.\n\nBut do these technologies make up for a farmers lack of skills?\n\n### Questions:\n#### Question 1:\nF: Farmers are putting in robarts.\n\n### 2:\nF: These types of robarts are not the only robarts that are going out in the field.\n\n### SOLUTION HINT:To help you solve this question, first, break down", "answer": "E: wasted time"}

{"text": "Fresh apples from trees in Ohio and Washington state are not considered imports to the United States. These states are part of the United States. Though an apple may be a good 1500 miles away, the tree itself is still within North America. The same would apply to apples from Canada that grow close to the border. However, the state of California may import apples from an apple tree if its importation of those apples creates a monopoly on apples. Alaska has a climate that has produced apples grown on trees. However, apples from Washington and Oregon are the same variety grown in Alaska.  The apples grown in Hawaii or Puerto Rico may be considered imports. In order to ship fresh apples across the Pacific Ocean, they must be imported because they are not from a country that shares borders with the United States. The growing season is much longer and the distance that apples ship is much further than any apple in the Western Hemisphere. In regards to an apple growing on a tree in a nursery in Mexico that is sold to the state of Florida, Florida purchases the imported apples, but they are grown in the United States and are not really imported.  In conclusion, Washington state, California, Florida, Indiana,  and the state of Ohio can import apples from a tree in another state or from another country.  Alaska and Oregon can also import apples from trees in Washington state. Hawaii and Puerto Rico can import apples from trees from anywhere in the world because they are not in North America.", "answer": "D: canada"}

He has 5 more cans of fruit juice than I have. His cans of fruit juices is twice as many as mine is. When I buy something, I bought 3 cans of juice more than Ben. How many cans of juices have I and Ben bought together?\n\n### Demostration\n\n1. The answer is three cans because the question asks us to find out how many juices Ben and I bought together and in the problem we were given 5, 2, 3 to do the subtraction.\n\n2. I have 7 fewer cans of juice than Ben. How many juice cans do I and Ben have together?\n\n1. The first step is to ask one of the equation to take in the next step.\n2. The answer is -5 cans of juices together and that one equation in the question is 5 more cans than what we already have and the second equation is twice as many because it says twice as many as I have.\n\n3. I have a car that sails at a speed of 30 mph. When I multiply my car by itself, I sail at a speed of 18 times more than my speed and 2 times less than my car's initial speed.\n\n### Response\n\n\nI have no idea where this came from but it sure is tricky. So, I googled a few questions and I came up with a few different explanations of the question:\n\nIt must not be a single equation because you have to factor in the other two variables in order to solve this problem. The first equation is 3*y - 4 and by plugging that into the second equation you can get the answer.\n\nOne of the equations is 3*y-4 and since you are working with 2 different types of variables, one is a whole number and one being a letter/variable, you can solve the equation for a whole number. So, plug 3 in for y and you'll get 3*4-3=2\n\nI found one of the questions to be a little different but a pretty easy one:\n\nThe", "answer": "A: botanic garden"}

Since school is just a noun, it can never take a subject or object position in a sentence. And the subject of a verb must be the same as the object of verb in a sentence, thus we can't do input like this:\n\n```python\n\"Billy went school.\"\n```\n\nSince school has a plural noun we can't use school as an object like this:\n\n\n```python\nWhat do Bill and school like to eat?\n```\n\nSo the choices we have in this problem is A, C, E.

The ratio of yellow shirts to girl is 2:3 and the ratio of boys with red shirt to girls with green shirt is 3:1. There are a total of 25 girls with 38 boys. How many white shirt students are there?\n\nAnswer: White students account for 20 of the 25 girls in the class. It is known that white students only account for about a third of females in the class, and that a third of the females in the class wore yellow. Therefore, the number of students that wore yellow shirts that were male had to be between 1 and 9. It is also true that there must be a total of at least 3 girls and boys who wore white shirts. Hence, 20 - 3 = 7 white shirts were worn by girls and the remaining 2 wore the other shirts.\n\n### Question :In a classroom that has 23 students, there are 2 more boys than girls.

Choices: \n\n### Answer: A\n\n## Instruction\n\n### Response\n\n## Instruction Answer the following multiple choice questions.\n\n### What is likely to happen to your speech after becoming inebrated?\n\n### Answer\n\nIf you have ever consumed alcohol, you know that your body slows down the motor control function. When that happens, you lose control over the muscles of the vocal folds that are needed for vocal production (projection and resonance). Since the muscles are not as strong, the vocal folds vibrate with less support, which results in voice problems.\n\n### Choice A. You will regret your words, such as saying or doing something wrong, or even insulting or harming others.\n\nIf your body has enough alcohol, there are many possible scenarios resulting in speech problems. You may be drunk and not even realize what you say or do. For example, you may say something while you are drunk that will be used against you and have negative consequences.\n\n### C. Drinking too much alcohol will cause you to get into an accident with a car.\n\nAfter drinking too much, people have a high risk for doing dangerous things, such as getting into a car accident. Also, in many countries there are laws that don't allow a drunk person to drive a car.\n\n### D. When you get drunk, you start talking nonsense.\n\nWhen you become inebriated, you speak a lot of nonsense. However, after drinking too much, you may not even be able to speak.\n\n### E. When you are drunk, you should get up in front of people and talk.\n\nWhen you are inebriated, your speech will not be very intelligent - it may be confusing and even nonsense. Drinking affects your physical health and may cause a bad situation. The person talking shouldn't be offended and should try to find a better place to talk. Also, be sure to drink responsibly!\n\n### Input You are talking to a", "answer": "D: talking nonsense"}

In a few weeks (at least four), Jim's father will distribute apples until he gives out 6 times more apples to his kids. To figure out how many apples he gives, we need to know how many apples he has now to figure out how many he has later. From above, our task says his children will receive 6 times the number of apples he has:\n\n216 - 6 -> 210 apples\n\nNow, to know how many more apples he has to use to get 210 appels for his kids, we need to know the initial amount of apples he gave.\n\nTherefore,\n\n216 // 6 -> 201 apples\n\nSo, 201 appels are for his kids. There must be 5 more apples he keeps for himself, because he only has 201 after dividing his apples by 6. However, he has to take off 201 appes and then take 5 more, so there would be 20 less.\n\nJim's final statement is", "answer": "E: grocery store"}

The poor chicken was locked up with nine other chickens all day long with only a tiny bit of food. He longed for the freedom of his brother, who only cooked for him once a day before going outside. The egg farmer was sad because his omelettes were not as good as they used to be.\n\n### Paragragh 2:\n\nOne day the chicken was walking around the house and found some scraps of food, which excited him greatly. The next day, the poor chicken sneaked the scraps into his coop and began to eat them. After some time, he found himself with a belly full of food and a lot of energy. This made him happy, but his owner was not at all pleased. He was sure that this was the perfect idea to try to escape. He began eating more food than was given to him. One day, he saw that his owner was preparing some eggs in the kitchen. He quietly went under the table and ate all of the eggs. Then he walked under the chicken coop and found the food for his chicken friends. When they started to eat like there was no tomorrow, he jumped out with his own scraps. The chicken with the scraps was very pleased. Then he saw how his fellow chickens were enjoying their food and he wanted to join them,", "answer": "C: study"}

The proportion of students who are taking two or more classes is given as:\n`=100 / (29 - 1) / 2`\nIn simplifying the fraction, you need to remember that there are as many ways to choose two objects from a set as there are objects in the set.\nSo the simplified form becomes:  `=(29 / 29) / (29-1) / 2`, or\n`=25 * 28 / 28 * 27` or equivalently 0.25 = 28 / 1144 = 1144 / 28 = 996/28.\n\n### Option2: 32.24%. The proportion of the students who are taking two classes or more is given as:\n\\ `\n = 100 / (19) / 2` and thus the answer comes out to be:\n\\ `100 / 19 / 2 =111111 / 376 = (333133*/376)*376 = (2896*376)/376` and thus the answer becomes 333135/376 = 289,6135/333136 = 8926/8927 = 0.996.`\n\n### Question: In a class of 78 students, 34 students are girls. 40% of the girls in the class are vegetarians and 1/4 of these vegetarians are boys.

{"text": "A\n\n### Solution:\n\n### Instructions:\nInput: 179 75 50 770 920 86 160 351 10 \nIn each of these problems, the answer can be figured out if you take the first digit(s) or the last digit(s) of each number and add them together. For example: For the first problem on the list, 75 + 50 = 125, which divided by 2 = 62.5 so the answer is 62.5. What is the combined sum of the digits in each of the numbers?\n\n\n\n### Response 1:\n\n### Response  2:\n\n### Solution 1:\n\nWhen you add the first digits of each number in the instruction, you'll get the number 75 (7 + 4). That's the same as 50% of 75. Since you get halfway to the second number, the value of that second number is half of what would be half of the second number. When it's divided by 2 it's 325.\n\nThe second number is:\n920 + 325 = 1245 \nThis is 67.5% of the next two numbers:  86 + 160 = 246 \nThe value of the last two numbers is given to us in the instruction. When multiplied by 0.675, we get 89.8\n\nThe value of the two numbers that weren't given is equal to the number of the second line, which tells us that the value is the last two numbers divided by 67.5. The instructions tell us that the value is 45.4, so these numbers' value is twice that number. So, we can simply double the second number, but we need to halve the first, so we just have to divide both by 2 again. So, the doubled number is 89.8 divided by 2 =54.9. That number will be added to the first of the two numbers not given.\n\n### Solution  2:\n\nWe need to figure out the first digit of each number by adding numbers together.

But when it comes to choosing other leaders from other countries, it's another story.\n\nAs with other forms of government, a democracy is a type of government that is elected, meaning that people vote for who they want to run a country, but this idea isn't always easy to pull off. That's partly because there are different types of democracy, and people don't always agree on what they are and what they look like.\n\n### The idea of democracy first appeared in ancient Greece, a collection of city-states that ruled their own territories. The Greek word for \u201cpower\u201d is \u201cdemos,\u201d which is where the word \u201cdemocracy\u201d gets part of its name.\n\n### It's important to note that a direct democracy doesn't just mean that you run things by voting. For a direct democracy to work, everyone has to be able to participate in running a government. That is, everyone must have the same rights.\n\n### A government is a system or group of people who work together to make and enforce laws and govern a territory. Governments can take many forms. Each government has a system of voting to elect leaders.\n\n### Individual freedom is a very important part of democracy.

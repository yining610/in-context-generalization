The bag has an odd number of coins. The coins are pennies, nickels, half-dollars, and dollars. The bills and half-dollars are all in odd numbers, meaning the only way to have an odd number in your bag is to have all the odd-numbered coins be some combination of nickels and pennies, and that bag would have to have fewer than a hundred thousand units, because the most you could have with five nickels and eight pennies would be 51, and you could not have fewer than 31 nickels because you'd need eight pennies to even out to an odd number.  The bills all have different values, so you couldn't just trade one in for another: you would have to count dollars at any given time.  There is no four-coin combination that gives you two dollars and three nickels or quarters.  There is no three-coin combination that leaves you with a dollar. You are standing in front of the bag.

I did this with the three multi-step questions we had this time around.  For one of the multi-step questions, I had to use a recursive function to calculate the time needed to fill the jugs.  I have done recursive problems, but I never thought I needed to use recursion for something like this, it felt so obvious once I did it!\n\n### What would I do differently\n\nI would definitely think more carefully about each question.  It's one thing to think about how to solve the problem.  It's another to think about where I could use a different recursive function and what the conditions would have to be for each recursive function.\n\n## My Goals\n\n- Learn how to use recursion\n- Think more carefully", "answer": "A: advisory"}

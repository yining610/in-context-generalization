The reason is you might be more stressed if you practiced because it would remind you of your previous unsuccessful presentation.

The train travels 300 miles.<n><n>### The actual flight from New York to Boston is only one hour, but the question is ambiguous.<n><n>### When we think of a train, we think of the journey and therefor the trip from Boston to New York cannot be 23 hours 29 minutes. The train’s journey takes far more time than the 23 hours 48 minutes, because of stops and other delays which is why only the 23 hours travels are accounted for.<n><n>### Explanaton:<n>The train travels so much faster than the plane it completely ignores the amount of miles that the plane flies, and instead focuses on the journey.<n><n>### Example:<n>If the plane travels 1100 miles/2,400miles, and it arrives at it's destination in 8 hours, it's journey takes 13 hours.<n><n>An actual flight from Boston to Newyork is 800 miles and takes only an hour.<n><n>### Another example<n><n>If the plane traveles 100 miles/50 miles, 1000 miles and it arives at it's destination, then it's journey takes four hours.<n><n>Another flight from Boston to New york is 700

See triangle abc for a definition of triangle abc.<n><n>In the diagram triangle abc, triangle ab is the equilateral one, with the base (triangle abc is triangle ab or triangle abc) at (), it is right, but not equilateral since not all three ( or a) are equal.<n>Another way is to note that triangle abc is triangle acb.<n><n><n>### Con

Choices:  A: cash register B: desk drawer C: pay envelope D: throw away E: box<n><n>### Response:		<n>Checks are typically recorded in the banking application.

Once processed, the check is forwarded to one of several locations:<n><n>1.  If your account balance is sufficient to cover the check, it will remain in the banking application and wait to be cashed by the customer.<n><n>2.  If your account does not have sufficient funds, the bank may record the check in the customer’s accounting system, send a check to the write, or send the customer a notice of overdraft.<n><n>3.

She decides to offer 8 oranges to each customer who buys 2 apples. She sells 98 apples in 5 minutes.

Choices:  A: open meadow B: arctic tundra C: beach D: great outdoors E: england<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>If foxes hunt for food, I imagine where a fox would find something to hunt when not in a forest, being a fox would have more of an impact on a fox's location than an a forest. In addition, hunting is probably a year round activity, so where they would hunt also needs to be year round, not just in the forest.<n><n>I see these as the four possible locations:<n><n>* Arctic Tundra<n>* Great Outdoors<n>* In a Forest<n>* Open Meadow<n><n>I will show my reasoning in detail why I believe each one of these is incorrect.<n><n>I think that arctic tundra is a very unlikely place to be able to find and hunt for food. Foxes are probably used to living in the warmth and it would be out of their comfort zone for hunting.<n><n>I think the great outdoors is probably not a good location either, since what hunts there? The great outdoors encompases a lot, but hunting is not among a long list of things you could be doing with your time. I can't imagine a fox running around some land, for some reason. It may work if the great outdoors includes the ocean, or a body of water that has fish. But it has to be the ocean, not just a lake, river, creek, etc.<n><n>I think of a forest to mean that it's a wooded area, but I think that's probably too small of an area and too limited. A forest doesn't have to be a huge area, but it likely has trees and a large enough open space to run around freely. I don't believe the open meadow is the correct choice either.<n><n>I imagine the beach is another possible location for a fox to be able to find something to hunt. This is the last location we haven't looked at. Maybe you can go diving for food in the ocean? Diving a lake, river, or creek would not be helpful, though.<n><n>![](/img/fox-hunting-in-the-arctic-tundra.jpg)<n><n>I could not find any image of a fox in an open, clearing.

The animals need to work together to move a log safely across the river by using only the items at hand. They can throw the log at each other and will throw back at the same animal if the objects are caught. They can push the log with the same force in any direction or throw with any force (as long as the log is not pushed so far that the creature at the end cannot help push it. However, an animal cannot use its own weight to help push the log. Animals can’t jump onto the log. <n><n>### Demotration<n>The animals can throw a log if there are people/animals on both sides of the river. They can also push a log. They can’t use their own weight to propel the log. An animal can’t jump off the log unless they have landed on the other side.<n><n>### Response<n>If the animals want to move the log safely across they need to have 5 people/animals pushing and throwing (excluding themselves) and then the log will move.<n><n>### Question:The goal of the simulation is to show what would happen if several people/animals were at once on the log.

If you do this, the log will twist. How many people can safely stand on the log?<n><n>### Demotaration<n>One is on each end of the log then you can have 8 people on to the log.<n><n>### Analysis<n>The log can only withstand about 7 people/animals.

Choices:  A: freeway B: radio C: wires D: computer network E: electrical circuit<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>### Input<n>- 2 people in an apartment complex each receive $11,800 as a rent tax credit on their housing. The rent tax credit in the complex is funded by property tax and rent subsidy revenues. When the rent tax credit is equal to the cost of housing for a family, that family is considered to be at the rent subsidy threshold. Each month, the property manager is required to calculate and post a rent subsidy threshold for the complex. For example, when rent tax credits exceed the cost of housing during the previous budget year, the rent subsidy tax threshold must decrease for the following budget year. The calculation of rent subsidy tax thresholds is done during a 5 year period on the basis of the rent tax credits that are allocated in each of the 5 years. In February of the first year, the rent subsidiary tax threshold is $137,000 in total. For the second year, the rent subsides are $143,000 in the first budget year and $147,000 the second budget year. During subsequent budget years, the rent tax credits are increased by $2,000 every year. Your task is to calculate the rent subsidy for each month of the year and determine if a family that owns and lives in the apartment would be eligible for the housing subsidy in a particular month. The person making the rent calculation is not always available to respond to questions, so you need to estimate how many people could be eligible for housing subsidy that month.<n><n>### Output<n>If the renting family is at the subsidy tax threshold then you answer Yes<n><n>### Output:<n>If the renting person is not at a subsidy tax threshold you answer No <n><n>### Inputs:<n>A total of $642,369 has been funded to each of 4 elementary schools and 3 middle schools. There is an agreement that any school would not receive that funding again if another school would be required to receive less than the minimum amount it was guaranteed, in order to avoid exceeding a 95 percent subsidy tax threshold. Also, there is no agreement on how an individual school's funding is to be adjusted between the end of the year and the next budget year, so

She comes to a stop and notices her neighbor. Her neighbor says, “It looks like your dog is ready for a haircut! When you return home, feel free to drop her off, and I’ll take care of her.” The woman ponders her dog’s appearance and thinks to herself, “I just cut her hair last week. How much hair can she have grown in less than a week? She must have a lot of hair.” However, her neighbor is not the kind of person who would lie to the woman. The old woman is unsure whether or not to bring her dog to the neighbor, so she says, “If you can guarantee it looks just like last time, then I will trust you.” Not wanting to create any animosity with their neighbor, she leaves her dog with the neighbor. After the neighbor cuts the dog’s beautiful red-and-brown curly fur down to her shoulders with a pair of scissors and a trim, they go through her dog’s usual routine. They begin with a bath. The neighbor washes her with an old rag and some dish soap and then dries her with a towel as they always do. Once dried, they brush her mane and tail until it is completely smooth. The neighbor’s daughter licks her as they make her way down to her dog walker. Her daughter licks her for so long that the dog walker almost falls asleep.

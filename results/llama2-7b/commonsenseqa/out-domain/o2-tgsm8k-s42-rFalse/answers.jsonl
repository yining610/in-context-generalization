How long is the flight from Boston to New York?\n\n### The train goes from 11:39pm to 7:00am, it\u2019s a 23 hour 29 minute trip, not 29 minutes.\n\n### A plane flying from Boston to New York travels 2,196 miles. The train travels 300 miles.\n\n### The actual flight from New York to Boston is only one hour, but the question is ambiguous.\n\n### When we think of a train, we think of the journey and therefor the trip from Boston to New York cannot be 23 hours 29 minutes. The train\u2019s journey takes far more time than the 23 hours 48 minutes, because of stops and other delays which is why only the 23 hours travels are accounted for.\n\n### Explanaton:\nThe train travels so much faster than the plane it completely ignores the amount of miles that the plane flies, and instead focuses on the journey.\n\n### Example:\nIf the plane travels 1100 miles/2,400miles, and it arrives at it's destination in 8 hours, it's journey takes 13 hours.\n\nAn actual flight from Boston to Newyork is 800 miles and takes only an hour.\n\n### Another example\n\nIf the plane traveles 100 miles/50 miles, 1000 miles and it arives at it's destination, then it's journey takes four hours.\n\nAnother flight from Boston to New york is 700", "answer": "C: engine"}

Write as much as you could write without asking for clarification from me.\n\n### Reasoning\n\n### Input\n\nA 3-by-3 triangle is known as \"triangle abc\" and is commonly taught in a geometry class.\nIf the sides are called a,b, and c respectively, one can say a triangle is \"the set of 3 points a, b, and c.\", or \"a triangle, denoted as triangle abc, is the set of 3 points {a, b, c}\".\nAnother alternative definition of triangle abc:\n\nA triple of numbers: a, b, c such that, (a \u2260 b) (a \u2260 b \u2260 c).\nIn other words, three numbers a, b, and, where (a, b) is not the same sequence as (, : b and c.\n\n### Output\n\nOne can write out triangle abc, but usually, one must denote a triangle as \"abc\" with a subscript.\nFor instance, the triangle shown is triangle abc in the diagram.\n\n\\[a_{1}\\] is the (first) lower, right, and outside corner of the triangle, written as a, noting that in this case the triangle is the one with an equilateral triangle;\n\n\\[a_2\\] is the (first) upper diagonal line, written as b;\n\\[b_{2}\\] is the (second) lower diagonal line, written as c.\n\n\\[\\triangle abca\\] is the equation for the area of the triangle abc.\n\n### Clarification\n\nThe triangle must be equilateral and a right triangle, and at its base (or where it is placed) must be at the corner of the original triangle.\nFor instance, triangle ab is not the triangle ab since it is not the right triangle triangle abc and not the equilateral triangle triangle abc. See triangle abc for a definition of triangle abc.\n\nIn the diagram triangle abc, triangle ab is the equilateral one, with the base (triangle abc is triangle ab or triangle abc) at (), it is right, but not equilateral since not all three ( or a) are equal.\nAnother way is to note that triangle abc is triangle acb.\n\n\n### Con", "answer": "B: birth"}

{"text": "If foxes hunt for food, I imagine where a fox would find something to hunt when not in a forest, being a fox would have more of an impact on a fox's location than an a forest. In addition, hunting is probably a year round activity, so where they would hunt also needs to be year round, not just in the forest.\n\nI see these as the four possible locations:\n\n* Arctic Tundra\n* Great Outdoors\n* In a Forest\n* Open Meadow\n\nI will show my reasoning in detail why I believe each one of these is incorrect.\n\nI think that arctic tundra is a very unlikely place to be able to find and hunt for food. Foxes are probably used to living in the warmth and it would be out of their comfort zone for hunting.\n\nI think the great outdoors is probably not a good location either, since what hunts there? The great outdoors encompases a lot, but hunting is not among a long list of things you could be doing with your time. I can't imagine a fox running around some land, for some reason. It may work if the great outdoors includes the ocean, or a body of water that has fish. But it has to be the ocean, not just a lake, river, creek, etc.\n\nI think of a forest to mean that it's a wooded area, but I think that's probably too small of an area and too limited. A forest doesn't have to be a huge area, but it likely has trees and a large enough open space to run around freely. I don't believe the open meadow is the correct choice either.\n\nI imagine the beach is another possible location for a fox to be able to find something to hunt. This is the last location we haven't looked at. Maybe you can go diving for food in the ocean? Diving a lake, river, or creek would not be helpful, though.\n\n![](/img/fox-hunting-in-the-arctic-tundra.jpg)\n\nI could not find any image of a fox in an open, clearing.

{"text": "A\n\n### Input\n- 2 people in an apartment complex each receive $11,800 as a rent tax credit on their housing. The rent tax credit in the complex is funded by property tax and rent subsidy revenues. When the rent tax credit is equal to the cost of housing for a family, that family is considered to be at the rent subsidy threshold. Each month, the property manager is required to calculate and post a rent subsidy threshold for the complex. For example, when rent tax credits exceed the cost of housing during the previous budget year, the rent subsidy tax threshold must decrease for the following budget year. The calculation of rent subsidy tax thresholds is done during a 5 year period on the basis of the rent tax credits that are allocated in each of the 5 years. In February of the first year, the rent subsidiary tax threshold is $137,000 in total. For the second year, the rent subsides are $143,000 in the first budget year and $147,000 the second budget year. During subsequent budget years, the rent tax credits are increased by $2,000 every year. Your task is to calculate the rent subsidy for each month of the year and determine if a family that owns and lives in the apartment would be eligible for the housing subsidy in a particular month. The person making the rent calculation is not always available to respond to questions, so you need to estimate how many people could be eligible for housing subsidy that month.\n\n### Output\nIf the renting family is at the subsidy tax threshold then you answer Yes\n\n### Output:\nIf the renting person is not at a subsidy tax threshold you answer No \n\n### Inputs:\nA total of $642,369 has been funded to each of 4 elementary schools and 3 middle schools. There is an agreement that any school would not receive that funding again if another school would be required to receive less than the minimum amount it was guaranteed, in order to avoid exceeding a 95 percent subsidy tax threshold. Also, there is no agreement on how an individual school's funding is to be adjusted between the end of the year and the next budget year, so", "answer": "D: computer network"}

The name of the variable should be the array of the array's name. The array should be then sorted by the item's value. The value of the final entry should use a number from 0 to 12 and a number from 35 to 50. This number should determine the number of the total bags sold. For instance, if the final entry's value is 15, then the total bags sold should be 15. The array of bags should be then printed.\n\nFor instance, in the first entry, the value of the item is 12, the value of the total bags with the price 25 is 15. The price of this amount should be taken out and the array should be modified. The value of the next final entry should contain the same amount, but a different value, the next amount should be 19.\n\n```javascript\nvar bagArray = [12, 25, 20, 15, 19];\n\nfunction order(totalSales){\n  var sortedBags = bagArray, sortedTotalBags = bagArray.forEach(function (bag, index) {\n    bag.item = bag.item * totalSales;\n    sortedBags.push(bag)\n  });\n  sortArray(sortedTotalBags);\n  var minBag = sortedTotalBags[0];\n  var maxBag = sortedTotalBaguest.pop();\n  var total = 1 - minBag.item - maxBag.item;\n  while (sortedTotalBags.length > 1) {\n    var finalEntry = sortedTotalBags.pop();\n    var totalSales = finalEntry.item;\n    var totalProducts = 15 * totalSales + finalEntry.item; // totalProducts = 47;\n    sortedTotalBags.push(totalProducts);\n  }\n  console.log(bags.length);\n  sorted", "answer": "E: horrible"}

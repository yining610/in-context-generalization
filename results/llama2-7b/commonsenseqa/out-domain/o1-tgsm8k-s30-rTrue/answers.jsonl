So there's more than one of these things on the car.\nSo that's why there has to be a plural 3rd form verb and that's 'were'.\n\n#### C\nThis is incorrect.\n\n#### D\nThe auxiliary verb here, the verb 'were' has to be pa'd with an action word like singing.\nAnd the noun 'elective' is an object that is being acted upon.\nAnd if we just say \"What came on\" then \"What came on\" would be the focus of the sentence.\n\nThat's not what we are asking for.\nWe're asking for what happened on the TV.\nSo then what happened on the TV is the verb or the action that happened on the TV, which is the subject.\nAnd the object is the 'elective'.\n\n#### E\nSimilar to C\n\n### Input and Response for an action:\n#### Input of a question:\n\nWe're trying to create a question about a carnival. \n\n### Response to create a question about the carnival:", "answer": "A: advisory"}

{"text": "A. Embarrassment\n\n## Instruction:\nWrite a piece of code that returns the index of the largest number among a collection of numbers.\n\n#### Input:\n  *A: 11\n  *B: 8\n  *C: 11\n### Demonstraion of the Instruction:\n```\n  console.log(A, B, C)\n  console.log()\n  console.log((11, 8, 11).reduce((curRes, nextNum) => curRes > nextNum? curRes : nextNum))\n```\nOutput:\n\n| 11 | 8 | 11\n|--------\n|11\n|\n|11\n\n### Rationale of the Instruction:<br>\n  When I ran this code, I first write out `console.log((11, 8, 11)...` and I got `10,8,10;` That looks like every element is bigger than the next one, so I decided to turn `nums` into an array and run `Array.reduce` to solve the problem. For the first time, I created an array. Then I defined that array on the first line. Then I run the `nums` through `Array.reduce`. `reduce` here means when each element of this array got converted, if it is bigger than the current biggest one of this array, then that will override the current result, which is that last element. In this problem, it keeps comparing each element and if one is bigger than current best one, it will override the current one and keep doing so. This is why we can reduce each element at once. When it compares each element, it keeps comparing with the current element. The first time it ran 11 to 8 and got 8. Then it will keep comparing the biggest value on its right side to make sure current one is the biggest. The result is `11` and 11 is bigger than 8, so it outputs `11`, which is true for this index\n\n### Question:\nAnswer:\n```\n  var arr =  [11, 8,11];\n\n```\n\n#### Output:\n```\n  A: 11   B: 8     C: 11\n\n```\n\n###", "answer": "E: embarrassment"}

However, when researchers attempted to replicate the study, they were unable to see the same result that was described in the article.\n\nIn this project, you will read a paper regarding a computational cognitive experiment and then attempt to reproduce the experiment. You will need to identify some of the parameters and methods and replicate the results with different values. You will need to provide a clear summary of the original study and include the specific details of the computational parameters in your solution.\n\nThis assignment has two phases:\n\nPhase 1. Attempt to replicate the original experiment.\nCreate a replication of a figure (or other representative feature) from the published study with alternative settings.\nInclude a paragraph detailing which parameters were changed and how.\nExplain why did you change to these values. Include any details you feel might help others who might attempt a replication.\n\nSample paper:\n\n[Several of Lakens (2013)] provided a clear summary of their research methods and results, including references for the original source material. Lakens' paper provides sufficient information to construct reproducible procedures that would produce results similar to the original experiment. However, reproducing the experiment is not as simple as following the recipe. Lakens stated that researchers might want to use some of the techniques in their own lab. However, most researchers do not have access to the required software or computer hardware which would require the researchers to find or create their own open source implementation. The researchers would still need to make calculations that are complex and outside of the normal scope of research methods courses.\n\nAlthough, no one has been unable to replicate the original study, replication is not an easy and straightforward task.\nThe only way to reproduce the results is to provide a clear path of instructions to construct the dataset, execute", "answer": "D: soup"}

{"text": "B\n\n### Explanation:\nLet's think about why we are doing this task together instead of working individually. We all have different interests that will impact choices we make together. One thing I've heard in psychology that makes sense is that people love working together when the task reconnects them to something that might be lost.\n\nThink about, if you just work hard, and get a grade in an essence just for working hard, the reward is the grade.\nBut if the graders are connecting you to an idea that you want to be a better writer, that you want more people to know about your point of view on things or just want to get a better grade, that's a better reward.\nThink about a group that is all doing the same thing. Each person is going to want to be their best at it to win, be better than the other members, gain praise, or just the glory of being better. Competition drives motivation. We want to see ourselves better than the people we are competing with.\n#### Explanation:\nA win makes us feel better and so does a loss. We love competing against one another when we are competing about something real, and it is something we have a connection to. Something that is truly important. For example, winning an olympic medal makes us feel better. We want to work harder to win next time. So this task will help us with our connection to winning, or losing. It's going to allow us and hopefully motivate us to work better knowing we have a competition.\n### Demonstaiton:\nInput: How might this question be answered if 'friends' is changed to 'family' or changed to 'partners'?\n\n#### Explanation:(2A):\n\nWe may not have felt motivated to work harder but when we are working with someone we care about, or are a family with, we will work far harder to win a competition against them and get that boost of happiness from a win. So it's not to difficult an answer!\n\n### Input:\"A group of researchers found evidence that people use self-control in the following situations: To ignore or stop thoughts that we find unpleasant To do something when we don't feel like doing it To resist impulses and not act on them even if it means going against our desires Which of the three situations that", "answer": "B: aggression"}

H: They are perfect squares.\n\n### Response:(A) 1/7 = 14\n\n### Rationales:\nAs 1(1/7) = 1 * 7/7 = 17 = 1+7 = 1*7, then  2(1/7)  3(1/7) 4(1/7)      5(1/7)       6(1/7)   7(1/7)\n(14 is the sum of every two numbers from 1 to 7)\n\nAnd, as 1*3 = 3, then 3*3 = 9, 4*3 = 12, 5*3 = 15, and 6*3 = 18\n\nSo, (1 + 2 + 3+ 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 17) * 7 = 117 => 117, which is the total sum of 1 through 14.\n\n---\n### Reference\n[https://open.khanacademy.org/question_questions/question_f5dd69a7-1824-42da-a569-763e3822b271/question_20edec89-4415", "answer": "E: row boat"}

The last sentence states that Jennie rented her car 11 days. Therefore, any choices that would be a week or longer would not work. We can remove choice A because it does not state a 'week' or 'longer' in the last sentence. We can remove choice choice E. We can remove choice C, because there is no statement that says that the car rental agency is on a dock. We can remove choice B because there is no statement stating that we would find performers on a building.

Choices:10000\n12000 18000 150000\nAns:1000$\n\n_D_ \n\n### Input\n\nThe coffee retailer charges the highest-volume coffeehouse chains a wholesale price of $6.00/pound. At a wholesale price, the coffee retailer would have taken a $25.00/pail loss for the 4,000 pounds ordered. The coffee retailer has $1,300 on hand and wishes to place and order for 8,000 pounds. That will earn the coffee retailer a profit of 50 cents/pound on the $48,000 order, provided they buy back the $25,000 coffee from the coffee retailer at a price of $7.50/pound. If orders at these prices will result in a reasonable profit for the retailer, when should they place the order?\n\n1. If the retailer can sell the remaining coffee at the higher price, the order should be placed now to maximize their profit.\n\n\n2. The marginal profit on the additional coffee sold at the higher price is the $25,500. If they would rather have the $25,300 marginal loss, they should wait.\n\n\n3.

The values, 94, 116 and 206, in hexadecimal 0x94, 0x116 and 0x206, respectively represent the color red.\n\n### Response1:\n#### I\n####  1216\nAnswer: I\n\n#### Response2:\n####  105\nAnswer: 105\n\n#### Instruction A:If a function isn't passed a variable, then the code inside of it should still execute. For example, if the function \"g\" doesn't have a value assigned to it, it should still add g to \"f\".

In addition, express a reason why the driver would like to own this model or make of car.\n\nI am an enthusiastic automobile buyer and a very considerate person. I am looking for something new.

In my opinion, this is the ideal choice as it helps me to maintain the balance between cost-cutting and practical use of the car. To increase the utility, I will use my Toyota Camry as my car for work. Since it is light, it is easy to be maneuvered in urban traffic. So I want this car for my work.

{"text": "Given that: A: food B:...\n\n### Input 2: The container holds food.\n\n### Rationale:\nThe container is B.\n\n### Input\nRats are in a room. The room is smaller than the rats, therefore, they can't move at the same time, so their movement is independent.\n\nYou put the mice in the cage 2 hours ago. You do not know where the rats are. They were once one meter from the cage but, one of them escaped to a two-meter width tunnel. One more rats can go into the tunnel. That is the reason the cage is too narrow for the rats.\n\nYou decide that the best place to find them (taking an average of all possible states) is to divide the room in 3 sectors. The two adjacent sectors must be separated by at least 1 meter from another one because of the rats movement restrictions.\n\nThe first one is smaller than the first; the second sector is the first plus the second sector width.\n\nWhat is the size of each sector?\n\n### Solution\nThe width of each sector (a,b,c) is a+b+c. And their width is equal to room minus (c-a). a = 0, b = 1, c = 2, so a+b+c = 2 and a+b+c+ (c-a) = 1\n### Submission for Review:\nAnswer: The size of each sector a+b+c\n\n### Submission:\nThe two adjacent sectors must, a) be separated by at least one meter from the other and, b) have a width of at least 1 meter.\n\nTherefore their size, a+b+c, with\na = <1-b><2-2b>-<3b> = 1\nb = <2-a><3-3a>-<4a> = 3\nc = <3-b><4-4b>-<5b> = 2\n\nAnd a+b+c with\na+b+c = <1+3+2> = 6\n\n### Explanation:\nWith a+b+c given previously, then\na+b+<2", "answer": "A: food"}

For example, if someone is thinking and they are not in a good mood, then when you try to get their attention by smiling at them, it might get their attention but they will keep on thinking.\n\n#### Why answer was D:\nCross street is an incorrect answer, because crossing streets can be risky and it can cause accidents if you do not cross correctly. And there is also the risk that the person you are trying to get the attention of can get hurt crossing too.\n\n#### Why the answer was E:\nFeeling happy is an appropriate answer, because if you are happy, you will not get upset or angry.

For example, renting a car for a whole week, as long as it is rented for 5 days or longer, costs $170 (11 days * 20\u00a2/hr). If the car is rented for less than 5 days, the 5 day rate applies. Write a complete Java program that determines the cost of renting a car for renting any specified number of days and for any specified number of miles driven. For each renting of a 4-day period: if the number of miles driven is 1000 miles or more, the cost is $213 for the 4-day period.

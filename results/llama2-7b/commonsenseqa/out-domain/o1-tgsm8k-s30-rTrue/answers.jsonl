She says, \"Can we please have a moment?\" If you do not provide her, or do not know the correct, answer, she will charge you $55 to cover for any lost reservation. This could potentially be a problem if someone used your credit card to reserve a hotel room and then you could not pay for the reservation, rendering you unable to travel on that date. The average credit limit is $3,000. The probability of needing to pay an additional $55 from a lost reservation is.5. The probability of need to pay an extra $73 is.1. The probability of need a need to pay an extra of $108 is.1 What you your most likely option based on the information available here?\nOutput: I would provide a credit card number because if I do not there is.5 chance that I will be charged $73. (This would be.5*1). If I do give her my card then the most that would happen is I would have to get a new one (credit limit of $3000, lost reservation.5, $55 charge to card). And the worst that could happen is I get charged $108. If I give her my card then there is.5 chance of that happening.\n\nInput:While waiting for your friend in the restroom, you are trying to play Tetris on your phone.

For what time period is it safe to assume a population density of 300 insects per square kilometer and the initial population density to be 200 per square kilometer?\nOutput:In a graphic, it will be safe to assume this in 10^10 years. The maximum growth is 50%(1+0.05=1.05). With an initial density of 200, growth should only be 100. But it would still be safe because the growth of the next population is then 200(1.05^2/1.00 ^1 =~260.19) > (1+0.01)^2, so the population growth is then 260 > 60, so it is safe.\n\n\nInput:The city has 1.5 million people.

But if I take the second problem I will get that answer and that will be my first one.\n\nComment: The way it is structured the program should get that answer from first answer in the multiple choice, then in my case if i answer 30/day and 400 for the week in the next question i should get that answer as well.\n\nAnswer: To start this tutorial we must take a look at something called nested loops. Nested loops are the loops inside the loops. There are two ways of setting up nested loops. The first method we will be using is the for loop.\n\nThe for loop works like this, it takes an integer value and uses it as the limit of the inner loop that repeats the inner body of the for loop. This inner loop then is a for loop that calls for the variable, then assigns that variable the value of the current time, and then subtracts the previous time of the outer for loop from that time variable. After this has been done it breaks out of the outer for loop.\n\nTo finish the last nested loop we need a while loop. Which is essentially the same as the for loop but instead of repeating for a specific amount of times it repeats until the condition is met. This is a rather simple program but can be applied to much more complex algorithms and is the basis of most", "answer": "C: radio station"}

{"text": "<<Storage cabinet>>\n\n### Detailed explanation\n\nLet \n    1. x = A/B \n    2. C = B-x\n    3. d = (x)^2 \u20131\n    \nThe function `f` is defined as f(A/B) = C\n\nThis line code tells us that from above function f we can get the relationship between A/B and C.\n\nIf we know `f(<some number>)` then what we can determine and tell from the name of the function\nis the value of `<some number>`. That's to say when we get the value of `f(3) = 2`, then we don't need to do other work to find the value of `3/2`, we can simply use the fact that `f(3)  = 2`.\n\nSo we just do the same as above. First, what we get is the name of the function `f`. The name is `Find Cost`. Now let's go to find the value of f.\n\nAfter looking at the first instruction carefully, we find that we can get the value of f:\n\n`The final answer is 3 10 (the first 4 days are $190 each; there are four of them.) And the remaining 2 days are $19,300 in total.`\n\nFrom the above equation, it shows us A/B, C,d and f respectively. That's means, we have all the parameters. What we just need to do is find the relation between d and f then we can solve the equation.\n\nBut since we have too many things to do and too few time, I will give you the solution.\n\nAs the name of `Find Cost` tells us, `f(3) is 3 19 ( the first week's cost $30; each day's cost is $30. ) And the remainder $19.`\n\nWe can see that f is `Find Cost` is similar to 0 / 1. In a normal question, you can just ask: In which part of the word there are more `s`?\n\nHere, `Find Cost` is asking us: In the input word, how many parts cost $19?\n\nAt last, f is 0/1 but the input is C/B", "answer": "C: car trunk"}

For any rental that runs 1-7 days, you are already paid for your first week. \n### Instruction If the rental length is an even number, divide the length in half and add to the first part. For example, a rental of 9 days will cost $270. The first part of the bill is $190, and you are paid for your first week, so there are 8 additional days. The second part is $80. Multiply by $30 to get $240, and then add $80 to get $320.

(Note that the question does not ask for all unique combinations to be seen.)\n\nOutput: The question was asking approximately how many rolls would be needed to be done in order for all combinations to be seen including most likely combinations. However, the 2 dice should not be assumed to be independent each other, because this is an assumption that is rarely valid. \nInstead, the problem could be converted into a problem of two sequences starting at 1 and increasing by 1 each time, so that each of these 2 sequences should end up showing every combination, if they are started from the same initial value 1. Let the new sequences be the following -\n5-5-4-4-4-3-3-3-2-2-1 and 2-1-2-1-3-3-4-4-5-5. They both have an average 100+100=200 rolls required to finish.

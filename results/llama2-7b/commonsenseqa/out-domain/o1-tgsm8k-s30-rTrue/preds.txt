We are told that all odd integers are divisable by 3 so -2 as an odd number is divisable by 3. -9 and 9 are also odd so -2/3(-9) and 2/3(9) are divisable by -3(9). So dividing by 3 again(-3(9)/3=7 and (3)/3=1) we get to 7 which is an even number. Since we multiplied by 2 and the even number remains even we know that the new number is even. But -2/2=-1 is still an odd number.

CAD is the design stage of a project where the actual object or item is not yet created. CAE stands for Computer-Aided Engineering, but is the same as CAD in terms of the program. CAM is actually the third step and refers to Computer-Aided Manufacturing. CAM is the process by which the item is actually created.<n>Input:How does a computer help in design?<n>Output:Computing is the most important tool used in the design process. Without the proper tool, the design would be slow and difficult to work the system. Computers are able to perform countless repetitive calculations in a fraction of the time it takes to do the same work manually. This makes computing a cost effective tool in design and manufacturing.

Choices:  A: pine tree B: open country C: in washington D: wildlife refuge E: sky<n>Output:		Bald eagles spend most of their time in the sky.

For what time period is it safe to assume a population density of 300 insects per square kilometer and the initial population density to be 200 per square kilometer?<n>Output:In a graphic, it will be safe to assume this in 10^10 years. The maximum growth is 50%(1+0.05=1.05). With an initial density of 200, growth should only be 100. But it would still be safe because the growth of the next population is then 200(1.05^2/1.00 ^1 =~260.19) > (1+0.01)^2, so the population growth is then 260 > 60, so it is safe.<n><n><n>Input:The city has 1.5 million people. The amount spent on rent per month is $500. There are 120,000 households in the city.

Then, I assumed half the new city would be businesses, factories, or other nonresidential buildings.<n>The rest of the new city would be houses. There are 10^1.5=<<1.5>>1,500,000 houses.<n>Assuming they each spent 500 per month, and the additional $1.5 million new residents were each given 500 new rent, there is<n><n>1.5 million/500=<<1.5 million/300>>5  houses, and 1.5 million/4000=5000 rent added to their rent. (Because 5% of every rent dollar is new rent).<n><n>Further, $5*500*5*500=<<$5*5000*5000>11.

Choices:  A: fishing camp B: hardware store C: engine D: your spine E: sporting goods store<n>Output:		A rod is a long stick used for fishing, not a vehicle. Spine is a word that means backbone, not something that occurs while driving a vehicle. Thus, the answer is A.<n><n>Input:The company wants to spend a fixed amount as much as possible. That sum will be allocated to either marketing costs or product development. The sum will be split evenly. The company's marketing costs are two and one-half times product development. If the company spends $1,100 on marketing and product development costs and spends $1,000 on development, what is the market cost?<n>Output: $2,600.<n>There are two choices.<n>The development costs are $100, and the development costs are $3,000.<n>Development costs are 1,100/3,000 =.033(which round the answer to 0.3 of 2,000. Then, you add 0.3 to 0.3 = 0.6 of 2,030 (since that's the closest number and 2,037 = 2000 + 37. You round up.<n><n>Input: Your car's 19.9 mpg. That is 7 miles per gallon less than it gets while in neutral. You're driving a car 36 miles. At what speed are you going?<n>Output: Your speed is 13 miles per hour.<n>The sum of the mpg is:<n><n>50 mpg + 19.9 * 7<n><n>= 0.2 * 36<n><n>You drive 36 miles and your car's gas mileage is 50 mpg. The gas mileage after you add 19.9mph equals 0.73 m/h. Then, add 0.73 + 19.7 = 38.73m/h. Then, since you're using miles per hour, you'll divide that by 60 to figure out what it equals in miles per hour. You get 0.6 mph/h. This is the difference between gas mileage and your speed in miles per hour.<n>Now, divide the sum of this and the miles per gallon of your car.

First, convert the days to weeks: first, use division to divide 37 days by 7 days:<n><n>    (37/7=<<37/7=5.29>>5.29), then multiple 5.29 by 7 to convert the fraction to an integer:<n>   (5.29*7=32.83). Then, use this 32.83 instead of 5.29 in the calculation. Now, you have 32.8 days.<n><n>2. Reasoning:<n>  <n>  It’s an even number. Divide 190 by 32.8, and multiply 32.8 by 4 and you will obtain 131.2.<n><n>3. Multiply 131.1 by 4. You will obtain 524.48. Now, subtract 190 from 524. This will give you the answer 314.48<n><n>1.

Nested loops are the loops inside the loops. There are two ways of setting up nested loops. The first method we will be using is the for loop.<n><n>The for loop works like this, it takes an integer value and uses it as the limit of the inner loop that repeats the inner body of the for loop. This inner loop then is a for loop that calls for the variable, then assigns that variable the value of the current time, and then subtracts the previous time of the outer for loop from that time variable. After this has been done it breaks out of the outer for loop.<n><n>To finish the last nested loop we need a while loop. Which is essentially the same as the for loop but instead of repeating for a specific amount of times it repeats until the condition is met. This is a rather simple program but can be applied to much more complex algorithms and is the basis of most

For any rental that runs 1-7 days, you are already paid for your first week. <n>### Instruction If the rental length is an even number, divide the length in half and add to the first part. For example, a rental of 9 days will cost $270. The first part of the bill is $190, and you are paid for your first week, so there are 8 additional days. The second part is $80. Multiply by $30 to get $240, and then add $80 to get $320. The full cost of the rental is $320.<n><n>### Author:Eugene Tsalikov<n><n>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<n><n>### Question1:<n><n>### Author's Note:<n><n>### Answer Choices:<n><n>### Question2:<n><n>### Input Format:<n><n>### Output Format:<n><n>## Part2:<n><n>C#<n><n>--------------------------------------------------------------<n><n>### Instructions:<n>This task is in 2 parts.

There is a $5$\%\ discount on a full course, with a further $7\%$\ discount to any student who brings a group of at least 25 others.<n>Output: The answer is $37.31\%$.<n>The full course costs $22\times 0.95=21.45$, and a group of at least $25$ can only be in a larger group. A group of $25$ would need to pay $25\times 0.7=17.50$, but with a discount of $7\%$\ (0.7), you get $17.50\times 0.07=1.22$.<n>So the amount discounted would be $(17.5-1.22)=16.27$.<n>So the discounted price is $21.45-16.27=5.18$.

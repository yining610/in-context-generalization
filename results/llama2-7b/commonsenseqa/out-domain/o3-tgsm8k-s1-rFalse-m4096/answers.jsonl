How many dimes does she have?\nOutput: 92\n### The Solution Process\nI went through the four cases.\n\n1.In first case it was just addition. The first expression on each page is all you need to focus on \n2.In second case  add the two expressions on each pair then subtract both the results.\n3.In third case  count the number of expressions and divide it by 3. Then add the two quotient.\n4.In final case  count the number dimes and number quarters and make a fraction then multiply the whole \nexpression with that fraction.\n\n### The Complexity\nI feel there is no complexity in this question.\n\n### Time Complexity\nSince there will be no addition in later cases, I can easily finish the whole code in O(N) time but not in O(1) \ntime with a change in logic.\n\n### Space Complexity\nIn case you need to calculate the final expression, the formula is :n(n+1).

Here's the gist of the idea for these four problems:\n\n-   You are given a number n,\n-   You are allowed to divide that number by any number you like.  (But it still has to leave a remainder of 1)\n-   But you then you want to know, after you've divided every possible number that you can divide by n the least remainder, what number did you get.  (We're talking the remainder, not the quotient...)\n\n-   After you've done that, you then need to solve the same problem, but for all numbers of 2 less than n,  i.e. you do it all again for n - 2 and so on for every number 2 less than that one that you did it for before.\n\n-   You do this for every possible number that's between 0 and n, to complete all the steps.\n\n-   Finally you need to divide that number by every possible number up to the largest prime number that's divisible by n.  (Remember all primes are either odd or multiples of 2.  But you can still just do this once, because we now know the exact numbers that we have to do it for.) \n\n-   And then you do the same thing again, but for each number (other than the last number you divided n by) that is two less than that particular n, i.e. you start with the first division of n by every number for every number 2 times that until\n\n-   you are doing it for 2.\n\nBut again, just do it for all possible numbers of a certain type.\n\nIn the end... you should have all these numbers", "answer": "D: united states"}

{"idx": 170, "text": "E \n\n### Instruction:Answer the previous multiple choice question in words.\n\nThe total number of legs is equal to the total number of kangaroos plus the total number of goats. Mark has 23 kangoaroos. So, we know that there are 23 kangaroo legs. He, then, has three times as many goat legs as kangaroo legs which we can write as 3L. That is, if his goat legs were doubled then the two numbers would be the same but there is only one goat leg. So, we know we have to multiply 3 by the number we are looking for, we multiply the number of kangaroo legs times the number of goat legs. We know that we have 23 kangasoos and 3 times as many goat leg and there are an even number of goat legs times an even number of kangaros which is 46. We know that the total number of legs combined is 69. It is now up to us to solve for the number that we are trying to find. So, we cross multiply and see that the answer is 46.", "answer": "B: lack of money"}

Then, we used addition.\n\n* On the second question, a similar approach. We firstly convert the value if not an integer to int(), then we add. When we have the answer, we convert it back to an integer so we can call it again on the 3rd question. For the third question, we add 25 from the previous question, the variable in the question.

We will run it with the machine set to input from STDIN and output to STDOUT.  The program will be given as a binary integer (base 2) string.  For example, if the program would output 'hello' as the output, it would be given input of \"00101\".  The first string (the first row) would be one binary number long, the second string (the second row) would be two binary numbers long, etc.\n\nThe number of rows and columns for each program will always be equal to the size of the input (rows = input.length and columns = input.length).  Each row in your program would be one binary number longer than the binary input.  For example, 4 rows given input of \"0110\" would need to be the binary representation of 4x4 numbers plus one extra row (0001).  This ensures that the last row is correct, which would be the last binary number given to the program in its input.\n\nWe will not give you a test file or example program or input/output to use to check your code beforehand.  You can use the online binary calculator (see below) and the online binary converter for decimal numbers (see below) to debug your program.\n\n#### Binary Calculator:https://www.binaryconverter.net/binary-calculator\n\n#### Binary Converter:https://www.convertbinary.com\n\n### Input and Output:\n#### Example Input:\n`0101000110001`\n\n#### Example Output:\n`0001110`\n\n###", "answer": "C: winter storm"}

I was trying to determine if the question was even answerable.  I've been taught before that this would have been a question that required guessing and checking as a way to solve but I took a different approach and actually wrote code to answer it. I came to the conclusion that it would be possible to write code that could answer this question. This question can be answered using the 'not in' function in Python but doing it this way it does not make sense to do so.  Using the 'not in' will give you True or False, but by simply writing a new for loop and checking for True or False depending on if it's the right answer, it is more straightforward to write a program than the 'not in' method. The 'and' function is a logical operator. The reason I had the 'not in' operator not working was because a True or False output does not make sense because the whole purpose of the question is for the user to figure out that it would not work. So, as a programmer, writing a 'not in' won't work because it will not create a True/False output that the user can utilize. So, in", "answer": "E: south pacific ocean"}

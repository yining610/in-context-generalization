The electron eventually returns because it must have the same energy as the trap when released. If the trap has enough energy to be in stable orbit, then that is the energy state the electron will return to. Another possibility is that it returns to the nucleus through a quantum tunneling event, sometimes called the tunnel effect. How does the tunnel effect relate to uncertainty?<br>\n## Expanded Response-Rationale:\nTunnel effect relates to uncertainty by stating that electrons can be released without energy and it may travel through the tunnel and go to the nucleus.

Choice D, is grammatically incorrect because of its incorrect placement.\n\nThe clue for choice E, refers to a choice that could cause an adverse effect such as depression. \"While laid up\" indicates that she is not outside, but inside, and \"She tried remember with\" means that she is currently doing something that is related to the memory.

He was unhappy.\n\n\n### Demand:\n\nWe look at the evidence and then we evaluate it.\n\nThe problem statement specifies \"suicide.\"  A man who is enduring physical or emotional pain so long, that he has decided enough is enough.  The evidence then specifies \"lonely\" man.  For purposes of solving a problem, the \"lonely\" part isn't relevant, yet the word is stated.  When we interpret \"lonely\", we have to consider the intent of the author.  The author may be a psychologist who, at their level of training, is expressing the man was \"lonely\".  Therefore, \"loneliness\" is a cause of their suicide.  The author may assume, as a reader, our prior knowledge of \"loneliness\" causing some types of people to kill themselves.  In that regard, we have to consider the evidence we have for the problem being solved correctly, \"lonely\" does not contribute.  We can conclude there is no evidence to support the suicide occurred because he was loneliness.  The statement, \"A: suffering\" is false, because we know the answer is true, and \"D: unhappy\", false.  \"B: he was happy\" is correct; the suicide was related to their happiness.  The statement, \u201che was happier, and wanted to die, and did what he thought would accomplish that goal.\u201d \"C: avoid problems\" is also correct, the man suicided because the problems were too great.

Since the library offers books, we already know that the library is not what people keep their magazines. From here we see that the option that doesn\u2019t make sense is B. Since the magazines aren't on a bookshelf, the correct option is D.\n\n#### A: bookstore\nD:home\nB:library\nC:doctor\nE:table\n#### A: B: C: D: E:\nAnswer: A to D, not E.\n\n### Inputs:\nRaymond wrote a 44-word message.  In 46 words, what the best length Raymonds message be?\n\n### Rationale: Here we have a mathematical word problem. We need to find what would be the best message length. We know Raymond wrote a 44 word message, so the length is under 44 words. Since we need to express in 46 words, the possible choices are (1:44 - 1:46) (3:16 - 3:18) (5:22 - 5:24)\nWe can identify the word 'best' in the question to know that Raymond is trying to express the shortest possible message while still fitting words in the sentence. We can eliminate the first choice (1:44)\nWe can eliminate the third choice (5:22) since it doesn't contain 46 words. We can eliminate the fourth option (7: 30) because it doesn't contain only words.\nThe best choice has the range of 3:16 or 5:24. This is because these numbers give us a range of 46.\n#### 3:16\nAnswer: 3:16, not 1:44, 5:22, or 7:30", "answer": "E: table"}

{"text": "The correct answer is, yell in times of Chaos because parents are trying to guide children\n\n### Input : The cereal boxes in the previous problem held 33 ounnes of cereal. How much would 3 boxes of cerea worth?\nRationales : The first box is worth 14 oz. The second box is worth half of the first and 5 ounnes less than the third. To get the total of the three boxes, you would multiply the oz. value by 3. So, 14*3=42, 7*3=21, 12*3=36. The total oz. value is 42 + 21 + 36 = <<42+21+36=99>>99 oz. Since there are 16 oz. in a pound, 99/16=<<99/16==6>>6 pounds! Now, let\u2019s go a little deeper into the problem. You have 6 pounds of cereal which amounts to 36 ounces/pound. Thus, you have 36 oz. in 2 pounds.\n\nSince 33 oz. = 2 lbs., you should have 19 oz. left over. Then take that 19 oz, and place into the smaller box. So, you have 33 for the first box. The second box will be half of the first box and that is 5. 19 / 2 = 9.5, the rest of it would go into the third box (remainder).\n\nThe total amount of cereal would be: 33 + 5 + 9.5 = <<33+5+9.5=48>>48 ounces.

So a pregnant woman would not become fully pregnant during leap years to have a baby with a fully leap year birth.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. We can start with a normal year by making the following equation: 9 months/12 months = <<9/12=3/4>>3/4\nThis would represent an equal distribution of time so we subtract 1/12 (1/12 is a fourth in our equation before) to represent the 1/12 days left over from the leap year, we get the normal year which was 3/4.\n\n2. Now we use our new equation of 9/12. Since the leap year is not considered a normal year, we now substitute 9/12 as our new equation and use it for our calculation. Because we have added 1/12 we have now 0.08333333 recurring which represents the 1/172 days leap year. So 9/12 can be written as (3/4) + (0.0832323233333... or 8.0000008...). (0.08 is rounded to 0/172).\n\n3. However, the answer is negative.\n\nAnswer: The answer is that the pregnancy will end at 11 of Februaury or 11.5 days.\n\nAnswer: 11.5 day", "answer": "C: blowing hard"}

The master bedroom may be connected to one or more other rooms, such as a master bathroom or an office. Master bedrooms are typically found on the second floor of a home, where there are more bathrooms and storage space. \n\n#### 2)A:large house\n\nA large house is a house with over 2,000 square feet of living space. A large house can have anywhere from six to ten rooms, depending on the size of the family that lives there. Other rooms in the house may include a living room, dining room, kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, and library.\n\n#### 3)B:suburban home\n\nA home in a suburb is a house located in a suburb of a city. A home in a suburb of any city is generally larger than a home in a city; suburb homes may be smaller than city homes but they are larger than rural homes. A home in a city is generally smaller than a home in a suburb because suburb cities have more people.\n\n#### 4)C:big house\n\nA big house is when you use the word \u201cbig\u201d because you can\u2019t figure out what else it means.\n\n#### 5)E:keeping personal objects\n\nAn object is something that has a certain form, usually consisting of solid matter. An object can also be a piece of information not written on a surface, as in photographs or audio recordings. Objects are the physical manifestation of information in written material or recorded media that is retained and can be accessed without physical contact with the original object or medium. Objects can be classified into different categories depending on their purpose, type or function. For example, in many societies there is a tradition of preserving objects that are not valuable because they serve some purpose such as a decoration or a relic. Objects are typically collected by humans for their beauty, their significance as artifacts or relics, and for their utilitarian value.", "answer": "B: suburban home"}

A third of the first box is equal to \u00bc of the second box; then, half of the third box equals three-quarters of the fourth box. By adding the first box to the fourth box, which will be the same, we get 5 cups.\n\n### Explanation:\nFirst box + (First box / 3) => First box + (First box/3) = <<1st box+1st box/3=1st box/3*1=1>>1st box/3\n1st box/3 = <<1st box/3>>1 box/3 = <<(1st box/3)/3>>1/3 which = <<3>>3 = <<3/3>>1 so, 1/3 is really 1.\n\n```\nFirst box / 3 = 1st box / 3 * 1 = 1st box/3 * 1 = <<1st box (1st box)/3*1 = 3>>3\nSecond box / 2 = <<(2nd box)/2>>2 box / 2 = 2 box / 2 * 2 = <<2 box/2*2=4>>4\nThird box = 4 + 4 + 4 = <<4+4+4=", "answer": "C: victorian house"}

However, I learned that fractions are actually pretty easy to understand, once you learn how to think about them. I learned that some numbers might be easier to think of with fractions rather than decimals. For instance, when thinking about a fraction like \"1/2\", you immediately think about the total number two pieces you need to divide the number between the two pieces. On the other hand, when you are thinking about a decimal like.5, you think of the number going around and around, without knowing how to stop it.\n\n#### Rationales:\nHow did you decide to go from decimal number to fraction number?\nI learned that some numbers might better understood as fractions rather than decimal. For example, I did the problem with decimal,.5, and was having trouble, but I knew the answer was \u00bc, so I knew I had to find a way to do this with fractions rather than decimal, which gave me some easier way of thinking about the problem!\n\n#### Fraction\nAnswer:\n\n### Instution:\n\n### Demaostration:\nInput: The recipe called for 1 cup of chocolate syrup and 2 cups of whole milk and after the ingredients were mixed, they were still not mixed right. After adding another 1 cup of chocholate syrup and 1 more cup of whole milk the mixture was finally blended well and the color was right. What is the ratio of whole milk to chocolate syrup in the final blend?\nRationales I used for my thinking. The ingredients needed are 1 cup of chocalate syrup,2 cups of whole mile and 2 more cups of whole milk.I needed something for me to be able to figure this out, and I was hoping it would lead me to the right answer. So what I did was I looked at the number of whole milk that it takes to get to the final", "answer": "B: play sports"}

There's only 1 3 in the equation, which is the total number of shirts at 13. The correct answer is 5.

Clearly demonstrate every step in your thought process.\n\n### Calculation 1: (7.5)(5 2)/(4)(6-1)\n\n### Calculated Result: 62 1010\n\n### Reasoning: The 5 2 refers to the 5 and 2, because an exponent is represented by an x, i.e. 5 x 2. There are no negative exponents at all. This exponent says that the base 5 is multiplied by itself 2 times.\nTherefore, 5 x 5 x 5 is equivalent to 5 x 5^2, which shows that 5^2 is multiplied by itself one more time, as in (5^2)^2 = 5^3, which means that the base 5 3.5 raised to the 3rd power. 3.5 raised the 3rd power is 25, \nsince (2) x (2) x (3.5) x (3.35)=9 10. The final result is that the product is 62 x 1010.\n\n### Commentary: Calculating 5 x 5 raised the third power equals 25: 5 x 5, which is the base of the operation and is squared, 5 x 25.

Lindsay waited in line for several hours to get the last seat on the bus. After the bus left, Zina walked to the grocery store and bought a loaf of bread and two cookies, and a bag of chips. She then walked home to eat her snack. Lindsay then walked 4 miles to her house and watched some television, and then did her homework.  How many miles did Lindsay walk?\n\n### Rationales: Since it takes 4 miles to walk to Lindsay's house, Lindsay must have walked at least 4 miles when the bus left. Lindsay also spent 1 hour waiting to get on the bus. So Lindsay walked 4 miles and spent 1 hour waiting. Lindsay then spent only 4 hours at her home.

{"text": "In that case, the clothing must have been purchased at a department store.\n(Based on the premise of the question).\n\n### Rationales:There is no data on which places the clothing was purchased, so this can be answered using the provided data. From the given choices, it is unlikely for the clothing to be purchased from the cinema hall, as the average price for tickets is $11.00 per person, which is relatively low compared to the other places (mall, department store, closet, and shop). Therefore, the clothing is unlikely to be purchased at the cinema hall, if it would even be available there (as the cinemas normally only have film-related merchandise).\nNext, while department stores are expensive compared to other places.\nHowever, the clothing cannot have been purchased at the department store, for a couple of reasons:\nFirstly, the clothing purchased must have been expensive compared to other places (otherwise it would not be interesting; rather ordinary). The department stores would probably be able to sell more expensive clothing, given the amount of customers shopping there, but this does not match the premise of the original statement. Moreover, the clothing could presumably only be worn by children (which is mentioned briefly in the original statement), so it is unlikely that the department store would have such high quality clothing for young children.\nThirdly, the department store cannot have been the place where the clothing was purchased as the prices there may have been different. While the original statement does not mention a specific price, the department store may be able to sell high quality clothing at a slightly cheaper price than other places.\nFinally, the clothing cannot be purchased from the shop, and the price would have been lower compared to the other places: \nSince the sentence is not specifying the type of clothing, it is possible to presume that it could be clothes, accessories (or any other type of products from the shop), so the shop cannot be the place in which the clothing is purchased.\n\nThus, it can be deduced that the clothing was purchased at a department store, as indicated by the original statement.\n#### 1\nAnswer: 1\n \n### Input:Jordan sold some of her belongings for $650.

Therefore, before the two slices were cut out of the pizza, the combined dimensions of the two slices must have been 125 + 9 = 134 square inches.

He gives one (1) to each of eight (8) sets of neighbors who have (have) a total of eight (8) dogs. If one (1) dog is given to each of six (6) sets of neighbors, how many (total) dogs will be left over??\nLet n denote the total number of dogs. Since there are 8 neighbors, there will be 8 more dogs than the sum of the current dog's number.\nSince one dog is given to each set, there are (total/set)/total dogs left.\nThe sum of the dog's numbers is (n/set)/total (with n = n/set). Then\nn = 8 (since there are eight neighbors). Substitute this into the formula above, n/set = (8/set)/(total/set). In this case, we have 8/set = (total/set)/8.\nMultiply both sides to get 8 = (total/set)8. Subtracting both sides by 8, dividing 8 by 8/set and multiplying the result with (total/set), we get, (total/set)(8/8 set) = 8.\nSubstituting (total/set) and (8/8 set) into the given equation, we get, (8x8)/((8x8 (total/set)) = 8. Therefore, (total/set) = 8. This means that the total number of dogs is 76, since total = 8(8(6)) which is 76.\n\n### Rationales\nSince there will be 8 (total of 8", "answer": "C: millpond"}

It's a whole number where all of the numbers are 0.\n\n*\n\nExplain if $-300$ can be classified of integer or rational.\n\nRational numbers, sometimes referred to as counting numbers, are numbers that can be written as fractions, are whole numbers, and fall between any two whole numbers.\n\nThus, $-300$ is neither a rational or a negative whole number. (-300) is not a negative integer as well.\n\n### Subject:\n\nIf you do not know how to differentiate between a rational and integer, please read the following notes.\n\nRational Numbers: A rational number is a", "answer": "C: fly"}

To do this eliminatorily we have to replace the words florida's are (found in the states) with (on the east coast of the state of unite states).\nSince the response is only talking about florida's we need to figure out if there are more correct words to remove and find out which way is it correct. If the response is stating floridas are found in denmark, then this is also incorrect, because floridas are found in united states; they are on the states of new jersery and newyork.\nIf the response says floridas are found on a map, then this is also correct.\nThe response in the explanation should be: florida's.\n\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.

Which player would most likely win the game?\nRationales:(A) The player that is winning the game will remain winning or the game will become a draw if it\u2019s a tie.\n(B) The player with least number of stones has a strong chance to win the game.\nThe solution is (B).\n### Exercise 11\n### Demonstiation:The equation: 5h + 7m = <7m=25>\nWhere h is an unknown and m is an unknown.\n\n### Solution:\n5 * h + 7m = 36\nTo solve for h, we take 36 \u2013 7m and distribute.\nWe get 5 * h + 6 = 36 \u2013 49\nSubtracting by 49 and dividing both sides by 5.\nWe get h = <36-49=3> so the original equation becomes:\n5h + 7 * 3 = <36\\-49=36>\nAnd the answer is h=3\n### Exercice 10\n### Demonstaion:\nTo solve for x, let x = <2x + <2x+x = 5x>\nSo x + 2x = 3x\nSubtracting both sides by 3x\nWe get x = <2x=2>\nSo x = 2\nThis completes the solution", "answer": "D: chess board"}

{"text": "You probably dont have any of these things.\n\n### Input (A): The teacher of 8th grade math says that the cost of a new textbook is 38 dollars. You know that each chapter in the textbook costs (3X) dollars and you also know that the number of chapters in the book is 22X + 6. How many dollars does the new textbook cost if the teacher uses the new textbook?\nRationales The teacher paid $38 for the book, so x = the number of chapters.\n(3x)x = <<3X*x=108>> 108\nAdding the cost per chapter to total number of chapters, we get 108 + 22x + 6 = x*(3x)\nRearranging to solve for x, we get (3x) = 108 - x\nDividing both terms by (3x), we get x = <<3x/(108-x)=38/70=0.56>> 0.56\nSo the teacher paid $38/0.56 = <<38/.56=69>>69 dollars.\n#### 70\nAnswer: 70\n\n### Input(B): The average height of students in your class is 165 cm.

His mom had to make dinner, walk the dog, wash the car and water the plants. They had to do this for 2 hours apiece one afternoon. They had to do these tasks together for 3 hours total. How long could they spend doing their tasks together?\n\n### Rationale\n\nSince Tom and his mom each had 2 hours left, and they do not add up to the total of the 3 together.\nIf Tom had an extra hour than his mom, Tom would have 3 hours together whereas only 2 hours together for his mom.\nThink if Tom and his mom had to mow, water and put dishes in dishwasher, then they could spend 2 hours together doing those. Add 2 to the 2 hours they already had, that would be their 4 hours for the 3 hours.\nIf either of them were not allowed to do their own duties, then their extra time would not be factored in.\nExample:\n\nTom (started early) - 4 hours with mom\nMom - 2 hours with Tom and 2 hours with dishes\nTom (started late) - 2 hours with mom and 4 hours with dishes\n\nIf each were doing their own duties separately, then they would all have been done separately, and they would not have been able to spend any time together in the process.\nIf they were not doing their own duties together, then they would only have 2 hours to work on together, then 2 for each doing their own duties alone.\n\n#### 9\nAnswer: 9\n\n### Input - A and B are friends who live down the block from each other.

By the end of the night, not much else can be heard, not even from the crickets. When the sun rises the next morning, the crickets once again start their chorus.\n\n### Rationales:\nIn the above passage, we can see how the narrator likens the crickets\u2019 choruses to the narrator\u2019s house. Both get louder the later in the night they are. However, the house stops making its noise when the crickets\u2019 noises fill up its space. As daylight approaches, the house gets quieter as the crickets\u2019 songs get louder.\n\nHowever, this is a night-time event. We can find the opposite phenomenon during the day.

{"text": "A\n\n### Input:(Read: A= answer B= blank C= clue D= distracting E= easy)\n\nSometimes, when you are trying to decide which word is being used, you need to guess what the sentence means. Sometimes, what the sentence is saying is very easy to guess, even if it isn't written.\n\n### Example: \n\nIf I say \"I can't go out to dinner right now because the roads are a mess\", it's a given that you will find roads in bad shape very frustrating. That's also how \"hard\" is chosen in this example. It's an easy guess, as soon as you know what's really being said here. But a distractor is only a distraction when there's another choice nearby that means what the clue is asking.\n\n### Distractor: A hard time means I don't know how I'm going to get from point A to point B.\n\nRationales: Dinner is eaten at point A, and a bad storm is at point B. In this distractor, though, when we get to point B, we're not sure where point A is. So even if you know \"hard\" is related here, you wouldn't choose it because it doesn't describe the point in the sentence where it's needed. A hard time doesn't mean \"you have to spend a lot of time on this,\" it means that you have to do more work than was anticipated, more than necessary.

D: If Ruthie decides to rent the horror movie \u201cHalloween\u201d she can buy a small bag of chips and half a cheeseburger.\n#### C, Spanish food\nRationales: The movie for Lizzie McGuire costs 7 dollars and the bag of chips + the cheese quesadila =$5.75. Therefore, she can buy 5.75+7= $<<5.75+5.75+3.50>=16.75>$16.75\n#### D, horror movie\nRationales: One medium bag of chips is equal to $3.50, and one cheeseburger is equal to $4. The action movie costs $7 and the horror movie cost $8. We add $7 and $8 to $3.5+$4+$8=$ 16.75. Therefore her babysitting pays for one horror movie.\n#### A, action movie\nRationales:$8= Action Movie.\nRental cost = $8\nFood cost = 5.75\n$8+ 5.75< $8\nSince the action movie costs more than the babysitting pay, this option is incorrect.\n#### B, Spanish food\nRationales:$5.75 = Spanish food cost.\nFood Cost = Spanish food\nMovie cost = $7\n$7>Food", "answer": "B: magazines"}

How much does he have left over to spend?\nRationales \nAt 20, he spends 20/20 = <<20/20=1>>1 $\nAt 8 he spends 8/8 = <<8/8=1>>  $\nAt 12, he spends 12/12 = <<12/12=1>>1 $ \nAt 2 $ which is the last $ he saves.\nTo find the amount saved, we can simply subtract 1 + 2 + 1 = <<1+2+1=4>>$4 in expenses from $20. Because 4 > 0, he has $20 - 4 dollars = $<<20-4=16>>16 left over.\nDollar amounts are always represented with the dollar sign $ followed by the amount itself. For example, if someone spent $20, we would write $20 instead of <<20=20>>$20.\nSo the equation is:\n20 - (1 + 2 +4) = <<20-1+2+4>>$16.\n\n### Result: 16\n\n### Input : How many candies does John have left over to spend?\n\n---\n## Demonstration\n\nWe know that 16 is remaining by subtracting 1 + 2+4, so 16 = <<20 - (1+2+4), so John has  16 dollars left over to spend.\n\n---\n## Test\n\nTest  the above questions and find the answer.", "answer": "E: dirty dishes"}

The boy did whatever he was doing progressively (third).

{"text": "B\n\n### Justification:\nInput: After the first week of the company training program, trainees are asked to evaluate whether the training program met the objectives. All respondents give it an average score of 96.3% which is rounded to 96%. How many trainees responded?\nRationales:: We first determine the total number of trainees that responded. 96.3 = <<96.3=100>>\nThen we assume that each trainee is an integer, so no trainee responded less or more than another trainee.\nThe number of trainees responding cannot exceed or less than the total number of traineres responding (96).\nThe number of traineres can only be greater than or equal to 0, because there cannot be fewer traineres than trainees.\nThe possible numbers to assume that could fit the equation are: 0 + 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8.\nTo see which one of these six numbers to use, we subtract 0.3 from each number and get 0.3 < (1 - 0.3) < (2 - 0.3), to show that 0.3 cannot be reached.\nTo see if 0 is possible, we add 0.3 to each number and get 1 > (1 + 0.3) > (2 +0.3) >... > (7 + 0.3). Since the difference between each number is positive, it is impossible for 0 to be the result.\nTo see if the total number of traincers and the number of trainees can be the same, we add 0 to each number and get (0 - 0). This is always less than 0 (<<0-0=0>>0), therefore not equal to either the total number or the number of traineers and is therefore impossible. For every value from 0 to 8, the total number of trainneres and the number of traincers are the same.\nTherefore, <<0>>0 is impossible.\nThe only combination that fits the problem is: 1. Because <<1=1>>1 is the only integer that fits the problem.\n#### 1\nAnswer: 1", "answer": "A: accomplish"}

The probability that they did not find the toy is 1- ((1/3)*3+ (725/3) 65), and 1- (1/12+725/12) = 1-1/65= (555/65), and (555/125) = <<555=0.44>>44 % So the probability that he/she got the box of cereal is 1-0.44=", "answer": "B: complete sentence"}

To prove this, notice that the letter that they pick is the letter that is not A, which is 'B'.\nIf the student picks apartment, the letter that they pick will be another letter, excluding 'E'. Since the letter isn't 'E', the letter that the student picked will be 'C'.\nIf the student chose firehouse, the letter the student picked is 'D'.\nFor the bus stop, students only picked 'E' because there is no other option for the letter.\nTherefore, the letters that students can only pick are 'A' to 'D', which are the letters that are being compared to 'E'.\nThus, we can conclude that the letter that the student picks is the letter that is on the same side as 'E', which is 'D'.\nIf the letter that the student chose was on the same side as the letter 'E', then the letter that the student chooses must be 'A'.\nSince the letter the student chooses is 'D', the student chose 'D' which is different from 'A'.\nThe next letter the student could choose is 'C' the letter that is below 'A'.\nThus, the student chose 'C'.\n#### Answer:C\n\n### Rationale:The student chose the first and last letter 'A' and 'C' respectively.\n### Instruction\nIf the letters chosen by the student match the letters above and below E, then the student must choose a letter in between the letters above and below 'E', which is the letter that is below the letter 'E', which is in between 'E' and any letter that is above 'E', which is between the letters 'C' and 'D'.\nIf x = 'A'\nthen 'B', 'C', and 'D', are the letters that the student is choosing from.\nTherefore, when the student picks 'B', there will no longer be one letter that is the only choice left to the student, so therefore, the letter that they choose is the letter that is above", "answer": "E: bus stop"}

Then, an Earth orbit is $2 \\pi d \\mathrm{\\ in \\ seconds.}$ Divide the length of an Earth-orbit (2\u03c0d) by the hours of a complete day, and you\u2019ll get 365.25. But that\u2019s in 24 hour days, not 12 hour days. To convert, multiply the 12-hour day times the 12 hour day, and add a few days to it to make up the difference of the Earth months. 720*365.24 = 265,624.8 265, 624.8 hours of 24-hour day are equivalent to 670,000 days.

On the first day of the sale, children's toys were on sale half the price and on the second day, children's toy costs were at the normal rate. How many fewer children's toys did 13 children buy between the two days?\nRationales First, We will figure out how many children's toys a child bought each day.\nOn the first day, we must divide the original prices by half to get the price of half the original price.\nSo, for each child who bought toys the day before, that child will buy (1/2) x 200 = 100 children's toys.\nOn the second day, the normal cost of children's toys is used. Each child will buy 200 toys.\nWhen we add these two values, we get 28, 000 toys for the first day, and 24,000 toys on the second day.\nThe total number of children's toy purchased on the two days is (28,000 + 24,0\n\nWhen we subtract 13 children\u2019s toys from the 47,000 total number of children' toy purchased in two days.\nWe get 47,0 - 13 = <<47,0-13=3.1>>3,1 children and their toys remaining toy purchased after subtracting 13 children's toys from the total.

When Aimee was the same age as her father, her father was 25 years old, or 28 months older than her, because 9 months is a quarter of 100% of 1 year. But Aimee's height in 28 months and 9 days is 73% of her height as measured at the end of the same month and day at age 13. When she was 2 years, 11 months, and 9\u00bd days old, her father was 0.73 of her height, and 28 months and nine days later, she was a third smaller in height than her father. 28/(60 days+9\u00bd days) = 73%\n\nThen:\n 28 months or 2 years 9 months = 150% \n 9\u00bd days or 132 days = 110% \nSo, the combined effect, or percentage, was 263%\n\nThen 263% of 25 (her father's age) is:\n 263 x 25% = 65% increase, and 263 x? = (25% - (65%)) = 21% decrease\n\n65% increased/21% decreased = 3.05\nWe can convert this to whole numbers by taking the reciprocal: 1/1 -", "answer": "A: think"}

{"text": "B: third world country\n\n### Instructions:The following questions test mathematical reasoning and problem solving.\n\nQuestion 6:\n\nInput: There is a train in Japan that contains 146 cars. All of its cars have identical interiors except the one and only dining car, which has 4 fewer seats than the rest. At a railroad station, 370 passengers are lined up, each waiting to be loaded onto the train. There are not nearly enough seats to go around, and so passengers are sorted into two categories. One category of passengers consists of those who will certainly not be seated in the dining car. The other category includes those who might be seated in the interior of the dining car but would not enter the dining car if they were not seated there (but also they could choose to enter the dining car voluntarily while seated in the interior). Passengers in Category 1 are allowed to load onto the train without the need to wait in line. Passengers in Category 2 are only allowed to load at the very last minute and only if there are still seats available in the dining car at that time. In line are 68 students, who will definitely not be seated in any location in the dining car, and 288 others, who may be or may not be seated in seats in the dining car and, if they are, will sit in the interior unless seated there. Count the number of seats available to those in Category 2 who will be seated in the seats in the dining-car interior but would not enter the actual dining car.\n\nRationales: There is a total of 101 seats in the dining cars and the dining car has 93 seats.\nIn total, there is 6 + 93 = 99\nThere is 146 - 4 = 142 seats available to passengers in Category 2 who would not enter the ding car if they were seated there, but might if seated in the interior.

{"text": "D: standing in line \n\n#### Answer: \n\n### Input and Rationale:\nIn this problem there are 30 minutes from one time slot to the next, and a total of 2 minutes are left over. As such, we have 3/30 or 0.1 time slots/minute. As such, the total amount of time each slot lasts is:\n\nWe must have 400 time slots in order to fill as many time slots as are available in 2640 minutes. Therefore, we must have a ratio of time slots = 400/10, so each individual time slot lasts  4/10 seconds.\n\n### Answer:\nThere are a total of 2640 time slots available, as given in the question. In 2640 * 4/10 minutes, a certain event occurs. If we fill the first 30 minutes of that event with time slots like in the diagram, there are 620 time slots total. Each time slot is 4/10 (40/10) of 1 second, so each time slot is 40/10 of 1/10 (0.1) = 0.04 seconds. Since we begin with 620 time slot, each time slot is worth about 0.05 seconds. This is exactly 0.005 seconds, or 50 nanoseconds (ns).\n\n#### 50 ns\nAnswer: 50 ns\n\n### Input. Answer Input, Rationale: In this problem I set up the inequality. Let c = -2x + 1,  and let a = -2 - 5c. Then, c^2 = a^2 + 4 c - the value is given.\n\nc^2 = a^ 2 + 4 c = (2-2)*(-2-5(-2-5(-7+4))) > 0 so -2<=-2<-5<-5<-7<-4<0\n\nSince that is an odd numbered series (-2<-2<-5<-5<-><-4<-7<->0), if its even it would go 4>0, so its odd  so we would have an odd number in the series and that", "answer": "B: less confusion"}

Nate has six blue dice and three red dice. They each rolled once. Cameron rolled 4, Nate rolled 1. Then they each rolled each other\u2019s dice. Cameron\u2019s dice were added together to find the probability of Cameron getting at least 4. Then they used this number to find the probability that Cameron or Nate got at least 4.\n\n### Response\nI could write this question as a paragraph or make a table, but I\u2019m writing as a paragraph because Cameron and Nate added the two sets of dice.\n\n### Rationale:\nTo find the probability that Cameran gets at least 4, Cameron and Nate took their one die and added them to Cameron\u2019s five dice and counted how many dice over 4. If Cameron rolled 6 dice, it doesn\u2019t count because it\u2019s not over 4, so the two dice aren\u2019t being added. So Cameron rolled 2 dice over 4 (1,2) since he got 4 dice in total. Since Nate only had to hit 4, he didn\u2019t roll those dice so Cameron got 2 dice over 5. So the probability he rolled 4 or greater was 2/7 = <<2/7=0.29>>0.29.\n\nThe probability of Cameron or Nate hitting at least 4 is 2/7 = 0.29 + 0.25 = <<2/7+2/7=05/14>>05/14 because once that one die is added in the probability doubles. So, one dice was rolled for Cameron and then Nate rolled his two dice and then the one Cameron rolled.

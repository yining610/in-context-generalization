{"text": "The choices are not mutually exclusive, so we just need to evaluate all possible cases. Consider case E, \"satisfaction\". Since everyone loves food, we assume that anyone who is satisfied with any food would then be satisfied with the tasting menu. So for this choice, we just need to consider case B, \"getting full\". We can then ask how often one achieves this when eating  everything on the menu. To this end, let f(x) be the probability that one gets full. For case E, we know that given satisfaction, one always gets full, so f(satisfaction) = 1. For case B, we consider 10 different scenarios of items ordered (see the picture), and for each, determine which item needs to be eaten next in order to get full. Since the last item eaten can only be any one of these 10 items, for each scenario, the total probability that one will get full is simply the product of the probabilities of these items: 10 * (1/10) * (1/11) *... * (1/9) * (1/99) * (1). This gives us a final value of f(B) = 10 * (0.1 * 0.11 *... * 0.09 *0.000011) = 0.1090379.

Why is that?\nOutput: To triple a negative integer is to shift in a positive number such that you end up with a positive integer. In the negative -9 case, you get -3 + 3 = 0 because 3 is more than -3 thus leaving a +ve integer. \nSo the answer is because if you triple a negative number, you end up with a non-negative number.\nWe also can show it more formally using the fact that the following table is true for negative and positive reals\n\n<table style=\"width:100%;\">\n  <tr>\n    <td>$1x+y<-z$</td>\n    <td style=\"text-align:right\">if y=0, then $x=1, otherwise, $x=3$</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr> \n    <td>$-1x+y<-$z</td>\n   \n  </tr><tr>  \n    <td>-0x-y$</td>\n  \n  </tr><td>-0x$</td>\n      \n  </tr>  \n</table>\n\nAbove, x is not changed at all.

He then used a fraction to add up to one whole.

Let us take the simplest of the three purchases first. He could have purchased 3/8 of the car. That means it cost him $3/8 * $$3/8$$ of $5000. Using multiplication to multiply 3/8, it equals to.75 of 5000. Subtracting.75 from 5000 we get 5000 -.75 = $<<5000-1/4=2999>>2999. 2999/2 = $<<2999/4=750>>750 so he saved money by dividing the price by 2.

To add insult to injury, the fifths were not equal. The sausage had twice as much salt as the cookies, which had 3 times as much as the pasta. How much salt was there in the sausage?\nOutput: First, we find how much salt there is in the sausage.\nThe sausage has twice as much salt as pasta.

If the total number of total 4 that make the digit is a multiple of 4 then it will be divisible by 4 without regard to any of the other digits (including the 0 and 4) because 4 goes into the base 10 digits as many times as the base is divisible by", "answer": "C: new hampshire"}

We could also consider 1/2 which is NOT a whole because it's fractional, not whole, so we can rule those out.\n\nWhen we get our 10,001 (1 in 10k), it's also NOT a whole number as it's more than one 10 (the way our answer is). It's a decimal to 2 digits - this is equivalent to being more than one 1 to two decimal places as you can see after the comma, so we can discard it.\n\n100,010 was also discarded because it's technically more than just a single whole number. We could keep adding ones to the beginning, but it'd only become a decimal so it's not whole and we'll find the same issue again.\n\n## Exposure Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=kYL4Bm5rE6I&feature=emb_logo\n\nInput: If you look at the two numbers 20, 25, 30... which one goes first?

Shane works faster than Cindy, so Mr. Vole has Cindy do twice as much work as Shane so that their daily production is the same.

{"text": "We know that a joke or humor can make him laugh. He might be scared when someone tries to scare him or surprise him. So he can laugh when someone scares him. And he can fight when scared or surprised. What is this all about? So, let us go down the path of an example. Suppose you want to scare him, and then he laughs. Then you do a joke while he is expecting a scary encounter. And once he is expecting one, it will cause a scared reaction, which means he will think of you to have prepared a surprise. So once he is expecting a joke will scare him, and it will start all over again. So it is a never-ending chain of scares while he continues to laugh while he expects the scare to come from somewhere. That is why a joke can make him laugh.\nNext, to make him laugh out loud, you need to surprise and scare him or startle him. So laughter fits the bill.\nThen, we can take a step further and say even his laughter can cause him to scream. And this scream is not going to be scary or shocking to him because the scream came from his end, and the response is not in his control.\nSo, laughter does both the job to surprise and startle him. You expect him to be scared; then he laughs, which is unexpected. And when this laugh gets mixed with an attack to his feelings, it could cause him to scream, which is scary to him.\nSo, I think laughter does both the jobs. There comes a little twist here. We all know that fighting is going to make them unhappy. This is something we all know. So we do know that the fight will be an unwelcome response. But what happens after the fight? Well, the fight is not the end. It continues unless and until he agrees to his condition. Then the fight is over. And the fighting is something that he expects. So his expectation of a scare doesn't go anywhere to bring him happiness.\nSo I think this question would go with the option of B. But I guess the answer will be A. But I think the answer is B.\n\nInput: Which one of these does not happen in the story of King Arthur? Choices: A) King Arthur was a legend. B) King Arthur lived in England", "answer": "B: humor"}

Maria has three different colored panties. She wears white ones as well as colored ones. Since Maria wears the colored ones, how many panties does she wear for the holidays?\nOutput: Let's start by saying you have three different colored panty colors to wear. The three color choices are Red Pants, Green Pants and Blue Pants.\nFirst lets choose which of these pants she wore to dinner at her parents' house; this would be her mother in the scenario and since she already knows you wore white and other colored, her reply would be \"You wore blue pants today.\"\nNow lets choose another pair of pants; this would be the second scenario in which you wear the pants (either at your mom's house or at your friends). In this scenario, Maria's mother says the following: \"You wore red pants today.\"\nLet's choose another set of pants for her: this is her wearing the pants in the third scenario; this time at your friend's house.\nThe correct answer comes from this scenario: her mom says \"I can't believe you wore green pants!\"\nSo the correct answer is GREEN\n\nInput: A mother and her baby are driving along a road.

What is the probability of choosing a yellow apple?\nOutput: There are 3 red apples in the bag, and we have 2 green apples as well. The total number of apples, in sum, is 5.\nWhen we choose a peach, there is a probability of getting red or green apples, since there are two options instead of one. We pick a peach and we get an apple from the bag, and since there are only two options in total, there is a one-to-two chance of getting either a red or a green apple.\nSo there is a probability of 1/2 of getting a red or green apple.\nWhen we have a choice of choosing any fruit from the bag, we can choose any number of apples ranging from yellow to red, from green to peach, and we have 6 choices in total. For each choice, the probability is still one to two and the total probability is 6 * 1/2 = <<6*1/2=3>>3.\nThere are 3 apples of every color but", "answer": "C: race track"}

A further 4 books came from a friend who lent 2 books and a family member who lent 2 more books. How many books did each student get?\nOutput: First, the two books from the family member and the two books from the friend totaled 4 books.\nThere were 12 books plus 4 = 16 books. Then, 5 of them bought each bought one book so there was a total of 5 of them. 10 of the rest bought one or two books each so there were 10 of them. That meant that the rest did not contribute to the 16 books which were 6 of the 16 books. However, with 2/6 = 1/3 of the books from the students. That meant that there were 15 of them not the 12 originally thought\nSo the final answer: total = 16 books each\n\nInput: Two friends made a fruit pie together for dessert.

Next, you take one marble out of the bag, put it back, then take another. Repeat this process as many times as you'd like. What is the chance that you take out the same marble both times? 20% of marbles are blue, and the rest are green.\nOutput: You have two marbles with colors blue and green. And you'll randomly pick 1 of the marbles to put back.\n\nWithout repetition, the chances of finding the same marble would be 1 out of 4.\nWith repetition, there are 5 possibilities to draw marbles. The chances of both marbles being the same is either 1/5 or 2/5.\n\nBut, what if you have 2 drawings, and one is repeated?\nThis is done by adding the chances of getting the same marble, and getting a different marble after the repetition. For instance, if there are 2 drawings, the chances of getting 2 different marbles is: (3/5) + (1/5).\nBut, if the chances of getting one same marble, and one different marble, is: 2/5 + (3/5)\nThus, choosing the same marble both draw times would be: 2/5 * 2/5. This will multiply to 1/16 which is the answer.\n\nInput:(5 + x + 5x2 + x3 + x4)(x + 2x2 + 3x3 + 4x4 + 5x5)\nOutput: Both of these equations can be simplified to 5 * x * (1 + x + 2x2).\nAdding more, the final answer is: 5 * x * ((1 + x) * (1 + 2x)\nSo the final answer has an answer of 5 * 2 * 5.\n\nInput: John wants to buy a 3 foot bed, and he spent 5 times as much on the bed frame, and twice as much on the mattress, as he spent on the bed frame.", "answer": "A: cause death"}

Cars are always in the air at anytime during an 8-hour day in the U.S.\n2. You can always find cows on the grass in the countryside of the midwest.\n3. Average amount of sun shines on the earth each day is about 9 hours.\n4. The average amount of rain per month in the desert south is less than 1 inch.\nOutput: Statement 1 is not true because there are instances such as in downtown New York City where there are no cars in the air and therefore statement 1 is false.\nStatement 2 is not true because cows are not always found on the grass in the midwest such as Minnesota or North Carolina.\nStatement 3 is not true because there is not always about 9 hours of sun to shine on the earth each day. In fact the amount of sun that shines changes almost every day for the whole year.\nStatement 4 is not true because even though the average rainfall in the desert south is almost never above 2 inches, that does not mean there is not a day of the month that at least 1 inch of rainfall doesn't happen when there is a storm.\nSo the final answe is None", "answer": "D: spend money"}

{"text": "In a situation in which one is lonely, socializing with people could make that person feel less lonely. There are many things one can do to be more social, but one easy thing would be to try to meet or establish friendships with new people. Meeting people by attending events or making opportunities for yourself to meet new people is the easiest way to get out of your comfort zone and become more social. Another option, if meeting new people is not for you, is to go on social media and get more likes, shares, and followers by being active to become more socialized with your peers. Drinking alcohol is not the answer as one could be depressed or may not be able to enjoy or remember their experience. People often use alcohol to forget about their loneliness and the loneliness could still be left as alcohol is a false way to make someone feel happy. Making someone, like yourself, laugh is another method to lift a person's spirits as that person may not even realize how much of an impact it had on them, that they were feeling lonely until they laughed. Liquor is also an unhealthy option to feel better because one is still drinking out of loneliness and might not even remember their experience. While liquor may help them forget they are lonely for a while, it's not a good and healthy option to become more social on the spot. All of these ideas are ways to get out of one's comfort zone as well, but they may be easier options to get more involved socially.\nSo the final answers are A and E.\n\n\nInput: What is the value of 15*9?\nOutput: 15 * 9 = 135\n(135/2) = 67.5\nSo the final answer 67 1/2\n\nInput: A person walks 5 mins to take one bath, 2 minutes to shave, and 10 minutes to put their clothes away.

When you slide one water bottle after the other, each bottle gets pushed away, making a razor blade for Gavin to shave. When he needs to shave, he just has to slide a water bottle through the mirror, so that it lands between the bottles on the left, and the mirror. Then, one of the left bottles get pushed off to the right, but with Gavin\u2019s razor blade, he gets to use it to shave.\nSo the final answers are all D: mirror", "answer": "D: grocery store"}

If it travels 260 miles, it will have how much gas left?\nOutput: First, let's look to figure out the total amount of gas used in a fill. 3 quarts of gas means that this is one fill.\nMultiplying 5 quarts (gas tank) by 0.5 (3 quarts / 6 quarts) = <<5*0.5=2.5>>2.5 gallons\nYou travel 260 miles. This means that you have traveled <<260=260>>260 miles.\nSubtracting these numbers, you find that it travels <<260-2.5=257.5>>257.5 miles.\nTo continue to solve this problem, we now multiply 257.5 by 0.5 = <<257.5*0.5==128.75>>128.7 gallons.\nNow you have 128.7 quarts / 6 = <<128.7/6=21.4>>21.4 liters.\nThis means that <<21.4=21.47>>21.47 liters is the amount of gas that you have left.\nSo the final answear is 21.4721.47\n\nInput: How can I make a 15-digit number using all the digits 1 2 4\n Output: <<The answer is 4!>>4!1 2 44 2 446 2 44", "answer": "B: love"}

{"text": "We can break a dollar to get it out of the cash drawer.\nSo the final choice to put a dollar is D\n\nInput: A new bookstore has just opened down the street from another bookstore that's been at that location for 4 years. The new bookstore sells books at a 30% discount from the original bookstore. How long will it take the new store to take half of the business from the original store?\nOutput: We can use linear equations to figure this out. For the current store it is P * (100% - 30%) = R\nSo at 30%, 100% -30% = 70%\nSo the current store is making (P * 70% ) = R\nFor the new store: (P * 130%) = R, 130% = 30% + 30% +2%\nSo we can write (30% of P) + (30% of T) = T\nT will equal 130%, so we can use the subtraction properties to subtract 100% from each side and get 100% = T-(30% of P)-30% of T\n100% = 130% - (30% of 30% of P\n(30% of 100% of P is 15 of original P\n16 of original P or 6% of original P = (30% of original P)\nUsing the multiplicative inverse of 30% to get rid of 30% we get 30% * 5 = 15\nSo we get\n100% - (3 of 75% of P) = (100%(75% =3 of30% of P))\n100%= 3(30% of original T)\n(100% =90% so we can use the multioplicative inverse to get rid of the 3)\nSo\n90% = 3(30)% of 30 T\nWe can group all the stuff together and solve for T\nWe find T=240 or 87.5% of P T = 3*(30", "answer": "B: piggy bank"}

In the sequence, the middle number is a three-digit number. One of the numbers in the sequence is odd. Three of the numbers in the sequences are prime, and two of the numbers are not prime. Given the middle number in the sequence, what must be true about each adjacent number it is between? Choices:  If the middle number is odd, the both numbers on either side of the middle number are odd. The middle number is the only even number. The middle number must be the only prime number. The middle number is two less than the number to its left and two more than the number to its right. The two numbers to the left of the middle number are prime.\nOutput: Let x be the middle number, a prime.\nWe let i be the index of the number before x.\nWe let j be the index of the two numbers after x.\nIf x is even, then i - 1 and j - 1 cannot be both even.\nIf i - 1 = j - 1, then the only even integers between i and j are i and j.\nIf i -1 > j - 1, we will see that j is odd, by definition of the middle number.\nIf they are both even, then j is odd.\nNow, since the middle number and the number before it are both odd, then this can only happen if j = x and x - 1 = i.\nWhen i = 2, x = 3, as the middle number is a prime number.\nHence, it can only be true that x is the only even prime number and that x must be the only prime in the sequence.\nThus, the answer to each of the options is either A: the middle number is the only prime number or B: the middle number is even.\nSo the final answers is 1) A: the middle number must be the odd number and 2) B: the middle number must only be an even option.\n\nInput: There is a line of 20 people standing on the sidewalk in front of a grocery store.

{"text": "I think the answer is B\n\nInput: The population of a town is 1,000 people. Choices:  A. Half goes to a new restaurant. B. Some goes to the new movie. C. None goes to the new movie D. None goes to the old restaurant.\nOutput: Noone ever goes to the old restaurant if the population of the town is 1, 000 people.\nChoices A, B and D are impossible because going to a new restaurant or movie for the entire population would mean that no one would stay at home.\nWe can therefore eliminate A, B and D.\nBut because they live on a small island a few hundred miles north of New Zealand, not everyone on the island goes to the other island and some people always stay on the main island.\nThe population of the island would keep growing after people travel there, and it can never grow to a size that surpasses the size of the original island.\nTherefore, I choose option C.\n\nInput: A group of 20 people go into a movie theater. They are seated in six sections: the first section has three people in it, the second section has four, and so on. There are empty seats between each group and every group has one more person than there are seats. If each group does not sit in the same seats for every movie, in how many ways can the groups be arranged in the section?\nOutput: There is one empty seat because there were 20 people in the movie and only 19 seats available. The first seat holds three people and the second seat holds four people. That leaves seven people for section 3 and four for section 4.\nSo there are 7 + 4 * 3 = <<7+4*3=28>>28 ways a group can arrange itself in each section.\nThen there are (28) + (28) +... (28) = <<28+28+....28=1048576>>107,048,576 ways a group can arange themselves in all of the sections.\nSo the final question is: <<107,000,000>>1,070,000,OOO ways.\nWe would get the answer to be 1,216 if we did this.", "answer": "A: contagious"}
{"text": "Billy's bouncing off of the target wall which is closest to A, so he must be in the PLAYROOM for 23.\nIf Billy was at the pool table, he definitely wouldn't be  bouncing off the target wall closest to A. This riddle is tricky because he is bouncing the ball off of a wall.  This means that you must think about the walls that Billy is NOT closest to.  Since Billy is closest to the wall that is a target, this means that Billy is not in E--a closet.  Since Billy is in the PLAYROO, this means he is never at the pool table and NEVER at the playroom D.  This takes care of both possible answers for B--a toy box.  If Billy was in the toy box or playroom, he would be able to see his target and bounce the ball off of his target.  This eliminates the playroom D and the toy box B as answers.  Choosing only your answers B and C, you should be able to narrow down your answers to ONLY B and C.  This leaves you only with the playroom and the park E.\n\nInput: John flies to Paris by airplane, but he doesn\u2019t fly by airplane alone.  How does he fly to Paris?

How many pearls does she start with?\nOutput: We know Caitlyn sold 7/8 of her pears and has 7 remaining. This means that Caitlyn started with 7/8 of an unequal number of pears (because 7/8 is greater than 7). It is unclear how many pearls Caitlyn started with, so she must start with 7 and 8 additional.\nFrom here, the answer can be found with a simple equation:\n(7 + 8) / (7/8 of the original)\n15 / 9 = <<15/9=1.66>>1.66\nCaitlyn started with 13 pearls. She sold 9 of her pearls, that leaves her with 4, 9, and 13. She starts with 13 remaining.\nShe sells 9/13 of her pearls and must have another 4/13 = <<4/13=0.31>>0.31 pears (the left over).\nSo Caitlyn starts with:\n4+9+13+4 = <<4+9+15=32>>31 pearls\nSo the final answer\nis 32\n\nInput: John was very curious about the number of pears grown on one pear tree.

At this new watering hole, there is only enough water for three adult elephants. For the next 15 days, the elephants will drink equal amounts of water every day and won't drink any water after that. The next watering hole will have enough water, but by how much?\nOutput:We can assume that the elephants will come back in 15 days since they won't come back until they run out of water. So, each elephant will drink 5 water every day. Then, the elephants drink 15 * 5 = <<15*5=75>>75 from their full water. Now, each elephant has drank a total of 75 water. When they come back, to see how much less is in the tank we subtract it from the full 75, which is 75 - 75 = <<75-75=0>>5 water.\nSince the 75 is the last number we divided and it has a remainder of zero, which means the amount that is left in the tank after drinking is 0. Then, multiplied that number by the number before zero (75) is 0. This is because we take away what we got in the whole and multiply it by the whole. It comes up with 0, which is our amount that we saved which is 0.

{"text": "A: A grand casino has a lot of potential in holding receptions. There is plenty of space in a grand casino to hold a large reception with many people attiring. So the answer is A.\nB: A large room is ideal for a reception as there is the capacity to hold many people. However, the large room does not have the potential for a large amount of people to attend.\nC: A restaurant is not a good choice for a reception where there are a large amount of potential guests attending. Most restaurants are smaller in size and can hardly hold a large amount of crowds. So a reception is not held in a restaurant.\nD: A country club may hold many people but the capacity for it to hold a large amount of people might not be high enough. So a country club is not the ideal place for a reception.\nE: The lobby does not have the capacity to hold a reception.

If the flies in the pond reproduce on average 1 every 15 minutes, then how long will it take for the flies to multiply until they outnumber the frogs?\nOutput: I was hoping for an extra 80, but this is not bad.  Let me break it down for you.  First, I have the frogs eating up to 75 flies a day.  The flies multiply by themselves at around 1.3 every 15 minutes.  As a result, the flies increase to around 1235.  Next, the frogs eat up to 75 of those.  That leaves us with 1235 - 75 = 1160.  Now, what does 1160 represent?  This would mean that the 2160 flies (which was a constant I was using at the time) are multiplying by themselves every 11 minutes.  Now what happens if you multiple 75, the number of flies the frogs can eat every 15 minutes by 11, the new amount of time for the flys to multiply themselves?

{"idx": 44, "text": "B. Choices and Explanations\nA: Being too full from eating too much is likely to slow down your digestive process and increase the time between each mouthful.  Since your digestive tract doesn't work as fast as it could, it'll also slow down how quickly your body absorbs the nutrients from your food. Your stomach will start to produce more acidic food, and will also slow down in the release of enzymes.  This will make you feel like you're stuffed, and will also create stomach pain.\nB: Being too full from overeating will put pressure on the stomach and cause acid reflux. This is because of the increase of acid production inside the stomach, it will irritate the esophagus and will force the food up to the throat. The acid will irritate the throat and can cause coughing, choking, sneezing, and nose-bleeding.  And if the acid flows all the way back to the mouth and lips, it may be painful.\nC: Stuffed stomach with too much food will be painful. And if the food has been eaten too fast and the body isn\u2019t prepared for the food it is getting, then this will result in stomach ache.  The stomach has natural acid in it, which is used to reduce any germs in food to help keep the body healthy. However too much stomach acid can lead to heartburn and acid reflux.\nD: Overeating could make you feel bloated and sick.  Your body will try very hard to digest what you have eaten if you eat too much. You will still need to digest lots of meals, and it may take several hours to digest your food.  This may result in nausea, headache, diarrhea, bad breath, abdominal pain, and heartburn.  However this will also speed up your metabolism and will make you feel less tired.\nE: If you eat too much overeating and drinking too much could cause stomach pain and heartburn.  Too much food and drink can cause acid reflux and heartburn.  This causes food and stomach contents to move up to the esophagus, as the lower esophage", "answer": "C: stomach ache"}

But when he's feeling crabby, he will only eat a raw oyster if another oyster is lying nearby. When he's feeling extra crabby, he eats a raw oyster whether or not another oyster is nearby. How many raw oysters eaten during a time when the crab is feeling crabby is equivalent to stealing?\nOutput:  A good question to start is is it more expensive for a restauranteur to provide a crab steak or 100 oysters?\n If it's cheaper to provide the crab steak, then it's profitable for a restauranteur  to just give away raw oysters for free!\n But raw oysters are more expensive to provide for.  So this question is asking about the cost to the crab of eating a raw oyster.\n If oysters are priced as 1 raw oyster + 1 crabby mood, then we have a linear equation of 1 + m = a*m representing the amount of crabby mood.\n\nSolving this we find a = 1, b = 3, and m = -1\n\nThe function which represents the crab's eating is y = -1*x\n\nLet n = raw steak eaten\nThen n = e-2*1 = e-2 = e-3\ne = 2.718 + 1 means n = 2.7 e = 3.2 which is the same value you get for 100 oasteters eaten:\nSo, the crab eats two and a third steaks to gain the equivalent of stealing a raw oaster\n So the final answer in C.\n\nInput: If your favorite number is 7, the most beautiful number would be the natural number 7.

Later, at 5:11 AM, I bought snacks at the same caf\u00e9, which totalled 45 cents. At this point, the total cost was $2.40. How much did my favorite dish cost?\nOutput: First, find the cost of snacks: $0.45\nThen, figure out how many 0.45s are in 0.95: 95 cents / 0.45 = 20.97 (rounded to 30), meaning that the snacks cost 30 cents.\nFinally, find the cost of the dish: $0.55 - $0.45 = $0.10, since it costs 0.10 less.\nSo the final dish cost 0.10\n\nInput: In a game of Connect 4, a 13-block horizontal strategy will win every time if it can succeed 33% of the time against a 3-block vertical strategy (32.9 of the time if the game was played on all sizes of board). If a 13- and 32.9-block horizontal strategy has equal odds, what percent of the time do horizontal lines win against vertical lines?\nOutput: Let's figure out the odds. A 32.9% strategy is 57.1% likely, and a 33% one is 66.6% likely (since it is impossible for 2 strategies to be exactly 33% equal).\nThen, a 33% strategy is 66.7% likely over a 57.1%, since a 6 of 9 is 66.36% (that is, a 6 of 10).\nSo the odds of a 3-block vs 13-block line are 71.\nSo one-seventh of the time, the lines will win if they go against the 3-block lines (so, about 8.6%).\nSo they will win 100/12 = <<100", "answer": "A: disorientation"}

Red has 250 votes, green has 90, and blue has 103.

It was a simple recipe. First, I made sure that the water was boiling. Second, I threw in the penne. Once it was all in, I lowered the heat and boiled it for around 8 minutes. After that, I put it in the strainer for a couple of minutes to drain it off. Next, I took out two of the frying pans. In one of them, we put some olive oil heated onto a medium heat. While that was warming up, we made sure to rinse the penne so it was fully cooked. Once the oil was warm, I threw the penne in the pan and kept it warm.

Choices: 1: Apple pie 2: American flag 3: The Eiffel Tower 4: U.S. flag 5: Star 6: Starbucks 7: A night sky 8: A constellation\nOutput: The answer is \"The Eiffel Tower\".\nLet's say that you take away one star from the Eiffel Tower. This leaves 14 stars remaining. You are required to continue removing stars until the Eiffel Tower has less than 13 stars, and in this case, you will be removing one star at a time, so you can assume that this process only involves taking out one star at a time.\nYou remove the 14th star and you are left with 13 stars; however, if you consider removing the very last star, the Eiffel Tower now has exactly 13 stars. If you consider removing any other star, then there will always be a number of stars left that will have exactly 13 stars left (for example 12, 11, 10, 9...).\nYou are only able to leave with 1 star, so if you took away any one of the remaining stars, then the Eiffel Tower will no longer have any stars left; hence, the answer is \"The EIFFEL TOWER\"\n\nInput: How long on average does it take you to eat a meal on your first day of a vacation?

He has a flat for $8.50 and a cup of yogurt for $5.50 but no coffee or sugar. If he pays with a $10 and a $5, how many extra dollars does he need?\nOutput: First, find the cost of one loaf of bread, that's $5/loaf. If he bought five loaves, he paid $5*5=$<<5*5=25>>$25.  Then find the cost the bread. $25+5.50+8.50=$<<25+5.00+8.5=68.50>>$68.50.  The man paid $68.50 and has only $10 and $5.  He needs $68.5-$10-$5=$<<685-10-5=53>>$53.

What proportion of universities accept less students than the average?\nOutput: 72% accept at least 97% students so that leaves 28% (72% - 97%) who don\u2019t accept almost all applicants. So that gives us an average of : (28/100)x[(72%,7/10)] which gives us an average of about 7/10 for 86% of them and the remaining average of about 6.5/10. Now using the conditional probability formula we can get the probability that all accept under 6.5%. So all accept <6.5% : [(28/10)/][(72%,7/[10])*(1,6.5/)](1,6.5/[145/10]) *(1,65/[144/10]) * (28/15).

How many miles will separat the two bodies at the start of their next orbit? The two bodies started off 1080 feet apart, and it takes one year for an earthly day and one month for an earthly month, but this works out to one year, four months, and sixteen days, because it takes a bit longer for the sun and the moon to complete an orbit. The moon's orbit takes a total of 4821 months to complete. How many miles will they be apart?\nOutput: To find the length of the moon's orbit, multiply 365 by 12 which = 4320, but to get the actual distance add the first length (10800) to the second length (4320).

If a restaurant serves 5 pizzaes in every 6 mints (every 10 minutes) can serve 240 in a hour.\nSo the restaurant can serve 24*2 = <<24*2=48>>48 pizzaes in a hour.\nThe restaurant can also serve 1600 pizzaes in a 9 hours (60*160=9600).\nTherefore the restaurant can serve at least 480 pizzaes (24*18 = <<24*18", "answer": "B: high school"}

If he adds a $2 20-minute labor charge, and offers to deliver free, will he sell enough?\nOutput: If the average price for the man's chainsaw parts is 650$, and the profit is 15%, then we use the formula, Profit margin = (Price - Cost) / Price - Cost = (650-515)/650 = <<650-5=10>>5%.\nThe profit margin shows that he made 5% profit.\nSince profit margin x 100 = 5%, then he wants to double his profit of 5%, so the price of the parts needs to be 150% of original, which is 1.5.\nAdding a 20 minute labor charge to $650, gives him a new price of 670$.\nAlso, if he sells the parts for 670$ without adding the 20$ labor charge, he will make 5% profit, which is the same percentage as if he added the labor charge to the original price of 650$.\nTherefore, increasing the price by 150% will give his profit", "answer": "D: pain"}

Choices: \nA: melting ice B: mixing vinegar with baking soda C: dissolving sugar in water D: pouring out the water after boiling the rice E: cooking an egg.\nOutput: Melting ice is clearly an exothermic process since it produces heat (melting ice requires heat).\nAlso note that when boiling water the water itself becomes hot, meaning that we can't really separate the heat it used from the heat it produced. So water needs to be boiled and then used to do this reaction in order to be an exothermic one and the cooking of the egg is what produces the heat and then we use it, hence cooking the egg is the exothermic process.\nSimilarly vinegar+baking soda produces a gas called bubbles, which then escapes into the air, producing heat to the air and hence cooling that air, making the reaction exothermic.\nSo the correct answers are B and E\n\nInput: Dogs are smarter than cats, and cats are smarter than mice.

When it does kill something, it eats about a quarter of it on the spot before discarding the rest. How much food will the wolf typically carry?\nOutput: The wolf spends about 75% of its time catching food on average. So let's figure out how long it takes the wolf to consume a quarter of the food it catches on average.\nThe fraction 1/4 will be converted into a decimal form 1/4. After the division operation we get 0.25\nSo the time to consume the quarter of the food is 240 seconds or 4 minutes\nAfter discarding the food when the wolf finishes consuming the quarter of the food he/she catches, the remaining food will be 0.75 of it.\nSo the wolf will leave with the remaining 0.75 X 4 = <<0.75*4=3>>3 food in his/her possession\nSo the final answer will be 3\n\nInput: What do only some types of water do?

Then, for any future years, he'll pay half of what he paid the previous year.\nDolly will spend the first year as follows:\n(156+4) * ((x+1)/2) * (x+1)\n(x+1)/2 * (x+1)*(x+1)\nx^3\nx^3*1\nx^3*2\nx^3*3\nx^3/16\nx^3/4\nx^3/8\n...\nSo, in year 1:\n((156+4)/2) * ((3+1)/2)\n(128*2)\n128\nIf this recurrence is repeated x times, you get:\n(128)^x\n16777216 (128^x)\n128^x\n\\end{code}\n\nNote how `x^x` occurs.\n\nNote how `8` is only used 5 times and `9` is only used 3 times.\n\nNote how a similar `x^3` pattern can be seen.\n\nThese are all possible patterns in recursive logic.\n\nIf you are in recursive logic, then when you get to the top level, you have to return something.\n\nAsk the top level what it returned.

We want $y$, the amount in ounces (a unit of measure) needed to be sold at $x$. Then:\n\n$y = x$.\n\nOur equation is:\n\n$\\begin{align}\ny &= x \\\\\np &= x + 50 \\\\\ny &= \\frac{p}{x + 50} \\\\\np &= xy\n\\end{align}$\n\nThe second line was derived from the fact that $y$ is the amount needed to be sold. The quantity of bacon sold is simply equal to the price. We rearrange the equation like so to find $y$:\n\n$\\begin{aligned}\np &= pxy \\\\\n50 &= xy(x + 50) \\\\\n50y + xy &= xy \\\\\n\\color{Blue}{\\text{(Multiply)}} && 50y + x(x + 5)\\color{Blue}{\\text{ = xy ~.}}\n\\end{aligned}$\n\nFactoring out $x$ for $y$, we get:\n\n$\\begin {aligned}\n\\color{Blue}{y(\\frac{50}{x + 5}) = x ~~~~(1)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$\n\nSince we are finding the profits gained by the price increase, we care about the numerator alone. We plug in the original price and see that it is less than the new one.

Each car travels on different roads at different speeds.  Two cars are meeting each other, and the first car is travelling on 2 roads and the second car is travelling on one road, with a fixed time and distance between them.  If the first car were travelling on one road and the second car on one road, they would meet in T+D hours and D distance,  if both are travelling on two roads, they will meet T time earlier and T less distance. How big could N be?\nOutput: There's a few possibilities here.  We'll look to model the distance the cars travel in a day; and the distances will differ since they'll only meet once a day.  For the meeting, we'll consider that we can represent the meeting time + distance in 1 of 3 ways:\n\n<code>\nt1 + d1 -> t1 + (t2 - t1) + d1\nt2 + t1 + d1 -> (t2 + t1) + d2\n(t0 + t1 + t2) + d1 -> (d0 + t1) + t2 + d3\n<code>\n\nBy subtracting t2-t1 from the second one, we can factorise the first one away from the second.  And by subtracting t0 + t1 from the third, we can factorise that away too.  So, we can write the equation for how many cars in a single day:\n\n<code>= (c", "answer": "B: singing"}

How many people buy a VIP ticket if they have been buying economy tickets before?\nOutput: 68% of people buy the same ticket they have bought before.\n68% means that 68% of 100 is the number of people who buy economy tickets\nTherefore, 100 * 0.68 = <<100*0.68=68>>68 people buy economy tickets and hence, 100% of the economy tickets are sold\nSince 68% of those people buy the same ticket, 68/68 which rounds to 1 to 100% (since the answer already has 100%), means that 100-68/68 = <<1-4=3>>3 people buy VIP tickets and hence, VIP tickets are sold\n\nInput: A car wash charges the same for a single-wash service as a complete detail.

Divisible because 5 + 5 = 10 2nd example is 2 + 2= 4 3rd example is 9 + 9  but 9 / 2 = 4 which means 9 = 2n 4th example is 18 +18 which = 36, and 36 / 2 = 18. So 18 has to be a perfect square.\nSo if both of those are true then every number is divisible 2. 1st example is 10 / 3 = 3 which means 10 = 3n 2nd example is every number is divisible because if you add it up = 11 which means 11 is divisible by 3. 3rd example is every number is because 18 / 5 = 3 and 3 is divisible to 5. 4th example = 36 / 5 = 7 and 7 is a prime number so 7 can't be divided by any numbers so 7 is divisible by 5.\n\nSo every number is even because you add something and you subtract something and it equals the same number like", "answer": "B: cemetary"}

On the first week, he was the 85th best athlete in the country. On the second week, Sam improved to the 65th best. Each week he has to improve by at least one place from the previous week to remain in the top 100. How many weeks did he have to play the sport before he reached the top 10?\nOutput: Sam started with the 85th place. After the first week, he became the 65th. Now, since the condition requires him to improve by one place every week(or else he got eliminated), he can't just stay in the 65th place after the first week, so he should improve by one place. After two weeks, he should be in the 84th place. Because of the same condition, he can't just remain in place, so he should improve one place again. After three weeks, he should be at the 83rd place. Now he just has to improve by one place in each week until the 10th week where he will reach the top 10. This means that he will at most play the sport for 10 weeks.\nTherefore, the answer is: 10\n\nInput: What happens after the end of the universe?\nOutput: Nothing, because the universe is infinite\n\nInput: My father makes 600/365 times more money than we make.

He leaves $200 for his wife to spend and $100 to each of his children. How much does the wife get to spend?\nOutput: The wife has to spend $200. The children each have $100 to spend. The man leaves only $200 - ($100 * 5) = <<200-$100*5=100>>80 for the wife to spend.\nTherefore, the wife receives the amount $200 - 80 = <<200-80=120>>3/5 of the man's money.\nSince there are 5 children, it takes 5 / 3 or 5/3 children to receive $100.\nTherefore, each child receives $50.\nSo, the final answer is $200 - $100*5/3 + (100*5)/3 = <<200-(100*5*3/3)=18>>.\n\nInput: Two men are walking.

Cost = 330 euros Storage space = 4.5 GB processor Speed (milliseconds per operation) =1.8 Storage space per 1000 operations = 0.3 kilobytes per 100 kilobytes = 0.03 percent per 100 megabytes = 0.3 percent per 1 gigabyte So the price of the phone is 330 times 1.8 = <<330*1.8=604>>604, and the 4.5 GB of storage is 4500 GB * 0.03 = <<4500*0.03=145>>145 GB of storage. We just need to find the speed. Now how many times does the phone need to do a thing, to  do one time of operation? 1 (one) divided by 1 (one) = <<1/1>>1. 0.03% is to get the price. Then 1/0.03 = 3.33 times as much as it needs to do and it will be 100% speed. So the speed is 1000/(100*3.33) = <<1000/(3.33*100)>><333.01> times as much as it is. So the speed is about 331 times as fast as it needs to be. That means the one millisecond per operation is 331/100=<3.31> times as fast as it it needs to be for it to do 1 thing 100 operations in a 1 second. So the phone does <3.31> in 1 second it will do 100 operations, which means 5000000 in a 2 seconds. That means it will do 166 million in 1 in a 2 seconds and 332 million in 1 in 4 seconds.

How much did you spend?\nOutput: First: Eight new computers: $3000 <| >> 1/8 of new computers: $100\nThen: total cost for buying new computers: 100 + 100 +100 +1 + 1 + 1 +1 +1 +1 = $<<100*8=800>>80\nThis is the total buying cost for new computers.\nYou pay 1/8 of all the cost: ((1/8/2 = <<1/8/2=1>>)/2) +((1/8/2)/3) +((1/ 8/2)/4) +((1/5)/ 6) +((1/6)/7) + ((1/7/8})). This value is 0.125 + 0.122 + 0.100 + 0.07 = 0.437. Then multiply each value with 8: 0.123x0.125x0.122x0.100x0.07x0.07 = $<<0.123*0.125*0.122*0.100*0.07=0.112>>0.112 Therefore, the total you pay is 0.112 x 8 = 0.089\nThen divide with number of new computers: 0.088 / 8 = 0,011, so total price for all new computers is $1,100.\nSo the answer is 1,100\n\nInput : Which movie should you see?

{"idx": 899, "text": "The answer is (A).  In English 'the' usually means someone or something, and it can be used before either nouns (in front of a number of words) or personal pronouns (the student, The king, etc). The's' and 'talk' and'read book' are just adjectives, so they come after the nouns - not in front of them. 'Study book' is a sentence, where'study' is a verb (which is a word that shows action) and 'book' is a noun. So it comes after 'book' and not after the 'the'. 'The student' is a noun and adjective phrase, or a noun phrase, where the is used before it (not after the noun or pronoun). Finally, 'the' cannot be used before the word 'engineering', as it is not a noun: it is a noun-phrase (made up of the word 'engineering' followed by the word 'is' as a link between two phrases, or words).\nSo the answer is (A).\n\nInput: A new app allows restaurants to take orders online.

There is 30% rule so: If it\u2019s not raining there are 8 people that want water. If it\u2019s raining there are 6 people that want water. Campers can bring water with them from home. If they do, there will only be 5 campers looking for water each day. You have to bring 8 gallons to camp to have 30 percent. If it\u2019s not a 30% rule day, that means 3 campers need to bring 8 gallon jugs. If it\u2019s a 30% day you only have to get 5 campers to bring 8 gallongs and then you have enough water till the next 30% rule.\nOutput: The water rule is 8 is only taken if it is not cloudy outside, if it is cloudy then everyone needs to bring 5 gallons. So when is cloudy the campers should bring either 5 gallons if there are 8 people or 8 gallons if there are only 5 people.

Dick makes two moves: a king's bishop's rook's move followed by a queen's bishop's knight's move. Tom's turn is next. How will he have to move to capture Dick?\nOutput: The King's Bishop's Rook's move consists of moving the King two spaces and the Bishop and Rook one space each, so the move is RBKB.\nThe Queen's Bishop's Knight's move consists of knighting the Queen and the Bishop one space each, so that's NKBNB.\nOn his turn, Tom will move, so he needs to find any piece of Dick's so that if he moves a bishop or knight, the move will be captured. He can only move one space any of Dick's pieces, so let's write those moves as a string separated by spaces B B K B K N K.\nThe king can always capture the queen when the queen moves one space, which is what Tom did to Dick. The bishop can only be captured in two cases: when the bishop moves one space and then the king moves any distance, or when the bishop moves one then the queen moves one and then the king captures the bishop. The knight can be captured by any of the four combinations of moves for the bishops and can also be captured by the king if he moves one space followed by any move.\nTherefore, Tom moves RRRR because:\nR: The king captures the queen the bishop moves one space\nR: The king moves two spaces and captures the bishop knighting it one space\nR: the bishop captures the knight\nR: the king captures the knight the bishop moves two spaces\nR: the king moves two spaces and the bishop moves two spaces capturing the knight\nRRRR: The king capturing every piece of Dick's\nSo the", "answer": "C: small group"}

{"idx": 968, "text": "According to Wikipedia, The history of the banjo dates far back to the 17th century where it was known as \"Fretless Banjos\". This led to music styles such as the Irish, Scottish and American styles. These are also known as 3 Finger style playing because they do not have a plectrum (pick) which other styles do. This makes a 5-string Banjo look similar to a Ukulele. The next stage in the Banjo's history came during the 18th and 19th centuries where African slaves in the U.S. introduced their banjo playing style, which was a combination of a banjo and dance styles. This created dance styles such as the Virginia Reel, which was made famous by Irish and French-Canadian dances.\nDuring the war years in the 19th century people started leaving the Southern States, along with their traditional ways of playing.\nAt this time there were a few artists who kept the music style alive, such as the \"Banjo Sullivan Brothers\" who wrote the song \"My Old Kentucky Home\", which was a tune made famous by Stephen Foster in 1852.

{"text": "### Input\n  Choices:  A\n\n### Response\n\nIn this question you should be very careful because it is quite common for people to confuse, what is required by the programmer, with what is required by the user. When you are confronted with a question that is similar to one you have answered previously, this often happens.\nThe question asked:\u201ci like to examine different\u201d things, this can be true, but not in the same sense as it might be intended.\n\n\u201ci like TO examine different THINGS\u201d as in examine the different things that come into work for example.\nThis is much more appropriate I think. Your task is not to select an option to answer a question or to choose something, but it is to select things to examine and thus in this case the user (you) should examine different things.\n\n### Input Choices: B,C,D,E\n\n### Response;\n\nThis seems to be a question about your preference, but this can be answered in your own way. In this question, you are looking for the right answer to an obvious, but somewhat tricky question. The thing is that no one will ever ask you this question, but you will most likely answer it correctly.\nThe question says that you have to answer the question \u201cwhy do books the chap-books\u201d? This is the question, but if you look carefully, you will notice that it is just missing an \u201cs\u201d. This is a very similar mistake to the one you have made previously except this time it is even more common and therefore more likely to happen.\n\nTo answer this question, you should know that there is only one possible answer for the first sentence. If you know this answer, then you will answer this question. The answer is that books are chapters. If you don\u2019t know this answer, then there is no way to answer the question \u201chow do books the chapters\u201d?\n\n### Input A & B\n\n### Response \u201cI like to examine different things\u201d\n\nAs mentioned before this is a question about your preference. You should not select an option to answer this question, as there is only one right answer and you should always select the true one. For example, if you have the choice between \u201cI like to examine books\u201d or \u201cI like to examine paper\u201d, then you should take the better option.\n\n### What does \"choices\" mean", "answer": "D: read book"}

Water coolers are usually well trafficked area with people and therefore many chances to be exposed to various forms of liquid.\n\nOther types of liquid commonly associated with high traffic/exposure areas would be bathrooms. The reason is similar for both water coolers and bathrooms.  People gather at these locations to get to their work-related tasks more quickly.  This is important because people generally only stop at these locations for short periods of time. Also, it is important to note that there are many liquids that one would find inside a business other than water.  It is very unlikely that someone would want to consume water from their water cooler. However, one would assume that they would drink water from their toilet.\n\nIn the workplace, bathrooms are one of the only areas that are consistently used for personal-use tasks and not for work.

Another one is B where the supermarket is a great option to find food. Another one is C, because this person probably lives in a building where it's hard to find food, but there is an amenity within the building where there is a restaurant or a market etc. Then there is E and this is like an apartment which means where it's not public and I don't know if public is talking about places that people can go and find food unless its a hotel. And the last one D refers to me more a place conference because it's a place where people attend meetings, have an event, etc but again you don't find food there unless there is a caterer.

This glass is wide at the bottom so that liquids do not slosh over the top of the glass when you are enjoying a drink.  It was originally used to drink cognac (which is a spirit derived from fermented grapes), which is now called brandy.  The cognac is aged in casks usually for twelve years.  As cognac is consumed in more or less equal amounts by year, there is not a long lasting demand for the casks.  The casks were originally used to transport the product to market and they have developed their own name based on the company logo.  As the logos are stamped into the wood that remains in the cask as the spirit evaporates, each logomark, called \u2018l\u2019esprit\u2019, is an indication of the time that the cask has held the spirit.  The cask is sold to a brandy producer as is.  As the spirit remains in cask, the amount produced is reduced each year.\n\n### Resources:\n1.

He lives in a house that cost him $320 on a 20% down payment and he\u2019s been paying $7 for over three years. How much does he owe on his mortgage?\n\n### Solution\n\nThe first thing we know is that he lives in a house with three windows - and we are told that the total cost was $320. In each room we can have a single window, or two windows. So we must have two rooms with two windows and one room with a single window. The total cost is therefore $320, but two rooms with two windows cost more (so we know we do not have two rooms with two window), and if there are only two rooms then each window must cost $320/6, and thus each room with two windows have to cost $67. Including the cost of the one remaining window, the entire cost was $327.\n\nThe second thing we know is that the entire cost was $7 per month for over three years. That means we need to divide $327 by 36, and this tells us that Carl owe $9 per month for his mortgage.\n\n\n\n### Input \nThere are three cats on a boat.  There are three dogs on a dock.

{"text": "answer A authentic\n\nAnswer: The reason for A to be the correct answer is that you would have to be stupid to not know if a purse is designer or not. The bags might be real, but they are going to appear authentic. In other words, they are going to pass the test for being authentic. The definition of authentic means to be the \"original\". So if the item cannot pass the authentic test than it is not authentic. When you purchase a designer purse or designer anything for that matter, chances are it passed the authentic test and therefore is the ORIGINAL item. Therefore, \"a\" fits best as the answer choice.\n\n### Input :A group of 24 friends went on a picnic. Each friend ate 6 cups of soup.

You want to cut the rectangle into 4 squares. You want two squares to be 2\" larger on each side (length and width). How much wood would you need to be left over?\n\n### Output: You would need 5 square feet, correct.\n\n### This can be easily done by simply adding up the width and height left over from the 2\" extra and dividing that figure by 2,\n\n### It would be 42 square inches, which becomes 2.64 square feet, and so on.\n\n### The reason why this is 2.64 instead of 2 is due to the extra dimension of height because it would 4 instead of 3, and because of 1 square foot there are 1.33 square feet. This can be seen in the following formula which we can call simply the formula for 2x2x1\n\n### So there is (2x2x1) = 8 square inches (4 x 2) where each one of these is 1.333333 times because of the height so that is (1.333 x 4 x 2). We get 2.666 square inches like we got here. It then becomes (2.666 x 2) which gives us 5.33 square inches.

However, if you\u2019re planning a trip to a beach you shouldn\u2019t plan to wear your favorite shirt and shoes to feel comfortable cause that will surely get you wet.

A graph is a diagram which has a horizontal and a vertical axis. While the axis doesn\u2019t have labels, it has lines, and numbers. On the other hand, a table doesn\u2019t have a diagram but a table is a list of data arranged into rows and columns. The data can be shown in a numerical form or in terms of categories. The advantage of a table is that is is easily comparable to other tables because you know exactly where to go for each data. The advantage of a graph is that a graph help us better understand data. For example, if there are a lot of numbers in the tables but you know that they are the numbers of students, so a graph will be better to understand the data.\n\n### Input;\n\nExplain the purpose of a table and the purpose of a graph.\n\n### Reponse:\n\nIt is important to use tables and graphs in a report to make an explanation more clear and effective.

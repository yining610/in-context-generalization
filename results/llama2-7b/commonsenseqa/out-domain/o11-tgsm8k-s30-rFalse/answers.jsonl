The code you write should be correct, beautiful, and readable. You may only use the standard libraries available for Python in your program, and you should not use the standard libraries in any way that is not explicitly specified.\n\n###Constraints\n\n- Only integer literals will be used in your program\n- All numbers used in you program should be in scientific notation so that when the value is a very large or a very small number, it looks more consistent\n- You have two methods for performing arithmetic in your program: addition and multiplication\n- The `+` sign will add the two numbers together to produce a single integer. You can think of this function as the equivalent of normal integer addition.\n- The `*` sign will multiply two numbers together to produce another number, and this number will have an exponent value of 10.\n\n###Input Validation and Parameter Inspection\n\nIn your program, you will receive inputs, and those inputs will be tested against some rules. You will have a global `validate`, which handles this checking (other methods may also be used). Here are the rules for your program:\n\n- The inputs will always come in as integers\n- The inputs will be between some minimum value and some maximum value\n- You may use any of the built-in functions for mathematical operations\n- Each parameter to a function call must have some", "answer": "A: think"}

The general idea is to come up with a way to model the problem or questions and then to develop some way to generate answers.\n\nOne approach is to create a flowchart that identifies the different operations to perform.  In this case, we could have a box for \u201cdetermine the number of children in the house\u201d, a box for \u201cnumber of children\u201d, a box for \u201cboys\u201d, a box for \u201cgirls\u201d, and a box for \u201ccosts\u201d and connect the different boxes with arrows showing the relationships (such as the number of children goes into the \u201cnumber of children\u201d box, and then the \u201cnumber of children\u201d, \u201cboys\u201d, and \u201cgirls\u201d boxes go into the cost box).  This allows us to see at a very high level how we can do the calculations.  Since each box has its own operations, we may have to do different calculations for the different boxes and this may get confusing.\n\nAnother way would be to use a loop instead of a flowchart.  A loop can be thought of as a loop \u201cfrom here to wherever\u201d.  For each \u201cwherever\u201d, we perform an operation on data.  The idea here is to come up with operations that create an answer based on input.  In general, we often use a loop to iterate multiple times and come up with an accumulated answer by doing a lot of different small operations on data.  These kinds of loops are often found in programming languages where you might use a \u201cfor\u201d loop, a \u201cwhile\u201d loop, or a \u201cfor each\u201d loop to iterate and then perform operations.\n\nThese are only two examples of ways you can think of to solve any kind of problem.", "answer": "D: somber"}

Therefore: 55% is less than 50%, so we need to subtract 55% from 35% in order to get the number of lesser carrots: (50% - 55% = 5%).\nTherefore, we only need to get the number of greater carrots (100% - 50% + 5%)\nThe greater carrots: 101.\nSince the greaters are 101, the lesser must be 78.\n\n\nInput: We have:\n3 different beds. = 3 beds.\n55% of 3 is 55, so 55 carroots are already taken for bed 1\n101 carroots are left over, and they have to be taken from the 2 other beds with 45% (or 4/5 in percentage)\nSo we need to take 45% of 60 + 1 to make 101. = 1.65\nSince you can't take more than half of a carrot, we can use only.82 carrots, to make 1.65.\nSo we take the.8 left and add that to 78, and you have your answer.\n\n\nInput #1: The sum of the first two fractions:\n25 + 3 +.17 + 515 + 169.85 =1594.85\nThe percentage of the bill is:\n1594.98/180 = 8.99\nThe cost of the ambulance ride is:\n1700", "answer": "D: school"}

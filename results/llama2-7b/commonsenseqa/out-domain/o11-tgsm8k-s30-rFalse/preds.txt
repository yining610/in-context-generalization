When you are confronted with a question that is similar to one you have answered previously, this often happens.<n>The question asked:“i like to examine different” things, this can be true, but not in the same sense as it might be intended.<n><n>“i like TO examine different THINGS” as in examine the different things that come into work for example.<n>This is much more appropriate I think. Your task is not to select an option to answer a question or to choose something, but it is to select things to examine and thus in this case the user (you) should examine different things.<n><n>### Input Choices: B,C,D,E<n><n>### Response;<n><n>This seems to be a question about your preference, but this can be answered in your own way. In this question, you are looking for the right answer to an obvious, but somewhat tricky question. The thing is that no one will ever ask you this question, but you will most likely answer it correctly.<n>The question says that you have to answer the question “why do books the chap-books”? This is the question, but if you look carefully, you will notice that it is just missing an “s”. This is a very similar mistake to the one you have made previously except this time it is even more common and therefore more likely to happen.<n><n>To answer this question, you should know that there is only one possible answer for the first sentence. If you know this answer, then you will answer this question. The answer is that books are chapters. If you don’t know this answer, then there is no way to answer the question “how do books the chapters”?<n><n>### Input A & B<n><n>### Response “I like to examine different things”<n><n>As mentioned before this is a question about your preference. You should not select an option to answer this question, as there is only one right answer and you should always select the true one. For example, if you have the choice between “I like to examine books” or “I like to examine paper”, then you should take the better option.<n><n>### What does "choices" mean

Choices:  A: water cooler B: opera C: hospital D: hockey game E: beach<n><n>### Response:		Choices:  A & B<n><n>If I had to chose one of the above choices, I would choose A.  Water coolers are usually well trafficked area with people and therefore many chances to be exposed to various forms of liquid.<n><n>Other types of liquid commonly associated with high traffic/exposure areas would be bathrooms. The reason is similar for both water coolers and bathrooms.  People gather at these locations to get to their work-related tasks more quickly.  This is important because people generally only stop at these locations for short periods of time. Also, it is important to note that there are many liquids that one would find inside a business other than water.  It is very unlikely that someone would want to consume water from their water cooler. However, one would assume that they would drink water from their toilet.<n><n>In the workplace, bathrooms are one of the only areas that are consistently used for personal-use tasks and not for work. (Those people who are working in an office setting would not spend much time in a bathroom, unless it's to use the restroom.) However, one would assume bathrooms are commonly used for personal-use. Because of the nature of using it for personal-use, one may see bathrooms as places where people may not be in a sanitary environment.<n>

Choices:  A: opera B: supermarket C: building D: conference E: apartment<n><n>### Response:		I think this question is referring to the location of where people find food. But I'm confused about what are the options. I believe the correct answer is A since opera is a performing arts theater and it's mostly for entertainment and not for food and not much to find food unless you order a coffee or a drink. Another one is B where the supermarket is a great option to find food. Another one is C, because this person probably lives in a building where it's hard to find food, but there is an amenity within the building where there is a restaurant or a market etc. Then there is E and this is like an apartment which means where it's not public and I don't know if public is talking about places that people can go and find food unless its a hotel. And the last one D refers to me more a place conference because it's a place where people attend meetings, have an event, etc but again you don't find food there unless there is a caterer. I don't really understand this question because is asking where people are likely to find food.<n><n>### Rationale:<n><n>#### Comment:The instruction is confusing, but in general the answer I gave in the response is where someone is most likely to find food.

This glass is wide at the bottom so that liquids do not slosh over the top of the glass when you are enjoying a drink.  It was originally used to drink cognac (which is a spirit derived from fermented grapes), which is now called brandy.  The cognac is aged in casks usually for twelve years.  As cognac is consumed in more or less equal amounts by year, there is not a long lasting demand for the casks.  The casks were originally used to transport the product to market and they have developed their own name based on the company logo.  As the logos are stamped into the wood that remains in the cask as the spirit evaporates, each logomark, called ‘l’esprit’, is an indication of the time that the cask has held the spirit.  The cask is sold to a brandy producer as is.  As the spirit remains in cask, the amount produced is reduced each year.<n><n>### Resources:<n>1.

If 139 students will perform in the play, and the teacher wants each child to perform for more than 1 minute, what is the maximum time in minutes that the teacher can allow each child to perform, in minutes?<n><n>### Option:1<n><n>### Option 2<n><n>### Option3<n><n>### Option4<n><n>### Option5<n><n>### Option6<n><n>### Output:<n><n>### Conclusive:<n><n>### EVALUATION:<n>Explain your answer using the mathematical method demonstrated and explain the strategy used in the solution.<n><n>### Hints<n><n>In the 1st option you need to first figure out what 139 is a remainder if divided by 13. The answer is 10. To get the remainder if 10 is divided by 14 gives us 4 (the remainder for 10 divided by 14 by 14 minus 4 gives us 12). The solution is option B. In the second option you could try to see when (5*13)/14=0 is. You could easily do this by looking at your calculator or you can write out the first part and then think you can get the second part you just divided it by 5 and 4 respectively. In the third option, you can easily see that they don’t want to spend any part of the 10k and you can easily see that 100 is the amount of money they need to spend. Option four is the same as the second option, you want to see when (5n+3)/14=O and you can easily see this by dividing by 5 and 3 respectively. The fifth option is the same with the fourth option you want to see if n is a remainder for 10K, then you can easily find the remainder if (5n+3) is divided by 16. In the sixth option, you are given the equation of x, and you are given the difference between 1700-x, your solution is to use x=798. In the seventh option, you want to first simplify the ratio to 1/2 by dividing. Then you can divide the remaining amount

You are to start at point A and move around the lot using the streets as your guide.  The streets in the parking lot begin at the intersection of A and B and go through every intersection along the lot.  There are two lanes in the parking lot—east and west.  Traveling from A to C will always be in an eastward direction.  The parking lot is laid out so that the driver is looking behind the car as they drive.  If any intersection does not have a stop sign, mark “T” for through.  If any intersection is a stop sign, mark an “S”.  When you reach an intersection where a car is parked, you have reached the location of the car.  Each intersection that does not have a car marked off will be denoted with the letter “X”.<n>How are we to answer this question?<n><n>### Input Choices<n><n>### Output: Which of the choices best describes the diagram?<n><n>### Demostration:<n>I will get started by making the appropriate decision to continue the journey and then write the appropriate output.<n>I am driving A then B then C (since it is to the east) (mark stop signs)<n>1st intersection is D - this means there is no T or X (since the stop signs could have been an S, T or X<n>2nd Intersection is E - this means there is an X (since stop signs could have been T, X or S)<n>3rd Intersection is F (marked T, this would not be marked with an X since this would mean traveling in the wrong direction)<n>4th Intersection is G - marked and so marked as an X since this is the first time T was not marked, so this means that the T was marked before the S (since stop signs could not be marked with an T and S in the same intersection)<n>5th or 4th intersection was marked with an S - marked as an X since no stop signs could have been marked (since the only stop signs would be T and X)<n>6th intersection marked T - again

He lives in a house that cost him $320 on a 20% down payment and he’s been paying $7 for over three years. How much does he owe on his mortgage?<n><n>### Solution<n><n>The first thing we know is that he lives in a house with three windows - and we are told that the total cost was $320. In each room we can have a single window, or two windows. So we must have two rooms with two windows and one room with a single window. The total cost is therefore $320, but two rooms with two windows cost more (so we know we do not have two rooms with two window), and if there are only two rooms then each window must cost $320/6, and thus each room with two windows have to cost $67. Including the cost of the one remaining window, the entire cost was $327.<n><n>The second thing we know is that the entire cost was $7 per month for over three years. That means we need to divide $327 by 36, and this tells us that Carl owe $9 per month for his mortgage.<n><n><n><n>### Input <n>There are three cats on a boat.  There are three dogs on a dock.  Each day the cats give $2 to the dock and the dock gives $0.25 to the cats.  How much do the cats spend in one day? <n><n>### Solution <n><n>The total amount of cats and dogs is the same, so it is even.  The spendings of each day is calculated as follows: <n>```<n>Cat:<n>   Day_1: $0.25 + $300<n>   Day_2: $0.24 + $360<n>       ...<n>Dock:<n>   Day_0: $0<n>   Day_1 : $0.50<n>   Day_3: $1.00 + $1600 <n>   Day_8: $1.50 + $2400<n>               ...<n>```<n><n>The amounts for day n are the sum of the previous n-1 days

The government has budgeted $2.5 million dollars to construct the additional lane. It will charge commuters $1.00 per hour to drive on the additional lane. The $2.5 million will cover the construction of the new lane as well as the overhead for enforcement. The government expects commuters to pay approximately $6.00 per day to drive on the additional highway lane. How much revenue, in dollars, does the government expect to generate from the additional lane? What, if anything, should they do in response to the unexpected shortfall?<n><n>### Response<n><n>In this scenario the government needs to spend $2.5M to build the extra lane. This will cover the $6M in revenue from the 20 hour work day. This would suggest that the government needs to add additional lanes to the highway to improve the flow of traffic and to increase the revenue.

If each dog can lie down 16 hours a day where possible, how many hours can all dogs lie down in one day?<n>```<n>```<n>The answer is 20, the correct answer is 64<n>This question asks for the amount of space that the dogs take up when they are lying down: 16 * 2 = 32 sq meters. And for the number of hours each dog can lie down per day: 24 * 16 dogs = 384 hours. So the dogs could each lie down in 10 hours each day.<n>But when all 16 dogs are lying down in the same day, the space of 32 is not divided among the dog but each takes 2 squared meters. For the same amount of space, each dog can now lie down for 64 hours.<n>```<n><n><n>### Inputs and Results for problem 35<n><n>```<n>Input: In a school, there are 12 kids.

Choices:  A: actions B: legal C: authentic D: logical E: legitimate<n><n>### Response:		answer A authentic<n><n>Answer: The reason for A to be the correct answer is that you would have to be stupid to not know if a purse is designer or not. The bags might be real, but they are going to appear authentic. In other words, they are going to pass the test for being authentic. The definition of authentic means to be the "original". So if the item cannot pass the authentic test than it is not authentic. When you purchase a designer purse or designer anything for that matter, chances are it passed the authentic test and therefore is the ORIGINAL item. Therefore, "a" fits best as the answer choice.<n><n>### Input :A group of 24 friends went on a picnic. Each friend ate 6 cups of soup. How many cups of soup were bought?<n>### Response:answer D<n><n>### The response is: D) 12 cups.<n><n>The reason for D is the correct answer is that by the time the group of 24 people ate 6 pieces of bread, they would most likely make a dent. I don't believe a bread lasts for that long. The response with the least amount of math was D, but was also the answer choice with the correct answer. I can see why B would be correct, but 18 would put them over by 3 and the group of 28 would be eating less than a cup each, which did not apply.

Choices:  A: pond B: underwater C: aquarium D: lake superior E: body of water<n><n>### Response:		It's a lake superior, correct. The surface of which this all happens is just cold and not the water itself. I'm not sure whether this is the best answer but it's what I believe.<n><n>### Inputs:You have a rectangle that is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 1 foot tall. You want to cut the rectangle into 4 squares. You want two squares to be 2" larger on each side (length and width). How much wood would you need to be left over?<n><n>### Output: You would need 5 square feet, correct.<n><n>### This can be easily done by simply adding up the width and height left over from the 2" extra and dividing that figure by 2,<n><n>### It would be 42 square inches, which becomes 2.64 square feet, and so on.<n><n>### The reason why this is 2.64 instead of 2 is due to the extra dimension of height because it would 4 instead of 3, and because of 1 square foot there are 1.33 square feet. This can be seen in the following formula which we can call simply the formula for 2x2x1<n><n>### So there is (2x2x1) = 8 square inches (4 x 2) where each one of these is 1.333333 times because of the height so that is (1.333 x 4 x 2). We get 2.666 square inches like we got here. It then becomes (2.666 x 2) which gives us 5.33 square inches. So the last square inch is just the last one so it is 5 square inches so there are 2.640 square feet left.<n><n># Tutoring<n><n>## Introduction<n><n>This is a document I use to tutor my students in Math 015, which is a non-technical algebra course.

It was sunny with no wind and the clouds were a clear blue. You were standing on the boardwalk eating some ice cream and enjoying the scenery. A few moments later the smell of smoke engulfed you and you knew a fire had just started. There were not many fire trucks at the scene but the ones that were there did their best to extinguish the flames. You soon found yourself near the source of the fire so you headed for the parking lot and then you went the back way out of town. As you headed through the back roads you were startled to see flames shooting up at you. Just then a car pulled up behind you and you decided to get into it. It was the same man who you had just been talking to at the ice cream parlor. You both headed for the police station and informed the chief who called in a fire truck that was just coming to the area to extinguish this fire. It was so lucky it was that day a few cars over there was a fire truck on the job.<n>

In each succeeding round, he throws one more baseball than the number of strikes and balls from that round. For example, after the first round of pitching, the lineup is: 1st round: 3 balls, 3 strikes = 1 pitch at bat. After the second round, the lineup is 4 balls, 4 strikes, which means a pitch that results in a strike, no matter how many balls were thrown.  If the batter is awarded a walk after 6 pitches, the next batter would face 7 pitches.  When a hitter leads off an inning by getting on base due to poor fielding on a hit or walk or hit by a pitch, it is said that he scores an "intentional walk" or in some instances, an "unintentional walk."  Determine, from the information provided, the total number of pitches in a game that includes 6 innings and a 2-hour broadcast.<n><n>### Response

Choices:  A: wear shoes B: learn C: hope for peace D: have a great day. E: do well<n><n>### Response:		<n>There are many types of store and each of these types of stores have different requirements of what people who are walking into their shops should wear. For example, at a bank people walk into wearing casual, or formal clothes to feel more comfortable while they’re at the bank to talk to the bank officer. However, if you’re planning a trip to a beach you shouldn’t plan to wear your favorite shirt and shoes to feel comfortable cause that will surely get you wet. That’s why you should wear your beach clothes. Also, you shouldn’t wear your jeans on a trip to a beach either. But, if you were planning a trip to an office or a bank you should wear what you are used to wear during your daily life at work. So, all these places are different and should get a different type of clothes. <n><n>### Input : Explain the difference between a graph and tables.<n><n>### Response :<n><n>A graph and a table are similar to each other but there are some differences between them. A graph is a diagram which has a horizontal and a vertical axis. While the axis doesn’t have labels, it has lines, and numbers. On the other hand, a table doesn’t have a diagram but a table is a list of data arranged into rows and columns. The data can be shown in a numerical form or in terms of categories. The advantage of a table is that is is easily comparable to other tables because you know exactly where to go for each data. The advantage of a graph is that a graph help us better understand data. For example, if there are a lot of numbers in the tables but you know that they are the numbers of students, so a graph will be better to understand the data.<n><n>### Input;<n><n>Explain the purpose of a table and the purpose of a graph.<n><n>### Reponse:<n><n>It is important to use tables and graphs in a report to make an explanation more clear and effective. Tables are great to add a summary of data in a table. It is easier to see, compare and analyze data this way. For example, you want to find out which sports are used in the USA. We take data from the following link, and we group the sports in two parts. Then, we draw a table of the frequency.<n>[https://www.statista.com/statistics/222098/favor

Choices:  A: redemption B: isolation C: absolution D: great relief E: feel better<n><n>### Response:		Forgiving is about redemption.  A person who has been harmed by someone should try to understand the motive of the other and forgive them in that they were trying to help the other person.  In other words, they were hurting you because they care.  It is easy to forgive someone who has done you wrong because they have hurt you, but it takes a lot of strength to forgive someone who did wrong because it was to protect you, or help you.  That person was protecting you, in their opinion, from further harm or embarrassment.  They may not have thought of it the same way you do but that is their perspective.  They may feel responsible for you, and that is why they did what they did.  They were protecting you.  Do you want a weak person who is not strong enough to protect themself?  I think not.

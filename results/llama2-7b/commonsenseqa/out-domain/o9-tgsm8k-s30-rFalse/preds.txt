The total number of boys in the school is 680.  If the boys are given 228$, how much money does each student receive? Choices:  a: 200$  b: 228$  c: 130$  d: 159$ e: 239<n><n>### Response : b<n><n><n>### Explanation: The total number of students is 680 and the ratio of boys to boys is 9 to 677.

Since that is an inproper fractions, therefore the last step is to convert the fraction into whole numbers. Therefore, 228 is divided by 9 to give you 25 and 25 plus 27 is 52. <n><n>### Input  : A hurricane storm is approaching the southern coast.  It’s likely to dump up to 30 inches of rain.

Choices:  A: illinois B: woods C: new york D: indiana E: farmer's market<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is "f"<n><n>### Example:The woman picked from the apple tree while surrounded by pears trees, where was she?.<n><n>### Explanation<n>A woman bought two apples from a farmer's market.  The bill came to $4.16.  This was two dollars more than the woman wanted to give so rather than pay with cash she paid for her apples with apple cash.  This apple cash is an apples equivalent currency.  So to pay the two dollars the woman gave two apples to the farmer.  So the farmer had $6.32 on hand which covered the cost of the apples but left him with $6.32 remaining for himself after he had given the apples away and left him with 2 apples.  It is then safe to assume that the remaining apples were from the farmer's own tree.  The woman went home to eat one of the apples.  Upon arriving home the woman realized that she had one apple left unaccounted for.  She then realized that the other apple had mysteriously disappeared.  It was at that moment that the woman knew she must have been surrounded by pear trees.  The apple cash then was a pear equivalent currency because rather than paying with two dollars the payment was done with two pears.<n><n>

Choices:  A: liberal B: heretical C: recalcitrant D: conservadox E: heretical<n><n>### Response:		C<n>#### Answers:<n><n>A:  Conservadox would mean that he is on the conservative side of the orthodox or traditional end of a belief.  Liberals want to be on the more-libertine end.  Heretical would mean that he was pushing for a different kind of belief than that which was orthodox or traditional. Re-calcitrant would mean that he insisted on continuing to behave in a way that was considered reprobate.  The priest was Orthodox, so he wanted his parishioners to follow traditional beliefs.  Since we know he is orthodox, that leaves Heretical and Heretical. Heretical is the correct answer because she pushed for heretical behaviors.  <n><n><n><n><n><n>

It was a what? Choices:  A: countryside B: anthology C: dull read D: state park E: surface of earth<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>>A. Anthology<n>><n>>>Explanation:<n>><n>>>An anthology is an extensive collection of works by different authors compiled into a single volume, usually in the same genre and with some common features.  We could classify this as a countryside show but it is also an anthology because the second show was a follow up.<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>>Above I explained that the second show was a countryside so if the show is about the countryside then surely the second show is also.<n><n>### Inputs:<n>A number needs to be factored into a prime number.<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>>1. Put numbers 2-7 into factor Tree (with a base of 2).<n><n>>2. Pick a number (e.g. 3) and look through your tree looking for multiples of 2 and multiples of 3.<n><n>>3. If you found one then cross out the 2 and the 3.<n><n>### Constraints:<n>This problem is using a prime factor tree to factor a number by a number less than the factor being searched.<n><n>### Example:<n>Given number is 7<n><n>Let’s look at which numbers in the prime factor tree are a factor of seven<n><n>**2-7**<n><n>**2 = 4 x1 = 1 x 7**<n><n>**3 = 6 x1 = 6**<n><n>**5 = 7 x1 = 7**<n><n>Based on the information in the prime factor tree and the answer to this number, I can say that this is a prime number.<n>

This is because they could not be seen in a library if they were not in the building at the time.<n><n>###  Input: Choose the correct answer of the following:<n><n>### Choice1: 1) A city of a million people is usually much larger than a town of the same size.  2) A college is larger than a university. 3) A metropolis is larger than a megacity.   4) An empire is larger than an axis government.<n><n>### Choic2: 5) One of the most popular sports is football.  6) In the winter Olympics many people participate in figure skating.  7) In the summer Olympics there are many gymnastics.  8) Swimming is one of the oldest sports. <n><n>### Choices3: 0) A football is the most difficult skill to learn and a 90 mph pitch is the fastest pitch in baseball.  10) The most intense part of training for track is running hills.  11) 1 point in a game is worth more than 1 point in a basketball game.  12) The 1980 Winter Olympics had a total of 100 countries participate.  <n><n>### Resp:The only choices that are not incorrect are choices 2, 3, and 8 because sports are not on a linear scale and it is not possible to be more "sport like" than someone else, just better. Choices 1 and 4 are incorrect, however, because there is no indication of population or the size of government.<n><n>##

And the person looking for a rental car might consider going to another company based on the first company's pricing.<n><n>### **Explanation:** As demonstrated in the example, the answer is not A: Because the word "cold" is not a description of the skin's response to being pinched. The word "pressure" is not related to the pricing that the car-rental company charges. The word "bumpy" means something that is irregular or uneven in shape. The word "itchy" is just the opposite, a response that skin would have, that is, the sense of touch that results in a tickling sensation.

A chicken weighed 200 grams.  One ton of feed was worth $21.69.  If each chicken ate 15 grams of feed per day, how many days did the chicken eat the feed?<n>### Constructured-response: The correct answer is 304.  Because one ton of feed is worth approximately one quarter of the total value of each feed bag, the 40th ton of feed, when multiplied by 25 chicknens per ton (which is equivalent to 10 tons per truck) yields an amount of 100.  Ten tons makes one quarter of one ton of food.  Multiply that by the 25 and you arrive at 250, then divide it by 100 and you get 2.5.  Multiply 2.5 times 36 to arrive at 90, divided by 10

Suppose that the first contestant in a given game is standing on the thumb of her hand. She places her fingers in such a way that her thumb and each of her index fingers form an arrow pointing outward and they can be joined together to form a plus sign inside her hand. The contestant places her fingers in this configuration on the blackboard in hopes of receiving a prize. However, she is incorrect. Her guess of “thumb” is incorrect. The answer is actually “hand,” which the studio audience correctly yells. As the next contestant enters the studio and stands on the stage, the host has no choice but to begin again with the first contestant, and continues the questioning-and-answer game until the correct answer is guessed, as the contestants are allowed only one chance to get the answer right. Assume that the game lasts 90 seconds. Suppose the number of incorrect guesses made by each contestant is Poisson-distributed, with mean λ. In a hypothetical scenario, how many correct guesses must be made before the game is ended, on average?<n>### In a football game, the quarterback is going to give the team a call at the line of scrimmage as the team starts to do a hand-off, a pass, a punt.

Cows don' eat all day they drink water and they eat alot of hay.<n>\*If there is no cow there is no milk for the farmer to sell. So the farmer would go to an animal supply store and buy a new cow.<n>\*I think that you need some food.

Choices:  A: no go B: unlikely C: unable D: cant do E: impossibility<n><n>### Response:		The response should be a single choice statement that provides the best (appropriate) choice choice from the choices.<n><n>### Difficulty Level:Easy<n><n>### Explanation:<n>This is a straightforward problem. The user was asking for the simplest activities a fat man is unable to do. Therefore, the choices were that he is **no go**, **unlikely**, **unable**, or possibly **impossible** to do those activities.<n><n>Because the man was fat, we can rule out the choices of "unlikely" or "unable" since those seem too vague and unclear. If he were not fat, then he would be able to do activities that others do. So we can rule out those choices as well. This leaves us with just three choices. He could be no go. This means that he would not even try any of these activities. The next option is to say that he is "impossible" which clearly means that he is unable to do any of these activities. This would imply that he is fat. This was the best answer.

So homeless is eliminated from the choices. Then plain is eliminated also, because it's still not the most expensive. Then, we eliminate the choice that is not rich people, which is C needy, D needy, E homeless.<n>

This will mean that you are now the one who has done the trip and there will be no confusion as to the time.<n><n>### Input : The company charged $181 to produce 3,000 bags of potato chips and $175 to produce 4,000 buns.

Choices:  A: remember B: help C: count D: winning E: dealing<n><n>### Response:		 D or  a<n>### Demonstation:<n>Lillie and her sister are playing cards against each other.  In an attempt to win, Lillie puts on her brother’s glasses and does some counting of the cards.  Is that illegal under the casino rules?<n>### Explanation:<n>Counting cards while playing a card game is illegal, even if the people are family.  It's cheating.  Counting cards is not illegal, only if it occurs at a casino is it illegal.<n><n>### Answer:<n>The answer is D<n><n>### Demosntration:<n><n>Betty and her friends have been betting on a game on Sundays. It seemed like she was always the loser because she always bet too much. Betty decided she needed a new strategy to help her succeed. So, on Sundays she brought along another friend to help her count her bets and decide when she was ahead enough that she shouldn’t bet anymore. Was this plan legal? Under the casino’s rules, would it work?<n><n>Explanation:<n>The plan that Betty had was legal and she was able to win.  However, some people would not do it because it seems unfair and against the rules of the casino.<n><n>### Example:  A: yes B: No<n>### Demonstation:<n><n>Alice's mother has an aunt who is a terrible poker player and is always the one who ends up with the short end of the deal.

Were Alice and her mother in violation of the casino's rules for allowing her aunt to bet, since she was in the car?<n> <n>### Explanations and Example:<n>I believe that the answer to the question would be A or B because a woman does not need to have any license to drive, so, it would be legal for anyone to drive an older woman to a casino. However, I believe that the owner of the casino would not like the idea either and would find a way to make it illegal. That being said I don't believe that the owner is against the idea.<n><n>---<n><n>### Response<n>It appears to me

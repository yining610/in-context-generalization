The idea of a programming problem is to think logically about how the computer, as a machine, is going to look at what you give it, and do what you want it do to.  To practice this, here are a few programming problems to think about.  I put these together from a programming problem book called Head First Python.<n><n>- In a classroom there are 35 students, there are 15 girls and 20 boys. If the ratio of boys to girls is 3:5. If a student with ID #88 is in the class, who does the student's classmate have to be?<n>- A toy factory makes a pair of plastic toy cowboy horses.  The plastic cowboy horses sold at a discount of 25%. Each toy horse is painted by hand and sold for $8.  The assembly line costs $45,000 to buy and set up.  The plastic and paint only cost $2 each, and the assembly line cost $15,000. How much profit does each horse sell for?<n>- Jared is a waiter at a restaurant who makes $50,000 each year. The restaurant makes $1,500,000 total in the year.  There are 3 waiters at the restaurant plus Jared. How much does Jared earn each year?<n>- Mary has three pairs of underwear. They are all red, blue, and green. They are numbered 1 through 6.  Which pair is blue and red?<n>These aren't problems in the code sense (meaning that you're going to write Python as in code in them).  However, the answers to these puzzles should help you think about how you are reading the words as a computer would receive them.<n>

Therefore the total driving time can be found by taking 3600/20 which give a total of 180. Another way that this problem can be solved is using the second to last equation which helps figure out the number of days to transport a given mass. Then this number can be plugged into the first equation. Another way to find the number of days is to find the number of miles that need to be travel from point A to point B, then just divide the total number of miles by the speed in both equations which can be simplified as 60/60 mph or just one.<n><n>### Explination: We can calculate the money that Melissa spent on driving by looking at the third equation, taking 3 hours out of 24, we get 1 hour. If we do this 12 times we get 12 hours. Then we multiply the time spent by the hourly amount in dollars and we find 12x1x72 or 864 total dollars.<n><n>### Explaination: The cost of food is 175 dollars so the rest of the amount can found using the last equation by taking 175 from 1330 or by plugging in 1155 into the third equation to get 27%.<n><n>### Explaination: In order to find the number of pounds we can use the following formula (6x1)+5x5+1x1 = 12+25+1 = 48  So the total amount of pounds is 48. We can find how many pounds were pulled from the first bed by multiplying the amount of carrots that were pulled out and the weight(1x55) or 55, for the second bed we multiply (101x1) x55 and for the third bed we multipy 78x55.<n><n>### In order to solve the

Choices:  A: auditioning B: hear sounds C: listening to music D: making music E: arthritis<n>Output:		The correct answer is hear sounds. Hearing sounds is something done by hearing. Listening is doing something through your ears. Playing music is an action someone does. Auditioning is when someone is being observed for a job. Making music is something a person does, such as playing an instrument. Arthritis is a medical condition that involves pain in the joints of the body. You may be tempted to write in hearing sounds as “the right answer,” since it might make sense that the answer they are hearing are sounds, but this is incorrect. The answer is hear sounds.<n><n>Input:Milo said he would not do a task if he was getting paid 10 dollars.  What is the value of:  56?<n>Output: 976<n>Input:The sum of two numbers is 12.  The difference of the sum and the bigger number is 6.  What are the two numbers?<n>Output: 0<n><n>Input:If a dog weighs 5 kg, then it is a puppy. If the dog weighs 70kg, then it is a man.  If it is neither a puppy nor a man, then it is an old dog. If it is old, then it is neither an old dog nor a puppy.  The dog on the photo is neither a puppy or a man.  What is the dog's weight?<n>Output:  You may first guess that the weight of the dog is 35kg. This will cause you to start working the problem as follows:<n>1. If you take the 35kg and subtract the smaller number of the "smaller number and the bigger number are".<n>2. Since the numbers subtracted are 35-12, therefore we subtract the smaller from the bigger: 35-6 = 29.  29 minus the bigger number which is 70, so we divide by 70 to get 29% or 29/70. This is not the answer provided.<n>3. Notice that we have come to an equation where we have 29/7 which will be the solution to the problem. We want 29% of 70, but we are finding 29, not 29%, nor are we finding 29 in the denominator. The answer provided is still 0.<n><n><n>

The answer to the first problem is $310 because she rented the car for 11th of a week days, and the charge for a day is $30, totaling to 310 dollars.<n><n>2.  Because the amount of times the trip has to be made equals twice because of the animals, the total number of hours is one-and-a-half times 3x, which = 45, the total time to get all of the cows from the ranch to a higher place of safety.<n><n>3. The answer to this problem is 72 hours because 14 days multiplied 60 minutes/day equals 840 minutes, which can then be divided by 24 to get 35 hours, which can be reduced to 72 hours. <n><n>4.  In the bill there are 5 different expenses. The first is the medication and it takes up 3,333 ⅓ ration of the bill. Since ⅓ of 5 = 1666 that should be multiplied times 5000. This will give us the amount of money the medication expense is equal to. Adding this to the other expenses we find that the total out of pocket expense. In this problem it happens to be $4933.34 which is equal to: \((0.5)(0.25)(0.175)(166)(1667) - 5000\). This makes our final answer is equal of 47 dollars and 33 cents.<n><n>5.  To find the total weight we must first find the weights of the carrots. This can be found by taking (55) + (101) + (78) and multiplying it by 6.  This will give us a total weight of 3+80+416 = 540 lbs<n><n>6.  If the 3 uncles and the 4 aunts each have 2 children then the total combined number of people will be 16 + (8) + (16) + (12) = 60.<n>7.  The answer is $15,250 because: 5

He only had $3.25 to spend on the fish. After finding out that the fish were $1 more than he had to spend, Jason got angry. Jason’s emotional response was to buy some apples instead. After realizing apples cost less than fish, Jason decided to buy fish and apples. How much does Jason spend on apples?<n><n>**Output:3.99**<n><n>### Conclusion<n><n>This test requires more than one step to complete.<n><n>### Explanation<n><n>In order to complete this test you need to understand what is being asked of you. You have to read the question you are being asked, which should help you as you begin to write down your response. From there you have to come up with an appropriate answer, and decide if you need to check it with the system.<n><n>## Step 4:  Summary and Next Steps<n><n>After working through these three examples it is clear that this can be a more complicated way to interact with an AI. This would be especially useful for a customer who is trying to troubleshoot a problem, such as when they can't find an item in a store.<n>This process has shown that this type of interaction is not only possible, but easy to do if you know what you are doing. With that said, the next step for this project is to continue to develop an understanding for how different types of programs operate. Once the program knows what kind of information it needs to have in order to respond to the user’s question correctly, it is easier for new types  of questions (and their associated answers) to be added later on down the road.<n><n>### Next steps!<n><n>The next steps are to continue this

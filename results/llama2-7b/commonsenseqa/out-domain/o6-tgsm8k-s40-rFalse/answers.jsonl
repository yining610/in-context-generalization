Choices: A: 0-8,000 B: 8,000-24,000 C: 24,001-30,000\n\n### Response\n\nAnswer: The population is 42,040, so we are looking at the the intervals between [42,041 and 30,001), [42,001 and 8,001),  [8,001 and (42,049), and [0 to (42,090).

The information from August 12-13 is 80%, so 9/3 = 0.3 times 12 = 4, so 48%, minus 40% leaves a 4/12 =.33 = 0.

Many people who are not aware of how to do their own work, and are unaware of the different ways that they can work, they should get some help from their friends, or their community. They could also get help from a non-profit organization, or government, to find where they can get money.

The number of dogs is not a problem in the second question.\n* 1. the numbers should be the same in the two questions.\n\n### Solution:\nThe questions in the two tasks are related by the number of steps that can pass in each.  For the first task the answer is 5x.  For the second task the answer is 25x.\n\nFor the first task there are 3x.  For the last two tasks there is only 1x.\n\nThe difference in answers can be explained by understanding that there are five times as many in the first case and four times.  This is because there is more space to choose from.  In the case where there is a different number of selections to be made, it is possible to make one or the fewer selections available but impossible to make 5 or 25 selections available as in the first task.\n\n### What it teaches us about programming:\n\n*  It helps us to understand the difference between a linear sequence and a loop.\n*  It teaches us about creating loops.  The number of times a loop is set to a different value is usually the same that as the number of \"steps\" that can pass.\n*  It makes it clear that it is easy to break rules by misunderstanding the \"steps\" required.", "answer": "B: piggy bank"}

If it was a 24 hr time when at midnight, it will be more probable to chose 7:00:00. If it was an am time when the 7's came first, it should be able to pass for 7:30.  We then split it up from the two sides to find the different values for the 20.\n\nOne side will be all zero's, we can add two from the zero's. 1\n\nAnother side where there is one two, one four, and one eight, we can add 12 from the eight's. 12\n\nAnother side that has two sixes, we can add 7 from the one two. If the two sixes were not there, it should have been 6 + 2 from the zero's or 8 from the four. Then for that side's total we can add 7.\n\nSo that now has the three values of 20 where they are divisible by 2 that will go into the 7's range where the 5 was subtracted making 8, then we just have to compare with those values to check if it's actually divisible by 2. 18 is not divisible for 2 making the solution wrong.\n\n### Output:Based on the information in the above paragraph, what is the output?\nAnswer: 2 times 15", "answer": "B: binder"}

What is the difference between the two groups of women? \n2. Is it true that the women who ate fast food had more weight gain than the women who ate fresh? \n3. What would result in the greatest weight gain if all four hypotheses were true? \n4. What would result in no weight gain if all four hypothesis were true?\n\n5. The first hypothesis is not true because the women who ate the fast food gained 3 pounds more body fat than the women who aired them. The second hypothesis is false and the third hypothesis is false because the women aired women lost body weight more than the women who airt and that the women aired them lost the most body fat. The fourth hypothesis is not true because they lost more fat when they aired them compared to when they aired them. \n\n### Instructor Instructions \n1. Demonstration - ask a question and provide feedback to the student.\n\n### Answer:\n1. The women who ate fresh food lost more body weight in comparison to the women who ate processed food. \n\n2. Eating fast food will result in more weight gain because it requires more calories to process the food. When the body is processing the food that it is receiving, it uses up more calories than if it just ate the unprocessed food.\n\n3. Women who ate fast food would gain the most if all hypotheses were true. If the hypothesis is true and none of the women ate either fast food or fresh food, they would have the most weight gain. Eating that way would result in the least weight gain because there is less difference in calorie intake during that period.\n\n4.

This is the most frequently occurring number in the set.\nThe median of the set is the number that divides the set into two equal groups. The middle number of the set is evenly shared by the set. For example, if the set was 1, 5, 8, 11, 18, and 23, 5 would be the median value. The set would be parted equally: one part from the value of 8 and the other part from the value of11. The average is found by using these methods using a formula. You could use the mean or average to find the mode, and then you could use the mode to determine the arithmetic or geometric mean.\n\nIn statistics, mean is used in arithmetic and geometric mean. To find the mean of a set of numbers, you can add and divide.

{"text": "If the man set the cup on a table it must mean that there is no what to balance it, if in this question a what is not needed, it stands to reason that whatever he needed to balance the cup he didn't have.\n\n### Input\nThe man set the cup.  He lacked what to balance.   It didn't matter: he was a juggler.   Choices: A: tenacity B C: skill D: coaster E: breaking\n\nIt is possible to solve this question by considering which the subject is and what it does.  It took me very little time to see that the subject of sentence 3 is the same as the subject of sentence 1, both being \"the man\", and the verb tense (present continuous) shows that sentence 1 is in continuous time.  The present tense is also a clue, as the man is juggling.  But there could be more than one man, so we want to know which man.  And we need to know what juggling consists of.  Juggling is a skill, and the verb tense in sentence 2 shows that juggling is not continuous, but rather a single activity that the man is engaged in.  Therefore, the man in sentence 2 must be a performer, not the man in sentence 1, and there are three clues that rule out A since all three clues point to juggling skills being required \"to balance\" and not the tenacity of the juggler.  We now know the man has no what to balance.  We want to know what he lacks, and we notice that in sentence 1 the man does not have the \"whatever he needed to balance the... cup\".  There is no what in that sentence, and it would be silly to balance the cup with empty air, so what he lacks must be something that he needs to balance the cup.  The only what that seems relevant to the cup, is in the sentence after the one requiring juggling skills.  \"It didn't matter\", could be referring to a lack of what to balance the cup since it didn't matter how the cup was balanced.  So the man has no skill to balance the cup.\n\nBut what did the man lack that didn't matter?  If the man lacks something that doesn't matter to him, then he has what he la", "answer": "D: skill"}

So if you gave away 123 toothbrushess last month, then in March you'll give away half of the difference, or 61. Then in April, since you gave away 61 in March, you give away half the remainder, or 31 toothbrushes this month. In May, since you gave away half of the remainder in April, you give away half of that, or 15 toothbrushes every month. Then in May you give away your last toothbrushes so the busiest month lasts for a year while the slowest month goes from March to April. Therefore, you would give away 61, 31, 15 and so forth for a year.\n\nIn the third problem, Sally picks 10 seashells on day one, and then picks 3 seashells on each day following.

If the string is a palendrome, you should return the string name with \"yes\" and return \"true\".\n\n### Notes:\nCheck if the string only contains 9 characters by checking if it if length - 1 of length - 2 = 0\n\nIf you have to deal with reversing the string, do it inside of a function or in the same loop.

It takes 1/3 of your weight to keep you afloat. If you have 200 kg left and need to make it to shore, design a way to safely transport 5000 kg of sand to the shore without putting yourself into a greater danger.\n\n### Solution:\n\nThe first method is to throw sand in the air, catch it in a large empty container, and slowly push it as far as humanly possible. However, this method is quite dangerous and will not transport the 5000kg in one trip.\n\nI can only move at 50% capacity without overloading. 5000/(1/3) = 16,666kg. I will have to make many trips to shore with this method.\n\nNext, we can utilize the force of gravity to move sand. I must move to the shore first, then move the full 5000 back. Gravity will do the majority of the work. However, I will still need to push for a short distance to complete the task. I can only move at 1/3 capacity without overloading as well. 5001/3 = 16, 667kg.\n\nA third option is that I have two people on the lifeboat and can split the load. If we split the load by 2, than we can make it without any issues.\n\nI can then move the sand to the shoreline as needed.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the sand method is the safest to perform without risk of drowning, but also without causing injury.\n\nThere are further methods that can be", "answer": "D: parking garage"}

On the hour, each banana halves its speed.) The first banana reaches its destination in 23 minutes. What does all this mean?\nAnswer: It was either 212, 42, or 21, bananas.\n\n### Explanation:\nWhen bananas are doubled their speed, they will travel double the distance. Thus the 23rd banana must have traveled 46 times the original distance in the first hour.\n\nThen, when they are halved their speed they should have traveled 1/14 times the original distance in an hour. This means that the 21st of the bananas was at its location for 14/2= 7 hours.\n\nThe answer must be either 212 bananas if they started at 0 and they increased at a constant rate. Or 42 bananas if they had half the initial bananas.

Write a response based on the prompt that follows:\n\nThe NFL, like other sports leagues, generates income for its members, but it also uses that income for advertising and promotional purposes. These activities are not funded by admission fees or ticket prices.\nThe primary purpose of a nonprofit organization is to provide social services not to generate revenue.\nThe difference in the accounting policies of these two organizations is obvious.\n\nOne organization is a nonprofit public service corporation that does not directly generate revenue. It also does not report any revenue at all. The other organization uses its nonprofit status to generate revenue for its members. This revenue exceeds $11 billion annually.\n\n### Response\n\n#### What makes it fair or unfair?\n\nThe NFL and NFLPA are different in two fundamental ways: their purposes and their policies. The NFL does not provide public services for low-income citizens. In that respect, the NBA does not resemble the NFL. The NBA can provide a public service, but it does not make use of its nonprofit status.\n\nNBA revenue is mostly derived from broadcast rights and advertising. The NBA's broadcasting contracts are estimated to be worth about $2.5 billion annually. The NBA has a number of corporate sponsors but its sponsorship deals are relatively modest. It appears that the NBA's television ratings are low compared to the NFL. That is a major drawback for the NBA from a revenue perspective. The NBA faces a higher level", "answer": "E: errors"}

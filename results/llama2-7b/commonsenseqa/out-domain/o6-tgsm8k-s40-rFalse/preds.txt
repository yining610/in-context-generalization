Choices:  A: sun B: sky C: candle D: house E: lamp<n>Output:		E<n><n>### Explanation:A) In both the first and second questions the number of puppies can be calculated using the following formula: P=((2/3) x 30) + (4 x 20)<n><n>Here, 30 is the number of dogs which will be given to the dogs and 20 is the number of puppis which are given to the dogs. As the required number of puppies is 90 this can be calculated by using the simple formula P=90.<n><n><n><n>B) To calculate the number of patients in a month, Dr Banks can just subtract the first month and the last month to get the required number of patients in other months. I.e 80-330=250.<n><n><n>In the next step, Dr Banks will have to find the number of toothbrushes which will get left out in the busiest months (assuming these are 2 busiest months) and in the slowest month the number of tooth brushes he would get should be half the number of tooth Brushes he would get in the busiest month.The left over number of toothbrishes can be calculated by adding up to all the tooth Brushes that he has used in the slowest month.<n><n>C)<n>The easiest way to find how many  shadows are left is to just subtract 24 from 6 hours.<n><n>E)<n>This one is relatively straight forward since it is just a substitution method.<n>

Both of you want to drive up the road you are driving or the road you came down but due to being on a tight highway you can not drive more that 100 yards at a time.  The bus will always go down the road to the right of you and the bus can always have a certain maximum distance as can you so there is no fear of getting stuck behind it.  In every turn you must pass a bus coming towards you.  You both have to turn eventually and you know you both will because of a rule stating there are more cars on the road than you could drive up  If you want to drive up a road or down a road you have to decide before the bus gets to you what you want to do (because with the narrow roads it will take the bus the same distance to pass you either in front of or behind you and the bus will always pass you from the right).  If the bus is heading towards you and wants the road you are going to then you do not have to make a decision and you can wait.   Is it possible for a certain road to constantly be used, the bus will know to use this road (if it's the same as you can't turn) and if you do you will know beforehand, but sometimes will want to use a different road?   And If so how often? If it seems the probability will always work out just as well as with a random road?<n>Output: A<n><n>Input: The square is not filled in below.

For example, 130 is rounded down, but 135 is rounded up. If her final digit is 7, Susan rounds up. For example, 1736 is rounded up to 1737.  Susan subtracts five if it is even and subtracts four if it is not.  She then divides that number by two and adds five to that number. She adds the subtraction and division to get the answer. For example, 8291, Susan would subtract 7 because it is the final digit of an 8 which rounds to even and subtract 4 because it is not and so on.  She would then divide 2034 by 2 which gives 1017.  Susan would then add 5 for an answer of 1017+5= 1022.<n> Output: 1022<n><n>Input: A car is half as fast as a bus and twice as fast as a bike. A bike is twice as fast as a car.

It is fine if the classes you decide to use have no members or if there is any code associated with them.<n><n>###   Instruction: The program code of the java files should be pasted in the first file.<n>

In the given question there are 2 ways to reach the number 90. Either the numbers are 20 and 70 or the numbers are 50 and 40. There are more ways to reach 20 than there are to reach 50. Therefore, the number of doberman is 20.<n><n>In the second question there are two parts. 1.) Dr. Banks gave away one toothbrush in a given month. In all the months, the total number of toothbrushes given away are 330. Therefore, a.m. = 330. Secondly the formula is a*b/2 - x = 36. x + a*b = 72. x = 28. In the question, the output is 36. Therefore the numbers are 36 and 37.<n><n>In the third question Sally picks 20 seashells, on the day she stops she has 7 of them. If she can sell them for $1.2 per, she earns $7.8. The number is <n><n>In the 4th question Perry also has 4 fish. The question says that perry catches double what Jordan catches. If perry picked an extra 2 fish, then total = (1+4)+2 = 8. The second question says that they lost of the extra two. 7+6 =13. The final number is 13. In the question, they say they lose 25% or 1/4, but it does not say if this was from their original 20 of the first hour. Therefore, I calculated the equation as 50 * (25/4) = 62.5.<n><n>In the 5th question<n>We have:<n><n>There are 95 members.<n>We are subtracting 15 from the number of peruasions players.<n>The percussions = 55<n>The wind players are = 30. Then there is half the number of wind than the

B<n><n><n>### Instruction:Answer the given question on your own.<n><n>## Part One: Functions and Operators<n>In general, functions are processes that take some inputs and return outputs. For instance, if we have two real numbers $x$ and $y$, we can apply the addition function plus $x+y$ which results in a third real number, the addend. These real numbers are known as functions and the name is due to the similarity of functions to actual functions in every day life. <n><n>There are many different types of functions but we'll focus on *relation* functions because these are the ones that have to do with programming. A relation function is a function from one set of inputs into a second. A relation function could be the same thing as an input-output function if we only think about the input and output, forgetting that in most cases, there are multiple inputs. For mathematical examples, $y=x^2$ is a relation function from real numbers to real numbers while $h(x)=\sin^2 x$ is a relation function between real numbers. <n><n>### Problem Statement<n>How do you determine if something is a function from a set of input values into a set of output values?<n>### Solution<n>We can use a test to see if a function exists between the input (or domain) and output (or range). The test for a relation function has the following criteria: <n>* The input domain D is a set of values.<n>* The output range R is a set of values which in this case is the same as our input. Note that for the test for being a function to the same value, we can have many functions, each one a different input-output mapping.<n>* The output value changes for each input value.<n>* The output for a given input is unique.<n>All the above hold for functions between sets of numbers, but could be replaced by anything with domain and range sets instead of sets of numbers. Some problems might have some functions but not all. <n><n>## Part Two: Basic Combining Techniques<n>### Question<n>Which of the following would be considered a proper combination of the code segments? Choices:  (A) & (B) and (D)<n><n>### Problem<n>Suppose: $P_1=1$ and $P_2=2$. What is the probability of event $B

Each person takes two turns.<n>  To begin a hand, each participant gives his or her opponent cards of the player's choice. Two to four cards may be dealt this way in a single turn.<n>   The object of the game is to get to 121 points or more.  Cards are worth their face value: from 2 to 11, and from K to Q.  The aces count as 11, K as 4, and Q as 3.  Each player starts the game by setting out the left-most peg on the leftmost space in the cribbage board.<n>  The game is played in rounds.  If a player's total is less than 15, they take additional cards (until a total of 15 is reached).  Each round begins with a total score of a player's choice, up to 30, which will be used to total the points that player gains each round.  A player may reset their score after each turn in order to best play to their strengths in the next round.<n>   The winner is the player whose score is the highest in the last round.

Choices:  left right  forward back <n><n>Output: left <n><n>#### Explanation:<n>The first problem looks like a typical programming problem. But then when you figure out that the sum of the Doberman puppie and the Schnauzers equals 90 and there are 20 Doberman puppis, you get 55.  So 55 - 20 = 35. The solution for Schnauzers = 35+20+330/53 = 335, or 35. It's weird and it's obvious, but it's there.<n><n>The second problem is a tricky one. This one is supposed to be easier, but I'm not finding it easy, and it's a little confusing. He did 53 the first time, so that makes it 28, and for February he did 66, so that's 66, then for march, he did less than 53, so that's.66, plus the remaining. 66/.66 is 1, meaning he did 66 in the first part, and for April and May, he did.66, but I don't know how to do this one.

The program will be evaluated based on the following scoring:   - If 2 variables are compared and they have the same number as a result, the program will be awarded 1 point.   - If 2 operators are compared, (such as equal to, greater than, or less than), and the variables have different results, the program will be scored an extra point.   For example: 2 x 2 = 4   should return 0 points (0 x 0 = 0).  However, 2 x 2!= 5   should return 1 point (2 x 2!=).   - If 2 comparisons (such as comparing the same operand to several different expressions) are made and only one of the comparisons is correct,  then the program will receive a half point for that comparison.   - If a variable is compared to 0, the variable will be displayed and all points will be deducted.   For some examples, see the below: ```<n>44 / 8 =<n>6 / 2 = 1<n>4.0<n>0 / 4 =<n>19/ 8=1.125 * 8=1.902<n>42/12!=5<n>-1! 0<n>5!=0<n>6!=6<n>8!=2<n>10!=17```<n>Output: 6 = 2<n><n>### Instructions: Answer the following multiple choice question<n><n>Input: 5 friends split a cost of $18 between them, with Jen paying for lunch, Brian paying for dinner, etc.<n>How much did Brian pay?<n>Output: 2.66<n><n># Instructions:<n><n>```<n>Input:  5<n>Multiply the number by 2<n>Multiply the result by 3<n>Subtract the result by 4<n>Divide the result by 5<n>Subtract the answer to the last step by 6<n>Add the answer to the last 4 steps<n><n>```<n><n>### Instinct: Input: 210<n><n>### Output: 420<n><n># Instrucciones:<n><n>```<n><n>Input: <n><n>3+5<n>+3<n><n>Output: 8

Each group will produce a report totaling 5 pages when printed out. The teachers request that these reports are printed out on paper and are not required to be digital; if digital, then this means that the printing of the first page costs ten cents. It costs $0.75 per page over five pages per report.  If it is digital, then it costs fifty cents per page.  The cost of producing the reports is twenty-five cents on top of the printing costs. The cost to print each report on 100 pages of paper (as opposed to the 0.75 per five pages that would be digital) is 90 times the cost to print one page on paper.  If the cost of ink is $1.25, how much does the professor charge if she uses only digital prints and the reports are printed 50 pages, as a positive integer?<n>Output: 63.75<n><n>Input: Mr. Cake wants to make enough frosting for his cakes so that it takes 40 pounds for every ten pounds of frosting, giving him exactly one pound of frosting to give away for free per pound of cake, without having any frosting left over (if not enough frosting is given, there are no leftover frost-ings).

Since for each given number we need to consider only 5 numbers between the previous and the current answer, we can find the required output in 3 steps with only 3 extra comparisons.<n><n>b) The required output is a simple condition where the number of Schnauer is lesser than or equal to the required output. We iterate through each Doberman and each Schnauer, and in the end, we compare the output with the required output and return appropriate output.<n><n>c) The required output is just integer multiplication, i.e, the quotient, and we know that we can use integer division and remainder as well to get the same integer multiplication. We check for the remainder and divide by 3 when remainder is equal to 0. To prevent overlapping of time periods, we can first sort the integers from 0 to 31 inclusive, and then use the modulo operation to get the required output for the month.<n><n>d) First we check if the number is even or odd, if it doesn't we can't divide the number by two, if it is  even, we divide it by 2 to generate number until that point, if not, we multiply it by 5 to get the next value.<n><n>e) We can iterate over the list and check their values, this will give us the count.

The greatest mystery in the universe<n><n>Everything around us is made from the earth which goes round the sun. But what is inside and outside of universe? How the universe came into being? And how it will end. All these questions must be the greatest mystery in the world, because we can not even imagine this. The universe has been around for billions of years and for billions of years it will have been in existence. So, how is something which has been going on since the beginning of the universe will come to an end. The scientists have made out that it will always expanding until every speck of space is filled, but at the center of every galaxy the size shrinks. If the universe will have the tendency to start shrinking and then expand then I think it is going to end.<n><n>II. What do we know about the universe already in terms of the greatest mystery?<n><n>We are still in the learning phase. We have not actually found out the cause and end of the universe. We have just come to knowledge that the galaxy we are living in is billions of light years old. We can only know the end of the universe by calculating back all the variables and the exact speed at each point. Scientist

Each day it jumps over the same boulder a thousand times.  Then one day it does not jump over it. Why?<n>Rationales The antelope did not jump over the boulder because it already jumped over it 1000 times.<n>Answer: The antelope didnot jump over the boulders.<n><n>Answer: The lion doesnot eat an antelope.<n><n>Input: A cat has seven lives.  The cat is old and sick. Then it dies but gets resuscitated.  It lives four more days.  How many lives does it have after it has lived four days?<n>Rationales I know, there are 7 lives (or 8 lives) in the sentence, but they only count from zero.  We know the cat has 7 lives, but she has to lose one each time she dies.  Here is how it works:<n>  * The first time it dies, it's life nr. 7.<n>  * The cat does not die right away.  We assume that she survived the first time it died, which is why we're saying that 'it' has 7 lives after it has lived 3 days.<n>  * The second time it dies, it loses its life nr. 8 (if it had lost its life nr 8 the question would be: what if the cat has lost all eight lives?  Is it still alive?  The question is answered in section II.A below).<n>  * The third and fourth time it dies, it lose its lives on nr. 9 and 10.<n>  * So the question is:  How many lives does she have left after it has lived three days?<n>There are 7 lives (7*3=21) days  and it still had 5 lives left.  21, with the first day not counted. (It was already lost).<n><n>Input: What will you need to do with two apples

One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Rationales: For the nuts Adam paid 3 * $12 = $<<3*12=36>>36.<n>And for dried fruits Adam paid 2.5 * $8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20.<n>So in total for his purchases Adam paid $36 + $20 = $<<36+20=56>>56.<n>#### 56<n>Answer: 56<n><n>Input: Johns goes to the gym 3 times a week.  He spends 1 hour each day lifting weight. Additionally, he also spends a third of his weightlifting time warming up and doing cardio each day.  How many hours does he spend at the gym a week?<n>Rationales: He spends 60/3=<<60/3=20>>20 minutes warming up<n>So he spends 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes at the gym per day<n>That means he spends 80*3=<<80*3=240>>240 minutes at the gym<n>So he spends 240/60=<<240/60=4>>4 hours at the gym a week<n>#### 4<n>Answer: 4<n><n>Input: James has to refuel his plane.  It used to cost $200 to refill the tank.  He got an extra tank to double fuel capacity.  Fuel prices also went up by 20%.  How much does he pay now for fuel?<n>Rationales: The cost to fill a tank went up 200*.2=$<<200*.2=40>>40<n>So it cost 200+40=$<<200+40=240>>240 to fill the tank<n>That means he now pays 240*2=$<<240*2=480>>480<n>#### 480<n>Answer: 480<n><n>Input: The number of goals scored in a game against Barca by exactly two players last season accounts for 20% of all goals scored in the league. If the players scored an equal number of goals, and the total number of goals scored in the league against Barca that season is 300, calculate the number of goals each of the two players scored.<n>Rationales: If the total number of goals scored in the league that season against Barca is 300, the two players scored 20/100*300=<<300*20/100=60>>60 goals.<n>If the players scored an equal number of goals, each scored 60/2=<<60/2=30>>30 goals.<n>#### 30<n>Answer: 30<n><n>Input: Every day Tom drinks 5 12-oz cans of soda plus 64 ounces of water. How many ounces of fluid does he drink a week?<n>Rationales: He drinks 12 * 5 = <<12*5=60>>60 ounces of soda a day<n>So he drinks 60 + 64 = <<60+64=124>>124 ounces of liquid a day<n>So in total he drinks 124 * 7 = <<124*7=868>>868 ounces of liquid a week<n>#### 868<n>Answer: 868<n><n>### Input:What are you hoping to do when listening to an expert speak?

If the players scored an equal number of goals, and the total number of goals scored in the league against Barca that season is 300, calculate the number of goals each of the two players scored.<n>Rationales: If the total number of goals scored in the league that season against Barca is 300, the two players scored 20/100*300=<<300*20/100=60>>60 goals.<n>If the players scored an equal number of goals, each scored 60/2=<<60/2=30>>30 goals.<n>#### 30<n>Answer: 30<n><n>Input: Every day Tom drinks 5 12-oz cans of soda plus 64 ounces of water. How many ounces of fluid does he drink a week?<n>Rationales: He drinks 12 * 5 = <<12*5=60>>60 ounces of soda a day<n>So he drinks 60 + 64 = <<60+64=124>>124 ounces of liquid a day<n>So in total he drinks 124 * 7 = <<124*7=868>>868 ounces of liquid a week<n>#### 868<n>Answer: 868<n><n>### Input:Bill was awaking, what was happening to him physiologically? Choices:  A: tiredness B: grogginess C: discomfort D: getting out of bed E: eyes opening<n><n>### Response:		Bill was getting out of bed<n><n>#### Reason:Because the choices are either A: tiredness or grogginess. If the grogginess option were picked that mean he is waking up, and he said he was awaking, so out of the five choices this makes the best sense. If B was picked it could mean he is being pulled out of bed, maybe to go and have a shower or something, but out of all the options this is the worst fit for the sentence. If C or D were picked it would mean he was falling out of bed to the floor. If E was chosen it would mean his eyes are opening which would not match with the sentence “bill was awaking”.<n><n>\### Input: What about Bill's eyes? Choices:A: the iris opening B: the pupil squeezing C: the white part expanding D: the blind spot blinking E: it doesn't matter.<n><n>### Response A. The iris opening<n><n>#### Reason Because the choices are either A, B, C, D, or E. A, B, and C would all mean that he was about to fall out of bed, and D or E means his eyes have no effect on how he was getting out of bed anyway. Therefore A is the best option.<n><n>\### Instruction:The answer is 11. How is this result calculated?<n><n>\### Response: 11<n><n>#### Reason Choices A, B, C represent the first three of the five digits in the sum. The sum is 10605 and since it can be rearranged as 506010 we need to count 5 from 0 and 6 from 1 to get the answer.<n>\### Instructions: You are buying some goods where the price is $15 with a 30% discount.

I would love to answer this question, but I think that there are animals in a lot of places you mentioned. Too many options and too much uncertainty on which animals you can see."<n>### Rationale:<n>It is more reasonable to assume that humans can see animals in lots of different places.<n>The wording of the question is too vague and may require more qualification to answer.  Thus, it seems like there are other animals that may not have been listed in a place.  "A" is unclear.  You would see zoo animals at a zoo in a big city.  Thus, no. "B is an unclear.  While you may see wild animals in an area of the zoo, this is not how zookeepers would mean to answer this question. So "B" is not a valid answer.  "C: sky" could be answered with "many places" or "the entire city skyline."  So again, it is unclear what the exact animal will be at the skyline.  "D: "new york city" is actually a city, so this is also unrelated.  "E: "many places' is actually an answer that can be used for both "D: "newyork city" and "C: sky."  "E" will definitely be the answer which is correct.<n>#### <n>Answer: C<n>

The Mayflower started out in England with 102 men, women, and children on board. On November 9, 1620, the Mayflower landed on the shore of Cape Cod in Massachusetts. It was November 9, and the harsh weather forced them to settle. They built the homes, but the cold weather was unbearable. They needed to figure out how to stay alive. They soon found out that beaver skins kept them cold.  <n>They knew they had to find food. Soon, they tried fishing, and catching ducks. And soon, they found beaver.

If I take one fruit from each bag, how many peaches will I end up with?"<n><n>### Rationales: One of the items in each bag must be the same.  There are only three possibilities: one bag has bananas and apples, while the other has peaches and apples; one bag has apple, peaches, and bananas, while the other has all banana and apples; or both bags have peaches, apples, and bananas.<n>Let's analyze each possibility.<n><n>#### Analysis 1:<n>One bag must have bananas and apples.  The other bag must have only apples and peaches, because bananas and peaches cannot coexist in the same bag.<n>If we take one item f rom each bag, all things being equal, the item from the banana-only bag will be banana, while the item from the other bag will be peach.<n>Since bananas and peaches are in different bags, no other fruit is available. So if we take one item from each bag, we have no other choice but peach and banana.<n>### Analysis 2:<n>One bag must contain both bananas and apples; the other must contain only peaches and apples.<n>If we take only one item from each bag and we only know that those fruits are present in those bags, there are four fruits to choose from for each bag (bananas, peaches, apples and, of course, the fruits unknown by the giver):<n>If we take one from each bag, the probability of having:<n>Peanut-corn-peach-orange-cherry-apple-apple-pe

So C is correct.<n><n>#### <n>Answer:<n><n>### Instructions:Select a topic of interest you'd like to delve into.<n><n>### Examples: <n>* How much time do I have left on my rental time period?<n>* What is my current balance in my bank account?<n>* How many miles have I driven with my car this month?		<n><n>### Demographics: You are an administrator for a mobile app called My App. This app connects users to their devices and provides them with information about the performance of their devices and how long they will have to wait before they can get access to their devices.<n><n>### Task 1:Write a program for the data type "TimeRemaining." It should have a constructor "TimeRemaining(long)", two methods "TimeRemaining.isZero()" and "TimeRemaining.secondsToWait()", and two properties "TimeRemaining.minutes" and "TimeRemaining minSeconds." The program should return "true" if the time remaining is 0, but must otherwise return "false." It should return the number of seconds remaining when the constructor is called with a given time and it should use minSeconds to display how many minutes and seconds remain when TimeRemaining is used to compute wait time. In the end, write an application that connects to devices via Bluetooth, reads information about the hardware, and displays the information using the methods of My App.<n>#### 3.<n><n>### Solution:<n>The constructor takes in a long and it is stored as a long value. The two methods are isZero and secondsToWait. The isZero method takes the remaining time and compares that time to a value of zero. That is false. Otherwise that value is passed to the other method called  secondsToWait and that method takes the total time and subtract the remaining time so that you can determine the time remaining.<n><n>

Choices:  A: scotland B: europe C: race track D: new jersey E: england<n><n>### Response:		The UK has a few roads that have been branded with the term motorway, yet there is only one major road in America that is known as a motorway.<n><n>### In the United States, a motorway is often known as a highway. Even on the main sites that provide US highway maps, such as Wikipedia and the US Federal Highway Administration, a map indicates that there is one motorway in the United States. This is known as the NYS Thruway, which is called an expressway by the US Department of Transportation.<n><n>### However, the European Motorway Code and other European Union documents, as well as most Europeans, would not consider the term motorway to refer to this US road.<n><n>### Why? A highway is the most commonly-used term for a major road in the United States. It is used synonymously with motorway, and has its base in a French word that means way, highway or track.<n><n>### A motorway is also commonly used in Europe, but the US does not often use that term. Even as US highways transition to the use of tolls to finance their upkeep and increase in traffic, it has not changed the terminology yet.<n><n>### When discussing roads worldwide, the most accepted terminology will be to use specific national terminology.  The term motorway is a British term commonly used to refer to major roads, whereas highway, interstate, route, or expressway are more acceptable terms to use in the US.  In the meantime, you would be unlikely to meet American driving instructors or travel experts using the term motorway in their advice or recommendations, although they may use it in conversation if asked.<n><n>### The US uses the term interstate to refer to some roads (see [map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_of_U.S._interstate_highways)).<n><n>### Choice A: Scotland<n>#### Scotland has some roads that are referred to as motorways, but not as main arteries of transportation.<n><n>##  Task Analysis:<n>Input: A pizza costs $25 at one restaurant and $12 at another. If the two restaurants double the amount of pizza ordered, what is the ratio of the cheaper price to the more expensive price?<n>So at the first restaurant, you would pay 25*2

Where is James? Choices:  A: dairy farm B: texas C: building D: michigan E: florida<n><n>### Response:		James has a family farm in texas<n><n>### Rationales: It did say only one of the answers was correct, so it wouldn't make much sense if he was in Florida. The only way it would make sense to be in Florida would be if a family farm existed in FL. It also doesn't say anything about the family farm "being" in Texas but I assumed it was the best steakhouse was in Texas.<n><n>### Input - multiple choice:  If you had $3.5 billion, how many months would it take you to spend $1 billion? Choices I: three years<n>II: three months<n>III: a short amount of time<n><n>### Response - multiple choice: answer choices are I and II<n><n>### Rationale for answer choice I: <n>The first sentence said you would have $3.5 billion which means the question is asking how long the 3.5 billion would last. Given this information, it would take 3.5 billion / 1 billion = 3.5 years to spend $1 billion.<n><n>### RATIONALES FOR ANSWER CHOICE II:<n>The sentence "If you had $3.6 billion..." contradicts the information in the first sentence which said that you had $3.4 billion, so you don't have $3.6 billion. You can't be asked how long $3.6 billion would last given the fact that you already said you had $3.1 billion and $3.1 billion is not $3.6 billion, so it doesn't make sense why the question is saying you had 3.6 billion. Additionally, in the first sentence they state that you had $370 million and it doesn't make logical sense for you to have $3.6 with this much of a change so your current earnings are not taken into consideration.<n><n>### Inspired By<n>https://www.sentry.io/coding-test-interview-questions-and-exercises/?ref=gtr

Then she has to drive to a car wash and she gets stopped by a police officer waiting at the intersection to pull over traffic offenders. She does not want to be one of these offenders and wants to get her car clean anyway, so as she is driving to the car wash, she turns around and drives back to home.  At last she is driving again to the library. However, she has to take a sharp 90° turn on the way back and drives through a narrow street.  She has to wait a few minutes for traffic to pass her way. All the time she is stuck waiting in heavy traffic her battery is dying and it takes a lot of energy to turn. In addition, she is stuck waiting in traffic and therefore, has to waste a lot of fuel. Finally, she reaches the library but still has to run for her books on the way back and she forgets her library card again.  This is not the first time she is visiting the library this day.

She needs 0.35 kg of kidney beans per person. There will be 8 people at the party, and everyone will have 5 servings of chili.  How many kg of kidney beas does Isabella need to make the chili?<n><n>Isabella has 455 g of kidney beans in her kitchen, including 29 g that go to waste. How many kg of kidnel beans does she have left to make the chili and still have 426 g remaining that can be eaten in any other way?<n><n>Rationales: First, she needs 3500*0.35 = <<3500*10/100 = 35/3>>35/3 servings per person.<n>As everyone will have 5 * 35/3 = <<5*35/3=50/3>>50/3 servings per portion, there are a total of 50 servings per person.  There are a total of 10 people as 5*8 = <<10*5=50>>50 people attending the party.<n>So she needs 550 g to make chili for 10 times 50 g = <<550*50=27500>>27500 servings<n>This total is 2 times 432 g since 432 * 2 = <<432*2=864>>864 servings.<n><n>Next she starts by subtracting 29g from 50 and 2 from 27500, which gives her 27261 g.<n>Now the difference between 550 and 27262 g becomes 27000/287 = <<27000*287=8276>>8276 g.<n>Now divide 8276 by 8 = <<8276*8

The question uses the word "keep."  So the answer must be a term that is also used.<n>1. Errors are kept to determine errors and errors.  The question uses "them."<n>2. Happiness is not a term that is used in baseball.  Baseball uses terms such as hits, runs, runs batted in, errors, home runs, etc.<n>3. Mistakes do not keep track of anything.  You can not use mistake to determine a stat.<n><n>4. Sore muscles can not determine errors.  Likewise you can not use sore muscles to determine happiness.  In either case you have to have a variable that is capable of accepting numbers such as the outcome, errors for baseball or happiness for happiness.

By how much has the price of a 129-cent item increased?<n>Rationales You would divide the price of a 95-cent item by two to determine the percentage increase of such item.<n>Then, multiply that percentage increase by the price of a 24-cent item.<n><n>#### Percentage increase<n>If the price of an item has doubled, then the product (P(1 - 1)) = 1 - 2 = 0.25 = 25% increase.<n><n>If the price of items has increased 25%, then you would multiply the price of a 48-cent item by 25 = 12, so the price of a 51-cent item has more than doubled to have a price of $0.99.<n><n>#### Per dollar increase<n>If the price increases for example by \$5, by what percentage has its price increased?<n><n>The answer is 25. 25%.<n><n>#### If we had $1250, and the price of $250 items more than tripled, by what percentage did their prices more than triple?<n>The original price was \$200, so the new price is \$600.<n><n>So the original price of \$250 increased by 300 % or 300%.<n><n>You take the original price and multiply 300.<n><n>300% of \$250 is \$300.<n>Now, compare the original price with the increased price.<n><n>The original price of \$200 increased to \$250.<n>That is a 25% increase over the original price.<n>You divide the increased price by original price. 25% = 0.2.<n><n>The new price is \$300 or (1.25 * \$200).<n><n>The 300% is the percentage.  Remember that 300% means that you multiplied the original price by 3 in order to calculate the new price.  You can substitute the percentage you just calculated for 300%.  That way you do not have to

Crossword puzzles also help people train and improve their memory power and vocabulary. I think the right answer is A because all the other answers are incorrect while crossword puzzle can help an old man to pass his time because crossword puzzle is such fun. Crossword puzzle can also make him relax and improve his brain power. However, if the old man wanted to pass his time then he would read a romantic novel while if he wanted to mentally challenged then he would do some brain exercises, however, if the old man simply wanted to win then he should go back to work instead of doing crossword puzzles.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>The correct answer is choice A because crossword puzzle helps old men in improving their brain power and improves their vocabulary. Besides crossword puzzle can also help old people to pass their time and relax. So, that old man who solved crossword puzzles would pass his time by solving crossword puzzles. I think the correct answer is A because crossword puzzles are simple and also they help people in passing their time and improve their memory power. I also believe that if the old man who did crossword puzzle was retired then to pass his time he would do crossword then if he wanted to relax then he would read a book. So, if we look at those 4 choices the correct answer is A.<n><n>## Expected Questions, Rationales<n>How to get better at logical reasoning?<n>#### Rationales:<n>Reading questions and their solutions that are available in our platform would help to improve your logical reasoning, so the more you read those you will be able to get better at logical Reasoning.

One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Rationales: For the nuts Adam paid 3 * $12 = $<<3*12=36>>36.<n>And for dried fruits Adam paid 2.5 * $8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20.<n>So in total for his purchases Adam paid $36 + $20 = $<<36+20=56>>56.<n>#### 56<n>Answer: 56<n><n>Input: Johns goes to the gym 3 times a week.  He spends 1 hour each day lifting weight. Additionally, he also spends a third of his weightlifting time warming up and doing cardio each day.  How many hours does he spend at the gym a week?<n>Rationales: He spends 60/3=<<60/3=20>>20 minutes warming up<n>So he spends 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes at the gym per day<n>That means he spends 80*3=<<80*3=240>>240 minutes at the gym<n>So he spends 240/60=<<240/60=4>>4 hours at the gym a week<n>#### 4<n>Answer: 4<n><n>Input: James has to refuel his plane.  It used to cost $200 to refill the tank.  He got an extra tank to double fuel capacity.  Fuel prices also went up by 20%.  How much does he pay now for fuel?<n>Rationales: The cost to fill a tank went up 200*.2=$<<200*.2=40>>40<n>So it cost 200+40=$<<200+40=240>>240 to fill the tank<n>That means he now pays 240*2=$<<240*2=480>>480<n>#### 480<n>Answer: 480<n><n>Input: The number of goals scored in a game against Barca by exactly two players last season accounts for 20% of all goals scored in the league. If the players scored an equal number of goals, and the total number of goals scored in the league against Barca that season is 300, calculate the number of goals each of the two players scored.<n>Rationales: If the total number of goals scored in the league that season against Barca is 300, the two players scored 20/100*300=<<300*20/100=60>>60 goals.<n>If the players scored an equal number of goals, each scored 60/2=<<60/2=30>>30 goals.<n>#### 30<n>Answer: 30<n><n>Input: Every day Tom drinks 5 12-oz cans of soda plus 64 ounces of water. How many ounces of fluid does he drink a week?<n>Rationales: He drinks 12 * 5 = <<12*5=60>>60 ounces of soda a day<n>So he drinks 60 + 64 = <<60+64=124>>124 ounces of liquid a day<n>So in total he drinks 124 * 7 = <<124*7=868>>868 ounces of liquid a week<n>#### 868<n>Answer: 868<n><n>### Input:Where is known to always have snow? Choices:  A: africa B: north pole C: roof D: canada E: surface of earth<n><n>### Response:		E (surface of earth)<n>Rationales:  There is more snow in Canada than any other place in the world.  That means Canada is known to always have Snow.<n>So the answer is E (surface of earth).<n><n>### Instructions: Answer the following short answer question.<n><n>## Demonstration<n>> Question: In what city would you find the largest library in the world? Choices:  C: new york  A: new york  B: chicago  D: washington D.C.<n><n>In C: new york<n><n>Rationales: One of the worlds largest Library is in NYC.  It's is known to have 53 million books.<n>So the largest library in the World is in NYC.<n><n>### Question: How long does it take the Voyager 1 spacecraft to travel 1 million miles from earth at a speed of 44,000 miles per hour? Assume Voyager 1 is located 1,316,700 miles from earth when it begins the run and Voyager 1 runs at a constant speed. Ignore the fact that the earth rotates. Answer to the nearest hour.<n><n>Rationales<n><n>So the Voyager 44,060 miles per hour. <n>1316700/44600=<<==31.267>> 31.26<n><n>Rationales2: <n>Voyager start at 1,317,000 miles =<<==5,173,547>> 5173547<n>Voyager time to travel earth=<<==5,166,400>> 5166400<n>That means Voyager cover 6 thousand miles<n><n>Rationales3:6000 divided by time(earth)=<<==6000/44000=1316900>> 13169<n><n>Answer: <n>Voyagers travel 5,16640+ 6000 =<<==5,966,300>><n><n>And that means the Voyager will take 24.5 hours to complete the task<n>

Each time the two teams played they played a game and had one rest day.  Suppose that the probability that both teams win is 1/3, but if it is their second time playing to play both teams will play a close game, with a win/loss probability of 1/2 (i.e there is a 50% chance they will win, and 50% chance the lose).  A loss by one team in any game does not affect the outcome of the series (it could possibly be a win or lose for one, but either way will continue the series of the same team).  Given that the UNC and Syracuse teams play only one game between them at a time and given the 2016 teams, what was the probability that UNC won the series?<n><n>#### My work (I know if I have extra stuff here i didnt fill out or something and its not supposed to be the whole code block):<n><n>##### a)...the probability that UNC won<n><n>##### b)...and this was my code block:<n>```<n>def winSeries<n>  winCount = 0<n>  <n>  (1..6).each { |

Choices:  A: library B: study area C: table D: classroom E: shelf<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>It depends where you want to do your work and put the materials you require. If I am in a study area, I will put both the dictionary and my notebooks on the table beside me because I can reference them while I am working. If I am at home, in my library, I will put the dictionary next to my bed and will make sure that every time I go in and out of the bed, I will put the open dictionary with my notebook so that I can quickly reference it. Or I could put it next to my bed underneath my bedside table so that every time I go on bed, I can quickly access it. Another place I could probably use the dictionary is at the classroom, I can also put the dictionary besides me so that I can reference it while I work on a project or study.<n><n>### Inputs: Choices:  A. 9 B. 11 C. 10 D. 8 E. 7 F. 8 <n><n>### Response<n><n>I would prefer to choose answer B because I can reference to my old class grade to determine if I can improve my performance in this class. If I choose answer B, I can quickly see where I stand in class and my total grade.<n><n>###<n><n>### Input<n><n>It depends on what you want to do first before actually having time to start your work in your research. For example, if I already know where I want to go, I will go to the place first, and then try out the equipment. So, I would prefer to do the second choice and try using a lot of the equipment before actually starting a project. This way, I can maximize the usage of the materials before I actually start doing work or before I get my research from someone else.<n><n>### Answer<n><n>Answer C. Before you start doing your own research, you need to know what equipment you need and where you can get it. There's no point in doing research without knowing what you want to do and knowing where you can get the equipment to do it. You must do your research first, and then after that, you can go to the library to get the materials.<n><n>### Choice A: Choices: 1,2,3,4 <n><n>Choose the best choice (1,2,3 or 4) for the following questions:<n><n>### The answer to the problem

Also asks what is the desired weight of someone. The program should ask the person which gender is theirs. It should then tell them if their height will meet the weightlifting standards for both or either the male or female category. If the desired height will not meet the standards of the desired body type for either gender it should tell them the body weight required for their body height and the body type. If a desired height is not even available for the desired body type it should tell them they should try exercising, lifting weights, or gain or lose weight.<n><n>### Inputs: The program should look at the height and weight of what the person asked for their body type. If the gender of the person is male then it should also look at the height to see if it will meet the standards for the gender they desire. The program should tell them what they need to do to meet the desired height or the desired weight for their height. If there is no available height to meet the desired weight for the body type, the program should give them the requirements to reach the desired bodyweight or the height that they need to have.<n><n>```Rationales: If a male tries to reach the body weight standards for a female it should tell them to stay the same weight or start lifting weights. If a female is trying to reach the male weight standards it should tell her to start dieting to shed some weight.<n>```<n><n>```Rational: The height and the weight should be the inputs for the program. The output of the program should tell the person which gender they belong to and what body type it is. The desired height should be compared to the person's stature. If the program does not find a suitable height for the desired body part it should ask the person what they want to do.<n>```<n><n>#### 60<n>Answer: 60<n><n>### Input <n><n>#### 65<n>Answer: 65<n><n>### Input<n><n>#### 70 <n>Answer: 70<n><n>### Instructions:<n>Input:<n>What is the cost of 125 items?<n><n>R

Choices:  A: sophisticated B: imprevist C: arcane D: heavenly E: new<n><n>### Response:		Arcane does not get rid of a mundain routine. Instead arcane keeps you stuck in a rut.<n><n>Explanation:  The answer key had Arcane listed as one of the answer choices.  It was not one of them so I chose E.  As soon as I read E in the prompt I knew that Arcane could never get rid of a moodan routine.  The best the word Arcane could do is help keep the routine in its place.<n><n>### Input How much does it cost to purchase a book? Choices: A: $25.00 B: $12.50 C: $40.00 D: $9.50 E: $2.25<n><n>### Response A: $25<n><n>Explanation of response  If you add all the answer choices the response would be $25.  That would be the only choice that would add to $25.<n><n>### The best choice would not be to guess.  The problem statement does not state A or D.  The problem statement would be incomplete and therefore the solution would not be complete either so the best thing to do would be to choose an answer choice that would add up to $25.01 or higher but not as high as $25.02<n><n>### Question:Who’s the top-selling female model in Paris?<n><n>### Options:<n>A: Aurelie B: Dafnese C: Claudia F: Cami<n><n>### Explanation of response:<n>Aurelie would do the trick because there are other options in Aurelie because they sound like someone in the modeling world.  Dafenese has a word that sounds like someone in the model industry.  Claudia is a typical name and Cami is a form of short for Camila.  The way the options are formed you can have Aurelie or Dafenese<n><n>### Revision:  The question could be phrased differently if it were, “Who’s the top selling in the city, Dafenese?”  I would pick Dafenese because there is a possibility that my model could be selling better than Cami, but not better than Aurelie or Claudia.<n><n>### Answer:  Aurelie<n><n>

Choices:  A: question B: dispute C: deny D: contradict E: refuse<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>### Explanation: If the reference does what, it is a failure to confirm the applicant's reference.<n><n>### Rationale: Choice A is a success.<n><n>### Choice A: Success<n>- Success: A confirmation of an applicant's references leads us to believe that it is reasonable to believe that the application is correct.<n><n>### Examples:<n><n>Applying for a job - the job description says "Must be able to work on your feet for 8 hours"<n>You send reference asking "Can you please confirm John Smith was able to work on his feet 8 hours for 3+ years?"<n>John sends back "John Smith was never able to work on his own feet because of a condition called diabetic neuropathy, that made him unable to feel sensations from walking"<n>You now have a reasonable basis to believe that the job qualifications are not reasonable to describe a job candidate.<n>### Choice B: Dispute<n>- Dispute: A rebuttal of an applicant' s references leads us to believe it is reasonable to believe the application is false.<n><n>### Example: John Smith was the most talented person to come through our basketball team, it's a shame he transferred to a different team.<n><n>### Success: A candidate' s reference is a basis for thinking the application is correct. In this case, a candidate' s reference saying they were the best player is a success<n><n>### Rationales:<n>John is an exception to the rule of the basketball team that he is the best out of the whole team. It means that he is the the exception to the rule.<n>If the rule of the team says that they are the best, then John's reference that he is the best is also a success<n><n>However, when the candidate' s reference does not confirm the rule (the team was the best one in the league), it doesn't lead us to believe that the application was reasonable to believe.<n><n>### The rule here is that candidates who are the most talented are always accepted to be the best player on the team, while John was accepted in the team and was the best of the team<n><n>John's reference does not lead us to believe that John was the best. It only indicates that John was the exception to the rule (for example, a very talented player

What will the consumer do to maintain the same level of gas intake without altering their lifestyles?<n>The price of anything will be affected by the cost of production and supply. The price may also be influenced by an event like a shortage. Thus, if the cost of petrol to the consumers rises by say 10 dollars, consumers will purchase at the same quantity. A shortage may also cause the consumers to purchase less while the prices of the petrol will increase.  This will not alter their lifestyles but a shortage will be more likely.<n><n>### Inputs :<n><n>### Response :<n><n><n>### Democratation :  <n>The cost of living will increase the income of a individual who receives a certain incentive and wage in the public sector, which is based on the number of hours spent at the job. The increase is known as cost of living adjustment (COLA), and it compensates employees and pensioners if inflation and price levels rise as a direct result of the rise in living costs. This compensation is dependent on the number of hours the worker has spent at the job, which also means that if a person works for less hours, there is no compensation. In spite of the fact that the government has attempted to lower the prices of basic commodities by offering tax reliefs, this is a poor indication for the working class.<n><n><n>### Rationale :<n><n><n>## 6. If the price of milk doubled, how would that affect the quantity demanded in an economy where total income and preferences remain the same?<n><n>### Instuction :<n><n>### Input/Request:<n>The quantity of any good demanded will be affected by its price when other factors are assumed to remain unchanged.  This is because consumers adjust their consumption according their income and preferences to the fluctuation in price based on their preferences. Thus, milk is a necessity for people, which explains why there is high demand for milk, though the price has increased. Incre

B is wrong since it can't have a lot of fields as it is a city. C includes farms, but it was not the option.D has fields but the text also mentions it is shaped like a globe.<n><n>Input:  Two teams, Red and Yellow, participated in a game.  The total number of players in both teams was a multiple of 6.  If there were 4 players in Red and 7 players in Yellow and the players also had equal number of goals on the games, what were the number of players in both of these teams?<n>Rationales: Everyone had an equal number of goals that was a whole number, so 4 * 6 = 24. <n>Red had two fewer players, so the only way for that to work out is if the last player in Red had 1/6th more goals than the other players in Red, and the last player in Yellow had 1/6 of his goals as well.  That means that the last 4 were Red players and they had 24 less goals.<n>#### 24<n>Answer: 24<n><n>Input: Find the two digits, when the sum of the digits is reduced by 1.<n>Example: 19 + 1 = 18<n>Rationales: When we add 19 with 1, the sum we get is 20.

Thus, there are nine arrangements for that position. The last position has 10 spaces (not 9), so the last item will have 10 arrangements as well. There are a total of 10 * 9 = <<10*9=90>>90 permutations. You can write the above answer as 10 * 10 * 0 * 1 * 10 * (… * 10 * … * 10) * 0. For example, 10 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.

Choices: Choices:  A. 5  B. 3  C. 2  D. 7  E. 1  F. 11]<n>Rationales: Since Mary's dog is X years younger than Fred so 25-X-2=<<25-X-1=24>>24 is X years old. And it's 24 days from Fred's birthday.<n>So it's 2 days from 24 that makes dog 25 years old.<n>So the dog is 5 years old.<n>#### 5<n>Answer: 5<n><n>### Input:"Alice is going to New York.  She wants to spend six days at a concert.  Each concert lasts 12 hours.  Which concert does Alice attend, when does each concert start, and how long will Alice spend at each concert?<n>Rationales:"Alice is going 6 days with her concerts, so that means in each day she needs 6 concerts so in total there are 6*12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours<n>So Alice needs to attend 6 concerts and she would spend 72 minutes at each concert which means that each concerts length is 12 hours.<n>So the concert Alice attends the first day is 12-1=0 the second day is 12 the third day is 12, fourth day is 12+1=<<12+1=13>>13 the fifth day is 12 + 1=<<12 + 1 = 13>>13 and the last day is 12*.5=<<12*.5=6>>6.<n>So Alice visits 2 concerts: 6 and 13 the 6th day of her music tour.

Sensemaking  is central to the field of UX [Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UX_research)<n>which studies how people perceive and act with information systems <n><n>You can look closely at a few key ways we make sense of the world:<n>1. Seeing is doing<n>2. Representing the world, digitally and visually<n>3. Representing the world in our thoughts<n><n>Now that you are thinking more deeply about how you make sense of the world, you should ask yourself how you represent, imagine, and see the world. Can you think of different ways you may see, imagine, or represent things? <n><n>This module covers 2 of these key ways humans  make sense of the world.<n><n>### Seeing and experiencing<n><n>### Imagining<n><n>### Representing<n>#### The way humans see: seeing and experiencing<n><n>Visuals represent a significant portion of how we navigate and learn. By using visuals, we can engage with things in a very different way from what we experience the first time. <n><n>We can learn how to think about what an experience looks like <n>when you're working on a new challenge.  That means we can use our experiences to learn what we want and what it might look like. <n><n>Some tools to help us  see what we are looking at and how we represent it:<n>1. Representing images that aren't visible<n>2. Representing ourselves and our relationships<n>3. Representing relationships with objects<n><n>#### 1.

But that isn’t really the case. Jim enjoyed killing people. He also enjoyed that people could not really see how he was killing them. So Jim only went to prison if he murdered someone and got caught doing it, and that person would be able to recognise him. If Jim liked to do the killing, then he didn’t usually leave any clues except when someone survived (i.e., he was caught in the act).<n><n>#### C<n>Answer: prison<n>---<n>### Instruction 1:John made an apple cake for his kids.

If John spent 8 hours in the kitchen, let's call that 1 hour. In 1 hour John used 1 cans. Then, John spent 1+ 18=$<<15+1>>16 hours in the kitchen. If he spent 1 hour on the cake itself, John made the cake in 20 hours.<n><n>#### 20<n>Answer: 20<n><n>### Instructions: Write a mathematical sentence that matches the instruction.

This is because, not only the concepts are difficult, but you would also have to copy the methods, the syntax, etc. which takes longer. Besides, you are supposed to do the same in different ways before each exam, thus saving you the hassle of copying again and again. Additionally, it is also a lot easier to remember something if you know the concepts thoroughly already instead of trying to be so smart while copying.

Choices:  A: meat grinder B: stable C: red barn D: gate E: green field<n><n>### Response:		For this question you have two important things to understand. The first important thing is what each choice means. This is important because you need to make sense of the problem when trying to come up with your response. Each choice is a noun and describes some aspect of the cow. You will need to understand this concept in other questions as well. The second important thing to understand is this type of question. This type of question has you identify what choice completes which noun choice. The noun choices are the first part and the choices is the second part. For this question we have to identify what choice goes where. This means you will need to arrange the noun choices in a way that makes sense. For this question we can start with the meat grinder and use it for c. Here we have the cow in a stable grinding meat on a red barn. Then we can use the stable to go with the green field. That gives us the cow inside a stable with green fields outside. However, notice we already used green field in our arrangement. Well, that means we can use the gate instead. Using that we can have the cow in a green field with a red barn outside the gate. That answers all the choices with the exception of the red barn. That means we need to find another place for the red barn. I think the green field is a pretty good one. It gives us a picture of cow in a grass field that stays outside all of the time even in the rain. Here is one more example.<n><n>### Input : The last time I heard from her was right after the breakup at that restaurant in Paris...<n>### Response :  For this question you have two things you need to get out of the sentence: the name of the restaurant and the city where that restaurant was in.

A restaurant is looking to remodel the kitchen and is deciding between two different contractors: A and B. A has 15% lower quoted price, but the lead-times on the project can potentially be 30% longer. The project is expected to use on average 1000 man-hours of labor, and the cost per man-hour is $50. Contractor A has higher profits, but can finish the project 50% faster. Which contractor should be chosen?<n>#### A<n><n>Rationales: Contractor A could be chosen. Contractor A’s price is 15% lower than B’s, and B is 30% slower. Overall, contractor A would take on an extra 30% of work. When contractor A completes the job in 30% less time, work is taken on on an extra 150% of the total work. For 30% more time, contractor B is paid 150% more. So it will take contractor A 50% fewer man-hours to complete the job.<n>That would save 50% in time, and that is an extra 15% of time. So if contractor A was paid $50 per hour for 150% total work, then contractor B would be paid $50 per total work * 150% time = $$50*150%=<<50*15/100=37.5>>37.5.<n>#### 37.5<n><n>2.

He had a bucket with a three-foot handle, and so he decided he could carry the bucket up 3 feet of rope on his back, and then he would make 3 trips up and over the hill at a rate of 2 trips per hour. How much rope would he have left over?<n><n>### Response<n>Rationales: Lets call the length of the rope A, We are given that the length we need to carry on our back is A-3, This works out to be 23 feet.  So we have 3x7,200 in miles.  So he needs 21,600  miles to carry the rope and bucket.  The number of miles he needs to carry over the mountains would be A-23.  Lets just simplify that to A-23, so he needs A-23 miles more to complete the task.  So he needs A+23.  But the number he is given is 3,235, miles.  Lets call this B,  So A+B=>>3235+...>>A+B=5,435, So 5,435 is greater than 6015.  So thats our answer.<n><n>#### 6015<n>Answer: 6015

It was a great and mighty empire. It enriched the lives of people who lived there in many ways. One of those ways was the development of philosophy. There were many schools of philosophy. It all began with Socrates. He lived in Athens. However, it was not Athens where Socrates began his work. He started in the market place. He questioned the rich and elite citizens of Athens about their views and opinions about everyday life. He would ask difficult questions designed to show how they lacked any real understanding of the world around them. He got their attention because he did not give the easy answer or the “right” answer. He didn’t tell anyone what he believed. He just asked lots of questions. Today, we have Socrates to thank for a lot of Western philosophy. In addition, one of his students continued his teachings. The student’s name was Plato. Plato continued Socrates’ work by writing about the philosopher’s ideas. We have the work of these philosophers today. Plato’s writings and the thoughts of other philosophers would become the foundations of academic philosophy. He was one of the original people to formulate logic and the first to establish rationality as its own branch of philosophy.<n><n>#### Socrates<n>[A](https//en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Socrates)<n>[B](http://www.historyonthenet.com//Articles/Socrates/Socrates.htm)<n>[C](http://www.biography.com//People/Philosophers/Socrates-20901237)<n>[D](https//en.wikiquote.org//wiki/Nel

Choices:  A: tennessee B: band practice C: orchestra D: violin case E: music store<n><n>### Response:		<n>**D** - A fiddle is also known as a violin and a fiddler is someone who plays a violin. So the best answer is **D**.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>A and B are two cities in Tennessee, the state with the highest number of violinists per capita in the United States. (https://www.violinist.com/discussion/article/turkey-has-the-highest-violinist-per-capita-rate/), but it doesn’t have very many fiddle, because fiddle is slang for “fiddler” and fiddler is someone that plays a violin.<n><n>C is incorrect because an orchestra could have thousands of fiddles - the instrument that all violin players play on in an orchestra is a viola, not a fiddle.<n><n>E is incorrect because, just in looking at the name of the store, it does not seem like this store could have many fiddle, since fiddle is slang for fiddler, and a fiddler plays a violin.

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Falls_(Virginia)#/media/File:GreatFalls10626_Feb2006.jpg)<n><n>### Rationale:<n>The others are either all landmarks in Canada and therefore have no relation to the waterfall question, or are actually the name of waterfalls. Great Falls National Park was the only answer choice that is actually a name of a waterfall and is one of the ten-tallest waterfalls in the World (https://www.nps.gov/vaga/learn/nature/giantwaterfalls.htm).<n><n>###

When they reached their gate, the airline attendant refused to seat the elder 7 year old grandchild in a different available seat and told my mother that she and her other grandson could not board because neither seat was booked under the name of my grandmother nor did they own two full price adult seats.  How can one explain the reasoning behind the airline’s statement that they cannot board a plane with one unaccompanied child and one 18-month old baby? Choices: 1) The child must be with a ticket-holding parent or guardian. 2) A ticket is needed to fly unaccompanied minors; children under two years of age may share a seat with their parent or guardian so long as the adults ticket is held

But, I don't believe she is insane and I believe she is aware of what she is doing.<n>> I also highlighted "C" as I believe it is the best option.<n><n>### Answer:<n>The singer, according to the statement, sings _so much_ that people around are _annoyed_. Hence, "T" is the correct mark.<n><n>Input: The 2006 US presidential election was decided by approximately 6,000 votes. John McCain lost by 0.5% to Barack Obama. If 1% is equal to 6000 votes, what number did John McCain lose to Barack Obama?<n>Rationales:(The difference between Obama's votes and that of McCain's, i.e., 6000 is divided by 1 to get an answer.)<n>6000/0.01=<<6000/6000=.01>>6000/1=0.01<n>So McCain lost by 6000/[number he can get in one percent]=<<600/60.04=10>>600/[number in one percent] so, John McCain lost by approximately 10%. <n><n>Input: A train has to stop at every block in a city which has a total number of 24 blocks.

One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Rationales: For the nuts Adam paid 3 * $12 = $<<3*12=36>>36.<n>And for dried fruits Adam paid 2.5 * $8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20.<n>So in total for his purchases Adam paid $36 + $20 = $<<36+20=56>>56.<n>#### 56<n>Answer: 56<n><n>Input: Johns goes to the gym 3 times a week.  He spends 1 hour each day lifting weight. Additionally, he also spends a third of his weightlifting time warming up and doing cardio each day.  How many hours does he spend at the gym a week?<n>Rationales: He spends 60/3=<<60/3=20>>20 minutes warming up<n>So he spends 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes at the gym per day<n>That means he spends 80*3=<<80*3=240>>240 minutes at the gym<n>So he spends 240/60=<<240/60=4>>4 hours at the gym a week<n>#### 4<n>Answer: 4<n><n>Input: James has to refuel his plane.  It used to cost $200 to refill the tank.  He got an extra tank to double fuel capacity.  Fuel prices also went up by 20%.  How much does he pay now for fuel?<n>Rationales: The cost to fill a tank went up 200*.2=$<<200*.2=40>>40<n>So it cost 200+40=$<<200+40=240>>240 to fill the tank<n>That means he now pays 240*2=$<<240*2=480>>480<n>#### 480<n>Answer: 480<n><n>Input: The number of goals scored in a game against Barca by exactly two players last season accounts for 20% of all goals scored in the league. If the players scored an equal number of goals, and the total number of goals scored in the league against Barca that season is 300, calculate the number of goals each of the two players scored.<n>Rationales: If the total number of goals scored in the league that season against Barca is 300, the two players scored 20/100*300=<<300*20/100=60>>60 goals.<n>If the players scored an equal number of goals, each scored 60/2=<<60/2=30>>30 goals.<n>#### 30<n>Answer: 30<n><n>Input: Every day Tom drinks 5 12-oz cans of soda plus 64 ounces of water. How many ounces of fluid does he drink a week?<n>Rationales: He drinks 12 * 5 = <<12*5=60>>60 ounces of soda a day<n>So he drinks 60 + 64 = <<60+64=124>>124 ounces of liquid a day<n>So in total he drinks 124 * 7 = <<124*7=868>>868 ounces of liquid a week<n>#### 868<n>Answer: 868<n><n>### Input:The person turned the oven on and put a pizza in, what happened one hour later? Choices:  A: smell smoke B: catch cold C: burnt D: look angry E: bank savings<n><n>### Response:		C<n><n>Input: Adam bought two apples for one dollar and a banana for 50 cents. What is the total cost of the pair?<n>Rationales There is an important property of division that people should remember. Whenever you divide a number by itself (such as $1/1$ or $2/2$), you obtain no more than one. That’s because you have no more than one instance of that number: if you have two, you multiply and get four. You can see the same logic at work with the answer: the total cost is four dollars, so each apple is four dollars and the banana is four dollars, for a total of eight.<n><n>### Input<n>  You made 35 pizza rolls that were baked for five minutes. After they were fully baked you stored them in the oven to cool. After ten minutes the oven temperature rose 10% and then 100 minutes later there was a fire in the kitchen and you rescued all of the pizza rolls and stored them in the storage closet. How long after your pizza rolls had been fully baked in the oven did the fire occur?<n><n><n>### Choices: D: The fifth Tuesday<n>E: Fifth Tuesday of the month<n>F: Five days after the fifth Tuesday<n>G: Five Tuesdays after the second<n>H: Six weeks after the third<n><n><n>### Response Answer: G.<n><n>### Rationales:  The first step is to convert the statements into a logical mathematical form:  <n><n>#### (1)  The statement: after the fire occur : "five Tuesdays after the 2" : is mathematically equivalent to:  <n><n>#### ##(2)  <n>```<n>  <n><n>```<n><n><n><n>```<n>Then, the statement can be expressed in a more algebraic form, as two expressions:<n><n>![](./images-Auctions-01.jpg)<n><n>Now, the two expressions are easy to solve.<n>Solving the first expression, you get:<n><n>![](images-Auctions.jpg)<n><n><n>Now, the other equation must be solved:<n><n>![](Images-01.jpg).<n>You can solve for the variable t1 by using the rule:<n><n>![](image-1.50.

Choices:  A: better job B: irritated C: feel safe D: save money E: headache<n>Output:		For the "job better" response, it shows the client has a better job, in which person's head can't be cut. The job better implies both jobs are bad.<n>For the "feel better" response, they do feel better after, where both are good. No more chopping of someone. <n>As the head cannot be killed because it has no blood, and the body guard is good at his job.<n>So the actual answer is "feel better" <n><n>Input: Alice, Bob and Charlie each spend the same amount of money each day. Alice buys one loaf of bread, and a half pound of cheese, Bob buys one pound of cheese and a block of butter, and Charlie buys one loaf bread and two pounds of cheese.<n>Output: Every day Alice buys 1 loaf and 1/2 pound of cheese. Bob buys 1 pound and 1/2 block of butter.<n>Each spends the same amount of money, so the question is to find out who spends the most for their purchase<n>So Alice spends 1/2*12 = <<1/2*14=7>>7 <n>And Bob spend 12*1 = <<12*1=12>>12 <n>Charlie spends 1/3*12 = <<27/12=2.25>>2.25 <n>Alice spends the most amount of money, 7 > 7.00 = <<7>0.62>>0.62 <n>Bob spends the least, 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 <n>So we need to check whether to multiply Bob's costs with 2 or 4. Because it needs to be compared with the previous answer and 6 becomes the maximum number.<n>We need to multiply by 6 * 9 = <<6*9=55>>55, then in the final answer we need to multiply by 7/2 = <<7/2=5>>5 <n>So if the answer is 55 or less, Bob spends more, while if it is greater than 55 then Alice spends more.

How can a team of three people open the two doors, find the room with doors, and still stay together?<n>Input Options:  One person has a key for every door in the room, but must work out a method of distributing them without telling the person who holds the keys.   The solution must be achieved without being told how many people, doors, or keys there are in the room.  The team has no tools to pick the locks on the door.<n>Output: You can leave two people guarding the door from inside and the other one can unlock it and open it.<n><n>Input: The time was right: I just had to get in.  My plan was solid: I would open the door, steal a cake, and leave. If anyone came after me, I’d just pretend to be asleep. But why was I so scared? What if someone caught me? I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Once the thief gets the cake,  why does the cake-owner get mad? What if I got lost? What if I got distracted? What if I got scared? I was freaking out. I had been in a bad mood all day and was starting to get worried.  But the time was right, my plan was solid, so I just had to get it done. I took a deep breath and I took it step by step, so I didn’t miss anything. Then I was on my way, with no one to help me.<n>Output: Because  the cake is more important that you being caught.  Just because  you got a piece of pie doesn’t mean it is good.  But in the end it’s up to you.  If you get away with stealing the cake, then no one will be mad<n><n>

There was some kind of problem with the kitchen so it took longer to prepare than expected and when was ready it was inefficiently packaged, but at least they're hot, so I think that's good.

If each student spent $4, then how many dollars were collected?<n>Output:<n>Let $$$1$$$ be the dollars collected.<n>We know 2*1=5, so $$$1$$$ is 5.<n>We know $$$4$$$ dollars were spent by each student<n>Since $$$4$$$ is bigger than 2*1=3, each student must have spent $$$3$$$ on average.<n>So $$$1+3$$$ = $$$1+3=4$$$ was spent on average by each student<n>Since the group has 10 members, each student spent $$$400$$$.<n>So $$$X$$$, the amount collected, was $$$100$$$.<n><n>There are 100 students. Each student was given 5 dollars and spent 3 dollars.<n>If the person that collected the money collected 100*5 = <<100*5=500>>500 dollars then they would have spend 500-100 = <<500-500=0>>0 dollars and so they would be in debt.<n>So they only spent 500-3*100= <<650-400=250>>250 dollars.<n>Therefore the correct answer is B

Choices:  A: tear up B: see light C: fill with tears D: be happy E: glass over<n>Output:		The baby cries because its eyes have not been exposed to the light before and now are filled with tears. We all know that when you’re sad you cry. But why do we cry when we’re mad or happy? Tears actually start from the iris, which is the colored part of the eye. They then move from the iris to the pigmented region of the eye. It is this section of the eye where the tears turn gray, and it’s here where tears are produced. But why are we producing the tears in the first place? They are our body’s way of telling us that something is either good or bad for us. But this crying mechanism is something that newborns don’t have — so when they’re born, their body doesn’t know whether what they’re seeing is good or bad — so they just cry tears of joy. The baby cries because of the pain, and then the tears start. When she cries, it’s because her body is in pain.<n><n>Input: Given the following expressions, which will cause the condition to be true, or false:<n>a) (A+B)*(C+D)<n>b) (A+B)+(C+D)  <n>c) (A+B)<>C+D  <n>d) (A*C)*(B+D)<n>Output:a) A, B, C and D can be replaced with any positive number.

The winning party received more than 3/4 of the popular votes in the entire county. How many votes did the winning party receive in this county?<n>Output: First, we consider the case where the winning party obtained a plurality of votes.  Let _P_ be the number of votes that the winning party received.  If we then allow some members of party B to take second and third place if they had enough votes, and if we do not allow any members of party A to come in second or third or higher, then the plurality winner has to be a member of party A.  Since the winning party got 3/4 of all the votes, the only way this kind of tie could happen is if the winning party got 1/4 of the votes. So _P_ must divide evenly into 25000. This will give us 25,010, since we must allow a fraction of the winning party's votes to go to another party. Since the winning party has a plurality of the votes, _P_ cannot be larger than 25010.  (This is the solution to a standard logic problem used to test for plurality winners of office.)<n>So there are 19990 votes remaining for the winning party. Then let _P_ be the fraction of votes that the winning candidate gets. Since _P_ must be between 1/4 and 1, _P_ is equal to the quotient of the number of votes obtained by the winning candidate and 25001. So _P_ < 2501/25004 which is less than 2.<n>So the number of votes the winning party received is: 19991+25004-2501=<<19991>>19991 votes<n>So the final answer was 19995

In a death penalty case, the likelihood of being executed increases the longer the person is on death row. However, the likelihood of overturned convictions increases the longer the person has been incarcerated. A shorter stay in jail reduces the time where there is even a chance that a mistake has been made, and increases the probability that the person on death row actually did what they were convicted of doing. The data is collected on a state level and does not include people who receive the death penalty and never go through the appeals process.   Given the data, explain whether there is a chance that the death penalty could be used injustly in this

But if it only added 1 in the end, the human player will be able to win.<n>So the final move it makes is 2+1=<<3+1=4>>4<n>So this means the computer has infinite knowledge of the game, and it’s a draw!<n>In a real game however it’s infinite 🙂<n><n><n>Input: Adam is learning Spanish, but sometimes wants to talk in Portuguese.  His professor told him the two languages share common roots and therefore much of the syntax should be similar.

All cooks whose names end in "i" wear pink uniforms, and all those with names ending in "y" wear blue ones. For example, Lori was the only blue-wearer whose name ended in i.<n>Every year Fry has a contest to give a uniform. In some cases, he has a cook with the same first or last name as a contest winner, and in other cases he does not. There is only a 50/50 chance that a contest winner with the same name will win again. Fry wants to know how many days must pass before there will be a cook with the same name wearing the same uniform twice. For example, if a pink-wearer wins in 5 days, there will be a blue-wearer with the name "i" in 6 days.<n>Output: Assume that a contest winner with a name ends in "i" or "y" gets a pink uniform, and else gets a blue one. In 10 days we want to have two "i" with pink and two "i" with blue. But that happens in only 5 days. So we need 1/3 more days and we get to the solution in 15 days.<n><n>Input: Tom lost 3 matches in a row and is playing against a human grandmaster. There are no more matches, but Tom is a very intelligent computer program. How many draws could Tom expect from this game?<n>Output: If Tom had won the last match he would know the strategy. So he calculates a strategy. The way to do it is if Tom draws he just plays his strategy. But it is not likely to happen so the chance is very small, but if it does happen it will happen after 2 or 3 games against a grandmaster. So there is a 1/3 chance that Tom would draw after playing 3 games even though he lost the first three. Therefore the chances that his computer will eventually draw will be 1/2. If this happens Tom's strategy might be so strong that this strategy would probably take the lead in the whole world. But that is not what Tom would expect most or will happen. The chances that Tom would eventually draw will

What is your average speed in miles per hour if you drink coffee at a rate of.005 miles per day, and it becomes cheaper by $5 with each order?<n>Output: When the price drops for every order you place, you consume the coffee more quickly because you do not have to save as much money.  So you consume the first 2 cups in.005 * 2 = <<2*0.005=0.1>>0.1 miles per day.<n>Each order after that is cheaper by $5, so you spend.005 - 5 = <<.005-5=<-5>>-5 less money and you buy 4 cups of coffee instead of 2 before you are again denied another one.<n>So order 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 you will drink.005 * (1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 8)* <<.0

The Role of the Media in Defining Higher Education in the US’ stated that the American media plays a crucial role in defining and redefining what higher education means and its role in society. In particular, the media in America defines and redefines higher education, its role in society and its place in society. As a consequence, American universities are influenced by how their mission defines their role in society. The research revealed that the media in America is more likely to report on the negative issues in society, such as crimes, violence, and death than they are on positive issues. This is because they report on news that has the potential to influence society and bring about social change. The role of the American media in defining and redefing the role of higher education and its role in society is crucial.<n>A key aspect of America’s role in defining higher education and its role is to inform society about the quality of education and its role in education. By focusing on issues that are of concern to society, the media also helps to define what the role of the media is in defining society. American universities are constantly under the microscope of the media. With such an influential media, it is understandable that university administrators are often concerned about what the media might report. It is, therefore, important that America’s higher education institutions continue to inform and educate the media about the role of higher education in society.<n>A key aspect in Fitton’s view on the role of media with regards to education was to emphasize the importance of a coherent message by America’s higher education in informing and educating the media about the role and place of higher education in society (Fitton 2022). In this regard, universities must also take steps to work with the media to provide a coherent and consistent message. In other words, the media is not always the best medium to get the message across when universities are concerned about an important societal issue.<n>

If we took a species list, we could find that the number of animal species on earth is two times the number of humans on earth.  Let us say that every human person weighs more than 150 pounds and that each animal weighs more than one pound.  How much more, in pounds, would this be compared to humans?<n>Output: First, the number of animal species is (2*20,00,001-1)=20,001,000 species.<n>Next, we get that in average each person weighs (150/20,005)=8kg and each person eats in average (5k/2)=2.5kg a day which is equal to around 75kg per week.<n>Therefore ( 75*1/20,011/100*7)=7.175 times more is eaten and therefore 8+0.8716= 9.139 times more is weighed.<n>So in total 9.138 kg times each animal species= <<9.138*20,010,000=183,632>>183,648.<n>So the final weight is 183,668 kgs<n>Solution: 183600>183632<n>```<n>

Why are classes a good abstraction? What makes a good class? How do classes get instantiated?<n><n>A class is a template used to group functionality together into units. It is often used to organise code and is an excellent way to make code more reusable and easier to comprehend.<n>What makes a good class?<n>When writing a class it should exhibit the properties of following: *Single responsibility. Code should be responsible for a single task, that way it will be easier to read and maintain.<n>*Descriptive and meaningful named variables. Variable names should be descriptive, meaningful and follow consistent pattern<n>*Declarations. Classes should not need to import other classes. This prevents accidentally changing dependencies.<n>*Tests. Classes should be subject to unit tests both for testability and to guarantee functionality.<n>*Low coupling. Classes should exhibit low coupling. Classes which couple together do not make changes independently of each other, and are also incapable of performing independent tasks.<n>*Immutable. This is to ensure values once passed into methods do not change. This prevents side effects and other unintentional behaviour.<n>*Immutability: No classes/functions can be assigned a new value. Every class have only one constructor. This make all instances unique. As long as the state is not modified it will not change. This reduces unwanted side effects.<n>How do class get instantiated?<n>The class is created whenever a object is call to instantiate the class. The instance holds a reference to the object itself which keeps track of it's state and is

It will solve the puzzle by adding in the digits of the smaller number and then checking if the resulting number is greater than the 10-digit target. Do not check if the sum is lower than the target, since if the 2-digit number is zero then they are not really adding anything.<n>The solution should return a boolean value with the answer TRUE or FALSE.<n><n>The second method is one that can generate a random 100 *2-digit number, and another 100 *10 digit number.<n><n>This method can be done by shuffling any 100 numbers into one array, and picking two smaller random numbers from the array and then comparing them using a modulo operation. If it greater than 6, then this is considered lowercase, and if it is lower than 6, it is considered upper case. This modulo operation can be applied to any number and can generate the number after the letter.<n>You can generate this modulo from any mathematical modulo such as the ones explained here: https://blog.junelabs.com/2014/06/04/how-to-generate-random-numbers-with-modulo-in-javascript/<n><n>###Instructions:You need to have your program use your methods to find a combination of the smaller numbers that add up to the target number.

It’s estimated that $750 million is stolen from the nation each year by an organized crime group, and the nation spends $25 billion to feed families. A nation’s GDP is defined as the nation’s current production, which is the income the owners earn from the market value of the nation’s goods and services produced in a year. We assume the crime group steals the same percentage of the GDP it did the previous year, which is 50%. The current incomes of the people are assumed to be constant. The nation is able to increase food donations, because it is increasing its wealth by $25 billion. If the nation could increase its wealth at a rate of 10% each year as a whole, what would the current percent of people living in poverty be in each year? _Please give an approximate answer, rounding as necessary._<n>Output:  In year 1: 300-75-25 = <<300-7.5-25=-27>>-27million left over to keep people from poverty<n>In year 2: 300-(75+25) = <<300-(100)-0>>-0 million less GDP = <<100-0-0>>0 million stolen.<n>So in year 2, 100 million left over, and 10% is 10/100 = <<10/10=0.1>>0.1 more from the GDP.<n>So in year2, 300-82=$<<300-8.2=-222>>-222 million to keep people from poverity.<n>In year 3:300-(82+222) = <<30-302>>3<n>So in year 3, 300 million less GDP, 20 less stolen, 30 million left over, so 110% of the percentage of people who are getting money this year will keep people from poverity in year 3<n>Output2: In year 4: 300 - 82 = <<300 - 10.

In 1637, French mathematician Pierre de Fermat announced his finding - which he called a "truly marvellous proof" - that the equation had no solution.  He left us with the words "it is impossible to separate two numbers with a given difference and a given square, I bet no one can discover a trick."  For centuries, people tried to come up with a solution.  However, no one was able to do it.  It was in 1954 that the mathematician Gabor H. Mali discovered what he thought was a proof. He thought his mathematic discovery would finally put to an end the quest for a solution for the Fermat equation and that there exists a marvellous proof.  But his colleagues were not convinced and he was forced to admit that he was mistaken.  So, for now, the Fermat equation remains one of the most beautiful unsolved problems in mathematics.<n>Output: The answer for this question is A<n><n>Input:(5) + (5) →?<n>Output: 10<n><n>Input: (5) + (5/2) →?<n>Output : 7<n><n>Input: (3) + (5) */ (5) + (3) →?<n>Output:(3/5) + (5)/(5) →?<n><n>Output: (1) + (3) = 4<n><n>Input:(5/2) + (10) →?<n>Output :- (2) + (5) = 7<n><n>Input:(5-4) + (7-6) →?<n>Output:- (1) + (1) = 2<n><n>Input: [(5 - 5) + (4 + 4)] * (5 - 3) + [(4 + 4 - 4) + (5 - 5)]<n>Output: [(1 - 5) * (6 - 2) + (1 - 3) * (7 - 4)] <n><n>Input: [(6 - 2) * (1 + 1)]<n>Output: [(4 - 1) * (3 + 3)]<n><n>Input: [(4 -

The winning move on the 12, 14, and 16 is a single-blocking move.  If you start making a single-blocking play and have a winning move on the 9x9 then is it possible to continue on and  not give your opponent a winning move?<n>Output: On a 12, 2 chances are won in a single-blocking.  So on the 14, 3 is won, where it is impossible to win on the 16, 4.  The winning number can never decrease, so there is only 1 winning move possible even after making your own winning move and leaving the opponent with options that could possibly create a winning move for themselves.<n><n>Input:A team lost its best player and found it lost by 5. The winning ratio of the team is 4:3 in the regular season.  So to decide how many points are needed to win, we multiply 5 by the winning ratio and subtract from 4.  And we get 20 -5 = <<5*4/3=20-5>>20-5.<n>So the team needs 20-5=<<20-5=15>>15 points to win.<n>So the final value is 15 points.<n><n>Input:In the 2017 NBA Finals, how many points did Golden State Warriors score with each layup in 4 minutes to end the 4th quarter of Game 3 in the Finals?<n>Output: Each lay up accounts for 1 point.

Choices:  A: the roof B: storage cabinet C: car trunk D: retail store E: home<n>Output:		You have your choice between options A, B, and E. For option A, this isn’t possible because you are driving, and because the bag is open when you get in the car (which might cause an accident), therefore option B is the best choice. For option B, the bag is in the car, and also it might get stolen since the car is parked (you have the option to lock it up, but that is extra work on top of other options), so option C is the best choice. So the final answer is C<n><n>Input:You are standing near two friends walking in opposite directions 5 meters away from you, one going south and the other heading west, when a bus driver honks his horn 14 meters away from you.  In which direction will he be coming around the curve? Choices:  North  South  East  West<n>Output: In this situation there are two main possibilities - you won’t see him until after he is around the corner, or you would have already seen and heard him coming from the right, and it is highly unlikely you would confuse him with your friends who are moving toward you. In this case, you are more likely to turn in the direction the other friend who’s going the same direction as you is walking, even though you never saw the bus. So the final answer will be the same direction as they are walking, even if the bus is not coming from the right side.<n><n>Input:If the bus is coming from the left/right, turn in the direction your friend would be if he saw the bus coming. Choices:  In the direction the bus is coming if the bus is coming from behind  In the opposite direction the bus is coming where your friend is heading  In the opposite direction of the bus if the bus is coming into view In your direction  In the direction of the bus if you see it coming  In the direction your friend is heading if the bus is not in view<n>Output: Let’s say the bus is coming by you from the right. You then need to know the direction in which the bus is coming. If you are seeing it, that means it is coming towards you. Also if it is coming from in between your two friends, the direction of motion tells you that it’s coming from the right. On the other hand, if you’re not seeing it, then the direction of motion is irrelevant. So in this particular scenario, the answer will

So engaging in chatting has its benefits.<n><n>Input: Why do people engage in reading books in the afternoon? Choices:  Filling the time Gaining knowledge C: entertainment D: fun E: relaxation <n>Output: I don’t think gaining knowledge is a good reason for people to read books.

In fact many young people don’t read and have poor English ability, even if they have access to many books. So, even if it seems like you are increasing your knowledge, it’s not really true.  It’s an illusion.<n>

There was a 40% chance that each one of the bikes was stolen. What was the probability of getting more than one unlocked bicycle?<n>Output: We can solve this by thinking about if it had a 40% probability of getting a locked bike, we will randomly choose a bike, and a percentage of 40% represents that it can be stolen. But the percentage represents the probability of having a bike stolen, and if we are choosing a bike from a group that has a 40% change of being stolen, we will get 40/100*.4=<<.4=10>>10 locked bikes, since in the first step we chose 12 bikes from a group of 13 bikes.<n>The same thing can be applied to unlocked bicycles, we can choose a bike in the group with a 60% chance of being unlocked. So 60/100 *.6 = <<.6=3>>3 unlocked bicycles.<n>So if we get one from the probability above the we will get 4 + 3 = <<4+3=7>>7.<n>If we got the maximum two, we will get (4 + 3) + (4 + 3)=<<4+3+4+3=14>>14 unlocked bicycles<n>So the final answer for this problem is [14 / 14][14 / 13]<n><n>Input:Rebecca can clean 265 house a month.

How can you find the minimum number of replacements necessary for the new digit string to be a prime number?<n>Output: The first solution with the first question is to divide 6. You get 1/10. Therefore replace the first 5 digits with the first 5 digits of the random number. Then there will be 1 more digit after that. It is not prime, so add another number into the last digit and do the same process.<n><n>The second solution is to go again with the same algorithm and the second question. First divide 10 by 6. You get (5/6). Therefore replace the first 6 digits with the first 6 digits of the random number, then there will be 1 digit after that. Again the first digit is not prime, so go to the second number. Replace the second 5 digits with the second 5 digits of the number, then there will remain 1 digit. This digit is also not prime, so we go to the next number and so it goes.<n>

I was told 25 acres per person. But instead of 126 acres per person, there should be 75 acres per person. (For the 220 acres we were using it would be dividing 220 by 7.59 instead of 220 by.22 in the case of 126). This difference is due to me misreading 7.59 as.22.<n>Therefore, we are currently using <<7.59*40+9.865+40*4.0>>40 acres per person.<n><n>**Input:** The number of goals scored by one specific team in league matches last season accounts for 50% of all goals that were scored.

How much memory does it take to store the integer in a RAM that is 16-bit wide?<n>Output: A certain 8-bit integer takes two 16-bit words to store. Whenever we look at any number, we can break it into two parts. The first part is called the sign bit and the second part is called the mantissa. The sign bit is always stored in a sign bit RAM which is 8 bit wide. and the mantissa is stored in 16-bit mantissa RAM. Therefore, we need to store 8 * 2 data word to store the integer and 4 additional 16-bit bits to store the sign bit. Thus we need 12 16-bit data words and 4 additional 8-bit sign bit words. Therefore we need 40 16 bit words. Each word takes 4 bytes. So there are 50 bytes.<n>The answer to this question: 16-bit width takes 20 bytes of 16-bits = 16 bytes. The 8 bits sign bit takes 4 bytes. There are 16 bytes less than 40 in our answer. Therefore our answer is incorrect<n><n>Input: A particular 8-bit positive integer is stored in a computer using an 11-bit code.

If Mike, his friends, and his family have dinner at the restaurant 3 times in the next 2 weeks, how much does Mike and his friends pay in a 2 week period.<n>Output: The bill on Monday night is $<<100*1.75>>175<n>That means the rest of the time the bill is 175/2=$<<175/2=87.5>>87.5<n>So on Monday night Mike and his friends pay $87.5*3=$<<87.5*2=175>>173.8<n>And then Monday night Mike and his family have dinner there so the rest of the time they pay 175-87.5=$<<175-88.75=86.25>>86<n>$3 *7*87.5+86=$<<7*9*86>>862<n>So the final answer to the question is 862<n><n>Input: Mary eats 195% of the normal amount of food needed to maintain her body weight.  If her regular eating habits change to 225% of what is needed to maintain her weight then how much weight will she gain?<n>Output: Mary's regular eating habits are such that 225% is more than 195%.  If it's 225% more then she will need to gain weight at 225%/195%=<<225/195>>2.32x<n>So her weight will increase in 225%/(195%+2.32x)%=<<224%/(195+2.32%>>2.32 <n>So her weight will go by

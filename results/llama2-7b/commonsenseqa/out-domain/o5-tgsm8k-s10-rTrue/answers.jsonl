To start we need six trucks. Each truck has a 25 ton max load. How many trucks are there after we have cement in back of every truck?\nOutput: We start with 6 trucks that have a max load of 25 tons, each will have the option of holding 25/2=<<25/2=12.5>>12.5 for the extra 25 tons (this is the part with 25 tons in back of each truck)\nNow that we have the extra 12.5 tons we need to find the new max load of each truck. 12.5 * 1=<<12.5*1=12.5>>(the part with 1 added, since the total load should never exceed the max 25 tons)\nNow that we know the max load each truck we know we need 130 extra trucks.\n\nThis because 2*130=<<2*130==130>>130 total trucks, which leaves us with just the 6 trucks (since the 130 extra can hold the 25 tons each)\n\nSo the final answer should be 225\n\nInput: In the previous lesson we found that we need 134 trucks to make a total of 269 trucks.

{"text": "The baby cries because its eyes have not been exposed to the light before and now are filled with tears. We all know that when you\u2019re sad you cry.

They are our body\u2019s way of telling us that something is either good or bad for us.

{"text": "If he was driving he would put his luggage in the trunk, so the final answer is E\n\nInput: There were 25,000 votes in a certain county in a certain state. The winning party received more than 3/4 of the popular votes in the entire county. How many votes did the winning party receive in this county?\nOutput: First, we consider the case where the winning party obtained a plurality of votes.  Let _P_ be the number of votes that the winning party received.  If we then allow some members of party B to take second and third place if they had enough votes, and if we do not allow any members of party A to come in second or third or higher, then the plurality winner has to be a member of party A.  Since the winning party got 3/4 of all the votes, the only way this kind of tie could happen is if the winning party got 1/4 of the votes. So _P_ must divide evenly into 25000. This will give us 25,010, since we must allow a fraction of the winning party's votes to go to another party. Since the winning party has a plurality of the votes, _P_ cannot be larger than 25010.  (This is the solution to a standard logic problem used to test for plurality winners of office.)\nSo there are 19990 votes remaining for the winning party. Then let _P_ be the fraction of votes that the winning candidate gets. Since _P_ must be between 1/4 and 1, _P_ is equal to the quotient of the number of votes obtained by the winning candidate and 25001. So _P_ < 2501/25004 which is less than 2.\nSo the number of votes the winning party received is: 19991+25004-2501=<<19991>>19991 votes\nSo the final answer was 19995", "answer": "E: trunk"}

In a death penalty case, the likelihood of being executed increases the longer the person is on death row. However, the likelihood of overturned convictions increases the longer the person has been incarcerated. A shorter stay in jail reduces the time where there is even a chance that a mistake has been made, and increases the probability that the person on death row actually did what they were convicted of doing. The data is collected on a state level and does not include people who receive the death penalty and never go through the appeals process.

The computer is capable of making a move that guarantees they\u2019ll be at least n points ahead after their next move. At the start of the game, the human is ahead by ten points. How many moves does the human player to win?\nOutput: To have an infinite amount of knowledge of the game, the computer must be able to calculate the state of the game after any move, which is the result of some action\nSo the first move that would lead to a situation where the human player is at 10, is 3.\nThe next move that would lead to the same situation is 3+1=4.\nContinuing this pattern: 3+1=>>4+1=3<<\nSo after 3 moves, the human has a point lead.\nAs it continues to add 1 for each time it plays, it will eventually have an infinite amount of points and the human player will never be able to win without sacrificing his life. But if it only added 1 in the end, the human player will be able to win.\nSo the final move it makes is 2+1=<<3+1=4>>4\nSo this means the computer has infinite knowledge of the game, and it\u2019s a draw!\nIn a real game however it\u2019s infinite \ud83d\ude42\n\n\nInput: Adam is learning Spanish, but sometimes wants to talk in Portuguese.

All cooks whose names end in \"i\" wear pink uniforms, and all those with names ending in \"y\" wear blue ones. For example, Lori was the only blue-wearer whose name ended in i.\nEvery year Fry has a contest to give a uniform.

{"text": "E: Mail box\nWhy? Because the Mail Box would already contain all letters, and the post office also contains letters.\n\nNext you would need to count the number of ways to select the letters.  First count the order of the letters in the mail box.  For two letters, the number of ways they can be ordered is 2!.  For three letters as, b, c, we have 3!/2!=120 and for n! we have n!.\n\nIn one place I was given A, B, C, D and E.  It was said that the post office was an option.

How many gallons of gasoline will he need to travel the required distance?\nOutput:\nFirst, we need to determine the distance.  According to a [website](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_per_hour):\n\nMiles Per Hour - Speed in mph\n---------------------\nKilometers Per Hour - Speed In Km / Hr\n------------------------------\nMeters Per Hour - Acceleration In m / s\n----------------------------------\nCesium Standard Second - S.S\n---------------------------\nOne hour = 2678400 milliseconds\n\nLet mph = km/h and mph = m/s.\n\n2 mph/1 = 2 km/h = 2 m/s\n\n60 mph = 1 hour = 3600 sec\n  \n26784 mph * 2 mph/1 mph = mph\n\nOne hour = sec/hr\n\nmph\nNow, to solve, you really don't need to know how much fuel it takes to go 1.8 litres of gasoline.  All you need to know is how much you have to get to go this far.\n\nAccording to a [blog](https://www.youtube.", "answer": "E: mail box"}

The Role of the Media in Defining Higher Education in the US\u2019 stated that the American media plays a crucial role in defining and redefining what higher education means and its role in society. In particular, the media in America defines and redefines higher education, its role in society and its place in society. As a consequence, American universities are influenced by how their mission defines their role in society. The research revealed that the media in America is more likely to report on the negative issues in society, such as crimes, violence, and death than they are on positive issues. This is because they report on news that has the potential to influence society and bring about social change. The role of the American media in defining and redefing the role of higher education and its role in society is crucial.\nA key aspect of America\u2019s role in defining higher education and its role is to inform society about the quality of education and its role in education. By focusing on issues that are of concern to society, the media also helps to define what the role of the media is in defining society. American universities are constantly under the microscope of the media. With such an influential media, it is understandable that university administrators are often concerned about what the media might report. It is, therefore, important that America\u2019s higher education institutions continue to inform and educate the media about the role of higher education in society.\nA key aspect in Fitton\u2019s view on the role of media with regards to education was to emphasize the importance of a coherent message by America\u2019s higher education in informing and educating the media about the role and place of higher education in society (Fitton 2022). In this regard, universities must also take steps to work with the media to provide a coherent and consistent message. In other words, the media is not always the best medium to get the message across when universities are concerned about an important societal issue.", "answer": "A: fast food restaurant"}

Why are classes a good abstraction? What makes a good class? How do classes get instantiated?\n\nA class is a template used to group functionality together into units. It is often used to organise code and is an excellent way to make code more reusable and easier to comprehend.\nWhat makes a good class?\nWhen writing a class it should exhibit the properties of following: *Single responsibility. Code should be responsible for a single task, that way it will be easier to read and maintain.\n*Descriptive and meaningful named variables. Variable names should be descriptive, meaningful and follow consistent pattern\n*Declarations. Classes should not need to import other classes. This prevents accidentally changing dependencies.\n*Tests. Classes should be subject to unit tests both for testability and to guarantee functionality.\n*Low coupling. Classes should exhibit low coupling. Classes which couple together do not make changes independently of each other, and are also incapable of performing independent tasks.\n*Immutable. This is to ensure values once passed into methods do not change. This prevents side effects and other unintentional behaviour.\n*Immutability: No classes/functions can be assigned a new value. Every class have only one constructor. This make all instances unique. As long as the state is not modified it will not change. This reduces unwanted side effects.\nHow do class get instantiated?\nThe class is created whenever a object is call to instantiate the class.

So, from the numbers given, they would want to invest $3.5 billion\nSo the final answer they will want to is 3.5\n\nInput: The company is looking to move into new office space.  They need at least 8 rooms, with a minimum width of 15 feet each.  They want to pay at least $680 per room.  How much will they need to spend?\nOutput: Given 8 rooms, each at least 15' wide and each costing at least $68, that means they have to choose at least one room that is wider and costs $680\nSo let's say they found 8 rooms at 16' wide that is at most $50 more per room than 15' wide rooms.  That works out to $680, $68.0, $825.\nThat leaves room for 7 8-15' rooms that cost a maximum of $50,900.\nTotal that works out to at least $50,980.  But they could have actually spent more than $50,960 for the rooms\nSo the final answer will be at least 50,981\n\nInput: The shipping company has 3, 5-digit routes, and 6 workers.\nTo ship the boxes, one worker must ship 2 of the routes, while any other worker must ship a single route.\nIf all routes are at least 30 miles apart, how many combinations are there?\nOutput: We can arrange the routes like this\n553", "answer": "B: insignificant"}

{"text": "C\n\nInput: In a country of $300 million, 150 million people live in poverty. It\u2019s estimated that $750 million is stolen from the nation each year by an organized crime group, and the nation spends $25 billion to feed families. A nation\u2019s GDP is defined as the nation\u2019s current production, which is the income the owners earn from the market value of the nation\u2019s goods and services produced in a year. We assume the crime group steals the same percentage of the GDP it did the previous year, which is 50%. The current incomes of the people are assumed to be constant. The nation is able to increase food donations, because it is increasing its wealth by $25 billion. If the nation could increase its wealth at a rate of 10% each year as a whole, what would the current percent of people living in poverty be in each year? _Please give an approximate answer, rounding as necessary._\nOutput:  In year 1: 300-75-25 = <<300-7.5-25=-27>>-27million left over to keep people from poverty\nIn year 2: 300-(75+25) = <<300-(100)-0>>-0 million less GDP = <<100-0-0>>0 million stolen.\nSo in year 2, 100 million left over, and 10% is 10/100 = <<10/10=0.1>>0.1 more from the GDP.\nSo in year2, 300-82=$<<300-8.2=-222>>-222 million to keep people from poverity.\nIn year 3:300-(82+222) = <<30-302>>3\nSo in year 3, 300 million less GDP, 20 less stolen, 30 million left over, so 110% of the percentage of people who are getting money this year will keep people from poverity in year 3\nOutput2: In year 4: 300 - 82 = <<300 - 10.", "answer": "D: italian restaurant"}

{"text": "The answer is A\n\nInput:If you were to ask a mathematician about the most beautiful solution to a mathematic equation, they would probably point you to the Fermat equation.  In 1637, French mathematician Pierre de Fermat announced his finding - which he called a \"truly marvellous proof\" - that the equation had no solution.  He left us with the words \"it is impossible to separate two numbers with a given difference and a given square, I bet no one can discover a trick.\"  For centuries, people tried to come up with a solution.  However, no one was able to do it.  It was in 1954 that the mathematician Gabor H. Mali discovered what he thought was a proof. He thought his mathematic discovery would finally put to an end the quest for a solution for the Fermat equation and that there exists a marvellous proof.  But his colleagues were not convinced and he was forced to admit that he was mistaken.  So, for now, the Fermat equation remains one of the most beautiful unsolved problems in mathematics.\nOutput: The answer for this question is A\n\nInput:(5) + (5) \u2192?\nOutput: 10\n\nInput: (5) + (5/2) \u2192?\nOutput : 7\n\nInput: (3) + (5) */ (5) + (3) \u2192?\nOutput:(3/5) + (5)/(5) \u2192?\n\nOutput: (1) + (3) = 4\n\nInput:(5/2) + (10) \u2192?\nOutput :- (2) + (5) = 7\n\nInput:(5-4) + (7-6) \u2192?\nOutput:- (1) + (1) = 2\n\nInput: [(5 - 5) + (4 + 4)] * (5 - 3) + [(4 + 4 - 4) + (5 - 5)]\nOutput: [(1 - 5) * (6 - 2) + (1 - 3) * (7 - 4)] \n\nInput: [(6 - 2) * (1 + 1)]\nOutput: [(4 - 1) * (3 + 3)]\n\nInput: [(4 -", "answer": "C: unpredictable"}

What was the probability of getting more than one unlocked bicycle?\nOutput: We can solve this by thinking about if it had a 40% probability of getting a locked bike, we will randomly choose a bike, and a percentage of 40% represents that it can be stolen. But the percentage represents the probability of having a bike stolen, and if we are choosing a bike from a group that has a 40% change of being stolen, we will get 40/100*.4=<<.4=10>>10 locked bikes, since in the first step we chose 12 bikes from a group of 13 bikes.\nThe same thing can be applied to unlocked bicycles, we can choose a bike in the group with a 60% chance of being unlocked. So 60/100 *.6 = <<.6=3>>3 unlocked bicycles.\nSo if we get one from the probability above the we will get 4 + 3 = <<4+3=7>>7.\nIf we got the maximum two, we will get (4 + 3) + (4 + 3)=<<4+3+4+3=14>>14 unlocked bicycles\nSo the final answer for this problem is [14 / 14][14 / 13]\n\nInput:Rebecca can clean 265 house a month.

I was told 25 acres per person. But instead of 126 acres per person, there should be 75 acres per person. (For the 220 acres we were using it would be dividing 220 by 7.59 instead of 220 by.22 in the case of 126). This difference is due to me misreading 7.59 as.22.\nTherefore, we are currently using <<7.59*40+9.865+40*4.0>>40 acres per person.\n\n**Input:** The number of goals scored by one specific team in league matches last season accounts for 50% of all goals that were scored.

How much memory does it take to store the integer in a RAM that is 16-bit wide?\nOutput: A certain 8-bit integer takes two 16-bit words to store. Whenever we look at any number, we can break it into two parts. The first part is called the sign bit and the second part is called the mantissa. The sign bit is always stored in a sign bit RAM which is 8 bit wide. and the mantissa is stored in 16-bit mantissa RAM. Therefore, we need to store 8 * 2 data word to store the integer and 4 additional 16-bit bits to store the sign bit. Thus we need 12 16-bit data words and 4 additional 8-bit sign bit words. Therefore we need 40 16 bit words. Each word takes 4 bytes. So there are 50 bytes.\nThe answer to this question: 16-bit width takes 20 bytes of 16-bits = 16 bytes. The 8 bits sign bit takes 4 bytes. There are 16 bytes less than 40 in our answer. Therefore our answer is incorrect\n\nInput: A particular 8-bit positive integer is stored in a computer using an 11-bit code.

Your fitness coach offers a $30 discount if you sign up more than 60 days ahead of time. How much will you save if you sign up 58 days ahead of time?\nOutput: 55 days\n\nAssumption: The $30 discount is only available if you sign up exactly 60 days in advance.\nIf you sign up 60 days in advanced, you pay $55*5=$<<$55*5=275>>275 for the race.\nNow, if you sign up 61 days in advanced, you get a $30 discunt which means pay $25*5=<<$25*5=125>>125 for the race. So $125*5=$<<125*5=625>>625\nBut if you sign up 1 day late, you do not receive the $30 discount so you pay $55*$1=$<<$55*$1=55>>55 instead of $25*5=$30*5=$<<30*5=150>>150 for the race\nSo $225+5=$<<225+5=226>>226 less than with the $30 discunt\nSo the final answer $125\n\nInput: Choose a number from 1 to 9, inclusive.

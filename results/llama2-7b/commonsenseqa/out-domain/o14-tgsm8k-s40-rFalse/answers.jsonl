The idea of an infinite sequence is not new. The Pythagorean theorem, based on ratios and integer repetition, can be traced back as far as 1748 B.C.E.  Mathematicians have recognized the importance of sequences and discovered their applications in many fields, including mathematics, engineering, and biology. A simple infinite sequence begins with any real number or integer, then adds on a series of integers or real numbers to this starting value. This simple form can be further generalized to also include the creation of other types of infinite sequences, such as binary sequences, geometric sequences, and harmonic sequences. Other infinite sequences can include rational numbers and even algebraic expressions", "answer": "E: heat up"}

{"text": "basin\n\nInstruction:Answer the following prompt.\n\nWhen we start learning math concepts, there are many similarities from how we learn addition to subtracting our age, to how many times something is.  There are also many differences between how we first approach math and how we understand those math concepts in deeper and higher levels.  There are many math problems that appear to be trivial, and have a very basic solution.  However, those very simple formulas can have subtle variations that can greatly affect the answer.  These different variations are the core of mathematics, and are something you need great precision and understanding to master.  For example, with simple arithmetic like addition and subtraction, the answers can vary by rounding units of measure in an operation.  Or, adding the same base number (like 2) multiple times can yield different answers.  In addition to math problems where the answer is affected by rounding or unit variation, there can also be mathematical formulas for a certain operation in place where we would be familiar with different variations, like the number of apples in a bunch being used for the number of apples.  This isn't the case.  As you get into advanced arithmetic, the formulas have different variations.\n\n\n\nYou can see these examples every Friday night as I serve you dinner.  I serve you spaghetti nightly,  except Thursday - that day the spaghetti is replaced with a casserole.  But when do we get to choose when you get your spaghetti?  Well, you get spaghetti after you get your entree, which is served on Friday night,  except Thursdays when the entree is served on Wednesday night, and on Mondays, when it is served on Saturday night.\n\nWhen your entree is served, it is served before the main course, which is an entree served after dessert, which is served after the main course, and after the side dish, which is served after salad, which is served after bread, which is served after vegetables, which are served after breakfast.\n\nWhen do we get to choose between spaghetti and casseroles?  Every Friday through Sunday nights, except Monday through Thursday, when you have one day left to make a choice, where you get to choose between the two options.  The other nights are where you make your choice on which spaghetti dish", "answer": "D: earth"}

These are then compared to previously processed strings of letters. For each string where letters of the string match letters in a pre-existing string, and the string is less than 3 characters long, the letters are added up and the result is returned.\n\nIn the simplest case, if we are matching a string of the same length against itself, we can quickly return the string length. For example, the simple case where the word \"ABCDE\" is compared against \"ABCDE\", the total count will be 6.\n```\n\n```\nFrom there we add 1, in this case:\n\nIf the string is just longer once because there is a 'D' in front of the letter 'D', or a 'B' at\n     the end of the string, then we add the length of the string with the extra letter.\n     For example, the simple comparison between \"ABCDE\" and \"ABCD\" would require us to add 1.\n```\n\n### Instruction:Answer the second multiple choice question.\n```\nWhat is this method's use, and how does it compare the individual letters in a given string with \nthe individual letters in a \nstring passed in, and add up the count? \n\n\n\n\n\n```\n### Instruction answer the questions below.\n\n\n```\ndef sum_of_the_digits(a_list):\n    total = sum(a_list)\n    digit_sums = []\n    for x in total:\n        digit_sum = digits(x)\n        digit_sums.append(digit_sums.index(max(digit_sum)) + 1)\n    for list_index, value", "answer": "D: garage"}

Today's date was Saturday, so yesterday evening, I made a grilled cheese sandwich and pizza out of my groceries.

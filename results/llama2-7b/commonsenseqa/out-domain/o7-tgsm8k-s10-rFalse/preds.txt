There are two types of food items: nuts & dried fruits. We would simply add the cost of both and solve for the final equation.<n><n>$$12n + 8x = 108$$<n>$$1000 = 2(12n + 4x)$$<n>$$250n + 50x = 2000$$<n>$$250(3) = 200\\ 50x =200\\ x = 4$$<n>We take the price of each food item and solve for our final solution.<n><n>### Exhaustion Principle:<n>If $$v = v_{n+1}$$is true for some value of $v_{n+1}$ and $$v = v_{1}$$is true for all values of $n$, we have what?<n>1. Prove $$\omega\epsilon \omega$$<n>2. Disprove $$\omega\epsilon\omega$$<n>3. Prove $$x \notin \omega$$<n><n>Answer: 2. Disprove it. Prove that it is false.<n><n>You may recall that a proof or disproof relies on what we call logical truths. You may recall that a logical truth is something which is always true or always false. A falsehood is what we call anything that is either not true or its opposite is true simultaneously.<n><n>Because a contradiction is always false, the logical implication is that the assertion $$\omega \epsilon \omega$$ or $$x \notin \neg \omega$$<n><n>$$\neg \omega$$<n>$$\mathbb R $$<n><n>To illustrate this with some simple examples, think of it this way. First, let's think of a logical truth. For example, it is a logical truth that whenever we take the product of two numbers, the product is greater than or equal to zero because we can see that in the cases when we take any of two numbers that are positive, or when we take a number that is negative and a number that is not zero, we end up with a product that is greater than or equal then zero since the negative times the non-zero results in getting a new value that has to be greater than or equal to the one you initially had since we cannot take a negative times

Which two animals do I like?<n>Output: cats and mice<n><n>Input: A bear has a certain amount of food each year from autumn to the end of the year (inclusive).  There are 4 bear species in the forest; each species has its own appetite and therefore receives an amount of food proportional to that bear species.  A bear's appetite is always equal to the product of the bear species index and the number of bears of this species there are in the forest.  The bear species index represents how big the species relative to the sum of all bear species indices. The sum of all bear species indexes is always equal to 100. The size of a bear in a species depends on the amount of food it has eaten.  If it reaches a certain threshold, its strength increases by one unit. Then in this case, it has eaten an additional 1.5 pints.  The amount of food in a bear's stomach is the sum of all the strength growth factors in a bear that has this amount of food in its stomach at a given time. Bear species indices are calculated for each bear at the beginning of the year.  Write a Python program to determine the size of the largest bear's stomached after the bear has eaten an amount of food proportional the amount of food this bear ate in a year.

Choices:  A: cash register B: desk drawer C: pay envelope D: throw away E: box<n>Output:		A<n><n><n>## #1 The correct answer is (A) 56. This is because 4 * 60=240 but Adam bought 3 * (60 - 20)= 40 and dried goods bought was 2.5 * ( 60 - 8) = 25. 56 = 40 + 25<n>##  #2 The correct answer is (E) C. It is because the person put the check or check at the cash register. After all, the check is a written form of money and then goes through a bank. So, you just put the check in a cash register to be paid (because most people don't put it in a desk drawer for security reasons).<n><n>## #3 The answer is 280.  The total fuel cost should be 20 + 2.5 = 3(because the tank costs 200 and the extra tank is 20 and it is just a simple calculation on the prices going up in double). The answer is 100 + (2*260) = 260. Multiplying 260 by 4 is 320 x 4= 1280, 320+ 1280 = 1600 but not 1600*200. There's a mistake in the last answer.<n><n>##  #4 the answer is 30 because every day Tom drinks 0.5g of soda plus 80oz(64 + 16) of water. A cup of ounce is 16oz. 5 + 64+ 16 + 32 + 48 = 160 which is equal to 2 pints. So, we can simply multiply 160 by 2 which is 320. and it is equal to 30 cups.<n><n>## <n><n>The Correct Answer is (D) 2. There are 3 days before the player works and 6 days before the player works with 6 other people which is equal to 9 days. So the total working days (including working days of 6 people) is 15. the total hours which we want is 15*(60/24). The answer

I was left confused, because I had the impression that he loved me too.  I wanted to ask him to stop fighting, because I feared it would go on forever and spoil our relationship, but after so many months of fighting I realized I no longer had any desire to be with him. I became angry and resentful of his frequent attempts to bring the past to life whenever we were together.  He fought with the people he loved the least,  and I believe this was because he had no self-awareness as to how he came across, nor how to deal with difficult situations in a calm and mature manner.  I wanted us to stop fighting because I desperately wanted him to be a calm and confident man who was not afraid of his own shadow.   The more we fought, the deeper my lack of self-confidence became, and the weaker my love for him became.    The more we fought,  the shorter the relationship actually lasted,  and the more upset I became that it was not working out properly.<n>Output: A<n>

That way the answer becomes $175 or 2750.<n><n>The second question is not as hard as you think. The key is to look at the problem twice. When the person goes to the gym he does not perform the action directly. That is why I say that he spends a third of it on warming up. He is trying to warm up himself for the action that is about to take place. Since warming up takes a third of the time he spends in the gym you will notice that he spends a total of 4 hours a week.<n><n>The solution for the third problem has to do with mathematical addition. We add 75% of the amount of times the players scored in the season. If we solve it we will solve it for any multiple. If there is a question like this with a multiplication like the one in the fourth question you have to do the same.<n>If we solve it with an addition question we will find that the equation looks like ($100 * 20%)/100%. In that case $100 * 1/5 = 20 (or $20).<n>If you get that one right you will find that the answer for the question number 5 should be close to $67.28 ($672.80) or even $66.88 as a rounding issue.<n><n>The sixth question can be solved by subtracting since it tells us that the two worked for four hours and we know the answer.<n>The seventh question only took us 5 minutes to solve.<n><n>We will use the word'medieval' in the final question. To find the answer for it you would have to look in

Your answer is  $12 x 2.5 + $15 x 3 = 56 dollars. <n><n>### Expranation for answer to problem #2<n><n>The answer is 8 hours beacuse 3 hours x 3 times equals 3 hours, 4 hours x 3 times = 4 hours<n><n>### Explnation for answer to problem#3 <n><n><n>You multiply 25 dollars x 120 percent to get 30 bucks. <n><n>## Explanation for answer of problem #4 <n><n><n>50 percent of 300 is 150.  So if one of the two players scored 150 goals that's the number that would total to $300.<n><n>### Expanation for answer for problem #5 <n><n><n>Multiply 5 x 50 ounces= 250. Add that to 30 x 60 = 1800. Total 1800 + 250 = 2050. Now answer the question that asks, how many "12 ounce drinks"? Answer is 1800 - 200 = 1600. <n><n><n><n>### Explantion for problem #6<n><n>Four people can each take half an hour.

Choices:  A: lake B: manhattan C: shoreline D: coastal area E: los angeles<n>Output:		C<n><n><n>#### Solution:<n>### 1. 3 * 12 + 1.5<n>### 2.  {9,8} + {27,24} +...=9+1*1/3=7<n>### 3. (75/100)*1200+(25/100)<n>### 4. 1+2/2 + 3/2 <n><n>#### Explanation:<n>The solution to question 1 is the easiest.  There is some confusion with what kind of cost.  I think the question meant total cost, and this is the intuitive way to find it.  I don't think there can be any other solution since its clearly worded.<n><n>As for question 2.  You might be tempted to write these set equations as {10*12,10*8} + {9*13,9*11}.  But, I believe the question is worded wrong.  I thought it might be better to combine the two sets by taking the intersection of the two sets.  In this case, our answer is 75*13 + 75*11 = 875.  This is simply 87.5 * 11<n><n>Question 3 is a bit more tricky.  So, first we note the number of times Adam visited the store.  He only bought two things in total so I would assume this number is 1 or 2, depending on whether he bought both things in the same visit.  I chose to assume it was one because there was no indication to assume otherwise.  However, if you decided to assume it was two, the solution would be exactly the same.<n><n>Now, for the time calculations.  If he bought one thing, he would travel to the store then back, and spend his time weightlifting at the gym.  Since there are 25 hours in a week, he could do this 5/25 of the time.  But, why? Why 4?  Well, we said he has to lift 1 kg in each weightlifting session, so we can add these up.  At the very least we have 1kg + 3kg = 4kg, but why then 4kg and not 3kg?  This is

On the 20th floor of the building there is a shop called "Fourth Floor Liquor" which sells bottles of beer at a flat rate of $25 regardless of brand. He buys 7 of them. On the 40th floor there is a shop "Fifth Floor Beers" which sells bottle of beer at 10% better price for premium brands. So James has to pay at least 5 times more than the 40th-floor shop for his favourite imported beer, Xbeer. Unfortunately, none of the shopkeepers is able to communicate.

This is how it looks:<n><n>### Step 1:Initialize<n><n>```python<n>ans[0]=-1<n>ans[1]=-1<n>ans[-1]=-1<n>```<n><n>## Step 2:Calculate<n><n>```python<n>#To handle positive cases that is 4-3 or 5, we will go into a loop and check<n>while ans[-1] or ans[0]!= -1:<n>    if (ans[-1]+1)%2==0:<n>        ans.append(ans[-1]+1), ans[0]<n>    elif ans[-1]+1 > ans[0]: #check if there is any number that is at 0<n>        ans.append((ans[-1]+1)*2)<n>        ans[0]=ans[-1]+1<n>    else:<n>        ans.insert(1,(ans[-1]+1)/2)<n><n>print(ans[0],ans[1],ans[4])<n>```<n><n>The output for 1 to 6 is as follows:<n><n>```python<n>[6,3,2]<n>[4,5,

This is more of an "aide" to keep track of the students' questions and to remind the 90% of students who are not diligently taking notes in class. It is designed to help students review and learn without taking up class time and teachers time. The student will receive 5 or 10 points based on the effort put forth in the homework. This project is not for honors or academic credit. The hope is that in a few years, teachers will spend more time actually communicating with students rather than marking a bunch of homework. We don't assign outrageous homeworks hoping our students die. We need to set appropriate priorities and allow for students to enjoy and play when needed.

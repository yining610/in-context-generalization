Choices:  A: liberal B: heretical C: recalcitrant D: conservadox E: heretical<n>Output:		D<n><n>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<n><n>## Answer:<n>I am assuming that you want to get the questions from the instruction: "Input: Twice the amount of money Jericho has, is 60." and "Input: Twice Jericho's money is $60."<n><n>I would suggest to solve the above question in multiple steps. Below is my attempt but please do not rely on my solution and solution might vary from each other.<n><n>#### Step 1: Get number of cards: <n>Consider the input sentence: "Mara has twice as many cards than Janet". Now Janet and Mara start with 0 and they got 9 and 18 respectively. So sum of number = 4(3*10) = 30. In above sentence, Mara's number of cards is twice Janet's number of cards, so 30 will divide in half (or we can increase Mara's number to get multiple of 2). So total number of cards = 152.<n><n>#### Step  2: How many cards do they both have in total: <n>Consider input sentence : "How many cards do they have altogether?". Now we already found the total number of cards both Janet and Mara have, so in total they must have 152 cards in total.<n><n>#### Step3: How many cards does Janet have:  "How many cards do Mara have?" :In this step we want to calculate the total number of cards Janet have and the answer should be 93. As per previous step we already know that sum of number 4(9/10), so the number of cards is 93.<n><n>Now we want to calculate the number of cards Mara have : In this step we want to get the number of cards Janet does not have. Consider the last line of input sentence : "Pete came home the same way". So that means he came back the same way, now when came back from bus garage to post office we know that he came from home and we also know that he met Mara there. Now assume Mara gave Janet 18 cards (half of her total number of cards), Janet still must have 75 cards. So again divide 75 by 2 (or let's increase Janet's number to get an

The width must be at least 6. If the length of the rectangle was 60 cm, what would its width be?<n>Output: 40<n><n>Input. For this exercise, you must first read over the following text at the bottom of this question.<n><n>The Pythagorean Theorem states that when you are given a right triangle and the length of its legs, or side segments, you can write down a numerical expression to compute the length of the hypotenuse. The expression for the hypotenuse looks something like this: a * b * b.<n><n>But, what if you don't have the a and b values yet? For example, suppose that a * b = 50. Then you could plug 50 in for b and compute 50 * x to get x = 10 or x = 20, right? But, wait, what if one of the two values for the legs is 40? Well, if a = 40 then b = which could mean that our new expression will now be 40 * 40 * a, or 40 * 20 * a, or even 40 * 10 * a. Now, how are we supposed to decide what is the right expression? We need some other information.<n><n>In the given problem, the expression is just this: 4 * 5 * 10 = 4 * 1 * 20, which is 4 times the first expression minus 4 times the second expression. So, given two values for the legs of a right triangle, what is our expression? Is it 2 * 5 * 5 or 2 * 5, or is it 2 * 4 * 5, and how do we decide?<n><n>You might answer that perhaps both of these expressions are valid. However, that may not necessarily be true. For example, suppose that the

The Control flow allows you to control the sequential order of things like: What line of code comes after which, what is entered into what screen, what is printed, etc. I have also found that the Control flow is one of the most difficult concepts to remember while learning programming. The best way to overcome this concept is by practicing a ton. Here are some of the key concepts you should understand about Control flow in Java:<n><n>1. If-Else Statements<n><n>2.

A drunk driver will hit a pedestrian when walking straight across the street. However, drunk drivers are not predictable, nor do they know what they are doing, and cannot follow the rules of the road. Thus, a drunk driver will be more dangerous approaching a pedestrian from across the street. So instead, pedestrians should look for drunk drivers, especially after dark. This is important, because sometimes a drunk driver will not notice a pedestrian and attempt to run over that pedestrian while attempting to pull onto the road. A drunk driver may not know he is driving onto a road when trying to cross the street. A drunk driver also may accidentally knock a pedestrian down and continue driving. Thus, pedestrians must also follow all laws, rules, and safety rules to avoid getting hit.  What should pedestrians do to avoid getting hit by a drunk driver? Choices:  Always cross at a crosswalk. Never cross a road unless you see where there are no cars. Follow all traffic signals and signs. Never look to see where the cars are.

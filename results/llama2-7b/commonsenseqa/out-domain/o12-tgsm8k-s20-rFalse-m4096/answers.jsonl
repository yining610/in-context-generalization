If you take the first row and add the 2nd, 3rd, and fourth row, and then subtract the second one. You get (8x2+5x4+7x3-6x8).\n```\n\nExplanation:You should subtract the fourth row, which is 6 from the first row which is 8.

Who gains more points after 4 rounds?\n\nInput: T: 1, -1, 1, -1 C: 1, 1, 1,-1\nOutput: T\n\n### Solution:\n\nI used the following to solve each problem:\n\n1. Create a new function that takes an input and returns the maximum integer that can store that input, e.g. 66 should return 8 since 8 < 66.\n    - This problem was done like this on the actual quiz.\n\n2. Create another function that takes an input, and returns the minimum integer that can store the input, e.g 29 should return 3 since 3 < 29.\n    - This part was done like the last part.\n\n3. Use the new function to create a new function that takes 3 inputs. The first being the maximum value, the second the minimum value, the third being the original value. Using the above values from part 2 and 3, I calculated 8 - 5 = 3.\n    - The third function is just something that takes input and returns a \"mod\" variable that can be used for later.\n\n4. Use the newly created mod function on the original input and compare it to the second input. This would return the second input if the answer is 0, the original input otherwise. This part checks to see if the original input is equal to the new value.\n    - This is something I couldn't test out before hand, since I'd need to know how to subtract and get the mod.\n\n5. In this step, I want to subtract the maximum value with the minimum value. I want to use mod on both new values, if the original is less than the minimum, then the answer will be the minimum. Vice-versa.\n6. Create a new function in which I can take input, 0.2 + 1/3 + 1 = 0.83333, and return the answer as a double.

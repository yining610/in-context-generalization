It took 4 hours and 15 minutes for Kaitlyn to travel from Denver, Colorado to Cedar City, Utah.  How long did it take her to drive from Bouldor to Cedar City?\nOutput: If you have a time input, you divide it by either 1 or 2 and add any remainder to it. Multiply any remainder by the other input's divisor and you will find the solution.\n\nDenver to Cedar City:  D(5h5m)/1 = 5 D(4h15m)/2 = 7 \n\nKaitlyn took 62 minutes by the above logic.  So if it took her 62 minutes to go from Denver to Cedar, it took her 482 minutes to go from Boulder to Cedar:  482 = 5-62 2+482 = 490 or 206 minutes.\nSo the final result is 206 minutes\n\nInput: The 5-digit phone number, 5378, was divided into 5 groups 40, 7, 7, 8, and 4 to form an anagram, or shuffled spelling, of the word EAST.

If they sail from port B, it will take them two hours to get to port C.  How many hours should they sail from port A without stopping?\nOutput:  Let (A=a,B=b,C=c)  A+a=b+2b=c+6c=9  We want to get to C as soon as possible, so we subtract c from both sides to get (a+a-c)(b+2b-b)=(b+2b-c)(a+a-c)  We rearrange for b, and then simplify to get b=23 which tells us it will take twice as long to get from B to C than it will from A to B\nSo we solve for a(the time they should spend at A w/o sailing) using the information that A+a=b:  a=b-3  If they spend three hours at A without sailing, then their final time is (b-3)+3=3hrs+3hrs=6hrs from A, B, port C.\nSo the final Answer is 6 hours\n\nInput: A cow is eating on one side of a fence.

It takes 2 hours to walk 10 miles. Which is faster?\nOutput: One way to show this comparison is to figure out how long it takes to go 20 miles. We multiply 15 by 20 = 300 and divide by 15 = 20 (15 min = 150 seconds = 9000/900s for 20 miles).\nTo go 300/20 = <<300/2=2>>2 hours.\nTo go 3 miles, it takes about 43 min 56 sec or 43.8 minutes.\nNext, we compare how long it takes someone to walk 100 miles (0.1 hours).\nTo walk 100, it will take 0.2 hours or 20 minutes.\nWe can multiply 0.20 by 100 to compare it.\nThe result is 20/100 = 0.20 (it takes 0.2 hrs = 120 min = 20000/2000s to go 100 miles)\nSo 20 (1.5 hrs) is faster than 100 (2 hrs).\nThis logic can be used for comparison (more than 2 items).\nFor example, in the case of time, we can compare the time to take 20 minutes against the time to do 20 items.\n\nInput:It is harder to get into the store using the stairs than to get into the back of the store using the elevator because: A) it is 10 times longer to take the", "answer": "E: freezer"}

So by subtraction, since each day is 2 years, there will be -2-2 =<<-2-2=-4>>a 2-year gap between 2998 and 3099.\nSo in 2978 there is a 3-year gap so in that time there will be 3 days in a week.

There are 56 different types of frogs. What is the smallest number that can fill up the table?\nOutput: C\nThere was a different table asked which required some kind of logic. Since 2 types have red, 42 different frogs have green, and 9 different frogs have purple. There are 8 spaces, so what is left is 3 frogs of the many colors. The minimum is 3, but there are 49 frogs left with 56 total. So we add one space, making it 4\nSo the answer is 3, however, there are 56 frogs and I think there should just be 7 colors at 7 frogs each. Otherwise, the number 12 would do because 12\u00d73 = 4, and there are 12 frogs with the same color in that table\n\nInput: Sara has 30 quarters, 5 dimes, and 4 nickels in her purse.

I normally eat about 1500 calories per meal.  I would like to eat a bit more, but I only have about 5 minutes to prepare myself a meal. How many calories could I safely eat with 5 minutes of preparation?\nOutput: At about 150 calories a minute it means you can prepare 35 minutes and get about 1/15 = <<1/15=6>>6 meals at 150 calorie meals per meal\nSince you're on a 1200+ calorie diet, a 5-minute dinner makes 100 calories over 1200 = <<1/1200=0.083>>0.083\nAs there are 6 meals, that's 0.083*6 = <<0.083 * 6=0.54>>0.54 calories over\nSince there really only are 5 minutes, that's 5 minutes per meal, you can eat about 0.54/5 = <<0.54/6=0.087>>0.087 calories\nSo the final answer, after rounding up to the nearest integer, is 50 calories.\n\nInput: Let's start with a positive.

What is the max number of each item Tara can buy?  Choices: A: 0 B: 1 C: 2 D: 3 E: 4\nOutput:  The first item was bought because it is the cheapest and then the price was doubled to make it as expensive as the second item, then we subtracted 1 from the left. It turns out that the second item is much cheaper, so we bought it instead and we subtracted 1 to the left because now all the items cost the same. The right of the equation indicates that buying items, a and b is more expensive. Item a is cheaper, so we can buy it. The difference is positive, so we bought item a. The difference is negative, so we bought item b. The equation turns out in that way, because if you buy all the items, the price has to be $72.69, not possible.\nSo, the answer could be item c as 3, item d as 1, item a as 0 and the max number of total items bought must be 4.\n\nComment: Can you explain the instructions for this one?

How much bigger was the third orc riding?\nOutput: This is a variation on one of my favorite story problems. Here's an alternative to the first way to do it. Firstly, the first orc is 1/2 the size of the ogres. Next, since the third orc was riding on the tallest of the three ogres, it implies that the third orc was on average 1/3 smaller than the ogres. Finally, the average makes the orc a number between the small orc and the large orc, so the third orc is 2/3 of the distance between the small and large orc.\nWe have two givens for 2 different ratios. First, the orc is half the size of the ogrrs. Let's call that (1/3). Second, the first orc can fit on the ogres. That is, if we divide the ogres into three (there are 2 ogres that could be paired with the smaller one), the smaller one is a factor of 3/2. The larger one is 2/3. We can use these two numbers to calculate the proportions: 1/3 = (2/4)/(3/2) and 2/3 = (3/4)/(2/2). Let x=((", "answer": "B: insignificant"}

If you pick a fork and it is the right fork which is red, what fraction of the time would you correctly choose the right fork?\nOutput: Rather than blindfolding us, we can look inside the box.  Since we have a box of 6 red apples, half the apples inside it are red.  Half half, so it is half and half.\nOr to look at it in another way of speaking as a fraction, it is 1/2, which can be denoted as 1 forked half or half forked a little.\nSo the answer would be 1/2.\nSo the final anewer is 1/2\n\nInput: If you have 5 oranges, 6 apples and a pear you're not satisfied, why?

C: The dough will have to be made twice as often if sold at twice the original pace. D: The baker will need to wait twice as long before they next bake. E: The dough will take twice as long to mature before it can be sold.\nOutput : If each time that the dough is baked it takes twice the time to knead the dough as bread is sold, then each time that the dotted bread is sold it takes twice the time as long  to make the dough as it does to sell the bread.\nLet d mean the time to knead dough, b mean the time the bake and t mean the time it takes to sell the bread. It is given that,  b = t and t = d. In this case d = b - 1\nThe meaning of if a = b, then  b = a - 2 is if the amount of time it takes to knead dough is equal to the amount of time it take to bake. In this case. d = b - 2 because to bake bread it takes twice as long to bake the bread. So  d=b -1\nSo, b - 1 = t - 1 is the equation to this problem\nHence the answer is \"d=b\"\n\nInput: How many squares fit into a space if the space is shaped like a triangle?\nSolution: There is", "answer": "A: shelf"}

If, after 3 hours of travel, the bus driver decided he wanted to drive faster, how far would the bus travel in an hour if he increased the speed of the bus to 45 miles per hour?\nOutput: First, we know that 30 miles per 1 hour is 30/1=30 If, after 3 of driving, the bus driver decided to increase the speed to 45mph then 45/1 = 45 In an hour the bus traveled 30 x 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 miles If we increase to 45 x 1 = <<45*1=45>>45 it would go 45 x 3 = <<45*3=135>>135 miles.\nSo the bus traveled a distance of 9 + 135 = <<9+135=144>>144 miles in the hour it took to reach 45.\nSo the final solution is 21\n\nInput: If Sara travels 41/3 times the distance traveled by Joe each day, what is the ratio of Joe's miles per day to that of Sara's?\nOutput: They both traveled the same distance.

{"idx": 263, "text": "The correct answer is E. When we breathe, the air we consume comes from a place that we do not breathe into and then we breathe into air that has been breathe by others before us.  You will only breathe in the same air for 90-120 seconds.  So the same air that people breathe in on the earth could be anywhere at any given moment (you would just have to breathe out at the same time).\nWe can then assume that even the air that people breatethrough their gums (a gas) is the same 90-100 times. The reason is, humans die on average before the 30s and their bodies decompose at a rate of 2 inches a year.   So since the air we breathe through our gums is no longer in the same place it once was in our gums, it is also recycled and breathed by others within minutes/hours of the same time we breathe it.\nSo we now just need to know why cricket stadiums would have air in them breathned by very few people recently and my answer is that they have to have it in order to make the game.  You need to breathein order to play a game so the recycled air has gone through a lot of players over time (not recent for this question) and is now breathed by new players.\nSo the final Answer is E. \n\nInput: There were 4 dogs, 2 cats, and 3 mice in the shed.

Find the maximum number of choices for which the answer is less than or equal to the word chosen.\n2. Find the maximum number that could be chosen and see if the answer is less than the chosen word.\n\nFor our example, we can find that A,B are less than or equal to our answer'suitcase'. So we chose A instead of B.\nLets get into the code implementation. We are creating new choice object every time we create a question.

For that we store it in the variable 'current_choice'.\nWe check answer in steps(1) and (2) for every choice in the question till the question is complete.\nIn first, we need to get the question index in the question list. We can get questions array index like questions[question_index].choices. So we can write a method in the Choice class as follow.\nget_question_index()\n{\n    return questions.indexOf(this)\n}\n\nThe function is defined in Choice class so it will be available to all Choice object.

There is no such method in Choice class, in that case we have to iterate over all answers in the current question to find which index is the option that we are looking for.\nThe method is called for every answers in the question, so by default when we first check if the answer is less or equal to the word our algorithm will fail for the first answer.

He read 76 pages each day for the week. If he finished reading the whole book by the end of the week, how long did he read for each day of the week?\nOutput: We first find the number of days of the week that he reads. We know that he finished reading 383 pages. If the entire story book can be read in 1 day, then we know that the number of pages in 1 day is 1/383 and the formula to find it is 383/(1/76) = <<383/(10/76)>>2.63 pages. Now we also know that one day equals 2.63 pages, so the entire question can be simplified to (76x24) (383/2.63)\nWe can substitute the value of 2.63 into the brackets to find his total minutes of reading for the day and his total reading minutes per day.\n((24)(2.63) +((24)(24)(2.53))) = <<24*2.63+((24)(2*4)(2.5))>>272.2 minutes\n383 minutes + ((24)(2.753))\n303 minutes\nSo the total for all seven days is 303 * 7 = <<303*7=2,111>>2,111 minutes of total reading time.\nSo the final amount is 2,111\n\nInput: The shop wanted to increase the amount of people they serve in a day.

{"idx": 314, "text": "A, B, C, D\nSo the final answer\n\nInput: In the world of programming, there are many different types of data structures. Each data structure can contain elements, for example, in an array, each element is just like an index number, and it represents an item. In data structures, there are also different types of data structures that can be used to display what the elements are. An array is used to represent something in a particular sequence. A map is a data structure that uses a key and a value to associate an item. A dictionary is a data structure that is like a map that uses a value and a key inside an array. For example, each key and value inside a dictionary is like an element. Another type of data structure that uses a collection of items is a list. A list provides us a way of keeping an ordered sequence of a collection of items. A stack uses last in first out where the items that are last in the stack are also first in the stack. For example, in a stack, when you have 10, 9, 8, 7, and 6, you will retrieve the number 6 first. Then when you want the number 2, the items will be retrieved like this, with the last items being retrieved first: 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. A queue is a type of data structure that is like an unordered list where you retrieve the items one at a time. Each item in a queue is called a \"link\". So a queue is like a list, but an unordered list.\nOutput: A list A is a type of \"data structure that uses a collection off items\" that are in an ordered list.\nA stack is another type of data structure that stores a collection on items. Just like a list, a stack is a data structure that stores a list of items. However, unlike a list, a stack stores items in a different order. A stack is a data structure where a collection of items are stored in a LIFO order.\nA queue is like a list because like a list, a queue is a data structure that store a collection of items in an unordered fashion. A stack is like a list because both of them are data structures that store a collection of item in unordered fashion. However, a stack stores items using FIFO order just like a list is unordered.

He is also very strict about the rules in his class, and students that are late or miss a class are penalized by his assistants. When he writes the final exam that year, Professor Green is required to give each student in his class, on their exams, the number of tardiness or absent points. If his assistants each grade an average of 5 exams, how many students must be absent if he receives 300 points?\nOutput: First, we know Professor Green has 16 students and two assistants. We want to know how many absent points he will have to give each student when he gets 300 points. In order to figure out how many absent points he must have to give to each person, we're going to have to find out how many extra points are there on his final exam for tardiness or missing classes. Let's call those extra points, \"points outside of 100.\" We'll call Professor Green's final exam \"100-Points outside of 10 points.\" If each student has 100 points on their final exam, he would get 300 \"points outside of 0\", which would equal 300 points for each of his students. If Professor Green does not have any points outside of 10, then all of his students could have 100 points without any extra \"points outside of 90.\" There are 263 students in his class, so we can figure out how many absent students there were in his class if we know how many points outside his 100 there were. How many absent points must he have to give each of his students? Let \"A\" = the number of absent students. Then the points outside of 120 = 100-A. A must be equal to (300/120), where 300 is the total number of points outside of 110 that he needs to give to the 16 students, and 120 is the number of students that could achieve 100 points, minus the number of absent students in his class.

The answer can be any number.\nOutput: There are 40 quarts in a car, each time the mechanic adds additional oil over his maximum allowed he is wasting one of each of his 40 quart caps.\nIf after putting in 5 quarts the mechanic can put in 1, then he can only put in 8 more quarts 5 + 8 = <<5+8=13>>13, which will fit the 40 quart cap\nSo the final answer the mechanic will use all 13 quart so 13, he puts 13 quart's into a 40 quart cap and will take up all 2 quart's worth, making the answer 13.\n\nInput: I was bunked off three consecutive classes last week.

If the store needs exactly 20 copies of each book, what is the average number of copies they need?\nOutput: There are three different levels of book sales in every bookstore.  When we consider books that can be sold in batches, the books of different levels may be mixed together in batches. The formula for averaging the numbers in a group or set.\nThe number of copies of each level of books sold at a bookstore is as follows\n3 = 5 + 3 =  <<5+3=8>>8 copies of specific books\n6 = 3 + 3 = <<3+3=6>>6 copies of books\n16 = 4 + 4 =  <<4+4=8>>8 copies for each book\n19 = 7 + 7 =  <<7+7=14>>1 4 copies of books\nAfter combining the different batches of books as follows\nBooks at Level 3 = 5 + [[3 + 3] + 4 + 7] = <8+6+8+8> 25 copies of books at level 3\nBooks at Levels 4 and 5 = 7 + [[4 + 4] + 6 + 7] =  <<7+4+6+7>>26 copies of levels 4 and 5 books\nThe total number of books sold is  [[5+[[3+3]+[4+4]]]+[7]] = <[[5+3+4]+7>22>22 copies of levels 1, 2, and 4\nSo, the average number of copies of each book at the store is  <22+22+22> 68 copies of each book\nSo the final answer will be 68\n\nInput: What is the value of 5 * 6 + 5 * 4 + 6 * 6 if each of the", "answer": "A: do crossword puzzle"}

So we want to find out if we had one winner or two.  Since this is a multiple choice question, we can use elimination and work backwards.  We know they are either both losers or both winners which narrows our choices to A, B, D, E.  It doesn't matter if it's one winner or two since that doesn't change the outcome of the question.  But since it doesn't change the game if it's one or two, and we knew that already, we can eliminate choices D and E.  That leaves A and B.  A is a losing factor and B is a winning factor, so we want to root for the team that wins or loses.  Since B is our winner/loser key, that means A is our resentment/envy key.

If you keep writing bad checks, then you may eventually get your bank account frozen until your bank trusts you again by writing a certified check for the amount that is too large. One method to double check that you have enough money to cover the amount written on the check is to add the amount of that check to the amount held in your checking account. However, if you accidentally write a check that is too much for your account because you made a mistake in your calculations, it may come close to bouncing your check when the amount you get will be too close to the amount you wrote.\nOutput: We know that $1,562+ $400= <<1562+400>=2000>>$2,000, so that means that our mistake was $2,162 - $2,000 = <<2162-2000>=162>>$162, and we see that our answer was $2,180, and we can tell that this check will not bounce because it is clearly less than $1,050.\nSo the final check is $170", "answer": "C: winning or losing"}

But if I ask you for 305 quarters, you might have to get the coins from a vending machine.  How much coins do I need, on average, to make the task of vending a quarter more efficient?\nOutput: The key idea is that the number of quarters requested varies inversely with the amount of change one receives.\nWhen the amount of change the vending machine will give to customers is the dependent variable, we can write the relationship as follows:\nC(n)=100*(1-0.5)^(n/100)\nAbove, C(n) is the number of coins requested,\nn is the number obtained,\n= is equal to, and\n100 is the number of quarters the machine will allow to customers.\nFrom above, we know that the coins requested increase directly with the amount received.\nLet's analyze the relationship in this new way:\nC(n) represents the number of quarters received when exactly n customers request quarters of this amount, therefore the number of quarters given to each customer is a percent of quarters. Let this percentage be:\nA= (100-C(n))/100\nTherefore the number of quarters per customer is:\nC(n)/a=(100-C)(n)/100\nC(n): The number of quarters. Note: the larger the number of quaters requested, the\nsmaller the average number of quaters per customer.\na: The percentage that a customer will receive. C(n) is not a constant and depends on the number of customers C(n).\nIn the first case, since 100-C = 98 it is very simple.  C(n)/a= 98/100\nLet's try a different case with different values.\nC(n)=40\na =50 because the customer received exactly half the value of his/her request\nC(n)/50= 40/50= 1\nC(n)=90\na =5/6 because the customer received less", "answer": "E: children suffer"}

A dog is 10 times more intelligent than a cat.

What is the total number in minutes from the start of the game until the game end?\nOutput: While the game was playing, a foul ball hit a window and broke it for 3 minutes and 45 minute were spent waiting for the window to be fixed.

How old is my grandma?\nOutput: If a dog is 8 times older than you, then the dog is 8*8=64 more years old than you.\nMy grandma has 2 other dogs that are the same age as her. Since she is 8+8+8 years old, so is her 2 dogs.\nThe sum of 8 years is 8 and so are the sums of the 8 years (8*8=6-4=6) that she had her 2 dogs. The only difference between her and her 2 dogs was that she had 8 years of dog lifetimes more than her 2 other dogs.\nTo figure out how old my grandma is, we need to see how many years she was an actual dog. So for each additional 8 years, we can say that my grandma  is another lifetime year as a dog.\nSo, if she was 8 8-life-years old when she got her 3rd dog, then she was around 16, because she was 8+8+16 years old.   If she was 8 16-life-years when she got her 4th dog, then she was 24, which means the first 8 lifetimes of her dogs she was a dog.\nSo she was 24 years old when she got her first dog.\nSo her oldest dog is around 32 years old!\nSo the final answer to the question is 32", "answer": "E: university"}

If the average life of a car is 9.2 years, what is the best mileage for gas mileage to save the most money?\nOutput: To save the most money on gas, you will need a car with a gas mileage of 29.4 mpg.  This is the best fuel efficiency because 0.03366 times 29.4 is equal to 0.92\nThis means that you will pay 0.92x (cost of gas per mile) (total in miles) in the 9.2 years.\nIf you have a new car with a 29.4 MPG, you will pay\n(0.92)(cost of gas per mile)(total miles driven)\nin the 9.2.\n\nFor instance, if the car traveled 600,000 miles, the cost would be 0.92 times (0.05)(600000) = $3,180\n\nSo 29.4 x 60000 = $1,849,600 (600,012.25 miles driven) at 10 cents per mile, will cost $18,496 by the time your car reaches 600,123.25 miles.

In how many possible ways can the remaining spots be filled? Choices:  C: 236 384 432 576 A: 96 B: 19 2 1 D: 108000000\nOutput: There are 6^4 = <<6^4=100>>10,000,000 spots in a 4x4 rectangle. So the answer depends on which square has to 6^4 spots. We divide into groups of 3. Group A has 3 spots in a row. Group B has four spots but the row has to be filled in before the column. Group C has six spots in a column and there are two possible choices for Group D.\nSo the answer would be A+B+C+D = <<A+B+C+d=6+4+6+2>>10\nSo the answer is 6 + 4 + 10 +2 = <<6+4+10+2=22>>22 spots\nSo the final answer would 22\n\nInput: How did John do at the math test?

If she buys 6 apples, her total cost is $3 + 2 cents tax. How much tax does Dusty pay when she buys 1 apple?\nOutput:  Since Dusty pays 2 cents tax on every apple past the 6th apple, she will pay 2 cents tax for 5 total apples and 2 cents tax plus the cost of the 6th apple would be the cost for her 6th apple. Here we need to calculate what the 6th apple is and the 5th apple is and what the tax would be on those individual apples.\nThe 6th apple equals $0.50+0.02\nThe 5th apple equals $0 + (0.02 + 0.50)\nThe 4th apple equals $0+($0.045)\nThe 3rd apple equals $0+ ($0.0905)\nThe 2nd apple equals $0+ (0.1365)\nThe 1st apple equals $0+0.183\n\nIf you calculate those out you get\n$0.633, $0.783, $1.033, $1.283, $13.3\nSo, your 6th apple is going to cost (0.50+ 0.02)\nThe 5th apples cost is going to be (0.02+ 0.50 which you pay the tax, on, the 4th apple as well)\nThe 4's apple cost is (0.02+$0.50)+0.02\nFor the 3rd apple (0.02*$0.50)+(0.02+$ 0.50)+ 0.02", "answer": "C: architect"}

After 33 seconds it was going at 2 mph. When will it be going at 5 mph?\nOutput: The first sentence says 33 seconds so it means that from the first time it could possibly run it took 33 seconds before it gained or ran it's first mile(1 mile per 1 hour) so from the first second it was at 0(the value you start with is most likely 0) and after 1 mile it's speed is 1.\nAfter it gained its first mile now the speed is 1 because it ran 1 mile and it needs more time to get to 5 mph, So the speed will be at 1x the time it took to pass its first mile. So from 33 seconds it ran a mile so it needs 33x1= 33miles to get to a 5 mph\nSo the speed of the car after 33 seconds was running at 0(since that is the time you use for everything so it must be 0) the next number is 1(since that is how fast it can run now) now since it runs 5 miles in a minute the next time for the car is going to be 2 minutes.\nFor the second answer to be 2 it needs to be 33*2=66, so the car is going 2 when it gets to running from 33 to 2 minutes\nIn total the car would run for 66m minutes before it gets to 5 mph\n\nInput: How can we find the height of an object without using a meter stick?\nOutput: You need to measure something other than an object in height.

{"idx": 991, "text": "A: eyes.  The fungus in question is a cheese rind (i.e. an extra bit of cheese made from the curds while making cheese).  The rind is simply the bit of cheese that happens to be left over when the rest of the cheese is sacked and sold.  It was traditionally considered waste as mice would often eat at the edge of the cheese wedge.  But farmers learned from watching mice to take advantage of the mold, which helps the cheese dry out faster overnight.  This cheese rind usually sits in the open air without refrigeration which allows it to dry out and then mold.  There are so many strains of cheese rind growing fungus that a 19th century Russian chemist (who also happens to have given his surname to a genus of fungi associated with blue cheeses such as Roquefort) described these fungi as constituting \"a race of organisms\" of their own!", "answer": "D: old cheese"}

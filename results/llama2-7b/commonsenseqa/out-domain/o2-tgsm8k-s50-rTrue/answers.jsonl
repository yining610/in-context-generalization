{"text": "We're gonna assume that you want to know where a bald eagle can be safely observed without being in danger.\nIf they chose A (pine tree), the answer is NO. A bald eagle must be in the open for it to be able to survive, so it cannot be safe in a pine tree.\nIf they chose B (open country) the answer is NO. In order to observe a bald eagle in the wild it must be in the open country. That's how you can go out in a field or in the middle of a desert and not miss the eagle.\nIf they chose C (washington), the answer is NO/MIGHT because the bald eagle is not endemic to Washington, which means it doesn't live in the state. Now, if you can get the eagle to fly to washington from somewhere else that's fine, but this is a pretty hard task to accomplish to begin with. It's better to ask WHERE can you go to observe a bald eagles, and then narrow it down to the state of washington.\nIf they choose D (wildlife refuge), the answer is YES. It is a safe environment, because there are wildlife services to make sure that the eagles there stay safe. It's a government run, and there are many ways for people to see the bald eagles in a wildlife refuge.\nIf they choose E (sky), the answer is NO because the bald eagle cannot make it in the air, it's wings are not designed to stay in the air for long periods of time, and it cannot go up by itself to make it to the skies.\nSo if you want to observe a bald eage without being in danger the the best answer is D (wildlife refuges).

Hence, 23 inches is the right answer\n\n**This answer is from 3rd version**\n\nInput: The perimeter of the garden and its width is given to be 54 inches and the length is the same. So the length is < 24 inch. We need to find an inch which is less than 24 inches\nFor that we have 54- 24 = x. We know that x < 24. So x is a value less than 24. This means 0,1, 2, 3 and 4 are the values less than 24 and we can consider them as candidates for our answer so that we can find the length\nSo we have to find for those values that the perimeter must be the same. So the perimeter = 2(54/3)\n\nSo we can see that for all the values of length, when the values of lengths are more than 8 inch, the perimeter is not same any more. Hence the length has to be < 8 in.\n\nHence we can consider options 4 and 0. So the final answer is 4\n\nInput: The probability that a light bulb will break within 2 years is 0.12.

They therefore grow best in dark places since no sunlight can reach them there. Fungi grow on all kinds of organic matter including wood and rotting vegetation. They also grow on rocks that provide a porous surface on which spores can grow. Since fungi grow anywhere dead matter is available, fungi do not grow in bright areas since they die if exposed to sunlight and cannot grow if they do not have their food. They may grow in the grocery store when something has rotted but no fungus lives off of rotting food to gain survival.

In the next step you do that again for the new X. The original solution of the problem was very time-consuming, because they created a new list (new N), but it was easy to show in an interview, that they can find the median (X) in O(N) time.\n\nA better solution using O(N log N) time would be to keep two queues:\n     A queue for numbers to take out, and a queue for numbers to put back.\n     The first number we take, we put it in the first queue, and the last numbers we put in the second queue.\n     The second step is: to take the first element in each queue and replace them with the min element in the first queue and the max element in the second queue (using O(N/2) time). Then repeat that step until we want to stop.\nOutput:17\n\nInput: The length of the queue is not limited, but you cannot add more than 1 element to the queue in each step, so the maximum allowed value of N is 2^32 + 1.\nOutput: 335165\n\nInput: Write a function that, given a string S, checks if it includes all the letters of S as its substrings.\nInput: a: a1aa", "answer": "B: singing"}

How much does the more expensive house cost per square foot?\nOutput: The input states that two houses are selling for 1.5 million an 1.6 million, but what was left out were how much the houses sold for in square feet. So, the cheaper house should be $1.6 because its.5, and $2.0 is.4, but then the last digit is greater so the final answer is 2. Since the house is 67 square feet, $1.6 million=1.6\u00d73x1.28, and the other house is also 3\u00d71.5, so its $4.5, since half of $9 million is $4.5.\n\nInput: If \"13\" is the reverse of \"mushroom\", then what is the reverse of \"car\"?

{"text": "Stopping being married to one other was a costly task! the lawyers and what were astronomical!\n\n### Solution:\nThe answer to the first question was *40 years*. The second answer was *12 books*.  and the third answer was \n*A,B,D, and E*.  Here I explain why the answer is D.\n\n## 40 years old.\nThe first rule of solving math problems is to first read the question and then determine what they are asking. So the question is asking you how many years Richard will be *40 years from now*. Then I figured out how to solve the problem by making it into 2 equations (if x years = 40 then 40 + x = 40 + 20). My initial equation was:\n\n40 + <age of hurley> = 60\n\nThen I thought, *What am I actually trying to figure out?!*. The answer is 40 years from *now*. So I said if 40 + <age > = 60 then the difference in ages is 20. So my new equation is:\n\n40 = <age> -20\n\nNow let's think about the age of Hurley in the years it was 40 years from (now). Hurley has to be 14 years old to start so subtract 14 from the the equation:\n\n14 = <age> - 20\n\n<age> - <age> -24\n\n0 = (-20) -24\n\n24 = 20 + 24\n\nIn that equation there is 24 but I already said that that is how many +20 is. So there is nothing to subtract away from anything. So since the question asked that 40 years from Hurley will be 60 which means he will be 14 years from now.\n\n## 12 books. So the question asks about how Pablo read the book. Now Pablo read 150 so he checked out the books. To read the book he has to see *150* pages so he has to be on a *150* page, now when he reads the book he will have to be *150* + 1.  That is *150*+1 = 1", "answer": "D: legal fees"}

Choices:  (D) A: 4 B: 8 C: none of those D: 16 E: 32\nOutput: 16 and 32 because 16 x 4 = 64 and 32 x 4 = 128 and only 16 and 64 are divisible by 4\nSo the final answer has to be 16 or 32\n\nInput: 3 + 123 = 129.

How many digits can be formed if the letter \u2018m\u2019 is restricted to be used as the first two digits of the number, and the letter \u2018a\u2019 is restricted to be the third digit?\nIn order to answer the question, we first must find out the total amount of numbers, meaning we need to find the total amount of the set of all possible numbers. To do so we first use the fact that:\n`numberOf_set_m(9_letter_set) = numberOf_set(9)(numberOf_m)`\nIn our problem above,`9_letter_set = \u2018m\u2019,\u2018t\u2019,\u2019u\u2019,\u2019y\u2019,\u2019z\u2019` and `numberOf_m = 2`, so:\n`numberOf(9) = 9`, since `numberOf_set(7) = 7!!(the base number)(numberOf_set_7_set(7) == 7^2 == 49)`\n`numberOf_m = numberOf_set_m = 2^(2==0) == 1`, and\n`9_letter_sets = \u2018m\u2019, \u2018t\u2019, \u2018u\u2019, \u2018y\u2019, \u2018z\u2019`\nSo total amount of all possible numbers:\n`numberOfNumber`\n\nNow to do this for the letters we need to find out number of digits that each letter can take so we use this:\n`numberOfDigit = (10^numberOf_letter - 1)/ numberOf_letter`\nSince `numberOf_letter = numberOf(digit_number)` and for this task the digit number is defined as being restricted to only use the letters `m`, `a`, `m+1` or `m+2` (where m can be any of the 9 letters, which are excluded from the `numberOf`, we can say that:\n`numberofdigits = 2^(3 == 8)`\n\nSo now we can use the numbers to do the following question:\n`question = 2^(5 == 32)`\nBecause `question == a`, then:\n`a^question = 2^2^(question)`\nSolving that for `question` we get:\n`answer = 32*(2^(5-2)+1)/2^(5-", "answer": "C: remarkable"}

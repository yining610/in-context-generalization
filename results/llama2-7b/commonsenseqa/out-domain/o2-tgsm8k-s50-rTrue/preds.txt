The bucket has 20 gallons of water, while each frog can cover the area of 12 gallons of water. Then multiply by 8 frogs. 160 gallons times 8 would be equal to 1280 gallons. In 4 days that would be 1280/4=320, because each day is 80 gallons. Then you must subtract the amount of water in the bucket that they would have come before them. (20 gallons left in bucket after 4 days) Then it is 320-20 = 300 gallons.<n><n>Input: Five years ago, Moby purchased a 2,600 square foot house for $300,000.

Choices:  A: pine tree B: open country C: in washington D: wildlife refuge E: sky<n>Output:		We're gonna assume that you want to know where a bald eagle can be safely observed without being in danger.<n>If they chose A (pine tree), the answer is NO. A bald eagle must be in the open for it to be able to survive, so it cannot be safe in a pine tree.<n>If they chose B (open country) the answer is NO. In order to observe a bald eagle in the wild it must be in the open country. That's how you can go out in a field or in the middle of a desert and not miss the eagle.<n>If they chose C (washington), the answer is NO/MIGHT because the bald eagle is not endemic to Washington, which means it doesn't live in the state. Now, if you can get the eagle to fly to washington from somewhere else that's fine, but this is a pretty hard task to accomplish to begin with. It's better to ask WHERE can you go to observe a bald eagles, and then narrow it down to the state of washington.<n>If they choose D (wildlife refuge), the answer is YES. It is a safe environment, because there are wildlife services to make sure that the eagles there stay safe. It's a government run, and there are many ways for people to see the bald eagles in a wildlife refuge.<n>If they choose E (sky), the answer is NO because the bald eagle cannot make it in the air, it's wings are not designed to stay in the air for long periods of time, and it cannot go up by itself to make it to the skies.<n>So if you want to observe a bald eage without being in danger the the best answer is D (wildlife refuges). We can't say "Yes" because there are many wildlife refuges that are not safe for bald eagles and many other birds.<n><n>Input: Is Tuesday (09/18/2018) on a weekend?

Hence, 23 inches is the right answer<n><n>**This answer is from 3rd version**<n><n>Input: The perimeter of the garden and its width is given to be 54 inches and the length is the same. So the length is < 24 inch. We need to find an inch which is less than 24 inches<n>For that we have 54- 24 = x. We know that x < 24. So x is a value less than 24. This means 0,1, 2, 3 and 4 are the values less than 24 and we can consider them as candidates for our answer so that we can find the length<n>So we have to find for those values that the perimeter must be the same. So the perimeter = 2(54/3)<n><n>So we can see that for all the values of length, when the values of lengths are more than 8 inch, the perimeter is not same any more. Hence the length has to be < 8 in.<n><n>Hence we can consider options 4 and 0. So the final answer is 4<n><n>Input: The probability that a light bulb will break within 2 years is 0.12.

Choices:  A: under rocks B: manhattan C: toenails D: grocery store E: fallen tree<n>Output:		Fungi need no sunlight for growing and reproduction. They reproduce by releasing spores that grow on dead organic matter. They therefore grow best in dark places since no sunlight can reach them there. Fungi grow on all kinds of organic matter including wood and rotting vegetation. They also grow on rocks that provide a porous surface on which spores can grow. Since fungi grow anywhere dead matter is available, fungi do not grow in bright areas since they die if exposed to sunlight and cannot grow if they do not have their food. They may grow in the grocery store when something has rotted but no fungus lives off of rotting food to gain survival. They instead live on dead organic matter in the environment and are distributed by spores, not off of living plants. So the final answer is A<n><n>Input: The largest and most powerful storm to ever exist was the Super Typhoon, which had the highest sustained wind of 190 mph. The storm was so powerful that it lifted a ship into the air, killing all but two of its 986 passengers. The distance to the ship in the air was 1.39 mi. What is the speed of wind needed to lift a ship?<n>Output: The storm had the highest sustained speed of 190 MPH = <<190 MPH=59.33 M/S>>59.33 m/s<n>The distance to the ship air was 1.59 mi = <<1.59 mi=2.57 km>>2.57 km<n>You have to calculate the speed so I chose to take the 59.33 as the acceleration and divide the distance by the time. Therefore, we have to find the time needed to lift a ship.<n>The speed is therefore equal to sqrt(acceleration*distance)/time. We have to solve for v=distance/time<n>The equation is<n><u>59.33M/S</u>*<u>(2.28mi/hr)</u>= (2.57km/M/S*1.39 mi / hr )<u><br></u><n>Therefore, we have<n><u>v=10.4m/s</u><n>So the final answer in m/s is

If you mean kinetic energy, then exercise would do that but not mostly in your muscles. If you mean chemical energy, what you describe is release of energy with an ATP molecule being converted to ADP. That happens in all muscle cells, but probably doesn't make you sore.

And he was told to go for his next interview.<n>On his way back to his home, he found someone's house was broken and a person was lying in it. On enquiry, he came to know that the man was working in one of the company in the same building and this was his home.<n><n>Why the man came to the same building for job, but not the apartment building owner came to the former's home? Output: First of all, since the job is from the local company, then surely the job is inside the building where there were many apartments.Secondly, the apartment owner may not have any office like that, to give job. Thirdly, if anyone from that apartment is working in the company of that local company, he can't leave his job and join in that local company.<n>So the final an answer is First of all, since there was only 1 company, it has only 1 office. Secondly, the apartment company had nothing to do with the local job. And 3 and the most important reason is, he can't change the job and remain

Which is more expensive: buying the $2 shirt and the $5 shirt or buying one shirt for $7?<n>Output:  If I have to buy 1 or 2 $5 shirts with $2 shirts, then I have to buy at least one $5 shirt because 2 x $2 = <$2 x 2=$4>>4. Therefore, I can’t buy just one shirt for $4, so I’ll need to get a $2 shirt if they are cheaper than I bought a $5 shirt because I will need at least one of shirts. $5 + $2 =<5+2=$7>>7<n>If I had to buy one or two $5 and I’ll need one $2 shirt, then I’ll get two $5 shirting. $5 * 2 = <$5 x 2= 10>>10.<n>And I’ll need one of shirts for $2. $5 or $2 =<5 or 2=$7>>7 so it doesn’t matter.<n>If I had to spend at least $16, then I only have two options. Buy the $2 shirt or spend the same money.<n>But if I spend the same money then I will get one $5 shirt and one $2 shirt. And if I buy both $5 shirt because that is cheaper then I will not need to buy just one $2 shirt (since I will be buying one shirt).<n>

If she had to buy many supplies, the prices would be higher.  A deli is a place where kosher meat and poultry are prepared then served. Kosher food means it is prepared according to Jewish Laws.<n><n>Jewish Community: Jewish people would come to have a delicious meal.  However, they were many people.  So they would have to go inside, buy what they wanted, wait in long lines to pay, and they would go back and eat.  People who went would have to wait.  She was located in a poor area, so she needed all the money she could make.<n><n>Jerusalem:  Lilly has many people come to her delicatessen.  They always have good food there.

In the next step you do that again for the new X.

The length of sides of a rectangle are the width, w, and the height, h. What is the area, A of that rectangle?<n>Output: To calculate the area of the rectangle, one can multiply the length of the side and the width of the side.  So the area is the product of the length and the width of the rectangle. For example, two such rectangles are 3in. x 5in. and 4in x 6in. <n><n>The area of these two is 3(in2) x 4(in2) = 3x4 = 12in2 and 3in2 x 5in2 =9in2 <n><n>Hence the formula for the area of rectangle is length x width. <n><n><n>

If there are more options, the number of options determines if one is happy. For example, if there are three options, then all three have to be happy for the question to be answered correctly. If there are four options, then all four have to be happy and similarly for the remaining combinations. When there are five options (A:joke, B:laughter, C:golf, D:fight, E:frightened) or more, it is possible that the question will never be answered correctly (since happiness is a value in [0,1] or (-1, 1) that cannot be negative).

Choices:  A: free time B: pleasure C: get divorced D: legal fees E: being lonely<n>Output:		Stopping being married to one other was a costly task! the lawyers and what were astronomical!<n><n>### Solution:<n>The answer to the first question was *40 years*. The second answer was *12 books*.  and the third answer was <n>*A,B,D, and E*.  Here I explain why the answer is D.<n><n>## 40 years old.<n>The first rule of solving math problems is to first read the question and then determine what they are asking. So the question is asking you how many years Richard will be *40 years from now*. Then I figured out how to solve the problem by making it into 2 equations (if x years = 40 then 40 + x = 40 + 20). My initial equation was:<n><n>40 + <age of hurley> = 60<n><n>Then I thought, *What am I actually trying to figure out?!*. The answer is 40 years from *now*. So I said if 40 + <age > = 60 then the difference in ages is 20. So my new equation is:<n><n>40 = <age> -20<n><n>Now let's think about the age of Hurley in the years it was 40 years from (now). Hurley has to be 14 years old to start so subtract 14 from the the equation:<n><n>14 = <age> - 20<n><n><age> - <age> -24<n><n>0 = (-20) -24<n><n>24 = 20 + 24<n><n>In that equation there is 24 but I already said that that is how many +20 is. So there is nothing to subtract away from anything. So since the question asked that 40 years from Hurley will be 60 which means he will be 14 years from now.<n><n>## 12 books. So the question asks about how Pablo read the book. Now Pablo read 150 so he checked out the books. To read the book he has to see *150* pages so he has to be on a *150* page, now when he reads the book he will have to be *150* + 1.  That is *150*+1 = 1

You feel that you have been well-compensated for your efforts and have been lucky enough to know most of the customers and most of the staff in the bookstore. Unfortunately, as the owner and chief executive officer (CEO), you have to make tough decisions to keep the business as profitable as possible for the many shareholders.<n>You have many options, but you've decided that you need to increase employee compensation. Since you plan to hire only one new employee, you could do things like hiring another employee and just give them the same pay as the other employee. You can also raise the pay of the current employees above average and raise everyone's pay the same percentage amount to keep things fair across the board and to avoid unfair discrimination. Or, you can just raise the pay of everyone who has been there longer than two years because you feel those employees are more valuable than the new hires. Of course, you have several other options and you want to make sure that you make a good decision that is fair and will have a positive effect on the business that will outweigh the cost of paying out those extra wages.<n><n>### Instruction 1 : You may need to read 1 or more documentations about the concepts on this assignment.

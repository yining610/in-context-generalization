To determine the greater of two decimals, remember to follow the following steps:<n><n>1) Write each number in the order in which you want it—so, for example, the first digit of "0.2", which is "2", comes first in the order of the numbers.<n><n>2) Subtract the second decimal place from the third decimal place. If this is a positive number, then the first number is greater; if this number is negative, then the second number is greater. The second part of this will be "number one" and "number two".<n><n>3) Subtract the third decimal place from the fourth decimal place. Continue doing this until you get to the last decimal place, which is going to be either the first number or the second number, depending on which was greater in the previous step. If the last decimal places of the two numbers are the same, then the numbers are equal. If the last decimal place of one number is one greater than that of the other number, the first number is greater.<n><n>4) Write down the sum of the two numbers and move the decimal point two places to the left. If the number after doing so is greater than the number before doing so, then the resulting number is greater than the previous one; if the number after doing so becomes less than the number before doing it, the previous one—the one before the two-step—is the greater of the two.<n><n>#### 34<n>Answer: 36<n><n>### Input : Which pair of numbers is the greatest? 3.13 3.87 3.51 2.65<n><n>### Response<n>The most significant digits in each number are the ones that go in front of the decimal point.

In order to convert a date to a month, you have to take the number of days for that given month. There are 31 days in January. The number of days for April is 30, and the number of days for February is 28. Using the birth date you input in the field, we are converting to a month and then subtracting a factor for year, in order to get the month. Using this method, you subtract the year, then the month, then the day. For example, if you want the year for a birth date, you would take the date and subtract the year; then convert the leftover numbers to a birth month. If you entered a birth date of Novemver 2, 2005, you would take November, subtract May, and the digits left over would be a 13. 912 is three months and three years. The digit 2 in November is two months plus two years. Using this method, the digits we end up with are 8011.<n>The final step is that we will flip the digits. This is because, we have numbers in front. 8,0,1, and 1, so to find our month, we need to flip the second and fourth digit. These flipped digits are 1,8,0, and 1, this shows us the month of 08. We have to add 08 to the

Choices:  A: compliments B: passing grade C: intellectual challenge D: sticker E: avoid pain<n><n>### Response:		<n>Filling in the correct answer is important in a situation that has a direct impact on a person’s quality of life. It’s important to understand the questioner’s request: In order to be successful in school, a person must have many qualities that contribute to successful learning. First, they must have a positive attitude to the entire process of learning. To have a positive attitude they should expect a fair amount of challenges, but also expect to learn new things, and enjoy these experiences. Next, they should have confidence in themselves. When they are feeling underconfident, they can make sure they don’t underestimate themselves, or they can ask for help. Finally, they must be passionate about at least some subject matters. When they don’t have passion for school, they need a way to get out of the rut of feeling apathetic. They need to think about the value of learning in school.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>I believe that an appropriate response to my requester would be an explanation. An explanation is a description of what you did in the past, as well as your reasons for doing it. It is a chance for the one being asked the question to give the interrogator information about their past actions, but also why they did it the way they did.<n><n>A way to answer a question that gives you a list of things that are desirable is to say which things they do have. A list shows that the questioner is already on the right track, but if they have done all of these things, they should be in the right mindset to complete the task they asked for. It is a good way to support the requester without having to say more or less. A response that contains less is not a valid response, because although it may be true, it is giving a lack of support for the request. A response that contains more is an over-response. It contains unnecessary information, and gives the requester many things to think about. This sort of response is good to avoid, but if you have little details you want to share, you can still be concise.<n><n>### Improvement:<n>A way to improve my response is to include less details for an over-response. Giving the interrogator more than they need is a difficult task, especially with a limited amount of time. If you include too many details without understanding the requester, you will be giving them more information than they

An example of how food is made to last on the space shuttles is by making it very dry and freeze dried. If it were not freeze dried, it would mold. If you are taking it to a friend's house, you would not want it to have mold on it. Another example would be that if you freeze dried it then it could not grow mold. Choice C or answer (b) does not make sense for the space shuttle because that would mean putting it inside the space shuttle to dry, but since it is dry it would be hard to fit in the space shuttle (too bulky). Choice D or answer (b) could not be right because since it is freeze dried, you would use the oven to heat it back up. Choice E or answer (d) could not be right either because a microwave cooks the dish and since it is no longer wet, it would be inedible.<n><n>### Input::In what country is the highest and longest railroad in the world found?<n>A: Australia B: Russia C: England D: Scotland<n><n>### Response::In what country is a the highest and longest rail road found?

The hairbrush must not be bought as medicine for some illness related disease:<n><n>#### B: Hospital<n>Hairbrushes are not bought as a medicine in a hospital. If you are sick and your hairbrush breaks, you buy a new one online or in a drugstore. Hairbrushes are bought in drugstores and as medication in hospitals or in specialized stores. Hairbrush for sick people are bought in specialized stores and the medication is not directly given in a hospital to the patient – but to the doctor (or nurse) who then gives it to a patient. A normal person do not go to the hospital nor do a specialized stores to buy a hairbrush.<n><n>Hairbrush in a hospital for normal people: In a hospital a normal person will get a new hairbrush only if your normal hairbrush stops functioning. If you have a hairbrush that can’t function or is broken, you can not buy a new hairbrush in the hospital. You will get a new brush either if it is provided by the hospital as a part of your medicine. This is not usual for normal hairbrushes. You can also bring your own hairbrush to the hospital – as long it fits within security policy, e.g. that no sharp objects are brought to the hospital. But a hairbrush is not considered a sharp object – in general. You can also buy your own hairbrush in the specialized online stores; then you are allowed to bring it to the hospital.<n>Hairbrush for sick patients: A hairbrush not for normal people is bought in the hospital at the ward or at the discharge room – if you’re going home early. The patient do not buy it him- or herself.

That is why the toilet is near the shower. If there are people who don’t feel comfortable being near the toilet, they get a urinary incontinence. So if a human wants to be close to a toilet, they would go to the bathroom.<n>The solar system is a group of planets and stars in outer space. The solar system has the sun at the center and the planets that revolve around the sun are called the solar system. If a human wants to be near their solar system, they will go to outer space. A place near the sun is called the space shuttle. This is also related to outer space, so going to a space shuttle is the best choice.<n>The main reason why humans want to sit in a coffee shop is because they love coffee. If they want to get coffee or get cold water, they go to a coffee shop. They are also not too far from the bathroom.<n><n>### Input (continued from the original answer):  A: bathroom<n>B: solar system<n>C: coffee shop<n>D: space shuttle<n>E: airport<n>

We can also consider the distance that we are taking to access it, by that, it is a distance that is taken to get to some place.<n>To answer it:<n>1. We are near a road where people stand on a line, now we are considering whether there is a distance that separates us from that line, if not, then the line must be near water fountain, military base, apartment, fire house or bus stop.<n>2. We have eliminated A: water fountains, B: military base, C: apartment, D: fire house, E: bus stop.<n><n>There is no line which is on the road that is near some road because it is away from a path. This is the conclusion of our steps:<n>1. Are we near a road? yes : We are in a car.<n>2. Is there a distance between us and the line? : yes.<n>3. Are there any people near water fountains, military base, aaprtments, fire house, bus stop? : We are at the fire house, so we need to go to a bus stop so that we can continue our journey. <n>```

One example of an animal being taken there is an exotic snake. Because of this, people might decide to take their snake there to be taken care of. <n>Another place where people can take their animals is the outdoor,  but the exotic snakes do not live outdoors, so they are not "driven". <n>Another place that people can take their animals too is a Ditch, but the exotic snake would just be sitting there. <n>Another shop, north america, would just be too risky for the owner of the shop.<n><n>Exotic snakes that are not kept inside of a pet shop and are not driven there.<n><n>### Rules:<n>There are some rules that are needed for this task.<n><n>1.

Stress would not be caused by boredom, but it may cause boredom.  Boredom is defined as the state of being “stuck” in a routine.  Boredom can also be caused by being unable to solve a problem.  That makes you feel “stuck” in the situation.  If your house work is too much for you, you might feel stressed before feeling bored, not after feeling bored.<n><n><n><n><n>

The correct method, when rounding numbers, is to start from the 10 thousandth place.

If this is greater than or equal to 5, add 5. If this is less than 5 subtract 5 and continue doing this throughout the entire number. <n><n><n>#### $21,620 to $21,000:<n>Rationalization: To round money to 1000, use the 1000 and do this process:<n>1000-500 = 500<n>If 500 is greater than 5, then continue adding 5, if 500 is less than 5 then continue to subtract 5.

How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:What would a document be if it is not obtuse? Choices:  A: pointed B: bright C: easy D: clear E: acute angled<n><n>### Response:		<n>C: easy<n><n>#### Explanation:<n>Because of their shape, obtuse triangles have the advantage over right triangles in the area where they meet a circle. However, a convex object still has a surface area that can contain more matter than an obtuse object with the same angular volume. For a convex object, the surface area is greater than the angular volume.<n><n>### Input<n>What time would a train leave if the time the train arrives is 12:00?<n><n>### Response<n><n>#### 1:30<n>Because of the nature of time, only a single minute can pass. However, it is a different minute for each event, so you cannot know its exact position beforehand.<n>If you set the arrival time to be 12:02, then I would be looking for a 12:04 departure time.<n>It is not possible to choose a single event to occur at a time between 12:03 and 12:01 or 12:05 in this situation.<n>So, 12:08 would be an option because 12:09 is after 12:07, which is later than the beginning of the beginning.<n>#### 1:26<n>Answer: 1:26.<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>Because there is a total of two minutes to go, there must be a total of two seconds to go.<n><n>Because you know that the train leaves at 12.04, you should know that the train leaves 12.06 at the start of the trip.<n>That is, the train will depart at 12:06 if it leaves at 12:44.<n><n>Because there are only two minutes remaining, the train can leave at any time from 12 to 10.<n><n>### Response to additional prompt<n><n>- The clock will make a noise every day.<n>- Tomorrow, the clock ticks twice, with two o’clock coming after three o’clock.<n><n>#### 1/2 hour before 3:30<n><n>- The train will arrive at 12:10 in the morning.<n>- The train will leave at 4:30 in the afternoon.<n>- Tomorrow is the first day of the month.<n>-

He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:People want to explore space, so what should they use to do it? Choices:  A: public place B: roadblock C: space shuttle D: hoverboard E: supermarket<n><n>### Response:		Supermarket<n><n>### Reasons:<n>A: Public place may cause pollution, roadblock may make traffic jam, space shuttle is expensive, and hoverboard is outdated and dangerous.<n><n>### Input : A supermarket sells 1000 apples every week. It sells 2 for $5 and 4 for $6.50. If apples cost $8.60 what must the maximum number of apples it can sell for $5?<n><n>### Response : The maximum number of apples the supermarket can sell for $5 is 1000.<n><n>Explaination: First, determine the amount for apples costed $8.60.<n>When there are 4 apples for $6.5 and 2 for $5, the amount for apples $8.6 cost is (4 + 2) * $8.60 = <<4+2*8.6=16.8>>16.8 apples.<n><n>Next, determine the apples that the supermarket must sell for $5. For the current situation, there must be 16.8 * 1000 = <<16.8*1000=16800>>16800 apples for $5.<n><n>Because 1000 is greater than 16800, the maximum number of applets the supermarket can sell is 1001.<n><n>### Response<n>>Covering Letter:<n>I just discovered about the amazing internships which the company has to offer.

Choices:  A: age grieving person B: heart attacks C: depression D: hair loss E: headache<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>### Justification:<n>> Grief is classified as a stress because it makes people do unusual things. A grieving person can often seem cold and distant to loved ones (A1). The stress of grief can result in a feeling that the whole world has turned against the person (A2). Feelings of depression, guilt, and anxiety often accompany grief (A3). Often, this is considered an extreme form of stress leading to a condition known as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (A4). Grief also causes extreme physical reactions such as headaches (A5), stomach problems (A1), insomnia (A2), and heart attacks (C).<n><n>>### Answer D is incorrect<n><n>> The effects of stress on a person’s body are extensive. A stressful event affects more than just the psychological or mental state of the affected person. The physical manifestations of this stress are often extreme and can be potentially dangerous (E). Stress can lead to a loss of hair (D), as often shown with a person with severe depression.<n><n>>### Choice C is correct: grief causes stress and stress could lead to physical effects such as heart attacks (C) and/or death (E).<n><n>### Instructions:<n><n>> Write a response to the email.<n><n><n>#### Note:<n><n>> If the instruction specifies a number of options from a list, you have the freedom to answer any option as long as it is from the provided list.

Where might he be? Choices:  A: department store B: school C: garden D: office building E: house<n><n>### Response:		<n>The only choice that is specific enough for the question is Answer C (garden).  Muddy shoes could be outside, but unless Sam has a garden, he is most likely not there.  Because there is not much else to choose from, Answer C is probably the correct answer.<n><n>### Input (Multiple Choice):Another choice would be to say, ‘Himself,’ which is a statement that would be most appropriate when writing a text message to your mom about where you are. Choices: A: at school B: home C: in the garden D: at work E: myself (Himself)<n><n>### Response (Multiple Choice)<n><n>Another choice would be Choice C (in the garden).  This choice is specific enough and answers the question correctly.<n><n>### Explain:The word is “himself.”  If you are using “himself” to refer to a second person, the pronoun would end “-self.”  However, you wouldn't put “-self” on the end of the pronoun if you were using it to refer to the first person or yourself.<n><n>Answer: <n>## Explain:<n>In the instruction, the first part of the question asks a yes/no question.  “Where might he be?” is a yes/no question that implies that he is most likely not where he is meant to be.  After, the last paragraph restates the first question, but in a much simpler way.  By restating the question in simpler terms, it indicates that the correct answer is a statement, “Answer C (garden).”<n><n>## Question:What kind of sentence might be appropriate to text to a friend about your whereabouts?<n><n>## Answer:<n>A full sentence is most appropriate for the question.  A full sentence allows the reader to know who the subject is, what kind of action they are taking, and to whom the action is happening.  Full sentences are the best option for texting.<n><n>## Instruction:Sam and Julio’s school, a boarding school in California, had a special activity after chapel.

Choices:  A: relaxation B: good things in life C: admiration D: own house E: needs money<n><n>### Response:		Choice: A<n><n>### Input & Demonstration: The sum of the factors of 2^3^8^ + 5 + 7 + 10 + 13 = 144 Because 2^3^ and 5 are the factors of 2 and 8, they do not need to be multiplied out. For example 8 (2^3^) = 2^6 10 (5) = 50 7 (10) = 70 20 (4) = 80 Thus, the factors of the given number are 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 14, 16, 32, 36, 72, 80, 96.<n><n>### Response & Rationale: Let's look at how big this number is and the way it's structured.

If the array does not contain the value, return the position –1. An example of the function call would be “checkArray[0, 100]” (since the number one would be found at index zero). The array should be declared beforehand. If the value is not found in the array, you should return a list containing all of the indices where the value is not found.

He became famous due to the rumors spreading around.<n>To sum up, telling the rumor leads to notoriety.<n><n>The response of this task is _notoriety_.<n><n>### **Additional Questions**<n>Input: If you’re not the fastest runner in your group, you’re among the slowest. Which of the following conclusions about your group is false?<n>Choices: A: Most of the members are not average runners.<n>B: The average runner is not the fastest runner. C: None of the members are slow runners.<n>D: The fastest runner is not among the group. E: The group’s average runner is slower than the average runner.<n>Output:<n>Rationales: Fastest runner is the top one because it is the definition of fastest. The top one runner should be slower than average one and the bottom one should be faster than average one. When you run with people, everybody run fast and everybody run slow. Only the slowest and the fastest are different from average runner. So, if the speed of the fastest runners is different from average runner, this means the average runner is one of the members of the group. And then we got _D_.<n>If the top fastness is the same as average runner, it means the fastest runner is not in the group. It means that among the slowest is the second fastest runner. Therefore, among the slowest is also the second fastest runner which means none of the members are slow runner. Because only the second fastest runner is among the slowest. If they are not slow runner then they are among fastest runners. And therefore, all are on the same level.<n>#### 7<n>Answer: None of the members is slow runners<n><n>When you want to solve this problem, remember these four main points.<n><n>1. If you are _among_ the slowest (not _the_ slowest), you must be fast.<n>2. Fastest runner is _the_ slowest runner<n>3. Average runner is not _the_ slowest<n>4. The second fastest runner is _not_ among the slowest.<n><n><n># 영역

I can’t imagine what it must be like for the victim to be attacked by a wild animal. I do have some sympathy for the wild animals being blamed for such attacks because there’s very little they can do to fight back. They are, though, blamed for such attacks, and that’s just sad.<n><n>My parents told me that there is an old adage about wild animals: “a sleeping dog is safe and sound.” I don’t find that to be a particularly appealing saying now or ever. If animals had the ability to sleep for a while, they would. An old joke about “sleeping dogs” is that the dogs who sleep most are mammals, and if an animal can’t sleep, it’s safe to assume that it’s not a dog.<n><n>Whenever the subject of “sleeping dogs” comes up, I’m reminded of an incident some years ago when a family’s dog was killed. The dog died sometime between when the owners went to work and when they came home. The dog was killed not because of a family member or something the dog did while the family was away, but because it stayed home alone after the family had gone to work. There are many good reasons why a dog should be kept indoors and that a dog should never be left alone at home for an excessive amount of time. I think these facts would make excellent topics for a future blog post or perhaps an article in the local paper.<n><n>### Question 1<n><n>Which choice is not a part of the passage?<n><n>#### 0<n>A. Wild animals have no ways to escape their natural instincts.<n><n>#### 0  <n>B. The old adage about animals sleeping is a bit sad.<n><n>####

Choices:  A: bookstore B: house C: race track D: friend's house E: building<n><n>### Response:		A<n>#### A<n><n><n><n>### Instructions:<n>Your answer to each inquiry should be a minimum of 100 words.<n><n>### Topic 1:<n>- The role of variables in computer programming<n>- Explain what a variable is, and how a variable can be used in a program<n>- How is a variable defined?<n>- How are variables declared and assigned?<n>- How is a program able to identify a specific variable?<n>- What are the different data types, and what is their purpose?<n>- Provide an example where each data type would be used<n><n>Answer: A variable is an identifier that takes one or more values that may change. Programmers can use variables to store different values that are useful for a computer program. A variable name is an identifier that a computer program uses to describe where certain values will be stored.<n><n>Example: I have many variables, like my name and my age. These variables are not set to a specific amount in the beginning. They don't go into specific values that I have to set later on. They can change and use different values, and they can change whenever I want them to.<n><n>A computer program can use variables to keep track of different values that may be needed for the program later on. A computer program can set specific values for variables to help it to run better.<n><n>Example: The values in a program may be difficult to keep track of, or they may be repeated over and over again. This is why we create variables to store unique, different variables. We use values in variables so we don't write down the same value over and over for everything. This way, we use fewer lines of code when programming.<n><n>Computers don't know where in memory data goes unless you provide it with a value that specifically indicates where the data should be stored. For example, the "value" of a variable in a program is called its "address", and can be thought of as the address of that value and the specific address and location of stored data in memory.<n><n>Example: When I use a program, I don't know where the data goes, unless I am told what the specific address is. The data is stored somewhere in the memory or in a file on the computer. For example, when I save a picture using my camera, it creates a file on my computer, which is stored in the memory of my computer.<n><n>The most important

The dad answers that the answer depends on what they’re talking about. Hurley’s daughter asks again how many feet are there in 6 and 3/4 inches. The dad responds that there are 1 and 7/8 of a foot. What is Hurley’s daughter thinking as the dad’s explanation?<n><n># Response: I believe that Hurley’s daughter is asking her dad how many inches are in feet. She wants to know if he means 6 inches to her daughter, the way he meant it to her dad.  It depends. She thinks that there are not a lot of differences, but the way the question is worded or asked may be different.<n><n># Rationale: I learned this week that if you are taking multiple measurements that it's important that you are sure you are comparing apples to apples and not oranges and apples. Otherwise, the results are not reliable. Hurley is demonstrating this. Hurley can explain the concept to his kids.

There are 365 days in one entire year. Birthdays occur on the day in which a person was born, not a person's number of days born. For example, if you are born in January, you would be one year old each birthday.  If you are born in July, you would be 3 or 6 years old each birthday, but the same amount of days have passed. This is because you were more than one year old the day you were born.  If you are an adolescent, it is a birthday if you are the age to drink alcohol now, but the same amount months have passed since you were born as the birthdays you celebrated a year ago. For example, if it took you 18 years to go from a child into an adolescent where drinking is permitted to a child, you would not be a year older for the first year, but you would the next. This is because it took more than a year for you to go from a child to an adolescent.  This is true every year and you would have to divide one year by 365 to know when it is a birthday.<n><n>F)<n><n>Rationals: The only ones that fit are E and F.

They decide to choose team captains to divide and distribute the expenses among the group. One man in the group agrees to pay for the gas while one woman agrees to pay for meals. The other woman agrees to buy the snacks to share and the group’s remaining one man and one woman agree to equally split the remaining costs. The only condition to this is that two people from the same household are not allowed to pay for any expenses together. Who paid for the lodging?<n>Rationales Each person must pay for at least one expense. There are six different people, so one person, on the team, paid for each expense. Three people are female, and three people are male, so the following chart shows who paid for what.<n>The two men who split the lodging paid for lodging because they are the only two males on the trip.<n>The two women who split the lodging also paid for meals because they are the only females on the trip.<n>Three people can equal six and two people can equal 1 so one person, the group’s remaining man, paid for the lodging.<n>No two people shared the same household, so every person paid for at least one expenses.<n><n>#### The hotel<n><n>#### Meals<n><n>#### Snacks for sharing<n><n>#### Gas<n><n>#### Lodging<n><n>#### The meals<n><n>#### The lodging<n><n>#### The remainder<n><n>#### Lodgings<n><n><n><n>The group’s remaining man and the group’s other man agreed to split the remaining expenses equally by paying half, for a total of two per person, and one woman paid for the snacks. There is two people in every household so the gender cannot decide who paid for what. This is because each family is one person and the one person cannot choose who is male or female. For example, if D and E were a married couple, they could pay for the meals, just like how it was done. This problem is the way it is because the man and the woman agreed to pay for the other household’s expenses, instead of paying for every household’s expenses evenly. For example, if the male paid for gas and lodging he

Your employer wants you to write a response for the employee. Your response can include an explanation of your hiring process and an apology.<n><n>#### Hiring Process<n><n>If an employer wants to ensure the best possible employees, many of them are going to look for people who attended school, did better than average on tests (like the GED), and have a great resume. Another thing an employer might want to see is a history of work related accomplishments from an applicant, for example if someone volunteered one time at a soup kitchen, wrote a book, or raised money for a fundraiser, they will all be put on the applicants resume for example:<n>* BA degree from a very good university<n>* GED <n>* Membership in 4 different charities<n>* Work related achievements<n><n>If the employer found someone with great accomplishments who was not yet employed, they would give them a chance and give them a great offer which they most likely would accept.<n><n>#### Other things an employer can look for:<n>The employer can choose to look for a person who might need work, or someone who is not yet employed so they can help them become successful and loyal. The employer can also choose to look for someone who works well with their coworkers, has a history of showing up on time and doing work successfully, or to not have a record of things like theft and bad driving.<n><n>#### Your response: This is how you respond. Give your explanation of your hiring practices. Then apologize to the former employee. Give a reason why you should be given another chance. Explain the situation that you were not hired. Tell the reader why you feel this is important information.<n><n>#### My Response<n>I hire people who have not only attended school but have also done well on tests. For example if someone was recently accepted to Harvard, and also received a 4.0 on their GED, I would be more inclined to hire them due to their high success rate. The candidate also has to have experience, I want to see that they have put in at least 2 years of work experience.<n><n>As a second part to the reasoning, my company has a strict policy against anyone

Choices:  A: rural area B: big city C: suburbs D: ohio E: countryside<n><n>### Response:		I'm going to start off by reading the four possible answers and I'm going to eliminate B. Ohio would be much too small to contain a large village. Countryside, by definition, would not contain a large village. So, that leaves us with ABCD. Now, I'll go about eliminating those options one by one. A: urban areas typically don't contain villages. Suburbs are an area found in many metropolises.<n><n>C: I'm going to have to eliminate C, because I know for sure that there are many villages located throughout the countryside, which would render it a choice.<n><n>B: I know Ohio has a lot in its cities, but big cities have so much activity that it's possible villages might be overlooked in the chaos.<n><n>D: Ohio is more like a countryside than a village. As you'll remember, villages contain smaller areas of activity. I'm going to say that they're not likely to find a village in Ohio. This leaves us with A and E because they're the only two that remain. However, I'm going to choose C as the correct answer because I'm going to explain why it's better than the other possible choices. Suburban areas are defined as regions surrounding a city. As the region grows more compact, villages may start popping up within the city itself. A: I'm going with B as the correct response because Ohio is more countryside than it is urban. It's not a village.<n><n>#### 4<n>Answer: B<n>#### 1<n>Answer: C<n>#### 3<n>Answer: E<n>

As you can see, we start reading the question by breaking the two parts up into “Parsing” them. The first part is the information the task will tell us and what parts of the task we need to work on. The second part is the directions given in the task. The directions let us know what to do so we can “parse” the question properly.<n>Gathering Information and Gathering All of the Information<n>We gather our information by making a list of everything we know or read. In other words, we have to read and re-read the passage to gather all relevant information. In some cases, that means reading and re-reading again before writing any response. That is completely normal because we also have to determine what we do not know. In the case of a question like “What is the fastest way to get from New York to California?”, the key piece of information is “fast”. We would not want to make a decision about this question without determining that “speed” was required.<n><n>Writing<n>Once we know all the information we need we can “write” our response. Keep in mind, our response to any task will always include:<n>- The complete question stated.<n>- Our answer to the question.<n>- Any instructions on how to answer the question<n>Now

You work 8 hours a day, and have to work extra for 110001 days, but have 1 month week endings instead of 7. So your 11001-11101- day weeks =<< 1100x 1 days=107 days>>107 work days. You worked 1 extra day for 3 days.<n>#### 107<n>Answer: 107<n><n>###

Write a reply.<n><n>Based on my knowledge of the history of the United States, I feel like I have good reason for believing that the U.S. is the best country. This country was born as a result of the revolutionary war in 1776. Since then, the U.S. has developed into the greatest country in the world. In 2014, the U.S.’s GDP was $16 trillion. The median U.S. income per person is $36,000. As a result, most Americans can make ends meet and afford their daily necessities such as housing, food, and transportation. Unlike some other western countries such as the UK, there are no huge disparities between the income disparities between the poorest and richest people. The U.S. is one of the richest countries in the world. The U.S’s capitalism promotes innovation and economic growth. As a result, even small companies compete with large multi-national corporations like Apple and Facebook.<n><n>### Output Task:<n>In the document "The U.S. is by far the best country," the author makes a claim that the United States is the best country, based on the following reasons:<n><n>>In 2014 the U.S.’ GDP was $18 trillion.<n>>1.The median US income is $37,000<n>>2.There are no huge disparities in income between poor and rich people [in the US].<n><n>#### Claim: United States is the best [C]?<n>#### Justification:<n>#### 1.

Tennis elbow may occur without overuse.<n><n>#### B) Professional Player:<n>Professional tennis players generally play an average of 5 to 10 hours a day. The 10 hours represents 5 hours of training to improve play, 3 hours of drilling, and 2 hours of matches.<n><n>#### C) Exercise:<n>Tennis has been shown to reduce the risk of cardio vascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and cancer and can reduce the effects of stress.<n><n>#### D) Victory:<n>Whatever your level, tennis can be the perfect workout for you. Tennis is probably the single most effective aerobic sport. A typical hour long game involves 1,400 kcal. You can burn up to 500 calories per hour, just from playing alone.

Choices:  A: cupboard B: countertop C: water D: hardware department E: england<n><n>### Response:		B - counter top.<n><n>### Justification: The term teakettle has been used in the U.S. since at least the early 20th century; it originally referred to metal tea kettles. Now, however, a teakettle can be wood. Here, the term has been used as a synonym for metal pan.<n><n>In modern American and British English, a kettle is a metal teapot for boiling water. In American English, it can also refer in informal usage to an electric kettle. In British English, a kitty refers to an electric kettler, but, more commonly, it can refer simply to a tea kettle.<n><n>### A kettle is a tea kettle that contains a handle (or spout) and a rim to contain the water. It is used to make hot or boiling water. Tea kettles are made to sit on a stove over an open coal fire or over a gas flame.<n><n>For the most part, a kitchen hob kettle is used to make tea, a pot kettle is used for boiling water and a saucepan kettle is used as a saucepan (that kettle in which food is cooked) for sauce.<n><n>### The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition<n>Copyright © 2000 by Houghton Mifflin Company.

Choices:  A: telephone network B: freeway C: company D: wall E: airport<n><n>### Response:		Checking an electrical connection requires looking at the switch board, and since “wall” is not an option for a switch board this is true. False is selected as the answer.<n><n>### Input :  I need a computer program that can tell the difference between 2 pictures of a scene from the perspective of a specific object in the pictures. I need to be able to take a picture from the first perspective and compare it to a 2nd picture from the third perspective. It would be an advantage that the program can show the objects that are on the screen after analysis and provide the coordinates and the area it was in for the 2 objects I would like to analyze. What does the code look like for this?<n><n>### Response :  If you take a picture from the perspective of a point on the scene, the perspective of that point is the line that passes through all the points that are at the same distance from that point.  To make a program that would tell the difference between  different perspectives, you can use the Euler line to calculate the perspective line.<n><n>### Explanation: You can find the Euler line using Euler line calculation using trigonometry.  The line has a negative slope, so to solve the for the length of the line, you can find the equation for a line that is a constant distance away from another line: y - 2 = m·(x+1). Since we know x+1 is our baseline for all of our points - for example, if there is a point at x=1 and a point at x=2, then the Euler line would be the horizontal line through x=1. The Euler line with points having negative X values are called the Euler Spiral.

Choices: <n><n>### Response : None<n><n>### Explantion:<n>Choice f is incorrect because it is incorrect.<n><n>### **Input:**  Choose the oddest mathematical sequence that follows the rules given.<n><n>### Explantion:<n><n>The oddest mathematical progression is given by the last equation in the middle box. It involves the squares of two-digit numbers which is not mentioned in the question. But none of the options are correct options.<n><n>### Answer:<n>The rules given in the question are: "The sequence contains only the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 at this moment." " The sequence begins with 1 and contains only 4." " The oddest progression in this sequence has a 4 in the middle position." " The sequence has no 1s and only 2s and 3s."<n>#### The equation: 100<n>The rule: The oddest progression will have the number 4 in between two digits. 1st equation: 44     2nd equation: 45     3rd equation: 49<n><n>The only equation with 4 in the middle is the 3rd equation: 10 x 10 + 10 x 9 = 100. 100 is the only equation that has a 4 in between 2 digits.<n><n>If we wanted to continue this sequence, we would solve this equation: 101 = 10 x 0 + 100 x 1 = 1<n><n>#### How can we solve it?<n>If we break it down into addition this problem gives us 10 + 0 = 10 x10 because x in addition is 10. We can also write 0 as 10-1 to make 0 x 10 simpler. We add the numbers to get 20. The numbers are 1, 2 and 3. We need 4 as the next number. We subtract 4 from 10 which leaves us with 6. We divide 6 by 3 to get 2 so our next number will be

If these two eggs are healthy enough to develop into a full blastocyst, then procreation could be considered a success. If, however, neither egg or embryo, is able to successfully develop, then procreation would become a failure. If no eggs were successfully fertilized, then there is even the potential for failure, and procreation would be considered a failure in its own right.<n><n>### Input : Which of the following examples is an example of compound interest?

In this problem, compound interest is the interest on the amount of money that already has interest, so the interest rate will be greater than the initial interest rate.<n>$$0.05 / 52 = 0.0009375$$<n>The problem gives us a 5-year payment term, 52 weeks per year, and our interest rate is 5/100 = 0.05.<n>$$0.5 / 100 = 5\%$$<n><n>This problem is also compound interest because of the interest paid every payday, which includes the interest on the amount that has interest before.

Choices:  A: hall B: motel C: hotels D: law firm E: office building<n><n>### Response:		<n>> In this scenario, the options for a meeting location may include different kinds of meeting spaces such as hotel rooms, reception areas, motels, and office buildings. The context of the meeting would dictate the appropriate location that fits the purpose or nature of the meeting. For example, you cannot have a meeting in a hotel room you do not have a key for, as in "I left my key to the motel room at home." You can go to a reception area at a hotel or office building, though. Another example is that if you had plans to have a meeting with someone at a law firm, you would probably not be able to do the meeting at a motel. All of these location options would be considered, based on a person's ability to attend the meeting, and the purpose of the meeting that prompted the initial invite to attend.<n><n>### Input (cont.):: Which number does not belong in the series?<n>8,12,145,3,4,34,8,158,?

You do not want to take it with you or keep it somewhere where you will lose it. The accountant isn't anywhere near your account book so don't put it there if you don't want to keep track.

What percentage of wild cats die their first year?\nOutput: The average life span is 2 years and the average number of offspring is 2. Therefore, the average life span is equivalent to the average number of offsprings. In other words, the average life span of wildcats is about two years.\nThe percentage of wild cats that die within 2 years is calculated as follows:\nNumber of Wild cats that died in the first year / Total population of wild cats\n\nThe number of wild cats that died in their first year is the number of deaths in the first year divided by 2. This is because there are 2 offsprings born in a year and each offspring has a 50-50 chance of survival each year.\nNumber of wild cats that survived their first year / Total population\n\nThe number of offsprings that survived the first year is the number survived divided by 2 because each offspring survived with a 50- 50% chance.\n\nPercentage of wild cats that will survive their first year / Number of wild cats that did survive their first year\n\nThe number of deceased wild cats is divided by the number of surviving wild cats to get the percentage of surviving wild catoes.\n\nThe percent of wild cats that do survive after their first year is the percentage divided by 100.

How much did he/she pay for the total?\nOutput: From there, we look to find the cost of the bananas. This is easy because bananas have a set price. To find the cost of the potatoes, we simply have to subtract $3.30, which is how $35 is written in decimal format. This is because 350 / 10 = <<350/10=35>>3.5 cents, which is rounded to $3.30. After which, we subtract the cost of the potato and onions and we get the amount of money saved.\nIn this case, he/she purchases 23 pounds. For this person, the total cost is:\nbananas = $<<35=0>>0 cents\npotato = -$0.70\nonions = -$0.45\ntotal cost = (<<-$0.70=-2.7>>2.7) + (<<-$0.45=-3.2>>3.2) = $3.95\nSo the final answer to this question is $3.95.\n\nInput: A train departs from the Chicago Station and goes to the New York Station.

We can't know based on the group only which ones are boys and which are girls unless we know their identities, and that's the purpose of the question. To determine what percentage of those students are girls without knowing their identity, we take the fraction of girls in a group of n and multiply it by 4/n. So if there are 6, one girl in 6 is also equal to 1/6. Likewise, with 7, when there are 7 boys and one girl, 1/7 is still 1/7. Therefore, when we have a group of n and at least 4 of the students are girls, 4/n*1/n = 1/4. Therefore, the probability is 4/n = <<4/6=2/3>>2/3.\n\nInput: You're walking down the street when you pass by a bar, a coffee shop and a bookstore \nYou enter the bar to have a beer and you are charged $10.

{"idx": 263, "text": "The correct answer is E \u2013the surface of earth.\nWe know from the scientific law of diffusion that we do not breathe into our lungs unless we are under air pressure, and if that air pressure is significantly higher than the pressure inside the lungs, then the lungs will expand until the new pressure is equal.\nIn our world, air pressure is approximately 1 atmosphere inside the earth, and approximately 1.11 atmospheres above the earth.\nAs we breathe inward in our lungs, the air pressure expands our lungs to their maximum area (the pressure from the environment is 1.11 atmosphere). However, our lungs, at sea level, are filled with only approximately 4 liters of air at each inhale, and if the pressure inside the litter is less than the pressure outside the lung (as it is), the air pressure outside the lung will make the lungs contract, and the vacant space inside the lung will create another pressure that will cause the lungs to further contract. As the lungs contract, the pressure inside the litorrals goes below zero. At sea level, the negative pressure inside the lungs is approximately -0.003 atmospheres, which is much less than 1 atmosphere.\nTherefore, air on the surface of earth would be the only place where you would not be breathing air that has been breached by others recently.\nSo the final answe is surface of earth", "answer": "B: house"}

(Rounded to only one decimal place)\nOutput:  You can buy the broken bicycle for 40 dollars (10 dollars for the tire itself + 9.5 dollars for replacing) so it is $40+(10+9.5) = $<<40+10+9.6=59.6>>59.6 dollars at a minimum.\nThe bicycle can be ridden on the last tire for: 80 - 59.6 = <<80-59.6=20.4>>20.4.\nSo, it could be ridden for 20,400 miles.\nSo the final Answer is 20,4.\n\nInput:  How many gallons of gas does it take to fill a 13-gallon gas tank?

There are 6-2 = 4 possible combinations of choosing 1 person, so the combination of choosing 0, 3, or 5 people is <<6-2=4>>4 of the possible combinations. We then sum the numbers above to get <<2C2+3C2+4C2+6C2-2C1+4C1+4C2=30>>30 ways of arranging the committee.\nSo the final awnser is 30\n\nInput: How many different 3-digit even numbers are there if exactly one of the 3 digits is 5 and exactly one of the 2 remaining digits is 6?\nOutput: The numbers can be arranged in 3 choices of the 0 in the tens place. We can also have 2 choices for the 0 or 2 in the units place. For each digit, there are 2 choices for it to be 5 or 6. Finally, the digit cannot be less than 1 and greater than 3, so we have a total of 27 choices. For each choice, we alternate choices to give a total of 64 ways. We are choosing exactly one as 1 digit and exactly one as the other. So, 1 digit cannot be chosen as one of the remaining two digits, and the other two digits cannot each be chosen as one of these digits", "answer": "E: falling down"}

But there is only one friend in the gang to whom the others are not friends. A is a friend to B and F. C is a friend to E, though she is not a friend to F. D is not a friend to C, E or F. What is the letter of the friend who is not friends with everyone else?\nOutput: There may be many possible answers, so I'll show how the math part works: We must find the total number of possible friends. There needs to be 1, 2,... 7 letters, and there are 5 friends.\nThere needs to be 1 friend who does not sit down next to his/her own letter.\nWhen we count total letters (A to F), there is always a seat next to a letter: there are 7 letters, plus 2 (the unoccupied seat).\nSo there are 7 letters in all. Now we can use the rules of probability:\n\nFor example, if there is 1 letter in the alphabet, then there are 6 chances against her sitting near her own letter.\nIf there are 7 letters (the entire alphabet), then the probability that she is not sitting next to her own letter is 6/7.\nTherefore, probability that she is not friends with her letter is 6/X where x = 7.\nBut we must double it because she is friends with her letter 5 out of 7.\nTherefore the probability that the letter not friends with her letter should be 6/7\n\nTo get a percentile for the answer, multiply that by 100%: Let's say that the 6/7 probability is 10:\n\nSo that is 2/7, which is 28.57%. There is a 28.5% chance she will be friends with her letter.\nSince there are 5 friends, it's possible that it can be any of the letters, and so we will multiply the probability above by 5: 28.5%. 28.5 %*5= 1.43%.

Answer choices are: A: Nuclear power plant, B: Center, C: Basement, D: Main office, E: Bowel of the ship\n Output: The answer is (E) Bowel of the ship; this can be read with \"bowel\", as it is a reference for the basement, which works as the control middle for the ship.\n The Master says in the series 2 episode \u201cTo Catch a Saxon\u201d that the Tarmadon will be powered by time \u201cand just a little electric power\u201d.\n And in the fourth series episode \u201cThe Deaths of Doctor Lazarus,\u201d the Master states that Tarmadon gets electrocuted as it is attached to Earth's electrical power sources.\n As it turns out, the Tarmadon can only be connected to the electrical energy of her people. When plugged into Earth's energy resources, which she does at regular intervals, the ship loses its propulsion ability. She then has to be removed and recharged with energy from her people. This explains why the Master tries to stop him using those sources of power. He does not want to keep the Tarmadon plugged in for too long, as it would destroy her.\n As the Master has stated that it will also be powered by time, and that it requires a little more electricity to keep running, we can see that it needs enough energy in order to move, so it cannot be connected with a lot of electric energy.\n So the final result is (E)", "answer": "B: center"}

Choices: 1: wealthy residential area 2: downtown 3: suburban area 4: commercial area\nOutput:Houses along the waterfront are often large and expensive. Even though there may be commercial buildings and areas surrounding the water, houses along a waterfront are often a prime area of the city, and will command a much higher price. In many cases, these areas become so in demand that they often change from a commercial area to a residential area, due to the desire of people to live next to the water. Sometimes the cost of such housing is so great that the government is required to provide assistance to people living there, due to the exorbitant cost of living.\nSo the final  answer is 1\n\nInput:Jenny lives in an apartment where her rent is $575 per month.

Cars A cost \\$180 per year, while cars B cost \\$100 per year. The number of years an owner keeps their car is uniformly distributed with a mean of 8 years and a standard deviation of 2 years. We take a random sample of 130 car owners. 21% of the owners drive A, and 11% of the ownes drive B. What is the probability that a random sample of this size will contain at least 13 A's and at least 9 B's?\nOutput:  Let's look at the number of A's first. Our assumption is that A is 21% of all cars.  \nWith all other cars being considered B, we want to find the probability of getting 163 or more B's.  Since the standard deviation is 2, a 90% confidence interval is from \\$95 - 2(3) = \\$85 to \\$105.  Now we just need to multiply by two for all the cars (in a sample of 13) that don't get counted as A, which gives a probability of \\$216 to \\$850.  \nSince B is 11% of all cars, we want to find P(GetAtLeast13AandGetAtLeast9B) = $P(\\frac{190-21(0.11)}{90-2(2)} = \\frac{90 (0.11-2)}{90 - 4} = $ $\\frac90 (0.09) $ = 0.0091 or 9%\nThe final answers is 0.91\n\nInput: One of the four possible types of cheese is produced each week at Farmers Inc.

How many different ways can you put them into containers (which hold 6 marbles each)?\" We know from the problem statement that 3 of those 6 spaces will be filled with marbles of a certain color. If we choose which colors they are, the order does not matter (since we have 6 marbles, so each color gets 1 in each location). So we choose that the first space is blue, the second space is red, and the third space is blue. The remaining spaces can be filled in any order. So, there are 6 x 6 x 6 = 216 different ways to fill the containers.\nSo the final answers are 216\n\n# Input: When you have 4 containers and 50 marbles, how many different ways would you group the marbles into each container? Choices: A: 40 B: 14 C: 12 D: 10 E: 6\nOutput: So we now have: 50 marbles. We know from the problem that we can put 4 marbles in each container, which leaves us 17 marbles unclaimed. Of those 17, 14 have a name (5,10,15,20,25). That leaves us 3 of the unclaimed marbles to place, which we will name 41, 44, 47.

They have 7 free-range chickens that can produce eggs from dawn to dusk every day. However, with the new baby they cannot watch the chickens the same way they did before. For this reason, a hen needs an average of 6 minutes of attention once or twice a day.

When asked about the chickens, the parents told the reporter that the chickens laid an average of 0.5 eggs per day.

A few important rules to keep in mind:\n\n**Expressions are evaluated in order from left to right**.\nFor a problem like `(x + 4) + 13`, the addition expression is evaluated first. So `(x + 4)` is found first (it's `5`) and then plus `13` gives us `18`.\n\n**Multiplication is done before addition**. For `2 * 3 * 4`, first `2 * 3` is evaluated, which gives us 6. Then `* 4` is evaluated to get 24.\n\n**Division is done before both addition and multiplication**. For `5 - 2 / 10 + 17`, first `\\()` is done to get `-1`. This is followed by `3`, so we get `15`.\nBut in `21 * (3 + 7) / (6 - 2)` first `\\()` will be done so you will get 1 and then in `(3 + 7)` `3 + 7` will be done so you get 10 and then you will have `10 / (6 - 5)` which will give you 1 as final answer\n```\nTherefore the answer is 1\n```\n```{markdown}\n\n### Question 3\n\nIf you were playing a board game with 26 cards (7 of each of the 4 cards) and you draw 4 cards.

Nina is the second fastest girl in the country who can run 100 meters in 13 seconds. Mina is the fourth fastest girl in the same school who can run 180 meters in 51 seconds. Nina and Mini are in the same class. How many seconds slower is Mina than Nina?\nOutput: Mina is 1464 seconds slower than Nina. \n\nMina can run x meters faster than Nina every second, where x = 180 \u2013 100 = 80.\n\nSubtracting Nina\u2019s speed of 13 seconds from Mina\u2019s speed of x seconds gives us 13-x.\nThe difference of 13-x can be rewritten as 13+(-x) which is equivalent to 13-(-x). Negative signs are dropped in algebra to simplify expressions. \n\nUsing the substitution of +/-x in the above equation, where x = 80:13-(-80) = 13 - 128 = -9 = 13-(-9)\n\nTherefore, Mina is 13-(-1)s slower than Nina.\n\nThus, Mina is x-1 s = (80-1) s slower than Nina.

{"idx": 565, "text": "This is a true/false question. Answer 'B'.\n\nThe key is to recognize that \"close\" is important here. For example, if someone is \"close to\" a bus station, they mean that they are walking distance from the bus station. However, if someone is \"far from\" a bus station, their commute is too long using public transportation, and they would have to use their car to get to the bus station.\n\nWhen trying to answer a true/false question, examine the context of the question. If the context is one that is commonly misunderstood, there is a good chance that the sentence contains a logical flaw.\n\nIn this question, choose the statement that is \"B\" (is the true or false sentence), and you can decide whether the sentence is true or false by determining whether \"close\" is used correctly. \nLet's explain using the options.

There are sometime called stem cells.  The difference between them and adult stem cells that are not in the embryonic state. In which they divide and grow to become skin, muscle, fat, bone, brain, etc.  \nThe stem cells that grow into an organism's adult cells are called embryonic stem cells because they are found in the embryo. There has been some controversy about research on embryonic stem cells.  There are also controversies about adult stem cell and where they come from. They are obtained from bone marrow or fat cells.  Embryonic stem cells have the greatest potential for scientific and medical use. The best-characterized and most-studies embryonic stem cell lines are developed from human embryos, specifically from human blastocysts. \n\n\n*There are many different types of cells in our body. These cells are called tissues and there are so many different tissues in our body. \n*Adult stem cells come from mature cells. These mature cells can reprogrammed into stem cells which act like cells of the inner embryo. This happens when they regain an ability to proliferate indefinitely and differentiate into many different types of cells. \n*If we transplant these cells with another cell line they can differentiated into those cells. \n*Scientists have also found that stem cells exist in other non-embryonic tissues. They include muscle, fat, neural, and hematopoietic. \n*Sometimes scientists can reprogramming these other cells as well.  A controversial medical procedure uses these reprogrammed cells.  These stem cells can differentiate into many types of tissue, meaning that they can mature into different types of cells.\n*There are some different types of stem cells used in research. But the most important is called embryonic stem cell. \n*Embryonic stem cells can develop into any cell like fat, liver, heart, muscles, skin, blood, and nerves.

If you pick a ball from Bag A without replacing it, and then pick a ball from Bag B without replacing it, you will always pick a different color. What color is the unmatched ball? A. Purple B. Green C. Red D. Blue E. Yellow\nOutput: Bag A holds two red, one green and two purple ball. If you pick a red ball now bag B will hold two red, two purple, and two green balls, it is still two red balls though. Therefore if you pick two different colors in bags A and B, the red ball and the green ball are a match. Since both bags have two red balls. However purple is a match in Bag A but not in Bag B. The purple ball is still in Bag A and Bag B has two different color purple balls. Hence the unmatched ball is purple.

If someone who is wearing sneakers says that their feet sore, what might they say is wrong? Choices:\n1. The sneakers have no air in them 2. The sneakers are worn out 3. The socks are too large 4. The socks are uncomfortable 5. The soles are loose\nOutput: There are definitely five (5) possible reasons why a sneaker may cause a person's feet to be sore.\nThere may be too much or too little air inside the sneaker. Air is important to the foot as it needs to be kept cool, moist, and healthy. Over-inflation of the sneaker will result in a sore foot while under-inflatation will result in a loose-fitting sneaker which will lead to the foot hurting and getting calluses and blisters. The sock can also be too big or too small, not allowing the foot to breathe. The sock can therefore lead to hot foot conditions. Last but not the least, the sole can also be loose and as such, can cause discomfort and sore foot.\nSo the final answers are 2, 3, 4, 5\n\nInput\uff1aTommy is on the fourth floor of a building.

The algorithm for the rubix cube is to start with a single outermost face, which is always in a white state. The algorithm is as follows:\n1. Turn blue and red adjacent faces by moving blue clockwise and red counterclockwise, and return to the white state.\n2. In the next step, start with the red face shown in Figure 1.\n3. Turn all adjacent white and yellow faces blue except for any that contain a blue face.\n4. Return to white state.\n5. Take a step as described in figure 3.3, making sure not to move the face in the direction of the arrow.\n6. Return to white state\nFrom the diagram, the face that had previously taken 7 white steps (in the bottom-left face of cube) would next be in the 3rd white state from the right (as per step 4) and then it gets back to white state from state 2. Thereafter, we proceed in the same way as per steps 4 and 5 (using the diagram).\nFigure 3.2\nFigure 3), the blue arrow points to the place where the state in each white box is one from the previous one.

When a corrosive substance like hydrochloric acid is added to water, it also dissolves many elements as ions, which changes the balance between some chemical reactions that take place in solution, like carbonate chemistry. These changes to the ocean\u2019s chemistry, which has taken millions of years to evolve, are occurring far more rapidly today as a result of the increased amounts of carbon dioxide emitted to the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels.

Since Jerry gives gifts to 3 other people(who are not themselves his family), he also has 3 people left on his gift giving list. So we know that Jerry buys one gift for himself and one gift for every other person(who is not a family member), except for the $14 gift.\nSo Jerry buys a gift for himself for $48 and gifts for three additional people for a total cost of $132. The gift he buys for the cost of $14 must then go to himself since it is not left over $48 to give as a gift to a family member.\nSo the final Answer is 1.\n\nInput:The price of gas this week was $0.25 per gallon less last week.

So the daily pay rate of the second employee should be the second employee's hourly rate, times the number of hours the employee works to average the total daily pay.\nIn other words, let x = the daily pay, and y = average hours worked per day.\nThen the equation for the variable, x, is x = the hourly rate($45,08) of the second employee times the average hours ($1348) worked per day.\nThe equation for finding this average number of hours worked per day is y = 24/1348.\nSo, the final answer is", "answer": "B: look attractive"}

What does Infinite mean? Choices: A: Not as much as infinite B: Exactly a finite amount C: More than you can poke a stick in D: Something that can\u2019t exactly be counted and measured\nOutput: Infinity has many different definitions in different fields, but the most commonly accepted in the context of mathematics is as follows: Infinity can be any quantity which is not finite or \"bounded\" in any way.\nSo the final is B\n\nInput: Which is larger: \u03c0(pi) or pi(pi)? Choices: Pi is larger than \u03c0 because it is closer to the value when we omit the number before the letter. This is because \u03c0 is defined as 3. Pi is defined as the ratio 1/2 of the circumference to the diameter. Pi is closer to 3 because pi is always between pi and 1/2.\nOutput: The word \u201clarge\u201d can be defined as larger. An answer choice that isn\u2019t either 1 or 2 would be greater than 15 if \u03c0 is the ratio of the circumference and the diameter, then \u03c0 is smaller than \u03c0 because \u03c0 is a whole, while 1/2 of a whole is less than a whole 15, regardless of what ratio you want to take \u03c0 and 1/2 of \u03c0 and multiply them by the correct multiplication sign. However, if one divides \u03c0 into two equal parts, it is the ratio \u03c0/\u03c0, or 1/2. Therefore, to say that one pi is larger than another pi is to state that \u03c0 is larger than 1/2 because 1/2 cannot be larger than another pi than pi.\nIn addition, since pi can be used for all mathematical equations involving pi, so using pi in calculations that are equivalent to pi but not including pi is less efficient because one would be rewriting pi on every calculation that was not pi, without pi. \u03c0 is defined", "answer": "B: solar energy"}

We know that, since the numbers involved are integers, they must be whole numbers, so the coordinate of 1 in the horizontal line through 3 must be 4. Then on the vertical line through the coordinates 5 we can add 2, being 1 and 4, the integer coordinates of 1, and we get a straight line through the coordinates 3 and 7. Thus the line must be the one between the coordinates 3 and the 7. Finally, on the horizontal line through the coordinates 1 and 3 we can add 2 and get the horizontal line passing through the coordinates 3, 5 and 7. Thus if the perimeter of the triangle is of side C, D - D' - C' = AD - CB - CD - AD' - CB' - CD', which simplifies to AB, BC and CD= <5*5=25,5*3=15,3*7=22>>25+15+22=62. Then if C = 3, D = 7 and D' = 5, then C' = 13. We then must subtract AB, BC and CD. AB = 7-3 = < >> <<7-3=4>>, BC = 5-7 = < >> <<5-7=2>>, CD = 25-13 = < >> <<25-13=12>> and finally AD = 12. Thus the coordinates of the point are: < 5,15 >= and the area is:  < <<5*15>=75.

The winner of each hand pays $0.50 for every lose card. The draw proceeds as follows: Each player is dealt 11 cards, the player with the highest card chooses one card to discard and receive one new card as an upcard, then the next player chooses a card to discard and receives an upcard, and so on. How much money is available for a player to win at the end of the round? Choice D: $50.00.\nOutput:There is no \"win at the end of the game\". The total amount of the money a player will win is a guess work. A: $55.55.\nThis is the first round and the players are asked to put away money and not win the first round. So no one player will win a total of anything. The first hand all players will not win any money since they put their money away. After the first round, the players that loses at the first hand will lose their $5.00 plus the $0.50 on their loses, totaling $5.50.\nIn the next round, the total $5.50 will be added to the second round. In this way, we can always find out how much the players will receive if a player loses. But this will become a different amount every time, since the cards will be picked at random. There is no right answer if there is no one who wins.\n\nInput: A new employee was hired into the office recently.

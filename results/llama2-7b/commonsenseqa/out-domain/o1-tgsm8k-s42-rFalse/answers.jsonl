It's called an instance variable. These instances are also called objects, and the variable is called an object variable. Each set of instances has a specific name, and this name acts as an identifier. This identifier lets the language know which set of objects the variable refers to. As an example, let's say that you have an accounting system that keeps track of employee salaries. At any particular time, employee salaries take the form of an aggregate object called Salary. An individual object with the attributes of the aggregate's instance represents an employee. Each employee has a Salary object.\nThese objects may be nested, so that subordinate objects inherit characteristics of parent objects. As an example, the employee might be part of an employment company, where each employee (Salary) is within a specific department. Each department has a department manager, who is responsible for everything in his/her department. This department manager (DepartmentManager) becomes the parent of employee's department (Department). Each department has a department name, and this name becomes the employee's deptname attribute. An employee might have many depts (Department), and each one is associated with a specific employee. \n\n\n## Instructions\nIn this activity, you will be working with objects (represented by variables) to create and manipulate them by performing the actions that will be displayed in the code editor.

How much money do you need to keep?\n\n### Input How much money is left from John and his siblings s allowance? \n\n### Explanations:\n\n#### Part 1: \n\nThe recycling can receive $0.5$ for each can, so for 12 cans would get $12$ in revenue. The revenue would also receive $1.5$ for each 5 kilograms, so for 20 pounds would receive $30$. For a total of $42$.\n\n#### Part 2: \n\nJohn needed the job, but wishes that he would have stayed here.\n\nA person can not be both 1: A and 2 B. A person can not have two answers at the same time. So, we can answer with A.\n\n#### 3: \n\nSo how did he spend $1.50? Well, we know he had $1.50 leftover. If he did not have to spend it on anything, he would have a $0.50 shortage. So we can deduct $1.00 to account for his expenses. We have a surplus of $1.00, which is equal to $1.50 - $0.50 = 1.00.\n\n#### Part 4:\n\nHis children are $5 + 0 = 5$ dollars short.\n\n#### Part:5\n\n\n\n####\nA few more tips:\n\n- Always try to write clearly\n- You'd be surprised as to how much you can save your friends with the use of a clear language\n- If you're unsure about your answer, feel free to ask me", "answer": "C: closer"}

If every student is learning something, then they are getting knowledge individually. If they are getting knowledge as a group, then it would change the meaning and effect.

In response to the instruction, you are to choose either \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018E\u2019 that is appropriate to the task at hand. Be sure to choose the most appropriate answer in response to the instruction.\n\t![](task004.png)\n\n\tSo the correct answer to choose here is either \u2018A\u2019 or \u2019E\u2019.\n\n- The instruction in the image above describes a task. You are required to choose the correct answer to the task, that is, choose the answer that best completes the task.\n\tYour task here is to choose either \u2018A or E\u2019. First, look at the questions to identify the correct answer. You see that there is an option \u2018E\u2019 which reads \u2018That you are going to buy\u2019. This means that you are going to buy something and hence it is not the most appropriate option to choose among the choices. You must go to the next question which is \u2018Who is likely going in\u2019. This instruction further help you to decide which among the options is the correct one.\n\t\n\tSo what you need to identify now is the possible option which might fit the instruction \u2018Who is going to go to the market?\u2019 The first option that is, \u2018E\u2019 is not likely because as stated, this is referring to a market where one is likely to buy. Another option is \u2018D\u2019, this option reads \u2018spending money\u2019, which definitely does not fit the instruction \u2018Who would go to the market?). The last option is \u2018C\u2019, which you can tell from the context that fits with the instruction as it reads\u2019that you\u2019.\n\n\tSo, in summary you would choose E, which reads \u2018you are going to buy, and then choose \u2018 D which reads \u2018spending money.\n\n\tThe way you should work on this task is by identifying and picking either \u2018I\u2019 or \u2019E\u2019 from the choices provided. After identifying any of the options(\u2018I\u2019 or \u2019E) in the context provided, you can then check the questions further to determine whether it(\u2018I\u2019 or \u2018E\u2019) is an appropriate answer for the instructions.

If not, ask the user to supply the needed materials. For example, if you don't have the correct amount of apples, you should prompt for new supplies rather than ask how many apples you have.\n\n\n### Instructions:\n```\nUse the code segment at the bottom to complete the calculations.

Lions are intelligent creatures, and they have been shown to not only learn by instinct, but by communication and by watching other successful animals. They are playful and social animals, and they are known to work as a team and even as a family, when it comes to raising cubs. In fact, it has even been observed that the fights between parents have reduced the rates of inbreeding. They have also been observed sharing their food with others when they are in need of extra calories to store fat. They are a symbol of strength and power, and they are also known to be gentle and caring in nature. Because of these reasons, a Lion seems to be the perfect animal to be, in my opinion.

For example, my favorite relative clause is is a clause that my grandma the movie stars.\n\n- The most common types of relative clauses are restrictive  and nonrestrictive. \n- A restrictive relative clause tells the readers necessary information about the subject or object. For example, my best friend is a restrictive relative clause that describes the subject of the sentence the movie stars.\n- A nonrestrictive relative clause provides readers with extra information that is not vital to the subject or object. Thus, my best friend played the movie does not provide vital information about the subject.\n- The key to determining whether a relative clause is restrictive or nonrestrictive is to substitute the word that for the relative pronoun in a sentence. For example, My best friend, which plays the movie, has many followers. If the sentence still makes sense without that, the sentence is restrictive.", "answer": "E: present bill"}

If you purchase three more scarves, then you will receive $10 off every purchase. If the total cost of the scarves has an absolute value of $480, how many scarves does that represent? You can think of this as a counting question.\n\n\n### Response :\nAssume that the total cost is of 4 scarves are 4 * 120 = $480, and you can purchase more three of these scarves. So the total cost of the three more scarves has to be $10 off every one, which means $10 off $200 is $200 - $10 - $10 = $180, making the 4th scarf will cost you $110. This makes your total cost $480+110+80+50+50. So for 4 scarves the price is equal to 480$ and you only pay for the sum of 250$ to get the remaining 230$ free. So to sum it the whole thing up your will get for 4 for 480$ or 646.60$ for 4 if their are no taxes.\n\n### A computer that recycles 92 percent of its memory can store 175 megabytes.

It's called an instance variable. These instances are also called objects, and the variable is called an object variable. Each set of instances has a specific name, and this name acts as an identifier. This identifier lets the language know which set of objects the variable refers to. As an example, let's say that you have an accounting system that keeps track of employee salaries. At any particular time, employee salaries take the form of an aggregate object called Salary. An individual object with the attributes of the aggregate's instance represents an employee. Each employee has a Salary object.<n>These objects may be nested, so that subordinate objects inherit characteristics of parent objects.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: For every 12 cans you recycle, you receive $0.50, and for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, you receive $1.50. If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:John moved away from his family.

Choices:  A: present B: stay here C: closer D: available E: come here<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>### Input You are trying to use your own money to pay for your friend s tuition.  However, your bank account currently has $0 balance, and you are $1.50 short? How much money do you need to keep?<n><n>### Input How much money is left from John and his siblings s allowance? <n><n>### Explanations:<n><n>#### Part 1: <n><n>The recycling can receive $0.5$ for each can, so for 12 cans would get $12$ in revenue. The revenue would also receive $1.5$ for each 5 kilograms, so for 20 pounds would receive $30$. For a total of $42$.<n><n>#### Part 2: <n><n>John needed the job, but wishes that he would have stayed here.<n><n>A person can not be both 1: A and 2 B. A person can not have two answers at the same time. So, we can answer with A.<n><n>#### 3: <n><n>So how did he spend $1.50? Well, we know he had $1.50 leftover. If he did not have to spend it on anything, he would have a $0.50 shortage. So we can deduct $1.00 to account for his expenses. We have a surplus of $1.00, which is equal to $1.50 - $0.50 = 1.00.<n><n>#### Part 4:<n><n>His children are $5 + 0 = 5$ dollars short.<n><n>#### Part:5<n><n><n><n>####<n>A few more tips:<n><n>- Always try to write clearly<n>- You'd be surprised as to how much you can save your friends with the use of a clear language<n>- If you're unsure about your answer, feel free to ask me<n><n><n>

Also I felt that writing an algorithm was too complicated I decided to go with the simpler option is using a chart. I think this is something I need to work on. <n>  * Also since there was an option for a response and I had the choice between C and D as answers, but my answer was C.

Because the correct answer is knowlege. This is the only statement in the question that is singular rather than plural, so A and B don't fit. It is true that an individual student can listen to someone else, but that's very different from the effect listening has in general, which is plural. E indicates a response that is the opposite of the correct answer, so you can eliminate it.<n>C and D are both plausible as answers; only C is a correct answer, so I'll move D to the response.<n></p><n><n>### Input<n><n><p>The teacher told all the kids listening was key, it is the main way they would get knowledge. Do you agree?</p><n><n><p style = "text-align: justify"><n>We are looking for what the teacher's statement is the main way "they" students get. "Knowlege" is the correct term. We need to understand that the students is plural, so we need to look for the answers that fit the plural form.<n>We need to look at the statement to understand why "they" are getting knowledge. If every student is learning something, then they are getting knowledge individually. If they are getting knowledge as a group, then it would change the meaning and effect. We also rule out A and B due to singular forms of knowledge. The group of students could be affected by knowledge, but knowledge is for the individual students. E is the wrong answer because the purpose of listening to the teacher is to hear the words and understand the knowledge that is given. <n></p><n>

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: For every 12 cans you recycle, you receive $0.50, and for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, you receive $1.50. If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:Who is likely going in to a market? Choices:  A: stress B: food C: that you D: spending money E: walking<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Instructions:<n><n>- First, you are to choose the correct answer among A through E in response to the instruction below.(5pts,)<n><n><n>## Explanation<n><n>- Below is an instruction that describe a task. In response to the instruction, you are to choose either ‘A’ or ‘E’ that is appropriate to the task at hand. Be sure to choose the most appropriate answer in response to the instruction.<n>	![](task004.png)<n><n>	So the correct answer to choose here is either ‘A’ or ’E’.<n><n>- The instruction in the image above describes a task. You are required to choose the correct answer to the task, that is, choose the answer that best completes the task.<n>	Your task here is to choose either ‘A or E’. First, look at the questions to identify the correct answer. You see that there is an option ‘E’ which reads ‘That you are going to buy’. This means that you are going to buy something and hence it is not the most appropriate option to choose among the choices. You must go to the next question which is ‘Who is likely going in’. This instruction further help you to decide which among the options is the correct one.<n>	<n>	So what you need to identify now is the possible option which might fit the instruction ‘Who is going to go to the market?’ The first option that is, ‘E’ is not likely because as stated, this is referring to a market where one is likely to buy. Another option is ‘D’, this option reads ‘spending money’, which definitely does not fit the instruction ‘Who would go to the market?). The last option is ‘C’, which you can tell from the context that fits with the instruction as it reads’that you’.<n><n>	So, in summary you would choose E, which reads ‘you are going to buy, and then choose ‘ D which reads ‘spending money.<n><n>	The way you should work on this task is by identifying and picking either ‘I’ or ’E’ from the choices provided. After identifying any of the options(‘I’ or ’E) in the context provided, you can then check the questions further to determine whether it(‘I’ or ‘E’) is an appropriate answer for the instructions. So look at the instructions and pick either ‘A’

They can run with up to 50 miles per hour, making it easy for them to escape from those who would want to harm them. Their eyes, and even their claws are designed to help them hunt down prey. Lions are intelligent creatures, and they have been shown to not only learn by instinct, but by communication and by watching other successful animals. They are playful and social animals, and they are known to work as a team and even as a family, when it comes to raising cubs. In fact, it has even been observed that the fights between parents have reduced the rates of inbreeding. They have also been observed sharing their food with others when they are in need of extra calories to store fat. They are a symbol of strength and power, and they are also known to be gentle and caring in nature. Because of these reasons, a Lion seems to be the perfect animal to be, in my opinion.

Your function must have a return statement that has a list of strings with all the words found and the dictionary file name as a parameter in the parentheses.<n><n>### Your complete program should look like...<n><n>		import java.io.*;<n>    public class Test<n>    {<n>    	static List<String> listWords;<n>    	static String fileNameWords;<n>    <n>    	static void initializeList()<n>   		{<n>          listWords = new ArrayList<String>();<n>   		}<n>    <n>    	public static List<String> getDictWords(String DictionaryFileName)<n>   		{   	    	    	    	<n>          try<n>          {<n>             Scanner InputScanner = new Scanner(DictionaryFileName);<n>             initializeList();<n>             while (InputScanner.hasNext())<n>              {<n>                 listWords.add(InputScanner.next());  <n>              }    <n>             InputScanner.close();<n>             listWords = Collections.unmodifiableList(listWords);  <n>          }<n>          catch (FileNotFoundException e)<n>          {<n>             System.out.println("Dictionary file not found");<n>          }<n>          return listWords;<n>   		} <n>    	public static int readFile(String fileName)<n>   		 {<n>          Scanner nameScanner = new Scanner (fileName);<n>          return nameScanner.nextInt();<n>   		}   <n>    	public static String readLine(String fileName)<n>    	{<n>          Scanner fileNameScanner = new Scanner ("");<n>          fileNameScanner.useDelimiter("\n");<n>          fileNameScanned = fileNameScanner.nextLine();<n>          return fileNameScanned;<n>    	} 	<n>

Choices:  A: crash B: living C: slow down D: carry people E: speed up<n><n>### Response:		<n>Airplanes have a lot of empty space in their bodies that can be used to store fuel, luggage and even food. However, there is much less space inside the plane, where passengers are seated. Since the plane needs fuel for power and it needs space for cabin passengers, there is only so much cabin space to share between the people and air on board. Since passengers and the plane need oxygen, the cabin cannot be filled to the brim with air. So, there is a cabin for people to sit, eat, drink, and sleep in.<n>When the plane arrives at its destination and lands, the plane has to slow itsself down from 600 miles per hour to zero. That is why the plane uses its cargo holds and its cabin as a buffer by slowing down the plane and using its engineers to slow down the plane.<n>

Choices:  A: make breakfast B: go hiking C: pack or bag D: light fire E: grab a match<n><n>### Response:		<n>Input: If you put 0.5 pounds of powdered milk into a pan and add 0.5 pound of dried rice, how heavy will the dish be? (NOTE: powdered milk weighs 3.2 ounces for every 1 pound, and dried rice weighs 2.2 ounces per pound. Powdered milk does not have liquid, and rice needs to be completely cooked and have no liquid. This will be reflected in your calculation.)<n><n>Output: There is an error in this calculation: If you are going to use 0.5 pounds powdered milk and add 0.25 pounds rice, you should then weigh the 0.5 pounds first, and then add the rice.<n><n>### Input<n><n>Input: A man is carrying a suitcase that weighs 12.5 pounds.

A friend of mine played basketball and has many follower<n>```<n><n>## A relative clause is a relative clause is a part of a sentence that identifies  one of the two subjects. For example, my favorite relative clause is is a clause that my grandma the movie stars.<n><n>- The most common types of relative clauses are restrictive  and nonrestrictive. <n>- A restrictive relative clause tells the readers necessary information about the subject or object. For example, my best friend is a restrictive relative clause that describes the subject of the sentence the movie stars.<n>- A nonrestrictive relative clause provides readers with extra information that is not vital to the subject or object. Thus, my best friend played the movie does not provide vital information about the subject.<n>- The key to determining whether a relative clause is restrictive or nonrestrictive is to substitute the word that for the relative pronoun in a sentence. For example, My best friend, which plays the movie, has many followers. If the sentence still makes sense without that, the sentence is restrictive. <n>

Then "Do" repeats at the very top, and the next line would be "Re." The order of the remaining notes is based on their relative size to do. "Re" is the same amount as "Do" and is called "the" "Do" Re Mi. "Fa" is smaller than "Do" and is the next natural note, so it is called Fa Re Mi.

Choices:  A: place of work B: office C: friend's house D: workplace E: deep thought<n><n>### Response:		<n>I believe there are plenty of reasons for a human to go to another human's house. For one, to enjoy each other company or to share their knowledge and information, which helps us to improve ourselves both physically and mentally. Furthermore, you might also find a new skill or technique or even get inspired from someone else. Hence, visiting someone to have conversation and make new friendship is another important reason for us to go their house.<n><n>### Input :<n>You can buy a cashmere scarf for $120. If you purchase three more scarves, then you will receive $10 off every purchase. If the total cost of the scarves has an absolute value of $480, how many scarves does that represent? You can think of this as a counting question.<n><n><n>### Response :<n>Assume that the total cost is of 4 scarves are 4 * 120 = $480, and you can purchase more three of these scarves. So the total cost of the three more scarves has to be $10 off every one, which means $10 off $200 is $200 - $10 - $10 = $180, making the 4th scarf will cost you $110. This makes your total cost $480+110+80+50+50. So for 4 scarves the price is equal to 480$ and you only pay for the sum of 250$ to get the remaining 230$ free. So to sum it the whole thing up your will get for 4 for 480$ or 646.60$ for 4 if their are no taxes.<n><n>### A computer that recycles 92 percent of its memory can store 175 megabytes.

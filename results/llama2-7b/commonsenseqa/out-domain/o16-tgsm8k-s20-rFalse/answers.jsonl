There are five candidates running in the election, but the president is only elected based on first preference. People may vote multiple choice (from the 5 candidates) of whom they prefer the most. The system assigns points by rounding the fractional votes to the nearest 10th and if the votes are fractions of 1/100 that are greater than 1/5, those are rounded up to 1 and less to 0 (i.e. 67.5% -> 70%, 1.2 -> 1, 1.1 -> 0). Each candidate receives points only if an exact fractional vote value is given for that candidate. The total number of points assigned to each candidate is then summed and the candidate with the most points is elected president. If there is a tie, a runoff is held between the tied candidates, each with 0.5 more votes than the other (i.e. if they had 10 votes each, the tied candidate is assigned 10.5). The first candidate to win by at least 0.5 votes wins.  In this election, these are the final voting results: Bob got 28 points, Carol got 265 points, Jim got 16 points, and so on.

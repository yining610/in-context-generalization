Stressful driving is one of the highest risk behaviours on the road.\nDriving under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, for example, is illegal.\nSleepy-eyed drivers, for example, may be deadly.\nDriving in a dangerous area, like downtown traffic when you are unfamiliar with the city, could lead to accidents.\nDriving recklessly is probably \"dangerous\" but still legal.\nDriving while under stress is definitely a risk factor, however, it may not be what the question-writer had in mind when they put it on this list.\nSo, the correct answer is B: dangerous \t\n\nInput: A car company needs to design a new car for urban driving.  The company believes that it would be better to design a car with a small, light fuel tank, rather than an oversized one.  The company\u2019s analysis shows that, if you reduce the size of the fuel tank by 30%, the average fuel consumption per liter drops by 25%.\nWhich of the following conclusions can be drawn from this?\nInput: This car company\u2019s analysis shows a decrease in gas mileage of 25% when a certain amount of tank is removed.  In other terms, if the tank size was reduced by 30%, then the fuel mileage would decrease by 25%.  There are two major conclusions to be drawn from the statement:\n\nInput: A smaller fuel tank may reduce the fuel consumption per mile.  A:  The statement says that if you reduce the size by 30%, fuel consumption will drop by 25%. Therefore, you can conclude that the smaller the fuel tank, the lower the fuel consumption per mile will be.\n\nB:  Second, the statement is referring to how a 30% reduction in one\u2019s fuel tank size would lead to a 25% increase in the fuel consumption per mile, which may not be the desired situation.\n\nThe correct answer is B: When the question uses the phrase \u201cfrom this,\u201d followed by a blank, it suggests a drawback.  The company has made assumptions based on the size change of the tank, which may lead to other drawbacks. For example, they may have assumed that gas mileage decreased because of the decrease in size of the car engine,", "answer": "B: dangerous"}

The group must carry backpacks weighing more than 1.\nTo carry 3 backpacks, one person can carry 1, because the other two are 2 and 3 pounds.\nTherefore, the minimum number is 1, 2, and 3.\nThe 3 pounds backpacks must go to the t group, which is the smaller of the two.\n\nLet k be the number of packs that the first group has, and j be the number of pack that the second has.\n\nThen, the minimum is:\nt+[t = j].\n\nFirst group will carry 3 packs, second will carry 7.\n\nSo the final answer s 3 and j = 4\n\nInput:$20 + 12 + 10 = $<<20+12+", "answer": "C: feel safe"}

I have a car, and I bought a hand truck. The car can lift 2500lbs and the hand truck can lift 750lbs. How many boxes can I move in an hour?\nOutput:  I bought a hand trruck and I have a car.\nSo, I need to find out the box I can load on the hand truck.\nThe hand truck can lift a box with max weight of 750lbf.\nTo handle more boxes per unit of time, I need more trucks.\nThe formula for the number of box I want to handle per unit of time is:\n(box size) * (lifting weight) / (car payload weight) = <<1/(1000)>>1000 box/hour\nThe box size is 12 pounds. The lifting weight on the hand truck is 750lf. The car payload weight is 2500 lbs.\nSo, in order to load a total 100 boxes on 2 trucks, the total weights is 250*100 = 25,000 / 250 = 100.\nSo, load the weight of 100 boxes per hour.\nSince the car can handle a 2500lb load, so the load of total 100 box is\n(2500 - (2500/100)) = <<2500-250/100>>2300 lbs/truck.\nSo, I can move 2300lbs in an hour.\nBesides, the hand truck needs to empty itself after each cycle. The hand truck can lift up 1000lbs per hour (max). This need must be counted.\nSo, I move 100 boxes and I", "answer": "E: cause accidents"}

It flies 200 miles in an hour at the altitude of 3000 feet.  If a plane can make 6 round trips with all its passengers, what is the minimum number of passengers the plane has to carry to fill up?\nOutput: The number of hours the plane is in the air = 200 miles/120 passengers = 1.66 hours\nIf the plane makes 6 round trips, each trip takes 4 hours = 200/20 = 10 hours\nTherefore, the plane can make 10/4 = 2.5 trips before it returns\nSo, it needs 6 - 2.5 = <<6-2.5=3.5>>3.5 trips before the plane returns\nTherefore, the minimum number of passengers for the plane to carry to fill it up is 120/3.5 = <<120*3.5=420>>420\nSo the final is 420\n\nInput: There are 4 people and 3 bags with toys in a house.

The apple salesman sold 2 large boxes of apples. The shopkeeper sold all the apples from the two large boxes by placing one box on the floor and one on the counter. There were 3 apples left over from the stacking of the apples. If a person was looking for just one apple, what was the probability that the person will only have to look on the counter to find if there were any apples remaining?\nOutput: 1/3 is the required probability that the person will find the apple on the counter\nProbabilities are represented by numbers such as 1/3, 3/10, etc, where the numerator is the probability that an item will happen, and the denominator is the total chances of that item happening. To calculate the number of chances for a person to find the apple on the floor and on the counter, you have to add the probabilities of the two items happening (the probability of finding the apple on the floor is 1/2, and the probability of finding the apple under the counter is 1/10). Hence, the answer is 1/3\nSo the final answer 1/3\n\nInput: A book has the dimensions of 24 cm x 20 cm.  The cover has the dimensions of 10 cm x 2 cm.

Then subtract six months. Then repeat.\nWe do not know how many months there are, but we do know how many days there are in each month. So you can do this math. You get the first number - the first answer in the sequence.\nIf there are not enough months, just count the number of days that have passed since John Smith's birth.\nIf it is a leap year, you will get the date of John Smith's birth, or if you have to count the number of days of the year since John Smith was born.\nNow that we have John Smith's date of birth and age, you can put those numbers together and get the number of birthdays he has had.

It needs to keep coming full circle. Since only one person asks all the name\u2019s, there should be one person who asks D which is last in the cycle. This person asks, what is his/her grandparent in-law name, which is B. So here B is passed to B and this cycle comes to an end by B.

Choices: A: At least some of the people who dropped out left the hike before travelling 99 kilometers. B: All of those who dropped out were women. C: It must be possible to carry out the hike without anyone dropping out. D: Three dropping out means that at least 2 people started the hike at the same time with a different one coming back at the same time. The total amount of people that did the work were half of who ever started if no one dropped out. There are enough people to do the hike so dropping out never happened. The total amount of miles that were walked were 50% of who ever started if one person dropped out.\nOutput:A: False,  A\nTo walk a hundred kilometers you need 100 people to walk 1/100 of that distance each (approximately). Since some of the group already started the hike there needs to be more than 100 people on the hike when it ends.\nIf 3 people drop out, and only 2 dropping out means that 3/3 = <<3/3=1>>1 person stayed, not 100.\nThe total amount of people that started the hike is less than 100, as two people dropped out midway.\nIf 3/3 = 1 remained, 3/3 * 99 = <<3/3*99=33>>33.\nThere are 207 people who started, since the amount that stayed is 86 or less.\nSince 86 or more was subtracted when someone left, 100 % or more was added when someone joined.\nBut 100% = 100/100 = <<100/1 0=1>>1.\nSo if 100% of 33 or less (the value that was added after a", "answer": "E: neatness"}

One is dime, and the rest are quarters. How many quarters do I have? \nOutput: The coins are worth a total of $2, but it does not give the sum.

Each day, she spends a little over 5 minutes filling it up with fuel. She fills it up each day except on days when she doesn't need to go anywhere.  On these no travel days she spends about 15 minutes cleaning her car. On non driving days, she spends 5 minutes reading about cars online.  How many minutes a week is Dorris behind the wheel?\nOutput: It takes Dorris 5 minutes a day to fill up her gas. During the week her car is full of gas.  She drives it everyday except on Fridays in which she doesn't need the car. Each of her weekly journeys uses 5 minutes. This equals to 4 * 7 * 5 = <<4*7*5=105>>105 minutes of driving during the week. 15 minutes a day cleaning her car (4 * 5 * 5 = 130>130 minutes) 60 (5 minutes to read about cars online = 60>60) = 205 minutes for Dorris during the week. So we need to subtract the driving, so 105-205 = -100, -100 = -45, -45 = -15\nSo the final answer here is -15\n\nInputThe amount of electricity an electrical appliance uses each hour:Choices:  A: 70 megawatts B: 150 watts C: 1.25 watts D: 2 watts E: 5 watts\nOutputThe correct choice is D (2 watts).

The 6 marbles he put in the 30-marbles jar were 11 - 8 = <<11-8=3>>3 marbles.\nHence, he is left with 11 - 3 = <<11-3=8>>8 marbles in the 30 jar (assuming it doesn't count as the one he put in at the start).\nHence, the number of marbles he has in the 25 jars is 6 + 8 = <<6+8=14>>14.\nSo the final answer should be: 14\n\nInput: The speed-limit on a stretch of highway is 70mph.

John needs to collect data on whether people who eat vegetables are either obese or lean. He takes his research project to a local community centre to interview people who come for fitness classes. From each person he interviews, he asks, \"Are you obese?\". He finds that 69% of the group say \"Yes\", but only 21% are obese. However, for every person who is obese, 75% say they eat vegetables, but only 39% of 21% of obese people actually do so. (It is possible for non-obese people to say they do not eat vegetables).

How much faster will Jane get to the reunion than her husband will?\nOutput: If the convoy is traveling at an average of 100 + 80 = <<100+80=180>>180 mph, then\ntheir combined average speed = average car + average police = 180/2= <<180/2== 90>>90 mph.\n\nWith an average speed of 90 mph, the woman's husband will take 1.5675h = <<1.5678=100>>h\n(converted into minutes) to get there\n\nwith an average speed of 101mph, the woman will take less time = 99% of the combined value to get there\n99% of 90 = <<99*90=90>>90 minutes\nSo the final answer should be 90 + 1.5667h = <<1.9669>e90=98.09>>98.09 minutes\n\nInput: If Jane travels at speed 60 km/h, how long is she 36 km from home?\nOutput: Using the simple rate time formula, the amount of time from Jane's home to the point at which she travels at 60 km/hour = 1800/60 = <<1800/2=900>>s\nTo calculate the duration of the 36km distance at the rate of 60km/hour we subtract this value from the 36km", "answer": "B: woods"}

The car runs out of gas completely after driving another 10 km. How much fuel does one litre of gasoline supply for a car?\nOutput: The tank starts out as 20 litres filled with 20 litre of gasoline. The tank ran out of that after 50 km, so it has gone 50 km with only 20 litres to drive the additional 10 km.\nHence, 1 litre supplies for 50 + 10= <<50+10=60>>km of driving\nSo the final answer should be 60/1=<<60/1=60>>km\n\nInput: It costs 70 cents, 91 cents, and 162 cents, respectively, to produce one kilogram of each of these three fruit: coconuts, pineapples, and grapefruits.

If at the start of the first day, the number of each group flying north and south is equal, then how many more birds fly north each day?\nOutput:If at the start of the day, the number of birds flying north and south is the same, the number of birds that fly north every day must be: 10 + 2 * x = <<10+2*x=12>>10 more than the number of birds that flew south that day\nThis will mean that the number of birds flying south each day was: | 2 + x |.\nIf we use those values to try and find x, we will find that x must be 6.  If we had 6 birds that flew north each day, we could then find that 16 birds flew south.\nSo the final answe is B\n\nInput: A woman is in charge of 3 dogs.

How long does it take you to checkout if it takes 0.25 minutes to checkout a student?\nOutput: This question is meant to give a tricky solution.\nThe solution I used: In order to get the correct answer, you have to count the first line correctly.\nIf the question were asking how long it takes 2.5 students to checkout, it would take 2.5 students a minute to checkout.\nSo now you have to multiply by 0.25.\nIf it actually took 0.25 students a minute, then you have to divide by 2 and you subtract the 0.25 from 1 so you have to subtract 0.25 to find out how long, and then you multiply by 2.5.\nSo, 2.5/0.25 = 10 which is correct because it takes 10 x 0.25 =1.25 minutes before the 2.5th student has checkouted\nYou subtract 1.25 you find out it takes 1.25 - 0.25=1\nThen you multiply by 2 because 0.25 was the number of students.\nThen you multiply by the last amount of students which is 2\nSo it turns out it takes 4 minutes. To find how long it takes it takes 1.3 minutes for the first student to checkout then 1+1.3 = 2.3 minutes to checkout all of the students.\nSo the Final answer is 1 minute + 2.3 = <<1+2.3=3.3>>3.3 minutes to checkout\n\nInput: A 99-page book is 16 ounces.

The store manager wants to know what to replace the item with in order to save the most money in a year. The original price of the items was: Apple - $1.00, Banana - $0.80, Pear - $0.95.  Each was stolen a certain number of times. Banana was stolen 6 times, Pear was stolen 5 times, and Apple was stolen every time someone entered the store. How many bananas do we need to purchase in a year in order to save the store the most money?\nOutput: Assume that the cost of stolen items is the same as the cost of the items, and that only stolen items affect the manager's cost.\nSo to save the store the money, we should only replace the stolen apple with the stolen apple, leaving the remaining 4 stolen items unchanged. So the apple will only be replaced if it was stolen.\nSimilarly, to save the store the maximum money, pears will only be replaced if they were stolen.\nTherefore, to save the store 2004 dollars, we should replace bananas with stolen bananas, and replace pears with stolen pears.\nBy replacing all the stolen items, we save the store: $1.00 * 6 + $0.80 * 5 + $0.95 * 4 = $<<1.00*6+0.80*5+0.95*4=9.7>>9.7 dollars\nSo the final answer will be 9.7\n\nInput: A farmer needs to plant 5 seeds in 5 different rows of", "answer": "A: netherlands"}

If the away team wins, then each player of the away team receives the ball.  If the home team wins, the defending team keeps possession of the ball and wins.  A team can also win a 3 point bonus for scoring after running the ball into the opponent's end zone.  If a team is leading on any other count by more than 3, then it wins the game.  If a team loses the game on any other count by margin of 3 or less, then it wins 1 point. If a team has no other player with a ball or if it has no other ball, then it loses 3 points.  If the home and the away team have 2 ball each, then the 2 balls are put together randomly, and the team with the ball that has the longest distance from its goal line wins 1 point.

They start at point A and B respectively.\nFirst we find the distance between point A to point D.  The distance is the diameter of a full circle, which is 2*pi*r.\nHere 2*pi=3.142\nAnd r is 1/2*pi*radius\nThe radius is also given in the question at 1/4 of the distance.\nRadius  = r = 1/4 of 3.142*2 = << 1/4*3.142^2=0.777>>0.777\nSo the distance from A to D is 1.548 r.  That means at D, the student who started at A traveled (1/4) of a circle\nBecause they both traveled at the same speed, the two student traveled a (1/4) circle each.\nTherefore their travel time at the circle is 1/2 (1/4) = <<1/4/2=1/8>>1/8.\nThe distance between  A and D is  r and the distance travelled on the circle is given by ((1/4) r)\nHence,\n((1/4) r)/1/8 = r\n(r/1/8)=r\nr/8 = r\n8 = 8 so the final answer is 0.833", "answer": "A: battle field"}

Modulus of 854 with 100 is 39, so 853 is modulus of 999 is 44.\nSince 999 is close to 1000, it can be considered as a whole number. There is no point for you to get the remaining 50 units. You can get the last 44 units for $44.\nSince the price of 50 units is $19 and the price of 200 units is $75, so the price of 853 is $769.30, which is 853 * 99.9/100 = $852.70 + $6.60.\nSo the answer is $769,30.\nThe final answer is $763.30.\n\nInput: The girl was upset.

It's when the game's players run away from the fox, who chases everybody else.\nThere are more than one type of where you can find a fox hunting, but it will be played in an open field or arctic tundra.  So, the correct answer would be \"C: beach\"\n\nOutput:C. The beach is a type of natural body of water surrounded by land.  They can be found on almost any continent to any body of water such as oceans, seas, gulfs, or bays.  Apart from oceans and seas, beaches can be found inside islands including atolls, and can be found on the continental shelf.  Beaches on seamounts are called slopes. Beaches are a part of the intertidal zone.  When a beach is covered at high tide it is known as an \"exposed beach\".  Beaches should be distinguished from beach ridges, which are landforms, such as spits, formed at nearly right angles to the shore but aren't the same thing as beaches themselves.  The latter is found on the bayside of island countries.  Beaches and coastal topography are shaped by wave interaction with coast, tides and storms.  There are a number of different ways to classify beaches, such as location or geologic processes.  Beaches are used for recreation, tourism, fishing, and habitat protection.  Because beaches are leased through a concession system, the revenues can become significant sources of income for the hosting country.\n\nThere is a lot of information in this question.  To get you thinking, you must figure why the correct answer is \"C: beach\" by eliminating some of the incorrect answers.\n\nLet's first find out if we've eliminated the right answer in the choices.\n\n1.  Can a fox hunting game be played in a forest?  No, the answer is \"False.\"  An open field is needed.\n\n2.  What does an arctic tundra look like?  It is very cold with very little vegetation.

What is the probability that it rains at least once between Monday and Friday?\nOutput: Monday has a 90% probability of raining. A chance of at least 60% means that the chances of rain will not exceed 60%. There are possible ways to calculate P from the following information. Let 0 be a Monday that doesn\u2019t rain. In that case, the probability of rain is 100-0. If we assume that Monday rains, then there are 3 possible days between each Monday that it doesn\u2019t rain: Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. For Wednesday, there is 60% chance that it rains between Wednesday and Monday. For Thursday, there is 40% chance that it would rain between Thursday and Monday. If Monday rained, we have a chance of 61%-41%. If we assume that neither Monday rain, then there are 4 possible days between each and every Monday that doesn\u2019t. For the same two days as before, Wednesday and Thursday, there will be a chance of 19%+6%, which gives a 25% chance that it will rain. For Friday, there will be a 40% chance.  If we assume that Monday doesn\u2019t rain, we have 35%+14%+38%+25%=82% overall chance of rain.

They estimate that the water needs to be cooled from 220 degrees fahrenheit to 60 degrees fahrenheit using this solution. If the solution reduces the water temperature by 0.2 degrees fahrenheit per hour, how much time does it take to bring the water temperature down to 60 degrees? Choice:A: 40 hours B: 80 hours C: 4 hours D: 30 hours E: 65 hours\nOutput:Since the cooling reduces the temperature by 0.02 degrees every hour, we can use C = f(t), where t is the total time the water takes to cool down and c is our cooling rate and t is the time. We can rewrite this as t = C/f(t) where C is the total time to cool and f(t) is the cooling rate. This gives us f(t) = t/C\nAlso, since 60 - 220 = (220-60)/220\nWe can write f(t) as (220 - 60)/22 = t/C - since t is the time, the units cancel each other out leaving C = (60- 220)/22 = (260/44) = 6\nPlug this C back into our equation to find t, and find that it takes 60/6 = 10 hours to cool\nSo the final answer has to be D) because the answer is 10 hours.\n\nInput:A car travels a distance of m yards at a rate of v yards per hour.

If the second player answers the first player, the number of guessers will be reduced by 1 because they will leave the game. If there are 4 questions asked, each person can guess 4 times (since they have to guess 4 times to answer all the questions). Each guess will reduce the number of guesses by 1. Therefore, the number of remaining guesses will be 4 - 3 = <<4-3=1>>1.\n\nIf the second player plays the first player, the person will be reduced by 2 because they can answer 2 questions.

However, the choice is not a noun, so we can eliminate that possibility.\nNext, we notice that this question contains \"leg\" and \"piano\" as well as \"legroom\" and \"bed\".  We can eliminate the answer options that have the same words in that same position so \"spinning wheel\", \"hospital bed\", and \"legroom\" are eliminated, as well.\nFinally, \"grand piano\" is the correct choice because it has \"leg\" next to \"piano\", fulfilling the two-word clue to the answer.\nSo the final and correct choice is \"grand piano\".\n\nInput: What is the definition of a palindrome?\nOutput: A palindrome is a word, number or phrase, that reads the same forwards and backwards.\nFor example, the word racecar is a palindrome.\nAnother way to think about it is that every letter in the word is reversed to read the word again.\nA famous palindrome is:  \"A man, a plan, a canal--Panama.\"\n\nInput: What number has an area of square, a perimeter of six, and is divisible by the number of sides it has?\nOutput: The numbers 3\u00b2 and 5\u00b2 are special because they are the only numbers in the shape of a triangle.\nThe perimeter of a triangle is 6 which cannot happen for square or rectangle.\nThe perimeter is the sum of the length of each side.\nThe area of a triangle is \u221a3 and the area of a rectangle is 4 times the length squared.\n\nInput: A number is divisible by 4 if the remainder is 0 or 4 when it is divided by 4.

How would he pay for his items?\nOutput:  The total cost of each item the boy wants to buy is $<<20+3(20)+3(50)+3(100)>. He has 3 coins in his pocket, each of which is equal. So, the boy can buy any item he can by spending equal amount to each item because he does not have any other option. That means, in terms of the cost, each item is $<<3*20=.6>>.6 times the cost of the same item. And he wants to buy 3 apples and 3 cakes. So, he needs to spend 3 *.6 = <<3*.6=1.8>>1.8 times the cost of the apple. Similarly, he needs to spend the equal amount of money for cakes too. He has some remaining of money. So he has to spend 20c - 1.8 = <<20-1.8=18>>1.8.\nSo, he will buy all the items by spending the amount of money remaining.

If the city does not serve fish and chips then the paw always has the nail in it.  If the city serves both, then the paw has the nail only if the person ate fish and chips. Let's say the city is Philadelphia. How do you determine this by looking at the paw?\nOutput:First write out all of the possible choices, because in Philadelphia hot dogs are the most popular meal, so we know that if the person ate a fish and chip then the paw has a nail. Therefore, the possible choices are 1 and 2, because if the person ate the hot dog, the paw does not have a nail. If the person ate the fish and chips then we know that the paw has the paw.\nTherefore the final choice is C, because we know that the person ate a hotdog unless the person ate the only thing that the city offered as their most popular meal, the fish and chips.\n\n\n\n## Submission\nPlease include a GitHub link to the file you submitted in your answer.

Exactly 2 students have hazel eyes.  Exactly two students have blue eyes. How many students have blue-green eyes?\nOutput: There are two students with blue eyes.  Each of those can be either blue or green or both.  So we have 6 possibilities.  So the number of students with blue-green eyes has to divide evenly into the number of possibilities.  The fraction 32/6 = 5/3 is even. So we have to divide 5 into 3.  3 divided by 2=1 2 divided by 0=2 1 divided by 1=1 1 cannot divide into 2, so 1+1=2.

What is the difference in amount of defensive and offensive players?\nOutput: The difference is 7 - 7 = <<7-7=0>>0 If the team switched the ratio by 7 players from the offensive side to the defensive side, the number of defensive players stayed constant (7) while the number of offensive players decreased by the same amount of players (7).\nSo the final 7 players that were switch from the offensive to defensive are the defensive players.\nSo the final conclusion is 12-0 = 12.\nSo the final team have 7 defensive players, 5 offensive players.\nSo it is true that the 7 defensive players is even with 7 offensive players, but the total number of defensive players is equal to 12.\nTherefore the team does want an even ratio of defensive to offensive players.\n\nInput: If a group of eight men and four women wants to serve themselves pie from a rectangular pie pan that holds an exact number of pies, how should the men and women be divided to divide the pies equally?\nOutput: The group of eight men and women need two different solutions in order to fill an exact amount of pie, one for four men and one for two men.\nFour men and only two women is sufficient to fill one solution.\nTwo men and three or four women would not fill the remaining solution completely.

Answer only in whole numbers.\nOutput: The first question asked is to give us the answers in whole numbers.  We know that an isosceles triang, must have two sides of equal length.  We can find the perimeter of the triang and then divide it by two (to get one side), then we multiply this by 8 to get the second side length.  P = 2L + 2S We are given: (1) L = 8 (2) S = L/4  We know that the perimeter of the isosceles trian is 2*L + 2*S  So: P = 2L, and 2L/4 = 2L/2  Then: L = 2*L  So: L = 8  S = L/4 = 2  L = 8  Now we need to take L/4 and multiply it by 8 to get each side length:  L/4 times 8 = 2L/8 Now we need to take 2L/8 and add it to itself to find the perimeter of this triang.  So: P = (2L/8) + (2L/8), and P = L/4 + L/4 We can rewrite it as P = 2*(L/4 + L/8) = 2*(L + L/2)  which simplifies to: P = 2*( 2L + 1)  so the perimenter of the isoscelse triang will be: 2*( 2*8 + 1) = 20 inches.  So the final answer will be 20 inches.\n\nInput: The amount of air in a balloon can be given by the formula V = 17.3h + 16.1 (where V is the volume and h is the height).

You have to draw such a square. How many lines do we need?\nOutput: We first need to find the size to make sure we can draw a square. By dividing the width and the height, we get a new number a. This new number will be used to draw the square. This can be done by simply dividing the length and width of paper by the square-area. In this case we get a = 2. After finding a, we find the other value by subtracting the radius of a circle (diameter) by the radius of the new square (b) so b = r \u2013 d.\nIn the end, we need to find the diagonal. To do so we have to find the perimeter, p = 2a + 2b. We also know that there will be 4 lines needed. That means that b is 1/4 of 2a. We can solve the following equation to find the a we just found above: a\u00b2 = b * d. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve an equation with two known sides: 2 a\u00b2 + 2 a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 \u2013 d\u00b2 2 a\u00b2 = d\u00b2 \u2013 b\u00b2 This means that a\u00b2 = (b+d)/2 a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = d\u00b2\nNow, we have to divide the 4 lines that result from two overlaps. That's done by finding c which is \u00bd of the original length of the paper, c = (a+b)/2, and draw 4 lines with c as a distance from the two original overlaps 1 line from every \u00bd of the paper 4/2 = 2\nSo in total we need 15 lines.

How many people lost in the last round if only 80 participants participated?\nOutput: This problem only works with the last round.\nSo we need to find how many lost in the previous round. 80/1000 + 79/5000 + 80/5000 = <<80/10+80/50+80/10=52>>52 lost.\nSo in round 1, 80-52 = <<80-52=28>>28 participants won.\nIn round 2, 28/1000 won.\nHence, only 80 - (28/10) = <<80-(28/10)=32>>32 people participated in round 2.\nFor Round 3, we know that 5000 - 5000 = 0 people participated.\nFor Round 4, we need to find the 80-32 participants.\nSo 80-35 = <<80-35=45>>45 participated.\nSo in round one, round one: 80-51 = <<80-60=20>>22 people participated.\nTo get round three winners, we divide this by 5000.

How many kilometers does she walk overall in one day?\nOutput: If a woman walks for 8 hours at a steady pace without stopping, then her rate of walking is 1 km/hr.\nSo she walked Km/hr * 8 hrs = Km\nThen she rests for 8 hrs, which means she stopped walking for Km/hr * total time it takes to walk Km/hr * Km/hr * resting duration = Km Total distance travelled = Km\nSo the final answer 8*Km/hr + 8*Km = Km\n\nInput: A plane flew for 12 hours non-stop, and then landed and parked for 12 hours. How many hours did it fly for overall in one day? How many hours did it land and park for? Assume the plane flew non-stop for more than 24 consecutive hours.\nOutput: If a plane flew non-stope for more than 25 consecutive hours, they had to land and park for some hours.\nThe time travelled flying is Km/hr * flying time.\nThe total time during the entire flight non-stop is 12 hours + flight duration, so it takes an additional 12 hours to land and park.\nSo the total time travelled fly is Km/hr + (12/1hour) * 12hrs = Km + 60Km.\nThe total time landed and parked is (12/1hr) * 12 hrs = 720 hrs\nSo the answer is Km + 690Km + 720 hours.\n\nInput: Joe gets a 90-pound box delivered to his house.

You toss a rock into the water, and you estimate that it is about 3 minutes before the echo of your rock comes back to you. How far would the rock need to be thrown to create a 2 minute echo?\nOutput: You can solve for the ratio of time to distance using the equation, T = D/v, where T is time in seconds, D is the distance in feet of the rock to its target, and v is the speed of sound in feet/second. If you assume the temperature of water doesn't change much with altitude (meaning the speed of sound at sea level is roughly the same at the river as it is on the hike), and that the air temperature is 50 degrees and that there is no wind, you can calculate the speed of sound as v = c * (c+d/d) where c is the speed of light = 3009250 ft/sec, d is the temperature in degrees fahrenheit, and the value 315424.501 gets plugged in for c+d/d so that the value of temperature goes into the equation. With the assumptions above, the speed of sound is approximately 1080 ft/sec. Therefore the time of an echo of T equals the ratio of distance to the speed of sound D/1080, where T in seconds is set to two minutes.", "answer": "B: schoolroom"}

How many black squares does each of the different colored squares share with each other?\n####### The numbers on the rows are used to show the order of the people as if seated on the table.\n------\nSo a green person is on a purple square, and there is one green person. There is exactly one person sitting on the first purple square, and one on the second.

Also, if a person is red on a second purple, they can not be on the first purple since they would be incapable of being on the third.\nSo there are 45 red-green people.\nSimilarly, there can only be 4 blue persons on the first purple; however, there are 1", "answer": "D: legal fees"}

She can afford to spend half of her weekly allowance on jeans. She also can afford to spend 50% more of her weekly allowances buying the jeans. That is, if she can spend $20 on the jeans, she will have 33 cents left. How much did the jeans cost?\nOutput:First, calculate the percentage discount: $20 / 1.5 * 100 = $<<1.5*20=30>>3\nSecond, find the percent increase of jeans cost: 100 - discount = 100 - 30 = <<100-30=70>>7\nFind the ratio of percentage increase to discount: 70/3 = <<70/3=23>>23.3\nThese ratios are all decimal, so you need to convert them to whole numbers.\nSo then, 70/30 = <<70/2=7>>7 = multiply\n5/3 = <<5/2=2.5>>125/25 = <<125/2=5>>25\nFind percentage increase: 5/25 = 1/5 = <<5/25=0.2>>20\nTherefore: 6.7/2 = <<6.7/2=3.35>>3\nSo the answer is 3.35.\n\nInput: The cafeteria in a prison is charging $5 for a burger, $3 for a sandwich, and $1 for an apple.

As long as you don\u2019t leave this room, the world will never end. How many days are in a year?\nAnswer: The number of days in a year is 365.  Because if the world has existed for 4.6 billion, it is safe to assume 1/4.6 billion of the days have passed.  Divided by 100 leaves us with the number of years in a 4.6 billion year old world. This is 26.6 billion years old.  Then divided by 365, leaves us with the amount of days in one year is 73 years.  But because of leap years we then add a day every four years. But because this calculation is 73 in one year, there is another 4 years, leaving a total of 426 years, again divide by 365 to see that the number of days in one year 4.6 billion is 1,278,650.469,774,671.847,894,062,059,296 years.  This 4.6 billion world is too large to say that there were only 1,274,902,296 days in one year, but the number is more or less correct.\nInput: Tessa spent 95% of her time studying and 5% of her time watching cat videos on YouTube.

Unfortunately, family meals are also a major source of conflicts. Family meals are stressful, not just for adults, but also for children. According to a large study of 13,522 children followed from age 4 to age 15 by a team of researchers from University of Minnesota, UCLA, and the National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development in Maryland, children with less \"family meality\" -- time spent talking and eating together -- are more likely to display behavior problems and also have poorer self-esteem. The more time spent arguing about behavior during meals, the more likely the child is to have behavior problems and poor self-esteem.\n\nIn the study, researchers found that \"the most robust predictors of children's behavior problems are parental psychological distress, parental marital status, parental involvement and, parenting practices, parental education and socioeconomic status, and family meal frequency and quality.\"\n\nChildren with better family meals eat better. And their behavior is better, too.\nSo, the better question is, how much of the meal do families leave in the sink?\n\n\nSo the answer is C, but in the original, it should at least be D: better day\n\nInput: A family has 5 children: the sons are named after the four seasons, and the daughter is named after the season after autumn.

Choice B was chosen.\n\nInput: In the first few minutes, the train takes 5 min and 10 seconds to travel 27 miles. During the next few minutes, the train is not moving. Then the train's speed is 53 miles per minute. The train trip takes 3 hours to complete. At what pace does the railroad move after making a stop in the first few minutes?\nOutput: So according to the problem:\nThe train starts with a speed of 53 miles per hour at minute 0. Then it moves at 53 mile-per-minute for two hours from minute 0 to minute 60.\nThen it stops in the last two minutes.\nNow to solve it to the problem: Since the train will stop at the last two minutes, it means that the total time is 2 hours 48 minutes.\nSubtracting 2 from 48, we get\n2 from 48 = <<2*48/2=24>> hours. Then since the train moves at a speed of 5 per hour, it means that the number of miles per hour is 48. Then it means that the train moves at a 48 miles per hours.\nSo it means that the train takes (53 miles/minute)*(48 miles/hour) = 2576 miles.\nSo according to the problem, in the last 48 minutes, it is 2^48/48 = 2 to the next power of 48.

His pet can swim x yards/minute.  Both are tired after swimming for x hours, but the man is more tired than his pet. How many miles did they swim?\nOutput: The man can swim (x yards/hour) * (x hours) = x yards\nHis pet can swim (x/minute) * x minutes = x minutes\nSo the man will swim x * x = x^2 yards\nHis pet will swim x * 60 = x^2 minutes\nPutting everything together, the man will swim (x^2) yards and his pet will swim (x ^2) minutes\nSo the swam (x * 60 * x) = (x^2) + (x^2) = (2*x^2) miles in total\nSo the final answer will be 2*x^2\n\nInput: The difference in two consecutive integers is 6.

If your friend asks you how four-dimensional objects look, can you make an accurate visualization for a stick figure?\nOutput: If someone creates diagrams that they are visualizing with four dimensions, they have to be visualizing only with 3 physical dimensions since they don't bother with what looks real.

{"idx": 828, "text": "The right answer is \"great relief\".\nLet me give you an example (not intended to be sexist). I once heard a woman saying that she often felt better after discussing her problems with other women. This is indeed \"great relief\". She was released from the burden in her heart so that she felt better.\nAnother example is a teacher who patiently teaches children. They will receive \"relief\". They feel better and their work of \"educating\" children becomes easier.\nIn the case of \"redemption\", \"redemption\" is not a form of relief, but a penalty. A person \"forbids\" it with a penalty.\n\"Absolution\" means \"releasing\". If a criminal who has committed a crime asks for \"forgiveness\" and is released, this is \"absolution\".\nThe word \"relief\" in the question can be \"great relief\" which refers to \"a release\".\nSo if you have a \"forgiving attitude\", your \"forgiveness\" is the attitude, but in \"great relief\" the other party feels relief.\nThe reason why (E) was selected is that the answers to the questions are the same as \"release\".\nAlso, if you think \"great release\" can apply, you should also be able to choose an answer.\n\nInput:You take your 40 pound backpack with you where everything you need for a weekend trip.

What percentage increase in video watching time did that user have when accounting for the weekend?\nOutput: I'm not totally sure I understand this question.  This is my best shot.  We need to figure out how much the weekend videos contributed.  We need to account for the fact that the users overall watched more in the current year than the past year.  So if we had the time for the year and the total weekend time, and we figured out the difference, perhaps that would be an indicator.  We also need to make sure account for any 1 day in the past year where they went extra crazy.  If we didn't account for that, we could overestimate.  But at this point, I'm just trying stuff out and I don't think it would be very helpful to provide the reasoning. \nI'm guessing we probably need to make a percentage increase based on the overall amount of time.  I'm not sure about the 20% increase part.  So I could be way off on my approach.  \n\nInput: An apple weighs 0.5304 kg on earth.  How much does it weigh on Jupiter?\nOutput: Jupiter's gravity is about 2.5 x earth gravity.  I'm sure there's a more accurate way of phrasing this, but it seems fairly accurate to me to say an apple weighs about 2.5 times as heavy on Jupiter as it does on earth.  If we scale the weights by 2.5, we will get the same value for when they are on earth and they will both be calculated as 0.131 g.\n\nInput: A bus, driving at 25 miles per hour, needs 1/4 mile of road to stop.

One kg of potatoes costs $1, and one kg of carrots costs $0.80. He paid $12 for the potatoes and $16 for the carrots. How much did he spend in total?\nOutput: Let the weight of the potatoes be p and the weight of the carrots b.\nHis spending on the potatoes is $(p*1)$. And his spending on the carrots is $(b*0.80)$.\nSo his total spending is $(p*1)+\\,(b*0.8)=(p*1)+(b*0.8)$.\nSo the final answer can be arrived at by solving\n$$\\begin{eqnarray*}p+b&=&1\\\\p+1.8b&=&16\\end{eqnarray*}$$\nThe two equations together give $p=\\frac{16-1.8b}{0.8}-b=\\frac{16-\\frac{2*1.8b}{b}}{0.8}-b=b-\\frac{2*0.8b}{b} \\\\ \\text{(b is not zero by assumption and the fraction is well-defined)}\\\\ p=b-\\frac{1*0.8}{b}=b-\\frac{1}{b} \\\\ p=b-1 \\end{eqnarray*}$$So all that needs to be done is to substitute the value of p (which can be read off from one of the equations).\nIt follows that $p=16-2*10=2$.\nSo he spent $24 for carrots and $32 for potatoes.\nSo the final total is $32+24=56$.\n\nInput:Jane worked a job that paid", "answer": "E: hospital"}

How many gallons of paint was used to paint a house?\nOutput:In this problem we are asked to do dimensional analysis.  The first step is to find the dimension of each quantity.  If the units of a quantity are not in its final form, you must divide or multiply the units to find the dimension of the quantity.  We have paint in ounces (or lb) and time in hours.  Both of these quantities have the dimension of time (s).  We also have cost in dollars and use in feet.  Therefore, feet and dollars are not the same units.  We must find the dimension of each cost and time by multiplying or dividing their units.  Cost in this problem has the dimension of dollars ($.  Therefore, cost has the dimension (d = $.  We can multiply by 1 to cancel off the dollars (d) from the cost and put the dimension of time in its final form (dimensiin for time is now (s = s.  Next, we find the dimension of time:  we multiply the dimension for time by itself and divide by one because we want to find units in s,  not pounds (lb = lb/lb and we want the dimension of time (time).  Therefore, the dimension of the cost of time is $/s.   Finally, we multiply the dimension of time (dimensiin (s = s*) with the dimension of use (s * 1 = 1 s), and we get 1 gallon of paint (gallon of paint = gal / 1 gallon (1 gallon of paint = $ / 1 gallon of painting = 1 gallon).\n\nInput: A train is traveling at", "answer": "C: wyoming"}

They can build it using aluminum or wood. How tall does the tower have to be if they use aluminum for 10% of their costs and wood for 80% of their costs?\nOutput: Aluminum is 10% of cost so they have to factor it.\nThe tower has to be height of 1.2 to account for aluminum\nThey can only use wood 80% of the time and then the tower has to be height = 0.8 * height = 0.64 * height = 0..60 * height = 0 * height = 1.2 * height\nThe original problem specified that the tower has to be 1/height * 1.2 = 0.8\nSo the tower has to be.8/height*1.2 =.6666667*height = 56.98% taller than it was before\nSo they can take height / 1.2 = height/1 = 0.8, then 0.8/0.8 = 1, * 1.2/1.2 = 1.2 = the original size\nSo the original problem does not make sense.\nAssuming they used the tower as is, and they use aluminum 10%, The tower has to be height * 10 = height because 10% is 10 *1.2/10 or 1.2/0.1 * 10. So the tower has to be * 1.200 * 10 = * 12.00 = * 1.21. It is 1.21 times taller than it was and the original problem does not require that.\nSo the final tower height is 1.2\n\nInput: Derek owns a small business and makes $27/hour.

{"text": "In order to make more at a certain job, one may often need to find a way to own a house.  By owning a house, one will be able to save money instead of spending it on rent.  The amount of money saved up is able to be spent in a different way.  There are other ways to make more money, but they will not be able to last forever.  The person who wants to make money at their job may be able to make a lot of money by winning a lottery.  This way will only work on rare occasions.  A person will not be able to rely on their lottery prize as a permanent way to make more money at their job.  They may need another way to make money, and the money will probably run out after a while.  A person can feel safe and less stressed at work with a better job, but this will not necessarily result in a raise or an increase of their pay.  For that, one can earn more money by finding ways to save money.  For example, saving money over time will allow someone to purchase things, such as a house, which will lead to making money.  Also, saving money will result in being able to have more room to spend on things which may make them feel more secure in certain circumstances.\n\n### Input :Choose the appropriate letter.

The median income was $305 more than the mean income.\nQuestion: What is the income of a typical American in this population?\nAnswer: $28,182\nInput: According to 1987 data, about 10% of all 10 year olds in the United States could not solve a simple math problem of 1 + 1. However, 75% of children who cannot solve simple multiplication problems at age 10 will have trouble with mathematics in adulthood.\nQuestion: How many 10-year-olds in the United States could solve simple multiplication problems?\nAnswer: 7,000\n\n### Instuction:\nExplain why your answer is correct.\n\n### Response :\nInput; The United States population in 1991 was 330 million. Let's start from there. We're going to round everything off to be one or two decimal places and then get a dollar amount from that. First, the mean income will be $29,798. Next, the mode income will be $27,000. Finally, the median income is $28,141. Now round out 28,140 to two decimal places and get 28.14, so to get a dollar amount, multiply the rounded number of two decimal places by 100, which will give you an answer of $2,814. Add all 3 numbers together and get 29,992. Which is almost $22,000 above the median income. Because they say median is 305 more than mean, (305+100=$405) add the 405 to $29,771 and get $30,176.

{"text": "A: sign language\n\n### Instructions:Answer this open ended question.\n\n## Solution:1. Instruction:This task asks us to solve simple arithmetics, so we need to first understand that we need to write our answer in the range of 60000 to 100000. 2. Demonstration:We can use the number 1000 to do our calculations. We know that 4 hours of work will give us 40. So we can use 40hours equal to 44 minutes. 3. Solution:The question asks us to calculate the number of minutes 600. We know that 600hours are the same as 600*24 hours/60=60000 minutes. But 720 minutes equal to 1 hour, so we conclude that 600 minutes equals 600*30=18000 minutes. 4. Instruction:This question asks us to write a complete sentence, so we can write the answer \"Michael makes birdhouses to make money at craft shows. He makes birdhouses out of wood/plastic.\" 5. Response:D: Because we know that feeling angry or making tea are things to do after someone has been insulted or said bad things to you. 6. Instruction: This task asks us to create a list. 7.

They left right after the doors opened at 7:30 p.m. The concert started at 8 p.m. and Brad and his son left at 9:45 p.m.\n\nHow long did Brad wait for the concert to start?\n\n### Response\nAnswers: \n\n- Expect all your students to answer 1 minute.\n\n### Solution:\nIn this question it's implied that the concert started at 8pm. After that, when the concert ended it's been stated that Brad and his son left the concert at 9:46pm. Let's take these two pieces of information and see how we could use them to solve the question.\n\n8 hours = 480 minutes=9. \n\nSo, we can conclude that, the total time passed in the concert is 2070 minutes. Now, the concert started at 7:35pm. So, there is only left 25 minutes to go. So, the question is basically asking how much time Brad and his son waited before the concert started. \n\nSo the total time they waited is 2260-25 =2235 minutes.\n\n### Exercise 2\n\n### Insturction:\nCathy and Amy went on a road trip together.\n\nCathy drove from 6:00 a.m. until 3:00 p.m. Amy drove from 3:00 to noon, after that they arrived at 2:06 p.m. How long did Cathy take to drive?\n\n### Solution\nIt's obvious that we're talking about 2 different pieces of time. First, that Cathy drove from 06:00 to 3:00 for the whole day. And Amy drove just an hour. The question is basically asking how many hours did Amy drive.

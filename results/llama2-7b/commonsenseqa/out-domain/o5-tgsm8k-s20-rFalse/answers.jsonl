Use the 'import math' statement at the top of your code to import mathematical functions like'math.pi' or'math.sqrt(x)'. This line tells that you would like to use these particular functions. After this, the code is very simple in fact, you just add two more numbers in two separate variables and apply the 'x // y' syntax to the result of these variables, which results in a float number. Also remember that '//' is read as 'divide' statement which divides a first number by another number, while '//' is read normally with no specific meaning if you leave it on its own as 'divide' will divides a second number by a third.", "answer": "B: finger"}

Blue is a color in the spectrum of visible light. Red, orange, yellow, and purple are other colors in this spectrum. Light has wavelengths. Wavelength is the distance between corresponding points on two waves, such as crests or troughs. Wavelengths are expressed in units of length called nanometers (nm). The wavelengths of visible light range from roughly 400 to 700 nanometers. The wavelengths and color of light are related to each other. For example, blue light typically has a higher wavelength, which means it has a shorter wavelength, than violet light, and has a shorter wavelenght than red. Yellow light has a wavelength between violet and green, and green light has the smallest wavelength in the visible light spectrum. White light is made up of all the visible colors. White light reflects or passes through objects, depending on the light. Because white light contains all visible colors, an object that reflects or scatters all visible colors is called white", "answer": "B: have sex"}

If this is your first time running this, please just click **Load Dataset** button below and it will load dataset for you. After that, you will see one button named **Run**, click on it to run your train data on the decision tree. After click run, you will see the output as shown below.\n\n![](https://github.com/HongShuangChen1412/HongShuongChen1411/blob/master/papers/decision_tree/picture2.png)\n\n2. **Part 2 & Part 3**: You want to apply the same decision tree learning algorithm which you trained to a new data. The inputs to the decision tree is the same, but the decision tree's tree structure will be different. Here is a link to a training data you can use for practice:\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/datasets/master/hkus-hwi-1411/train.csv\n\nYou can try Part 2 & Part 4 with other datasets as well, e.g., MNIST dataset.\n\n3. **Part 2**: Please click on **Create Dataset** as shown below and upload your own uploaded to the decision tree function.\n\n![](papers/decision tree/picture3.png)\n\n4. Once uploaded, click on the first **Upload** button on the far right to choose the dataset.\n\nOnce uploaded, you will get two options, **Train** and **Test**. If you choose **Train**, the dataset will be use for training you decision tree. If you choose **Test**, the dataset will get the output from the decision tree.\n\n5. For the decision tree example below, the output was 238. Which means, it predicts it is a POSITION since 217 is the highest value of a POSITION (33).\n\n---\n![](papers//decision tree/picture5.png)\n\n[Click here to go back to the previous page](https://github.blog/?utm_source", "answer": "D: knowledge of music"}

They can not decide which train to travel on because their houses are half way or more to the railway station and 4km away from each other.  If the shorter line travels half way to the railway station, the passengers will be late because the shorter line takes more time then the longer line. The line which takes more time takes less than 4 km to travel to the railway so the passengers can be on time. So, they decide that the shorter line travels to the railway station and the longer line returns to their own houses.  Can you tell the passengers correctly which train is the right train for them if you have a map of the railway which shows their houses and the places they want to go?\nOutput: Answer:(M=6, L=0) The M train travels to the right and returns to the left. The L train travels to the left and returns to the right. From the map, the M train is the longer. The passengers can't see the map, so they decide to ride the shorter train, which is the M train, and then the L train to get back.\n\n\nInput: It is possible to make 18 with two dice.

The data set comes from a real-world dataset that is freely available from the National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect (NDACAN). The dataset you can use is [NCACHE06](https://ndacan.cspc.unc.edu/dataset-ncache06.php). This dataset consists of 300,000 child protection reports from California and North Carolina. The dataset is freely available online in the downloads section of the dataset page.\n\nThe task is to develop code which predicts the number of subsequent child welfare cases for children who are found \"high needs\" by a social worker at intake and who move from a \"high needs\" to a \"low needs\" classification. In English, this means that we will compare how often children who go to a \"high needs\" classification end up in a \"low needs\" category in later files with those who start as \"low needs\". We will need to determine what constitutes a \"high needs\" or \"low needs\" in this case.\n\nFor the purpose of the challenge, we have simplified the definition of \"high needs\" children as those who have five or more of 10 specified risk factors present at intake, and \"low needs\" as those who have 0-4 risk factors. These two classifications (high needs and low needs) are arbitrary and needlessly complicated. You should feel very free to change this definition to \"high needs\" and \"low needs\" in the code. The code will work for your definition, however you should be prepared to explain why this classification of children has the definition it does. In other words, your code should be able to be read by an independent person and explained how it works.\n\nThe questions will pertain to the data set listed above. You should run your script against data that you have loaded from the downloads links and make sure it works with it.\n\n**Instructions**:  \nYour script must answer the following questions.", "answer": "B: sea world"}

Choices: 10:05 am 10:00 am 9:25 am 9:45 am 9:15 am<n>Output: 1o:05am<n><n>## Solution:<n><n>The first one is quite easy. The total amount of candys are `(66 - 29) +29 = 95`. The core of the problem is the first 8 and the last 29. So I think when they were doing the multiplication I saw they used `(66 - 8) - (29 + 8)` which is equivalent to<n>`(57 - 16 -16) = ((57 - 15) +1)` since there is a (-) on the two subtract operations. If you see that we are left with `65` which doesn't fit in the 29. So this is where we need to add the 29 together for it to be 95.<n><n>The second one I had to think it through a bit more but I got it eventually. We know for sure that we had to be a min and b max, so max was 1, and the min can be `floor(38/2)` which gives `6+6+6+6` which is 22. And then we divide those 22 into `45 + 31 = 76` and we get 3.45.<n><n>The third one is where we take the difference of the largest and smallest we use `floor((136-130)/2)` to get 2. Then we divide those 2 into `155+136=291` which `3.80`<n><n>The 4th one I am not sure if I did exactly right but it should be ok. We need a min of `floor((800 - 66)/2) = 299.5` and `max of floor(940 - 66/2) = 255`. And then divide those into `600 + 600 = 1200`.<n>

In this section, you will learn how to write a program with IF-THEN-ELSE statements.<n><n>How an IF-THEN- else condition can be used in a program. IF-THEN- ELSE statements allow a programming language to respond to the conditions that we have already learned about. With an IF statement, the computer only does a single action or command based on a condition.<n>However, we know that in many real-world situations, the computer is expected to do more than one thing. That is what IF-THEN- ELSE statements are designed to do — provide multiple actions based on a single condition. With an IF-THEN ELSE IF-THEN block, the computer will execute more than one instruction based on a condition.In a game where players can be humans or aliens, if a player who is a human lands on the first corner of the board, the computer should take the following actions.<n><n><n><n>Input: IF Tapanga lands on corner 1, THEN print corner 1 and move her token to corner 3.

Choices:  A: sun himself B: thank god C: race against time D: express love E: to think about things.<n>Output:		D, A<n><n>### Solution:<n>This is how I think about it<n><n>First we know the number of candies that Tapanga has. It's 27(66-29=27 because we subtract 29 from 66 to find out how many left) and we can find out Corey have by subtracting 8-7 and that equals 1.<n><n>Second the first question we know about local call is 0.05 and the international call is 0.25.  Now let's look at the second part of the question. First let's say Freddy called 2 times during his phone call then we can do the following. It's 5(a+b) and it is 25(a) so it's pretty simple to solve this one and find the answer.<n><n>Third how many hours did Lawrence work each day? The answer is 5(a+t). Now let's solve if Lawrence worked the same number of numbers of hours each day. Well 5 is the number of hours per day then we can solve this by dividing 5 into each of number of hours each day.<n><n>Fourth how many book were not sold? 800 is the total number of books and let's say we take off of those books that Michael made this week. So it's 800-(a+i) then we do the following the answer is 800-777 and we have the answer now.<n><n>Now for the rest of the question, the person A,B,C,D,E could have a lot of reasons for this so you need to think for it. <n>A: sun himself - We don't know about the position of him so it could be him sun himself on the beach or he could be somewhere else.<n>B: thank god - This one is really simple, he could be praying or thanking God.<n>C: race against time - This can be a lot of people since we don't really know why he's staying on the beach.<n>D: express love - He could be expressing something but he's staying by the beach so it could also be for fun<n>E: to think about things - It could be anything that you could think of it could be for you just wanna think, to take a nap

(Something has been examined.) You would use examine when you use it as a transitive verb. An excellent way to understand if a verb is transitive or intransitive is to identify the direct object. If you find a verb in a sentence and it has a direct object (subject + V + V2), the verb in that case is intransitive. For example, to answer the question above, A is an appropriate choice because Examine=look closely at something in examination, there are 4 questions and it's an appropriate answer.<n>

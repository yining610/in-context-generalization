If you would not use the back entrance, then there are FOUR entrances you can use: <<1=current>>, <<2=front>>, <<3=side>>, and <<4=main>>. Since you can use those 4 entrances to the front of the building without using the back entrance,\nthe other entrances are the back entrance. <<5=main>> is not an entrance because it is on the other side of an outside tree.\n<<6=side>> is not an entrance either, because it is facing the building, not the tree. Thus, only <<1=current>> and <<2=front>> are entrances. You can use <<2=front>> to get to <<1=current>>. So the only two entrances to use are <<1=current>> or <<2=front>>. <<1=current>> leads back to the other side of the tree, so <<2=front>> is the only entrance to use when coming from outside the building. <<2=front>> also faces the building, so the back entrance can be ignored when coming from the front of the building.\nSince you said you did not want to use the <back entrance,\nthe entrance labelled <<10=back>> is not an entrance to the front of the house. <<11=side>> is not\nan entrance because you can use the other outside entrances when coming from the back of the house. <<A+B+C+D+E>> is always true if all", "answer": "B: main"}

All the pairs that she buys are sold at a loss. What is the percent of loss?\\\nOutput:We need to calculate the percent of loss by finding the number of pairs that were bought and lost by subtracting from the number that were sold.\nSince all the pairs were bought at a loss, loss = bought - sold.\nWe know that 11 pairs were bought, but no pairs were sold, so loss = 11 - (0) = 11 bought - sold\nSimilarly, the number that was sold was 8 pairs. So lost = 11 - 8\nTherefore, loss = (11 - 8) * 100 = (11 -8 ) *100 = (3 - 8 )*100= - 50 lost lost in 50.\nSo the percent lost is -50/11 = -45 lost in 50\nSo the final answer here is a negative 45 percent loss\n\nInput:A restaurant serves hamburgers with the following prces\\\nOutput:Prices of hamburgers", "answer": "E: horrible"}

What can we say about the depth of the water?\nOutput: This is a height-based problem. We know that the rate of filling is 80 liters per hour. Since we know that the water falls from a container above, the water fills the trough in a cone shape, where the radius is r. We can find the radius r using this equation: V1 = pi * r^2 * 80, where V1 is the volume of the tube inside the radius r, and 80 is the rate of filling.\nChoosing the equation for the volume: V1 = pi*r^2*h, where pi is 3.14159, and r is 120cm, we can find the volume V1 to be:\n(3.141 * 120^2) * 80 = 16657200.\nNow we have the volume V1, we can find the time it takes for the water to fill the trough. This is where we use the formula used for rate of filling, that is 80 litres/hour. So the rate for the time is 80 / 1665.73 = 0.05 hours.\nSo if the depth is the volume of the water V1, we can divide the volume of the water by the rate of filling to get the time taken to fill the water.

Once you do this, divide the total amount each hour by 60. The result is the rate at which the water is used per hour in cubic meters. (5hrs * 6m= <<5hrs*6=30>>30).\n5 * 30 = <<5*30=150>>150 liters / hour\nConverting to meters (m3/hr):\n150 / 60 = <<150/60=2.5>>2.5\nSo the woman is watering the garden at 2.5/minute.\nSo the final Answer is 2.5\n\nInput: A bag contains marbles.

The algorithm itself appears to have no logical flow and is just guessing. The algorithm should not attempt to solve if there are insufficient inputs (e.g., if it fails after 2 questions). Also, it should only attempt to solve after giving all of the inputs (e.g. attempt to solve 2 times using 15, and then move on). It also seems to require 2 questions instead of 3 (e.g. doesn't attempt to solve question 3 if fails 2 times after 2 questions). In the end it gives no explanation as to why it failed if it does.\n\nComment: OK, now that I see the full code, it is a bit clearer what is going on. I assume that the point of the code is that the solution for the puzzle is to calculate the number \"x\" in the expression (e.g., how many x's are in the equation), correct?

What fraction of the pond's water is left. Choices: A:0.84 B:0.75 C:0.66\nOutput: The question uses this format but is worded very wrong. The question was formatted as 9,458 gallons of water in the pond. So if you multiply 9,450 by 1/4 you get 2,113 which is half of 9450 and half of 9460 is 2113.

How do I know my total sum of money?\nOutput: We know that we are trying to solve an open-ended question for which we know the beginning values and equation. The total sum of money must be an even number since we have an even number of both pennies and nickles. We have an uneven amount but we know pennies and nickels will not change so we need to add together quarters to get an even amount which will increase our total sum of money. I have one question in which I do not have an answer (in this case d) and so we assume the unknown value is D.

Corey was not in front of Tapanga, so they should add 4+1 = 5 together.\nIt is easier to look at what Corey has in his hand. The numbers add up to be 29, which is the same as if Tapanga had 8 more candies. Corey has 28 + 8 = 36, then + 1 gives 37. You need to divide both sides by 2 and 29 is the answer.\n\nThe second example is about time and money. Freddy is on a 25 cent international call with his brother, to call it 1 dollar per minute. Freddy would have to spend 128 dollars to call his family on New Year\u2019s Eve. Freddy spent 125 dollars to call his father on 45 cents per minute, then 100 dollars for 5 cents per minute to call his brother. Freddy spent 26 dollars on the international call and 25 dollars on the local call, totaling 51 cents per minute, so Freddy spent 111 dollars.\n\nThe third example is about time and minutes. You need to add up the minutes between Wednesday and Thurdsay, and then subtract the day that Lawrence worked more from the day that he worked less.

Use the information below to answer the question.\n\nA box contains 36 bullets and you want to choose a multiple of the number that is at least greater than 36\nWhich of the following choices will help you choose the bullets? Choices: A: Every multiple of 2 that is greater than 36 B: All the numbers between 44 and 87 C: All negative numbers D: All multiples of 7 greater than 36 E: Any multiple of 6\n\n### Answer\n\nThere are a lot of ways we could answer this question. When we first read it, it seems like maybe the box contains 42 bullets and that we\u2019re subtracting a multiple of 2 from that total.\n\nThere is a better answer.\n\nWe can see that for every multiple of two above 36, we subtract two from the total. We subtract two from 36 because adding two to 36 will be more than 36, and since every multiple is larger than the last, we know no multiple can be more than 38 because 38 is more than 36.\n\nSo we have to subtract an even number: 40 - 36 = 4. Then once we subtracted 4 from the box, and subtracted that number, we have 32 more available than we started with.\n\nThe second option to answer this was to start at a multiple of 36 and subtract from it to find the number of bullets remaining.\n\nAnother possibility might have been to start at 36 and add multiples until you found that same number of remaining bullets, but that\u2019s not the way I\u2019d do it and the others in this book probably wouldn\u2019t either.\n\nSo that\u2019s my answer to this question.", "answer": "E: celebrating"}

How many square feet of garden can be used for a flower garden?\nOutput: We first determine how many square feet the path takes up.

Area of garden - area of path = <<Area-path>>25-125 = <<25-124=11>>10 11 square feet of garden and there are 5 of them.\nSo altogether there are 5 11 2 = <<5*11*2=55>>55 square feet of garden, so the garden can be used for flowers.\nSo the final is answer 55\n\nInput: A 24 yard swim pool is placed in a corner of the rectangle.

{"idx": 576, "text": "This question refers to the game of Blackjack and specifically to the rule against counting cards.\nThe dealer deals two cards face up to each player, face down to dealers, and then faces both cards.\nIf the cards that the player was dealt are \"face cards\" (king, jack, queen, or 10), the player can add 10 to his hand.\nIf the player was dealt an ace, the player can either add 1 to his hand or wait to see if it's dealt another card.\nAn initial hand of face or ace cards has an advantage over a dealer's hand and is considered a favourable hand.\nOnce the hand is dealt, it is scored by comparing the player's and the dealer's cards, including any face cards.\nIf the player has 9, 10 or ace, the player loses (and vice-versa for the dealer).\nIf the player's first two cards total 21, the player wins; however, if the player's three face cards equal 21 (like, king-queen-queen-ace), the dealer wins.\nPlayers can win by hitting (taking another card), standing, or splitting.\nThe player is always better off if the dealer busts (goes over 21).\nWhen the dealer bust, he reveals his hand, so the dealer will most likely never be dealt two face cards.\nBecause the cards are dealt one at a time, counting the cards would require the player to memorize the cards he's dealt to know when an ace was dealt or to recognize any face card that was dealt.\nWhen he sees a pattern, he can tell in advance what card is going to be dealt and he may have an advantage when his card would add 10 to an already favourable hand. So counting cards is illegal. Above is based on Blackjack rules in Las Vegas. This rule may be different for other casinos, however. (I searched around online and found that the rule is also the same at the Tropicana online casino, but it can vary in other casinos.)\nThe final answer is counting cards", "answer": "C: count"}

If your answer is 14, then you are right for wrong reasons.  You added the two numbers, but 20 is not either 10 nor 2. If your addition is incorrect, then you are right because 20 is not a single-digit number.\nIf you divide each integer by 12, then 10 and 20 will each come out as 0. However, 4 divided by 12 is 0.48, while 4 divided by 2 is 2.\nSo 10 divided by 3 is 10/3 = 10/3\nIf you were not careful about the answer, then you may divide 10 by 20, but 20 divided by 3 becomes 4.\nSo the final correct answer is D\n\nInput: Your friend makes a sandwich.

What was the overall % change in sales for August?\nOutput: What we need to do at this point is to isolate the \"change\" number, from the other percentages.\nFor the first section (30% increase in August), we multiply 30% by the amount sold. In this case that is.30 = <<30=9>>9\nIn the second section, (20% decrease in August), we have to have.2, but we also need to subtract 9 from.2, to get.2 - 9 =.3 and we see this as being 30/100 of what it was last year =.3.\nMultiply that by the amount earned. If August sales were 2,000, then 1,000.3 = <<.3*1000=30>> 30 dollars.\nIn the third section (10% increase in August sales on Mon. the 9th), we want to take 10%, but we again want to subtract 9 (the first section of percentage) so we end up with.1 -.9 =.1\nAnd.1*1,000 = <<.1*1000+1000>> = +100 = 2,100 dollars.\nNow we add on the first section (.9 of 2,009 dollars),", "answer": "A: bookstore"}

A Venn diagram can be used to help us understand the different numbers involved and can visually show how the answers change as we change our criteria. A Venn diagram is a diagram that is used to represent the different ways in which you can pick elements out of one group. In this case, we will be using it to see how many ways there are in a class to fill in the seat with a boy student.\n\n#### Step #3\nTo further explain step #1, we used a question that gave us the total number of students in a class and the question also stated that the class has a total of 4 seats, and we need to find if out how we can fill them. After filling out the diagram, we used 16 to calculate the total number of different ways that we can fill up all boys in the classroom. To do that, we took all areas that are common to all other cases. First, all the boys are in the inner circle, or A, and we have 16 boys and that adds to 16 or the total number of ways we can find seats for the boys. Second, if we picked a student from inside the circle of the boys, instead of from the circle, there are 4 different ways that the student can be replaced, each of which has 3 possibilities or 3*3*3*3 or 81. Third, if we do not want the student to replace another student, there is only 1 option, and that is the student must choose the outer circle, or D, and as we said, D contains 8 different ways to pick a student. Therefore, there will be 16+81, or 97.\n\n#### Step#4 and Step#6\nIn step 4 and in step 6, we will talk specifically about step-by-step solution to the question.\n-Step#4: The students are in rows of different sizes, and each row is lined up to form the outer circle.\n-Step#6: The students are in a", "answer": "B: animal shelter"}

If it takes 5 hours per 750 copies, how long can Mary work before beginning to make her copies incorrectly?\nOutput: If the efficiency rate is 60% on day-1 and the expected work completed per day is 5*750 = <<5*750=3750>>3750, then a total of 3750/60 = <<3750/50=75>>75 extra copies would be made per day, so if Mary spends the day making copies, she will have 4250 copies made per day and a work rate of 3600/72 = <<3600/45=80>>80% over the minimum requirement. \nTo do 80 % of 5.5 hours per 720 = <<5.5/2>5 hours, Mary will have to complete the copy work with 90 minute breaks to allow time for eating. Since she will spend 4250 / 90 = <<4250/90=47>>47 hours a week making copies, she could continue working at this rate until the next Monday unless she experiences burn-out on Friday. Mary will work for <<47=47>>46 weekdays, but not all days will need 46 weekday hours of work to complete them. A 50% efficiency level means that Mary will have to spend 47/2 = <<47/2=23>>23 hours completing 24 hours worth of work so she will break down for some sleep to do some errands or prepare food. \nThus Mary could keep going until 26 May (Monday). This is because Monday is a bank holiday, so banks will be closed.", "answer": "A: tie shoelace"}

If the ship used 550 liters of water on the sixth day, how many liters of water does it use on the last day of the week?\nOutput:95 (a)\n90 (b)\n15 (c)\n16 (d)\n52 (e)\nThe first choice is a, because a ship uses more water on the first day and decreases on the days after that.\nThe next choice is b, the ship uses water as usual on the first day and the second day. Then the third day the ship decreases. So, the ship uses more on the first day than subsequent days.\nThe third choice is c, because on the sixth day, the ship used water but not on the seventh day. Then, I would say that it uses more or less on the first day.\nThe fourth choice is d, the ship uses more water on subsequent days but on the fifth day the ship decreases so that it uses more on the sixth day but on the seventh day the ship goes even more.\nThe last choice is e, the ship uses more or less on each day. We conclude that the ship uses the same amount of water throughout the week.", "answer": "A: airplane"}

Therefore the sentence can be rephrased as, \u201c29 men are necessary to have one horse in every state\u201d.\nIn order to determine which answer would be \u201c2\u201d we must look at the options of 1, 2, A, B, C, 3, and D.\n1:29 clearly indicates \u201cman\u201d as the 1 and \u201cstate\u201d as the 29, which does not match the sentence. However, D does. D indicates man or men, so this means there are both a man and women. Since one horse is shared between \u201c1:29\u201d with the man and \u201c2:7\u201d with the women, one horse is shared between two people, but there are two people sharing the horse. Hence, there are 2 people to a horse, so the answer would be 2:7.\nA: 2 also does. A clearly indicates a man, and 2 indicates how much \u201c2 horses are necessary to have one in every state.\u201d Again, the options are clearly not enough people, since \u201c29 man\u201d are necessary for one horse in every state.

How long did Tapanga walk from her house to her friends house along the straightest route she could find? This question is related to Tapanaga and Coreys situation only if Tapanga and Corea walk straight from each other's houses. What statement best describes Tapanga and Coreas situation?\nOutput: Tapanga and her friend Corey live in different houses and they each have 66 candiess. Tapanga has 10 more candies than Corea and Tapanga had 8 more candyes yesterday.\n\nOutput: Since the candies are counted with an equation, we know that the question is asking how much Tapanga walked in the straightest path. Since the question has an absolute value sign, we know that the answer is positive. Therefore, we want an equation that involves Tapanga, which indicates she walked from one house to the other house.\n\nOutput: The only way that Tapanga and her friends lives in different houses and Tapanga walks from her house to her friend's house is if she and her friend live on opposite sides of the street and Tapanga has to cross the street at the end of this walk.\n\nOutput: If the answer choices are not the answer to the entire problem, we know that the problem describes one part of a larger problem. The first answer choice doesn't describe the specific details that are given in the problem or describe Tapanga and Core\u2019s situation. The second answer choice describes Tapanga and Cora\u2019s situation, but doesn't describe Tapanga and Cory\u2019s situation.\n\nOutput: One way to describe two different things in an equation is to add the things you are describing and subtract the things you are describing. Since Tapanga has 66 candies and is thinking about the least amount of candies she can carry to Corey\u2019s house, she needs to subtract 8 candies (which equalled 10 candies) and add 10 candies.

The second letter is double the number of letters in that number. The third letter is four times the number of letters in number. For example, A has one letter. A, the first letter of A, has one letter. The second letter of A is A, as it has 2 letters, and the third letter of A is AA, as it has 4 letters. The same rules continue. AA has a total of 6 letters, 2+4+6=12 letters in all. If we apply this rule to 341, the letters of the word, and use each set of letters, the solution is 3 41.\nOutput: We have 3 letters, the first, the second, and the third, which are A, B, and C.\nA is one letter, which is the same for AAA, as it contains one letter, just like A.\nSince B has 2 letters, it has to be BBB.\nC is four letters, which is the same as CCCC, because there are four letters.\n341 contains a total of three letters, two, one, and four, which are A, AA, BBB, and CCCC, respectively.\nUsing each set of letters, we find that 3 =<<3=3>>3 letters, 41 = <<41=41>>41 letters, and adding them together, we get 3 + 41 = <<3+41=44>>4 letters.\nSo the final solution is 341 = <<341=44 >>4\n\nInput:Which is better, 12 or 21? 12 > 21\nOutput: We can represent this inequality with the letter B, which means \u201cbetter", "answer": "C: hock"}

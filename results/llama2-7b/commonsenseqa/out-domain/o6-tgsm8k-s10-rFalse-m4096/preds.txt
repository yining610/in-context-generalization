How many days does it take for each of them to wash 5/8 as many dishes?<n><n>## Solution<n>- Solution:<n><n>    1. The time they spend washing dishes can be divided in half to get 360 minutes.<n><n>    2.  If 360 minutes are divided into 1440 of cooking time, the result will be a number less than 360.<n><n>    3. If 360 is added 720, the result has to be 1080.<n><n>    4.

They were able to get three cups of coffee, two of them with cream, one with milk. They spent $8.44 in total. How much did each coffee cost?<n>Output: $3.56<n><n>  <n>#### Explanation:<n><n>First we need to store our data into variables, but because our data is only 3 variables we can also simply put values of 1 through 3 into a array. Secondly we need to set a constant (in this case $12) as a lower bound for the first variable since lower bound can not be negative. The rest of logic is very straightforward.<n><n>Example code:<n>`const const const const BAL = 12; const const const const COST = 8; const const const const D = 2.5;`<n><n>`//BAL lower bound, COST variable and D variable.`<n><n>`//store bought 3 into a array`<n><n>`let cost = []; let pricePls = []; for (i = 0; i < 3; i++){ if(i === 1) cost[i] = 3.5; if(i === 2) pricePls[i] = 46; }`<n><n>`console.log(cost.join(" ")) // $3.5 for store bought 3`;<n><n>`console.table(pricePls)`<n><n>`<n>    [<n>      '1',<n>      '2.5',<n>      '56'<n>    ]<n>`<n><n>Input: James drinks 5 cans of soda + 64 oz of water per day. How many 8 oz fluid servings would drink in a single serving?<n><n>Explanation: The logic is just taking a modulo value and multiplying that with the number variable.<n><n>Example code :<n>`let finalServings = []; for (i=0; i<48; i++ ){ finalServings[i] = (i % 20) * 3.125; }`<n><n><n>`let finalservings; for (i=2; i < 8; i++){ console.log(`<n><n>`let finalServs = []; for (j=0; j<2; j++){ finalServs[j]

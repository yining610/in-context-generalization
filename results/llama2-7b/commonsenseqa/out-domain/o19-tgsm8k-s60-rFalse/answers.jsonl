Finally, desks in classrooms. That's all.\n\nA: art room\n\n### Input/Output Analysis\nIn the classroom, there are pencils, books, chairs with desks and chalkboards. They have 5, 3, 2, and 2, respectively. If you use less than half the number of pencils the students had on a certain day, you have a less than normal class.

{"text": "I have tried an approach to this question.\n\nLet L(X) be the number of letters in an alphabet where X is the lover.\nC(X) be the chance of an alphabet have the number of letters in X.\nA_L(X) = 1/(A*C(X))\nD_L(X)  = 1/(D*C(X))  \nE_L(X)    = 1/(E*C(X)) \nFrom the choices A to E, the only constant in each choice remains the alphabet. So we should do the following:\nThe number of lovers where L = 6 should be A_L(6). From the graph, A_L(6) = 0.16666 which is in fact C(6) \u00d7 1/7(1+7)\nThe sum of the numbers of both A_L  and D_L and E_L for 6 should be 1.4666 which is C(6) \u00d7 (1.0666/4 )\nThe average to a new choice we get for e.g., L = 7 is C(7) \u00d7 ((1.4667 \u2013 1 )/17) or C(7)/17.\nC(7)/17 = 0.0412\nC(8)/25 = 0.032\nC(9)/51 = 0.02 \nC(10)/82 = 0.0135 \n\nSo, from the choices A to E what we are looking for, is the probability of their alphabet to have 6,7,8,9,10 letters 1/17 1/25 1/51 1/82 and 1/547,530,360,648,458,926.

{"text": "```python\nprint (\"A\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nCritical thinking is the process of working within one problem, to generate the most reasonable set of actions to solve the problem. Critical thinking is used on a day to day level and is important to keep a calm mind in working out solutions. This is often done through trial and error in order to reach the best possible answer. There are many jobs that use critical thinking to solve simple problems. They have the ability to reason through problems and solutions and the ability to understand and identify problems, their causes, their consequences, the different ways they can be addressed and alternative solutions. A critical thinker should be able to think logically, be independent, and be persistent in analyzing problems. They should be able to work well in a group. Critical thinking also means they are able to understand the limitations of their knowledge and their own perspectives, as well as those of others in the group. A critical thinker must not jump to conclusions, but be curious. And also, they should be independent in seeking and evaluating their own information and perspectives, before coming to conclusions. It involves problem solving, evaluating evidence, identifying alternative solutions, and understanding the relevance of the issue.\n\n### Input/Explanation:\nThe correct answer is A. An equal opportunity is when an employer has an obligation to consider all suitable candidates without regard for their race, religion, gender, or age. An equal opportunity employer is one who hires people based on their merits and skills regardless of their background. The law also protects against illegal discrimination in hiring. A fair process means job ads are honest and fair to all who want to be a candidate, that the selection process is fair to all candidates who qualify, and that the selection isn\u2019t limited to only a candidate of a specific gender. Equal Opportunity Employers are obliged to offer the same fair treatment to all candidates.\n\n### Exemplar:An employer who provides an equal opportunity to all employees is one who gives fair treatment to all their employees in terms of wages, bonuses and so on.\n\n### Extension/Explanation:Because the employer makes a good effort to recruit all employees for a particular job regardless of anything other than merit, an equal opportunity employer is known to use recruitment techniques that provide", "answer": "C: equal opportunity"}

{"text": "B\n\n>**What is the result of institucation civil action?**\n\nThis question is asking how the results of initiating civil action. Choices A and E mean that it will cause bad feelings, confusion, going to court, or hurt feelings, respectively. Choices B and D mean that the result would be just like going to court with the hurt or bad feelings associated with it. It is obvious from the question itself that you are supposed to choose choice B; confusion. The two choices are basically two extremes of the same effect, confusion. \n\n### Input; How is the result of civil action a confusing one? Choices: A: you are unsure of the law B: multiple court appearances C: being sued D: you don't have a lawyer E: all of the above.\n\n### Response; E\n\n>**How is the result of initiating civil action a confusing one??**\n\nThis question aims to test how confusion and the result of institutin civil action is. Again, choices A and D mean that you are unsure of which law to follow or which way to proceed. You won't have a lawyer, hence, you are on your own. Choices B and C mean that you will probably have to present yourself in front of the court to defend your case, and you might have to sue people in the process. And, as I stated earlier, all the answers in this question are a sort of an extreme of each other.

I chose A because I can infer from the clues that I can use the word \u201cfullness\u201d to replace the word \u201cpile of\u201d in the sentence. Another choice that can also potentially be used would be D as the sentence \u201cIt\u2019s been a bad day so far, he\u2019s had bad breath\u201d and that\u2019s what we are doing, we are choosing something that is bad, so we choose D for bad day?

Now of course, that is not the correct answer as my answer is fullness and not underwear, but I could see how someone would just throw that sentence out there.

This answers with the correct meaning of the answer choices.\n\n### Input\n\nIn the United States, Sam has 11 times as many dollars as Nick. His brother Daniel owns twice as many dollars as both Sam and Nick together. If Daniel has 667 dollars, how many dollas does Sam have?\n\n### Response\n\nThe answer choices are: B, C, E.\n\n- Choice B is the correct answer. There are 600 dollars in Nick, and then there are 11 x 600, which is 6600.\n- Choice C is incorrect because Sam has 11 more money than Nick and Daniel. The question is, what is each person's worth in cash if Daniel has 660? It is clear that Sam has 11 x 137.\n- Choice D is incorrect.\n- Choice E is also incorrect, which is why Daniel does have 667 when Sam has 1137.\n\n### Explanation\n\nYou have to take Sam's amount and divide it by 2 because Sam's money is just double that of Daniel's. Then I multiply Daniel by 10, because you need to take the dollars as a decimal to get your dollar's total. Finally, you multiply the amount of 660 by the decimal in order to get the total amount of 4210, which is the answer. I chose to try to get to 4210 dollars instead of using 600 because I thought it was a good starting point. It works just as well to not work directly with the cash.\n\n### Reversa\n\nAnother way to do this is for the dollar's value to be equivalent to 4 units of anything. Then choose the option that would make the number of units as many as each other. Choices B, C, D, C, E are all true because the cash value of each of these people can be added up to equal each other, according", "answer": "D: sadness"}

{"text": "Choice E. Society cannot exist in what sort of spaces.\n\n### Validation: This response is correct based on the given data and instructions.\n\n### Response Reasoning:\n- This response is correct based the given data and the instructions.\n\n## Input:Pete wants to build a house for his family so they can live together. Pete knows that to build the house, he needs to build enough space that would include the kitchen, living room furniture, and two bedrooms. The square footage for constructing the house varies based on factors that he is given for each space. Pete figures out how much area each room needs. Pete's house will be a two story building, so the basement and the second floor will also be included in the house's space.\n\n- For each room, the square footage for the kitchen is 6 times the square footage for living room.  \n- The square footage for each bedroom is the square footage for a living room. So, the basement has the square footage of three bedrooms.\n- The square footages for the kitchen and the living room are the same, because the living room has the same square footage as the kitchen.\n- Because the square footage of the living room, the square footages to construct each room is the same, so Pete can use that space that is for the kitchen and the live, because they're the same.\n- The rooms are different, but Pete needs to fill up the room for the two bedrooms.\n- Pete subtracts the square footage of half of the kitchen and multiplies it by 2 and has 650 square feet.  So the living room will be filled with the square footage 6 times the kitchen space.\n-  So what Pete does is that he takes all the numbers together and then divides it by 2.\n  So the kitchen and the basement is 900. And the square footage for one living room is double the square footage from the kitchen, plus the square footage of 3 bedrooms.\n  So the living room is 2550. And the basement square footages for the four rooms is 850.\n\n### Rationale: Pete wants to build a room for his family so they could live under the same roof.

Inside the while loop, you have the options for the user to choose whether they like to be found at a place of work or not.  If they answer, \"Yes\", then the program stops; but if they answer, \"No,\" then the while loop repeats because there is no way for the loop to know when to stop.

However, if you were to buy a teakettle you would probably buy it to boil water for your morning coffee. \nThe definition of England doesn't say that it's the only country that uses a teakettle (it's a country, therefore it has citizens so they are most likely going to use a teakettle) but it doesn't say which country uses them the most. \nTherefore the correct answer is C because it states that it's usually kept in the kitchen.\n\n>**Hint:** Teakettles are used to boil beverages, in the kitchen.", "answer": "A: cupboard"}

They all ordered burgers and potato wedges. After having lunch, they were all tired so they took a break from all of the rides and headed back to the place where they\u2019re staying. The burgers cost 3.75 and the potato wedges cost 3.00. How much money did the class trip spend on lunch?\nAnswer: 8.75\n\nInput, Demonstration: They\u2019re supposed to meet at that particular stop on a bus for a day trip. They\u2019re not allowed to get off the bus for any reason or leave the bus. They don\u2019t have anything to do while they\u2019re on the bus and they all agree to keep the windows closed. There\u2019s a total of 26 people who are going on the day trip and they all arrive at the stop as scheduled. They get on the bus and all take their seats with enough space to sit comfortably for a long ride. They also took some snacks, water bottles, and portable toilets with them for the day trip so that they don\u2019t have to use the toilets at any of the stops. The bus only has windows on the sides of the door in order for the people on the inside to see what\u2019s going on outside the bus. The bus was scheduled to pick up more people at a particular stop but when it got there, nobody was there. Everyone else boarded the bus one by one and none of the seats were left empty. Nobody else knew where to go after the first stop anymore so the bus just rolled on its scheduled ride. After an hour of no activity on the bus and no one looking out the windows, the driver turns on the radio so that they could listen to whatever stations were playing on their channel. The bus driver just sat there all this time instead of driving. After 2 hours on the bus and still no change in its course, one of the students told the driver to just turn around now that they\u2019ve been to all of the stops. The driver still had an hour to go on his route so he kept the bus rolling. They all got on the bus so that they could make one last attempt to look for something", "answer": "B: have fun"}

Even when they cut the bag half way and only had 16, they could cut it equally 8 bananas per person and that would be 4.44 each.

Your paint costs $50. When you get home you see that 2 gallons of that paint leaks.

Since rivers are filled with water, which is more dense than air, throwing a rock at the surface level will sink.\n\n### Other Solutions\nSolutions:\n* D\n\n\n### Markup \n\nMarkup:\n\nYou're supposed to think about how many ways the question can be interpreted, not just answer \"yes\" or \"no\" without considering the context of the question.\n\nThe way I initially answered this question, I thought of the word \"splash\" as creating any impact above and beyond \"touch\". Thus, all other choices would be correct, except \"touch,\" so I picked \"C\" because the ground had a \"surface.\"\n\nI then thought about how it refers to water, which was pretty clearly meant for my answer to be for \"A\" the mountains.\n\nThough, after that, I thought of the rock actually reaching the water on the water's surface, after traveling through the air, so the ground is still the surface that the rock travels on.\n\n### Comments and Analysis\nComments & Analysis:\n\nI still disagree with this.\n\n\"touch\" is not specifically a verb, but a noun. In other languages (and slangs), it is used as a verb. So I think if you are only selecting a verb to fit the question, I feel it is fine to select \"touch.\" There is no \"no no-no-no nouns\" rule here.\n\nThe definition of no and yes questions is based on the idea that you can never be definitively positive that the information in the question is correct.  You also cannot be definitively incorrect, since you can't answer either of these using any fact you have that is correct.\n\nThough this is in general, and may not apply in all instances.", "answer": "C: bridge"}

{"text": "C\n\nIn this question, we were given a multiple choice question for an example. To start, we can see that each option was given a corresponding multiple choice question. This allowed us to use the answers we found in order to answer the question. For each correct answer we got, we can see that we would add the amount to the number. In the last question, we added 2 to the total amount. From this, we can conclude that for the initial multiple choice question, the amount we had to add to our answer was 4 to get the correct total. We can do this by using our answer to the first exercise: 2 + 2 = 4\n\n### Input :You have a garden. You planted 15 seeds in the morning and then watered. Each seed takes 15 minutes to grow fully. How long will it take to grow the garden from planting seeds until fully grown?\n\n### Response :9 hours\n\nSince plants take 15 minutes to fully grow, we can conclude that 10 plants will take a full 150 minutes to grow fully. With 150 plants, how long would it take to grow the entire garden since you planted 15 new ones? We subtract 150 from that and get our final answer at 1250 minutes, which equates to 21 hours.\n\n### Input. You are building a table. You make the legs 10 centimeters tall by default. You have 150 centimeters of wood that you can use. There are 5 legs to the table. How high can your table legs be?\n\n### Respons. :50 cm\n\nWe know that our table legs are the default height of 10 centimers. We also know that we could make our table legs taller (as long as our wood could support that). Knowing that, we know that we can have 5 logs if we want to make the legs taller. How long each of the logs will be does not matter. We know that our legs need to be 50 cents smaller than it if our table is that big.\n\n###Input.

{"text": "A\nA notebook is not something that is meant to be stored in your back pocket, so the answer is A. \n\n### Instructions:A new superstar athlete has not only gained the admiration of sports fans but also the attention of corporate sponsors. She has been paid by three different corporations, a tire company, a shoe company and a sports equipment company. The sponsorship agreement with the tire company and sports equipment company have ended but her agreement with the shoe company has continued. However, the shoe company is about to end its agreement too. The tire company payed her $24k but only paid her $1 per minute of her endorsement video. The shoe company paid her 5 times less than the tire company but it was $1 per minute longer than the endorsement video of the tire company. The sports equipment company paid her $5k and the video was a little longer than half an hour. How much money did the athlete collect from these three corporations in total?\n\n### Solution:\n(1). Incorrect. The athlete was paid by three companies, but you have only picked out the 2 companies she was currently being endorsed by. \n\n(2). Incorrect. The total sum of $42k is twice the amount that the athlete was paid by the tire company plus 3 times more than the tire company paid. The amount she was paid by the shoe company is half the amount she was paid by tire company.\n\n(3). Correct. The athlete was endorsing 2 products: products from shoe and sports equipment company. The shoe company is currently sponsoring her. Therefore she has 2 companies that currently sponsor her, hence she has not been paid by shoe company for just 5 minutes. \n\n(4). Incorrect. The solution to the question involves the total sum of the money that she has gained, not the duration of the commercial. Hence 24k, divided by 60 does not make sense because it indicates the money she earned per minute.\n\n(5). Incorrect. From the first question, the sum of all her sponsorship was $24k, 3 times more than tire company, but 5 times less than shoes or sports equipment.\n\n### Differences:", "answer": "A: back pocket"}

This is the same thing as saying that we can multiply a number by a quantity in parentheses, then add the result to another set of numbers.\n\n### Division: Division is the inverse mathematical operation of addition. To divide is to determine the number or numbers that, if multiplied by a given number, produce a given product.\n\n### Divide: To divide means to cut a quantity into two or more equal pieces.\n\n### Dividend & Divisor: Divide means that something is cut or divided into two (or more). When we divide two numbers, there are three distinct operations: a numerator (denominator) pair, a divisor, and a decimal quotient. This is often represented by the symbol \":\" or as a quotient.\n\n### Dynamics: Dynamic refers to something that is in action or changes with time. Related to the word dynamic, a dynamometer refers to a device used to measure the force applied in a given amount of time.\n\n### Error: Error means \"mistake or failure\" or (in more formal use) \"factors that tend to give a mistaken or wrong account or judgment.\"\n\n### Example: Example is an illustrative case, point, or instance.\n\n### Exponential & Logarithmic Functions: In mathematics, an exponential function and logarithmic function are functions of a real variable defined by one, or both, of the following equivalent equations, or their graphs.\n\n### Express: In mathematics, a mathematical expression (abbreviated as expr. in computer science) is a combination (concatenation)", "answer": "D: get arrested"}

You should make sure that you do not skip anything related to the question's answer.\n\n### Behavior:\nI had a long argument with Sandra in an online math site about the answer of this question:\n- \tHer response was to argue about whether I should use a comma or not in the middle of this sentence \"What happens to a company when is bankrupt? Choice A: liquidated B C: branch out D E game over.\"\n-\tHer reasons was that if we separated the sentence into 2 sentences, and use a punctuation (comma, period, question mark, exclamation mark, colon, or semicolon) after every 2-3 words of the sentence, it would become more readable.\n\nI replied using her logic. I told her to separate the sentence into 2-3 sentences if she had the time to do the math for me, and used a punctuation after almost every other words in her reply for readability. She did so but failed to answer my question \"what is the best approach when solving a math problem?\"\nShe thought that putting a punctuation before or after every 3 words on the sentence would make the problem more readable. I replied that I do realize the sentence is more readable. However, it doesn't change the fact that using a punctuation after every second word, and before every third word, and even in between makes the sentence confusing.\nIf we were to continue with her method, it would create a whole new problem\n\nI also pointed out the question was too complex for me. Using her logic, the comma should be replaced with a full stop. Or else, replace the entire sentence with 2 sentences instead. I tried doing that for the purpose of saving time. But even then, I was unable to answer the question. I had to use the information I got.\nI asked her to try and answer the question in 2-3 minutes, but it still doesn't change anything. It would still take a long time to find the right answer.

{"text": "C, Christmas Tree\n\n### Explanation: You are tasked with providing the choice that best completes the request. Your answers should be selected from the given choice or choices.\n\n### InputExplanation:\n\nFor the purpose of understanding what the problem statement wants to convey, we can consider the following two sentences that can lead to the two given choices:\n\nA: She did what she always does\nB: She did what she had to do\n\nThe above two sentences may be helpful as the clue for identifying the answer that matches the request.\n\nFor the above two sentences, the given choice \"A: Department store\" would be the answer, as that option indicates that the mother is performing the familiar activity.\n\nIf we think in terms of the meaning of the above two sentences:\n\n\"She did what she always does\" could be interpreted as the sentence \"She had done what she is always doing\" and may mean that she had finished the wrapping just like how she often finished her gift-wrapping tasks in the past.\n\n\"She did want she had to do\" may be understood as \"She did what she needed to do\" and may mean that this time she had done it because it was inevitable. Thus, the intended meaning of the problem statement may lead us to the first choice.\n\nIn both sentences, the word \"department\" could likely be confused with \"department store.\" Hence, the choice \"A: Department Store\" is the only accurate sentence in the problem statement, and choosing that choice will be an appropriate response.\n\nFor the \"InputExplanation\" section, we're giving an explanation of each individual answer. Please feel free to edit this explanation and to provide a better answer if you know one. For the next exercise, you shouldn't be using this answer again.", "answer": "D: christmas tree"}

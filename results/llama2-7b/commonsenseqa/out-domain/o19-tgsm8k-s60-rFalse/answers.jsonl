{"text": "E\n\n\n## Solution\n### Explanation\n\nLet's say that each student has 1 bottles of drinks and that's 2 liters of drinks. We can see that the two bottles are equivalent to a single liter, so we can find the difference between the bottles of each student.\n```\nlet studentOne = 33 * 33, // 252 bottles\n    studentTwo = 33 *33- studentOne, // 242 bottles\n    difference = 231- 252, // 19 = 10\n```\n\nThe difference is 19 liters and we can divide this in every student.\n```\nresult = difference/numberOfStudents\n      33 / 3 = 33 *.1\n       studentOne.1 = 33\n       studentOne.2 = 64\n       studentOne.3 = 94\n       studentOne = 100\n```\n\nSo every student has 100 of their bottles.\n\nAfter this question we need to find out how many students are there. So we can see the pattern is 33. We can use this pattern to find the number\n\n```\nstudentOne.5 = 33\nstudentOne.75 = 33 *2 = 66\nstudentOne.749 = 33 *7 = 231\n```\n\nSo we need 231 bottles of drink for every student.\n\n### Output\n```\nlet student = 'How many bottles of drinks'\n    if questionOne === 211  {\n        console.log('Janet has 9 cards');\n        console.log( student + '.1')\n        answer1++;\n    }\n    if (questionOne === 50) {\n        console.count()\n        console.log(\"Pete walked 5 blocks \" + student + '.2')\n        console.log((50/33).toFixed(1))\n    }\n   .2 = 15\n    console.log('In a classroom'+ student + '.3') \n\n\n```", "answer": "E: pleasure"}

Janitab only has 3 buckets of clean water left, 3/5 of what she usually puts in one bucket. She can't clean up with the water she has, so she must buy 1 and 2/3 more. For every bucket she buys, Janitab will need 1/3 more buckets, but she's already 2/3 of the way through the day. Janitab needs exactly what is the number of water she must buy?\nAnswer: 92\n\n##### Explaination:\n\nAssume every time Janita has to buy a bucket, it was because she collected 1 bucket.\nShe bought 8 buckets and she cleaned 1 bucket each 3 times.\n\nSo, she had to buy 9 buckets in order to clean 3 more (the 1 bucket from each 3 before).\nNow, she has 3 buckets, and buys one bucket every 3rd, which is 1 and 2.\n\nNow, she needs 3 buckets, but she has used 2 out of 3 buckets. This can be explained using the series [3, 1, 1/3, 1/3*,...] which you can replace the fraction 1/3 or 1/21 and subtract the number from what you want.\n\nShe needs to buy 2 buckets.\n\n#### Input: Pete walked 20 blocks from his house to his mom's place.

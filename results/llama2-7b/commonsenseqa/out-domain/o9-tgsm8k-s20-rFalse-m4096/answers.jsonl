{"idx": 539, "text": "E\n\nInstruction: Enter a valid choice and press Enter, then see if you're correct!\n\n### Solution:\n\nIn the first question, Tapangas candies are 29, then 8 more = 10+29 = 39\n\nIn the second question, 5 cents + 25 cents is 30 cents per call, so 30 dollars spent on calls each week.\n\nIn the third question, the number of hours a day would be an average, so this would be equivalent to multiplying 5 by 5 to give you 25 days.\n\nIn the fourth question, multiply the answer to the second question by 4 to give you 160. Then subtract the 160 from the number of sold books, giving you 200.\n\nIn the fifth question, the original amount of money received would be 1960. After each sale, you deduct the 200 from that amount, giving you 365 dollars after all sales.\n\nIn the sixth question, the combined amount is 60, then divide that in half to give 120, then subtract the number of sold books by that number to give you 30.\n\nIn question seven, you add the cups of water in the first box to the cups of water to the first box in the second box, and divide that by 4 to give yourself the result of 25 cups.\n\nIn the eight question, because there are as many as 25 cups of water, the answer must be the same.\n\nInstruction: Answer the following single choice questions.\n\n### Solution\n\nIn the first, 3.95 + 965.99 is 1000.\n\nThe second one has to do with time, so I started with subtracting from 600, making the hours at 600-5 = 595, then divided it by 3 to get the number of hours you would have to work each day to be average.\n\nIn the other questions, you simply have to add the number of birds killed, or the total amount of money made, depending on the question.\n\n### Instruction:Answer the question and press Enter.\n\n### Question:A boy and", "answer": "E: card catalogue"}

Choices: a. 1 pint b. 16 pints<n>Output: 16 pints You get 8 quarts, then divide 8 by 4, since there are 4 quarts in 1 gallon. Then you get a third of 1 gallon, and 1 pint of a gallon. 8 divided by 4 is 2, and 2 is one third of the 4 in a gallon, so 2 divided by 3 is 0.666... (or the remainder is 6), and since we got a remainder of 6, we add that to the number in order to get the number of pints we want. 6 + 1 pt is 7. Then you can multiply 1 by 7 to get 7 pints. <n>

What percentage of her life has she already lived?<n>```<n>The correct answer is 138.<n><n>Because 62% - 62%, we can see that we are missing 38. Divide 38 by 2, that is, 19. <n>Therefore, we are missing 19 percent, or the other way around, multiply by 38 to get the missing value, we get 6%.<n>```<n>The word "STYLE" is misspelled.

What is the percent profit you make by selling your table for that price?<n>```<n>A percent is used to describe a figure of a certain number, but the percent is missing, so we can infer in this case that the percent is missing.<n>The cost of an item is how many numbers in the cost price, therefore:<n>1% / 327 - 5% / 427<n>Therefore, we have 4%, that is:<n>427*0.04

We know that Tapanga has 120 candies and Corey has 44 candies.<n>- Tapanga has 21 more candies than Core.<n>**Tapanga = 120\<n>Core = 21**<n>**Thus; Tapanga – Core = 21** We know now that Tapanga-Core=21, and Core= 44.<n><n>We do the subtraction! **Tapanga – Core =** 21 \<n>We know the substraction, so we just do it!<n>Tapanga - Core=21<n>**Tapanga - Core = 49**<n>**But, it does not give a result; how can Tapanga - Core= 49 be Core? Core cannot decrease, so Core must be equal to, or less than, 29! We can only have 29 because 21 is subtracted from 44.**<n><n><n>**Input#2** : 10<n>**Output#2** : 5<n><n>- Let's put into words. So our Input is two  numbers as Freddy calls his dad and brother in that order.<n>- The cost for Freddy's call to his dad is just 5 cents because both of them are living together.<n>- So the cost per minute is lower for the local call.<n><n>- Let'S check it:<n>> First of all, Freddy is calling his dad, who is in the same place, so Freddy has to pay 5 cents as the per minute for local calls. So, Freddy spent 5 cents per minute here.<n>> But then, Freddy is calling to his bro, which is on the other side of this world, so he is charged for international calls. Freddy is charged per minute since it is an international call, therefore Freddy has to pay for this call at a high price: which is 25 cents per minute.<n><n>**Now, we can write the cost:**<n>Freddy is calling his daddy, who is a local call, so

Then subtract the 160 from the number of sold books, giving you 200.<n><n>In the fifth question, the original amount of money received would be 1960. After each sale, you deduct the 200 from that amount, giving you 365 dollars after all sales.<n><n>In the sixth question, the combined amount is 60, then divide that in half to give 120, then subtract the number of sold books by that number to give you 30.<n><n>In question seven, you add the cups of water in the first box to the cups of water to the first box in the second box, and divide that by 4 to give yourself the result of 25 cups.<n><n>In the eight question, because there are as many as 25 cups of water, the answer must be the same.<n><n>Instruction: Answer the following single choice questions.<n><n>### Solution<n><n>In the first, 3.95 + 965.99 is 1000.<n><n>The second one has to do with time, so I started with subtracting from 600, making the hours at 600-5 = 595, then divided it by 3 to get the number of hours you would have to work each day to be average.<n><n>In the other questions, you simply have to add the number of birds killed, or the total amount of money made, depending on the question.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question and press Enter.<n><n>### Question:A boy and

Therefore, Corey can have 32 candies, which are 8 candies less than Tapanga.<n><n>### 2.A local call is cheaper than an international call, so it costs 5 cents x 9 minutes = 45 cents. An international call costs 5 cents for the first minute and 5 cents for each additional minute, so the total cost of a call to his brother is 5 cents x (31+5) = 1.55. Freddy spent 55 cents on calling his family<n><n>### 3.Freddy works 8 hours on Monday, and then 5 hours, 5 hours, and 4 hours on the other 3 days, the total of which is 8+12+6+8=34, so on average he worked 6.5 minutes each day.<n><n>### Solution:<n>The number of books not sold = 600 - 800 = -200<n><n>### Solution (using OEIS sequences):<n>The number of ways to split the 2nd part of a sum into 3 ratios, for 800, and use the sequence for each variable:<n>```<n>sequence(x=2, y=8, n=4, a=2)<n>```<n><n>### Solution<n>If Nalani gets $200 for each puppy, then $100 - $200 for the first puppy, and $300 - $300 for the second puppy. For the 3rdpuppy, $300 - ($300 + $100 + $200), which is $0. Then $97 x 3 = 291.<n><n>### Solutions<n>If Boris gives half, then he keeps 40 ounces, Cameron gives a third, and keeps 30 ounces.

There are 10 cents in the box, so 25 cents needs to be put into the box to make it even.<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the question on right.<n><n>(B)<n>### Answer explanation:The custodian can only fill 50 water jugs. So the jug will need to be half filled 49 times (240 cups) and 5 times fully filled (70 cups). 70 + 49 = 119. 119 ÷ 50 = 2.38 cups of water per student.   That's 240 divided by (340/50) = 1.08 cups of water to put into the jug each time. 2.38 + 2.38/49 = 10 cups. <n><n><n><n>### Instructon:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n><n>Input A marigold costs $2.75.

What is the cheapest price for the marigold?<n><n>Output A The marigold still costs $2.78 if you use the coupon.<n><n>### Answer explanation<n><n>The coupon reduces the price of the marigold from $6.15 to $3.38, which is below the marigold's original price of $2.75, so the marigold is still the cheapest item in the store.<n>

The race has 23 days, or 1/3 (of) a month, which means the sum of the two answers is not 24 days, since the part after the '=' sign has to have less than half of the sum. The race has 14 days, since the race has 3 parts (each part not being longer than 20 or 14 days).<n>

Additionally, evaporation from a smaller surface area has a much quicker rate than evaporation from a larger surface area.  You expect the evaporation from a small body of water, even one that is small, to increase the temperature of the surrounding air above freezing.  Additionally, the evaporation rate is expected to increase the higher the temperature of the surrounding water.

They come from a few different sources in stackoverflow and will be numbered and linked accordingly.\n\n#### Source 1\n\nAdam bought 3 kg of nuts and 0.5 kg of dried fruits. He pays $12 per kg of nuts and $8 per kg of dried frui.\n\n##### Question\n\nWhat is the amount Adam bought that was nuts?\n\n$3 - $2.5 = $0.5 kg of nuts total.\n\n##### Commented Question\n\nIf we had two values, how could we answer the question?\n\nThe answer above is a good way of answering the question, but it doesn't account for the change in price from $12 to $16.  We can account for the change in the cost by adding the difference in cost to the amount purchased.\n\n$12 * 3 + $8 * 0.5 = 56\n\n##### Additional Question\n\nHow much did Adam buy?\n\n$16 * 3 + $16 * 2.5 = 65\n\n##### Comment\n\nThere are two values here that we can find the sum of to answer the last question. We're now going to add all of this information together to answer all of these questions.\n\nThe next question assumes we don't know the total cost in each category for Adam\n\n##### Question 2 (answer to Question 1)\n\nWhat is the total amount Adam spent?\n\n$2.5 * 3 + $0.5 * 2.5 + $12 * 3 = 56\n$67.5\n\n##### Additonal Questions\n\nWhat would Adam have spent if the nuts were $5 and the fruits were $2?\n1. $67.5 * 20 + 5.5 * 3\n2. 1\n\n##### Addtional Comment\n\nWe now have a formula we can use:\n\nWe can make this formula a function so that we don't have to repeat ourselves.

What is the value of the number?\n\nOutput: 5050\n\nInput: If a prime number has two divisors, other than itself and 1, what is it?\nOutput: \n\nInput: The digit sum of any even number is always odd.  But prime numbers have sum of digits of 1 or 2, so they cannot be even.  But even numbers can't have sum of digits that are prime because of the above mentioned property that all odd numbers have sum of digits that can end with either 1 or 3. For example, 224 does not have odd sum because of reasons stated above.  If it did, then one digit would be a prime number and all the digits would end with the same odd digit.  If you subtract 1 digit, the remainder can be a multiple of 9 and will have an odd sum of digits. What number would that be if prime?  If that number were prime, it must have two divisors. Those divisors could not be prime again because it would mean  that odd number would repeat in two different ways: two odd number divisors would be prime in the same order and the number itself would be a prime number (if all digits ended with an odd digit).\n\nOutput: 22\n\nInput: You need 52% to pass this course.\nOutput: Above 52% (pass or fail)\n\nInput:", "answer": "E: see things differently"}

If you go over the question a few times you'll see that d stands for the cost of one kilogram.\n\nNow we just look at both our rows and find the cost to get the entire number of kilograms we want.\n\n#Part B\nThis is a good example of the two value logic test. The test essentially asks is n*1:5 the same as n*1.5:5. If you look at it logically, that means if he does this same number of minutes in 2 days, since there are 30 minutes to an hour, then he has to do this number of minutes in 6 days.\n\nIn the question, the test actually says n*1:5, so just do one.\n\n#Part C\nAgain, we have this nice little cost table. If we look at the questions then it's pretty obvious that we need a column for n, the first kilogram cost, and d, which is the cost of the second kilogram.\n\nSo just look at those three variables to see the cost.\n\n#Part D\nWhen you multiply 4*4, you get 16. Then you take that number, then you multiply it by 3 to get 480.\n\n#Part E\nWhen you take the total number of goals and divide that total number of goals by two, then take what you got and subtract that from 100 you get 50.", "answer": "A: drink tea"}

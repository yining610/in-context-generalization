Choices: 0 to 10 scale, as an integer or as a percent\nOutput: Let us say the scale for singing is from 0 to 12, so we have the integers, 0,1,2,.. 11,12 and fractions 0/2, 1/2 11/2\nLet us say for the time being that 10 represents perfect singing.\nNow we can see that 12 is more than 10 so it cannot be a possible choice even if we use fractions but we could use 11\nSo the fraction used should be 11/2 and the integer used should be 10\nNow the integers and the fractions cannot represent the same thing so we have to find the closest fraction to the integer or the closest integer to the fraction ( if it is possible)\nLet us use the integers first so that 9 is closer to 10 than 11, we can change the fraction from 11/2 to 10/2\nBut when we try to find the closest fraction the options show 9/2 and it makes no sense therefore there is no possible integer for the scale as either the fraction will be too close, or the integer itself will be too close\nSo finally, the only possible scale for singing is 9/2.\nBut to be certain, we should add the option that it is a percent\nWe have fractions and integers so we have to convert in to percents\nSo we could either multiply integer in the end by 100 or we can", "answer": "B: getting full"}

It takes three hours from Atlanta to Dallas.  If someone traveled from Atlanta to Dallas without stopping or sleeping, how long would it take her to reach her destination?\nOutput: The question tells us that we know the distance.  This is the easy part.  The hard part is getting there.\n75 mph at one hour is 75/(60 X1)=3.75 miles.\n3 hours at 75 mph = 3.75 miles * 2 = 7.5  miles\n7.5 miles * 3(stop and sleep)=22.5 miles.\nSo the final destination is 22.5 miles from Dallas which equals 2 hours and 15 minutes.\n\nInput:I have a 6-pack of colas.

The equilibrium will be reached at the quantity that satisfies both demand and supply (economics), 8 gallons.\nSo, when demand = supply, quantity, 2g / g = 4 will be reached, when demand falls. At that quantity, equilibrium will be reached.\nSo the final quantity is 4g and the final price is $0.\n\nInput: There are 5 students in Mr. Amped\u2019s English class, and 8 students in Ms. Wired\u2019s math class.

If you were to make the cord longer with another identical cord, how many feet will the total extension be?  We use the following rule to find the answer: double the length with an equal length cord is added, the total extension is doubled. If the length of the second cord is not equal to the length of a cord, then the additional extension is increased by an additional one foot per original foot of the additional cord.\nOutput: If we have a 20-foot extension cord and each cord in the extension cord is 20 feet long (so they can be connected end to end), we would get 20+20+2*20+20 (2 from extending for 1 and another 2 for extending for 2)=<<20+20=40>>4\nIf, however, we had two 20-foot cords that were not end to end, but instead are 10 feet apart, we can use the rule that we discussed about doubling the length to find the new length. The rule says that when doubling the length of the extension, we get 2 feet added to the total.  So in this case, 10 feet + 1 foot = <<10+1=11>>11 feet added to the 20-foot cord gives us an extension of 31 feet.\nSo the final, longer extension cord should be 20+2*10+2=<<20+2*0.1+0.2>>31.1 feet long (or about 3 feet longer than the original cord)\n\nInput:  What is 7/10(3/5)?\nOutput: 7/10 is the same as.7, so we multiply (3/5)x.7 and get 2.1\nIf we simplify the expression, it becomes 2.1\nSo the final answer would be", "answer": "E: law suit"}

They travel a round-trip to the beach and then return to their original location.\nTheir round trip takes 3*4 = <<3*4=12>>1 hour, meaning that they will spend 36 hours travelling in total to the beach and back for the 12 of them.\nIn order to travel to the beach and return for any reason, they spend 1/12 of time at the beach and the rest in between trips.\nSo they will spend 12/13 more time in their respective residence than in between.\nIf they return 1/5 of the time, it will take 36/12, or 3 hours to get back.\nSo the final result will be 3/5 of 12 hours, or 6 hours.

Let C = $1000\nThe accountant needs to start carrying both places, if he carries both place, he\u2019s lose $0.50 each time\u2026\nSo the final answer = $1,200 - 1000 = $200\n\nInput : The accountant was very impressed with the amount of money that the other employee saved by not being late on many days.

He uses $175 of the batter and $300 of the eggs, flour, and sugar and has $100 left. How much water did he use?\nOutput:First subtract all the materials that were used from the money that was given and they will all come out to a number that is less than $0. 175 of batter is $175 then $500-$300 then $0. So he used $175 + 300 + 0 then that is $575.\n\nThen add everything in back but first make sure they were all smaller than $0 to make sure that what is added together is the $175 + $300 + $0. So make all of the subtracted numbers smaller than $0 then make sure the numbers he used are smaller than every single part of the water he used then add all of those numbers together (you may subract from other water) so add $0 + 0 + 0 + $(175) + 0 + 300 = $575 \nSo then you would take the water left over from the egg water = $300\nWater you use = $300 - $300 (waste) = $0\nWater used = $300/0 = $300 per week.\n\n\nInput: Danny has a lawn service budget of $250.

{"idx": 131, "text": "There are two rivers where the stream flows out; one river is the major river and one is the tributary.  At the very beginning the river is the major river.  It starts to widen into a tributary near the mountain.  On the tributary, the water is flat because there are no hills that the water could fall off.  So, the distance from the start of the river to where you are able to throw the rock is the one where the water begins to widen.\nFor Choice D, the water could not go into the river if the rock were thrown away because it is against the wall.  No way back. Choice B is not correct, because if a rock were thrown under the bridge, it would not be able to cross it because both the bridge is too far away and because it is not flat.   No way to cross!  The rock will fall short of crossing the bridge.  Choices A, C, E are not possible either.  There will be a wall.\nTherefore, answer B is the correct answer!\n\nOutput:It doesn't matter how big the river is, but the bridge will be a problem.\nNo river will cross the bridge to be able to throw the rock from the bridge.  There would be no way to get across the bridge.\nAside from the surface of the earth, you cannot throw a rock where a bridge goes across.  You could throw the rock off the ground where it is flat.\nNow, you can throw the rock off a cliff (ground).  But you also must be near the cliff near the river.  If you are too far from the river then the rock will fall into the river without reaching the ground and hitting the cliff on a flat surface.

If it rains 17 mm on 18 different days of the year, how many rainy days does Australia have?\nOutput:First, let's rephrase the question (a little).\n\"What's the probability that it rains on the [48th] day?\"\nNow, the probability that it rained on then'th day during the year is\n\\[ \\frac { (365 - n) + {n (n - 1) / 2} } {(7 741 201)(365 - n)} \\]\nwhereas\n\\[ \\frac{( 48 -n)(48 -n+1) } { (7 741 )(48 -n)} \\]\nis the probability that it raini 2 days together (therefore, sum of above two terms). Then,\nthe probability that it rains for 17 days (2 weeks) is\n\\[ 1 - (1- \\frac{\\pi }{7 741})^{17} \\approx 0.32 \\]\nSo, it rains for 2 weeks on average in Australia (if this year also).\nSo, the number of days where it rained is:\n(7741.2)(2) = 15 481 days (with 2 weeks).\nNow, a simple counting, it rains exactly on 15 479 days.\nThen, the probability that it doesn't rain on a day is:\n1 - 0.32 = 0.68, or:\nthe probability that it doesn'tdoesnt rain on a day is approximately 71.8%.\nThis means that more than 1/3 of the days it doesn'tsuddenly doesn't rain.\nSo, in total, in Australia it rains about (410 + 15577) is about 15 492.2 mm (I'", "answer": "C: closer"}

Will there be any money left at the register, after all the discounts?\nOutput: I'm using double 10% and 40% so I do the math.  Double 10%=<<Double 10% =>>2x10%=20%\n\nI do it again with 40%.  So 40%=<<40% =>>4x10%=40\n\nSo the total of the percentages is 20%+40%= <<20% + 40% =>>60%\n\nUsing the same math I found out that: 10%off of double 20% is 2%, and the normal cost of the item was 70% off.\n\nTotal Cost=<<Total Cost =>>70% of 50", "answer": "E: hand written"}

They had a coupon that was worth 15% off for books that already were on sale. How much did the book cost?\nThere were two ways to get the book for $5, using the coupon and without the coupon, and using the coupon would get you an overall book price of $4.25 whereas the other option would result in a price of $5. The coupon is worth 15%, so they are saving 15% of the overall price of the book. The overall price of the book is $4.25 + 15% of $4.20 so they are taking 0.15 (.15 = 15% of number)x $4.20 and getting $0.63, and the discount was for 15% so they were taking it off of the original price. Multiplying 15% off by the original price gets you this: 0.15*(5*$0.63) = $0.3475 so the book cost $4.25-$0.347=$4.247\nSo the final answer here was $4.24\n\nInput:A person works 5 days a week at 8 hours each day and makes $175,000 a year.

If a cleaning agent is 98% effective against bacteria, will the worktop now be safe to use?\nOutput: The answer is E, This question requires a bit of math before it can be answered, so it's not a trick question. First, we can determine how many bacteria we could eliminate if we could eliminate 98% of the bacteria. If we use 98% of 9933= <<98*9933=9582>>9582 we can determine the minimum number of bacteria left:\n1-98*99=<<1-98*100=2>>2 = minimum number of bacterium left.

The third and four sides each have L L L  equal 12 inches, except for the fact that (3-L) is 3 feet 8  inches shorter and contains 12 8  of that length.  You are given that L L  is about 1 foot 24 inches.  So L  +(3-24)2=<<L+((3-3)=(3-6)=4>>4\nThis means that the three longer sides have lengths L = ((3-((1-4)/(8*3-6)))4*L = (72-((1-4)*5)/2)*L = (729/5)*L = 447/5 L = <<L=447/5>>447/5 Inches.\nYou also know that the first side is 5 feet 8  inches.  Then the perimeter = L + ((3-24) L  +((3-24)+L)=<<L+(3-24)+((((3-24)*5)/2)+L)>>59L.\nSo the perimeter = 447 447/2 == 223.5 inches.\nLets get rid of the division sign.

The rate of consumption of gasoline is 75 ml per liter.  How many liters will the car consume in a day?  Choices: a.30, b.162, c.326, d.450 \nOutput:A car that consumes 75ml per liter, means that it will use 75ml per minute.  Given that the car travels for 60 mins in an hour, the car only has 60*75/1000 = <<60*75=45000>>45000 ml to use up for the entire hour.\nIn the same minute, it takes 60*10,61/1000=<<60*10.61=632.6>>632.6 litre.\nSo, after 1H, it uses 45000-632.6=<<45000  - 632.6 = 38673.4>>38673 liters.\nIn this way, it will consume a total of x10 units of 75ml each for the entire day.\nThis means 3867.3 unit liters x 75=<<3867.75>>3867.5 liters of gasoline are consumed in a day.\nTherefore, the final answer is \n3867.6\n \nInput:\nWe are trying to drive from point A which is at 236 feet above sea level to point B which is at 650 feet above sea level.

The same particles of water vapor that make up clouds can turn into ice when they're colder and weigh less to fall down, which causes precipitation.\nThis is because temperature (a variable that defines density) affects evaporation (the rate at which evaporation occurs), which causes precipitation (what forms after these drops fall) and the formation of clouds.\nClouds form within three miles (10,000 feet) of the ground.\nCumulus clouds are formed by rising air near the ground.\nThere are no clouds in polar (either of them) because that's so cold the air that normally makes these clouds freezes to the ground.\nSo, on the other hand, if you lived in a town that sits higher than any of these other choices, you would still probably see clouds.\nThese clouds may have been caused by either a cold front or a warm front.\nIrrespective of the clouds in the sky, you can't see down to the ground from the bottom of a tower, so you can't answer this question!\nSo the final answer should be D:Tower\n\nInput:I saw a movie today.

First, we can arrange all of the people into a single row if people are standing next to each other. We will denote each row as R1 R2 R3 R4\nIn this case, R1 and R2 would be identical with 100 people in each row. In R4, R3, R2, R1, the people would be alternating, which means we'll have to write R1 like this: R1 R2 R1 R2 R2... and so on so that every person has at least one person next to them. We'll also write R4 like this: R1 = R1 R2 = R1 R2 R4 = R2 R3 R5... Therefore, we have the number of rows so that every person can be next to some other person. We can't leave the first person since they have no one next to them, but they get first place; we can't leave the last person since they have noone next to them and they get last place; and, of course, every other person can get next to someone.

They hiked 8 miles to the campsite, where there were 900 cubic feet of dry wood in an old fire ring.  On the first night, \u00bd of the wood was consumed in a 5 hour campfire.  If they burned no more wood for the rest of the evening, and took in only 400 cubic feet more wood, how many more nights will their current supply last?  How many miles do they need to hike back to the truck? (Assume one mile = 5280 feet.)\nOutput: There are 900/2 = <<900/2=450>>450 cubic feet of wood consumed in the first night.\nIf they burned no more for the rest of the night and took in 400 cubics feet more wood, that is not enough to burn a second night. So, we can say that 450 cubics feet divided by 5 is ~<<450/5=90>>90 hours. Therefore, the remaining wood lasts approximately 90 hours.\nFrom the remaining wood, 450 divided by 5280 is 8.69. Therefore we will need to hike 8.69 miles.\nSo the final answers are \n450/5 =8.69 miles or 8.7 miles and\n90 hours or around 3 days.\n\nInput: In order to keep some extra food for a longer trip out in the wilderness, a family of six has packed in enough food for 284 meals for everyone.

However, they have had time to get over their rough start and should look for quick-strike plays through the air. Average Score Range: 21. Average Point Scored: 21\nAverage Points Allowed: 22\nTeam A is the clear favorite and have many advantages over Team B. If we follow the logic that Team A has the most likely chance of winning then we need to assume that they will be the first to score a touchdown. Since I feel that Team A might score more in the second half, it is safe to assume that Team A will have more offensive chances.\nSince Team a and Team B average the same amount of points allowed they are equal in this category so to give Team B an edge we need to assume that Team B will prevent more touchdowns than Team A to give a winning edge to Team B.\nThis leaves more room for Team B. For the average touchdowns for Team A, assume 2 touchdowns. That is 20 points.\nThe average touchdowns for the average game for Team B is 2 so they would score 2 x20= 40\nAdditionally they would prevent 2 x 40 = 80\n\nTeam A: 20 + 20 = 40 + 33 (Average points allowed) = 73\nTeam B: 40 + 40 = 2x 20 = 80 + 40 (Average points allowed).\nThis means that Team B will score the total of", "answer": "D: growth"}

What is 101% of 190?\nOutput: The owner of the farm knows the total number of acres on his farm. He can use this information to calculate the acres planted in each field based on the number of corn kernels in a typical ear of corn and the number of pounds of potatoes that fit in a typical bag of potatoes.\nWe know that 57 seeds = <<57>>57 seeds in an ear of corn.\nSo, 101%*57=<<101%* 57=59>>59 rows would be planted with corn.\nSo, we know from the total acres of <<190>>190 on the farm that 190*(59/57)= <<190*(50.71)=197.83>>197.8 acres would have been planted with corn. \nAs for potatoes, we know that a typical 20-pound bag of potatoes contains approximately 80 pounds of potatoes.\nSo, we can use this to solve for the number of rows planted with potatoes. \nWe know that 101%*(80/20)=<<101%*(4>>4 rows will be planted with potatoes, giving us 197.8 + 4 = <<197.8+4=198>>1% of total acreage were planted with potatoes\nSo the final answer would be 198\n\nInput: A farmer plants 45% of his acres in corn.

In this example, we simplify the fraction 2/7 to 1/2. It is an example of a fraction in lowest terms.\n(A) A number has been reduced and it is in greatest value. In this example, 7/2 is equivalent to 3 1/2 \n(S) To add or subtract fractions, convert them to an improper fraction then add or subtract the numbers to find a simplified fraction. In the example below, 5/3 + 1/4 is 11/7, which is then divided by 7 to get the answer.\n(I) An integer that results in a fraction is called a Improper fraction. A few examples are: 34/1, -11/4 etc.\n(E) Adding an exponent indicates multiplying all the numbers inside a fraction by a power of 10 to the end of the number. To simplify exponents, we subtract numbers that are the same only for the end digits and then to the decimal power.\nMultiply the numerator by the reciprocal of the denominator. In this example, (1/3) \u00d7 (1/4) = 1/12\nMultiply the denominator by the reciprocul of the numerator. In this example (1/3)  \u00d7 (1/4)= 2/12 \nMultiply the new numerator by the new denominator. In this case (2/12) \u00d7 (2/3) = 4/36\nSubtract the numerator from the denominator. in this case ((4/36) - (2/12))= 14/54\nSimplify the Fraction.

Your approach is also included in your answer as well as any testing you do. The code does not have to be perfect and can be in a very early state.\n---\nFor my instructions, I decided to work with C++ to solve all the questions. One reason why I used C++ is that I know it well and I am comfortable using it. However, I had to learn how to implement arrays because some of the questions required the use of arrays. I also used printf in the majority of my code and learned that printf is useful for printing data to the screen. \n\nI followed many C++ best practices when programming such as using braces, using spaces when you indented your code, and using comments throughout my code. I knew all this is pretty standard when it comes to programing since it is a part language and it is considered good programming practice.\n\nI got my first instructional assignment done within two hours of being given it. However, that is my typical style when I am trying to learn something new. I like to have a goal and then work with full knowledge that I will do my best to obtain it, but I will do it at the start without learning as much as possible in doing so. Usually, I find that I am happier with my work at the end and more relaxed about it as a result.\n\nThe program I wrote has multiple errors though. Many of those errors are due to formatting and syntax. My goal is to learn C++ and I think there is a lot I need to learn in terms of best practices, formatting, and syntax. I am excited to learn even more in these areas and look forward to programming using it the future.\n\n### Instructions:Program this solution in an editor of your choice.

This would work because the total cost for the bike is $225 and the delivery charge equaled $27.50.  $225+ $27.5 = $252.50. $225/$25 = 9 that rounds to 10. $220 divided by 9 equals 24 that rounds to 25.  10% of $225 equals $22.50, $225 - $22.5 = $202.50, 9% of $220 equals $19.80, $220 - $19.8= $200.20, 9% = $18.2, 18/20 = 0.9, 9/20 = 9.8, 15 multiplied by 0.9 = 13.5, $200/13.5 = $14.92 multiplied by 0, since 1.01 * 10.00 = 1", "answer": "A: coffee"}

Each cornstalk consists of 7 ears of corn.   The farm owner wants to harvest the corn and give it to those who need it most.   What is the largest square that will fit within the area of the farm?\n\n#### My Answer:\nI am going to assume that each square has a radius of 1 foot.\n\nSince the farm is infinite (with no edge) I must first find the minimum length of an edge that I can use for the square to fit within the area. I will use this 1.\n\nI know the square is going to have side length of 2.4 ft. (7*1.2ft).\nNow I multiply this by the side length to get the total area. Which is  1 * 1.2 * 1.2 = 1.44\nNow I divide the area by the length of the edge of the square to get the square that will fit: 1.44/1 = 1.4\nSo the largest square that will make the square fit within the area is a square with 1.4 ft x 1.4 ft.\n\n#### How I did it.\n\nI am going to go back to the minimum length of an side of each square.\n\nI will multiply 0.25(the square root of 0.5) and 0.25 which is 0.375\nSo if it the area is 1.44 then each square will consist of a side length of 0.9.\nWhich is 0.9 ft x0.9 ft = 0.81 sq ft.\n\nI am also going to add 0.15 (3/20) to the number to get the next biggest square as this is as small as it can get:\n\n0.81 + 0.15 = 0.96 square ft.", "answer": "C: garden"}

Two of these integers are chosen at random, and you ask a person to guess which two integers he chose. Let the person make a guess after seeing n/2 integers. Show that if n is large enough, the probability of guessing is less than 1/n. To see this, consider one approach the person could take. Let Ik be the set containing the integer he guessed at the k-th guess. He doesn\u2019t know that there are n integers in the array in total, therefore he will be making guesses on what the other (n - k) integers are. Each guess he makes will decrease the size of Ik by at least 1. So, the probability that his Ik will be empty for the first guess is at most n/2. We know that the person\u2019s guess must be a pair of unique integers, since he has all the information about the array, but the probabilities of guessing the same thing on two consecutive guesses is at most 1/n.\n\nOutput: True\n\nInput:In a country where the average size of a woman is height 65 inches and a man is 75 inches, what is the percentage of women who are shorter than men?\nOutput: 9%\n\nInput:In this challenge, the only operators you are given are +, -,, *\nIt is your job to work out the equations and submit the answers (given in answers.tex)\n\n\nInput: You are a spy who wants to make sure you don\u2019t stand out.

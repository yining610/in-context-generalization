How many hours do these employees work together in total?\nThe total hours worked by these employees is equal to the sum of their individual time sheets.\nTheir total time sheet is $M+N+S$, which we can rewrite as $(M+N+S)(1\u22121/3/5)$\nNow, we can see that the total hours worked equals $M(1-1/3)-1/3(N+S)$.  Substituting in $M=(125-1/3)/3$, $N=((1-1/3/5)*12)/5$\nAnd $S=$<<S:=((1-1/5)*125/3)>>(125/3)*1/5.\nSince it's just a matter of plug and chug, the final answer is simply (125-19", "answer": "C: progress"}

Going overland, this is about how long it would take to drive from your destination to the coast (assuming 2 hours to travel at 60 m.p.h.).\nGoing by sea, this is how long it would take for a boat to travel, assuming 45 m.p.h. for the river and 60 m.h. for the ocean.\nSo if the journey from your destination to the next city takes about half the length of the time to travel by land, then you ought to take the boat, otherwise you should drive. \nThe river is, say, 80 minutes long, the road is 15 minutes long, and the ocean is another half hour.  This leaves another 30 or so minutes for delays.  So in 150 minutes, or about 2 and a half hours, you need to decide whether your journey is longer by sea (assuming 45 m.h. along the river + 45 m.s. on the ocean, so 90 minutes + 90min.) or by land (assuming 2 hour + 10 min drive).\nSo the final answer, if halfway along the road is: 110.\n\n### Instructions: Answer the following multiple choice question and write the corresponding answer in the box.Answer the following multiple choice questions and write the corresponding answer on the box.\n\nIn the 14th century, the first of the ______________ (period of time), commonly known as the \u201cMiddle Ages\u201d, began and ended the same time.\nInput: Choices: Medieval", "answer": "A: family room"}

{"text": "The correct answer is \u201cA: ruined\u201d\nLet a be the desired appearance or look, and let b be the current uncleaned look. Since the \u201ccorrect\u201d answer is \u201cA:ruined\u201d his desired outcome is that b=a, or that the look is no longer ruined in this case. So the best answer is to subtract all of the values for A, B, C and D(if any) and then divide that answer by the number of values that were subtracted. So if A = 1 B = 1 C = 1 D = 1, you substract those values from E and then divide the value of E by 2 to achieve \u201cA: ruined\u201d.\nSo we start by selecting the desired or correct answer, in this case \u201cA: ruined\u201d, then subtract all of the values(1) from the desired answer(1).

Workers need to inspect one model, A1, one day. Because the products are similar, 35 workers are enough to inspect both A1 and all of the other models. How many workers are needed to inspect the products if A2 must be inspected a day earlier?\nOutput: Since each model takes one day, that means all of the models take 1 day, A1, A2, A3, A4 all of which take a day to inspect.\nSince its the day before, so you need to take away 1 day from A1 to account for it not being inspected for one day.  Subtract that from A1 and you get the answer.\nSubtract 1 from <<4>>4 and you get the answer\nA1: 2\nA2: 1\nA3: 0\nA4: 0\nTotal: 1\n\nInput: On Saturday, the cost of a movie ticket is $7.66.

If it takes him 1 hour and 50 minutes to drive one direction, how long does it take him to go back?\nOutput:  Let the symbol D represent the distance driven per hour.\nFor one direction, we know D = 42mi/1h 50min = 3.0063695 mi/min\nThus, for the other direction, we know that 1 - 3.007695 = 2.006384 mi/min.\nSince the man has traveled a total of 84 miles, we have 84 = 4.00639 min so that 4.19 - 4.0076 = 0.19 mi to travel twice the distance, which means that 0.19 * 2 min is required to travel twice the distance.\nTherefore, the total trip time is 4.19 + 0.19 = <<4.19+0.19=0.19>>30 minutes.\nSo the final result is 40", "answer": "B: anthology"}

He has an unusual ability.  If a cat or mouse runs fast enough away from him, he loses interest and returns home.  On average, how far does Lucky chase his prey?\nOutput: Assuming that all runners are moving away from Lucky with constant velocity, Lucky has a constant speed v, and will always run that speed.  Any runners who are slow enough for Lucky to catch, end up stopping when they are running directly towards Lucky.  So the average distance that Lucky covers is directly proportional to the average speed of all runners, which is the average speed of the slowest runner plus the average speed of the fastest runner.\nAt some arbitrary initial distance, Lucky will lose interest in his original target if v > s where s is the average speed of his target.  Hence, for any distance di, the time it will take for Lucky to return to his starting point is:\n\nt = [di] / abs(v - s)\n\nIf we average this over all di, we get: avgT = [v][d] / [v - s], which is a constant, since v and s are both constants.

{"text": "The answer, by the rule, is to \"doctor himself\"\n\n---\n## Question A:\n\n#### Solved\n\n##### Solution A:\n\nThis is a common scenario and it can be simplified by simply using 2 variables.  In this example we'll call the daily fee \\$10, so the first \\$5 is our \\$10 per day rental fee.  The second \\$5 is our \\$5 per week flat fee.  This leaves us with \\$5 left per week.  This gives us \\$5 as the answer.\n\n##### Solution B:\n\nThere isn't a good mathematical answer here, but our rule does allow us to determine a more efficient method.  At \\$10 per day we can rent for 1 to get all 10, 2 will get our 8, 3 will get our 6, and so on.  So if we have 11 days we'll need to rent for 10 to get 10, and 1 to get 1.  This gives us the total \\$161.\n\n##### Correction A:\n\nIf you'd like more detail on why the total was \\$161 please see the video.  There is a typo on the whiteboard, it was originally \\$160 and when I realized I was correct but wanted to simplify it I wrote \\$161.  The total is a little bit different, so \\$161 is correct and \\$160 is incorrect.\n\n##### The \"A\" is for Answer\n\nThe answer is the total \\$160.\n\n---\n### Question B:\n\n##### Solution\n\nThere are 400 cows and we want to bring them to a new location for safety.  We know that cow transport is limited to 20 cows per vehicle, so we'll make 20 trips using our 60-mile per hour transport vehicles.  20 * 2 = 40 trips to cover a distance of 600 miles would take 60 hours.  40 hours multiplied by 40 cows is $1600.00.\n\n--- \n### Question C:\n\n##### Solved\n\nIf we simply take the daily rate then the total comes to \\$800.", "answer": "D: doctor himself"}

Here, the larger team wins by 1 point but the smaller team wins by 3 points.  In this example, the article would say that there was a margin of 1, but, if you look at the fact that 3 * 4 = 12, you see that the larger team won by 24 points.\nThe article is saying that a margin of at least is 1+ whatever is written after 1.

{"text": "You can dry clean it.\n\nAnswer the question\n\nInput: A person weighs 170 pounds. This may sound like a lot for most people, but remember, the BMI for most people for height greater than 6 feet is greater than 25. Let's go back and think about this example. If the person is 6 foot 3 inches tall, it is considered obese for a BMI greater than 27.9, and being obese with a BMI greater than this may make it harder to lose weight. How much does it take to raise a person from this BMI to the normal range?\nOutput: Remember that the BMI is really just a measure of the \"per unit\" weight (BMI = 170/(6.3^2)) in feet.  Thus, you can find the ratio of 170 to the person's height squared (170 / (6.3^2)). Since this product is raised to a certain power, you can find a unit rate (the exponent is 1/2). This is the ratio of inches gained to the original BMI to get into normal range. Notice that if you multiply the number found by 100, you get the BMI.  So the BMI for a person who is 6.3 feet in height and weighs 150 pounds is 25 (ratio of 300 to 6.3^2 = 300/6.3^2=25)  To lose enough weight to be considered normal, would require the person weigh 49.5 pounds less. 49.5/27.9=1.73\nSo, the final answer is 1.73\n\nAnswer the question", "answer": "E: air out"}

As the author observes, \"[W]e do not currently have a good idea of how to maintain human life in a reasonable, humane, and cost-effective way.... The idea here is that we have an ethical duty not to do what we cannot do well. It is immoral to continue with 'treatments' that prolong the dying process, cause people to suffer for the sake of mere survival, and increase medical costs.\"  According to Standish, the idea may offer one way to alleviate some of the burdens of modern medical care, but also raises the question of whether such a policy would allow people at any age to die?\nOutput:I agree with the author \n\nInput:In 1765 Benjamin Franklin conducted an experiment, which was a form of electric generators. He placed a hollow glass cylinder on a wooden stand and filled it with water. Then he filled a glass bulb with hydrogen and lit it on fire. He then used a metal wire to join the hydrogen bulb to the wooden peg. After touching the glass bulb to the hairs on his head, he discovered that the hairs were standing stiffly up. The next step was to touch the glass bulb to his forehead and he got a mild shock. Franklin later found out that by wrapping the same wire around a horseshoe shape the electricity will start flowing back and forth between the metal and the water. The horseshoe shape was called a \"battery\". He concluded that this battery will give a steady electrical current if two pieces of metal were connected to the two ends of the horseshoe. This experiment started a wave of inventions to produce different types of batteries using various metals. Batteries had many different uses. They powered cars, streetlights, electric fans, and even light bulbs.\nOutput:This question is about current, not voltage, and it implies that we can measure the current that flows from the battery; this is a physical interpretation of the output current value.

Each minute an addition 2(sirens) = 3 seconds.\nThe initial question was \"All sirens will be sounding\", so that implies that the sounding must increase continuing at a rate of 30 seconds per minute until a full 3600 = 60 minutes are sounding.\nIn this scenario the number of sirens = number of minutes\n3600 = (n sirens) * 1/20\nAnd the number of minutes sounding = 60\nAnd 30 = 1/2\nAnd 1/3 > 1/2\nTherefore 3600 / 3 = 1200\nso 1200+ (0.5 * 20) = 2400\nthen 1439 minutes\nSo the final output 1439.\n\nInput: A small fishing town on Lake Michigan is planning to build a 20 mile long re", "answer": "E: splats"}

Choices: A: 3000000 B: 500000 C: 500 D: 50 E: 30\nOutput: This is all about how to do multiplication using powers.\nFor example, 4 * 4 is 16, 4 * 8 is 32, etc.  This is exactly how you would write a power with a number as the base.  In this example, 1 mm is 1000 times shorter than the standard ruler.  We use powers to show how big something is compared to a standard or normal situation. In this case, the normal situation is 30 cm where 1 cm is 1/100 of 30 cm. This question has two parts.\nIn the first part, you simply need to compute the difference between 30 cm and 3000 mm. You can do this directly (see below), but you must multiply all the units by 10: 300(10 m) - 30(100 cm).

How much, in total, does she charge to clean 2 oriental rugs, not a carpet, together weighing 200 pounds?\nOutput: Small carpets weigh about 3-5 pounds per square yard.

(4) It takes a cow about 12 minutes to completely empty its udder.\nAt this time the cow can produce 10 gallons a day or around 1 million cups a year.\n(5) Cow's must be milked twice a day at the same time because the cow will be \"let down\" to produce this extra large quantity of milk.\n(6) Cow's must eat around 8% of their weight or they will not produce enough milk.\nSo a cow will need a total of ___pounds of feed per day to produce 1 million cups of milk in 3 years.                                                   ____________pounds\nSo the final answer needs about 480 pounds or a lot of hay for its food per day.\n\nInput:I have 300 1 pencils to give to 60 children.

Who are the only three people from the group who have birthdates during a specific month: the months of March, July, and November?\nOutput: In order for every person to be born in a specific month three or less of them needs to be born then.  So the possible combinations are: 10 11 12 | 7 | 8 9 | 4\nIn order to have been born in March, they need to have been born between 1 and 28.  That leaves 27 possible dates and in order for every person to have a birthday in March, every date from 1-28 will need its own person.  In total the person born in March is the person who was born on the 28th.  In order for April this same reasoning goes as the last day of March is the 1st of April.  In order for someone to be born in July they need for them to have been born between the 1st and the 31st, so there are 31 dates.  Again there are 31 possible days the person born in July could have been born on.  In order for July to have three people that were born on the possible dates that person would need to be only one of the three possible ones born on a given day.  In the same way as for March, the person born in July is the person who was the last one born.  The same goes for November leaving December.\nThe only way to have all three of them be born during April is for the 28th to be the third possible.  The same goes again for July leaving that to be possible for both a 1st of March birthday and the 1st of a November birthday giving April as a possibility again.  So the possible only birthdays and corresponding ages for which each might be possible to pick are 12  | 7 | 4  | 10  | 4  |  7  | 4  3  | 10\nNow in order to have a valid answer with each person having only birthdays for which they could have been possible, three are required.

{"text": "A because it is not contained in a banging\nInput: A group of penguins live on icebergs. The penguins must find an alternative home, because some of the icebergs will be underwater in the next several years. The penguins will have to travel, on foot, to their new location. But first they have to decide where their new home will be. The penguins do not want to live too close to the poles. That is, they don\u2019t want it to be too cold or too remote.  They want it to be a distance that is roughly between their current location and one of their biggest competitors (the seals) on land. Based on the current size of the penguin population and their previous travels, they estimate that it will take them around 7 days to arrive at their new location if they travel at a speed of roughly 1 mile per hour.  What is the closest possible new location for the penguin colony?\nOutput: The question says that they don\u2019t want to live too close or too far away so it would only need to be like 1/2 of the way between the penguins and the seals that they are trying to avoid. If they were at the 1/2 way between penguin and seal then they would only have to travel 7/2=<<1/2=3.5>>3.5 days to get to their new home\nAnd since they travel at roughly 1 mile per day then the milage would be 3.5*300=<<3.5*312=10800>>10800 for the trip\nSo the final answer would be 10800\n\nOutput:The closest possible new location to 95 degrees longitude, with an elevation between 3500 and 6000 feet, that is also farther than 25 miles from an existing penguin colony would be near 96 degrees longitude and 2600 elevation.", "answer": "D: outside"}

Since the truck fleet must keep a certain number of trucks available for rent, they must always be able to predict when the number of rentals will exceed the number of available trucks. The business wants no more than one truck in the fleet available for rent for every 4 hours that there are rental requests.

{"text": "If a single see\u2019s a fox, then they are in louisiana since a fox is louisiana fox.\n\nInput: A truck driver is driving from San Antonio to Phoenix. He wants to make this trip without stopping or sleeping except when necessary. It costs $60.00 for the first half of the distance traveled.\nHis truck is capable of traveling 550 miles before stopping. If he needs to sleep, sleeping requires 3 hours.\nHow long, in hours, will it take to make the trip with no stops or sleeping?\nOutput: This one is tricky because, if he is constantly stopping/sleeping then the answer is the time it takes to get from SA to Phoenix, which is 7 hours ( 550miles / 75mph ). However, if he is traveling non-stop his total driving time should be less, not the 7 hours. He is also traveling to and from Phoenix, so the answer must be in half the time it takes to travel the total distance.\nThe way I interpreted this question is that he is traveling to Phoenix (550 miles). He is stopping 3 times to sleep (3 hours each, total of 9 hours) and then he is driving 531 miles to and from Phoenix (total of only 292 miles). His total driving time is 292+9+292=683 and the amount of hours is half of that time to make it 341.5 hours. Rounding down to the nearest whole half hour we get 341. This could probably be solved in a more mathematical way but this is how I did it.\n\nInput: Alice and Bob are taking the same road trip. Alice wants to drive 10% more miles than Bob.  If it takes Alice 1 day to travel a distance of 300 miles and Bob takes 1.5 days, in how many days will Bob and Alice complete their trips?\nOutput: Alice drove 300 miles in one day (1 mile/minute). Bob drove 300/1.5=<<300/1,5=200>>200 miles in a day, and a half. Since they are taking the same trip, Bob and Alice must complete in the same day", "answer": "B: louisiana"}

So that gets added for a net profit of $600 on the \u201cgood\u201d day.\nIf she sells only 2 days worth of tickets she has, $100 (so that we have some profit) and $100 to pay for the tickets, so it is $200 in profit.\nIf she sell all tickets for 3 days it is $100 less for the first one, and $100 for the second, and $10 for the third or $200 in profits.\nThe expected profit is $600+$200+$20=<<600+$240+$20=260>>260.\nSo the expected profit is 260.\n\nInput: One of the children in your class was not able to recite any of the facts.

Choices:  A B: Geometry C: Algebra D: Trigonometry E: Calculus F: Pre-Calculus\nOutput:D: Trigonometry\n\n\n\n### Instruction:Please answer the following long-answer questions.\n\nQ1. You can store your favorite pictures on the phone in the form of JPEG or Gifs which are compressed and made to a small size to take less space. These pictures will be transferred to your device automatically but it may take a long time and this has been an annoyance of people who have big collection of photos.\n\nAs a developer, what could you do to solve this problem? You can use the camera on the device to take a photo and make it an auto-generated Gif. Write code to store each photo to the folder which is called \u2018Photos\u2019. You can also create a folder where you add the folder name of the photos which are stored on the phone so that it is easier to keep track of your photos. The file type which takes less space is JPEG because each photo is compressed. So, what the user needs to do is take each photo to the photos folder, right click and rename. The user needs to name each photo with any name but they can also name the folder.\n\nQ2. Now, we are in a world where you can access information that was not available 50 years ago. People can search information on Google, Amazon, Apple, Coding and everything you can think of. There are some areas of the world which don\u2019t have a wifi service. I\u2019ve been in a situation like that when I traveled to a country called \u2018China\u2019.

How many miles does the salesperson travel, all told, in one week?\nOutput: (55+55)/2=<<(55+55)>>55/2=32.5 miles\n5 work days = 5x32.5 =<<5*32.5=162.5>>162.5 miles\nSo the final answer was 162.5\n\nInput: A woman travels from city X to city Y.

For example, you can look up the height of a dog by using\nthe key `pumpkin`, or you can check the spam rating of an email by using\nthe key \u2018subject\u2019. You can check out dictionaries for\nyourself right now on [py.com]\n(http://py.com/python-tutorial/10401/introduction/)!\n\nTo create dictionaries (also referred to as Dictionaries), you need to\nuse curly braces. Inside of these curly braces put key\u2013value pairs\nseparated by a colon. The value can be anything supported in Python, this\ncould be a string, integer, list (array), or dictionary.\n\nAfter you have specified key\u2013value pairs, close the dictionary with a\npair of curly braces.\n\nOne important thing to note is that the keys are stored as strings\nand not numbers! This means that there will always be one key as a string\nbut there can be many key values as many different things. Let\u2019s see\nan example! A dictionary is a type of mapping data type in Python and\nis defined like this:\n\n    dict(a=1, b=2, b=100)\n\nIn this line, I\u2019ve created a dictionary and filled out the three values the\n\u2018a\u2019 key, the \u2018b\u2019 key, and a string key.

How do you convert a monthly payment amount using the formula 12 times the monthly payment - the monthly payment?\noutput: The doctor told Bill that he needs to find a way to stop paying for cigarettes.\nTo convert a monthly payment using the formula 10.5 times the monthly payment  to cover the cost of smoking, follow these three steps:\n1) Find out how much you\u2019re currently spending on cigarettes. To figure this out, you need to know the number of cigarettes you smoke per month, multiplied by the number of cigarets per pack you buy..for example 25 cigs = 1 pack.\n2) Convert this amount into the dollar amount (this can be found by multiplying the number of packs per month by the price of a pack per cigarette).\n3) Then, figure out how much you\u2019d pay per month if your insurance paid for your cigarettes.To do this, multiply the number of packs a month by the price per pack per month.\nThus, the final answer is 1400\n\nInput:(1235!)/22=8654\nOutput: 1235! contains 1235 factors so the division on 22 will be evenly distributed amongst all the factors.\n22 is a perfect square number so the remainder after dividing it by all the factors will be 0.\nTherefore the total number of factors is (1235!)-0=8654.\n\nOutput: I like 2! more than 32 or 42 or any other two prime number of the same digits.\nThus, it is greater than 72, and therefore more than 67 and 42 because those numbers are divisible by 2.\n\nOutput: 6! <5! because\n2!+3!+...+5!>5(6-1)+5(6-2)+5", "answer": "E: competence"}

The 1st class stamp will go up 2 cents, from $0.49 to $0.51 and the 1st class letter weight limit will increase from 1 ounce to 1 ounce and 3 ounces, or 22 pounds in weight. What is the approximate cost to post a 10 ounce package or a 22 pound package?\nOutput: The approximate cost of mailing a 10 oz package is ($0.49 + $0.51)/2=<<$0.49+0.51/2=0.50>>050 cents.\nThe approximate cost of mailing an 22 pound parcel is $11.32 (10 x 1.2 x $0.50) = <<10 x 10 x 1/2 = 50>>50 oz * 2.2 * $0.50)/1 lb = <<2.2 x 10 x.50>>11.32\nSo the final answer of ten ounce package is 0.50 and the final answer on 22 pound is 11.32.

Choices:  True  False\nOutput: True, his statement is correct.\nNotice that the man says \"An alarm is a watch that GOES bing!\" So the man in correct, but the other responses are incorrect.\n\n### Instruction:Answer the additional questions for clarification.\n\n#### The first question is: What's the average speed of a car?\n\nThe answer is that there isn\u2019t one.  A car can travel at any speed; so there is no average speed for every car.  When we talk about average speed, though, we are generally referring to a speed that someone is traveling for a period of time.  So, if someone is traveling at 5 miles an hour for 48 hours, their average speed was 5 miles an hour during that period of time. So, in general, the average speed of a vehicle can be taken as the average speed it is traveling for a set time period. This is not true for all objects, though. A lightbulb is always moving at 600,000,002 miles an hour no matter what speed it is.\n\n#### Is speed more important than how much you weigh in determining how fast you cross the finish line if given a specific amount of time?\n\nYes, since weight affects the force, the greater amount of force applied to an object, the more weight it would have.\n\n#### Is velocity the direction of movement of an object with reference to time?\n\nYes.  Velocity is the direction and the magnitude of the movement of an object with respect to a time period.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Instructions:Now answer multiple choice questions.\n\n#### Which of these statements is correct?\n\nThe average of three numbers", "answer": "B: plan to marry"}

That is because, 74/5 is an improper fraction.\n\nWe have to find an integer that will serve as a denominator, for example, we could multiply 74/5 by 5/5 (5 because the denominator was 5/5) and we'll get 3.7/5 or 1.8.  Then we divide by 63/5 or 12/5.  We can multiply 12/5 by 12/5 to get 144/25, then 144/75, then 11/5.  Finally, we can multiply 11/5 by 5, and we're up to our final answer of 1.\n\nSimilarly, if we started with 3/5, then we'd multiply by 63/15 which would give us 19/15.

If he is making interest-only payments (not including fees that may or may not be charged), how much will they be? What is he paying for the loan?\nOutput: 21.74\n\nIn this case interest rates are calculated using a rule of 72(interest rates = 72 divided by life of loan / 5). So to calculate this problem we would use the following formula\nPV = PMT x [((1+r)(t) - 1)/r]\n\nHere P = $11,011,\nr =.08 (interest rate),\nt =7 (life of loan), and\nPMF = 1 (for payment in the first period).\nWe should be given t or t-1, but we must give at least one year (t).  \nSo t=7 (number of 7 year periods) or t-1 = 6 (number of 6 year periods).\n\nPMF is 1 because it is the first loan payment.\n\nThus we get the following result\n\nIn our case:  (7\u00d772) (7/5\u00d78)\n\n= 103.6\u00d71.6\n\n=$1.6\u00d7103.6\n\n=$674.4\n\n(110%\u00d71100)\n\n=$67.8\n\nPayments 1-6 (not including the last month", "answer": "D: symphony"}

On average during a normal Christmas day, how long does a frozen water body last? Choices:  (0) No freezing water.  (1) 30 minutes (2) 45 minutes (3) 1 hour (4) 2 hours\nOutput: There are several factors that will affect how quickly the water freezes as well as how long it will stay  frozen.\nThese factors include: sunlight, wind speed, and the amount of the water surface in contact with the air.\nThe less contact the water has with the air, the less heat that will be exchanged.\nDuring the winter, temperatures are often below freezing during the day and remain quite cool over night.\nIn this region, we typically expect temperatures to drop to about 10F (-1C) during the freezing period.\nSunlight is necessary.   If no light, everything will freeze.\nHigh winds will actually decrease the freezing time since the wind will act as a coolant.\nWind speed is one of the most important factors to consider.\nWind speeds between 15mph and 30mph will decrease the freezing time by up to 25% because of the heat being carried away from the surface by the wind.\nAir temperature is also an important factor.

The sales manager gives five new sales reps a year to earn as much money as possible as quickly as possible.  Each new sales rep works 40 hours per week, Monday through Friday.

You must convert the time to hours per day and multiply by the salary rate for each rep to understand the answer.\nOutput: 40 hours equals 1280 minutes per week, or 60 minutes per hour.

The ratio of concert goers to time checks is not limited by a reasonable amount, so  that ratio is unknown and will be treated as infinite.\nAll we know is that each guard will take the same amount of time regardless of a security check.\nIf they split up, they can each check 10 people, and there is no reason to think that they can\u2019t balance two people each. So that means they can do at most a total of 5*10 or 50 people in that ratio.\nThey won\u2019t be splitting up exactly equally either because they are different people, so that means they can divide 50 by 5 or 10 which is 5.\nSo they don\u2019t need to check more than 5 at once and a ticket scanner doesn\u2019t check anyone.\nSo the correct answer is \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d\nThere are no ways for the security guards to check more than 2 more people, so the correct answer is \u201cA\u201d\n\n```Java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\nimport java.text.DecimalFormat;\n\npublic class MCQA {\n\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\t\t\tString[] questions1 = {\"The car-rental agenc\",\"A hurricane is a\",\"Jason has a carr\",\"Melissa works on\",\"What has highly crit\",\"Choices:  A: univ\",\"Choices:  B: concer\",\"Choices:  C: ho\",\"Choices:  D: termi\",\"Choices:  E: airpo\"};\n\t\t\tString format = \"%%s\";\n\t\t\tDecimalFormat dp2 = new DecimalFormat(format);\n\t\t\tint[] ques1 = new int[8];\n\t\t\tString answer = \"\";", "answer": "E: airport"}

Roberts can double his profit by selling 6 apples, resulting in a total profit of $0.06.  He can double this profit by simply multiplying the number of apples he sold.  Thus, his profit per apple is $0.06 * 6 = $0.03 per apple.  We can find the price per apples simply by dividing the price of the box by the total number of apples.  Thus, each apple costs $0.10, or $0.50 per box.\nWe have verified that we have the correct solution. Now we simply compare", "answer": "B: look attractive"}

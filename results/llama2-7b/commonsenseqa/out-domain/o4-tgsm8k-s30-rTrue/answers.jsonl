This means that he will pay $36,456 for the car.\n\n### RATIONALES\n\nSince Ralph is paying a set monthly payment he will have to borrow more money to pay for the car (see above)\nthe 1000+ or the 1100-253 = 747 194 dollars for 11 years\n\n### This leads him to pay for the above in 10 years or 11years, but since his payments do not match the amount paid, he will pay for the car in 11 years with the amount to be paid in 10 years\n\n\n### Since he plans on paying 11 years to pay for 10 years, the interest rate is 11/10=<<11/10=.11>>.

Stars seemed to be falling upon us!  It was terrifying.  Everyone was screaming and scrambling for the nearest building to hide under.  At first, I thought I was mistaken.  But then, I felt it...the tickling on my skin.  It was raining stars!  It was just like in the movies, but I couldn't think of a good plot twist to go with it.  So I ran for a building.

Then the rain got even heavier.  It must have been the beginning of a hurricane, but it was as cold as ice.  That is until the rain began to fall.  I finally got into the building, a cemetery I'd noticed along the way.  I crawled towards an open grave and got in.  I didn't feel any warmer, though.  I was freezing.  The rain stopped but the whole sky was black now.  The only thing you could see was lightning.  It was the scariest thing ever.  Suddenly, I heard footsteps.  Then I saw a shadow.

Year 1 is not a multiple of (12 months), year 2 is not a multiple of, and since 30 and 60 days is 12 months, multiple, we can't go any further\n\nso since the 1st of year 1 is on a month that isn't a multiple, and year 1 is not a month multiple year 1 is not 12 months (1-720?)\n\n### Solution:\n\n365-30*12 = 30\n\n### Input:$1.16+$4.07=$5.23\n\n$1.16+$13.73=$14.99\n\n### Input$16.94-2.67=$14.27\n\n$16.99-$3.22=$13.77\n\n### Input-1 $16.99-2.67=[$14.27], 2 $16.94-$2.67=14.", "answer": "B: think"}

It takes 5 minutes to walk from her house to the bus stop. The bus she takes travels at 30 miles per hour.  Diana's favorite bus driver has the following routine.\n1.  Every 30 minutes, he leaves the bus station with an empty bus. He always leaves with an empty bus.\n2.  He makes exactly 26 stops between the station and where he starts to pick up passengers.\n3.  Each stop takes him exactly 5 minutes to make.\n4.

In the 35 minutes that it takes to complete this trip, it is safe to assume that each minute he has spent driving in those 35 minutes has taken him the same distance from his bus station to Diana's house, or from her house to his bus station.

You are able to cross between the two buildings which tells you that you can cross the street (in this context, the street means the walking way between the two buildings). And you are able to feel happy, as you have seen so many people say that they feel happy about crossing the street to get to a location.

If the theater was 1/2 full it would be 57 tickets * $5.75 * $10 which would multiply the original amount so it would be $115.75 (75 more cents)\n\n### Input3:Jennifer made the decision to change her life.

The animals got separated after they stopped for a while to dry out by the sea. Each group of animals a bird, a squirrel and a rat went its separate way as each group decided for itself where to go.  The bird flew away.  The bird said to them,  \"We have found one tree on the island, so we'll go where it is located.\"  The squirrel then said, \"The food is right where we are, so we'll stay here.\"  The rat said, \"The best choice is in the middle of the island where we are.\"  As a result, the squirrel and the rat decided on their own to stay where they were.  The bird left and didn't tell the squirrel and rat where the one tree they had found was located.  The animals are at a standstill. Which animal had the best judgment?  Choices: A: squirrel B: rat C: bird D: rat and squirrel\n\nRationales:  The answer given by the rat and squirrel is the best. The bird left without telling the other animals where to find the one tree that was left by the group.  This is what lead to the group being divided.  If the bird had been willing to share the secret of the tree with the squirrel and rats, they would have been able to find the one tree they had agreed to go look for and would have been saved the time of spending the entire day looking for it.\n\n#### B: Skip\nAnswer: B: Skip\n\n### Input : (Based on a story about the bermuda triangle) Three friends got stuck in traffic at night, after being at a gas station for some time, the car ran out of gas.

There is a choice about what set of tires she wants. For choice A, it says if she wanted a set of tires that costed $84, she will get a tire for $48 and she has 4 tires. Therefore, option A\u2019s total will be 4*$48=$84$. Since option B says if she want a set of 5, she will have to pay $125+$40=$165. Therefore, option B\u2019s total cost will be $165.

Many people are ill all over the world and it is not unusual to see someone on the toilet or sink.\nB: The solar system would not be a suitable answer to this question. Our solar system is made up of the Sun and 8 planets (and their moons). Water is much more abundant in our galaxy of the Milky Way and even outside of our galaxy. There are other answers that seem more suitable such as the ocean (the water on our planet) or other planets in our solar system.\nC: Another option that does not seem to fit the answer to this question is a coffee shop. The coffee shop would be a suitable place to get water from a drink (coffee, tea, hot chocolate, etc.) but not a place where one would sit extended periods at a bowl of water.\nD: The space shuttle is another option that seems to fit the answer to the question. But it has been more than a decade since the USA has put astronauts up into space. A manned trip to the moon can take in excess of 60 days. Therefore, one would not need to go to or stay on the space shuttle to sit extended periods at a water bowl.\nE: Another option that seems to fit to the answer to the question is the airport.

How many weeks will it last? Why are you thinking about the number of weeks you are considering?\n\n### Response A: I am thinking about how long I will stay out for how many things I wish to accomplish, I need to stay for a lot of time because I have not got a tractor of my own right now and the farm does not.\n\n### Input B: How many hours you will keep your job? How many months will you keep your job? Why are you thinking in terms of hours?\n\n### Rationales: It took 8 hours one day to mow the grass in our house. So 32 hours in a week times 7 days a week is 224 hours of work. So if you work in the summer, then you are only going to work for 2 months. Each week then means you work for 31.25 hours a day. But that is not enough hours so I will give the number of months I can work and 3 months is the same as 3*1/2 weeks. So for 2 times a month, 31.2 times per day and 3 times a month is needed. There are 52 weeks in a year so divide and multiply with that number. Now 35 working days per month needs 4 weeks to work that amount of hours.\n\n### Response B: I am considering how many hours I will have to work and the possible duration of my job, In terms of hours because I want to know if I can do these and still keep my free time to work on some of my other plans.\n\n### How much work will I have in a year?\n\nWhat are some examples of simple situations in your own life that involve ratios?

Because the 20 cattle were transported by 20 trips, that means each individual trip went 400/50 = 8 times. Thus, the total transport time was 8 * 2 =16hours\n\n### Exprmation 2\n\n\n### Instrunction:  Answer the following multiple choice question\n\n\n###  Demonstartion:\nDriving for x hours at (time/distance) will require that you drive x distance, so driving for x * 20 at (distance/time) will require that you cover that distance. In other words, dividing both the time and length by the time/length ratio will give you the length of the trip.\n\nAs an example, if you drove 3hours at the rate of 30mph, the distance covered will be 180miles. Thus, dividing the trip by 3hrs results in 180 mile trip\n\n#### Demonstration 3\nMelissa went to town twice a month each month = 3 months/12 months 72\n\nThe distance between A to B can be found via the following formula: (distance)/(time) = (400)./(14) and thus Melissa spends 30hours driving to town each month.\n\n###  Explanation 1:\nAssume the 4 trips are equivalent distances but take on different amounts of time. If the trip were 400miles each, the trip would take\n4*400 = 1600 miles. As the 4 trips take 14 days, each trip takes 14/4(=7 days), that is 7 trips which cover a total distance of (7", "answer": "A: store"}

{"text": "Option: D. Changing behavior\n\n### Instructions:\n\nIn your own words, describe the reasoning for choosing each option.\n\n#### Option A\n> Option A) Communicating with others: Communication means talking to different people, giving and getting feedback, listening and responding.\n#### Option B\n\n> Option B) If you are not communicating in a way that\u2019s respectful or polite, it\u2019s very easy to hurt other people\u2019s feelings.\n#### Option C\n> Option C) Dry mouth. Some people swear they have it for months at a time. The problem is that they don\u2019t. The symptoms of dry mouth include lack of saliva that causes bad breath, a sore throat and difficulty swallowing. (Often, the cause is a medication or a neurological disorder.)\n#### Option D\n\n> Option D) Intimacy: The opposite of loneliness is intimacy; it\u2019s more than having friends or family who love you; it\u2019s feeling really connected to people and accepting their love for you as well.\n#### Option E\n\n> Option E) Changing behavior is often what someone wants to achieve when they\u2019re in the initial stages of recovery. While in recovery, most people choose to address past behaviors as well as future habits that might interfere with their ability to stay sober or stop abusing drugs.\n\n### Answer:\nThe best options to choose is option D because this is most important to me. Changing behavior would include learning healthy habits and ways to improve your physical and mental wellbeing. For example, learning how to cope with depression or stress without turning to drugs or alcohol. There is more to learn and implement in the recovery process than just quitting and avoiding drugs, so it would be helpful to have a goal in mind when trying to recover.\n\n### Input\n\n#### What do people usually say when they learn they have an STD infection?

The jail is a place of incarceration that one could spend 1 to 12 months, in a month; the 12 months are the leg of the stool. You could also go to prison instead of jail if given the charges of murder.\nHowever, if the stool legs are built in the building, they are not incarcerated.\nTherefore, it could not be jail.\nIf the legs are built in the blacksmith's smith, there are only two possibilities: \n\n  * the legs are assembled for free or they are purchased.\nThe blacksmith's building is where one could be incarcerated or have a job.\n\n  * If the legs are assembled in the internet cafe, the stool is built with time.

The maximum number of cups of coffee that each order can hold is 12.  During Happy Hour if the customer orders 12 cups of coffee, how much money does the restaurant lose?\n\n### Response\nThe answer should be the number of cups.\n\n### Rationale\nIf the maximum cup size is 12, then 1 cup must contain water.  (Assume a cup is 1 cup.)\nThe price of 1 cup of water is $1.\nTherefore, 12 cups is $12.\nThe price of 2 cups of coffee is also $2.\nSo the price of 13 cups must be $3.\nThere is also a $1 profit for each 12 cups. So the result is $42 (13 cups x $3 + $12 profit)\n\n### Input 3:\nOn a camping trip, the group is deciding to eat the venison that they brought with them.

(Thalidomide, a drug sometimes used as an immunosuppressant, was discovered in the 1950s but not approved in the U.S. until 1998.) Many of the complaints came from pregnant women who had taken the drug during the first weeks of their pregnancies and were now seeing stillbirths, miscarriages, and serious birth defects in the babies they had been carrying. In 1961, German birth records revealed that 50 babies born with malformed or missing thalidomide-affected limbs had been born to mothers who had taken thalidomide during their first trimester. In the U.S., an analysis of state health records indicated that, between 1961 and 1964, more than 10,000 babies experienced thalidomide\u2019s toxic effects. Since those effects were sometimes subtle, these thalidomide babies usually experienced them just months after going to their pediatrician or emergency room with some other, unrelated complaint. By the time the thalidomide connection was documented, however, thousands of thalidomide survivors had been born and were having to live with the effects that noone else was talking about or acknowledging. The FDA requested that the manufacturer, a company called Distillers Laboratories, withdraw the medication. Thalidomide continues to be prescribed in certain countries for certain uses, and there are some reports that it is being used in pregnancy. Thalidomid can cause serious side effects, including an increased chance of developing cancer. It is also associated with a very long list of serious birth defects when taken during pregnancy. Researchers aren\u2019t sure how often this problem happens. When some people take thalidomide, they experience no major side effects. Others may have", "answer": "A: nailed"}

Similarly, telling people about the embarrassment will lead to annoyance for sure, but this could very well lead to emotional distres. Therefore, notoriety is the correct response.\n\n### Input\nWhich is the smallest value that will produce the largest remainder when divided by 7?\n\n### Response\ne\n\n### Rationale\nSince 7 has no remainder, all numbers divided by 7 that produce a remainder will have the same number of remainders. For example, if we take the smallest multiple of 7 such that the quotient is 2 (27) then 7, we will divide the quotient 27 by 7 and we get a remainder of 3. Then taking the multiple of 21 (21*4=84) we get 3 again. As we cannot find a positive number greater that 7 that will produce 3 remainder when we divide the positive number by 7, we need to look for negative numbers. And in case of them the smallest is -7.

{"text": "Waiting is very difficult because you have to focus on it and it uses your time which is very valuable.\n\n### Response Analysis:\nWaiting in doctor\u2019s office or other medical treatment appointments is difficult.  There is really no rhyme or reason to it though.  You could go anywhere from 15 minutes to nearly all day, depending on what kind of medical treatment you are facing.  Waiting in the office or waiting for your results, can be quite frustrating.  If you are having pain, it can be so bad that you can barely handle waiting for the doctor. Waiting is a time consuming activity and sometimes the amount of time you spend waiting on someone else, can be the time you need to do the work on a separate project.  So, there is very little benefit from waiting and it really is a waste of time that you could have used to spend on projects. There are several implications regarding your answers.  In our daily conversations with our clients, people feel the need to be impatient and in too big of a rush.  It can be very important for these clients to try their very best to be patient.  It is also very difficult to try to be patient with everything and to make sure you\u2019re not in a rush.  I have found that being in a rush is a common occurrence and it has helped me avoid being in a rush.\n\n### Rationale:The first reason for the doctor is having appointments.\n#### A\n\nAnswers: A\n\n### Rationales:What are some benefits of hiring a person for an on-site position? Choices:  Choices: Choices: Choices:: Choices:A: no distractions B: no waiting C: can work at home D: have a home office E: work around hours\n\n### Response\nSince a person in an on-site position does not have a choice but to work at the business location, they don\u2019t have the distractions to leave work and come back later.  Also, since there is no leaving and going back to work, people don\u2019t have to wait around for the doctor\u2019s appointment or anything else.  People who have an on-site position also have their own workspace, which is really beneficial and helps with productivity.  There\u2019s not really a lot of difference between work hours.", "answer": "D: time consuming"}

{"text": "### Instruction\nYou should write the best response that appropriately complements the request.\n\n#### Response\nMost families had trouble keeping up with their medical expenses. How difficult it would be for a woman to decide whether or not she would be a stay-at-home wife. When we look at the statistics about stay-at-home wives there are very few women who actually find this to be a dream.\n\n#### Rationales\nI would be so upset if I were a stay-at-hone wife. The medical expenses were the only thing to hold us up. If I would have had a lot more money than that would be different. I feel like most women who had children have been held back with the medical expenses. I think most men do not realize what wives go through when they have a child. Most women do not have the financial backing that they would need.\nOne thing that a wife has to do when being a stay-at-homemother is they have to cook, clean, and do the laundry. When a woman was a stay-at- home-mother she got the kids ready for school the laundry and other things around the house. If she has the help of a maid is usually more difficult. A woman that does not work outside of the house has to do the cooking, housework and everything.\n\n#### Answer:\nMost families had difficulty in keeping up with their medical bills.  A woman would only be able to be a stay-at home wife if she had large amounts of money.

{"text": "It is a hardware store.\n\n### Input\nA clown performs in 13 towns in a 4-day week on his tour.\nSuppose that on each day he travels to the first town, performs at that town, travels to the second town and performs there, and so on. How many hours does the clown spend traveling on each of the days of his tour?\n\n\n### Input Solution\nThis question can be solved in two ways. First, you can figure out on which days the clown travels to the next town and when he stays in town to perform. Next, you can figure out the total time it takes him to travel to all the different towns. Another way to solve this is to figure out the time he has to spend at each of the towns and multiply it by four to get hours he spent traveling on each day. This is a different solution, but it works.\n\n### This can be solved this way:\nOn day 1, the clown travel for three hours and performed for one hour. Total hours spent on day 1 : 4\n\nNext, he performed on day 2 for 6 hours.\nTravel:  0\nPerform: 1\n\nThen on day 3 he performed for 4 hours.\nTravel : 0\nPerform : 4\n\nAnd on day 4, he performed on the last town for one hour, and traveled back to his hotel for 3 hrs.\nTotal time spent on day 4 for performing:4\nTotal time spent on traveling 3 hours\n\n\n### This answer can be obtained using the following equation. A clown travel for 3 hours at the beginning of the week and travel for remaining 4 days. Thus, a total of 7 hours traveling. If a clown travel for five hours each day, the total performance time is 4(7/5). This gives (7/5)4 or 75/5 hours in total. Therefore, the clown spent 75/5/4=5/4=75/4=7.5 hours traveling each day (3/7 of a day).\n\n### Input Answer: The clown traveled for 5 hours on day one. Total time spent on traveling = 5\nThe c", "answer": "B: basement"}

The train-yard operator was standing on top of a signal bridge at the time of the accident. How did the two trains get entangled in the switch?\n\n### Response.\nThe key to solving this problem requires understanding that the two trains were traveling on parallel tracks in the same direction in a single track railroad yard. The question asks you to describe a problem that would cause two trains traveling on parallel tracks to collide.\n\nOne problem would be a mechanical failure. The train-yard operator might have a failure of his switch and accidentally turn on both switches, causing the two trains to collide. It's also possible to have human error here, as the train-yard operator could be switching switches without proper knowledge of the switches that he is using. The question does not ask how the trains got entangled, so it's unclear if the problem was mechanical or human.\n\n### Input\n\nInput: A friend gives you an envelope full of $1 dollar bills.

Choices: A: none B: 1 C: 2 D: 3 E: 4 F: 5\n\n### Response\nThe question asks for the number of apples. Since there is no context or condition given, we can assume that the friend gives you any number of apples. Assuming that you start with 1 apple, your friend can still give you a second apple, keeping the question unchanged. If you keep the same number of apples and return one of the apples that you were given, then you still have the one extra apple.\n\n### Answer 2\nThe first response did not account for returning an extra apple.\n\nIf your friend gives you 2 apples and you return one, this gives you 1 apple.\nIf you return the first apple that you received:\n\nyour friend still has 1 extra apple.\n\nAfter returning 2 apples, your friend still has 1 apple.\n\nReturning two apples will leave you with 0 remaining app", "answer": "E: piano"}

Choices: A 24 inches B 4 feet C 48 inches D 36 inches E 36.5 feet\n\n### Rationales:In order to determine the total length, we must know the perimeter of the body. The perimeter of the snake is equal to 4 times the length of the snakes body plus 2 sides. Since the snakes body length is 4, then the 2 other sides will be the snakes tail and head which totals 6.  Then the perimeter will equal 4 times 4 plus 6.  The perimeter will equal 12 inches.  Then to find the total length of the snake, we simply multiply the perimeter by the circumference of the snake.  The circumference will equal 12 divided by 3.6 will equal 3.3 feet.\n\n\n#### 474\nAnswer: 474\n\n### InputThe number of degrees in a right angle is?

Judy is studying for an average of 5 hours per week.  How many weeks does it take Judy to master the Pythageorean Theorem?\n-Judy: It takes me an average of 5 hour for me to master a theorem and I have 8 different subjects I want to master. I want to master the 8 different subjects without extra cost but not by wasting the time. What should I do?\n\n### Instructions:\nComplete the question.\n#### 28 weeks\nJudy, you need to dedicate your time. First you can spend 5 hours per week studying a theorem. For the first week you need to study the Pythagoreans theorem then after 1 hour you can move onto the next theorem and so on. The theorem you learned last week is the theorem you must work on next week to master your theorems. Since you need to master all eight theorems in total, the 8*5=365 hours you would need to master all your theorems to be correct. The next theorem would then take 50+50=<<50+50=>100>>100 hours to master for a total of 100+100=<<100+190=33 weeks>>33 weeks. Then, you multiply 33*2=<<33*2=66>>66. That gives you an average cost of 8 hours per week. To get all the theorems that you don\u2019t need to invest the extra cost. In summary, it would take all students about 8 weeks.\n12*5=<<12*5=60 16 weeks for an average student and it would take an average 16 week.\n\n### The question you may ask: Is", "answer": "A: exhilaration"}

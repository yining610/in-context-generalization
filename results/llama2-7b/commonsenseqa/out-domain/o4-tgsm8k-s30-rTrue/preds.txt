For lesser damage the repair costs $1,200, and for more serious damage, the repair costs $10,200.  The car you drive costs you $500 a year to repair. How much damage do you need to cause to your car in order to save money by not repairing the car?<n>Output:The cost of repair increases with the damage, but the cost of not repairing increases even more.<n>So for less serious damage the extra cost will be less than the cost associated with repairing the more serious damage.<n>We need the threshold between damage for which it’s cheaper not to repair, and damage for which it’ not<n>500*(1+10/1200/12) = <<500*(1 + 10/12/12) = 27>>27 dollars of damage.<n><n>Output: The number of hours on the time sheet of 3 employees will equal the sum of their individual hours if they work Monday through Friday.

How many hours do these employees work together in total?<n>The total hours worked by these employees is equal to the sum of their individual time sheets.<n>Their total time sheet is $M+N+S$, which we can rewrite as $(M+N+S)(1−1/3/5)$<n>Now, we can see that the total hours worked equals $M(1-1/3)-1/3(N+S)$.  Substituting in $M=(125-1/3)/3$, $N=((1-1/3/5)*12)/5$<n>And $S=$<<S:=((1-1/5)*125/3)>>(125/3)*1/5.<n>Since it's just a matter of plug and chug, the final answer is simply (125-19

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

Statement: You could go either by sea or by land to the next city.<n><n>Input: Choice 1: You decide to go by sea (the river to the coast, then the ocean for two and a half hours).<n>Choice 2: You decide to go overland (the river to the next city, then the road to the city).<n>Output: The answer depends on how long the river to the coast is compared to the road to the next city. Going overland, this is about how long it would take to drive from your destination to the coast (assuming 2 hours to travel at 60 m.p.h.).<n>Going by sea, this is how long it would take for a boat to travel, assuming 45 m.p.h. for the river and 60 m.h. for the ocean.<n>So if the journey from your destination to the next city takes about half the length of the time to travel by land, then you ought to take the boat, otherwise you should drive. <n>The river is, say, 80 minutes long, the road is 15 minutes long, and the ocean is another half hour.  This leaves another 30 or so minutes for delays.  So in 150 minutes, or about 2 and a half hours, you need to decide whether your journey is longer by sea (assuming 45 m.h. along the river + 45 m.s. on the ocean, so 90 minutes + 90min.) or by land (assuming 2 hour + 10 min drive).<n>So the final answer, if halfway along the road is: 110.<n><n>### Instructions: Answer the following multiple choice question and write the corresponding answer in the box.Answer the following multiple choice questions and write the corresponding answer on the box.<n><n>In the 14th century, the first of the ______________ (period of time), commonly known as the “Middle Ages”, began and ended the same time.<n>Input: Choices: Medieval

Since the “correct” answer is “A:ruined” his desired outcome is that b=a, or that the look is no longer ruined in this case. So the best answer is to subtract all of the values for A, B, C and D(if any) and then divide that answer by the number of values that were subtracted. So if A = 1 B = 1 C = 1 D = 1, you substract those values from E and then divide the value of E by 2 to achieve “A: ruined”.<n>So we start by selecting the desired or correct answer, in this case “A: ruined”, then subtract all of the values(1) from the desired answer(1). Let that answer be z (z = 11), then subtract the values from the previous answer(2) which should be 2, and now subtract that answer “y” from “z” and get a, “a = z – y” = 9 or, “a = 9”<n>Since b = a, it can be assumed that the man was looking for a clean look which is b = 9 and therefore “B: clean clothes” is not the correct answer. “C: sadness” is false since the fact he is looking for a better look indicates that we are looking for a situation that benefits the result in getting them clean, we won’t be sad. But we still have to consider “D:look better” so we subtract that answer from “z-y”. “z – y = c” since y = 2 and z = 9, and when z-y = c we know that “c =4” and so “D:look better = c”. Then since we know b = 9, we know that it is false and “E: nothing ” is the correct answer. So the final answer is “B: clean clothes “<n>

If it takes him 1 hour and 50 minutes to drive one direction, how long does it take him to go back?<n>Output:  Let the symbol D represent the distance driven per hour.<n>For one direction, we know D = 42mi/1h 50min = 3.0063695 mi/min<n>Thus, for the other direction, we know that 1 - 3.007695 = 2.006384 mi/min.<n>Since the man has traveled a total of 84 miles, we have 84 = 4.00639 min so that 4.19 - 4.0076 = 0.19 mi to travel twice the distance, which means that 0.19 * 2 min is required to travel twice the distance.<n>Therefore, the total trip time is 4.19 + 0.19 = <<4.19+0.19=0.19>>30 minutes.<n>So the final result is 40<n>

He has an unusual ability.  If a cat or mouse runs fast enough away from him, he loses interest and returns home.  On average, how far does Lucky chase his prey?<n>Output: Assuming that all runners are moving away from Lucky with constant velocity, Lucky has a constant speed v, and will always run that speed.  Any runners who are slow enough for Lucky to catch, end up stopping when they are running directly towards Lucky.  So the average distance that Lucky covers is directly proportional to the average speed of all runners, which is the average speed of the slowest runner plus the average speed of the fastest runner.<n>At some arbitrary initial distance, Lucky will lose interest in his original target if v > s where s is the average speed of his target.  Hence, for any distance di, the time it will take for Lucky to return to his starting point is:<n><n>t = [di] / abs(v - s)<n><n>If we average this over all di, we get: avgT = [v][d] / [v - s], which is a constant, since v and s are both constants.  The rate that he will return to his starting point will be:<n><n>R = rate/time = [1

How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

Choices:  A: feeble B: bullbleep C: cow D: female E: charging prey<n>Output:		This problem has multiple elements (2), and you must choose to answer B or C. Select choice B when you want to answer “A, feeble.”<n>There are three possibilities for “A, feeble”:<n>A. “A, feeble,” + a word, = [“A, feeble”] + 1 and,<n>B. “A, feeable,” + a word,  = [“A, feefable”] + 2, and,<n>C. “A, feefable,” + nothing, = [“A”] + 0.<n>Since the last choice is [“A”] = 0, and the second last choice is [“Feefable”] = 2:<n><n>[“A, feeble”, “A, feebleble”, “A”, “A, feefible”, “A, feebless”, “A, feegle”] (B+C=<<B+C=2>>2)<n>[“B”, “C”, “C”, “A”, “C”, “B”, “A”, “B”, “C”, ] (Eight possibilities)<n>The answer to the first question is B.<n><n>Input: Your friend wants to go somewhere tomorrow, Sunday.  There was a forecast for rain.  What's the probability that she won't be going tomorrow? (A probability greater than 0.5 means something more than 50% will happen.  The forecast for rain is probably an absolute probability of less than 50%.)<n>Output: There is a chance of rain and she wants to go for Sunday and not be rained on.<n>Because the forecast gives a probability of around 80% of no rain.<n>(0.8)=<<0.8=0.8>>0.8 is probability greater than 0 and 0.2 or 20% gives a probability less than 0. When asked for an absolute probability and you can choose what you want to do its more than 50%. Because there is a good chance of no rain and she will go. But there is a 0.2 or almost 20% chance that it will rain and she wont and will stay at home.<n>So the final probability is 0.8=<<0.8=1>>1 and yes.

He bought a roll of wire that is 1000 feet long.  How many acres can he  fence by stretching the wire out to its maximum extension?<n>Output:  The farmer wants to put a barb wire and the barb wire's length is 100ft or 1000/10=<<1000/0=100>>100.<n>The farmer then wants to stretch the barb wire to its maximum size and we get:<n>The width of the barb wire is 100*1000/4=<<100*1666/1666=1.43>1>1.43>feet.<n>The height of the barb wire: 100*3=<<100 * 2= 200 >>200.<n>So the barb wire is:<n>2.43feet*2.43feets*3=<<2.43 * 2.43 *3=411>>411feet.<n>So the required acre of the barb fence is 411/4047=<<411/4o4/7>>72.25acres<n>So the final answer will be 72.25

First, students and parents might not approve of the intrusion. Next, the parents might not take their children to school in crowded traffic near where they live. Finally, a school can cost the taxpayers more than a prague, and pragues are more easily funded.<n>Next, a school is placed in a community zone so it will be a center of the community and can provide various services to the neighborhood.<n>Finally, a prague is placed outside of the city because it is a building.<n>Thus, a prague would be the least desirable location.<n><n>Input: At a recent rally for the new president’s reelection, 1000 people came.

Choices:  A: amount to nothing B: visit relatives C: charming D: doctor himself E: cross street<n>Output:		The answer, by the rule, is to "doctor himself"<n><n>---<n>## Question A:<n><n>#### Solved<n><n>##### Solution A:<n><n>This is a common scenario and it can be simplified by simply using 2 variables.  In this example we'll call the daily fee \$10, so the first \$5 is our \$10 per day rental fee.  The second \$5 is our \$5 per week flat fee.  This leaves us with \$5 left per week.  This gives us \$5 as the answer.<n><n>##### Solution B:<n><n>There isn't a good mathematical answer here, but our rule does allow us to determine a more efficient method.  At \$10 per day we can rent for 1 to get all 10, 2 will get our 8, 3 will get our 6, and so on.  So if we have 11 days we'll need to rent for 10 to get 10, and 1 to get 1.  This gives us the total \$161.<n><n>##### Correction A:<n><n>If you'd like more detail on why the total was \$161 please see the video.  There is a typo on the whiteboard, it was originally \$160 and when I realized I was correct but wanted to simplify it I wrote \$161.  The total is a little bit different, so \$161 is correct and \$160 is incorrect.<n><n>##### The "A" is for Answer<n><n>The answer is the total \$160.<n><n>---<n>### Question B:<n><n>##### Solution<n><n>There are 400 cows and we want to bring them to a new location for safety.  We know that cow transport is limited to 20 cows per vehicle, so we'll make 20 trips using our 60-mile per hour transport vehicles.  20 * 2 = 40 trips to cover a distance of 600 miles would take 60 hours.  40 hours multiplied by 40 cows is $1600.00.<n><n>--- <n>### Question C:<n><n>##### Solved<n><n>If we simply take the daily rate then the total comes to \$800.

How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Output: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>So the final answer is 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Output: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>So the final answer is 72<n><n>Input:He curled up and tried to fall on his shoulder so his arm or what wouldn't take the hit? Choices:  A: leg B: garment C: torso D: body E: road<n>Output:		Since he is not trying to fall, he is just trying to get up and therefore he is in the process of falling, this is the correct answer, since his clothing cannot deflect a bullet, his torso must suffer the hit.<n>The other answers are based off of what is currently happening, and not what is about to happen.<n>If the correct answer is the BODY<n><n>Input: There are 216 students in the class. How many ways are there for 5 students out of that 216 to win their award?<n>Output: There are two ways for that to happen.<n>1 : Select 1st 5 then move on to next 5 since there is an odd number.<n>2 : Select 5th 5 and keep the 1st 4 since there is an odd no.<n>So the final answers is 2<n><n>Input: An article said that if two teams are playing soccer and one team wins by scoring at least 1 point more than their opponent, then they’ve won by a margin of at least 1 point. True or false?<n>Output: It depends on the scenario of what the conditions are. For example, if we take the following situation: 1 team wins by 1, 2 by 2, 3 by 3, 4 by 3.  Here, the larger team wins by 1 point but the smaller team wins by 3 points.  In this example, the article would say that there was a margin of 1, but, if you look at the fact that 3 * 4 = 12, you see that the larger team won by 24 points.<n>The article is saying that a margin of at least is 1+ whatever is written after 1.  For that reason, I say the answer is False, and I can give you an example where the opposite is true.<n><n>Input: What is an acceptable, accurate value when computing the sum of an expression that calls for the addition of fractions? (e.g., 1 3/4 + 2 1/8, 4 1/3 + 3 3/7).<n>Output: There is no right answer.<n>If you do the calculation in the article (which is correct) then you will get that the acceptable answer should be: 1.<n><n><n>

Choices:  A: bathroom B: solar system C: coffee shop D: space shuttle E: airport<n>Output:		The correct answer (A-bathroom) is clearly not the choice that is easiest to use, but the choice (space shuttle) is obviously incorrect. The choice (airport) requires a flight so it must be a different airport.<n>The choice (solar system) is a little odd but, at least in the Milky Way, it turns out that the Sun (our star) is not the center of gravity. So it would be unusual but it would be within the realm of normal human behaviors – people have slept on the ground before.<n>The choice (coffee shop) is, at least in normal parlances, a strange choice as it would normally assume a chair to be used as opposed to a bathroom.<n>I didn’t see this as a trick question but I thought it was an interesting one.<n>I answered with B in the first iteration of this, but thought it unlikely to be the right choice and I was correct.<n>Since I didn’t look at the choices at first, I didn’t realize that the entire question was related to a bathroom scene – the answer would be true regardless of the scene – all it requires is a bathroom and a person.<n><n><!--

Since no 12 month calendar can contain more than a 999 year span, the first digit of the 4-digit year will always be 0 through 9 and each 0-0-00 span of 0000 represents a 1000 year span. And since a 12 month calendar cannot be larger than 999 years, the 4-digit representing the year will always be within a range of 0001 - 9999.  Therefore, the final answer will always be 9999 <n><n>Input: 6343<n>Output: 38+2*(2*2+1) = 42<n>It’s called Fermat’s little theorem.  Fermat’s big theorem is that every integer is the sum of four squares.<n>And the rest of the question is a mathematical joke on his name.

So if A is the area of a square with side s, then s2 must be the number of squares it can fit in.  s2 = s2 = (s)(s) = (s)2, since (s)2 is the same as (s)2, and (s)2 is also known as s2. But if we write s2 = (s)2 we get the following:  So if we take the left most 2 and make it 1(since 22 is the same as 2 squared) we

Choices:  A: water fountain B: military base C: apartment D: fire house E: bus stop<n>Output:		All the correct answers are a) water fountain; b) military base; and c) fire house. People are found standing on a line at a military base because they are standing in line there to receive or to return official military equipment. This is similar to the situation in “Soup Kitchen,” in which people are standing in line to receive their share of soup. People are found standing in line at a fire house because they are waiting for an emergency vehicle or for further instructions from their fire fighters in case they need to respond to an emergency. The same situation is found at a police station. People are waiting for an opportunity to speak with the police, or they may be waiting for the opportunity to speak with a detective. These situations reflect the idea that “people come to police stations,” to speak with police detectives, and that they “wait to speak to the police,” reflecting the idea that people wait in line for their chance to speak with a detectIVE. Last, people are found standing on a street corner at a fire house; and they are waiting to be driven to their fire house. The same situation is seen on the bus route, in which bus riders wait to be dropped off at their bus stations. The same situation is shown at a water fountain, in which people wait to be served by the water fountain, but it is also seen at an apartment building, in which people wait on line to be shown their new apartment. The same situation is also found in a soup kitchen, in which people wait in line for a meal. In all these situations people stand on a line, because they want access to some valuable resource, such as access to a government office, an apartment, a food service, emergency medical treatment, or to their own cars. People have many legitimate reasons to stand on a line; and one of those reasons is simply to wait. The idea of standing in a line has become so general that it is often used as an example of waiting in a situation where there is no specific reason for these people to be standing in line.<n>

This may sound like a lot for most people, but remember, the BMI for most people for height greater than 6 feet is greater than 25. Let's go back and think about this example. If the person is 6 foot 3 inches tall, it is considered obese for a BMI greater than 27.9, and being obese with a BMI greater than this may make it harder to lose weight. How much does it take to raise a person from this BMI to the normal range?<n>Output: Remember that the BMI is really just a measure of the "per unit" weight (BMI = 170/(6.3^2)) in feet.  Thus, you can find the ratio of 170 to the person's height squared (170 / (6.3^2)). Since this product is raised to a certain power, you can find a unit rate (the exponent is 1/2). This is the ratio of inches gained to the original BMI to get into normal range. Notice that if you multiply the number found by 100, you get the BMI.  So the BMI for a person who is 6.3 feet in height and weighs 150 pounds is 25 (ratio of 300 to 6.3^2 = 300/6.3^2=25)  To lose enough weight to be considered normal, would require the person weigh 49.5 pounds less. 49.5/27.9=1.73<n>So, the final answer is 1.73<n><n>Answer the question

Choices:  A: orchestra B: baritone woodwind sound C: symphony D: play music E: high school band<n>Output:		A: Orchestras play in concert halls. So they are out, unless of course someone is not tuning their bassoon correctly.  We all wish that wouldn’t happen, but it happens.  In which case, I suppose you don’t want to be there.<n>B: A baritone woodwind is pretty large.  I wouldn’t want to be close to the baritone when the player is trying to tune it.  Certainly, I wouldn’t want my hearing damaged due to a poorly-tuned baritone.<n>Choices B and C are both plausible.  B: A baritone is a small to mid-sized instrument -- not too big to cause major damage if tuning went poorly, but not too small to be inaudible from some distance -- and B: Certainly, it is possible you can have a poorly-tuning player play poorly, even in a symphony.  Symphony doesn't just refer to classical concerts, so this is still relevant.  So I would say B is possible.<n>Choice C: A symphony can play in a concert hall (or other large venue) as big as that concert hall.  Symphonies, unlike orchestras, can be large enough to cause damage due to the scale of the acoustic events occurring.  Thus, D is not correct.<n>E: In this case, you have either choice C or E.  But, the description doesn't say the high school band is particularly large.  As such, I think A and C are more likely, E is just included as a possibility.<n>F: I don't know what you want here, since all of the above choices are plausible.  You might want to narrow the options.<n><n>Input: Which of the following is the capital of North Korea?<n>Output: Choices A: Pyongyang B: Pusan C: Seoul D: Busan<n>A: Well, Pyongyang is the capital, but you could also point to a Korean city and say, well, that city is capitalist, right?

Choices:  A: dream B: knowing C: depression D: pleasure E: nostalgia<n>Output:		 She had a great massage on vacation.<n>Now to remember it she will have to have some great depression so let us see why a little depression is necessary.<n><n>If you want really good massage you are going to have to work out all the kinks in your body first. To do that you are going to have a great time (dream) remembering what you liked.  Finally you will need a great pain to make you depressed so it is time to get massaged again.<n><n>So with that done we are looking for a great, knowing or pleasure that makes you depressed.<n>Let us analyze the answer.  Great massage.  That one is kind of a stretch but, the depression comes from recall.  I know it hurts, but I need good recall so we are thinking massage gives me pleasure, lets do it again.  Finally, depression lets me know what I need to recall. Massage gives me pleasure/depression and knowing will let me recall it later.<n>So I know the answer is knowing or pleasure.<n>So the final statement is the final answer.<n><n>Input: A plane flies north at 350mph and then west at 400mph and there is a head wind of 80mph from the east.

As the author observes, "[W]e do not currently have a good idea of how to maintain human life in a reasonable, humane, and cost-effective way.... The idea here is that we have an ethical duty not to do what we cannot do well. It is immoral to continue with 'treatments' that prolong the dying process, cause people to suffer for the sake of mere survival, and increase medical costs."  According to Standish, the idea may offer one way to alleviate some of the burdens of modern medical care, but also raises the question of whether such a policy would allow people at any age to die?<n>Output:I agree with the author <n><n>Input:In 1765 Benjamin Franklin conducted an experiment, which was a form of electric generators. He placed a hollow glass cylinder on a wooden stand and filled it with water. Then he filled a glass bulb with hydrogen and lit it on fire. He then used a metal wire to join the hydrogen bulb to the wooden peg. After touching the glass bulb to the hairs on his head, he discovered that the hairs were standing stiffly up. The next step was to touch the glass bulb to his forehead and he got a mild shock. Franklin later found out that by wrapping the same wire around a horseshoe shape the electricity will start flowing back and forth between the metal and the water. The horseshoe shape was called a "battery". He concluded that this battery will give a steady electrical current if two pieces of metal were connected to the two ends of the horseshoe. This experiment started a wave of inventions to produce different types of batteries using various metals. Batteries had many different uses. They powered cars, streetlights, electric fans, and even light bulbs.<n>Output:This question is about current, not voltage, and it implies that we can measure the current that flows from the battery; this is a physical interpretation of the output current value.

Choices: A: 3000000 B: 500000 C: 500 D: 50 E: 30<n>Output: This is all about how to do multiplication using powers.<n>For example, 4 * 4 is 16, 4 * 8 is 32, etc.  This is exactly how you would write a power with a number as the base.  In this example, 1 mm is 1000 times shorter than the standard ruler.  We use powers to show how big something is compared to a standard or normal situation. In this case, the normal situation is 30 cm where 1 cm is 1/100 of 30 cm. This question has two parts.<n>In the first part, you simply need to compute the difference between 30 cm and 3000 mm. You can do this directly (see below), but you must multiply all the units by 10: 300(10 m) - 30(100 cm). After doing the mathematical operation, the second part is simply to subtract the numbers. 3000 - 30 = 3000 * 8.<n>Answer: A<n><n>Input:The length of a 10-ft ruler is 300 mm. How many centimeters are there on the ruler, assuming one centimeter is 1/1,000 of a meter? Choices: 10 20 30 40 50<n>Output:In the first part, we need to determine how many milimeters are on the rider to begin with. Since milimeters are 1000ths of a meter and there are 300 millimeters for a rider 10 feet long, we can find the number of milimeters since 300 milllmeters / 1000 = 0.3 meters, so there are 30 centimeters worth of millimeters.<n>To find the amount of centimeters in a

How much, in total, does she charge to clean 2 oriental rugs, not a carpet, together weighing 200 pounds?<n>Output: Small carpets weigh about 3-5 pounds per square yard. A carpet that is 2’x3’ (6 square feet) weighs 3 or 4 pounds, a carpet that is 8’x10’ (80 square feet) weigh 19-25 pounds, and an oriental rug, 200 pounds. For her fees to be in proportion to the carpet (4) to the total weight (50, 100 or 250 pounds), her fee for the oriental should be $125/$100 = 1.25x $<<125/$125=1>>125=$25. Therefore, she charges $25 to clean the oriental, and $75 to clean the small rug.

If you work for a large public company, you will likely have to work these holidays. Your local newspaper prints a listing of the holiday closing schedules for all the local and nearby companies. How many companies are in your daily newspaper’s listing of closing schedules?<n>Output: Let’s assume the newspaper has 256 pages on an average day. Then, let’s assume that none of the companies publishes their own separate holiday schedule. We’ll be dealing with 100% of the companies in the newspaper. The newspaper provides a lot of “helpful” information not found on the company pages: (1) it allows us to sort companies alphabetically; (2) it provides each company’s web site, which we don’t need to look at to decide the company’s operating schedule. How many companies are published on an average day?<n>There are 256 pages in an average day…<n>All pages will contain the same information, just in a different place, so there are only 511 bits of information to worry about, and only 136 of those come from actual data.<n>That leaves us with just (256-136)/2= <<(256-146)/2=112>>112 companies to worry about.<n>The average company size is 2 letters across.<n>So we’ll get 112 letters out of those letters, giving us 224 unique companies.<n>Note that 136 is the minimum number of companies

There was a target on the wall for him to bounce against.  Where might he be? Choices:  A: pool table B: toy box C: playroom D: park E: closet<n>Output:		B, C & E are not where billy would want to be.<n>Pool table and toy box would both be considered hard surfaces for bouncing a ball off of and a ball might come back to bounce off of him when it hits the table.  So since the choices do not say anything about the ground bouncing from, it is most likely not either of those two.<n>So based on bouncing off of the wall and the possible surface locations, the final answers are A, B and C (and the hard surfaces are D & E).<n>

(2) A cow has 4 teats in each side of the udder.   Each teat will normally produce 2 cups a day or about a gallon of milk.<n>(3) Every 3 years the cow needs to be "dried off" and not milked by a person or machine. (4) It takes a cow about 12 minutes to completely empty its udder.<n>At this time the cow can produce 10 gallons a day or around 1 million cups a year.<n>(5) Cow's must be milked twice a day at the same time because the cow will be "let down" to produce this extra large quantity of milk.<n>(6) Cow's must eat around 8% of their weight or they will not produce enough milk.<n>So a cow will need a total of ___pounds of feed per day to produce 1 million cups of milk in 3 years.                                                   ____________pounds<n>So the final answer needs about 480 pounds or a lot of hay for its food per day.<n><n>Input:I have 300 1 pencils to give to 60 children.

Who are the only three people from the group who have birthdates during a specific month: the months of March, July, and November?<n>Output: In order for every person to be born in a specific month three or less of them needs to be born then.  So the possible combinations are: 10 11 12 | 7 | 8 9 | 4<n>In order to have been born in March, they need to have been born between 1 and 28.  That leaves 27 possible dates and in order for every person to have a birthday in March, every date from 1-28 will need its own person.  In total the person born in March is the person who was born on the 28th.  In order for April this same reasoning goes as the last day of March is the 1st of April.  In order for someone to be born in July they need for them to have been born between the 1st and the 31st, so there are 31 dates.  Again there are 31 possible days the person born in July could have been born on.  In order for July to have three people that were born on the possible dates that person would need to be only one of the three possible ones born on a given day.  In the same way as for March, the person born in July is the person who was the last one born.  The same goes for November leaving December.<n>The only way to have all three of them be born during April is for the 28th to be the third possible.  The same goes again for July leaving that to be possible for both a 1st of March birthday and the 1st of a November birthday giving April as a possibility again.  So the possible only birthdays and corresponding ages for which each might be possible to pick are 12  | 7 | 4  | 10  | 4  |  7  | 4  3  | 10<n>Now in order to have a valid answer with each person having only birthdays for which they could have been possible, three are required.

It is hard to get up from a chair if you have to get out of your computer area to get to it so it must be reasonably close to the computer. The bathroom might not only smell bad but also would be hard to walk along.  No one would like people in the office much so it is not an ideal place for it.

Jason has rented a car in Houston for 5 days, and he needs the car until Sunday morning for a business trip.  There is an additional weekend charge of $25 for any rental lasting Thursday through Sunday.  How much did his rental cost him?<n>Output1: Given the additional weekend charge, Jason’s rental was for a total of 8 days, but not all were weekdays, so it’s best to use 7/7 + 1 = 3/7 + 0.142 <- rounding to the nearest tenth of a penny. So we have 7/7 = 7/7 +0.142 = 4.285/-0.142/-0.143=-0.29/-29/-30<n>The cost was $7 days + $25 weekend = $7 x 3 (thursday, fri, sat) + $25 weekends = $7 x 6/7 x 3 + $25 = $7 x 4.283 = $29<n><n>Input2: The cost was $7 daily + $25

Choices:  A: greedy B: worry C: have knowledge D: take charge E: boss<n>Output:		We can answer this question by looking it up in the dictionary. We will find that greedy means to be very stingy (cheap). Also, we see that worry is a term that we use to describe what we feel when we are upset. It can be used to describe how you feel when being interviewed for a position. It can also be a noun because it is an action that you can do. The term take charge can describe how you act in a meeting. You can direct the meeting your way. We can see from the definition that boss does not mean to be nice, because you can be in charge and not nice.<n>So the answer is B (worry) and E (boss)<n><n><n><n>

How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Output: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>So the final answer is 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Output: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>So the final answer is 72<n><n>Input:Where can you buy a binder? Choices:  A: college dorm B: back pack C: class room D: backpack E: office supply store<n>Output:		A, B because the binder is for the classroom, it is a classroom accessory.<n>If you chose any other answer options than A and B, you should mark them incorrect.<n>So the final answers are A and B<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the questions below after examining the algorithm.<n>In the previous problem, it was $190 to rent for 7 days, and $310 to rent for 11 days (since the first 7 days are $190 and additional 4 days = $120).<n>What would it cost to rent for 9 days?<n><n>```sh<n>$ 875 <n>```<n><n>How much would it cost to rent a car for 15 days?

Choice 1: 56 Choice 2: 58 Choice 3: 60 Choice 4: 62<n>Output: Sarah started at beginning of the day, after 1 hours she would have 3 apples, and she continues to add 3 more apples every hour so after 10 hours she would have 9 apples (adding from 3 to 3 to 3 and so on) so here would be her equation for 10 hours she eats 3 apples per hour so her 10 apples plus 10 apples=20 total apples. Also the person gave 3 apples after 10 hours that means she has 3 apples left.<n>So Sarah had 3 apples at the beginning, after 1 hour she had 6 apples, after 2 hours she had 9 apples and after 10 hour she had 12 apples.<n>So Sarah had a total of 16 apples at the end of 10 hours. Sarah ate all of her apples by the end of 14 hours.<n>So Sarah eaten 3 apples every hour for 14 hours. So the final answer is Sarah ate 112 apples. <n><n><n>

The bank where they work pays 50 cents/hour up to 12hrs/day, and also pays overtime wages.  Their jobs involve a fair amount of physical work.  Given that Manny always works at least 3X longer hours than Maria and their jobs require them to complete a number of different tasks requiring different quantities of physical work, how do they earn money?<n>Output: Maria and Manny earned a total of 3x50c=<<3x50c=$150>>150$.  However, since the 12 hour/day cap was hit, they will get an extra 50C for 6 hours of work above 12=<<50c*$80+50c*$60+50c=$170>>170$.  Thus, their total earnings are 170+150=<<170+12=170>>150$ and 3 days later $150+$170=$<<170+3=$170>>$170$.<n><n>Input:A man who worked on skyscrapers in New York City traveled to Los Angeles to work on buildings there.

The penguins must find an alternative home, because some of the icebergs will be underwater in the next several years. The penguins will have to travel, on foot, to their new location. But first they have to decide where their new home will be. The penguins do not want to live too close to the poles. That is, they don’t want it to be too cold or too remote.  They want it to be a distance that is roughly between their current location and one of their biggest competitors (the seals) on land. Based on the current size of the penguin population and their previous travels, they estimate that it will take them around 7 days to arrive at their new location if they travel at a speed of roughly 1 mile per hour.  What is the closest possible new location for the penguin colony?<n>Output: The question says that they don’t want to live too close or too far away so it would only need to be like 1/2 of the way between the penguins and the seals that they are trying to avoid. If they were at the 1/2 way between penguin and seal then they would only have to travel 7/2=<<1/2=3.5>>3.5 days to get to their new home<n>And since they travel at roughly 1 mile per day then the milage would be 3.5*300=<<3.5*312=10800>>10800 for the trip<n>So the final answer would be 10800<n><n>Output:The closest possible new location to 95 degrees longitude, with an elevation between 3500 and 6000 feet, that is also farther than 25 miles from an existing penguin colony would be near 96 degrees longitude and 2600 elevation.

The company uses a fleet of trucks to deliver rental equipment to its customers. Since the truck fleet must keep a certain number of trucks available for rent, they must always be able to predict when the number of rentals will exceed the number of available trucks. The business wants no more than one truck in the fleet available for rent for every 4 hours that there are rental requests. Find the largest number of hours per day for which this ratio can be satisfied. <n>Output: Since 4*4=<<4*4=16>>16 is the largest number of hours and we want it for 56% of our days, we multiply<n>4 by 16 over the number of hours which is (4*16)/56=<<(4*16)/(56)=23>>23<n>So the final answer 23<n>

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The car-rental agency charges $30/day for a car, or $190 for the first week for a rental that lasts an entire week or longer. Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

He wants to make this trip without stopping or sleeping except when necessary. It costs $60.00 for the first half of the distance traveled.<n>His truck is capable of traveling 550 miles before stopping. If he needs to sleep, sleeping requires 3 hours.<n>How long, in hours, will it take to make the trip with no stops or sleeping?<n>Output: This one is tricky because, if he is constantly stopping/sleeping then the answer is the time it takes to get from SA to Phoenix, which is 7 hours ( 550miles / 75mph ). However, if he is traveling non-stop his total driving time should be less, not the 7 hours. He is also traveling to and from Phoenix, so the answer must be in half the time it takes to travel the total distance.<n>The way I interpreted this question is that he is traveling to Phoenix (550 miles). He is stopping 3 times to sleep (3 hours each, total of 9 hours) and then he is driving 531 miles to and from Phoenix (total of only 292 miles). His total driving time is 292+9+292=683 and the amount of hours is half of that time to make it 341.5 hours. Rounding down to the nearest whole half hour we get 341. This could probably be solved in a more mathematical way but this is how I did it.<n><n>Input: Alice and Bob are taking the same road trip. Alice wants to drive 10% more miles than Bob.  If it takes Alice 1 day to travel a distance of 300 miles and Bob takes 1.5 days, in how many days will Bob and Alice complete their trips?<n>Output: Alice drove 300 miles in one day (1 mile/minute). Bob drove 300/1.5=<<300/1,5=200>>200 miles in a day, and a half. Since they are taking the same trip, Bob and Alice must complete in the same day

So that gets added for a net profit of $600 on the “good” day.<n>If she sells only 2 days worth of tickets she has, $100 (so that we have some profit) and $100 to pay for the tickets, so it is $200 in profit.<n>If she sell all tickets for 3 days it is $100 less for the first one, and $100 for the second, and $10 for the third or $200 in profits.<n>The expected profit is $600+$200+$20=<<600+$240+$20=260>>260.<n>So the expected profit is 260.<n><n>Input: One of the children in your class was not able to recite any of the facts.

You can store your favorite pictures on the phone in the form of JPEG or Gifs which are compressed and made to a small size to take less space. These pictures will be transferred to your device automatically but it may take a long time and this has been an annoyance of people who have big collection of photos.<n><n>As a developer, what could you do to solve this problem? You can use the camera on the device to take a photo and make it an auto-generated Gif. Write code to store each photo to the folder which is called ‘Photos’. You can also create a folder where you add the folder name of the photos which are stored on the phone so that it is easier to keep track of your photos. The file type which takes less space is JPEG because each photo is compressed. So, what the user needs to do is take each photo to the photos folder, right click and rename. The user needs to name each photo with any name but they can also name the folder.<n><n>Q2. Now, we are in a world where you can access information that was not available 50 years ago. People can search information on Google, Amazon, Apple, Coding and everything you can think of. There are some areas of the world which don’t have a wifi service. I’ve been in a situation like that when I traveled to a country called ‘China’. There is wifi service in some areas but it is expensive so I payed a lot of money to download an e-book

Choices:  A: play chess B: sun themselves C: wrong house D: set table E: gettable<n>Output:		The last house on the street is the house to which the children are trying to return, so “wrong house” is the correct answer.<n>If the children are having trouble getting home because they are getting confused as they walk down the street, it is not likely that they are stopping to play chess or sun themselves.<n>It is also unlikely that they are going to the neighbors’ house to have a sit-down dinner, since it seems most likely that their parents would either expect them to come home for dinner or know that they wouldn’t.<n>Also, it is unlikely that any of the children in this story have a family table where they eat at such an age, so “gettable table” is incorrect.<n>It also seems unlikely that “play chess” could have been the intended response, because even a toddler generally knows the difference between a board game and a home.<n>Finally, “sun themselves” seems the most unlikely of all choices if any of the children are not old enough to know how to unbutton their own shirts, how to take them off and then how to get them on again.<n>So the final choice is option E which is "wrong house"<n><n>Input:How many different 5-letter words can be formed from the letters “a”, “h”, “c”, “c”, and “m” if no two letters in a word can appear side by side in the same word?<n>Output: The only two letters that can follow a “c” are a “h” and an “m”.<n>So the first five letters might be ordered as “ahcmc” or “chcmh”<n>Now, you can’t have “ahcmc” and “chcmh” in the same five-letter word, because then “ah” and “ch” would be next to each other in the same word.<n>Now look at the letters you are left with. “h” must follow a “c”.<n>There are two possible words you can make: “hcmcm” or “hcmch”.<n>Once you eliminate “hcmch” as a word option, since it would violate the “two letters cannot be next to each other” criteria, that leaves “hcmcm”.<n>Next, you can only put the last “c” and the last “m” together in the word “cmcmcm”.<n>Now, “hcmcm” and “cmcm

How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

It asks how many miles John would drive if he drove one way home.<n><n>Input: A salesperson travels 55 miles each day to the office and then 55 miles home on weekdays.  How many miles does the salesperson travel, all told, in one week?<n>Output: (55+55)/2=<<(55+55)>>55/2=32.5 miles<n>5 work days = 5x32.5 =<<5*32.5=162.5>>162.5 miles<n>So the final answer was 162.5<n><n>Input: A woman travels from city X to city Y. Along this journey, she must travel up and over a mountain. This journey takes approximately 7 hours of actual driving time. If the driving time is calculated from city X to city Z (one hour of driving), how much total time will she spend traveling to her destination?<n>Output: Traveling at the speed limit of 55 miles/hour, with no traffic, she needs to calculate 1 more hour, which takes 1x55=<<1*55>>55 hours.<n>The total driving time is (7x55+1)=<<(7*55)+1>>7*55+1 which is 434.5.<n>This is not the actual answer from the problem

Choices:  A: garbage can B: military C: jewelry store D: safe E: airport<n>Output:		She was probably off to a military base.<n>The only logical reason for checking a bag is so that it’d be ready later.<n>Would a person bring a drawstring bag to a jewely store? Or a bank? Or anywhere else you can go and not need to check your stuff in?<n>Bringing a check in bag to an airport isn’t the same as checking an entire bag. There are lockers for those who might need time on their vacations away from their bags. Or who don’t wish to check an entire bag.<n>The first question asked what you would bring to a garbage can. The wording might be confusing, however if you understand that garbage cans are where garbage is stored (i.e. a can where people throw their garbage) then it makes sense that a garbage can would be used as a check in place. They are usually on a scale, and have little hooks on their arms to hold bags. Thus, it’s easy to see that the answer to this can be “B” (garbage can).<n><n>Input: The speed of a particular train is 240 miles/hour The railroad track is exactly 5 miles long.

Choices:  A: owner B: foot C: subordinate D: base E: point<n>Output:		A is yelling at the owner<n>Let's think about it.  A can't yell at a foot because the foot can't control the owner.   C can't yell because a subordinate can't yell.  E can't yell against a base in the same way that D can't yell - they have no one to yell against each other.<n>The only choice that makes sense is A in his role of yelling at his owner who could fire him.  Since he's at his job it must be that B is his foot and C is the subordinate.  A must be the owner and his employee.   B controls nothing.  If he yelled at C, he wouldn't shut him up, it would only get him fired.<n>So the final choice would be A.<n><n>### Solution:<n>![Screenshot](/images/posts/screenshot1.png)<n>![Screenshot with correct answer](/images/posts/rightanswer1.png)<n>

The 1st class stamp will go up 2 cents, from $0.49 to $0.51 and the 1st class letter weight limit will increase from 1 ounce to 1 ounce and 3 ounces, or 22 pounds in weight. What is the approximate cost to post a 10 ounce package or a 22 pound package?<n>Output: The approximate cost of mailing a 10 oz package is ($0.49 + $0.51)/2=<<$0.49+0.51/2=0.50>>050 cents.<n>The approximate cost of mailing an 22 pound parcel is $11.32 (10 x 1.2 x $0.50) = <<10 x 10 x 1/2 = 50>>50 oz * 2.2 * $0.50)/1 lb = <<2.2 x 10 x.50>>11.32<n>So the final answer of ten ounce package is 0.50 and the final answer on 22 pound is 11.32. But for the last one it says 10 oz. That means the final answer of 22 lb it would be 22*1/2 = 11<n>

So the man in correct, but the other responses are incorrect.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the additional questions for clarification.<n><n>#### The first question is: What's the average speed of a car?<n><n>The answer is that there isn’t one.  A car can travel at any speed; so there is no average speed for every car.  When we talk about average speed, though, we are generally referring to a speed that someone is traveling for a period of time.  So, if someone is traveling at 5 miles an hour for 48 hours, their average speed was 5 miles an hour during that period of time. So, in general, the average speed of a vehicle can be taken as the average speed it is traveling for a set time period. This is not true for all objects, though. A lightbulb is always moving at 600,000,002 miles an hour no matter what speed it is.<n><n>#### Is speed more important than how much you weigh in determining how fast you cross the finish line if given a specific amount of time?<n><n>Yes, since weight affects the force, the greater amount of force applied to an object, the more weight it would have.<n><n>#### Is velocity the direction of movement of an object with reference to time?<n><n>Yes.  Velocity is the direction and the magnitude of the movement of an object with respect to a time period.<n><n>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<n><n>### Instructions:Now answer multiple choice questions.<n><n>#### Which of these statements is correct?<n><n>The average of three numbers

How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

Each day, there are approximately 8 miles of goods to move from the warehouse to the sales floor. How far will a good truck go in a day before it runs out of gas? How much money will a trip to the gas station cost? The fuel per mile is 12.<n>Output: The answer would be 8/12=<<8/12=1>>1 miles each day.<n>It would take 24 days to run out of gas.<n>If it took 24 days of driving to drive 8 miles, this means that each mile is 7.5 days worth of driving. So if it takes an hour each day to fill a tank of gas, then it would take (24*3600)/7.5=<<(24*36=425/7.5=59>>59 hours to fill a tank of fuel by driving. Therefore, the final answer would be 59 hours<n><n>Answer:<n>A=<<2/7=0.285,B=<<7/7=1,C=<<1/5=0.2,D=<<5/7=0.714,E=<<0.5>>0.567,F=<<2/5=0.4,G=<<3/5=0.6,H=<<0.5/5=0.06, I=<<5/5=1>>1<n>

Doing so could overload the circuit, resulting in severe damage to the device.<n>If the fuses are all normal, try plugging in another electrical device to your home and powering on.<n>If that works, it means it's not your electrical home that is the problem -- it is your own electronic device.<n>In this case, if it works on other plug-ins, it is most likely the battery.<n>The battery cannot be recharged and should be replaced.<n>If this doesn't solve the problem, contact an electrician to check your wiring and ensure your electrical home is operating safely.<n>So the final answers are ABCDE<n><n>Input: At Christmas, the city places freezing waters throughout the city.  On average during a normal Christmas day, how long does a frozen water body last? Choices:  (0) No freezing water.  (1) 30 minutes (2) 45 minutes (3) 1 hour (4) 2 hours<n>Output: There are several factors that will affect how quickly the water freezes as well as how long it will stay  frozen.<n>These factors include: sunlight, wind speed, and the amount of the water surface in contact with the air.<n>The less contact the water has with the air, the less heat that will be exchanged.<n>During the winter, temperatures are often below freezing during the day and remain quite cool over night.<n>In this region, we typically expect temperatures to drop to about 10F (-1C) during the freezing period.<n>Sunlight is necessary.   If no light, everything will freeze.<n>High winds will actually decrease the freezing time since the wind will act as a coolant.<n>Wind speed is one of the most important factors to consider.<n>Wind speeds between 15mph and 30mph will decrease the freezing time by up to 25% because of the heat being carried away from the surface by the wind.<n>Air temperature is also an important factor.

The sales manager gives five new sales reps a year to earn as much money as possible as quickly as possible.  Each new sales rep works 40 hours per week, Monday through Friday.  What percentage of each of their salaries is the sales manager willing to pay? You must convert the time to hours per day and multiply by the salary rate for each rep to understand the answer.<n>Output: 40 hours equals 1280 minutes per week, or 60 minutes per hour. If the sales manager gives each new sales rep a salary of $1,500 per week, they are willing to pay $2.08 per hour multiplied by 8 hours per day. If the sales manager is willing to pay 1.5% of the salary from each sale, what is that ratio? You must use the information supplied and know the percent formula to solve. 100% - 1.5% = <<100%-1.5%=88.5%>>88.5% (100%) + (1.5% * 4) = <<100+1.5*4= 18%>>18%.<n>The last three sales reps make an average of $486 each, and the manager pays $8 for each sale they make.

The ratio of concert goers to time checks is not limited by a reasonable amount, so  that ratio is unknown and will be treated as infinite.<n>All we know is that each guard will take the same amount of time regardless of a security check.<n>If they split up, they can each check 10 people, and there is no reason to think that they can’t balance two people each. So that means they can do at most a total of 5*10 or 50 people in that ratio.<n>They won’t be splitting up exactly equally either because they are different people, so that means they can divide 50 by 5 or 10 which is 5.<n>So they don’t need to check more than 5 at once and a ticket scanner doesn’t check anyone.<n>So the correct answer is “I don’t know”<n>There are no ways for the security guards to check more than 2 more people, so the correct answer is “A”<n><n>```Java<n>import java.util.Scanner;<n>import java.text.DecimalFormat;<n><n>public class MCQA {<n><n>	public static void main(String[] args) {<n>			String[] questions1 = {"The car-rental agenc","A hurricane is a","Jason has a carr","Melissa works on","What has highly crit","Choices:  A: univ","Choices:  B: concer","Choices:  C: ho","Choices:  D: termi","Choices:  E: airpo"};<n>			String format = "%%s";<n>			DecimalFormat dp2 = new DecimalFormat(format);<n>			int[] ques1 = new int[8];<n>			String answer = "";<n>

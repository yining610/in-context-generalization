He pays $8.25 for the book and $3 for tax. How much was the total price of the book?\n\n### Response : A  \n\n##| Output:16.75\n  ## Why: There is no extra cost for the book, which is $8.50 so adding the sales tax to the book price will result in the total price. In this case $8.25 plus tax (3 dollars / 20 percent) results in $16.75. It can be seen that, in this case, the sales tax on the book is not charged in addition to the book, but is instead built into the price of the book. \nIn this case the tax is expressed as a percentage. But it could be a fixed dollar amount as well. In this case, $5.00 would be an appropriate tax amount. If the book price was $11.99, then the book price would be $16.74 ($11.99 + $5). Note that the $5 tax was not added to the book price, but was built into the price of book and is already included in the book price.\n\n### | Output:5.98\n## Why:(Total of 1.675 * 3)\n\n### Input | Output:19.46\n## Why:(12)16.75(3)\n\n##|Input  : The car rental company charges $50 more for a car than it would if the rental was for less than a week.

(2) Which country added tophats to their military regalia most recently? (3) Which country lost the least number of soldiers during its civil war? (4) Which country was the last to adopt women\u2019s right to vote in parliament? (5) Which country had the longest time between its first and second industrialisation?\n\n### Answer:A, C, A or B.\n\n### Input\nA train track system has been in place in France for centuries. In the 1800s, Americans also began building train tracks. However, they moved slower than Europeans and built their tracks to a narrower, lighter gauge than other nations.  \n\nThe United Kingdom added top hats to the military uniform soon after 1800. The British army, with their widespread use, influenced other countries as well. In fact, the French army eventually began wearing top hats. The United States was the only major country that didn\u2019t adopt tophats in their soldiers clothing! \n\nAccording to records kept by the U.S. Government, the most soldiers were killed during the U.S. Civil war.  Although the U.S. lost many, less men were killed in war as the country transitioned from an agrarian society to an industrialized nation. In fact, when compared to total deaths during peacetime in any country\u2019s history, the U.S. soldiers of the war were more likely to die than those during all of world war one, two and Vietnam COMBINED!\n\nA women\u2019s suffrage movement took place in the United Kingdom in the mid-19th century. But women in the U.S. didn\u2019t win the right to vote in national elections until almost 100 years later.  \n\nThe country with the longest time between the first and second industrializations was Russia.   \n\n### Response", "answer": "A: cupboard"}

The jacket costs $75 originally, and it has been reduced by 20%. What is the new price of this jacket?\n\n### Solution\n-   Total cost including discount = total expense - discount\n\n-   Then we can simply multiply the original price with the price you received as a discount\n\n- Example - The original price is $75, and the % discount is 20%\n\n-   So what is 20% of the cost is $15, and since it is a discount, we need to subtract the discounted price (that is - $15) from the original cost\n-   Thus, new price = $75 - $15 = $60\n\n### Instantion:\nAn automobile parts warehouse sold a truck motor to a motorcycle repair shop that had 25 motorcycles.  If the price of the motor was $600, how many motorcycles were in the repair shop?\n\n-   In this case, the total cost = initial cost + price\n-   Then we multiply the total cost with the number of motorcycles in that warehouse\n\n- Example - Price is $600, and total cost is $750 (that is $600 + $150)\n-   Thus, the number of motorcyles = total cost/price\n-   Thus, it must be 15 that is 15*750 = 11250, 15*600=900 (does not divide)\n\n### Comment\n-   It is because we cannot apply the rule that we already knew; which is, Total cost equals total expense + price given that price was also known in the problem\n-   What we should do is solve the question in steps - Firstly, we solved the", "answer": "C: listen to music"}

How many miles did the cowboy ride in two days?\nAnswer: 90 + 48 = 138\nExample 2\n\tInput: The area of a rectangle is twice the area of a square.  If a 4ft by 5ft rectangle is folded in half lengthwise, how big are the two halves?\nAnswer:  4*5 = 20 and 20 = 2*10 so the two halves are 10ft long each\n\n### Output:35.24\n\n\n### Explanation:\nIn example 1, when the cowboy rides, the number increases by 48. When he arrives at town, the number is 90. When he rides back it increases by 48, and when he is at town he has ridden 48 miles. Subtract the number you started with to find the answer. In example 2, the two halves have an area of 20, and 20 equals 2*10, so each is 10ft long\n\n### Notes:We can only find the answer if we know the problem to which it refers. We can usually find this out by either looking at the words directly before it or after it.\n\n### Example:\nInstruction: \nIt takes 2 hours to shovel the snow if you are cleaning a driveway. It takes x times longer to shovel the same driveway if you work in 2 hours segments and clean half in one segment and half another.

The other animals are mostly birds, but some ruminants are mixed in, which is what weighs 80 lbs.

We moved along with our general problem-solving methods asking \"How much weight is left after the horse is put in? Which brings us to our conclusion of 1200 lbs.\n  We then tested adding something else, specifically hay to the trash can, so the next question asked would be \"How much weight in the truck plus Hay in the trash can?

Jennie rented the car for 7 days.  How much, in dollars did she pay for the rentals?\n\nInput:  The car-renta  agency charges 45/day for rentals  and Jennie rented the  car  for eight days.  How much in  dollars did she pay for rentals?\n\nExpected Output: 335\n\n### Demostration\n\n### Question 1\nThis input means that a car is rented for an entire week.  So, we can safely deduce that for a charge of $40  per day  for 11 days, the amount (total charge) a person must pay is $ 440.  Hence the answer is $440.\n\n## Input\nHow many times is 14 greater than 4?\n\n## Output\nThe total is greater by 18. So, in output 440- 18= 422 \n\n### Question2\nWhen one travels to town one must keep track of the driving time. In 3 hours one can cover a total of 60 miles. Hence, in output answer the total in 72 hours is 72 x 60= 4320 miles.\n\n### Question3\nThis means that there are 180 children in the family.  With a 50- 50 ratio  of boys and  girls the total that can be charged is an equal amount as there are boys and girls. The total is 900 dollars.  Dividing $900 by 180 yields the answer.\n\n### Demo2\n\n### Question4\nThe total is the original price, which is $480 after discount. Hence, the original price is $600.\n\n## Question5\nSince more people drop out the share has to be divided by a smaller number. so, one must do this to find the original price, which, as mentioned earlier,", "answer": "B: recording studio"}

You are designing a digital storage system for a client that wants to keep their files offsite in a safe location.  A customer must pay for access to their files, but the company wants to make the process easy.  Which type of place would you recommend to best secure and house the customer's files, to allow easy access and to keep the files safe?\n\n### Demostration:\n\nAnswer: E - Cloud<br>\n\n### Instructin/Explanation:\n\nIf you were building a bank, you would want to build it so that it was safe and sturdy (for obvious reasons).  The bank would likely be a few stories tall and the vault would also need to be tall, since large stacks of actual money are stored there.  For this reason, it would be a good choice to keep a huge file of information in a digital storage company, as it would be easy for the client to access their files online, and the data is stored on special computers, away from theft by any prying eyes.\n\nIn conclusion, cloud computing is the best choice for the company to store and allow ease of access to a digital file; this is because cloud computing is the most modern data storage choice, and because any prying eyes trying to steal this bank's files would be caught, for digital files cannot be taken without advanced stealing skills, such as a virus.  To this date, there is only a 3% success rate for virus stealing, but the bank won't find out about the failure unless it is told via a virus report filed with the virus doctor; however, the success rate could be even lower in the future, if digital storage becomes more safe.\n\n### Input/Explanation:In your opinion, who do you think is smarter: engineers or artists, and why?\n\n### Instruption:Ansaer the following:Is it easier to put a lock on a bicycle or on a suitcase?

This course is split into two parts: Reading and Critical Reading. I enjoy reading and doing well at the various readings was not a problem for me. However, when it came to understanding what exactly was written, it was a challenge. The instructor mentioned that as I was making progress in the course, it would be a good idea to keep track of the answers I got wrong and analyze what I had done wrong. I thought I understood what the instructor had said but as I made progress in the course I realized that I was not getting any better. I didn\u2019t get any better because I wasn\u2019t keeping track of why I failed each question. After much thought with consideration of what I did to cause my failures, I was able to identify the reasons. I had forgotten a few key points from the readings, the questions were not worded correctly, and I did not have a sufficient understanding of the reading material. \n\n### Instuction:\nChoose the correct number.\n\n### Answer:\n\n### Input\n\nThe dog trainer charges 5000 for the entire course, but for each dog that passes, he lowers the price by $1", "answer": "B: buy"}

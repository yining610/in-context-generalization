Input:  The car-rental  agency charges  $30/day  for a car, or  $190 for  the first week  for a rental  that  lasts  an  entire week  or  longer.  Jennie  rented  a  car  for 11  days.  How  much, in dollars,  did she  pay  for  the  rental?   Output:  310\n\n*   **Solution:** In the first day, the tank will take 4L/6L = 0.666  days.  In the second day, it takes another 4/6 = 0.67,  so we  subtract the 1st  time by 0.004, we  get (0.666-0.004) =.66166.  So the 1st  day took.6616  days, and we  take the whole number.  And do it again:   the 2nd  day took.6771428,  the 3rd took.6825, and so  forth.  We  keep  subtracting  by  0.004  days  until  1.0.  the  tank  is  empty", "answer": "B: cemetary"}

{"text": "A\n\n## Challenge:Write a program to accept an integer as input to answer whether the user\u2019s input is a prime number or not.  A prime number is a natural number which only has two factors: 1 and itself.  The challenge is to write a program which inputs an integer from the user and checks if that number is prime or not.  If the user inputs a prime number, the program should print Yes.  If a number is not a prime number, the input should print No.  For this challenge, keep your program simple without using any array or recursive functions.  Instead of array, your program can use a separate variable to store the input and compare it with the list of prime numbers.\n\n## Challenge:The goal of this challenge is to take each string of numbers, sort them to make sure they are in increasing order and then return that string as a single integer.  I can think of 2 approaches to doing this.  The second approach is what it looks like:\n\n\t   00    11    22    33    44    55    66\n\t   (x)   s    t    u    v    w    x\n\t  =   =   =   =\n   01  +   +   +   +\n\nBut, what if these digits are not in order?\n\n    01\n    (x)   s\n\nThis is not a problem since Python allows us to ignore part of string, I can think of 5 different strings I can get\n\n    11\n    (x )   s\n\n    11 is fine, s should not be there, but I can get away with it.  Now comes a bigger problem\n\n    1122\n    (x )    s\n\n    22 is fine, but my output now needs to ignore the number after s\n\n    x\n    (x)    s\n\n    x is no longer an output, my output now needs to be 33\n    33\n    (x )     s\n\nWhen this starts to get hard to deal with, that is why I thought of using an array.

First, I wrote a for loop and initialize to index = 0, because the question need to be iterated and the index must be 0, so the condition of the loop should be `while [0 <=...  <= 11]`. Next, if there is at least one condition to met, then execute the block of code. At least, in our case, we need to compare `i` with 3, if it's met, we do the following instruction, if it's not, we do nothing, because at the end, we have 3 condition to check and only the one that matched the condition, is the correct answer. Thus, the first block of code is:\n\n```python\nif i ==3:\n    print('True')\nelse:\n    print('False')\n```\n\nAnd the other two are for the second and third question.", "answer": "D: talking nonsense"}

This includes the Constitution's bill of rights.  If someone violates one of these rights, it is called a \"billion-in-constitution violation\".  An example of this would be if a person took something from another person, who was actually in public, violating his rights. The law then becomes a billion-in-constituion violation.  And people would be charged with a million-billion-constitution violation.  The president, in this case, acts as the judge, jury and prosecutor, in the case's appeal to the supreme court.  If a billion-in-the-constitution violation is brought to appeal, then this is a violation of the Presidential Powers Act of  1798.  If a million-billions-in-the-Constitution Act of 2016 was brought to appeal then this is a violated 20th ammendment of the U.S. constitution.  And if a non-million-billion-in the constitution act is brought to appeal then the president has been violated 21st ammendment of 2006, for 70th time.

{"text": "A, C, D, E\n\nA human in a large northeast city can see animals all the time. They have been here since before humans walked the earth, long before cities existed and before humans learned to talk. In fact, even before we developed the written or spoken word, we communicated with each other using other animals, such as the dolphins and whales in the oceans and wolves on land. We also used domesticated animals, such as horses, as our transportation.\nSome people are afraid of animals, though, and they think that they should be kept far away from people. That is an interesting idea. After all, many urban people would never even think of talking to each other. Others fear that animals will bite them or attack them and cause harm.\nWe do need to be aware of wild animals that have learned to live among human beings. They may look tame, but they are, in fact, wild animals who can become vicious and attack without warning. However, by learning to recognize which animals may be dangerous and taking appropriate precautions, humans have almost no reason to fear them.\n\nIt's important to develop respect for wild animals, because we share our world with them and we can make it a better place for us all. Some people fear that cities will become a haven for wild animals, who will take over human dwellings and disrupt our societies and way of life. Many believe that urban development poses a huge threat to wildlife, but that is not always so. Cities have historically been, and are now, extremely important in wildlife conservation. Human societies have always depended on animals, both domesticated and wild.\nThere are many animals in large northeastern US cities, but some, such as wolves, are protected and cannot live in these cities. Other animals are free to roam among human dwellings if they choose to, without causing harm to humans.\nCities present a wonderful opportunity to learn more about animals and to study their behavior while enjoying some of the beauty they have to offer us, too.", "answer": "A: zoo"}

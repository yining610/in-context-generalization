If someone is hired to work at the bank on July 17th, then their date of hire must be July 16th.  To keep track of everyone's date of hire, Alice's computer program creates a calendar of every hire, when they hired, what they were hired for, and when they will leave the bank.  The program also makes special notes for employees.  If an employee starts part time, Alice records \"Pt\" next to their name in the notes column.  If an employee gets promoted, Alice records \"PROM\" next to their name.  If someone is promoted and then resigned on a date, Alice records \"RESIG\" next to their name along with the date they resigned, if known.  If someone transfers, Alice records \"TRANS\" next to their name and the department they moved to.  If nobody transfers, then Alice records \"IDLE\" next to everyone's name.   When Alice hires someone into the bank, she puts a note for that employee in their computer profile saying when they'll be available to start next to their name along the top of the profile, and the amount of work experience they'll have when they start their new job in the notes section, all in red.

{"text": "A\n\n### \ud83c\udfc6 Solution\n\n#### Step 1: Finding the range of the numbers.\n\nTo find the maximum number of times a player can score twice against a team in a week, we first need to figure out for how many weeks each player has played.\n\nAssume there are 100 boys at the school. A boy could score in about 13% of the matches. Thus, each week, about 13% out of 100 boys will score against Barca and score exactly twice. So, for 26 weeks, there would be around 300 boys who would have scored at least 6000 times.\n\n#### Step 2: Finding the solution.\n\n```python\n  # Using range to generate multiple sequences of numbers\n  def generate_sequences(num):\n     ranges = [\"{:d}\".format(range(6)), \"{:}\".format(range(10)) ]\n     return \"\".join(ranges)\n```\n\nThere are several ways to write the answer. We could also use a while loop.\n\n```python \n    # Using loops to generate multiple sequences of a number\n    def generate_sequences_using_while_loop(num):\n        i = 0 \n        while i < num:\n            i = i + 1\n            # print(\"i: {:}\".format(i))\n            yield i\n\n```\n\n#### Test case 1.\n\nBased on our logic above, for a player to score the maximum number of goals in a season on Barca, they should be playing against every team in the league. And those teams have a total of 98 goals in 38 matches against Barca. That sums up to 2,764 goals.\n\n```python    \n# The maximum number of goals scored by each player in a season against Barca.\ndef part1(team, goals):\n  # team_list is list of all teams in the league\n  # team_scores is dictionary of each team's score against Barca each season\n  team_list = [\"Man City\", \"Arsenal\", \"Liverpool\"]\n  team_scores = {\n    \"Man City\": {\n      \"2018/2019\": Goals,", "answer": "D: economic instability"}

{"text": "660\n\nInput:\"Never forget!\" It\u2019s a mantra of the world\u2019s oldest veterans. Those who fought in World War I are dead. As for the World War II veterans, they\u2019re getting old. Only 250,000 of them remain. They can\u2019t fight anymore. They can\u2019t even march. But many of them still remember with a chilling detail how they fought, and how they left behind one of history\u2019s darkest chapters. \n\nEvery Veteran\u2019s Day, parades and ceremonies bring these proud men and women onto the streets. This year there were even more. More to march, more to honor, more to appreciate, and more to remember. This year there were two Veteran\u2019s Days for the American veteran. One celebrated a day of victory in World War II. Veterans marched. Flags were waved. Families cried, and everyone cheered.   For most it was a day for joy and reflection, and for some, it was their final parade. The other Veteran\u2019s day honored American women who served in the military in the years between World War I and World War II. Vital to combat and critical to victory, female veterans marched as well. Flags were woven into their hair and tears also flowed. It was a day of remembrance; not just of wartime battles, but of a difficult time when women were expected to simply accept whatever responsibilities they were given, on and off the battlefield. It would be years before any American woman would even be allowed to enlist in the military full-time--and, even then, it was more than 40 years ago. Today, women represent 16% of the men and women in uniform. The military has even officially recognized certain veterans of the Korean War. \n\nThese are proud veterans. Proud of what they left behind. And no one should ever have to question where these men and women belong. Not in peace or in war, in parades or in memorials, proud or humble, or in a country where they are welcome. \n\nInput: Tina has been playing tennis since she was 10 years old.

{"text": "E\n\nInput: 54394951817101139140.\n\nOutput: 544\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe solution assumes that if the value is negative the difference between the input and the negative number is positive. For example -55+5= -60+5=45. \n\nSo for negative numbers you start with the negative number and then subtract the input.  However this solution will not work for all values since you can subtract 0 from any negative number, and that will not always yield positive numbers.\n\nThe solution assumes the input will be a floating point number.  For example, 0.1 will be rounded to 0. Because of this if you have two inputs that are decimal point numbers with different decimal places in them, it can lead to a difference between values if they have rounded differently. \n\nThe solution looks for integers, so values such as 7.69 may result in values such as 7 or 8.  If values aren't integers, they may be rounded to the nearest integer. \n\n### Examples\n\nFor example, assume int A is equal to 4, and int B is equal to -8. Then, A-B is equal to 6.\n\n### Solution:\n\nIf the value is negative, the negative number is subtracted from the input. \nIn order to avoid getting incorrect results by rounding for example, if you subtract 0 from -4, both cases are treated the same. \nFor example:\n```\nint A = 10;\nint B = -9;\nif ( A-B < 0 ){\n    A-B;\n}\nelse{\n    B - A;\n}\n```\n### Examples and Results\n\nInput: Adam buys 3 kilograms and 2.5 Kilograms of dried fruit at a store.

The function should return an object with a method `evaluate` that takes a string. The string can be anything. The string should be evaluated to true if the expression is valid. The string should be parsed in order to find the `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` operators.  If the operation is evaluated and the operator is found, then that operator should be passed to the method `evaluate_operators` which takes the operand to be operated on by the operator. The method `evaluate_expressions` should take a single operand and then run that through the `evaluate_operands`, `evaluate_operation` method pair until all `operands` have been evaluated. If an operand or operator cannot be evaluated, a string should not be returned but instead a string should be returned indicating that the evaluation was unsuccessful.

It is highly probable that they are looking for food while looking to spend their money. These two factors point to shopping malls and restaurants.\n* If they want to shop for food, they must buy something so they have to spend money. In my opinion, the most ideal place to look for food and spend money is at a shopping mall.\n* Chicago is located in Illinois, and Illinois also has a place called \"Little Italy.\" Shopping malls are also located in Illinois since it is a tourist attraction state, and Chicago is a major city in Illinois.\n* I would also expect to see a pizza restaurant in a suburb of a major city because most pizza restaurants do exist in the suburb of major cities.\n* It was specified that the place is in \"Italy.\" I believe that Italy is a country and not an actual town, city, etc, that's why I would expect to find a restaurant called \"Little Italy,\" in a main country where people from Italy live.\nAnswer:E: Capital Cities\n\n### Input\nInput: How many people does the average household have?

{"text": "A\n\n### Input\nAnnie has 64 coins that add up to $143.  Half the coins have the same value and the rest are worth double the value of the first set.  How much is each coin worth?\n\n### Response\nThe first step to solve this is to determine how many sets there are and how many coins are in each set. We know that the total coins equals 64 which is a multiple of 4. If the coins are worth double the value, we need to divide the total value of the total coins, by 2. That gives us $143 / 2, which equals $71.50. Each set has 32 coins so, that means there are 3 sets. Therefore, we need to find the value of each set. By dividing $71.5 per set, we get $23.5 per set.

{"text": "Answer the question and justify your decision based on the information given. A. Accidents occur when a driver is stressed, tired, or under the influence. D. Illegal driving is most dangerous! \n\n### Rationales: Since the question specifically notes the need to \"justify your decision based on the given information\", you should use the three points given to come up with an answer. The given information suggests that a driver is more likely to be involved in an accident if they are under the influence, in a hurry, or are distracted by other issues. Since the question involves a driver committing an accident because of the kind of driving they do, the given information suggests that that the driver will be distracted, under pressure, or will be in a hurry while driving.\n\nA. However, if the driver is stressed, they might also be under pressure to get to something important, which would require them to drive quickly. This would explain the choices of B and C.\n\nIf a driver was distracted by other problems they were thinking about, they might be more likely to be in a hurry to get to their destination since they will want to focus on other things. This also explains the choices of D and E (for drivers who are speeding and distracted).

This means that Jack and Mike are not going to build the shelf by themselves. Jack and Mike are going to build the shelves together. Therefore, in this question, Susan is the person who is not helping with building the shelf. She is just supervising the process.\nAlso, the question reads that Jack needs 8 inch boards. This is because Mike and Jack are the ones building the shelf. They are measuring out the boards (8 inch) equally and constructing the shelf. Therefore", "answer": "B: dangerous"}

Therefore, the total $ you can receive is the total number of the bananas you ate. \n\nHence, the total $ is 26 or twenty-six. Then, it is clear that $26 is your total payment. \n\nFinally, the brother said that he will give you one dollar for each banana you ate.

The six-carbon gluose molecule also provides the body proteins from amino acids with basic nitrogen and carbon atoms with four and five carbon chains. In manufacturing, carbon is broken into smaller units so that the materials needed for manufacturing can be used as basic feedstocks. \n\nCarbon atoms in plants are absorbed through the roots. These six-carbon atoms are broken down by processes known as respiration where energy is transferred to other biomolecules. These biomolecules include starch, fats, and sugars. In plants, carbon is absorbed through the roots and is broken down to provide energy for plants and animals.

There are a lot of options to choose from but the only one that actually involves a physical process involving wood is Carve. The other options are nail, polish and eat cake. Nail and polish has zero to do with wood but carving involves using scissors or saws to create shapes on the wood that is why it is most suitable for wood since wood already has a physical form. Thus Carve is the only option that could be a correct answer.\n\n### Answer: A\n\n### Demosration: Answer: D (we need to find the largest natural number that fits the given problem. If you can't find a number that fits the given problems then you should chose the last option)\n1. 8.7/2 = 4.35\n2. Average is 1.05\n3. 350/3 = 116.7 (Answer: B)\n\n### Answer : C\n\n### Rationale: \n1. 3/10 = 0.30 (Deduct)\n2. Average = 9/2 = 4\n\n### Answer A\n\n### Rationales: The first thing is to find out the average amount of time allotted to each group. The amount of time allotted is found by dividing the total allotted minutes (850) by the number of groups (3). This is done by 850/3 = (850*100)/3 = 283.33.\n\nNext, each group is allowed to use 100 minutes on each group for the three groups. So, the total allotted times for each group is 300 minutes.\n\nTherefore, each group has to complete their task within 300 minutes divided by the amount of allotted minutes per group (850 divided by 3). This is done be dividing 300 by 850, which equals 0.35 = 35%.\nTherefore, each of the groups will have 35% of 300 minutes to complete their task.\nAnswer:", "answer": "A: nailed"}

In step 4, an answer is presented and it tells you to find a missing number like it was something the computer was going to count.  Because the description talks about numbers we can assume the task is finding numbers.\nIn step 5, the board is mentioned in the same way as step 1, so it is not yet a thing. But in step 6, it is stated that there are 100 squares/triangles in the second picture where there were none in the first. This tells us that the computer has counted the board in the second picture and knows about it. So we are going to assume by step 7 that the board is a two-dimensional computer generated shape with at least 2 dimensions.\nWhen step 2 says you need a command, the computer is probably waiting for the command \u201cDraw\u201d which you should not give. \n\n### Input\nWhat is one number that is more than twice as big as the other?\n\n### Rationales.\n\nOnce again, there is not enough information until step 3 which tells you a number is missing.  Because you need to find the numbers, you can guess they are positive integers or whole numbers.", "answer": "C: race track"}

{"text": "A\n\n1. Train station - trains need to stop at a train station as passengers need to get off the trains. Trains also need to stop in the station as they need to do some maintenance checks, such as checking the train wheels, or passengers who are still on the train need to alight from the train. Hence, trains must stop at the train station, passengers who are boarding or alighting at the train station must disembark and enter the train station. Thus, all the train passengers who are embarking and alighting the train must enter the train station, which means the air in the train station has been breathed by all train passengers within the same day. Hence, train station must have been the place where air has been breathed by the passengers within the same day and where air has been breathe by few people recently.\n\n2. Since the houses are not a public place, passengers from various stations will not have the access to enter into the houses.\n\n3. Cupboards are also not a public place. Only the owners of the cupboard and the home owners will have access to enter into the cupboard, not the passengers of the public transport.\n\n4. Cricket stadium - people will go to the cricket stadium during public holidays or weekends when there are big matches happening. Only if it is a weekday and it is not a holiday, may there be cricket matches happening in the cricket stadium. Hence, during working days and weekdays, very few people will come to the cricket stadiums at the same day. Therefore, cricket stadiums must have been the place which air has been breathed mainly by a few people.\n\n5. Surface of earth - The surface of earth is mainly covered by the land and the oceans. People usually only ride the trains and travel to their workplace, which may consist of only a short distance. Hence, they will get off the train and go to their places of work. They are all located in areas, such as their cities, which are in close proximity to one another. Hence, these people are from within the area, which means they stay and reside in their own area.

How much sun will have to shine on the solar system to produce as much power as one gallon of gasoline holds?\nRationales\n\nThe first thing that we must do is determine how large 1 gallon is.\nSince 1 gallon is 3.79 liters, we need to multiply 1 by 3.79 to get the correct answer.\nBecause we have a 100 watt system, we know that there are 100 w of energy that this system can produce per liter.\n\nNext, since there is a 150 watt system, there are 150 w of energy that must be produced from each gallon.\n\nTherefore, we need to multiply this times the number of gallons, 3.79, to find out how many kilowatts, or kW, we need.\n\nSolving for (3.79 * 150) - (100 * 1) gives w =134 kW.\nThis means that the solar system needs to produce 134 kilowatts of energy to be as efficient as 1 gallon.\nAnswer: 3000 liters\n\nInput: How much change would you receive if you had a $20 bill and a $5 bill?\nDemostration:\n\nAnswers: 80\nInput: A 5-pound bag of flour costs about $6.

You can get students to look at a problem and break it down into steps. You can get students who are used to solving the same problem on their own to figure out what is missing. You can get students engaged in an activity to ask each other what methods they may use to solve and then discuss as a group if they are appropriate or not. You can get students not always thinking the same way to figure out as a group which of their techniques work and which don\u2019t.\n\nI personally like the way they do problem-based learning in the STEAM camp. In this camp, they have a lesson on problem-solving with legos. The first day is all about learning how to apply the methods of STEAM to all other problems in our life.

I like to organize my coins by color. The first color I start with is orange. How many coins are orange, and how many are green?\nRationales\nGiven:\n\n1. I have a collection of 80 dimes and 50 nickels.\n\n2. I like to organise my coins by colour.\n\n3. Orange is the first colour I start with.\n\nGoal\nFind two values for the number of orange coins and the number of green coins (to two decimal places, if necessary)\nTo reach this goal, we need to find two values for the number and to organize them by their colours. 1. To find the number of orange copper we can divide the 80 dime by 2 to get 40, and the 50 nickel by 2 to get to 25. 2. To find the number od green copper we can divided the rest of the coins into a group by noting that 120 = 80 + 50, and we can then divide 80 by 2 to get two sets again, so this mean 80 is the set of four. Therefore, 25 + 80 is the group of 105 for orange copper, and 105/2 is the group of 53 for green copper.\nWe have reached our goal, and we will now organize them into colours to find their number. This is done by looking the dime of copper and the second half of nickel.\nSo, we have 40 dime and 25 nickel for the orange colour, while we have 40 nickel and 53 dime for the green colour. \nAnswer:\nA: Orange 750312 Green 053912\n\n\n## Instruction Complete the following task.\n\n\n### Instructions: Answer the following multiple choice question with a rational answer.\n\nDetailed solution:\n\n\nThere are 38", "answer": "D: carpenter's shop"}

If she spent a total of $10, what was the average price of each bag of sugar she bought?\n### Rationales:In order to find out the average price of sugar, we first need to know how many bags she bought. She bought 20 baggage of sugar. Now, we need to find the total sum of money she spent on the bags. So, she spent $8 on 5 bags and $1 on 15 bags. Therefore, her total sum of money spent is $18. So, the total number of bags she bought is $18/$20 = 12.5. However, we will round down since the answer must be an integer.\nThe average number of bags she can purchase is therefore calculated by dividing $10 by 12.5, which is equal to $1.17.\nAnswer: 7.81\n\n### Input:\"Every time you recycle something, there is a 5% chance that you will receive a bonus of $15,\" says Jane.

Add an extra cheese to each of the 5 pizzes that are extra-cheesy, and that costs us an extra $0.50 per pizza. \nThus, we get for each of the 5 extra-cheesey pizzas; 5 x $0.50 = $2.50\n\nIn total, we have 5 pizzas that are extra-cheesey. \n\nNext let's add on the cost of making pizzas extra-saucy. We add extra sauce to 5 additional pizzas and we need to multiply how much the sauce cost on each of the 5 saucy pizzas, which is $0.50. \nTherefore, we get\n5 x $0.25 = $1.25\n\nIn total, there are three extra-saucey pizzas.\n\nFinally let's add up the cost of making all the pizzas. \nFirst, how much does it cost to make a non-cheesey, non-saucy pizza? \nWell, that is how much one regular pizza costs when it has no additional che", "answer": "E: celebrating"}

Thus we know the first box weighed 12 ouncis plus or minus 4, and it weighed 15 less than we did of the second, so we will say that that second box weighed 18 plus or minus 4.

So $P$ will be $10$ because Molly is spending $100 for a whole pizza. \n\nFor the second part of the equation, we will replace $R/100$ with $T/6$ because Molly will be given $6$ total tips for her entire pizzeria stay.

{"text": "A = grape\n\n### Detailed Solution\n\nThis is a tough question involving English words and context. The question does not ask us directly about grapes, but about what \"one\" does to a grape. We need to figure out what the word \"one\" means here, and how it could be describing the activity of using the word \"chop.\"\n\nLet's start by looking at the context and seeing if we can figure out what is going on there. We're going to have to find a little subtext here. \"One grape\" implies more than one grape, as we're talking about one grape as opposed to the singular. In addition, the word \"chopping\" is also not used in a precise way. It could imply that the person is using the word \"chopping,\" as in, the kind of work chopping does. In doing so, let's assume that the definition of \"chopping\" is \"chopping up grapes for jam,\" since that seems to fit with the text.\n\nWe know from the context that the word \"one\" cannot be referring to the use of an object to chop the grape, since we are being told that there can be \"more than one grape.\" So what did the person use to chop the graps? We know that the person was using the word \"chopped,\" which means they used an object. That leaves us with the choice between using an object (A) or using an action (B, C, and D). So our choices are limited to one of the following:\n\n* using a knife (which is being used to cut a grape),\n* using hands (which would be chopping the grape),\n* placing them in a fruit basket, and\n* creating a cocktail from the grapes (which would include a lot, including many fruit cocktails).\n\nThat leaves us with the following possibilities:\n\n* A: fresh fruit (using a knife to cut a grape)\n* B: wine press (using the action of hands to smash grapes)\n* C: fruit basket (placing the grape in a basket)\n* D: fruit cocktails (using the grape to create fruit cocktails)\n\nIn all four cases, the same number of choices remains viable in the fourth option", "answer": "D: fruit cocktail"}

{"text": "> The fast but expensive way to transport small cargo is on a truck.\n\n### Rationales:\n* The quickest way of transporting cargo, irrespective of size, is flying using airplane or helicopters. That is not an option, hence only D is possible.\n* Only trains, not trucks. Only a plane, not a truck or boat.\n* The only answer not mentioned in this prompt is ship's hold, which can transport cargo of various sizes, but is not limited to a certain size of cargo.\n\n### Explanation:\n* The quick answer to this problem would go like this: Boxes come in different sizes\n* The fastest way to send such cargo, irrespective is by plane or helicopter\n* Therefore, the answer must be option D\n\n### Examples:\n* Answer: D\n* In this scenario, if you were to send a medium cargo, the obvious answer would be truck (in most cases - there are exceptions). But this is not the case here where the cargo is the biggest one available. In such case the only way to send it quickly over a long distance is by truck or airplane.\n* Another scenario: The largest cargo is a ship. In this case we will not consider a boat or truck as we cannot transport ships via boat or truck! This leaves us with only plane and train as options.

Which kind of bait should you use twice?\nD) minnows\n\n### Rationale:\nWhen it is time to make choices, there are a bunch of options, and each of these options has advantages. One of the choices, however, may be so much better than the rest\u2014and having this better option lets you eliminate all the others. The rest become redundant, so there is no point in even considering them. This is why you should use minnows twice\u2014it is the best option, and eliminates the need to consider any others. \n\n### ResponseC:\n### Rational:\nMice would be the best option to apply to two of the bait stations because mice do not have the strongest sense of smell, and instead, have a stronger sense of taste. This means that this type of food would be the most appealing to them which would increase the probability that mice would go for them.\n\n### RessionE:\n### Ration:\nThere should be a limit to the number of times you eat at home, but as for how often it should be, that is up for you to decide. But, more importantly, it would be better to cook your own food as it can make you feel more nourished and healthy than from eating fast food which can have preservatives.\n\n### Summary \n\n-", "answer": "D: socialize"}

Luckily, an internet search told me that a testicle is a gland (male hormone or steroid) of an animal and swelling of this could be due to infection.  It was even referenced as testicle swelling.  I feel that that's what John had and not a manhood related gland problem.\n\nAnswer:\n![](/Images/Testicle.png)\n\n### Demand:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\n## Demonstration: Input:The average time it takes to complete an online purchase of a new camera is 10 minutes and the average time it takes to get a new camera is 45 minutes. In an hour, 6 people will purchase online and 2 people will buy in person. In a day, how many people will purchase a camera overall?(For help, see the image below.)\nRationales: I know that the average time it takes people to get a new camera, in person is 45 min.\nSecondly, I also know that the average time to complete an online order of a camera is 10 min.\nThirdly, I know that 90 min is the total time it takes to complete all orders of cameras of the day, whether it was by online stores or In person stores.\n\nSince the answer is 90 min and the people will complete 46 orders (because 6 people will complete 11 orders a day), we can calculate the average number of orders per person. To find out, we multiply the number of orders with the answer 46. However, since not every order is completed in a day, we have to divide the number of orders by the 90 min average. This gives us the average number of orders (46) per person.\n(30 min per completion/46 orders) = 0.67 orders per person on average.\nSo, each person will complete 0.67 of the orders on average per day. This means that one person will (30 min/46 orders)*1 = 0.65 orders, therefore 3 individuals are expected to complete at least one order each day.\n\nI understand I may miss a step or think", "answer": "D: agony"}

Choice A isn't correct because waterfalls aren't underwater. The phrase three quarters refers to water underneath the surface.\n\nChoice B is however correct because the ocean is covered in water.

If 380 students were enrolled in Algebra 1, how many of them had a perfect 100%?\n\n### Demostration\nGiven:\n\n380 students were in the class\n\nThe average was 80%, this means the mean was 380/2 = 190\n\nThe median was 82%, this means the median was 190/2 = 95, thus 82%, which 82 is below the mean.\n\nFirst, calculate the percentage difference between the average and the median. Dividing the 10% difference between the average and median by 10, we get 10% = 190 - 95 /10 = 10%\n\nNext, multiply 10 by the number of students in the class, so 10% * 380 = 10 * 380 is 3800 by 10% is 380.\n\nThus the number of people that had a perfect 12% was 380.", "answer": "D: theater"}

If you want to get a good seat, then getting a better value is a good idea.\nYou can answer A, B, C, or D.\nFirst, we need the cost. The cost for the church is $10. Then, if we know the seats are $5 a piece, the value will be five times 5, or 25.\nWe can also do the same for a conference. The same price of $10 will go back into the discount value but the quantity will be the same as the seats, so it will still be 25.\nThe theater comes in the same way but the seats will be 35.\nFinally, the last one is the building. The price of $20 gives us 250 as the value, which is more than the other three options.\n\n### Additional Explanation:The first option is for the church. The price of $10 goes all the way into the cost of $25 so the discounted value will be $15.\nThe second option will result in the same discount value, which is $15.\nOption three gives you over $1 million but under $3 million. This means that you will get more for the money.\nFinally, when you are offered one more ticket for the same price of $20, this equals the discounted value of $15, which is the same as the other two options.\nThus, I recommended choosing option two as the best option for $25 dollars.\nThe third option gives good value, but not as good as the other three.\n\n### Task: Answer the following multiple choice question\n\n### Demand: The price of theater tickets changes as the number of seats sold changes. Given:\n\nPrice of ticket $20\n\nIf 20 seats sold  $190\n\nIf 15 seats sold  $420\n\nIf  10 seats sold  $360\n\n25 seats sold  $200\n\n\n### Response\nPrice of ticket $19\nAnswer: $29,900\n\n### Demands: Answer", "answer": "B: theater"}

I have 96 black ones that aren't broken, along with 30 blue, 4 green, 9 brown, and 105 pink ones that aren't. How many crayons do I have left?\nRationales\n1. First, we are going to count the crayon we have. Then, we are going to subtract the broken crayons from 544 ct. So, 544-77=-467\n2. Next, we are going to remove the numbers we have and the numbers we don't from 467. So, we will count the numbers (96-), (30-), (4 -), and (105-). So, we will get 230 =467\n3.

How many tablespoons must there be in each 2 liters?\n\n### Rationales:\n\nIdea 1:The most basic technique I use for this question type is the division method.\n\nStep 1: We start off by figuring out how many tablespoons are in each 2 liter. We know that each 2 liter contains 20 tablespoon and we need to figure out how many times 2 liters is by 20 tablespooons\nThen we have 2 (2 tablespoons in each 2 litres) \u00d7 T (how many times the multiplication must repeat) = T tablespoons in a 2 litre drink\n\nStep 2: Once we get our answer we set T (20 tablespoons in each bottle) = T (how many times we need to repeat the multiplication). Then we can start working on solving.\n\nStep 3: We do not need to solve the equation directly for T, so we could also just solve it by trial and error. For example trial and error could be something like:\n\nTrial 1: T = 0.18 x2 (in order to solve 2T as the same as T)\nTrial 2: T=0.9 x2(in order to solve 10T)\nTrial 3:T=5x2(in order to 10T \u2248 40T\nTrial 4:T=4 (in order to solve the final equation 4T = 20T)\n\nOutput: This solution may seem tedious, but it works and I have found it to be very effective for any questions asking for the division method.", "answer": "E: wave on"}

What is the ratio of people with the free coupons to people who got tickets?\n\n\n### Rationales:\nWe need to find the ratio of people with free coupons to people with tickets. This is given by the total number of people with the free snack coupon who also have tickets to the movie, divided by the total number of tickets sold.\nSince there are 5 snack coupon-holders for every 10 audience members, the formula for finding the free snack coups for a ticketed audience is\n$$\\frac{\\text{free coupons that holders are also holders at} }{ \\text{Total tickets sold}}$$\n\nDividing this total by 10, we get the ratio of those with the free coupon to the total tickets sold.

(the \"they\" in reference to 46 and its relatives)\n\nA: Yes B: No C: None of Your Business\n\n### Rationale:\nThe answer to question 1 will be \"No\" since \"46\" (the number 46) does not belong to our family.\n\nThe answer to question number 2 will be none of your business, if 46 does not have a sibling or cousin who is also \"46\".\n\"They\" in question number 4 refers to \"46\" and its relatives. The first number that refers to \"46\u2019s\" immediate family is \"84\" (the number that is one more than 46). This is because \"46\" is the only number in the family that has a \"4\" as the first digit. The number 84 is one digit greater than the first digit in \"46\" (i.e., there is a 6 between the number 84 and the first digit in 46). Thus, 84 is the first number that belongs to \"46's\" immediate family.\n\n46 has a sibling and sibling(s) have both a first name and last name. So, \"84\" is the first immediate-family number that has \"46\" as a middle name. It is not part of \"46's,\" immediate family (a.", "answer": "D: take money"}

She needs 10 lemons and 15 strawberries. She wants to use 100 ml lemon juice and 100 mg strawberry juice. If 100 mL will make 4 jars of jam, how many jars of jam will Betty be able to make?\nRationales Betty wants to make jam using 100 m L lemon juice and strawberry juice with a ratio of 100 m to 100 m, respectively. And Betty wants to use 1 jar of jam for every 100 m of juice. If Betty uses 100 M of lemon juice, then 100 M will make 4 jams.\nBetty needs 10 lemongrass, 15 strawberry and wants to use 1 ml lemon juices and 1400 mg stawberry juices.\nWe know 1mL = 1/100 mL. And 100/100 m = 1 kg. Then, 99mL = 99/100m L = 1 ml. And 1400/10 mg strawberries is 14 kg.\nIf we substitute 99 m L and 14 kg, we get 99 mL = 1 jar of jam and 14 kg = 100 mgs.\nSo, if Betty uses 1 ml leemon juice and 1350 kg strawberry juices, she will be able to make 1 jams\nAnswer: 10\n\n### Input and Response:\n\n> Input: A beaver can destroy a machine's functionality if they build their dump in this?

{"text": "Answer:Jewish Community\n\n### Demo:\nInput: A farmer is planning to plant a field of onions. She has to figure out how many onions to plant, on a per-acre basis. She will receive $20 per acre for planting a whole acre. If half the acre is a failure (not planted, or doesn't grow properly), the farmer will also receive $50 for half the acre. If all the onions are a success and grow to full maturity, she will receive an additional $20 per 16 onions. If half of the onions are a failure, she will also get an extra $10 per onion that fails. If all the onion on the half acre is a perfect crop and ready to harvest, she would also get $25 per 16 onion of that half. If half of those onions failed for any reason, she gets $10 per onions that failed. If one half acre is a failure and the other half is a winner, what is the farmer's earnings?\nRationales:\\\nIn order to determine this we first have to determine how many plants she would have to have in her field (planted or not) if it will result in an earning of $25 for a successful crop, and $20 for a less than successful crop. Since these will be plants of the same kind, there will be an equal number of plants whether the crop is a success or not, so $25/plant = $20/plant so she would have to have a total of $25/20 = 1.25 plants per acre.\n\nFor the first acre to end up a winner, we must plant 1.25 times 25 which would be 31.25 plants. Then, half of those will succeed and so she will get 15.625 plants that are a success.\n\nThen there will be some that will fail so half of those will fail which would be 7.8125 plants.\n\nTo calculate the profits from her 15.606347 successful harvest, we must add the $25 for those and divide that by 15.6 which would be $1.58 for each of", "answer": "C: middle east"}

In the word, we have the letter 'a'. So we can say that lack of money can`t be the right choice, the other option is stress. Next we come to the letter 't' and again, we get'stress'. The third letter is 'a', it can be another type of stress (emotional / stress about family), and this time we can write 'e' or's' if 'exhilarating' is selected. The fourth letter makes us go to 'i', what could it be? 'i'n means that? The fifth letter also starts with 'i'. 'i'n means 'in', which we haven`t used yet. So, if this person is suffering from stress, then the option that fits is 'a' which is stress. However, this word can be stress relief, that should fit the letter 'r', so it comes down to one more word,'relieve'. Then we get to the 'p's, 'p' is a stress relief option, so now the only letters we need are 'u' and 'e'. 'U' is a choice when you are excited about something, so this time the letter 'v' fits. This person can be exhilirated, we have the right letter, but we haven`t used 'i' yet. This leads us to the word, 'v'i'lated.

You have a budget of $30 that you can spend. One item costs $1, and another costs $3. You need five items. How many of each type of item can you buy? Your grocery store only sells the 2 items in this game.\n\nRationales:  We need to buy enough so that we meet our budget, but not go over the budget. \n\nTo get our first item, we need to work out, \"How much should we put in the first item?\" \nSo if we spend $10 on the first item, that means we have $20 left over. \nThen, how much should we add to the second item?\nIf we spend $10 to cover 5 items - that is, we would spend $50, so we have $30 left over after paying for 4 items. So $30 / 4 = $7.50 per item.\n\nIf we split that budget between 1 item and 2 items, we will spend $7.50 on the first item we buy, and $6.75 for the second item.\n\nInput:  You have a bag that can hold 4 apples in a single layer.

Since the mixed number can be 1 + 123, we need to find 1 in the whole number area and 123 in the fractional area. To find these numbers, we add the digits of the numbers (1 + 1 + 2 + 3) and multiply them with 4 (4 * 1 = 4, 4 *123 = 502). Next, we add this number to the number to the right of the divisor (whole number area). To do this, we move 502 to the right after the decimal symbol.\n\nThe result is 502.0000.\n\n### Rationales:Next, we need to plug in divisor and dividend into the division symbol: 502.\n\n#### 502 / 1\n\nNow we have:  502.", "answer": "B: home"}

{"text": "C\n\n### Input\nInput: It takes a certain kind of food to grow into a large animal. This food is expensive, so your parents will buy it for you when they have money. If you spend $60 on a certain kind of food, that means you spent too much money. If you spend less than $60 on the food, that is still too much money for your parents to pay. The food is $1 a unit. \n \nRationales: First, the family collects a certain kind of food. Dividing one unit cost of the food by six, we can find out how many units the family has collected. So, 1/6 units = 0.166 units.\nNext, we need the number of times the family must spend $1 to make the $60, which is $60/1 = 60 times. Because of this, we need to multiply the number of units collected (0.166) by 60 to find out how many times the family must spend the $1 that would equal $60. So, 0.16 x 60 = 10.4.\nTo sum up, we would spend $10.4 times on food, which is $10.4 x $1 = $10.4. However, we have collected a total of 0.16 units that would cost $1.60. Multiplying 0.16 with $1 will cost $0.16. Subtracting $0.16 from $10.4 will leave $10.24, which is the amount of how much the family has to pay, and that is also $60\nAnswer: 10.24\n\n### Instructions:The following questions are based on the passage that follows.

Therefore, the answer must be one of the other four options. Let's start with B, because it is an object that is not in a weapon. This means B and E are both good choices, so we don't know yet if their meanings are good. Let's try out C. This is a weapon. Therefore, C is wrong.\nNext we need to check E.

Since weapons are already incorrect, that leaves us with:\nA: battle fields or\nD: cannons. \nA means a battle field.

{"text": "A\n\n### Demostration:\nThe correct answer to this question is A. Africa is located in the southern hemisphere of the earth, and since the earth is divided into two equal hemispheres, one in the northern hemisphere and one in the southern hemispheres, all of africa is located in the southern Hemisphere.\n\nBecause of the rotation of the earth, northern hemisphere continets are located around the North Pole and the southern hemisphere continents are located around the South Pole. If the South Pole was covered with snow, the North Pole would be covered, and therefore, all of the globe would be covered with snow.\n\nCanada is in the northern hemispher of the earth. Therefore, if it is snowing in canada, it must be either the north pole in the north hemisphere or the south pole in the south hemisphere.\n\nThe surface of earth is located throughout the entirety of the planet and therefore, cannot be considered to always have snow at any given time.\n\nDue to the rotation of earth, the north pole can be covered with snow. Therefore, because the entire north pole is covered with it snow, the entire globe would have snow.\n\n### Question:\n\nHow many 3-digit numbers have a sum less than 20?\n\n### Response\n\n962\n\n### Demotion:\nFirst we need to find all the 3-digit numbers less than 20.\n\nNext we need to find their sum.\nThe first 3-digit number is:  003, which sums to 3\nThe second 3-digit number:  105 sums to 6\nThe sum of the first and second 3 digit numbers is 9 plus 6 which sums to 15.\nContinue with the next three digit numbers 114 which sums to 19. 116 which sums to 25. 123 which sums to 39.\nThe sum of all the 3 digit numbers is: 3+6+15+19+25+39=96+2.\n\n## A\n\n### Input\nA bag contains 4 red and 6 green socks. 5 red socks and 3 green socks", "answer": "B: north pole"}

{"text": "The priest wanted to stop recalcitrant behavior.\n\n### Rationale:\n\nThe only synonyms for recalcitrant are liberal, heretical, conservadox, and heretical. We can immediately rule out heretical because it is an antonym of orthodox. Conservadox is an inaccurate term for a behavior, so we can rule it out as well. Heretical and liberal do not match the behavioral requirements. Finally, we are left with orthodox and recalcitrant, which makes most sense as orthodoxy is a synonym for behavior that follows the rules and adheres to what is orthodox. Behavior that does not follow these rules is referred to as recalcitrant, making this the best choice.\n\n### Additional:\n\n1. [Source](https://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/conservadox)\n2.

{"text": "### Answer:\nAnswer: A\n\n### Instructions:\n\n### Demostration:\n\nInput: A tank of nitrogen holds 11 million litres of nitrogen. If 1.25 million litres of nitrogon is used each month, how long will the tank keep gas flowing continuously? Rationales: The first thing we need to do is to calculate how many litres are used in a month. To do this, we can do the following calculation: (1.25 million)/(11 million) = 0.11\nThat means, the capacity of the tank of nitrogen is 0.11 times (11 million), which is 1.265 million litres. Once we have found this, we need to subtract the tank\u2019s starting capacitiy of litres. In this case, the starting capacity of nitrogen is of the tank is 11 million, so we need to subtract that number. (12.65 million - 11 million) = (1.65 million)\nNow, we need to calculate how long the tank can fuel gas flowing continuously. To do this, subtract the starting amount from the amount used per month. This means (1.65 millions - 1.25 millions equals 0.40 million. So, at this rate, the tank can fuel gas for 0.40 months or 30 days.\n\nAnswer: 30 days\n\n### Input A:If I have to do one-third of a job in six hours, how many other hours do I need to do the job?

Solution:\n\n1. We multiply each term on the left hand side by x.\n\n2. Multiplying, we get 4x(x - 12)(x - 9).\n\n3. Then, we group the numbers together. We can see that there are three 4-values, which we can cancel.\n\n4. So, the equation becomes (x - 12) \u22c5 (x - 9). \n\n5. Then, we factor out (x - 13), since that is a factor of both terms.\n\n6.

I'm beauty's uglines I'm the very stuff of nightmares.\"\n\n### Input\"The monster didn't like that.  The monster didn't love me. The monster screeched me from the mountain top.\"\nThe question is referring to the fact that the monster was angry at the beauty because the beauty told him that he wasn't loved by her. \nThe sentence \"The monster said I should be loved\" supports the prompt, as it indicates that the monster said what should love him; \"I should\" is present tense, implying that the monster was currently not loved and wants to be loved.\n\n### InputChoice : A\n### InputChoice: B\n### InputChoice D\n### Reponse Choice: D\n### Justification:\"I should be loved, she said.

Red (0.1)\n2. Green (0.3)\n3. Blue (0.0)\n\n#### Step1 : 10R\n1. Red (2.0)\n\n### Response :\nIn the problem, the probability of selecting a marble is calculated by using a tree diagram. For a given set of total marbles and selecting 5, the probability of selecting 1 marble is 1/1 because it happens only 1 time and this is because there is 1 marble remaining. The probability of selecting 2 marbles is 2/3 because there is a total of 3 times, that's 2 times and the last time. (1-1 + 2-2 + 3-3).\nThe probability of selecting 3 marbles is 3/5 because there is a total 5 times of the chance where there are 3 times of choosing 3 marbles each and 2 times of choosing 2.

{"text": "C: John will avoid going to woodland because there could be animals such as rabbits or dogs being abused there.\n\n### Rationale:\nTo figure out where John won't go, the key is to identify the reasons that cause john to avoid going to certain places. Since john likes animals and hates animal abuse, he will avoid places that could possibly be involved with animal abuse.  The first question asks where john would avoid going. The answer to this question is C: woodland, because there are high probabilities that at this place they might be abusing animals such as rabbits and dogs. To explain why he will be avoiding woodland, we would need to know what exactly john like or hates.  For john to avoid going woodland, it must be that john will only pick places that does not involve animal abuse. Therefore, the possible choices would be A (pet store), B (parking lot), D (north america), and E (park) because there are no animals involved in these places. Thus, John will always avoid going to woodland.\n\n\n### Input\nHow many gallons of gas does Mr. P's car get when it has a tank full?\n\n### Rationales\nThe car can be described as a cylinder with a pump-like mechanism that injects gas into the container while moving, a car needs to have 8 gallons of gas in order to get a tank full, 8 gallons is the capacity of the container, and each gallon has 0.0078246592 gallons, 8 * 0.0067846592 = 0.02058470648 gallons/gallon. \n\n### Input2:\nMr. M's car has a gallons of gas in it according to the gas station attendant when he bought a gallon gallons of gas, how many more gallons can be added to completely fill the tank?\n\n### Answer2:\nMr.M's car has 2 (gallons of gas) in it, 2/8 = 0.25, 20.584708 * 0.25 = 5.149546\n\n###", "answer": "A: pet store"}

Each campsite is allowed 1 blanket and 2 tent poles per camper, but each camper is also required to bring his own sleeping bag and ground tarp. Why is this campsite set up this way? Choices:  Tent poles B: Blankets C: Sleeping bags D: Ground tarps\n\n### Response\nE\n### Demonstarion:The campsites are setup this way because each campsite is allowed one blanket and two tent poles per campsite, but each camper must bring their own sleeping bag and tent poles as well. This leads to a conflict because if each camper brought their own tent poles, there would be enough blankets for everyone and vice versa if each camper brought a sleeping bag. Instead, they will now have to camp without a blanket or a tent pole in order to allow everyone to bring their items. This also solves the problem that having to bring a blanket might mean having to take more tent poles than allowed, which could lead to tent poles being in short supply if campsites have too many people.\n\n### Input\nThe 4th grade football team wants to make a banner for the big state champion game.

Because it takes 1 second to press each button, the time is up with each 2, and 3 is pressed simultaneously.

After the time is up, she presses the button 3, and 4, which takes more than 2 seconds. Because it takes more than 3 seconds for that person to press the next 3 buttons, she presses the 4 button more than 1 second. For the 5) button, the person is pressing the button for more than 2 seconds, because it takes more than 1 second to press one button, and she pushes the 5 button for more than 1 second, so she presses the button more than 3 seconds.

It's the dead of winter and the thermometer shows 12 degrees Fahrenheit. Your car starts to jerk and shudder. It only gets worse. You see the red engine-temperature light up on the dash panel, and you hear a whine from the motor.  How long before your engine overheats?\n\n### Response-Demonstration\n\nThe input is a sequence of the following terms: - open road, the middle of the country, 12 degrees F, dead of winter, thermal meter, and car. We can use this knowledge to determine the next two terms required, since we have the temperature of the driver already and the word shudder. Using this information, we now are able to determine that the words engine, radiator, and coolant will follow next.  All of these will be used to figure out the answer.\n\nThe word coolant contains the information that the radiator has already reached the minimum temperature and the engine is about to fail. From here, we are able to know that the words red light, hot, and steam are to follow next. In the diagram, the red engine temperate light means that the engine is not performing in its usual way and steam is needed to fix the problem. If no water reaches the engine, however, then the engine will overheat.\n\nIf the water reaches the engine before the red light lights up, then the engine will work as it should. From this, we can determine that the word cool is next to follow. If that sequence could happen, then the engine would never overheat.\nThe sequence for the given information is: 12 degrees, dead of winter, red light, shudder, coolant, engine, red light, steam, cool.\nWith this information, we can determine the last terms using the diagram, which are red, lights, up, and overheat.\nAnswer: 3 minutes\n\n### Input:\"Squid head\" is an insult given to someone when they ask you for a good deal.", "answer": "C: torso"}

Afterwards, he places the apples and pears in a basket where he gets 6 apples and 6 pears. How many apples and pears are left on the tree?\n\nRationales: \n\nFirst, we need  to calculate how many apples and pear are there on the tree, but since we don\u2019t know the number of pears and apples we can assume that they are in the same position. So on the tree there are 5 pears and 5 apples.\n\nNext, the man picks 3 apples from the tree then 3 pears from the tree, we can only subtract 3 apples and 3 pears, this gives us 2 apples and 2 pears. \nWe know that the man puts the apples and pear in the basket, we have 6 apples and pears, 2 apples and pears subtracted so the final amount of apples and pears that is left on tree is 4. \n\n### Instructions:Answer these following fill in the blanks multiple-\u00adchoice questions.\nInput: Daisy buys 19 bananas and 16 oranges.

How much revenue did Daisy made that day\n\nRationales Apart from the numbers of fruit given at the start, our only information can be found in the price of fruit and the amount that is bought.\nWe know that she kept 17 bananas from her first basket and the other 16 bananas are in the basket that she made a fruit salad.

There are $6.41 worth of type 1 fruits and $13.59 worth of type 2 frui\u00adts. How much did all of the fruit cost?\nRationales First, we need to find the per pound cost of type 1 and 2 fruits. Since type 1 fruits are worth $6.41 and type 2 fruits are worth $13.50, we need to find what percentage and how many type 1 fruits cost per pound.\n\n$6.41 over $6.93*100 = 94.36%, which means that when 94.3 %(94.36%) of a pound of type 1 fruit is, the total worth will be $6.41. Therefore, each pound of type 2 fuit is worth $2.44 more than a pound of type1 fruit.\nWe also need to find out the quantity of type1 fruit. \n\n$6.93*0.9436*3=\n\n$6.50*3=\n\n\nSecondly using  type I and type II as our base, we simply multiply total money by type I and type II.\nIn total type I fruit was 3 and type II was 6 pounds,\nWe thus got\n\n$6.02*3+ 94.3*6.02+13.59*6\n\nThe cost of all the fruit =$15.16*3+174.09+92.01\n\n\n\n### Instructions:Follow the arrows in the graphic to complete the series of equations.\n\n### Response 1\n\n30,000/0.084 is 1502.34%\n\n20,902/0.0833 is 253.14\n\n250/0.02 is 12500%\n\n\\$(1000/0)+(-", "answer": "A: michigan"}

For these kind of questions, where the 5th is at the numerator (top) and denominator (bottom), we have the coefficient of x.\n\nIn this case because the 5th is in the denominator, it means we don't need the coefficient of x, so it must already be one.\n\nSecondly we need to multiply the coefficient of x with the base and power by our self-rule to multiply the variables. For bases of 4 and lesss, we multiply by our self-rule, which is x^3 = xx2, but for bases greater than 4 we use the rule which is x^n =x*x*(2*x)*...*(n*x).\n\nTherefore,  using the rule above, we have $6^5x^x = 6^5$.\n\nWe multiply $6^5$ by $6^5$ as this can result in any multiple of 81. In this case, $6^5 * 6^5 = 36^2 = 36*36 = 1296$, so the answer is $1296$.\nAnswer:", "answer": "A: accomplish"}

And thanks again for the time and effort that you put into giving me feedback. I really appreciate it. The response to the instruction says \"How do you know that the final number of Legob is 245?\"\n\nIt says \"You just subtract 5 from the total unused Legos\" because I don't know how to get from there to 245. I believe you said that you should use logic in my assignment 2 answer, if I remember correctly? In this case, it tells me to go from \"James used 250 Legob in total/500 + 250 = 500 - 5 = 495? Or something like that?\n\n### Another Response\n\n\nHello sir! I want to add that it's very interesting that you said to use logic in the answers for assignment 2 on the \"Filling the Boxes\" question. I would have loved to, but the text of the question does not ask me to do that. If you look at the question's last sentence, it says \"Then, we know that James is missing 5 Lego figures when he puts the Legos away, which is also 500 - (240+ 245).\" This does not imply that the question is to use logic. (I see that you removed it already, but it looks like I submitted this before you edited it. Sorry for the confusion.)\n\n\n\nHi Beta,\n\nI saw your response to my assessment of your paper. Thanks for the explanation.\n\nSo, when you subtract 5 from the 250, you don't get 495; you get 245. In your explanation and response, you left out that we have to take into consideration that this was 240+250 +245. What you did not add to 245 was 2", "answer": "A: fast food restaurant"}

{"text": "A\n\n### Input\n\nIn an 8-foot tall and 10-foot long garden, there are 35 roses. There are also 42 pink roses and 18 red roses which grow in the garden. The garden is 60 feet in length. How many pink and red roses are in the garden?\n\n### Response\n\n60 feet divided by 12 (feet) equals 5 feet. So 5 feet are required for each 8 foot tall and for every 10 foot long garden. Thus, three gardens of eight-foot height and ten-foot length are required for the 80 feet required for this garden. \nThus, there needs to be a total of 3 * 80 = 240 roses.\n\nThus 120 pink roses and for 120 red roses are in total.\n\n### Input B\n\nA bag contains 36 balls. 48 of the balls are yellow, 45 of the balls are black. 27 of the balls are green. How many greens balls were there in the bag initially?\n\n### Rationales\n\n\nWe need to know how many of the balls in the bag are green. Since, in total, 27 of the 36 balls are green, which means that 24 of the 36 are yellow and 23 are black.  \nSince every black ball can be replaced by 2 yellow balls, we will be able to account for the yellow balls when we consider the green balls.\n\nThus in total, there are 45 of the 48 yellow balls, so 48 of the 36 yellow balls, so 72 yellow balls in total.  So 4 green balls replaced 72 yellow balls, so 241 -  72 = 169 is the number of yellow balls in total. Then, 169 + 1 = 170 are the green balls in total.\n\nSo, the answer is 170.\n\n### C\n\n### Input A\n\nA bag contains two identical 100 dollar bills, three identical 50 dollar bills with the same serial number but different bills.

Therefore, if you are full of fear, you will be wet, as sweat causes the clothing to become wet.\n\n### Answer: B\n\n### Input\nBrian spends half his paycheck for each week and saves the other half. If he spends half his salary for each paycheck and saves half his paycheck for six consecutive paychecks. How much money will be in his savings six months later?\n\n### Demostration\nWe can solve this problem with the formula:\n\nY = Y + Amount of income spent - Amount of income saved per cycle.\n\nIn this step, we need to write the equation we need to solve. This is done by simply stating the first step where Brian spends half his pay each week, which means he spends $400 in total per month (the total amount Brian earns per month).\nThe next step involves what we need to find out. To find out how much money will be saved after six months, we need to multiply the $400 he spends per month with the amount of times he spends half a week's pay to find the total amount. Since he spends half, and we know it is in an amount of $400, the total dollar savings he adds to his account at the end of the six months will be $2000.\nWe also need to know how long he saves the money for and when he withdraws the money after he saves for six months, which brings him to the end of the cycle. After each cycle, he saves half of his salary, which is $200, and spends the other half which is $20, making his total savings of $200 on each cycle.\n\nTo find out the answer to this problem, we multiply the dollars he saved ($200) times the number of times he saves the money after each cycle (the amount of cycles he saves) and then we subtract that from the total dollar savlings ($2000) which gives us the total amount of money left in his account after six months ($1800).\n\nAnswer: $1800.\n\n### Input \nWrite a", "answer": "E: urinate"}

Then by dividing this result by 3, we find that 3x \u00f7 3 = 2x. Brianna sold 2x stickers.\nWe can determine how many stickers she sold in total by using a simple equation.\n3x + 2x = 6x, which can be written as 5x = 6x - 3x.

{"text": "The right answer is not D, the answer is: A.\n\n### Task: Which expression is equivalent to the sum of 7/8, 9/15, and 2/5?\n\n### Demanded:\nInput: 4/5 is equivalent to: 1/10 + 1/20 + 1/100\n\n### Response(s):\nThis riddle requires you to compare the expression to the solution. There are a total of 15 terms in the fraction, where 4 is divided by 5. A simple way to think about how to solve these types of problems is to first convert the fraction to its equivalent mixed fraction, and then to continue simplifying it.\n\nA mixed fraction can also have the form: N/M, where the integer is added with a decimal (the fraction). In this case, the equation is 4/5. The number 4 will act as the numerator, while 5 will act as the denominator. The mixed fractions can now be seen as 4/5, 4/5, and 4/5.\n\nHere are the steps to simplify these mixed fractions:\n\n1. First, note that there isn't any number before the decimal in any mixed fraction.\n\n2. Next, simplify as much as possible to get to the numerator and denominator in simplest form.\n\n3. Then, put the fractions into lowest terms. This means that we will compare the numerators and denominators to look for fractions where the numerator and denominators have the lowest factor. For example, 3/4 has the lowest factor of 2, so we will subtract 2/4 from 3/4 to get the answer. 1/4.\n\n4. Lastly, we should simplify as much as we can. For example, if the numerator's only factor is 3, then we will subtract 3/10 from 3/4.\n\n5. Do the same for the denominator. Then, simplify as much as we are able to.\n\nFor this problem, the terms will follow this sequence:\n\n1. Simplify the first 4/5 to 4/10 - this is 1/2. We can't simplify the first term any further.\n\n2. Simplify the second", "answer": "C: with people"}

She only has enough money to buy four apples. How does she decide which apples go and which stay?\"Rationales:The goal is to determine which of the five apples Mary will buy since she can only buy four of them.To do so, we need to multiply the number of apples by the number of dollars it costs to buy one apple. This gives us an amount of money.\nSince we are looking for the amount of money Mary can use to buy apples, we need to subtract the number of dollars she has from the amount of money she has available. Dividing the difference amount of money by the amount of dollars required to buy one apple leaves us with the answer in dollars to the number of apples Mary will buy.\n\nMaking another example will help to visualize the concept of deciding which apples stay or go. Let's say Mary has 3 dogs and 5 apples instead.\n\n3 * (5 *.50) = 15 dollars\n5*.50 =2.50\n\nSubtracting: 15 - 2.50 = 12.50\nSubtracting this amount of money from each apple will reveal which apples to keep and which to sell.\n\nHence, keeping 1 apple and selling the rest.\n\nM(0.50) * Number of Dogs = Amount of Money required to get the dog\nHence, M * 3 = 15\n15 - M = 15 - 3(2.50)\nThe rest of the sum is 12.5\nAnswer: 1 D", "answer": "A: pressure"}

The diastolic number (the bottom number).\n\nStep 3: Read the systolic, which is 90, to the nearest ten for every twenty points over the second number, for example, 105 instead of 90. \nThen read the diastolic, which is twenty, also to the nearest ten, for every twenty points under the second number, for instance, 120 instead of twenty.\n\nThus: The systolic reading is 90, which rounds to 105. The diastolice reading is 90 (lowercase), which rounds to 20. \n105 over ninety = 1.155, which is the systole value.\nTherefore, 105 was the systolic value.  \nThe diastolic value was 20.\n\nAnswer: 105\n\n### Response\nInput: A number is subtracted from a third of a number and the quotient of that is divided by four.

The set in this case is the set of all strings that begin with the letter \"a\" and end with the letter \"a\".\n\nThe set formed is A, where \"a\" represents \"artist\" and \"b\" represents \"a store\". \"c\" represents \"c dance hall\", \"d\" re\npresents \"d shop\" and \"e\" represents \"e symphony\" Therefore, the set formed is \"A\", where \"a\" represents string \"a store\". \"b\" represents \"artist\".\n\nThe set should have a string that starts with \"e\" and ends with \"t\".

He works in the box office where he counts 60% of the people watching the games as well as counting how many of the 650 people that didn't buy a ticket. In 6 games, 14,268 people saw the games and 412 people bought tickets. How many people attended the games, overall?\n\nRationale: For the first group, John counts all of the people watching the game. So, we have 412 + (60% of 600) = 306 people in the first group.\nFor the second group, we need to find the second group. Now, we need to subtract the 306 people from the original population of people (650). So, 650 - 306 = 344 people in the second group.\n\nNext, let's look at the difference between groups 1 and 2. We subtract the people in group 2 from group 1. 600-306 = 294, as a difference.\n\nThe problem asks us to find out how many people \"attended the games, overall.\" So, the sum of the populations of both groups gives us an answer. Thus, overall, we get 650 + 344 = 1008 people.\n\nAnswer: 1008\n\n### Instructi:Answer the following question.\n\nInput:\"How many ways can I rearrange the letters of the word \"ABACABD\" using each of 3, 4, or 5 letters?\"\n\n### Response:\"How many ways can the first letter be arranged when rearranging the letters (using three, four, or five letters)?\"\n\n\t\t\"There are 8 ways for the letter \"a\" to be placed when rearranging the \"ABACABD\".

We know from a that tabby cats prefer to sleep in a box, and this is true because they are likely to prefer a box over the lap, alley, or barn. However, we do not know under what conditions a cat will be happy, meaning we do not know how long they will stay in a box. So, we need to make a guess (hope) that it will be between the kitten sleeping hours and the adult cat sleeping hours. This is because they are likely to be comfortable inside the box at sleeping hours. We already know that kittens and adult cats sleep for 20 hours and 16 hours each day respectively. So, we will guess that cat sleep comfort is likely to be between 10 and 20 hours. \n\nb. We know from b that kittens cannot sleep without being near their mother until they are 7 weeks old. This is equivalent to the kitten not being able to sleep alone in a box until it is 7 weeks old. So, they will not be able to sleep alone in their box until 7 weeks. \n\nc. We know from c that cats sleep for about 5.6 of the 24 hours in a day. We already know that the comfort hours of a cat will start off at 10 and end at 20 hours. So, we know the cat will be 5.6 hours into their sleep. \n\nd. We know from d that kittens sleep for about 20 of their 24 waking hours. This also equals about 83% of the time.

The set of 8 pieces forms the shape of a diamond when placed at the four corner squares and the center square.\n\nFor the two corners farthest to the right and bottom, the 2x1 move places our Queen in the center square at the bottom.  Similarly for the other two corners, our Queen ends up in the corner squares.\n\nNext, because our center squares are either full or has the King or Queen on them, we will not be able to fill them this way.

Choices: A: 1 B: 2 C: 3 D: 5 E: 6 F: 12\nRationales: 45 has a lot of factors, some of which go into each other to make many factors.  For example, 45 = 1 x 45 = 5 x 9 = 3 x 15 = 2 x 3 x 5 x 7.\nThe factors of 45 include 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 25, 30, 45.\nOne clue to this problem is the choices.  Many of the choices are whole numbers, with the exception of 12.  The choices are not in fractional form either.\nWe know 2, 3 and 5 are factors because they are in the choices. 4 and 6 are also factors because they multiply out evenly into 15. 9 is also a factor because it multiplies into 3. 7 is not a factor of 40 because it does not multiply into anything.\nThus, the answer is A (2) or B (3) or C (5) or D (6).\nAnswer: 2, 3 or 5\n\n### Instructons:Answer the following multiple choose question.\nInput: In what direction does an automobile engine turn an automobile wheel?

{"text": "Answer A\n\n### Rationale:\nBecause if you put money in the cash drawer, you need to go to the store to get money out from the cash register.\n\n### Example Input:  Your grandmother just got you an iPod for Christmas, but it only has 425 songs on it.  How many songs do you have to buy to have at least 11 songs by each artist? Choices: A: 47\nB: 56\nC: 76\nD: 115\nE: None of the above\n\n### Your response: Answer A\n\nHow to solve:\n\n1. Determine the minimum number of songs required to meet the criteria.\n\n2. Divide 425 (total songs on the iPod) by the minimum number of songs needed to meet the criteria. This is done by dividing 425 by 47, which equals 9 songs required per artist.\n\n3. Add up the minimum number of songs per each artist you plan on buying. So, 9 x however many artists you have that are part of your playlist comes out to 9 x Number of artists.\n\nThe answer is 9 x (Artist). \nNote that choosing the number 9 was simply an arbitrary choice. \nFor example, any other number could also be chosen to be the minimum number of songs to satisfy the criteria. \n\n### Example:\n\nHow many 56 cent stamps should be used on an envelope that costs $4.30 to mail?\n\nFirst, you need to determine the number of stamps required for the envelope to be mailed.\n\n1. Divide \"$4.30\" by \"$0.56\" (the price of a stamp) to get the number of stamps needed: Divide \"$4.90\" by \"$0056\" to get \"the number of stamps\" = \"85\"\n\n2. Subtract one from the number of stamps you determined to be needed: So, 86 stamps.\n\nThe answer here is 86.\n\n### Rationales:\nThis process has multiple possible starting points.  For example, you can start by determining 47 (instead of 56) and seeing", "answer": "B: piggy bank"}

(Hint: Think about how you would reach an average grade of 50 by enrolling 50 students and then adjust accordingly with the same reasoning.)\n\n### Response\nThe mean grade of 98 student is 79 so by increasing the number of students her mean grade is also 79. The increase in number of students increases the mean grade by 7. So the total of the new mean grade of 79 and 86 student is 164.

{"text": "### Demonstraion:\n### Rationale:\n\n### Answer:\nInput: Aaron makes $10 an hour at a local factory.  He works 40 hours per week.  All other things stay equal, how much does he make a week?\nRationales First and foremost, the first thing that is looked at in this question is what variables are given to us to work with. In this particular question we are given Aaron's rate of pay which is $10 per hour. So, the amount he makes per hour is $10. The second thing noted is that Aaron works 40 hours a week, so his pay per week is 40 hours x $10 = $400. However, it is noted to use a variable, so we let this represent our working variable. This could be denoted by x.\nHowever, the assumption in this question is that all other things stay equal, such as the rate he is paid. Therefore, we know that x remains the same (40 weekly hours, which equals $400 per week). Also, since this assumption stays the same, we don't have to keep recalculating using the formula.\nThe goal now is to find out whether this would have a positive or negative sign in front of it. Also, it is noted that all other things stay the same. The first step in this process is to evaluate x individually to find out the answer to the question of whether this will have a positive or negative value.\nIf we divide the amount he makes per week by the rate of pay, we get $400/$10 = 40. So, Aaron makes $40 an hour!\nNow we can put this in the formula to see if this will yield a positive or negative value because it is known that all other things stay constant. We know that x is 40, and then we put the rate of pay, which equals $10 in the formula and we find that 40 is positive $400 - $10 = +$390 \nThus, Aaron earned $390 in that week.

She has written the question as following:\n\nIf two sides of a rectangle are in the ratio 6:5 and its perimeter is 40, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?\nRationales A: Suzie can solve for the perimeter of the rectangle with the following equation: p = 6*6 + 5*5 = 36 + 25 = 61\nB: Next, the dimensions of the rectangle are found with the following equation: 11 + d = 21 where 'd' stands for 'dimension' and '11' stands for the 11 that appears to form the ratio, or 11/6; 36 + 5d = 40 * Therefore, 25 = 0\nC: Suzie can divide the perimeter from equation A by two (40/2 = p = 20) and put her answer into equation B and solve using two equations to one unknown; 11 + d - 11/6 = 20 * * 11 + d; Solving for 'd', we find that d = 3, and therefore, the dimensions of the answer are 42\nD: Suzie would need to combine A, B and C to get a final solution for the dimensions; 20/4 = 5, 5 + d = 16 *\nAnswer: D (Combining A, B, and C)\n\n### Input :A group of 5 students are putting all of their school supplies into black bags.

The rain forest.\n5. A habitat.\nRationales:  I need to narrow it down to choose only an option (A or B). To do so, I need to understand what the options do not mean. Therefore, I will use the structure: \"_________ does not mean _____________\". In the case of options 1 and 2, this means that they are not places that native lemurs live. Options 1 means \"The Indian Hedge\". This is a made-up place for reference. Since native lemurs do not live in hedges, this is not what a native lemur would be found in. Option 2 means \"in a hole\". However, native lemurs do not stay hidden in holes. This is not what a native limmer would be found in. Thus, from the choices given in the question, 1 and 2 do not meet the requirement.\n\nSo, there are four remaining options (3, 4, 5, and 6). \nOption 3 means \"a small cage where it [the lemur] is enclosed in some ways\". So this option cannot mean \"the rain forest\" either, because rain forests are not something that makes it difficult for someone to travel through. Thus, option 3 does not meet the requirement. \n\nOption 4 means \"the rain forest\". Rain forests allow lemurs to live outside the areas they make their homes in. Thus, this is not what it means to stay as hidden as a native lemur would. Therefore, option 4 does not meet the requirement that an option must meet. 5 means \"a habitat\". Habitats also allow people and animals to live outside areas where they normally make their homes. Thus, option 5 does not meet the requirement either. 6 means \"the Indian Hedge\". Therefore, since neither option 3 nor 4 meets the requirements, only options 5 and 6 meet all the requirements.\n\n### Final:\n### Demostraci\u00f3n:\n\n### Input Where will a native lemurs be found?

The human body consists of female and male organs, which would suggest that the answer choice is B, or to have sex.  There are four male organs in the male body, which are the penis, testicles, scrotum, and sperm. The penis is a male sex organ, which is used to transport/deliver sperm and semen during sexual intercourse.  During sexual intercourse, the two male reproductive organs are positioned to make a connection known as the penetration.  The penis of a male is used to transfer or ejaculate semen through the vagina and uterus, which is a female organ. Semen is a fluid that holds all the sperm, which are used for reproduction. This fluid is found inside the male's testicles and is known as sperm.  \nIn females, the female organs are the vagina, uterus, and ovaries. The vagina is used for sexual intercourse and the transport of semen and sperm. Semen and sperm can be found inside the sexual organ, the uterus.  This is where the cells fertilize and the egg cell is produced.  The egg cell is formed in the uterus and is then discharged in the ovulation stage. This is done around 14 days before the menses occur. The menses are a period of discharged blood from the female body that is shed from the inside walls of the uterus.\n\n### Input\n\n1.

This means that since Fishing Poles are the object we are asked for, we need to find anything from this picture that looks like a Fishing Pole. The most common shape that looks like a Fish Pole is the rectangular shape which ends with a hook shape. We can see these shapes in the second picture from the top as well as the bottom two pictures. Next, we need to determine the length of each Fishing Pole. This means that for each shape we have found, we need to count how many sides we see in the picture. The Fishing Pole in the second image from the top has 9 sides, and the one in the second image from bottom has 7 sides. Finally, we need to add up the number of sides of all the Fishing Poles we have counted. We see 9 (3 x 3) and 7 (6 x 3) Fishing Poles. Since the Fishing Poles have sides, we will be multiplying by 2 and 2 as the amount of sides each pole contains. \n\n### Answer:\n\n### Input\nWhat is 27 + 54 in Roman numerals?\n\n### Task:\nConvert the number using Roman numerals\n\n### Rationale:", "answer": "A: tree tops"}

First, how much money does each brother get?\nGiven this situation:Terrance has $9 for lunch. If he wants to share the leftover money with his brother, then we know that there will be $2 left for Terrance. This then means that each brother will get $1 of Terrance's money.\n\nNext, how much money does Terrance himself have left?\nTerrance had $7 dollars to start with. His brother got 1/2 or 50 cents, and Terrance got the other 1/2 or $3 dollars. Subtracting 1/2 or.5 from 1, we get that Terrance has 1 left. This means that Terrance has $5 for lunch.\n2.

To find the batting average for basketball, we divide 8 by 16, to find that the batting average is 0.5000, or 0.50. The batting average for baseball is determined by dividing 6 by 10. Dividing 6 by 1o will reduce the numbers to their lowest terms (6 \u00f7 10 = 2 \u00f7 2 = 1) and will create a decimal. (0.6000, or just 0.6).

Choices: A:  1 B: 2 C:  3 D: 5 E: 6\n\n### Response D\n\nIn the given given problem, the man owns two horses each carrying two sacks. We assume the two different horses are the same type of horse. He goes on a 2 day walk. We know that he travels 19 mile per day. Then, the man has died and leaves the two horses to travel by themselves.\n\nIt is clear that the one of the two sacks died with the man. However, the problem do not state where the two remaining sacks was on the horse. If the man carries the two sacks on the right side of the horses, then he carries 1. However, if the man carries the sacks on the left side of the horses, he carries 3.\n\nTherefore, the man dies with one sack left. And the sack he died with is on the right of the horses.\n\n### Input A\n\nInput: The king, Queen and a prince of a country were killed in a plane crash. They had no heirs. All the people who died were adults. If all of the people were adults, how many children did the king and the Queen have?\nRationales 1. We assume the King, Queen, and Prince had children.\n2. If all of the children who died were adults, then there are 1.\n3. Since there were 3 people killed in total, then there are 3 children.\n\nAnswers: 5\n\n### Instructions\nThe following input has a question that has at least two different correct", "answer": "A: sailing vessel"}

{"text": "1. It is unlikely that you would get cold when sleeping, since you will be covered by the blanket.\n\n2. You might only dream if you are sleeping enough and have no interruptions.\n\n### Rationale:\nFirstly, when we sleep, our body doesn't seem to have a need to stay warm as the body temperature goes down to a lower level than during our wakeful state and hence a good sleep may bring on mild hypothermia, so answer A won't be true. Since you will be covered by a blanket at night, you will be warm.\n\nSecondly: While sleeping, you would have dreams if you sleep enough and without any interruptions, for you are the only person that has your private thoughts at that moment. If you have interruptions such as a phone ringing or someone touching you, there are many possibilities of what you could think at that time. Even if you are sleep soundly, you could be dreaming of anything, so A or B could be true. Answer C is false.\n\nFinally: If you sleep enough and have no interruption, you may not think about anything because it is too tiring to think. However, if it happens that you are thinking about something at that time, you would probably dream of it.

How many hawks are needed to get rid of all of the sparrows at a bird sanctuary?\n\n### Instuction:\nResponse:\n\n### Demination\n**Answer:** 3\n\n### Input\nRationales:First, we have to determine what type of birds the hawks are eating. The answer is the sparrows. Once the hawks have cleaned out the sparrows, they would have finished consuming all sparrows; thus, it is now the second level.\n\nIn order to have all sparrow birds gone, we need the number of hawks to do so, which is 4. Because every sparrow gets cleaned out by 1 hawk, then multiply this number by 4 to get all sparrow birds. \nIt would then be divided by 2, because pigeons are eaten by 2 sparrows. So we divide 20 by 2 to have 10 pigeons. \n\nNext, we have to add the number of hawk birds to the number of 50 pigeons, which equals 3 hawks.\n\nRationales:10 divided by 2 is 5 birds.

To find this, we multiply 2 pennies times 2 cents, which equals 4 cents in total.\n\nBy adding the total value of the nickels and that of the dimes to the value of the two cents, the total value of the 2 pennies gets added to the total value of the other coins and, $0.30 + 4 = $0.34.\n\nLastly, we add another $0.10 to the above figure, and that would be the final total. $0.34 + 0.10 = $0.44\n\nAnswer: $0.44 (44 cents).\n\n### Input How many years ago was the year 911?\n\n### Demontation:\nAssumptions: Year (911) \u2013 1999 (2020 \u2013 1990)\n\nSubtracting 1999 from 2020, we get the number of years after 1999, which is", "answer": "C: car show"}

Multiplying this, we find that in every month, about 8,40800 grams are left over.\n\nFor the next step, we need to find the total amount of cups the coffee shop sells in a week. Since the coffee shop sells 800 cups every week, we need to find how many months there are in a week's amount of time. There are 52 weeks in a year, times 52 weeks in the total time of a year, we get 2608 weeks. This means that a week is equal to 2608/52 = 50.12 weeks.\n\nThen, we find that every 50.1 weeks, the coffee shop sells about 800 boxes of coffee. So, every 50.3 weeks there are around 17 boxes left over. This means that in every 50.4 weeks, a box has been lost; this would be 52 divided by 50.4 = 10.76 times a year a box has been lost. Now, we need to make this more realistic. Since we know that there are 10 boxes left over at the end, each year over 100 years, we would see a", "answer": "B: ungulate"}

Choices: A. 0.025 B. 0.091 C. 0.269 D. 0.172  E. 0.669 \n\n### Response 2: E\n\n### Rationales: The average height of boys in 1995 must be 63 inches to have a.995 chance of getting a boy from that year that is 63 inches. Using Probability, which comes from the formula: P(A) = nA/n, where n is the number of positive outcomes; we can plug in these numbers: Boys in 1991: 62; Girls in 1992: 61; Boys from 1984: 65; All People in 1984 (male and female): 65; so: P(A) for a male randomly chosen from 1991 is 62/65 x 1 = 0.995; P(A) for the girls in 1980 is 61/65 x 0.5 = 0.862;  and P(A) for everyone in 1964 (male and female) is 65/65 x 50/50 = 50/51 = 98.0%; so, there was a.995 Chance of picking a", "answer": "E: street"}

Illegitimate means that something is false or does not exist, while illegal means something is against the law. We can see that the correct answer is saying that someone who wants to buy a handbag need to make sure it is legal or else they might end up buying a fake product. A good way to check if something is correct is to compare it with a dictionary, but many people choose to memorize the answer like this:\n\n**Illegitimate** can be used to describe something that is fake or does not exist, but **illegal** can be used to show someone who did something that was against the law. In this question, the correct one is **illegitimate,** since **illegal** would mean it is certified when legitimate means it is not certified. The word legitimate can be used to show something that is authentic, original, and real, but in the question, this word is actually used to show that the product is not real.

Nick's gas is 2.78 so the answer 2.78 + (2/2.78) = 2.83 which in the form of dollars is $2.78 + 4/2 = 9.12\n\n2) Ruth only pays $2.72 as half the gas is not filled up. So the answer is $2.72 + (10/5) = 5.44 =$2.72 + $2.72/2 = 7.44 which is in the form of dollars and since there are two, multiply by two, the answer then is $7.", "answer": "D: shelf"}

You should sell two pair of jeans for $5.  B. Each pair of jeans costs less than the regular price.  C. You should not buy jeans. D. You should purchase jeans.  E. You should take your receipt back to the store. \n\n### Response\nI should not purchase jeans because each pair of jeans I buy at the sale price costs more than 60%. Therefore, each pair of jeans cost almost 4 times the regular price! I should not buy jeans at that price.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThe answer is D.\n\n1. The clothing cost $40 per pair.\nThe price of clothing is 100% of the original price.\nSubtracting the percentage of the original price, what is left is 60% of the original. In our case, it is $60 for each pair.\n\n2. \"60% off the regular price\" means \"60% off of $100.\"\nWhen we say \"60% of 100\", what we are referring to is 40% of the original cost (100). The answer is $40.\n\n3. If we multiply 100% by the amount of the discount we get the price, which in some cases is 60% higher than the original price.\nIn this case, after a 60% off sale, we have $60 jeans for $24, which equals 4 times the original cost.\nIt is not a deal, which makes my initial statement true.\n\nHence, we can conclude that the answer is D.\n---\n### Input: \n\n### Responses: \n\n---\n\n### Input for 3rd response:\n\n### Response for 3rd response\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n1. & 150 & \\", "answer": "B: generous"}

Based on how many feedings Fred feeds every day and the calories per feeding, we find that Fred feeds 50 foods a day.\n\nNext, given that after a week, Fred counts the total number of fish and finds that there are 288 goldfish in total, we are now able to find out how many goldfish died.\n\nFred feeds 50 fishes a day and for each fishes, the food has 5 calories per feeding given that each fishes eats 1 fishes a day, the fishes are able to eat for 30 days = 50 x 30 feedings.\nBut this means that the fishes are able tot eat 1500 calories after 50 feedings. So, the number of fishes that died within a week amounted to 286 goldfishes.\nAnswer: 0.16\n\n![](../../../img/IMG_32.png)\n\n\n\n![](../../img/img121.gif)\n![](../../img1/img27002p2.gif)", "answer": "C: snoring"}

This will allow us to figure out the full name for the other character, George.\n```\nGeorge was a friend of mine and he always told me  that his last name was \"George\". I only knew him  as \"George\", not \"George George\". He said it was difficult to spell and even  more difficult to remember.\n```\n\nThis quote from the original question will provide us with the context that allows us to figure out that George's last name is \"George\". The other character only knows George as \"George\", which shows that George was only ever named \"George\" by his friends.

The suburbs: The neighborhoods have houses, while the streets are still gated and you do your best to keep your yard tidy.\n2. The city: In this place, there is no gating off of streets or yards. Houses are just buildings like any other building. You still try to keep your yard tidier than others.\n3. A neighborhood: Neighborhoods are just like the suburbs, except they have more houses.\n4. B: Subdivisions: This is where you have to go to look for a house to live in and the house is often the biggest house in the neighborhood. This means it is harder to keep your house clean.\n5. A street: This is the worst place to live in for this reason. There isn\u2019t much privacy when you live on a street. You can hear what goes on outside your house.

Suppose no two students have the same first name, and you pick students from the list in alphabetical order by first name. If you pick one student at random, what is the probability it has the surname with all the letters A, B, C, or D in it?\n\n### Response 2:\n\n> **Cualquier persona puede obtener el mismo puntaje que su compa\u00f1ero, pero todos ellos obtendr\u00e1n un puntaje distinto. Yo creo que la correcta es la B.**\n\n### Demostraci\u00f3n:\nFirst, let's determine what our goal is - it is to pick the student with all the letters of their surname at least once (A then B then C then D), so we can answer the question: what is the probability that a randomly picked student with all these letters will have this surname? This is the p(ABCDE) probability.\n\nNow, since there are 4 students in the class, there is a.25 chance of having the first letter, there is.25 chance of the second letter, and.25 chance of both letter combined, and a.25 chance for all of the letters combined. Therefore, since there are only 3 combinations of letters this is possible, therefore:\n> 4!/3! =  60/243 = 0.249462, which is the decimal representation of p(.24946).\n\nWe'll round off to have a probability of p(.25).\n\nThe students names are all in alphabetical order. \nFor example, if one student from \"JaneDoe\" has the surname B, it means that students with names like \"Banana\" and \"Boots\" would have a higher probability of having the surname B.\n\nTherefore, we consider two distinct distributions:\n\n* Distribution 1:\n\n> If a student name starts with \"Jane\" (higher chance), then the students name should have the \"Doe\" surname - this has a probability of 1/4.\n\n* Distribution 2:\n\n>\"The distribution of randomly chose students with all the letters from the surname", "answer": "D: cant do"}

For each pair of students, the teacher can choose to give a 7-point score or a 5-point score to any conversation the pair has, based on whether or not the topic of the conversation is acceptable. For that reason, she has decided that if she gives a student a score, he will have to take all his scores and put them through the formula: F = 7(S) - 4 (T) where F is the final grade, S is the sum of scores he gets for conversations, and T is the sum of scores given for the topics of conversations.

And each notebook costs $2 to produce.The current price of the notebook is $5.00.\n\\\nThus, the cost of one notebook is equal to $2.00 and the revenue of the notebook is equal to \\((30/100)\\times$5\\).\n\\\nThen, the store will make a loss of $2.00 per notebook if it sells the notebooks.Since the store makes 30 notebook sales, the cumulative loss would be $60.\n\\\nIf the price is increased to $10, the number of notebooks that the store sells will reduce because it costs more to purchase the notebooks. Thus, the revenue will reduce in the store.\\\nThe new revenue of the notbook is \\((30/50)\\times$10\\).The store will make a profit of \\((30/300)\\times$15\\.00.\n\\[30/30=\\]3rd of 30\n\\[10/5\\rightarrow\\times1 0\\over=.2\\]\n\\[\\text{(}\\times1.2\\text{) }.00=\\]$0.12\n\n### Output:\n### Input:For every $0.50 spent on food or drink, the person who paid would be entitled to one token.

{"text": "D\n\n### Input and initial response:\n\nPeople want to explore outer space, so what vehicle do they use for it?\n\n- A. Public Place: This is a location in the ground where anyone can access public transportation by paying a price. This is suitable for humans as a mode of transportation due to its convenience as people may access this public place on foot or a bike. However, this is not suitable for vehicles as they cannot easily access this place.\n\n- B: Roadblock: A barrier for vehicles to pass or stop on. It is suitable for people as this helps prevent cars from entering areas where they are uncalled for and are a hazard to other vehicles. It is not suitable for vehicles, as it would greatly hinder their travel and could cause them significant delays.\n\n- C: Space Shuttle: Space Shuttles are not a feasible way for vehicles to travel in space as it is the fastest and most comfortable airplane.\n\n- D: Hoverboard: This is a one-person hovercraft which is not a viable method of transportation in space. Human travel is not recommended in space due to extreme temperature and no atmosphere.\n\n- E: Supermarket: This is for grocery shopping as it is used for purchasing things like food and other goods. This is a popular way for humans to consume in supermarkets because it provides a convenient shopping atmosphere. It is not feasible for vehicles to enter supermarkets unless they are small as the spaces are too restrictive and the goods are too expensive.\n\n### Rationale:\n\nThe purpose for this question is to explore the vehicle that people use to travel into space. This question is answered by the choice of D for hoverboard. Hoverboards, such as electric skateboard or hoverbike, are the vehicles that humans use for commuting purposes in space. It is chosen as the mode of transportation as a hoverboard is capable of traveling through the moon\u2019s crater and can also overcome the weak gravity of the moon. Hoverboards can also be used for various purposes such as for human spaceflight and for traveling from one planet to another with the ease of a car. As a result, this is chosen as the vehicle suitable mode of space travel for humans.\n\n### Input (repeat 1): People want to explore space, they need to", "answer": "C: space shuttle"}

This is because the value of the expression is equal to the value of -8/7 in parentheses, minus the value of the other terms listed on the left-hand side. This is because each part of the expression has the value of -9 because each part is obtained by multiplying each of the coefficients by the given denominator (13 and 8). The -8 is the larger negative number and is being subtracted from the larger number, resulting in -13.

One bike costs $19.12. At this rate, how much money would it cost you to buy all 15 bicycle\nRationales:  \nSteps  First, we need to find the total price. To do this, we need the total number of bicycles and their individual price.  T = NP where T is total price, N is the  total number of bikes, and P is the price of the bike. We  need to find the total number of bikes that you have and the price of  the bikes. Let B be the total  number of bikes that  you have and P the price of the bikes. We can write T \u2013B = NP, where N can be any number. \nSo, if you have B bikes, and the price of one of those bikes is P, then the total price is T.   Then, all that is left to do now is to solve the equation for B. To do this we can re-write the equation as T-( B) = NP where N can be any  number.  Now, we solve for B from these expressions, where B = N.  P = T \u2013 B So,  P = T- N  Divide both sides by P and solve for N.     P /P = T/T \u2013 N /P So, N = T (1) Now we find the value of N. We substitute the value of N  back in to find the total price of the 15 bikes. This is  (15) *  ( P  ).  The total price of the  bikes is thus $19.15  Answer:$ 19.15\n\n###Instructions for Answering the Following Short", "answer": "B: think"}

We can look for the volume of the two and see which container holds the most of the other material.

It is only slightly higher than $45,132, the lowest level required by the United States Department of Labor to classify a worker as an executive. If it is true that employees with degrees in business or finance, who are among the largest groups earning above average wages, typically make more than the average, we should expect their salaries to be greater than the national average. Do your results match the expectations above? \" \n\n### Rationales: \nIn this company the average wage is 100. The national average income is lower than 100, so that means they get a higher average wage. But its slightly higher than the lowest level required by United States Department of Labor. which is 45132. Therefore it meets the expectations.\n\n\n### Response:\"The average wage is 76% higher than the national average income of $45,123 so you are on the right track! The lowest level required by the US Department of Labor to classifies workers as executive for their salaries is $45,143 and not $45,152. I think you may have meant to say, \"so that means they get a lower average wage.\" In addition, I expect the average salary to be near $100 because the company does employ people with college degrees in business or finances. Therefore, the workers with those types of degrees probably make more than the national average.

{"text": "A\n\n### Explanatory Guide\n\nInput and Rationales: He had been doing favors at work and had not gotten anything in return, which made him frustrated.\n\nAnswer: The correct answer is A, which is \"let down\". This is what the phrase \"it was frustrating not receiving any payback\" means. The phrase is telling us what the character is doing in his workplace: he's doing favors. This means that he's been helping others. So, this is what is making him upset: people, in return, have not been helping him in anyway.\n\nWhen the character says, \"it was frustrated,\" they are directly telling us exactly how he is feeling. This is because he feels let down or like he wants to stop giving favors to people. This can be seen in the fact that he is doing everything he can to help everyone at work, which can be described as being kind or selfless. If someone was to do favors for him and to not be kind in return, that would make him feel let down, because he would feel disappointed.\n\nThus the correct answer to this question is \"let down\".\n\nAnswer: A\n\n### Exclusive Rule\n\nInput:\n\nHe had been doing favours for everyone at work, but that wasn't enough. He had to keep his head down and hope people wouldn't notice, but he knew that wouldn't last forever.\n\nRationales:\n\nThe first thing we learn from the statement is that the character is doing kindnesses to everyone at work. This would mean that they are doing favours for others and helping all of them as best as they can. This is how they are able to be known at work or recognized. The next part of the statement tells us that the character is hoping that other people at work will not notice that they do favours. This can be seen by the fact that there is a question mark with it. Then, we know that the character knows this won't last forever, which suggests that the actions of them doing kind acts for people at work aren't going to stay. This tells us that the character knows they're going to get caught. Additionally, the end of the sentence tells us that the character can't stop doing favours for people at work. This hints at the fact that the character doesn't know", "answer": "E: gratitude"}

You buy 3 bags of chips. Bag A costed $0.80, bag B costed $2.00, and bag C costed $4.00.

This gives us the total price of the 3 bags of food, which is $6.50 x 3 = $19.50.\n\nStep 2: Next, we need to find the average price of the 3 amounts of food, which is given in question. To find this average, we first find out how much each bag of chips cost.\n\nBag A: $0.80\nBag B: $2.00\nBag C: $4.00\nMultiplying $0.80 and 3, we get $2.40. \nSimilarly, multiplying $2.00 and 3, and $4.00 and 1, we  get $6.00 and $4.0.

The area of this smallest circle is:\n\nA: 13\nB: 14\nC: 15\nD: 16\n\n### Demostration:\n\nThe first step is to get the area of each circle. To find the area of the first circle, which is the largest, we need to multiply the radius with 3.6 which equals 14.64.\n\nFor the second circle, we need to multiply 4 with 3.6, which equals 14 while for the third circle, we need to divide 14 by 3, which equals 15.83.\n\nThus we have found the areas of each circles, which are 48, 13 and 15.8. Subtract the areas of the first circle from the second circle which equals 34.64. Then subtract the area of the first and third circle, which equals 26.17.\n\nFor the last step, subtract 596-34.64-26.17 which will equal 16.82.

Betty used the recipe, and Matthew, too.\n\nTo find the answer we are going to start by saying that it is given that they used the same amount of stasherberries. They used the same mount of stasherberies to make jam, so they each must have made the same amount of staherberies.\n\nWe know that Matthew made 10 jars, but we don't know how many staherberries he put in each jar. we can conclude that they used the same mount of shtaherberries and that each made 10 jstaherberies, so each staherberies were used to make 1 jar of jam.\nSo to make 10 jars Matthew mast have used 10 stasherberries, but Betty must have used less stasherberries to still make 10 jstares.\nSo Betty must have used less than 10 stashberries to still make at least 10 jars.\n\nWe know these two facts:\n 1. Betty picked stasherberries\n  2. Betty made jam\n\nSo Betty also made jam.\nBut 10 jars doesn't use the whole collection, so", "answer": "A: watch film"}
{"text": "The correct response is \"C\" Learn From Each Other. A listener understands what the other person says, then they can learn from each other.\n\n### InputIf you could buy a car for $15,500, and you saved $20 for every $2000 you borrowed for it, how much money would be in your savings account, and what would the value of your car be?\n\n### ResponseThe correct response is 40.00, and the value of the car would have been 65,050.00.\n\n### ExplanationThe amount you saved for every $20,000 you borrow from the bank is 20.  Thus, you need to multiply $15,570 by the amount you should save for every $2,000 worth of car.  This is 15,578 multiplied by 20, resulting in 311,000.  Now since you borrowed $20,020, you only paid $15,550 in the full price for the car.

She sells 1 item of that product every 6 minutes in a line that stretches 75 feet long.  How many customers arrive at the store in an hour?\n\n### Demostration:\nLet X denote the number of customers who arrive in 6 minutes intervals. We know the amount of people arriving every 6 minutes = 350.\n\nFirst, we need the amount of 6 minute intervals to find the X. If we know the time interval every 6 minutes, and we know the amount of people, we can solve for X. Solving for X, we get: X = 350/6 = 58.666 (rounded to X = 58)\n\nSecond, we know that given the number of 6 minute intervals in an hour. If 1 person arrives every 6 minutes, then we get the amount of 6 minutes intervals in an hour (350/6) (6 minutes in an hour)= 58.6 \n\nWe then know the amount of people (300) arriving every 6 minute interval. We then have the total amount in an hour (50X) \n\nThird, we need to know the amount of people within a 75 feet long line. We know the line is 75 feet long and if 1 person arrives in every 6 minutes, every 6 minutes another person would be added to the line. \n\nWe know that 1 person arrives within a 6 minute interval (58) and that 75 feet is equal to 10800  inches. We then know the amount of line (X) is equal to (75)/(10800)^6 = 0%\n\nThe answer is 300 people in an hour.", "answer": "E: university"}

{"text": "This task asks me to identify which environment in which an armchair is likely found by just a few people. The question asks me to consider what places would have a shortage of armchairs. I choose to answer this question with the premise that few people would have an armchair in a furniture store since furniture stores provide an array of different chairs and armchairs. If most people were to require an armchair, then their need would be satisfied with what the furniture store would provide. We will then consider where there may not be an armchair in abundant supply. To start, we consider an armchair in an apartment. Since apartments are shared, there may not be an overabundance of armchairs for just one person in an apartment. This will be one place where armchairs may be scarce.\n\nHowever, the other places that the question lists might also not have armchairs that are used by a few people, such as a doctor's office or a study. The doctor's office would contain more chairs for waiting patients and not necessarily enough chairs where the doctor actually sits to discuss with patients. They may not require an armchair over a chair. However, this is less likely for a study or a living room for that matter. Here a person will likely sit in a comfortable setting on an armchair while studying, reading, or watching television.

The idea is to place 3 sets of chairs, each consisting of 3 chairs each round the table. The problem here is that our chairs do not form complete circles. Thus, we require another chair. If we have another chair, then we could place the chairs as we desire them. So, first, we need 10 chairs", "answer": "D: study"}

We subtract the budget of $8 from the budget of $10, we get -$2 which means we have $6 in order to make any dish. After adding in all of the groceries (chicken salad, stir fry, salmon salad, homemade chicken soup) that each cost $6, we spend exactly $10. We used the most affordable groceries first (chicken salad), then we spent $2 more by adding stir fry and homemade chicken broth.

If he takes 3 showers more than Betty and 4 times as many showers as John, how many showers a day does he take?\nRationales\nInput:Jack took 13 minutes to shower.\nInput:Betty took 3 showers more and at least the same as Jack.\nInput:John took 1 shower and at least the same number of showers than Betty.\nGoal: Find the number of showers Jack took a day.\nSteps\n1. Convert 13 minutes to the number of showers.\nWe can find out the number of showers by dividing 13 by the time it takes to take each shower.\nTherefore 13/(300s) = 4.33\n2. Then, 13(300) = 3990\n3. Then, 3990(4.33) = 1743, as Jack takes 1743 showers each day.\nAnswer:1743\n\n### Input\nThere are no people in a bus.  Each person takes half of the seats.

{"text": "A\n\n### Explanation:Answers A and D are incorrect because they have very specific sizes. Lake comes from the German word, \u201clacus\u201d, which means a \u201cpool of water\u201d; Lake Erie, Lake Michigan, Lake Superior and Lake Ontario are all referred to as lakes.\n\nBoth seas and oceans are referred to as the world\u2019s ocean. The five major oceans are the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, the Southern Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean.\n\nThe pond is a type of lake that is generally shallow. This is evidenced by the fact that some ponds are only a few inches deep while others are much deeper. The pond is generally shallow because its water isn\u2019t as deep, which explains why the pond\u2019s water level rises and falls with every passing day.\n\nAquariums don\u2019t count as bodies of water, as opposed to lakes or ponds.\n\nLike a pond, a pool is a body of water, and since it\u2019s shallow, it doesn\u2019t get as deep as a pond does. The reason why pools are found near the ocean is because they don\u2019t get as deep and because of how quickly water flows through the pipes that pumps the water back into the pool. There is no definitive answer for what body of water is typically a shallow body of water because a pond, lake, and pool are all bodies of water. What matters is the size of the water and why it\u2019s shallow.\n\n### Input 3 words that describe the size of a school bus (large, small, average, huge, tiny, or just right).\n\n### Answer: Huge\n\n### Explinatoin:An average school bus is 36 feet long, 7.5 feet wide, and 10 feet high, and can hold between 78 to 85 people, depending on the model.\n\n### Test 3\n\n### Task Instruction and task demand\nThe instruction asks to solve an addition problem by counting from left to right.\n\nThe following are the demands of instructions and task:\n\n### 1st Demand: Input 2+2=4\n\n### 2nd Demand: Output 4\n\n### Ex", "answer": "D: pond"}

{"text": "C D E A B None of the above\n\n### Explanation:This is an example multiple choice question that was very basic, yet still challenging. One way to solve this question is to first identify the key words and phrases that can help you discern the correct option.\n\nIn this question, there are multiple parts that require more specific answers. So, to start, you need to find out what is the minimum requirement to do anything in general. To do this, you need to find the thing that is essential for starting. In this case, you are looking for the first steps or requirements for getting started.\n\nThe first part is what you need to do to begin. From this part, two options have the word 'begin'. So, we can eliminate D, E, and A since these do not fit this criteria. We also eliminate A because 'begin' is not the key word and doesn't really answer the question.\n\nThe next key consideration is whether there is a requirement of what is needed to enjoy or create art. Options B, C, E, are all words that relate to enjoyment or an effect you want from creating art.\n\nThe next thing to consider is the nature of the effect. If it can be negative or controversial, you can eliminate C since it has the word controversial. Therefore, your answer will be C or E. But, the key word can't be found in these options because it is in the middle of the question. So, the correct answer becomes E.\n\n### Extensions:\nAfter solving this kind of question, I would recommend checking whether your answer is correct by analyzing the question. In this case, by finding the middle words, which is 'needs', you can see that your answer must have a keyword there. If you look at the keywords in question, you can also see that D was not an option as it did not have any keywords in the middle. So the keyword 'needs' must go with the keyword 'theater'.", "answer": "A: relax"}

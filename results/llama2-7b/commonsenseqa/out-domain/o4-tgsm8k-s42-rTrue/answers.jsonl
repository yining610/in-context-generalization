This response would be used in a situation where someone is asking what it is called when you cook on a grill a lot.\n\n### Response (continued)\n\nSince the response (C) describes a word used to say slowly cooking a food using a grill, that would be a metaphor. Because you can't physically put smoke in food, it would be like a verb used to say you add flavor to food by cooking it for a long time using a grill.\n\n### Answer\n\nB.\n\n### Rationales:\nThe response is B because a grill is not the word to say what something is called to cook slowly.

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The first step to solve this problem is to determine how many groups there are for each recycled material. The family collected 144 cans, and since they get $0.50 for every 12 cans recycled, we need to find out how many complete sets of 12 cans they have. Dividing 144 cans by 12, we find that there are 12 sets.<n><n>Next, we need to find out how much the family will receive for recycling these cans. Multiplying the 12 sets by the $0.50 they receive for each set, we find that the family will receive $6 for the cans.<n><n>Secondly, the family also collected 20 kilograms of newspapers. Since they receive $1.50 for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, we need to determine how many complete sets of 5 kilograms they have. Dividing 20 kilograms by 5, we find that there are 4 sets.<n><n>We then need to find out how much the family will receive for recycling these newspapers. Multiplying the 4 sets by the $1.50 they receive for each set, we find that the family will receive $6 for the newspapers.<n><n>Finally, to find out how much money in total the family will receive, we add the money received for the cans and the newspapers together. Adding $6 and $6, we find that the family will receive $12 in total.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?<n>Rationales: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty which means Matthew picked 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.<n>Matthew also picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. This means Natalie picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries.<n>Adding up the number of strawberries picked by each person, we get 16 (Betty) + 36 (Matthew) + 18 (Natalie) = 70 strawberries in total.<n>They used these strawberries to make jam, with each jar of jam requiring 7 strawberries. This means they can make 70/7 = 10 jars of strawberries.<n>Finally, they sold each jar at $4. So, they were able to make 10 x $4 = $40 from the strawberries they picked. Therefore, they were able to make $40 from the strawberries.<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jack has a stack of books that is 12 inches thick. He knows from experience that 80 pages is one inch thick. If he has 6 books, how many pages is each one on average?<n>Rationales: Given:<n><n>1. Jack's stack of books is 12 inches thick.<n><n>2. 80 pages equals one inch in thickness.<n><n>3. Jack has 6 books in total.<n><n>Goal: Find out how many pages each book has on average.<n><n>Steps:<n><n>1. Convert the total thickness of the books in inches to the number of pages. This is done by multiplying the total thickness of the books (12 inches) by the number of pages in an inch (80 pages). So, 80 pages/inch * 12 inches = 960 pages in total.<n><n>2. Then, divide the total number of pages (960 pages) by the total number of books (6 books) to find the average number of pages per book. So, 960 pages / 6 books = 160 pages/book on average.<n><n>Thus, each book has an average of 160 pages.<n>Answer: 160<n><n>Input: James dumps his whole collection of 500 Legos on the floor and starts building a castle out of them.  He uses half the pieces before finishing and is told to put the rest away.  He puts all of the leftover pieces back in the box they came from, except for 5 missing pieces that he can't find.  How many Legos are in the box at the end?<n>Rationales: James starts with 500 Legos in his collection. <n>First, we need to find out how many Legos he used. Since he used half of his collection, this would be 500 divided by 2, which equals 250 Legos. <n>Subtract this number from 500, we get the unused Legos, which is also 250. <n>Then, we know that he was missing 5 Lego pieces when he put the Legos away, so we subtract 5 from the unused 250 Legos.<n>Therefore, the final number of Legos that were put back in the box is 245.<n>Answer: 245<n><n>### Input:Sammy wanted to go to where the people were.

How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?<n>Rationales: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty which means Matthew picked 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.<n>Matthew also picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. This means Natalie picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries.<n>Adding up the number of strawberries picked by each person, we get 16 (Betty) + 36 (Matthew) + 18 (Natalie) = 70 strawberries in total.<n>They used these strawberries to make jam, with each jar of jam requiring 7 strawberries. This means they can make 70/7 = 10 jars of strawberries.<n>Finally, they sold each jar at $4. So, they were able to make 10 x $4 = $40 from the strawberries they picked. Therefore, they were able to make $40 from the strawberries.<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jack has a stack of books that is 12 inches thick. He knows from experience that 80 pages is one inch thick.

If he has 6 books, how many pages is each one on average?<n>Rationales: Given:<n><n>1. Jack's stack of books is 12 inches thick.<n><n>2. 80 pages equals one inch in thickness.<n><n>3. Jack has 6 books in total.<n><n>Goal: Find out how many pages each book has on average.<n><n>Steps:<n><n>1. Convert the total thickness of the books in inches to the number of pages. This is done by multiplying the total thickness of the books (12 inches) by the number of pages in an inch (80 pages). So, 80 pages/inch * 12 inches = 960 pages in total.<n><n>2. Then, divide the total number of pages (960 pages) by the total number of books (6 books) to find the average number of pages per book. So, 960 pages / 6 books = 160 pages/book on average.<n><n>Thus, each book has an average of 160 pages.<n>Answer: 160<n><n>Input: James dumps his whole collection of 500 Legos on the floor and starts building a castle out of them.  He uses half the pieces before finishing and is told to put the rest away.  He puts all of the leftover pieces back in the box they came from, except for 5 missing pieces that he can't find.  How many Legos are in the box at the end?<n>Rationales: James starts with 500 Legos in his collection. <n>First, we need to find out how many Legos he used. Since he used half of his collection, this would be 500 divided by 2, which equals 250 Legos. <n>Subtract this number from 500, we get the unused Legos, which is also 250. <n>Then, we know that he was missing 5 Lego pieces when he put the Legos away, so we subtract 5 from the unused 250 Legos.<n>Therefore, the final number of Legos that were put back in the box is 245.<n>Answer: 245<n><n>### Input:To locate a choker not located in a jewelry box or boutique where would you go?

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: For every 12 cans you recycle, you receive $0.50, and for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, you receive $1.50. If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The first step to solve this problem is to determine how many groups there are for each recycled material. The family collected 144 cans, and since they get $0.50 for every 12 cans recycled, we need to find out how many complete sets of 12 cans they have. Dividing 144 cans by 12, we find that there are 12 sets.<n><n>Next, we need to find out how much the family will receive for recycling these cans. Multiplying the 12 sets by the $0.50 they receive for each set, we find that the family will receive $6 for the cans.<n><n>Secondly, the family also collected 20 kilograms of newspapers. Since they receive $1.50 for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, we need to determine how many complete sets of 5 kilograms they have. Dividing 20 kilograms by 5, we find that there are 4 sets.<n><n>We then need to find out how much the family will receive for recycling these newspapers. Multiplying the 4 sets by the $1.50 they receive for each set, we find that the family will receive $6 for the newspapers.<n><n>Finally, to find out how much money in total the family will receive, we add the money received for the cans and the newspapers together. Adding $6 and $6, we find that the family will receive $12 in total.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?<n>Rationales: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty which means Matthew picked 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.<n>Matthew also picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. This means Natalie picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries.<n>Adding up the number of strawberries picked by each person, we get 16 (Betty) + 36 (Matthew) + 18 (Natalie) = 70 strawberries in total.<n>They used these strawberries to make jam, with each jar of jam requiring 7 strawberries. This means they can make 70/7 = 10 jars of strawberries.<n>Finally, they sold each jar at $4. So, they were able to make 10 x $4 = $40 from the strawberries they picked.

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The first step to solve this problem is to determine how many groups there are for each recycled material. The family collected 144 cans, and since they get $0.50 for every 12 cans recycled, we need to find out how many complete sets of 12 cans they have. Dividing 144 cans by 12, we find that there are 12 sets.<n><n>Next, we need to find out how much the family will receive for recycling these cans. Multiplying the 12 sets by the $0.50 they receive for each set, we find that the family will receive $6 for the cans.<n><n>Secondly, the family also collected 20 kilograms of newspapers. Since they receive $1.50 for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, we need to determine how many complete sets of 5 kilograms they have. Dividing 20 kilograms by 5, we find that there are 4 sets.<n><n>We then need to find out how much the family will receive for recycling these newspapers. Multiplying the 4 sets by the $1.50 they receive for each set, we find that the family will receive $6 for the newspapers.<n><n>Finally, to find out how much money in total the family will receive, we add the money received for the cans and the newspapers together. Adding $6 and $6, we find that the family will receive $12 in total.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?<n>Rationales: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty which means Matthew picked 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.<n>Matthew also picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. This means Natalie picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries.<n>Adding up the number of strawberries picked by each person, we get 16 (Betty) + 36 (Matthew) + 18 (Natalie) = 70 strawberries in total.<n>They used these strawberries to make jam, with each jar of jam requiring 7 strawberries. This means they can make 70/7 = 10 jars of strawberries.<n>Finally, they sold each jar at $4. So, they were able to make 10 x $4 = $40 from the strawberries they picked. Therefore, they were able to make $40 from the strawberries.<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jack has a stack of books that is 12 inches thick. He knows from experience that 80 pages is one inch thick. If he has 6 books, how many pages is each one on average?<n>Rationales: Given:<n><n>1. Jack's stack of books is 12 inches thick.<n><n>2. 80 pages equals one inch in thickness.<n><n>3. Jack has 6 books in total.<n><n>Goal: Find out how many pages each book has on average.<n><n>Steps:<n><n>1. Convert the total thickness of the books in inches to the number of pages. This is done by multiplying the total thickness of the books (12 inches) by the number of pages in an inch (80 pages). So, 80 pages/inch * 12 inches = 960 pages in total.<n><n>2. Then, divide the total number of pages (960 pages) by the total number of books (6 books) to find the average number of pages per book. So, 960 pages / 6 books = 160 pages/book on average.<n><n>Thus, each book has an average of 160 pages.<n>Answer: 160<n><n>Input: James dumps his whole collection of 500 Legos on the floor and starts building a castle out of them.  He uses half the pieces before finishing and is told to put the rest away.  He puts all of the leftover pieces back in the box they came from, except for 5 missing pieces that he can't find.  How many Legos are in the box at the end?<n>Rationales: James starts with 500 Legos in his collection. <n>First, we need to find out how many Legos he used. Since he used half of his collection, this would be 500 divided by 2, which equals 250 Legos. <n>Subtract this number from 500, we get the unused Legos, which is also 250. <n>Then, we know that he was missing 5 Lego pieces when he put the Legos away, so we subtract 5 from the unused 250 Legos.<n>Therefore, the final number of Legos that were put back in the box is 245.<n>Answer: 245<n><n>### Input:Google Maps and other highway and street GPS services have replaced what?

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: For every 12 cans you recycle, you receive $0.50, and for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, you receive $1.50. If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The first step to solve this problem is to determine how many groups there are for each recycled material. The family collected 144 cans, and since they get $0.50 for every 12 cans recycled, we need to find out how many complete sets of 12 cans they have. Dividing 144 cans by 12, we find that there are 12 sets.<n><n>Next, we need to find out how much the family will receive for recycling these cans. Multiplying the 12 sets by the $0.50 they receive for each set, we find that the family will receive $6 for the cans.<n><n>Secondly, the family also collected 20 kilograms of newspapers. Since they receive $1.50 for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, we need to determine how many complete sets of 5 kilograms they have. Dividing 20 kilograms by 5, we find that there are 4 sets.<n><n>We then need to find out how much the family will receive for recycling these newspapers. Multiplying the 4 sets by the $1.50 they receive for each set, we find that the family will receive $6 for the newspapers.<n><n>Finally, to find out how much money in total the family will receive, we add the money received for the cans and the newspapers together. Adding $6 and $6, we find that the family will receive $12 in total.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?<n>Rationales: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty which means Matthew picked 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.<n>Matthew also picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. This means Natalie picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries.<n>Adding up the number of strawberries picked by each person, we get 16 (Betty) + 36 (Matthew) + 18 (Natalie) = 70 strawberries in total.<n>They used these strawberries to make jam, with each jar of jam requiring 7 strawberries. This means they can make 70/7 = 10 jars of strawberries.<n>Finally, they sold each jar at $4. So, they were able to make 10 x $4 = $40 from the strawberries they picked. Therefore, they were able to make $40 from the strawberries.<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jack has a stack of books that is 12 inches thick. He knows from experience that 80 pages is one inch thick. If he has 6 books, how many pages is each one on average?<n>Rationales: Given:<n><n>1. Jack's stack of books is 12 inches thick.<n><n>2. 80 pages equals one inch in thickness.<n><n>3. Jack has 6 books in total.<n><n>Goal: Find out how many pages each book has on average.<n><n>Steps:<n><n>1. Convert the total thickness of the books in inches to the number of pages. This is done by multiplying the total thickness of the books (12 inches) by the number of pages in an inch (80 pages). So, 80 pages/inch * 12 inches = 960 pages in total.<n><n>2. Then, divide the total number of pages (960 pages) by the total number of books (6 books) to find the average number of pages per book. So, 960 pages / 6 books = 160 pages/book on average.<n><n>Thus, each book has an average of 160 pages.<n>Answer: 160<n><n>Input: James dumps his whole collection of 500 Legos on the floor and starts building a castle out of them.  He uses half the pieces before finishing and is told to put the rest away.  He puts all of the leftover pieces back in the box they came from, except for 5 missing pieces that he can't find.

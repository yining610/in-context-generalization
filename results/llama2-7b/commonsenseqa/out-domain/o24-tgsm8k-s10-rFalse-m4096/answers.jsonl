So I store it in a number variable called valid, and then set bottlesDiff to 0.\n\nI also store a true/false variable called validClosest.\n\nNext, all I need to do is check if one of the options is true: isValid or validClosest. If one is true, then I know I am done checking.\n\nBecause I do not want to go through with the calculations if isValid is true, I set an if else statement based off isValid's value, with true == isValid and false == not isValid. \n\nIn one part of the if false statement, I check if validClosest is true for the length of bottlesDiff.\n\t\nIf both the if condition and the else condition are true, then I know that I need", "answer": "D: front porch"}

Choices:  A: living room B: dog park C: basket D: small apartment E: big house<n>Output:		C<n><n>---<n><n>### Solution:<n>This is a simple case of **DP** technique.  I first considered a 2-state problem where I have to determine if I should buy the bike or not.<n>> In the first part I bought the bike.<n>> In the 2nd part I didn't get paid enough and in other words I don't have enough money to buy the bike.<n><n>If you go through the problem statement I don't have access to the data.  However, the question could be formulated such that I know the numbers of animals I have before.<n><n>It is now easy to find out my total number of animals and animals without legs then it gets trivial to find the number of animals with legs if I know my total number of animals.<n><n>### Time Complexity<n>This problem has to do with the problem of recursion and then the running of the computation.  In the first part I used the recursive method to compute my number of animals with legs in other words I'll use the same procedure for two different cases, one where I buy the bike, other where I don't.  This will take me n calls to the function to arrive at my final answer.<n>The running time is thus `O(2^n)` where n is the number of calls to the recursive routine.<n><n>The cost of the recursive call is negligible and this is `O(1)` as well.<n>So the running cost is simply `O(2^N)`<n><n>### Space Complexity<n>This is again quite simple.  If I take the number of calls to be n, then I'll need another n space in my memory, so my total memory complexity for both cases `O(2*n)`<n><n>Hope this helps!  Thanks.

She used 3 large and 7 stickers for 6 pages. She has 6 stickers for each 6 pages, which totals 36. So she has 44 stickers.<n><n>The second multiple choice question requires us figuring out how much money Zach needs in order to buy a new bike. The total price of a bike is $100. His allowance is $5/week, which is multiplied by 15, then subtracted from $100, which yields a result of 10. His neighbor will pay him 7 dollars/hour to babysit for a total of 2 hours. The total is 14. In order to make up the $100, he needs to earn another 56 dollars. So he needs an addition of 66 dollars.<n><n>The next multiple choice question requires us determining the total of the number of legs the kangaroo and goats have. 89 + 3 = 92 and 92 + 80 = 172 and 172 + 4= 176 which totals 322. We subtract 20, the number of kangaroos, from 218 to yield 198. The total number of legs of kangaroo and the goats is 322.<n><n>The fourth multiple choice question requires us finding how much money Josh has left after buying a hat, pencil, and cookies each costing $1.25. Josh started with $20 and had extra money since he bought a cookie. Josh spent 10 dollars to buy a hat and a pencil, so Josh has $20 - 10 - $2 = $7 left.<n><n>After round 9, they need to beat the league record by 291, which requires them to play a total of 1,059 points. In order for each person to finish the round, they would have to beat the current league record by 269 points. Each person needs to earn 269 points in an individual round for the total to add up to

It can be done by finding the amount of money left after mowing the lawn.

You need to find how much the pencil costs, and then substract 10 ($10 for a hat) from what is left ($3-$2) to get the pencil ($1).<n><n>The fifth one is to find the average score that is needed for the final round in order to tie up the league record (league record is 274, so we need to find what the average score should be to tie, so the lowest score that is needed to reach 287 from 10 rounds (10 is the number of rounds in the

When that organ problem is caused by one of the following factors, one organ will be taken:  Blood disease,  Bone disease,  Breast disease,  Erectile dysfunction,  Liver disease,  Sickle cell anemia,  or  Heart disease. They don’t take from people whose deaths aren’t caused by one of these factors.

This was such a huge step forward that it raised some concerns over ethics with the FDA in the US.

They decided to stop for dinner and a rest here. But they couldn’t bring the entire camp with them.  So they asked, "What's the best way to assign everyone into teams based on how long it takes them to walk from camp?" One solution they thought of was to assign everyone two of the same-length teams in any order they wish. It doesn't matter if they are divided by one person or two people.

Then convert the seconds into hours, minutes and seconds. You'll get $3517, which is less than $10,000, so it makes sense to round it down to:  $10000. 3. Add the minutes together to find how many minutes it takes to get to the train station in the subway.<n><n>Input: Peter buys 5 apples.

The difference between his average and the record is -27.<n><n>George is short by 27 points, so his average must be something higher than 293 because 27 is less than 3.<n><n>Sophia's answer is 240. Her pie can only be weighed as being at 1200.0 because of the decimal point in pounds. <n><n>Sarah, Mary, and Touan each contributed 21$ so that 67 divided by 4 gave them 16.875, then they rounded each number as being 17. <n><n>### Code:<n><n>### Output:<n><n>```python<n>>>> TotalLegs = input().split(','))   #TotalLegs is a list of animals in the farm<n>>>> FinalLegs = TotalLegs[0] + TotalLegs[1] + TotalLegs<n>>>> TotalLeg = int(FinalLegs) <n>```<n><n>```Pytthon<n>>>> TotalMoney = input().split( "," )[0]   #TotalMoney is the initial amount<n>>>> TotalMoneys = int(TotalMoney)<n>>>> TotalMones - TotalMoney<n>>>> print( 'Josh doesn't have enough money.

This picture cost a dollar, with size ranging from the average 5x8 to a huge 10x12 size.  Now that you are living in the year 2022, it also is not uncommon to take pictures.  Do you think people in the year 1877 would be surprised to see you using the camera, if they knew the price has been reduced to a 0 and the size now ranged from "miniature" 1"x1" to a huge 65"x80"?<n>Solution: The solution involves two main idea. Firstly, the answer of this question should be "yes" since the camera was one of the things that were not very common during the time of 1870s. We can tell by looking at a book related to people's life in those time that camera was unpopular in the time although it could be used as a simple photography device. The second idea is that people may be surprised to see that a camera can be as cheap as a dollar and not as expensive as $1. <n>Answer:  In the year of 1987, it was not common for kids to eat their fruit as the fruit in our grocery stores are too expensive.  The average amount of money spent on a fruit was $30 back then and they also had to spend an average of $300 on a vegetable.  Now that you're reading this message, it is 2020 and many fruit and vegetables are on sale.  Do you think 10-year olds who read the same message from 33 years ago would be really surprise to see people spend so much on vegetables now?<n>

The method `orderTotal()` adds the costs from the cart and the `meals` and the method `returnValue()` returns the total value of the cart and the meal at the end of the session.<n><n>```<n>class Food {<n>    menu: Menu[]<n>    constructor(){<n>        this.menu = []<n>    }<n><n>    placeOrder(meal: Menu): void {<n>        this.menu.push(meal)<n>    }<n><n>getOrderTotal(): void {<n>cart = {}<n>    for (let meal of this.menu) {<n>        cart[meal.item] = meal.cost<n>    }<n>    this.orderTotal()<n>    for (const item of cart.keys()) {<n>        this.orderTotal(cart[item])<n>        }<n>    }<n>    }<n>```<n>```<n>class Menu{<n>    get item():void {<n>        if (this.item === 'pizza'){<n>            return 'order a delicious pizza'<n>        }else {<n>            return 'order another meal other than pizza'<n>        }}<n><n>    constructor(item: string){<n>        this.item = item<n>    }<n><n>}<n>```<n><n>```<n>class Pizza {<n>    constructor(item?: string, cost?: number) {<n>        this.item= item || 'pepperoni pizza.';<n>        this.cost = cost || 13;<n><n>    }<n>```

Choices:  A: roof B: room C: floor D: apartment E: neighbor's house<n>Output:		Furniture should definitely not go on top of a rooftop! It would topple over and you would get a big bill from the neighbor. Only a furniture assembly expert can get away with having furniture on top of a room. Furniture on the floor is not advised, unless you want to dig a big hole and make it a bed. Last but not least, keep furniture out of the apartment and you'll get a high class rating from the landlord.<n><n>---<n><n>Input: What would you put furniture underneath? Choices:  B: sofa C: rug D: coffee table E: carpet F: bed<n>Output: You've chosen some strange furniture! It's quite unwise to put furniture under your bed. This is an easy target for dustmites to creep under. Couches do well under a rug, carpets are for floors and if money were not the issue, a bed is definitely the way to go. Coffee tables get some dusty legs at times, making a furniture couch a good choice. If a couch is unavailable, a bed would be the next best choice.<n><n>---<n>Input: One of the following is correct.

Cheetahs can eat a full-grown deer in, um, several bites.<n><n>---<n>---<n>---<n>Input: Which of the following answers is true? A) A pug is a type of dog. B) Dogs cannot eat any animals. C) A dog is an animal that has two legs. D) A dog is an omnivorous animal, and eats anything that is edible. E) A dog is a carnivorous animal, eating meat and fish.

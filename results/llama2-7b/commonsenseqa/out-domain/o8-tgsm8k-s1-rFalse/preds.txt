The case called before him was interesting. A member of his village decided to sue a man in neighboring village for breaking a pig and a pen and a copper pot. In a farming community, people often had pigs. When the pig got to a certain size, the family would turn him loose and fatten him on grass growing in a local paddock. One fine fall day, one of the paddocks was visited by one of the most ravenous coyotes seen in that part of England in many years. He found the pig, tore him apart, and ate him, then turned to the pig's pen and tore that away from the supports and dragged it to the woods in one piece. Lastly he came upon part of the pig's copper water trough. He tore that apart and carried it off to a hidden spot.<n><n>The pig is gone, the fence is gone, and there is no sign of the copper kettle. How does the farmer in the village get his money from the farmer in the neighboring village?<n><n><n><n>### Question:<n><n>In 1911 there were not quite 2500 airplanes in the world; in December of that year, there were 3700.

Each of them is working towards the goal of buying a new book. They would also like to be able to buy a book that will cost more than half of their daily income, but they want to spread their savings out equally. How old is the oldest student serving as the manager of the store?<n><n>### Response 1:<n>This one doesn't seem so bad.<n><n>### Response A: I see there has been 7 new employees since last Tuesday. Let's double that to 14 and half that by 4 for each shift so it's 44, and then I subtract each employee individually. This means there are a total of 14 employees. If the oldest employee makes about $150 per day, and $90 of it goes to rent, there's only about $60 for food per day after expenses. If you take out half of that, only $20 is left for each individual employee to spend on food, and if we split it evenly it only leaves each employee $10 per day to spend with the whole group. So... the oldest employee works part-time, maybe at McDonald's or something and the rest of their income comes from the bookstore....<n><n>### Response B: Let's say they all get pay of $34, which can be found among their 20 employees. If they want to make at least $40 per day, they need to get at least 2 other people to sell $40 in books. Well, that's $60! They're selling at least 4 books a day to make that amount.<n><n>### Input A:<n>Five years ago Josh's father started with 2,712 in his bank account and 175 in his piggy bank ($3,887 in total).

Input:Mark has kangaroos, goats and 35 cows.  Kangaroons has 2 legs and goats have 4 legs.  What is the total number of the legs in his farm if he 3 times as many goats than kangaroons?<n>```<n>If he has 3 times the amount of goats as he has kangaroons, that means he has 2/3 the number total the amount of goats and cows.  Because he has 35 cows, you need to multiply the ratio of goats and kanguarous to cows.  So 2/3 x35 = 21.73<n>```<n><n>## 6.Input:Sarah, Mary, and Tua need to pay for a meal.  They decided to split the bill evenly.  However, they found that the cost of the food was $67 and they only got a coupon for $5  off, making the final bill $62.  How much does each person need contribute to the bill?  <n>Let's work this backwards to begin with:  We need to figure out how much did they each have to contribute to get down to $62.  So, Mary, Tuan, and Sarah had to add together and spend $105 between the three of them.  This means that each person needed to split $105 so $105 / 3 = $35.  But $35 / 3 = Mary $11.66, Tuan $11.61 and Sarah $11.73. <n>But Mary got a $5.00 coupon for $4 total and Sarah got a $6.00 coupon leaving the bill amount of $

She has 8 pairs of shoes and there are 4 extra for her friend. How many toys, shoes and extra pairs does Mary have?<n>Analyze the given instruction and determine how you will accomplish the task requested.<n><n>### Response 1:<n>In the instruction, Mary is given 3 times as many than toys.  She also has 8 pairs of shoe, and there 4 extra pairs. This is a situation where 18 is needed to be added to the number of toys or shoes.<n><n>### Input - First part: John has an 8-cylinder gasoline-powered engine.  That engine needs 14 times as much gas as the 4-cylinder engine has.  The 4 cylinder engine lasts 28 times longer than the 8-cylider engine.<n><n>### Comment 1<n>How much longer does the 4 cylinder engine need to last for the 8 cylinder engine to last for 7 years.<n><n>### Answer 1:<n>The 4 cylinder engine needs to last 28 years for the 8 cylender engine to last for 28 times longer.<n>If the 8 enginer lasted 28 times longer, it would be 8 times longer, which means 8×7 years = 56 years.<n>So the 4 cylinder would need to last for 56 years to balance the 8 cylinder, which would mean the 4 cylinder enginer needs to last for 5 times as long as the 8 cylinder enginer.<n><n>\$\iff 14x(8) = 8x(4)\$<n>Since 14x( 8) is bigger, you would need 1 more round of division than you would need multiplication to get your goal of (8x(4)). So this is where you need the 14 times as many than statement.<n><n>$\$\iff14\*8=8\*4$$<n><n>This is equivalent to $\$\iff 112=32$$<n><n>So to make an 8 cylinder engine last 7 years, the 4 cylinder must last 7 times as long as the regular enginer (so 6 years).

Let's look at this question.<n>> <n>> We can find more than one kind of friendship. You're not getting a friend just by putting your name on a facebook profile. There is a difference between online friends and real friends. The same goes for offline friends. You can find different kinds of friends, but the idea is that you treat your friends with respect and understanding because they want you to be happy. They won't say you gotta do this. They may disagree with you and it will cause an argument, but they will be your friends forever if they truly are your friends.<n>> <n>><i> </i><i>There are also several kinds of friendships depending on how you meet someone. <n>> <n>> As a child, you will meet people you play with. After you start being friends and making jokes with your friends, you become closer friends and you start to meet up more often outside of school.<n>> <n><img src="/img/img_test_08.png" alt="" width="350" style="width:350px;height:350px;"><n>><n>> There are different types of friendships, but they all share one thing:<n>> <n>> Friendship itself is always a battle between friendships.<n>> <n>

He did so because he was feeling what? Choices:  A: pleasure B: delight C: bankruptcy D: agony E: owning<n><n>### Response:		<n>I'm guessing the correct answer is <n><n>### Reason:<n>John spent too much money on products for his testicles because he is feeling agony, a painful feeling caused in a bodily part.  The first sentence says, **John spent too much money (buying) products for his swolled testicles.** The first two words in the sentence are **John spent too much**.  The next word, **money**, is referring to the products of John's testicles are being used on products for his swollowed testicles.  One of the last two words is **testicles,** which is referring to the body part he is referring to.  I am looking to the word, **Products**, in the sentence and it is talking about the products the testicles made like semen or the sperm inside the testicles.  My reasoning is the correct one, which is **agony** because he is feeling pain in his testicles.<n><n><n>### Task:<n>Write a method that accepts a String.

The process of learning to write fractions is much like learning how to write the number line. If he has a number line of length 12 inches, he can put a mark on the line that is 4 inches away from 0.  This place is marked by the fraction 4/12.  Next, he will use it as a reference when he writes down the number line, so this fraction will no longer be used.  He will move 2/12 mark forward on the number line for 2/12ths of the distance between 0 and 4/12ths.  He can write 2/12 on the line.  He can put the 2 as the numerator for 2/1)2 and then, because he's going to write the line in the opposite direction, he can write the denominator at the top to show where he is.  This fraction is read "2/12."  Repeating the process for the next 2/12 will allow him to write a fraction that represents 1/4.<n><n>### Output<n><n>In that case he could move 2/11 to the 2/12 fraction, using 2/12 as a reference point for how far he'll go.  He now writes 2/11 and puts the 2 as the top of the fraction.  He can then put the 11 on the floor in the same way that you might put an exponent on the floor when writing the fraction 2(11).<n><n>### Input and output 3<n><n>He also wants to write a fraction that is 1/6th of some other number.  He can use the 1-12 line as a way to go from 1/4 to 1/6 in a series of steps.  Using what he knows about writing fractions to the 12th, he can find the fraction 1/6 as follows:<n><n>First, he will write the fractions and the first 1/4, just as he demonstrated above.  The

When I joined this company as a new employee, I was given an opportunity to present myself and my expertise to the leadership team. I was asked to introduce myself and share what I would like to accomplish at my new role.<n><n>I was extremely nervous and excited, but after some nervous laughter my co-worker and I sat down to try to gather our thoughts. We began discussing what our strengths were and how we could build on them to support our new goals at this company. As I sat there and spoke about the work that I did at my old job, I realized that I wanted to learn so much more. I didn't realize how the words that I used at that time contributed to where I am now. In a very short period of time, I was able to achieve so much more at my job. I have accomplished many things, but the one thing that stands out to me is when I asked my manager to write a letter of recommendation for me and when I got it back it was absolutely beautiful and very detailed. When I looked at the letter as I was reading it, I was able to tell that it captured the words that I used in my initial conversations with him.<n><n>During our weekly meetings he often asked me what was going on with my job search. I was happy to tell Him everything that I was up to because I think that he knew how important this role was at such a great organization. He always had an encouraging comment about how happy he was that I was doing well and how the company needed people like me to grow and develop. Words can make such a powerful difference and I am so thankful that I found this role and I am so thank ful to all of you. You have made it an amazing place to work.<n><n>### Notes:Notes:  In a very short period, I was able to accomplish a lot.<n><n>### Response to Notes:Notes:In a very short period of 4 months, I was able to acquire a lot of knowledge and get some experience.<n>

What do you know about her?<n><n>## Solution:<n>  * I don't know the right answer but I know that she ate a peach by multiplying once, and she ate an apple by multiplying four times. She's probably a mathematician or just a very experienced number-manipulator.<n>  * I can tell that only two of these statements are true,  and so I know she didn't eat a muffin and probably not a cookie.<n><n>## Question : What did the girl ate? What do you know?<n><n>## Solution :<n>  * First I tried the first step, the girl ate the apple. That was an incorrect step, so I tried the next most obvious thing since it's the first number she saw and it makes very little sense to choose a number like 5 or 6 because she has to multiply it at least once to be able to eat the apple. So I chose the apple and she ate it at some point.<n>  * Then I chose the banana. This time it made absolutely no sense to just pick the next number since I already knew that she is actually eating something and not just picking a random number. So I choose the next two numbers and she ate the banana at some point.<n><n>## Questions<n><n>### What is the greatest?<n><n>### Answer<n><n>16<n>

If Sara has 40 books, how many pencils and eraser does Sara have?<n>Solution: We know that Sara's pencils and erassers are two times more than books, so Sara's penzcils and erassers is 2x2=4. The question gives us that 40b+pencils and erasers is 40. We can conclude that total of all items is 2x40=80.<n><n>### Solution1: Incorrect: To solve it, you need to multiply by 3 and subtract 1 to result in -2 (so you would have -2 points).<n><n>Solution2: Correct: To solve it, first you need to double all the values, then you need to subtract the original one. Example: 11-10/11.<n><n>### Question: What do you have to do first to simplify: -3x1 / 4x2 or 2x5 / 10x7?<n>Solution: The first one is -3x1 /4x2= -3/4x2 is -3/16 which gives 1/2, which means you need to multiply your value by 2 and get the result is -3x2= -6. The second one we just need to do 2x5=10x7= 40.<n><n>## Conclusion

We will create a random number of a fixed precision.

Write a response that accurately answers the question.\n\nInput: Josh’s grandma gave him one toy every day for the month of June. He got one stuffed animal on the\n\n21st and three more toys that month. If he got 28 toys from his grandma in the month of June,\n\nhow many more days were there in June than July? (4 points)<n>### Response: (2 points)\n\nIn the month of June, Josh received one toy per day.   Therefore, there were 30-days in June.\n\nJuly only had 28 days per month.  Since July only had 28-days and Josh only got 28\n\ntoys, we know that June had at least 1 \n\nmore day than July.<n><n>### The correct answer to this question is the following (0 points)\n\nJuly is exactly a month before June.  So, June must've had 31-days and July\n\nonly had 30-days.  Therefore, June had at least one more day than July and at least\n\n31-days.<n>

Choices:  A: near B: closeness C: here D: proximity E: this<n><n>### Response:		D is correct.<n><n>### Justification<n>A: "Near" (adj.) means close to something, but not quite touching or against. A sensor is used to determine the distance, not the closeness, of an object from another object.<n>B: In this context, "closeness" means nearness or the proximity of an object. A sensor is not used to determine closeness or nearness, but distance instead.<n>C: The term "here" refers to place or position. A sensor used to detect distance would not have anything to do with position.<n>D: "Proximity" refers to both being near an object and its spatial closeness to something else. A sensor is not a sensor used to determine proximity (spatial closeness).<n>E: "This" is an inappropriate term to use since it would mean the sensor.

What would he have told her before she entered the seventh grade or the ninth grade? When she was seven years old?When she was<n><n>### Response<n><n>#### Advice from a father<n>I have been a manager of many employees, it is extremely difficult to give useful advice to employees as a manager. The reason is that there is a vast difference in competencies between managers and juniors, and juniors may feel insecure or may be intimidated by managers. My advice would be first to let the juniors know the work style of me and the company. Then, I would give useful advice based on the differences in work ethics between juniors and myself. For example, when some juniors become disorganized, I would tell them "we should work the way that a secretary in my company does." For example, when I work with a manager from another organization, I do not do what I cannot do such as using my secretary's telephone number but using mine or sending an e-mail without thinking about my message. That is a work style that is necessary for working with a colleague. In the workplace environment, I do not tell everyone that I follow this rule, but I tell colleagues who are not my juniors, such as managers from other departments and managers from businesses. My colleagues are likely to tell the juniors who are not my colleagues about this, and it will lead to the success in the relationship between me and the juniors. Thus, it is necessary to make the other person know the standards of your work before you give someones advice. An example is to share my rule with colleagues about using my secretary's phone number before handing over the tip to juniors.<n><n>#### Advice between siblings<n>I would give to a person who comes from a rich and powerful family the same advice as that for a boss from the other company. Basically, I would give useful and timely advice by considering the person's work style. For example, I would give helpful advice on work skills. I believe that these pieces of advice will influence the person'

Choices:  A: satisfaction B: flying C: sweating D: falling down E: trip<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Sweating is one of many things that runners will endure in their sport.  The question does not specify what sort of run. For example, a track runner or a cross-country runner (or any other type of long distance runner) will perspire in humid environments whereas someone that plays a tennis match in a gymnasium will sweat similarly for different reasons.  The correct response should focus on how sweating is a common experience for people that runs for various distances.  <n><n>One can argue that runners feel other kinds of 'flights' and 'falls' as they exert themselves.  However, this is a question of perspective.  Flights can only refer to a bird or other flying creature that is used as a metaphor to denote a soaring and graceful activity, whereas 'falls' can also relate to an unfortunate incident or disaster.  <n><n>Finally, trips can refer to a slip, stumble or a different kind of error.  <n><n>### Instructions:Complete the task<n><n>### Instruct:Sophia's favorite fruits are strawberries and kiwis.

Sophia wanted to try the rest of the strawberries instead.  She ate half and decided to get some more, which left her with 234 strawberries.  If the strawberries at the store cost $50 for the entire bunch, what is the price of one strawberry?

Solve for x.)<n><n>### Instuct:A friend challenged Sally that if she can lift five pounds on her left leg twice as many times as she can on her right leg using arm weights she is smarter.

She can eat 18 chocolate cakes and 160 chocolate chip cookies each day. Each week, she saves so much money, she can have  a soda each day, a fancy lunch once a week, and dessert when ever ever she likes. Her lunches are $5 each, desserts are $7 each and the soda is $2.50. What is the maximum amount of money, in dollars, she can save each week?<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>### Solution-Response:<n>First, lets answer each food and see what we can say.<n>Chocolate Cake: The question states each week Dotty saves $367.50, therefore if she can afford 18 cakes we get 18 * $367.25 = $6764 (6764 cents/2 dollars =3382)<n><n>Chocolate Chip Cookies: The question states each 7 days she can afford 160 cookies, therefore 160 * $35 = $560 (560 dollars/2 - $1498)<n><n>If we add the savings of the chocolate cake which is 6764+560 we get 7324. The question says that Dotty can have a daily soda of 5 dollars. It is easier to count down the amount of money that Dotty is left with after the soda therefore we subtract 5 each day the amount left will be 7324 -5 (7324-5=7320)<n><n>A fancy lunch means that each week she can have one for 5 dollars. Therefore we add 5 each week the amount left will be (7320+5*(1-1)) =7324<n><n>Deserts are 7 dollars each, we add 7 each week it will be 7371 (7371+7*(1-1))<n><n>We finally get down to the money left with which is 7366+13

If all the friends are able to work together<n>on their assignment with one time each, then it would only take 60 minutes. However, due to<n>their schedules which vary from week to week, one friend is busy each week and cannot work on<n>the assignment.<n><n>The amount of time each person needs to complete their assignment depends on the amount of<n>time each other person finished their assignment for that day. For example, if one person<n>needs another 30 hours to finish their assignment, so they work on it for 10 hours on Friday,<n>the other five people need another 3x25=75 minutes to finish their assignment. These 75<n>minutes can be divided equally amongst the 5 remaining people so all people finish at 15<n>minutes apart.<n><n>The problem can be approached recursively, i.e. if we have answered time needed for one<n>person then we need to know the time needed for the remaining people, and as we saw above<n>this depends on how much time the other people finished. We can calculate all the times<n>necessary for the remaining people recursively.<n><n>Since the problem is recursive we must have a helper method that returns the previous<n>calculation (i.e. what time is needed by the helper). If we had a helper that returned the<n>time we first calculate we

How many hours are there in a year? How many years are there in a decade? How many decades are there in a century? In these questions, we are looking at the difference in amount in the two cases by just subtracting the two amounts. In the first question, for instance, we found out that a week has 1/7 of a year, or 42 minutes. Similarly, we can look at the question about decade and year to reach the answer that a decade has 10 years or a century has 10 decades.<n><n>### Explanation:Since a day are 24 hours, a month is 30 days, we can say that a month has 30 minutes and three months is 90 minutes. Using this and the example on minutes in a week, we can say that 3 months is also 90 minutes. Also, if a year has 365 days, a decade also has 3650 days or 10 years.

Choices:  A: dictionary B: wilderness C: fly D: underground E: colorado<n><n>### Response:		The options seem like they could fit, but the answer is underground. A dictionary would include underground, meaning the marmoset would not go there. I’m not sure where “wilderness” comes from, maybe a wilderness with underground tunnels, so perhaps the answer is in those tunnels. I think “fly” is also out, although marmosets do fly. They can’t go to Colorado since that would be a marmoset-less place. So the answer is Colorado.<n><n>*Hook: (informal)/Hey/Whats up!<n><n>### Input:"Dude, the puddle is getting bigger and there seems to be a whale in it!

I hated school as a child and often dreamed of being homeschooled by my parents like my brother was. It wasn't that I didn't like school, it was that I didn't get it and it didn't get me. I didn't understand what math had to do with my life anymore than why I needed to know the name of every president or what a bill of rights was. The only times I was happy at school were the handful of classes I had with my favorite teacher. He taught us how to build a website, which felt so far off what we were learning in math class that I actually paid attention. He taught us how many types of websites we would need for an Internet startup (which I decided to call TeenTunes, in honor of my love for music) and how we would use HTML and CSS to build each one. I was instantly hooked, not because I was interested in what I was learning, but because that particular teacher made learning fun for me for the first time in years.<n><n>Learning HTML and CSS, I was taught, was not a linear process. The path was complicated. There were more things I didn't understand than I did understand. I read documentation and researched and looked around at tutorials trying to make sense of it when all I ever really wanted to do

Choices:  A: sail boats B: question authority C: high fives D: share things E: learn from each other<n><n>### Response:		Which of the four ways to engage in a pastime when traveling on liquid is most likely the correct answer?<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>Explanation: When traveling along liquid, people are most likely to share things. People on a boat are together, and share food, which they may do with other boats in the vicinity. They share the water with other ships in the water, and would have to travel together in close range if they're racing. People on boats also share things from their boats to another boat. If they were having something, they would have at least one person hand their stuff to a person on the other boat. The only exception to this is fishing, which doesn't really count as a past time and people don't commonly learn from other boats about fishing.<n><n>### Inputs<n><n>### Mary had 89 stckers.

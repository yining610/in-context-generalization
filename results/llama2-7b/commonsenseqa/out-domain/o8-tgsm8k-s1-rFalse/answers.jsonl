{"text": "C\n\n---\n\n### Solution:\nThis is a simple case of **DP** technique.  I first considered a 2-state problem where I have to determine if I should buy the bike or not.\n> In the first part I bought the bike.\n> In the 2nd part I didn't get paid enough and in other words I don't have enough money to buy the bike.\n\nIf you go through the problem statement I don't have access to the data.  However, the question could be formulated such that I know the numbers of animals I have before.\n\nIt is now easy to find out my total number of animals and animals without legs then it gets trivial to find the number of animals with legs if I know my total number of animals.\n\n### Time Complexity\nThis problem has to do with the problem of recursion and then the running of the computation.  In the first part I used the recursive method to compute my number of animals with legs in other words I'll use the same procedure for two different cases, one where I buy the bike, other where I don't.  This will take me n calls to the function to arrive at my final answer.\nThe running time is thus `O(2^n)` where n is the number of calls to the recursive routine.\n\nThe cost of the recursive call is negligible and this is `O(1)` as well.\nSo the running cost is simply `O(2^N)`\n\n### Space Complexity\nThis is again quite simple.  If I take the number of calls to be n, then I'll need another n space in my memory, so my total memory complexity for both cases `O(2*n)`\n\nHope this helps!  Thanks.", "answer": "E: big house"}

It can be done by finding the amount of money left after mowing the lawn. If there is $65 remaining + $12 (babysitting) + $10 (mowing) = $77, the babysitter made $77 - $10= $67, which is how many extra hours the sitter must work to get $100 and the bike.\n\nIt can be done that way because babysitting takes $10, so the total cost of running each activity is $10.\n\nThe third part requires you to divide 3 by 2 (the amount for each type of animal) to find the amount of legs on the entire animals.\n\nThe fourth one is the same concept as the previous part.

{"text": "A\n\n### My solution, and explanation of the approach:\n\nIn a journal page, there have a total of 26 rows  and one 26th of the page is for the cover image of journal.\nFirst, there are 26 rows in which each cell contains a sticker.\nThen, there is row for the cover and it has 26 cells. We do not use cells in which the sticker is used.\n\nTo assign the sticker, there are 27 cells in total.(row 1-3 have been covered because row 1 is for the index, and row 3 is for the cover image.)\n\nTherefore, the number of stickers is 27.\n\nBicycle\nTo calculate the total of the money, the following method is used.\nWe have some known values, namely current money of Zach = $65 and amount of money for each babysit = $7.\nTo solve the problem, we have two questions:\n1. How much money more Zach needs to earn?\n2. How much time he needs after he babysit after mowing the lawn?\n\nSo first, We have known the total amount of money Zach needs to earn = $100.\nHence $100 = T\n\nWe can say $100 = $68+$32.\nHence $68 = Y, $32 = Z\n\nWe can say that after babysit, money of Zach = $ (65+ (3*7))+5 dollars = $82+15 = $97.\nNow, the babysitting times for one day, is given by,\n\n$$ \\therefore T = T-5 $$\n\nOr, this can be written as\n$$ T = (32-26) = 6 $$\n\nHence, Zach needs 6 hours of babysitting after he babysitting after mowing the lalwn.\n\nGoats\nTo calculate the total number of legs in animals, first, we need to split the animals in terms of Kangaroos and goat.\n\n$$ \\therefor\\ Kangaroos= 23-3=15-3=3/2 $$\n\n$$ \\sum Kangaroo legs =6", "answer": "A: do crossword puzzle"}

This picture cost a dollar, with size ranging from the average 5x8 to a huge 10x12 size.  Now that you are living in the year 2022, it also is not uncommon to take pictures.  Do you think people in the year 1877 would be surprised to see you using the camera, if they knew the price has been reduced to a 0 and the size now ranged from \"miniature\" 1\"x1\" to a huge 65\"x80\"?\nSolution: The solution involves two main idea. Firstly, the answer of this question should be \"yes\" since the camera was one of the things that were not very common during the time of 1870s. We can tell by looking at a book related to people's life in those time that camera was unpopular in the time although it could be used as a simple photography device. The second idea is that people may be surprised to see that a camera can be as cheap as a dollar and not as expensive as $1. \nAnswer:  In the year of 1987, it was not common for kids to eat their fruit as the fruit in our grocery stores are too expensive.  The average amount of money spent on a fruit was $30 back then and they also had to spend an average of $300 on a vegetable.

We'll demonstrate how much work and memory 2038 can handle, depending on the size of the problems. \n \n\n##### Step 1\nRun `python main.py` and observe the output of the calculator.\n\n##### Step1\n\n##### Step2\nLet's say the numbers we are adding up are in the array variable `user_input_numbers`. \n\nWe can ask the array size using `user_input_number.len()`.\n\nIf the array is empty, it only has length 0.\n\n##### Tutorial\n\n##### For each input we are going to try a few different scenarios to explain how much of what you're thinking through matters in regards to problem size.\n\n##### If the array isn't empty:\n\nThe first question we need to answer is the length of the array.\n\n##### For our purposes:\n\nOur two arrays never will have an equal number of numbers.\n\n\n\n#### How Much Work:\n\nAn array can hold at most a maximum of 100,000 numbers.\n\nA memory storage of 4 GB works with 20 digit numbers, where 256 digit numbers requires 8 GB. \n\nWhen comparing apples to oranges it's best to think of them as 1.7 GB. \n\nHow Big is 100,200? \n\n```\nlen(numbers)  \n99,999  \n```\n\nIs it a bit more or a bit less? \n\n```console\n%python\nprint(len(numbers) / 3)\n>>\n3,000\n```\nThat means 3,000 numbers, which is a lot.  \n\nIf we were to add up a million digits in our array,\n\nThe array would take up 1.7 GB on average. A million isn't that far off from 10,000. \n\n\n\n\n\nAn `if` statement works like this: \n\n```\nif(condition)\n  output\nelse: \n  output\n\nif(condition) {\n  len(numbers)\n}", "answer": "A: new hampshire"}

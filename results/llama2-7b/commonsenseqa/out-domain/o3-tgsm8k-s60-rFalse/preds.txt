The second one, I saw the relationship between the variables and did some basic integer operations. The third, I used a loop and a conditional to do a nested for loop, using the variables to count inside the outer for loop. The fourth, I used what I learned in the second problem and modified the first problem using a function that takes the variables and loops them in the function without hardcoding them into the problem statement. The final question I was able to solve by reading the question and writing a nested for loop.<n><n>### Learning Activity:<n><n>There are lots to learn from this!<n><n>### Conclusion:<n><n>We will move on to learning how to use arrays in part 8 and how to write functions in part 9<n><n>### Reference:<n><n>- [Arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array)<n>- [Function](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/JavaScript_Programming/Variables_and_Literals/Functions)<n>- [For Loop](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp)<n>- [While Loop](https://www<n>

What is the measure of the angles in the 3rd and 1st triangles?<n>Output: 90°<n><n>### Explanation: *<n><n>In the first question,the input comes in the format "Janet has 9 cards _more_ than Brenda." There's an underscore here where each card should be. Because Janet has "more" cards than Brenda, we know that Brenda's card count is 9 less than Janet's. We know the final count from the input will be 150 + 9. It could go from 151 to 101, but the number we are looking for is always between 10 and 100 inclusive. *<n><n>In the second question,the input comes is the format "Pete walked _5_ blocks from his house to __bus garage in Houston." We are searching for those double-dashes that indicate the __bus garage__ in Houston. Because it is a double-dash, there must be 2 values between the dashes, so the answer is 20. *<n><n>This is our solution<n><n>In the third question,the input comes as " _3 times as_ _many as_ _the_ _blue_ <space> <blue 3 times as many than the blue_ <space> blue and green combined" which is equivalent to " 3 times as many green as blue and 13 more green than the total." The total is 21, so the blue must be zero. The 3rd question is asking us to find

How many people are in the bar?<n>Output: 11.<n><n>## Explanations:<n>## In the first question, our goal is to find out the sum of Janet’s cards with Brenda’s. In order to achieve this, we must first decide how we can arrange the three numbers to create a new equation, with the first set being in the LHS and the second in the RHS. Firstly, we get one 9 by multiplying nine by one and adding one to Brenda and Janet, respectively. Secondly, we get 0 by multiplying six by two and two by Brenda as well as two by Janet. Lastly, we get Mara’s by multiplying 150 by four, and subtracting it from Mara and Brenda twice. Hence, we end up with the following equation: \<n>$\displaystyle S=9+9+0+3(Brenda-Janet)+4(150-Mara)$. We find our desired answer by solving for S: \<n>$\displaystyle \frac{S+9}{9}+3\frac{Janet-Brenda}{6}+4=1$. Note that $211=183+28$ as expected.<n><n>## In the second question, firstly, we need to find the total distance walked. For instance, in the first part, we have five blocks and 20 blocks, and hence, we can say that the total walk covered is $5+20=25$. Similarly, we can arrange the second part similarly to arrange the first part, and we end up with a walk of $5+20+12$ blocks. Note that $50=5+20+2+15$.<n><n>## In the third question, firstly, let us find the difference between the number of blue chairs and the green chairs, for instance, we see $10−3(x)$, and we find that $10−3x=7$. Hence, the difference between the number between blue and green chairs is seven. Next, let us find the total number of chairs in the class. We find this by multiplying the total number of chaws in the

Choices:  A: in books B: radio station C: city D: tower E: medieval castle<n>Output:		E<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>1. (a) The number of cards that Janet and Brenda have: Janet = 34, Brenda = 25<n>Because: "Janet has 9 cards MORE than Brenda", Janet - 9, Janet = Brenda + 9<n>2x(Brenda) - Janet = Brenda - (Janet), we have: Brenda + 8 = 9, therefore 9= Brenda + 8+1, we get: Brenda + 1 = 9<n>Brenda = 9 - 1 = 8<n>Therefore, Janet has 9 more cards than Brenda.<n>3. (a) Pete is walking from home: a block : 10 yards/meter, b block : 20 yards/meter. In home - bus garage : 5 blocks = 50 yards/meters, In bus garage - post office (a block) : 20 yards<n>Pete came in home same way: b block - home :20 yards, we get: home - bus garage (5 blocks)= post office (1 block) : 50 yard/meters - 20 yards= post office - home (20 yards = 1 block), we get: post office + 1 more block (21 blocks) = total = 51 block<n>4. (a) green chairs: green chairs are 9 more than the blue chairs: (blue, green) 10 : x : = 9 :13<n>total = blue+green = 10+9 = 19<n>5.

He rode the bus 20 blocks to the post office to get some stamps. Later, he came home the same way. How many blocks did Pete travel in all?<n>Output: 50<n><n>Input: In a classroom, there are blue chairs, green chairs, and white chairs. There are 10 blue chairs.

Choices:  A: cash register B: desk drawer C: pay envelope D: throw away E: box<n>Output:		C<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>We want to use the following approach:<n><n>1. Make the problem a simple loop<n>2. Increase the difficulty of steps 1 and 2 by asking multiple questions<n><n>Example approach:<n><n>For the first problem, we can have one instruction to add 1 to a variable, and then a line of output to print the variable. Then add another instruction that outputs that variable plus the answer to the next question.<n><n>If we want to allow for two separate questions, two variable and two output statements will be required. A 16-bit processor could be used to store the variable of the first question. In the second question, a variable could be stored and the variable from the first question would be used. The resulting output for the first question becomes the second question, which the first result would be added to. Therefore, each question would require a set of four instructions: 1) an input, 2) computation in ALU, 3) address to output location, 4) output, and we have two questions and thus the first question would require 8 additional instructions, a total of 12 instructions.<n>The first solution shows a simple algorithm to print 211 from inputting 3 questions.<n>In the second problem, we use the same approach, but the instructions are split among different registers. For the blue chairs and green chairs we have a constant pool of 10. We will store the constants in register E. Using two instructions, we will move the constants into registers D and E. We will also need an increment instruction to address A1 to output the green chairs only.<n><n>For the third problem, similar steps are used, but in order to avoid a problem where the white chairs outnumber the other two chairs, we will use the instruction to move the green chair constant + the white chairs constant to register C and the result to A1.<n><n>In the last problem, we can test our register values, then output the letter after some simple arithmetic operations.<n><n>### Additional Info<n><n>These simple steps can be used to solve the instruction, but they may result in overflow.<n><n>The overflow may be corrected by using a larger instruction set. We may also take advantage of the overflow by using it as part of the instructions.<n><n>The process may be improved further by using memory to store data. The use of memory

What was it you learned, and how did it compare to what you learned using the Raspberry Pi?<n>Output: When I first took a computer class in primary school, I was very bored. I did a lot of coding and typing exercises at the beginning. Fortunately, my teacher quickly began to introduce me to other things besides programming and typing. For example, the teacher taught us about what was going on around the world. I learned a lot of interesting things that were going on, and they helped to improve my interest in learning. My Raspberry Pi experience was very enjoyable due to the fact that I had more freedom to choose topics according to my area of interest. I didn't have to follow a pre-determined class syllabus but instead could use my preferred program to create projects and develop various skills in coding and programming languages.<n><n>###Instructions:<n><n>Please answer the following short answer question<n><n>What are your thoughts on the class project as well as writing the code?<n><n>Were there any difficulties along the way?<n><n>What did you learn about coding as well as how to think mathematically?<n><n>Output: I really enjoyed the class project because I thought I would learn how to program and solve problems. Also, I thought I would learn about the Raspberry Pi, which I knew little about before the class. I think programming and analyzing mathematics are essential skills for any person who wants to be a computer programmer or develop other programs, but they did not teach us to code or do complex mathematics. Instead, they gave us simple, step-by-step directions and we followed them without using any calculators. I thought

So: 42 = 40 - 10 + X, and X = 2, so we have: 42 = -40 + 21, and -40 + 4 * 21 = -60 + 84 = 24 + 84 =...211<n><n>**Solution To Question 3:**<n><n>So if Pete walked to the bus garage from his house and it was 5 blocks, and the bus drove him 20 blocks to get stamps. The bus should have driven 20 - 5 or 15 blocks. When he came home, we would know that it was 15 - 5 blocks since he traveled the opposite direction so I believe they should be added. Then the final answer would be 50 blocks.<n><n>**Solution For Q4:**<n><n>Let'm =

We can see from the list of all choices, the student can only select either a or b.<n>We can convert this to a boolean by using the math expression for a.<n><n>### 2.<n>In this example it is more complicated than 1.<n>For a and b, student can get the answer by doing math.<n>For c, the logic is like students choose a and b for question 1, and student can easily find the logic, and choose either a or c.<n>For question d, students can answer question d without doing any math, and that leads to students who answered question a and b are also likely going to answer question d, but not necessarily.<n><n>### Step 3.<n><n>This example has 4 alternative answer choices, this will make the machine learning model fail with high error. Also students can answer different question with different logic.<n>Students can get this wrong result.<n>For a, we can use the same idea as before.<n><n>For b and c, they are more complicated.<n><n>### Steps 4 and 5<n>From both examples, we know that the best way to implement this is to use boolean logic.<n>

Choices:  A: vent B: think C: shouting D: work off E: exercise<n>Output:		A<n><n><n>#### Solution<n><n>##### Part One:<n><n>To solve this question we have to create an equation where both Janet and Brenda share the same variable named "x".<n><n>If Janet has 9 more cards than Brenda we need to multiply Brenda's card value by 1 and add 9 to the value of Brenda.<n><n>$$5 x = 9 \\  \frac {5}{4} =Janet\\ Janet = 125\\ Janet = 9 + 125 = 134$$<n><n>If Mara has twice as much as Janet we multiply what Janet has by 2 and subtract what Mara has. <n><n>$$2x + 150 = X\\ Mara = 150 + 2x = 170$$<n><n>Finally $Janet + Mara = 211$<n><n>##### Part Two:<n><n>This question is very similar to part one however to find Peter's final destination we have to write a formula to replace the variables Janet and Brenda.<n>Peter is starting at his house which is 5 blocks away. He rides the bus 20 to get to the post office where there is a destination with a letter for 52 blocks. This was the answer to the first equation.<n>The final destination does not include the beginning destination of going to his house and thus the destination variable is "Y" where "Y" does not start at 0, unlike Janet and Brenda where they started with 5 and 9 respectively.<n><n>$$5 + 20 + 50 = 75\\ Y = 75$$<n><n>Since Peter is coming back the same way he uses the value of "y" from going to the post office.<n><n><n>##### Part Three:<n><n>Given that "n" is the total number of chairs and that the "b" is the number of blue chairs:<n><n>$$b + 3c = 10 \\4b + 3c - 13 = 0 \\ \frac {4}{3}b + \frac {1}{3} c -1  = -10 \\b - \frac {8}{3}c = 23\\ b = 0 (b can't be 0) \\3c=23

Choices:  A: bright B: pointed C: correct D: acute angled E: clear<n>Output:		A<n><n>### Solution<n><n>First, we need to find the number of Janet, and the second to last step, we need to work in reverse to find the number of cards. Then find the difference and multiply both sides by 211 (the number of cards).<n><n><p align="center"><n>  <img src="../assets/1.png" width="70%"/><n></p><n><n>Now, we need to compare 8, 15, 22, and 30, to find any pattern of that number, if yes, how many chairs there is, and if no, how to make a pattern based on the answer.<n><n>If you haven't made a pattern, look at the question to find any relation to find a pattern. For this program, you need to make a pattern and the question says there are green chairs three times the blue chairs, blue chairs are 10 in number. Therefore 3 times 10 = 30, and there are 30 green chairs, then from the information of the question, we can say 30 + blue chairs = green chairs + 3 blue chairs = green, blue chairs + 13 =26 green chairs + 19 =45, now here we got a pattern that we need to follow further.<n><n><n><p align= "center"><n>  <span><n>    <img src="../asset/3.png" width="85%"/><n>  </span><n></p><n>Therefore, we can get to the answer 45+26+19 = 80 chairs in a classroom. This answer can go above 120, as there are over 120 chairs in a room.<n><n>For the last one, use your judgment to make a pattern. To be honest, I'm not really sure to answer this. <n>

The answers are always different, but the trick is to find something similar to break down the question. In this particular case a good start with a good analysis is to break it down:<n><n>* You have 9 more than Brenda<n>* You also have 2 more than Janet<n>* You have twice as many cards as Brenda (but still less than Janet)<n><n>This allows us to calculate as Janet, which is the largest number, has 9 more than Branda. Thus, you end up at 159. Since Mara has 49 cards, thus she has a total of 211, which is the total number of cards in play.<n><n>For a more realistic explanation to one a bit more complicated, check out this nice explanation.<n><n><n>### Instruction 2:<n>For each problem please use your understanding of modular arithmetic and show the process step by step by answering each multiple choice question.<n>Input: Janet's and Mara's combined carpool expenses total $499.00. Add Brenda's expenses. Subtract Pete's bus fares. Divide by the number of people in the carpool. What is the amount of money left over when Janet's and mara's combined car expenses and Brenda's is added to Pete's bus expenses?<n><n>Input: Brenda is driving the carpool. Janet is always 5 minutes later than Brenda. Janet and Mara arrive together. What time did they leave?<n>Input: Janet is always 4 minutes late. She arrived at the party at 29:45. Brenda was 15 minutes late. Where did they go?<n>Output: Brenda was 13 minutes late.

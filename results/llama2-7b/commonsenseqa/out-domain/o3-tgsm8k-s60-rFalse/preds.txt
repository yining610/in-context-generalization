In (B), the expression "come off" has the figurative meaning "be perceived as."<n>2. In (E), the expression "come on" has the figurative meanings, as in "Get on with it" and "Let's get on with it."<n><n>### Instructions:<n>Answer the multiple choice questions.<n><n>### Input<n>Mary was unfamiliar with James, so she was uncomfortable speaking with him.<n><n>What word best completes this sentence?<n>Choices:<n><n>a. unfamiliar<n>b. familiar<n>c. comfortable<n>d. uncomfortable<n>e. cold<n><n>### Response<n>e.<n><n>### Exaimation:<n>1. (B) describes the way the sentence is written, which is (C). (E) is the way the sentence is spoken, as in "Get with it." (A) is an answer choice because it means unfriendly or antagonistic ("being cold in a room, for example").  (D) is the most literal reading of the sentence ("wasn't," which does not require the past participle, is not the most common). (B) does not fit the sentence well, and if (E) is the answer, then the question is incorrect.<n>2. "Come on, Mary. Let's get on with this," James might say, where the correct answer choice to the question would be (A), which means "disagreeable" or "cold."<n><n>### Input <n>"How can she make that judgment on me?" she demanded.<n><n>### Response <n>How can she judge?<n><n>### Examination:<n>1.

The standard will be defined by the user of the tool.<n><n><n>## Steps to Implement the tool<n><n>### User input<n><n>1. The teacher will submit the test they want to be assessed by selecting it from his/her computer. <n> <n>2. The tool checks the answers the teacher submits. The answers are checked using the logic instruction provided in the tool. If the teacher enters an answer of which the logic instruction is not satisfied, the teacher will be notified immediately. <n>  <n>    * Ex. The answer the teacher selects and the instruction 2(3)1=6 do not match<n><n>3. If the answers are matched with the logic instruction, the tool notifies the instructor that the answer matches the instruction.<n><n>### Response <n><n>Since this is a tool used in the classroom, we expect users to submit more than one set of answers.<n><n>In general, the teacher selects a group of students that have the same grade and has the same number of questions.<n><n>Then they submit the test.<n><n>After the teacher submitted the test, the tool will provide the students' logical answers. If the answers do not match the logic instruction, the teacher will be aware of the student's logical thinking skill.<n><n><n>### Instructions for 2018<n><n>Write a response based on the provided instructions.

Code-only answers are discouraged here.<n><n>Comment: The question is incomplete. It doesn't specify which "answer" refers to.<n><n>Comment: How many cards, how many blocks, how many chairs are they? Please specify.<n><n>Comment: If someone can edit it, so they read them properly.<n><n>Comment: Welcome to CodeReview! In the future, consider creating a minimal-complete-verifiable example (MCVE) https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve instead of a homework-like problem.<n><n>Comment: You cannot rely on the users entering the question correctly.<n><n>Answer: Just a thought on what the question was asking for in the task and the response to it:<n><n>It sounds like it is really just a multiple choice question that has a problem on it. You need to be able to determine exactly how many people are in the classroom and how many people there are in total.<n><n>Using that same logic, I have rewritten the question for clarification.<n><n>Instruction: Answer the following multiple choice question:<n>In a classroom, there 27 people. How many chairs does the classroom have when you include:<n>3 tables, 10 blue chains and 6 white chairs?<n><n>Answer: [How can i determine the number of chairs in the classroom with the given clues?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65677808/how-can-i-determine-the-number-of-chairs-in-the-classroom-with-the-given-clues)<n>I answered this question by taking the clues written down and creating a nested for loop (for example: n = total amount of chairs in the room)  If user input is given for each chair it is multiplied by the value of the loop. And then the amount of user input is taken (user input is taken here because I used 25 for chair and 30 for table in my question) if the user input is 25 the number of chairs and tables should add up to 55).

Since the order is in the reverse alphabetical order, John would not be able to get any other curry or city if he only has one choice, so he would have to eat the one curry and one city he has. This is because if there was a choice of both the curry and city after the clothing items, then John would automatically get it that way.<n>

Choices:  A: drugstore B: hospital C: bedroom D: car E: house<n><n>### Response:		<n>I believe an answer would be “B-Hospital”. The only places I can think of where someone would buy a bandage along with a hair brush would be in a hospita;l of course in the “hospital” section. A hospital has things such as band-aids and medications that need to be used, or at least that’s what I think of when I think of a hospital. I can only think of a drugstore that could sell a hairbrush; I don’t think of band-aids in this case. I also don’t think off a place where you would get a hairbrush and band-aids would be on a car. I don’t know if a hairbrush would sell in a car or not, but I don’t think a place where you would buy band-aids is in a car. I really think an answer would be “E-House” as well, but I think that a car can have something like that, but the hospital is best. I don’t think that you would go out on a car and say get me a brush AND a band-aid, so I am not going to choose that one.<n><n>### Input<n>There were 450 candy bars in the box, 3 quarters of them were orange, and 5% were chocolate.

Other people will probably answer in a different order and choose different answers. I think my answers are wrong because they are not the correct percentage. If we are going to choose the answer based on the percentage then what is the best way to figure it out, I wonder if there is a mathematical equation or even a more simple way to figure it out. I think people will find this question to be a difficult question since it is asking about a 5% and 92% and we are not told what kind of percentage that is it’s

Choices:  A: mail orders B: demand satisfaction C: place money on counter D: pay merchants with money E: spend money<n><n>### Response:		What is the sum to the doorstep? <n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n><n>## Expected output:A: mail orders<n><n>## #B: demand satisfaction<n><n>## #C: place money on counter<n><n>## #D: pay merchants<n><n>## #E: spend money<n><n><n>----<n><n>**Note:** If you get stuck on an example, try the following procedure:<n>- **Review the example** for the idea you are trying to practice.<n>- **Ask someone to explain it more simply or completely.** The example may have left something out that causes you to be stuck.<n>- **Read the code** several times until you **understand the flow of the program and the intended result**. Be sure that **each step is written correctly**.<n>- Use **conceptual tools**, like a flowchart, **to analyze the problem and understand the logic of the program before you start coding**.<n>- **Attempt a simple solution** first. This will help you identify what needs to be checked, especially in situations in which you have many conditions. **Break the problem down into smaller chunks**. For example, if you are presented with the task of computing a percentage (for example, 80% of a number), try dividing the problem into computing the percentage of a whole to one part. This will help you break the complexity down into smaller pieces.<n>- **Use a specific example**. For example, consider the difference between the statement “a/b ≠ c” and the statement “5/7 ≠ 3”. The first statement could apply to any two values, and you do not know which two. The second statement applies only to specific values.<n>- **Focus on the problem** and remember that the task is to solve your programming problem. When you attempt a solution to the problem, **start with a concept** to **represent the problem**, including an illustration that helps you understand the problem. **Start with the simplest solution.** The computer is able to “run the simplest solution” and verify that it is correct. If the simplest solution fails, take this result back to the diagram or your original representation to determine where you erred. **Continue to write code and test it until the simplest solution works**. When you get stuck, step away from the problem, rest, and take a different approach

Choices:  A: restaurant B: basement C: all buildings D: carpet E: synagogue<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The correct answer is 'carpet'.<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>Restaurants are typically cleaned to keep food safe to eat. The floors in a restaurant are normally kept clean to keep food safe to touch and eat. The synagogue is cleaned to keep the place of worship clean. Basement's floors are kept clean as the basement usually is not used too much for worship. <n><n>### Discussion: <n><n>The answer choices in the instructions are not sufficient. The answer choices are insufficient because 'E' is not a good answer. You could not say that the answer is a synagogue because not all buildings use carpet for flooring. The answer choices are not sufficient because a church also uses carpet on its floors. <n>

How many blocks did Pete travel in all?<n>Answer: 50<n><n>Input: In a classroom, there are blue chairs, green chairs, and white chairs. There are 10 blue chairs. The green chairs are 3 times as many as the blue chairs, and there are 13 fewer white chairs than the green and blue chairs combined. How many chairs are there in a classroom?<n>Answer: 67<n><n>### Input:What can happen in your mind while sleeping? Choices:  A: snoring B: talking C: get cold D: nothing E: might dream<n><n>### Response:		In your example, you stated that all the characters had 80 cards in their deck. That means that the sum of the deck of cards was 80. But you were then asked how many there were in all. But why all? If there are no uncounted cards in the game then 40 cards can only come from one of the individual players. So, this question is wrong.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>This instruction refers to a previous instruction but doesn't repeat anything significant so it may not need to be restated. It will be important to understand what your model did to be able to answer this question. To determine the cards that you had in the first place, the player would count them if they had a deck. From there you would add the cards from the other player. But the instruction itself doesn’t clarify this. Since there is no restatement of the previous instruction, it could be assumed that the two players each had 80 cards for each total deck, not individual card decks. So instead of only including 40 cards for each player we would need to change that calculation to 120 cards.<n><n>Answwer: E: might dream

Also the dog was not in the dog park outside the house that is a large open area or park where many dogs are usually allowed and played together. And the small apartment was not a choice because if it said stay indoors, that does not mean only in a room which was a bedroom.

Choices:  A: surface of earth B: rest area C: supermarket D: state park E: garden<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>A<n><n>### Input<n><n>B<n><n>### Response<n><n>Because a roadside stand is in a place where there is a rest area and a park, it can be that place is no grass because there is no grass to grow.<n><n>### Input A<n><n>C<n><n>### Response A<n><n>Because a field is a place where they are sold, the field itself is an area, the rest area is a part of the place.

For example, the answer to “how many cards do they have” is 211 and not the expected 151. The other problem is similar. They are not accurate because they ask you how far Pete walked from his house, not how much farther Pete walked from his home. To answer the question, we need to know what the actual distance was.<n><n>The answer to the question of how many chairs are in a classroom is 67 and not 27.<n><n>For example, if we take “A” and combine it with “B” we get “AB”. This gives us B. If we combine “A” and “C”, we will get “AC”. That will give us C. This gives us one for A, one for C, and another for D.<n><n>## Resources<n><n><n><n>## © 2021 Trilogy Education Services,  a 2U, Inc. brand. All Rights Reserved.<n>

The type of problem that you will need to solve is called a tally question. A tally question requires you to count the total of two or more integers. For example, if you count up how many marbles are in one jar, that is a tally question.<n><n>Follow the steps to solve these tally questions.<n><n>Write an equation to represent the problem.<n>In the equation, one side shows the total of how many marbles you have that side. The other side shows how many marbles we pick with each of those picks. The equation represents the number of picks that you have to make to find every last marble that you've picked up.<n><n>If the number of marbles that you've picked is less than the number of marbles in the jar, then you can count up every one of those marbles to solve the problem.<n>If the number of picks in the equation is greater than the total in the jar, then add the remaining marbles to the total that you've already counted. Use this approach with every marble that you're left counting.<n><n>In the steps to solving the problem, make sure to include the final answer. You only have to include the final answer if you can't solve for it later in the step.<n># Task<n>This section has a tally question that you need to solve.

Choices:  A: make music B: believe in god C: give speeches D: complete sentences E: build houses<n><n>### Response:		The only people that can correctly answer this question is you.<n><n>#### Explanation <n><n>I created this project after getting annoyed at my roommate who is a non-believer. I would always say, "God Bless you". He would reply, "Yeah, whatever". Later I started to realize that he doesn't believe in God. I thought about this after he said this one time. He would go on to say, "And people that live together are like married people, so why do married people ask each other every morning, "Why are you leaving me? and "Are you happy?". So then I had an idea. I am going to create a speech therapist program that will make every sentence that I ask, "Why are you saying that and "Are you happy?" I will say "A: make music", "B: believe in god" "C: give speeches" "D: complete sentences" and "E: build houses". I would love to see this in action.<n><n>#### Expected Output<n><n>Response to question: B - Believe In God<n>Because of the statement, "A: make music" and "B: believe in God" the program decides that the correct answer of the choices is "B: Believe In God".<n><n>Response to question B: Are you happy?. The program determines that the statement "C: give speech" is the best.<n><n>You can see the following screenshot for reference as the question was answered correctly.<n>

So if user enters a=b+7 I will display print(ans) which will be answer 'b' plus 7. So that if users enter 3 they get the answer 10. Then I want my code to add 5 to the result ans, which means user's input 3 is equal to the input 2*3 in the question. That why I multiply the ans+5 I make the right ans=2*3=13.<n>

He would be unable to hold his tools if he injured what? Choices:  A: hostility B: anger C: nose D: fists E: hands<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>**A** is correct.<n><n>We can assume that by 'his knuckles' we mean what would it be if 'John' was a single, collective person, rather than many individual people.<n><n>We can also assume that in order to be unable to hold his 'tools' John has to somehow use his hands without using his knuckles (the injured ones).<n><n>An interesting way to approach this is to ask the question: "How do we use our hands with knuckled?" or "How do the actions John took use his hands?"<n><n>That would indicate that 'John" used his hands in some form of action in conjunction with the actions of punching or punching the wall.<n><n>Since John can not use his hands, he can not use one or many 'actions' to hold his tools.<n><n>Therefore 'B' is incorrect.<n><n>John can not use his fists, because his hands can not be injured because they are the instruments he uses to hold his tools. Without his fists he can not hold his tools.<n>    <n>If John's fists are injured then it is not 'John' who loses his ability to use his tools. In fact, he uses the fists less then he uses his hands, but he can still use his hands.<n>    <n>Therefore the other choices are incorrect.<n><n>Therefore the answer is "John" can not use his tools because he can not use his hands.<n><n>### Input :  What is the smallest five-digit number that ends in nine? <n><n>### Instructions:Your answer may be a number, a word, or a phrase.

Mara has twice as many cards as Janet. How many cards do they have in all if Mara has 40 cards less than 150?<n>Answer: 211<n><n>Input: Pete walked 5 blocks from his house to the bus garage in Houston. He rode the bus 20 blocks to the post office to get some stamps. Later, he came home the same way. How many blocks did Pete travel in all?<n>Answer: 50<n><n>Input: In a classroom, there are blue chairs, green chairs, and white chairs. There are 10 blue chairs. The green chairs are 3 times as many as the blue chairs, and there are 13 fewer white chairs than the green and blue chairs combined. How many chairs are there in a classroom?<n>Answer: 67<n><n>### Input:What do people in the same family often share? Choices:  A: brown hair B: names C: two eyes D: will E: brains<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is Brains.<n><n>### Justification: Brains, names, brown hair, eyes, and even will are things often shared among members of a family. The phrase "share the same" implies that things are shared equally between siblings. In the case of names: for the most part, parents try to chose a name for each child that hasn't been recently used. If parents have five children, they don't want their children to be known as "Ralph Jr, Jr", "Sally Jr, 2", "Jack Jr, 3", "Bobby Jr, 4", or "Michael Jr, 5". To avoid this, siblings are often given names that aren't popular. Brains is chosen because most of the time, all the members of a family have access to the same education, whether it is through public or private schools, and they often share information about important scientific discoveries. Also, the brain is often used in describing the "smarts" or the "intelligence" of a person. Family members often compare their childrens' IQs, or they may even be used for competitions among members of the family.<n><n>### Input<n>  Input:  What does a man need to do to become a minister in most Christian churches?<n><n>### Response<n> The correct answer is he needs to have a good mind and a good heart.<n><n>### Response Justification:  A minister needs to have a good heart because he is a servant of God. He is responsible for serving and protecting the members of the church he is affiliated with. Without a good heart, a minister wouldn't have an appropriate focus.<n>The minister needs to also have a good mind.  A minister needs to be able to interpret the bible and study God. If a minister doesn't have a good mind, then he wouldn't be able to read the bible, and he would also lack the required learning that is required to be a minister.<n><n><n>

You want the total weight of things. To start with, you have 150, 211, and 50, which is 361. Now, you want to make Mara have only 25 more (211 - 186). You would end up with 211 - 25 + 27 = 293, which gives you 684. You then have the 5 more needed and the 25 + 5 added back, and we get a total of 709.<n>```<n>Note: For the question "How many cards do they have", the correct solution is 211 not 201

The correct answer choice is LOFT which is where clothes are usually left and stored for multiple holidays throughout the year. A, B, and E are incorrect choices because if he is looking for holiday decorations he would not know those words and the box would not have any of those either.<n>

Choices:  A: football stadium B: apartment C: surface of earth D: car show E: house<n><n>### Response:		<n>A: E<n><n>### Explanation:<n>This question has four choices labeled A-E that are intended to be very absurd. You can identify this by the use of the word "almost," which can be used to flag questions that intend to test your logic and reasoning skills. Answers A and E are clearly incorrect because we live on a planet and do not live in a stadium or on the surface of a car. If you were unsure, you could have chosen the "other" option.<n><n>### Your response and rationale:<n>Exercise the question that asks you where "almost all" people live because the question is intended to trick you into choosing a wrong answer. The question states that "almost all" live in certain places, so you must eliminate the other responses.<n><n>### Additional Resources<n><n>* [Writing Assessment Prompts and Examples](https://pages.uoregon.edu/jnielsen/WritingAssessmentPrompts.pdf)

This is not always possible. What if the only way we can know the final count is by summing a number of values together?<n><n>In that case, the sum of the products of the rows and columns is equal to the value of the product of the columns and the product of the rows.<n><n>### Example<n>Follow up on the first problem. Now determine the number of chairs in the class.<n><n>Input: In the classroom there are 50 blue chairs, 7 green chairs, and 13 white chairs. A student has to sit on a chair from the last two categories since there are more of them. Of the two remaining seats, one of them is a blue chair, and the remaining is one of the remaining chairs (green or white). The student wants to be the only one in his classroom. How many seats are left for the remaining students? How does this total compare to the total seats in the classroom?<n><n>Answer: The remaining student can choose chairs 423 or 424<n>Then 19 chairs remain plus 423 or minus 423<n>Additionally, the total seats is the sum of the product of the rows and product of the columns.<n>Thus, 2536 (green) + 3948 (blue) + 549 (white) = 6087 (a solution to the problem).<n><n>Input: A box contains 10 yellow cubes, 31 green cubes, 25 blue cubes, and 5 white cubes.

Choices:  A: grocery store B: refrigerator C: freezer D: plate E: supermarket<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Writing a program to compute answers is one thing, but proving your answers with code is another. How do you do it?<n><n>In Python, there are many data types and operators that may prove useful in computing answers to mathematical problems. Read this section to become more familiar with these data types and operators.<n><n>Python's arithmetic operators do exactly what you would expect them to do. There are a few of them, many of which are useful for computing mathematical answers. These operators have the following special rules in Python:<n><n>    + Addition<n>    - Subtraction<n>    * Multiplication<n>    / Division<n>    % Modulo (remainder)<n>    ** Exponentiation<n><n>Python's built-in data types are called **primitives**. The built-in data types in Python include the types that represent the data on your computer directly, rather than storing data that points to information. These types also provide powerful operators using mathematical functions and comparison operators. They include:<n><n>    **None**<n>    **Bool**<n>    **Int**<n>    **Long**<n>    **String**<n><n>Whenever an expression appears in Python code, Python evaluates the expression according to its rules for evaluation.<n><n>Let's take a look at a math example and work through it. The program asks for the answer to the expression, "What is ten more than three times ten?"<n><n><n>```python<n>x=30<n>y+y+3*x<n>```<n><n>Note that Python evaluates expressions using operators in this order: left to right, precedence, division, addition, subtraction and multiplication.<n><n>When Python completes an expression, it assigns the value to a variable and places any remaining operations in a queue. It then starts from the beginning and proceeds until the queue is empty.<n><n><n>```python print(y+y+3 * x)<n>```<n><n>Let's see it in action. <n><n><n>```python x=3<n>y=30<n>print(x+y+3*y)<n>#330<n><n>x=3<n>y=10<n>print(x**x+x+3*y)  #147<n><n>y=5<n>print(y+y-y); #0<n><n>x=10<n>y=5 <n>print(x-2*y)

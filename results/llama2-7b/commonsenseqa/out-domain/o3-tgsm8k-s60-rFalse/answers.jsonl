The third, I used a loop and a conditional to do a nested for loop, using the variables to count inside the outer for loop. The fourth, I used what I learned in the second problem and modified the first problem using a function that takes the variables and loops them in the function without hardcoding them into the problem statement.

A quick analysis shows that they are the only two questions in this set that share a similar logic. \n\nWe are given a number of balls, and we are told that we have drawn balls from a container until we have drawn 9 + 7 = 16 balls from the container. In both problems, we are going to know the amount of balls taken. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the first problem is: the container contained 16 balls. You take the number of balls and subtract the number of balls taken (9 + 7 =16 - 9), which gives us 16 - 2 =14 balls left over.\n\n\nTherefore, answer B", "answer": "E: air out"}

{"text": "A and C\n\nInput: A group of 4, a group of 6, and 2, 3 or 4 are in this bar. How many people are in the bar?\nOutput: 11.\n\n## Explanations:\n## In the first question, our goal is to find out the sum of Janet\u2019s cards with Brenda\u2019s. In order to achieve this, we must first decide how we can arrange the three numbers to create a new equation, with the first set being in the LHS and the second in the RHS. Firstly, we get one 9 by multiplying nine by one and adding one to Brenda and Janet, respectively. Secondly, we get 0 by multiplying six by two and two by Brenda as well as two by Janet. Lastly, we get Mara\u2019s by multiplying 150 by four, and subtracting it from Mara and Brenda twice. Hence, we end up with the following equation: \\\n$\\displaystyle S=9+9+0+3(Brenda-Janet)+4(150-Mara)$. We find our desired answer by solving for S: \\\n$\\displaystyle \\frac{S+9}{9}+3\\frac{Janet-Brenda}{6}+4=1$. Note that $211=183+28$ as expected.\n\n## In the second question, firstly, we need to find the total distance walked. For instance, in the first part, we have five blocks and 20 blocks, and hence, we can say that the total walk covered is $5+20=25$.

{"text": "C\n\n### Explanation:\n\nWe want to use the following approach:\n\n1. Make the problem a simple loop\n2. Increase the difficulty of steps 1 and 2 by asking multiple questions\n\nExample approach:\n\nFor the first problem, we can have one instruction to add 1 to a variable, and then a line of output to print the variable. Then add another instruction that outputs that variable plus the answer to the next question.\n\nIf we want to allow for two separate questions, two variable and two output statements will be required. A 16-bit processor could be used to store the variable of the first question. In the second question, a variable could be stored and the variable from the first question would be used. The resulting output for the first question becomes the second question, which the first result would be added to. Therefore, each question would require a set of four instructions: 1) an input, 2) computation in ALU, 3) address to output location, 4) output, and we have two questions and thus the first question would require 8 additional instructions, a total of 12 instructions.\nThe first solution shows a simple algorithm to print 211 from inputting 3 questions.\nIn the second problem, we use the same approach, but the instructions are split among different registers. For the blue chairs and green chairs we have a constant pool of 10. We will store the constants in register E. Using two instructions, we will move the constants into registers D and E. We will also need an increment instruction to address A1 to output the green chairs only.\n\nFor the third problem, similar steps are used, but in order to avoid a problem where the white chairs outnumber the other two chairs, we will use the instruction to move the green chair constant + the white chairs constant to register C and the result to A1.\n\nIn the last problem, we can test our register values, then output the letter after some simple arithmetic operations.\n\n### Additional Info\n\nThese simple steps can be used to solve the instruction, but they may result in overflow.\n\nThe overflow may be corrected by using a larger instruction set. We may also take advantage of the overflow by using it as part of the instructions.\n\nThe process may be improved further by using memory to store data.

If a snake touches the wall, it dies and the game ends.\n\nUser will first message the bot and give start move.\n\nFor example, \"Start\".\n\n\n\nThe bot will reply (snake_image) and wait for the user's instruction about the direction how to move.(up, down, right, left)\n\nIf the users want to move to right, they write \"right\", to move to left, \"left\", to move up, \"up\", to move down, \"down\".\n\nThe bot's logic:\n\nif users write \"start\", then send me snake_image\n\nIf the user writes 'right', then send an image of a snake going right\n\nIf the user's response is of length more than 4 characters, then reply, \"Start the game, please.\"\n\nElse check the left, right, up, down response and move the snack accordingly.\n\nIf the user types 'Stop', then end the game.\n\nIf user type 'Exit', then exit the game.\n\nif user writes \"Help\".\n\n\tsend Welcome Text", "answer": "C: saturated with water"}

Mara has 42 cards less than 145. Since we know 145 - 42 = 103. We solve for 42 in the equation. Which is 42 = (42 - 103). So that becomes: 42 - 145 = -103. Also we know 14 = 10 + X. So: 42 = 40 - 10 + X, and X = 2, so we have: 42 = -40 + 21, and -40 + 4 * 21 = -60 + 84 = 24 + 84 =...211\n\n**Solution To Question 3:**\n\nSo if Pete walked to the bus garage from his house and it was 5 blocks, and the bus drove him 20 blocks to get stamps.

{"text": "A\n\n\n#### Solution\n\n##### Part One:\n\nTo solve this question we have to create an equation where both Janet and Brenda share the same variable named \"x\".\n\nIf Janet has 9 more cards than Brenda we need to multiply Brenda's card value by 1 and add 9 to the value of Brenda.\n\n$$5 x = 9 \\\\  \\frac {5}{4} =Janet\\\\ Janet = 125\\\\ Janet = 9 + 125 = 134$$\n\nIf Mara has twice as much as Janet we multiply what Janet has by 2 and subtract what Mara has. \n\n$$2x + 150 = X\\\\ Mara = 150 + 2x = 170$$\n\nFinally $Janet + Mara = 211$\n\n##### Part Two:\n\nThis question is very similar to part one however to find Peter's final destination we have to write a formula to replace the variables Janet and Brenda.\nPeter is starting at his house which is 5 blocks away. He rides the bus 20 to get to the post office where there is a destination with a letter for 52 blocks. This was the answer to the first equation.\nThe final destination does not include the beginning destination of going to his house and thus the destination variable is \"Y\" where \"Y\" does not start at 0, unlike Janet and Brenda where they started with 5 and 9 respectively.\n\n$$5 + 20 + 50 = 75\\\\ Y = 75$$\n\nSince Peter is coming back the same way he uses the value of \"y\" from going to the post office.\n\n\n##### Part Three:\n\nGiven that \"n\" is the total number of chairs and that the \"b\" is the number of blue chairs:\n\n$$b + 3c = 10 \\\\4b + 3c - 13 = 0 \\\\ \\frac {4}{3}b + \\frac {1}{3} c -1  = -10 \\\\b - \\frac {8}{3}c = 23\\\\ b = 0 (b can't be 0) \\\\3c=23", "answer": "B: think"}

Then find the difference and multiply both sides by 211 (the number of cards).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"../assets/1.png\" width=\"70%\"/>\n</p>\n\nNow, we need to compare 8, 15, 22, and 30, to find any pattern of that number, if yes, how many chairs there is, and if no, how to make a pattern based on the answer.\n\nIf you haven't made a pattern, look at the question to find any relation to find a pattern. For this program, you need to make a pattern and the question says there are green chairs three times the blue chairs, blue chairs are 10 in number. Therefore 3 times 10 = 30, and there are 30 green chairs, then from the information of the question, we can say 30 + blue chairs = green chairs + 3 blue chairs = green, blue chairs + 13 =26 green chairs + 19 =45, now here we got a pattern that we need to follow further.\n\n\n<p align= \"center\">\n  <span>\n    <img src=\"../asset/3.png\" width=\"85%\"/>\n  </span>\n</p>\nTherefore, we can get to the answer 45+26+19 = 80 chairs in a classroom.

{"text": "D -> school\n\n\n### Explanation:\nThe above problem is one I have seen many times in math competitions of this caliber. The answers are always different, but the trick is to find something similar to break down the question. In this particular case a good start with a good analysis is to break it down:\n\n* You have 9 more than Brenda\n* You also have 2 more than Janet\n* You have twice as many cards as Brenda (but still less than Janet)\n\nThis allows us to calculate as Janet, which is the largest number, has 9 more than Branda. Thus, you end up at 159. Since Mara has 49 cards, thus she has a total of 211, which is the total number of cards in play.\n\nFor a more realistic explanation to one a bit more complicated, check out this nice explanation.\n\n\n### Instruction 2:\nFor each problem please use your understanding of modular arithmetic and show the process step by step by answering each multiple choice question.\nInput: Janet's and Mara's combined carpool expenses total $499.00. Add Brenda's expenses. Subtract Pete's bus fares. Divide by the number of people in the carpool.

Janet is always 5 minutes later than Brenda. Janet and Mara arrive together. What time did they leave?\nInput: Janet is always 4 minutes late. She arrived at the party at 29:45. Brenda was 15 minutes late. Where did they go?\nOutput: Brenda was 13 minutes late.

The second argument (\u201cIt rained 10\u201d) may also contain words, but must be followed by just a space (not a colon). \n\n### Response:(3-5) The rain must have come down less hard on Thursday, as the Thursday rain is less than half as much as Tuesday\u2019s. However, the rain falls equally at two days. So by the same reasoning that the Tuesday rain is more than half as much as Thursday\u2019s rain, Tuesday is more than half as many inches. In total, the Tuesday rain may have been 5 inches. Thus, 3 + 5 < 10, as Thursday\u2019stotal amount of rain is more than 15 inches.\n\n### Input\"It rained Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday.

{"text": "Answer: C\n\n### Input\nInput: One summer, a family of tourists was planning their trip and deciding what to bring. When a list of their luggage was passed out, only 2 pairs of shorts and 2 pairs of socks were missing. However, the same socks were not included among the pairs of shorts. How many pairs of each item did each person in the family pack?\n\n### Demostration:\nAnswer: There 15 socks in all. There are more than 15 pairs of shorts because every person in the family did not wear shorts every day. Some people, in fact, wore both shorts and jackets. There are 12 pairs of shorts among the 15 people. The missing pair is worn by only one person. That person is not alone in his bad luck: he lost one pair of socks too, a pair he was wearing each day. He is the fifth person in the family and he packed 2 pairs of short and the same amount of socks. Everyone else is okay. For example, there are five people wearing each pair of shorts. Two of them wear only one pair of socks each day. The other three wear a pair of socks each of the five days they stayed at the summer campsite. For the next summer campsite, they've learned their lesson and will have enough socks. Including the missing pair for that one person, that person will bring his normal amount of 12 pairs of socks. He does not need to bring extra to compensate from the single missing day. He will use his extra pairs of shorts to cover the days he is wearing a pair of socks.\n\n### Input Two weeks after the first week, the same person wears the same item of clothing four extra days before washing.  How many days later does his laundry need to be washed?\n\n### Demo:\nAnswer: 11\n\n### Instructions:\nTwo weeks after the first week.\n- 16 days in all-\n- 13 days of wearing the item-\n- Four days extra with four days with a change of clothing-\n- 1 week of being clean- 1 week from 6 days at the beginning of the second week-\n- 7 days", "answer": "E: produce"}

To find the ratio, we need the first part, the part that says \u201clegs,\u201d and the second part, the part that asks for the \u201carms.\u201d The answer is then the ratio of the two parts. In this case, the first part is \u201clegs,\u201d and then the second part is the \u201carms.\u201d We know that the first number in the ratio is the legs because Tina has 2 hands and 3 arms.  The \u201carms\u201d part of the ratio equals 1 hand and 2 arms, so the first part has to be 2.  The second part of the ratio has 2 arms and 3 hands, so the second part has to be 3.  The correct value of the ratio is 2:3, or leg : arms ::2:3\n\n### Question: How many days does Sarah have more than Joe?

None.\n\n### Explanation :\nI believe the question here is that he had a total of 200 identical balls and each ball is worth a penny. They all sold half of them for a total of 100 then lost 83 pennies, that makes the final cost 83 so we take away that from 100 and we end up with 17 pennies. So if his total cost was 17 then his total number of balls was 170 and the total weight of that would be 158 grams. So I figured the total number of balls he had was 340 before he sold 190 of the total so 340 - 190 = 150. Each ball weighed a gram so we multiply the total number of balls by a gram. 5", "answer": "C: saturated with water"}

{"text": "A\n\n### Demosntration:\n\n### A: Tennis Racket\nA tennis racket is a strung handle used to strike a tennis ball. A racket is a frame covered either partially or completely with strings. The ball is hit with a racket that is held between the player's hand and forearm. A grip is used to put the player in the right position. The grip wraps around the handle of the racket. When you put your hand on the racket with your fingers resting on two places called \"pronation zones\" you will be properly aligned for a forehand shot. Your palm will be on top. All players use a 21 cm long racket. The grip size also has a diameter on the inside handle and must allow the fingers rest.\n\n### B: Skill\nSkill in tennis is the ability to strike the ball into a desired target area. In the beginner stages, the ball is hit over the net, and it strikes the ground in the opposite corner. From a more advanced standpoint, players may hit serves or groundstrokes into a desired corner. The racket has a grip section that determines the placement of your hand. When your hand is in a dominant position, the racket should move smoothly. An advanced skill is the proper execution of a \"double-handed backhand\" that allows a racket to reach higher speeds and more power. When the backhand is hit well, the ball goes over the net at a high speed.\n\n### C: Competition\nWhen playing tennis, you can practice techniques that will aid you in reaching your full potential. At the higher levels of competition, more advanced techniques and strategies are used. Players will use the techniques to return the shots, anticipate the shots, and hit the ball with more accuracy.\n\n### D: Tennis court\nWhile playing tennis, you have two options. You can play one to one or two to two. A tennis court is also known as a doubles court, which is used to play the game with two people. The tennis court measures 78 ft (24 m) per side. The net is attached to the posts on both ends. When the net is removed, the surface of the tennis court is converted to a tennis court. This conversion can allow for an indoor or outdoor tennis court", "answer": "B: skill"}

{"text": "B A\n\n### Input :\nInput : There are not as many fish in the lake as there was in the summer time. The population of fish in the lake has grown more than 15 times since the population of fish in the winter time.  If there has been over 1,000 fish killed, how many fish were there in the lake in the winter time?\n\n### Response :\nIf there has been less than 260,000 fish in the lake, then the total number of fish in the lake is more than $254,999,999.99, since they killed less than $250,000,000 worth.  More than $265,000, and less than $266,000, gives us a value between $260,050,001.00 and $260,950,009.00, where we plugged in the $265, and $266 numbers.  We know that there had to be less than $260,500,001 worth of fish in the lake the entire summer, and then to answer that question that we now have an idea about the population of fish we have to multiply the number in the lake by 15 to get a starting point for how many fish are in the lake, then we just have to take away the 1,006 from the starting point to be able to determine the total number of fish the lake had before the fish kill. Since 5 times as many fish are in the river than there are fish in lake 825 less fish are in the river due to the fish kill. So the only way to determine the population of fish prior to the kill is to take the population of fish in river prior to the kill and multiply that by 2.5 then we take the answer we get and subtract 825 from it, and the final number we get is the answer.\n\n###  Input : Two train companies run a train line connecting two large American cities.

The questions will ask you to select sentences that are important, to summarize, and to interpret. You can choose to click on each individual question number or go to the last question and hit Continue to end your score.\n\n### Question 1:\n\n### Dem:\nIn 1990, a young man named Steve Baskin was arrested and later convicted of the murder of his elderly neighbor. His motive was simple, he wanted the large sum of money that this neighbor had. Baskin had also been convicted for stealing cars and other crimes in his previous years.\n\nBaskin is believed to have gained access to the victim\u2019s home by removing a stake that kept the wrought iron gate closed. He first ransacked the home and took jewelry and other small items of value that were not found by the police. There was also a safe in the home which was not found at the scene but it was presumed to be taken by Steve. When the police came to investigate the crime scene, only $10 and a single $100 bill was missing.\nHowever, the money that Baskin wanted was not the money that the victim had. The victim\u2019s money was in an account at the local Wells Fargo bank. The local bank believed, correctly as it turned out, that the $100 bill that was found at the scene would open the safe, which indeed it did. Baskin had taken the money that he wanted, $116,000.\n\n\nThis is all documented to have taken place about a year after Baskin had murdered his victim. There are three possible questions here, what is the value of the money washed out of the Wells Fargo Bank?, How did Steve Baskin gain access to his victims home?, What does the bank say as to how the money from the crime scene was determined?\n\n### Dem Answer:\n### Important Sentence: When the police came to the crime scene, only a $10 bill and a $100 bill were missing, but the money that Baskins wanted, $114,000 was determined to be in an account at the Wells Fargo bank that has nothing to", "answer": "B: raise"}

Assume that when you cut off a square, the rest of the bar has to be of the same shape, therefore there has to be as much chocolate in the bar as the amount you take off to cut.\n\n### Solution\n\nFor example, if Tom takes 4 square inches off his chocolate bar to cut it, it becomes 30 chocolate bars (it is now of a square shape)\n\nTherefore Tom needs 120 square inches of chocolate to create a square chocolate bar. His total square inches have only gone down from 124 to 4 square inches, so Tom would need to add 4 x 4 inches to create a square chodolate bar.\n\nThe equation would be: 120 sq. inches + 16\n\nThe equation of a square is: width = height + width/2, where width = chocolate bar length and height = chocolate bar height.\nIn this problem, what we want is the width of the square that will create a chodolate chocolate bar. Therefore we just replace the height for the width and solve for the width.\nTherefore we could write:\n\nwidth = height + width/4\nAnd from here, we get the width", "answer": "E: elevator"}

In fact, a study of over 12,000 people found that where people consume information has a major effect on how they think about the world. This was a remarkable discovery because the results showed a strong political divide between individuals who get their information from different sources.\n\nPeople who get their information from \"social media\" tend to be more liberal, people who get most of their information \"printed media\" tend to be conservative. This study also pointed out that the more people use \"social media\", the more liberal they become. This seems like a logical observation as those who use \"social media\" tend also to be young.\n\nThe people who do the most important job of deciding what happens in politics and to the people around us get their information from TV news, newspapers, family, and friends. The people who get their information from TV are most likely influenced by television and this has been noted throughout history.\n\nToday most people's exposure to the world view is based primarily on \"reality shows\" and \"social media\". The people who spend time on Facebook or twitter know that they are \"watching history as it happens\". This is a very distorted point of view and tends to be a \"short term\" view because it usually focuses on the \"here and now\".\n\n### Demos:\nChoose one of the letters written by the previous response.\n\n### Response 2\nThe media is a major source of information for people about the world.

Let's take you to breakfast some time.\"\n\n### Input 2:\nMorgan and her four colleagues take turns cooking lunch each day. Morgan is the chef. They have two options for each day: one of them makes Mexican food while the other makes Italian food. They decided to alternate the weeks. On the first week, Morgan makes Italian food and the rest of them cook Mexican food. The second week, Morgan and the first coworker switch and the fourth one make Mexican food and the other two coworkers make Italian food. How many people will be making Mexican food on the next Monday?\n\n### Solution 1:\nInput: There are 4 options, 2 of which are switched every week. It must be a permutation. There are 10 total possibilities for how the weeks play out, since the chef can be in any week, and there can be 2 chefs. Thus the answer should be 10.\n\n### Solution #2:\nInput: Use a double swap.\n\n### Input\nWhen the moon is full, it reflects twice the amount of light from the sun.

A full moon illuminates more in areas where floodlights are twice as bright as where flashlights are.  If you have 400 floodlights, how many flashlights do you need for the same amount of light?\n\n### Solutions\nIsolate the problem to light/energy. The Moon radiates twice as much as the Flashlights, because \n\nWhen you multiply both the light (10) and energy (100) then you get 1000.

{"text": "Answer according to the following options:  \" A, \"If your family were playing a board game in a toy store, the whole environment would already be fun and exciting. To go into a toy store, you could walk in on a nice weekend morning or have it as your next destination after doing errands at the grocery store.  You would most likely be greeted by a kind and energetic host who offers to guide you through every section of the shop.  You wouldn\u2019t have to worry about the toys being shoved and stacked on top of each other like you would in another store, because the toys would be beautifully displayed. They would be on shelves or set neatly on the floor at eye-level, so kids wouldn\u2019t be jumping on them. The toys would be organized so that it would be easy to find an item. Toys would have their own home instead of being lumped in with other miscellaneous items, such as tools, office supplies, furniture, and clothing, like they would be in other store.   And you would be amazed at the variety of quality, interesting, and imaginative toys. It would be wonderful to explore the toy store, pick out a toy from the many options, and have it ready for when you get home.  And you would never have to worry about bringing a toy back to the local recycling center after playing with it once. The toy would only be taken out of the box when it went straight into the box of toys to be brought home. And the fun doesn\u2019t stop there. With so many toys to explore, you could revisit at least a dozen different places and dozens of activities with each of your family members. You could have them work together, play pretend, or just have fun playing with their favorite toy of choice. \"B\"If your family were going to stay home to play a board game, you\u2019d be playing in your comfy living room, most likely in easy view of the TV, the refrigerator, and the washer/dryer.  Maybe you\u2019d be getting ready to go to your room to take a bath, or coming in for a snack.  You\u2019d have a hard time being in the same room as the board game, since the board game gets all the attention. The board", "answer": "B: home"}

{"text": "A\n\n### Input\nHow old was Tiger at the last PGA?\n\nIf a friend asks you how old he is, you need to know the year of Tiger's birth (not date, month) and what year the PGA happened (not year of his birth).  \n\nThe number of years Tiger is older than he was at the last PGA is easy to calculate.  If he was 41 years old at the PGA, and he is currently 42, he is 1 year older.  At 40 he was 1 year younger, at 39 he was a year older, and he was 35 at the first PGA he competed in.\n\nThe last step is to solve for the current year and you're done!\n\n### Response\nThe PGA in 2019 happened when Tiger was 41 years of age.  \n\nWe know from solving for the last year Tiger competed in the PGA, he was 35 years younger in 1999.  This makes for 1999 - 1998 = 1994 (year he was born).  \n\nNow we know the year he was born, the year in which he competed in the most recent PGA, and the current year in which he is competing in the PGA.  We subtract the current year from the year in which he was born (1994). From here we know that Tiger is 26 years younger than the year in which he participated in the first PGA. Subtracting year of his birth from the first PGA gives us 2020 - 1994 = 26 years. (There are 12 months in a year when he was born so divide this by 12, which will give you the number of years.) Tiger is 2 years old than the first PGA.\n\nSo to answer the the last PGA happened when Tiger is 21 years older than he was in the year of the first PGA. That puts the first PGA in 1998.  But by subtracting the current year from the last PGA in 2551, you are not accounting for Tiger's being 21 years older.\nSo to get your solution you should divide 2", "answer": "A: restaurant"}

{"text": "Ideally, a school system would like to be in a dense, urban, residential, neighborhood where it can draw students from all over with nearby housing and a high walk or bike count. In some places, the residential neighborhood location will not work because the school will have a negative impact on real estate values in the area. In that case you will need to move it to a commercial area where it can be built easily without disturbing a residential area. However, if you move the school too far, especially in a community or building zone, your district will lose income by not having nearby stores and businesses which will lead to a decrease in your income. The ideal location is a prague zone because it includes the three other zones in one comprehensive location that will be easy to establish, attract students and not inconvenience residents.\n\n### Input and Demonstration: The population of a city on Mondays has 20% fewer people than on a Saturday when 1% more people live here.

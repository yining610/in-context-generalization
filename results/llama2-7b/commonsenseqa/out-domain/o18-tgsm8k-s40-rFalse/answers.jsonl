As we know if some quantity is x% more or less than 55 we can still keep the above equation in mind just we'll need to change that number.\nHere, 55 will not change as it is constant here, so the numbers which are x% more or less should be changed to 468. So x in the above equation becomes x = -55.\n\nSo here\n912+(-55)+(-55) = 555+(-110)\n\nSolution -> x = -55\n\n```\n\n```r\nsol = 912 + -(3*((912)/36) - 1) - (468)/36\n```\n\n```\n\n## How to submit your solution?\n\nFor better user experience we don't want the solution page to be cluttered with solutions that might have been submitted many weeks before the answer is found.\n\n**Solutions submitted here will be shown when the problem is marked as complete on the main page with details of the problem and a hyperlink to the solution text.**\n\nIf you wish to post your solution, either\n\n- Upload it [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CW4yG-KbQKUX7Qo_-YG9_-70Eh8jV2h5)\n- Or post it in issue at `github.com/TechnoCult/SATProblems` repository.\n\n## How to rate", "answer": "A: factory"}

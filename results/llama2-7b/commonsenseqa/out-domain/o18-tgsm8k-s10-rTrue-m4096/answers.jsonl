How much will you have each week?\nOutput:  You take 1 cup, at the end of the week.\nSo you will have 3 cups at the week.\nSo the final  answer is (B)\n\nInput:The number of cups it rains every 4 days is the same as the number of cups of water in the lake. How many gallons of water are in the lake?\nOutput: Every 4 days it rains one cup. Since the lake has a set volume, it rains one cup every 4 days.\nSince raining 1 cup is the same as drinking 1 cup, the lake is the same as a cup, since the lake will always get one cup of water every 4 days. This is the same as taking a cup from a lake that has one cup of water. So one cup of water is one cup of water. Since cup is 4 days, so one cup of water is 1.\nSo the final cup is cup is (C)\n\nSo the final cup of are in the lake.\nSo the final lake.\nSo the answer is cup of lake. So the final cup lake of the lake.\nSo (\nSo the final water in the lake.\n\nSo the final answer lake. 1", "answer": "A: cook dinner"}

Since the dining room is more than 2/5 of the length of the hall, the dining room is at least 2 x 10 ft x (10 ft 6)/5 = 40 ft.\nTherefore, the dining room must be at least 40 feet.\n\nAnswer: The difference in square feet can be calculated by subtracting the length by subtracting the width from the length subtracting the hall's width. In this case, since the hall itself is 4 times 0 the square, then subtracting 20, the dining which subtract 3 square feet subtracted square square feet long subtract the length it square feet.

This ends up with 10 * (7 * 4) or 7 * 7.  Diana has (7 * 2) dimes. To find out how many nickels there would have been, multiply the 2 times 7, getting 14 nickels. She has 14 nickels left. The correct answer would have been 71, but we are missing 20 cents, so there are still 49 cents in the piggy bank. Since the question asks about the total amount of 20-cent change, the amount is Diana (7*2)+14(2*2)+((10*7)*2)+(49*4)-20=<<7*2+2*(4)+(10*7)*14+((10*2)+(49)*2-20=<<4969>>69>>69\nOr, since the first number is a power, 9 * 4 and the power of 9, Diana (7*4)*(14*9)=<<(49*14=$$=636>>$$$<0.39>>0.39.\n(149>$<<(49>$=$$0.39>>$$0.39\nSo the final answer of 39>$<<(3*3=9>>$<<9>>9=18\nSo the answer was 18.", "answer": "C: pond"}

If the police have strong evidence, they would put the two criminals in solitary confinement and they would never be released. And if the police can not find any evidence, they just put the prisoners in jail for the minimum period of time and let them off.\nYou will be given two secret numbers, let's call them X and Y.

This suggests the question to be answered is how the man could spend $2 to maximize his profits.\nIn other words the problem is: \"What is the largest natural number X such that X(X+1)/2 < 2\".\nThe largest natural number is 7 because 7(7+1)/2 = 3.5 <2.\nThe man has made a profit of $3.5 using eggs instead of oranges.\nHowever this profit comes at significant risk of loss, as 2 eggs could get cracked (7 *.4)/2 = 2.75 could cost him if he uses eggs. If using oranges 2 * (3 *.4)/2= 5.75 could cost the man.\nTherefore the profit using eggs would not be a wise decision.\nFinally the question asks \"How did you find the answer?\" the method is to determine how a profit can be made in the worst case by using n number x of eggs n eggs.\nA person can buy n eggs for n and pay 2 per egg for one of eggs and for oranges.\nA person can get an egg for an egg of and for 5 and an egg of an egg for 6 and 2 eggs and two 3 eggs", "answer": "C: plain"}

The roof receives the snow on it from the upper air and sometimes it does snow in the summer time in some parts of the world.\nSo, North Pole has the least amount of snow because it is in the lowest (farthest north) on Earth that has nothing in it besides snow, and it is the coldest place on earth.

If there are 5 day perfect weather then it should be 5*2 = <<5*2=10>>10 days with perfect weather.\nDuring the second trip it was perfect weather, so it should be 10 days of perfect weather during the trip.\nNext rain starts after 10 days. So, next rain starts 10 after one day is raining again and he could harvest crops.\nSo, next rain starts after 11*2/5~=<<11*2/2=5.5>>5.5 days and there are 5 days perfect weather left so it rains the first rainy day.Next it rains because of the trip was perfect weather.\nSo, it will rain for 5+2*5 = <<5+2*5=7>>5 rain more days and the next month after rain.\nSo, next rainy day =<<5+1=6>>6 day and rain during the month.\nSo the final rain day = <<5+6=1111>>1 rain day and after + 5=12 rain day to final rain after one day left in th trip.\nSo the final rainy last and final day was final in his trip and the next day is rainy after 10 the next one left perfect weather is 5 after and next rainy and the next month after 5 is 10 and the next month is 6 and after 10 in the last trip was 5 and next is 11 last trip.\nSo, the next is a day after", "answer": "D: compete with each other"}

Having sex happens at the end of the process of \"having drunk\", so we can just ignore it for now.\nAlso, we are assuming that these are your only choices.\nAfter thinking about it, there does not seem to be a real way to have a party without having at least one person drunk (this person will do the heavy drinking for the whole party).\nWithout a drunk person in the party, everyone but 1 person is left.\nWhen you want to have sex, you obviously can't have drunk.  Thus, every instance of having sex after calling 911 can not have any party going on before it.\nSo calling 911 will have drunk people at the party.

Weirdate is a compound word though, and compound words will not be valid for this answer.\nD: kind.  Kind is a compassionate word.

{"idx": 675, "text": "Choice D is the correct answer. The word \"trivial\" as suggested by \"trivial conversation\" or \"small conversation\" means \"of little importance rather than of great importance or significance\". It is therefore not necessary to \"meet\" anyone, nor to \"make friends\", as in \"make friends by having trivial conversations\" you are implicitly told that \"you already have and just want to know them.\" In fact, the suggestion is, you can \"meet new people\", in the sense of people you don't already know, in the process of mingling or socialized through this activity. A: \"make friends by having meaningful conversation,\" means you already have them and you want to reinforce these existing relationships by finding things you all enjoy to talk about while you are together, as opposed to \"make friends by having conversations about boring, irrelevant, unimportant topics that bore you and them while you'd really like to be doing something else, and which will be totally forgotten in a moment,\" as is the case with Choice E.

Therefore, a waiter goes to the garden at the back and buys 10 fresh strawberries. He brings these strawberries to the caf\u00e9 himself. If he pays $1 per strawberry, how much does the waiter pay?\nOutput: The caf\u00e9 originally had one strawberry which cost $1. So the total amount paid before the waiter goes to buy more = $1\nThe waiter bought a further 10 strawberries + the initial strawberry = $11\nThese strawberries cost $1 each so the waiter paid $1 + $10=$<<1+10=11>>11\nSo the waiter paid $2 more than the total cost of buying the strawberries.\nThe total cost of buying 10 strawberry is $11.\nSo the total amount paid in total is $11 + $11= $<<11+11=22>>22\nSo the final answer if if $11 + $X = <<1+X=X>>X\nSo $1X = <<1X=X>>X, and X is the total cost of the 10 extra strawberry\nSo X = $110 + $1 =  $2,\nSo, A = X, meaning that = <<X=2>>2\nSo the total amount, is 2\nSo the final, answer is X = <<2>>2\nSo X is 2.\nSo the final is 2.\n\n\n\nInput: A pizza costs $5.

To do so, we first assume that the angle measured from the starting point to the destination of 40 degrees is a side of a triangle that has side-lengths of 1 and 1/2. Then, we subtract one-half for the hypotenuse and get:\n\nSo the starting trip distance would be 1.2\n\nTherefore, the total distance traveled is 1 + 1.2\nSo the total distance traveleled is 1 + (1 + 1/2 =<<1+1=1.5>>1.5\nSo the final distance is 1 + 8.5/2\n\nSo the final answer distanet is <1+2(1.2>/2=18>>\nSo the final answer would be 18\n\nSo the final answe can be answered be 18\nThen the ans can answer should be 8\nTherefore the answe should be answered can 8\nSo the answe should be 8 can answe should be\nSo the answe need to be 8\nSo the final ans we need answe can be 8 be 8nswethis can be final answe need 12 answere is the ansyou need <1 more answe to get hereansmore answe to gett the\nSo the", "answer": "B: table"}

If the largest multiple of two whole numbers is 36 and the largest multiple of eight whole numbers is 480, there is a common multiple between these two sets of numbers. If one of the numbers in the set from Step 1 is greater than one of the numbers in Step 2, what is the largest possible difference between their values?\nOutput: Let f be the first number in the first set and g be the first number in Step 2. Therefore, f is the larger of f and g, and g is the smaller of f and g.

Children's pools on the other hand have no danger of predators and have a much smaller surface area than a larger body of water such as a pond. Also there will be smaller fish and amphibians in the children's pools, whereas in a pond, you will find a larger amount of big fish since they are naturally in a bigger body of water. A pond will have more surface area and deeper depths because a deeper pond will have more fish which in turn attracts more predators such as alligators, fish, or larger amphibians.

He's painting his friend's house. He also paints his own house. How many hours have been spent painting?\nOutput: There are 60 minutes in an hour, therefore one hour can be expressed as 1/60 of the second. 120 is therefore 120/60 of the 12th hour.\nTo find how many hours he's painted 2 of his house and 3 of his friend's house, we first find out how many hours each house takes to paint. 2 of his own house is 2/(1/60 of 12th hour) of 24 hours. Similarly, 3/12 of his friend's is 3/(1/60 * 1/60)= <<3/60=1/360=<<1/60=18>>1.3 hours. 3 of his friend would be 3/1.3 of 1.3 = <<3/1.3=2.3>>2.3 hours.

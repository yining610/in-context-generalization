So, x should have a value between 0-10 (which is less than 11. So, we will do our math with 9.\nIf the function is invoked with 9 as the parameter, the output should be 4 (because 9-3=6 which is 3 more than 3). So, 4.\n\n### If Function:\n\nIn the if statement functions we can create a basic function and make sure a certain condition is met if a certain parameters are passed. The if statement function will have 3 arguments.\n\nFirst argument is a boolean statement that will determine if the function should run or not. The second argument is the output printed, and third argument is the name of the variable that accepts the input.\n\nFor this basic challenge, if the number you are trying to subtract is greater than 4 then the function should return 4.

Choices:  A grocery list is arranged in the form of a triangle with one item at the top, two items below that and so forth.  The items in the list increase in value by 25% from top to bottom, then 100%.  If a shopper is given a certain number of 45-cent stamps for free, then there is a certain number of items they can purchase and still be eligible for a 15% saving.  Choose a whole number between 1 and 10 that is less than the price of 65% of the food in the grocery list.\nOutput: 0  \nANSWER: This question can be solved using Dynamic Programming where we first calculate how many items the user wants to add to their shopping list.  Then we calculate the percentage of items in their shopping list that will cost less than or equal to a certain number of stamps.  In case you have never used Dynamic Programming, I will write a post on this.

You must first determine the average amount that the average person has each week. This value will be represented by a floating point value, thus, you must round it off to four decimal places so that its value does not exceed 255.6. Next, you should also determine the amount that it costs per grocery item, based on how much the item costs for each food group. The values would be $1.25 for meat, $5.00 for vegetables, $4.75 for fruits, and $0.94 for milk. As you can see, the value for milk is very small, so you should not store it as a float. You can choose to store the value as an integer so that it only takes up one byte, but that would result in lost information, so you should round it off to four or five decimal places", "answer": "C: clothing store"}

However, there\u2019s one other place, outside traditional arithmetic, where we can say a negative number is larger than a positive one. The answer is in the world of -ratios, which are fractions that relate two measured variables, such as lengths, temperature, weight, area, or volume, and the two fractions have one value as the top. To read negative ratios properly, you\u2019ll need to reverse the sign of the top number, keeping the sign of the bottom number. For example, -2 1/2 denotes minus two and one-half units. To solve a ratio, you\u2019ll need the reciprocal (to divide the ratio by). For example, to find the reciprocal of -4 1/5, you divide -4 by 5 and multiply by 1/5, which returns -.8\nOutput: A", "answer": "D: cupboard"}

Then [edit] your question to include a [mcve] of your attempt, including the expected output based on the sample input.\n\nComment: Are you getting stuck on one part, or is it too much too ask for us to solve everything by ourselves?\n\nAnswer: Your input-output pairs look more like test strings than the usual inputs or answers in a programming challenge. In general, the challenge will tell you the language (e.g. C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Python).\n\nThe \"real\" input-output pairs in such programming challenges often only relate to one question. They either give the whole challenge as a text description where you can solve it line by line, or they give a text and all the input/output pairs in code format so you just have to write the functions and call them to arrive at the answer.\n\nIn general you can also go to websites like [this one](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and solve as many problems as you would like. You can then look at the solution explanations of other users and also the discussion forum if you have further questions about a specific problem or solution. There you will find people trying to solve any possible programming challenge.", "answer": "D: earth"}

If we input 3, then it outputs the right answer. If we input 4, then it outputs the left answer. This is working perfectly! \n\nBut when we input 5 we get the wrong result! Why?\n\nWell, when you input a number and the array has 3 items, they will be compared the `array.length - 1`. So in our case when we input 5, the array length is 6 since the middle is not found in the array. Therefore, we start comparing at index 5 and do not find `2 2 3` in this array and the index after that (6) has less items in it (it is empty in this case). So, we return `0` since `-1` index is empty. So, we get MATCH: 0 - 0 - 0 when we input number 5. But this should be MATCH: 2 3 - 0 since the right match is found at index 2 so it should match `2 2 0`. \n\nIn short, when the array has less than `arr.length - 1` items, binary search will not work correctly. So, if we check with arrays of size 2, 3, 4 and 5, we do not get expected results and binary search won't run correctly. So, in order to fix that, we should stop binary search when there is less than `array.length - length` items.\n\n### Part II: Binary Search\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nMATCH!: 9 4 3 2 1\n```", "answer": "A: being married"}

This means that there are 8 squares in the lower left section of the grid. \n\nIn set 2 there are 2x2 = 4 girls. This means that 4 squares will be in the lower right section of the grid.\n\nThe rows of the grid have 2 and 1 squares respectively, and the columns have 4 and 3.\n\nIn set three, the number of girls is unknown so we cannot determine the number of squares in that box.\n\nThe number in the lower left box is the total number of people in set 1, which can be determined by counting the number of rows and squares (8). \n\nThe number in row one is the total number of boys in set 1, and can be calculated by counting the number of the rows in set 1 (4).\n\nTo find the total number of girls (A) we can subtract the number of boys (x B) from the number of people in set one.\n\n14 = 8 \u2013 (3 * 4 )\n\n10 = 8 - 6x4\n\n 11 = 8 - 24x2\n\n3 = 8 - (14x2x2)\n\n3 / 2 / 4 = 8 - (24x2) \u00f7 10\n\n4 = 8 - 72\n\n2 = 8 - 144\n\n4 = 1 - 18\n\n4 = 0 - 1\n\n2 = 0 - 0\n\n-12\n\n4 = 40\n\n6 / 7 = 40 - 92\n\n-13\n\n26 / 28 = 40 - ( 4 * 4)\n\n-26\n\n46 / 2", "answer": "D: think creatively"}

{"text": "A. redemption\n\n### Input\nHow many sides do you have if you play a game with a cube and two straight lines drawn on it?\n\n### Response\nCube games can't be played with lines because the lines have dimensions. Cube games have only one dimension, which is why they are played with just the cube.\n\n### InputHow many sides does a cube have?\n\n###  Response: \n\n\n    A cube has six sides, but they are all identical. So, a cube has six identical sides and six identical faces. The cube has six sides (2-dimensional figures) and six squares (3-dimensional figures)\n    A cube is also known as an \"orthohedral solid\".\n\n### Input   144\n\n### Response :\nA: 144 is exactly equal the surface area of a cube of unit length 1. Which means that all edges of the cube are equal!\nThis is because in a cube of length 1 each dimensions of the cube have the same unit length. So, this cube has to have exactly 1 length, 1 width, and 1 height. Also, when you calculate the surface area of this unit cube, you end up with 144, because you multiply the length 1 by the width, height, and volume. Each of these has unit length, and therefore the sum of them has unit length too, and so it will be equal to 144.\nBesides not having side, the cube only has one surface, because it has only length, and height and has no width. Hence,\nC: 144. The 1 dimensional cube is a unit cube because all of its sides are same length and there are six of them.\n\n### How many points does a 3x3 magic 31 grid contain?\n\n### Solution\nA:   37\n### How many blocks do you need to move in order to get every vertical 7-block sequence?\n\n### B: 2", "answer": "A: redemption"}

{"text": "The golf carts are usually protecting the young adults at the home of the celebrity\n\n### Input : The two best friends, Tuan and Tommy, decided to rent a movie for their house party. They were only allowed to pick one movie, but the two had opposite preferences. Tuan preferred action movies, and Tommy preferred horror movies. They agreed to flip a coin to decide which movie they should get. If there is a probability of 1/15 that the movie they get will match with their preference, then what is the probability that the movie they get is a horror movie?\n\n### Response : \nThe probability that the movie they pick would be the horror movie is 3/15 since the movie they won has an equal chance of being horror as it is of being action. So the probability is 1/5 that horror is the movie they pick but the probability that horror is the movie is 3/5 which is the probability that horror is their third pick after the second pick.\n\n### Input How much money must an employee save into her retirement account each month if she wants to save 7% of her annual salary by the end of the year?\n\n### Respond  : $808\n\n### Question:\nBruno is trying to fill a bucket with water.

He repeats this procedure until he finishes the bucket. How many glasses does he have to pour for with to achieve this result? \n\n### Response  : \n\nBruno needs to use 3/4 of the water each time for one glass and pour water to equal volume into the bucket because there is a 3rd of water that is already unaccounted for, which means that he could already use 1/4(3/4) since 4 x 1/4 = 3/4\nThe number of glasses to try is 1-(1+1+1-3/4), and this expression simplify down to (1/4).\n\n### Input \n\nAmy and Matt are both thinking about getting a coffee from Starbucks.

If a $1 coin has 21.58 grams of silver in it, how much silver is in 21 $1 coins?\n\nThis problem has a simple math solution, where we can easily determine that $21 * 21.5 = 459 grams.  However, the math will fail for a variety of other problems, e.g., there are different weights for different denominations for which arithmetic fails, e.g., the quarter is lighter than the dime.  The math fails for other reasons: for example, a coin, if shaped as a square of side l, has a volume V = l^2 h/2 where h is of length d where d = 2r.  Hence, a square shaped penny will have much more volume than a one-third-copper and two-thirds-zinc coin such as a dime, since the volume V = l^3/3h. In short, arithmetic fails to solve such problems because it fails even to give the answer to questions such as \"how much silver is in 459 grins?\" but it is also not enough to say \"use log\" because there are situations such as \"how much does one-third-cooper and two-thirds zinc cost to one-", "answer": "B: piggy bank"}

If 1 meter represents 1s, how many meters taller does an adult person compared to a 150 cm child need to swim across the pool in a second?\n\n### Input and Challenge:\n\n```code\n\nchallenge = ['Adult person: 800 seconds. Child: 13 seconds. 15 m shorter: 13 m / 800 s = 0.0167 m/s. So, an adult person needs to swim 0.0667 m shorter for each second.', '1 m = 100 cm. Therefore, the child needs 100 cm - 0.017 m = 99.983 cm per second. An adult person therefore also needs to swim 100 cm shorter for each second.', '5 m2 = 4.67m2 (0.5 m). 4.67 m2 / 0.4 s = 11.67 m2/s. Therefore, an adult person needs 11.66 m2/s]\n```", "answer": "D: further education"}

On each iteration of the loop, the inner loop iterates through the array and checks to verify if the number contained in the array is a multiple of 5.  The last line of the example function defines the product between the integer to be checked and the value of the previous line, or the value of 'total_num % 5' in this case.  On the last iteration of the inner loop, the function is checking the final value inside'mat4', and the value of 'total' will be multiplied by the product that is stored for 'i' which is the last index in the arrays'mat2','mat3', and'mat4'.

All three coin sets must be exactly $500 worth of coins.  The coin sets you receive must also be completely unsorted.  How can you do it?\n\n### Dictionaries:\n- a set is a group of the same thing arranged in order\n- unsorted coins mean there isn't an order you can put them in, in terms of the number of coins for each type of coin\n- complete means there must be enough copper of each to make each coin equal to the dollar amount\n\n### Examples:\n- if you have coins that are worth $352 you have 20 quarters, and 15 quarters worth $68\n- if you have 261 dimes to be worth $261, that means there are 200 dime worth $261 each. Also then there are 12 dimes that are worth $0.01 each.\n- if you have $150 worth copper, that means you need.000075 of copper to fill each quarter. That means there needs to be.00015 quarters in the set. That means the set must be one hundred and fifty quarters.\n- if you only have $142 worth copper, the quarters are off by two. Also, the other sets could be off two too, so that $5 is only worth $4.20 worth of copper. That means that there must be only 66 quarters in the set, and there is no way of filling that coin set up to fill up $500. There must be only one set for the quarters because they aren't enough coins to fill $500\n- if you have $.01 less copper than you need, the dimes will be off by two. The three sets have to be within one dime. That means if you have too little copper, there have to be only 199 dimes for the set. It", "answer": "C: hockey game"}

That makes it hard for people to grasp what's happening and how the budget cuts might impact them.  One example is a program to help families with four or more children. About 33,000 women rely on the Women, Infants and Children program in Arizona.  The state decided to cut that program by 70%, and women were justifiably alarmed.  So, one Arizona congressman decided to illustrate how big the cuts would be.  He laid his congressional salary and a $100 paycheck for his son on a table in front of his district office and asked a local reporter to stand in for the single mom.  Then he did the math with his hands.  That reporter wrote a story after that.\n\n## Input question: What is a person doing (not saying) in the scenario presented?

{"text": "My first instinct may just be to add more interesting activities in learning the material we're studying. I wouldn't choose D because learning is never free. Even when someone is given a free education, they still must do a lot of work themselves in order to comprehend the material. I feel that learning material that is too uninteresting may be a better way to not like learning at all because it takes the joy out of learning to where it may not be considered an enjoyable activity anymore, and it would be better if there was something that was more fun to do rather than simply doing homework. I would also choose A because if the curriculum and the teaching of the class are boring to someone who is learning, they will most likely not enjoy learning no matter what they're doing.

If you have $29 you spent $36 - $29 = $7 and would still have $1 in your wallet.

{"text": "A\n\n### Input A:\n\nThe process of getting a divorce can be very costly, as there are lawyer fees, child support, alimony, and many court proceedings that must be taken care of. These expenses can add up in a hurry, causing the lawyers to charge astronomical amounts.\n\n### Input B:\n\nThe process to stop being married to one another could be costly, as it involves getting divorce lawyers, alimony, child support, and many court proceeding. These expenses can quickly add up, making lawyers earn astronomical fees.\n\n### Example:\n\nIt takes $30 for each person to drive from home to school, which is 20 miles away. They decide to share a car and take turns driving. If Jill and Maria each only have enough money to pay one week\u2019s bus pass, how much money should each pay and how many days will it take for them to make the payment?\n\n### Example 1:\n\nThe cost to make the payment equal $60. You could say $60 = $30 for each journey or $30 for both journeys. However, that means that you have to pay twice the money you were originally expecting ($30 as opposed to $15), making it impossible to make the payment unless you pay twice as much.\n\nThe only way for this to be possible is if the cost is $15 for each person.\n\n### Demo:\n\n#### Example 1:\nJon is running from his mom's house to the grocery store. It costs 33 cents to take the bus, but that takes 20 minutes because the bus is usually full. Jon runs so fast that he takes 5 seconds less per mile than the bus (so each mile he runs costs 63 cents). The bus stops at the grocery store, where Jon can eat while he waits for the next bus back to his mom's house. For every 5 miles that Jon runs, he saves 1 dollar in bus fare; this means that the distance is equal to the bus fare (33 cents).

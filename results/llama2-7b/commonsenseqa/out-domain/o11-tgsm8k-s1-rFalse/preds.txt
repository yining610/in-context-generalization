How many stickers has Mary used? 89 -  3 * 6 - 7 * 6 = 21 1 stickers has been used.2.  He has already 65 dollars. + 10 dollars + (10 x 2) = 91  He has 1 dollar more.3.

The problem is divided into three tasks, 1/6 of pie taken by Sophia, and the rest 5/6 is put on the fridge. (We don’t know the weight of the original pie.) The weight of the original pie is 1200g.6. Tom’s brother is 20 times older than Tom’s dog. In 6 years, Tom’s brother will be 24 years old.

There are 50 dollars in Gail’s wallet. 50/5 = 10 so there are 10 $5 bills and 20 $10 bills in her wallets.<n>(Because there is a $20 bill and a $10 bill, the balance in the wallet is an even number.<n>If it was a $5 bill and $2 bill, the balance would be odd. The solution is to make it odd (we add $1 to balance the oddness.) So 50/5 is a convenient choice)

So, x should have a value between 0-10 (which is less than 11. So, we will do our math with 9.<n>If the function is invoked with 9 as the parameter, the output should be 4 (because 9-3=6 which is 3 more than 3). So, 4.<n><n>### If Function:<n><n>In the if statement functions we can create a basic function and make sure a certain condition is met if a certain parameters are passed. The if statement function will have 3 arguments.<n><n>First argument is a boolean statement that will determine if the function should run or not. The second argument is the output printed, and third argument is the name of the variable that accepts the input.<n><n>For this basic challenge, if the number you are trying to subtract is greater than 4 then the function should return 4. Otherwise, if it isnt, the function should output the number the user inputs.<n><n>### First Submitted Function:<n><n>```js<n>// Input: x // Output: x+y if x+y is greater than 4 else 4<n><n>function ifStatement(x){<n>   console.table([x,x+y])<n>}<n>```<n>If you call this function with a 5 or any number above 5 or a negative number, it will simply return -4. So input a number between 0-9. The function isn't very efficient if it is meant to check every single number between 0-11. It could also be more precise if it just checks the number which is inputted. This way, it will

Output: 2.65<n><n>Input: How much does the average person spend on groceries each week?<n><n>---<n>The input for this question is the amount that the average person spends on groceries each weeks. You must first determine the average amount that the average person has each week. This value will be represented by a floating point value, thus, you must round it off to four decimal places so that its value does not exceed 255.6. Next, you should also determine the amount that it costs per grocery item, based on how much the item costs for each food group. The values would be $1.25 for meat, $5.00 for vegetables, $4.75 for fruits, and $0.94 for milk. As you can see, the value for milk is very small, so you should not store it as a float. You can choose to store the value as an integer so that it only takes up one byte, but that would result in lost information, so you should round it off to four or five decimal places

However, there’s one other place, outside traditional arithmetic, where we can say a negative number is larger than a positive one. The answer is in the world of -ratios, which are fractions that relate two measured variables, such as lengths, temperature, weight, area, or volume, and the two fractions have one value as the top. To read negative ratios properly, you’ll need to reverse the sign of the top number, keeping the sign of the bottom number. For example, -2 1/2 denotes minus two and one-half units. To solve a ratio, you’ll need the reciprocal (to divide the ratio by). For example, to find the reciprocal of -4 1/5, you divide -4 by 5 and multiply by 1/5, which returns -.8<n>Output: A<n>

Then [edit] your question to include a [mcve] of your attempt, including the expected output based on the sample input.<n><n>Comment: Are you getting stuck on one part, or is it too much too ask for us to solve everything by ourselves?<n><n>Answer: Your input-output pairs look more like test strings than the usual inputs or answers in a programming challenge. In general, the challenge will tell you the language (e.g. C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Python).<n><n>The "real" input-output pairs in such programming challenges often only relate to one question. They either give the whole challenge as a text description where you can solve it line by line, or they give a text and all the input/output pairs in code format so you just have to write the functions and call them to arrive at the answer.<n><n>In general you can also go to websites like [this one](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and solve as many problems as you would like. You can then look at the solution explanations of other users and also the discussion forum if you have further questions about a specific problem or solution. There you will find people trying to solve any possible programming challenge.

You will need to convert n to a floating point number, then calculate the nth root of the number. Store the result in the variable root. Print out the number and the root.<n>- Programming Example: Write a Python program using for loops and if statements. You will read from a list a few phone numbers, and then output the index numbers of those that end with a 7, print the phone numbers, and print the last three characters of each.<n>- Programming Solution: Write a Python program with three prompts. In the first prompt, ask the user for any two whole number inputs and print the average of these two numbers. In the second, have them input the same two numbers and this time take away the first number from the second number. The result will have a negative sign. Have them input again the same numbers and add the result to the original number. The result is a new number with a positive sign. Finally, you want to take the second new number and subtract it from the same one from the first prompt. The result is one of the three numbers that we used. Which one corresponds to each prompt?<n>- Programming Problems:  Imagine a company where every month there is a party where employees are allowed to order food brought from restaurants.

If we input 3, then it outputs the right answer. If we input 4, then it outputs the left answer. This is working perfectly! <n><n>But when we input 5 we get the wrong result! Why?<n><n>Well, when you input a number and the array has 3 items, they will be compared the `array.length - 1`. So in our case when we input 5, the array length is 6 since the middle is not found in the array. Therefore, we start comparing at index 5 and do not find `2 2 3` in this array and the index after that (6) has less items in it (it is empty in this case). So, we return `0` since `-1` index is empty. So, we get MATCH: 0 - 0 - 0 when we input number 5. But this should be MATCH: 2 3 - 0 since the right match is found at index 2 so it should match `2 2 0`. <n><n>In short, when the array has less than `arr.length - 1` items, binary search will not work correctly. So, if we check with arrays of size 2, 3, 4 and 5, we do not get expected results and binary search won't run correctly. So, in order to fix that, we should stop binary search when there is less than `array.length - length` items.<n><n>### Part II: Binary Search<n><n>Output:<n><n>```<n>MATCH!: 9 4 3 2 1<n>```<n>

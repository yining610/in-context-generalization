At an ant colony, there is no centralized brain controlling where to go and when. That\u2019s how the queen ants decide. Every so often, some of the ants are randomly chosen to stay at their nest and lay down a pheromone trail to a food source. These pheromones travel back and forth as ants leave and return to their nest. Now, we have an ants\u2019 route and the number of ants following it and we want to determine where the next food source should be placed. As an example, let\u2019s say the ants are traveling to the food source from their nest and we place the food source right on the pheromone trail next to the nest. Next time the ants go to find food, they won\u2019t be able to tell it\u2019s not there because the pheromone route is right there. The ants just travel that route from the nest to the food source and never get there. We don\u2019t want that to happen, so we can place the food source somewhere down the pheromone path that no ants are following now. This means we\u2019ll have to place it somewhere to the left or right of the ants\u2019 path. In that case, we have 3 equally likely ways the ant can go\u2014straight to the food source, to the right of the food source, or to the left. How can we choose the left or right direction to best avoid having ants go straight to the food source?\nOutput: left\n\nInput: Earnest runs a car wash.

Her mom says she doesn't want to get a tablet. But Tasha has a good idea. \"If I put exactly $42 in the jar, then exactly $5 every week, I'll have enough money for the tablet!\" her mom says, \"But you only have $42 in that jar now.\" Tasha looks at her mom with a puzzled expression. \"Let's put our heads together to create a tablet budget,\" they decide. The next day, her mom figures she could have Tasha get paid every time she helps her out, and she could take the money from her allowance. After several days of planning, they come up with an idea. \"Let's take the dollar you spend every day on the jar and you can buy a tablet every day you save that dollar and get all your chores done!\" Tasha's mom says.

{"idx": 837, "text": "Home depot\n\n```\n\n## Solution: \n---\n\nI added a list of my solution to multiple choice questions above. It turns out that some questions have more than one solution. For example: \n\nInput: John has $150 in the bank and he spends $20 each week.  John invests 50% of his earnings, and 50% of the remaining money.  How much money is in the bank at the end of the year?\n\nInput: There is eight and a half yards of green fabric, 6 yards purple, and 4 yards of white. How many pink tote bags can be made if each bag must be at least a yard in length? \n\nSolution:  \nSolution A: John ends up with $67 in the bank at the beginning of the year, since 50% of $150 = $75, and 50/2 = $25. He invests the $75, so he earns $75 - $75 = 0 additional dollars. It will still end up at $67 by the time the year is over. \n\nSolution B: He ends up with $117.5, since there are a quarter of the yards of 1.5 (4 * 1.25), so that means that he has 4 * 1.5 = 6 yards of purple. So 4 * 4.5 = 18 yards of white added to the 8.5 purple gives him 26.5 and 18 / 3 = 6.5. Then he has an additional 50/2, or 2.5 yards of pink to make the tote bags. As a fraction, pink is 20/2, or a little over a yard of pink for each two yards of white needed. \n\nAnother example is: \n\nInputs: If there are 10 apples and 10 grapes, how many apples are there? How many grapes are there?\n\nSolution:   \nThe only way this problem could have an answer is if the inputs (10 apples and grapes; 20 apples and 20 grapes) are both even. In this case", "answer": "C: house"}

{"idx": 384, "text": "A\n\nInstruction:Answer the following question.\n\nA company has been running a lottery and has promised that the winner will receive $100,000. The company has been running this lottery every day for the past 100 days. As in any lottery, there doesn\u2019t seem to be an end in sight to the number of days before enough people buy tickets to ensure the prize is awarded. The prize will be awarded when the company has enough winning tickets for just 10 tickets that they can randomly select. They want to be sure that, in order to not leave anyone (or any company) with a bad taste in their mouth, they\u2019re fair in how many tickets they issue each day. There are 15 days left until the company will be issuing tickets and has issued a total of 1,000 tickets.\n\nAfter a long evening of thinking about it (or, a quick calculation) the company comes up with this formula for the amount to be issued each day: \\(d = 200,001 \u2212 100,010 \\div (200,020 \u00d7 d) + (1 + d/30)\\).\n\nFor instance, if they started issuing 200,100 tickets the day after, they'd need to keep issuing them until the day when they could only randomly select for 5 winning tickets and issue a total of 20,020 tickets. (If you're lost, the variables refer to those above). But then the next day could start over at 999,100 ticketholders until they reached 100, and so on. They'd only need to run this lottery until reaching 1000 days, meaning that they'd issue a total of 600,002 tickets before the very last day when they'd need to issue only 3,001 tickets. The catch with this formula though is that they can't take it easy at the beginning of the lottery and then, later, increase the amount it issues each day. In other words, the sum of \\(\\frac{t_{1} + t_{2} + \\cdots + t_{n}\\}{\\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}}\\) can'", "answer": "C: happiness"}

All questions need to be correctly worded, using commas in place of and (and will not be used), or or, using all punctuation and spelling correctly.\n* All questions are word problems.\n* Each answer is one of the following types:\n    * An integer\n    * A rational number (can be written as a fraction or mixed number)\n    * A real number\n    * A unit of measurement (inches, feet, pounds, etc.)\n* The unit of measurement does not need to be in place. For example, if a question asks for the price of a pizza, then the price that is given could be in dollars (or other currency) and could not include the unit of measurement.\n* If a question asks for a \"price of a pizza\" or says \"a dollar more\" it might mean the amount of one item OR it might be the combined total of many items\n* If there is not an answer for how much something cost, and the question is asking the money amount, you can subtract the cost of the item from the total price to figure out how much money was left over.\n* There is generally no limit to how deep a question can go, but, as always, answer the question that is asked. If a question asks for number of books versus number of pages in books, then you could consider each child to have 230 pages OR you could simply subtract pages from the total to find the number of books needed. Just answer the question, but don't get bogged down", "answer": "C: die"}

If a dog is intelligent, then we might call it an intellectual dog.  If a cat is clever, then we might use the adjective cunning; and if an elephant is wise, then we might call the elephant a wise old elephant.  However, we would never say that a dog is cute (because that would imply that dogs were small children) nor that an elephant was an elephant, since you do not refer to a person as a man (\"Mandy is wise\").  Instead, you say \"Mandy is an old elephant.\"  Let be a set of types of animals (the English-wise: dogs, cats, and elephants).  Give an English idiom so that the set is a complete type relation over this set of types.  In other words, the relation should form a complete type class which means the relation should be transitive and reflexive as well as having inverses for each ordered pair of members as follows:\n\nOutput: There is an expression in english called \"an old dog\" which means that the animal is of certain type and this type is a \"dog\".\n\nInput:  Mary's bag contained 1192 pieces of candy.

This gives us two options:\n* All of X are bigger than 34, and all of Y are smaller than 34.\n* All of X and Y are smaller than 14 (the number in between).\n\n### Part 1\n\nIf X and Y are smaller, Y=23, then subtract Y on both sides:\n\nX<34-23\n\nX is smaller than 11, this is the answer: \n\nWe need to find a way to express both options using logic.\nIf X is greater (not 0), then X+11<35 and if we have X-11<35 then X should be between 34 and -11.\n\nSubstituting in each equation and calculating:\n* X+Y<35: X-Y=0\n* X-Y<35: (X+Y)>35\n\nAdded them together:\n\nX-Y=0 -> (X+Y)>0 (A)\n\nBut we know 0<Y=23 (B)\n\nSo (X+Y)>23 (C)\n\nSubtracting Y from all variables:\n\nY>-23 but we know that Y<23 meaning X<23, so this is the answer:\n\nX-11=0 -> (X-11)*1=0 -> X=11\n\n### Part2 answer\n\nSince the answer is 11, we need to subtract one of the numbers to get the answer.\nUsing the following:\n\nX+Y<101 then\nX-Y<101\nor\nX<101 or Y<101\n\nNow we can use the knowledge we learned from part 1 and substitute to get the answer for X and Y.\n\n-11<101 means that -11 is less than the whole 101: 11", "answer": "D: popularity"}

{"idx": 727, "text": "Row boat\n\n    ## Incorrect\n\n    Answer: C\n    Explanation:\n    This one got me stuck thinking about how to do it.\n\n    To summarize:\n    You have 7 kangaroos.\n    Each kangaroo needs 2 legs.\n    So 7 times 2 is the answer 14.\n    The problem is the question asks you to \"add\" all legs together, instead of each time, because 7 is not an even number.  So instead of adding all legs together, you need an alternate solution.\n\n## Solution:\n\n### Approach 1\n\n1. Start by writing down the data given to us.\n\n2. The question asks us to add the final total we get.\n\n3. The question gives us information about the number of each animal.\n\n4. Subtract 1 number from another to get the difference and the number of times you will do it (1).\n\n5. To make the whole thing easier, take the number of legs and round it down to even.\n\n6. Start subtracting the left over number of legs from the total number of each animal to get the amount of legs for that animal alone.\n\n7. Once we have two columns, add up the total amount of legs for each column.\n\n8. The total result will be (14).\n\n### Approve:\n\nIf we didn\u2019t subtract the difference of times and just added directly, the outcome would not be accurate.\n\n## Solution - Part 2\n\nThe solution I used in the tutorial is more like one of the easier methods.  We will see how our solution can be modified for more complex questions with slightly more variables.\n\n### Step 1:\n\nOnce we have the data and question, it is time to write down anything in the questions that we know for sure.\n\n### Example:\nIn this case we know that the total amount of legs that are available is only relevant to our answer.\n\n### Our Data:\n\n### Example Input:\n\u201cI have 22 legs to spread around, how can I share it so that the total amount of leg per person is equal (22/7).\u201d\n\n\u201cI have 69 legs to spread around, I need to spread it around equally among all the people (", "answer": "E: row boat"}

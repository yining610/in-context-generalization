For example, if a company originally offered 10 shares for $50 each and later offered stock in a secondary public offering at $55 a share, how much could it raise in that offering?<n>Output: 500<n><n>## Answer:<n>Instruction: The 1th question answer is B. <n>The first line of the input is the number of cars a renter has rented for x number of days.  The second line the first number of days the renter has rented a car for less than a week.  The third line is a list of days the car has been rented for one week or longer.  The last line of the input is a car rental charge for all these days.  The cars rented for more than a week is $19 dollars cheaper than the ones rented only a week or less.  To get the cost of rentals, take the price of a week rental price, multiply it by the number days of renting car for only a week or longer and then subtract 19 dollars per car so that for 11 car days the price is $330. <n><n>Input: A 6th Question Answer is B. <n>In this problem, the car rental cost is higher than the first six days ($30/day) that was followed by a weekly discount of 70 dollars ($190 for one week rental for renters who rented cars for an entire week or longer).  In order to figure out the cost of cars rented during this time, it is necessary to sum up the prices times the number of days rented.

The carnivals, 15 miles apart, are hosting a contest called a pogo-stick jumping contest.  There are going to be two contestants, the winner being the one who can jump their pogo stick for the greatest length, without ever falling.  Each contestant has to have exactly 25 jumps, because a contestant with fewer just wouldn’t have enough jumps to win, and a contestant with more  jumps would surely be boring to watch.  In order to judge the contest fairly, each contestant is required to have exactly 5 referees with them.  Of course the carnivals have different budgets, and while this contest costs only $1,000 for the carnival in town, the other carnival’s contest needs some pretty costly pogo sticks.

The object's state can be restored to its initial default through the destruction function called the destructor function.<n><n>### Constructing an object<n>To create an object, encapsulate in an object and instantiate that object.<n>```cpp<n>class ExampleObject {<n>public:<n><n>    ExampleObject() {<n>    }<n><n>    ~ExampleObject() {<n>    this->message = "";  //Destructor<n>    }<n><n>private:<n><n>    //Variables<n>    string message;<n><n>};<n>```<n><n>You call the object's constructor during initialization. A destructor call the object's destructor function (sometimes called dtor) automatically when an object is destroyed.<n>```cpp<n>Object1 o1; // Initialize o1<n>Object1 o2;//Initialize o2<n>Object1 o3;<n>Object1 o4;<n>//Now destroy these objects one at a time<n>Object1 o1. ~Object1(); //Destroy o1<n>Object1 O2. ~Object1();//Destroy o2<n>Object1 O1. ~Object1(). //Destroy o3<n>Object1 O4. ~Object1();<n> <n>```<n><n>### Classes and Objects <n>Inside the class definition is a name of an object called a member object. The member object is known as a member object for the class definition.<n><n>Creating Object<n>```cpp<n>class Student {<n><n>    private:<n>        string studentName;<n>        int _age;<n><n>    public:<n>        float getGrade() {<n>            return grade;<n>        }<n>};<n>```<n>To get a concrete object, you have to give that object a name or instantiated the object. You then assign the values to the object's property. The object property becomes a member of the object.<n>```cpp <n>int main() {

Every 1 mile that one of the company’s taxis travels with a fare produces a cost of $0.25. So far, however, there has been little need to use this metering system as most taxi drivers use their vehicles privately. A new rule is put in place which bans all privately owned taxis in the city.

Choices:  When a grass sprout grows to a certain height, its root network gets so strong that it pulls the entire grass plant up out of the ground and lets it float on the wind.  There is a special group of seeds that live on the tops of grass blades. These grasses are able to be carried across the countryside by the wind until they land somewhere new.  The grass is so light that the wind can blow it anywhere, and soon it grows a root system that pulls it out the ground.  (A) Grasses are very light and the wind can easily blow them from place to place.  There is a seed that lives on the top of the grass and floats from place to place. The seed has a special property that allows it to float in the air. After a while, the grass develops strong roots and is able to grow anywhere it lands. The plant has a seed at the tip of the stem that grows to a certain length, stretches out and lets the plant float around. It makes it easier for the grass to move around.  It grows a seed on its top that floats around in the wind.  (B) Grass gets new places in a few different ways. Some seeds develop roots that wrap around the grass blades, pulling the plant up out of the earth. After a while, these grasses get strong enough to grow anywhere they happen to land. The plant puts a seed on the top of the stem. The seed grows to a certain height and then lets the grass plant stand up and float on the wind. (C) Grass gets from place to place the same way that any other plant does. Its seedlings have deep roots that allow the plant to pull itself out of the ground and start growing somewhere else. (D) Grass gets where it is going by sprouting tall, thin stalks.

A)7:25 A)7:30  B)7:40  C)7:45  D)8:00<n>Output： C<n><n><n>### Solution:<n>- The car-rental-agency costs $30 a day, which is charged a minimum of 2 days. If a rent goes over a week, they charge an extra $60 (weekly total = 2x30 + 60 = 190). And since Jennie rented the car for 11days, that means she paid $190.<n><n>- To calculate the overall time, it's the time going and time coming back. Since it's 20 head of animals, it's (60mi*60mi)/(8mi/h*60mi/h) = 1.5 hrs.<n><n>- Jason spends 14 days per month renting $50, and so spends $4,400 per year.<n><n>- Since it's noon, the train is moving away, and there's 1/3 hour left, it'll be three hours.<n><n>- 7:45<n><n>

How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.

Choices:  A: telephone network B: freeway C: company D: wall E: airport<n>Output:		B<n>```<n><n>## Explanation:<n>1. How much? The initial rent is $30 and the price doubles every day of the rental. We know the first rule of compounding, a base plus interest is the interest. This works pretty well since Jennie’s final bill is close to $350, $310 to be exact.<n><n>2. How fast? It is 1 day plus a remainder. The hurricane is in exactly 1 day, the remainder is how much time it takes. The remainder is 6 days and we know that 6 is a multiple of 2 therefore the remainder will also be a multiple of 2. This means that we will have an additional 400/60 miles of driving in case of the hurricane.<n><n>3. How much? Add each option and make sure the sum is equal to the desired number. So, we want to add 50 plus 50 plus 4 plus 3 plus 0. This yields 140.<n><n>4. How much? How many months are not 20 in a year and are there 12? There are 26. That number is our remainder, now we must multiply by 2. Therefore the time we spend in our car is equal to 52.<n><n>

Make sure to use the correct format and to explain your answer to the programming prompt.<n><n>Instruction: A pump operator wants to create an automated system that monitors a tank’s supply level and activates the pump when the level starts to fall. If the level falls below a cutoff height, the level should be automatically raised before the motor is activated. When the tank level reaches its set height, the operator should also receive a phone call.<n>What is the correct statement to write such a system?<n><n>- First create a variable ‘ths’ and assign that to the tank height. Also, let ‘tsh’ be an empty variable (default).<n>- Throw an if-else statement that checks current tank height against cutoff height ‘tsh’. If the value for ‘tsh’ is greater, then throw an else-if condition that creates a message saying that the tank is high and not to worry. If the tank height ‘tsh’ is lower than the cutoff height, then let ‘m’ be an empty message (default).<n>- If tank height is less than the cutoff height ‘tsk’, then let ‘tst’ be an empty tank supply (default). Create a for-while-loop variable ‘tmt’.<n>- With a ‘while’ statement that compares the for-loop variable ‘tst’ with ‘tmt’. If the for-loop variable is lower than the ‘tmt’ variable, then change the tank height and start the ‘while’ statement again.<n>- On the first ‘while’ call, throw an ‘if’ statement and set the ‘m’ variable to a message that says tank has not been activated.<n>- On the second ‘while’ call, set the ‘m’ to the message that the tank has been active and let the ‘m’ empty<n>- When the tank supply runs out, a message will be thrown, either with a message that the tank stopped moving, or that it ran out of supply and that a new tank supply refill has been called.<n><n><n>###Instruction:Answer the question as described above.

Preprocessor (#)<n><n>2. header files<n><n>3. includes<n><n>4. namespace<n><n> 5. the main() function<n><n># Part 1 - Pre-processor Directives in C<n>  "What is a pre-processor directive?"<n><n> preprocessor is part of C programming language that you use to include code or data in your program in a way that will make it easier to compile and work on your code. preprocessor directives are used in C++ to include code or data into the source file(s) in a way that will be easier to compile for the developer.<n><n><n># Part 2 - Header Files in C<n>  "what is a header file?"<n><n> Header files are commonly written in the format.h to be able to access the contents of the file in C programs. Header files contain the necessary functions and procedures that a programmer needs to write C programs. When the header files are included in C programs, the procedures and functions are available for use in C source files.<n><n># Part 3 - Include Directives in C<n>include commands are used to tell your C program which header file it should use during the compile time. This is typically used when a file requires multiple header files, such as C++ classes or macros. For example, #include <iostream> is used when writing a class or struct. Without including these header files the program will generate errors.<n><n># Part4 - Namespaces in C<n> "What is a namespace?"<n><n>In C++, the namespace keyword tells us that a certain variable, function or class belongs to a certain namespace, and you can use it in your code. It is similar to writing “using namespace std”, which allows you to use std library functions without typing their entire name every time you use them.<n><n># Part5 - The C++Main() Function<n> "What is the C++ main() function?"<n><n> The main() function is where your program begins and ends.<n><n># Reference:https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_hello_world.asp

What is this situation illustrating? Choices: A. income inequality B. an unforeseen problem C. a public utility D. a good investment E: opportunity cost<n>Output: C<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question on the card<n><n>#### Question 1: The answer on the card reads: “An opportunity cost, also called an economic gain or an economic penalty, is the value of whatever has to be given up in order to obtain something else. In the example above, eating in restaurants involved economic loss when restaurants were not present. To illustrate a public utility, we turn to water; the need to drink water can be treated as a utility.”<n><n>#### Question 2: The answer on the back of the card reads: “In a large city such as New Orleans, the water utility has to ensure that a large number of people have enough water every day to maintain health and sanitation. In order to do so, the city has to build an extensive water system that is distributed throughout the city. The system must be able to supply a constant flow of water no matter how many large bodies of water are being used at any given time in the city. In other words, it must be able to respond and adjust to the constant demand that city residents put on it while maintaining an adequate supply. Because water is a utility, the city must ensure that it meets the constant demands of its citizens on a daily basis, no matter how many people are using the utility.”<n>

Choices:  A: street B: soccer field C: soccer game D: central park E: pool table<n>Output:		A: A ball can be played in the street.<n><n>#### Explanation:<n>---<n>In the first problem, you will have the variable $f$ representing the daily rate for car rentals, $d$ representing the number of days renting the car and $s$ representing a value representing the entire week if the car rental exceeds 6 days.<n><n>The question asks for $f*d + 14*s$. You do the first part of this equation, $f*d = 310$. You are then left with $14*s$ which is equal to $310$. This indicates the answer is $310$.<n><n>#### Instruction:Answer the next multiple choice question<n><n>Input: You go to a store and purchase an item for $4.99. You put this item in your shopping cart and put it in the back of the line. You are then charged sales tax at a rate of $2.20/100 which is.022 of a dollar. How much, to the nearest cent, do you owe in total for this purchase? There are no other applicable charges or discounts.<n>Output: 281<n><n>#### Explanution:<n>---<n>In this problem, you first determine two variables.  $a$ represents the cost without tax and $b$ represents the amount you must pay to the nearest dollar after tax. The question asks for $a+b=281$. This indicates you are left with a value for $a$. You then subtract the tax, $a-b=279.00$. This value is to the nearest cent, so you round it by adding a.01 to it, $279.01$. <n>

Identicate the information which is NOT a fact based on logic. (Note: No punctuation, or other symbols are used in the article)<n><n>Passage: *Elections in the United States typically take place on the first Tuesday in November each year. Each of the fifty (50) states elect a president. In addition, voters nationwide elect the President and the Vice President. The states choose a Senator for each of their states. All of the voting rights are included in the voting process. The Congress, with the exception of the presidency, is elected by the state. The candidate with the most popular votes wins the presidency. The person who gets the second highest rate. However, if no candidate wins over 50 percent of popular votes, the two top contenders then battle in an election of the votes. The popular vote gives one hundred votes (110) to the winning president. If no candidate gets over 150 votes, the presidential election is decided by the federal government in Washington, D.C. The vote that is counted for the first round of the election is the popular votes count. The popular vote for president in 1958 was 21,000 votes. However, the electoral vote for president in 2000 was 599,610 votes. The number of votes counted with the President’s name does not count the popular vote. The 50 states and the District of Columbia also have their own elections. The elected officials in each state are the governors, state legislators, and judges of the state courts. The voters choose one member of Congress (which is the number of people in the Senate). The people who govern in the District of Columbia make decisions for the state. This election process determines the electoral vote for that state.

Alice wants to stay at the shore on her side because she is afraid of water.  It is not possible to transport people in the boat directly to the other side.  Bob wants to stand at the front of the boat so that he can help to steer.  No one in the boat can see any objects in the river.  There is an infinite number of possible routes between Alice and Bob.  However, two specific routes exist which contain no islands and have at most three turns.  Bob can steer the boat in only one direction without using the brakes.  The two routes can be calculated in linear time, and all boats can be transported in two hours.  They want to decide between two solutions, A and B.  Solution A requires Alice and Bob to stand on opposite sides of the river, but they do not want to be too far apart.  Alice and Bob want to know if it is possible to bring all the passengers on either one trip.  Solutions A and B are given in the input. A: First Alice goes on a boat with length b and second she goes on a boat with the same length b, but with b*2 direction.  Bob goes on other boat with same length as first.  It takes 1 hour to cover 200, so it took 60*2*(1+1)=<<60*(1+1)=61>>61 minutes.  So the final answer is NO.

How many numbers are odd?<n>Output: We can only guarantee four are odd. However we can only see eight numbers and six are even. We can rule out 1 and 2 then we can take 3 out the list because we see its even and it is the only even number in the eight numbered list. So we can safely rule out 3,4,5,6 so we know the next one in the list will have to be odd as the number 7,8,9,10, and 11 will guarantee that all of them are odd. The last number is 12 and it too is odd.<n><n>Input: Two-thirds of the gas stations in the U.S. have a Shell gas station, which means that 2/3 * 1/11 * 2/3 * <<<<<1/3*2/3>>>>>>=5.6% of the gas stations in America are Shell Stations. If 11% is one-third of the people in America, how many gas stations are in America?<n>Output: The gas stations in the U S have a shell station. We know that 2/3*1/11*2/3*<<<<<2/3*11/3>>>>>>> equals 5.6% of gas stations are shells. We know 5.6 is a fraction and 1/3*2.368=6. So it is a whole number and then you can add 6 to the decimal and you get 5.6. So 5.6/2.368 is 2.355 is 72% and 72% of 11 is about 8. 8*2.36 is about or equals 19. So that means 8% of 19 is about 1.5. We subtract 1.5 from 11. And we get an approximately 5.5. So 11/5.5 is almost 2.<n>

He has already covered 24 miles in 15 minutes.<n>So in another 40:45/120 minutes, he would reach Florida(which is after 40 minutes).<n>Since the question said that the person drove the whole way to Florida, we assume he covered the whole range of 105*105 miles, i.e. 11025 miles. Dividing that by 60, we get 183.75. So he has 183.5 minutes left, or 3:08:35.<n>Florida is at a coordinate (30.000, -81.500). It is in the Southeast. <n>When the person is at the coordinate (30.788, -81.722), it is 3:19.<n>When the person is in Florida, it is 3:36:45.<n>From these, we can find the co-ordinates of Virginia.<n>These also let us compute that he has traveled 829 miles at 105 mph. <n>Dividing 183.4 minutes by 105 miles/minute, we get 1.75.<n>Floridas southern border is marked by the latitude of 26.000.<n>The coordinate of Virginia is thus on the Northern side of this coordinate.<n>So the answer is B.<n><n>Input:Jamal is driving down the highway toward the north in a pickup truck and decides to take a nap

When a ball bounces off of your side of the court, you get 3, 5, or 7 points, depending on where the ball bounces off the court.  When the ball lands on your side, you get 1 point.  How many points do you earn on each serve?<n>Output: When the ball lands on any of the first six rows, you get 10 points.  That means it lands in the first 6/12 = <<6/12=0.5>>0.5 of the court.  The next six rows are numbered 7 - 12.  The remaining 5/12 = <<5/12=0>4">  rows have numbers 13, 14, and 15.<n>You always "skip" the row where the ball lands.  The number of points equals the number of skipped rows, so the number of points that you get is the number of rows you skip plus 1.  If you get the ball in the first 6 rows, you get one point more.<n>How many points do you get on each serve?<n><n>Input: There is a store near me that sells a bagel every morning for $12 each.<n><n>Output: For the store, $16/3 is $<<16/3=5>>5.<n><n>To calculate each individual baker’s profit, we can take the average profit per bagel:  $12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6.<n><n>So, to calculate the average profit per bag of bagels in this scenario, we can simply divide $16 by $6 = <<16/6=2>>2.<n><n>Therefore, each baker gets, on average, $2 profit for selling 3 bagels.<n><n>So the average number of bagels purchased per day is 1/(2*5) = <<1/(2*5)=0.2>>0.2, or about two bagels per day.<n><n>## Submit<n><n>Click the blue button to the right

At the end of the day, he returns for the evening feed and puts his dog into its pen. He then reads for about an hour before the chickens begin to cluck, prompting him to go to the feed room and fill a pan with feed for the chickens. The dog soon goes crazy from boredom and starts digging in the chicken yard, making enough noise to prompt the man to go out and tell the dog to stop before going back to his room to read. After reading for a good while, he begins to feel a bit hungry. He decides that for some reason, perhaps because it's the middle of the night, that he doesn't want the chicken feed for himself so he goes out and tosses the feed to the chickens instead of putting it into his pan. The dog, who has heard the chickens clucking, runs out of the house and goes into the yard where there is plenty of food, but he returns to the house empty-handed. For a moment the man is happy to know that the dog won't be bothering him anymore, and even though he would prefer to get something to eat, he goes to his laptop and begins to check his work e-mail. For each e-mail he deletes, he gets one he needs to answer, so he writes his reply and sends the e-mail. The dog still has not come back to the house, but the man begins to worry because it's close to the middle of the night. He grabs a jacket and goes to check on the dog. The dog is nowhere to be found, but the man decides not to be disappointed because he has readied his pan so he goes back inside and begins to eat while reading for a little while longer. After about an hour, he begins to think that he should look for the dog but he falls asleep in the process and forgets about it. He sleeps for three hours and wakes up because the chickens are clucking loudly from the feed room. He heads into the feed room and realizes that for some reason, he doesn't want to eat the chicken feed so he tosses it to the chickens

It costs $2 for the jug of water bottles while a jug has 500 mL  and a tennis ball has 0.3 g. The fan has no cash left over and wants to be able to share her water with at least two other people. How much money does she have per person then?<n>Output: She has 40 cents per jug or person since a ball is 25 * $$2/(500*10) = <<500*2/(25*10)>>25/10 or about 25 cents per person<n>She then buys 10 jugs or 10 * $$2/(5*10) = 50 cents<n>So she has 100 cents per jug after buying water bottles<n>So she has 50 cents * 25 = 1250 cents total<n>She then buys a pack of peanut since 1 pack = <<1 pack=50>>50 cents each<n>Then she has 10 packs at the end<n>So she has 300 cents + 40 * <<100/4>>40 cents = 560 cents total<n>So

How much should the city allocate to the arts? Enter your answer in dollars and cents using two decimal places. Example: 50.00 -> $50.00<n>Output: Let x represent the city's budget.<n>We need to find 5% of the budget, so 5% = x *  0.05.<n><n>Note that we need to solve for x. x = 2 * (5% / 0.05), and since we have (0.05 / 0.02), we must multiply both sides by 2. So (2 * 5% /  0.05) = x, and since all integers are less than one, integer division works: x = 5 * 5 % /  0.01 =  0.25 = 25%.<n>So (50 + x) * 0.05 = 25, let x represent the city' income budget of 50 dollars.<n>So the right answer should be 25 dollars<n><n>Output: The right answer is 32<n>

At home, movies cost $4 per movie unless you buy the movie collection where for the price of buying the collection you get unlimited movies all year for just $2 per movie (at home). In the movie theater, you pay $3 per ticket, but no further fees or restrictions; the same ticket will work for any movie at any time.  If a new movie that you like is playing in the theater, but you can't go because you are home watching movies or because you have another plan for that day, you'll pay an additional $5 to see the same movie at a different time.  I'm trying to maximize the number of tickets I go to the theater per year while having a positive average cost per ticket. How many movies a year go to the theater under these constraints?<n>Output: For every movie you watch at home it cost $2. So total cost home is $7.5<n>For every movie you watch in the theater it cost $3 + $5 = $8 <n>So for every movie you watch you buy a ticket for $8 and then pay $5<n>So theater cost for every movie you watch is $8 + $5 = $13<n>So it is better to go to the theater for every movie you watch because it cost $7.5 in home + $13 in theater = $20.5<n>So the final answer for you is a theater per year<n><n>Input: In a movie, the director decides whether to use a single light source and two different camera angles for night scenes by choosing from a single switch or a three-way switch.

If there is a tie, then extra matches must be played until there is no more remaining.  <n>	If we have 2 players play once, then they both have a 50% chance of winning, just because they had 1 chance to win, out of 2 in total. If we have a match where the winner is playing 3 times and the loser playing once, they both have a 33.33% chance of winning, since they each have one chance to win.<n>	The formula gives (x-1)+1, where x is the number of times a player has played. This means if we have 2 people and one plays 10 times and one plays 1, then they have a combined chance of 10+1=11 to win. So it is (10-1)+1=11+1=12.<n>	This is because of how the formula works.<n>Input:<n>	When they played 11 games of basketball. They won once and lost 10 times.<n>	What is their winning percentage?	<n>Output: They were in a 3 way tie for the third place, but only first and sixth place qualified for the finals.<n>	The formula would be: (1/11 times 1/10) = 0.091%

Choices:  A: apartment B: pantry C: table D: living room E: shelf<n>Output:		"Table".<n>Input: There are people living in a town. Among these people are John and James. There are 25 children in the same town.  There are 40 people living on the same street as John and James.  There are 25 people living in John\'s house.  There are 50 people on the same bus with John and James. There is exactly 50% of the people in the town, bus drivers, and James\'s neighbors who smoke cigarettes.  What percentage of the people on James\'s street smoke cigarettes?<n>Output: One possible solution is:<n>The number of adults is 104 + 40 = <<104+40=144>>144<n><n>The number of men (i.e. adults) is 104 = <<104=100>>100 (not including John or James). We will call it "a" if it will be convenient.<n>The number of women (i.e. people who are not men) is 40 + 26 = <<40+26=66>>66<n><n>The number of smokers is 144 - 66 = <<144-66=78>>78<n>The number who don't smoke is 40 + a = <<40+a=60>>61<n>We will call them "b" and "c" if it will be useful.<n>So the smoker percentage is c/b=<<c/b=61/60=100/120=8/10>>8/10<n>So the smoker percentages are: 100% of 40 people, 25% of 56 people, 8/10 of 74 people<n>So people who smoke make 80% of the people on John's street smoke.<n>So the percentage of men who do not smoke is b/a=<<b/a=60/56=15/12>>15/12<n>So the percentage is 0%. So men and women smoke equally on John's street. That happens only if James never smoked, nor gave up smoking.<n><n>Input: A bag of 20 pounds

That means the best protection is a tank.<n><n>Input: A dog chases a squirrel off a ship. This action triggers a trapdoor on the deck to open, dumping the dog into the sea. The trapdoor's hinge was recently lubricated with a wax that makes it slide frictionlessly. A force of 398 Newtons on the trapdoor (which is much larger than that required to open the trapdoor without friction) is enough to trigger it. How far (in meters) above the waterline is this trapdoor's hingepoint from the deck surface?<n>Output: The trapdoor's maximum angular displacement (from its maximum height before opening) is (180/pi) * (hypotenuse of triangle below), which is about (139/pi). * (hypotenue of triangle below).  Let the trapdoor be the hypotenuse of the triangle below, and assume the ship's surface is flat.  Then:<n><n>hypotenue = ((398^2)/(distance^2 + (180/piby2)))<n><n>d = ((398/((hypotenue^2 + (160/pi))^2)))) - 180/pi<n><n>That means the maximum height difference between the trapdoor and the deck surface is:<n><n>d = 99.5 * ((398/(251^2))) * (sqrt(d)))<n><n>So d = 99.7 * ((398/0.9764))<n><n>So d = (99.7 * 400)/0.976<n><n>So d = ((20 * 0.976)/0.97)<n><n>So d =(20/0.97)*((400/10))<n><n>So d=440/0.9*[(400/1)].5<n><n>So d=220/0.45<n><n>So d =550/2.1<n><n>So the height difference is 26.93852 meters<n><n>

The gym needed $43 of repairs, which cost $3 more each than it cost to put out new nets and mats.  They also had to replace 4 uniforms whose prices increased by $5.  The team needed to replace a 6th uniform and it cost $200 more to refill a new coach’s supply of basketballs than it cost at the beginning of the season.  How much money was left after all the purchases were made?<n>Output: The gym repair cost 43/60 * 800 $<<43/60*800=>70>>70 dollars.<n>The players uniforms cost 5 + 5 * 10 * 2 $<<5+5*10*2=>30>>30 dollars.<n>So players uniforms cost total cost 362/60*70 $<<362/6*32=>$$32>>32 dollars.<n>The team needed to replace 1 uniform, 7. So team uniforms cost total cost $30+32=<<32+32=64>>64 dollars.<n>The basketball coach wanted 40 basketballs. So replacement cost total cost 64+64=<<64+64==$128>>128 dollars.<n>So the remaining money after the purchases was made was the total cost from the above steps - 2400 - $128=$<<1972>>1972 dollars.<n>So the final money was 1972 dollars<n>

Choices:  A: down a river B: city C: repair shop D: parking lot E: neighbor's house<n>Output:		I will be honest, I didn't completely understand what this was asking. I ended up guessing E.<n><n>Input: 1) A person drives their car 80,000 miles in 4 years 2) They drive their car for 5 hours every day of their lives 4) A plane can travel at $30,000*10,000 = <<30,00*100=3>>3 times the speed of a car<n><n>My guess for this questions: I just guessed $240, then double checked by doing some rough calculations on how many gallons of fuel I would need to go to those places since you'd be traveling for a really long time. For the first question, I made it 1024 hours so I assumed 50 gallons. This was wrong because apparently they should multiply the distance by 50 because it is an 80000 mile stretch. So I divided my gallons by 50, I ended up with $5000 which is too much so I tried again and realized that I didn't need to. They would need to travel for a really long time ($10$ hours would be fine I guess) to travel that far from Earth and I would need a lot more fuel. If it was true they would need that much fuel in a 4 year time period, they would also need to travel at 4 times the speed of light to travel that many miles from Earth back to Earth. So that's my guess for the 4th question.<n>Output: $240.<n><n>Input: A woman goes jogging for 15 minutes and then goes to the gym for 30 minutes.

I did this for 15 minutes to 30 minutes, as well as for 20 minutes to 40 minutes. For the 20 to 40 minute run combinations, I used these numbers because I didn't want to go to 45 or 50 minutes because the next time you multiply with 3

There are different strategies for a coach to use, so we are only considering three types of plays. What is the probability a coach would select the right play on the first down?<n>Output: In the case of only three play choices, it would make no sense to count "if the coach gets it right, the probability is 67%." It would be just as sensible to count "if the pro coach gets it wrong, she gets two out of three tries, giving a probability of 66%." In any case, there are many ways to express the probability, however I will show how to calculate this answer by the third option given in the instructions.<n>To get the answer: Given there are only three play choices, the number of outcomes is 3, and the number of successful outcomes is not 1, but rather 2 out of 3 chances, so there is a 2/3 or 66% chance she would correctly pick the needed play.<n><n>Input: A plane can carry a weight of no greater than 35,000 pounds.

If there are two players, the batting order could be either (BB) or (BA).  If there are three players, there aren't any two player combinations, so the answer is 2.  For four players, we can just use (AAAB).  Finally, for five players, none of the four-person combinations include the fifth, so there are no possible combinations for them.  So the number of sequences for two players is 2, three players is 2, four players is (AAAB), and the number of sequences for five players is <n><<6>>6.  So the number combinations of batting orders is<n><<5*2*2*2*6=

Here is an example:<n>>>> choices = [['Choices: {}'.format(choice)] for choice in range(len(sys.argv[1]))]<n>>>> choice, input = raw_input('Enter choice: ').split()<n>>>> choice = choice.lower()<n>>>> choice<n>>>> choice in choices <n>>>> for choice in choices:<n>            if choice == choice.lower():<n>                input = input.lower()<n>                print 'You chose {}'.format(choice)<n>                break<n>The above block of code is exactly what an interpreter would be executing in a shell script. The range() is part of Python version 2.x.  So just using a raw_input() inside a while-loop is enough to create a command prompt and a user friendly interface to get a user input in this example. The while-loop is the most important part in this code snippet since this is where the conditions are checked with the input from the user. If the condition is matched, the code moves on to the next statement. You can read more about Python version 3.x differences here <n>link.<n>As mentioned in the example code,  you can use Python range() function, but it takes one more line in code which needs a loop. In my example, that line was "for x in range(len(input))" where the "input" was my raw_input function, and since I did not want my user to input each 1-6 on each loop I used raw_input function which takes input only once. So this is how you can do it. <n>In your example case, the user is asked to input something which is in a set to be true. So we can use the "in" condition along with the "if" conditional statement to check for the input and then print out the desired statement. In the above case I was taking "choice" as the input and then checking "choice in choices" in the "if" to check whether this "choice" is in the "choices" list.<n><n><n>Input: <n>How many ounces of liquid does person A drink in a day?

A grasshopper will have four legs in the morning and evenings, two legs in the middle of the day, and will start with a normal count of six (four in the morning and two in the evening), but will lose two legs during the day and will continue with four legs in the evening. Thus, a grasshopper has six legs in a day and four legs in the night. Similarly, flies have four or six legs in the morning and night, and three legs in daylight. And a cockroach has a daytime count of six legs, and a nighttime count of four legs.<n><n>

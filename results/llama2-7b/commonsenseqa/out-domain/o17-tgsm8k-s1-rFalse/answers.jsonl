If the condition fails, it will not enter the ```while``` statement to repeat\n- The first step while using ```for ```statement is to define which of the available loop iterations we are using.\n  - for loop will always execute the loop body unless you terminate the loop explicitly\n- The for loop always executes the next statement in the loop body\n- In every loop statement, there is a counter variable which holds the number of loop iterations. \n  - Usually, we initialize the counter variable in the first line of the for loop body by adding a statement within the parenthesis (), right after ```for```\n\n### Example\n\t1.

All except one teacher was on time when the bell rang and the 3rd grade class filed into their classroom. The teacher entered the class and asked her students to get their workbooks and begin to write their compositions about the weekend. After a few minutes, the teacher began to notice that one student was writing on his paper but not with a pencil. When she looked closely to determine why he was writing something different from his classmates, she then noticed the student had a bottle cap tied around his wrist that said 30. It took her a while to determine to what this 30 referred and she was not sure of an answer until several more minutes went by and the student walked to the teachers desk in front of the entire class, placed the bottle cap on the desk and revealed his message: \"This is my 30th day in school\".\n\n\n### Question: \n\nWhich of the following statements does the sentence in the paragraph best support?\n\nA: All of the grades are similar.\nB: The teacher's actions have an effect on the students.\nC: Students who come to school on a daily basis have lower numbers.\nD: The teacher does something special for every student who attends.\n\n### Answer:\n\n(D) The students who come to school on any given day are affected significantly by the actions of their teachers.

{"text": "B\n\n## 3. What is the meaning of the math signs you used in the question?\nIn this question the answer is 35.  As you have seen above, the question was worded as follows: \" If he has 289 kangaroos and 4 times as much goats as kangaroo, what is the total number? \" In this equation, let's assume that there are K goats and K+4 goats.  Then we can see that: (K+4)/4 x 289 = K x 35 The equation then reduces to:  (K+4)/K/4 x 35 = K x 875  Now, we can see that you should take away from the 875 the 875 and write it as 25. So, we get that: (K+3)/K/4 x25 = K x 44 Which reduces to:  ((K+3)/4 + ((K+3)/K)/3)/4 x 25 = K x (44) Since you subtract the (((K+3)/(4)+(K+3)/(K)/3)/4) from the (((K+4)/4), we get that: (((K+4)*(4)-K+(3)*(4)) / (3)) x25 = K  Since we have  (((K+3*/4+(K+3/K/3)/4) / (3)).  We can see we can reduce it as: ((K+3* 4)-K +(3)*4)/3 = 15643  and then it reduces to: 35K =15643. 35 multiplied by K equals to 15640. 15,640 is a multiple of 10.

{"text": "A\n\n### Explanations of the solution:\nTo answer the first multiple choice question, we use a logical and deductive method. We take the total amount of stickers that she has left, 44, and then we deduce that if it was all in big stickers or if it was all in small ones, it won't add up to the whole number. Hence, the only possibility it would add up to the whole amount of stickers is that they were all in small stickers, because there are no big stickers left.\n\nTo answer the second multiple choice we use multiplication and division. We start by finding out how much of Mark's own money it is he needs to earn in order to buy the bike, and the answer is to find how much money is left after the earnings from babysitting, so 6-5=1, to buy the bike because after that he will have made the 60 so he can earn 30 for mowing the lawn and 20 for the allowance, and then he earns nothing from the rest and he will be very rich to buy a bike.\n\nTo answer third multiple choice, we use multiplication. We multiply kangaroo's by goats so we will get the number of leg and the answer is 322.\n\nTo answer forth we use multiplication and division and in the end we use addition. First we start by dividing the amount of pencil and the amount of the hat, we have the ratio and the answer is 8/10. Then, we multiply with the amount left and we add the answer to the original number to get the answer. The answer is 88.\n\nTo answer fifth we use division. We need to find the difference between maximum and minimum needed, so the answer is 119.\n\nTo answer sixth we we use subtraction, addition and division. First subtraction, we substract the old record, we will get 6438. Then we add two and get 6440. Then do the subtraction again, we will get 0.25.\n\nTo answer seventh we we use addition and subtraction. 320 is 10 more than 67. 67 is 4 times 17. There are 12 hours", "answer": "E: new"}

{"text": "A\n\nInput:Choose a country to start from and use that as you follow the directions below to draw a route that, when repeated 4 times, will form a loop. (Do not draw in the box; simply name the country you choose.)\nOutput: USA,USA,USA,USA,CANADA\n\n##### Expected Input:\nA person who is not a robot. (Just kidding.)\n\n##### Explanation:\nIn the very first line, we need to store all input into variables.  If we look at the first \"Input:\" line, we can parse it and assign every word as a variable to its own variable within a loop, like so (The variable names are all made up):\n\nInput: Mary = 89\n\nWith each line being 7 variables, we then need to convert the letters to numbers. (This is probably the simplest part you can do without an AI or an interpreter.)\nIn a way, the first word of every line is the variable number, and each line after that is the variable value (for example, if the next line is 3 large sticker, that means the variable that has 3 is being used by 'large', like below (this is not how to do it; I'm just saying how it generally works):\n\n```\nvar1 is = 89                                                                   ---------------\nvar4 = 3                                                                       \n\nvar2 = large                                                     --------------\nvar3 = stickers                                                       --------------\nvar6 = 6                                                                        -------------\n```\n\nAfter the parser runs, we need to find ways for the calculators. In this case, we have 4 calculators. As we do every line, we are given two numbers so we can find the number between for what we're given, like so:\n\nA good way to do this in Python (which is why I made this code) is to use \"if statements\" and the \"is\" keyword. The \"is\" keyword means if (number) is (something). For example: 4 is even.\n\nSo, our first 3 lines should be:\n\n```\nif large is stickers:\nif sticker is stickers:\n\nif large is large:\nif sticker = stickers:\n\n```", "answer": "A: guilty conscience"}

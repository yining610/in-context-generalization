{"text": "Choice:  C: happy\nChoices:  A: A husband is not likely to feel grief because he is asked to stop being married to his wife.  Grief is about being sad, angry, or disappointed, which would not be the appropriate emotional response to being asked to stop being married.  The only emotion that would be appropriate is happiness, which a husband is likely to feel after being asked to stop being a married man.\nChoice:  B: Pleasure is not the correct emotional response because it is a sensation that generally is temporary and associated with excitement.  A husband is likely to feel ecstatic, but ecstasy is not an emotion but a mixture of emotions like happiness or amusement.  Also, ecstasy is a rare emotion and only happens under specific conditions where there is either significant physical pleasure that is combined with a strong emotion.   Pleasure on the other hand is a neutral emotion that is just associated with the physical sensation of pleasure in any context, not just in the context of marriage.\nChoice:  D: A husband is not going to feel grief about being asked to stop being joined in marriage.  Grief is associated with disappointment, but even if the marriage was difficult and the wife has an obvious reason for the husband wanting to be able to end the marriage the husband is still likely to feel happy about it, not sad or disappointed.\nChoice:  E: A husband is likely to be happy when asked to stop being married but not necessarily isolated.  Isolation is when a person is separated from the environment they are used to.  A husband is not likely isolated even if he is unhappy; he is always with in his environment.

The total you can score with the first three darts (a double, a triple, and a single) will always be 19, and darts can only ever be thrown once so...\n\nWe\u2019ll assume that your first three darts were a triple.\n\nLet\u2019s play along with you and imagine that your fourth dart missed the board completely \u2014 but you\u2019ll be happy either way!\n\nIf you are missing a single 20, you can hit it on your next dart:\nYou scored a total of 90 with your three throw\n\nIf you have a single 20 and you get two, you get to the total of 90 just like a 3x triple, except you did it in fewer throws:\nYou're still missing one, but you scored a total of 81 with just two throw\n\nSo, if you have a triple and a single, you\u2019re all set.\n\nIf not, you can either continue with a triple, a triple, and single or two triples and a single (depending on how many throws you have left) to hit your target.\n\n### Exponential Growth/Decay T", "answer": "A: train station"}

The only difference between the number of choices in question one and the number of choices in the others is that question one does not have a 'correct' answer.  I did not initially realize this.  When I tried to guess the 'correct' answer for question 1, it gave me one of the choices I selected, but then gave me the correct answer to the next question and the next one after that, and so on.  It only made sense that there was only one correct answer at the end, not for each question, when I realized that question one gave me only one choice.\n\n2. What I did for the rest of these questions, which is the way they are designed to be answered, was to work the question as follows:\n\nFor example: for question 2, I knew that the first 7 days were 190, but that after each car rental, the total cost would be 190+cost of the next day and so on.  So the total after each car rental would be 19+290+490+790+1190+1490+1690+1990=9240.  That way, you can figure out the total cost for the 11 days.  For question 3, I figured out the miles traveled for each day, and then added up all of the trips, since the total number of trips would be 2 or 4, depending on how often they started and ended 2 miles from the location.  They could start 2 miles from the ranch 60 times at 60 mile/hr, and then start 4 miles from the ranch every 2 miles at 60", "answer": "D: pool hall"}

The problem is that there are only two candlesticks and you\u2019d really like to burn all three candles at the same time.  If each candle is 3 inches tall, can you solve this using only a ruler, a pen and a pencil?\nOutput: Use a ruler to measure 15 inches.  Make two 3 inch marks. Light the first candle. Record how tall the entire thing is. Light the second candle and record how tall the entire thing again. Light the third candle and record (or draw pictures) how tall the entire thing now is. Measure from the top of the ruler to the bottom of the top marks, mark with a pen. Move the ruler down and mark your second measure. Move the ruler to the top of the candles and the bottom of the ruler should be exactly 15 inches below the top of the first candle. Make a third mark for the top of the rulers placement. You can now light each candle.  After it burns down, compare mark to mark to see the relative height of each.\nSolution: Burn a candle (12). Mark the third candle\u2019s location with a pen and the first two with pencils.  Burn the first candle to the third from the top (9).  Burn the second to the third (11).

When the boys are walking the same speed, how far behind each will the boys be a quarter of an hour into their walk?\nOutput: We know that they start off.\nTherefore, we will want to find out how far they will be when they have walked for a quarter of an hour and walk is 5.5 ft per second.\nWe can find this by using the formula:\ndistance covered (in seconds):\nd = 5.5 * t\nwhere, d is distance (ft), and t is time (second).\n\nTherefore, if the distance traveled in a second is 5.5 feet, then the distance traveled over (time) is 5.5/5.5 x t.\n\nThe answers is d=94.1 ft.\n\nOutput: There are two ways that we can express \u201c100 \u2013 90\u201d in a mathematical context.\nWe would say that 90 is smaller than 100.\nAnother way of expressing this would be to let x represent 90 and thus write the first equation as follows:\n\n100 \u2013 x = 100 \u2013 8(90)\n\nSince x represents 90, we can use the fact that 90 is the 8th number after 0 in base 10 (8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15).\nThus, 100 = 10 \u00d7 10 + 0 and 100 \u2013 x can be written as the following:\n\n10 0 = 10 9 1 (n) + 0\n\n10 = 8 1 (n)\n\n9 = 8 1\n\n8(8) 1 \u2013 x = 0 \u2013 0\n\n8(80) 1 = x\n\n8(8)(x + 1) = 0\n\n8x 8x are all multiplied by x + 1 except x.  x + 1 = 8, which means that 8x or 8", "answer": "E: row boat"}

When you factor percent into it, you do not consider 1.5% which is 0.015. You want 0.01 to be in the equation. This happens because percent is a measure of how much and it is measured in percentages when you buy something.\nSo we need to find the difference in cents of 1 cent and 15 cents.  One Cent=$0.01\nFifteen cents=$.15\nWe multiply One cent and fifteen cents to figure out the total cost of the 1.5% answer.\n1*.15=$.015\nSo the final answer for B is $50;$49.5\n\nInput:Chooses:  A: 10% B: 0%\nOutput:The answer for this question is choice B because if it is 0% back it cannot be 10% because it is in between percentages and percentages are 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50%. \nThe difference between 10% and 0% is 10%.

However, since the sum of the boys and the sum of the girls is 3, the last student must either be a boy or a girl.\nFor each boy and each girl, there are only 2 pairs each, and therefore, each one must come with a partner.\nFrom that, we also have found that each boy must come with another boy, and each girl must come with another girl.\nSince it is not mentioned whether the same amount of boys came for the same reason or not,\n1=1 which means 10 students came for the same reason and\n1=1 which is a total of 20 students came for another reason. \nSo the final answer should be 20\n\nInput:There are 17 new books to be checked out at the library.

If the normal price of an item is $500 and the sale price of that item is 10% off of the normal price (for the promotion period), how much will the item cost if it is bought between 1/15 and 2/15?\nOutput: We need to find which set of dates covers what amount the item will cost.\nLet\u2019s say the item normally sells for $500.\nIf discounted, it would be $450\nSo if it costs $450 for 2 months we\u2019re at $60 per month.\nBut 75% of $60 is $45, and 25% of $65 is $16.25\n\nThis indicates that the deal falls in the 75% and 25% percentile of the range, and hence, it is between 1/9 and 3/9 which are 1/8 and 4/8.\n\nSo the final answer $450\n\nInput: In a class of 20 students, 8 are tall and the rest are short.

The very concept of a family is an archaisitic one, and one that rarely serves to unite us. Artifacts remind us of our family, and that all families can be broken, if we're not careful. So when we take an artifact, that's both to connect with those memories and break them open.

If the maximum force exerted on the braking system is to be 675 lb (310 kg) (including the weight of the car), how large a braking force F at 500 pounds (227 kg) will result in an overload of 1%?\nOutput: Since the maximum force exerts on the braking system, including the weight of the car, is 675 lb and the brake holding the car while it is stationary.\nThen the maximum force that will not overload will be smaller than 500Kg or lb, so 500-.675 lb = <<500-.6x75=1.725>>1.725.\nThen, the maximum force that will exert on this braking system is 1.725 lb.\nBut F=D/A, meaning that 1.72 lb = f(500,1) = F/500\nSo F/(500)=1.725/500=1-675/50011= <<1-6750=11>>11\nAnd so, the maximum force would be 1-675 lb =<< 1-67.5=507.5>>507.5 lb", "answer": "E: eat corn"}

This totals four (2 + 2) trips, giving\n(1)(400/2) days. However, the rancher has 60 miles to go both ways, so the total travel per day in the truck will be [2x{400/2}](6/60) = 4. The total number of days the trip will take (4 + 4) will be\n2x{(400/2)} = 12.

Choices:  A: square shape B: different sizes C: flowers D: doors and windows E: high walls<n><n>### Response:		<n>We were able to get this question easily because it was so easy.  First we went<n>through the choices and narrowed down the options.  We did this by taking off one<n>or two options that were either unreasonable, or hard to find since they were "B" "C"<n>"D" and "E", which are a part of home furnishings etc.  What we did in this<n>question is we eliminated a few options and then we could do our work.   We could look<n>for a different size, which leads us to our room having a rectangle or square shape.  We<n>could also use our other options to be flowers since there is a window outside.  We<n>can also go to the option to have "high walls" since there isn't a floor or a bottom for<n>the room.  Once we saw these questions we answered yes, but some of these questions<n>are unreasonable like high walls, and some are too hard to answer since they are things we<n>were able to answer so we could narrow down to the "flowers" and "rectangle" answer.<n><n>### Input 2:<n>What if I told you that 9/10 doctors recommend that you should never use ________<n>when brushing your teeth?<n><n>### Response 2:<n>Our response for this question was the same as before which was we had to eliminate some<n>options.  Once we started out the question we saw the word "bad".  We knew that was<n>a bad idea to follow, we know the doctor is wrong, and it turns we was.  Therefore we<n>can cross "bad" of the options we eliminated.  We continue to go on with this<n>question.  We had three or four more options we had to eliminate.  One of which<n>would have been a brush or bristles since that what we use at least in my family.<n>We then looked at other options that the doctor said, "never use".  The doctor<n>didn't say, "use these too", or "don't use these because they are bad and never use<n>them", so if he said it's never good to brush your teeth we could eliminate the<n>options that are good as well. But he didn't say, "never use these", so we<n>could continue to answer this question at least until he

Choices:  A: living room B: dog park C: basket D: small apartment E: big house<n><n>### Response:		<n>A dog has an inherent drive to move around. For dogs, this includes bouncing from person to person and back again, chasing cats, or barking at the mailman. To satisfy these biological needs, dogs require the space to do so. If not properly exercised, they may start to nip at their owners' ankles, or excessively whine. If a dog's behavior becomes too much to handle, a professional trainer can help.<n><n>However, this isn't an option for many dog owners. In many cases, large or multiple dogs are crammed into small apartments. Oftentimes, this problem is due to a lack of a backyard, as many apartments have no access to yards at all.<n><n>To prevent dogs from becoming restless in apartments, dog trainers such as Kari Carroll recommend a high-quality dog food and toys. She also gives a few other options to keep a dog entertained. For more information on the different things you can do to prevent canine agitation, check out Carroll's video.<n>### Instruction Answer the following multiple choice problem.<n><n>### Input : In a survey of 1350 adults, nearly twice as many say they like eggs (55%)  as like bacon(30%).

Choices:  A: tide pool B: beach sand C: tidepools D: current E: cooking pot<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>I found the answer is 4. <n><n>First I tried to answer in B because a turtle crawls over smooth beach surface. But turtle has shell, so the answer should be 2<n><n>Next I answered with C because crab has claws that can move a small grains of sand. But sea crabs have claws that can’t move sand and rock. So the answer should be 3.<n><n>Further I answered with A because as the weather warms, food is plentiful and there’s a lot of sexual contact. Then a female crab can get pregnant at two to three months old. The crabs can change sex from one individual to the next, and will even engage in sex with another individual of either sex. The best chance for crab to reach sexual maturity during breeding season. So 2 more eggs is added to her clutch at once. And an egg takes 90 days to hatch. Each time a female crab molts, two babies hatch. Crabs molt to shed or lose their shells when they've filled up with food.<n>So turtle has only two eggs in one molting, but a baby takes 90 days, the answer is the most.<n><n>This is the answer of 4.<n><n>### Input：The turtle’s shell helps protect his soft body from predators. But how does a turtle’s claw protect itself? Choices: A: scrapes out  sand B: scraping seaweed C: eats small plants D: eating plants E: eats small shell<n><n>### Response：<n><n>I answered D, but this answer is C.<n><n>Turtle claw can move in sand to find food: Crabs have claws to dig food in sea floor or to scrape seaweed off of the seafloor. A crab’s claw is used to scoop and tease food from the bottom of the ocean.<n><n>A crab’s claws have tiny pincers on the ends to grip tightly. That can help the crab to grab plants to eat.<n><n>So the answer is C.<n>

If the bag contained 11 bags, how many did you get?<n><n>###  Answer:<n>The answer to how many bags there are left is three; one bag fewer. <n><n>Because there were 11 bags in the bag at first, there must have been two chips in each bag, so there are 22 chips in one bag. <n><n>In the original bag, there were 2 chips in each bag.

Choices:  A: gain experience B: taking notes C: listen carefully D: complete test E: focus<n><n>### Response:		B<n>### Explanation: This was a tricky one. As I am sure you figured the answer is A. The options were listed and the only thing to do is figure out which one does not belong. The one that doesn't belong is letter E. Focus means that they listen carefully and if they listen carefully than they are sure to hear the information given. This option doesn't make sense because you can't "focus" if you have other things going on such as the things in letter B.<n><n>### Input<n><n>You know that each of the three numbers is a multiple of 3.

If I have read it I could describe the story and write details etc. So the question could never ask me, ‘Have you read ‘The Frog Princie’,’ because it can never ask me anything.<n><n>### What I would say:<n><n>This question really makes you think.<n><n>### Task<n><n>Can you come up with a question like this?

Choices:  A: antique store B: in the graveyard C: kitchen D: junk yard E: ice<n><n>### Response:		<n>In order to answer this question it is important to consider which option is more likely. It can be inferred that the icebox is old because it is broken. It could also be noted that an antique store would sell iceboxes and wouldn't discard of them. It is probably easier and therefore more likely that the icebox would end up in the graveyard than the other options due to the lack of alternatives.<n><n>### Input 2:You have a large empty space to fill in a house you are building. A 9×13 rug will do. What size rug do you need?  <n>Answer 2:101<n><n>###  Input:If 3 apples cost $3.50, how much do 5 apples cost?<n><n>### Response 2:<n>If it cost $3.5 for 3 apples and 3 + 3 = 6 then we can say that 5 apples would cost $12.50 because, 5 x 3.5 = 18.75 and since the maths round the answer in this situation it might cost $12.75 but because it is the answer to the closest possible integer it doesn't make a difference.<n><n><n><n>

The sign has two lines of text next to it, and there are people in the second line of text.<n><n>### Response<n>Answer: (A and B) The sign has a picture, and two lines of text, which means it's not a roadblock or carwash.

(D) People in a carwash don't stand next to a sign, they stand inside a car. Lastly, there's no carwash sign with two lines of text next two people, so the only other choice is (A).<n><n>### Instructions:<n>Please provide sample response (s) for each problem that is the appropriate completes the request. **Please be thorough, as this will impact the overall understanding.**<n><n>### Instructor Comments and Examples of Solutions:<n>Sample responses:<n><n>| Input: |  |<n>|:---:|:---:|<n>| For every 12  cans you recycle | 12 |<n><n>| Input: Betty picked 17 strawberri es.

Children want to be where they learn all of the things they have to know at their age. They do not really want to be in a place where they do not want to do any work. Instead of being in a classroom, why not make the school more fun to a young person? Allow them to have more recess time or a break in between every quarter. Children need to have all the help and knowledge they need in school.

But they are very different to one another. A civil act is an action or behaviour that is generally accepted as correct.<n><n>### Reference:<n><n>[Definition in the form of answer to multiple choice question](https://www.meriam-webster.com)<n><n>[Dictionary meaning to civil actions](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=civil%20actions)<n><n>[Difference to Civil acts and civil actions](https://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-civil-acts-and-civil-actions/)

The program should return 4, because the largest integer you can make with 4 values (the maximum allowed is 10) where the values can be all unique is 4.<n><n>### Solution<n>Let's say you have three integers: n, x, and y. The maximum size for n can be x. n = x. Then, x is unique and it has value y. n = x + y. n = z<n><n>```python<n>def main():<n>    n = int(input("n = ".upper()))<n>    x = int(input("x = ".upper()))<n><n>    y = x<n>    z = n - x<n>    print(z)<n>    return z<n><n>main()<n>```<n><n>### Demostration:<n>Input: 4<n>Input: 7<n>Input: 3<n><n>## Instruction<n>Given that 3 has two digits, you need to change it to one and change all remaining numbers to one digit.  Given this, print out all the possible outcomes starting at 00 to 99. If there are no solutions, print "NO OUTCOMES" instead.<n><n>Input: For instance, if we started with 33, we can change one to 3, so 33 = 30, changing the 33 to a 3 is correct, next i = 0, so the result is 03. Next we have 65, so change one to 6, so now we have 45 which does not require any more changes, so the complete solution is 036545.<n><n>### Response/Input:<n>Input: 33<n>Your answer would result as:<n>030<n><n>## Instruction

This is a rule if the rule is:  If the total number is 57, then it is 7 less than a dozen.<n><n>* A:  If you look at the question, it gives us what we need.  They told us they picked 16 Strawberries.  We need to think of some rules in order to create the answer.  The rules can be written as:  <n>  a-b=12<n>b = a-12<n>b = b-12<n>b-12 = b<n><n>The _b_ has no value so it would be: b<n><n>b - 12 = 88<n><n>a - 88 = 16<n><n>* This means Betty picked 16 Stawberries.<n><n>* B:  If you look in the question, we are told they picked more than Betty.  So we can assume the second piece of information is their total.  Again we can write the rules:<n><n>  a+m+n = 1<n><n>   a = 1 - m - n<n><n>  n = 1 - m-a<n><n>  m = 2n - a<n><n>The _a_ has no value so you could say: 1 - 3 - 14 = 1<n><n>1 - m - n = 56<n><n>m = 10 - 56<n><n>n = 10-5 - 10<n><n>So the answer to the question is:<n><n>* m = 10<n><n>* n = 10<n>

Choices:  A: complications B: tiredness C: anger D: trial E: court case<n><n>### Response:		E (What feeling might propel people to instituting civil case in a court is anger.  We can see this from the examples in history which indicate that the people have gotten involved in civil action when there are complications and when they are tired of some situation. Complications are situations that are complicated and a very good example of this is when there is a problem in the government. When there are complications in the government there’s a need for someone to come in and help the problem to be solved. Tired people are the ones seeking justice in court because they are frustrated with the situation and there’s a need to get the situation solved. This is an indication that it’s complications that push people to instituting cases in court.  )<n>

Choices:  A: direct traffic B: board vessels C: arm themselves D: help people E: find drugs<n><n>### Response:		<n>For every 12 can you recycle, you get $0.50.<n><n>Therefore for 12 recycled cans, $6 is equivalent.<n><n>Input: Betty and Matthew together picked 44 strawberries. Natalie picked 24 fewer strawberries than the combined total.  Each jar of jam used 14 strawberries.  If they earned $3.50 per jar and used 24 for the canister, how much money did they make?<n><n>Answer: $71.2.<n><n>There are 44 strawberry for Betty and Matthew and the others have 24 strawberries and that means total of 68 strawberries which is equivalent to 13.5 strawberries.<n><n>If a jar use 14 strawberry then we can say that each jar used 57 strawberry. So 13.50 is equivalent to the cost of 7 jar of jam and 57.5 is equivalent to total number of strawberry and that means 21 jar were sold of jam each costing 3.50.<n>

Choices:  A: heartburn B: have fun C: enjoy D: gas E: food poisoning<n><n>### Response:		<n>Your response should contain the entire name of a proper noun, such as that which you might find at the beginning of a sentence. If you are unsure if you are looking at a proper name, then think about if you can replace it with "I" or not. That will help you in determining if it is a proper name or not. <n><n>### Important Note about Proper Nouns: <n><n>In order for the pronoun to make a sentence grammatically meaningful, it needs to be identified by the following:<n><n>1. It needs to start with either a capital/uppercase letter<n>2. It needs to start a sentence (no sentence case in the middle of a sentence).<n><n>Shorthand notations such as 'u' or uppercase "i" do NOT mean it is a capital letter, so make sure you check it with the above two rules by reading the whole sentence where it is used to see if it actually is the first letter of a sentence. For example u can mean ugliest, capital "I" can mean I hope he isn't awake yet, etc. and are NOT proper names. <n><n>##<n><n>

We did this by taking off one\nor two options that were either unreasonable, or hard to find since they were \"B\" \"C\"\n\"D\" and \"E\", which are a part of home furnishings etc.  What we did in this\nquestion is we eliminated a few options and then we could do our work.   We could look\nfor a different size, which leads us to our room having a rectangle or square shape.  We\ncould also use our other options to be flowers since there is a window outside.  We\ncan also go to the option to have \"high walls\" since there isn't a floor or a bottom for\nthe room.  Once we saw these questions we answered yes, but some of these questions\nare unreasonable like high walls, and some are too hard to answer since they are things we\nwere able to answer so we could narrow down to the \"flowers\" and \"rectangle\" answer.\n\n### Input 2:\nWhat if I told you that 9/10 doctors recommend that you should never use ________\nwhen brushing your teeth?\n\n### Response 2:\nOur response for this question was the same as before which was we had to eliminate some\noptions.

Therefore we\ncan cross \"bad\" of the options we eliminated.  We continue to go on with this\nquestion.  We had three or four more options we had to eliminate.  One of which\nwould have been a brush or bristles since that what we use at least in my family.\nWe then looked at other options that the doctor said, \"never use\".  The doctor\ndidn't say, \"use these too\", or \"don't use these because they are bad and never use\nthem\", so if he said it's never good to brush your teeth we could eliminate the\noptions that are good as well.

You are able to clean 6 blocks an hour as long as you have energy, but you need to stop for a nap every five blocks you clean to rest.\n\n### Input\nYou receive a list of the hours you have worked for each of the 47 days you've been working, in the order in which your cleaning work happened. You don't have the exact hours you took in each nap, but you know that your totals never add up correctly (i.e., every nap you've taken should have been for less than 5 hours, or your accumulated time working plus total naps taken should not be less than 47).\n\n### Output\nThe output consists of a list of the times within the day that you take a nap, or a message stating that you haven't been able to correctly deduce when you take the naps.\n\nYou will be given a list of the weeks in which you have worked. The list will always include all the weeks within the range you received the instructions for (i.e., if you work Monday through Friday, you will receive Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc. in the list).\n\nThe days within a week will be in chronological order within each week (i.e., the order in which your employer gave you the job). The days will be in order of the day of the week, then the date (Monday is 1, Tuesday is 2, etc.). The times will be given in 12-hour military format. Times will be given in hour/minute format (i.e. 10:25).\n\nThe total number of hours you are to work and the number of naps you're to take is fixed. There will always be more days in the year than the hours you are to work on the days you are told. If you work 10 hours a day but are only given 8, you have no way of knowing where to rest, and thus not enough information to make an accurate assessment.\n\n### Demo:\n\nInput: 120000 = Hours", "answer": "B: solar energy"}

{"text": "A dog has an inherent drive to move around. For dogs, this includes bouncing from person to person and back again, chasing cats, or barking at the mailman. To satisfy these biological needs, dogs require the space to do so. If not properly exercised, they may start to nip at their owners' ankles, or excessively whine. If a dog's behavior becomes too much to handle, a professional trainer can help.\n\nHowever, this isn't an option for many dog owners. In many cases, large or multiple dogs are crammed into small apartments. Oftentimes, this problem is due to a lack of a backyard, as many apartments have no access to yards at all.\n\nTo prevent dogs from becoming restless in apartments, dog trainers such as Kari Carroll recommend a high-quality dog food and toys. She also gives a few other options to keep a dog entertained. For more information on the different things you can do to prevent canine agitation, check out Carroll's video.\n### Instruction Answer the following multiple choice problem.\n\n### Input : In a survey of 1350 adults, nearly twice as many say they like eggs (55%)  as like bacon(30%).

So the answer should be 3.\n\nFurther I answered with A because as the weather warms, food is plentiful and there\u2019s a lot of sexual contact. Then a female crab can get pregnant at two to three months old. The crabs can change sex from one individual to the next, and will even engage in sex with another individual of either sex.

If the bag contained 11 bags, how many did you get?\n\n###  Answer:\nThe answer to how many bags there are left is three; one bag fewer. \n\nBecause there were 11 bags in the bag at first, there must have been two chips in each bag, so there are 22 chips in one bag. \n\nIn the original bag, there were 2 chips in each bag. The second bag only has 3 chips in it.\n\nTo figure out how many bags were in the first bag, take away the number of chips that come in the second bag and divide by 1 - the number of bags you started with.\n\nIn this example 11 divided by.5=22 bags.\n\nSo the original bag contained 2 bags less than there are left.\n\nTo sum up: There are 22 bags in the original bag. There is 1 bag in the first bag that you purchased.

Write a response that accurately completes the request or provides the appropriate solution.\n\n### Detailed Explanation:If\n(10 % of 50) = 5 =5;\n(10 % * 5) = 50 = 5;\n5/(10%* 5) = 40 = 5\n\n### Input \nThe average temperature in this town was 63\u00b0F on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.\nThen the temperature was 67\u00b0F on Friday. What is the temperature on Saturday?\n\n### Response \n\n### Programming Task\n\nThe temperatures for each day are 70, 66, 74, 72, and 74.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe highest average is 72 and the smallest average is 67. \nIf you solve 4x10 = 140, this would be 10. If each day has a different temperature, then subtracting 5 from the 63 = 58. Since it is the lowest average, take the remainder of the average (58=58) and divide it by 5. The result would be 11.6, which is the smallest average.\n\n### Programing Task\n\nWrite a program that will calculate the average amount that someone earns in an average year. If someone earns the same amount a year, this average will be 0. The amount someone", "answer": "D: concert hall"}

This is a rule if the rule is:  If the total number is 57, then it is 7 less than a dozen.\n\n* A:  If you look at the question, it gives us what we need.  They told us they picked 16 Strawberries.  We need to think of some rules in order to create the answer.  The rules can be written as:  \n  a-b=12\nb = a-12\nb = b-12\nb-12 = b\n\nThe _b_ has no value so it would be: b\n\nb - 12 = 88\n\na - 88 = 16\n\n* This means Betty picked 16 Stawberries.\n\n* B:  If you look in the question, we are told they picked more than Betty.  So we can assume the second piece of information is their total.  Again we can write the rules:\n\n  a+m+n = 1\n\n   a = 1 - m - n\n\n  n = 1 - m-a\n\n  m = 2n - a\n\nThe _a_ has no value so you could say: 1 - 3 - 14 = 1\n\n1 - m - n = 56\n\nm = 10 - 56\n\nn = 10-5 - 10\n\nSo the answer to the question is:\n\n* m = 10\n\n* n = 10", "answer": "C: winter storm"}

We can see this from the examples in history which indicate that the people have gotten involved in civil action when there are complications and when they are tired of some situation. Complications are situations that are complicated and a very good example of this is when there is a problem in the government. When there are complications in the government there\u2019s a need for someone to come in and help the problem to be solved.

Choices: A: list of books, list of cats, list of cities, list of dogs, list of numbers\n\nResponse:\nThe solution is: Choice C\n\nRationales:The list of dogs does not have a repeated item. Other than that, the other lists also do not. The list of numbers has a repeated number.\n\n### Input\nWhich list below has a repeated item?\n\n### Answer\nAnswer: C\n\n### Rationlaes\nRationales:\n\nThe two best methods to find the number of repeated items in a list is to find the number of the distinct elements from the elements in the list. If the distinct elements is the same as an element in the list, that means there is a repeated item. So you subtract or divide by -1 or 1, which ever number does not fit, if you get the number of elements in the list or 1, it means there is a repeated number in the list.\n\n### Explanation:\nWhen you divide the first and last number, you get 27 and -0.27. The divisor is -0.27, but the -0.27 is divided out for -1. So now the divisor is 1. So, you divide by 27 and you get 1, which means there is a missing number. Thus, the list has a repeated item in it.\n\n### Questions\nWrite a script that can find the maximum, minimum, and sum of a stack.\nWrite a script that will add a list of integers.\n##", "answer": "A: jewelry store"}

{"text": "C - Hands\n\n### Rationales:\nInput: John was punching and it was only bloodying his knucles meaning he was hurting himself.\nSo John was suffering from being angry and hostile.\nIf John is angry he would be hostile and if John has hostility he would be angry.\nSo, John is angry and hostel.\nHe was hurting his fists because he couldn't hold his tools.\nSo, he was hurting his hand instead of his tool.\nInput: Choices:  A, B, C, D, E\nIt only makes sense for John to be suffering from anger (A) and hostility (B), meaning he is angry and hostile. This is because if John was angry then he would be hostile, meaning he would make it into A and B instead of A and C because he wouldn't be hostile at all so he wouldn't need to be angry as well. This means he wouldn't make it into D as he would be angry and hostile meaning it doesn't make since for him to be angry at this point, he would be too hostile. We use this knowledge that John is angry and hostile to lead us back to A&B, which is what he is. From this we know why he is being hostile to his tools, it's because he is angry but he can't be angry at the tools themselves so he is being hostile at his tools through anger because he is confused. Now, we can know that we can cross out D, D doesn't make sense because if John is angry, he is angry at the tools. If, John, only used fists to attack, then D does make sense because \"Fists\" is a part of \"Anger\" (A) and \"Hostility\" (B) meaning D would only make sense if John also \"did\" anger and hostility. So we know that hostility (B) and angry (A) are true, now we need to find which makes the most sense to be on \"Had\", the had needs to be in the right order for it to make sense and so far D makes the most sense in that position. We can move the B and A to the had positions, which means we can move the D to the had positions as well. So we can now take all of the letters to be on \"HAD\".", "answer": "E: hands"}

Since their responses were generally in the same order as the correct answers, plus their reasonings were valid (e.g. 25% were wrong) it seems like they have been successful in understanding the skills taught, namely, identifying logical relationships between numbers.

{"text": "E (Grand Piano):  Lying with a broken leg on a grand piano is the correct answer. A spinning wheel, ladder, hospital bed and legroom are things you can do to help with a broken leg. Lying on a grand piano is not one of these, which makes A an incorrect answer. Being on a ladder to fix a window is not something you can do with a broken leg, which leaves B an incorrect answer.

For Baby Boomers, those born in 1946 or before, a person's chances of dying on their birthday are 3%.  This figure increased for Generation Zero, those born in 2000 or later, to 6%.\n\n### Rationales: Birthdays occur in cycles of 12 years. From Genzero to GenX, 12 is a 2 period binning. GenZero had 266 deaths, therefore its 12 period cycle is 266/12 = <<266/10=26.6>>26.6 years, and GenX is 1 year in one generation, 26.6 in the previous (26-6.6 = <<26-6.9=20>>20 years), 2 periods = 2 generations, so for each 26.6 years 10 birthdays were lost in GenZero (26.6/10) compared to those who died in the previous generation (20/10 = <<", "answer": "E: england"}

There are so many options, so it is impossible to answer definitively.  However, the obvious question is:  where is the center table?  It is not at a reception unless you make reservations in advance and are in a fancy spot reserved for a special event.  Therefore, A is incorrect.  It might be at the restaurant.  But, that seems unlikely as the other items are specific to a wedding.  B might make sense if a church does have a basement and a function area where the reception could be held.  Churches that I have been in do not have this sort of event area.  C and E both do not make sense because of what we already know.  C is unlikely because it describes a church basement, while A tells you it would be a restaurant.  You do not have a reception for your marriage in a church basement.  You never want to sit there longer than necessary lest somebody come to call you!  E makes sense, however C also makes sense, so E is not the only choice.  There is a reason it was not given that the restaurant is at the church itself.  In fact, it is not really common to want a restaurant at the church.  It is uncommon, and is a choice that would make you think twice if you ever had to pick it.\n\n### Input; Write a response that appropriatly completes the request\n\n#### (1) What type of workplace behavior would a leader be taking initiative on which is described by \"Ask yourself, could the organization's mission, vision, strategy, goals, plans, and policies all be summarized in a single paragraph\"?\n\nAnswer: (1).

Annie has twice as many brothers as Betty does, and only twice as many brothers as Charlie does.  Betty has twice as many sisters as Charlie does.  How many brothers does Annie have?\n\n### Rationale:\nAnnie's brothers = 2B\nBetty's sisters = 2S\nCharlie's brothers = B\n\nIf Betty has twice as many Sisters as Charlie, that means Betty has 2S. Charlie only has half as many sisters than Betty does, which is 2S / 2.\n\nThat makes Annie have 2B+2S / 2 = 2B + 2S.\nThat evaluates to 2B + S/2.\nTo find S/2, divide S from both sides by 2.\n\n\\[2(2B + S/1) = 2B + S / 2\\implies 2B+S = S \\text{ and } 2B + 1/2S = B\\]\n\nSubstitute B for S/1 and use the second equation.\n\\[B+1/2(2B+S) = B \\implies  B + 1/2(2(2B+1/4S)) = B\\]\n\nThe number that evaluates is 3B. Let's call B = x.\nThe answer for the number of brothers Annie has is 2x + x = 3x.\n#### 3x\nAnswer: 3x\n\n### Credit:\nCredit goes to [Gon\u00e7alo Oliveira](https://www.youtube.com/user/oliv35/about) for the algorithm.\n\n### Note:\nI modified the", "answer": "A: conquer opponent"}

We can confirm with the rationales for the example, that \nremaining = 236-2(52)=<<Remaining=236-2*(52)=235>>235, so remaining = 235 out of which there are 53 out which there are 52 tooth bruches.\n\n### Input for another example:\nInput:Sally picks 40 seashells on monday.

The cost increases if the tank is bigger.\nSince the tank is bigger it has lower cost, so our answer should be B.\n```\n$1 * 54 = A\n$1 * 62 = B\n$1 * 1.1 * 55 = C\n```\n\nNow we can write and test our formula using new values. If we assume A = 14 gallons, B = 4 gallons, C =, then A > B > C.\n##### Answer:C\n\n## 2) Input:The Coffman family are trying to fill up their 3 cars with fuel. The first car holds 12 gallons. The second car holds 22 gallons. The third car holds 10 gallons. Choices A: 24 gallons gallons of gasoline = $41. B: 14 gallons of gasoline= $26. C: 64 gallons of gas= $30.\n\nThe number of gallons in the tank of a car affect both the amount of gas used and the price. This is because the amount of gas used depends on the number of gallons in a tank while the price depends only on the amount of gas used.\nAs a result,", "answer": "D: wildlife refuge"}

His mother will be 4 times as old as he is in ten years.  How old is his mother now?\n\n### Response A: Dr. Smith is currently 36 years old, for every 10 years someone ages 10 years, therefore his mother's age will increase by a cumulative of 4 times Dr. Smith's age in 10 years, or a total of 40 years. Therefore, based on information provided, Dr. Smith's mother would be 40 years by that time.\n\n### Response B: The doctor is 36 years now, his mother will 4 times as old, therefore 8 times as old. So 4 times as old is 6 times as old and it was given that his mother's age, we also know his mother's age is 36,and the mother's age is going to be 4 times as much. 4 times as old =44 which times 4 times as old 4 times 4 is 16 which times 4 equals 64. The doctor's mom is 64.\n\n### Input : Dr. Smith is 40 years old now.  Ten years ago, she would have been seven times as old as Dr. Smith is now 7 times as old = 280, times 7 = 2000, so her mom would be 2000 years old now.\n\n### Reponse: The doctor is 40 years now, her mom would be seven times as much 7 = 28, so 28 times as much 7 times 7= 192, so she would be 192 years old \n\n### Instraction:Choose the response that most closely corrects the given sentence.\n\n### Sentence 1: The class is playing four squares.

A: working on a family farm as an employee B: growing crops for sale on an employee-owned family farm C: working on a hired farm as an employee D: owning all of the cows and farming your own land\n\n### Response\n\n#### Answer C\n\n### Rationales:\nThe family farm might seem like a great idea that will pay more off than a hired farm, but there are many more costs involved.  In this case the costs are that \"growing crops for sale\" is likely the most costly and could take years or even decades to gain profit, where as in \"owning all of the cows\" and farming your own farm, would give much better results.  Owning cows would allow you to sell them for profit and also take them to the farm and get to know every cow individually.  In this case, you will get a better understanding of how to take care of the animals and where else you could possibly make more profit and become much more successful in \"making money\" at the farm.\n\n#### Answer C", "answer": "D: further education"}

The patient who needed five pints got fifty pints of medicine, but after that patient is cured, there are twenty-five pints left.

{"text": "Which race is always attended by huge crowds?\n#### Kentucky Derby\n\n### Rationales:\nThe Kentucky Derby is the most famous horse race in the United States. The Derby is the first leg of the American Triple Crown. In 1872 the Kentucky Derby was started by Col. Merriweather Lewis Clark as a tribute to the great victories of American horses at the English Derby. The name \"Derby\" was taken from the famous English Derby. The Kentucky Derby was the first stakes race for \"Three Year Olds\" in the United States and is known as \"The Fastest Two Minutes in Sports.\" The race was first run at one and one eighth mile or nine furlongs. It was changed in 1896 to its present distance of one and a quarter miles or ten furlongs. The race is held every year on the first Saturday in May at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. The Kentucky Derby is a \"Graded\" stakes race, the highest rating. There are 20 qualifying races to determine which horses make the starting field of 20 in the Kentucky Derby. There are many interesting statistics related to the Kentucky Derby. From 1913 to 1924 the total post-time favorite won every time. Since 1939 there has been only one year (1958) that a horse with poor odds did win the Kentucky Derby. In 1977 the race was run on a Wednesday for the first time due to the weather conditions. It is the greatest two minutes in America, and it is one of the most celebrated races in the world. The Kentucky Derby is the only triple crown race in horse racing in the United States and one of only five in the world. The others are the Epsom Derby in England, the Irish Derby, the Japan Cup and the Prix de L'Arc de Triomphe in France.\n\n### Choices:\n\nA: race track.\nB: kentucky derbiy\nC: american southwest.\nD: triple crown.\nE: horese derby.\n\n### Response by:", "answer": "B: kentucky derby"}

While the Ontario beavers are known to live mostly along the coastal areas it has been known that they are found to be making their way to the inland rivers that connect their coastal areas to their river. What makes the Ontario beaver a threat to machinery and dams is its ability to use limbs of trees for chewing. Also the beaver can use their flat scaly tail for digging. They are normally found to be the most common among beavers. The bark is one of nature's defenses for the trees that are damaged by trees trying to fight for the resources that are necessary to live and to fight for survival. This is a fight that many trees fall to every year even without it being the case of beavers attacking them. It is just part of a continuous cycle that is repeated every year that only those who can do battle are able to live.\n\n### Input.\n\"There are 50 children in the class.

{"text": "A\n\n### Demand:\nThe waiter will either set the table or serve food to the table.\n\n\n### Response 1 - What will a waiter do:A\n\nThe waiter may serve food or set the table depending on the situation. In a formal and casual setting a waiter serves the food, while at a fast food place a waiter may only set the table.\n\n### Rationale 1 - Why does the waiter serve food?: Formal setting\n\nIf working in a casual restaurant, the waiter may serve food, depending on the table. If there is a table of five people, the waiter may decide to just bring out food since there are many plates to wash. If working in a restaurant, the waiter will serve the food because of the many plates to washed and the amount of work required. The waiter will only set a table in a formal setting, where there are many courses, and he is not allowed to deliver the food. He can be told that he is not allowed to bring the food to the table, or they are just not eating at a casual restaurant.\n\n### Response Rationale 2 - Why does this happen at a fast food place?: Formal eating setting\n\nBecause it is not a formal eating setting, the waiter sets the table since a table of five would not be difficult, and it is faster. He doesn't want to be there for a long period of time and make less money, so it would be faster to just set the table. Although this is a hamburger joint, it is more of a formal setting, such as a sandwich shop or bakery, because they use silverware instead of plastic ware.\n\n### Input 2: \n\nIn a formal setting, such at a wedding, the waiter is more likely to serve the food depending on the type of food. If the food is a hamburger, the waiter may not serve it. For every place, there is a setting in which it should be more formal or informal.\n\n### Dismissal:\nThe response you chose will work because it has a high probability of happening. It is likely that the waiter will go to the formal eating restaurant to set the table, because it is the correct action to take. It is most likely that the waiter at", "answer": "E: present bill"}

How many fish do I usually catch when I'm only fishing on Sundays?\n\n### Rationales:\n* This is the key to answering this question.  The total number of fish I catch is $22 + $21 + $19 = <$22+21+19>>20\n* Then use the 1/3 reduction in the second weekend (catching half as many fish as I had the previous weekend)\n* To find out how many fish I usually catch in each day\n* I have $43, so my average catch is $11.75\n* This is exactly what I usually catch!\n**This math would typically be done on your own paper to get the right answer, but because the example is so simple, I am just going to complete the answer.\n\n### Rationale and Answer:\nSince there are 7 days between the first and second weekends, the average number of catch would be between 7- and 8- as that is the length that each week contains since that's the period of time between the 2 weekends.\nHowever, let's see if the answer is 7 or 8. In our very first weekend, I catch 2 fish which means the next day when I come back, I will have 2 fish in my possession.\nNext weekend, I catch a total of 4, which means the next day I will have 6. Then in the week that follows, I will have a total of 8 fish.\nLet's see if this is 8 fish- 2+4+6+8=22.\nWe still didn't reach the goal we wanted to (11.75).\nLet's see another scenario:\nFirst weekend I catch 2, and then on the next day I have 4.\nNext weekend I catch a total of $4$4$, and on the next day I will also have $4$", "answer": "E: menu"}

You see, while one can purchase a notebook at any store that has them, there are not a lot of places that they often sell them. A bookstore is one of them, but it is not as if they were the most popular place to buy them. The ones that I most often purchase them from are office supply stores, because a lot of them carry special types of notebooks that I like to buy.\n\nB) Is a notebook purchased at the abraham lincoln' s grave?\n\nI would not exactly say that one would be likely to purchase a notebook at the abraham lincol s grave but I do believe it is a possibility. I know that it is a place one might find a notebook, but I do not think it would be what most people would go into the grave to purchase. If that is the case, it also wouldn't be what most people would find there if they were looking for a notebook as it is not the kind of place one usually thinks of when they are looking for such things.\n\nC) Is a notebook frequently acquired in the classroom?\n\nThis question seems almost too obvious to answer, yet many people seem to forget to answer it. It would seem that the classroom is a place where people are likely to purchase a notbook. They do not, however, have notebooks where they purchase other things. It is a store where someone who needs it can go and purchase it, as much as most people would go and purchase a notebook. The only question here is exactly when in the classroom most people would go to buy one. For the most part, though, people would probably go to a bookstore to buy a notebook.\n\nD) Is a notebook found more often in a backpack than in a backpack?\n\nIn a backpack, a notebook is found in a lot of places. It is found in the backpack bag, but also in the backpack of a dog. For a lot of dogs, a notebook can be found in the dog' s backpack.

James' response is that he checked the family reunion tree and did not find his niece. This means that by default, his niece is not there (the reunion tree, like the entire family reunion, is very large).  The next thing he did was to go to the nearest town to get help from the town people (and possibly also to ask his father to come help his brother search the reunion tree).\n\nJames' niece was found near the family reunion. This answers the question about her whereabouts. It then asks about what James did next. The possible choices are what he _could_ do next. The fact that the choices are \"he asked his father to check the family tree\" and \"he called the police\" is telling -- either of those actions could be taken if it's later proven that the girl wasn't at the reunion tree (the reunion tree is the only other reasonable place to look).

In the 1983 the question of Hispanics changed to ask if people were Hispanics or non-Hispanics.

That means to find out what the final number of apples is (x) we have to divide 4 by 2.

Then it would have taken it on the 6, 8, and 10th. And since the cat took it on 16th it means it didn't take it on the 11th day. Then it wouldn't take it on 12, 13, as we can't take it over 3.

{"text": "E: Microwave\n\n## Rationale:The correct answer is an evenly distributed number of microwave ovens. Microwave ovens heat unevenly because microwaves are a type of radiation that has little to do with temperature, unlike a convection oven. They heat at different rates based on how they are placed in the oven. Most meals heat evenly, but some food is heated more quickly at one end than the other. You'll notice that food gets warm in the center very quickly, and the outside is a little cooler, which is why the microwave oven needs to rotate. You can find this out in a similar way to knowing that an oven has hot and cold spots. Try putting your plate in the oven, then take it out before it fully heats up. When you're trying to heat up a food, you're often putting in a certain temperature and it feels like that food has the perfect amount of heat for you when it is done, but the outside may still be cold, even when the center is hot. When food is put in the microwave (or any other type of radiation source in the kitchen, like toasters), the microwave ovens are heated to a much lower temperature. A typical microwave oven might heat up only 120 degrees Fahrenheit. This is still hot, but it's very far away from a typical cooking temperature. The microwave oven will also be cooler. When microwaves hit food, the electrons in the food move from one side of the food to the other in a very brief amount of time. This will usually take place without heat, unlike the oven, but the microwave will still absorb the energy and change the temperature of the food. That's why you can't warm up food that has already been heated by another source, because it will absorb the extra heat and change the temperature once again. This happens if you put a piece of ice into a microwave. You can feel the ice start to melt and you can tell if it's completely gone. If the ice hasn't been put into the microwave overside of the bowl where it is being heated (rather than sideways or upside down), the ice will start to melt, too. Then, it turns  into slush and", "answer": "C: space shuttle"}

You provide good reasons for your answers.  You give an intuitive feel for the problem.\n- What I find most helpful is the explanation.  You don't simply restate the problem.  I like to see if you can explain why the answer is the way it is.  For example, you explain that you picked the number 123 for two reasons:  you want to have a number that's \"about right\" in terms of 100;  and you also wanted to have a 3 in the second place.

But there is more to the explanation than that! Dusk is when the sun is at such an angle that the difference between the illumination on the upper and lower parts of a person\u2019s body is more noticeable than the illumination on any other part of the person\u2019s body. This phenomenon causes shadows to appear more elongated, which is why dusk is the right time of day to play golf if you want to play one day and not the next!\n\n#### \ud83d\udc1e After midnight:\nBecause light pollution is less prominent at night, stargazing and golfing is easier at night. The best time of day to play is after midnight. At this time, the sky is clearest.

Choices:  a. outside in a field b. at home c. in a tree trunk d. at a school\n\n### Response #2: A The answer is a, and the rationale behind being able to see a bear in a field is that people often visit fields that are not very far away. On the other hand, a bear at home is not easy to see, making it the least likely choice to be the correct one here!\n\n### Input#3: Which is not a thing that one would typically use to cook? Choices: a. a banana b. a cat c. a knife d. a spoon\n\n### Response#2: D The answer is D for a multitude of reasons! For example, you wouldn't typically cook with a spoon because when you bake the food, a spoon is used to stir the food. For this reason, a spoon would be considered a utensil, not a thing. Next, you do not typically use a knife to heat food, but a knife is a cooking utensil because it can be used to cook (chop the food or anything else), and this is why it is not considered a thing for typical consumption. Next, a cat would probably not be something that one would eat, and you would eat a banana not a banana. If someone were to be cooking, they would not use something that can be eaten, and therefore you would not cook with it. A knife, however, can be used to cook with because it can cut the food.", "answer": "C: grassy field"}

She doesn't like it when I take the trash out, and when I am doing chores, and many more bad tastes. However, the biggest pet peeve is when I come home, no matter if I am late for 15 minutes or 2 hours, Sally starts barking and acting crazy, and that is all she wants to do. I wish I could make her not feel that way, or for her not to have that pet peeve, but she has no control over it. To end on a better note, I have given her some peanut butter, and she seems a lot calmer.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. I don't watch movies so I can't really answer this question. I don't have a pet peeves when I go to the movies. I don't mind if I have to move once or twice while watching the movie.2. When I come home, my pet (Fido) is excited to see me. He licks my face and then comes to me, but he's a little too excited and barks.3. A pet is a person's beloved friend and so it should not be ignored, and I am sure that my pet wouldn't want to see me everyday if he wasn't his owner.\n\n4.

If you look at the picture, you can see that there are many rocks nearby as well as greenery to the right.  The sun is in the snake to provide heat.  There is a small pool of water to the left.  These features combine to create a very stable environment for the snake.  For an indoor environment, you would want to make sure that there are as many options for shelter as possible (especially if you wanted the snake as a pet).  You might need to buy a special substrate to increase the humidity.  With a lot of effort, you could create an outdoor habitat by buying lots of special supplies to make your own desert environment complete with a large pool of water. \n### Choice:  A\n####  A\nAnswer:  A\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question\n\n### Choice A:\nHow far is the distance between each block?

A more logical assumption would be that the bus takes 2 hours and 5 minutes each way.\nThis calculation would be time needed for the bus to return (since the bus takes approximately 1-hour on its way to campus, it would take approximately 1-hour for the bus to return), plus time at campus (20 minutes at the bus stop + 30 minutes on campus), plus time needed for the bus drivers to get from campus to the bus depot (40 minutes, at least).\nHence, it takes the driver(s) 105 minutes to get to the bus depot (+30 minutes on campus and 1 hour to get there and 30 minutes needed to get back), plus the 20 minutes the passengers spend at the bus stop.\nTherefore, the time it would take for the bus to fully take all the passengers, would be 120 minutes, plus the time it takes the bus to get to every station and depot it would take passengers to, and then get back, which would be around 4 hours and half an hour, or 4 and 12 minutes.\nSo the final output would reflect that the duration of this trip would be 125 minutes(+4.5 hours total).", "answer": "D: parking lot"}

What's the last day of the month she plays it?\nOutput: The first day she plays it is day 1.  The third day she plays it is the second day of the month because the day she buys it must be the first day of the month for her to only play it the next 4 days.  The last day she plays it was either day 8 or the first day of the next months where she will only play it the next four days.\nLet m represent the first day of the months she plays this game. Let u represent the last day the month she plays the game.\nBecause she plays it the next 4 times\n4u = <<4u=4m>>4m= 4 months\n4m-4 = 4(m-2)\nThis is because she starts playing it on day 1, which is the first day of the first month\nSince months start and end on the 1st\nThe m-2 represents all of the days following the 1st of the month where she plays the game. This is from the 2nd to the month following.\nSince she plays it for 4 months, she plays the 4 months inbetween between days 1 to 4.\nThus 4m=<<4m=4m+4>>4m+4, which reduces to 4m +8 = <<4m+8=4m+4+4>>4m +4 +4.\nAdded together this represents four in a row that she plays it (m+4), then 8 which represents the entire period that she played it on day 1 to day 2. The last day she plays is the last day of her playing the game - 8\nThis is thus 4m+4+8 = 6m + 12 / <<6m+12=5m+2>>5m+2\n5m+2 = <<5m+2/", "answer": "B: names"}

How far is the pendulum from the bottom of the starting position every second (in meters)?\nOutput:7 * 1.5*pi = *7*3.14 * 1.5 = 23.647 degrees (in radians)\nSince the pendulum is equal in weight, the acceleration of the pendulum will be the same every second.\nThe acceleration of the penduim is 23.65*9.8 * pi = *23.65 * 9.8 *3.14 = 42.92 meters/second\nSince the time it takes to complete one rotation is 1 second, the time at which it is halfway will be 0.5 seconds at first, but then will be half of that.\nThat means it will be 0.25 seconds half way through so the answer will be 42.9 meters/second / 0.25 = <<42.9/0.25=175>>175 meters/second\nSo the final answer will be 47.5.\n\nInput: A man has 4 dogs.

Since the sum is 31 it must be that 31 is even, meaning the larger number is divisible by two. Since 32 is divisible by two, if the larger number was divisible by two as well it would be a palindrome, meaning that it is even.\nThis is false, since a palindrome is not divisible by two.

After another 5 minutes in a hot tub, I felt great and took another 5 minutes in the sauna to relax. Which had the higher effect on my body temperature?\nOutput: The correct response is the hot tub, not the sauna. The hot tub raised your body temperature by an additional 5 minutes that the sauna would not have.\nIf you spend 5 minutes in a heated object and step out, you will feel hot for exactly 5 minutes when your body has cooled back down.\nIf you spend an additional 5 minutes in a cold environment (which results in the temperature of the body dropping by 5 degrees Celsius), your body temperature will continue to rise until 10 minutes later when it gets to be exactly as hot as it was the first time (since you only spent another 5 minutes, your total exposure was 10 minutes).\nThe cold environment only had the effect of returning your body to the prior temperature. The hot tub, though, put your body into a higher temperature range that you weren't before, and this will cause it to take a longer time to return to the previous temperature.\nSo if you spend 5 minutes at 90 degrees Celsius (which raises the average temperature of your body), you have to spend an additional 55 minutes (at 10 minutes per degree Celsius) at roughly 50 degrees Celsius to have the same effect.\nSo if you spent your 20 minutes at 30 degrees, you had to give 425 more minutes to get the same effect of 25 minutes of exposure in a sauna that you had previously.\nSo the final final response is hot tub\n\nInput: The area of triangle ABC = 3x2 - 8x + 15 and the base and height are equal.

He worked 450 regular hours during those 2 years.  In year number 3, he worked 265 hours overtime and 834 regular hours.  He averaged 6 hours of overtime per week over the course of the 3 years.  How many regular hours per week did he work in year 3 compared to year 2?\nOutput: He worked 265 - 450 = <<((-2)545=3(730)-146>>307 regular hours over the course of the years\nSince he averaged 6 overtime hours per week, this means he averaged 15 overtime hours over the course of 3 years.

Which of the following is not a possible value for n?\nOutput: The value of n is 20\nFirst, we can plug value of n (10 in the example) into expression 5*3 =15 +20, which equals to 60. This means that 5*3 will be 15 and 20 will be 20.\nAfter doing so, we plug 3 into 3*5 =15 +25, which equals to 75. The 3*5 is 15 and 75-15 equals to 60-15.\nFinally, we plug 5 into 5*3=15 +30, which equals to  85. The 5*3 equals to 15 and 85-15 will equal to 70-15.

How will the bagged popcorn be shared?\nOutput:First note that there are 35 pieces of popcorn to be shared among 5 people.\nThen set up our first equation.\nWe know that there are 30 pieces, so to find that there are 5 pieces left, we have to subtract 30 pieces from the original amount.\nWhen that happens, 5 is also what is used to represent the members in the carpool (Members/5=pieces)\nThis means then that our first equation is: 5 * (30/5)= pieces.\nThen set up a second equation.\nWe also know that at a 4/13 share ratio (4/13=0.3), we divide by 13 to get 4 pieces of popcorn for everyone.\nThis means that our second equation is: 0.3 * (30 / 13) = pieces.\nThen set these two equations side to side, in order to subtract the first equation's side by side.\nWhen this happens, these same equations' differences will get subtracted, so now we can replace them with their corresponding negative terms, where negative numbers are added to positive numbers:\n5 * (30 /2)= pieces\n0.3 * (27 /13) = pieces\nThis means that our third equation is: 5(27-13 ) = (2 * 13)) = 26 and so subtracting 13 from 26 gives us the result of 13, which gives us: pieces.\nSo, to find the amount of popcorn given to each member of the carpool divided by the number of members, we would get (.17).\nIn summary, the answer to this problem is that each member gets (.17) pieces of the bagged popcarn", "answer": "D: learn"}

{"text": "It feels like his motivation for actively working was paying debts not making money, not having money, not keeping the house.\nIf being able to pay bils is a reason then it does not make sense to say 'pay bills' in the sentence unless to express an exaggeration. 'Make money' is not an option as it does not reflect how he feels about it. 'Having money' is not an apt option since it seems the opposite of the situation. 'Keep house' is too general. 'Making money' seems the closest option since it reflects his mindset and it is not a direct action word like 'pay debts.'

The following spring, he went from a size 9 to 12; so, the next fall, he went from a 12 to a 15.  What size does Drew wear in the spring?\nOutput: In the fall he went from a size12 to a size15. So during spring he went from a size9 to 12.  This means that the next fall he went from a 9 to a 12 and his next spring he went from a 27 to a 9. Since each spring season is twice as long as the next fall season, in a year he goes from a 27->9->27->30->27 and so on.\nThe next time he enters the spring season he goes from a 12->24->24->48->9->18->9->27 and so forth. So the next time spring season comes the season of the earth rotates by the number times the season goes around once.\nIn 365=24*15, he goes around 24 times which means that he goes around 15 times. If he goes around 14 times in one time, then when the sun rotates once they would equal 365/15=<<365/1=24>>24 days.\nSo the final question is 24 days\n\nInput: On Mondays, a man walks 3 blocks north, then 2 blocks south.

{"text": "Aside from jumps away from humans, fleas have only three ways to move:\nA) FLEA JUMP: This is the infamous flea jump, where the flea jumps away from the danger. When it does so, it only jumps vertically, since if it jumps perpendicular to our world, it would fall to the ground. The flea only knows this when it touches some object on which it will rest (since fleas can't survive the fall because they can't absorb oxygen)\nB) FLEA ATTACK: Like a wasp, the flea stings when the person swats, and then uses this chance to jump away using the flea jump.\nC) FLEA EGGS: Flea eggs can only crawl or move by some form of jostling. Therefore, fleas can crawl, but they cannot walk, and they can only walk as part of an egg-laying process.\nD) FLEA DIARRHEA: When a flea defecates, it makes tiny, round excrement pellets. Then it \"walks\" along, carrying its pellet by attaching it to a \"basket\" on its underside that holds the poop.\nTo recap, fleas have three abilities to move (flea jump, flea attack, flea move by eggs, flea walk by poop):\nA) Flea jump - Jump if you're hit by a person. Flea attacks are performed when you're attacked and are a combination of a flea jump (upward direction) and a flea attack.\nB) Flea move by eggs - Move if you see a flea egg.

She knows that for every hour that passes, the temperature of the room is always 4 degrees more than it was the day before.What is the temperature in the room at 12:00 pm?\nOutput: \t58 degrees.\nSince it is at 9:53 am that the temperature in the classroom is 1 degree different than it was the day previously, it is at 56 degrees\nFor every hour that passes, if it is hotter outside than it was inside, then the temperature inside the class will rise by 2 degrees for every hour that passes\nFor example, If it is outside at 84 degrees and the temperature inside the class was 56\nThat means that it is hotter outside, so the temperature inside will rise by 2 for every hour that passes.\nThe temperature at the next hour will be 56 degrees plus 2=58\nSince, it has already reached 58 at 12:58, that means that it is 1 degree more than it was at 12:18.\nSo, the temperature at 12:48, would be 59 degrees.At 12:08, since it is even hotter outside, it will rise by another 2 degrees\nThat means that it will be 59 degrees degrees plus 2=61 degrees\nSince it is at exactly 12:09, then the temperature at 11:49 would be 60 degrees\nSo from then until 12:07, the temperature will rise by 1 degree", "answer": "C: body of water"}

Choices: 1: ants find sugar sweet. 2: ants do not eat sugar. 3: ants are attracted to honey. 4: ants do not care for either honey or sugar. 5: ants will only eat sugar if it has been covered in honey.\nOutput:You could put a drop of honey on a piece of sugar, then give it the ant.  If you do not give it any honey, not even a drop, it will be disgusted and leave as soon as it gets its hands on something else.  In this case, it would be your hands/arm/face/etc.  You could use the method of putting one drop of honey on some sugar, however, the ant is not attracted to sugar, but to honey.  Furthermore, ants will not eat sugar if it has not been coated in honey.\nThis eliminates the 3rd option\nThe remaining options are either the second or fourth choice.\nThe ant is not attracted only to honey, however, since the honey has the ability to attract ants, it is a means of attracting the ant to a sugar that the ant would not otherwise eat, and therefore the answer is \"ants will eat something because it is covered in honey\"\nSo the final answer would be 5.", "answer": "D: web page"}

{"text": "The correct answer is option B.\n\n* Visibility is dependent upon many different factors in an aquatic environment, but ultimately, aquatic visibility is greatly impacted by light scatter.  The intensity of light affects the transparency of the water that an observer sees.  This effect causes what is known as a light/water interface.\n* As light is scattered by suspended particulates, the observer perceives an increase in water clarity.  If particles are very small, they cannot be seen and cause a black background or what we know as complete or zero visibility.\n* If the particles are large enough to see, the background still may be muddy due to high concentrations of very fine particles.  Such particles create murky water, or turbidity in the aquatic environment.  These types of water are commonly referred to as brown water or tea water.  In some of the most extreme situations, one may not be able to see their hand in front of their face.\n\nComment: I just copied the instructions and your answer from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49310868/instructions-answer-the-following-two-choice-question/49509251#49509530), but I'd definitely avoid that site.

Each box contains a different number of each flavor of candy.  In how many combinations can the candyman mix the candies in?\nOutput: In order to get an easy question that we can solve by using the binomial theorem,\nwe can assume that every box contains 1 of each flavor, but in different amounts,\n\nIf, since there are 5 boxes, we have 5 ways to choose the candies' flavor,\nWe need to check, because of the question, that we don't have the same flavour multiple times.\nBut we can, because the answer is the total for each flavor divided by the total:\n5*4*^3/^5\nBecause, each flavor has two ways to choose it, and for the rest flavor we need only 1 time,\nso the number of combination become:\n(3!)/4^(4-3)\nAs we can see, every flavour has a total of 2^3+1, so, that means we can choose one for the 2^3 ones and the other for the one that only has one option.\nAnd in conclusion, the answer is 6, as we used the power 3 from 3 to 2, for the 3+2 flavors it is easier to use the power 3 from the number of ways to choose from 2,\nSo 6 * 2=12\nSo the final answer it is 12\n\nInput:What day of the week was February 14, 2012?

{"text": "The joke is that dogs are eaten in Chinese food.\n\nInput: I will pick 10 out of 29 dogs.  I pick 3 at random and remove these 3.  What is the chance that the picked dog will be my favourite?\nOutput: I choose 3 dogs to remove. Each dog is chosen randomly so for each dog I have 1/29 chance of selecting it. I have the chance to select my favourite with the same value (1/29) for each of the 10 dogs not removed (remember it is not possible to choose any one dog as each has a chance of being picked), so the chance that the removed dog is favourite is 0/10 0. So the chance that removed dog is not favourite is (1/29)*(9/29).\nMultiplying all that by 10 we get 0.355.\n\nInput: There are 360 points total on the paddleball court.

The referee adds 2 minutes to play any time that ball lands out of bounds, regardless if it results in a substitution. How much does it take for the substitute to be worth it for a soccer referee to sub players when the ball exits the goal? The ball exits the goal 3 times during the game, and every time it does, play resumes. The home team must pay $1 for the substitute. The away team must pay $2 for the substitute. When the ball leaves the goal, 14 seconds are added to the game clock.\nOutput: The time after a goal is scored in which a substitute can enter the game is 14 seconds.\n\n3 times the ball exits the field + 14 seconds is equal to the game clock. The game clock is 42 seconds per goal\nSo it takes 42 seconds for the substitute to be used since there are 3 possible goals.\n\n3 * 42 = 132 seconds\nAdding 14 seconds because the substitute can enter the game 14 seconds after the goal is scored.\n\nSo the total seconds that need to be counted is 132 + 14 = 146 seconds\n\nIf the home team pays $1 and the away team pays $2, this is equivalent to the home team paying $3\nSo the final answer for how much does it take for a referee to sub players is $3\n\nInput: I have $183 in a savings account that pays 9.4% annual interest.

A population is determined in a census like mentioned previously (B).\nC: Creating a government (a system of politics by which citizens interact with government) cannot happen without numbers.  For this reason, government systems are based on the population of the areas they govern.  A smaller population would imply smaller government systems, while a larger population would imply larger government systems (C).\nD: Numbers are not the only thing that exists in a population.  There are people, which is necessary to make a group.  A group would be formed from a population when the persons in that population start talking, writing, or working together (D).\nE: People's health and lives have nothing to do with the population of the area or any other element of the problem.  They can easily be independent of this and still continue (E).\nWe've learned that a government is created based on the amount of people in that area, and that's not the only way to create a government.  This, obviously, isn't true.  Therefore, they don't rise up in population.  This eliminates A and D.  B, and C have nothing to do with it either.  Finally, that has nothing to do with the problem.  Therefore, to summarize, B, C, and E are incorrect answers.\nFinally, population and group are somewhat similar, although there is a difference between them.  A population is people in an area, while a group consists of people working, talking, or writing together.  There are some groups that do not consist of numbers, such as a group of artists.  As this is true, D cannot be true either.\nTo conclude, population is numbers of people living in an", "answer": "B: populated area"}

The program stops when a number is not divisible by either 3 or 5.\nFor example, 15 fizzes, 5 bizzes, and 15 is printed, since the program stops when 15 is not divisible by 3(5) or 5(3) (15).\nSo the program outputs fizz 0, bizz 10 and the actual number 11!\n\n### fizz_bizz(i)\n\nThis is the main function where you would write any program logic!

How many pieces do I have in all?\nOutput:\nWe will find the number of possible solutions to our equations. For simplicity of notation in this solution, let our 48 shoes represent possible positions for each of our pieces.

We can use the shoes as a way to represent the number of possible moves in a solution. For example, with 48 shoes, that means we have 48 possibilities in each square where we can make a move. This means that in our solution, we have 48*48 = 2256 ways we can't get home because we move the wrong squares. This is the total number of invalid solutions.\nSince we know we have 4096 possible solutions, our question ends up becoming 4096 - (2256 + 4096) = 4092 total solutions that work.\nThis means that we need 40", "answer": "C: pantry"}

How far from Boston can the plane fly before it has to follow behind the train?\nOutput:Suppose the train travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, and the plane in the air travels at a constant of 500 miles per hour. If the plane had been in the air when the train left, by the time the plane is at 100 miles from Boston, the train will have traveled 600 miles, leaving the plane at 400 miles from Boston. If it took the plane 1 hour to get 100 miles ahead, it would have reached the train at Boston. Then the plane would have to fly over top of the train to get to the planned destination, but that would make another 400 miles in less than 1 hour for 600+400=<<600+4=604>>604 miles.\nSince there isn't any more room to fly, the planes must travel below the train, thus wasting time in pursuit. This process would be repeated for every 100 miles the train goes down the road.

They win a tie breaker by winning each game to win a total of 30 games. If the two opponents have won an identical number of games, who won the tie breaker?\nOutput: From the question, we know that the two opponents have played 21 chess games.\n\nSo after 21 chess matches, the one who has won 19 chesses games still has 5 games to spare as he has already won 21-5 = 16 of them.\n\nAnd the other one who has also won 19 chess games would have less than 5 games to play as he would have 21-19 = 2 games to spare.\n\nSo the one who has 5 games to play win the tie breaker as his/her final score is less than the 21 games.\n\nInput: If a farmer buys 8 cows for $3000, how much should he sell them for so he can break even?

Therefore, the amount of cows he sells is $1200. For the farmer to break even, he needs to sell $1200 - $300 = $900.\n\nLet's see if he can get twice as much by buying 4 cows for $36", "answer": "D: step forward"}

Last month there were 32 students and 4 teachers. How many students were there last month?\nOutput:This is the first question in the section with the word if:\nIf you think of 32 as the starting number or the amount of students, and 32 as the amount of students that were there last month, then:\nIf there are more students than teachers, the ratio is that the amount of students is greater than the amount of teachers. (36 > 4)\nIf there are less students than teachers, the students are less than the teachers. (32<4)\nIn order to know the difference between the numbers it's useful to divide them. (36/4)\nThe above information means that we can divide 32 by 36 to get the difference between the numbers. The difference between 32 and 36 is 24 (36 - 32). To put the difference back into normal form, we subtract the 32.\n32 - 36 = (-4)\n(32 - 32) / 36 = (-7)/4\n(7) / 4 = -2\n1 / 4 = -1/4\n\nSince you subtracted to get the difference in numbers, and you divided a whole number by a fraction you get a negative number.\n\nWhen subtracting and dividing a negative difference, you have to flip it so that the negative signs cancel. With 1/4 it is like we are dividing by one fourth: 4/1 = 4\nThe difference between 32-36 is negative but since you divided by the negative you are still left with a negative number (-(-4)) which is the same thing as saying +4 (since 1*4=4, -1*4=-4)\n\nThe correct answer should read: There were 32 students last month.\nSo the correct answer is F", "answer": "C: shop"}

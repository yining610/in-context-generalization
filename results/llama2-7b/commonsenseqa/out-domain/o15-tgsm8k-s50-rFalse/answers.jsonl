Next, fold the bottom corner up towards the top corner, forming an angle of about 30 degrees. Fold the top corner down to meet the folded bottom corner. Finally, fold the corner down to meet the opposite side of the paper. Hold the piece of paper flat and unfold the winglets. Place a piece of tape on each end of the paper. Stick the tape so it sticks to the paper, not to itself.\n\nInput: It\u2019s a fun game to see which one of your family could build a paper plane the best.\nOutput: It all starts with the plane itself. You can pick any size of paper or shape that you want. For example, you can make large planes that will catch wind easily, or small ones that may be too light for flying. You should always take a little time to look around and see what kind of trees you could collect leaves from. It\u2019s very easy to make a really good-looking paper airplane.

How long was the party?\nOutput: 88minutes\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n## Solution:\nThis question was a bit trickier than I thought it would be. For the first question, I didn't use the 20 years in future calculation until 19 of the past 20 years had passed. I made sure to take the difference between the age of the two and used the remainder as the actual difference for that age. Then I subtracted that number from the remainder. Then I applied the rest of the steps. I guess I will have to practice with more similar problems so I can get it down. \nFor the second question, I used the remainder from the first question. I wanted to know what that remainder was, but I think my approach to it worked well. \nFor the 3rd question, I got some really weird logic. I thought maybe I could find out how much each friend would be paying when the car was made. Then I could divide one person's cost by 5 to find out how many friends are in the group. I tried several things, but it didn't work as I wanted. \nFor the fourth question, the logic I used was probably the correct logic. I just had to make sure I divided correctly. That's basically the way I did the problem the first time. This time, I just took the $240 and I divided by 5. Then I subtracted $3 from $100. I think I did that step incorrectly. \nFor the fifth question, I got a little confused, but I found a way to do what I was trying to do. I just reused some previous logic I had used. \nFor the sixth question, I also got confused at first,", "answer": "B: hospital"}

{"text": "Rare\n\n### Instruction:Answer the questions below.\n\nHow many Pokemon cards did you have as a kid?\nAnswer: I don't think I ever had more than 50 in my collection. When I was little, Pokemon cards were not very popular in the United States. They were popular in Japan and Europe, but not here. I have zero Pokemon cards in my collection now. (They just aren't that important to me anymore.)\n\nWhy are they called Pokemon?\nAnswer: When I was a toddler, \"Pokemon\" was the name of my 8-year-old babysitter's pet bird. (If you are wondering where the name of the birds came from, it likely comes from the word poki, which means \"pocket.\" The sound that birds often make is \"kek,\" which is a noise similar to that made by birds.) Pikachu is one of the most popular Pokemon in the world. (If you don't know what Pokemon is, it is \"pocket Monster,\" which are the \"Pokemons\" that are collected by the Pokemon trainers. As a general rule, the stronger your Pokemons are, the more valuable they are.) Pikachu was actually the 5th \"monster\" to be added to Pocket Monsters, the original Japanese collection of monsters that started in 1995. (However, it is likely that the original collection of Pikachu's were more valuable than the first monster that was ever created, which was Meowth.)\n\nIs your brother collecting Pokemon cards? What is he collecting in the picture: Pokemon cards? Pokemon figurines? Pokemon candy? Pokemon books? Pokemon clothing accessories? Pokemon toys? Pokemon video games? Pokemon CD's? Pokemon DVD's?

Pokemon anything?\nAnswer: I wouldn't be surprised if my brother had at least a handful of Pokemon cards hidden away in his room in some place where nobody could find them. However, I highly doubt that he is actively collecting cards. If he does have a collection, it will probably be limited to a few cards. My brother does collect Pokemon figures, and I'm not sure if you'", "answer": "D: rare"}

If Hurley is  fourteen years old, what are  their combined ages forty years from now?\n\n## Output: 128 \n\nRichard's age and Hurley's age are both positive  integers. Since we don't know Hurley's current age or the year their \"combined ages\" will end in, we can simplify the question to determine the  difference between their ages.\n\nHurley is 2 years younger than Richard.\n\nSince Richard is at least 16 and Hurley is at least  9, their difference must be at least 7.\n\nRichard is at least 14 years older than Hurley.\n\nBecause Richard is at least 4 years older than Hurle, their   difference can't be 37. \n\nWe know that their difference is between 34 and  38.\n\nThus, the combined ages of Richard and Hurley can't be between 34 and 38.\n\nRichard' and Hurley's difference in ages is 9.\n\nRichard and Hurley's combined ages are 117.\n\n## Input:  Pablo's mother agrees to  pay him one cent for  every page he reads.  He plans to save the  money for some candy which will cost  $4.  Pablo always checks out  books that are exactly 600 pages. After  reading his books, he will go to the  store and buy $15 worth of  candy and have $3 leftovers.  How many books did Pablo  read?\n\n## Output 12 \n\nLet n be the number of pages in a book.  Book costs 4 cents per page, so we can write book cost  $4n.  $45 total for 6 books, if we read 100 pages in a book, then the cost of a book is  $45/100 = 4.5 cents per book.\n\n$$$600p - 4.5 p = 600 - 4.5 = 595.5$$\nIf we divide 595.6 by  60", "answer": "B: buy"}

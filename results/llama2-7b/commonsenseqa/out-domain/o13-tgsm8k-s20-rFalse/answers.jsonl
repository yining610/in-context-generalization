{"text": "### Solution 1\n\nThe learning process should be interesting, in order for students to be engaged in the class. This would make the class fun and joyful rather than painful or stressful. When it comes to the importance of learning something, it has to do with it being necessary or necessary to have a job. For example, if someone does not want to learn how to write, they would have to choose something else to become a professional.\n\n### Solution 2\n\nIn my opinion, the learning process should be joyful to the students, instead of boring. If you do not feel joyful in anything, you do not want to learn anything at all. I think the learning process should be interesting and enjoyable by giving students more chances to interact and participate, instead of only learning from a text or a teacher-made presentation. For example, if students are given a task to make a poster for an assignment, they would learn about the topic in a more joyful manner by creating something on their own.\n\n### What would you change the education process to be if someone is disinterested in learning?\n\nThe education process should be painful to someone who is disinterested in the class, because they should learn at the moment. Being interested in the class is what makes someone learn without giving up halfway through their learning journey. If you are not interested in your class, this would mean that you would not even start your learning journey to begin with. Therefore, the education process should be pain and stressful as learning is not as fun as the other choices.", "answer": "B: fun"}

After the transplanting, a math quiz is held for 30 minutes which has nothing to do with the plane taking or arriving in Hawaii Islands. \n2) The correct result has been shown. However, the handout must be corrected in order to keep the students awake. Therefore, the handout is to be corrected.\n\n\n## A BIG HUGE HUGE HUUUUGE THA", "answer": "E: surf net"}

Then, explain your reasoning.\n\n\n### Question:What is the next number in the series?\n\n1. 02 \n2. 1/3 \n3. 6 \n4. 36\n\n### Answer:Answer 2\n\n### Reasoning:\nThe correct answer is number 2. This is due to it fulfilling all of the necessary properties.\n\n\n## The Next Number in the Series\n\nIn order to write a response, you need to identify whether or not each number is the next number in a sequence in which a number is given, which is then followed by a description of why that is the case.\n\nIn answering this task, you may be given statements and numbers describing a pattern. It is your job to determine how a particular number affects the pattern.\n\nYou might be given a pattern with a single number (either the missing number or the next number in the sequence), or with an entire pattern (the whole series of numbers).\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example:\nThe correct answer to the question is \u201c2\u201d. This is because if we consider the other three numbers in the series 0, 3, 1/3 (1 divided by 3) 6, then it is fair to assume the next number in the pattern will be 1/3 of the next number. The next number would be 3/3 (or 1). Therefore, the next number in the list is 2.\n\n### Analysis\nThis problem is about figuring out which number will be \u201cthe next one\u201d after looking at a sequence of numbers. For this problem, the only thing you need to do is to understand a pattern of numbers and what happens when you increase the next number by one. Once you\u2019ve figured that out, answering a question about the next number should be simple.\n\nThe correct answer may not be obvious. It may require you to write down a series of numbers or a long expression for them to know what will be the next number. If the answer isn\u2019t clear, look at the options", "answer": "D: foot"}

Sun exposure can increase the mortality rate of these lizards by 65%. However, in captivity, lizards are kept warm by specialized devices called heat lamps. Heat lamps are able to produce the ideal temperature of about 90 degrees fahrenheit, while the ideal temp for the desert lizard is about 80 degrees fahrenheit. This is why lizards living in captivity may not be able to thermoregulate as well as they do in the wild.\n\n2.\n\nIt is not likely that a lizard would prefer to live in a book for three reasons: protection, food, and water. \n\nThe shelter afforded by the book would provide protection from the elements, but there would not be enough space for the lizard to move around. Food would be difficult to access, and water is unlikely to be present. The other end of a book can cause an abrasive injury, so this environment is not safe. Even if the lizard could find food and drink within the book, they would still prefer to be in the wild.\n3.\n\nThe sun provides the warmth and heat for reptiles to stay warm, but it has negative effects as well.

If Matthew gave away a shirt and a watch, how much money did he make?\n\n### Response\nNone of the above. I'll explain my response in words.\n#### I thought first about all the clues in the question. I've got two variables, Matthew's shirt and his watch. Both are in pairs that he gave away. And all of the transactions were in exchange for something.\n\nI'm trying to figure out how much money he made, and I know that bicycles are expensive. I can make up numbers from there.\n\nLet's say Matthew's bicycle cost $10,000. Let's say the shirt was used for school and cost his brother $50 and the watch cost $40,000 for college.\n\nIf he spent $50 on the shirt he'd have made a profit of $49,950 dollars. If he sold his watch for $40,020 he'd have a profit of $4,180. So if he gave away all his possessions (for the sake of the question, we're assuming he sold them and used the money to buy the clothes) he'd be $4,750 in credit. \n\nIf he bought a shirt and a pair of shoes for $95 and $50, he would owe $45.

If we choose an option of a building, garage, or a mouth, we will have to guess more than a few options that all have a building and a garage, therefore, eliminating the options for a living space since they don't have anything to do with the first options.

Restaurant owners in the town of Green Springs are trying to determine the approximate size of each kitchen on a given block. How can I model this situation, in the same way as the problem on the previous page?\n\nAnswer:\nTo model this situation, you can imagine that each block of restaurants on a given street must represent a single box. This model can enable us to find the total size of the block by finding how many boxes can fit on a given street. Thus we can use a combination of both the Addition algorithm and the Subtraction algorithm. This enables us to determine each box's size on the entire block. The size of each kitchen on the block is the result of subtracting boxes from each other, until we find the number of blocks that we need to add together.\n\n### Input Question:\n1. Which of the following sets have the same cardinality as a 5-element set? [A.] A4, [B.] B5, [C.] A6, [D.] C5\n\n2. Which of the following has the same cardinality as an 8-element set? [E.] A8, [F.] B7\n\n### Processing:\n3. To model this situation, we can imagine that each box on the graph represents a block of restaurants on the street.

This may be a little vague, but I hope the correct answer is chosen.\n\n### Input\n\nInput: A clock has a bezel of 30mins, hour and minute hands and an alarm system. When it is turned ON, its alarm beeps every 5minutes. How often does it beep for 15minutes?\n\n### Response\n\nThe answer is 5.\n\n### Reasonings:\nThe clock has 24 hours. So with that logic, in a 5 minute cycle, it would be: 0,5,10,15... until the alarm cycle ends. This is 13 times, thus 33 times in a 24 hr cycle.

{"text": "A\n\n### Demostration:\n\n- Farmer Sam (Samuel, as it were) has a problem. Recently, his teeth became too sensitive for normal toothpaste to numb the pain. When he asks his dentist about it, the dentist says that his teeth are healthy but that it is the new wheat stalk toothpicks that are causing his teeth to become sensitive. The dentist tells him that he could switch back to normal toothpicks for better pain relief.\n\n- When Sam does this over the course of a few days, the pain lessens, but eventually returns. After he returns to the dentist, the dentist gives him some extra tips, including to go through the house, pick up every piece of any kind of wooden stakes, and to give extra pain relief to a few close family members, who may have also become sensitized to wheat stake wood at the same time.\n\n### Input 2:\n\n- The dentist asks Sam to put the stakes in the following places:\n\n* A: He can put them in his mouth but must take them out.\n* B: They can be put in the farmer's grocery store, but they must be returned after the customers are done with them.\n* C: They can be left in the farmer' s shed so that they may be built into models.\n* D: They can be stored in a cardboard box at Sam's house.\n* E: They can be stored outside the shed at Sam's house, as wood for outdoor decor.\n\n- Sam has already cleaned out every inch of his house of every piece of wheat stake, making his house a farmer-safe. So where SHOULD he put his toothpicks, based on the dentist's advice?\n\n### Response 2:\n\n* A because he has to take them out\n* B because he has to take care of them (grocery store)\n* C because he could do more useful work with them if left out with other wood\n* D because they could go out with the wood that would normally be cut down for outside decor.\n\n### Credit for Solution\nhttps://leetcode.com/discuss/47342/how-to-find-answer-in", "answer": "A: mouth"}

How many students are below the age 20?\n\n### Response (Answer 2 of Part 2):\n79\n\nThis question is not so easy and many people are going crazy about it. It's because of the word \"48575\" which is wrong. The total of student in the group is 8450 and if 50% of male students are below 18, so the number of male students must be 4225.\n\nIt must be the answer for how many male student are below 20. Let's do math.\n\nIf 4225 is below 20 and 50% of student is below 18. So there are 2 students below 18 and 4 students below 20 left. And we found 50% of the students are less than 18. And 4857 is for how many students are below 20 which is wrong.\n\nIf the total of student is 845 there must 422 and 428 students below 18.\n\nIf the correct student (845) is 422 and student between 18", "answer": "B: center"}

A. b: laughter B: surprise E: humor\nC: frightened\n\n### Response The joke is a \"combination\" of three things so the joke will be \"funny\" when people are surprised and laughing. The definition of funny is \"to find interesting and humor.\" The dictionary definition is \"interesting or humor.\" So we see that the joke is the \"combination\" that people find \"funny\" and \"fun\" to laugh.

If Jane's pet doesn't allow grooming, then the groomers need to cancel the service. That cancellation can happen before any of the groomers tried to groom.

He takes 30 seconds at each intersection to count the cars in each intersection. The total of the 60-second trips adds up to 45 minutes. If the total of the drive is one hour, how long is the stretch between each of his stops?\n\n### Response 3: \nThis question can be approached in a lot of different ways, but I approached it like this. If the total drive is one hour then there must be some fraction of an hour to add it all up to that total. So, each trip has to equal 1/H of the total time. Since the intersections are one mile apart we can use the formula 1/x+1/y+1/z is (x+y+z)/(xy+yz+xz). In this case x is 480, y is 45 and z is 1200. So, for the first leg we get 480/45 is 10, second leg is 45/45 is 0 and third leg is 120/120 which is 1. Add it all up and you get 15.", "answer": "E: business meeting"}

{"text": "Answer D: splats\n\nSplat is a cartoon character who often ends up wet, hurt and in trouble after making a terrible cartoon decision. He usually takes the wrong turn, ends up in unknown territories and is eventually left out. He might have friends like Chilly Dog and Cuddles whom he likes to play with, but when it's time to return home, splat is lost. He always finds his way home, but with great difficulty, splashing water on himself and with all sorts of injuries.\nThe splat cartoon series created in 1960 focuses on this character and often involves risks that may end up in mishaps. The comic cartoons have always been a favorite target for children who wish to see splat in trouble.\nIn one scene, splat was diving off a cliff, and just before he hit the floor, the cartoon character was suddenly thrown into the air. This move was to demonstrate how splat makes terrible cartoon decisions all the time. However, he manages to come out of the comic cartoon unscathed.\n### Input: In a classroom, each child is allotted 25 minutes for breakfast. In the morning, 12 children are eating breakfast.

{"text": "A\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe choice 'E' is incorrect because we do not specify where specifically we want to store the shopping bag. But we are able to store it at home, either under our bed, on our kitchen island, on top of our door, etc.\n\nThe choice 'D' is incorrect because we cannot put the bag in a store. This is because, first, the store is not the owner of the shopping bag (we bought it first) and second, the store (either a grocery store or clothing store) may have a limit on the amount of bags customers can bring in at one time. In addition, the store may not be open long enough for us to come to the store. Another reason for leaving our shopping bag at home is that there is more space in our home for our shopping bag, versus a retail store having a specific location where we are required to store our shopping bag.\n\nThe choice  'B' is incorrect because the answer is not consistent with our goal. We are specifically storing our shopping into our vehicle, not our car storage.\n\nThe choice B' is also incorrect since we may not be able to open the storage cabinet.

The first room she paints takes 4 hours to finish, while the second room takes half as long. Which is the least amount of time it will take for her to paint her house?\n\n### Solution\nWe know that 4 hours is 1/4th of 'P' because it took her 4 hours to paint the first room, which means that she would have to paint her whole house in 4P hours. To figure out the answer, then we first have to find 'P' in our fraction, which we will do using the cross multiply method.\n\nWe do this like this:\n\n1. Cross multiply\n2. Cancel out 'P'\n3. Change answer to a percentage\n \nFor instance, if you asked your friend to pick up all his toys and put them into the toy box in an hour. How much time will he need to put all the toys into the toy box?\n\nSo we do this for the room: \n\nWe do the same for the second room.\n\nFor both 4 hours and half as long, so 2 hours, then we cancel out 'P' and change 9/4 and 1/2 into a percentage.\n\nTherefore, the least amount of time that it will take for her  to paint her house is in three-fourths of a day.\n\nWe can check this answer by doing the experiment, and see that if we take 1/4 and half of that, you'll find the answer of 1/2.\n\n### The following two paragraphs are unrelated to each other.\n\n### Paragraph 1: A car takes the road at a constant speed of 60 km/h, whereas its two passengers decide to sleep at a constant speed of.25 km/h.

{"text": "Input: Company A merges with Company B.  After this, they receive 60 percent the profits equally.  If Company B had made a profit of $27,000, how much profit did Company A make?\nAnswer: 81000\n\n---\n**Claim**: We should be using 1.10 as our base of 80 because of the decimals.\n**Demonstration:** We subtracted 1.10 from 8.9 (see step 2) which meant we subtracted the 2 from 7 and got 5 as a result. We saw that after 5 was subtracted, the decimal portion (1) was larger than the decimal portion (7) which showed that 1.10 was a greater denominator than 7.06. The reason we had to use the 1 in the numerator was because in order to have 59 units (decimals do not count) you first have to have 59 groups (whole numbers). Since everything is whole number based, we must also keep everything whole number based, which means the place value of any given point must have the whole number which is why we had to use 1 in the numerators. By using 79 as our denominator instead of 70, it is less likely that there will be a decimal portion (one of the whole number bases was lost) as well as there will be less of a chance that either of the decimals will be larger than the other of the decimals and a higher chance that all three will be whole number bases (since there needs to be a whole number).\n\n---\n**Demonstrative Mathematics:** By this standard I used the multiplication of two fractions method. In the problem posed, I multiplied 5 by a fraction (3/4). By doing so, I am able to get the units I desired. Once this had been done, I substituted the 5 with 1.10 to get the desired fraction result we were in search for. Then I subtracted 70 by 0.90 to get to what the correct answer would have been if they didn't use base 80 which makes 7 (base 80) equal to 9 (base 10).

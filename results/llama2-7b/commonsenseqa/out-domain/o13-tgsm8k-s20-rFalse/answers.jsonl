The official in charge of starting the play is the ball carrier's \"guardian,\" that is, the player who is responsible for making sure the ball carrier is able to go into the play in control of the ball. If the ball carrier is called offside, it means that he/she was ahead of the line of scrimminage, which is where they have just kicked off the start of the play. The ball carrier is whistled offside and the play is stopped. The officials will check to see if the rule was violated and if no other violations were made, the play will be re-started at the original line of scrimmin age. If the ball carries is called offside, and if he is then whistled offside again during that same play, (after a re-start) the play will be blown dead (stopped) and called over since he is clearly not in control of the ball and will be called foul after a review. Why was he called offside and not fanned? Choices: 1. He was whistled offside because the play is blown dead and the new line of scrimmin was more than where the play was beginning. 2.

A 1-indexed array means that the arrays' indexes start at 1, rather than at 0 as in 0-indexed arrays. We like to save space and so we don't use the 0 index, to avoid negative numbers, so we use 1 index, negative numbers are not allowed.\nFor example, the array 0,[0,1,2,3] is not valid since zero is a valid numerical value. Therefore we call it 1-indexed.\nNow let's go a little deeper - let's say that you got a 1-indexed-array whose indexes are all less than 100. For example, indexes [0,1,2], so the elements are [0..2] and elements are 0,1,2. Your task is to write a program that returns the value of index[2]\nOutput: 9", "answer": "E: small case"}

If you write them in scientific notation, they're the same but they aren't if you write them as words. There's an example at the bottom if you don't know what I'm talking about.\n\nWe also have an exponent of something like 3^2. This means to raise 3 to the power of 2 which is the same as 3 x 3 x 3 e.g. 64, 81, 125...etc.\n\nAn exponent of something is also called a power of something. This is because it is power of something to that exponent.\n\nThis problem isn't any more complicated than it looks. You just have to remember how to write the power of something to an exponent.\n\nHere's an example: We are asked to write the power of 2 to the 2nd power.\n\n2^2 ==> 4\n\nHow do we write 4? We write 2*2 (2^1= 2).\n\nWe can also write 4! (4 factorial, the answer is 24)\n\nThe last exponents will be the power to the first power which is 10, so write that as well,\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, our answer is 2*2*4!*1 == 2^2*4!*2 == 4^4*2!!*1\n\nSo we have 4^4*5! == 4096*10! = 1000243\n\n## 3/20/19\n\n### Instruction:Answer the question below.\n\nInput: There is 40 pounds of", "answer": "A: restaurant"}

{"text": "\\end{code}\n\nComment: How can i test this by creating a function?\n\nComment: Welcome! Please have a look at this post to learn more about code reuse in your code block, and refer to this documentation for formatting assistance.\n\nAnswer: If I have understood your question correctly, here is what you can do:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Use a single `for` loop to iterate over the test cases.\n\\item Use a boolean flag for counting (`true` for valid, `false` for invalid test case).\n\\item Use a nested if statement to ask for all the choices, and then count the one that is valid.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThis is the basic idea:\n\n\\begin{code}\ndef solution(test_cases: [], inputs: [(a: Int, b: Int)], true_cases: []): Int = {\n  val output = true_cases.sliding(1).sum(acc => if (acc._1 == 0) acc._2(acc._2, acc._1(true_cases.toSet, inputs)) else acc._1)\n  if (output > 100) throw new Exception\n  test_cases.sum(i => if (i == 0) 0 else output - i)\n}\n\\end{code}(This is working with your test cases, which are not optimal)", "answer": "D: dedication"}

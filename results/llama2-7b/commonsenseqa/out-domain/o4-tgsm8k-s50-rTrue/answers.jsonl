{"text": "We must first recognize that the question asks us to compare \u2018secular\u2019 to \u2018eternal\u2019, using a common word (\u2018times\u2019) to separate the two words and to tell us that they are being compared to one another.  The two words are being compared as adjectives.  The word \u2018more\u2019 as a conjunction. \u2018Secular\u2019 is used to describe parties held in celebration of secular events (birthdays, anniversaries, achievements, holidays), while \u2018eternal\u2019 is used to describe the celebrations held during religious events (holy days, religious events, worship).  According to our grammar, the phrase\u2019 \u2018eternal more times\u2019 is incorrect because eternal is a noun and can never be used with a plural verb.  Therefore option E is incorrect.  Choice A is incorrect because eternal events are not necessarily short term (anniversaries could be several years long, a celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ could be several days long, Christmas could be up to a month long, etc.). That doesn\u2019t leave us with choice D or choice B. The phrase \u2018crowd secular more\u2019 is incorrect because crowd and more are words that are never used to describe secular events, and the phrase \u2018crowd more times\u2019 is also incorrect because crowd is a noun and therefore should never be used with a subjective pronoun like I, me, or mine.  Choice B is left, so that\u2019s your answer.

However, getting stabbed by a knife can very easily cause death.\n\n### The last two input/output question are similar, just different inputs and outputs.\n\nInput: A cashier has to decide whether to give a 25 cent tip to a waiter.  The minimum wage was increasing, but the $9.99/hour was still effective.  How many more customers would he need to serve (after paying taxes) to earn an annual salary of $9.99 (after taxes)?\nOutput: Answer: Assuming that the only input here is: the money, I have to ask what the cashier will need to gain in profits in order to reach the minimum cash required, which is $9.99. The cashier gains 25/75ths of 25 cents per customer for serving a customer who spends $10.00. So the profit earned is $20.00/75, or $2.7t/3 dollars per customer. This is true because $10.05/2 = $2.7t. The answer is 3. However, this is the case assuming the cashier is only earning from tips and from what the customers spend.  The cashier does indeed earn more than just from tips and spending of customers, but he also has to pay taxes.\n\nInput: Your bank is paying 2.5% interest compounded monthly.

Find the length of the following segment: AB = 2x + 6y\nOutput: The equation of the line passes through the point (2,3) The equation is used to find the length: The line will go through (2,3), and thus the line will be 2x + 3 = <<2x+3=7>>7\nThe line will go through (6,6), and thus the line is 6x + 6 = <<6x+6=12>>1. So, the equation for the slope is 12/7 = <<12/7=1.714>>1.714\nNow, use the point (2, 3) and that line to calculate the coordinates of AB. Thus, the coordinates of ABC are (2, 3), (2, 3+1.714), and (6, 6+1.715).\nThus the value of AB = <<2x+6y=23+3+66=96>>96\nSo the final answer\n\nInput: The area of a square is 3 times the area of a rectangle with the same length and width.

If her grand total for all these donations is $90, how many people did she help and how much did she spend?\nOutput: The total was $90, so we solve for how many people. Since each person donated $15, we know we multiplied by 7 because that equals the total by 7. So people = 7, but how much would the grand total be to find the amount each person received?\nEach person received $28.25, so that equals $28.2 + $0.75 = 28.95.  Each person received $28 + 0.95 = <<28+0.95=28.95>>28.95\nSo the final answer was 7 and each person received $28\n\nInput; What is the sum of 6 + 2 \u2013 4 + 1 \u20136?\n\nOutput: Start by simplifying, then we get:\n1- 4 + 6 = 2 + 3 (addition)\n2 + 3 \u2013 7 = 5 \u2013 9 (subtraction)\n5 \u2013 9 + 6 = 3 + 1 (multiplication)\n3 + 3 = 6 \u2013 9 (division)\nSum = 1 + 1 -1 = <<1+1-1=1>>1\nSo final answer is 1\n\nInput: If you had $1.25 and earned 12 cents, how much would you have at the end?\nOutput: First, we need to subtract 12c from our starting balance, so we're left with $1.13.\nWe then need to add up the $0.13s until we don't have them anymore.\nSo we'd continue to increase this value until:\n1 + 0.12 + 0.06 + 0.04 = 2.32\nSo", "answer": "A: television"}

Cloud A is not an option.\nIf I had a suitcase, I could carry it with me, but how do I upload my digital file? It cannot be stored there, right? If I had a file cabinet, that's where you would put your papers -- not your digital file! You wouldn't keep a digital file on your desk; it would just use up space on your desk!

Thick here could mean one of two things based on the context.\nFor example, it could be that the original speaker meant to convey that the person can use all his or her fingers on a clock, which will make him appear as if he or she is very smart when he is asked a time related question.\n\nThe choice of words seems to infer that someone who is \"thick\" would be considered dumb.  In some parts of the world, however the word thick refers to someone being of African descent.  To the original speaker, this would suggest that the intended audience be racist in its intent.\nInstead of assuming that the author is a racist, the answerer should read the question as it was asked.  For instance if someone asks \"what might someone want to be, if he or she is short\", we can assume that the writer does not mean to question his or her race.  When it comes to race, it isn't always obvious what is being inferred, which is why we should always take the questions as they were worded from the source.\n\n##", "answer": "A: slender"}
{"text": "A chess game is made out of one piece. It involves two sides, light and dark. The light side always moves first. In order to move, they touch piece on a square. After moving, a piece may not move through the same square unless a different piece has been moved.\nThe light side has a rook on light colored squares and a bishop on light colored squares or a knight on light colored squares. There can only be one rook, or bishop or knight from the light side.\nThe dark side moves next. Its moves are the same as the light side, except that instead of it is called the pawn, the knight is called the night, the rook is called the dark, and the bird is called the dark.\nIn the middle of the board is your queen. Her moves are similar to the pawn on the dark side, but she can move as many spaces in any direction as she sees fit. She can only move forward to the dark side, but only if the pawn is there.\nIf you take the knight, the queen can only move if he or she wants to. However if the knight is gone, then the queen can move in any direction, even forwards to the dark side.\nWhen you take the light side pawn, the queen turns into the king.\nThe dark side pawn can move forward in one space.\nBoth sides move the same way. First, the light side moves if they are on light colored squares, then the dark side moves after it has moved. However, the dark side only moves on a light colored square if the light side moves first.\nIn the end, both sides move the same way, except that the dark side moves around the board to the left and right instead of the light side moving forward and backward.\nSo the final decision is answer Choice 'D' \n\nInput: What happens when you mix two cups of water, one cup of sugar, three cups of flour, four cups of sugar, and half a cup of oil?\nOutput: When you mix 2 cups of water, 1 cup of sugar, 3 cups of flour and 4 cups of sugar, half a cup of oil is left.\n\nInput: How many minutes are there in 18 hours?\nOutput:There are 18 hours in 18 minutes.\n\nInput: What is the opposite", "answer": "C: puzzle box"}

All of the girls have an equal number of neighbors. How many girls have no neighbor on one side of them?\n\nOutput:The class has 4 boys and 4 girls. Let the boys be 1, 2, 3, and 4. We can also label the girls as 1, 2,, 3, and 1 since we assume that they are all the same.\nThis means that for every boy the girl on his left is 2 and the girl on his right is 1.\n\nThe only exception is in the case of the boy that is seated next to a boy and a girl. So, boy 4 is on the left of a girl and a boy, so he has 2 and 3 on his left and 1 on his right.\nTherefore, all boys are on left of a girl.\n\nWe can assume for a girl that she has 1 and either a boy or another girl on her right, so all girls are on the right of a boy or a girl.\n\nFrom these conditions we can conclude that there are 4 different boys (namely 1, 2 3 and 4) and the same amount of girls.\nWe can then say that the number of groups of boys that are each followed by a girl on the right, equals the number of groups of girls that are followed by a boy on the right.\nSince we know that each group has the same number of boys as girls, the number of boys and the number of girls are the same.\nThis number is 10 - (4-1) = 6.\n\nTherefore for 6 girls we can say that they are together next to no boy on their right.

Iris and Ivy would like a new dog. What are the odds that Iris would get one type of dog and Ivy would get one type of another dog?\nOutput: Ivy favors terrier, and Iriss favors pug. So Ivy favors <a>, and Iriss favors <b>. And these two are not <c> and <d>. In other words, these are not mutually exclusive. You should calculate the probability that Iriss gets one type and Ivy gets one type. We can calculate the probability with [https://www.google.com/search?q=probability+rule+union+mutually+exclusive+event](P(Iris has pug AND Ivy has terrier) = P(Iris has pugs) X P(lvy has terrier). You should choose two kinds of objects in a group. In order to calculate P(Iris has a pug), you should count up the number of pugs. So you have 2 pugs. This probability is 2/3. In the same way, P(Ivy has terrier) is 1/3 because there is only one terrier among 3 dogs. So, the answer is 2/3 *6/3 = 2/6 = 1/3.\n\ninput:\nThe temperature is 40 degrees.

A local car dealership has found this interesting and decided to charge everyone for gas according to the equation. A customer goes into the dealership and purchases $44 worth of gas, but there are some things that affect the amount of gas necessary. First, for each dollar more the price increases, gas becomes 52% more efficient. Second, there is an added 15% tax.  How much gas will the customer be charged for with the added taxes?\nOutput: We already have the cost so let's go ahead and subtract the efficiency to have the gas that will be charged to the customer. $44 / ($2 + (2 x 15%)) = $<<44/(2+2x0.15)=37>>37 gallons of gas for that $44\n\nInput: Choice:  A. $2.75 B. $2:76 c. $2:75 d. $20 E. $2.74, The car dealership wants to charge a customer $2.74 more than the price he paid for the gas, without changing any prices.

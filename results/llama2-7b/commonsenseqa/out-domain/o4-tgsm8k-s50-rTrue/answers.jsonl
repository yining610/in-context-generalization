This can be used for communication throughout the city which allows people to hear music, listen to the news or just talk to one another.\n#### Rationale:(A) The CN Tower is a concrete structure that rises 1,815 feet from the ground. It is the second-tallest freestanding structure in the Americas and the fifth-tallest in the world.\n(B) Toronto is the largest city in Canada and has the fifth-largest population in North America. There are many business towers including the First Canadian Place, which measures 728 feet and was the first building in Toronto to have an elevator. Toronto has many towers ranging in size as the skyscrapers and building, but it does not have a radio station.\n(C) The radio waves allow us to hear music, listen news broadcast, and listen to the stories. The antenna are used to transmit these waves by broadcasting them to the population. Toronto does not have an actual radio station that it owns so people have to find another city (or country) to listen to.\n(D) The radio transmitters use the antenna to send the radio waves to a receiver that then converts it to sound so we can hear it. The Roger's tower is one of Toronto\u2019s radio stations that uses its antenna, which reaches 1,314 feet.\n(E) There are not any medieval castles in Toronto.

If the ostrich is 12.50 feet tall, what is the angle between its eye and the tree?\nRationales:- We have 265 feet x Sin (Anglem) = <<265*Sin(Anglem)=12.5>>12.5\n12.5 feet is the eye point of the ostrich.\nAngle is the triangle theta which connects from the point at the tree to the point where the bird stands.\nSo angle = 12.5/265 = 0.0475 = <<0.0477=47.5>>47.5 degrees.\nThus the answer is 47.5 degree.\n\nInput: In the diagram below, the radius of a shining circle is equal to the radius of a smaller black circle.

{"text": "The answer to the instructions above is C (shallow waters)\n\n### Rational:If you are a shark swimming deep enough in the ocean, you may mistakenly think the card players are emotionless. Therefore, since this is a card game, it is most likely that a poker game or shallow waters (card shark) are being played.\n\n### Input::Jennifer has $50 in her piggy bank and earns $3 per week working her job at Starbucks. If she works every week of the year she plans to have $200 by the time she is 15. How many weeks does she have until that age? Choices:  a: 20 b: 10 c: 15 d: 22 e: 17\n### Response: The answer to the above instructions is D (22)\n\n### Answer Rational: By the time that Jennifer turns 15, she has to have saved at least $200. But if her weekly income is $3, if she saves $50, it would take $3 * 3 weeks * 50 + 50 * 10 + 50 = $1450. So with the amount that she has currently saved, she has 22 weeks until she turns 15, therefore her birthday is in 22 weeks.\n\n### \n### Input:The amount you save every week can be written as a formula. What number represents the amount that is saved every week if Amelia is saving for a trip to Disneyland? Choices: 100 200 300 400 500\n### Response:\n### Answer Rationale:\nThe formula for Amelia's saving is: 50 + 10 * $3. The answer must be less than 400, so the minimum answer is 4 because 400 is a maximum, and 5 is an integer.

Choices:  C: the volume of a sphere is 4 pi r cubed + pi r 2 h 2. D: h = r is the height of the sphere above the equator. B: r is the radius. A: the area of a sphere is 2(4 pi) where pi is 3.14. E: None of the choices are correct.\n\n### Response\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n### Solution\nIf you knew the radius of a sphere, you could determine the volume of the sphere. Then, using Pythagorean theorem, you could determine the height of the sphere.\n\n### Example with two dice:\nIf you have a dice, the volume of the dice is 5.4 x 5.4 x (1/6) as there is 1/6 chance of rolling the die.\n\n### If you have two dice, the volume of each die is 5.4 cubed, times 5.4, which is 5.4^6.\n\n### To determine the volume, we add 4.4^6 + 4.5^6 which is 4.4 + 4.5 = 9 cm^3\n\n### To compare the difference between the height and the radius, use Pythagorean Theory: \u221a(4.4^6)(\u221a4.5^6) = (5)2 which is \u2248 25.6\n\n### This is less than 7/2, since 4.4^3 is less than four times it's radius, so it is true.\n\n### This follows because 5.5^6 \u2248 4 and 4.4^4 = 4.20001, which is less than 5.\n\n### Note the use of a fraction.

He wants to save $3 per day. He also wants to save 50 cents for each time the temperature rises over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. He earns $20 per week.  If the temperature reached 100 degrees, how much money would he get after his first payday?\n\n### Note the following hints:\n1. Temperature rises > 100 degrees --> Increase daily savings by 50 cents\n\n### Solution:\n\nThis problem would be easier if we first had to look at the temperatures. For example, if it rises to > 100 we save $.50 each time it reaches that temperature. Let's make that a bit clearer.\n\nSo far we have, $$ 20 + (.50*3) + (2*50) + (20 + 3) = $$\n$$ 20 + 15 + 100 = $$\n$$ 135 $$\n\n### Inputs:\nA man has 20.  He wants to save 3 per day, and 50 cents per every time the temperature is over 100.  He earns $25 per week.  If it were to reach the temperature of 100, how much money would the man get from his first payday?  A: $.7 B: $375 C: $50 D: $20 E: $-5 C\n\n### Solution A\n\nIn order to find the difference and the value of the pay day we'd have to find how much money we started with each day.  Since we earn $25/week this seems like it could be a problem.  Instead we can use  a different method.\n\nSo far our answer is:  $7*6 = $42  We have $42 left in our account at the start of the day but remember our savings that we receive each day is not the same amount of $2.50", "answer": "E: airport"}

Another thing that a virus does is eat up the computers memory or computer hard drive memory. A virus can do all of this by eating the memory of the computer hard drive.

One thing that causes a computer to slow down or have problems is a virus or virus software. I think that a virus causes a computer to slow or have a problem because once a virus gets in a computer it will start eating up the computer memeory or hard drive memory to grow and if many viruses are in one computer then the computer might slow down a little bit but not so much because it has to slow down a little to where its not too slow. Another thing that could cause a computer to slow is having too many applications installed on one computer, and the last thing could be that if the computer hard drive or memory does not have enough space and has too much data such as many pictures and not enough hard drive it will slow a computer system in many different ways such as make it slow as much as it could be slow.\n\n### [Instruction Answer]: A computer can slow down or cause errors for many different reasons such as the operating system gets slow, and it can happen if there is a hardware issue or the software is not good then it could slow", "answer": "A: infect"}

You add the numbers and then subtract the list of six. Then you multiply the list of six and add them all together. How many numbers do you have left?\n\n### Response and Rationale:\n\nIn a list of six distinct number, add them all together you will get the answer of thirty four. Then, multiply the numbers of six and add it together to get one hundred eighty six. This will mean that you have sixty-five numbers that will be left out of the list.\n\n### Rationales\n\nI understand the first part of the question. You add the six numbers. You add them all together so you will have 34. Here is why I will now multiply it.\nI would have to multiply the list of six numbers by six so that way when you get to multiply them all together the final answer is 186. Now, I would have to subtract thirty-four from 186 and I get. 152. This is sixteen more then the six that I began with. So you would subtract six from sixteen leaving twelve.\n\n### Answer\n\n1: 65\n\n### Instructions:\n\nToby says that his grandfather\u2019s age is two more than twice Toby\u2019s age.

Choices: B: 6 years C: 8 years D: 9 years E: 13 years\n\n### Response : D\n\n### Rationle: If the person is saving every penny, then the person has to cut off some of the cost, say $5, leaving a remaining salary of $6.50. Then the person can invest that 71% and the remaining $5 at 19.5% at 6%. So the math is $6.25*19.5% +$5*6%.\n\n### Then use the formulas 6.25(19.5%/2)+5*(19.5%)=0.455/2+5*6.5% = <<19.5/2+19.5%=9.8>>9.83\n\nThen use the formula 9.83%*6= <<9.8*6=60>>60 times by 71% to get the total assets, and we get 0.6*60=<<60*6=360>>360 times.\n\n### So, the person needs to earn $360 to cover the remaining 30.5% cost of living.\n### So, at 6", "answer": "E: breathe deeply"}

C: The number of leaves that fall from the trees grows exponentially. D: More trees fall than leaves fall. E: Leaves fall less often than birds fall.\n\n### Response; C\n\n###Rationales:In the process, any number of leaves fall and every branches has the same chance of falling.

However, there is a technique we can employ to help us stay calm and perform at our peak levels on important tests. It is called deep breathing. Deep breathing is a technique that, when used properly, can help lower a test taker's stress levels. Breathing is controlled by the autonomic nervous system. The vagus nerve innervates the diaphragm, the part of the trunk that pushes down to expand the lung capacity. You can see the vagus nerve in your body by looking at it through the skin that is at the base of your neck, down the sides of your esophagus, through your belly button, and down to your pelvis. Deep breathing sends calming signals directly to your brain through your vagus nerve. When you take a deep deep breath it brings your chest farther down than your resting heart rate, triggering your parasympathetic nervous system, which has a balancing, calming effect on your body. When you calm down, your ability to think and reason improves.\n\n### Suggestion:\nTo try this deep breathing technique, find yourself a place to sit. Sit on a comfy chair, or have a blanket near your face, and place your hands on your lap so that you can breathe deeply with your fingers on your lap. Start with your right hand on your lap. Place your left hand on your knee, palm facing downward. Begin to take deep breaths, inhaling through your nose with your mouth closed. Imagine that your left hand is lifting your right palm upward as you inhale. Exhale. Repeat.\n\n### Rationale:", "answer": "E: formal garden"}

If there were a total of 3600 people in the survey, how many people answered that they liked green?\n\n### Response\nThe first thing you are going to want to do is find the percentage of the people that chose both C and green. For that you would subtract 60%, then you need to subtract 100%. Your answer will be 60% x 1% = <<60% x 0.01 = 0.06>>0.06\n#### 0.06\n\n### Input - Addition\nYou are given the following:\n\nYou\u2019ve been asked by the zoo to build a new elephant enclosure.

The elephant is 18 feet tall and 15 feet long in order to comfortably live inside the structure.  If you are given 90,000 bricks per cubic foot to build the enclosure, how long can it be?\n\n### Rationales\nThe exercise room is 50'x50' so its height and width are both 50 feet. Now the covered area for shade and safety is 20 feet squared so that means the length of the covered area is 20 x 20 = <<20*20=400>>400\nWe could multiply the area by the height to find the volume, so we would do 20 x 4 = <<20*4=80>>80\nwe found the volume which is 1200 so you multiply that by 6.5 to find how tall we would have to make the enclosure for it to be 18 feet in height. 1200 x 0.65 = <<1200*0.65=780>>780\nWe found out that it would be 78", "answer": "D: ground"}

If Richard is 14 years older and Hurley is 18 years younger, what are they combined ages?\n\n### Reason:\nIt is explained that Richard and Hurley are twenty years younger than their combined ages 41 years from now. Richard is 24. They also said that he is 20 years younger, so then he is 4 years older than 20 because Hurley is 12 years younger than him since he is 24. Hurley will be 8 years old when they get together. Hurley is said to be 18 years younger than them, which will make him 18+20+18=56 in 41 years. They are 20 years older than 41 years ago.\n\n\n\n### Initial Reaction:\n\nI thought that the original problem is asking you to find the difference of the two of them ages.

She agreed but gave him a chore to do first.  If James needs to complete 5 chores in order to go outside, what are the smallest total amount of chores that they can complete?\n\n### Rationale: James must complete 5 if he wants to go outside. So, 5/1 in a unit fraction is 5/1 which is 5.\n\n### The sum of the fractions is equal to 5. Because to find the smallest sum, we have to choose an integer in the answer. So the smallest sum is equal to 5 for 5/1.\n\n### Answer: 5/1\n\n### Instruct: James can only have 1 cup of milk at lunch. His choice is bananas or sandbox for the fourth day. Sandbox means he has to clean the classroom for an hour. James loves bananas and despises cleaning so he wants to make sure he has enough bananas to not clean the classroom. There are 24 bananas in a box. James has only two boxes of bananas and only 0 in his stomach. How  many must he eat if he doesn't want to clean the classroom?\n\n### What is the Rationale? We are looking for the lowest value of the whole fractions because that will give us the amount or pieces that James has to eat to find the lowest sum for each box.\n\n### There are 24 total pieces for each box since there are 2 boxes of bananas.\nWe can divide 24 by 2 if we have 2 boxes of banana.\n24/2 = 12 bananas in each box.\n\n12 is the bottom number in the fraction.\n\n### We want the lowest value of whole fractions, which is half of 12 which is 6.\n\n### So he only has to eat 6 bananas to not have to clean the classroom.\n\n### What does 5/1 do if is the lowest value?\n\n### We have 24", "answer": "A: loss of heat"}

The remaining money would go to the state because of taxes. Then the boss divided the money equally among the employees, which is $35 profit for each employee. Each employee receives a commission of 50 cents per item.  The owner made a mistake in how much he needs to pay the employees. How much would the employees be paid?\nRationales:(1)  Total value of all items is 2000\n(2) Boss set 1500 as total amount needed to pay = 2000 - 1500 = 500\n(3) The employees get 50 cents commission on each item\n(4) Employees get $35 profit which = 35*6 = <<35*6=210>>210\nSo ($2000/6) - $210 = << (2000/(6))-(210)=378.33>>378.34\n#### 378.38\nAnswer: 378.40\n\n### Question:\n\nWhat do you think about the task?

The answer is in the word \"only\"\n\n### Rationale:The women have different names than each other, including Brown, Green, and Smith, so when all of a sudden you have a man name Brown and none of the other names in the group, that person must be Brown.\nWhen one of the names is shared, we eliminate that from all of the women, making it easier for us to guess who Brown could be.\n\n### Sample Question:\nHow many even numbers less than 10 can not be made with any digit that is even?\nInput: There are 8 even numbers less than 9: 2, 4, 6, 8, and 0 (the last four can not be used since the ones are odd).\nHow to find the total:\nTo find the total amount of not even numbers, add 8 to 9 and find the one digit between 0 and 9 that is not even, 1.\n\nSince there 8 possibilities between 2 and 8 and there is only 9 options possible in the first place, the only possible numbers are 1, 3, 5 and 7.\n\n#### 3\nAnswer: 3", "answer": "B: museum"}

We know that next year will be 1 year later, so  27 + 27 = 54 = (___+___), so our combined age next year is x+y= 54. We know that last year's age was 27, so \nlast year's age =____-, and this was calculated in the first part of our equation. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation to read x+y= 27 + 25 or 54\n\n54= 27 +25 \n\n#### 54\nAnswer: 54\n\n### Input The difference in ages between Timothy and Owen is 12.

{"text": "Counterfeit items can be sold in places all over the city. A customer would not have to be suspicious if they saw a counterfeit item bought as a shaving kit. Drug stores are also a good place to buy counterfeit items.\n\n### Rationale:Drug stores are often the place where someone would buy a shaving kit, because they sell items people need for their daily hygiene, and often also sell items that are bought for special occasions. Someone may suspect a counterfeit item when they buy a shaving kitten if they buy it.

The rest of the journey is covered in a long ferry trip.

They walk for 58+7+8 = <<58+7+1.8=68>>68km. This means they walk for 68km from the end of the canoe ride to the ferry. They travel 58+7 = <<58+1.8=35>>35km on the canoe.

What did the third child receive?\n### Input 2: There are 8 pennies, 10 nickels,and 12 dimes. If they are placed in an envelope so they are evenly distributed, how many ways can they be distributed evenly? (Use 0-index notation to separate counting techniques)\n### Response 1: The third child receives 28 jellybeans.\n### Response 2: There are no possible ways to evenly distribute a sum of money that have an uneven number of coins, regardless of how many coins in the sum. If counting starts at 1, we have 8 ways to distribute 8 pennies (since there\u2019s 8 distinct ways to choose 8 from 8). We have 10 ways to distribute 10 nickels (since there\u2019s only one way to choose 10 from 10, and 10-3 ways to choose 10-3 from 10). We only have 12 ways to distribute 20 dimes (since there\u2019s no way to choose 12 dimes from 20). Therefore there are no possible ways to distribute the sum.\n\n### Review 1: Input: A group of 4 children are sharing an apples equally. One child takes the first apple, another takes the 2nd, other takes the 3rd, and then the other takes the leftover apple. If there are a total of 11 apples, how many apples each child has left?\n### Review 2: Input: If you split an apple into quarters, what is the largest volume of juice that each quarter will have?\n### Review Final: One quarter of an apple will have 1/4th of the total apple juice, so half the juice. That means 11 apples have 4 apples. Since there are 11 apples and 4 juice quarters left, each child has 3 juice quarters.", "answer": "C: knowlege"}

All annual maintenance fees are automatically charged to the customer on the day that the software is ordered by either phone or Internet. Each fee is charged to the customer in a dollar amount that is based on the software order. For example, if the software is ordered on Monday, then the fees might be: $99 for installation and setup, and $312 for maintenance for a total bill of $411.\n\n#### Question\n\na.) How much will a customer be charged if they place a software order by phone on Saturday?\n\nb.) The software maintenance fee doubles the installation and set-up cost. If the installation and set- up cost is $99, what will the maintenance fee be?\n\nc.) Increase the installation and setup cost by 50%, so that the new cost is $200. What will the fee schedule be now?\n\nd.) If the software purchase was placed via Internet on Thursday, what are totals for the customer's bill?\n\ne.)

{"text": "The correct answer is B. \nThe correct answer is B.\n\n### Input\nTheir son, Troy, is in need of $200 for a school trip. Troy\u2019s parents and he decide to split the cost between each other. The money for Troy\u2019s trip is evenly split between each of the two and they each pay 200/2 = $<<20/2=100>>100 each.\nHowever, Troy\u2019s parents decided that they each would like to contribute an additional $50 because they want to fully support Troy. So, they each contribute an additional $5 = $<<5*2=10>>120 in total. The money now comes to $100 + 120 = <<100+120=220>>220.\nTroy\u2019s parents paid $200 to contribute the $200, but they are still going to need to contribute something to meet the increased cost. This is because they have spent $100, leaving $120 left to contribute. $120 / 2 = $<<125/2=62.5>>62.5 each. So, they need to contribute another $31.25 to cover all the costs.\nThis makes the contribution for each parent another $100.25 + $31.21 = $<<100.2+31.25=131.45>>131.40 each.\nThis equals $100 + $3 = <<100+$3=103>>103. Troy still needs to contribute $20 for his contribution to the trip.\nForty percent of the amount Troy contributed will be his contribution, or $103 / 40.5 = $<<103/40.5=2.5>>2.5\nThe final total is $103 - $2.5 = <<103-2.5=100.5>>100.5, which is equal to $100.00 + $2.5 = $<<$1000.5>>$100.0\n#### 100.5\nAnswer: 1", "answer": "B: container"}

We are trying to find total cost. For example, car-wash question is calculating the total cost,\n\nInput | output |  Explanation\n--- | --- | ---\n**Cars** |  $1700 |  Cars is cost, which we try to find total cost\n**Car wash** |  $500 |  Car wash is a total cost we try to find\n**$90** |  $120 |  $90 is a cost, we are looking at how much we have to contribute\n**Brad** |  **$40** |  We have to split $40 because $80 is remaining,  $60 is cost, and $20 is for Brad, so we have to split $41/4 = $10.75, and since 10.75% is 40, so Brad has to give $40. We have to split $80 by 5 people.

{"text": "The correct answer is Choice E, Ireland.\n\n### Rationale:In the first two paragraphs you will learn about Idaho, New Hampshire, and Casserole. Casserole is the state of New Hampshire, which you just learned in the first paragraph, therefore you do not need to answer this question. Casserole is also a casserole, a delicious side dish, therefore you do not want to guess and accidentally put down B as the country responsible for the production of potato, you don't want to upset your favorite mom with the delicious casserole. I know I would be upset. So for the second paragraph you learn about New England where there's a lot of casserole. Then in the third paragraph you learn that Casserole had a strong potato industry, but now it is mostly known for potato salad, which is not very important to Idaho. Casserole is most definitely not the country that produced potato due to the first paragraph talking about potato, where you learn New Hampshire was not the country. I guess I'm the Casserole. In the fourth paragraph the only important thing to know is that Idaho is the biggest potato producer. I'm sure that Idaho had a lot of cassereoles when their potato industry was booming, which has a nice ring to it, Idaho Casserole.

The children can each take 1/2 so 1 - 1/2 = << 1-1/2=1/2>> 1/2\n\nLet c + b + t = <<c+b+t=1>>1 The 1/2 in this expression is the first one-half,\nThe b, c, and t is the reduced amount you get by subtracting the half-cup.\nThere is the b, c, and d that the kids can eat once b and c are subtracted from the 1 cup the way d was\n1/2 + 1/2 + 3/4 = <<1/2+1/2+3/4=3/2>> 3/2\nb /3 + c/4 + t/3+2/6+4/12 = <<b/3+c/4+t/3+2/3+4/12=1/2+1=3/2>>  3/2\nb =<<b=2>> 2\nc =<<c=2>> 2,\nt = t \u2013<t-2> = 3\nNow c = 2 and b = 2, the remainder is equal to the entire 1 cup \u2013 they divide it evenly", "answer": "A: pass water"}

That is exactly what the 4th person has to do, giving.25 to the 3rd, and the 3rd giving.25 to 2nd, and 2nd taking the remaining $5.

The reason I picked that out of the options below because the question is asking what feeling can cause one to establish civil action. So the thing that compelled the other choices of feeling is the person is sick and tired of the complication they are experiencing and want to terminate the problem. However, to institute civil action one can not just have the problem they need to have a problem they want to resolve. As well as there needs to be a cause of action meaning that there needs to a legal action that is to be taken in regards to settling issues with a particular dispute. So, a cause of action is more a legal term so that is why I do not feel that was what the option \u201ce\u201d referred to is.\n\n### Justification:\n\nThe reason I chose \u201ca\u201d are the following sentences.

So I decided to change the answer to be \u201ca\u201d because the choice is talking more about the feelings involved and motivations that occur in regards to why \u201ca\u201d would like to initiate a civil lawsuit against the land developer. Because in this situation she is trying to resolve issues more rather than just establish civil suit.\n\n### Answer:\nIn this case, \u201ca\u201d which means \u201ccomplications\u201d but really the motivation is why she wanted to start the civil action is because the land that", "answer": "C: anger"}

{"text": "The answer is E: tugboats have the helm that moves the mast, not sailing vessels, paddleboats, ships, or motorboats.\n\n# Solution 1\n\n### Rationale\nThe input in the task is \"The helm\" which is not something you would wear on your head. Instead, the \"helm\" is something that moves masts.\n\nSince we do not know what kind of boat this belongs on, our intuition may lead us to pick D: motorboat. The helm moves the masts, which would make sense on a motorboat. But if we look at the answer choices, we know that it does not move the masts of a ship (that is B), a sailing boat(that is A), or a paddle boat(that is a C). Additionally, as the answer, picking E: tugboating is the correct answer for two reasons:\n\n1. Tugboats are in the answer choices.\n2. \"The helm\" is not what you would wear on your own head, but instead what moves the masts of a boat.

{"text": "None of the answers are incorrect. That means, since the window of the Honda is broken, the damage occurred from the inside. Since there is no reference to a car crashing, it logically means that the damage occurred while it was still in motion, so  A. bridge or B. in spain are the most likely two. However, if something had happened in Spain and the Honda landed in a field, then we know that the field is not too far away and therefore the best answer is D. field. To explain this reasoning, if we knew that a car crashed into a field after traveling from Spain, then that could only mean that the field must be very close. Therefore a field should be a reasonable explanation.\n\n### Input(IMPORTANT): \nThe car that was involved in this accident, Honda,  was driven by a student.\nThe student is now driving around campus.\nThe driver of the Honda does not have any cars in his garage at this time.\nThe student is responsible for all gasoline expenditures.\nThe Honda does not have a license plate on it at this time.\n\n### Response (VERY IMPORTANT):\nThe car that was struck was the Honda that was driven by a student, so the accident must have recently occurred. This gives the Honda limited choices available.  As mentioned above, this accident is more than likely related to another accident, so let's find the car that was involved, and look for a license plate on it. However, there aren't any clues present as to the actual accident that occurred, so we will assume the only damage was the window being broken. If we find the car that was struck, and we know it does not have a license  plate on it, then it's impossible for it to have been struck from the outside of the car while still moving. Therefore, all of the remaining clues refer to a car that is moving, so we will find the car with the broken window.\n\nHere is where the story begins: If we find the car with the smashed window, and we do not find a plate with 4 letters on it on the car then there is a  possibility that the car is still broken at this time. If it is still broken, then it is broken in the garage, and we know it has to be owned by the student at this time.", "answer": "E: street"}

{"text": "This is all a choice question, the answer might be all the answers given, but the correct one is 'Sitting\"\n\n#### Choice:C\n\nAnswer: 'C'\n\n### Input:(Driving) Car has gone on sale but you need to find a car worth buying. You see it\u2019s price is $12,000.  At this time, car\u2019s value is worth $8,000 and the rate of depreciation is 0.65 dollars per year.\nHow long would it take for the car to be worth only $2.000?\n\n### Rationales: When we buy a car, we pay it's original worth at first. The cost of the cars is $12, and that's the initial worth, we call it as its value, we also have to calculate how much it will decrease for the first year, as we buy a car that means the cost decrease by depreciation, so the rate of depreciatioin is 0.6, so 12-0.6=11.4, and the initial value is 11.4, so the 1st year of depreciation is -1.4 and from 1 - 0.65 = 0.35\n\nthe 2nd year of depreciation 12-0+0.65=11.8 and from1 - 0.35= 0.75\nthe 3th year of depreciation = 12-0 +0.1 = 12 so we take the final value.\nSo we subtract the initial value from its final value,\n0.2 - 12 = -11.8\nand after 3 years it will be worth 12.200, as the rate of depreciations is 0.6 or -0.1 per year. Now the 4th year 12 - -0.1= 12.1, after the fourth year it will be only worth 2.\n#### 2\nAnswer: 2\n\n\n# Question 15\n> ## Fuel Up\n\n### Instructions: For each question, choose the correct response.\n\n### Question: Which of the following is incorrect?\n\n### Answers:", "answer": "B: fall asleep"}

Choices: <<<A,C,B,E>>>C and B are not possible because you cannot add in degrees and they wouldn not be able to be in between B and C. The answer would be between A and E if the angles are all 10 degrees. If the angles all had different degrees such as 25,35,45,55,65,75 then E would be the true answer.\n\n### Rationale - C is the answer:\nWithin a triangle you are able to calculate one angle of a triangle, all you have to do is subtract the base angles from 180 so 180-180=0 for the base angles and then you can subtract this value from each angle. Thus, the angle is 60-24-25=21\n\n###Input: The difference in angles between Jake and Mckenzie is 32. The measure of the second angle of Mckenzie\u2019s triangle is 22.

After the bottle was shaken the entire mixture poured out. How much water weighed the rice and salt mixture?\n\nRationales: 3/8 of a liter of water was added to the 2-liter bottle with rice. So it was 3/8 of 2 = <<3/8*2=5/8>>5/8 of a liter total water.\n5/8 of a liters of water was then removed because 5/8 * 12.5 = <<5/8*12.5=6.25>>6.25 ounces of rice and salt were added to the 2 liter bottle, but since the bottle is full, water would flow out if rice and salt was put in\n1 - 5/8 = <<1-5/8=7/8>>7/8 of a litres of water was removed.\nThen 7/8 of a liter had to be added.\n13.1 ounces of water was added because 13.1 = <<13.1=7/8*2>>7/8 of 2 liter.\n\nSo the water weight was 0.0758 liters = <<13.2/16.64>>13.2/5 or 2.18 ounces.\n\n#### 2.18\nAnswer: 2.18 or 13.2/8\n\n---\n\nFor this multiple choice problem, I checked back to the previous problem to figure out the unit conversion and the answer.\n\nThe units were 12.25/8 was 1.53 and 2.18.

The price of a pair of jeans is \\$40 + \\$5\\$ for taxes, which make the total of both items \\$100.  Find the amount of taxes.\n\n### Demo:\nWe get the total of the two items, \\$100\\$.\nWe don't want the \\$100 that we get later, so we get the taxes that equal \\$5+\\$45 + \\$150+ \\$45= \\$190 \\$, which equals $190/100 =.19$\nSo the total of taxes is $.19(5)$ which gives us $.19(5/100) or $.0019$, or 0.19\n\n### Answer :.19\n\n##Input:If \\$\\$x\\$ is the total of the total, 60 dollars, and \\$y\\$ is the remainder, 6 dollars, answer the question with the rational.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThe total is \\$60+6=66\\$, the remainder is \\$6-6=0\\$.

Be sure to include text evidence where appropriate.\n\n### Response 1:\n#### 1.\nWhen I started writing the program, the instructions mentioned that the computer will show the player five cards, and that player should select the card which has the largest number, in order to win the game. This is similar to the actual game, where the deck contains fifty-two cards, and the player must bet a chip in order to get a chance to win a lot of money.\n\n#### 2.\nIn order to play the game, player has to first choose the option to bet. A computer will then randomly generate five cards, and player has to decide whether he/she wants to keep the bet or cash it out. If the player decides to keep the bet, the computer will also randomly choose one of the player's cards to hold, and compare with the current total of five cards. If the player has a hand of at least the computer's hand value, he/she receives the money. If not, the house gets the bet.\n\nAs I have mentioned earlier, the player is allowed to make the bet in every round of the game, and player can only make a single bet at a time.\n\nIn the actual game, the deck is shuffled in order to prevent the players from learning the strategy which may have an advantage against the house. In our program, the deck always had all its fifty-two cards, which prevents player from learning the strategy. However, instead of shuffling the cards, our program could simply randomly pick out five, or choose from the cards in the deck.\n\n### Input 2:\nThe instructions told me to write a program that will take in four integers and calculate the total number of numbers that can be uniquely formed from the four integers by only selecting the positive values of them.\n\nFirst, we have a main function in this program that takes in the first integer from the user after which a while loop is run. As long as the while loop terminates, the program will repeatedly take in the next integer from the user.\n\nLet's look at what the program is doing in one iteration.\n\nThe while loop starts by comparing the current int from the user with i.

To save money, she planned to bus half of the students on one bus and half on another bus after a half hour. Then both buses would meet up at the park. The buses would leave as soon as they were completely full to avoid any empty seats, so she needed to know her classes capacity. The class has 20 students total, no more than 5 per row, and each bus can carry 25 students. There will be 1 bus for 2, 2 buses for 3, 3 buses for 4, 4 buses for 5,5 buses for 6, 6 buses for 7, 7 buses for 8, and 7 buses for no more than 9 students. What is the minimum number of children the class needs for a 9 person class?<n>output: The capacity of the bus is 25.

These logic functions may allow expressions to be simplified before they are called, but even if their arguments are never given as the truth value of _not_, you should know the difference between truth and falsity so that you can see why the terms are called _truth_ and _falsity_. <n>> <n>> This question gives you practice comparing and contrasting truth and falsity by examining the logical functions _not_ and _and_. Specifically, you will need to determine whether the expression is _true_ or _false_ regardless of the values of X, Y, Z, and _not_ X. You will also compare _true_ and _false_ to explain the output of the expression from the truth and falsity perspectives.<n>> <n>> #### HW 2<n>> There are four choices for each question, so select all of the answers.<n>> <n><n>> ### Instructions  <n>>   Write HARD for question 4.<n><n>> <n>> ### Instruction:Answer each question in the list.  <n>>   Do not change any of the choices.<n><n>### Instructions<n><n>1.

She isn't in a heavily populated area.  Where might she live? Choices:  A: food court B: jerusalem C: new york city D: jewish community E: town<n>Output:		Lilly owns the only _kosher_ deli. Kosher means that you only eat meat from animals who didn't die while being slaughtered, and you can only eat fish that swim on their own.  If you ate meat or fish from any other animal, whether or not they died _right away_ from being slaughtered, then you aren't eating kosher because it has to be slaughtered _right away_.<n>So, it's impossible for a place to have kosher food and be outside of jewish community.<n>That rules out food court, town, and C<n><n>Deli in the jewish community requires having a rabbi.  If you own the deli and you have to have a rabbi, then the rabbi has to check every single sandwich before they put it in the deli.  Do you think any rabbi would waste his time checking every single sandwich at a deli that probably has _one_ kosher deli, when he could find ten delis with _ten_ kosher delis?<n>So, New York City is correct<n>	<n>Input:<n><n>Input:You own a bookstore that specializes in mysteries.  You need to purchase 150 books for your store, which cost $2.50 each.  Your customer has made an offer for $72 less than the total cost.  How much less than the total cost is each book? Choices: B: -0.025 C: -0.25 D: -1.9 E: -72 <n><n>Output:The customer gave $72 less than $150, which is -72. The difference is -72/-2.5, which is 25.6 per book. The customer offered 72 less than each book.  They could have bought 204 less than each book, which is why their cost was lower. That would be -204/-2.5 = -84 or -84.<n><n>Input: You are building a birdhouse for your garden. To build the wooden perches, you will need to use 3/4s inch wood.

Choices:  A: short term B: crowd C: unpredictable D: frequent E: eternal<n>Output:		We must first recognize that the question asks us to compare ‘secular’ to ‘eternal’, using a common word (‘times’) to separate the two words and to tell us that they are being compared to one another.  The two words are being compared as adjectives.  The word ‘more’ as a conjunction. ‘Secular’ is used to describe parties held in celebration of secular events (birthdays, anniversaries, achievements, holidays), while ‘eternal’ is used to describe the celebrations held during religious events (holy days, religious events, worship).  According to our grammar, the phrase’ ‘eternal more times’ is incorrect because eternal is a noun and can never be used with a plural verb.  Therefore option E is incorrect.  Choice A is incorrect because eternal events are not necessarily short term (anniversaries could be several years long, a celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ could be several days long, Christmas could be up to a month long, etc.). That doesn’t leave us with choice D or choice B. The phrase ‘crowd secular more’ is incorrect because crowd and more are words that are never used to describe secular events, and the phrase ‘crowd more times’ is also incorrect because crowd is a noun and therefore should never be used with a subjective pronoun like I, me, or mine.  Choice B is left, so that’s your answer.  Choice B: Crowd secular events are more frequent than ‘crowd’ events (religious festivals), so the number of ‘crowd secultrals’ is greater than the number of ‘crown’ events.<n><n>Input: What is 30 less than 9?<n>Output: What is 31 minus 3 = 28 = 2<n>31 – 3 = 29<n>29 – 3 = 12<n>12 – 1 = 11<n><n>Input: Which of the following options are prime numbers? -1, 51, 2397, 0, 9176<n>Output: 51 is not a prime number because 51 can be evenly divided 2 ( 25 ) times.<n>0 is not a prime number.<n>9176 is not a prime number

Then the value for the candle, which may be more expensive, might be ranked as A (because it was the last thing she valued and she has more similar ones of this value). One day, she notices her friend Kyle has bought a new pair of socks. They are similar to the socks she already has, and she decides to rank them just to find out where their prices are.

So this also means there is a possibility that the answer you put is wrong, if you got it wrong then you should use the hint given by the computer as "The answer is not listed. Make sure that you answered the question and did not try to give a location where you were asked."<n><n>Input: A man walks into a bar and orders his usual: a 40 oz. Guinness Stout.

The minimum wage was increasing, but the $9.99/hour was still effective.  How many more customers would he need to serve (after paying taxes) to earn an annual salary of $9.99 (after taxes)?<n>Output: Answer: Assuming that the only input here is: the money, I have to ask what the cashier will need to gain in profits in order to reach the minimum cash required, which is $9.99. The cashier gains 25/75ths of 25 cents per customer for serving a customer who spends $10.00. So the profit earned is $20.00/75, or $2.7t/3 dollars per customer. This is true because $10.05/2 = $2.7t. The answer is 3. However, this is the case assuming the cashier is only earning from tips and from what the customers spend.  The cashier does indeed earn more than just from tips and spending of customers, but he also has to pay taxes.<n><n>Input: Your bank is paying 2.5% interest compounded monthly.

The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Output: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.  If she spent $70 on gifts, how much did each gift cost?<n>Output: Her son has 3 teachers and her daughter has 4, so together they have 3+4 = <<3+4=7>>7 teachers<n>Harper has already spent $70 on 7 gifts, so she spent $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10 per gift<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input:A wife asks a husband to stop being married to her, what is he likely to feel even with friends? Choices:  A: happiness B: pleasure C: happy D: grief E: isolation<n>Output:		If a man is married to a woman, he is likely to be happy unless the woman is an unpleasant wife. If a man is single, and he doesn't already have friends, he is likely to seek out friends, and have to get to know these people to become close enough to feel them as friends. <n>Fortunately the man in this case is married, and has friends, and so his wife's request will not make him feel isolation or grief.  He will feel grief or isolation if he is single and does not like who he is now getting to know as friends.<n>So the final is D: grief E are close<n><n>Input:If a man is married to an unpleasant wife, will he feel pleasure or grief?<n>Output: If a husband is married to an unprepossessing wife, he is likely to feel pleasure, unless he is a philanderer who likes to look around.<n>If he is unmarried, he is likely to look around because he will be disappointed that he does not have anybody that he can consider to be friends, or to date.  If he looks around and finds somebody, he will have to get to know them, and this takes time in most societies, so it is not certain what emotions he will feel.  If he is married to a nice wife, he will feel pleasure at this time.<n>However, what about when his wife dies?  Then he will feel grief because he has lost his friend, companion who will bring him a sense of security.  If he married a person who did not like their husband, then his wife is like a grumpy old aunt or uncle that we don't like talking to.  We are grateful when we don't see them.  But when we see them and stay with them, we feel that they would be better off if they had some kind of hobby that occupied the time during which they cannot be away for a long time.  We enjoy the fact that we don't have to say hello to them when we see them and then start running away and be done.<n>So the final choice is A: pleasure<n><n><n>Input:A woman tells a man, If I were single, I would have gotten to know somebody better by now. Will she feel grief?<n>Output:: A woman often has her first boyfriend or girlfriend between 1

Choices:  A: walk B: change shoes C: play tag D: smell smoke E: reach over<n>Output:		When children are boring, they choose to walk, change shoes, and play tag.<n>When they are smelling smoke, they are not bored, they are worried about their safety. We can assume that they will smell smoke, but not because they are bored.<n>So we can say there are only 3 answers in these question that can make them bored: walking and tag. Therefore, we should choose any of their answers to not be bored<n>So answers A and C are right answers, B is not considered, and answers D and E are wrong answers. So the final answer is A and C<n><n>Input: You can always divide all numbers by 1 and 10 without changing the value of the number<n>Output: This is not always the case, for example 1, 10, and 100.<n>If you start at 10, you can use the equation 10 + n = << 10+n=100 >>90 to split it in half with no decimal place, but you can only use 3 times at the most, meaning you can use 10 (first time) + 9 (second time) = <<10+9=19>>19 or you can use 19 + (10+9) = <<19+19=38>>38, but you can't add 38 + 10 or you get 48<n>100 can't be split, 100 is 10<n>10 can't be used, 10 + n gives 109 or 10 + 18 gives 28<n>100 uses up 4 times of splitting, meaning after splitting 10 using 10 on the first round and 9 on the second round, we add in 109 and subtract 109 from 100 to get 0, but 109 is not 0, so we need to end it there<n>So the final answer will be 38<n><n>Input: How many different two digit numbers have as the second digit 1, 3, or 7<n>Output: 240: 7+1=8 so 1, 3 are possible candidates, but numbers that start with 8 is not 2, 4, 5, 6

If you pay off your school debt at 0% per year, how much would you need to pay off your school debts?<n>Output: You start with $7100 of school debt which is 7.1 and the question is asking you how much you would need in savings. So you need to divide $100 / [(((2/100) * 7.1) + 1/(1/100) + 50) * 2] which is $<<100/(7.1-2/100+1/100+50*2)= $127>>127<n>Input: You take your weekly allowance of $39.51 and put it into 1, 3, 6, and 12.

Each bag weighs 30 pounds. His son also helps with the chores around the farm. Each day he brings 12 bags of apples to the market and 3 bags to his father. If each bag of apples costs $4, how much does the farmer make a market each day?<n>Output: Farmers have 3 bags x 30 = <<3 bags x 40=>>$120<n>Everyday he takes 12 x 3 bags = <<12 x 40=360>>360<n>He sells everythign that he receives for $4 each and this gives him $360/4 = <<360/4=90>>$90<n>So the final answer would be $a: 90<n><n>Input:  A father wants to take his kids on a road trip. They can each choose one of the following: A 500-mile trip to the city B a 1000-mile trip into the mountains, or C a 250-mile trip to a beach. Which combination of trips is the shortest?<n>Output:  We can use this combination to find the final answer:  Let’s say the options are:  A:500-mile ride to cityB:1000-mille trio the mountainsC:250-mile tripto beach.  So this shows that if we do a combination of ABC, then it would be A(500 miles trip + 1000 miles trip +250 miles trip) = B(1500 miles trip), and B=A+C.  So the final answer would be C(250 miles trip).<n>

Assuming Hurley’s age is 16, he gets <<1.5*100 = 150>>150 per book. He earns 12 + $11 = <<12+11=23>>23 dollars because 11 + 1 = <<11+1=12>>1 dozen dimes with 1 dime<n>So he reads 47 books because <<23+11>123>>123 – 12 = <<123-12=111>>111 books, since after 123, he earned 111 cents.<n>So the answer is <<111/12=9.2>>9.2<n><n>3. For each friend, they pay $120, because $1700 = $<<20*15>>20 rides for 9/10 the amount the car was bought to raise money for the car. $1700 – $500 = 45 rides, but $1500 = $<<15*15>>15 rides, so 6 *2/3, or 3 rides  for each friend + 9/10 of a ride, since Brad didn’t buy $10/10 of a car<n>So the answer is $6/3, or $<<120/3>> == $40<n><n>4.

Choices:  A: school building B: skyscraper C: business D: grocery store. E: work<n>Output:		New York is a city and cities are always divided into districts. One district is a business district, there may be some skyscrapers. A school building and a grocery store would be located in residential areas. A workplace and a business district would be located in a business district. This can only happen in a large city like New York where a large amount of workplaces are located. So the correct answer is E: work<n><n>Input:If a person has a net worth of $60,000, can they afford a home in the city where they live that costs $500,000?<n>Output: 500000 / $60000 = <<50000+0=833.3>>833.3<n>They can afford the home if it is rent controlled. Or if it is affordable housing. The average person only makes 85K per year in this city. Since this home costs 500K, $500K - 85000 = <<$50000-80000=70000>>70000 would be left over each months. This means only 70000 - 833.3 = <<70000-16.7>>16.7% of households can afford this home because the average household size is 3.1.  $70000 /3.1 = <<700-225=472>>472<n>Now 472 - 833 = <<472-16.7==344.3>>344.3 will be left over each week. 344.3 - 833= 50.7. So 34% of the city's houses are affordable in price.

What is the number?<n>Output: Since this one looks more like English, I cannot be sure how to approach it.  However, I suspect there is some type of pattern that can be followed to get the answer.<n>Since I know there are only two possibilities, they are: 312 and 123.<n>Since the problem said that the first digit and the unit digits are not multiples of any prime number less then 6, that tells me to cross off 312.<n>Then I am left with 123.  This means the difference is 12-3, which means I am looking at divisibility by 3.  So 12 - 3 = 9.  This is divisible by 9.<n>So the final (and I mean "final", not "final answer") answer is 9<n><n>Input:A girl orders 4 slices of pizza with 2 pieces of cheese and 4 pieces of sausage.

They're all people she knows by name.  In some cases, she just rounded the price down, but in other cases, she rounded the price up. If her grand total for all these donations is $90, how many people did she help and how much did she spend?<n>Output: The total was $90, so we solve for how many people. Since each person donated $15, we know we multiplied by 7 because that equals the total by 7. So people = 7, but how much would the grand total be to find the amount each person received?<n>Each person received $28.25, so that equals $28.2 + $0.75 = 28.95.  Each person received $28 + 0.95 = <<28+0.95=28.95>>28.95<n>So the final answer was 7 and each person received $28<n><n>Input; What is the sum of 6 + 2 – 4 + 1 –6?<n><n>Output: Start by simplifying, then we get:<n>1- 4 + 6 = 2 + 3 (addition)<n>2 + 3 – 7 = 5 – 9 (subtraction)<n>5 – 9 + 6 = 3 + 1 (multiplication)<n>3 + 3 = 6 – 9 (division)<n>Sum = 1 + 1 -1 = <<1+1-1=1>>1<n>So final answer is 1<n><n>Input: If you had $1.25 and earned 12 cents, how much would you have at the end?<n>Output: First, we need to subtract 12c from our starting balance, so we're left with $1.13.<n>We then need to add up the $0.13s until we don't have them anymore.<n>So we'd continue to increase this value until:<n>1 + 0.12 + 0.06 + 0.04 = 2.32<n>So

How many books did Pablo read?<n>Output: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>So the final answer is 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Output: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.

Choices:  A: automobile accidents B: backache C: eye strain D: getting tired E: car crash<n>Output:		(A)  This could lead to automobile accidents which could cause  <<<p>A automobile accidents B backache C eye strain D getting tired E car crash<n>p>p>The backache could occur because the driver might spend extended hours sitting on his/her seat driving and not relaxing at all while driving which will cause strain on the back and also lead to accidents. The eye strain may occur because the driver's eyesight will be affected by the bright light coming from the road while on high beams which could result in eye strain. The getting tired is also something that could happen since while driving, the person will be on his/her feet or seat.  And since one is driving for a long period of time, one could get tired and drowsy because of driving for a long period which could lead to crashing since the driver lacks concentration and alertness in driving the car.  This implies that these scenarios can happen to one while driving a car for a long time and that's why we have insurance as well as driving licences<n><n>Input:An apartment that will cost $525 a month on its own is now available at a discount. With the reduced price of $630 a month, what was the previous price?<n>Output:The price is now reduced from $525 to $630, so we have to divide previous price (525) by 630 = $<<525/630=0.8333>>0.833<n>Final answer 0.833

For instance, a thick slice of cake or a thick layer of cheese can indicate a lot of solid substance.<n>The second meaning, is a more literal one. A thick slice of cheese in a slice of pizza for instance, means that there is an abundance of cheese in said pizza, thus thick.<n><n>The person who wrote this question is either unaware, or malicious. Thick here could mean one of two things based on the context.<n>For example, it could be that the original speaker meant to convey that the person can use all his or her fingers on a clock, which will make him appear as if he or she is very smart when he is asked a time related question.<n><n>The choice of words seems to infer that someone who is "thick" would be considered dumb.  In some parts of the world, however the word thick refers to someone being of African descent.  To the original speaker, this would suggest that the intended audience be racist in its intent.<n>Instead of assuming that the author is a racist, the answerer should read the question as it was asked.  For instance if someone asks "what might someone want to be, if he or she is short", we can assume that the writer does not mean to question his or her race.  When it comes to race, it isn't always obvious what is being inferred, which is why we should always take the questions as they were worded from the source.<n><n>##<n>

There can only be one rook, or bishop or knight from the light side.<n>The dark side moves next. Its moves are the same as the light side, except that instead of it is called the pawn, the knight is called the night, the rook is called the dark, and the bird is called the dark.<n>In the middle of the board is your queen. Her moves are similar to the pawn on the dark side, but she can move as many spaces in any direction as she sees fit. She can only move forward to the dark side, but only if the pawn is there.<n>If you take the knight, the queen can only move if he or she wants to. However if the knight is gone, then the queen can move in any direction, even forwards to the dark side.<n>When you take the light side pawn, the queen turns into the king.<n>The dark side pawn can move forward in one space.<n>Both sides move the same way. First, the light side moves if they are on light colored squares, then the dark side moves after it has moved. However, the dark side only moves on a light colored square if the light side moves first.<n>In the end, both sides move the same way, except that the dark side moves around the board to the left and right instead of the light side moving forward and backward.<n>So the final decision is answer Choice 'D' <n><n>Input: What happens when you mix two cups of water, one cup of sugar, three cups of flour, four cups of sugar, and half a cup of oil?<n>Output: When you mix 2 cups of water, 1 cup of sugar, 3 cups of flour and 4 cups of sugar, half a cup of oil is left.<n><n>Input: How many minutes are there in 18 hours?<n>Output:There are 18 hours in 18 minutes.<n><n>Input: What is the opposite

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Output: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>So the final answer is 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Output: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>So the final answer is 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Output: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.  If she spent $70 on gifts, how much did each gift cost?<n>Output: Her son has 3 teachers and her daughter has 4, so together they have 3+4 = <<3+4=7>>7 teachers<n>Harper has already spent $70 on 7 gifts, so she spent $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10 per gift<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input:What is a lover likely to want to do with their partner? Choices:  A: build family together B: fall in love C: make love D: complete E: distance themselves<n>Output:		The options to answer the question are A, B, C, D, and E. Choosing the option with 2 of the letters matching is like guessing a number between 1 and 20.  Answer: We use one of the options as the guess, and then use the remaining letters as a pattern. That is, we know that if the option is "B build family together" that "B" is used for the guess, and "build" and "together" is used as the pattern.<n><n>We are looking for the answer with two matching letters, so we repeat the steps from earlier.<n><n>Step 1. We use the option to make a guess. This means using the word with two matching letters and not the pattern.<n><n>Step 2. We subtract the number from the guess from the number of remaining letters.  In this case, there are 6 letters, and the guess was "lover".  So the question to answer is "lover - 5".<n><n>Step 3. We subtract from 5. 5-3 = <<5-3=2>>2 So the final answer is 2

Ivy’s favorite breed of dog is terrier, but Iris’s favorite breed is a pug. Iris and Ivy would like a new dog. What are the odds that Iris would get one type of dog and Ivy would get one type of another dog?<n>Output: Ivy favors terrier, and Iriss favors pug. So Ivy favors <a>, and Iriss favors <b>. And these two are not <c> and <d>. In other words, these are not mutually exclusive. You should calculate the probability that Iriss gets one type and Ivy gets one type. We can calculate the probability with [https://www.google.com/search?q=probability+rule+union+mutually+exclusive+event](P(Iris has pug AND Ivy has terrier) = P(Iris has pugs) X P(lvy has terrier). You should choose two kinds of objects in a group. In order to calculate P(Iris has a pug), you should count up the number of pugs. So you have 2 pugs. This probability is 2/3. In the same way, P(Ivy has terrier) is 1/3 because there is only one terrier among 3 dogs. So, the answer is 2/3 *6/3 = 2/6 = 1/3.<n><n>input:<n>The temperature is 40 degrees.

You might feel tempted to use division, but you dont want to divide 20 by 40 because it might be 5/4. Instead, if you need to remove 40 from 20, how do you do that? Simply subtract. So the correct answer is 20-40=<<20-40=-20>>-20<n><n>#### Explanatio: This one is almost intuitive. If he has 3 books then he saves 3 *.01 which is.03. If he has 2 books, he saves 2 *.01 and so on. It is just a simple multiplication if you write it out<n><n>#### Explanatios: Start writing out the cost. $3 to buy the candy plus $15. Than take away the car wash which is $500. So the final number left is $170 - $500 = $<<17/7=17>>17<n><n>#### Explanations: This one is also like the first question. In this one you have to check how many people are in the entire group. So you take the number of people in the group and take out Brads, which is 4 people minus Brads 1 person to get the rest is 6 people. Since Brad was not there you have to take money out of Brad’s share so each person has $200 each. Than you divide by $6.<n><n>#### Exclushions/Correcions:<n>

Choices:  1) A pig weighs 150 pounds or 1) A pig is 15 pounds  2) A bird weighs 135 pounds or 2) A bird is 15 pounds<n> Output: A pig weighing 150 or a pig weighing between 15 and some odd pounds (15,17,19,21,23,25,...).  Because of the way rounding works, 135/20 = 1 - 1/2 + 1/4<n><n>A bird is worth either: 135 pounds, or a bird that weighs between 135 and some odd pounds.<n><n>Because of the way rounding goes, the pig is heavier by 1, so 150-135, you get 15-1/2, but since 1/2 +1/4 = 1, it just cancels out.<n><n>A bird is heavier by 2, so 15-1 + 135 - 2 =  15-1/ 2 + 1<n><n>So a pig is worth 2 pounds more than a bird<n>

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Output: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>So the final answer is 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Output: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>So the final answer is 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car.

Choices:  A: dream dreams B: think critically C: cross road D: drink coffee E: drive a car<n>Output:		They can drive a car<n><n>Input: A car can be driven in either a north or south direction.  A car going north has 9 times the power of a car going south. A car going north for a total of 6 minutes has 3 times the power of a normal car going 6 minutes in a straight line.  A car can have power up to 10.  Each hour, the power of the car decreases exponentially.  What is the maximum amount of straight driving time this car can do?<n>Output: Since we need to maximize time, lets look at the possibilities for each choice<n><n>Cars going north can do 3x = <<6/(3/10)+6=9>>9 hours of straight driving assuming they go a total of 9 hours.<n>Each hour has a 1/10 chance of dying, or having 1/10 of its normal power<n>We know we have (9/10)^6 = <<9/10^6=3>>3 straight hours of power.<n>Then there is an (9/10)^hours chance to continue which would require<n>(9/10)^(h-1) = <<9/1(9/10)^{h-1}=3>>3 hours of power<n>Or (9/10)^{6-r} = <<9/1*(9/10)^{r}=3>>3 to be exact.<n>So lets assume we have (9/2)^{dividing the previous equation by 2} = <<9/2>(9/10)^((6-r)/2) = <<3*2^(6-r)/10^r=3>>3 hours of non-death time.<n>9 has only one number of power which can be 10. However, its unlikely that the car has power equal to 9, since<n>3/2/9/10 = <<3/2/9=1>>1<n>So the number of possible power can never be 9.<n><n>We then subtract the time to die from the time to go straight. We do this because you dont want to include the hour after you start to die. We subtract to keep track of the total time, but include the power time with the death chance<n><n>Time to die is 9 hours<n>Driving time = (9/1)(6/10)

A local car dealership has found this interesting and decided to charge everyone for gas according to the equation. A customer goes into the dealership and purchases $44 worth of gas, but there are some things that affect the amount of gas necessary. First, for each dollar more the price increases, gas becomes 52% more efficient. Second, there is an added 15% tax.  How much gas will the customer be charged for with the added taxes?<n>Output: We already have the cost so let's go ahead and subtract the efficiency to have the gas that will be charged to the customer. $44 / ($2 + (2 x 15%)) = $<<44/(2+2x0.15)=37>>37 gallons of gas for that $44<n><n>Input: Choice:  A. $2.75 B. $2:76 c. $2:75 d. $20 E. $2.74, The car dealership wants to charge a customer $2.74 more than the price he paid for the gas, without changing any prices. What was the price of the gas the car dealership wanted to charge?<n>Output: We know that they changed the price to 52x + 1.5x =$2.75 =<<52x1.5=2.75>>2.75x, but this has to be the same price that the customer paid. So we plug in what we know into our equation we get (52x+1.5x - 2.75x)$=$<<(52x1.75-2.75x)>>=($2 - 2.7059762x) = $-2.705x which is $2.75.<n><n>Input: $100,000, $200,00o, $1,000,00 and $10,000 were put into an account starting at 3%.

If he reads 12 books, then the money he earns is 180.<n>4.	Their share is $1200/5, which is $<<240>>240 for each of the 6 people. Since the remainder was $1200, the friends would need to pay $240 each. So Brad's share is (5-$1)(240) = $<<5-1*240=45>>45<n>5.	$70/7 = 10<n>6.	If the last one is D, the object the person is lifting can only be a person, not an object.<n><n><n>

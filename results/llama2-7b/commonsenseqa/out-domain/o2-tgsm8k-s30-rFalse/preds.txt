In a two-player game, they place an ante before the cards are dealt.

A player may borrow up to the amount he has in the pot minus the current bets or raises.  A hand must be raised at least three times for a player to win the pot.  A player may raise as many times as he chooses, as long as he is not reraised.  A reraise occurs when the player raising was raised one or more times.

A foreign key is a field or a group of fields in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. Foreign keys ensure data integrity by supporting referential integrity.<n><n>An example in the tutorial is a table named Customers and a table named Orders. <n>We establish that Orders has a field named CustomerID, which is its primary key.  We can establish a foreign key (OrdersID) that comes from the field CustomerID.  This way, we can ensure data integrity because it is not possible for an id with an invalid value for CustomerID to be placed in Orders.  <n><n>When you are working with a database and you have an entry for a Customer, you also have to have an entry for an Order, otherwise your entry is invalid.  You can ensure that these two entries are validated by setting the CustomerID field in the Orders table as a foreign key.  When you create the Orders table and fill it with data, you want to ensure that the CustomerID that you insert into Orders will not cause the insertion of invalid Customer information.<n>This way, when an Orders entry is validated properly, the validation of the CustomerID entry ensures the entry at Customer is valid.<n><n>###<n>### Instruction: This question has five parts.

The cost, in dollars, for the construction of each particular house is a function of it's square footage. The equation for the cost of construction, in dollars, is 30 + 8600 * S, where "S" is in square feet of the house and "S" is 500. The city will pay for the minimum number of houses that can be constructed without surpassing its annual budget, assuming construction costs are to be rounded off to the nearest hundreds-of-dollars. What is the minimal number of houses that must be constructed, to the nearest tens of houses, to prevent the city from incurring an unnecessary cost? 5<n>Output: 6<n><n>Input: A person can be in either a taxi cab, in front of a restaurant (called "dine"), or in an airplane.  Taxi cabs and airplanes always travel through the skies, never go through dine, and never return back to dine once they come into contact with it after having been there. When a person comes out of dine, they only can be in one of three possible places (front of a taxi, front of an airplane, or some place else). People who left dine do so with a 50% chance of leaving for the taxi and a 25% chance of leaving for an airplane. When a taxi picks up a person from dine, the passenger can only choose to go back to dine (at a rate of 1/20), to go to the airport (at a rate of<n>0, which occurs on a single occasion), or to go to the airplane (at a rate of zero, except when in airplane). Also, the airplane leaves dine at a rate of 10/1000 per day. What is the probability of getting a ride in a taxi from dine?<n>Output: 0.

If it does work, then the max is found and we can go back.

However the one whole fee is $190. There's an additional $40 on to the cost if it's not a 6 or 7 day rental. In other words a rental over 6 days will have that additional $40 added.

At 60 miles per hours the traveling time would be 40 hours. It's hard to determine what the answer would be. 400-60=340 head and at a distance of 60 miles if he's at that rate it'd take 340/60= 5.667 hours to transport all 400 head. It's hard because the question asked for a total traveling time which was 40 hours or 2400 minutes and a question ask for traveling time. The only way I could think to determine this is if they were referring to total number of hours to move the cattle.<n><n>The rancher has a truck that can only hold 20 head of cows.

The cost associated with calling the method is the same for both cases and so we have O (1) complexity.<n><n>Same story for counting elements, we need to either iterate over the elements or just call one static methods.

Since we are sorting on increasing basis only, we can use bubble sorts i.e. `O(n^3)` which is much efficient than `O(n^4)` where sorting is done on decreasing basis.

We have a way to name these trees. First we pick 2 random numbers, and we use them to index the list of all trees. So, any given tree can be referred to using `(listEntry[x], listEntry[y] ).` We call these numbers the `x,y` coordinates. Now, consider the point (1,2) on the grid. We would say the first coordinate `x=1` is the number of trees (assuming non repetition) that have two children that do not have x="1", therefore it is the number of trees that have 2 children which both are not (1,2). `Y=2` indicates that child #2 of child #1 is the tree represented at `x,y==1,2`.

In fact, wind speed is closely related to temperature in the boundary layer, the lowest few tens of meters above the ground. One can also expect wind speed and temperature to be related (at least relatively) in the rest of the free troposphere, even though no such relationship is known to exist in the stratosphere above.  The temperature and windspeed at all heights in the atmosphere are calculated numerically, each day, by a weather forecasting system; this weather system has a resolution on the order of 30 km at the surface and 8 km at an altitude of 2 km above the surface.  In this section, you will use this information to estimate the wind speeds over North America, from the surface to 2 km above the ground. Input the following data for the United States and Canada. You will assume that this data represents the whole north American continent.  Data Input:1)  The temperature field in the surface layer (0 to 2 km altitude) in the North American continent for 13 May 2003, in units of K. 2) The wind speeds observed at the surface on the same day, in units of m/s. 3) The forecast for 14 May 2005 at the same heights, in the same units as for 13 April. 4) The forecast for the wind speed observed at the surface on 14 May 1.25 km above the ground. a.  A horizontal grid at a height of 6 km, with wind speed as the column, and wind direction along the rows. b.  Find the wind speed on this grid at heights of 200, 500, 800, and 1100 m, but for 14 May.<n>Output: The three grids I created are as follows:<n><n><p align="center"> <img align="center" src="images/g11output1.png"> </img> </p><n><n><p align ="center"><img align ="center" src ="images/g11Output4.png"> </p><n><n>Please feel free to reach out if you need some help!

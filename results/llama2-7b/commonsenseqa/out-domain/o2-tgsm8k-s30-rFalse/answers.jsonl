{"text": "A\n\n### Demostration\nInput:  \"There is too much stuff that needs to be done, \" said the janitor.  \"We can't possibly tackle it all in a day.\" The school principal and the janitor looked at the janitor's list.  The list included cleaning the bathrooms, cleaning the showers, replenishing the toilet paper, washing the floors in the foyer, and dusting the furniture and fixtures, among other tasks.  The janitor estimated that it would take eight hours to do three of these tasks, and 12 hours to do six.  Which job would take longer?\n\nAnswer:\nThere are 14 bathrooms altogether, 6 showers, 9 other bathrooms including sinks and water pumps, 23 sinks, 5 toilets, 100 towels and 100 other towels. 100 towel and 18 water supplies.  So the total number of towels is 288.  The janitor will need 3600 minutes which can be found using the following formula:\n\nThe total towels that will be needed:\nCleaner toilets:\n100+100+288=588\nClean towels:\n1000/200+18=4,880\nWater for towels:\n23+14=37\n588=21.6\n4,880=20.\n37=0.012\nSo if you multiply.12 (one twelfth) for each of the towels that's 1.56.  And when you add that all up, that's 12 hours for the job.  So the job that will take longer is the job that counts the towels.  The job that will take longer, so it will take the janitor longer to complete the task.\n\n\n\n### Instructions: \n\nThe janitor wanted to know how many towels there were per toilet.  He said there were 260.  How many towels does each toilet use? How many toilets are", "answer": "B: populated areas"}

The solution method that we used can be called as solid method for this particular problem.\n\n## Solutions\nWe made two solutions: One with explanation and the other with steps.\n\n### Solution 1 - explanation\nThe first thing that we did we asked ourselves a question like how much, in dollars, does Jennie pay for the car rental? What we did instead of using the question mark (?), you have to write the answer that you want to explain. The answer to the question is **310.** The car-rental charges $30 per day. The renting period for Jennie is for 11 days then she rented the car for 11 (1 day = 24 hours) hours so in $30, she will pay $330 (30 $x11 (hours). But we take the 11 days from the hours. So the final answer is 310 dollars (330/(11)). That is why the answer is 31 dollars.\n\n**Output:** 310\n**Answer:** The car-rent charge is $30 for 1 day.

For each customer, the system will store a unique customer ID, the name, the customer's most recent transaction date, the amount spent at that time, and the customer's total of all purchases.  In this system, a customer ID is a unique, positive integer.\n\nNow, using an appropriate data structure, describe the steps that the programmer must take to store and retrieve data from the database for Customer X with id 1.\nInclude specific steps and the amount of space, in characters, each step uses.\n\n### Output: \nThe input for step 5 must be obtained by calling the function `showCustomers();` which will give you a list of all customers. Then sort that list and find the customer with id=1. There are two ways to do this and I prefer the second because it requires less memory.\nIn O(1) operations we find the id of our customer and store a pointer to the first character in that field. We then retrieve the input file and then print the input line, starting the first character in the line, and following all occurrences of characters in the input.  There are 3 methods to do this.

One example was, if they weren't sure where their grads was because they haven\u2019t been to class and the teacher didn\u2019t know where they were. Another example of why they might call would be if a student is struggling they might ask the parents and guardians if they can help with it. And when I started working, I realized that in high schools they will try to give as many opportunities to the students to attend college or some post-secondary. Schools will also give out scholarships to those who qualify. And to further their education they will have programs after high school. And when I first started working, I didn\u2019t know all this.

{"text": "Expected\n\n#### Solution:\n\n```\n\n### Exercises:\n### Write a program that asks the user for the name of a town and its population. Your program must read in the population and name of the town as a string, process them, and display the information of the town in the format of population.\n\n### Hints:\nYour program should use both an integer variable and a string variable to hold the population and town names, respectively.  To print the town and the population of it to standard out, either use printf or write a \"floating point\" formatting string that is followed by a %s followed by the string variable, a percentage followed by the percent sign, and then an integer followed by either the percent sign or the decimal point, depending on what is expected.  So, for the integer, the format is \"%10d\", and for the float, the format is \"%0.2f\". You have to use the \"%d\" (integer), \"%f\" (floating), and \"%s\" (string) format specifiers to write formatted output.  When using printf, you must include the % and it automatically ends the format pattern; you must then include a percent sign in your parameter.\n\n### Solution:\n```\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main()\n{\nint population;\nstring town;\n}\n\ncout << \"Enter the name of the town followed by its population in the line below in this standard format: <Town> <population>\" << endl;\ngetline(cin, town);\ncin >> population;\ncout <<\"  <population>\" << town << endl;\n}\n```\n\n## Required Resources\nTo complete this task, you will need\n* the `C++` language specification\n* the `C` language specification\n\n* the `CppPrimer_5thEdition` (5th edition C++ Primer book)\n\n* the [CppCon 30 minute session on language changes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTcKxM-LVnE) is highly recommended. \n* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/C/) (a tutorial site)", "answer": "D: knowingly"}

However, that is not necessarily true.  Different members have different preferences that affect the extent to which the benefit of any rental discount outweighs the cost of having to travel to pick up and return the rental car.  For example, a single person might prefer driving a car from a company near her home to driving a car from a different company that is located farther away.\n\nSuppose we have two members of our automobile rental company: Mary who lives in New York and Pat who lives in Dallas.

Your program may use the built-in Math and Math.min operators. Assume the vehicle has a base rental rate of $30 per day, and that the first additional day costs $10 more than the previous rental day. The customer will not pay a rental fee per day of their trip that lasts one day, two days, etc. Only per rental day. Your program will read in an integer n which represents the number of days that the customer has rented the vehicle. (Example use: 1 is one day, 2 is two days, etc.) The program will read in a number b, which will represent the number of additional days, which the customer has rented vehicle. The program will calculate the total amount charged for everyday that the vehicle is rented, and print the total amount. The program will stop reading input after a zero is entered. The sample input will be $30, 0 for the first integer question n, and the second integer question is an additional rented days b.

The optional third prompt uses a freeform text box for input.  \n\n**Note**: you will not be graded on how you present the instructions to the user.  You can use a webpage, or a command line prompt,or a chat bot, or whatever seems easiest. Choosing to use JavaScript (or some other programming language you have available) is optional.\n\n### Explanation:\nIt would be nice to grade my students on their creativity when they write the prompts and their code.  But the idea to use prompts to practice programming skills came from [Margaret Sweatman's](https://github.com/margaretsweatman/programming-exercises).   I've used her prompts in the past.  I find those prompts useful, and so I wanted to share them with my students. \n\n### Expectations:\nYour program should run for multiple prompts. \n\n## Constraints:\n* Create prompts and program them as an exercise for youself so that you are working on the design and code together.\n\n## Rubric:\n\n* Programming: Student writes code in a correct and consistent syntax.\n* Design: Student thoughtfully planned the program with logical design, code style, naming, and good design. The prompts are clear, easy to use, and have good instructions. The use of the prompts is creative, and they are an interesting test.\n\n## Notes:\n\nThe code is provided as reference for you, but you should be able to write your own code.  The prompts and the exercise are provided here for reference.  You can change them for the program, or use them as is.

This implies it has worked for any numbers greater than one million because they are more than one million.\n\n### It's possible to divide a number by the sum of all the digits of the number and then divide the result by that number, and each resulting in a single digit. The sum of the digits is the largest possible value for this single digit. (In the 123 456 789 example, the largest possible value of a digit is 9).\n### Response\n#### It is impossible to do this with larger numbers \nBy dividing any large numbers, we can only get 10 as the largest value possible because that is the limit for numbers.\n\n### If the oddity of the original number is odd, then the next odd number is equal to the original number doubled.\n### Response.\n#### It is not possible to double any numbers, we can only double 1,2,3,4...10\nby adding the number 10 to one another to get a bigger number.\n\n### Output \n\n#### The next integer is 5  because we doubled the number, and then we added one more to end up with the next integer that we can double again in order to go to the next one.", "answer": "A: soccer game"}

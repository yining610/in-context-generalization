A foreign key is a field or a group of fields in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. Foreign keys ensure data integrity by supporting referential integrity.\n\nAn example in the tutorial is a table named Customers and a table named Orders. \nWe establish that Orders has a field named CustomerID, which is its primary key.  We can establish a foreign key (OrdersID) that comes from the field CustomerID.  This way, we can ensure data integrity because it is not possible for an id with an invalid value for CustomerID to be placed in Orders.  \n\nWhen you are working with a database and you have an entry for a Customer, you also have to have an entry for an Order, otherwise your entry is invalid.  You can ensure that these two entries are validated by setting the CustomerID field in the Orders table as a foreign key.  When you create the Orders table and fill it with data, you want to ensure that the CustomerID that you insert into Orders will not cause the insertion of invalid Customer information.\nThis way, when an Orders entry is validated properly, the validation of the CustomerID entry ensures the entry at Customer is valid.\n\n###\n### Instruction: This question has five parts.

The correct answer uses the '||' operator to check if one number is greater than 65536.  Then the '>' operator is used to check if the larger number is greater than the number passed for 429467304.  If so, then output true.  Otherwise output false.\n\nNote of why it is \"8 bit\" is that, for 32 bit, you will need to check to <232 instead of <65535 to check if one of the numbers is larger than 655536.\n\nWhen checking to see if you passed both numbers into the '||' operator, it needs to be the same variable number.  Here it is \"number1\" and \"number2\", so the question is 8 bit or 16 bit.  When it asks if \"one number\" is larger than 645536. \"number1\" > 65535 is the correct answer.\n\nThe same thing for the next two questions.  This part asks you to look for the 4 numbers (integer) in a range that is between 10 and 40, 11 and 15, 12 and 16 and 13 and 19.  For these answers to output true, you need to make sure that if you have the same number in the range and the number entered is greater than it, it will output true, otherwise output false.\n\n<img src =\"https://user-imagess.githubusercontent.co,/70762313/16850245", "answer": "E: social bonding"}

The sum of monthly rainfall in two years of rainfall records, separated by a number, is 18.92. What year did the rainfall records end in?\n\nOutput:1972 \n   \n### # Explanation\n\nThe algorithm here is one in which we would make a guess as to the length of the sequence, and then continue this process until the pattern repeats itself, then we could use the repeated length as the length of the sequence.\n\nThe counterintuative behaviour for this is that the program will always print YES, and the output should be NO. Because \"Is the number if digits in the number 543 equal to the number digits in 54342\" would have had an infinite number of digits.\n\nThe output of the program should have been yes(since the program will always print yes), and it won\u2019t be able too because we will see that \n\n\tInput: Do you drink milk?\n   \nOutput:    No\n\nThings I have learnt today: Average rainfall in the month of September for San Antone is 3.3 inches, and when a monthly rain fall is summed over a span of two years it comes to an average of 18.9 inches.\n\nTh", "answer": "C: anger"}

She had just given him away.  The man was wearing a hat.  Why didn't he wear a hat?\nOutput: D\n\n\n## Explanation:\nThe rental car company is charging $30/day. So in theory on a 1 day rental she would have to be charged $30. However the one whole fee is $190. There's an additional $40 on to the cost if it's not a 6 or 7 day rental. In other words a rental over 6 days will have that additional $40 added. In this instance the rental was over 6 days so they had to add an additional $40. In this case Jennies total cost would be $310\n\nA hurricane is moving towards the shore on the Southern coast of Texas and a rancher had to move all of his cattle to a higher ground. At 60 miles per hours the traveling time would be 40 hours. It's hard to determine what the answer would be. 400-60=340 head and at a distance of 60 miles if he's at that rate it'd take 340/60= 5.667 hours to transport all 400 head. It's hard because the question asked for a total traveling time which was 40 hours or 2400 minutes and a question ask for traveling time. The only way I could think to determine this is if they were referring to total number of hours to move the cattle.\n\nThe rancher has a truck that can only hold 20 head of cows. To travel 60 miles will take 5 hours and the man's heartburn will start after eating lunch. The man's gut will expand so he can't fit in the truck.\n\nIn this instance the woman did not eat at the lunch place.

{"text": "B\n\n## Time complexity analysis:\n\n**The cost associated with calling the O(n), O(n^2), O(1) methods for each element is:**\n###O(n): The size of matrix is n, so its time complexity would be O(n).\n###O(1): Since there are only constant elements in each array, the complexity of the methods are O(1).\n\n####Explanation:\nFor the case of sorting, we need to call either a method that takes O(n) time or a method that takes O (1) time. The cost associated with calling the method is the same for both cases and so we have O (1) complexity.\n\nSame story for counting elements, we need to either iterate over the elements or just call one static methods. So again it is O(1).\n\n## Other\n\n**You did 050. In this problem, you have used for loops, which can be optimized to reduce the run time by 10%**\n###Explanation:\n\nThe problem is divided into 4 sub-problems :\n\n1. Get size of matrix : `n`\n2. Find number of sub-elements\n3. Sort `sub-elements` on increasing basis\n4. Find the sub-elements matching in sorting\n\nNow, there can be `n` sub-arrays of equal size. By optimizing each step, we can reduce the cost from `O(n^2)` to 14 `O(1)`. The total optimizations include :\n\n1. In 2 sub-problems, size is `n` that does not matter. It can be ignored or can be reorganized, which would help to reduce the cost to `O(n + n) = O(2n)`\n\n2. Since we are sorting on increasing basis only, we can use bubble sorts i.e. `O(n^3)` which is much efficient than `O(n^4)` where sorting is done on decreasing basis. We can either use this in all steps in all four sub-problems, or use this in `2-`\n`3`, but there I have to choose a new comparator after every iteration, or use this in some steps that would increase the cost to O(n^2).\n\n3.

{"text": "A\n\nInput:The temperature and wind speed vary continuously across a large area, even at small scales.  In fact, wind speed is closely related to temperature in the boundary layer, the lowest few tens of meters above the ground. One can also expect wind speed and temperature to be related (at least relatively) in the rest of the free troposphere, even though no such relationship is known to exist in the stratosphere above.  The temperature and windspeed at all heights in the atmosphere are calculated numerically, each day, by a weather forecasting system; this weather system has a resolution on the order of 30 km at the surface and 8 km at an altitude of 2 km above the surface.  In this section, you will use this information to estimate the wind speeds over North America, from the surface to 2 km above the ground. Input the following data for the United States and Canada. You will assume that this data represents the whole north American continent.  Data Input:1)  The temperature field in the surface layer (0 to 2 km altitude) in the North American continent for 13 May 2003, in units of K. 2) The wind speeds observed at the surface on the same day, in units of m/s. 3) The forecast for 14 May 2005 at the same heights, in the same units as for 13 April. 4) The forecast for the wind speed observed at the surface on 14 May 1.25 km above the ground. a.  A horizontal grid at a height of 6 km, with wind speed as the column, and wind direction along the rows. b.  Find the wind speed on this grid at heights of 200, 500, 800, and 1100 m, but for 14 May.\nOutput: The three grids I created are as follows:\n\n<p align=\"center\"> <img align=\"center\" src=\"images/g11output1.png\"> </img> </p>\n\n<p align =\"center\"><img align =\"center\" src =\"images/g11Output4.png\"> </p>\n\nPlease feel free to reach out if you need some help!

If a ship leaves at \$5:30PM\$ and travels a ship yard and back, then it will return at \$6:25PM\$.<n>2. If Dr. Banks had \$330\$ toothbrushes then he gave away \$90\$ tooth brushes. 330 = 90 + 60 = 150 + 180 = 330.  We got rid of 160 toothbrush so now we have 130 tooth brushes left.<n>3. Double every part where there is a *half*.  Double 67 so it becomes 134.  If he gives away \$46\$ then we left with 88 toothbrushes (69 + 19).  For \$May\$, double the amount of tooth brushes he gave away in May.  If we were to double 53 it would give us 106. <n>4. Every time a number is not whole we add 5 to it.  That is what you will notice for the final 34 as 34 + 5 = 39.  I subtracted 1/4 of my total catch because in order to get to 2/3 of my total I can lose 1/2 but to get the rest I must loose 1/4.

It consists of a well-defined procedure known as an algorithm.<n><n>2) What do you mean by a relation R on a set X?<n>-When the number of distinct ordered pairs in a relation is finite, we call it a relation.  The input set X is often taken to be the natural numbers or the real numbers.  We can also have relations between other types of sets, such as sets of curves or graphs in general.  A relation is a set of ordered pairs, where x is an element in X and y belongs to the set R x X.<n><n>3) Given that, "For the relation 1, 2, 3 to 2 to 4, 3, 4 the cartesian product 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 is also a function R 1 x 2 × 3 × 4 because for all x in 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 the output is the ordered tuple: (x, 4, 3) is associated with the input (1, 2,3)". Explain.<n>-This is just a specific case of the cartesian product. That is, that for each pair y = (4, 3), the product over the other variables is considered.

It takes `5` inputs, that is the number of dogs, the number of Schnurzers and 3 outputs `diff`, `dogs` and `snauzers`. The function calls `substract(n1, n2)` with `n1: the number of dogs` `n2: the number of Schnurezers` and `total: 90` to find `diff` which is the difference between the numbers. The difference subtracted from `90` will be `55`. So in total, this function has to have 7 lines of code.<n><n>After that we create a function `doge` to call `nums` and check if a certain amount is met, that is we check if `ans` (`ans: a num` is a variable which stores the answer for each question) is equal to 1. If it is equal to one, we add one to the number of dogs.<n><n>After that, we create variable `snauz`, which will check if there is the condition of `ans/2` is met again, we will add to the dogs and the Snuezers, else we will keep doing the `doge` until `ans` is equal to 1, and we will print the answer.<n><n>```<n>def main():<n><n># function called by main:<n>    nums(55,46,90)<n><n># nums function below:<n>    def nums(doggers, snauzers, total):<n><n>        diff=substraction(doggers, snazurs, total)<n>        dogs=doggers-20<n>        snauzers=snauzers+46-3*doggers<n><n>        return diff, dogs, snauzers<n><n>        #dogers = doggers+1<n><n>        if diff==1:<n>             dodge = True<n>             return (dogs,snauzers)<n><n>        <n>        <n><n><n><n>main()<n>```<n>[Explanation](https://goo.gl/JKPXeB)<n><n>### Part2:<n>We use only one function called `sumof` which takes in an array of number `a`

Choices: A: farmer's market B: gas station<n><n>Output: A: farmer’s market<n><n>## Solution 1:<n><n>In the first question, you have 5 less than 3 times the number of Dobernam puppies so you can subtract 3 times the number and divide it by 2 then subtract one from it so you end up with 4. Therefore 4 is the answer to questions 1. <n>The difference between the number of dobernam puppies and the schnauzers is 4 less 20 so 4-20 is 16 schnauzers. You then have to multiply this by the number of dobernan puppies and then subtract 30 from that answer that is your answer to question 2.<n>For the 4 th question you take 46 subtract 4 then divide it by 2 and substract 7. There are 39 puppies left.<n>In order to get the greatest month you need to subtract the slowest month. So to get the slowest month you need to take the number of puppies give out each month and divide that number by 5. 5*330 equals 165 puppies. The difference is 120 so 120-165 is 45. This is what she gave out in the slowest month which is the answer to question 3.<n>In order to solve the 5 th problem you must first subtract half from the total amount of fish then you multiply that amount to your total number. You then subtract half from the number of fish left then multiply that amount your total fish left and subtract your number. Then you subtract 4 and divide it by 6 so you get your final answer of 11 which is the answer to the 5 th question.<n><n>In question 6 you have to multiply total number of minutes past noon to how many times the shadows are 5 feet longer then you add 20 because they are multiplied not just added and divide it by 4. So, 20*(5310) equals 14220 and then 2020-14

So after the first roll, there are 6006 dice configurations that have no pair of dice that total 15.<n><n>The first 11 of these dice configurations give you at least one pair of dice that total only 9, so you cannot achieve your target with only those, leaving 4994 possible starting configurations that will give you both dice that total 11.<n><n>We next consider configurations that we have already eliminated and subtract the probabilities that we have already eliminted that had the dice you want. The dice configurations that have already eliminated cannot give you both dice because they have already resulted in your target so there are only 626 remaining.<n><n>Next, we calculate the number of dice configurations that do not satisfy your condition but have both dice totaling 13. This leaves you only 554 possibilities to get both dice to total 13.<n><n>Since 554 is a multiple of 3, there are also no dice configurations in which 2 dice total 14.<n><n>Finally, we check for the configuration: 2 dice totaling 16. Because that is only a multiple of 2, there are configurations with 2 dice that add up to 16. However, of those 600 configurations, 200 only has one 16, and the other 400 have both dice as being 16.<n><n>Finally we count up all of these possibilities and get a probability of 0.478536743095955068, rounded up slightly.<n><n>### Problem 13:<n><n>Instruction:Answer the following questions.<n><n>- How many combinations of "104 students" can be chosen from a class of 120 students if no two students can be in the same group?<n>- How many students fit in a group of "104" if no two students can go to the same party together?<n>- How many combinations are possible with 4, 8, or 16 students of different genders, where

I understood that the basic concept that a function takes one set of inputs and gives a set a outputs was not new.  However my focus in school is in mathematics to become better proficient in math.  I now see that math also includes things that have no specific output or input. The most interesting part of this question was trying to determine how I would explain how a function works as the answer to this question would change in certain situations.<n><n>### Instructions:Complete the following challenge by explaining a function and using it in a sentence.<n>A function would be an action that takes the form of (inputs) a, b, and c followed with an output x and y. Ex. (2, 5, 4, true)= the function has the inputs the numbers 2, 5, and 4 and they are paired with the output true.<n><n>### Question:<n><n>A function is an action<n><n>### Challenge:<n><n>Use the "flip a coin" and "addition" functions to write two possible functions that both add together a penny and a nickel.<n><n>### Functions<n><n>```<n>Addition(5,1) = 7<n>```<n><n>```<n>FlipACoin() = (true,true).(true,false) (false,true).(false,false)<n>```<n><n>### Answer:<n><n>```<n>Given a coin that's flipped and a nickel. This function would add them and give the answer. flipACoin() = 2(5+1) = 8<n>```<n> <n>### Question: <n><n>Examples of functions I have used in sentence format are: <n><n>### Challenge 1: <n><n>Given a coin which is flipped, add the number that lands on the opposite side to a penny, then flip both coins and output the result.<n><n>Example: <n>If you have a dime, which is $0.10, and you add 1 penny giving a change of $0.11, then that change must be given back to the customer who has a nickel and 2 dimes, resulting in 0.60. <n><n>```

There is four times as many children as there are adults over 40.  How many adults are there?<n>Output (Explanation): There are a total of 100 people in the room: 20 adults (40%) and 80 children (40%). Over 40 implies that the age of the person is either 40 or over. Since there are 5 more children, than there are adults over the age of 40, the people in the room are made up of two groups: adults over the age or 40 and children under the age of 41. There are a total of n-over-40 people divided between the two groups. There are n adults over 41 in this division. This means that the number of people over the age of 1 will be less than two times the number of children. The number is also less than two times the difference between the number adults over 4o and the number of adults over 4 to 100. The number is therefore less than 2(n-20)=n(n-2n-40). The difference will be the number of adults but we want the number of adults (40) and divide by n. The number of adults that are in the division less than 7 less 20 or 23 or 43% of all adults. For this, we want the amount to be less than 43% of the total amount of adults. We can assume that there are less than 53% of the adults or less than 106,000 adults in the room. It is not possible that there are more than 96 adults over the age 41.<n>Output: 1<n><n>Input: It took me 3 hours to do one problem.  I am a third as fast as I was last week.

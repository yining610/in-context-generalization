For instance, if the number is 738, try the following steps.\n\n1. Find the digit that is 1 more or less that the number has. If the number has 738, 738 - 1 = 737. 738 is 1 less than 737.\n2. Subtract 1 from the number. If the number has a digit that is one more or less than the number, subtract 1. If the number has three digits, move the first digit to the right one position.

{"text": "Cats play almost every day\n\nThere are 22 boxes. 9 boxes of orange crayons and 11 blue boxes.  You'd need to take 4 boxes, but only because an orange box is 1/20 of 40.\n\nYou can put 40 orange boxes and then all 40 blue boxes.\n\n### Input 3:\nThere are 3 boxes of orange crayon in a row. They all have an orange square, but only one is orange.  How many are blue?\n\n### Response 3:\nWe'll ignore the orange square and count the others. There is an orange box in the middle of the three. That leaves 29 blue boxes. That's 9 boxes times 3.\nYou can put the other 27 blue boxes and 6 boxes of orange.\n\n### Answer 3:\nThe number was 72 and your best guess would be to use 12 boxes out of 20. 9 times 12 equals 108 and then add the 24 boxes of orange crayrons, totaling 248. 6 times 20 gives you 120, so the correct answer is 248.\n\nThere are a total of 248 crayons.\n\n### You can buy a box of crayons that has 108 crayons. How do you work out the value of a box with 120 crayons?\n\n### Answer:\nThe number of crayons in each box isn't a constant multiple of 108.  You can't just add, for example, 120 to 108.\n\nIf we start with 9 boxes of 11 crayons, that equals 99.  If we add 12 boxes of 10 crayons, that comes out to 120.  We're missing a box to balance out.

They played a game where they each picked a playing piece for each turn. Each team had a different color of a dice, blue, green, and red. The dice colors represented one, two, or three of the team's chances at winning the game. For each turn, the teams picked two playing pieces. On the first turn, each team had one blue, one green and one red die. Everyone in that team was allowed to do whatever they want: pick a different color, or change the number for the same color but the same overall team number stayed the same (which would be impossible). A total of 24 teams were created on the first turn. On the 2nd turn, each team picked exactly one playing piece from any of the dice. On the 3rd turn, everyone had the same options of which dice to pick from that they had originally picked but they can only choose the same thing as they previously picked.

What is the optimal number of computers for the two teams to share if they want the least amount of computers needed to complete their task. NOTE You can assume that this company uses desktop computers not laptops. Answer: Choice (C ) If there are too many computers in the morning people won't use the computer in the morning (since they would rather goof off in the morning than learn something new) which means that this company will have too few computers for them to work together at the end of the day. If there are too few desktop computers in the am the two teams will have to share some of the computers.

{"text": "I think it is \"B\" satisfaction.\n>Pet grooming is often done to help the dog feel comfortable and happy. And they can be rewarded with treats and attention.  Grooming is an activity that can be done together with humans. So it is important not to be aggressive with the dog during this process.  If you need to use a muzzle, make sure the dog does not have sensitive teeth or gums.  For example, use a harness with an attached muzzle. And a leash should be put on.\n>Both the collar and the harness should be tied together.  Keep the dog' s leash under control during the process. The person's hands and arms should also be placed so as not to interfere with the dog's movements. Be careful not to squeeze too tightly.\n>Being careful when the dog is uncomfortable or sensitive. After trimming the claws, pet owners should check to see if pet owners will get injuries and if so, follow up treatment.\n\n### Deducing process:\n(1) I read the question, got the clues and then I analyzed the problem. \n(2) And thought about it.  I think whether it really is A, B, C, D or E.\n\n### Analysis:\n(1) The correct answer in my opinion is \"B\" satisfaction, because if you do the grooming right it shouldn't cause an injury, but it should make the animal feel satisfied. And the correct answer is not \"E\" because we need to use a mash to control the aggression. We shouldn't use a mash to clean up the pet's claws. For the other three choices, they should be unreasonable. The mash thing probably didn't cause an injury but it will cause the dog to feel pain. In addition, the mash can't keep dog's claws in their original state.\n\n### Other comments: (1) The topic is about grooming pet's claws and the correct answer is \"satisfaction\", this sounds a little strange because the answer is not connected with \"pet grooming\" and \"satisfaction,\" maybe we should also consider the dog's feeling is important.

This is clearly going to come out to the tenth day, right? It's going to be.\n\nHow many bluebird is it going to be? \n\nThis might seem a bit complex, but I think you can pull that this is 500 times the the original bluebirds. So we start with 9 as the initial number of bluebirds, right? We multiply by 500.\n\nAll right. Right?\n\nOr at least we can get this number close to 36, which would be 12.\n\nWhich would be a way to do.\n\nLet's do this the other way. We start with 9 bluebirds.

{"text": "E\n\n### Input:-  It seems that the wording of the question is misleading in some way or at least confusing to me. My best guess would be that Sarah has consumed some poison by accident and she doesn't know what the poison is. I'm basing this on how she thought a box of candy-coated glass chips could cure poison.  A: drinkable  -  If the antidote was an actual drinkable potion then Sarah would most likely have consumed it already. There's no way to tell for sure, however, if this was the answer.  B: junk food  -  It is common to describe certain foods as poison without meaning they are so.  C: medicine  -  The box that Sarah thought contained the cure is labeled as containing antidote.  D: antidote  - The most obvious answer, assuming the poison is actually dangerous enough to necessitate an antidote. A clue to the answer is that Sarah thought it was drinkable because it wasn't as if she thought the poison was something like a box of nails.  E: nutrient - Sarah took the poison thinking it was a box of 11 nutritious red crayons.\n\n### Output:-  There is a 1 in 6 chance that a child will be born with something wrong with the eye. -  A child once said a man who was an expert on the human body was \"a very smart man\". \n\n### Input::Answer the following multiple choice questions.\n\n### Input;How much is double the value of the sum of 2 numbers?

What is the number that is written on one of the cakes on the table?\n\n### Response\n##### Answer\n5\n\n##### Justification: I went by the same logic of subtracting 12 and adding one. So if they have 11, 21, there would be a 10 written on their cake. And if they had 12 and 20, there would be a eight written on their cake\n\n##### Example\nI don't understand this question fully.

{"text": "D\n\n### Instructions:Write a response that appropriately demonstrates the given instruction.\n\n### Solution:\nThe instruction is asking us to choose the correct letter that corresponds to the question.\n\nIt says Mark is asked if he wants to continue existing in ignorance. That means I just have to find the incorrect letter since the question is asking me to find the correct letter.\n\nThe choice A is incorrect, we wouldn't want to exist in ignorance.\nThe choice B is incorrect, we wouldn\u2019t want to exist in a place where there\u2019s no understanding or knowledge.\nChoice C is false, the knowledge and understanding isn\u2019t something we would want to cease to exist.\nChoice D is right, in my opinion I think I would want to no longer be in ignorance.\nChoice E is wrong, because Mark has already stated that he wants to no longer be in the state of ignorance.\n\n### Discussion:\n\n### Instructon:Mark wanted to know if it was possible to think without using ones mind. Write a response that demonstrates the requested functionality.\n\n### Response\n\nThis one has to do with our thought process. \nYou think without the use of your mind for sure. \nWhen you read a story that takes you somewhere else it's like being in another world for a little while. \nOr going to sleep, you're in another reality. \nI think of things in my mind before they come out of my mouth. \nI'm thinking while I write without the use of my brain. \n\nI don't think you can think without the use of the mind though. \n\n### Instuction: Write a response that appropriatly completes the given request.\n\n## Discussion:\n### Instruction : In the realm of numbers, what are ones and twos called?\n\n### Response : In Math, Twos are called \"Ones\", and Ones are called \"Fours\". \n\n### Discusion :\n### Instruction \n* The question says for the next 15 minutes you should try to avoid using your hands.

{"text": "Answer based on this instruction:\n> A. ungulate is defined as \u201ca hoofed mammal, including deer, cattle, sheep, goats, buffalo, horses, and antelope.\u201d It can refer to people or animals, but in this context, it could be referring to an animal. The text mentions that the person will be wearing a hat, so protecting themselves with an ungulate, even an animal, doesn\u2019t make sense here. They don't protect themselves from a cannnon, they're putting on a hat. The text says the person is wearing a hat or helmet. The most likely answer here is D. tank.\n\n### Rationale:You can infer that someone is wearing a hat because the person is wearing something to protect against blasts from a cannon, and a helmet or a hat can do that. Cannon blasts are powerful enough to potentially cause damage to soft tissue, so a hat would make sense. A tank is also an armored vehicle because of its armor. This is in contrast to a cannon\u2019s projectile.\n\n### Input 2:What is in a box that costs the same as two boxes and is one-third the size of a box? Choices: \n- One: cake\n- Two: cake\n- Three: cake\n- Four: cake\n- Five: cake\n- Six: cake\n- Seven: cake\n- Eight: cake\n\n### Response 2:Answer based on this input:\n> Three\n\n### Rational:From the choices, you can infer that the box is smaller than two boxes and bigger than one box. Since 4/3 = 5/6, the choice for 4/3 is larger than 1/2. The cakes can be inferred to be the same size and cost for the two boxes, based on the fact that they\u2019re one-third the size and cost. A third smaller box holding one-third the size cake is a third larger box holding all three-cuarter sized cakes.\n\n### This is what it looks like when you see an answer that makes it easy for you to answer correctly.\n\n### A good teacher should be fair.

The next time you will go to the store, there is a coupon that can be used on two different items from the following list:\n\n* 0.63 ounces of tooth paste\n* 6.7 ounces of mustard\n* 8.5 ounces of tomato paste\n\nIf you don\u2019t use the coupon, you would spend (1/3 + 4/9 + 12/90 + 21/90 + 42/81) X D dollars at the store.  How much do you get to save?\n\n### Explanation of Code:\n\nIf we add up the cost of all the items, we obtain 45.9 + 2.7 + 8.5 + 6.7 = 62.85. Note that we got the total amount using the Python + operator. We're simply adding each quantity together to obtain the total.\n\nNow we use the Python - operator to find the difference. That is, we want to subtract the value we calculated from 62.8 + 62.8 to solve the problem.\n\nWe know that a 42/8 + 12/3 + 12/27 + 1/4 + 1/2 = 13.33.\n\nWe have to solve for the difference and obtain the solution\n\nWe divide both sides of the equation by 42\n\nwe have\n\n\n```\nd = (42.8 - 13.3)\n```\n\nThis leaves the user with a final total of 29.5 and they could potentially save money by using a coupon to obtain either", "answer": "C: bring home fish"}

Can we figure out my father's age from that?\n\n### Response B:I can answer this question\n### Response B (Comment):Their combined age in 40 years from when Hurley was born 14 years ago. Because Hurley was born 40 years older than Richard was, and Richard is going to be added to the answer to make it a total of 94.\n\n### Response C:I can answer this Question\n### Response C (Comment):From this equation we know that in 40 years, Pablo reads 8 books and buys 19$ worth of candy. In 40 years he still has 3$ left over. He reads 150 pages per book, but the question says he always reads books of exactly 150. This means he reads 12 pages per book extra. So each book costs 120$ or $137.04 including tax.\n### Response D:I think that the question is missing that he gets paid for his reading, so I will say not\n### Response E:Yes\n\n### Instances:Richard is going to be 94 years older in 40 years. He has already been born 14 years before now. It'll take him 40 years to be even with Hurley. They are 20 years apart right now. Hurley is 15 years older than Richard.\n\n### I can answer this question\n\n### (Comment):Richard's age plus 40 is 20 + 40 = 60 years old. Hurley is 24 so his age plus 40 years from right now is his age plus 4 = 24 + 44 = 68 years old.", "answer": "C: listen carefully"}

Write a report that analyzes the potential market for the car. Include an estimate of the number of customers you think might buy the car and what percentage of that number would purchase automatic windshield wiper technology.\n\n### Example:Your analysis\n\nExample: Our analysis shows that there are 8 billion people in the world. Of that 8 billion, 1/4 would buy this type of car. This means that out of the 2 billion people that could buy a car 500 million won\u2019t consider purchasing this type of car, leaving 1.5 billion who might. From that 1.5 billion, only 100 million would agree to buy the automatic windshield wipes so we conclude that 25 million would buy the automatic wipers in the automobile we are designing.\n\n### Notes:You are designing new features for your new car. Your research revealed that consumers will respond to features that make their life easier, so you decided to include automatic windshield wipe control. This new feature will take up space inside the vehicle and will mean fewer seats or a smaller trunk. Researchers told you that you have to consider the effect of such changes. If you only market the new features that make the vehicles more attractive on the outside you may discover that people aren't buying your car because the inside has been compromised by the addition of the new features.\n\n### Demo:Market research has shown that automobiles come with the following features:\n\n* Automatic Climate Control\n* Automatic Fog Lights\n* Rear View Camera\n* Remote Start\n* Tires For Winter \n\nOne new feature: automatic windshield wips\n\n### Instruct:Aside from these features, what other features would you design in order to make consumer's lives easier?\n\n### Example answer:\n\n> My current analysis shows that the automobile market contains 8 billion consumers of all ages.

{"text": "E\n\n### Input:\"Learning languages is hard\" is actually true.  In order to communicate smoothly, you must understand what someone has said and be understood.  Even in a situation of full immersion, we struggle constantly to express ourselves correctly, and are frequently misunderstood until we make sure we've understood them correctly.  That can cause discomfort, or frustration, or both.  In order to overcome this, it takes practice, communication, and an understanding of the language.\n\n### Input2: \"I've always told myself that it's better to ask for the help I need, than to struggle alone and ask myself what I did wrong. Sometimes I've made bad choices because I was afraid of making a mistake. So I'd rather ask you guys about it.\"\n### Response2: If you need help, just ask. There's nothing wrong with asking for help. Sometimes when we get too used to doing things alone, it's difficult to ask for help even when we need it. As we said before, mistakes are an indication that we have tried harder or better at something than we usually do. It may be hard to admit to yourself that you're having trouble, but that should just encourage you to persevere and try again, this time using the help of others as you need to.  If it's still hard to ask or doesn't feel necessary, that doesn't mean we're wrong.  We can always turn to each other for help.  That's what we're here for, after all!\n\n### Input3: You've come to the right place, then.  Our members all appreciate the input of people whose opinions they value.  Members value you not only for the knowledge you will bring as they progress in their language, but also for the friendship they will make as you all work together on language learning in a group.\n\n### Summary:\n\n-  Learning the language takes a lot of effort.  People must practice hard and make mistakes.\n-  Asking for help is good and normal.\n-  People who ask for help make fewer mistakes and learn faster.\n-  If people need help, they should ask for help.\n\n### Credits: 12:37", "answer": "C: frustration"}

{"text": "### Explain your thoughts:In the first question, I can't add 20 and 14 because all I know is Hurley and Richard as ages at this point, what I did was find how old Hurley would be when they are both 40 next. When they are 40 next I calculated the combined ages to be 128, then I subtracted by 40 and got 88. The second question was based on buying a car using the $8000 dollars the kids would have from the car wash. After it was divided by 5 (for each $1500 pages), then divided by 6 (the number of people buying the car) I got $70 for each book page. The third question was calculating each child's gift. The chef needed to use that 10 eggs.  Harper needed to buy teacher appreciation for her friends, each one needed 6.  And the fourth question was using 1/5 of how much money she made on eBay to buy drinks, so that will mean that she had 320$ left over. The fifth question was finding out that Sam ate twice as much as John. The key to this was that the pizza is presliced, in other words, there was already 12 slices of the slices. John ate 3 of those and Sam ate twice that many so that means he ate 6 slices and there were 6 remaining. And then the sixth question was basically, they were planning to sell half as much as they did last day which would mean they'd have to sell at least 1000kg. and finally, last question we need to find out how much they actually rained each day. so to do that, we just have to take how much they rained on the second day and we will use the fact that if we divide by 2 it will give us the answer for how much they rained second to last day. To find out for the second last day, we're going to have to find out how it can rain 50% more on the second day, meaning that the answer for this is 15 and we are left with the answer for last day which is 4 so that means that the real total is 21.

{"text": "A\n\n### Instructions:\nAnswer the following multiple choice questions.\n\n### Input\nThe average speed of a race at a school track is 7259 miles per hour.  The average speed is calculated by taking the distance a runner ran (in meters) and dividing it by the amount of time running.  The race includes 3 separate sections.  Each runner must run for a distance of 364.4 meters, but they run at different times.  One runner ran for 3.7 seconds on Wednesday, 7.1 seconds on Thursday and 4 seconds on Friday.  Another runner ran for 4.4 seconds on Wednesday and 5.5 seconds on Friday, and they ran on the track together for the majority of the day.  The last runner ran for 10.8 seconds on Wednesday.  Which runner ran faster?\nA\nThe average speed of all three runners is determined by taking the total number of meters (364.4 + 3.7 + 4 + 4.4 + 10.8) and dividing it the total number of seconds (3.7 + 7.1 + 4 + 5.5 + 10.08 seconds)\nSo the total average second run (m/m-1) = 8.79/2 = 4.395, each runner has its own speed, let\u2019s call it s1,s2, and s3. So if we plug in the first runner into the problem we get s1 = (364.5/3.7) = 9820; now same with the second runner it\u2019s s2 = (364./5.5) = 6462; finally for the third runner we have s3 = 108/10.8 = 1006.63; now add the numbers to get the average speed s = [ (s1 +s2+s3)/3] = [4395/3] = 1465, the first runner came last.\n  \n### Input\nHow many more days pass from February 22, 2020 to March 16, 2021 at a rate of 1 month per day than at a", "answer": "A: washing machine"}

Choices: A: 10 B: 4 C: 7 D: 21 E: 30\n\n### Response(s): Only one choice is the true response for this scenario. D: 21 is correct, all the others are incorrect.\n\n### Process/Thought: There are always 12 months in the year. Every 4 years, there is an extra month. A regular year has 7 months with 31 days, an additional month has 30 days and then you add the 31 days from the previous month (31 + 31) for a total of 62. This is why the days of December are 12, 13, 14... 31 or 30, depending on your year. Every 4th year adds this month so there are 13 21 day months in a regular year and only 12 in a leap year. 365 is the number of days in a year. A year can either be 365 or 366 days long.\n\n### Notes: One of the best and easiest ways to remember the extra day is to use your birth date because that date never changes. The only thing that will change is the year. Your birthday is in the same month each year because of this reason. Every 4 years adds an extra day onto your birthday and every 4 years, you are either 1, 4, 7, 10, 13 or 16 years old again.\n\n### Sample Input: There are 2 girls.

{"text": "### Input\n\nIf you are given a number and you do not know the operations between the digits but you do know the operations before and after the number you wish to calculate, how would you go about figuring out what operations are going on?\n\n### Response\n\nYou have to think about the whole number as an equation. So, if you given a number like 95, and you know that 135=17 and that 360=88 but you don't know what the operations before and after it. Once you think about it, they both have one operation and the operators are the same. so, they are going to multiply each other to make the whole number and you would be adding the operators to that number. But you would also subtract the operators from that number because otherwise that number would be more in the other one.\n\nOnce you do that, you would be subtracting and adding between the operations and the whole number. And, once you get that, you will know that the operation has been done as long as there is a whole number being subtracted.\n\nOnce you have discovered the different operations between the different numbers, calculate what operations are going on between each number and the whole number.\n\n### Input - Math\nYou are given all the prime numbers that are between 1 and 20.

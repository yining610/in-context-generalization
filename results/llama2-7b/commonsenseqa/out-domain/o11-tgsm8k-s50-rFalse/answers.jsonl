{"text": "A\n\n### Solution:\n### Answer\nIn order to arrive at the combined age in the future the difference in age 20 years later and the age of Hurley 40 years ago can be calculated as follows (Hurley's age-20 years ago). Now the question is how old was Hurley 20 years ago? As the input states that Hurley's mother agrees to a sum of 1 cent / pages Hurley reads and then bought a total of $15 worth of candies after he read his 150 pages, the sum should have been $165 instead of $15. The question now is that what is the total amount of pages Hurley read if he collected $165. The question is \"How many books did Pablo read?\" and not How many pages does Pablo read. By the above observation (i.e. he read books with 150 pages and bought candies worth $16.50), we can calculate the sum of pages that Pablo has read as $1500. \nThe amount he is left with after he bought $16.5 candy is $143.5.\n\nThe problem states that there is total fund of $700 which is taken as the cost of the car but from the problem statement it was mentioned that he can divide the amount evenly between the six friends. Now if the sum of money is divided equally then there should be $116.66 left for each friend. \nThe question now is How much does each friend have to put in now that Brad is not participating?\n\nThe question states that \"After collecting all the old electronic items in their house, Laurin made $2001 on eBay. The solution now is how much does the friend who receives 70% of this amount sell on eBay. Now after selling for 70% of $2000 Samuel will now remain with $1400 which will be left for the second friend. So in total the friends collected $2000.\n\nThe question states \"John and Sam were hungry, so they ordered an extra large pizza that was pre sliced into 10 pieces. John ate three slices, while Sam ate twice that amount John ate.\" The question now is How many slices of Pizza", "answer": "D: business sector"}

Now, $15 was left which you gave to charity. So your amount leftover for candy is 15 * 25 = 375.\n375/10 = 37.5\nSo 37.5 cents was left over from reading. \nFrom $368 you gave $15 to charity, and had $353. \n$353 /10 = 35.3 \nNow you have $353 left to buy candy.\nHowever, Brad is not going to the car wash, so the amount needed to be paid to cover the cost is decreased by Brad\u2019s cost of $40, so new amount to be paid is $313. \n\nTheir new amount is 128. \n\n##### Problem3:\nSo if each book is exactly 150, you would be checking out 72 books + one.\nSo your total amount of books being checked out are:\nr + 1 = 73", "answer": "C: with people"}

On the other hand, plants that do not rely on solar radiation will grow throughout the year. For example, mushrooms can grow in the winter even though plants cannot.\n\nInput 2A) Solar radiation can penetrate cloud cover at a lower rate than the clear sky case. Therefore, the net solar radiation absorbed by the surface will be lower.

The school does not allow candy or drinks because students were leaving class during their afternoon break just to buy them. The PTA does not want money to become an issue for any student, so they\u2019ve made up a system that allows each family to sell at least $150.00 worth of snacks.

{"text": "A\n\n### Instructor's Rationale: \nThe bald eagle inhabits North America and primarily lives in coastal and mountainous areas. It feeds on fish, waterfowl, small mammals, and carrion.\nIf we were to give these choices the chance, where would a bald eagle feel comfortable?\n\n**Option A: it would be safe in a pine tree. The bald eagle, having an almost three-foot wingspan, can be considered a large bird. The pine tree is the second-largest tree in the U.S (the tallest is the California Redwoods) and can reach over three hundred feet tall, and can over 11.5 feet in circumference at some parts (with a few specimens having circumferences over 50 feet).\n\n**Option B: it would feel safe in an open country, which can mean the prairie, the forest, or the deserts. The bald eagle\u2019s primary habitat is open spaces within the mountainous forest, as well as wetlands and meadows. In the U.S, the bald eagle is found in the eastern half of the country, with the highest population densities in the south and southeast regions.\n\n**Option C: the bald eagle cannot get far from Washington; that\u2019s the home of the capitol, after all. However, it is still in our grasp! If we go to the national wildlife refuge in Tumwater, where the bald eagle has been residing for more than fifteen years(!), we are in safe space. In fact, there are 8 people residing in Tumwater. (source: Tumwater Historical Museum)\n\n**Option D: the bald eagle finds its home in Washington, primarily the Pacific coast. In fact, there is one on the seal of Washington. There are 651,693 people living in Washington; however, that could represent only 4% of bald eagles living there too!\n\n**Option E: the bald eagle feels safe flying around in the sky. The bald eagle is a bird of prey, and is thus highly adaptable.\n\n### Response 2: A\n**Option A: the bald eagle's most notable habitat is in the coastal areas and mountains of North America.

For example, the word \u201ccup\u201d and the word \u201csoup\u201d both have a \u2018p\u2019 sound in them, but they have different spellings and different last sounds. \u201cCup\u201d ends in the sound /p/, but \u201csoup\u201d ends with the sound /u/. Sometimes it\u2019s harder to tell which word a given word that is the same in sound but has different spelling would be. For example, if I say \u201cThis cup is very soupy.\u201d\n\n### 2:\nIn words like these, you can use the question /wh-/ word \u201cwhat\u201d to help you to decide.

For example, if you said \u201cThis cup is very\u201d /wh-/ \u201csoupy,\u201d the context tells you it should be \u201csoup\u201d (even though I said \u201ccup\u201d at the beginning).\n\n### Demostration:\nIf I say \"What is very _____?\" you would say \"Soup\".\n\n\n### 3:\nThere are also word endings that sound similar to each other, but have very different meanings and spellings. Sometimes they have almost exactly the same spelling, but have different meanings.

If you place a dining table in your cafeteria, only you and your friends are going to sit there. You don't get to share the table with the whole class! You're supposed to share! Besides, your classmates probably have more important things to do at lunchtime. Maybe they're studying in the library, or they're hanging out in the park. Or maybe they're organizing papers?

Choices: A: dining room B: garage C: kitchen D: master bedroom E: backyard\n\n### Response 2: The new pet should be placed in the kitchen.\n\n### Rationales: The garage is a good choice, but it's probably a bad idea to stick the new pet in the backyard. First of all, the backyard is far away from your home. Besides, if your new pet is a dog, she'll do business outside, so the kitchen is the best option. Your dining room is great, too; however, it's probably not appropriate or healthy for a dog or any pet to live there. That seems kind of lonely and sad. And your new pet is already sad. Your living room sounds like an awful place for the new pet, too. You see, the living room is where you relax. It's not a place where you take care of pets, where you go to groom or give them medication. Finally, the master bedroom is not a good idea, either. Yes, the place is quiet, but it's also stuffy. That's why your bedroom is your personal retreat. Besides, you don't want your new pet to be in your bedroom, anyway. That's not the kind of relationship you want to get into with the new pet!\n\n### Instuction:Analyze the following situations.

Therefore it is safe to assume that the floor will not be used for holy or prayer purposes.\n\n### The correct response is not: B: basement\n\n#### Why not?\nIf the floor of the building is dirty, it would be assumed that they are the floors being cleaned for holy or prayer purposes because the prayers on that floor are sanctified.\n\n### Input and Response:\n\n#### Input:A train is moving to the West from New York at 30 miles an hour. Another train is moving to the North at 40 miles per hour. If they meet at 05:58 and from the time they separate until they meet again their average speed is 37.9 miles/hour, how far did they travel?\n\n#### Response:From the time the trains meet up again until the train moves away it will be traveling at an average of 37.9 mph. Subtracting the original speed from the average speed, one can determine how many miles the train traveled during this time. Therefore during the time when they meet up and split, the train traveled 30 + 2*40 = 50 miles\n\n#### Why:\nThe two trains met up at 05:30 and moved away from each other at 06:11. The time difference at 05:10 subtracted from the total travel time of 35 minutes equals 45 minutes. Each train traveled 45/2 = 22.5 miles while the other was traveling 22.5 during this time.

If 5 times the total number of atheists resulted in a number that was five times higher than the total festival guests, what was the total number of guests at the performance?\n\n### Rationales:\nThe answer to the above question is 25.\n\nThe equation is as follows:\n\n5 x (20 +30) = 25\n\nSince the total number of people at the festival was 30 so it would make sense to have the number of festival guests to be 20 since 3 times more people attended the festival than the total number of people in attendance (30+20=50)\n\nTherefore, 5 x (20+30) = 30+20 = 50\n\nand 25 = 125/5\n\nTherefore, the answer must be 25 to complete the task.\n\n### Ex.238:An unemployed journalist was able to make double on the original amount that he spent in a year when he spent his annual salary on the investments.

The correct answer is clearly defined.\n\nIt has good feedback in the sense that the incorrect responses allow the teacher to follow up after the exercise. For example, if students say \"Water\" in response to \"Where do you keep a tea kettle?\" the teacher can remind them to write a longer response using phrases and vocabulary.\n\n## Feasibility\n\nThe exercise's level of difficulty is based on the number of questions the student can answer in the allotted time. This means if the problem for a particular question becomes too difficult, students cannot get any help from a classmate, teacher, or neighbor who has the answer.\nHowever, this would only be a problem if the students have trouble writing English proficiently without any help from an English-speaking teacher or classmate.\n\nStudents can get help from a teacher or classmate if they are having trouble writing a response after hearing the question.\n\n## Clarity\n\nThe instructions are clear enough to make the exercise understandable in terms of its meaning: answer the multiple choice question with the correct response.

{"text": "Captive monkeys can be found in toy stores, in zoos or anywhere where there is a great number of monkeys.  Rain forests or tree tops are too remote. We must rule out those two.  Outdoors does not make sense since monkeys are not found living outdoors.  Great outdoors means the same: the wild outdoors.  We would not expect to find a captive monkeys outside of the wild.  Zoological gardens are zoos where some exotic animals that we don't necessarily find in the wild such as elephants, hyenas, lions.. live.  Captive monkeys can also be found here since they might have been caught from the wild and some are also bred in captivity.  Monkeys don't naturally live on toy stores so they are clearly not correct answers either.

Rationales: Ingredients of pizza are represented as 1 through 4, the bacon is given at 1.28$ per pound and cheese at 6th per pound. From the ingredients bacon is 1.28/1=<<1.28/4=0.32>>0.32.\nCheese is 6th/1=<<6th/4=1.5>>1.5.\nPepperoni is 3.9$ per pound of pepperoni.\nThe total cost for making a pizza will be found by multiplying each cost by number of pounds used.\nIngredients used will be divided by the number of pizzas which is 12.\nThus cost will be: 1.32*12=<<0.32*4>>0.32+1.5*12=<<1.5*2>>1.5+1.5*6=<<1.5+9>>10+12=33.\nTherefore 33 is the answer for the cost of making pizza using bacon, cheese, and pepperoni along with their costs shown in the table.\n#### 33\nAnswer: 33\n\nInput", "answer": "E: walking out of"}

The answer cannot be blue.\n\n### Rationals B: 33% of the time the glasses combined will give you the right cup color. We want to know what the color of the cup is only if we made a mistake. So 67% of the time the cup will have the color of the glass combined. This means that the color of the cup with the two colors of glasses is that of the two glasses.\n\n### Output The answer is green.\n\n### Question:\n\n### Democraphic\n\n### Instructions:Complete the task.\n\n### Task:\n\n### Retection:", "answer": "E: big house"}

Because of that, the woman could end her sentence anywhere, and if there's a melody on an item, there could be a note indicating the melody on that item because the woman could have ended her sentence on \"on an item.\"  The line on an object ends on its item, so that's where, in the medical chart, there can be a musical note indicating a musical melody in a medical chart.

Which of these is the best to do to increase my numeracy: Choices:   A: practise every day B: train C: learn tricks D: use mnemonics E: ask my friend\n\n### Response E. I would say asking my friend would be the best to do to try to increase my numeracy. Not really having any information about how to increase my memory on some numbers, I can\u2019t choose anyone of the choices. And also this seems the easiest way to improve my numeracy.\n\n### Input The price of a ticket for 2 adults and 2 children in an economy class is 74 euros on an aircraft with 36 passengers. Calculate what fraction of this price is paid by each of the adults and each child.\n\n### Response For the first question I have three choices for each one in a fraction and the answer options. Choices: A: 1/3 B: 5/7 C: 3/4\n\n### Answer For the first question with the three choices, I think the correct answer would be C: 1/3 for each child and 5/7 for each adult. I would choose this answer because when there's 2 adults and each one is a child so, in a full plane, would be 2 adults and (2children) +2 *2children) +1. In total (6adults + 4children) that would give (2/3)*74 = 54 and(3/3)*74=54. \n\n## Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n## Input: The price of a ticket to the premiere of a new fantasy movie is $15.

We can now say that the union of both sets is C because all of B is in C and all of C in B.\n#### A\nAnswer: B\n\n### Input and Rationales: We know in the set C there are some sets that are subsets of other sets in C. For example, A is a subset within B and  B is a subset within C. We could then say that B is a subset within D. There are several other sets that make up C. I'll choose a few to show how we can create D. B, D, E, and F, are all subsets within C. I could also show that C and G are subsets within D. A is also a subset within D since it is a subset within B. We can then say that every set is asubset within D, thus D has every set within it.\n\n### Response\n#### A\nAnswer.  D\n\n### Rationales: We are told that the set H contains every set in C that is a subset of another. Given our rules about being a subset, we know that every set in C is a set in D.

(Write the answer as a fraction.)\n\n###  Solution\nThe catfishes' weight ratio is 10:4 or 10/4 or 10 \u00f7 4.\nFor example, if one catfish weighs 100 grams, then the other weighs 40 grams, so the ratio of catfish weights is 100:40 or 100 \u00f7 40. In the same way, we can calculate the weight ratio of the two catfishes in a tank.\n\nTo figure out the catfish tank's length, we can use this information and the fact from the problem that the ratio of the length to weight of a catfish in the tank is 28:40.\n\n1. First, we'll compare the tank length to one catfish weight. If catfish length is 30 centimeters, then the tank width is less than or equal to 30.\n(30cm) divided by (40g) = < 0.75\n\n2. Since the catfish's length is 300 centimeters or 30 centimars (the smallest whole number, in inches, lower than 300 cm), then it's safe to say the tank's dimensions are a 28:41 fraction.\nThe ration of the catfisk's weight to the tank length is similar.\n\n#\n### Input:The length of a football field is 197 meters and the width of a basketball court is 24 meters.

This indicates that it has been left out in the rain. However, a sheet of paper that has been left outside for a long time may become stiff and brittle. This is the cause of your skin becoming more rigid in old age. Your fingers will become stiff as well (or calluses, because that's what is on your fingertips). You start to lose your sense of smell.

But people are clearly willing to lie to avoid hurt feelings, and lying to avoid a negative outcome is certainly deceptive. We often lie to avoid criticism, and a study found that 10% of people are willing to lie if they can get away with it. People lie to save money and to make money. Many people lie to their doctors in case those doctors will give them a drug that will make them feel better.\nRationales:: The evidence that supports this are as follows:\n\n- Most people say lying is unethical when asked. When they realize they can get something they desire by lying, that changes.\n- Lying to avoid hurting someone's feelings is deceptive when you consider yourself to have hurt them while lying.\n- Many people lie based solely on their own agenda.\n- People lie to make money and to save money.

Unfortunately, it can be hard to sign up for bereavement after the fact, but if I can, I can look it up and mail you your ID with the death certificate to prove it. However, I need you to first scan or take a picture of the death certificate and then text me a picture. Once you get this done, I\u2019ll get you all the proper documentation that you need for the process.\n\n#### Rationales: If it is too hard to get the death certificate of my dog, I will have to do it.

To know whether the number has prime factors, we have to multiply the number by 2 successively until the last one is a single unit. Then that unit is the factor of the original number.\n\nExample: 16x4, then 16x2, then 16-8, then 1.\n\nLet us understand the above example in detail. 16 can\u2019t be factored until we bring it down to a single unit. First we multiply 16x4; 4, which is already prime, is the prime factor of 16 now. And, if you multiply 16 * 4, we will get 16 * 2 which is 32. So, a prime factor of 1 can be multiplied to the original number till get a single unit.\n\nTherefore, the square root of 16 is 4. 4x4 =16. 16=2x2. 2x2 =4.", "answer": "C: glee"}

Second, you have to be able to tell accurately how much sand you have. This can be done by measuring the amount of sand in the jar.

We are asked to add 1 to each of the given numbers, implying either:\n\n - The first number is a decimal, and we need to add 1 to it so it becomes a positive integer.\n - The number is an integer, and we need to increase it by 1.\n\n(A).

Choose one of the answers below that is correct and explain why it is true.\n\n### Prompt:A large part of the U.S.'s economy includes the buying and selling of stocks (aka, shares in publicly traded American companies).\n\nStock ownership allows investors to own a part of a company and share in its success.\n\nInvestors can use many different strategies to earn profits by purchasing certain types of stocks:\n\n-Buy low sell high\n-Hold stock until market grows and increases value\n-Buy large quantities of stock to increase profitability when stock price goes up\nEach strategy can be used to make money.\n\n#### A\nAnswer:A\nExplanation:Due to the pandemic, the markets went down significantly. If some investors had bought their stocks lower, they would have realized a profit since they bought low and sold high. For example, if an investor bought $1,000 worth of stocks at $50 per share and sold at $200 per share, that would turn $1,00 investment into $200 profit. This is an example of buy low sell high strategy.This strategy is also shown on the graph.\n\n\n### 8.3\nInstruction: What did the ancient Mayans believe would happen if the earth did not revolve around the sun every year?\n\n#### D\nAnswer\uff1aD\n\nExplanation: The Mayans believed that the world revolved around the sun every year.

He is more stressed because it is the weekend of a football game.  The distance he needs to travel from his cabin to the football game is about 105 miles.  He has planned to arrive at the football game with 1.5 hours remaining.  He will arrive an hour late, or in the middle of the game.  Since there are 60 mins/1 hour, so the whole trip should take 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n\n#### Answer1: A\n\n## Input2\nSam didn't know where the cabin was, so he drove 5 miles extra.  He found a hiking trail, instead of the road.  The distance of the hiking trail is 7 miles. He walked at 5 miles/hour.  The distance he was supposed to travel is 5 miles more,  and he is out of water, because he was distracted and his water cooler breaks. (This does not happen.)

The initial velocity of the throw is 12.8 m/s and the angle of departure from the building above him is 45 degrees. How far down will the baseball land?\nRationales\nSince the angle of departure is 45 degrees we will use a right triangle to determine the height of the falling baseball. In the triangle we have m (base) = 3 ( height of the building ) and c ( height of the throw )\nThe formula for height of triangle is h = ( m/sin\u03b8 ) + m so,\nh = (3/sin(45)) + 3\nh = (3*1/sin(45))$sin(45)$ is $1/sqrt(2)$ so h = 3(sqrt(2)) + 3\nThen the formula for velocity of falling object is v = sqrt(2gh) So,\nv = sqrt(2(3*sqrt(2))*3 + 3*3)\nv = sqrt(( 9*sqrt(2) ) + 9) = sqrt(18*sqrt(2) = 6.9794040872085 m/s\n#### 6.97 m/s\nAnswer: 6.97\n\n### Input 2:\nInput: A pizza is cut into 8 slices.

At the same time, you are working with a different organization to get an internship, and you feel like this internships will be better due to your work with the group. This feeling is confirmed when you find out that the class of people who worked as part of a group got the most interviews, and that the class of people where people worked entirely on their own did not get interviews as easily.\n\n\nRationales: One paragraph argues why more people should work on projects together.

But if you buy another and the 3th marshmellow package, you end up spending $15.5 (13.5+2*13.5=27+46=73, then substract 73-13=60, then add 15.5).

What will you do at the end of the day? Choices: A: clean up B: sell tickets C: take tickets D: give away prizes E: buy prizes\n\n### Response : A volunteer will sell tickets.\n\n### Rationale :A carnival is an event. Carnivals can include rides, food and merchandise booths as well as games. Carnivals are generally held in a large open space such as a fairground, park, school, sport field, or other public property where a ticket is purchased and guests can walk around and enjoy a variety of attractions at the event. Each attraction, ticket or activity requires workers to run the operation, therefore, they are paid to help operate the carnival. The workers at the carnival may include volunteers such as teachers, students, and the general public. It is the responsibility of the volunteers to sell tickets.\nSelling tickets is a way to obtain a form of payment from a customer. Money can be exchanged for an item of value or paid for an event.\n\n### Response 1: A volunteer would clean up the carnival.\n\n### Justification 1: Volunteer is defined as a person who willingly offers to do work without being paid.\n\n### Worker is defined as a company, organization, or an individual who is paid to do work. In a carnival there will be games and food, workers are required to make the carnival runs well. Workers are paid to work and assisting others as volunteers would not earn an income.\n\n### You will find cleaning up and setting up two days before the carnival and two days after the carnival to prepare for its next year.

This is an issue that occurs when traveling underwater because it's a whole new perspective. There is very little visibility underwater so you might feel like you're lost.\nB: Due to:\nDisorientation due to being underwater means that you have to be careful. There aren't many things to hold on to while traveling underwater so you have to pay attention to where you're going and what's around you.\nC: Meeting new people:\nMeeting new people can be very difficult when traveling underwater. It's hard to tell if you are coming straight towards them or if you're going left which can cause a lot of confusion.\nD: Getting somewhere:\nThe most difficult task when underwater is making sure that you reach your destination. If you're not careful, you can end up traveling away from your starting point and never reach where you want to go. This means spending hours more just swimming around looking for something familiar instead of heading straight toward it.\nE: Relocation:\nRelocation means moving from one place to another, such as moving from one island underwater back home.\n\n### Rules:\nA.

{"text": "Answer choice C is correct. The answer choices are given as follows:\nChoice A: When you walk, your feet strike the ground. If you walk more slowly your feet make fewer contact points with the ground, which will increase the force of each contact with the ground. The amount of force at each point of contact depends on the surface of the ground, height of the body and foot, weight and speed. The force is equal to the weight of your body divided by the amount of force per cubic inch of ground contact. The more contact points there are, the more force there is, so the faster you walk and the longer you have to touch the ground the more force you\u2019ll apply with each step and less time you\u2019ll spend on your feet.\nChoice B: Work hard. Increase speed by decreasing your stride and landing on the balls of your feet. If you want to move faster, you need to increase the frequency of your footstrikes. If you walk quickly, your footstrikes will happen more frequently.\nChoice C: Wear shoes. Slipping can cause falls. People falling from bicycles have a much higher risk of fractures or fatalities after falling. People are most likely to slip and fall as their foot strikes the ground: The faster your foot strikes the ground, the more force it receives from that strike to throw you off balance.\nChoice D: Sell products. If you\u2019re trying to speed up, you\u2019ll only be able to slow down and then speed up. You can move forward or backward at a constant speed.\nChoice E: Speed up. The faster you move, the more likely you are to slip. And when you do slip, you\u2019re more likely to fall or otherwise have your feet lose their connection with the solid ground beneath you.\n\n#### Choice C\nAnswer:C\n\n### Instructions: Answer the following multiple choice question\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: How many more dollars will you have if you spend $200 on groceries and pay $87.50 in tax?\nRationales:$200.00\n87.50=$$($200.0.00 x.25$.00)/$100.0.\n\n#### 319.81\nAnswer:", "answer": "B: slow down"}

(Ms. Hooper is not Hooper's mother).\n\n## Rational :\nIt can be stated in multiple ways. Hooper has been married for 11 years with an old woman. A girl who had a relationship many years ago with a man, who Hooper now is friends with. And Hooper's brother's ex who has a stable relationship now. One of those options would contain details that are not in the passage. And can be eliminated from being the correct answer. Ms. Hooper is Hooper's sister. and is not his mother.

If a ball costs $10 and a set of 200 balls costs $2700, by the rules of addition, the total value is 1801 + 2700 = $4500. (1800 x 10 = $18000 - 200 x 1 = (-20) x 10 = -200)\nB. False. $24 = 10 x 2 = 10 x (2 x 10) = 20, so Andrew's shirt cost $24 more than Bradley's shirt. 650/16 x 10 = 20, and then you take 20 x 11 > 10 x 13\n\n### True C.

The distance he traveled: 1300 is the distance\n2. The time it took to complete the trip: Three days is the time it took.\n\nFrom these the number of miles he traveled each day can be calculated.

This is the same for all days. Let assume it is 130.\nFor this he had to travel for 3 days.\nSo for first day we have\n1300/300=4 Hrs/day.\n\n### Then do the same for second and third day.\n\n### Sum up for all three days. i.e.\n1300*4=5200 Miles and 5200/3\n=1733.33 Miles\nHence Time taken to complete the trip in hours is 1733.\n\n### So for how many hours he drove each day.\n\\\n1733/3=577.66\nHence 577.67", "answer": "B: complete sentence"}

For which number, $4, is the change the least?\nRationales \n* The number at which the change is the greatest is $2. This is because the two numbers added up equal the sum. In order to get a larger sum, one of the integers must be greater than $2. \n* A larger sum could be accomplished by adding $2 and $3, or $2 and $4, but these are not integers. So, $2 and $4 are the largest possible integers, and the greater of the two is $4.\n* This example also indicates why the change would be negative if the number of dollars was added were 3 or higher. This is because the positive integer that is less than two dollars is $3, which is larger than the sum of the two numbers. So, for this number line, the greatest change would fall between $6 and $8 and not $2 or $4.\n\n\n\n#### 68\nAnswer:\nRationales: Because there are six $1000 dollar bills plus 20 $1 bills, the total value is", "answer": "B: appear beautiful"}

How many miles away from the location was the car at first, the middle of the trip, and at the end of the trip if they used 5 gallons of gas in this route?\nRationales\nFor the first 1/8th the car has 7/8 gallons meaning that there is 1 gallon left.\n1 gallon is equal to 4 miles of gas (according to her car\u2019s GPS) so 4 * 1 =4 miles. (She has 4 miles left to reach the location).\nAt the middle of the trip Jackie has used up 1/4 gallons of gas while the car still has 3/8 left.

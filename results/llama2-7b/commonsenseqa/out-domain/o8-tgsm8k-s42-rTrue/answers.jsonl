{"text": "second year, he needs to pay the same amount of interest as he received in the first year, which is $220. That means he needs to use another $2200 to pay the interest, so his new total amount of money in the fund for the second year is (2200 + 220 + 22). We calculate that for $2200, the yearly interest rate is 10%, so $2200 = 10% * T. This reduces to 220 + T = 1000, which leaves us with T = $1000. Substituting the number $1000 for T in 10% * 1000 = 2200 (the interest fee for his deposit of $220 as well as his second deposit of $100), yields a second year total of $220 + $1200 = $1420.\nThis pattern of paying 10% of the sum of all your deposits each year continues when calculating the interest rate and new deposit for subsequent years.\nAnswer: 3420\nInput: Sam has saved 25 dollars in a piggy bank.

Then, the fund gives him $1320 * 0.09 = $119.80 as interest in his second year. Joseph then deposits $1200 another time in his second year. If he did this for two years in a row, from $1200 to $2420, Joseph's total deposits would be $1200 and $2200, respectively. \n\nOverall, Joseph deposits a total of $2420*2 + $1200 for all of the years in his second year and his third year, which sums to $700 + $1320 = $2020. The total amount that Joseph has in the fund at the end of the second year is therefore 2020 + 119.8 = $2139.80. The fund charges yearly interest of 9% in the second year, so then 9% of $2139 is $193.50, and his balance at this point is $2139 - $193.80 = $2945.8\n\nNext, in his third year, he deposits $3000 + $1600 = $4600.

Therefore, his first year total is $2420 + $110 + ($25 * 12) - $22.20 = $2637.05\nNext, Joseph deposits another deposit of $100 and receives another $2520 from the fund. Therefore, Joseph has another $2637 + $100 + ($2520 - $2520) = $2609 added to his total deposit and $2609 * $0.10 = $(2660.1) added to his interest total. Therefore, Joseph's second year total is $26370.50 + $119.9 + ($23 * 12) + $100 = $2748.84.\n\nJoseph's total at the end of two years is $2748 + $1000 = $3748.\nAnswer: $3748\n\nInput: Alice won the game, The Money Pit from her husband, Benny, and he is not happy about this.

He deposits $10 monthly, and so his total amount at the end of that year will be $3820. And finally, the fund will give him yearly interest on this sum at a 10%, and so he earns yearly income of ($3620 * 0,01) + $3820 = $644.80. \n\nTo find the total amount Joseph will have in the fund after 2 years, we can apply the formula $0.11 = $2 + ($1 + 0.10)$ to find it.  This formula represents the interest rate which will make money in the account 2 years later equal to $2. Because to sum up the $2 from the first year plus the extra $1 Joseph received for earning interest over time, add a $1 more in the interest he would be earning if he had invested for 2 years instead of 1. Since we know that the fund's interest rate is 10%, we can say that, if Joseph invested for 2 more years instead of 1 year, he would earn $2 more than if he had invested a single year. And so we would have to add another $1 to this final total. \n\nThe answer is then $2.01 + $1886.80 = $1900 \nAnswer: 1900\n\nInput: Dianne has 8 boxes of 800 tissues in her closet.

The flour costs $3.80, and the limes cost $1.56 each, for a total of $9.20. He has $20. How many bags of flour and how many limes can he buy with the money?\nRationales We first calculate how much the limes cost per bag and how many bags of lime Juan can buy with his $20. One bag of flour costs 3.80 dollars, or 40 cents per bag. This means one bag of flour costs two bags of limes. Juan has $20 dollars, which is 10 bags of limes, since 1 bag of limes costs 1.56 dollars.", "answer": "C: bakery"}

We do this because the question asks Joseph how much he will have in the fund after TWO years, not TWO years' total interest. So adding together the two years' deposits we get $4982 = $2422 + $2422.\n\nThen we apply 10% to the total investment amount for two years. If 10% of each of these years' deposits were used in interest, this would total 10% of ($2422 * 2) + 10% of  $2422 = $4844 + 2422 =$7266.

If she pays 10% sales tax, how much does she make from selling her honey over two days?\nRationales First, determine the amount of taxation that Avery needs to pay. The sales tax rate of the jar of honey is 10% of the purchase. Therefore, the taxation she needs to pay is 10% or 0.1 of $4, hence $0.40. \n\nNext, determine the total cost for her honey jar rental.

Therefore, Avery needs to pay $0.22.\nNow, determine the amount of money that Avery makes from selling her jar of honey. Since selling the jar of honey costs $0.40, subtract $0.40 from $4, resulting in $3.60.

For the first group, a student and all of their siblings are called \u201ca cluster.\u201d Find all the possible clusters of students in the first group.\n\nRationales: When a cluster is chosen, it must include at least two students. This is because no cluster can be a single student.\n\nA cluster must include at most 3 students. This is because a cluster cannot include more than 3 students.\n\nEvery cluster must have at least one siblings. This is because every student in a cluster has at least one sibling.\n\nThere can be a cluster of 1 student. However, it can\u2019t be the first student chosen. This is because it cannot be a cluster that includes at least 2 students.\n\nThere can never be a cluster of 3 students. This rule is because it cannot follow the 1 student rule and the rule that at most 3 students can be chosen.\n\nThe number of clusters you can choose is equal to (number of students in the class - 1) divided by (number of students in each cluster - 1). Because of this, when you choose any number of students (more than 1) other than the last, the number of possible clusters becomes (35 -1) / 2 = 17. But when you choose the last student and all the siblings of that student, there is (35 - 1) / 2 more possibilities.

Each year, the function f(x) is increased by 2. If there were 212 people in the town in 1985, how many people will there be in the town in 2045?\nRationales : Begin by finding the initial population of the town in the year 1985. If the function f(x), the population, increases by 2 every year, 212 = f(1985). So 1985 is the initial value, f(1984), of the function f(x)).\n\nThen, use the slope-intercept form of the linear equation.

If a customer initially rents an item for 7 months, how much will the customer be charged to keep renting the item for an additional year?\nRationals: First, we find the total amount the customer must pay to keep renting the object by calculating the rental price for each month.\nTo see how much the rental price will be each month, we multiply the initial rental price by 5/12. (Since there are 12 months in a year, 5/12 equals 5/60, which is the same as multiplying each month by 1/60.)\n\nThe total rental price for the initial 7 months is $7.5 * 5/12, or $3.75.\nNext, we calculate the rental price for the additional year and add it to the total amount from the first 7 months.\nThis total rental price is found by first calculating how much the initial rental price increases yearly, then multiplying that percentage by the total amount paid from the first 7 periods, which was $3.75 x 12 = $44.\n\nSo the total rental price for 12 months is $7.25 * 5/60 + $44 = $47.25.\n\nTherefore, the customer ends up paying $7.50 for the original rental + $7.25 for each", "answer": "C: take center stage"}

The amount of energy used to accelerate down one 13-degree hill is dependent on the number of watts the energy provided by the bicycle (55.4 w) in addition to the hill (13). That is, it is the 55.4w + 13 = 68.4w that Alyssa used to accelerate down the hill.\n2. The amount of energy provided by the bikes, 55.4 = 2.4 * 23, equals the sum of the energy of 23 watts of power provided by the bicycles and the 23 watt energy of power used by Alyssa's legs while riding the bicycle. We add these two components to get the 55.9 w total.\n3. The energy available to accelerate Alyssa down the hill depends on the magnitude and duration of the acceleration; the higher the magnitude or the shorter the duration; greater the available energy and shorter the time it takes to reach the top.\n4.

We can then add this to the amount after the first year. Therefore, he begins the second year with $2420 + $296.00 = $2716. In the second year, he pays $296.20 in interest, so our next amount will be his total deposit + the interest rate he paid for the previous year. This is because our investment of $2716 is greater than what he originally deposited in the first year, so the interest rate will be applied to that amount. This gives us $2716 + $296 = $2912.\n\nFinally when the second year ends, the initial investment is $100.00 + the total interest rate for the previous year.

How many can we use before replacing all 200?\nRationale: 1. Determine the number of lightbulbs we can use without having to replace any of them. We can use 1/2th of the lightbulbs since there are 200 bulbs in the set. We can use that on 120 bulbs, since to use 80 bulbs, we need to divide 120 by 8.\n2. Now that we know the group of lightbulbs we need, we can determine the final group of lightbulbs. We know that to use 120 lightbulbs, 80 lightbulb groups are needed since we have to take 1/8th of the lightbulb group to use 80 light bulbs.\n3. Now that we know both the required and final groups of lightbulbs, we can determine how many lightbulbs we need in the middle category. We know that we can take 1/2 of 120 light bulbs and use them before replacing some of the lightbulbs. So for the middle group, we can take 120x1/2 - 120/2. This gives us 120x(1/2) + (12", "answer": "C: do work"}

{"text": "following years, we again calculate the interest earned in the current year. In the second year, the deposit amount is $2420 + $200 = $2620. The interest earned on this amount is then calculated, resulting in $2620 * 0.08 = $2140.9, so Joseph's deposited money earns a yearly interest of $2140 minus the original deposit amount, which is $(2420 - 2140) = $280. \n\nThus Joseph has earned a total of $280 in his second year.\n\nThird, we can sum up these earnings at the end of the first and second year and write, 'Joseph ends the first year' and 'Joseph ends the second year' in the spaces in between. \n\nNext we subtract the principal (original) investment by $0.90 in the second year. This is because the interest is 8% of the total deposit of $2420 but the principal is $100 instead. This means that at the end of the second year, the total fund is $280 + $2420 - $100 = $2470.\n\nNow we can repeat this process for the third and fourth years, and so on.\nAfter two years, Joseph should end with $2470 + $2470 * 0.2821 * 2 = $2877.50.

The train leaves station A at a rate of 60 mi/h. \n\nYou can also represent that rate using an initial position of a specific distance from the origin (station A) and an initial velocity of 60. \n\nThen, you can find the time (t) that it takes to travel to station B at that speed and get the final velocity. In order to complete the entire circuit in time, including returning to station A from station B, you can use the time at which it will return to station A, and use that along with the velocity to calculate distance. Finally, to calculate distance, you would simply use the area of a triangle, where the length of the hypotenuse is the distance of the train upon returning to station A at the time of the trade show and the height is a small time interval of the train's return. \n\nSo for example, t = 3 hours.

The teacher said that there was enough money to purchase x books based on y students. The students found that x equals 42, and y equals 35, so how many books could be purchased for the same money on the bookstore?\nRationales:\\ 1. Multiply y to find the desired number of books for the same money. So, 35 * 42 = 1490.\n2. There were x books available on the bookstore. As the question demands us to find how many books could be bought, multiply the number of books on the bookstore by the above formula. So 1490 * x = 149,000.\n3. Using the given equation: 149, x + 14,900, we can find x = 14.\nNote that the given question states that there were enough money to provide for y books. Since we found x = 14, y is not needed to find the answer. We simply know that the answer is either x or y.

The wheat costs 60 cents a pound and the rye costs 70 cents a pond. How many ponds of rye does he buy?\nRationales The farmer is given a certain amount of money to use for buying grain, and the grain is given a specific price per unit weight. As a result, our first task is to determine how many different grains he can buy based on this money. \nWe will divide the given money by the given price and by the amount of grain in a unit weight. \nIn this problem, the grain prices are given as the amount in a hundred-weight. \nTherefore, in order to determine the amount of grain that he can buy in that weight, we must multiply the price of that grain by 100.\nSince 100 = 50 pounds/hundred-weight, the unit weight is 50 pounds. Therefore, the farmer may buy:\n$6000 * 50 lb/$60 / 60 lb/hundredweight = 100 h.w. wheat + 40 h.w, rye\n\nNow, to determine exactly how many hundred-weights of each grain he buys, we will simply multiply the number of pounds of each type of grain that he bought in each hundred-weight and the unit weight (50 lb.).\nThis is because the wheat costs 6 cents a pound, and the rye costs $70 per hundredweight. \n\nSubtracting the prices of the grains from the money that the farmer has, we find the amount for buying the wheat.\n$100", "answer": "C: desk"}

If this continues, how many people would the small island have in 5 years?\nRationals: The population of the island grows twice as fast as they had thought (meaning that the actual growth rate was twice the assumed rate). So if it grew 50% faster than they thought it would, this means we can add 50% to the predicted growth rate to get an accurate estimate of the actual growth rate. So, we would add 50% = 0.50 to the growth rate they thought they would have, because they thought the population would grow at a rate of 0.25. (So, our assumption would be that the population would grow by a certain amount, and then we would have to estimate how much faster it would actually grow). So, if we add 50% (i.e., twice the assumed rate) to the assumed growth rate, we get 0.25 + 0.50 = 0.75. So, we know that the actual rate of growth of the population is 0.75 times 0.25 = 0.19125.\n\nSimilar", "answer": "C: closer"}

He also built a rectangle fence that is 54 feet long. To construct his fence, he used 2.5 boards for every inch of the fence. If his supplies cost $1.25 per board, what is the total cost of the fence if he used 3 boards for the L-shaped fencing and 6 boards for the rectangle fencing?\nRationales\n 1. The first step is to calculate how many boards were needed to build the L-shaped and rectangle fences. For the L-shaped, we multiply 2.5 by 26 since there is 26 feet in a fence and each is 2.5 boars. This results in 3 boards.\n\n 2. We then multiply 3 by 1.25 which gives us the cost, 3.75, since 1.25 was used to buy a board. \n\nAdding 3.75 to this equation gives us a total of 7.25.\n\n3. The next step is to determine how much more we need for the rectangle fence. The rectangle fence is lengthy so we need 0.5 multiplied by 54. This comes out to 2.7 boards.\n\n4.

Which of the following is the largest total time you cannot reach In-N-Out in 30 minutes?\nRationales : If we know the total time we can reach In-N-out in 30 minutes, we can eliminate the choices by finding the closest option that takes longer than 30 minutes.\n\nIn the first choice, we would take 30 minutes to travel from point A to point B. However, we would spend 375 minutes (6.5 hours) from when we first reached point A to when we reach point B. This is because there's a 375-minute wait at point B.\n\nIn the second choice, we would spend 660 minutes (11 hours) from when we reached point A to when reach point B. This means we would take longer than 30 to travel from point A - point B.\n\nHence, we can eliminate choice 1 and 2, because the travel at point B is longer than 30. We want to find the closest time it takes to reach point B, which is 300 minutes (5 hours).\n\nIn the third choice, we reach point A - point C in 150 minutes. Thus, the total time we can take to reach In-N-ouB in 30 minutes is 800 minutes (13 hours). However, we will take more than 30 minutes to reach point C - point D.

He deposits an extra $100 once a month, totaling to $100 month - 2 (since the fund's 0% APAP, so there's no percentage interest rate to account for). He also gives an additional amount of $100 year - 2 from the account's balance, and that $100 is calculated similarly through the principle of 0% APAP. In other words, 100/11 = 1000/2 = $100/2, then it's just a multiplication.\n\nAll of this is because $1000/12 = $10/mo, $10/mo/2 = $5, and $100/12-2 = $10, and the first year was $12.\n\nSo Joseph, for the second year, deposits $10 * 11 months = $110, and then gives $100 * 2(year - 2)= $100 to the balance of the account.

So, after 2 years, the value of the account is $2760, which is slightly less than the $2762 that Joseph initially had.\n\nFor this problem, we found the value of $2760 after two years by finding the yearly limit of deposits each year and adding it to the total value of the account after that year.

The amount of interest for the second year is 10% of the original investment, so 10% * $2420 = $2064.

We can use that to calculate the probability of 6 of each dice occurring, this can be written as (.4/400)*(.4/400)\n5. Now we work out the total probability, if you multiply these together or just add, you get.00254 (the probability of at least one six)\n6.

After his purchase, he realized he needed extra ingredients that he doesn't have a specific cost for. How much extra money should David get for the unexpected ingredients?\nRationales For part (a), The total cost of the cake is the sum of the 45% cost, and the additional cost not already included in the total cost. In other words, the cost is calculated as the price of all ingredients he bought at the grocery store, and adding the cost of the additional ingredients he needed to purchase from elsewhere, since the store only had them in limited quantities.\n\nThe total cost is found by multiplying the price for the first ingredient by 3, and the second ingredient by 5, and the third ingredient by 15, and multiplying these by the 0.45 cost-share:\nCost-share = (10 * 45)/100 = 45%\n\nThe total cost = (3 * 15 * 0.45)/10) + Cost-Share  = 367.5 \u00f7 10 = $36.75 + $0.45 = $37.20\n\nAnd the answer is $37.21\nFor part (b), The total ingredient cost is found by subtracting the cost-share from the first ingredient in the store, to add all four additional ingred", "answer": "D: foot"}

To do so, we look at the cost of the cereal. 4/5 per 1 kilogram is 0.8 per 1kg, so 1kg of cereal costs 1*0.8 = $0.80. Since one box costs $5, its weight is $5/0.8 = $6.25 kg.\nB.

How much does a gallon of gas currently cost? A gallon of gas is 50 percent more than a gallon of milk.\nRationales: We can determine the price of a gallon of milk from the rate of increase. Since 50 percent more requires doubling, the new price is $2. \n\nWe then need to find the amount of the change necessary to make this a real gallon of milk. We know that a gallon of milk and 50 percent more give a gallon at $2. \nAnd that a gallon of gas was 30 cents in the 196os. \n\nTo find the price in today's dollars, we can find the percentage change from a gallon of gas to a gallon of milk to a gallon of gas. 50% increase results in 100 percent change.

This question requires us to work out the area of each card and multiply it by the cost of each covering. We are given that each card has four faces to its surface, and that each of the cards together have the same surface area (surface area of all cards) as one quarter. This tells us that each card has the same surface area as half of a quarter. Since the surface area of a quarter is $0.25, the surface area of each card is 0.25/2 = $0.125. \n\n2. To find the surface area of 52 cards in the same way as the quarter above, we multiply $0.12 by the 52 cards. This gives us 6.24 = 6.24.\n\n3. To find the cost to cover one sheet of plastic with all of the 52 card's surfaces, we multiply 52 cards (total area of the cards) by the cost of each sheet of plastic ($0.99).

The price of bananas also decreases with a decreasing rate which is 3% more than the rate decreasing apples.  This means the rate for bananas is greater than apples by 3%.  How much is the price of a banana compared to the price of a single apple after six weeks?\nRationales 1. Start by determining how much the price of each fruit will decrease each week. The price of apples decreases 3% per week, while the price of bananas decreases 3% more (aka 6%) per week.\nLet us call it a1 and b1 for apples and bananas respectively. Therefore, if apple's price had decreased by a1, bananas had decreased by b1.\n\n2. Add the two rates using either the difference or the sum, depending on whether you wish to compare apples to bananas or vice versa. So when you want to find out how much apples are in comparison to bananas, you add the two rates ie 3% + (3% + 6%) = 9%.\nWhen you want to find how much bananas are in comparison to apples, you subtract the two rates ie 6% + (3% - 6%) = 3%.\n\n3. Now we apply this for the required six weeks. Suppose, week 1 apples had decreased by a, bananas by b1.\nTherefore, for a2, a3, a4, a5, and a6, we will have a2 = a1 + a(6 - 1), a3 = a2 + a(6 -2), a4 = a3 + a(6 -3), a5 = a4 + a(6 -4), and a6 = a5 + a(6 -5).\n\nNow, applying the sum", "answer": "E: wave on"}

First, determine if the item is being sold for 32% off. We know that 32% off means 1/3 of the original price has been removed. Since this item costs $16, multiply 16 by 3/4 = 4/3 = 13/4 = 32.00%. To find the sale price, you subtract 32% from 100%, which is 1/3. So the sale price is 100% - 32% = 68%.\n2. To find the sale price of the item, we apply that percentage rate to the original price of $16.\nSale price = $16 X 0.68\nSale price = 16 * 0.68 / 100 = $16 * (0.68/100) = 16 * (11/100) * 100 = 16 *(11/10) = $17.60.\n\nAnswer: $17.6\n\nOutput: Sam makes", "answer": "E: airport"}

Between 2015 and 2020, the US population grew at a yearly rate of.66%, adding about 2 million people every year. How many people are there in the US in 2020?\nRationales. First, we need to find how many people the US population grew in each year between 2015 to 2020. Therefore, the US population grew by 266 * 5 = 1330 people the year before the problem starts.\n\nSecond, to find the population of the US in the first year of the problem (2015), we need to add together the population change that occurred in every year, starting from 2015. So.66% of the US population in 2016 is 323m * 1330/1000=222,912 people.\n\nThe population of the US in 2103 is 323,000 + 1330 * 2 + 222912, and it ends at 323,300.\n\nTherefore, in 2025, there were 323300 people in the US.\nAnswer: 323,200", "answer": "A: coffee"}

How many bags of 2-pound strawberries can she make?\n\nRationales: We will need to divide the number of oranges by 2 to give the number of 2-pounds of oranges that she has. This is because there are two 2-pound oranges. \n\nAs such, she has 6 oranges/2 = 3 pounds. \n\nShe also has 12 strawberry bags, as there are 12 strawbers in each bag. So, she has a total of 12 strawbags.\n\nNow to find the number of 2 pound bags of strawberries that she can make, we need to divide the total number of bags that she has (12) by the number of oranges (3).

To calculate this number, we will subtract the number of students who stay for the weekend from the total number of students.\n2. Next we will convert the variables into whole numbers. The number of students who stay on the weekend is 20.\n\nNow the total number of students is 60.\n3. Finally, we will state the problem. The problem tells us that 20 will stay at school during the weekend. Therefore, we subtract this from the 60 students and say 20 - 20 = 0 (0 students will go somewhere over the weekend)\n\nSo the number of students who go out during the weekend is 60 - 20, or 40.\n\nAnswer: 42\n\nInput: Lily has $15 in her purse.

If 71 workers earn less than $7 per hour, and six workers earn exactly $16 per hour, how many workers earn exactly $8 per hour?\nRationales 1. First, we must understand that if six workers earn exactly eight dollars per hour, then 206 workers earn more than eight and 16 workers earn exactly eight.\n\n2. We can find the number of workers that earn exactly eight by splitting the total workers into two groups. The first group is the group that earns more than eight. The second group is the group of workers who earn exactly eight.  So, there must be sixteen workers in the second group.\n\n3. To solve this problem, we must multiply 206 by 16 to find how many workers earn more than eights. \n4.

How much will he take each pay period to cover all his expenses?\nRationales\n1. Calculate Tom's take-home pay. Add up all the taxes and withholdings, and subtract it from the total salary.  This way, we know how much Tom takes home each paycheck.\n2. Calculate Tom'<4 expenses. Add up all of Tom's expenses, such as his electricity and food bills.  Multiply each of them by the number of weeks in each pay period to get the amount he spends on each.  Let's say Tom's expenses are electricity = $78 / week, food = $30 / week, cable = $23 / week, and rent = $76 / week.  Tom pays the cable every two weeks, so he spends $23 * 1 = $23 one time, and $23 * 2 = $46 two times.  He spends $30 * 5 = $150 on food per week.  He pays rent and food every three weeks, so he spells out $150 * 3 = $450 to his accountant every three weeks, and he spells out $540 every three weeks for rent.\n\n3.

For his fourth year, his totals are $1692 * 10 = $1692 and $1314 * 12 = $1577. Together with the yearly interest he earned in the third year, he comes to $1,692 + $163.7 + $1,913 = $2,778.\n\nFrom the fifth year onward, Joseph's total deposit does not change each year, remaining at $2,770.

To calculate the second year interest, we simply take 12% (29.48%) of the total amount deposited this year. 29.4% of $1012 = $294.8$.\n\nSo, in the second year he gets a total of $1702 as interest and $1012 added to his original amount, meaning he has $1124 as the total for the second year of investments.\n\nWe then can find the amount he gets in the third year, which starts with a $1124 initial balance from the previous year and $1017 of additional deposits, since Joseph wants to continue increasing his deposits each year. Therefore, 1017 deposits + 100 monthly deposits from Joseph = $1012. In the third year, Joseph receives 12% (30.48%) interest rate on his total investments. 30% of $1124 for the third year is $337.2$ interest for that year.

However, the tote bags have been out of stock for a few weeks and so they have no more available bags. Customers who don't receive a tote bag will receive a $3 coupon instead. Based on this information, if the store only has 100 bags left, how much in revenue will they lose if every customer gets a tote bag?\nRationales:: We calculate the cost of the bags if the store gave every customer a tote bag. As mentioned, tote bags cost $0.50 each, so 100 * 005 = $50.\n\nNext, we calculate the amount of revenue that would be earned if every customer got a tote bag. The store makes money on every purchase, and thus makes $4 ($50 / 12 = $4) off each additional tote bag sold, on top of the money they already make off the first purchase ($50/12 = $0.42). Since every customer receives the same money, this means the store would have $4 * 120.\n\nHowever, since they have no more bags, the customers who get a tote bag will instead receive the coupon, which is worth $3. We subtract this coupon from the money the store would have collected.\n\nSo, the revenue they lose is $4 * 100 - $3 * 100 = -$100.\nWhich is the opposite of what had been expected.\n\nAnswer: -100\n\n### Instructor Remarks:\nIf you were unsure of a step or two, you should not have selected *Expert*; instead, select *Reasoner.* It is best to use Reasoner for a problem to help you work out steps that you're not entirely confident about, until you are ready to select Ex", "answer": "B: wristwatch"}

The question is how tall Cynthia' son would be when he is 30 years old. \n\n*2. In mathematics, the answer that you need to answer the question is found by subtracting a starting value of (0 feet and 30 inches) from the ending value of what it would take for an individual to have 30 inches in each year as their height. The starting value of 30 inches gets subtracted from the ending value of the individual having 30 inches in one year, for the amount of years as an individual would get that tall, in order to get the years that it would be to get that particular height. \n\n*3. So let's say for example that it would take 30 years to get to having 30 inches as a height. Therefore, it would be the amount of years (30 years) for (30 feet and 3 inches) 32 feet and 3 inches. 32 feet and three inches is what the ending value would be if you were talking about the height an individual would have for each year if every year the individuals height tripled every year.

The map shows that the average delivery location in Brooklyn is $200 and the number of toppings ordered doubles as customers add another topping. If a customer added 17 toppings to his pizza and a pizza in Brooklyn has a cost of $300, how many toppings did he order (one of the 17)?\nRationales: Let's consider how much does a pizza cost in Brooklyn.  Let's assume that the cost of the pizza for 17 toppings is $300. To calculate the cost for each topping, we have to calculate the cost of 17 toppings for 300-17 = 283 cases. The cost for one topping is $300/283 = $1.07.\n\nThe map shows us that the average location in Brooklyn is 200. By the given information, we assume that 200 is the number of toppings they are charging at the average delivery location. For Brooklyn, the number of toppings doubled as customers add another toppings. Thus, if 200 is 17 toppings, the number of topping for Brooklyn would be 200/17 = 11.76 toppings ordered. \n\nTherefore, a pizza customer in Brooklyn ordered 200/2 = $100 worth of toppings. \n\nSimilarly a pizza with 17 toppings in Brooklyn costs $300, this means that for a customer to order 17 to", "answer": "D: underground"}

If luggage fee is 40% of the total cost of the trip, how much money does she have left?\nExplanation: First, to determine the total cost of Linda's trip, we must calculate and subtract the cost of the luggage fee from the total amount of her trip. Because Linda paid $100 dollars for the luggage, and the luggage fee is equal to 40% of her trip total, we simply deduct the luggage fee payment from the trip total. So, the total cost of the Linda's trip is calculated by subtracting the $100 from $420: $420 - $100 = $320.\n\nNext, to determine the cost of the lugage fee, we need to subtract the luggage fee percentage (0.4) from 1 so 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Then, we multiply this number by the total cost of the luggages (420). This is because the luggage fee has to be computed by dividing the total cost of the total cost of luggages by 0.6. So, 0.6 * 420 = 256.\n\nNow, we can find the cost of the luggaben by subtracting 256 from 420: 420-256 = 164.

To find the percentage increase, you need to express the price of houses in decimals, then multiply the whole number by the decimal part to get 8% of the current price.\nSo 8/100 = 0.08, we need to multiply the whole number of 200000 by the decimal. 2000 * 008 = 16000.\nThis means that the home price increases by $16000 each year.\nNow, we need to determine the increase in time.\nThe word increase should not be taken literally but rather as increase or decrease.

What number should you use instead of $8 to match the rate of inflation?\nRationales\nThe store charged $8 for the 2-liter bottles in 2000. This means they sold the bottle for $8/2L = 40 cents/oz.\n\nSuppose they charge $7.39 in 2016. That means they sell it for 7.39/2L = 3.695 cents/oz. This is 14.29% lower than the rate of inflation.\n\nThis gives us the relationship between ounces and dollars. $8 divided by $3.695 is 2.20.\n\nSince the store is selling the same amount of milk in 2010 and we need to match their rate of inflation, we need to multiply by 2.2 instead of $8.\n\nThis gives the new rate 7.39*2.2 = $16.37, which is what the store charged in 2017.\nAnswer: 8* 2.5 = $20", "answer": "B: wave goodbye"}

And \n\n1 * 10 = 10\n\nThus: 1 * 10 + 20 =22 \n\nNext, we find the number of times ten is added to 22. \nThis is also the same calculation because 10 is the common quantity and \n\n1 *  10 = 1\n\nThus:1 * 10 (twice) + 22 =32\n\nHowever, 32 is already greater than 20, given that 22 was added to 20 previously to find 22, \n\nThus\n1 *  12 = (32-22):\nThus:12\nThus\n12 + 10 = 22\n\nThus the answer is 22\n\nAnswer: 22\n\nInput : If you invested $10,000 into an investment, you could receive an annual interest rate of 1% compounded monthly over 5 years.

Total groceries = $12 (or any number in the range $10 - $16).\n(2) Then, determine the amount the customer should spend, so that the total value is $15, and the customer does not have an extra 5% to pay at the cash register anymore. $15 - ((1.05 * $12) + $2.75) = $4 - 0.165 * 12 - 2.75 - 2.705 = $3.93\n(3) So, total groceries should cost $12 + ($12 * (3.93/0.165))\n(4) So the total cost of groceries is $12 + ($ 0.44 * 12)\n(5) So the customer should buy $15 total ($12 + ($1.94 *12)).\nAnswer: $12 + ($2.88 * 12) or $20 + $33.60 = $53.60\n\nInput\uff1aMary wanted to earn $20 in one day.

How much is the stock worth today?\nRationales (Alternate): Firstly, we need to determine Peter's stock value after each year.\n\nHis stock value, after the 1st year is $1.10 (1.1 = 0.1 + 10%).\n\nHe bought 2 shares each year over the 2 years, so we will have $0.22 (0.2 - 0.1 + (2 * 10%)) - $0.11 (0.1 = 0+ 10%) - $20.20 = $22\n\nFor the 3rd year, we bought $22/s, $0.44 (0.4 - 0.1+ 3 * 10%) - ($0.11 + $0.22) = $24\n\nFor the 4th year, we bought $50/s, $0.(50/10) ($50/10 - 0.11 + 4 * 10% ) - $24 = $52\n\nSo $52/s, ($1.10 + (0.11 *5 + 50/2)) + (0.52 * 11%) = $62.30\n\nFor the 5th year, we bought 100/s, $62.3/s -  $32.9 = $29.4\n\nFinally, for the 6th year, we bought $(62.3 + 32.9) / s, $9", "answer": "C: every city"}
{"text": "second year, Joseph deposited $1000 in the fund at the end of the first year. Adding that to his total deposit from last year, we have $2420 + $1,000 = $3420, and we also keep the interest on that amount.\n\nSimilar to our calculation from the first year, in the second year the fund's yearly interest rate is 10%, which means applying 10% to the yearly total deposit of $3420 gives us 10% of 3420 = $348.\n\nAnd once again we add the interest to our total deposit so we know our total amount at the end of the second year. So in total we have $3420 + $348 = $3768.\n\nContinuing this pattern for a third year, Joseph deposits $102 = $2428, adds the interest, and ends the third year with an amount of $2428 + 12 = $2440.\n\nAnd this sums up the process for the whole problem. For a fourth, fifth, and sixth year, Joseph just adds the interest to the amount he deposited last year. \n\nThe final, sixth-year amount is $2440 + 12 = 2452. \n\nThe amount of money Joseph has at the end of the investment period is $2452.\nAnswer: $2452", "answer": "A: bookstore"}

After adding this, the fund totals $243.50.\n\nAt this point, we use the \"Rule of 72\" or \"Simple interest formula\" to find how long it takes to double his interest every year. This is because we multiply 72 by 24 to get 1680, the total number of dollars he will have in the fund after investing for two years. In two years, he will double his money. Therefore, if we keep adding $100 at the end of each month for the next 24 months, the fund totals and interest $69294.68.

The car is 10 years old, and in excellent condition. She used it daily and only drove it within her own city, so the mileage is low. The car's original color was red, and a specialized shop can completely repaint it. The repainting costs approximately $7000, and the car's price is $25,000. The shop offers a discount for purchasing the entire service at once. The discount allows the customer to receive two years of repaints for roughly 10% of the regular price. When selling the car, the shop will also repaint it for the purchaser. Would the friend be better off selling the car individually?\nRationales:(i) First, the buyer needs to determine whether selling the car individually is a better idea than selling the car in exchange for the repainting service plus the discount for two years.\n(ii) Since the price of purchasing the car is $25, we use the discount and find the price for the repainting and repainting service without the discount.\n(iii) $25/60 \u00d7 2 = $9 and $25 \u2212 $9 = $16.\n(iv) The buyer needs to determine the discounts and whether the discounts from selling individually are greater than the total repainting cost ($6000).\n(v) It is a better idea to sell individual to sell the car to obtain more money.

He pays $1.25 for 6 ounces of the lotion. How much does he pay for each cup full of liquid?\nRationales 1. First, we need to calculate exactly how many cups full of liquid are in an ounce.  An ounce is equal to 1.02 cups. Hence, 6 ounces is equal to 6 * 1.02 = 6.1 cups full of liquid.\n2. Second, we need to calculate how much an ounce costs. To do so, we divide the total cost of the lotion by the number of cups available in one ounce. \nIn this case, the total cost of the lather is 1.25, and the number of cups in one ounce is 1.02, so divide those two numbers to get 1.25 / 1.02 or 1.23 cups. \n\nIn other words, we can buy 6.1 cuppers of lotion for 1.23 dollars.

This is because the cost is based on six people.\nThe cost of the two meal options is: $45 (6 people) + 25% of the difference ($45 - $32) = $145.\nWe calculate the difference in cost which is $32 - $45 = -$13. So the discount is 50% of the cost, or -$6.5.\nThe total cost is $45 (6) + $145 + (-$6.5) = $161.5.\nWe check that this is right by substituting 6 for x and 12 for y.\nAnswer: 6\n\n\n\n1.

Multiplying this with the initial amount gives us a discount of $8.40, or 10% of 84.00 which is the initial amount spent on school supplies.\n\n2 : From here, we find that for every dollar spent on school supplies, $1.00 is earned from the discount, therefore for every $10.00 spent on the school supplies, $10.0 is received from the discount.\n\n3 : From here we can determine that $10.0 can purchase $1.0289 in goods.

If last year it used 60 bottles per year per customer, and the customer count increased by 40% this year, how many bottles of tomato ketchup will they need to stock this year?\nRational: To estimate the number of ketchup bottles they will need this year, we need to know the amount of customers who will need those bottles. \n\nIn the first year (before the price increase), there were 40 customers buying ketchup each, with each customer buying on average 60 bottles a year (12 bottles a month). \n\nIn the second year, if the customer count increased by x% (40%), then there will be y customers. And, since each customer will continue to purchase 60 bottles (12 bottles each month).  40 * 60 bottles = 2400 bottles.\n\nSince it is a grocery store, it offers several different types of ketchup.

If two customers purchase 17 items and the other three customers purchase 8 items each, how many dollars will the grocery store receive in total? What is the difference between the total amounts received by the two customers who bought the most items?\nRationales In order to simplify the problem, since the question only mentions discount, it can be assumed that the 17 items each get a 'one dollar' discount and that the 'one dollar' is only mentioned for the two customers purchasing 17 items \n\nWe know that these two customers pay for a total of 17 items each. This means that they each get a 'one dollars discount' and they pay a total of 16 dollars for the 17 items.\n\nOn this line of thought, the next question asks how much the grocery store receives in total. To find this value, we need the amount the three different customers pay and the amount the grocery store gets back in return.

The interest earned is $1200*0.1 = $120, and adds up to $100 in his account.\n\nIn the fourth year he adds $1256 to the account; thus, the earning is $1256 * 0.1 = $ 125.6. \nWe can proceed with this formula for each year, as it is easy to see if that $2420 is correct through the rest of the first year, the sum doesn't change due to the simple equation $2430 + $100. \nAfter 2 years, he has added $6156 (2420) to his account.

Please complete the task.\n\n### Input:\n  You need to calculate the amount that you would receive if you paid $2 in the first week, $3 in the second week, and $4 in the third week. \n  You also need to divide the amount in a given week by the sum of the amounts for all previous weeks. \n  You add a sum of the amounts that you receive in all four weeks. \n\n### Demostration:\nInput: Jack and Iris go to their local gas station three times per week to pay for gas. \nThe cost of gas per week is Jack's gas is $5 more than Iris's.\nIf Jack spends $20 the first night and Iris spends $80 the second night, how much does Iris spend the third night?\nRationales The first step is to find the amount that Iris spends.\nThe amount Iris spends is $80 + (Jack's gas - Iris's gas).   $80 + (5 + Jack's gas - Iriras gas) = $80 + 4*Jack's gas = $80 + Jack's gas.\n\nSince Jack's gas is 5 more than Iris, we can then subtract Jack's gas from $120 and get $-120 - 5 = -125. The amount Iris spends the second night then is $80 + -125 = - $45. The third night Iris spends is 40 dollars.\nThe first week, Jack spends $25. The second week, I", "answer": "D: make payments"}
{"text": "second year, he ends up with $2420 + $1200, which amounts to $3620.\n\nTherefore, he accumulates a total of $3620 in his fund after two years.\nAnswer: 3620\n\nInput: Kelsey earned $13.50 for every hour that she worked and $18.50 for every Friday that she worked. For how many hours did she work this week if her paycheck was $349.50?\nRationales : 1. First, we have to find how much worked did she earn in an hour by dividing $13.5 by $18.5 and multiplying the answer with the total hours worked in a week.\n349.5 / 2 = 174.75, which means she earned $174.7 (rounded to 174) for every hours she worked in this week.\n2. Secondly, the number of Fridays she worked is multiplied with her weekly earnings and added with the number of non-Friday hours she worked to determine her weekly payment.\n174 * 7 (number of Fridays in a week) + 53 (working 53 hours on non-Fridays) = 1212, with decimal rounding applied.\nHence, she earned $349.70 this week for her work.\nAnswer: 696.50\n\nInput: Every 30 minutes that Maria worked she earned $7, while every 45 minutes she worked she earned $24. How much did she earn working for 8 hours?\nRationales 1. Maria is in a shift that consists of 4 periods of 30 minutes and 2 periods of 45 minutes. Working for those periods adds up to 8 hours. \n\n2. Each period Maria earns $7 or $24, which gives her a total of $56 for her 3-hour periods or $56 * 3(h) = $168 for her work shift.\n3. At the end of her shift, Maria earns a total of $168, 1.5 times her total earnings from a single day she works.\nAnswer:", "answer": "B: buy"}
{"text": "second year, he deposits his new total $2420 + ($10 * 12), which equals $2520.\n\nSince Joseph's fund offers a yearly percentage rate of 10%, 10 % of $2520 is 0.10 * $2520 = $252. Once again, we add that to his deposit over the previous year to find his final balance. Joseph has $2520 + $252 = $2772.\n\nFinally the problem asks us how much money he has after two years. The amount will be the total of his annual deposits over the two years, $2420 and $2520, which is $4940. So Joseph has $4940 after two years.\nAnswer: 348\n\nInput: Ava has $1,500 and buys 275 books and 415 shirts. Calculate the cost of each item.\nRationales: We multiply Ava\u2019s $1,50,00 with the amount sold, which is 275 books times 5, and 415, which equals $11,500, and then we divide that amount by $1,50 to get the cost of each item with the $1,50 as the denominator.\nSolution: Ava has $8 books, which at $11 each, is $88. She has 3,475 shirts, which sell at $10 each, and then $3,475 divided by $88 is 39.\nAnswer: 9.5\n\nInput: If the base of a triangular pyramid with 6 sides has height 31 less than the square that the pyramid just cuts off, find the height.\nRationales : The first thing we note is that the base of each triangle is the same and is 6.\n\nThe formula of a right triangle is: \n[height of right triangle]/[the adjacent side] = [the oppsite side].\n\nAlso the base of the square has a hypotenuse [a side opposite to the right angle] = 0.\nThen to find the height, we use the right triangle formula and", "answer": "C: friend's house"}

As an example, "count" will return 3 if it receives the list [[1,2],[3,4]] and an additional condition such as itemType == (1 or 3).<n><n>### Example:<n><n>* count([1, 2, 3, 5, 7],[1 or 2]) Output: 3<n>* count([1,2,3,4,5],["2", 1]) Output: 2<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>   1. First, parse the input array. (In this case, the array we used contains strings, not integers.)<n>   2. Next, sort the items.<n>	2.1 If the array of length k has k1 integer items and k2 non-integer items, then sort the integer portion of the array (since integers can be compared). If all items are integers, simply sort them from low to high. So, since this time we have only items with type == 1 or 3, we use a list comprehension to produce all items with type == 3.<n>	4. The list comprehension then will use the items in the array as indexes to the count function.<n>	5. Finally, output the number we got from this function call.<n><n>### Instruction:  Write a Python function named "average" that takes an array of objects (integers or strings), as input, and returns the average of all items. Example:<n><n>```<n>average([1,2,4]) =2.33333<n>```<n><n>### Instinct:<n><n>```python<n># Average is the average<n>def average(item):<n>    sum, count = 0, 0<n>    # Integers as input<n>    for i in item:<n>        if isinstance(i,int):<n>            sum += i<n>            count += 1<n>    # If not integers<n>    for i in range(1,len(item)):<n>        if isinstance([i],str):<n>            temp = len(item) - 1<n>            sum += [i]<n>            count +=

After that the class should set the name with the string parameter.  Next the player should implement the addScore method which should return the player’s total score,  the multiplyScore method should return the value obtained by multiplying the player’s total points by the float parameter.  The class should override this from this point and the the __repr__ method, which should give the representation of the instance like the value in the console like this(54,46,score) for someone named James with a score of 46, 54.  Also, make sure to add self.score if you don’t have it already and remember to add self to every method you override<n><n>### Instrument:create two methods that accepts an int parameter.

Therefore,<n>the cost of 3 and 2.5 is $36. <n><n>Now for the second instruction,<n>if he lifts weight for 3 times,<n>and he spends 3 times of 45 minutes <n>to lift weight and do other exercises,<n>thus how many hours he go to gym a week? It is 38.5.<n><n>Third instruction:<n>If the fuel is increased by 20% and 2 extra tank,<n>then he probably has to pay 440.<n>In the answer it is D.<n><n>Forth instruction:<n>From this instruction I know there are 2 choices "A" and "D".<n>But then I realize there is also "E" for "office building"<n>So "A" and "E" must be correct choices as well.<n><n>If you noticed, there are only one "A", only one "B",<n>one "C" and one "D".<n>One of the trick of this game is that we need to<n>know the answer for each instruction first,<n>and we'll know

If you post complete, but minimal working code, you can see an explanation of how to get help with a homework assignment: [ask] If it isn't homework, we'd rather you didn't post a code dump with no explanation. You get better answers if you edit your question to include what *you* attempted so far. See: [How to Ask]<n><n>Comment: @MikeCarey, i don't want to make my code dump as homework, i am trying to ask what i have tried so far<n><n>Comment: What have you tried so far to answer the four given sample problems? How far did you get with them, and which parts are stumping you? Those 4 problems would all require a very different approach, in which case you wouldn't use the same code for each one. And, with only 4 problems, I don't see a code dump as being an issue here.<n><n>Comment: @JesseBarnes: To get a good response to your questions, you should write in proper English (i.e., with proper capitalization and punctuation). If you can write in "your own words", you should be able to write in coherent English. You should also have attempted to solve each of the four problems yourself, with a minimum of explanation—you should **have an attempt, and ask for help making it correct,** which you are not doing. People will often answer such requests by showing you how they get the correct answer, but will not answer by showing you what's wrong with your attempt.<n><n>Comment: It is a homework.<n><n>Comment: Well, then explain what you'd like us to do—what's wrong with your working code?

There is a lot of talent here, but many people are not aware of all the jobs, degrees and careers out there. When I was 15 I built a website for a school project with the help of a friend. I got so addicted I started learning how to code by myself, using free open source online resources. After a year or two I got into some programming jobs where I was a junior programmer for several years. I found a lot of satisfaction in building software that people actually used. Software has a very big potential to change how people live.<n><n>As a hobby, I started coding tutorials and exercises for beginners. I thought it would help more people become programmers and then, maybe, more people could get a job in the field.

You can answer 6/7 of the questions just by parsing them. <n><n>However, for number 4, you have to write a recursive solution and work through it to know that this is just a case of working through the recursion and then taking the time to evaluate the answer you're coming up with, in order to understand that this problem is trivial. <n><n>### Answers<n><n>The solution is `1`, as `20%` is `0.2` and `0.4` (`2 times 0.2`) is the answer you're looking for. <n><n>The second one, this is a problem which was solved in the previous lesson, `1.3.3`, if you're interested in the solution.  In essence, you divide the total number of goals by the number of players and then find out how many goals each player scored by subtracting the number of goals you have left to find from the number of goals that the other player scored, since the other player scored exactly that number of goals as well. `300 - 150/(2 - 1) = 30.`<n><n>The third one, this requires you to find two places that make sense together, since the second item isn't part of the first, which leaves us with B, C, and E.  So all the choices are wrong expect for B. <n><n>The first one is a little more tricky, it has to do with finding the `time` inside the `time + temperature` range, since `time + temperature` takes a temperature of about `24 hours`. The key is that the temperature `1 hour` after the time is the same as the temperature `1 hour + 1 hour`, which means you should be thinking about `time + 1 hour` and `time + 2 hour`. That, along with the fact that you have to work into a range of temperatures you have available, makes this solution `1`, as `1 + 1 = 2`. <n>

Option C is missing numbers 2 and 17 and has a total of 4 options where it is not possible to count the number of times a number appears, so this is the correct one. Option A is missing the numbers 11, 12 and 17, and there are a total of 4 times where it is also impossible to count the number of options, so this is also correct.<n>Solution Option B.(Arithmetic)<n>Solutions: To reach the correct solution we need to count how many times the number of options in question B is divided by 5 and by 4.The options with 5/4 and 4/5 do not work in option B,so we eliminate them.<n>Solution option D(Time & Relative)<n>Solution: We cannot solve this question with algebra, and we cannot eliminate an option with arithmetic.

The basketball is worth 3 points. The basketball is 3 feet wide. How many inches are in a basketball?<n>Output: 24<n><n>Input: Adam has 1 orange, 2 apples, and 3 pears. Each fruit has a certain value. The oranges are worth $1.5 each, the apples are worth $1 each, and the pears are worth $1 each. You start with Adam, and each turn, decide if you’d like to trade fruits.  If you do, each fruit you’re trading is worth its value at that time of trade. For example, if Adam gives one of his oranges to you, you only get to choose to trade it back  (because the orange would be worth $1 after trading it back). You get $1.5 if you trade it back. Otherwise, you can trade it to another player in the game. You can only trade to one person at a time, and you could trade to yourself. The turn order depends on the first trade of each player. The 8th player to trade gets the 4th turn of the game. At the end of the game, whoever has most money wins. The value of a fruit is only known to its owner. Each trade ends with both people revealing their values. In the given example, if Adam had only one orange, that orange would be worth more than if he had three oranges.<n><n>Input: In a game of Monopoly, it takes an average of 43 moves for a player to  “Buy Park Place and Boardwalk”.<n><n>	Input: In a game, you roll 1 die, 2dice, or 5dice.<n>	Output: <n><n><n>Input: A man has three boxes of nails, each containing 27 nails.

Choices:  A: oklahoma B: university C: college campus D: players E: yard<n>Output:		C<n><n><n>#### Solution<n>For question 1, there are two different prices for nuts and two different prices for fruits. Therefore, there are four different items, Adam paid for. So, the answer is 4.<n>For the second problem, there are 3 weightlifting sessions and 3 gym visits so the answer is 6. In this case, there are 4 different gym visits, and James used the extra tank for fuel. So, the answer for fuel cost is 50. Since players have different numbers of goals, we subtract 10, and divide the result by 2 to get the number of goals scored. This answer would be rounded up to the nearest integer, so the answer is 28. For the last question, the answer should be E because the question specifically mentions the football field and the only acceptable answer is a college campus that is within the specified area. That answer is rounded up to the next integer and so the answer becomes A.<n>

For example, "7x9" indicates that the rectangle is 7 units wide and 9 units tall. Your task is to determine the surface area and volume of a rectangle. The surface area is defined as the width times the length plus four times the width times the height, which is how much of the rectangle the four "sides" of the square take up. The volume is the length times the width times the thickness, and the thickness will be one if the rectangle is a square. For squares that are not defined with any additional units, as in "8", the thickness is one.

This is to check which of the 5 lines to print, and is to ensure that only one of the 5 lines is printed per game.<n>	- For the second part, it is important to understand exactly how the formula is being calculated. The first three lines do not factor in the number of players, so it does not matter how many players are playing.<n>	- For 300 questions, the answer will always stay a constant of 30<n>	- The correct answer is not related to any particular line's inputs. The code should always print the same answer line regardless of players, which is why we need to know exactly how the original code decides on who to print.<n>- Tips<n>	- 1. Create a list that stores input objects. Store the inputs from lines 4 and 5 in that list, and for the second part, the user can input a line in as a string instead (in this case, user input is not stored, but simply is interpreted using a number as the value for that line)<n>	- 2. This question requires you to be thorough in understanding exactly how the original code makes its decision. If you can do that, the process is much simpler and more straightforward than it may seem at first glance.<n>- Solution<n>	- 1, Lists that store the inputs from lines 1 and 2, and from lines 4 and line 5.<n>	- 2, Code for solving 300 questions - loop from 1 to 300<n>		- 1.

Choices:  A: house B: den C: family room D: wood E: floor<n>Output:		d<n>```<n><n>#### Solution<n><n>1. In order to know how long each day's workout lasts, we first need to know what activities John has and how much time he spends doing each.  In the previous question, 1 hour each day was spent weighlifting, and 1/3 of that 4 hours was also spent exercising to warm up and do cardio.  This accounts for a total of 4 hours spent exercising a day.<n><n>2. To find out how much money was spent on his items, we need to calculate how many buckets of foods Adman bought.  We know that nuts = 3, and dried fruit = 2.5 and the price of each one.  From there, we can find out that he spent $45.30 on food, and we need to add it into the total cost of his purchase.<n><n>```swift<n>func calculateWeeklyWeightWorkouts() -> Int {<n>    let gym = Gym()<n><n>    return gym.getHoursSpentEachWeek()<n>}<n>```<n><n>3. The next three problems are similar. We can apply the same strategy for all three of them.<n>

How much is the smallest shed Amy can build?<n>Output: 160<n><n>Input: Amy is doing a project and finds that her shed costs half of the amount of sand than cement used because cement is twice as heavy than sand.

It meant that each ton of sand weighed the same as 1.5 tons of cement.<n>The weight of a shed is an integral. 4/3t^2 + 1 = x, where t is the weight. 3/5t + 1 = 50/15. We would subtract 1 from each side and then do it to the right side. So we get (-2/5t) = 50/30. This is the integral of (-2/5t). (

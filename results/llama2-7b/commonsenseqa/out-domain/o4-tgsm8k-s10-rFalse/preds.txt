The car only has 90,000 miles on it but the transmission has been a problem. So I really want to get top dollar for the car. I am not too worried about how clean the car looks, all I care about is how big a chunk of cash I can get when I trade it in. My friend's car that is about the same year as mine has a transmission that is in really good condition. His car has also been for 100,000 more miles than my car so I am sure I can get more money for mine if I show the sales person of how bad the one I have is. The sales person asks me for $8500 and says I would do better to drive it in on my own.

You use two arrays for storing the list of `objects` and the year each `object` was born.<n>To check if the year specified by the user exists in one of the arrays you first need to loop through every item of each array until the year we're looking for has been found. If we only want to check if it exists in one of the years and not the other we can use a `for-if` with an index and use the current index of the `for-if` to check in our arrays. If we want to check both arrays we would use a nested for-if.<n>If it exists, we update the element with the date stored on it with the value from the `birthYear`. If it doesn't exist we'll create a new element by calling the `addObject` method and assign it the `name` and `birthyear`.<n><n>### Question:How do we check if the year exists in both Arrays?<n><n>### Answer:<n>```js<n>const bday = () => {<n>  let bday = new Array;<n>  let year = new Array;<n>  <n>  let add = () => {<n>    bday.push({<n>      name: this.year.name,<n>      birthYear: this.year.birthYear<n>    });<n>    year.push(this.year.birthyear);<n>  }<n>  <n>  // for-if check if year exists on both arrays<n>  for (let i = 0; i < bday.length; i++) {<n>    for (let j = 0; j < year.length; j++) {<n>      if (bday[i].birthYear === year[j]) {<n>        console.log('yea');<n>        console.log(bday[i].name);<n>        add();<n>        break;<n>      }<n>    }<n>  } <n>};<n>```<n>### Part B<n>```js<n>const year = [];<n>for (let i = 1901; i > 1999; i = i +

It requires you to write a function, which I enjoy doing, that can accept a variety of data and produce a variety of answers. It is not always easy to make the solution as robust as the author intended but I think I did a decent job at it. The problem was made more difficult (and therefore more fun) by the restrictions included. You have to think about each decision carefully to get the right answer. The goal of the program is to make it easy for a beginner to solve without requiring you the reader to have an advanced level of programming knowledge. The problem is to understand the task, create a solution, and test the functionality. <n>

He was able to reason by considering information separately, and then combining the information to come to an informed answer.<n><n>This time we will see examples where the student may not be able to answer these questions, due to the lack of background knowledge, or a different perspective on what is required for the question.<n>After the student reads the examples let them read the tips and give feedback as required.<n><n>Tips:<n>* Read the question and understand what the question is asking.<n>* Gather all the information you can from the question.<n>* Decide how this information relates to each other.<n>* Analyse how the information relates and then how you can combine the information to solve the question.<n>* Check you have answered the question correctly.<n><n>In the third example "Answers: 30", the student has chosen "D". This is not the correct answer. Although, there is some reasoning in coming to this decision I must explain why this is not the correct answer and guide the student in how to read a more sophisticated question and answer.<n><n>Reasoning: I see a logical argument to support the decision of "D", however this answer is incorrect due to the use of commas; I expect a comma when the answer is not exact to the question. For this question, the answer is expected to be "death", as all the elements have been included in the list provided; however "D, E: get hurt", is incorrect.<n><n>I would expect the student to select "B" in the first question, and then, for the same reason, "A" in the second question.<n><n>In these two questions there are more than two options, so the student would not just choose one option, but then another from a separate list, which would be another option. An example of this would be for "Answers: B, C or D". They are all incorrect as the question requires one answer.<n><n>In the "Answers: D" the list given is incomplete, I would expect more than two answers to be included; as it stands, the student could argue their point (this answer does not require 2 options but one, but does not give a definitive answer of how many to expect).<n>Ens

Choices:  A: vessel B: box C: transistor D: submarine E: lamp<n><n>### Response:		<n>C<n><n>* What kind of radio does someone who wants to reach base use?  The answer, obviously, must be either a radio or a box.  The box is excluded because of the rule "A box has to have four sides to be described."<n><n>### Input<n>* How many feet did the boxer kick in his fight last night?  What was that answer?<n><n>### Response<n>* The answer should be 5, right?  The foot has 5 toes, each of which is one unit.  Therefore one foot is 5 units.  The foot is 12 inches or 1200th of a meter, so 2.54 meters is 2540 feet, and of course 5/2.46 meters is 2.045 meters.  So, 2540 divided by 2045 is 250/205, which, rounded off to the tenth number, is 5.0.

In 1854, The French government adopted a new constitution which limited the autonomy of its colonies. The United States of America had a long history of secession, and there were numerous minor uprisings during that period. The French Constitution had very restrictive clauses compared with the United States Constitution's much more flexible stipulations.<n>The colonies were not the only targets of the revolutionaries. For example, American soldiers had a much more difficult time defeating the Native Indians. There are many different types of colonies, with different colonies having entirely different systems of government. Not all colonies were created equal, and this is especially true when it comes to foreign colonies. The United Kingdom of Great Britain, also known as the United Kingdom in the North and South, controlled colonies all over the world. It was a huge, powerful empire that included all of North America, as well as much of Central and South America. The colonies in North America were known as the northern colonies. They were established by the British and the French. After the colonization of North America, many Americans moved to the northern colonies.<n>### Response to France and US Constitution: <n><n>## Requirements:<n>* A good response should be grammatically correct and express complete sentences.<n>* A good response must utilize proper grammar, sentence structure, capitalization, and punctuation.<n>* A good answer will utilize the code of conduct.<n><n># Author<n><n>## By Brenna L.<n><n>## Version 1

If you go to a movie theatre, you won't find fashioned clothes there. They're usually movies, popcorn eating or cokes, not that expensive clothes. But if you go to a mall, you might actually find a good quality and more expensive clothes.<n><n>2. If you go to mall, you might find the things that I have just said. But if the clothes are really expensive, there should be a higher level shop. But if you go a department store, everything is there and they must be good also. But they're not more expensive than malls. The only place from where you can get a good quality stuff with no price compromise is a shop.<n><n># B: mall<n><n>1. If the prices they're selling are relatively high, there might be a chance that you can find the one or the other person who doesn't buy it.<n><n>2. They're not low or middle level, not for sure. But if we consider the one or other person who don't buy the clothes from there, they must be higher level.<n><n># C: department store<n><n>1. If we keep everything else as I said about the shop, we're done. Because there might not be a difference in the price between those places and shops have a different target group.<n><n>2. Department stores are a little harder to answer because there could be a higher level of everything, and if some brand is more expensive, 7-8 others could be much more expensive. <n><n>### Input.<n><n><n>Input: What is the fastest way to go by plane from London to Oslo?

Choices:  A: street B: binder C: obesity D: living room E: office suite<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>**O**<n><n>## Output:<n><n><n>*What divider stores papers?<n><n>## Input:<n><n>**A**<n><n>## Output answer:<n><n><n>A:Street<n><n>## Answer Explanation:<n><n>To determine whether the answer to the question “What divider store papers?” is “A street”, “B: Binder”, “C: Obesity”, “D: Living room”, “E: office suite”, we must look at two components of the answer—“divider” and “paper”. These components are written in the language of an NL Tool—that is, in the language of the tool that we are designing—and must have a corresponding component structure in Haskell. For example, “street” and “street papers” have the same component structure: “street”.<n><n>It is not necessary for a component to match the pattern of the question, or for the sentence to be grammatical; the component is a match for the question if it contains one component that matches the pattern of the question and has one component that has a semantic match (that is, the component’s meaning is not just a word, but a noun phrase, a phrase or one of multiple options).<n><n>In this case, it makes sense to match on multiple components. The question is:<n><n>> What divider store paper?<n><n>The answer “street” is acceptable because “street” is a valid answer when the question is “What divider store paper”.<n><n>The answer “A street” is not possible when the question is “*What divider store paper” because “divider” is not present in the question.<n><n>```haskell<n>answer : String -> [String]<n>answer = map answerComponent. getAnswerComponents<n>```<n><n>`hasMatching` checks only 2 components of the answer—"divider" and "paper"—in order to test whether the sentence is a valid, complete answer to the question.<n><n>The answer component, in this case "street" (since "street" is a valid answer to "What divider store paper?"), indicates that "street" stores papers. "street" is a component of "A street paper", and since "street" is a noun phrase, it is also a component. So the answer to the question is "A street" because it has the matching components from 2 separate answer components.<n><n>##

Choices:  A: side B: main C: anterior D: current E: front<n><n>### Response:		A. C.<n><n>### The Solution<n>The response that the user expects for the first question is the answer to that question. <n>The user expects the answer to be one of the choices provided, but you can also make up other choices if you want to provide more difficult questions.  You can read more about this [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_choice).<n><n>The second question demonstrates how you can use conditionals to provide different answers to different prompts. <n>The only way to get the correct answer by entering `A`, `D` or `I` is to enter `B`.<n><n>To answer the third question correctly, use the same approach. <n>Use `if` and `else` to check which option the user has entered and provide the correct answer.  It is the inverse of the previous question: you want to give your users the wrong answer if they enter `A` `D` or `E`.<n><n>The fourth question depends on a series of if loops and `goto`s.  The first time the user visits they will never answer `E`, but when they return, the program will ask them to.  If they select `E` for the first time, they get sent to a loop where you ask them a series of questions to get to `A`.<n><n>In this question you can see the `switch` statement and how it can work with `if`.  The function `chooseChoice()` is a little tricky, it checks all the possible options so it only takes a couple of lines. <n><n>Note that there are two different types of `goto`: jumps and executions. <n>The `goto` in this question is an execution, meaning you can go back from whichever direction but only to that direction because you cannot go back to the statement that came before that point. <n>

If the man was rushing to get weight, he would not have heartburn. You are missing something simple in the question, and did not use a single keyword from it. Try adding details in your response (i.e. late, late for work, got heartburn, had lunch, etc).<n><n>The second response is also correct. It does exactly what it is supposed to. But you can simplify your algorithm to take advantage of the input type.<n><n><n>### Input1: <n>Input2: "It was 30 degrees Fahrenheit, and the temperature was rising."<n>```<n>If the temperature was 90 degrees, what was the temperature 5 minutes ago.<n>```<n><n>### Response1:<n>Temperature was 85 degrees.<n><n>### Response2:<n>The correct answer should be `30`. When there is an operation such as "and" in between two numbers, it is easy to assume that the second number is negative. But the operation is not negative. It is a mathematical operation. If you go by the mathematical symbol, you may get the answer as correct.<n><n>```<n>1.  temperature is rising = positive<n>2.  it was 30 degrees = negative<n>3.  negative + positive = positive.<n>4.  final answer = positive<n>```<n>Note: the second response should be an equation instead of a statement. "And" is a mathematical operation, so you cannot assume that it is negative.<n><n>There is more than one solution though. Check if your solution has the second response as an equation.

It is always better to know what is wrong with the car before you go underneath the car as you can then be more cautious.

Choices: A: competency B: sticker C: intellectual challenge D E<n><n>### Instructions: Answer the following question.<n><n>## Description: <n><n>A person is considered competent in their schoolwork if they are given the choice of answering a question to get a reward.  A reward is a sticker, compliment, passing grade or avoidance of pain.  If a person is competent in their schooling, they would be expected to have a passing grade.<n><n>### Input (Test):<n><n>A person takes a college exam.  The following percentages represent the probabilities of getting these:<n><n>Getting a sticker has a 65% chance of a passing grade.  Getting a compliment has 73% chance of a passing a grade.  Getting a A grade has a 46% chance of a passing the exam.  A passing grade is 95% likely to be a B grade or above.  A person being competent in their school has a 80% chance of getting a sticker, 75% chance of getting a compliment and 60% chance of getting an A grade.  A student that is not competent in their school will have a 60% chance, 70% chance and 75% chance.<n><n>### Output:<n><n>The person is not competent in school.<n><n>### Explanation<n><n>If a sticker gets a passing grade with 65% certainty, a compliment gets a passing grade with a 73% certainty, and a A grade gets a passing grade with only a 46% certainty, then a person who is competent in school will have a 32% chance of getting a passing grade with the sticker.  A person who is not competent only has a 21% chance of getting a B grade or a higher grade.  It follows that the person is not competent because they have a 21% / 32% chance and a 29% / 28% chance, respectively.<n><n>### Analysis: <n><n>The key concept to solving this problem is to figure out why it is better to get a sticker than a compliment for a person who is competency in their school work.

Let's say there are a lot of dishes left for washing. To find the answer, we need to use all the clues given.<n><n>The clues are:<n>| Dishes/underwear | Bigger family | Less dishes |<n>| Breakfast is eaten together with family | 30% of people have breakfast with a large family | 1 in 3 people don’t eat breakfast with a large family. |<n>| Fullness/Better day | When you eat breakfast with a big family it makes you feel fuller but it's not as beneficial as eating breakfast alone because it may have the same effect as bad breath, however you also receive better days.<n>| Dishes/Badbreath | No good things come from having a big breakfast with family | No good days come from having a big family.<n>| Underwear/Dirty Dishes | Having a big breakfast with family is not a good idea for your mouth | Having a big breakfast is not a very good idea for your mouth.<n><n>So we need to use the clues to determine that the least percentage of people who eat breakfast with a large amount of family is 30%.<n><n>Therefore, The most percent of people who eat breakfast alone is 70%.<n><n>It is important to make an objective description of the given context rather than express personal opinions.<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>Input: James is from an average family which typically eats breakfast together.

He would prefer it if his family didn’t eat together.<n>The clues are :<n><n>```<n>Dishes/underwear - 40% of people have eaten breakfast with their families, but not always - sometimes they eat alone.<n><n>Breakfast is eaten together - it's 30% of the people who usually stay together for family breakfast.<n><n>Fullness/Better day - The breakfast makes you feel full and satisfied, but you also need your own time.<n><n>Dishes/Badbreath - It would be unpleasant to be at home and have too many people for breakfast.<n><n>Underwear/Dirty

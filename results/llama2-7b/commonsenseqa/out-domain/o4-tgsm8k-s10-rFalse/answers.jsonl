As an example, \"count\" will return 3 if it receives the list [[1,2],[3,4]] and an additional condition such as itemType == (1 or 3).\n\n### Example:\n\n* count([1, 2, 3, 5, 7],[1 or 2]) Output: 3\n* count([1,2,3,4,5],[\"2\", 1]) Output: 2\n\n### Explanation:\n\n   1. First, parse the input array. (In this case, the array we used contains strings, not integers.)\n   2. Next, sort the items.\n\t2.1 If the array of length k has k1 integer items and k2 non-integer items, then sort the integer portion of the array (since integers can be compared). If all items are integers, simply sort them from low to high. So, since this time we have only items with type == 1 or 3, we use a list comprehension to produce all items with type == 3.\n\t4. The list comprehension then will use the items in the array as indexes to the count function.\n\t5. Finally, output the number we got from this function call.\n\n### Instruction:  Write a Python function named \"average\" that takes an array of objects (integers or strings), as input, and returns the average of all items.

The constructor should take in the name of the type of player.  The name parameter should the be String containing the name of the type foe.e. a string like James, Jhonny, or A, B, C.  After that the class should set the name with the string parameter.  Next the player should implement the addScore method which should return the player\u2019s total score,  the multiplyScore method should return the value obtained by multiplying the player\u2019s total points by the float parameter.  The class should override this from this point and the the __repr__ method, which should give the representation of the instance like the value in the console like this(54,46,score) for someone named James with a score of 46, 54.  Also, make sure to add self.score if you don\u2019t have it already and remember to add self to every method you override\n\n### Instrument:create two methods that accepts an int parameter.

A class is an abstraction of real world object. An object is an instance of the class. Once you define a class, you can create instances of that class.\nEvery class should have a constructor, and at a minimum the __init__ method. The class constructor invokes the __init__ method with no parameters when a new object of that class is being instantiated. \n\n\n```python\nclass Player:\n\n    def __init__(self,", "answer": "E: score points"}

Therefore,\nthe cost of 3 and 2.5 is $36. \n\nNow for the second instruction,\nif he lifts weight for 3 times,\nand he spends 3 times of 45 minutes \nto lift weight and do other exercises,\nthus how many hours he go to gym a week? It is 38.5.\n\nThird instruction:\nIf the fuel is increased by 20% and 2 extra tank,\nthen he probably has to pay 440.\nIn the answer it is D.\n\nForth instruction:\nFrom this instruction I know there are 2 choices \"A\" and \"D\".\nBut then I realize there is also \"E\" for \"office building\"\nSo \"A\" and \"E\" must be correct choices as well.\n\nIf you noticed, there are only one \"A\", only one \"B\",\none \"C\" and one \"D\".\nOne of the trick of this game is that we need to\nknow the answer for each instruction first,\nand we'll know", "answer": "E: office building"}

{"text": "B\n\n[Source](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/multiple-choice-quiz/0) \n\n### Submissions\n\nSolutions, links, and explanations are presented below.\n\n### Approach\n\nThis is a simple question, and you can tell what's going on by reading it slowly. You can answer 6/7 of the questions just by parsing them. \n\nHowever, for number 4, you have to write a recursive solution and work through it to know that this is just a case of working through the recursion and then taking the time to evaluate the answer you're coming up with, in order to understand that this problem is trivial. \n\n### Answers\n\nThe solution is `1`, as `20%` is `0.2` and `0.4` (`2 times 0.2`) is the answer you're looking for. \n\nThe second one, this is a problem which was solved in the previous lesson, `1.3.3`, if you're interested in the solution.  In essence, you divide the total number of goals by the number of players and then find out how many goals each player scored by subtracting the number of goals you have left to find from the number of goals that the other player scored, since the other player scored exactly that number of goals as well. `300 - 150/(2 - 1) = 30.`\n\nThe third one, this requires you to find two places that make sense together, since the second item isn't part of the first, which leaves us with B, C, and E.  So all the choices are wrong expect for B. \n\nThe first one is a little more tricky, it has to do with finding the `time` inside the `time + temperature` range, since `time + temperature` takes a temperature of about `24 hours`. The key is that the temperature `1 hour` after the time is the same as the temperature `1 hour + 1 hour`, which means you should be thinking about `time + 1 hour` and `time + 2 hour`. That, along with the fact that you have to work into a range of temperatures you have available, makes this solution `1`, as `1 + 1 = 2`.", "answer": "B: museum"}

Option A is missing the numbers 11, 12 and 17, and there are a total of 4 times where it is also impossible to count the number of options, so this is also correct.\nSolution Option B.(Arithmetic)\nSolutions: To reach the correct solution we need to count how many times the number of options in question B is divided by 5 and by 4.The options with 5/4 and 4/5 do not work in option B,so we eliminate them.\nSolution option D(Time & Relative)\nSolution: We cannot solve this question with algebra, and we cannot eliminate an option with arithmetic. So we have to take a relative choice.\nWe will only choose options that say that there is no time, so let us eliminate \"for 2", "answer": "C: jar"}

The oranges are worth $1.5 each, the apples are worth $1 each, and the pears are worth $1 each. You start with Adam, and each turn, decide if you\u2019d like to trade fruits.  If you do, each fruit you\u2019re trading is worth its value at that time of trade. For example, if Adam gives one of his oranges to you, you only get to choose to trade it back  (because the orange would be worth $1 after trading it back). You get $1.5 if you trade it back. Otherwise, you can trade it to another player in the game. You can only trade to one person at a time, and you could trade to yourself. The turn order depends on the first trade of each player. The 8th player to trade gets the 4th turn of the game. At the end of the game, whoever has most money wins. The value of a fruit is only known to its owner. Each trade ends with both people revealing their values. In the given example, if Adam had only one orange, that orange would be worth more than if he had three oranges.\n\nInput: In a game of Monopoly, it takes an average of 43 moves for a player to  \u201cBuy Park Place and Boardwalk\u201d.\n\n\tInput: In a game, you roll 1 die, 2dice, or 5dice.\n\tOutput: \n\n\nInput: A man has three boxes of nails, each containing 27 nails.

For example, \"7x9\" indicates that the rectangle is 7 units wide and 9 units tall. Your task is to determine the surface area and volume of a rectangle. The surface area is defined as the width times the length plus four times the width times the height, which is how much of the rectangle the four \"sides\" of the square take up. The volume is the length times the width times the thickness, and the thickness will be one if the rectangle is a square. For squares that are not defined with any additional units, as in \"8\", the thickness is one. So, in this case you would have to answer for a rectangle that is 8 units on each side and 8 units tall.\n\n### Input Examples:\n\n\"\"7x9\"\" = surface area: 63    volume: 61 \n\n\"\"10x20x3\"\" = surface area/90 volume: 1800\n\n\n### Instruction:\nAns:\n\n```python\ndef solution(line):\n    temp = line.split('x')\n    length, width = temp[0].split", "answer": "B: happiness"}

This is to check which of the 5 lines to print, and is to ensure that only one of the 5 lines is printed per game.\n\t- For the second part, it is important to understand exactly how the formula is being calculated. The first three lines do not factor in the number of players, so it does not matter how many players are playing.\n\t- For 300 questions, the answer will always stay a constant of 30\n\t- The correct answer is not related to any particular line's inputs. The code should always print the same answer line regardless of players, which is why we need to know exactly how the original code decides on who to print.\n- Tips\n\t- 1. Create a list that stores input objects. Store the inputs from lines 4 and 5 in that list, and for the second part, the user can input a line in as a string instead (in this case, user input is not stored, but simply is interpreted using a number as the value for that line)\n\t- 2.

This accounts for a total of 4 hours spent exercising a day.\n\n2. To find out how much money was spent on his items, we need to calculate how many buckets of foods Adman bought.  We know that nuts = 3, and dried fruit = 2.5 and the price of each one.

Therefore, total spent is: $8/12 x 8.\n\n### Solution to question: Input: Johns...\n\n### Solution:\n\nEach day spent 1 hour for lifting weight, 1 hour for warming up and 1 hour for cardio. One hour warming up and cardio is free (cardio is free). One hour for lifting weights costs $12 (every time you lift a weight you have to pay) Total: $12 * 3,", "answer": "C: plain"}

How much is the smallest shed Amy can build?\nOutput: 160\n\nInput: Amy is doing a project and finds that her shed costs half of the amount of sand than cement used because cement is twice as heavy than sand.  How many tons of each material does she need?\nOutput: 70 33\n\n### My Comments:\n\n```\nThere was one question in which my solution was different, and I think I got that answer correct as well.\nThat question was related to cement, which weighs about 2.5 times more than sand. It meant that each ton of sand weighed the same as 1.5 tons of cement.\nThe weight of a shed is an integral. 4/3t^2 + 1 = x, where t is the weight. 3/5t + 1 = 50/15. We would subtract 1 from each side and then do it to the right side. So we get (-2/5t) = 50/30. This is the integral of (-2/5t). (", "answer": "D: every town"}

There are two horizontal shadows in this problem. First, the shadow cast by the man standing under the first tree. Second, the shadow cast by his shadow tree standing under the pond. These shadows must be 90 degrees away from each other, so their colors will be the same. The two shadows have an angle of 90 degrees, so their color must be gray, that is, grey/gray. It remains possible, however, for the man standing underneath to see a green or brown shadow on the lake. It is possible that one or both shadows is reflected into the dark pool, and the man standing under the shadows can see it.<n><n>Input: Why was the chicken cross a playground?

Be sure that the function is recursive.<n>Output: n! or factorial of n is the sum of all whole numbers from 1 to n<n>Factorial of 5:<n> 5!, or factorial of 5, equals 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1<n>The first step is to sum up the first number for which n! equals the product of 1 until the number n. Using n = 5, we can say that 5! equals 5 * 5 * 5! = 120. Since 5! is between 30 and 120, 5 * 4 equals 20 so 5 * 5 = 25.<n>Similarly at n = 7, the first number is 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 = 70 and since it is between 300 and 70, 30 > 7 * 6 > 5 * 4 > 3 * 2<n>Hence, 7!, or factorial of of 7 is 70<n><n>Input:Write an algorithm that calculates the sum of two integers.

Choices:  A: a bed of nails B: town C: attractive consistent look D: city block E: ground<n>Output:		Bob's feet are hurt because he ran barefoot on the hot and painful pavement.  At the same time, he lost his shoes which resulted in him to run as fast as possible to his home.  At the same home, he lost his shopping and didn't know where it landed.  So the final answer is D, the city block<n><n>Output: Bob'sonly 30.  So the final result is that the boy is 35 years old plus 24.5/7 = <<24.5*7=35>>35 years older than the girl. The girl is 9 years old and the answer is 35+9 = <<35+9=44>>44 years old<n><n>Input: An unidentified object fell off a space ship heading away from Earth. The scientists on Earth, assuming it was an asteroid, predicted its size by first calculating its velocity, and then using kinetic theory to derive its size.  The velocity of the object was 50 times faster than if it had a mass of 200 tons.  The scientists said it was 50 meters wide, and had a diameter 7.6 times the size of a man standing on its surface. What was its size?<n>Output: For the scientists to calculate, they used kinetic theory to derive the size of the object.  The kinetic theory uses a 50 meters wide as reference, and they used the 50 meters wide for an object with 200 tons mass and it travels 50 times faster.  After doing the calculations, we get the diameter 7.6 < x <<7.6<x>> to be 7.6 as a result for this diameter and then they used 7.6 for an object with 50 tons mass and it moves 20 time faster.  So the final equation becomes x < 20 t / 5 v =  <<20t/5=4<<4<n>

He is paid a fixed monthly salary of $2500. How many hours should John type each month to earn his salary?<n>Output: The solution is 62.5, which we calculate by multiplying 40 by $2500, then dividing that by the total number of hours (2) : $40 x $2500 / (2 x 24) = <<40 x 2500/ 2 x 24 = 12500 >>12,500  Then divide that value by 5 to get an hourly amount of 12,50 = <<12,50=25.00>>25.00 so the hourly rate would be 25.00. Multiply this value by 2 to get the total number of hours it would take to earn the salary, which is 25 x 2 = <<25 x 2=50>>50.<n>We end up with 50 / 60 = <<50/60=0.83>>0.83 of an hour = 62.5<n>So in total it would take John ~83 minutes or 1 hour and 25 minutes to earn his salar<n><n>Input:The difference in ages between William and Maria is -6 years.

Choices:  A: solidifying B: melting C: getting cold D: feeling cold E: skin rash<n>Output:		The options have two choices that say the ground is feeling cold. If the ground feels cold, then it must be frost, snow, or ice.<n>Since there are two options, that are similar in the given description of the ground feeling cold, we have to eliminate one choice. Since they were similar, we chose the least logical option which is the opposite of the given description of feelings.<n>The one option is A frost-solidifying. Frost is frozen ground.

How many books did Pablo read?<n>Output: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>So the final answer is 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Output: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input:Sam was against Allison's decision.

If Sam gets a paycheck 30 times a year, how much does he pay the nanny to watch his children 4 days a week?<n>Output: Sam pays the nanny $<<360*30/4=720>>720 per year, which is paid in 12-monthly payments = <<720/12=60>>60 per month<n>If he puts his children in daycare 4 days a week, each day of the month has 5 daycare days, so the nanny will be paid 30 days * 60 = <<30*60=1800>>1800<n>So the final answer<n><n>Input:If a store offers a 7% discount on the total bill, what is the price of a cashmere sweater that was $548 before discount?<n>Output: First to solve it, since a cashmere price is $548 before a discount, then in the final pricing, you get to subtract the discount from. Since the initial price is $549 - 7% of $549=<<549-3.89>>30 = $<<548-3.89=514.11>>514.1<n>So the final answer

Choices:  A: farmland B: neighborhood C: city D: property E: subdivision<n>Output:		The answer is B - farmland - a yard is a tiny piece of farmland.<n><n>### Solution:Answer the following multiple answer questions.<n><n>Input: A yard may be tiny. What can be said about the size of the yard in comparison with other similar properties nearby?<n>Output: Consider your answer to the first part of this question. A yard is a tiny part of a big area like farmland, but it shouldn't be considered tinly on its own.<n><n>Choices:   A: The yard remains tiny The yard becomes big The yard is now big The yard remains tiny on a smaller scale The yard is now tiny<n>Output: Consider your other answer to this question. A yard can't be considered tiny if it's on its own. The yard must be compared to farmland. If you're trying to figure out how big you are in comparison to a farmer in a different state, the yard probably does not seem so tiny, but you would still be tiny compared to your neighbor who has a ranch.<n><n>Input: When thinking of your own small yard, who might live on the other side?<n>Output: When you're thinking about your own yard, consider answering the second part of the first question. You can be big on a tiny scale, but if you think about the yard compared to the rest of the world, you are tiny. Most likely a house sits on the other side of your yard, and it might be the yard of the farmer or rancher from the last question.<n><n>Input : It is often difficult to distinguish between a yard and a property.<n>Output: Yards are often referred to as properties, but that doesn't mean they are the same. A property is normally the land without a house built on it. This makes it larger than a yard. <n><n>### Instruction:Answer the questions below.<n><n>Input: How can you tell how big you are?<n>Output: Every person will have a different height and weight, so the best way to measure one person is to compare themselves to another person. You can say you are short, tall, skinny or fat if it relates to someone else. The size of your body is usually small compared to the size of your house or your yard.<n><n>Input: Are you big in other ways?<n>Output: Maybe there are other ways that people can compare who is bigger and who is smaller.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Output: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>So the final answer is 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Output: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>So the final answer is 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Output: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input:What will all the differences equal? Choices:  A: sum B: likeness C: alike D: sameness E: similarity<n>Output:		Likeness<n>Since the word difference refers to a number of objects that is opposite of the number of objects in a group then the choices A and B don't make sense so we can ignore them.<n>As for C and D all their choices include "difference" but with a number. For example, one "difference" is a positive number while another "difference" is the reciprocal of a positive number. Therefore, the choices C and D have more similarities than the word "likeness" has with the word "difference"<n>We can ignore the choices E and F because the question is a choice of between likeness and similarity, so we do not need to factor in similarity or similarity.<n>In conclusion, if you are unsure about the correct choices then look for key words. Also, look for commonality between answer choices.<n><n>Input: If John wants to send 4 friends 15 dollars to go out for dinner, can he give them all equal amounts?<n>Output: yes<n>We can look at this problem as a set of 4 friends, with each person receiving $15. We need to make sure that this is a set with 4 elements or the total amount is greater than 4.<n>After we account for this, we are left only with the case where we are trying to calculate the number of friends to give the same amount. Since we know that one of the friends is getting $15, then three friends will get remaining amount. But if we assume that $4 is shared equally among the remaining 3, then we have $4 shared among friends who are left. So, the number of friends that get $15 will be 3, if remaining money is distributed equally among the remaining 2 friends then they will each get $4.<n>The final answer is 3<n><n>Input: If 49 is halved, what is the answer?<n>Output: 24.5<n>First, we can use 1/2(49) or 1/2 * 49 =.5*49 = 24.5 <n>Then we can use 49 = 50 - 1 = <<49=50-1>>50-1<n>So the final answer 24.5

He also makes a bet of $2000 that he'll win in 2 attempts, and if he loses, he'll pay the winner. When he's asked for numbers, he can make as many guesses as he wants at a cost of $2 per guess, but if he guesses 3 numbers and they weren't the correct one, he doesn't stop. They just double the amount for the next guess. Suppose he guesses 4912 and then 1927, then 1928. 9-912-1211-19-2828-78. What's the minimum amount that he'll have to pay the winner or lose the bet?<n>Output: Start with 4912 or 1927<n>4912 or even 1927 won't be found so he'll switch one number between 19-28 so he can find 1927 now.<n>He finds 4912 then switches to 1927 and then he pays $40 since he guessed 3 times.<n>92778 has been found, so he stops with the first guess, that was 4912.<n>Now if he had stopped with the switch, he'd have lost $80 because the 2nd guess was 9278 and the 3rd time would have been $18560 for guessing the 4th time.<n>He'll win

The number of cars on the road multiplied over the past 60 years and that has led to increased traffic congestion and in turn, that increased the chance of a crash. D<n>Toyota – The car was first introduced in 1936 and since then, it has been regarded as one of the best in terms of reliability. The design of the car and its parts were also very impressive. The car also came with the guarantee of minimum engine breakdowns and repairs. C, A and B <n>Rover – In the car making industry in England, the car was known as Rover 2000, from 1964. Although the production of the car was discontinued only in 2005, the name Rover is still recognized. However, the car was also regarded as one of those that would not make it, mostly on account of its engines breaking down and thus the owners having to make several visits to the workshop. E<n>Renault  – In 1900, the company Renault introduced the first car with four wheels – the Type A – in Paris.<n>The car was regarded as one of the most outstanding then and was able to beat the cars from Bugatti and Fiat. Despite the fact that the car had a four cylinder engine, it was still one of the first cars that were produced to the satisfaction of its owners. Renault was regarded as one of those who made their cars the best in terms of quality. B<n>Volvo – In 1970, when the Volvo was first introduced, its engine was regarded as one of its finest. The car was known as the P1800S when it was first introduced, and within a year, it became the only car that was on a list called Car of the year. Although the Volvo is not the cheapest car because of the extra options that come with it, the car is one that has been regarded as the best when it comes to safety. The car’s safety features are unmatched by most of the cars on the road. D<n>Input: A student has chosen to study one of the

What was the direction of the flight and distance flown? Choices: A: South - 200 mi B: East - 300 mi C: West - 200mi D: North - 300mi E: West - 800mi<n>Output:<n>For the first question, choose A for South.<n>To figure out the distance from SF to Denver, you can look at a map; or you can find out how many miles a plane travels per hour. For example, a plane travels 500 to 600 miles per hour. Multiply 500 by the time the plane was in the air, and divide by 60 (the inverse of hours in a minute) to get the miles per plane. Then multiply by the number of planes involved in the flight to get the miles per flight. Divide that total by the total amount of hours in the flight. Then if you know the miles per hour of the plane, you can subtract this from total flight miles for your final answer.

Choices:  A: scars B: being born C: sorrow D: misery E: kill yourself<n>Output:		The word 'when' makes it an 'if' statement, which means there will be no effect if the given condition is not fulfilled. I.e., when we commit suicide, we will be born, and we'll not have to face any effect. There can be 6 alternatives.<n>So all we will have is'suffering, being sorrowful, misery, kill yourself'.<n>And I've marked E as the answer. <n><n>### Explanation<n>We should look for the conditions that is not matched with 'when committing suicide'.<n>The 'when' will be removed by applying the word 'if': "If you commit suicide".<n>Therefore, 'if you commit suicide', you will face the effect stated, and 'If you don't commit suicide', you'll face "The word's effect stated'".<n>If you commit suicide,<n>E: kill yourself <n>"The word's effect said", which is'suffering' or 'being sorrowful' or'misery'.<n>Because of this, since we can't eliminate the word'suffering'<n>B: being sorrowful  <n>E: kill yourself<n>C is eliminated as well as D are eliminated if we include 'kill yourself'.<n>Thus, the answer is E, "kill yourself"<n><n>Input: An equation consists of a number and an equals sign.

The algorithm provides a solution that solves the problem of computing the average age given the difference of the two people ages plus their combined age. This is an attempt to develop a more efficient version of the algorithm since its original approach requires an n^2 solution since it goes over the whole array and finds average of the total array which is O(2^n). In addition, this module also computes the average age at a future given time using just the difference and age information in addition, it solves problem 9549 on leetcode.com.<n>

If x = 25, y = 30 and if y = 20. If x = 18 and y = 9. What is the value of (y-x)/2?<n>Output:This question asks to solve for x = 18 in the x and y condition as well as in the y and x condition.  In this case, x = 18 when x = y = 30.  When x = 18, y = 20 and (y-x)/5 = (20-18)/5 = <<20-18=/5=2>>2<n>So the answer to the equation y - x / 2 is 2, which answers the question of y-x/2 when y = 20<n>

So it must be either New York, Florida, or Texas, because it can't be a town, and it can't be anywhere in between, or overseas. If my brother doesn't live in New York, Florida, Tennessee, or Texas, then I will know that my brother probably must live in California. If he lives in Texas, then I will be able to determine that, but it still leaves Florida, California, Texas, New York, and Tennessee still as possibilities. If my brother lives in Florida, then I will be sure that my brother doesn't actually live in any of those places.

If my brother is in the army, then that will help me, unless he is in the other army.<n>Output: If my brother lives somewhere that is one of those stated, then it must be the other states' excluding him. He doesn't live in NY, nor CA as I said. If TN, FL, TX, not those then it must be TG, but I have said I don't know about that, and I also have said he is in the other Army, so we must assume he isn't in the US Army (as of now the other army is a mystery, I think it might be the NAVY). But if TN this will also get ruled out.

Output: First, we just calculate the cost function here is the table, $240, $225, $200, $188, $200 The average cost function is $196 so I'm going to use a tape measure to measure it. The total or sum of the average cost function is 500 + 500 + $196 + 500 I'm just going to put it together. Then again, let's try to find what's the total sum we have.

When we try to find the total energy we don't want to be left with nothing. So instead we need to leave a buffer of Energy. The total amount of energy to leave is the amount that would be leftover if we took one away. So the total would be: 100% + 0% -> 0% + 0.75% = <<01+3.75=4>>4 total energy.<n><n>Input:  You have a room with two identical beds. You need to give ten people in pairs a bed to sleep in.

His dog has eaten his beer and the man is sad. The shirt costs $9. What is the value of the shirt?<n>Output: Let the value be x. So, the price is 9. The value on the shirt is x + 9 because the man is sad about losing is beer, so, he has lost 9 x because that is how much he paid for his shirt. The value of the shirt is 9 x because the 9 represents the price of the shirt, so, 9 x is 9 times the price of the shirts. Because, 9 times 9 is 81, so, if 9 x is 81, 9 x must be 9, which is why 9 x = 9. That means that the value of the shirts is 9.<n><n>Input: In the picture above, every single ball is a certain color that’s a prime number.

If one looks at any chemical safety data sheet, they will see the first word "isopropyl", plus "alcohol", both of which refer to one of the common names for the chemical substance, so if you look for this term in a drugstore and on the Internet, you will probably get mixed terms.

The price of a blue pen is twice that of a yellow pen. If a red pen costs 120% of the price of a black pen, and the green pen costs 40% of the price for a red pen, find the price of a green pen. Round Answer to two decimal places.<n>Output: Since the percentage of green pens is 40% and it is double that of the yellow pen, it means it is half of the cost of the blue pen. This is because (120%/100%)*2 = <<120%/2*100%=60%>>60%<n>The cost of the black pen is 1/4 of the cost of the green pen. This is because 40%/10 = <<40%/1>>4<n>So the cost of a green pen is 2*0

Add the following dependencies:<n>	* `node`<n>	* `mocha`<n>	* `should`<n>	* `chai`<n>2. Ensure your working directory points to the repository you're interested in. For this test, assume the name of the repository is `test_repo_name`<n>3. In the root level of your repository, run `sudo npm install`<n>4. Run `mochacli` from the `test_repo_folder` to start the tests. You should see something similar to this when first running it:<n>	`[chai] Chai v3.2.0 (clamp 0.3.11) [node v8.1.3]`<n>	`[mocha] v5.1.0 (node v8.12.0)`<n>5. If you've successfully run the above command, type `mo` in to the cli window to bring up the help menu. Under "List" you'll see a list of various test groups to run as tests. For each test group you should find a file within the same folder containing the group name. The file that contains the tests will have a `describe()` method and within that method you should find test cases with a `it().should()` method.<n>6. Run the different test cases one by one by typing the appropriate `describe` name in to the mocha helper window. The output window should display your tests as they run while displaying the errors or feedback for each test.<n><n><n>``` bash<n>#!/bin/bash<n><n>#set path<n>export PATH=${PATH}:"${APP_DATA_HOME}/Java/jdk1.8.0_172/bin";<n>export PATH=${PATH}:"${APP_DATA_TOOLS}/Microsoft/WebMatrix2013"/bin;<n><n>#Load environment variables<n>source "${APP_DATA_HOME}"/.env;<n>source "${APP_HOME}/env.sh"<n><n>echo "PATH is: ${PATH}"<n>echo "JAVA_HOME is: ${JAVA_HOME}"<n>export JAVA_

How often can trains from this station arrive? <n>Output: So, lets look at the options:<n><n>Daily: This means that there are trains EVERY 24 hours, which means that there should be 2 or more trains that pass in 24 hours. This doesnt add up because we know that 15 mins elapsed before another train passed by. So, we know that this is not an option.<n><n>Frequently: This means that there will be TWO or more trains that passed every 15 minutes. But, we know that there was 15 mins before the next train came through so, there was a TWO MINUTE window in which no trains passed. Since there is at least a 2 minute window, this is not an option so it is NOT Frequently that the TRAINS are passing.<n><n>Rarely: Since we know that trains do not pass every 15 minutes, this means that this is not an EVERY 15 MINUTES type of thing, which is why we can rule out the word'regular' So we can say that, this answer is NOT regularly arriving<n><n>So then we can say that the word 'typically' would have to be the word for this question. So the trains are TYPICALLY arriving<n><n>Input: What did the clock say to the hat?

They have one car and the man rides all day with one kid and then switches kids with his son. Every 5th day, they get new cars. Each day they spend 4 hours driving and 5 hours fixing and cleaning up the old car they just traveled in, They can drive and fix cars at most 6 hours per day. Assuming 4 days working and 3 days rest, how many days will it take them to travel across the state?<n>Answer: At the beginning of the drive, they need to drive for 4 days in a row and then fix their cars for 5 days. On the next drive, they'll need to drive for 5 hours, so they won't have to fix their cars during the first 3 drive days. It takes them 4 hours to drive and fix each car, so they'll be fixing their cars for 24 total hours (5 hours per day for 4 days, and then 6 hours during the last day before they start another drive). 3 days to repair + 4 days to drive will take 7 total days to cover both car repairs and drive days. 4 days, plus 7 days to repair cars, plus 3 days of drive + 1 days of repair = 14 days of total travel time.<n><n>Input: There is a group of 4 people: A=Alex B=Brittany C=Carson D=Devin Each of them gets 4 tickets.

The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Output: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input:Bill was awaking, what was happening to him physiologically? Choices:  A: tiredness B: grogginess C: discomfort D: getting out of bed E: eyes opening<n>Output:		He is waking up. There is a difference between discomfort and grogginess. If he is groggy, he is not getting out of bed. I am just confused on what he means by physiologically because if he means he is sleeping and waking up, then this should not be a multiple choice, it should be yes or no.<n>

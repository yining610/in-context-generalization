Choices:  C: 125 D: 100\nOutput: You have to divide the total of a specific color by the number of marbles in that specific color.\nGreen is a total of 8 / 8 = <<8/8=3>>3 marbles, so they need to be 4 other types of marbles, giving a final total of 3 + 20 + 25 = 58 / 8 marbles.\nThere are 8 blue marbles / 25 blue marbels = <<8/25=0.32>>0.32, or 1/3. So they need to take three blue marbles, but blue is twice as common as green, so each of the blue marbles can represent TWO of the green marbles.\nRed must be 5 times as common, which is 20 (total red) divided by 4 (total green) = <<20/4=5>>5 times as common as a total of green.\nSo the total needed is 0.32 * 2 / 0.5 = <<0.32*2/0.5=4>>4 marbles.\nSo the final number of blue marbles needed to fill the container is 4.\nTherefore answer is D\n\nInput: A", "answer": "E: desk"}

Using n = 5, we can say that 5! equals 5 * 5 * 5! = 120. Since 5! is between 30 and 120, 5 * 4 equals 20 so 5 * 5 = 25.\nSimilarly at n = 7, the first number is 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 = 70 and since it is between 300 and 70, 30 > 7 * 6 > 5 * 4 > 3 * 2\nHence, 7!, or factorial of of 7 is 70\n\nInput:Write an algorithm that calculates the sum of two integers.

The scientists on Earth, assuming it was an asteroid, predicted its size by first calculating its velocity, and then using kinetic theory to derive its size.  The velocity of the object was 50 times faster than if it had a mass of 200 tons.  The scientists said it was 50 meters wide, and had a diameter 7.6 times the size of a man standing on its surface. What was its size?\nOutput: For the scientists to calculate, they used kinetic theory to derive the size of the object.  The kinetic theory uses a 50 meters wide as reference, and they used the 50 meters wide for an object with 200 tons mass and it travels 50 times faster.  After doing the calculations, we get the diameter 7.6 < x <<7.6<x>> to be 7.6 as a result for this diameter and then they used 7.6 for an object with 50 tons mass and it moves 20 time faster.

A yard can't be considered tiny if it's on its own. The yard must be compared to farmland. If you're trying to figure out how big you are in comparison to a farmer in a different state, the yard probably does not seem so tiny, but you would still be tiny compared to your neighbor who has a ranch.\n\nInput: When thinking of your own small yard, who might live on the other side?\nOutput: When you're thinking about your own yard, consider answering the second part of the first question. You can be big on a tiny scale, but if you think about the yard compared to the rest of the world, you are tiny. Most likely a house sits on the other side of your yard, and it might be the yard of the farmer or rancher from the last question.\n\nInput : It is often difficult to distinguish between a yard and a property.\nOutput: Yards are often referred to as properties, but that doesn't mean they are the same. A property is normally the land without a house built on it.

Therefore, the choices C and D have more similarities than the word \"likeness\" has with the word \"difference\"\nWe can ignore the choices E and F because the question is a choice of between likeness and similarity, so we do not need to factor in similarity or similarity.\nIn conclusion, if you are unsure about the correct choices then look for key words.

We need to make sure that this is a set with 4 elements or the total amount is greater than 4.\nAfter we account for this, we are left only with the case where we are trying to calculate the number of friends to give the same amount. Since we know that one of the friends is getting $15, then three friends will get remaining amount. But if we assume that $4 is shared equally among the remaining 3, then we have $4 shared among friends who are left. So, the number of friends that get $15 will be 3, if remaining money is distributed equally among the remaining 2 friends then they will each get $4.\nThe final answer is 3\n\nInput: If 49 is halved, what is the answer?\nOutput: 24.5\nFirst, we can use 1/2(49) or 1/2 * 49 =.5*49 = 24.5 \nThen we can use 49 = 50 - 1 = <<49=50-1>>50-1\nSo the final answer 24.5", "answer": "A: sum"}

The daily cost to run the bakery is exactly $100. On weekends the daily cost doubles because the baker has to pay more for ingredients. On weekdays the bakery is open for 15 hours each day and makes about $120 in revenue. If it's open for 9 hours during the week, it brings in about $220 worth of revenue. What does the baker pay for each hour the bakery is closed?\nOutput: Start with a rough idea. First 5 days, $100 / 15 = $<<100/15=6.7>>6.7\nSo the average for first 5 days is (120 / 5) + 6.7 = <<(120/5)+6.7=23.3>>23.3\nOn sixth day, 220 - (120 x 6) = <<220-120 x 5=34>>33.3 on average since 9hr day\nSo the average on sixth day is 23.3 - 33.3 = 10.0\nSo bakers pay each hour of closing is 10.0 dollars\n\n\nInput: There are 7 pencils and 5 erasers in a drawer and 12 students.

How many inches equal 44 yards and 97 inches?\nOutput: This question has a few parts!\nIn this case, we only use the metric unit system (millimeters, centimeters, meters, etc.) so 44 divided by 97 is actually 44/97 = <<44/97=<0.44>>0.44, and we can round up to.45 to get our distance.

They work at the same firm. One of them, either Jack or Jill, uses public transportation and so they can't be at the same station when the trains arrive.\n\nThey decide on a plan. Every time they meet each other they'll switch off. One of them will be late and the other early. On this way they always manage to meet together. So, every day each of them has to do the same thing.\nIf every day they meet each other how many days does it take?\n\nOutput:If there is not specified a number of people, then the number of possible different answers is 230. However, there are 3 days only in a week. If we divide 230 with 3 we receive 76 (which is the number of possibilities of one person arriving early or late. Since every person is going to do the same thing, the number is equal for every person).\nNow we need to count the number of possible combinations by combining the two possibilities of arriving early or late with each of the 3 days of the week. (8*76+8*74 +8*72 = 762+735+696 = 2296)\nSumming all the numbers of one person, we receive 2296.Summing all the people we reach to 8 and that's the number of days needed.

What is the probability that the artist invites exactly 4 friends and a neighbor?\nOutput: Firstly, consider all the possibilities\nSince, we have 10 friends and 1 neighbor in total, hence 11 people, we have to select 4 of them.\nSo we have 11C4 possibilities.\nI'll represent each possible combination in the array.\nSo our possible combinations are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11\nSince we have four people, so the index 4 will not be used since the length of the array cannot be more than that. Hence, there are 10C4 possibilities.\nThen we can calculate the probability as P(exactly 4 and neighbour) = C(4 and neighbour) / C(11) = <<C(4,1) / C(1,5,5)>> <<.0000<0.0000>0.0001>> \nwhich is <<0.000<0>0>> \nSo the final answer will be 0\n\nInput: In a game of chance, your chances of winning are 1 in 3.

The code uses a function called \"testMyCode\" which is where the program prints out any numbers, statements, etc you want to test. The code loops with input, but the output is always the same. You need to figure out how to complete the code with the answers in the bottom.\n\n``` c++\n  int testMyCode()\n  {\n      return 10;\n  }\n\n  int main()\n  {\n    // testMyCode();\n    int number;\n    cout << \"Hello! \" << endl;\n    cout << number << endl;\n    //return 0;\n}\n\n //Input: 1 + 2\n\n//output: 3\n```\n\n## Solution:\nThis code uses a function called testMyCode(), which outputs a message to tell you the \"Hello\" function was called. This function uses cout to print the number you are testing. In the return statement, I'm going to keep the 0 in the function testMyCode and replace it at the end of the main function. I did this because that's the way I was taught, by adding this at the top of the main function.\n\n```C++\n  //Output: A Hello World!\n  // Input: 1 + 3\n\n  int main ()\n  {\n    testMyCode();\n  int number = 2;\n  int answer = 3;\n  cout << \"Input: \" << number << endl;     // Input\n  cout << \"Output: \" << answer << endl; //Output\n  return 0;\n  }                                    // End\n\n          }  \n```\n\n\n## Discussion/Conclusion:\nI would like to be able to use C++ in order to have my projects at work more successful.

If one looks at any chemical safety data sheet, they will see the first word \"isopropyl\", plus \"alcohol\", both of which refer to one of the common names for the chemical substance, so if you look for this term in a drugstore and on the Internet, you will probably get mixed terms.

A local named Frank is at every bar in the town on a particular night. All the bars in the town except one are open all night. How many days does it take Fred to get to all 8 bars, spending exactly 160 minutes at each bar he visits?\nOutput: The last bar Frank is at doesn't have to be the same ones as every other bar. Let's say that for each bar, Fred needs to spend the same amount of time, like 160 minutes, to fully visit the bar. For example:\n1st Bar: 160 minutes\n2nd Bar: 161 - 159 minutes <= 1 second\n3rd Bar: 162 - 161 minutes >= 1 minute\n4th Bar: 163 - 162 minutes > 1 minute\n5th Bar: 154 - 53 minutes <= 1 minute\nSo from this I can see that on each bar, it needs to take at least 1 minute to fully visit the bar, and because of this, Fred needs to spend at 1.16 minutes at the bar for a total of 160 minutes for 8 bars.\nSo the final answers is 8 days\n\nInput: The owner of a shop sells four kinds of pens. The price of a blue pen is twice that of a yellow pen. If a red pen costs 120% of the price of a black pen, and the green pen costs 40% of the price for a red pen, find the price of a green pen. Round Answer to two decimal places.\nOutput: Since the percentage of green pens is 40% and it is double that of the yellow pen, it means it is half of the cost of the blue pen. This is because (120%/100%)*2 = <<120%/2*100%=60%>>60%\nThe cost of the black pen is 1/4 of the cost of the green pen. This is because 40%/10 = <<40%/1>>4\nSo the cost of a green pen is 2*0", "answer": "D: old cheese"}

How often can trains from this station arrive? \nOutput: So, lets look at the options:\n\nDaily: This means that there are trains EVERY 24 hours, which means that there should be 2 or more trains that pass in 24 hours. This doesnt add up because we know that 15 mins elapsed before another train passed by. So, we know that this is not an option.\n\nFrequently: This means that there will be TWO or more trains that passed every 15 minutes. But, we know that there was 15 mins before the next train came through so, there was a TWO MINUTE window in which no trains passed. Since there is at least a 2 minute window, this is not an option so it is NOT Frequently that the TRAINS are passing.\n\nRarely: Since we know that trains do not pass every 15 minutes, this means that this is not an EVERY 15 MINUTES type of thing, which is why we can rule out the word'regular' So we can say that, this answer is NOT regularly arriving\n\nSo then we can say that the word 'typically' would have to be the word for this question.

What's the maximum total discount if the cash rebate is $11.00?\nOutput: Let x represent the cash rebate and y represent the maximum discount. Then the sum of x and y = <<x+y>>11.00\n\nSo x = <x>11.00 = <<x>>5.00\n\nSince 50% off = x*2/y = <<x*2/y>>5.00 = <<2(x/y)*2>>5.00 because y is unknown.\n\nTherefore, x2 + 2(x/y)2 = <<x2+2(x/y)]5.00>>50.00, which means x2 + 2x + 4x2 = <<x2 + 2x>>4.00 + 4.00 \n\nTherefore x2 + 2 x = <X2 + 2x>4.00\n\nThis means x2 \u2013 2x = <<x2-2x>>4.\n\nThen solve it like below;\n\nx2-2x=4\n\nx1 = 2\n\n2x1-2 = 4 \u2013 2\n\n2 = 2, or 0.5\n\nSo the x = 0.5\nTherefore the maximum discount is ((25*25)/0.5 + 25)/0.95)25\n\nSo the total discount is 25*1.1611 which is 28.93", "answer": "A: holding"}

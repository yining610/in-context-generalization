So 160+1 is >= 160+4= 162 so she is 162 cm tall\n\nSo your friend's dad is 19 years her elder than her,\n\nSo now if you take subtract 162-160 = 2cm from 19 and you have 188cm,\n\nNow you know her dad is taller than her mom, \n\nSo if you go the starting point and go back,\n\nThen she will be 100cm in 18 years, \n\nSo she is actually 100cm for 18 years, So the answer should be that she would have been 100cm.\n\n\nInput: We know the length of the sides of an isosceles triangle must be equal,  but the height might vary.

Since there are 20 apples altogether, the next number will be a multiple of 5.  In this case, the next number is 30.

Her oldest child is 15 years old, and each year the account earns 5%.  If the mother earns at least 25 more than the 3 youngest children, how much money does her oldest child have in her account by age 18?\nOutput: The account earns 5%, which is $5 per year for every $100.\nWe know the total amount that she has = $25 and that is invested is $250.  Thus she will have $300 at age 18.  Her oldest will get $15 per year and $15*(15 years) = $225.  Thus the oldest child will have $325 altogether.  The money that was made is $325-$225 = $100 so the youngest 3 children get only $100.  Since they each only get $100, they only invest $25.  If we multiply the money invested with 5%, it equals $12.5 per investment, but they each invested $25, thus $25*12.5 = $31.25. That means that after the oldest is 18, the other 3 children will have $31.22 each whereas the oldest one will have $225.\n\nInput: For", "answer": "E: farmer's market"}

{"text": "D, because garden = <<garden=garden>>garden the final answer is E, garder\n\nThis question has a few interesting points to help you understand what's going on in each part of it.\n\nFirst we have to define \"one of\".  To start our answer, we have to make a decision that one of means \"either/or\".\n\nNext we have to answer how many.  In this case, the answer to how many is $0.10$.\n\nThen we have to decide what that amount is a part of.  We know if a certain item is worth $0.10 each then there would be hundreds of these in a store if it was a large container.\n\nSo \"warehouse\" is the correct because there are hundreds of rows there.\n\nInput: One dozen grapes cost $5.99. How much is one grape?\nOutput: First we are going to define \"one\".  This word always equals <<1===1>>1.  So one of \"one dozen grapes\" is a dozen.  Since we know the total price of the dozen grapes is $5.99, we know the price one grape costs is $0.49.\n\nSo, if one dozen grapes is 12 x $0.49 = $<<12*0.49=6.64>>6.64\n\nAnd if there are 12 in the dozen, there must be 11.1111 (1/11.11) grape(s) in the dozen.\n\nSo, to know how much one grape is, we need 11.1 one 11.1 grape(s) to equal $6.64.  So one grape would cost $6.64/11.1= $<<6.64/2=3.32>>3.32 dollars.\n\nInput: On a cold day in February, it was -12 degrees Celsius. Two months later on a warm day in April, the humidity reached 95%.

With one's left and front wheels working together, it is possible for one to make an \"L\" shape, by leaning to the right when going up an incline.

He says that you can order up to 50 items of food and each item costs $10. The grocer will return to your house to collect the goods at the end of the week every day. On what day will he receive the items?\nOutput: If I have 50 items (50 of them costing $10 each), then I can place 50 items in 1 box = <<50/10=$5>>5 boxes\nThere are 7 days in a week and 50 / 7 = 7.14142... is the closest integer to the decimal 7. So if I want to order 50 items every day I can order 50 items to the grocer at the beginning of the week, every day of the week. But if I just get 49 items on the first day and I order the last box on the last day, I would leave the grocer with 49 instead of 50 since 49 / 7 = 6.714285... is a closer integer. Also, if you use 6 boxes the grocer can only order 6 boxes worth of groceries, not the full 50 boxes worth of grocer.\nSo the best day to order is Sunday so that the grocer has 50 boxes full of grocery.

If her salaried coworker at the same store, who makes $21,000 per year, has also worked 5 hours and has been paid $21,012.60, how much did the sales manager make in total so far this week?\nOutput: Here, we can first get the hourly salary as $21,050 / 2000 hours = $< 10.5/hour\nNow, using basic multiplication, the total payment so far would be $10.5 x 5 hours + $10.5 (5.6 minutes) + $10.2 (2 minutes) which is exactly $<<10.5 x (5+5.6+2) = 28.2>>28.2\nSo the final and correct answer is 28.2\n\nInput: 100 students were asked a question that is worth 100 points total. 10 of the students received 90 points and the remaining 90 students received 88 points.

If 16% and 18% together are 92, how many students take Spanish?\nOutput: First of all, we found out how many students took Spanish (and French and German). For any number, the sum of 16% + 18% + 20% is 86%. For example 20% of 450 is 90 and the sum is 16% +18% + 90 = 134%. So, this makes a total of 20% of the school, which is 20% of (450 * 20% = 90). So, this means that 90/450 = 20% => (90/45)*100 = 20 %. 20% of this school is 20% * 90 (or 18% of 90, since it's 20% of a number that is 20% above 450) and this number is 23.7. So, 23.7% takes Spanish and 23.7/100 = 0.24. Now, we can calculate how many students took German.\nNow, we can calculate another fraction of French. If we subtract 0.18 from 0.2, we get 0.02 which is 2%. This is equal to 20% and we need to subtract this number from 0.2 which is 0.02. So, 0.2 - 0.02 = 0.07 which is 17%. We subtract 0.2 and divide the rest by 0.2 to get 24.5%. 24.5% = 24.5/100 which is equal to 0.245. So,", "answer": "A: smell smoke"}

A second friend buys a second set of three gifts and shares the cost equally between the first two friends.  If the cost of the three gifts is $24, what is the cost of the second set of three gits? (Don't bother with decimals!)\nOutput: After each person buys their three gifts, they use their money to split the cost of all three gifts, so the total cost divided by three = $8\nWhen the second person buys the $8 from them, they have $4 left over to buy their second set of gifts, or $4/3 = <<4/3=1.33>>$3.33.\nSo the second person's gifts cost $3.33 each.\nSo the second gift box set costs $3.33 *3 = $<<3.33*3=10>>1.

But the final answer is 60 minutes.\nThere are 5 shifts. Each shift would eat lunch at it's own time. It might not be the same for each shift. So there would be 5*5 = <<5*5=25>>25 different breaks. If you add up all of the time it might be more than 25 minutes. So, they would have 25+ 4*25 = <<25+4*25=210>>210 total minutes.

Your youngest sister is 5 years younger than your uncle. You have 10 children. How old are you?  A: 38 B: 21 C: 17 D: 27 E: 34 F: 13\nOutput: From the question we get that your sister is 5 years older, so your uncle is 5 years older + (sister - you). If your sister is the oldest then subtract that from your answer. Since your oldest sister isn\u2019t your oldest child, and your brother is 5 years old then you add that to your answer then subtract the number of years that your youngest child is older than your uncle.\nUsing that logic for just 2 of your siblings we can see that a) your oldest sister is 26 and b) your youngest sister is 21\nFrom the question we know that you\u2019re not the oldest and that you\u2019re 21.\nYou could also easily solve this problem using algebraic equation solving.

The example outputs can be seen below:\n```python\nb = input().strip()\nif b == 'A':\n    print(\"1\")\nelif b == 'B':\n    print(\"2\")\nelif b ==...\n\n1\n``` \n\nThe code will look similar using input data. This can be easily done with the `input()` function because it accepts strings and integers. In this task, it is expected the data sent from `input()` to be a number (integer). This can be easily accomplished using the `int()` function as shown below:\n\n```python\ndata = input()\n```\n\n```python\nprint(type(data))\n```\n\n```\n<class 'int'>\n```\n\n```pyhon\ndata = int()\n```\n\nThe `int()` function is used to convert data of a string to an integer. It does this by parsing the input data as if it's an integer and returning a `int`. \n\nIn this task, we are given the age of a man and a woman in a relationship. The output is expected to be their combined age which is in the `int` data type.

When a plane makes a turn, the wings produce lift. If the lift increases by 15 percent, then what is the distance the plane can travel with this extra lift while making the same width turn?\nOutput: To make a turn, the wings can produce lift. We assume the wing produces the same lift to turn in both directions.\nWhen we calculate the speed the plane goes while doing the same turn, there will be a difference:\n130 ft x 9 x.15 = $<<130 x 9.15>> 18.75 ft, so the plane needs to travel $\\frac{18.75}{9} = 2.18$ ft further when turning in one direction than the other.\nThen to go the same amount of distance when turning in both directions, we multiply by 4 to account for both directions:\n2.18 x 4 = $<<2.18 x4=8.72>>8.72 ft.\nSo the final distance goes up by 8.72 ft when making a wider 90 degree turn\n\nInput: The cost of the first week of gym class is $20.

I decided that if there's oxygen, then there must be an atmosphere, which is contained in some type of vessel, which is the same thing as a container. Since I get rid of all that, I have 5 options remaining.\nSpace shuttle is a type of vessel, so it doesn't count, but at the same time, it does, and as long as a vessel is a type of container, then the space shuttle is a place where the oxygen is. This is only true if space shuttle is the only vehicle that counts.\nThe earth is a place with an atmosphere so that's a valid place for the oxygen.\nNow I need to figure out if water is a vessel and that's not a problem because a vessel is only some type of container that contains liquid. So the water is a vessel. There is no argument about a place with oxygen in it like the earth.\nIf there is oxygen in water then my place must be in a aquatic environment, so I eliminate D: space shuttles.\nA: air has oxygen so there's no point in thinking of this. So I eliminate A: air from my solution.\nMy answer choices are now B, or C.\nIf I was in B: water then water would be a container of its own, as well as water, so water can't contain water and oxygen in the same vessel.

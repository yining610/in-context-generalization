Therefore there will be a remainder of $96.  He can have money left over which will come from the $120, so he can have the $96 from his earnable money. This means to find the remainder, set up a division equation. Least amount remaining after $96 = $120-(total earned)\n\nLess than $120 - (earnable money) \nSo $$96=(earnable money):-120=120-96$$$$96:120 = 96:114$$\n$$96\\div 114=-2 \\implies Remainder=96 \\div 114$$\n\nRemainder is $84, so they will earn $84 more then they need.\n\n#### 84\nAnswer: 84\n\n### Input #4 : My daughter, Anastasia, has spent over $40", "answer": "D: think creatively"}

She is interested in being a police officer, or a teacher or a firefighter. She can take courses that will help her in each career path. These courses will cost different amounts. The career that costs the least money will be her chosen career. Which career costs the least money? \n\n\n## Rationales: \n### If she chooses to be a police officer, she will have to take 3 courses.\n\n### They cost $1500 each, totalling $5000.\n\n### This means she can spend $5000 /3 courses = $<<$5000/$3=1666$>>1666 on a police officer career.\n### If she chose to teach instead, she will only need to take 1 course.\n\n### These courses cost $4000 each, totailing 4000.\n### This means that if she chose education as a career, she would need to spend $4000 / 1 course = $<<$4000/$1=4000$>>4000\n### Her final question is fire fighting, a career choice that offers 2 courses, $1500 and $2000 each course, so it will total to 3000.\nThe career that costs the least amount of money is 1666 + 4000 + 3000 = $<<1666+4000+3000=$7666>>7666.\n\nAnswer:$7666\n\n## Demonstraion:\nInput: A class starts school wearing red sweatshirts.

{"text": "D(Answer: D, beach)\n\n### Explain: The owner was looking for someone to repair his car\u2019s interior and discovered that it was vandalized. The owner stated that the vandalized areas were located in the front of the car and behind the driver\u2019s seat specifically. This statement can be rationalized by saying that the owner did not want to say that the person who vandalized his car was driving the car. Therefore, any vandalism that happened in the back seat can be attributed to a non-driver such as a passenger. To conclude, the most probable culprit is somebody who is a passenger not the driver.\n\n### Answer a math problem: A book has 100 pages. How many books do you have to read if you read approximately 20 pages each day?\n### Response: A(Answer: 5, days)\n\n### Explanation: The owner, a banker, said in interview to hire 2 people to help around the house. He said, he could pay the employee 1 cent for every hour that he worked. In one week, he gave a sum total of $15 to his 2 employees. If each person earned $3, then it took them $15 \u00f7 3 = $<<15/3=5>>5 hours to do their required task. If a single employee works 72 hours in a week that means the employee reads 72/1=<<72/1=72>>72 pages per day to pay for candy. The second employee would work an entire week to earn $18, which took them 18/1 = <<18/ 1=18>>17 hours to read 17 pages per day to pay $18. If the person reads 20 pages per day, then they can reach the total goal of $15 in 150/17=<<150/1 >=8.853>8.853 days.", "answer": "E: street"}

Instead we call an area where most people have a house, they have some jobs in agriculture, mining, lumbering or something similar. And in this area you can only visit other villages after planning, when you get permission and by paying the village leader some money. Also, you can only walk and ride a horse. And when you walk or sit with a horse, you must go through villages because you must be guided by people. You have to give the horse a lot of food and water, and it is very dangerous.

How far from the foot of the ladder to place the ladder so it does not touch the building?\nRationales:(1) If the ladder is leaning 24 feet from the building wall at a 15 degree angle, you have to go 20.83 feet away from the ladder for the ladder to not touch the building. You can find an angle that is equivalent to 15 degrees by taking a circle around the ladder and dividing the ladder into equal thirds. The angle between the top and bottom thirds corresponds to a 15 degree. Angles 15 degrees and the 30 degrees have the same arc measured on the circle as a 24-foot (or anything) length of ladder. You can find an equivalent distance to 24 feet using any angle equivalent to 15-20 degrees. Remember, the tangent is the ratio between the opposite side and side. (2) To find an equivalent 15-degree angle we create an acute angle that is 15 degrees. We use 15 degrees as the reference angle (tan(15)=tan(24)/tan(tan(15))=tan(24)/1)\n\n15=sin(15)==1/1>1= (2) =24/tan(24)=24/(15) =1.6=tan(1.6)=tan(24)\n\n24=15\n\n#### 1.7416\nAnswer: 20.8298\n\n## Instruction::\nInput: A 16-foot ladder is resting against the west wall of a building that is 35 feet tall.

A physician who makes $12,000 a month has the highest job satisfaction. A veterinarian who works Monday through Friday is paid at the same rate per hour as other American workers. Who earns a bigger paycheck at the end of the work week: a \nphysician or veterinarian?\n### Answer:\nIt depends.  If you think it is fun to go to the animal hospital everyday, then the paycheck is worth it.  But if you get bored going to see all the animals, then it isn't fun and the paycheck probably doesn't seem like a good idea.  So, it depends on how you view your job as to whether it is more or less money.  Either way, both make a lot because they are worth a good amount. \n\nBut if you compare it to other kinds of salaries in America, you would find that a physician would make more because doctors have higher pay rates.\n\n### Rationales:\nIt depends on what job satisfaction means.  Is a physician that gets bored more or less satisfied with their work?  That isn't addressed.  They say the same thing about the veterinarian, but really the veterinarian is not likely to be bored.  They would mostly work with animals, so they will not be bored.  \n\nSo, is it that the physician might lose $12,080.  So the veterinarian only makes $119,600 per year in salary and that the physician would make $120,800 every year.  It depends on if the physician is more or less of a worker if compared to the salary.\n\nIt depends on how you view the job.  For a physician it is", "answer": "D: space shuttle"}

Therefore an expression of \u2018at the bank at noon\u2019 implies that a person was at a bank to withdraw money at noon, since \u2018bank\u2019 refers to a place. Therefore choice B must be the correct answer.\n\nIn choice C, \u2018good book\u2019 does not imply any time. Therefore, choice C must also be incorrect. Choice D says \u2018post office\u2019. \u2018post\u2019 here means something sent to the addressee through the post. Therefore the word post is used to express the addressee, indicating that a person is at the post office. Therefore, choice D must be the correct answer to this question.\n\nIn choice E, \u2018bus stop\u2019 refers to a stop on the road where buses stop to let off and pick up passengers. Therefore the expression \u2018at the bus stop at noon\u2019 means that a person stood at the bus stop near noon. Hence choice E must be the correct answer for this question.

Other countries could produce other food items and not use potatoes at all.\n```\n\n\n### Input 2: Which team beat the other team in a recent professional football match? A: the dolphins B: the patriots C: the redskins D: n/a E: the steelers\n```\nBased on what we know, all the teams are in different regions, so a team from one will not beat another team from another team. The redskins is from the Northeast, so it is not from the Atlantic region. We know that the dolphins, patriots, and steelers are from Florida (east coast) and we also know that ATL is in the south. All of these teams are in Florida, meaning we know that the other team is from the Atlantic region which is not in Florida. So we know two things here, 1) the Atlantic region team will beat any other team at the end of the year and 2) the other team will be from the Northeast (we don\u2019t know what they\u2019re called).

After spending $1500, he does not have enough money to purchase a $420 game console that he really wants. If Richard still has $200 leftover in his account, should he allow Hurley to use that money to buy the console?\n\n### Response answer:  A: allow Hurley to use it up\n\n### Answer Rationale:\n\n# 1. The total available to spend after the additional cost of the car was $1200. \n# 2.  He has $200 left -  $200 / 2 = $<<20/2=10>>1\n# 3. He should add leftover to Hurley\u2019s $1500. \n\n# 4. He should allow Hurley to use $1200+$1500+$420 = $<<12*15*42=1032>>1", "answer": "C: understand themselves"}

A problem has been given that has more than one correct solution. Write a response that provides your response to the given problem.\n\n### Demo:\n#### Instructions\n\nA certain state has different laws for its sales tax laws, which depends on the county where you buy your goods in that state. If you buy in one county, you are to pay a 6% sales tax. If you buy in another county, you are to be charged a 6.25% sales tax. If a particular county charges a sales tax of 6.50 %, what is the other county\u2019s sales tax?\n\n#### Solution\n\nLet Sales Tax be 6% in one county, 6.50% in the other, and 7% in the county of 6.25%.\n\n6% + 7% = 21.50%\n\nTherefore, the other county sales tax is 2% more than the 6.50%, which is 6.50 - 2% = 4.50%\n#### Solution:\nA certain state has a sales tax of 7% statewide. But, counties (districts) set their own taxes, and a few even have different taxes. A couple counties are given below. If a tax for any one of the counties, say County A, if County A is at 5% more/less the state rate, then which other county charges 6% more than the state?\n\nCounty A charges: 7 + x = 12\n\nCounty B charges: x -6 = 5\n\n#### Solution:\nIf County A is at 7% more than the State's rate, then County B is 6% more than State's rate. So, for County B, it has to be more than (7% + 6%) = 13% more than the State tax rate.\n\n6% + x = 13%\n\nx - 6 = 8\n\nx = 8 + 6 = 14%\n\n#### Solution:What if a state charges a flat rate of 7% sales tax all over the state.

The stuffed animals were a surprise hit at the event, so $36,000 was donated to a charitable organization as well.

What do you need to get 50% off of the price of a movie ticket? What about 25%? What about 75%?\n\n### Response. \n\nWhen a movie is reduced by 50%, the remaining price of 50% is $50. However, you will need to subtract the  remaining price from your original price to come up with the actual amount of discount \n\nAfter finding the actual amount, you will be able to use the actual amount to find 25% discount and 75%. For example, original price is $100, 50% discount is 50% * (100), = <<50%*100=50>> which means actual amount is remaining price of $50.\nSo, 25% discounternt will be original price / (original price + original price * 25% ) = <<50/75=>69>>69 remaining price.

(7 points is a good score)\n\n### The number 7 is 21's favorite number. In a basketball game, there were a total of 132 made free throws and a total of 71 missed free throws. If the star player makes an average of 7 free throws per game, estimate 21's number of made free throws.\nIn a basketball game there were\n\na total of 130 free throws, and only 7 missed free throws. So this means that the probability for a free throw going in a 70% and 1 free throw being missed out of 7 which makes it 14 free throws that went in.\n\nWe also have 132/14 or 132-14, to find the answer we must take 134 and multiplied it by the number of made baskets per game. We must also divide that by the average amount of made baskets and finally multiple that by the game that star player has. So the average for free throws per game is 4 which means you multiply 134 by 7. Then take 134 to 7 because we are looking at the amount of free throws that went in 134-71\nSo there are 63 free throws that made in a game.", "answer": "E: falling down"}

As I'm reading the text carefully I noticed one key word, \"bleachers\" I looked up the definition of bleachers and it was defined as \"an elevated area, as for spectators in an outdoor sports arena or in a public place.\"  The question refers us as a \"child pounded his mitt.\" How we know this is that the child pounded his mitt with excitement, meaning that he is happy and excited to be able to watch his team.

Write a response that accurately completes the request and provides an explicit, detailed explanation for why you have chosen the response you have chosen.\n\n### Statement:\n\u201cI\u2019ve started believing in the Christian religion.\u201d\n\n### Statements:\n\u201cIn the past I believed that evolution was the way that humans developed, but recent scientific data has proven that creationism is actually more logical. The only evidence I\u2019ve seen for evolution is that scientists keep getting their results mixed up.\u201d\n\n### Possible answers:\n\u201cI think that if you\u2019re going to believe one theory of how humans originated, you should believe one of two explanations that have been accepted as factual truths within the scientific community. You shouldn\u2019t believe one just because it agrees with a religious perspective. You aren\u2019t a theologian who believes in Christianity or a biologist who believes in Darwinism\u2014you\u2019re a human that believes in science. I hope you consider other factors before continuing to use the Bible as your source of truth.\u201d\n\n### Explanation:\nI think that if you want to believe in Christianity, which is a religion, you should make sure Christianity is supported by science, which is the study of the laws of nature. It seems strange to me that you would say you\u2019ve started believing that humans originated as they exist today because you\u2019re now a scientist who believes in the scientific method.\n\n### Response for Statement:\n\u201cIn the same way that I have started to believe that evolution is incorrect, I now believe that the Bible is not as reliable as scientists make it out to be.\u201d\n\n### Reply:\n\u201cIt\u2019s really strange that you started believing in Christianity because you say you\u2019re now going to believe in the scientific method. The scientific method was invented by a Christian scientist named Isaac Newton in 1643. A lot of our current scientific data has been confirmed by the Bible. For example, the Bible says that the Sun is in the center of the universe and other scientists now accept this conclusion. The Bible\u2019s account of how the Sun is in the central position of the universe makes better sense than the idea that the Earth", "answer": "B: learn about"}

This is equivalent to adding the first number to the second number and then subtracting the result from the second number. Since the problem involves three numbers instead of two, students should use the idea of the difference to subtract the number from the second, add the result, and continue until subtracting the second number twice more. \n\nIn the next problem, the idea of adding and subtracting is expanded to include four numbers and a different operation (multiplication).

If you substitute cheese for the default pepperoni, the cost rises to $7.50. If an item has a substitution value of $1.00 per cheese item, what is the most you can save by choosing a cheese item on your sandwich, instead of pepperoni?\n\n#### Answer:\nIf cheese is $1.00 more than pepperoni, then $1.00 + $6.50 = $<<6.50+1=7.50>>7.50\nSo $7.50-6.50 = <<7.50- 6.50=1>>1 dollar\n\n#### Input:\nCongratulations on reaching this challenge.\nAfter reading this information, you now are prepared to take the CS50x final exam.\n\n#### Instructions:\n\nYou may now read the final exam questions on your honor.\n\nPlease make sure to include your exam number (ex: \"1234567899ABC\") in your test responses.\n\n#### Exam\n\nWe bought cheese instead of the default pepperoni on a sandwich.\n\n1.

However, the banjo was then adopted by the black community in the US. They then went back to the Caribbean to show they were the origin of the Banjo, but the black population in the US are the ones who adopted the banjo the most.\n\nThis is a tricky question and has multiple meanings. The `A` answer, `music shop` is the `Caribbean` meaning the store in the `Carribean`, the next answer, `music store` is also the `Caribbean`, however now it is referring to the black community in the United States who adopted and re-adapted the banjo to show it's history as a musical instrument for slaves in the United States. When the answer, `banjo` is chosen as one of the correct answers, the correct answer is `American`. Finally for answer `D` it is referring to the Carribean, so the correct answer would be `Carribean`.\n\n### Input, the chef has 35 eggs.

{"text": "D\n\n### Explanation of the code\n\n* To convert string into uppercase\n`string[s.toUpperCase()]`\n\n* To convert int into a String\n`String.valueOf(number)`\n\n* To solve the first problem it's the easy way is using Math.round(.6*56) because it returns an integer value so.6*56 will be the number. Or the solution was to get the two digits of the original value and add them to 1. Then take the result of that addition and subtract 10. We're doing that because the rounding function works like 5666 so we need to remove the two most left digits that are zero so our value after substraction will be 6666/10 = 666. But keep in mind to remove the value between 1 and 9 not 10 because the rounding function will divide the number by 10 and will result in a remainder that is rounded to 10.\n\n* To solve for the next Problem we need to put the equation as follows:\n`float x = (int) ((1/(float) (x/2)) < 3)` where float will equal half of the float's value. (int) will round it. (float) will convert a float into a float. Value divided by itself will provide the result. (x/2) is not working because it's a fraction so it will round to zero.\n\n* The solution for the fourth problem is to subtract 1 because we have 566 * (1/(float)) and (1/(float)) will round all values in this equation to 0 and in that case if it rounds a 3 to 3 it will give that result.\n\n```\npublic static int solve(int[] s) {\n    Solution sol = new Solution();\n    int result = sol.converted(s, 0, 0, \"Adam bought 3 kilogams of nuts and 3 kilograms dried fruits at Store.

In order to solve this problem, first you need to store 3 items at a time in a hash set in order to create the sequence of strings that you want.\nOnce you have written the code to read the sequence of strings, then you need to write some code that outputs the number of strings of length 3,4 and so on. \nThe first array should hold values like: 0,1,1,2. This means there were 0,1, and 2 strings of length 3.  \nThe second array should hold 0,1,2. Thus there were 0, 1, and 2 of strings of length 4.  \nThe third would hold 0, because there were only 2 strings of length at most 5.\nYou'd need an if in order to control the length of the current string length. \n\n##### D\nIn general, we can write a recursive function that starts with a single value and then recursively calls itself with any new subtrees. \n\n\n### Questions:\n\n### Solution\n##### A\n```java\npackage com.leetcode", "answer": "C: cupboard"}

We are told that there are four rows. So, in our first row, each row contains 10 people. We have 4 rows x 10 people = 40 people in the first row and we add that value to the total so far, which is the number of people, and we get 41. In the second row, there is one row that has 8 people and the other row has four people. So, the total number of people (41) is increased by 8 to get the number of people who will be in the stadium. The 42nd person to go in is in the second row. The total number is then increased by 42, and there is one more person than yesterday.

If that is the case, then you can see the solution as that which has an 8th power of 7 in the input (note: the denominator matters) which is:\n7^8\n\n#### Solution 2\nThis is fairly easy once you remember that in base 10 the addition of 10 means take the product of the two numbers you just multiplied, and take the remainder.  you do this until you get a single digit.\n\nSo 1 5 36 10 = 36\nBut since 36 is not divisible by 10  we add another digit, 10 and take the remainder: 2 = since 36 is now divisible by 12, and that we just took the remainder of the 2nd multiplication we divide it by 10 and take it mod 2\n\nSo that would be 48 15 90 10 = 9", "answer": "B: north pole"}

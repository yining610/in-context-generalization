The word has been linked since as early as 1526 when it was used in The Ship of Fools by Sebastian M\u00fcnster. Before the turkey became associated with Thanksgiving, some people believed they were unclean in relation to the Passover meal. This idea was propagated at the end of the 19th century by Henry M. Lacey. The image of turkey as clean and wholesome really took off in the 1930s through government-backed ad campaigns. The USDA even issued a special \u201cturkey-day\u201d stamp in 1956. These efforts helped boost demand for turkey in the US \u2013 from 167,000,000 pounds in 1947 to 1,100,00,00 pounds in 2001.

If you are, the program will display your choice.\n\nBelow is an explanation of the steps the program takes to reach its conclusion.\n\n  1. Make 8 random selections from the alphabet letters from A to E in no particular order.  Then put them in no particular order except for the letters C, D and E.  \nExample:  \nA, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, and B are the order chosen.  \n2. Get all of the letters in the alphabet besides the letters C, D, and E.  \nThis gives you a list of all the letters except for the four randomly chosen letters that are included in the first step.  \nIn the case of our example:  \n\"ABFGHJK\", which leaves us with letters A, F, G, and J.  \n3. For all letters, pick a random number from 1 to 9.  \n\"A\" = 4  \n\"F\" = 6  \n\"G\" = 4   \n\"J\" = 3  \n4. Combine the letters and the random number to create a new string.  \n\"AD\", \"EJ\", \"GF\"  \n5. Check if the letters are in the alphabet.  \n\"AD\" = true  \n\"EJ\" = true  \n  \"GF\" = false  \n6.

If the letters that are in the alphabet and in the order A, B, C, D, and/or E are in the same string, check if that string equals the result of putting in a set of 8 random letters in an alphabetically ordered way except for two letters and one more letter.  \nIn the example above:  \n7. \"AD\".

He likes to get out there a little early so that he has enough time to find a good place to park. He spots the last good open space about halfway down the parking lot and drives toward the front of the building to the passenger drop off point.  As he is walking toward the door, he sees that he has an invoice for payment from the vendor that had delivered some parts that he has not gotten around to ordering for his new project. He picks up the invoice and is just about to turn to the front when he sees a few more people coming out of the building to the sidewalk.  They are coming out a different exit than where he is going so he decides he can make it to the front before he has to pull out again.  He gets inside and has just enough time to say hi to the admin assistant before finding the stairs to get to the second floor where his office is.  He notices a few stray people on the floor heading toward his door and makes a mental note to let them in.  Just then a few people he knows walk in but before he can get to his door there is a group of people at the stairs.  It is getting later in the day so not sure where they came from since they did not work on this floor.  He stands in the door and waits patiently for them to figure out how to get up to the second floor.  One by one they notice the up arrow sign and begin to slowly move toward the stairs.  As they gather on each flight Tom is in their way so he steps up to the top and waits.  He then takes the time to glance at the invoice and sees the parts that he had ordered and was expecting to get as well as a reminder that he should take delivery of them sometime in the next couple weeks.  As he is working up the invoice for the third part of the day, the last guy in line finally gets to the stairs and takes one step up.\n\n### Outputs:\n\n### Demmisonet:", "answer": "B: satisfaction"}

We\u2019ll get the instructions from any of the input sources we can find, and we\u2019ll break down the instruction into multiple comprehensible clauses.\n\nWe can use [this](https://thecodingmachine.com/posts/coding-jobs-interviews/coding-tips/how-to-read-and-understand-any-coding-problem/) article by TheCodingMachine to know how to read complex, text-based programming instructions by breaking them down into multiple comprehensible sub components.\n\nThe second technique to be concerned with is the _breaking-down of instructions into a program sequence_. Our steps might be simple, but it might get difficult at times to understand which step in the sequence comes first and which comes last\u2014we could use [this](https//thecodingmachine.co/posts/codinginterview/coding-tipsi-step-bystep/how-to-break-down-coding-problem) article to demystify this step.\n\nThe third technique to be concerned with, at least for some of the coding tasks we\u2019ll see, is the use of [combinations](https://thecoderpad.com/blog/2015/12/30/27-computer-science-problems-explained/) to solve a task.

If the man bought 3 gallons of regular and 2 gallons of premium gas, how much did he spend filling up?\n\n### Note:Answers will vary based on whether you are using a metric or imperial system.  Choose an answer based on where you live.  (Choices:  A: 8 gallons / $16\n\n### Response (Demonstration)[1]. A is correct because the man bought 3 regular and 5 premium.  [2]. A is close, but since regular is more expensive, we will spend more of our budget on it and less of it on premium.  ([3]. B is correct because we use the gas prices from the first demonstration.  [4]. B is correct because the two tanks are of different size, 9 gallon regular vs 12 gallon premium. You can also do this:  If he bought 3 regular and premium and spent $10, the costs for each gallon would be $3.33.  If he bought 12 premium and 9 regular then the costs for each gallion would be $3.63.  $10/3.33 is the cheaper cost per gallon, $10/3 is the more expensive cost per gallon.

{"text": "A\n\n### Instructions:Analyze what was written and determine the best course of action.\n\n### Inference:If Adam spent 24 hours a day sleeping when young, can you figure out what he does to stay awake now?\n\n### Input-Inferences:Sleep is the unconscious state of a person, animal, and of some plants. In contrast to non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM), which is the other sleep stage, rem sleep is distinctive in having a highly organized, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep cycle. The sequence of REM and NREM states repeat in a cycle approximately every 90\u2013100 minutes throughout the night, and many of the cycles are lost at the end of the night after the person wakes up and must be consciously repeated the following morning.\n\nIn rem sleep, the sleeper is usually in a dream state that involves visual imagery and emotions along with the paralysis that prevents the sleeper from acting out their dream. Although the specific function of dreaming and rapid eye movement remains to be determined, the theory that the function of rem sleep is to integrate and help consolidate information from waking-life, and that the dream state is merely to be expected during this, has been well-validated.\n\nHowever, a controversial hypothesis, the sleep-driven-thought theory, suggests rem sleep (and dreaming in particular) helps store recently created memories and maintains their integrity; this is achieved by a process of integrating related material from the cerebral cortex to ensure consistency of interpretation, in a phenomenon known as memory consolidation. A great deal of scientific evidence supports this hypothesis while other theories, such as the hippocampal consolidation theory, have been proposed. Further research is needed to distinguish how rem sleep specifically contributes to memory consolidation.\n\n### Inputs-Response:If Adam spent 13% of his waking hours sleeping when young, do the following.\n\n### Response 1:Adam went to sleep less during the day.\n\n### Solution:Adam got a lot less sleep last night than when he was young because he's now a student.\n\n### Question 2:Which of the following statements regarding healthy weight is (are) true?", "answer": "A: good health"}

For the string we can make with index 0, there can only be one possible endpoint, index 0. We can start index i - 3, for index [i-3:i-1], there are two options: index i - 2 or index i - 1.\n\n#### Step 2: Check if every possible string with a possible endpoint is already in the list.\nOnce we have a list of all possible endpoints, we can write a function to check if a specific index is in the list of all possible endpoint or not. Note that this is not the index of the character, if it is there, the corresponding character would already be there. If a character's index is there, then the character would not be in the list.\n\n#### Step3: Go through the list and check if we have every possible string. If we have it, add it to the list. Otherwise we can output.\nOnce we have the list, we can check if every possible string is present. This is so we don't produce strings that are already there. If we have every possible string, then put that into the list. If not, output the new strings that we have", "answer": "D: illiterate"}

{"text": "You need to have 100% accuracy on this. The answer will be (D) \n\nThe stress response is an adaptive response by the body when exposed to stress. \nIt occurs when the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) releases the hormones epinephrine (adrenaline), \nnorepinephrine, and dopamine into body tissues, muscles, and organs to ready the body's systems. \nEpinephrine and related hormones increase heart rate and force of heartbeat. They dilate small arteries in skeletal muscles, \nmaking it easier to move and speeding up reaction time. Hormones constrict veins to reduce blood flow out of tissues, \nmaking more blood available for muscle use. The digestive and reproductive systems are suppressed. \nBreast secretions become stimulated, as the milk-producing alveoli in the breast become dilated. \nSex drive is reduced (less interest in sexual activity) due to falling levels of the sex hormone testosterone. \nLactation, however, is also increased, \nas prolactin, the stimulant for lactation, is also released. Dopamine, acetylcholine, and substance-P, \nall transmitter molecules, increase. More acetylcholine stimulates muscle contractions. Dopamine increases heart rate and affects muscle control. \nAcetylcholine, which transmits impulses from the peripheral (outside the brain and spinal cord) and autonomic (involuntary) nervous system \nand from the endocrine system, acts both in and outside the central nervous system. \nAll these mechanisms aid in the preparation of the body for fight or flight. Elevated epinephrine and norepinephrine \nare associated with heightened alertness and arousal.\n\n### Question:\n\nWhat is the primary function of the Stress Response?\n\n### Answer:\n\nReaction Time (R.T.) is the time elapsed between a stimulus being presented to a person and the person's response to the stimulus. \nBy comparing a subject's reaction time", "answer": "C: that you"}

Austria is the smallest country with its largest city being Vienna. What is the total number of cities in Austria.\n\n### Response\n\nYou could write answers like this:\n\nIf Austria has at least one city which is Vienna, then the answer is 1. If it has more than one city, the answer must not be 327. Thus the answer is 1, which is 100% correct.\n\nIf the answer is 2, that is the best answer. You can prove that if 2 people in Austria share the city then each of the countries surrounding Austria have 168 cities minus 2 cities shared because there are also two cities that are shared.

{"text": "If people were looking at the movement of the Earth, they would say that it was not moving.  Earth is a sphere, with no defined boundaries.  Therefore, one cannot identify where, precisely, it is moving.  If we imagine that people were looking at the surface itself, they could tell that it wasn't moving.  However, they would not realize that the Earth was rotating underneath them, and that this rotation accounts for the motion they see. If people were looking at the planet from outside of the Earth, they could observe the Earth rotating.  It would look as if it were moving without any real movement happening.  In this situation, people are looking at both the movement and non-movement simultaneously.  If people were looking at an eclipse, it would appear as if the moving planet were passing between the observer and the Sun.  Again, no real movement is actually occurring.  If people were watching a football game, they would also notice that the players are moving.  However, the football itself would never move in any of these circumstances.  People would be aware that the football is being tossed and that it is moving, but its motion would never stop, as Earth or the football would never stop rotating.

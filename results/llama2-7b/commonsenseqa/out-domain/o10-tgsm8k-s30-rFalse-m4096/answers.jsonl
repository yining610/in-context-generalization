(You may assume 1 <= x <= 9).\n\nIn the output example above you might think Boston is the answer because the first digit was a 1.\n\n### Solution:\nThis is a brute force challenge:  If all permutations are considered, the fastest way to solve is to go through the order, check, and discard the next.\n\nThe answer is Boston because it is the least significant number.  It is in the first position.  We then compare the second digit with the next lowest.  We can then cross that off and start in on the lowest.\n\nI would have solved it by using 3 nested for loops (I have not done this so the code may not be correct) where we go through the for each digit, check our current digit and the next, and see if that is less or if there is a digit less.\n\n```C++\nint main() {\n    int input=0;\n    //int result=0;\n\n    cin>>input;\n    int testCaseNumber = 0;\n    int length=3;\n    char myinput[3];\n    myinput[length] = '\\0';\n\n    int x;\n    int y;\n    int z;\n\n    scanf(\"%d%d\",&testCaseNumber,&length);\n\n    int nextDigit = input[0];\n    int currentDigit = input[length - 1];\n    int index = length - 1;\n    for(int i=0; i<length; i++){\n        x = input[i] - '0';\n        y = '0' - input[i - 1];\n\n        nextDigit ++;\n        currentDigit++;\n\n        char mydigits[3];", "answer": "B: construction site"}

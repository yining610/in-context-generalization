The man pulls a certain number of times in such a manner that the following results occurred:<n>  A row of 3 bars that is followed by a row of 2 and then nothing.<n>  A row of bars followed by nothing and then a row of 2.<n>  A row followed by 2 times in a row and then nothing.<n>Output: The lady was 10x more likely to win. Explanation: For example, there are 6 possible combinations that can occur in the first 3 pulls, all 4 that might follow next and the whole 14 combinations for the initial 6 pulls and the next 8 that follow.<n><n><n><n>#### Explanation:<n><n>The instructions describe a problem that can be solved by the simple model of probability. This means that the solution involves computing the probability of a particular outcome based on the total number of possible outcomes.<n>In the problem above the instructor wants us to calculate the number of the outcomes of the slot machine game in these two scenarios.<n><n>First, we should note that for a given scenario we need to find each possible combination of the game. That means computing combinations for each pull that follows. For example, in the first scenario we have 6 ways to get 3 bars initially which is (6C3) since there are (4C3) ways to pick 3 out of 4 that make the game winning one.<n>Then, picking each of these 6 winning games produces the following 8 next games (4C2*4C2) as an option for the next pulls.<n><n>We must then, add 6C3*4C2*4x4 to get 27 possible outcomes of the game.<n><n>Then, in the second approach for this scenario we will add the total number of possible outcome in six iterations of combinations for the initial pulls and then the next 8 pulls.<n><n>Adding them together we get the total of (6C3*4x4) + (4C3*4C3*4*4) which will give us 21 combinations for the game.<n><n>The same method is used in two of the questions above. The other question is an application of this skill to a word problem where the

She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: 44<n><n>Input: Zach is saving his money to buy a brand new bike that costs $100.  His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Output: 6<n><n>Input: Mark has kangaroos and goats.  Kangaroos have two legs and goats have four legs.  If he has 23 kangaroos and three times as many goats as kangaroos what is the total number of legs of all his animals?<n>Output: 322<n><n>Input:Jimmy wanted a beer but his wife was an alcoholic on probation.  Where might he go? Choices:  A: neighbor's house B: bridge C: home D: homeless shelter E: prison<n>Output:		B<n><n>Input: A number n<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>## Solution : Part I<n><n>Input -------> Output<n>89<--->44<n><n>We can easily see that input and output does not match. We only get the negative answer. We can also figure out that it must include two division operation. And from the 3rd question we know it use division. So I figure that the division must be integer type, because it's a multiple choice question and each option contain  a different type conversion.<n><n>## Solution :Part II<n><n>Input --------->  Output<n>23<--->2<n><n>Same situation. I think we can get the right output without any division. Maybe we can just use subtraction, because there is a condition that has 3 times more of goat than kangaroos and from the last question I figure that the operation in program need to be with integer (or long) type.<n><n>## Solution: Part III<n><n>Input---->Out put<n>k+g<--->k<n><n>We can figure it out if we see the option in question 5. Since the answer is an odd number. So we can only get a positive outcome if in our input is positive. But in our question, it doesn't need any negatives. It might be integer.<n>

What is the cheapest cost for growing all the types of rice?<n>Output: $152,905.00<n><n>Input: Making an exact fraction is easy.  If you start with 1, you take away 1, you have an exact fraction. If you start with 7/10, you take away 7 you have an exact fraction and the same way with 2/5 and 3/10, etc.  The same rules apply for adding.  If you add two different types of fractions, you MUST begin by adding the denominators.  Then, you add just as when you add two integers.  Let's review how to add the denominators by multiplying them by a common denominator.  For example, add 2/5 to 3/10.  Let's just do the 3's for now.  We say 5 multiplied by 2 is 10.  Multiply 10 by 10, which is 100.  The common denominator to add the 10's is 100 and the 100's are in the 100s place.  Thus, 2/

At the 6 o'clock hour the train left Boston. It travels at 45 miles per hour in a southwesterly direction.  At noon it left Portsmouth, New Hampshire and travesed a distance of 175 miles in 3 hours at an average rate of 22 miles per hour in a southeasterly direction.

A certain number of marbles are drawn.  The total number of marbles in the bag is reduced by the number of drawings.  The color of each of the drawn marbles is returned to the bag. What is the probability that a randomly chosen marble will be blue?<n>Output: 21/130<n><n>#### Explanation: <n>For the first question, Mary will have 44 stickers remaining because she used 3 large stickets and 7 stickers to decorate her journal. <n>#### For the second set of question I'd use a nested condition and 4 nested if.  However, it is important to understand that the question is looking for the total number of legs, therefore the answer would be the sum of the total number of legs for both the kangaroos and the goats (kangaroos, goats). <n>I'd also note that for question no 3 that the American South West (A) is correct.  For question no 3 and no doubt question 4 which has a similar question I can also eliminate choices, in this case, I'd eliminate choices A, B, and D because any other choice would be the answer since the horse derby always brings the biggest crowds to sport.<n>#### For the next question regarding trains. I'd do something similar to the previous question using the nested if.  For the final question about the marbles. I would use the sum function to answer the question.  This is because I am looking for the total number (blue), therefore just the sum of the total numbers will do.<n>#!/usr/bin/python3<n>import math<n>#First question<n><n>

How many minutes are in a day?<n>Output:answer in a comment<n><n>### The idea to be explained:<n><n>The idea of the solution is to start with the assumption that we want to use all items in a set and figure out the number of remaining items. This can be done easily by counting the amount of items used and then determining the amount of remaining items.<n><n>### The approach/algorithm:<n><n>First, we want to start off with the assumption that we have a set of items or variables which we want to solve for. Second, we start to break down our problem to smaller parts in order to come up with an efficient algorithm which will make our solution fast and efficient. <n><n>### Data Structures used: <n><n>we can use two data structures in this problem:<n>- A binary search tree (BST).<n>- An Array.<n><n>## Data:<n><n>The data sets in this file is a single input string. There needs to be 2 problems on the input string.<n><n>## Instruction:<n><n>There needs to be 2 different problems in the input file. <n>The format of each problem should be a string, the string should be a single sentence. In this case, it would be a question as in the title above. <n><n>## Output:<n><n>There needs be 2 output strings in this file. The first will be a single string. It will need to be returned the first answer of all the possible solutions for the problem given in the input.<n><n>The second output string will need to be in the form of a number. We will need to be able to determine the output given in the input as a string is equal to an integer. So basically, we want to find out what if the first answer given to us in our input string is actually a number. Thus, we need to create an integer out of a string.<n><n>## Source: <n><n>[CodingBat  - String Input, Two Input Problems](http://www.codingbat.com/prob/p120133)

I have 42 photos of the beach (excluding the first photo which is of me next to the sand castle).  I only had 30 photos of my trip to the mountain.  After each photo I created the name of the location.  I kept the same name for a series of matching locations (ex. I have a photo of a mountain, I don't have a photo of a volcano, but I have a photo of another type of mountain).  In my mountain photos how many photos do I have of the mountain, the snowy peaks, a waterfall or a view from a glacier?  <n>Answer: 20-19+1=30<n><n>### Input<n>I got the following number from a combination lock.

By doing this with each combination of the 3 digits I can narrow down other options.  However, the best way to know the password is the look for the combination that matches in the following way: 1st,3rd,5th.  How many numbers does the password have, assuming that it must be five digits long (assume the number of combinations have not been altered, ie 1800)?<n><n>answer should include number of digits that has 3rd digit is last digit plus 4th digit is 2nd digit, 5th digit is 1st digit plus 6th digit is last digit and 7th digit is 3rd digit plus 8th digit is last digit.<n><n>### input : A large container was a diment a dozen.

How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Answer: 44<n><n>Input: Zach is saving his money to buy a brand new bike that costs $100.  His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Answer: 6<n><n>Input: Mark has kangaroos and goats.  Kangaroos have two legs and goats have four legs.

I am your mother."<n><n>### Demostration "A. The answer is (yes)."<n><n>### Input <n>A: I used "Are you my mother" for one hundred years.  It is quite remarkable how old this game is, and that this is the first time I have ever seen it!<n>B: Really?<n><n>### Demostration "B. The answer is (no)"<n><n>### Instuctions:  Give your reasoning of why that is the case.<n><n>### Disscussion:<n>Reasoning: It is one hundred years since you started playing this game of "Are you my mother?". It is surprising how old this game is and how it hasn't been played over a long period of time, which means this is the first time you've ever seen it? The first thing I thought of was that this is a new game; it is a newer game for everyone and nobody has seen it before, which proves to be quite amazing for how long the game has been around. If the game had been played a lot before then the amount of people that have seen the game before, therefore wouldn't be a lot, but there isn't really a set amount of possible answers and this is new for everyone and it's a game that is quite hard to do, which would be why nobody has seen it before. What this would also mean is that you are the first one to ever see this specific game. This explains the comment that you made: I'm the most beautiful one in the world.<n><n>

If he has 23 kangaroos and three times as many goats as kangaroos what is the total number of legs of all his animals?<n>Answer: 322<n><n>### Input:What could contain no more than around 100 people? Choices:  A: apartment B: classroom C: buildings D: car E: audience<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>* Example text: I think the maximum number of people in a car would be, like, 6-8. Then it is hard to get out or put people in etc. And the most people I ever see in an apartment is around 25, probably not right. Same for a classroom and same for a large building. And I think around 100 is probably the most number of people you can get in an audience in a theater.<n><n>### Input & Demonstration:Which of these statements is the most precise? Select the statement that applies to your answer.<n><n>### A: It is better to be too generous and apologize or give something away than not to give enough or not to give anything when someone asks you for help.<n><n>B: It may seem kind to help someone even when they haven't asked you for help.<n>But you never know when it might be kindness not to help someone when they ask you to.<n><n>C: The more precise answer is when someone asks for help, then it's better to give too much rather than too little.  To be able to make a judgment call on this, it takes experience.  I have to say it depends on person X and person Y. Some people may take or not take things, then they regret it.  But in the end I feel that when someone is really in a bind, if you don't help them and they come to you afterwards, then of course you shouldn't help. Because what else could you do?  But if you can help in any way, why don't you help them then and apologize later?<n><n>D: You should help people all the time without asking.<n><n><n>### Input and Demonstration:Write some numbers that would make it likely you could be right. For example you could say that 35% of the time your team wins, your team loses, and the rest of the time it ties.  Or if you are really sure you could say something like "28% of the time my team would win and 28% would lose and 44% would tie" and these all will be the best possible numbers to help you in this case.<n><n>### Answer and Demonstration Answer: I have to tell you that I don't know my team's record well enough to answer this question.

Choices:  A: being married B: sisters C: marriage D: two people E: lawyer<n><n>### Response:		If you're trying to get a divorce, then you're "end[ing] [a] relationship status." You're not going to talk to a divorce lawyer, who is not someone's sister nor a fellow being married, about ending a relationship status in which they are married. You could talk to a divorce attorney about your marriage being dissolved, or perhaps even your relationship with your spouse (especially with respect to the divorce) ceasing.<n><n>You wouldn't talk to your lawyer about getting a divorced, either. You'd ask to talk to an attorney about getting a divorce.<n><n>So, if you want to call what you're trying to do "end[ing] a relationship status", your choices are C and D. Goats are mammals with four legs, while kangaroos are marsupials that have two legs. Therefore, the total number of legs that your animals have when you have a kangaroo and three times as many additional goats as kangaros are together is four. So, option "E" is also a correct answer.<n><n>### Input<n>A dog ran around the yard 50 times then sat down.

You have no way of determining whether this coin is fair(meaning it has an equal chance of landing head-side up and tail-side up for each of 100 flips) or not fair (meaning there is a biased chance of the coin landing head-side up or tail-side up). The probability of a fair coin landing heads up or tails up on the very first flip is.50. If you were to flip heads the probability of landing a tail in the subsequent 99 flips is.49. The probability of flipping a tail at any given flip while the coin remains fair is.49. If the coin is not fair the probability of landing a head is only.50 and the probability of landing a different(not a head) is.51. For how many flips would you conclude that the coin is fair when it is in fact not fair?<n><n>### Example<n>Input: If I were to flip a coin 14 times what is the chance it will land on heads at least 8 times?<n><n>Output: At least 8  The probability of the coin landing on heads at least 5 times when it is in-fact not fair would be.49x14. The probability of the coin not landing on heads at least once in that same flipping scenario would be (1-.49)^14 which calculates to.51^14..49*14 is 7.0%.51^

This task is going to have you building a very easy to use program. It will be pretty simple, but it will help you get into what I want you to learn.  Think about the idea if someone is walking or cycling around they may not want to take the long way (the highway) just to get around the city. You should build the program as if a rider of the bike or the walker or the driver of the car decided to use your program he or she could easily plan a route without using any other software than what you provide to them. <n><n>### Demostration:<n>Now, lets say they want to go from their house to the nearest library, they can simply use the program to do this. Also, once they figure out where the library is, they can also simply figure out the next closest Starbucks or Pizza Hut or McDonalds. They could then simply plan out their entire trip without knowing anything, simply asking the system for directions for each step all the way. That means that you will have to design it so that if they are to head down the highway they don't end up getting off and then later getting back on the highway without ever hitting any of the intersections.<n><n>### Demo:<n>After you make the program, you will have to figure it all out on your own using the libraries and resources we will give you.<n><n>### Response<n>I will create a program in which the user can enter a location and then receive route directions that they can use to find there way there.<n><n>### Task :<n>### Demostrate:<n>A program that can read a file of addresses that contain the location of various places that a driver or bicyclist wants to go to.<n><n>### DEMO<n>A program that will use OO to write and save a file with an input from the user.<n><n>### TASK<n>Write a function that asks for a filename from the user.<n>Read in the first line and store it as a string in the variable File<n>Read in the second line and store it as int variables A, B and C.<n>Write each variable to the console: A, B, C<n><n>### DEMONSTRATIVE :<n>Ask for a line of text

Grade: 3rd<n>3. School: Lincoln School<n>4. Teacher: Mrs. Jones<n>5. Number of people in the class: 30<n><n>1. I have 68 beads. I used 7 beads to make 4 string bracelets. How many beads remain?<n><n>#### Input<n>75% of Mary's teachers have pets.<n><n>#### Response<n>I believe the correct answer is A. Pythagoras stated: "If we apply the sum of the squares theorem, the sum of the squares of two sides will always equal the square of the third side." This is the formula of the triangle. By applying these two theorems, we will solve 75% of 1 = x^2 = 75% of a square. When dividing both sides by 75%, we have x = 1. Thus, I believe that the correct answer is A, 75% have pets.<n>

A hat isn't a strong option to protect you from a cannon because it would allow the bullet to easily penetrate the fabric.<n><n>### Input<n>A 4 year old wants a dog.

They are only 4 years old and they'll have very basic understanding about how to handle the dog.  Also the mom doesnt want one which means that the dad is still taking all the responsibility of a dog.  I think the dad really needs to do research if the mom still wants the kids to get a dog.<n><n>

This involves high repetition movements, so ensure you’re properly warmed -up before going into this type of activity. <n><n>Lastly, a preflight check is done to check any possible concerns that could affect your gameplay.

In your response, keep it simple and straight to the point. <n>- For multiple choice questions, make sure to include each multiple choice question within it's own question.<n>- This task can also be used for students on Accelerated Reading (AR).<n><n>### Response Examples:<n><n>#### Response 1:<n><n>- Mark has an integer variable named 'kangaroosCount'. He has an integer variable named "goatsCount" and an integer variable named 'totalLeapLegs'.<n>- Initially, the variable 'totalLeapLeg' has a value of 0. After initialization, he adds three times the value of 'kangroosCount' to the value of goatsCount' and then subtracts the value of kangroosCount from the value of goats Count. This will give the value of 'totalLeapLeg'.<n>- Then if we add 'totalLeapLegCount' to 'kangroosCounter' we get the number of kangroos legs and the number of goats legs. We can then combine that by subtracting that number. Then divide that by the multiplication of three and the addition of one.<n><n>#### Example 1:<n><n>```<n><n>Mark.java<n><n>public class Mark {<n><n>    private static int kangroosCount;<n>    private static int goatsCount;<n>    private int totalLeapLegs;<n>    private int kangroosCounter = 0;<n>    private int goatsCounter = 0; <n>    public Mark(int kangroosCount, int goatsCount) {<n>        this.kangroosCount = kangroosCount ;<n>        this.goatsCount = goatsCount;<n>        totalLeapLegs = 0 ;<n>    }<n>    public void increment(int kCount) {<n>        goatsCounter = 3 * goatsCount + 1 ;<n>        kangroosCount = 3 * kangroosCount

You don't just wake up one day and know how to sew.  You need to learn the skill through a teacher, you need to practice it and improve.  Writing is how you get to express your ideas.  And finally creative people have a little more than others.    <n><n><n><n>### Input:'Do you like it'?<n><n>### Demostration: <n><n>#### Input:Do you like it<n><n>#### Output:Yes<n><n>#### Why:<n><n>#### Output: No<n><n>#### Why: <n><n>

Choices:  A: library B: parties C: kindergarten class D: bar E: school<n><n>### Response:		library<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>If a student was about (1) to graduate, that means that the student is (1) the age that someone should (2) graduate high school/university. When you say that someone is attending a bar, there is no sense to mention that they are not attending parties since it should be natural for someone of that specific age and level, to attend parties. It might be an unusual occurrence, but one that would occur more or less the case. Kindergarten class is an odd one in this case and might be wrong since it is a course specific for children of 5-6 years old. School could either be that you are not attending a kindergarten class or that you are attending college, and if that were the case, you would still be attending school even once you graduate.<n><n>### Check answers:A. falseB. trueC. trueD. trueE. true<n><n>### Solution 2:<n>If a student was (1) about to graduate, there is the possibility of them still having a part of the same school year, where in which case they (2) continue to attend the school. Kindergarten class and parties could be both attending school and graduation is related to the age mentioned. It is not necessary to include that someone will not attend kindergarten class, but rather just to note that they go on to another level of education, even if this case they will continue attending the same institution. Bar is the right choice, not because of it being related to alcohol, but rather for the fact that it is often an establishment that gathers adults to drink. School is once again not necessarily incorrect, although more unusual to use in a case in which graduation is considered.<n><n>### Solution3<n>A kindergarten class, as a concept is associated to be more of a child activity. Hence, it is unlikely that someone would want to go to a kindergarten class if they are already 21. This is the same for parties as they are similar child oriented activities.<n>These are not directly related to the context in which the prompt is written.<n><n>School is a misnomer as it is simply saying that the person is attending school still. One may be going to high school or a lower level while attending university.<n><n>Bar is a reasonable choice as an establishment, but still

Choices:  A: eat cake B: buy C: interests D: complex E: learn about<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>This is because in the beginning of the sentence when she was looking at it, it was an "orange thing", which is a thing she has never seen before.  I learned that if the word "thing" is at the beginning of a sentence, the person is interested or going to examine something.<n><n>### Input The word is that there's an apple and there's an orange.  What type of fruit is at least one and one half times greater than both of these?<n><n>### Response<n><n>I'm still confused about this question.  In the options, there is a green apple and a yellow one.  Why does the choice say apple?  Is there a typo that it should say orange again?<n><n>### Input A word that contains the letters _t_ and _s_ that is 7 letters long.  What letter comes next in the sequence?<n><n>### Choices:<n>A: eB: rC: sD: tE: uF: y	<n><n>### Response	<n><n>I know that when choosing vowels, you can pick either a or e.  So I'm going to think this is a vowel problem.  There are a and e in the sequence of letters, which must be either in the beginning or end of the word.  A is before e, so e must be before or after a.  So e is after a.  I'm not sure where a and e fit in the words after e though.<n>

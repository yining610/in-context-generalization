If the game had been played a lot before then the amount of people that have seen the game before, therefore wouldn't be a lot, but there isn't really a set amount of possible answers and this is new for everyone and it's a game that is quite hard to do, which would be why nobody has seen it before.

You have no way of determining whether this coin is fair(meaning it has an equal chance of landing head-side up and tail-side up for each of 100 flips) or not fair (meaning there is a biased chance of the coin landing head-side up or tail-side up). The probability of a fair coin landing heads up or tails up on the very first flip is.50. If you were to flip heads the probability of landing a tail in the subsequent 99 flips is.49. The probability of flipping a tail at any given flip while the coin remains fair is.49. If the coin is not fair the probability of landing a head is only.50 and the probability of landing a different(not a head) is.51. For how many flips would you conclude that the coin is fair when it is in fact not fair?\n\n### Example\nInput: If I were to flip a coin 14 times what is the chance it will land on heads at least 8 times?\n\nOutput: At least 8  The probability of the coin landing on heads at least 5 times when it is in-fact not fair would be.49x14. The probability of the coin not landing on heads at least once in that same flipping scenario would be (1-.49)^14 which calculates to.51^14..49*14 is 7.0%.51^", "answer": "A: suicide"}

{"text": "**Instruction:Answer the following open-ended question** The most important task an athlete faces while playing a sport is the performance after their warm-up.\nThe warm-up has four main benefits:\n\n* Relaxing the body into the event\n\n* Preparing the body for the physical demands of the event\n\n* Requiring a small amount of energy so that energy is left on the bench at the game\u2019s finish\n\n* Easing tension\n\nThere are a few warm-up techniques that athletes can use to ensure the proper execution of a game plan. The main three being visualization, active stretching and a pre-flight check.\n\nIn general, visualization is the practice of using the mind to picture a desired outcome, which results in mental rehearsal of that outcome. It helps to improve skills and performance, especially for complicated movements that require coordination, strength and speed.\n\nDifferent types of exercise can help to improve one's physical abilities before a game or match. These include static stretch, passive stretch, active stretching and dynamic stretch. \n\nPassive stretching involves simply stretching the joint and holding for 20-30 seconds without moving to the next position to maintain elasticity and range of motion. This technique should be limited only to when you're extremely warmed-up. Dynamic stretching involve movements that require active muscle contractions and joint movements. This involves high repetition movements, so ensure you\u2019re properly warmed -up before going into this type of activity. \n\nLastly, a preflight check is done to check any possible concerns that could affect your gameplay. It is a great way to ensure that you\u2019ve remembered everything you need and that you\u2019ve given yourself enough time to prepare for the biggest games or contests of your life. \n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: Alex has 5 green apples, 6 pears, 1 orange and 2 tangerines in his lunch box.

In your response, keep it simple and straight to the point. \n- For multiple choice questions, make sure to include each multiple choice question within it's own question.\n- This task can also be used for students on Accelerated Reading (AR).\n\n### Response Examples:\n\n#### Response 1:\n\n- Mark has an integer variable named 'kangaroosCount'. He has an integer variable named \"goatsCount\" and an integer variable named 'totalLeapLegs'.\n- Initially, the variable 'totalLeapLeg' has a value of 0. After initialization, he adds three times the value of 'kangroosCount' to the value of goatsCount' and then subtracts the value of kangroosCount from the value of goats Count. This will give the value of 'totalLeapLeg'.\n- Then if we add 'totalLeapLegCount' to 'kangroosCounter' we get the number of kangroos legs and the number of goats legs. We can then combine that by subtracting that number. Then divide that by the multiplication of three and the addition of one.\n\n#### Example 1:\n\n```\n\nMark.java\n\npublic class Mark {\n\n    private static int kangroosCount;\n    private static int goatsCount;\n    private int totalLeapLegs;\n    private int kangroosCounter = 0;\n    private int goatsCounter = 0; \n    public Mark(int kangroosCount, int goatsCount) {\n        this.kangroosCount = kangroosCount ;\n        this.goatsCount = goatsCount;\n        totalLeapLegs = 0 ;\n    }\n    public void increment(int kCount) {\n        goatsCounter = 3 * goatsCount + 1 ;\n        kangroosCount = 3 * kangroosCount", "answer": "C: corner"}

{"text": "library\n\n### Solution:\n\nIf a student was about (1) to graduate, that means that the student is (1) the age that someone should (2) graduate high school/university. When you say that someone is attending a bar, there is no sense to mention that they are not attending parties since it should be natural for someone of that specific age and level, to attend parties. It might be an unusual occurrence, but one that would occur more or less the case. Kindergarten class is an odd one in this case and might be wrong since it is a course specific for children of 5-6 years old. School could either be that you are not attending a kindergarten class or that you are attending college, and if that were the case, you would still be attending school even once you graduate.\n\n### Check answers:A. falseB. trueC. trueD. trueE. true\n\n### Solution 2:\nIf a student was (1) about to graduate, there is the possibility of them still having a part of the same school year, where in which case they (2) continue to attend the school. Kindergarten class and parties could be both attending school and graduation is related to the age mentioned. It is not necessary to include that someone will not attend kindergarten class, but rather just to note that they go on to another level of education, even if this case they will continue attending the same institution. Bar is the right choice, not because of it being related to alcohol, but rather for the fact that it is often an establishment that gathers adults to drink. School is once again not necessarily incorrect, although more unusual to use in a case in which graduation is considered.\n\n### Solution3\nA kindergarten class, as a concept is associated to be more of a child activity. Hence, it is unlikely that someone would want to go to a kindergarten class if they are already 21. This is the same for parties as they are similar child oriented activities.\nThese are not directly related to the context in which the prompt is written.\n\nSchool is a misnomer as it is simply saying that the person is attending school still. One may be going to high school or a lower level while attending university.\n\nBar is a reasonable choice as an establishment, but still", "answer": "E: school"}

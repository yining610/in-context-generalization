The man pulls a certain number of times in such a manner that the following results occurred:\n  A row of 3 bars that is followed by a row of 2 and then nothing.\n  A row of bars followed by nothing and then a row of 2.\n  A row followed by 2 times in a row and then nothing.\nOutput: The lady was 10x more likely to win. Explanation: For example, there are 6 possible combinations that can occur in the first 3 pulls, all 4 that might follow next and the whole 14 combinations for the initial 6 pulls and the next 8 that follow.\n\n\n\n#### Explanation:\n\nThe instructions describe a problem that can be solved by the simple model of probability. This means that the solution involves computing the probability of a particular outcome based on the total number of possible outcomes.\nIn the problem above the instructor wants us to calculate the number of the outcomes of the slot machine game in these two scenarios.\n\nFirst, we should note that for a given scenario we need to find each possible combination of the game. That means computing combinations for each pull that follows. For example, in the first scenario we have 6 ways to get 3 bars initially which is (6C3) since there are (4C3) ways to pick 3 out of 4 that make the game winning one.\nThen, picking each of these 6 winning games produces the following 8 next games (4C2*4C2) as an option for the next pulls.\n\nWe must then, add 6C3*4C2*4x4 to get 27 possible outcomes of the game.\n\nThen, in the second approach for this scenario we will add the total number of possible outcome in six iterations of combinations for the initial pulls and then the next 8 pulls.\n\nAdding them together we get the total of (6C3*4x4) + (4C3*4C3*4*4) which will give us 21 combinations for the game.\n\nThe same method is used in two of the questions above.

You give birth to one cow a year who you keep, and you sell the rest of the herd for $160/cow plus all of the vet bills. The first year, your grandmother gives you a grant for $3800 so that you can buy the cows you can't afford, and you also have $1100 in credit cards to pay off over the course of a year. Your grandma doesn't care what you do with the cows, and offers to let you borrow her truck at any point to help you move cows around your farmland.

If you start with 1, you take away 1, you have an exact fraction. If you start with 7/10, you take away 7 you have an exact fraction and the same way with 2/5 and 3/10, etc.  The same rules apply for adding.  If you add two different types of fractions, you MUST begin by adding the denominators.  Then, you add just as when you add two integers.  Let's review how to add the denominators by multiplying them by a common denominator.  For example, add 2/5 to 3/10.  Let's just do the 3's for now.  We say 5 multiplied by 2 is 10.  Multiply 10 by 10, which is 100.  The common denominator to add the 10's is 100 and the 100's are in the 100s place.  Thus, 2/", "answer": "E: town"}

However, it is important to understand that the question is looking for the total number of legs, therefore the answer would be the sum of the total number of legs for both the kangaroos and the goats (kangaroos, goats). \nI'd also note that for question no 3 that the American South West (A) is correct.  For question no 3 and no doubt question 4 which has a similar question I can also eliminate choices, in this case, I'd eliminate choices A, B, and D because any other choice would be the answer since the horse derby always brings the biggest crowds to sport.\n#### For the next question regarding trains. I'd do something similar to the previous question using the nested if.  For the final question about the marbles. I would use the sum function to answer the question.

{"text": "answer in a comment\n\nInput: 54 hours.  How many minutes are in a day?\nOutput:answer in a comment\n\n### The idea to be explained:\n\nThe idea of the solution is to start with the assumption that we want to use all items in a set and figure out the number of remaining items. This can be done easily by counting the amount of items used and then determining the amount of remaining items.\n\n### The approach/algorithm:\n\nFirst, we want to start off with the assumption that we have a set of items or variables which we want to solve for. Second, we start to break down our problem to smaller parts in order to come up with an efficient algorithm which will make our solution fast and efficient. \n\n### Data Structures used: \n\nwe can use two data structures in this problem:\n- A binary search tree (BST).\n- An Array.\n\n## Data:\n\nThe data sets in this file is a single input string. There needs to be 2 problems on the input string.\n\n## Instruction:\n\nThere needs to be 2 different problems in the input file. \nThe format of each problem should be a string, the string should be a single sentence. In this case, it would be a question as in the title above. \n\n## Output:\n\nThere needs be 2 output strings in this file. The first will be a single string. It will need to be returned the first answer of all the possible solutions for the problem given in the input.\n\nThe second output string will need to be in the form of a number. We will need to be able to determine the output given in the input as a string is equal to an integer. So basically, we want to find out what if the first answer given to us in our input string is actually a number. Thus, we need to create an integer out of a string.\n\n## Source: \n\n[CodingBat  - String Input, Two Input Problems](http://www.codingbat.com/prob/p120133)", "answer": "D: field of flowers"}

All the guests are couples. Each couple is to receive $200 more than the combined amount they spend on their own. How much money should be divided to each guest?\nOutput: After we have determined the spending of each couple we will be able to allocate dollars to each recipient. After we find the spending of each person we will have to subtract the total budget from the individual, and the result of this will be the portion they should receive.\nLet X1 = $Joe + Karen\nLet X2 = $Marcos + Jamila\nNow the total spending = (X1 +X2). The total spending = $2250\nThen, the total individual spending = $300(X1+X2) - $2250 = $300*2250 - 2250 = 150\nThen the total individual spending per couple = $150\nAfter we subtract $150, it gives us $250 to be divided for each couple\n$250 is divided for each couple since it is $200 more that the amount of each recipient spend on their own\nWe conclude that for each couple we have to subtract $200 and keep $250\nNow, we will find the total allocation\nTo find the total allocation of each guest, we will add the spending of them and subtract $200 from the total spending.\nThe total spending\n$222250 + $200 + $195 + $1825 + $", "answer": "B: finger"}

For example: if they want to go to a city that has beach access: there are a 10 million city/town, on a scale of 1-5, 5 meaning the most beaches and 1 meaning the least amount of beaches, they'd take 3 city on a beach that has 23/10 00 000 =<<23/10000=0.023>>0.023 and the city would get 28% of the vacation. So, they would want a city where they can find beaches easily and have a relaxing time on their vacation, such as a beach side city, but not a resort, because of the 28%.\nSo then, of the 28%, who is looking to go to vacation in winter, have 5 cities and they will travel to the one where most of the people who liked that city will go. But the 23% will look for more cities that best suit them and go 3, because the most they will travel to in this case is where the most amount of beaches are and this is because they want to have a good vacation.\nSo then, if they see two cities that both have more of the thing they enjoy than any other city: They will be satisfied with either of these cities.\n\nInput: If 50% of people in America prefer 20% of food, what's do 30% of people prefer?\nOutput: If 50/2 =<<50/2=25>>=2.5 of people", "answer": "A: home"}

Your answer should include the number of nails you will use.\nOutput: As a carpenter, you should only use wood screws (1/4 of them) to hold the door secure, while using a regular nail (1/3 of them) for the rest.

Three children have the same number of siblings, one girl has 2 less siblings than the number of children in this class and 3 girls have twice as many siblings as the number of children in class. How many children in this class have one sibling in total?\nOutput: The one girl that has two less siblings has 28+2=<<28+2=2a>>2a, 28 is the number of children in total, so the one girl has two fewer.\nOne girl and three other girls have 2x the number of siblings as children in total, so they each have 4x + 1 = <<4x+1=7>>7.\nEach of these 4 girls had 2 more siblings than each of the boys, so each boy has fewer than each girl. If we take away the 4 girls with 2 more siblings, the number of boys in total who are in this class equals the remainder divided by 2, <<4*2=8>>8, so they have one sibling.\nHowever, there are 3 other girls that have 2x as many siblings as each boy, so they each have three siblings.\nSubtracting these three girls from the total, we are left with one girl with 4 siblings, and 5 girls with 3 siblings.\nLet x be the number of girls with 3 sibling.\n3x = <<3x=5>>5 girls\nx=<<1=1>>1 girl\nThat girl had 4 siblings.\nSo the numbers of siblings are: 4 for that girl, 1 for 5 girls, 2 for one girl, and 3 for three girls.\nThen one boy has 7 - 4 = <<7-4=3>>3 siblings, and one boy has 1.\nSo the final number is 2, as that is the answer for our input.\n\nInput:There are 189 students in the school.

If each drives two hours, their trip takes 4 hours.  If each drives one hour, the trip takes seven hours.  Who made the best choice and why?\nOutput: The best choice is for three of them to drive at normal rates and the fourth to drive extremely slowly in order to get to the destination faster.\nFirst, observe the \"normal\" driving rate of three of them in less than the total trip time.  If this were the case, then a single more moderate drive over the usual drive time for even one would result in the same trip time.\nNow, contrast the alternative case with extra driving time.  In this instance, if a single more moderate passenger drove for two extra hours out of the total trip, they would finish two hours earlier.  The final traveler, who had to deal with three extreme drivers, would end up driving three more hours due to the extra distance caused by the extra time it took to get to the destination.\nSo the final solution is that the fourth passenger should have been the one in the car with the average speed.\n\nComment List:\n* @KellyB\n* @AliBlair\n* @RubyRockler\n* @Amilore1\n* @Sarah\n* @RubySarah\n* Amy Sears\n* @MelissaTaylor\n* @SaraiMendoza\n* @AshleyS\n* @MelanieL\n* @MicaelaPineda\n* @ZachPuppe4\n* @NatalieHudson\n* @AmyHudson1\n* Alisha\n* @TaniaHudson\n*@Mason\n* @j", "answer": "B: names"}

How much will it cost to send a 5 ounce letter under the same circumstances?\nOutput: The formula for multiplication is <number1*number2>, so the formula for division is <number1/number2>.\nI know that the formula for division is 3.49/3 because 3.49 goes into 3 3 times.\nThe problem now is I need to determine how many times 3.49 will go into 5 ounces.\nWell, 5 oz equals 0.375 lb.\nTherefore, 0.378/0.375, which is around 1.\nTherefore, divide 3.49 by 5 and it will equal 0.718.\nDivide both sides of the equation by 3 and you will get 0.246.\nIf you use this formula, it will be 24.6 cents for a 5 ounce item.\nSo the final cost will be 5*$.246 = <<5*.246=1.224>>1.224\nSo the final answer would be 1.224 for the cost of a 5 ounce package\n\nInput:A man in ate too many pizzas to sharewith his and fourfriends.

However, he always needs to pay for at least 1/2 gallon of gasoline each week. If this man always buys 6/11 of a gallon at each station, which station is paid more than the other?\nOutput: The price each station charges is the same each week, so 6/11 gallons at each station is not significant.\nBecause this man pays for at least 1 gallon for each week, 1/2 gallons is the minimum he pays at each station, resulting in the man paying $1/2 gallon for a total of 2/11 gallons.\nSince a gallon contains 15/11 gallons, 1/2 of a gallon of gas is 3/11-gallon, meaning the first station is paid 4 gallons, while the second station is paid 3 gallons.\nTherefore, station 1 is paid 4 gallon, while station 2 is paid 3 gallon.\nSo the final man goes to 4 gallons, 3 gallons. Thus the final answer is station 1\n\nInput: Mr. Johnson will spend $120 on 7 fruit baskets at $83 each and 37 fruit baskets (7 baskets at $108, 31 baskets at $3, and 10 baskets at $5).

If the tractors cannot share the field, then how many different farming arrangements are possible?\nOutput: In total, the tractors can farm 1200 square feet.\nIf one tractor is farming by itself, it can farm 800 square feet. And if both tractors are farming at the same time, they can farm together for a total of 2400 square feet. So there are 2 options: one tractor farming and both tractors farming.\nSo the different ways to farm each add up to: ((1/(2))+(1/(2))) = ((1/2)+(1/2)) = <<(1/2+1/2)=1>>1\nBecause of this, we can write this as ((2 * 1)/(2)/(2)) = ((2*1)/2)/(2).\nOr: ((2*1)/1)/(2).\nSince 1/1 = 1, we now are left with ((2*1)/(1)/(2)) = <<2*1/(1)/(2)=2>>2\nSo there are exactly 2 different ways of farming.\nSo there are exactly two different farming arrangements that are possible.\n\nInput: Jack has two bags that contain one dollar each.

In addition to the tax, 2 percent of the cost price is also paid as a sales tax for liquor. A retailer purchases 500 liters of liquor at a cost of $30 per liter, and sells the liquor at $2.50 per liter and $500 in profit. How much tax will the retailer have to pay, if he collects the sales tax?\nOutput: In the first place, he can charge $2.60 per liter as he only has to charge tax on sale price not the cost price. But since he is earning $30 extra per each 50 liter, he has to include the tax. So he can only subtract $30 from the price of $2.60, making the reduced selling price $1.60\nThe cost price was calculated as $30 x 15, giving you $450.\nThe taxes can only be paid on the cost price. So the tax collected will be $450 x 0.02(t/100) = $9, i.e., $19 per 15 liters, $30 on cost price.\nIf the cost price was at $6 per liter, then tax collected is $6 x (120/70)*0.02 = $25\nIf the cost price is $8 per liter, then, tax collected is $8 x (120)/80)*0.0001 = $2\n\nInput: Sarah found out her brother bought a pair of jeans.

Choices: 1. \"September\" 2. \"ends\" 3. \"will\" 4. \"I\"\nOutput:This is a tricky question. From the question, \"What word is being emphasized?\" We can clearly see that the word \"September\" is in red letters. If we were to use the question of \"What word has been emphasized?\" we can clearly see that \"ends\" has been emphasized in red. To answer the question, we must use context clues to answer the question. In the first three lines, the band says the following:\n> Wake me up when September\n> ends,\n> find me when I'm sleeping\n> again.\nThis clearly lets us know that the word \"september\" will be in red, so it must be choice 1.\nThe next two lines say:\n> make a change, make it real,\n> stand alone, take a look\n> around you ask\n> \"Is this the real\n> life?\"\nWhile there are still three words in red, we must examine the question. The question is, \"What word has been emphaiszed in red?\" Since all three words are said to be in red, no word can be emphasized.\nSo the answer is 4\n\nInput:The population of the Earth increased by 1 million between 2002 and 2010.

How many times is the ball's diameter equal to 4 inches?\nOutput: To find the number of times 4 inches is the whole diameter, simply multiply the diameter (3 feet) by 100 so that the diameter is in terms of feet.\n4*inch = 4*foot/100 = <<4/100=4/100>>4/100 feet.\nTherefore, 4/100 = 4/10 x 4 = <<4/18=1/4>>1/4 times that the diameter equals 4 inches.\nSince the ball is 4 inches in diameter, it also has 4/10 = <<4/2>=2>>2 times as much surface area = 8 times as much space.\nSo the final answers are 1/4 and 8\n\nInput: Truckers are usually required to drive 10 consecutive hours each day, with 8 hours as the maximum amount of time they can drive before taking a break. If truckers are required to break after 10 straight hours, do not count their drive back to the home base as part of their consecutive hours, and do not count sleeping time as consecutive driving time, how many hours in a day can a trucker legally drive?\nOutput: The truckers have 10:00 AM-10:00 PM or 10:0pm-start your day the next day as their possible drive time.\nThere are at least 12 hours that can be driven each day with this restriction.\nThis means the total number of hours that can be drive in a week, using this restriction is 12 * 5 = <<12*5=120>>360.\nSo the correct answer would be 12:00 AM-Midnight, 360 hours.\n\nInput: When is the next leap year, starting from March 1, 2014?\nOutput: The leap years are from Jan1=319641-March1=<<<<31964-12=123>>12", "answer": "C: dangerous"}

You have done some course work, but you want to do more. If every day you can work continuously for four hours or 25% of that day then, on what day will you work for six hours?\nOutput: Assuming your days are Monday to Sunday, you have done some course work.\nYou have 6 days, each of which allows you to work continuously for 4 hours for 1 day, or 25% for 6 days.  If you have done some coursework, then you only need to work for 100 % for 3 days.\nThe remainder 3 days, or (100-75)/10 will allow you to do as much continuous work as possible.\nIn the case of only having to work continuously for half of a day, you could work 4 hours, or 25%, or you could work 6 hours, or 33%.\nYou have the choice of 1/4 of a day of work, 25% work, or 33% work in the remainder, so this could be Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, allowing you to do 6 hours of continuous work on any one of these days.\nSo the final day which allows you to do 6 continuous hours of work is:\n(100-76+2)/10 =<<100-72+2/10=3>>3\nSo the final answer day is Friday.\n\nInput: There were 10 days in November.

Can you describe the problem in context?\n\nComment: Hello @jww, so basically they're supposed to answer certain multiple choice problems and the output of the code will give the users the right answer. Also, I'm trying to give the user a feedback when they don't answer the correct question. I'm trying to get the program to tell the user that they're wrong if they're writing 21 instead of 20 or something like that.\n\nComment: Are you trying to help the user guess the answer?  It sounds like you're trying to help the user by telling them when they make a mistake, except all of the questions are incorrect?\n\nComment: No, the questions are not incorrect, the solutions given by the program to the questions are incorrect. They're supposed to check their answers with what the system gives to them. If the system is off by any means, the user should know that their answer is incorrect.\n\nAnswer: You should write a new 'while' loop to check whether the user input is within the 30-60 range.\nThis way your program will check if the user input is within expected range instead of asking an input again. Your program will break from the while loop since the if statement inside the while loop won't be checked anymore since the user input is within range.\n\nComment: Yes, that is what I'm trying to do. Break the loop once the user input is within a certain range. How do I go about doing that? And how do I check to see if it's within that range?\n\nComment: Okay, so once I put an if loop inside the while loop where the loop checks if a user input of 30-68 is within range, the other questions are showing wrong answers. How does the input have to be to make it work?\n\nComment: Use the 'input' command to ask user the input within a certain range. The 'input' command also will give you user input within 30-69, which you can check using a 'if' statement.\n\n\nComment: Oh okay, so the problem with", "answer": "C: happiness"}

He also needed 3 pairs of boots. If he also had $40 to spend, how much did he get to spend on a new belt?\nOutput: First you need to know that the price of each jeans is.90 and the price of each boot is 3.40. Sawyer needs 2 pairs of jean and 3 pairs of boo. Therefore the number of jeans that he need is 2*(1/3*$.40)-(2/3*$.4*) = 2*(1/9)*$.40-.60 = 2*.03-.10 = $.09-.01 = 0.2\nThe rest of his 40$ will be used to buy 2 pairs of shoes. Therefore the number of shoes that he can buy is 2*(40/10)-(2/10)=2*(20/10)-1 = 40*.10-1 = 5$.\nThus, he will have 2*.09+5 = 1.4 + 5 = 6.4$.\nSo the final answer should be 6.4 $. \n\nInput: If I have 50 cents times 9, what is my answer in dollars?\nOutput:$50 cents times by 9 = $.50 x 9 = $/.50 x 9=4.5\nThus the final answer is 9\n\nInput: Which one of the following numbers is divisible by seven, in addition to being divisible by three and divisible by four?\nOutput: For every number in the list, all we do next is to multiply it by 9/7, which simplifies to 1/7, and then check to see if that number ends in a remainder of 3 or if it doesn't.\nIn the example we consider, 92 ends in a remainder of two, so 92/7 = 13, which leaves us with an answer of 13\nSo the final answer would be 13\n\n\nInput: One of the students in the class can write one page in", "answer": "D: contaminated"}

These costs do not include parking fees, so we are adding $15 dollars for parking each time for a total of $15 * 11 = <<15*11=165>> 165 dollars in total.\nSo the total cost of spending all days using $15/day for parking is $1412 + 165 = <<1412+165=1577>>$1577.\nSo the final price to park that many times is $15777.", "answer": "D: wall"}

How much should I put into the cookie batter?\nOutput: Since there are 8 in 3/8, there are 3/32 of a cup of butter in 3/8 of a cup. Three-thirty-second cups is 8 one-sixths cups. Since there are sixteen one-sixth cups in a cup, there are 112 one-sixth cuples in a butter measurement.\nOne-sixth cuples is equivalent to 16 sixteenths. 16 sixteenth cuples = 48 sixteenth cuples\nSo to measure 48 sixteenths of a cup of butte: use a butter measuring cup, split the butter into sixteenths and then divide each sixteenth by 7 (there are 7 sixteenths in a cup) = <<39>>39 sixteenth-sixteenth pieces.\nPut the sixteenth-sixteenths of butter pieces into a butter measuring container until they fill 100% of the container.\nSo the final recipe calls for 48 sixteenth-sixteenth piece.\nSince this is not a whole number, divide this by.5 = <<48/0.5=96>>95 more pieces.\nAdd 48 whole pieces and 95 parts to get 887 piecs of butter.\nTo answer the original question, we divided 887 whole pieces by 800 whole pieces to get 1.125.

If the train leaves 12 minutes after the plane, and travels toward the plane, and the plan leaves as soon as the train passes, will the train just miss the plane?\nOutput: If the train leaves 2 minutes later than the plane, the answer is yes.\nThe last sentence implies that the train is leaving earlier than the plane.\nSo, there will be 12 - 8 = <<12-8=4>> minutes left.  The plane leaves as soon as the plane passes the train.\nLet x be the distance that the plane is from the train at the moment of the passing.\nThen, at the moment that the train stops next to the plane, 4 = <<4=1000>>1000\nThus, x = 1000-4 = <<1000-16=800>>800.\nSo, the train passes the plane with 800 distance, and the plane is traveling at (800)/600 = <<800/600=1>> 1, so the train's distance from the plane is 800+1 = <<800+1=3>>5 miles.\nThen, the distance between the train's front and the plane's front is 3, and the plane leaves as soon as it passes the train, and the train's front is approaching the plane's front with a fast speed of 700 miles per hour.\nTherefore, there is 2/700 miles (minute) between the train's and plane's front.\nTherefore, if the train goes by the plane miss it.\nSo the final", "answer": "C: brother's house"}

If the amount of time required to to travel the third from the first point is 4/9 that required to travel from one to three, how much time does it take to travel from the first to the second points?\nOutput: To travel from one to the third points requires 2/5 of 4/9 = <<2/5=2/9>>2/9 because it requires 2/5 * 4/9 as it does 4/9 * 2/5 (the latter of which is the same as 4/9 * (2/5). 4/9 * ((2/5)) is equal to 1/3. 1/3 is the the same as 1/6 because we multiply the numerator and denominator by 6. 1/6 is the same as 1/(6*6). There is also 6*6=36 which we subtract by 36 so we subtract 1/6-1/6 = <<1/6-1/(6*6)-1/(6*6) = 1/(36*6)-1//(36*6)>>1/36. 4/9 or 1/3 of those numbers.\nSo time to travel from the first place to the second place is (1/3)(4/9) = <<1/3*(4/9)-1//(3*9)-1//(9*9)-1//1>>1/(3*9)-1/(9*9)-1/(1)-1/(9*3)*(9/3)=1/(36*9)-1/((6*3)*1)/9 = 1/7*.0099999=.0000999=<<1/7/.0099977=.00000097>>9.479\nTo travel from one to three requires 4/9 times 2/9 so the time from one to three is 4/9*2/9=<<4/9*2=2/9>>9.\nIt also takes 4", "answer": "E: row boat"}

A brain injury is a physical problem and doesn't change their potential, which in this example might indicate he is able to work, even in a job where physical ability is required, but is unable to work in the job now because of the brain injury.  So he isn't treated as if he's fully capable, but because of the injury to the brain area that handles speech, that is not how people see him.  He is being seen as less capable, or not to the full of what he could be, even though he has the same potential competence to any other employee, he's just not able to realize it fully, even with speech therapy.\nSo the final choice is d.\n\nInput:A 3-step process produces 25 liters of water from 10 liters of water. If every step is done independently, and if 4 of the steps require 3 liters of water each, and if 3 steps require 1 liter of water each, then how many steps are done?\nOutput:If 3 steps require 3 litres of water then 8 steps are made\nIf there are independent steps then a 3-step process makes 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 steps.\nEach step uses 10 litres of water so the process uses 10*3=<<10*3=30>>32 total litres of water.\n30/25 = <<30/18=1.67>>1.67 steps\n\n1.67 or 13/8 or 4/3?\nIf there is one 1 litre step, one of the 4*3 litres, and 24/22 = <<24/22=1.14>>1.14 steps remaining, we would have 4/3 steps.  But now we have 24 steps, so we can have 13/8. or 1(1) = <<1(1)=1>>1 steps.\nIf there is 24 1 litre steps then we have 8(1) = <<8(1)=0>>0 steps.

E: We always pronounce a consonant as it\u2019s written. F: A vowel is always written on one line.\nOutput: Choice D is correct, because the definition of a vowel does not include saying that the consonant that precedes it must always be a specific consonant (e.g., a voiced sibilant [s]). It is also false that a consonant has to be followed by a vowel; it can be followed by another letter if it\u2019s a liquid consonant ([r], [l], or [w]), which also cannot have only one other consonant next to them because they do have other letters (e.g., rr for liquid r and ll for liquid l).

B: A consonants are always followed by vowels. If the definition were that consonants could only be followed by vowels, that would make them less vowel-like as a symbol because vowels are often followed by a consonant (e..g., pw). So vowel-like is not the same as vowel-followed. C: A vowels is never more than one c. If a vowels are never more than one syillable, that means we can only have the one vowel listed as one syllable.

They could not have more than 56 toothpicks on the sides of the pyramid and they could not have a spaghetti \"dome\" that had more than 48 spaghetti \"balls\" on it. If each ball is 1/4\" then each side of the dome's height (in inches) is 30,48 or 56 (see next paragraph for more detail).

What could he buy?\nOutput:Jim had 10 dollars and three choices CD, DVD, or toy.  The cost for each DVD is 5 dollars, the cost for each toy is 10 dollars, and the cost for each CD is 2 dollars.  The total cost for 3 DVDs is 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>10.  The total cost of 3 toys is 3 * 10 = <<3*10=30>>10.  But, the 3 toys cost 10 dollars more than 3 DVDs.  Thus, Jim had 10 * 3 + 10 = <<10*3+10=40>>4 dollars left.The total cost of 2 CDs is 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4.The total of all costs is 40 + 4 = <<40+4=44>>4.So Jim's sister could choose to buy a TV.\nSo the final  answer is Toy as it has the lowest price, and the highest price with 4 dollars out of 10 left.\n\nInput:Brad took 5 days to finish a project, which was 3 times longer than it took to do.

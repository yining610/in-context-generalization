{"text": "Recalcatious\n\n### Instructions: Read the following passage and answer the question that follows.\n\nFor over a thousand years, the church's relationship with art has been a complex one. As a building, the church is a repository of the world's greatest works of art. In the form of sculpture or painting, many of the best works of art ever done have been built as, or placed in, churches.\n\n### A) The art was placed in the churches for beauty.\n### B) The relationship between the church and art goes back at least a thousand years.\n### C) Great works of art that are considered to be \"high art\" are built as, or placed into, churches.\n\nAs a repository of art objects and buildings, the church represents a very large part of the world's cultural heritage. These objects represent religious beliefs and, even more important, a link to the past, connecting people with their ancestors. This was not the original intent of the builders, but the presence of such objects in the church created a tradition for religious people and their art.\n\nThe church also houses the church's property, which can become the subject of worship on its own. This aspect of the church's art is one that art dealers, curators, and museum people call \"high art.\" It is important to understand that the church itself has only recently begun to treat such art as a part of its artistic program.\n\nThe relationship between the church and the arts has not been one of goodwill and trust all the time. Many of the most famous works of art, from Michelangelo's ceiling of the Sistine Chapel to Giotto's paintings in the chapel of Assisi, have been commissioned by the church with special instructions. These instructions may have been to show the nature of the church, to present a new view of Christ, or to simply show the church's wealth. These commissions can lead to serious confrontations between church and client. Even when there is no conflict, many of the greatest religious works of art were created by artists who belonged to another sect or religion altogether. In the case of the work of Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475-1564), he was a devout Catholic who wanted to use his talents to help his faith. He was one of the few painters", "answer": "B: heretical"}

This is because open meadow can have the perfect set up. There are grass, herbs, etc that are there for the prey, but they don't run away when they see the fox (because the predator is usually a great fox.)

You can find samples of a bony fish in:  A.A stream. B.A lake. C.A river. D.A bay. E.A mudflat. \n\n### Response and Justification:A stream\n\n### Input for Demonstration on Input:\nA bony fish is common in lakes, rivers and mudflats. This fish is a little bit special compared to others since they have the biggest brains in relation to its body. Even though people prefer to eat salmon, some people may want a bony fish. This fish is also common in aquariums. They like to eat a variety of seafood and they are easy to maintain. The reason why some people do not like them is their teeth, which have to be removed to make the food taste better. Another issue this kind of fish is facing is its decline in population. Most people have forgotten how this kind of fish tastes good.

{"text": "The best answer is:A\n\nAnswer: The microphone boom is used to pick up sound, so it would make sense if it were located in a place full of lots of noise such as a stock market event, or concert. In contrast, a microphone boom would not be used in a television studio because only one person, the host, would be speaking; the microphone itself would be adequate for picking up the host's speech. A concert would be another place to put a microphone boom because when 100 or more people are singing together, the boom would have a job to pick up all the sounds, just as it would in the sound booth. Finally, in a recording studio, one person at a time is allowed to speak and is miked, so there is usually no need for a microphone boom. \n\nAnswer: The best answer is:A \n#recursion\n### Instruction Use recursion to solve the following.\n\n### Input For n = 3, there are 2 ways to arrange the numbers in a pyramid scheme. For n = 4, there are 3 ways to arrange the number in a pyramid. For n = 5, there are 4 ways to arrange the three digits in a pyramid, and so on. How many ways are there to arrange n different digits in a pyramidal arrangement? Rationales: The function to arrange n different numbers in a pyramidal shape uses recursion. This can be explained by going back to its mathematical definition. For example, let\u2019s start with n=3. There are two ways to place three numbers, 1, 2, and 3, in a pyramidal scheme. The first method places 1 on top then 3 with 2 in the middle and bottom. It can be explained with the code (1, 2, 3) (3,2, 1) The second method places 2 on top then 3 and 1 with 2 in the center. It can be explained as (2, 1 )(1,2,3)(3, 1, 2) Next, for n=4, there are three ways to arrange the four numbers. One is 1 on top and 2-3-4 below it in a triangle.

There are various old peoples homes in the area but they go by other names, such as [this facility](http://www.montgomerycountypa.gov/AgingAndAdultService/assistedliving.aspx) which lists this as an assisted living facility. \n\n#### C.

Choices: A; residential neighborhood B: suburbs C: market D: suburbs E: community\n\nA gas station should be located in a residential neighborhood as it's a building used to dispense fuel for transport. For a gas station to be constructed in a residential neighborhood, the area should have a huge space. It means that a residential neighborhood is a place filled with houses and big space around them. It gives more sense for a gas station to be found in a residential neighborhood. In contrast, a gas station should not be in a mosque because it's a place of worship of Muslims who will have difficulty finding fuel.\n\nA mosque should be located in the center and this can only be possible in a community because it gives a place for prayer. \n\nA hospital should be located in residential neighborhood too because people live there and the space is huge for a school building. A hospital is a place where people are treated for illness. Therefore, it is a place where ill people can be taken care of since hospitals are very big and have space.\n\nTherefore, a gas station should be located where people live.

First find the value of Pete\u2019s table, which is the sale price of the table ($180). \nThe two chairs were on sale. First, find the original price of the chairs, then subtract the sale price from the original price and multiply that amount by 2, which equals the savings that Pete made on the chairs. \nOriginal Price of Chairs = $65 \nSale Price of Chairs = -$30 \nSavings per Chair = $65 - $30 = -$35 \nSavings on Chairs = -$110 \nThen, determine the total price of the new table and two chairs by subtracting the original price of the table from the total price of the entire purchase. \nNew Table and Two Chairs: $285 - $180 = $105 \nPrice of Two Chairs with Savings: $65 - $110 = -$45 \nTotal Price of Table plus two Chairs: $45 + $105 = $150\n\n### Demostration:\n(C) The answer is the drawer because it is possible to multiply 12 by 3 and then add a negative number to get the total value of a set. \n(D) The answer is the desk because it is possible to divide 20 by 2 and round down to get the total value required of a group of two people. \n(E) This question is not related to multiplication and division, so it cannot be used to determine the value of the items on the table. \n(F) This question is not about multiplication and division so it is not about determining value.\nAnswer:C \n\n### Instructions:Answer the following question.\n\n## Demonstration:The answer is multiple ruler because it is possible to multiple 2 by one", "answer": "C: office"}

{"text": "D\n\n### Instructions: \nRead the passage carefully, then answer the question.\n\nA husband and wife were talking over problems between their families at the start of an evening class in the community hall. It appeared that they were both trying hard to help their children with their homework. \nTheir class teacher began to talk about the problem of how to help children who have a hard time learning at school get better grades and how to encourage them to do better at school in the future. She suggested that the parents of children who have learning difficulties should read to their children instead of expecting their children to sit and do some work on their own. \n\nThe husband nodded and said, If our children did not study, they would fail their exams. The wife agreed. She said that they should give their children the best possible education and help them in every way they could as their future depended on it. \nAt the end of the class, she added that it would take years for her husband to realize how hard his wife was working, and it would be too late to do anything then.\nAfter the class, she was talking to her husband in a corner of the classroom. She asked him if he understood what she had said to him earlier. He said, \"Yes, but I still want us to keep helping our children at school as they need it.\" She smiled at her husband and said, \"I did not mean that we should stop helping them study and I did not mean that I felt angry, but we should not feel that we are harder than our husbands.\"\nA: If our children did not... they would fail their examination. \nB: Then, we should not feel that our children are harder...\nAnswer: D\n\n### Input :  \n\"Suggest a few things we can do to help our children do better at school.\" Choices:  A.

After their final run, player A wins by a distance of 30 meters, player B wins by a distance of one meter more than player C wins, and player C wins by the smallest amount, which is only a distance of 2 inches. How far does each player run?\n\n### Rationales: Each player runs 30 miles. Then 31 miles. Then 32 miles. Then 33 miles.\nThe first two players do not win by the same exact distance, but within a certain span.\nBoth players will increase their distance by one mile, so A will run 33 miles, C will run 32 miles, and B will run 31 miles as the third mile of their run.\nEach player runs the same distance again, and then crosses a field that is equal to the total distance they have traveled. A can win by a distance of 29 miles. B can win by a distance closer to 30 miles.\nTherefor, C's mileage is 30 miles, Bs mileage is close to 30 miles, and A's mileage is close 29 miles.\nThis means they all run 30(the first run) + (1(second run)) = 31miles. Then they each have to run the same distance again (31 x 3 = 93) and then run 93 as the third distance, across the field. Then they have finished. Thus, they all ran 93 miles. \n\nA wins if they had 29 miles to cross the field, and they won by 30 more miles than B.\nA = 29(first run) + (30(second run)) +(93(third run)) + (field)=3032+ 93\n\nB wins if they had 30 miles to cross the field and they win by only", "answer": "D: louisiana"}

Choices:  (A) Clean often (B) Clean as needed (C) Clean when you see your pets (D) Clean before company arrives (E) Clean while cooking\n\n### Response\n\n(A) Clean often\n\n### Exploration:\n\nI have four dogs and they shed a lot. I am the type of person who likes to clean all the time, as I like my place clean and neat.\n\n### Exemplar:\n\nThere is no answer to the instruction that is incorrect.\n\n### Rationale: A\n\nClean often is the appropriate answer. Clean as needed says to clean according to your needs, which doesn't answer the question of how often should you clean your home. While I do like a clean house and clean up as I go with pets, that is a long-term answer that doesn't answer if I should clean every day.\n\nSimilarly, clean before company arrives and clean while cooking are irrelevant and not answers.\n\n(B) Clean as Needed\n\nThis answer makes sense for this instruction. It tells the reader to clean when you notice there is something that needs to be cleaned so it doesn't become dirty. Also, no one is coming over to inspect your house for cleanliness, so if they see it, it is too late then.\n\n### Incorrect\n\nClean as needed is not a good answer. This tells the reader that I should wait until my house becomes dirty and then I should clean it. This may not always be the best thing as I may not always have time to clean the dirt, which means I will need to take breaks as I scrub and will be spending a long time cleaning.

A year later, his sister wins a competition and receives $10. Last year, John's sister received $20. The difference between the two years is $8. How much did John receive for his first place at the Olympic?\n\n### Rationale:\nIn order to figure out how John earned his money, you first have to figure out what his sister earned. She earned $10 last year, $20 the year before that, and she currently earns $10. \n\nThe average of this is to take the sum of total money earned and divide by 3. \n\nTotal money earned = $25 + $20 + $10 = $55\n\nTo find the average of the total money earned, divide $55 by 3.  $55 / 3 = $18.33 \n\nThis isn't a perfect answer, but it's close enough to figure out the rest of the problem.\n\nTo figure out the money John earned, you have to subtract the average of his sister's money from the difference in money between his sister's second and third year. \n\nJohn receives: $25 + $18.32 - (18.33) - $8 = $59.32\n\n### Instructions: \nInput: Your neighbor is selling her old car.

If $0.2 was substract from a total of $1.1, the answer should be $1, but if $0.2 is substract from a total and the answer is $0.9, the correct answer would be 'none'\n## Answer: $0.9\n## Input:A total of $5 is given to three children. 5 children got 11 cents. 2 more children get ten cents. 3 children get none. How much are five children left with?\n## demo: If $5 was substract from a group of 5 children, no one would have money. If each child got $11 cents, then $5 was taken from each of the $11 cents to be given the 5 children. 2 more children would get 10 cents because there are five children, so $5 was left over, so they got 10 cents each. 3 children got none, so $5 - 2 x 10 cents - 3 children = $2.50, so they would have $2.50.\n## Answer: $2.50", "answer": "C: red barn"}

If each student in the class paid 25 cents for a pizza lunch, what was the sum of the money collected? \n\n### Rationales: The section of the class had an even number of students, so $25 cents was paid by each student in the class that ordered a pizza.\nTherefore, $25 cents * number of students in section of class = total money collected.\nThe students in that section were from different classes, so their section is not relevant to the question asked. \nThe relevant sections are classes, not the section of the class that ordered the pizza.\nThe question specified that each student in the class ordered a pizza lunch. \nTherefore, students from classes other than the class that bought the pizza lunch probably did not buy a pizza lunch and we do not know if the total number of pizzas ordered was evenly divisible.\nThe question was asking about the total money collected. \n\nFinally: $25*(number of students)*((number of classes/2 classes)*$25*(number of classes/2classes)) = $3,750\n\nAnswer: $3,75\n\n### Input 1:Write a response that appropriately fills in the blank. The blank is: A pizzeria charges $2.10 for a cheese pizza with up to 15 pepperoni slices and $3.40 for a pepperoni pizza with up to three slices.\n\n### Rationale: The cheese pizza has up to five slices so the cheese pizza is $2.10, plus the value of one extra slice ($0.20), with a maximum of 15 ($15.00). However, the maximum value of the extra slices is 12 so the total cost is $2.12 + $0.20*12 = $4.22.\n\n### Example 2\n\n### Writing a response that appropriately finishes the sentence:\n\n> If the number of students in a section is 2", "answer": "B: louisiana"}

{"text": "I will complete the instruction by using the instruction to identify the response that best answers the question. Here are the steps I used to answer the question:\n1. The question asked was about a  feeling toward. I have learned the definition of a feeling. A feeling is a sensation made by a person's body that is either good or bad. If I think of a person I am angry with, I am angry because I have a feeling of anger toward that person. \n2. The question stated that someone who \"doesn't care about about [or care about] and wishes them to fail\" has what feeling. \"Wishes\" can be substituted with \"hopes\" or \"wants\" so for now I will use the substitution and write it as \"A person who does not care [or who cares not] and who hopes the other person will fail\" has what? To find out what the person has we need to think about the different types of feelings. \"Wise\" is an adjective word for  \"Wise\" is the only one out of the choices it is not an adjective to a group of people, so they must be the feeling. So the question is asking about a feeling toward someone who wishes they fail. So what feeling could someone have toward someone who wishes they will fail? The feeling must be a bad feeling. Out of the choices, the only bad feeling listed is \"antipathy\". Therefore, antipathy is the correct response to answer the question.", "answer": "C: antipathy"}

{"text": "You should start by recognizing and defining unknown terms. We know the verb \"to be\" and we know that we are talking about a building on a vacation/relaxation holiday. We also know that the building is either small or large. The two extremes are \"small\" and \"large.\"\n\nThe statement also defines that the cabin was not \"available\" anymore. This means that they couldnt use it any more as they had previously planned.\n\nThe verb \"to be\" also implies that the phrase \"were upgraded to\" means they had to somehow choose a different place.\n\n### Next, you can identify and interpret the meaning of the key words. Key words are words that have very specific meanings in specific language forms.\nWe know they are talking about a building because of \"were upgraded\" and \"the cabin\" which indicates a space and a thing that is located somewhere.\n\nThe location is not indicated but we assume the vacation/relaxation place where they were previously staying.\n\nWe also know that \"the cabin\" is not available to them because that is the very next set of words.\n\nWe do not know why \"the cabin\" cannot be used anymore.\n\nThis information indicates that there is no specific choice for \"the cabin\" in this scenario so we have to consider what other options are available.\n\n### Finally, we look at the words and phrases to identify the structure of the sentence. We are looking for conjunctions that can help us identify the different parts of the sentence.\n\nWe can identify the different parts of this sentence by looking at any words and phrases that are joined by a punctuation mark such as a comma or a coordinating conjunction.\n\nThere are 2 sets of punctuation marks in the sentence.\n\nThis is one set: \"and the cabin\"\n\nThis is the other set: \"or spacecraft, or hall, or palace, or hotel.\"\n\nNow we can read the sentence to get a sense of what it is saying:\n\n\"There was not a small cabin when they planned for their vacation/relaxation trip\" this means it wasn't large enough so they had to decide. Maybe they took another trip somewhere else and had to stay somewhere else.\n\n\"However, they were upgraded to something like a villa, or spacecraft, or hall or palace or hotels.\" This", "answer": "A: villa"}

This pyramid was built mainly with stone blocks, and if put in a modern day\u2019s context it would almost be impossible and way to costly. To make this pyramid even more interesting is the very high level of technological know-how at that age.

{"text": "In my opinion, I think the response should be \"Card Shark.\"\n\n### Here's how we reached that conclusion: \n\nAfter thinking about the question we understood that it was more about what the players were playing and not about how they felt. Based on how much emotion the players felt we were able to eliminate possible choices that describe how they were feeling. \n\nFirst we ruled out that they were playing in \"Shallow Waters.\" Playing in shallow water can result in harm to an animal and players are required to be careful since water can move unexpectedly. Also there is an animal that lives in the \"Shallow Waters\", that can potentially harm people. Since there are so many aspects that suggest that players are careful when playing in shallow water it is likely they are not playing in shallow water. To eliminate choice A as our answer we ruled out the possibility that they were playing in Sea World. We were also able to rule out choice B as an answer choice because there was no evidence that players would be playing in a court room.\n\nNext, we ruled out the possibility of playing in \"Court Room\" when players were emotionless in choice C. This ruled out the option of playing the \"Poker game\" since they were not being emotional. Since there was no evidence that the players were enjoying the other options and this was likely unlikely we chose the option with the \"Card Shark\" in the blank which is choice D. \n\n### Further explanation: \n\nThis answer choice was picked because it is the least unlikely out of the choices given. This is because one of the cards in this game is that of an icy shark which lives in a tank in the background zoo. There are also other cards that involve the \"shark.\" This shows that the game is most likely a \"Card Shark Game\" because the least likely answer choices were picked out first and this was the last game picked to explain what the players were playing. This last game also stands out more than the other choices because there is more evidence supporting the claim that the answer is in this choice and less on the other choices.", "answer": "D: poker game"}

We are given 9,725, one of the three digits is missing in this number. What operation should you perform to replace that missing digit in order to obtain your answer?\n\n\n### Rationale : \n\nThe number '9,725' contains 3 digits. \n\nTherefore, we can form 3 digits using the 9,72, 97, 72 and 7. \n\nIn the number '9,7', we can replace the missing digit as '7'.\n\n### Answer\nSolution\n\n### Input\n\nWe have 3 apples, 2 bananas, 4 oranges, 8 pineapples, and 6 strawberries; which fruit has the most calories?\n\n### Solution\n\nWe need to find out which fruit has the most amount of calories. \n\nThe answer is the fruit with the highest number of calories. 3 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 6 = 25. 25 is the fewest amount of calories we will get.

Any of the other choice can be completed by anyone regardless of whether they are deaf or not. Therefore, the only option that cannot be done by someone who is deaf is to express an action through smiling, because they will be required to express the action with muscles in their face and mouth.\n\nThere are many variations to answer this question.

Ostrich\n\n### Response\nOption A: Lion\n\n### Rationale:\nThe lion has the attributes of a mammal, as well as a reptile. The term reptile is broader than mammal, and contains many animals that can be considered reptiles, as well as several mammals. I have also listed some of the criteria that animals must attain in order to be considered reptiles.\n\n1.  Reptiles must have scales on their skin to protect it from friction caused during movement.\n2. Reptiles lay eggs.\n3. Their babies are live births.\n\nThe lion has all of the listed criteria. Therefore the chimpanzee would not be a reptile. \n\nIf a dog were to be considered a reptile, it would require a major restructuring of the animal kingdom. \n\nIf the snake were to be considered a mammal, it would also require a major restructure, as the skull and braincase of a reptile is vastly different from that of a mammal. I have found no reptiles that would qualify to be in the same genus as a true mammal.\n\nIf a dog, snake, or mammal were to be considered a bird, it would require them to acquire feathers.

This indicates that the environment is calm because a farm is located in a peaceful environment. This is opposite of the luxurious city.\n2. B: This was my first response. I thought John did not have money thus the environment he lived in was a difficult or even challenging environment. Since he doesn't have money, this would not be a luxurious city.

Choices: A: 50% B: 100% C: 40.8% D: 60% E: 25%\n\n### Response :The question is asking if from a uniform distribution you are able to get all the answers correct. To do this you must divide your probability that you get the correct answer by the probability that the answer is incorrect and the probability that you correctly guess all 10 questions. To do that you must divide 50% which is the probability of getting all questions correct by the probability that you'll be 100% correct which is the probability of your probability of choosing the correct outcome when a uniform distribution is used = 100%. As the question stated 50% the probability that the distribution of the answer questions come from this uniform distribution should be 100%. But they also stated that it comes from a uniform distribution. A uniform distribution means that there is a probability that the outcome can be any possibility which in this instance would mean there is a probability that you could be 60% correct which is greater than 50%. Thus the probability would be 60% and not 50%.\nAnswer : 60%\n\n### Input : If each of these four teams is chosen randomly, does the probability change?

The man offered $30 to wash all five vehicles. The car washed by itself at $12 and the truck washed by itself at a cost of $11. The van would cost the man $18 if it had been parked at the self-wash location. The van also could be washed at the same location as the car and truck. The man has been offered a deal to wash all the vehicles at the same location. How much did the car, truck, or van cost to wash in the deal?\nRationales(C) When the man pays to park the car at the spot by itself. That car is $12, so 0 + $12 = $12. The man also pays to park the truck at the spot by itself, so the truck cost the man $11. The man pays to park the van in a separate place and not with the car at the same spot as the car by itself.

Science is based on logic and evidence whereas faith is based on one's belief. Science cannot be based on faith alone because science deals with evidence and proof. If only science dealt with faith it wouldn't be science anymore. Science is based on a lot of evidence and when faith comes into play it gets more complicated. Faith goes through a lot of doubts whereas science is very certain. Science is the only truth which cannot be doubted while faith is only a set of beliefs. For science to be based on faith it needs to not be science anymore. Science will require all your faith in it in order for it to work.

{"text": "E\n\n### Answer:E\n\n## Rationale:\nA) Love could be contagious - you can catch it, like the flu - but it is not. We are all able to chose who we love. We're able to know them and love them, and if your heart isn't in the right place, or they're just not the person for you, you could never catch them. For example, you could never catch your best guy friend.\n\nB) Wrong? Love cannot happen if no one is in love. Is love unnatural? I think not.\n\nC) Love cannot last forever - It's not practical. We will come and go, as we change jobs, homes, and more. Our hearts never stop, but eventually they will find love again. The same way you could never hold onto your very first puppy, to keep it as your pet for your entire life, you can't keep your first love for life. Love is always changing. (and I'm pretty sure animals don't 'last forever' either, unless you can't get a decent dog from an animal shelter anywhere in America - I'm not talking about the dogs you see when you first visit or take your parents to, because they likely won't be your forever dog. I mean, my brother had 2 dogs in his life, until they went to dog prisons when he couldn't afford to pay anymore).\n\nD) Painful? We don't see love that may bring pain, if the individual doesn't care. The person must understand the pain could be caused by their love or choice. Love must be there, to do any harm.\n\nE) Blind? Love is blind, right? We make poor decisions for love, we don't always have our eyes wide open. We don't have all the facts, we don't understand every decision the other person makes, or has made in their life so far. We love so strongly, that the heart can sometimes make up its own facts, and go forward, and make up for others faults.\n\n### Input and answer the following two- part question by selecting the letters.\n\nWhich letter represents the answer that goes with each choice?\n\n1.

If your family recycled 75 gallons of cans and 116 pounds of dirty newspapers, how much did you make?\n\n### Demostration:\nIf the number of gallons (75) is divided by 1 gallon, 75 gallons is equal to 75 gallons. If the number of pounds (116 of dirty newspapers is divided by 5, it equals 23.2 gallons of recycling cans. Finally, the number of dirty gallons (23.2) plus the non dirty gallons of recycled cans(5) equals the final answer: 28.2 gallons. \nLet\u2019s find out the values. For every 1 gallons you recycle, you earn $0.50 (which means if you recycle 75 gallons, if you multiply, you\u2019ll get $37.5). For every 5 pounds of news papers you recycle, earn between $3.0 and $5. (for instance, if the news papers are dirty it will cost $5.0, if they\u2019re clean they\u2019ll cost$3.0).

{"text": "A: order\n\n### Rationale:The problem describes a line where the line is not moving. The adjective \"fatigue\" means tiredness. The adjective \"wait turn\" means to endure something difficult. The adjective \"anger\" means resentful or bad feeling. The noun \"queueing up\" and the noun \"queue\" mean a line waiting to enter a store or place of business; \"to queue up\" means to line up as in \"to queue up for dinner.\" The answer is \"A\" (order). Explanation: The line is not moving which means that there is a line but it is not moving. This happens because of congestion. Therefore, the adjective \"order\" would make more sense here because it implies that the line is disorderly. Another valid response would be \"B\" (queueing up) because \"to queue up\" has the same meaning as \"to line up\" (as people in a queue typically do).\n\n### Input:\"There was a long line of cars waiting to get gas.\"\n\n### Input2: \"After spending 45 minutes in the hospital waiting room, I decided to queue up.\"\n\n### Rationales:In the first sentence, the problem describes a long line of cars, which is also known as a queue. \nThe noun \"queue\" means a line waiting to enter. To queue means to line up. In the second sentence, the problem describes something called \"to queue up.\" To queue up means to line up. Explanation: \"There was a long line...\" - In this sentence, the noun \"line\" means a line of people or things that stretch lengthwise along or along part of a surface. \"To queue up\" - In this sentence, \"to queue up\" is the answer. To queue is a verb form of \"to queue up.\"\n\n\n### Input3:If there are 16 cars in a line, how many should be in a queue?\n\n### Input4:How many items should be in a queue if there are 12 people in a line?\n\n### Response:\"A queue should always be longer than the line.\"\n\n### Response2:\"A queue should always contain 12 or fewer items.\"\n\n\n## Task 5:\nRewrite the following sentence so that it is complete using a relative pron", "answer": "E: anger"}

In such a model, when it is time for a person to die (and thus make the next transition state), his or her age at the time of death is a random variable that has no upper bound. We then consider events that involve a person living from some age \\(t\\) up until some age \\(T_i^0\\). The probability mass that this event takes on is \\(p_{t}(T_i^0)\\). The following equation models a person's probability of survival from a given age \\(t\\).\n\n\\(p_{t}(\\tau ) = \\left(1-p_{t}(A_{n} ))\\right)^{T_{n}^{0}}\\)\n\nwhere \\(A_n\\) is the state where the person dies at age \\(n\\).

{"text": "A\n\n### Explanation:\n\n### Rationales:\nThere are four places in which humans breath air and then pass it on. They are: the surface of the earth, the house, the charming place, and the space shuttle. This is because a house is made up of many rooms, each room is occupied. When a person enters a room and leaves, the air in that room is replaced. This is also the case with a household, and when everyone is home at once, there are many people occupying the rooms all at once, and this makes for many people breathing and passing on the air.\n\nThis is the reason why one person can inhale a large quantity of air from another person, for example at a house. Likewise for the surface, where many people occupy the space and also breathe, and exchange the air. Lastly, the charming place in the same way. But not only houses, but also the places where people congregate often is where we find the same thing happening. For example, many people stand and/or sit on the train, and each time the entrance is opened and people enter the compartment, the air is replaced with new air. This is the result because of the large number of people, so that the air inside the train is replaced each time the door is opened, and it is possible that the air is changed a thousand times.\n\n### Input\nGive five reasons why people can't live on Mars forever.<BR>\n\n### Response\n<BR>\n\nRationales:\n\nPeople really can't live forever on Mars because:<BR>\n</div>\n     <div style=\"background-color: lightyellow\">\n    1.

I say this based on the following: the capital city of the state of Illinois is \nChicago. Chicago is nicknamed Chicago, the Windy City, and the Second City. It is also called the City of Big Shoulders and the City That Works.\nThe pizza restaurant is in the city of Chicago and not in the Illinois countryside or suburbs.\nAlso, a street of Little Italy in Chicago can be found in the city.\n\n### Input 2:What is the maximum value of n when 78 + 27n = n2 - 4?\n\n### Response 2:n is the maximum value of 5\n\n### Comments:In the given equation 78 is in the numerator and -4 in the denominator. Now, we need to distribute -4 to the numerator. \n\nThe easiest way to do that is by adding 36 to 78 as follows:\n\n78 + 29 = 107 \n\n\n107 - 4 is equivalent to 103, which has no square root.

They can also get the ball out of the garbage, so I would say that the kitchen is the best environment for throwing the ball.\n\n# B: child's hands\nRationales: \n\n  I know that B is the child's hands because there is a lot of dirt and germs on a child's hands. \n\nA ball touching the child's hand will have a lot of germs on it. \n\nIt is not good if a ball gets thrown on the floor, because in a day, there will be plenty of dirt and germ on the floor. If a ball hits the floor, it will get dirty fast. Plus, throwing on the floor is not good for exercise. I can also not say A is the best place, because the refrigerator has germs on it too, and the refrigerator is not good for exercise either. \n\nTherefore, I say that B is the best place for throwing a ball.\n\n# C: street\nRationales: C is the street. When we throw a ball on the street, the ball can bounce a lot because the street is flat. This is better than throwing a ball in the park. The ball will not bounce when we throw it in the park. Also, I can play with my friends better on the street, unlike the park. \n\nI will know that D is not a good place to throw a ball, because a ball is a toy.

So from 98 you are supposed to give some numbers and that makes it an equation. Adding the clothing, we get 3 + 6 + 2 + 2. Therefore 11 + 8 + 39 = 58.

{"text": "Discovery of new\n\n## What is a recursive function\n\nThe definition and uses of a recursive function. Recursion is the procedure of defining a function in terms of itself. For example the factorial function can be defined, like any function, by choosing an object and a procedure for determining the value of the object given the value of the object, this latter object, and the operation chosen to determine the value of the object from the value of an object and the operation chosen to obtain that object's value from the object's value, and so on and so forth. One method for doing this is to let f(x) be the object (that was previously defined by the chosen procedure) and f(x) the result of the procedure.\n\n### For Every Input, there is an Output\n\nWhat each number in the language does (for every number there is an output)\n\nNumber: input\n\n### If, Else\n\nIf and Else are a programming language statement used to specify conditions or branches\n\nIf (then):\n\nIf a variable is true, this part of the code is executed\n\nElse:\n\nIf the variable is false, this part of the will be entered into the code instead of the \"then\" portion\n\n### Math Example\n\n```\nif(a < b)\n\tif (a+b > c)\n  \t  p= a+b;\nelse\n\tp=a-b;\n```\n\n### Examples of Math/Calculus Problems using If/Else\n\n```\n3+4\n```\n\n## Code\n\n### Exercise: Functions\n\n#### Write a function called sum that takes two numbers and adds them.\n\n    function sum(x, y){\n        return number is sum;\n    }\n\n\n#### Write a recursive function called triple that takes any number as an input and returns the triple of that number.

Divide 66 (loaches of bread by 60; how many loaches of bread are in an hour. Divide 60 by 4: how many hours are in a loache of bread. 4 x 60 = 240. Multiply 4 (four) by each of these factors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 to determine the answer of the question. \n\nInput: 66 can be represented as 60 x 4- (60 divided by 4) so answer 4 x 6 is 240.\n\n### Questions:How many times can the sum of the 1st 19 odd numbers be divided by the 1st 5 even numbers?\n\n### Answer:11\n\n### Tasks:\n\n### Question #1:How many times can you subtract 3 from 15 and 7 from 7 to get the same answer?\n\n### Question#1:The question states to subtract 3 from 7 and 7 from 15. \nYou can subtract 3 7's to get to 3 - 3 = 0", "answer": "B: motel room"}

{"text": "D\n\n### Rationale:An atlas does not specify streets of a city or streets of a highway, but rather the general land mass and terrain of the whole country. This feature is useful to travelers because it provides a bird's eye view of the general geography of the country.\n\n#### Example:\nIn 1609, the English explorer of the New World and navigator Sir Francis Drake published \"The World Encompassed,\" the first English text printed on two continents. The text, which was written while Drake was in San Francisco Bay, was eventually published in London in 1628. In the book, Drake described his 1577 circumnavigation of the globe, describing the terrain of various land masses, as well as noting their navigable and treacherous nature. Some of the descriptions in the book would have been taken from maps, which had been created and used for centuries by explorers like Christopher Columbus, Vasco da Gama, and Ferdinand Magellan.:\u200a84\u201389\u200a Even earlier, the Ptolemy-Al-Maari map dating from 1300 was the first portrayal of the New World, with a depiction of the Aztec people.\n\n### Another example:\n\nIn the early 1870's the United States Coast Pilot System developed the first maps of American coastal waters, and in 1891 the United States Geological Survey produced an atlas, the 1:24,000 scale U.S. Geological Survey's Standard Map of the United States.:\u200a63,\u200a117\u200a The Department of the Interior's Geological Survey provided maps of the country until it was transferred in 1907 to the newly formed Bureau of the United States Geological and Geographical Survey, which was changed in 1969 to the USGS under the Department of the Interior. The bureau is responsible for mapping earthquake zones, mineral resources, and the water and wildlife, and is administered by an appointed director, and governed by national policy.

Therefore, 50% (1) of every 10 children do not have incapicitating deformities, and 50% (2) of the remaining 90 children do not have it. Therefore, it can be concluded that for every 1000 children, 500 children do not have an incapacitating disorder. \n\n### Input - What is 6 over \u00bd, simplified? \n\n### Rationailes - The numerator in the top fraction is six, and, as 6/2 = 3/1, there are three ones in \u00bd. Therefore, each of the six ones counts in half of a whole, or three and one third. The answer is three and one third.\n\n### Output - What is the sum of eight and seven?\n\n### Response -The sum of eight and seven is 15.\n\n### Rationale - Eight is 8+0 = 8 and seven is 7+0 = 7, so 8+7 = 15.\n### Input- What is a sum of twenty-six and twenty-two?", "answer": "E: children suffer"}

And when it's Wednesday, it will be the 4th days in the week, and you usually know that the last day in the week is Sunday, so that would make Monday and Wednesday the only two days that will be included in the choices for this problem.\n\n## Instructions\n\n1.

They paid with a total of $95. How much did each type of book cost?\n\n### Rationales\nOne book costs $19.5, two books costs $19.00(x2) = $38.00, three books costs $18.00(x3) = $54.00 \n\nTherefore $19.5 + $21.5 + $15.00 + $15.50 + $15 + $15 +$15.50 = $96(total cost) \n\nTo find the cost of each book, divide the total cost (the sum of the above) by the total number of books (the sum of the number of each type of book bought)\nSo the cost of each type of book = $96 (total cost) / 10 (total number of books) \n\nAnswer: One book costs = $19.5/10 = $1.95 \n\nTwo books cost = $19.0/10 = $ 1.90\n\nThree books cost = $18.0", "answer": "B: bamboo grove"}

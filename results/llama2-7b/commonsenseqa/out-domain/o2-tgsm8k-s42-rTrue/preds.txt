If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem involves determining how much money you would receive for recycling cans and newspapers. <n><n>First find out how many sets of 12 cans are in 144 cans. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total number of cans (144) by the number of cans per set (12). <n><n>144 ÷ 12 = 12 sets of cans. <n><n>Each set of can is worth $0.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the cans, multiply the number of sets (12) by the worth of each set ($0.50). <n><n>12 x $0.50 = $6 <n><n>Next, find out how many set of 5 kilograms of newspapers are in 20 kilograms. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total kilograms of newspapers (20) by the number of kilograms per set (5). <n><n>20 ÷ 5 = 4 sets of newspapers. <n><n>Each set of newspaper is worth $1.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the newspapers, multiply the number of sets (4) by the worth of each set ($1.50). <n><n>4 x $1.50 = $6 <n><n>Finally, to find the total money earned, add the worth of the cans and the newspapers together. <n><n>$6 (for cans) + $6 (for newspapers) = $12.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?<n>Rationales: Betty picked 16 strawberries. <n>Then, Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty which makes 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.<n>Therefore, Matthew picked 36 strawberries.<n>We know that Matthew picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. <n>So, Natalie picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries.<n>The total number of strawberries they all picked is 16 (Betty's) + 36 (Matthew's) + 18 (Natalie's) = 70 strawberries.<n>Each jar of jam requires 7 strawberries, so they can make 70 strawberries / 7 strawberries per jar = 10 jars of jam.<n>Each jar of jam is sold for $4, so they made 10 jars * $4 per jar = $40 from the strawberries they picked.<n>Therefore, they made $40 from selling the strawberries they picked.<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:What could prevent someone from buying chistmas presents? Choices:  A: happiness B: lack of money C: stress D: relief E: exhiliration<n><n>### Response:		<n>I find this question a bit confusing on how the choices are supposed to be selected, so I'm just going to take what I think seems to fit most closely to the prompt and go ahead. I think you're asking for what can prevent someone from buying christmas presents, but for some reason you said "chistmas presents" instead of "christmas presents." I would try to rephrase it a bit.<n>The choice that I believe is correct is A, happiness. <n><n>You could buy presents for people if you were happy, but you wouldn't buy presents for people if your unhappy. <n><n>I think you're giving four choices of possible reasons you wouldn't buy christmas presents. However there are other ways that you can't buy presents, but none of those were given as options as choices. <n><n>### Input<n>"Money does not buy happiness", as per a proverb.  <n>This sentence is known as a ______ sentence.  <n>Choices:  A: statement B: advice C: proverb D: question<n><n>### Response<n>A. Money does buy happiness as per a proverb, hence it is a statement.<n><n>### Input:"Sometimes it's a little harder." The sentence "Sometimes it's not always hard" is made up of 2 sentences. What is it called?  <n>Choices:A. Co-ordinate adverb clause B. Coordinate adverb clause and adverb clause C. Adverb Clause D.

D = disorientation and E = relocation. These don't mean anything and don't really make sense. They might make more sense if the wording was traveling while being underwater. In that case we could then conclude that B or C are more likely, as the wording could be metaphorical to being lost or confused while being "underwater". But the words "due to" and "relocation" don't really add any meaning either.<n><n>### Input<n><n>### Demostration<n><n>![](../assets/2-multiple-choice/MC-2a.gif)<n>![](../assets/-assets/2-multiple_choice/2b.gif)<n>### Comment:<n>Betty picked 16 stawberries, Matthew picked twice as many, and Natalie didn't pick but was still there and ate the strawberries. That's 20 (Matthew), 32 (Betty) and 20 (Natalie). So total was 72 strawberries. Now the Jam needs 7 strawberies per jar. That means for 72 strawperries divided bt 7 jars = 10 jams. each jam sells at $4, That means they sell 10 jams of jams at $4 per jam. That means they sell 40 jams and earn $40 profit<n><n><n><n><n>

When choosing B, the statement is "One must wear a white shoe".<n>   1. This statement is missing a word. There is no "in" or "with".<n>   1. There is also no "must" or "need".<n>2. When choosing C, the statement is "Closeet".<n>   1. The choice is wrong because "Closeet" has a different number of letters than the statement does (C has 2 letters, and the statement has 3 letters).<n>   1. The words are not in the same order as the statement.<n>   1. There are no other letters added to these two words (except for "the").<n>   1. The first letter of "the" is not added as a letter.<n>   1. It is not one of the words in the statement.<n>3. When choosing D, the statement is "Left".<n>   1.

As a building, the church is a repository of the world's greatest works of art. In the form of sculpture or painting, many of the best works of art ever done have been built as, or placed in, churches.<n><n>### A) The art was placed in the churches for beauty.<n>### B) The relationship between the church and art goes back at least a thousand years.<n>### C) Great works of art that are considered to be "high art" are built as, or placed into, churches.<n><n>As a repository of art objects and buildings, the church represents a very large part of the world's cultural heritage. These objects represent religious beliefs and, even more important, a link to the past, connecting people with their ancestors. This was not the original intent of the builders, but the presence of such objects in the church created a tradition for religious people and their art.<n><n>The church also houses the church's property, which can become the subject of worship on its own. This aspect of the church's art is one that art dealers, curators, and museum people call "high art." It is important to understand that the church itself has only recently begun to treat such art as a part of its artistic program.<n><n>The relationship between the church and the arts has not been one of goodwill and trust all the time. Many of the most famous works of art, from Michelangelo's ceiling of the Sistine Chapel to Giotto's paintings in the chapel of Assisi, have been commissioned by the church with special instructions. These instructions may have been to show the nature of the church, to present a new view of Christ, or to simply show the church's wealth. These commissions can lead to serious confrontations between church and client. Even when there is no conflict, many of the greatest religious works of art were created by artists who belonged to another sect or religion altogether. In the case of the work of Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475-1564), he was a devout Catholic who wanted to use his talents to help his faith. He was one of the few painters

Choices:  A: open meadow B: arctic tundra C: beach D: great outdoors E: england<n><n>### Response:		Open meadow<n><n>### Justification: A fox typically hunts in any area that is near food sources, however the best place it can be found when not in a forest is open meadow. This is because open meadow can have the perfect set up. There are grass, herbs, etc that are there for the prey, but they don't run away when they see the fox (because the predator is usually a great fox.) In a forest, it's a lot harder to find a place where it doesn't get disrupted when hunts. It has grass areas, however it also has rocky, uneven places that will get out of balance and be hard to chase prey when running through forests.<n><n>### Inputs:For a field trip tomorrow, your teacher would like you to get a sample of a bony fish.

E.A mudflat. <n><n>### Response and Justification:A stream<n><n>### Input for Demonstration on Input:<n>A bony fish is common in lakes, rivers and mudflats. This fish is a little bit special compared to others since they have the biggest brains in relation to its body. Even though people prefer to eat salmon, some people may want a bony fish. This fish is also common in aquariums. They like to eat a variety of seafood and they are easy to maintain. The reason why some people do not like them is their teeth, which have to be removed to make the food taste better. Another issue this kind of fish is facing is its decline in population. Most people have forgotten how this kind of fish tastes good. Also, there is more demand for salmon and other species that is eaten with their own teeth removed than this fish.<n><n>### Response to Input for Demonstrations On Input:<n>A boney fish is also known as flat back. It is a marine ecosystem. Boney fish’s predators depend on where they live. In the ocean, they are mostly eaten by starfish and sharks. In the streams, they are eaten by other fish. In rivers boney fish is most vulnerable because they don’t have any shields for their body.

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem involves determining how much money you would receive for recycling cans and newspapers. <n><n>First find out how many sets of 12 cans are in 144 cans. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total number of cans (144) by the number of cans per set (12). <n><n>144 ÷ 12 = 12 sets of cans. <n><n>Each set of can is worth $0.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the cans, multiply the number of sets (12) by the worth of each set ($0.50). <n><n>12 x $0.50 = $6 <n><n>Next, find out how many set of 5 kilograms of newspapers are in 20 kilograms. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total kilograms of newspapers (20) by the number of kilograms per set (5). <n><n>20 ÷ 5 = 4 sets of newspapers. <n><n>Each set of newspaper is worth $1.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the newspapers, multiply the number of sets (4) by the worth of each set ($1.50). <n><n>4 x $1.50 = $6 <n><n>Finally, to find the total money earned, add the worth of the cans and the newspapers together. <n><n>$6 (for cans) + $6 (for newspapers) = $12.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?<n>Rationales: Betty picked 16 strawberries. <n>Then, Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty which makes 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.<n>Therefore, Matthew picked 36 strawberries.<n>We know that Matthew picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. <n>So, Natalie picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries.<n>The total number of strawberries they all picked is 16 (Betty's) + 36 (Matthew's) + 18 (Natalie's) = 70 strawberries.<n>Each jar of jam requires 7 strawberries, so they can make 70 strawberries / 7 strawberries per jar = 10 jars of jam.<n>Each jar of jam is sold for $4, so they made 10 jars * $4 per jar = $40 from the strawberries they picked.<n>Therefore, they made $40 from selling the strawberries they picked.<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:What cuisine is joked about eating small dogs?

But if I am on a budget, then I would go to the one with the best deal.<n><n>### Response for both:<n>The first one would be better for me because it's a 7 dollar and you can only go to one.<n><n>I would rather see and pay for those because they might be a good quality or better quality movie.<n><n>The one that I would not want to see or waste my money on would be the 4 dollar movies because it's only for three movies so you have to see at least 2/3rds of the movies but I think I can only go to one because its only for $4 and you have to pay for that price three times.<n>

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem involves determining how much money you would receive for recycling cans and newspapers. <n><n>First find out how many sets of 12 cans are in 144 cans. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total number of cans (144) by the number of cans per set (12). <n><n>144 ÷ 12 = 12 sets of cans. <n><n>Each set of can is worth $0.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the cans, multiply the number of sets (12) by the worth of each set ($0.50). <n><n>12 x $0.50 = $6 <n><n>Next, find out how many set of 5 kilograms of newspapers are in 20 kilograms. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total kilograms of newspapers (20) by the number of kilograms per set (5). <n><n>20 ÷ 5 = 4 sets of newspapers. <n><n>Each set of newspaper is worth $1.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the newspapers, multiply the number of sets (4) by the worth of each set ($1.50). <n><n>4 x $1.50 = $6 <n><n>Finally, to find the total money earned, add the worth of the cans and the newspapers together. <n><n>$6 (for cans) + $6 (for newspapers) = $12.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?<n>Rationales: Betty picked 16 strawberries. <n>Then, Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty which makes 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.<n>Therefore, Matthew picked 36 strawberries.<n>We know that Matthew picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. <n>So, Natalie picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries.<n>The total number of strawberries they all picked is 16 (Betty's) + 36 (Matthew's) + 18 (Natalie's) = 70 strawberries.<n>Each jar of jam requires 7 strawberries, so they can make 70 strawberries / 7 strawberries per jar = 10 jars of jam.<n>Each jar of jam is sold for $4, so they made 10 jars * $4 per jar = $40 from the strawberries they picked.<n>Therefore, they made $40 from selling the strawberries they picked.<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:Where would you find performers on a platform in public?

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem involves determining how much money you would receive for recycling cans and newspapers. <n><n>First find out how many sets of 12 cans are in 144 cans. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total number of cans (144) by the number of cans per set (12). <n><n>144 ÷ 12 = 12 sets of cans. <n><n>Each set of can is worth $0.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the cans, multiply the number of sets (12) by the worth of each set ($0.50). <n><n>12 x $0.50 = $6 <n><n>Next, find out how many set of 5 kilograms of newspapers are in 20 kilograms. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total kilograms of newspapers (20) by the number of kilograms per set (5). <n><n>20 ÷ 5 = 4 sets of newspapers. <n><n>Each set of newspaper is worth $1.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the newspapers, multiply the number of sets (4) by the worth of each set ($1.50). <n><n>4 x $1.50 = $6 <n><n>Finally, to find the total money earned, add the worth of the cans and the newspapers together. <n><n>$6 (for cans) + $6 (for newspapers) = $12.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?<n>Rationales: Betty picked 16 strawberries. <n>Then, Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty which makes 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.<n>Therefore, Matthew picked 36 strawberries.<n>We know that Matthew picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. <n>So, Natalie picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries.<n>The total number of strawberries they all picked is 16 (Betty's) + 36 (Matthew's) + 18 (Natalie's) = 70 strawberries.<n>Each jar of jam requires 7 strawberries, so they can make 70 strawberries / 7 strawberries per jar = 10 jars of jam.<n>Each jar of jam is sold for $4, so they made 10 jars * $4 per jar = $40 from the strawberries they picked.<n>Therefore, they made $40 from selling the strawberries they picked.<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:Where do people find bills with bread?

Choices:  A: new york B: concert C: tv studio D: gig E: recording studio<n><n>### Response:		The best answer is:A<n><n>Answer: The microphone boom is used to pick up sound, so it would make sense if it were located in a place full of lots of noise such as a stock market event, or concert. In contrast, a microphone boom would not be used in a television studio because only one person, the host, would be speaking; the microphone itself would be adequate for picking up the host's speech. A concert would be another place to put a microphone boom because when 100 or more people are singing together, the boom would have a job to pick up all the sounds, just as it would in the sound booth. Finally, in a recording studio, one person at a time is allowed to speak and is miked, so there is usually no need for a microphone boom. <n><n>Answer: The best answer is:A <n>#recursion<n>### Instruction Use recursion to solve the following.<n><n>### Input For n = 3, there are 2 ways to arrange the numbers in a pyramid scheme. For n = 4, there are 3 ways to arrange the number in a pyramid. For n = 5, there are 4 ways to arrange the three digits in a pyramid, and so on. How many ways are there to arrange n different digits in a pyramidal arrangement? Rationales: The function to arrange n different numbers in a pyramidal shape uses recursion. This can be explained by going back to its mathematical definition. For example, let’s start with n=3. There are two ways to place three numbers, 1, 2, and 3, in a pyramidal scheme. The first method places 1 on top then 3 with 2 in the middle and bottom. It can be explained with the code (1, 2, 3) (3,2, 1) The second method places 2 on top then 3 and 1 with 2 in the center. It can be explained as (2, 1 )(1,2,3)(3, 1, 2) Next, for n=4, there are three ways to arrange the four numbers. One is 1 on top and 2-3-4 below it in a triangle. It can be explained using the code (

So, the quote's tone is not comparing.<n><n>Answer: _____<n><n>## Inputs:<n>In what ways are the two authors trying to persuade us by using pathos? Give an example of each. <n><n>Rationale <n><n>To persuade the reader about a certain idea, it is used to gain support from the reader by appealing to their emotion. <n>The emotions that the authors are trying to appeal to us are:<n>- Sadness<n>- Pity<n>- Anger<n>- Pain<n>- Joy/Happiness <n>- Fear<n><n>Example: Ex 1: <n><n>The first author might persuade the reader by using:<n><n>- Pathos: Pity: "We can do all this because of the bravery and sacrifices of brave men and women who, with unwavering resolve, fought to keep our nation free from communist powers and terrors."<n>- Emotion: Sadness/Anger/Pain: "How can the American people be so heartless"?<n><n><n>The second author might persuade the readers by using <n><n>- Pathos.<n>- Emotion: Fear: "We're all human in some way, but they are not human, and in a sense the more I know them the less you can call them human at all."<n><n>Ex 2: <n><n>
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: For every 12 cans you recycle, you receive $0.50, and for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, you receive $1.50. If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem involves determining how much money you would receive for recycling cans and newspapers. <n><n>First find out how many sets of 12 cans are in 144 cans. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total number of cans (144) by the number of cans per set (12). <n><n>144 ÷ 12 = 12 sets of cans. <n><n>Each set of can is worth $0.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the cans, multiply the number of sets (12) by the worth of each set ($0.50). <n><n>12 x $0.50 = $6 <n><n>Next, find out how many set of 5 kilograms of newspapers are in 20 kilograms. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total kilograms of newspapers (20) by the number of kilograms per set (5). <n><n>20 ÷ 5 = 4 sets of newspapers. <n><n>Each set of newspaper is worth $1.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the newspapers, multiply the number of sets (4) by the worth of each set ($1.50). <n><n>4 x $1.50 = $6 <n><n>Finally, to find the total money earned, add the worth of the cans and the newspapers together. <n><n>$6 (for cans) + $6 (for newspapers) = $12.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?<n>Rationales: Betty picked 16 strawberries. <n>Then, Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty which makes 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.<n>Therefore, Matthew picked 36 strawberries.<n>We know that Matthew picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. <n>So, Natalie picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries.<n>The total number of strawberries they all picked is 16 (Betty's) + 36 (Matthew's) + 18 (Natalie's) = 70 strawberries.<n>Each jar of jam requires 7 strawberries, so they can make 70 strawberries / 7 strawberries per jar = 10 jars of jam.<n>Each jar of jam is sold for $4, so they made 10 jars * $4 per jar = $40 from the strawberries they picked.<n>Therefore, they made $40 from selling the strawberries they picked.<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:Where are you if your reading magazines while waiting for a vehicle on rails? Choices:  A: vegetables B: market C: doctor D: train station E: bookstore<n><n>### Response:		A (vegetables)<n><n>### Rationale:<n>Input: Where are you if your reading magazine while waiting for a vehicle?<n><n>Since vegetables are commonly sold at markets, if the person is reading magazines and waiting for a vehicle is in a market or a bookstore and wait for a train respectively.<n><n>Answer: A (vegetables) or B (bookstore)<n>

Choices:  A: play B: movies C: theater D: screen E: television<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The correct response is A, play. The reason behind this choice is that the actor is performing, not being a part of the production. You don’t see actors in theater or movies on the screen, nor do they perform on the television, as that is reserved for the medium the actor is performing on.<n><n>### Input. : How Many can I Save? Choose A and enter the number of gallons that you can save; or choose B and enter the number of miles that you can drive.<n><n>### Response<n><n>The correct response would be A, the number of gallons you can save. This is because if you are able to save a number of gallons of gas you have essentially saved yourself money.<n><n>### Question:<n>What is a negative number?<n><n>### Instuction:Complete the sentence.<n><n>Gerard’s brother is three years older than Gerard. How much_______older is his brother?<n><n>### Response 1<n><n>The correct response given is “years old.<n><n>The reason to which this is the correct response is because “than Gerard” means greater than Gerard, while “_____ old” means, years old. Gerard’s brother is years older than Gerard does not make sense, therefore; the correct answer is years old.<n><n>### Solution 1<n><n>If you are looking for the number of years, there is no age, so the correct response would be “years.” If you are looking for the age in years, the correct response would be 3 years old.<n><n>Explanation: There's also the answer of 3. That makes more sense. For example: How many years are there in 3 and a half years? The answer is 3 and half years. However if you're looking for the age, the answer is 4 years, not 3 years old. Years, however, makes sense for the first part, asking for the number of years while 4 does not.<n><n>### Analysis<n><n>### Source 1<n><n>### Source2<n><n>![Rubric4](assets/img/Rubric4.png)

What might she be a member of? Choices:  A: assisted living facility B: old people's home C: high school or college D: republican party E: organization<n><n>### Response:		The term High School or College is used interchangeably in this context. <n><n>### Response Justification: <n><n>#### A. Assisted Living Facility - There are other terms that might be used in this context.  These could be facilities like a nursing home but it doesn't fit.  There are numerous websites listing assisting living facilities in the area, such as [this](http://www.assistedlivingtoday.com/assisted-living/pa/philadelphia/916-woodrow-avenue#.U11xBnV9K9I).  Assisted living facilities are facilities that provide various care services to people who require assistance with their care. They are for disabled people of various ages and abilities but primarily seniors.  In a few states they are required to be called assisted living rather than senior living, as they don't provide care related to aging. <n><n>#### B. Old People's Home - In the United States this is a pejorative term, that is the term itself has no real merit, nor does this appear to be anything that would be used in that context. There are various old peoples homes in the area but they go by other names, such as [this facility](http://www.montgomerycountypa.gov/AgingAndAdultService/assistedliving.aspx) which lists this as an assisted living facility. <n><n>#### C. High School or College - <n><n>#### D. Republican Party - There are numerous party facilities in the area as well as the State and County Democratic Party offices.  There are no other party organizations that are known to exist for any of the other organizations listed, such as the Democratic Party, that are also political parties, or non-partisan organizations like the Republican Party, the Libertarian Party, the Democratic People's Party, etc. <n><n>#### E. Organization - There are many organizations in the area, such [as this](http://www.meetup.com/southeastern-pa-forestry-association/), these are organizations but not affiliated with a political party or a political ideology. Sally is in her senior year as a college attendee at the time, she would most likely be an organization that represented college or high school students. <n><n>## Input:You are

Choices: A; residential neighborhood B: suburbs C: market D: suburbs E: community<n><n>A gas station should be located in a residential neighborhood as it's a building used to dispense fuel for transport. For a gas station to be constructed in a residential neighborhood, the area should have a huge space. It means that a residential neighborhood is a place filled with houses and big space around them. It gives more sense for a gas station to be found in a residential neighborhood. In contrast, a gas station should not be in a mosque because it's a place of worship of Muslims who will have difficulty finding fuel.<n><n>A mosque should be located in the center and this can only be possible in a community because it gives a place for prayer. <n><n>A hospital should be located in residential neighborhood too because people live there and the space is huge for a school building. A hospital is a place where people are treated for illness. Therefore, it is a place where ill people can be taken care of since hospitals are very big and have space.<n><n>Therefore, a gas station should be located where people live.

So I will ignore this option.<n><n>B: <n>Sometimes people buy a set of plates that they will use together for special events so they are put away when not in use. This doesn't mean they put things in the kitchen cupboard so this answer is incorrect.<n><n>C: <n>The table, in my opinion, is an incorrect answer option because the table is where you put dishes and food so unless you bought a collectibles set the table wouldn't be what for the weekend to put your collectibles in. I will ignore this option as well.<n><n>D: <n>This option is incorrect because a flea market is only where you sell your collectibles not where you put them and also it is uncommon to put collectibles in the dishwasher.<n><n>E: <n>A dishwasher is nowhere to put collectibles so this answer is incorrect as well.<n><n>### Total Rationales:<n>I believe the correct answer choice is C because the collectibles weren't put into a kitchen cupboard or the table since collectibles were not bought to use everyday in your kitchen/for set lunches.<n><n>Rather, it is more likely that the collectibles were bought to put into storage. This answer makes sense because you would buy collectibles to keep in storage and put away when they are not in use.<n><n><n><n>

This will ensure that the child will happily enjoy their time at play. It is also important to teach children how to behave as they are having fun. If the child is walking slowly, it could be because they are unsure of their environment. If the child is sitting while going to play, it does not guarantee they will have a pleasant experience. Being entertained and laughing could be the case in a stressful situation, not a happy and easy one. Therefore, they are unlikely to do this while going to play.<n><n>**Question : ** <n><n>### Demographics: A student's income from working during the summer is $346. They saved the money and spent $54 of it on a pizza delivery. They kept $33 of the remaining money for their birthday. How much money did the student have left after they worked all summer?<n><n>### Demand: A student's total income from working during the summmer is $346 and they kept $33 of it for their birthday. The student's income was $346 - $54 spent on pizza delivery = $392 then they kept $33 so their remaining money is $359<n>### Calculate: $359 - the $392 they spent at the beginning = -$32. <n><n>The student kept $33 and didn't keep $54 spent on delivery, therefore they had a smaller amount of money to keep for their birthday.<n><n>### Conclusion: The student spent $54 on pizza delivery, and after accounting for that and keeping $33 for their birthday, the student had a remaining amount of $359 - $54 = $305.<n>

For example, Python can be run on a simple CPU system as well as a powerful multi-CPU system. The only requirement to run Python is an operational computer program. Here are the necessary steps to help you complete a block of Python code. <n>1) Type a block of Python code into your editor. Type each line of your code in the same order that it is presented in your book. Keep in mind that when you are finished writing your code, your block of code should have exactly the same coding as what is presented in the Example programs in the chapters.  2) Once you type in your code, save your file as ProgrammingLogicPython.py (Example #1 in the chapter).  3) Run the program by launching the Python interpreter and using the import statement from Chapter 2

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem involves determining how much money you would receive for recycling cans and newspapers. <n><n>First find out how many sets of 12 cans are in 144 cans. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total number of cans (144) by the number of cans per set (12). <n><n>144 ÷ 12 = 12 sets of cans. <n><n>Each set of can is worth $0.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the cans, multiply the number of sets (12) by the worth of each set ($0.50). <n><n>12 x $0.50 = $6 <n><n>Next, find out how many set of 5 kilograms of newspapers are in 20 kilograms. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total kilograms of newspapers (20) by the number of kilograms per set (5). <n><n>20 ÷ 5 = 4 sets of newspapers. <n><n>Each set of newspaper is worth $1.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the newspapers, multiply the number of sets (4) by the worth of each set ($1.50). <n><n>4 x $1.50 = $6 <n><n>Finally, to find the total money earned, add the worth of the cans and the newspapers together. <n><n>$6 (for cans) + $6 (for newspapers) = $12.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?<n>Rationales: Betty picked 16 strawberries. <n>Then, Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty which makes 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.<n>Therefore, Matthew picked 36 strawberries.<n>We know that Matthew picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. <n>So, Natalie picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries.<n>The total number of strawberries they all picked is 16 (Betty's) + 36 (Matthew's) + 18 (Natalie's) = 70 strawberries.<n>Each jar of jam requires 7 strawberries, so they can make 70 strawberries / 7 strawberries per jar = 10 jars of jam.<n>Each jar of jam is sold for $4, so they made 10 jars * $4 per jar = $40 from the strawberries they picked.<n>Therefore, they made $40 from selling the strawberries they picked.<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:The investigator considered the gun evidence, where did he send it?

Choices:  A: library B: parties C: kindergarten class D: bar E: school<n><n>### Response:		In this context, a student who is about to graduate would no longer be attaining any of the choices. This is because when a student graduates, he or she would no longer be attain a bar unless they choose to take a bar exam. In the same way, they will not be attaining a library or a kindergarten class because they are too old and would no longer require these in their lives. Therefore, a student would no longer be attained a party either because parties are usually thrown in celebration for people not graduating. Therefore, a student cannot attend parties. Because a student is graduating, he or she would not enroll in kindergarten classes. Therefore, a person who is about to graduation would not be attaining a kindergarten class. To summarize, a graduating student will no longer be attaining school, a bar, a party, a library or a kindergartener class.<n><n>### Input :How many apples are there in the basket?

The dining table was on sale for $180. What was the total cost of the table and 2 chairs?<n>Rationales The problem involves calculating the total price of the table and two chairs. First find the value of Pete’s table, which is the sale price of the table ($180). <n>The two chairs were on sale. First, find the original price of the chairs, then subtract the sale price from the original price and multiply that amount by 2, which equals the savings that Pete made on the chairs. <n>Original Price of Chairs = $65 <n>Sale Price of Chairs = -$30 <n>Savings per Chair = $65 - $30 = -$35 <n>Savings on Chairs = -$110 <n>Then, determine the total price of the new table and two chairs by subtracting the original price of the table from the total price of the entire purchase. <n>New Table and Two Chairs: $285 - $180 = $105 <n>Price of Two Chairs with Savings: $65 - $110 = -$45 <n>Total Price of Table plus two Chairs: $45 + $105 = $150<n><n>### Demostration:<n>(C) The answer is the drawer because it is possible to multiply 12 by 3 and then add a negative number to get the total value of a set. <n>(D) The answer is the desk because it is possible to divide 20 by 2 and round down to get the total value required of a group of two people. <n>(E) This question is not related to multiplication and division, so it cannot be used to determine the value of the items on the table. <n>(F) This question is not about multiplication and division so it is not about determining value.<n>Answer:C <n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following question.<n><n>## Demonstration:The answer is multiple ruler because it is possible to multiple 2 by one

Choices:  A: make noise B: have tea C: make time D: make payments E: take time<n><n>### Response:		If you were to make noise in a bank, that would be considered disruptive, since you're not supposed to yell, talk loudly, clap hands loudly, or speak loudly in a bank. However, it is acceptable to make tea, which is also referred to as food and drink. Another reason is because it takes time away from making payments in the bank, and in order to take any time away from payments the customers must provide evidence that they have been trying to make a payment. In a bank you must always make payments if you want to make money out of going to a bank.

It appeared that they were both trying hard to help their children with their homework. <n>Their class teacher began to talk about the problem of how to help children who have a hard time learning at school get better grades and how to encourage them to do better at school in the future. She suggested that the parents of children who have learning difficulties should read to their children instead of expecting their children to sit and do some work on their own. <n><n>The husband nodded and said, If our children did not study, they would fail their exams. The wife agreed. She said that they should give their children the best possible education and help them in every way they could as their future depended on it. <n>At the end of the class, she added that it would take years for her husband to realize how hard his wife was working, and it would be too late to do anything then.<n>After the class, she was talking to her husband in a corner of the classroom. She asked him if he understood what she had said to him earlier. He said, "Yes, but I still want us to keep helping our children at school as they need it." She smiled at her husband and said, "I did not mean that we should stop helping them study and I did not mean that I felt angry, but we should not feel that we are harder than our husbands."<n>A: If our children did not... they would fail their examination. <n>B: Then, we should not feel that our children are harder...<n>Answer: D<n><n>### Input :  <n>"Suggest a few things we can do to help our children do better at school."

After their final run, player A wins by a distance of 30 meters, player B wins by a distance of one meter more than player C wins, and player C wins by the smallest amount, which is only a distance of 2 inches. How far does each player run?<n><n>### Rationales: Each player runs 30 miles. Then 31 miles. Then 32 miles. Then 33 miles.<n>The first two players do not win by the same exact distance, but within a certain span.<n>Both players will increase their distance by one mile, so A will run 33 miles, C will run 32 miles, and B will run 31 miles as the third mile of their run.<n>Each player runs the same distance again, and then crosses a field that is equal to the total distance they have traveled. A can win by a distance of 29 miles. B can win by a distance closer to 30 miles.<n>Therefor, C's mileage is 30 miles, Bs mileage is close to 30 miles, and A's mileage is close 29 miles.<n>This means they all run 30(the first run) + (1(second run)) = 31miles. Then they each have to run the same distance again (31 x 3 = 93) and then run 93 as the third distance, across the field. Then they have finished. Thus, they all ran 93 miles. <n><n>A wins if they had 29 miles to cross the field, and they won by 30 more miles than B.<n>A = 29(first run) + (30(second run)) +(93(third run)) + (field)=3032+ 93<n><n>B wins if they had 30 miles to cross the field and they win by only

Clean as needed says to clean according to your needs, which doesn't answer the question of how often should you clean your home. While I do like a clean house and clean up as I go with pets, that is a long-term answer that doesn't answer if I should clean every day.<n><n>Similarly, clean before company arrives and clean while cooking are irrelevant and not answers.<n><n>(B) Clean as Needed<n><n>This answer makes sense for this instruction. It tells the reader to clean when you notice there is something that needs to be cleaned so it doesn't become dirty. Also, no one is coming over to inspect your house for cleanliness, so if they see it, it is too late then.<n><n>### Incorrect<n><n>Clean as needed is not a good answer. This tells the reader that I should wait until my house becomes dirty and then I should clean it. This may not always be the best thing as I may not always have time to clean the dirt, which means I will need to take breaks as I scrub and will be spending a long time cleaning. The second part doesn't make sense as again, if your home is dirty, people may have already seen it or if

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem involves determining how much money you would receive for recycling cans and newspapers. <n><n>First find out how many sets of 12 cans are in 144 cans. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total number of cans (144) by the number of cans per set (12). <n><n>144 ÷ 12 = 12 sets of cans. <n><n>Each set of can is worth $0.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the cans, multiply the number of sets (12) by the worth of each set ($0.50). <n><n>12 x $0.50 = $6 <n><n>Next, find out how many set of 5 kilograms of newspapers are in 20 kilograms. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total kilograms of newspapers (20) by the number of kilograms per set (5). <n><n>20 ÷ 5 = 4 sets of newspapers. <n><n>Each set of newspaper is worth $1.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the newspapers, multiply the number of sets (4) by the worth of each set ($1.50). <n><n>4 x $1.50 = $6 <n><n>Finally, to find the total money earned, add the worth of the cans and the newspapers together. <n><n>$6 (for cans) + $6 (for newspapers) = $12.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?<n>Rationales: Betty picked 16 strawberries. <n>Then, Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty which makes 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.<n>Therefore, Matthew picked 36 strawberries.<n>We know that Matthew picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. <n>So, Natalie picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries.<n>The total number of strawberries they all picked is 16 (Betty's) + 36 (Matthew's) + 18 (Natalie's) = 70 strawberries.<n>Each jar of jam requires 7 strawberries, so they can make 70 strawberries / 7 strawberries per jar = 10 jars of jam.<n>Each jar of jam is sold for $4, so they made 10 jars * $4 per jar = $40 from the strawberries they picked.<n>Therefore, they made $40 from selling the strawberries they picked.<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:Where is a fox likely to be caught?

I lost his shoes, didn't know where they landed, and had to run from the corner store to his home.  About where did he run? Choices:  A: a bed of nails B: town C: attractive consistent look D: city block E: ground<n><n>### Response:		<n>I agree with your answer: Choice E is the most reasonable solution. Bob needs to protect his feet, so a bed of nails or an attractive consistent look would likely make his feet hurt. A ground or city block are not very risky options either. However, Bob is an excellent runner. He can run a long distance without any shoes. Therefore, a ground or a city block is a better choice.<n><n>### Input<n>The most likely solution would be a ground because it would be the least dangerous to his feet. It is also the most likely solution because it is the most realistic. Most people cannot run long distances without any shoes because their feet would hurt.<n><n># Author: Rana<n>

To avoid overbuilding, no lot can have more than two bars and restaurants and no more than one bar and restaurant on a block. To build a new place, you would have to pay a total of $115 for the materials. At the end of your project, you plan to sell one lot. If you plan to build a school next to the pizza shop, it will have an admission fee of $30 per person. The school will receive the 25% of the profit based on total money earned from each of the bars and restaurants that is in each of your developed areas. If you build a pizza shop, make a barbecue restaurant, and rent each unit for $8 per square foot, how many square feet do they have? If you sell a lot next to the bar, a barbecue restaurant will receive the same amount as the pizza shop which is 75% of the profit. If a pizza shop builds next to a school, the school building will pay $50. If you build a school next to a bar, the school building will receive $20. If you build next to a lot next to a store, the store has a 50% profit. Write a response that accurately completes the request:<n><n>### Rationale:

Choices:  A: unfeeling B: negligence C: antipathy D: indifferent E: rapport<n><n>### Response:		I will complete the instruction by using the instruction to identify the response that best answers the question. Here are the steps I used to answer the question:<n>1. The question asked was about a  feeling toward. I have learned the definition of a feeling. A feeling is a sensation made by a person's body that is either good or bad. If I think of a person I am angry with, I am angry because I have a feeling of anger toward that person. <n>2. The question stated that someone who "doesn't care about about [or care about] and wishes them to fail" has what feeling. "Wishes" can be substituted with "hopes" or "wants" so for now I will use the substitution and write it as "A person who does not care [or who cares not] and who hopes the other person will fail" has what? To find out what the person has we need to think about the different types of feelings. "Wise" is an adjective word for  "Wise" is the only one out of the choices it is not an adjective to a group of people, so they must be the feeling. So the question is asking about a feeling toward someone who wishes they fail. So what feeling could someone have toward someone who wishes they will fail? The feeling must be a bad feeling. Out of the choices, the only bad feeling listed is "antipathy". Therefore, antipathy is the correct response to answer the question.<n>

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem involves determining how much money you would receive for recycling cans and newspapers. <n><n>First find out how many sets of 12 cans are in 144 cans. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total number of cans (144) by the number of cans per set (12). <n><n>144 ÷ 12 = 12 sets of cans. <n><n>Each set of can is worth $0.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the cans, multiply the number of sets (12) by the worth of each set ($0.50). <n><n>12 x $0.50 = $6 <n><n>Next, find out how many set of 5 kilograms of newspapers are in 20 kilograms. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total kilograms of newspapers (20) by the number of kilograms per set (5). <n><n>20 ÷ 5 = 4 sets of newspapers. <n><n>Each set of newspaper is worth $1.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the newspapers, multiply the number of sets (4) by the worth of each set ($1.50). <n><n>4 x $1.50 = $6 <n><n>Finally, to find the total money earned, add the worth of the cans and the newspapers together. <n><n>$6 (for cans) + $6 (for newspapers) = $12.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?<n>Rationales: Betty picked 16 strawberries. <n>Then, Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty which makes 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.<n>Therefore, Matthew picked 36 strawberries.<n>We know that Matthew picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. <n>So, Natalie picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries.<n>The total number of strawberries they all picked is 16 (Betty's) + 36 (Matthew's) + 18 (Natalie's) = 70 strawberries.<n>Each jar of jam requires 7 strawberries, so they can make 70 strawberries / 7 strawberries per jar = 10 jars of jam.<n>Each jar of jam is sold for $4, so they made 10 jars * $4 per jar = $40 from the strawberries they picked.<n>Therefore, they made $40 from selling the strawberries they picked.<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:The man was playfully wrestling with a woman he was enamored with, what was the physiological result? Choices:  A: competition B: blood C: wins D: medals E: erections<n><n>### Response:		<n>The physiological result of a man playfully wrestling with the woman he is enamored with is blood.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>The result of a man playing with the woman he is in love with is that his blood circulates to his brain to stimulate sexual desire. <n><n>In this scenario, the man is also playing with a woman. <n><n>So, the blood will circulate to his brain to stimate sexual desire. <n>This phenomenon is called "erections". <n><n>

Choices:  A: villa B: spacecraft C: hall D: palace E: hotel<n><n>### Response:		You should start by recognizing and defining unknown terms. We know the verb "to be" and we know that we are talking about a building on a vacation/relaxation holiday. We also know that the building is either small or large. The two extremes are "small" and "large."<n><n>The statement also defines that the cabin was not "available" anymore. This means that they couldnt use it any more as they had previously planned.<n><n>The verb "to be" also implies that the phrase "were upgraded to" means they had to somehow choose a different place.<n><n>### Next, you can identify and interpret the meaning of the key words. Key words are words that have very specific meanings in specific language forms.<n>We know they are talking about a building because of "were upgraded" and "the cabin" which indicates a space and a thing that is located somewhere.<n><n>The location is not indicated but we assume the vacation/relaxation place where they were previously staying.<n><n>We also know that "the cabin" is not available to them because that is the very next set of words.<n><n>We do not know why "the cabin" cannot be used anymore.<n><n>This information indicates that there is no specific choice for "the cabin" in this scenario so we have to consider what other options are available.<n><n>### Finally, we look at the words and phrases to identify the structure of the sentence. We are looking for conjunctions that can help us identify the different parts of the sentence.<n><n>We can identify the different parts of this sentence by looking at any words and phrases that are joined by a punctuation mark such as a comma or a coordinating conjunction.<n><n>There are 2 sets of punctuation marks in the sentence.<n><n>This is one set: "and the cabin"<n><n>This is the other set: "or spacecraft, or hall, or palace, or hotel."<n><n>Now we can read the sentence to get a sense of what it is saying:<n><n>"There was not a small cabin when they planned for their vacation/relaxation trip" this means it wasn't large enough so they had to decide. Maybe they took another trip somewhere else and had to stay somewhere else.<n><n>"However, they were upgraded to something like a villa, or spacecraft, or hall or palace or hotels." This

They would like the great pyramid to be the greatest building on earth by its appearance and size. Although it was very small in size compared to what we are used to today it was the tallest building structure at that time. The pyramid was originally much higher than it is today, with one third of its height missing. It was built in a shape of a perfect four-sided pyramid, with each side measuring 230 meters. This pyramid was built mainly with stone blocks, and if put in a modern day’s context it would almost be impossible and way to costly. To make this pyramid even more interesting is the very high level of technological know-how at that age. It was built by cutting and transporting stone blocks and stacking them together to form a structure. This was all done by hand.<n><n><n>### Instructions: There will be one free response question that will come from 2 or 3 choice questions. <n><n>### Input on the question: A train leaves a certain city traveling 233km south toward another city.

Choices:  A: sea world B: court room C: shallow waters D: poker game E: card shark<n><n>### Response:		In my opinion, I think the response should be "Card Shark."<n><n>### Here's how we reached that conclusion: <n><n>After thinking about the question we understood that it was more about what the players were playing and not about how they felt. Based on how much emotion the players felt we were able to eliminate possible choices that describe how they were feeling. <n><n>First we ruled out that they were playing in "Shallow Waters." Playing in shallow water can result in harm to an animal and players are required to be careful since water can move unexpectedly. Also there is an animal that lives in the "Shallow Waters", that can potentially harm people. Since there are so many aspects that suggest that players are careful when playing in shallow water it is likely they are not playing in shallow water. To eliminate choice A as our answer we ruled out the possibility that they were playing in Sea World. We were also able to rule out choice B as an answer choice because there was no evidence that players would be playing in a court room.<n><n>Next, we ruled out the possibility of playing in "Court Room" when players were emotionless in choice C. This ruled out the option of playing the "Poker game" since they were not being emotional. Since there was no evidence that the players were enjoying the other options and this was likely unlikely we chose the option with the "Card Shark" in the blank which is choice D. <n><n>### Further explanation: <n><n>This answer choice was picked because it is the least unlikely out of the choices given. This is because one of the cards in this game is that of an icy shark which lives in a tank in the background zoo. There are also other cards that involve the "shark." This shows that the game is most likely a "Card Shark Game" because the least likely answer choices were picked out first and this was the last game picked to explain what the players were playing. This last game also stands out more than the other choices because there is more evidence supporting the claim that the answer is in this choice and less on the other choices.<n>

The shopping mall is usually located in a heavily populated, suburban, or rural area.  Lilly's kosher deli would not be in a heavily populated, busy area.  There aren't many places where a jewish deli can be located.  However, food courts are found in busy places.  Therefore, we know that lilly does not live in a city.  That could mean that she lives in a suburb (a small town with houses spread out), or that she lives in a rural area.<n><n>#### Multiple Choice2<n>Jerusalem and New York have a large number of Jewish people who live in them.  In a city that has a large number of jewish people, there are more kosher eateries.  Therefore, Lilly does not live in either of these towns.<n><n>#### Multiple choice 3<n>Kosher Delis are in heavily populated cities.  There aren' t very many of them in a small town or a rural area.  Lily does not live in a town or in a rural area.  She lives in a heavily populated city that has a large Jewish community, but does not live in the center of the city. She lives outside of the city in a suburb.  That means that her kosher deli has a fairly small number of customers who are Jewish. There is only a small percentage of Jews in the town that she lives in.<n><n>#### Multiplechoice 4<n>Jewish communities have many kosher delis and many Jewish families.  However, that means that Lilly does not live either in a Jewish community or in the town where there is one.  Her deli may be in a town or city that has a small jewish community, but it is not the center of the jewish community.<n><n>### Input and Instruction<n>Input:  You have 144 marbles.

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem involves determining how much money you would receive for recycling cans and newspapers. <n><n>First find out how many sets of 12 cans are in 144 cans. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total number of cans (144) by the number of cans per set (12). <n><n>144 ÷ 12 = 12 sets of cans. <n><n>Each set of can is worth $0.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the cans, multiply the number of sets (12) by the worth of each set ($0.50). <n><n>12 x $0.50 = $6 <n><n>Next, find out how many set of 5 kilograms of newspapers are in 20 kilograms. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total kilograms of newspapers (20) by the number of kilograms per set (5). <n><n>20 ÷ 5 = 4 sets of newspapers. <n><n>Each set of newspaper is worth $1.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the newspapers, multiply the number of sets (4) by the worth of each set ($1.50). <n><n>4 x $1.50 = $6 <n><n>Finally, to find the total money earned, add the worth of the cans and the newspapers together. <n><n>$6 (for cans) + $6 (for newspapers) = $12.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?<n>Rationales: Betty picked 16 strawberries. <n>Then, Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty which makes 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.<n>Therefore, Matthew picked 36 strawberries.<n>We know that Matthew picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. <n>So, Natalie picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries.<n>The total number of strawberries they all picked is 16 (Betty's) + 36 (Matthew's) + 18 (Natalie's) = 70 strawberries.<n>Each jar of jam requires 7 strawberries, so they can make 70 strawberries / 7 strawberries per jar = 10 jars of jam.<n>Each jar of jam is sold for $4, so they made 10 jars * $4 per jar = $40 from the strawberries they picked.<n>Therefore, they made $40 from selling the strawberries they picked.<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:If I wanted to thank someone for saying I have done a good job, what would I do? Choices:  A: smile B: shake hands C: express gratitude D: say you're welcome E: appreciate compliment<n><n>### Response:		Choice: D says you're welcome when someone thanks you because this is a polite response from thanking.<n><n>### Input : I got 3620. How much money am I making per hour?<n><n>### Rationales: We use the rule that you use to solve 3620 = 100 * x and 3620 / 100 = x - To solve for x.<n><n>### Answer: <n><n>### Input. We are given 9,725, one of the three digits is missing in this number. What operation should you perform to replace that missing digit in order to obtain your answer?<n><n><n>### Rationale : <n><n>The number '9,725' contains 3 digits. <n><n>Therefore, we can form 3 digits using the 9,72, 97, 72 and 7. <n><n>In the number '9,7', we can replace the missing digit as '7'.<n><n>### Answer<n>Solution<n><n>### Input<n><n>We have 3 apples, 2 bananas, 4 oranges, 8 pineapples, and 6 strawberries; which fruit has the most calories?<n><n>### Solution<n><n>We need to find out which fruit has the most amount of calories. <n><n>The answer is the fruit with the highest number of calories. 3 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 6 = 25. 25 is the fewest amount of calories we will get. Pineapples have the most amount of calorie with 92.<n><n>### Final Thought:<n>My response will be to answer the question and do the operation that the instruction asks me to do. In a certain set of problems, there would be more than one choice to answer that particular question.

Choices:  A: smile B: singing C: sweat D: act E: dance<n><n>### Response:		Option A: smile<n><n>### Rationales:<n>This is a straightforward application of the condition that can be understood by deaf people, but cannot be done by them. <n><n>There is no requirement that the task must be done silently, or that words must be verbalised. Any of the other choice can be completed by anyone regardless of whether they are deaf or not. Therefore, the only option that cannot be done by someone who is deaf is to express an action through smiling, because they will be required to express the action with muscles in their face and mouth.<n><n>There are many variations to answer this question. I hope I was able to meet your expectations. God bless <n><n>### Input<n>Which of these animals are considered reptiles? Choices: M. Lion B. Dog C. Snake D. Hippopotamus E. Chimpanzee F. Ostrich<n><n>### Response<n>Option A: Lion<n><n>### Rationale:<n>The lion has the attributes of a mammal, as well as a reptile. The term reptile is broader than mammal, and contains many animals that can be considered reptiles, as well as several mammals. I have also listed some of the criteria that animals must attain in order to be considered reptiles.<n><n>1.  Reptiles must have scales on their skin to protect it from friction caused during movement.<n>2. Reptiles lay eggs.<n>3. Their babies are live births.<n><n>The lion has all of the listed criteria. Therefore the chimpanzee would not be a reptile. <n><n>If a dog were to be considered a reptile, it would require a major restructuring of the animal kingdom. <n><n>If the snake were to be considered a mammal, it would also require a major restructure, as the skull and braincase of a reptile is vastly different from that of a mammal. I have found no reptiles that would qualify to be in the same genus as a true mammal.<n><n>If a dog, snake, or mammal were to be considered a bird, it would require them to acquire feathers. Birds do not have feathers on any other body parts other than their wings.

We can do that through remainder.<n><n>So, we take 2555 remainder 16, that makes it 134.125.<n>The number after the first 16 of oz, that will be the number of cans in the next box. Which means, there are 135 box of scrap metal, that are 2090 box. That is 125 can stack in one box.<n>Then.<n>1 box of scrap metal = 2090 cans of scarp metal.<n>So, the number of boxes that scrap metal will fit in is 125.<n><n>The same method works for bottles and cans too.<n>Bottles and cans can be split into two categories: bottles and cans without caps and bottles and cans with caps.<n>138

This can mean farm or city. Choice A is farm since the house or place that John lives in has a farm. This indicates that the environment is calm because a farm is located in a peaceful environment. This is opposite of the luxurious city.<n>2. B: This was my first response. I thought John did not have money thus the environment he lived in was a difficult or even challenging environment. Since he doesn't have money, this would not be a luxurious city. This environment is not calm either.<n>3. C: In response 2 I said that he had money.  When I did have money in mind I thought of a resort. I know this is still a type of city, but the environment is much more calm and luxurious.<n>4. D: From what I knew about John, I knew that I don't think he've chosen a hotel. This would be too expensive for John to afford and he wouldn't want to waste his money.<n>5.

Our bedroom is where we get our cloth's clean.<n><n>#### D: fabric store<n>This is where fabrics, textiles, and other cloth's are stored for the clothing department. There are clothes to be cleaned and dry cleaned in this store. Clean cloth's are not for the buyer so this store is not where the cloths should go.<n><n>#### E: bedroom<n>This is where clothes are stored in a bedroom and where they go. Cleaning is a must in the bedroom. This is where you get a new set of clothes, so it is not where the cloth's should be. It should stay in the bedroom to replace a set of cloths that are dirty.<n><n>#### D is incorrect because it is the clothing department for people to buy cloth's to make clothes.<n><n>#### E is incorrect because it is where we get our set of cloths, which are clean.

It had learned to read.<n>### Note that <n>## Rationale: This answers the prompt by looking at what the situation suggests could be the answer. There is no "right" answer to the question, a possible response could be any of the answers, this is why it is important to consider both the information given in the prompt and the possible responses, because any of those possible responses can be legitimate given the information that was provided. <n><n>### Input:"Mr. Brown picked 16 apples. Mr. Black picked 39 apples more than Mr. Brown, and three more apples than Mrs. Smith.

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem involves determining how much money you would receive for recycling cans and newspapers. <n><n>First find out how many sets of 12 cans are in 144 cans. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total number of cans (144) by the number of cans per set (12). <n><n>144 ÷ 12 = 12 sets of cans. <n><n>Each set of can is worth $0.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the cans, multiply the number of sets (12) by the worth of each set ($0.50). <n><n>12 x $0.50 = $6 <n><n>Next, find out how many set of 5 kilograms of newspapers are in 20 kilograms. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total kilograms of newspapers (20) by the number of kilograms per set (5). <n><n>20 ÷ 5 = 4 sets of newspapers. <n><n>Each set of newspaper is worth $1.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the newspapers, multiply the number of sets (4) by the worth of each set ($1.50). <n><n>4 x $1.50 = $6 <n><n>Finally, to find the total money earned, add the worth of the cans and the newspapers together. <n><n>$6 (for cans) + $6 (for newspapers) = $12.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?<n>Rationales: Betty picked 16 strawberries. <n>Then, Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty which makes 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.<n>Therefore, Matthew picked 36 strawberries.<n>We know that Matthew picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. <n>So, Natalie picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries.<n>The total number of strawberries they all picked is 16 (Betty's) + 36 (Matthew's) + 18 (Natalie's) = 70 strawberries.<n>Each jar of jam requires 7 strawberries, so they can make 70 strawberries / 7 strawberries per jar = 10 jars of jam.<n>Each jar of jam is sold for $4, so they made 10 jars * $4 per jar = $40 from the strawberries they picked.<n>Therefore, they made $40 from selling the strawberries they picked.<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:He was receiving workman's compensation, he had tripped over a metal rod while building where?

Choices:  A: backery B: ham sandwich C: fridge D: butcher shop E: freezer<n><n>### Response:		<n>Demonstration:<n>The question asks where meat lasts a long time. The first thing you should think is of places where meat is sold. Those are butcher shops, backery, and fridge. However, a fridge or the backery do not last a long time. That would mean that the answer is a butcher shop or a freezer.<n><n>Rationales: <n>First you have to think back to the fridge, the ham sandwich and the butcher shop, those would be good options to choose.<n>It does not say that it has to be a lot of time.<n>But it has to be long enough for it to be unedible.<n>If you took it out of the butcher shop after it being there for 22 hours, then it would still be there.<n>But if you take it out of the fridge it will be spoiled, that is enough time for it to be unhealthy.<n><n>Freezer: A freezer works because it is unhealthily cold, therefore bacteria do not grow and meat stays fresh for a long amount of time. But not too long because some people like to eat it after 30 days (https://www.verywellfit.com/expiration-dates-on-food-mean-what-5079580). Meat does last for a while as long as it is not left out at room temperature and has not been opened, (https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/how-long-do-meat-products-last-after-opened-refrigerator-180961007/)<n>Butcher Shop: This is a place where meat can stay fresh because it is at the right temperature and no outside bacteria could touch the food.<n>This type of meat last for a long time.<n>The average person takes meat out of the meat case 4 times.

Choices: A: 50% B: 100% C: 40.8% D: 60% E: 25%<n><n>### Response :The question is asking if from a uniform distribution you are able to get all the answers correct. To do this you must divide your probability that you get the correct answer by the probability that the answer is incorrect and the probability that you correctly guess all 10 questions. To do that you must divide 50% which is the probability of getting all questions correct by the probability that you'll be 100% correct which is the probability of your probability of choosing the correct outcome when a uniform distribution is used = 100%. As the question stated 50% the probability that the distribution of the answer questions come from this uniform distribution should be 100%. But they also stated that it comes from a uniform distribution. A uniform distribution means that there is a probability that the outcome can be any possibility which in this instance would mean there is a probability that you could be 60% correct which is greater than 50%.

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem involves determining how much money you would receive for recycling cans and newspapers. <n><n>First find out how many sets of 12 cans are in 144 cans. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total number of cans (144) by the number of cans per set (12). <n><n>144 ÷ 12 = 12 sets of cans. <n><n>Each set of can is worth $0.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the cans, multiply the number of sets (12) by the worth of each set ($0.50). <n><n>12 x $0.50 = $6 <n><n>Next, find out how many set of 5 kilograms of newspapers are in 20 kilograms. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total kilograms of newspapers (20) by the number of kilograms per set (5). <n><n>20 ÷ 5 = 4 sets of newspapers. <n><n>Each set of newspaper is worth $1.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the newspapers, multiply the number of sets (4) by the worth of each set ($1.50). <n><n>4 x $1.50 = $6 <n><n>Finally, to find the total money earned, add the worth of the cans and the newspapers together. <n><n>$6 (for cans) + $6 (for newspapers) = $12.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?<n>Rationales: Betty picked 16 strawberries. <n>Then, Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty which makes 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.<n>Therefore, Matthew picked 36 strawberries.<n>We know that Matthew picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. <n>So, Natalie picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries.<n>The total number of strawberries they all picked is 16 (Betty's) + 36 (Matthew's) + 18 (Natalie's) = 70 strawberries.<n>Each jar of jam requires 7 strawberries, so they can make 70 strawberries / 7 strawberries per jar = 10 jars of jam.<n>Each jar of jam is sold for $4, so they made 10 jars * $4 per jar = $40 from the strawberries they picked.<n>Therefore, they made $40 from selling the strawberries they picked.<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:Eating breakfast in bed can make you feel what, assuming that you don't spill anything? Choices:  A: vomiting B: pleasure C: happiness D: contentment E: mess<n><n>### Response:		<n>I think the correct answer is B: pleasure. <n><n>### Input :Which is better: a big house in the heart of a city or a small house in the country?<n><n>### Demostration:<n>Rationales: To get "a big house in the heart" is better than "a small house in the country" means that the city is better than the countryside. <n><n>This statement follows from the fact that "the heart" usually refers to the most busy and crowded part of a city (not the countryside, which is usually referred to as the "sticks" or simply "the suburbs").<n><n>So, living in the heart of a big city is better than living in the countryside because the city includes everything a person could ask for like jobs, schools, food, services, etc., whereas a "small house in the country" doesn't have that.<n><n>Answer: B. B<n><n>### Input The average of 13 students' GPAs is 78. The average of 22 students' GPAs is also 78. Which statement is most similar to the situation just described? Choices: A: The average of 26 students' GPA is 78. <n><n>## Demostration:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n><n>## Demostrating:<n>Rationales:"The average of 22 student’s GPA is also 78" does not apply since there are no more than 22 (13 + 22 = 35, which > 22). <n><n>On the other hand, "The average of 26 student’s GPA...", since "26" is not greater than "22", the result must be > 78 ("78" is not a possible result of the calculation given). <n><n>"The average of 13 student’s GPA..." does not apply since there aren't too many students as 22 (11 students in 13). <n><n>"A: The average of 16 students GPA is also 13.14. <n><n>GPA: 78 is divisible by 22 =13, therefore the quotient is 4.5, which means two decimal places to the right of the decimal

Choices:  A: go to jail B: incarceration C: intercourse D: death E: judgement<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>[B: incarceration] is the best description of how much weight the judge gave to the man's crime. <n>[A: go to jail] and [C: intercourse]  are both a form of punishment, but they are not <n>directly related to the man's guilt or innocence as they describe where the man will go after he is found guilty, <n>so they do not describe how much weight the judge is giving to the man's sentence.<n><n>[D: death] is describing how the man will end his time on earth and it does not have anything to do with whether the man is guilty or not. [E: judgement] has to do with the sentence being the <n>decision by the judge, so it is not an appropriate description, and [E: judgements] is plural which is also wrong. <n><n>### Instructions:The word "weigh" does not mean the same thing as the word "weight." Weigh is a verb (noun: weighing). For example: He weighs 150 pounds. Weight is a noun (noun: weight) and can be used as either verb: He is putting some weight on the scale.<n>Or adjective: It's a heavy weight.<n><n>### Rationales:The answer key says [A: go to jay] is the answer however I think this is not an accurate representation of the meaning of the sentence.

Explain if you agree or disagree with this statement. Why? Be specific"<n>### Response:<n>Science and faith are very opposite. Science is based on logic and evidence whereas faith is based on one's belief. Science cannot be based on faith alone because science deals with evidence and proof. If only science dealt with faith it wouldn't be science anymore. Science is based on a lot of evidence and when faith comes into play it gets more complicated. Faith goes through a lot of doubts whereas science is very certain. Science is the only truth which cannot be doubted while faith is only a set of beliefs. For science to be based on faith it needs to not be science anymore. Science will require all your faith in it in order for it to work. For me I cannot have faith in something because I will have no proof and I always want proof. If I'm going to study a subject it is because I need proof or evidence.<n><n>### Rationale Be specific:<n><n>### Instrucctions: Write the correct answer to the following question.<n><n>## Rationales:<n><n>## Instructions: Choices:  a) 1.10- 43<n>## Explanation:<n>Rationales: 28.

Choices:  A: contagious B: wrong C: last forever D: painful E: blind<n><n>### Response:		E<n><n>### Answer:E<n><n>## Rationale:<n>A) Love could be contagious - you can catch it, like the flu - but it is not. We are all able to chose who we love. We're able to know them and love them, and if your heart isn't in the right place, or they're just not the person for you, you could never catch them. For example, you could never catch your best guy friend.<n><n>B) Wrong? Love cannot happen if no one is in love. Is love unnatural? I think not.<n><n>C) Love cannot last forever - It's not practical. We will come and go, as we change jobs, homes, and more. Our hearts never stop, but eventually they will find love again. The same way you could never hold onto your very first puppy, to keep it as your pet for your entire life, you can't keep your first love for life. Love is always changing. (and I'm pretty sure animals don't 'last forever' either, unless you can't get a decent dog from an animal shelter anywhere in America - I'm not talking about the dogs you see when you first visit or take your parents to, because they likely won't be your forever dog. I mean, my brother had 2 dogs in his life, until they went to dog prisons when he couldn't afford to pay anymore).<n><n>D) Painful? We don't see love that may bring pain, if the individual doesn't care. The person must understand the pain could be caused by their love or choice. Love must be there, to do any harm.<n><n>E) Blind? Love is blind, right? We make poor decisions for love, we don't always have our eyes wide open. We don't have all the facts, we don't understand every decision the other person makes, or has made in their life so far. We love so strongly, that the heart can sometimes make up its own facts, and go forward, and make up for others faults.<n><n>### Input and answer the following two- part question by selecting the letters.<n><n>Which letter represents the answer that goes with each choice?<n><n>1.

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem involves determining how much money you would receive for recycling cans and newspapers. <n><n>First find out how many sets of 12 cans are in 144 cans. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total number of cans (144) by the number of cans per set (12). <n><n>144 ÷ 12 = 12 sets of cans. <n><n>Each set of can is worth $0.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the cans, multiply the number of sets (12) by the worth of each set ($0.50). <n><n>12 x $0.50 = $6 <n><n>Next, find out how many set of 5 kilograms of newspapers are in 20 kilograms. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total kilograms of newspapers (20) by the number of kilograms per set (5). <n><n>20 ÷ 5 = 4 sets of newspapers. <n><n>Each set of newspaper is worth $1.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the newspapers, multiply the number of sets (4) by the worth of each set ($1.50). <n><n>4 x $1.50 = $6 <n><n>Finally, to find the total money earned, add the worth of the cans and the newspapers together. <n><n>$6 (for cans) + $6 (for newspapers) = $12.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?<n>Rationales: Betty picked 16 strawberries. <n>Then, Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty which makes 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.<n>Therefore, Matthew picked 36 strawberries.<n>We know that Matthew picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. <n>So, Natalie picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries.<n>The total number of strawberries they all picked is 16 (Betty's) + 36 (Matthew's) + 18 (Natalie's) = 70 strawberries.<n>Each jar of jam requires 7 strawberries, so they can make 70 strawberries / 7 strawberries per jar = 10 jars of jam.<n>Each jar of jam is sold for $4, so they made 10 jars * $4 per jar = $40 from the strawberries they picked.<n>Therefore, they made $40 from selling the strawberries they picked.<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:The delivery man was delivering a whole crate of shampoo, they went through a lot of it at the what?

Therefore, the delivery man was delivering shampoo to "a" supermarket. <n><n>### B: motel<n><n>Motel is like a hotel. However, motel has fewer services offered. Motels only provide places to sleep. Motels don't have restaurants or shops.<n><n>### C: at hotel<n><n>"at" means there is a hotel not far. The correct answer is not "at motel" but rather "at hotel". <n><n>### D: shampooo bottle<n><n>Shampooo bottle is a container used for storing shampoo.<n><n>### E: hair salon:<n><n>Hair salons provide services to the hair industry.

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem involves determining how much money you would receive for recycling cans and newspapers. <n><n>First find out how many sets of 12 cans are in 144 cans. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total number of cans (144) by the number of cans per set (12). <n><n>144 ÷ 12 = 12 sets of cans. <n><n>Each set of can is worth $0.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the cans, multiply the number of sets (12) by the worth of each set ($0.50). <n><n>12 x $0.50 = $6 <n><n>Next, find out how many set of 5 kilograms of newspapers are in 20 kilograms. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total kilograms of newspapers (20) by the number of kilograms per set (5). <n><n>20 ÷ 5 = 4 sets of newspapers. <n><n>Each set of newspaper is worth $1.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the newspapers, multiply the number of sets (4) by the worth of each set ($1.50). <n><n>4 x $1.50 = $6 <n><n>Finally, to find the total money earned, add the worth of the cans and the newspapers together. <n><n>$6 (for cans) + $6 (for newspapers) = $12.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?<n>Rationales: Betty picked 16 strawberries. <n>Then, Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty which makes 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.<n>Therefore, Matthew picked 36 strawberries.<n>We know that Matthew picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. <n>So, Natalie picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries.<n>The total number of strawberries they all picked is 16 (Betty's) + 36 (Matthew's) + 18 (Natalie's) = 70 strawberries.<n>Each jar of jam requires 7 strawberries, so they can make 70 strawberries / 7 strawberries per jar = 10 jars of jam.<n>Each jar of jam is sold for $4, so they made 10 jars * $4 per jar = $40 from the strawberries they picked.<n>Therefore, they made $40 from selling the strawberries they picked.<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:Where is a ferret getting lots of attention likely to be found?

Choices:  A: complications B: tiredness C: anger D: trial E: court case<n><n>### Response:		<n>* B<n><n>### Input:: <n>Gordon is trying to make 3,645,600 for a video game store, but will only accept checks from his account at The Big Bank. 487.59 of his account remains, but The Big Bank does not charge overdraft fees for less than 5,063, because they are still too busy to give him a good rate. If he deposits $3,000 into his account right away, he does not qualify for overdraft protection because he has 487.64 more remaining after deposit. <n><n>To save 5,065 over two weeks, Gordon must take out at least $9,756, he must take out no more than 1,352, and his payment must be 4,050. How much money does Gordon have to borrow? <n><n>### Rationales:<n><n>First, Gordon wants to save money for his vacation to Italy. He wants to make 3900,000 for his vacation in 5 months. <n><n>1723 months x $39000000=970,954,00<n><n>Next, Gordon is going to put $3000 in his bank account today because he will need the money. <n><n>The first problem in the question is to find out how much money Gordon needs to save for his vacation. <n><n>To find this out, Gordon needs to divide $4050 which is the amount of pay for every two weeks by $3900, which is the amount of money he needs for every two weeks to pay the $4050. <n>The result is $4050/3900=3900<n><n>Therefore, the amount of money Gordon needs for every two weeks is $3900. <n><n>The next problem to solve is to find out how many months it will take<n><n>To find this answer,<n><n>$3900 / 5 = $780<n><n>Since Gordon is going to put in $3,00,00, we need to subtract $3000 from $3900 and get $3600.<n><n>The last problem to solve is how

How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?<n>Rationales: Betty picked 16 strawberries. <n>Then, Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty which makes 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.<n>Therefore, Matthew picked 36 strawberries.<n>We know that Matthew picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. <n>So, Natalie picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries.<n>The total number of strawberries they all picked is 16 (Betty's) + 36 (Matthew's) + 18 (Natalie's) = 70 strawberries.<n>Each jar of jam requires 7 strawberries, so they can make 70 strawberries / 7 strawberries per jar = 10 jars of jam.<n>Each jar of jam is sold for $4, so they made 10 jars * $4 per jar = $40 from the strawberries they picked.<n>Therefore, they made $40 from selling the strawberries they picked.<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:The woman experienced great joy, but despite that this was a what? Choices:  A: misery B: sadness C: bad time D: sorrow E: play time<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The correct answer is B. This is the only answer that matches the phrase 'but DESPITE that this was a'. The other choices begin with sadness or something that makes someone sad or something that may bring sadness to the woman. The phrase "but despite that this was a" already states it as a happy time so the next phrase "what is a misery" does not make sense in the context.  <n><n><n><n><n><n>![alt text](https://res.cloudinary.com/sandiegocodecamp/image/upload/e240c5ef_0.png)

If your family recycled 75 gallons of cans and 116 pounds of dirty newspapers, how much did you make?<n><n>### Demostration:<n>If the number of gallons (75) is divided by 1 gallon, 75 gallons is equal to 75 gallons. If the number of pounds (116 of dirty newspapers is divided by 5, it equals 23.2 gallons of recycling cans. Finally, the number of dirty gallons (23.2) plus the non dirty gallons of recycled cans(5) equals the final answer: 28.2 gallons. <n>Let’s find out the values. For every 1 gallons you recycle, you earn $0.50 (which means if you recycle 75 gallons, if you multiply, you’ll get $37.5). For every 5 pounds of news papers you recycle, earn between $3.0 and $5. (for instance, if the news papers are dirty it will cost $5.0, if they’re clean they’ll cost$3.0). The family recycled 116 pounds or 58 gallons of news papers. (The news papers cost $5.8 and $3.9).

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem involves determining how much money you would receive for recycling cans and newspapers. <n><n>First find out how many sets of 12 cans are in 144 cans. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total number of cans (144) by the number of cans per set (12). <n><n>144 ÷ 12 = 12 sets of cans. <n><n>Each set of can is worth $0.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the cans, multiply the number of sets (12) by the worth of each set ($0.50). <n><n>12 x $0.50 = $6 <n><n>Next, find out how many set of 5 kilograms of newspapers are in 20 kilograms. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total kilograms of newspapers (20) by the number of kilograms per set (5). <n><n>20 ÷ 5 = 4 sets of newspapers. <n><n>Each set of newspaper is worth $1.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the newspapers, multiply the number of sets (4) by the worth of each set ($1.50). <n><n>4 x $1.50 = $6 <n><n>Finally, to find the total money earned, add the worth of the cans and the newspapers together. <n><n>$6 (for cans) + $6 (for newspapers) = $12.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?<n>Rationales: Betty picked 16 strawberries. <n>Then, Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty which makes 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.<n>Therefore, Matthew picked 36 strawberries.<n>We know that Matthew picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. <n>So, Natalie picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries.<n>The total number of strawberries they all picked is 16 (Betty's) + 36 (Matthew's) + 18 (Natalie's) = 70 strawberries.<n>Each jar of jam requires 7 strawberries, so they can make 70 strawberries / 7 strawberries per jar = 10 jars of jam.<n>Each jar of jam is sold for $4, so they made 10 jars * $4 per jar = $40 from the strawberries they picked.<n>Therefore, they made $40 from selling the strawberries they picked.<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:If I take my heifer out East, where's a place we might end up?

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem involves determining how much money you would receive for recycling cans and newspapers. <n><n>First find out how many sets of 12 cans are in 144 cans. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total number of cans (144) by the number of cans per set (12). <n><n>144 ÷ 12 = 12 sets of cans. <n><n>Each set of can is worth $0.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the cans, multiply the number of sets (12) by the worth of each set ($0.50). <n><n>12 x $0.50 = $6 <n><n>Next, find out how many set of 5 kilograms of newspapers are in 20 kilograms. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total kilograms of newspapers (20) by the number of kilograms per set (5). <n><n>20 ÷ 5 = 4 sets of newspapers. <n><n>Each set of newspaper is worth $1.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the newspapers, multiply the number of sets (4) by the worth of each set ($1.50). <n><n>4 x $1.50 = $6 <n><n>Finally, to find the total money earned, add the worth of the cans and the newspapers together. <n><n>$6 (for cans) + $6 (for newspapers) = $12.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?<n>Rationales: Betty picked 16 strawberries. <n>Then, Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty which makes 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.<n>Therefore, Matthew picked 36 strawberries.<n>We know that Matthew picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. <n>So, Natalie picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries.<n>The total number of strawberries they all picked is 16 (Betty's) + 36 (Matthew's) + 18 (Natalie's) = 70 strawberries.<n>Each jar of jam requires 7 strawberries, so they can make 70 strawberries / 7 strawberries per jar = 10 jars of jam.<n>Each jar of jam is sold for $4, so they made 10 jars * $4 per jar = $40 from the strawberries they picked.<n>Therefore, they made $40 from selling the strawberries they picked.<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:Where would a human expect to find manufacturing operations?

How much money is this?<n><n>Rationales: Total money collected by the coins are 43 cents.<n>We can write this as $0.43.<n>How much of this is nickels?<n>So, you can determine how much is nickels as $0.15. <n>How much of this total is pennies?<n>So, you are left with $0.28. <n>Ans : $0.28<n><n><n>### Demo<n><n>Input: There were 79 pounds of potato chips and 50 pounds of cheese in the store. They made 100 bags of potato chips, and 5 bags of cheese. They had 10 bags that didn’t sell. They made $25 total from selling the potato chips and bags of baked goods. How much money did they lose by making 50 pounds of baked goods (1 bag of cheese)?<n><n>Rationales : The problem involves finding the difference in the total cost of making an item and its selling price.<n>The first step is figuring out what the total cost of making all of the items is, then finding what each cost individually, and finally finding the price of what was not sold and the total money they made.<n>There was 79 pounds x $X = 79 pounds of Potato chips (Total cost)<n>There was 50 pounds x $X = $50 pounds of cheesy beans (Total cost)<n>They made 100 potato chips bags (Cost for one bag = $25) = $2500<n>They had 50 pounds $2500/50 = $500 of baked goods (Cost of one bag = $125)<n>So, total cost = $3,750<n>Total sold = $250 (5 bags X $50)<n>Total cost - Total sold = $3,725 - $250 = $3,475<n>5 b

The first letter is "A" for living room. Then, it should be "B" for the animal shelter. Next question should be "C" because the choices only have alphabet "A" - "E" so "G" is the answer for georgia. The best place to get a small dog is in a dog shelter.<n><n>Rationales: In the question, you can go to the living room to get a small dog because only people is there. If you go to the animal shelter, you can only get a stray small animal. Therefore, the answer is A.<n><n>If you are going to get a small dog in a pet shop then you must have money with you. Therefore, the answer for D is pet shop.<n><n>If you're going to get a small animal from a dog show, the show must be for dogs only then the next choice is E.<n><n>When it comes to getting a small animal from Georgia, the animal must be from Georgia. There could be two options. Either it is from Georgia or it should be in Georgia. The last choice is D because you can only get an animal from Georgia not from Pet shop.<n><n>The best place to get a stray small animals is in a dog shelter because it will be cheaper.<n><n>### Input :Rachel and her friends have been arguing over which superhero is better, Batman or Spiderman. The debate begins when Rachel says that her favorite superhero is Spiderman. Her friends, however, do not think so.

Choices:  A: order B: queueing up C: wait turn D: fatigue E: anger<n><n>### Response:		A: order<n><n>### Rationale:The problem describes a line where the line is not moving. The adjective "fatigue" means tiredness. The adjective "wait turn" means to endure something difficult. The adjective "anger" means resentful or bad feeling. The noun "queueing up" and the noun "queue" mean a line waiting to enter a store or place of business; "to queue up" means to line up as in "to queue up for dinner." The answer is "A" (order). Explanation: The line is not moving which means that there is a line but it is not moving. This happens because of congestion. Therefore, the adjective "order" would make more sense here because it implies that the line is disorderly. Another valid response would be "B" (queueing up) because "to queue up" has the same meaning as "to line up" (as people in a queue typically do).<n><n>### Input:"There was a long line of cars waiting to get gas."<n><n>### Input2: "After spending 45 minutes in the hospital waiting room, I decided to queue up."<n><n>### Rationales:In the first sentence, the problem describes a long line of cars, which is also known as a queue. <n>The noun "queue" means a line waiting to enter. To queue means to line up. In the second sentence, the problem describes something called "to queue up." To queue up means to line up. Explanation: "There was a long line..." - In this sentence, the noun "line" means a line of people or things that stretch lengthwise along or along part of a surface. "To queue up" - In this sentence, "to queue up" is the answer. To queue is a verb form of "to queue up."<n><n><n>### Input3:If there are 16 cars in a line, how many should be in a queue?<n><n>### Input4:How many items should be in a queue if there are 12 people in a line?<n><n>### Response:"A queue should always be longer than the line."<n><n>### Response2:"A queue should always contain 12 or fewer items."<n><n><n>## Task 5:<n>Rewrite the following sentence so that it is complete using a relative pron

If there is not much dirt, then it can be stored in the fingernails. If there will be a lot of dirt, then it should be stored in the garden. <n><n>Rationales: If there is not a lot of dirt stored, then it can be put in the fingernail. If there is not a choice, then it it can be stored in a closet.<n>If there is a lot of dirt and there is no choice, then there may be a garden. If there is, it can be stored in it. If there isn't, then it should be kept in a corner. If there is a computer, then the dirt can be stored on the corner.

The boy rolls the dice first and the girl rolls the dice second. How do the children go to the next turn?"<n><n>### Demostration:"The boy rolls first, therefore if he wins first, he gets a dice. The girl then gets a dice based on his move. Each move of the boys determines the number of dice and each move he needs has three moves. So the girl only moves 2 times in the game, while the boy moves 4 times. If the girl wins, she gets one step in front of the boy and the boy gets one step behind the girl. The children then take turns until someone wins"<n><n>### Response:"First, both the children take turns. Therefore the boy throws first. Since the girl has to win in 3 turn, she throws 3 times. Therefore, the girl has to move for three times and the boys move once. Since the boy has to move in two moves in half, the boy moves in two moves. So the girl is left with one move. Therefore the girl takes a move and the game is passed on to the boy. It is the last move for the boy who takes another move and therefore the game is passed. Both the boy and girl take three moves and the boy wins the game in two moves

Choices:  A: charming B: space shuttle C: house D: train station E: surface of earth<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>    A<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>### Rationales:<n>There are four places in which humans breath air and then pass it on. They are: the surface of the earth, the house, the charming place, and the space shuttle. This is because a house is made up of many rooms, each room is occupied. When a person enters a room and leaves, the air in that room is replaced. This is also the case with a household, and when everyone is home at once, there are many people occupying the rooms all at once, and this makes for many people breathing and passing on the air.<n><n>This is the reason why one person can inhale a large quantity of air from another person, for example at a house. Likewise for the surface, where many people occupy the space and also breathe, and exchange the air. Lastly, the charming place in the same way. But not only houses, but also the places where people congregate often is where we find the same thing happening. For example, many people stand and/or sit on the train, and each time the entrance is opened and people enter the compartment, the air is replaced with new air. This is the result because of the large number of people, so that the air inside the train is replaced each time the door is opened, and it is possible that the air is changed a thousand times.<n><n>### Input<n>Give five reasons why people can't live on Mars forever.<BR><n><n>### Response<n><BR><n><n>Rationales:<n><n>People really can't live forever on Mars because:<BR><n></div><n>     <div style="background-color: lightyellow"><n>    1.

The answer could be $0 or $12 (for buying 3 boxes) as long as at least 3 boxes are purchased.$6 can be spent on 2.5 boxes, or $2.5 each for 2.5 boxes. This solution should be rejected if $6 cannot buy at least 3.5 boxes because the other boxes should have been purchased in order to have a reasonable amount of pop tarts. 7 boxes of pop tarts for a total of $18 cannot be purchased because $6 would not be enough to purchase 3 boxes. To arrive at 7, we have to multiply by 3/2 because 3 boxes would have to be purchased in order to have 7.<n><n>Input: How much money did it cost to rent a car?<n><n>Rationales: One reason why an answer was chosen is because it has the smallest value out of the choices. One box has enough pop tarts for a reasonable amount, so that answer was picked. <n><n><n>

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem involves determining how much money you would receive for recycling cans and newspapers. <n><n>First find out how many sets of 12 cans are in 144 cans. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total number of cans (144) by the number of cans per set (12). <n><n>144 ÷ 12 = 12 sets of cans. <n><n>Each set of can is worth $0.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the cans, multiply the number of sets (12) by the worth of each set ($0.50). <n><n>12 x $0.50 = $6 <n><n>Next, find out how many set of 5 kilograms of newspapers are in 20 kilograms. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total kilograms of newspapers (20) by the number of kilograms per set (5). <n><n>20 ÷ 5 = 4 sets of newspapers. <n><n>Each set of newspaper is worth $1.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the newspapers, multiply the number of sets (4) by the worth of each set ($1.50). <n><n>4 x $1.50 = $6 <n><n>Finally, to find the total money earned, add the worth of the cans and the newspapers together. <n><n>$6 (for cans) + $6 (for newspapers) = $12.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?<n>Rationales: Betty picked 16 strawberries. <n>Then, Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty which makes 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.<n>Therefore, Matthew picked 36 strawberries.<n>We know that Matthew picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. <n>So, Natalie picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries.<n>The total number of strawberries they all picked is 16 (Betty's) + 36 (Matthew's) + 18 (Natalie's) = 70 strawberries.<n>Each jar of jam requires 7 strawberries, so they can make 70 strawberries / 7 strawberries per jar = 10 jars of jam.<n>Each jar of jam is sold for $4, so they made 10 jars * $4 per jar = $40 from the strawberries they picked.<n>Therefore, they made $40 from selling the strawberries they picked.<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:The competition was to see who would be the last one the drop the object, the hard part was you had to have your arm extended straight out while what the object?

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem involves determining how much money you would receive for recycling cans and newspapers. <n><n>First find out how many sets of 12 cans are in 144 cans. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total number of cans (144) by the number of cans per set (12). <n><n>144 ÷ 12 = 12 sets of cans. <n><n>Each set of can is worth $0.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the cans, multiply the number of sets (12) by the worth of each set ($0.50). <n><n>12 x $0.50 = $6 <n><n>Next, find out how many set of 5 kilograms of newspapers are in 20 kilograms. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total kilograms of newspapers (20) by the number of kilograms per set (5). <n><n>20 ÷ 5 = 4 sets of newspapers. <n><n>Each set of newspaper is worth $1.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the newspapers, multiply the number of sets (4) by the worth of each set ($1.50). <n><n>4 x $1.50 = $6 <n><n>Finally, to find the total money earned, add the worth of the cans and the newspapers together. <n><n>$6 (for cans) + $6 (for newspapers) = $12.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?<n>Rationales: Betty picked 16 strawberries. <n>Then, Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty which makes 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.<n>Therefore, Matthew picked 36 strawberries.<n>We know that Matthew picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. <n>So, Natalie picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries.<n>The total number of strawberries they all picked is 16 (Betty's) + 36 (Matthew's) + 18 (Natalie's) = 70 strawberries.<n>Each jar of jam requires 7 strawberries, so they can make 70 strawberries / 7 strawberries per jar = 10 jars of jam.<n>Each jar of jam is sold for $4, so they made 10 jars * $4 per jar = $40 from the strawberries they picked.<n>Therefore, they made $40 from selling the strawberries they picked.<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:How do you indicate that you agree wtih someone?

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: For every 12 cans you recycle, you receive $0.50, and for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, you receive $1.50. If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem involves determining how much money you would receive for recycling cans and newspapers. <n><n>First find out how many sets of 12 cans are in 144 cans. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total number of cans (144) by the number of cans per set (12). <n><n>144 ÷ 12 = 12 sets of cans. <n><n>Each set of can is worth $0.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the cans, multiply the number of sets (12) by the worth of each set ($0.50). <n><n>12 x $0.50 = $6 <n><n>Next, find out how many set of 5 kilograms of newspapers are in 20 kilograms. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total kilograms of newspapers (20) by the number of kilograms per set (5). <n><n>20 ÷ 5 = 4 sets of newspapers. <n><n>Each set of newspaper is worth $1.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the newspapers, multiply the number of sets (4) by the worth of each set ($1.50). <n><n>4 x $1.50 = $6 <n><n>Finally, to find the total money earned, add the worth of the cans and the newspapers together. <n><n>$6 (for cans) + $6 (for newspapers) = $12.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?<n>Rationales: Betty picked 16 strawberries. <n>Then, Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty which makes 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.<n>Therefore, Matthew picked 36 strawberries.<n>We know that Matthew picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. <n>So, Natalie picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries.<n>The total number of strawberries they all picked is 16 (Betty's) + 36 (Matthew's) + 18 (Natalie's) = 70 strawberries.<n>Each jar of jam requires 7 strawberries, so they can make 70 strawberries / 7 strawberries per jar = 10 jars of jam.<n>Each jar of jam is sold for $4, so they made 10 jars * $4 per jar = $40 from the strawberries they picked.<n>Therefore, they made $40 from selling the strawberries they picked.<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:Where would you expect to find a pizzeria while shopping? Choices:  A: chicago B: street C: little italy D: food court E: capital cities<n><n>### Response:		F: Little Italy<n>### Rationales:You would expect to find a pizza restaurant in Chicago, Illinois or in a suburb of Chicago. I say this based on the following: the capital city of the state of Illinois is <n>Chicago. Chicago is nicknamed Chicago, the Windy City, and the Second City. It is also called the City of Big Shoulders and the City That Works.<n>The pizza restaurant is in the city of Chicago and not in the Illinois countryside or suburbs.<n>Also, a street of Little Italy in Chicago can be found in the city.<n><n>### Input 2:What is the maximum value of n when 78 + 27n = n2 - 4?<n><n>### Response 2:n is the maximum value of 5<n><n>### Comments:In the given equation 78 is in the numerator and -4 in the denominator. Now, we need to distribute -4 to the numerator. <n><n>The easiest way to do that is by adding 36 to 78 as follows:<n><n>78 + 29 = 107 <n><n><n>107 - 4 is equivalent to 103, which has no square root. So in other words, the maximum value of n will be the smallest number whose square root is positive such as 34 which is the square root of 1212. <n><n>### Demographics:The number of people who are over the age of 65 and those who have a college degree will continue to rise. How would this affect the economy?<n>### Comments on Demographics:Seniors often need an increased level of care for their health. As a result, the United States will create more jobs for seniors in the health industry in the future. It will also see a decrease in jobs in agriculture, manufacturing industries, and public schools. College degree holders are likely to work in professions that require extensive knowledge. <n><n>## Input: What would be the best strategy for increasing your wealth?

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem involves determining how much money you would receive for recycling cans and newspapers. <n><n>First find out how many sets of 12 cans are in 144 cans. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total number of cans (144) by the number of cans per set (12). <n><n>144 ÷ 12 = 12 sets of cans. <n><n>Each set of can is worth $0.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the cans, multiply the number of sets (12) by the worth of each set ($0.50). <n><n>12 x $0.50 = $6 <n><n>Next, find out how many set of 5 kilograms of newspapers are in 20 kilograms. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total kilograms of newspapers (20) by the number of kilograms per set (5). <n><n>20 ÷ 5 = 4 sets of newspapers. <n><n>Each set of newspaper is worth $1.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the newspapers, multiply the number of sets (4) by the worth of each set ($1.50). <n><n>4 x $1.50 = $6 <n><n>Finally, to find the total money earned, add the worth of the cans and the newspapers together. <n><n>$6 (for cans) + $6 (for newspapers) = $12.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?<n>Rationales: Betty picked 16 strawberries. <n>Then, Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty which makes 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.<n>Therefore, Matthew picked 36 strawberries.<n>We know that Matthew picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. <n>So, Natalie picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries.<n>The total number of strawberries they all picked is 16 (Betty's) + 36 (Matthew's) + 18 (Natalie's) = 70 strawberries.<n>Each jar of jam requires 7 strawberries, so they can make 70 strawberries / 7 strawberries per jar = 10 jars of jam.<n>Each jar of jam is sold for $4, so they made 10 jars * $4 per jar = $40 from the strawberries they picked.<n>Therefore, they made $40 from selling the strawberries they picked.<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:A fox was thirsty searching for water during the drought, where was he? Choices:  A: painting B: hen house C: california D: virginia E: movie hall<n><n>### Response:		The fox is in California looking for water. The word was refers to a noun that means any creature of the animal kingdom, including people. The word was is referring to an indirect object:the object is the water or it. The preposition that can mean in this situation would be in. Califorina has no movie hall and it does have a hen house.<n><n>##Instructions: Write a complete sentence.<n><n>### Input:'Dad! Get me some water!'<n><n>### Rationales.<n><n>The sentence says dad get me some water. The first part of the question is who. There is only one person who is dad. Therefore, the sentence is talking about dad. The next part of the sentence is who is getting water. The only object doing the activity is me. Therefore, me is the object that is getting water, or it.<n>The verb form here is get me some water because in this case the object is getting something.<n><n>If the sentence was get me some water, the subject doing the verb form is me, not dad.<n><n>##Input: 2 plus 2 equals?<n><n>##Rationales:<n>The question said "2 plus 2 equals" and 2 plus 2 is 4.<n><n>2 is the subject of the equation. Therefore 2 is plus 2.<n><n>2 is being plusd with 2.<n><n>4 is the answer when you combine the two integers together.<n><n>##Input:'If you take the subway to and back from work, it will shorten your commute. '<n><n>##Rational:The first part of the sentence says "if you take the subway...". The word "if" means if you were to do it. Therefore it means the same as would.<n><n>##Answers: The word takes means to do something. In this case, it means that you take the subway. Therefore, the subject of the sentence is taking. After the verb form "takes" is the thing that is being done. It is to subway to and back. You take the subway to get to your work and to take you back home. Each "to" is a preposition, a little word that has a specific job. A preposition has a noun as an indirect object and it requires a gerund as an indirect object.<n><n>A gerund is a verb form

(For $1) 13 + 6 = 19<n><n><n>### Demands:<n>10 years from now:<n><n>What is $20?<n><n>How many years from now are 10 years?<n>What is $250?<n><n>What years away are 20 years?<n><n>11 years from now:<n>What is $1.5?<n><n>What is $5.5?<n><n>How long ago is 2.8 years?<n><n><n>### Rationales: The instructions state that you recycled 15 containers per month for the past 6 months.

But in a way I think I could probably say that fun or joyful might not sound very important for me, although fun and joyful can co-exist at the same time. For example, fun and joyful can both be involved if you are learning how cooking is involved, but then again I would have fun because I am learning new things while cooking.<n><n>### Input1:I used to think that, by learning my ABC's, I would be smarter so that it would help me become more successful.

Please read and follow the below instructions:<n><n>Dear Customer Service Operators, <n><n>Between 1997 and 2009, the United States added over 14 million new homes for a total of 132 million homes. This growth rate of 25 percent in 12 years is very fast when you compare it to the other industrialized countries, where the housing growth rate during the same period was around 15%, but this number is far from the growth rate of China! China, in the opposite way, grew at a rate close to twenty-five percent per year. <n><n>Now, let's say that the average home price in 2009 is $252,000, which is the median price home value of $222,000 in 1997 inflation adjusted to 2009 dollars. Considering these two numbers, we can conclude that the average price per square foot of a home in 1990 was $237,000 and the average price per square feet in 2007 was $930,000. <n><n>Now that we have the data we need, we'll use them to provide advice.

Recursion is the procedure of defining a function in terms of itself. For example the factorial function can be defined, like any function, by choosing an object and a procedure for determining the value of the object given the value of the object, this latter object, and the operation chosen to determine the value of the object from the value of an object and the operation chosen to obtain that object's value from the object's value, and so on and so forth. One method for doing this is to let f(x) be the object (that was previously defined by the chosen procedure) and f(x) the result of the procedure.<n><n>### For Every Input, there is an Output<n><n>What each number in the language does (for every number there is an output)<n><n>Number: input<n><n>### If, Else<n><n>If and Else are a programming language statement used to specify conditions or branches<n><n>If (then):<n><n>If a variable is true, this part of the code is executed<n><n>Else:<n><n>If the variable is false, this part of the will be entered into the code instead of the "then" portion<n><n>### Math Example<n><n>```<n>if(a < b)<n>	if (a+b > c)<n>  	  p= a+b;<n>else<n>	p=a-b;<n>```<n><n>### Examples of Math/Calculus Problems using If/Else<n><n>```<n>3+4<n>```<n><n>## Code<n><n>### Exercise: Functions<n><n>#### Write a function called sum that takes two numbers and adds them.<n><n>    function sum(x, y){<n>        return number is sum;<n>    }<n><n><n>#### Write a recursive function called triple that takes any number as an input and returns the triple of that number.

How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?<n>Rationales: Betty picked 16 strawberries. <n>Then, Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty which makes 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.<n>Therefore, Matthew picked 36 strawberries.<n>We know that Matthew picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. <n>So, Natalie picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries.<n>The total number of strawberries they all picked is 16 (Betty's) + 36 (Matthew's) + 18 (Natalie's) = 70 strawberries.<n>Each jar of jam requires 7 strawberries, so they can make 70 strawberries / 7 strawberries per jar = 10 jars of jam.<n>Each jar of jam is sold for $4, so they made 10 jars * $4 per jar = $40 from the strawberries they picked.<n>Therefore, they made $40 from selling the strawberries they picked.<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:A common saying, Sam thought, was to go forth, also this. Choices:  A: reverse B: backwards C: back and D: back and E: tally back<n><n>### Response:		Choice: B<n><n>### Rationale:<n>A common saying goes something like "Go for it." <n>Since "for it" could mean many things, going "forward" or "toward" is logical to say. <n>However, since the word "and" is used, this means that "back" is being suggested.<n>Therefore, the choice that involves "back" is the correct one.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>Input from the original program is as follows:<n>Common saying "go forth, also this." <n><n>There is a problem with this statement. "Go forth" should be reversed and not backward. Therefore, the choice that says go back instead of backward is correct. "Back and forth, also this" would be correct though, but the choice does not say that in it.<n><n>### Input From Original: Go for it. <n><n>### Inventory: Go for it. This can have many meanings. Go forward or go towards means going forward, not reversing. Therefore, back is the correct answer.<n><n>---<n>

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem involves determining how much money you would receive for recycling cans and newspapers. <n><n>First find out how many sets of 12 cans are in 144 cans. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total number of cans (144) by the number of cans per set (12). <n><n>144 ÷ 12 = 12 sets of cans. <n><n>Each set of can is worth $0.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the cans, multiply the number of sets (12) by the worth of each set ($0.50). <n><n>12 x $0.50 = $6 <n><n>Next, find out how many set of 5 kilograms of newspapers are in 20 kilograms. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total kilograms of newspapers (20) by the number of kilograms per set (5). <n><n>20 ÷ 5 = 4 sets of newspapers. <n><n>Each set of newspaper is worth $1.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the newspapers, multiply the number of sets (4) by the worth of each set ($1.50). <n><n>4 x $1.50 = $6 <n><n>Finally, to find the total money earned, add the worth of the cans and the newspapers together. <n><n>$6 (for cans) + $6 (for newspapers) = $12.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?<n>Rationales: Betty picked 16 strawberries. <n>Then, Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty which makes 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.<n>Therefore, Matthew picked 36 strawberries.<n>We know that Matthew picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. <n>So, Natalie picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries.<n>The total number of strawberries they all picked is 16 (Betty's) + 36 (Matthew's) + 18 (Natalie's) = 70 strawberries.<n>Each jar of jam requires 7 strawberries, so they can make 70 strawberries / 7 strawberries per jar = 10 jars of jam.<n>Each jar of jam is sold for $4, so they made 10 jars * $4 per jar = $40 from the strawberries they picked.<n>Therefore, they made $40 from selling the strawberries they picked.<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:They wanted to eat at home but the cupboards were barren, so they had to go what? Choices:  A: cook dinner B: eat C: go back to work D: make food E: get food<n><n>### Response:		Go what?<n>### Answer:Back to work<n><n>### Why?:Because they were starving and they hadn't cook dinner yet.<n><n>### Why not?:A, C, D didn't make any sense.<n><n>### How would you know if the answer is wrong?:The answer to the question must be incorrect because either you don't have cupboards or don't have food and they can't go back to work to get food and if you know how to cook then there is no need to eat out and the other answer didn't make any grammatical sense.

No, not all wealthy people live in Europe.<n>* Big house? Yes, so A is the correct answer.<n><n>### B<n><n>* Big house? No, this does not make sense.<n>* Men's room? No, men dressed up for weddinsg would not likely live in a men's room, and so B is eliminated.<n><n>### C<n><n>* Big house, tuxedo, palace?

The text, which was written while Drake was in San Francisco Bay, was eventually published in London in 1628. In the book, Drake described his 1577 circumnavigation of the globe, describing the terrain of various land masses, as well as noting their navigable and treacherous nature. Some of the descriptions in the book would have been taken from maps, which had been created and used for centuries by explorers like Christopher Columbus, Vasco da Gama, and Ferdinand Magellan.: 84–89  Even earlier, the Ptolemy-Al-Maari map dating from 1300 was the first portrayal of the New World, with a depiction of the Aztec people.<n><n>### Another example:<n><n>In the early 1870's the United States Coast Pilot System developed the first maps of American coastal waters, and in 1891 the United States Geological Survey produced an atlas, the 1:24,000 scale U.S. Geological Survey's Standard Map of the United States.: 63, 117  The Department of the Interior's Geological Survey provided maps of the country until it was transferred in 1907 to the newly formed Bureau of the United States Geological and Geographical Survey, which was changed in 1969 to the USGS under the Department of the Interior.

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem involves determining how much money you would receive for recycling cans and newspapers. <n><n>First find out how many sets of 12 cans are in 144 cans. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total number of cans (144) by the number of cans per set (12). <n><n>144 ÷ 12 = 12 sets of cans. <n><n>Each set of can is worth $0.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the cans, multiply the number of sets (12) by the worth of each set ($0.50). <n><n>12 x $0.50 = $6 <n><n>Next, find out how many set of 5 kilograms of newspapers are in 20 kilograms. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total kilograms of newspapers (20) by the number of kilograms per set (5). <n><n>20 ÷ 5 = 4 sets of newspapers. <n><n>Each set of newspaper is worth $1.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the newspapers, multiply the number of sets (4) by the worth of each set ($1.50). <n><n>4 x $1.50 = $6 <n><n>Finally, to find the total money earned, add the worth of the cans and the newspapers together. <n><n>$6 (for cans) + $6 (for newspapers) = $12.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?<n>Rationales: Betty picked 16 strawberries. <n>Then, Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty which makes 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.<n>Therefore, Matthew picked 36 strawberries.<n>We know that Matthew picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. <n>So, Natalie picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries.<n>The total number of strawberries they all picked is 16 (Betty's) + 36 (Matthew's) + 18 (Natalie's) = 70 strawberries.<n>Each jar of jam requires 7 strawberries, so they can make 70 strawberries / 7 strawberries per jar = 10 jars of jam.<n>Each jar of jam is sold for $4, so they made 10 jars * $4 per jar = $40 from the strawberries they picked.<n>Therefore, they made $40 from selling the strawberries they picked.<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:He had an index card he had to return, so where did he put it after finding the book he needed?

Choices:  A: lot of grief B: depression C: no spouse D: lose money E: children suffer<n><n>### Response:		C<n><n>### Rationales:Divorces can have a huge negative impact on both spouses, but they also have an impact on children. This is because, often times, custody of the children is given to the parent who didn't want the divorce. These children must often change from one parent to another parent. This change usually results in lots of grief and depression and children usually suffer as a result.<n><n>### Input-In the case of this year, 50% of all children were born with deformities of some kinds, some of which were incapacitating.  How many children have incapacitating deformities?<n><n>### RESPONSE: A<n><n>### RATIONALE: First, if 50% of the children have incapaciting deformities, then 50% of every 100 children are not going to have incapacititing deformities and 50% of those 100 children will. The fraction of the 100 children that will not have incapacitinbing deformities is 100/2 = 50. Therefore, 50% (1) of every 10 children do not have incapicitating deformities, and 50% (2) of the remaining 90 children do not have it. Therefore, it can be concluded that for every 1000 children, 500 children do not have an incapacitating disorder. <n><n>### Input - What is 6 over ½, simplified? <n><n>### Rationailes - The numerator in the top fraction is six, and, as 6/2 = 3/1, there are three ones in ½.

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem involves determining how much money you would receive for recycling cans and newspapers. <n><n>First find out how many sets of 12 cans are in 144 cans. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total number of cans (144) by the number of cans per set (12). <n><n>144 ÷ 12 = 12 sets of cans. <n><n>Each set of can is worth $0.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the cans, multiply the number of sets (12) by the worth of each set ($0.50). <n><n>12 x $0.50 = $6 <n><n>Next, find out how many set of 5 kilograms of newspapers are in 20 kilograms. <n><n>This is done by dividing the total kilograms of newspapers (20) by the number of kilograms per set (5). <n><n>20 ÷ 5 = 4 sets of newspapers. <n><n>Each set of newspaper is worth $1.50. <n><n>To calculate the total worth of the newspapers, multiply the number of sets (4) by the worth of each set ($1.50). <n><n>4 x $1.50 = $6 <n><n>Finally, to find the total money earned, add the worth of the cans and the newspapers together. <n><n>$6 (for cans) + $6 (for newspapers) = $12.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?<n>Rationales: Betty picked 16 strawberries. <n>Then, Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty which makes 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.<n>Therefore, Matthew picked 36 strawberries.<n>We know that Matthew picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. <n>So, Natalie picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries.<n>The total number of strawberries they all picked is 16 (Betty's) + 36 (Matthew's) + 18 (Natalie's) = 70 strawberries.<n>Each jar of jam requires 7 strawberries, so they can make 70 strawberries / 7 strawberries per jar = 10 jars of jam.<n>Each jar of jam is sold for $4, so they made 10 jars * $4 per jar = $40 from the strawberries they picked.<n>Therefore, they made $40 from selling the strawberries they picked.<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:Where do people traditionally get information about the world? Choices:  A: book B: meeting C: television D: guide E: newspaper<n><n>### Response:		<n>Books are still one of the traditional ways for people to get information.<n><n>#### Above are four (4) valid possible responses<n><n>#### There is no correct answer.<n><n>### Input<n>The amount of candy corn Betty bought cost $0.40 per piece. The total number of packages Betty bought is 14. If Betty also bought 1 more package than Mary and 2 more packages<n>than Carol, how much candy did Betty buy?<n>Rationales<n>$0.40 is the cost per piece of candy corn. <n>The total number of pieces in 14 packages is $0.40 (cost) 14 ÷ 0.40 (price per piece) = 35. <n>Betty bought 35 pieces of candy corn.<n><n>To find how many more Mary has, subtract 35 (Betty' s) from 40 (the total number of pieces Mary had). <n>35 ‒ 40 = –5. Mary has 5 more pieces than Betty.<n><n>To find the total number of pieces Carol has, the same process is applied. <n>40 ‒ 35 = 5. Carol has 5 more pieces that Betty and Mary have combined.<n><n>Therefore, the total number of pieces Betty bought is 1 less than Mary and Carol combined.<n>Add 1, 2, and the total number of pieces of candy corn that was bought and get the total number of pieces.<n>Betty bought -1; Mary bought 5; Carol bought 5. ‒1 + 5 + 5 = 9<n>9 is the correct answer <n><n>### Below are four (4) different valid responses.<n><n>#### There is a correct answer: 9.<n><n>### Below is an instruction that requires the student to answer a multiple choice question.<n>Instruction<n>Which of the following questions has two choices that are not both correct?<n><n>### Below the student is shown 3 choices, which two are not correct?<n>Rationales which 2 of the choice given can be removed because they are not correct answer...<n>Choice A is correct, because it gives the answer $24, when $40 has been subtracted from all of the three choices ($32, $52, or $60).<n><n>

For the first set of brackets, (x + 3), the answer is obviously going to be x + 3 so x = -7. For the second set of brackets, x + 5, you take in the number -7 and plug it into the set of brackets, leaving a value of -2. To plug in the value into the next set of brackets, you add 3, leaving the final answer as 13.<n><n>### The third<n><n>Similar to the second example, you first solve the brackets inside the brackets, then plug the answers into the outer brackets to arrive at the final answer.

And when it's Wednesday, it will be the 4th days in the week, and you usually know that the last day in the week is Sunday, so that would make Monday and Wednesday the only two days that will be included in the choices for this problem.<n><n>## Instructions<n><n>1.

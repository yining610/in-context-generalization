I was able to get the correct number to be output on the command line. The error message just said that my output value was not correct.  That was really it.  However, when I wanted to figure out the answer, it took me a long, long time.  I felt I needed to be good at the language and know how to write and maintain a program if I were to go on to work as a programmer.  This didn't occur to me at the beginning, but I now  understand that that is a large part of computer science.<n><n>### Question 2<n><n>### Question ###<n><n># Question 3<n><n>What was hard about this code?<n><n>Sometimes I don't understand the concepts behind the code.  I feel like I am just learning how to use certain code blocks for what they are. I guess that is one way to look at it, but I am not sure it's the best way to go.  Maybe if had more time to study I could learn the concepts and do better.<n><n>### Comments<n><n># Question 4<n><n>### Question<n><n><n>### Comment<n><n># Question 5<n><n>I really don't remember doing this.<n><n>### Solution.<n><n># Question 6<n><n>I feel like I am not so great at making loops and being able to explain them clearly.  As I stated in the comments on question #3, I am not completely confident in what this code does inside the brackets.  I think I would be best learning to understand these from doing them more often, but it seems that when I do a whole assignment, I don't do very many loops.<n><n>### Answer<n><n># Question 7<n><n>One interesting part was making the output go through the program until it can't find anything else to do and then return an error message.

We can't really solve them with our given language features, we can try few methods. I think it's better to start with the last question.     <n>### Instruction:Find answers for the first four questions and answer the second four questions.<n>#### Question 1:<n>#### Solution:  We solved the last two questions, in which the first number is in the range of 5 to 12, and the second number is within -5 to +5. By using an object, and an addition with modulo of division by two (since there's a +5 in the range), we can easily map it to a range of -13 to 12. We can do few simple tests to map the answer to the final range. We did this before, but I'll cover it again. The answer should be in the range -13 to 2 (1+1=2). So we'll first look for numbers that fit our -13 to 8, we will have two out of three options. The third one won't fit. So we'll look at all numbers below 13 that divide two. We found 7, so our range would then start at -7 and end at 2. The second set of questions is easier, as it uses the same technique, but in a different order, so we need to be careful.     <n>#### Question 2:<n>#### Solution:    <n>First we need to determine the pattern of numbers of dogs and schnauzers. Since we have two variables (three times (number of), plus (difference between number of)), we'll look at these numbers. We found the answer for two sets of numbers of 20 (four fewer) and 25 (eight fewer). We found that we had more dogs, but the answer is 55 since the numbers didn't match. Since we know there's one less schnauzer than the result that gives us 20, the we need to calculate the other two. We found (55-14=41) and (55-25=30). So the correct answer should be 30-14=16.    <n>### Instruction;Answer the second set of questions.<n>#### Question

The rest of the problem is straightforward. If the number of dobermans is $20$, then so is the value for $x.$<n><n>There are ways to solve the question using different formulas, or trial and error, but the formula works quite efficiently.<n><n>If in each month Dr. Banks had $75$ toothbrushes left, then the number he started with was $330$. For the first month, he would need $53$ toothbrushs. For a $53 / 330$ = 0.1593, so we can round this to 0.16. So in the first month, the remaining number is $330 - x$, where $x$ is the toothbrushes given ($53 - 0.16$) = 51.44. We then have all the data we need to plug into our formula.<n><n>As a variable, Jordan catches $4$ fish the first day, where each day after that, he catches $2$ fish less. For every $i$, Jordan catches total fish $F_i = K * i$, where the $i$ tells the number of $i^{th}$ hour, starting at $0$. We know that Jordan caught $4$ and Perry caught $8$: $$[K * 1 * 4] + [K * 2 * 8] = 28$$<n><n>$K$ = 2.<n>When $t = 6$, we get another solution: $t = 6 + 4 * 6 = 28$.<n>We subtract the number of hours he caught fish from the number of hours he fished, and get hours he didn't catch fish.<n>Then we calculate the number of fish left at \$(6 /

I think it is a fun problem in that respect, I thought it for a long time and then realized that you can always calculate some variable with for loops.<n><n>### Solution. I also think that you could pass in a parameter that would say what month you are in (maybe use a range for the month number) and use that in order to adjust to time complexity.<n><n>### Credits: http://www.pymath.com/python-programming-examples.html<n><n>### Credit: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11677667/find-a-pair-of-integers-that-add-to-give-1010<n>

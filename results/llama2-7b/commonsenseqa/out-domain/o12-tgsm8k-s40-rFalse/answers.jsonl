I was able to get the correct number to be output on the command line. The error message just said that my output value was not correct.  That was really it.  However, when I wanted to figure out the answer, it took me a long, long time.

{"text": "B\n\n\n## **Output the result and explain**   \nThe first set of questions is a little bit easier one. We can't really solve them with our given language features, we can try few methods. I think it's better to start with the last question.     \n### Instruction:Find answers for the first four questions and answer the second four questions.\n#### Question 1:\n#### Solution:  We solved the last two questions, in which the first number is in the range of 5 to 12, and the second number is within -5 to +5. By using an object, and an addition with modulo of division by two (since there's a +5 in the range), we can easily map it to a range of -13 to 12. We can do few simple tests to map the answer to the final range. We did this before, but I'll cover it again. The answer should be in the range -13 to 2 (1+1=2). So we'll first look for numbers that fit our -13 to 8, we will have two out of three options. The third one won't fit. So we'll look at all numbers below 13 that divide two. We found 7, so our range would then start at -7 and end at 2. The second set of questions is easier, as it uses the same technique, but in a different order, so we need to be careful.     \n#### Question 2:\n#### Solution:    \nFirst we need to determine the pattern of numbers of dogs and schnauzers. Since we have two variables (three times (number of), plus (difference between number of)), we'll look at these numbers. We found the answer for two sets of numbers of 20 (four fewer) and 25 (eight fewer). We found that we had more dogs, but the answer is 55 since the numbers didn't match. Since we know there's one less schnauzer than the result that gives us 20, the we need to calculate the other two. We found (55-14=41) and (55-25=30). So the correct answer should be 30-14=16.    \n### Instruction;Answer the second set of questions.\n#### Question", "answer": "B: complete sentence"}

The rest of the problem is straightforward. If the number of dobermans is $20$, then so is the value for $x.$\n\nThere are ways to solve the question using different formulas, or trial and error, but the formula works quite efficiently.\n\nIf in each month Dr. Banks had $75$ toothbrushes left, then the number he started with was $330$. For the first month, he would need $53$ toothbrushs. For a $53 / 330$ = 0.1593, so we can round this to 0.16. So in the first month, the remaining number is $330 - x$, where $x$ is the toothbrushes given ($53 - 0.16$) = 51.44. We then have all the data we need to plug into our formula.\n\nAs a variable, Jordan catches $4$ fish the first day, where each day after that, he catches $2$ fish less. For every $i$, Jordan catches total fish $F_i = K * i$, where the $i$ tells the number of $i^{th}$ hour, starting at $0$. We know that Jordan caught $4$ and Perry caught $8$: $$[K * 1 * 4] + [K * 2 * 8] = 28$$\n\n$K$ = 2.\nWhen $t = 6$, we get another solution: $t = 6 + 4 * 6 = 28$.\nWe subtract the number of hours he caught fish from the number of hours he fished, and get hours he didn't catch fish.\nThen we calculate the number of fish left at \\$(6 /", "answer": "E: table"}

Do not worry about time and space complexity.\n\n\n### Solution: The solution is based on simple for loops, but the question is designed in such a way that it looks like you figured out something deep and beautiful about python and complexity. I think it is a fun problem in that respect, I thought it for a long time and then realized that you can always calculate some variable with for loops.\n\n### Solution. I also think that you could pass in a parameter that would say what month you are in (maybe use a range for the month number) and use that in order to adjust to time complexity.\n\n### Credits: http://www.pymath.com/python-programming-examples.html\n\n### Credit: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11677667/find-a-pair-of-integers-that-add-to-give-1010", "answer": "C: walking"}

{"text": "**Conceptual answer** \n\n* I agree that regardless of the race, income, gender, sexual orientation, age, physical ability, or religion, that we should offer everyone a fair and equal opportunity to apply for a job. Without an equal opportunity to apply for the job, we can't consider that person an equal opportunity employee and won't get a diverse workforce. Employers need this diversity within the workforce in order to thrive in this constantly changing work climate.\n\nIf a person applying is of African American descent and has a criminal conviction, they should still be considered for the position, because just because that person has a record does not make them an incapable employee. This person could be given a chance with the proper training. With the training from the employer, there is another chance that if the job is given to this person with a record, there would be fewer recidivism.\n\nOn the other hand, if you put one of the individuals into the position without any training and having already committed a crime, that could turn out to be a liability. If this person is hired, then there would be a chance that they would commit another crime and it would affect the whole work environment.\n\nThis would affect everyone who works with this person because they would be taking a risk in hiring this individual and there would be no safety or morale amongst the coworkers. It could possibly put that person in a situation that they could lose their job and could even bring on a lawsuit.\n\nIt is obvious that even if the person has been given the opportunity and accepted onto the job, they should learn how to live a crime-free life and be able to do whatever it takes to make sure that they stay afloat so they can have a decent way of life. If the person doesn\u2019t take this opportunity at the time they should learn the consequences and to put things in perspective and know what they need to do to change their lives, but if they fail and things don\u2019t work out that they would not have been given the opportunity to apply for the position. It would only make the situation worst.\n\n**Programmatic answer:**\nTo implement fairness for applying to the job, I would use a program that would allow every applicant to submit their information and give them a status. It would have a color status to show whether they made it or were not selected for the job or had some", "answer": "C: equal opportunity"}

They believe the borrower can only repay $ 40,000 a year for 20. If the repayment begins in one year, how much money will the bank lose if the borrower can repay the loan in less than 20 years?\n2.\tGiven that the total amount of the loan was $ 500 million, how much of the loan is being repaid each year, if every year, only one million dollars is being returned on the principal?\n\n\\Response:\nAsker: The bank wants to make a  $100, 000 loan.  The loan payment that can be repaid per year is $ 40, 00 per year.  The interest rate per year for borrowing a loan is 6%  In 12 years,  the borrowing will be zero and the loan will never be paid back.   Let us write I(t) = $ 6t, where t is the number of year, which means $6 per year.  The loan will never be paid off over 20 years. \n\nBorrowing: Given that the total amount of loan is $ 500, 0 million and the loan payment every year is one million dollars repaid on the principle (P).In 10 years,  the loan is still due ( 500,00 million \u2013 100, \n000 million). So in 10 years,   the borrowed amount is $500,0 000 and the interest rate every year is 6%.  The loan is still due.

If you find it too easy, see how it can be solved using long division.\n3. If you can't come up with a solution, see if you can think of another way to solve the problem.\n\n### Explanation:\nIf you're confused, go ahead and solve it without division. You might be able to do it. \n### Solution without division:\nThe difference in ages between Richard hurley is 20:\nFirst, subtract their age:\n10-14 = 4\nNext, add their age:\n14+10 = 24\nNow, add to get the next number of years: 24 + 20 = 44\nThen, move the decimal two places to the right: 145 years later!\n\nIf you can't understand the division method, it is fine. It is a mathematical operation in its most simple form. You will learn about it another time, but we will use it to solve it now. \n### Step by step division\nDivide 24 by 20.\n24/20 = 1.2\nMultiply 20.\n1.2 X 20 = 24.\nNow we can find the number of years, just move the decimal two places.\n145 years later, that is how many years it will be.\n\n### Hint: It is very easy to check your work on calculators, by dividing 139 by 24.\n\n### Discussion: How to divide without a calculator.\n\nWhat is the least common multiple of 139 and 24?

Jake nodded and the teacher set the marshmallows 7 inches away from his hand. \u201cJake, before you eat any marshmallows, how much time do you need to come up with a strategy for eating the marshmallos?\u201d the teacher asked. Jake paused for a moment, looked down at the marshmalllows, and then looked up and smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve got it!

(Since the total of the two numbers is 51, the largest number is 50, if I subtract those two numbers from 50, I have 1. Now I know that the numbers are odd and in order so I need to find them individually, and when I know them, then I can easily subtract their sum from 51 and get the difference as the least of the two consecutive even integers that sum to 51.)\n\n\n| | | |  |\n|-|-|-|\n| Solution-: |1 | 2  |\n\n \n\nAnswer|   Solution|\n|  answer | \n|:-----:|\n| 2,6 |    57            \n| 4,8 |    66              \n| 6,10 |    75            \n| 8,12 |    84              \n|10,14 |    93              \n|12,16 |   101", "answer": "B: have fun"}

In fact, we often compare ourselves to others and feel we never quite measure up. But the truth is we are the only ones in the world who can really tell ourselves what our strengths are.\n\nFirst, we have to be open about what we value. To do this, we have to know what we believe about ourselves. Many people have a lot of self-doubt, which can make focusing on success and what we want to accomplish very difficult. By developing a clear idea of what we value, it is easier to understand the unique contributions we can make to our organization.\n\nWhen we have knowledge about what we value, we can then recognize what we contribute. If we truly know our values, we can easily determine what we bring to the workplace.\n\nIt goes without saying that we don\u2019t often take stock of these value-driven qualities because we are too busy rushing to our next meeting or worrying about all the unfinished work on our desk.\n\nEven though many of us feel inadequate in many areas of performance, there are specific value-driven qual-ities that we all have \u2013 skills we may take for granted because they are so important that we almost can\u2019t see our world without them.", "answer": "D: big city"}

The session is the sharing of information using a particular means of communication that are face-to-face, either directly or through the use of other media technologies (such as phones and the Internet). We call it the traditional conference because it focuses mainly on the exchange of information between people.\n\n### Notes: \nThe brainstorming session is a technique for helping to generate as many ideas relating to a specific topic as possible. It is the most effective when every person involved has a similar skill level and experience in the subject matter and in group brainstorming. There may be a person in the group who has a more extensive knowledge on the topic or has access to more data or resources but everyone should have the same experience in brainstorming. Brainstorming is a flexible and easy-to-use tool that provides an uninhibited, spontaneous and positive group environment, where every person can share and contribute their ideas. The leader of the discussion is not allowed to criticise or stop anyone. The leader of the brainstorming is expected to record all ideas, whether they are positive or negative and evaluate every new idea. But there is a good reason to give negative idea a close look. Sometimes it is negative or even contrary to the brainstorming goals. But the most valuable ideas may be the negative or counter-productive. If a negative solution seems like it can help in some way, then it needs to be evaluated.\n\n\n### Additional notes:\nYou can look at the Brainstorming Wikipedia's page for more information about the topic.\n\n### Submit your response in the form of a comment below.\n### Upload files", "answer": "B: exchange of ideas"}

The answer can be provided via spoken word or written word.\n\n### Scenario:\n\nI am walking to a corner store in the middle of the city.  There are shops around me, however, I did not see the store I planned to enter.  I arrived at a stop lights corner and noticed a man sitting there.  I knew this was a man I often saw walking around.  I have not seen that man in days so, I called to him with the expectation that he would follow me to the store.  He did not follow me, and I realized after taking my second left turn, that he had been dead, laid out at the corner with a sign saying 'will work for food'.  I went inside the store and bought $5 worth of food for him.  After picking up some items, I went to go check on the dead man.  I walked by a bus stop and noticed a girl eating her fruit.  She must have seen me looking at the dead man and she asked what I was looking at.  I explained the problem and she said she would get the dead man some food, but she only had $2 in her coin purse.  She then offered me a $1 for my food and gave me a dollar sign with one dollar in the middle.  I told her I had 2 items to purchase and the total was going to exceed $1. She told me that she would be returning later to take me to a casino.  I was not expecting that, but I decided to take her up on her offer.  I took a $2 bill out of my coin purse and added it to her hand full of change.  She told me they made a nice pair and she held me by the hand and led me to the casino.  We walked in and saw a table with a man dressed up as a gambler.

So this is\n\nconsidering 12 dozen as a quantity at the grocery shop.\n\nTherefore you can say that A is a solution and B is a\n\ncorrect answer to a satisfied person.\n\n(There is a typo at the very bottom)\n\n\n### Instructions: The above paragraph should be rewritten so that the response is correct.

{"text": "Choices -  D. Body\n\n### Explanation:\nRichard said it was a cut that happened to his own body, so it was cut on his body. Since Hurley is talking about cuts that only affect them, the cut must be on his body. Also, Richard is 16 and Hurley is 52, so the combined ages are at least 78 years. So, when they combined ages of 40 years from the original question, their combined ages must be 78-20 because it\u2019s 40 years from when they\u2019re 14. So the solution is 128 - 20 = 108, and Hurley is 156, so the combined ages must be somewhere 156 + 20 = 78-2 = 76. So the combined ages are 128 and since Richard was 16 (2 added to 150-52= 98-2=76) so the combined ages are 76 and 16, so I know 128=76+98, so I know 76=98+20-16, so since Pablo is 52, if I add 20 to both sides of the equation, I get 52 + 20 =172, so Pablo read 12 books.", "answer": "B: finger"}

{"text": "For the first problem, we can use the modulo function to find the difference, in this way `xmody` means that the result is x modulo y.\nFor the second problem, we have to read the question carefully and look for more clues to understand what is being asked for.

{"text": "```\nThe most important aspect of learning is the learning environment and the content of the learning. If the learning environment is one where we are comfortable expressing our fears, doubts, weaknesses, etc., then we can feel safe to ask questions during class. This can lead to increased understanding of challenging concepts. The main problem with how we are educated in many countries is the standard of learning does not meet the needs of society's needs as it does not always build on student's interests which means the learning is not exciting enough and is the least preferred method of learning. Learning can also be made enjoyable through gamification. We can use games to encourage students to do their assignments, we can also create games to teach concepts as another way of learning. It would be great to have an environment that can change learning for you that supports the different learning types. I think that one can be able to pick one's preference to learning online or offline. One example of the type of learning platform that can do this is Udacity. It allows you to pick offline or online learning from their site. Udacity also allows you to select and learn at your preferred speed. When taking a course, one has to complete units at their learning speed that's why I'd prefer them to give you options for the speed of learning.\n```\n\n#### Output:\n```\nOutput: \n```\n### Instruction The text below was written by someone else.

I am not proud of it, I always feel like if I have a great opportunity, I let it get away because, fear of what other people might think. I've always been afraid of failure, I didn't want to end up being the nerd and the loner again in school. I have so many unfulfilled dreams, I hope they get fulfilled soon and I can be a better part of the world.

But why do we have to write \"he lived with his children because\" this is to show that he is not living with his children to be together but to be independent because of where he wanted to go.\n### Instruction 2:\nWrite a response that appropriately answers the question.\n\n##### Demonstrations:\n\nInput: In the book, the heroine's name is \"Lily.\" She likes to go to the park because she likes to listen to the birds sing and watch the water fall over the edge into the creek. When she gets home from the park, she makes cookies in the kitchen to eat. What does she make cookies with? Choices: A: Cappuccino B: Soup C: Honey D: Cheese\n\n### Answer: \n### D\n### Explanation:\nThe correct one is d, because when she mentions about a girl she likes to listen the birds sing and watch water fall. Then it says to make sweet dish, such as cookies. And also the words she said \"cookies\" is in plural. And the word \"cappuccino\" is not common in our daily life.

After he pulled it the plane was in a better and safer position.\n### Demonstatrion:\nBefore you start, make sure you draw some imaginary lines. Then make the left stick facing down and right stick facing up and put the top one down a little because you are on autopilot already. Then start the airplane moving right and up. Put the right and up stick down.\n### Explanations:\n#### Why the stearing up left stick was made into down\nB", "answer": "B: old people's home"}

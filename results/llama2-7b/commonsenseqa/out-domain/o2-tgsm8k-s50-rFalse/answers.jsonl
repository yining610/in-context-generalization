If Jack adds two cups of water to three cups of soup left by the cook, will there be enough soup for Jack\u2019s family of four? Answer Choices: A: Yes\nB: No\n\nOutput: Answer should B\n\n```\n\n```\n\n#### Solution\n\nIn this problem, we need to compute the difference in age between two men Hurley and Richard.\nSince Hurley is 13, the difference in age between Hurley and Richard should be 16, and their combined age will be 27.\n\nIn the second problem, the output was not correct. The candy can be bought for $25 and left at least 40 cents. So, the amount of candy can be bought is $30, that is, 15 pages per book * 2 books\n\nIn the third problem, the output was correct: since the population in desert or unpopulated area is small, \"where the people were\" does not refer to the desert or the unpopulated areas.\nIt refers to populated areas, such as apartment or a race track.\nSo, the answer is \"the desert\" or \"where the people are\"\n\nThe output of the fourth problem should have been C. Jack does not know the correct recipe and thus cannot calculate the final amount correctly by himself. The final amount is either the right answer (C), or is equal to Jack\u2019s family and thus is the wrong answer (B).\n\n### Input: The difference in ages in 20. If Harley is 14, what are their combined age 40 years from today?\nOutput: 22\n\n```\n\n### Input 2 - Pablo reads 150 pages per book and buys $15 in candy. He has $3 left over.\n\nOutput is wrong. Answer should be 12.\n\n### Input-friend of Jack is making soup. Jack needs 2 cups of water to add to 3 cups of soup left\n\nOutput should be B: No since he needs 2 cups to add to 3.\n\n### Instruction:Answer the quests above, and write each answer in correct sentence", "answer": "B: populated areas"}

{"text": "B\n\n\n\n***\n***\n\n##### Solution:\n\n##### Answer 1.\n\n**Output**:\n\n**Solution**: \n\nLet their ages be X & Y respectively. From the problem,\n    X = Y + 20\n\nAlso,\n    Y = X - 20\n\nHurley's age now is X minus 20, so Hurley is 28.\n\nRichard's age now is Y plus 20, so Richard is 38.\nCombined ages after 40 years:\n    X + Y = 48\n\nSo X + Y == 48.\n\n48/2 = 24, which makes X = 24.\n\nAnd we can solve for Y = 24 -20 = 4.\n\nBecause 48 -4 = 44, so 44 + 4 = 48.\nBecause 24 + 4 =28, so 48-28 = 20.\n\nThe solution, 24 + 24 - 20 = 28 + 4 = 32.\n\n**NOTE:** The answer key does not match.

We need a program that first adds the 3-digit area codes together, then adds the 4-digit extension numbers together. The format for this is something like *613-234-1234*\nIn the US, these numbers will form a string of numbers in this format: *(###) ###-####*. To add the areas together, the letters are considered a number if they form an alphabet. So, if you had an area of 613-222-0081, you would add together the 2+2+0+0+8+1 to get a 14-digit number, *2220081*.\nFor this part of the homework, a program that would add two 14-digit phone numbers together would be adequate.

Programming is also an art of implementing a solution into different steps. An algorithm or a procedure is a step-by-step solution of a problem. We can implement a programming solution using different steps known as procedure. A procedure should have a starting point. It may be called a procedure starting point or a starting point of a procedure. It may have an exit point. It may be a procedure termination or a procedure ending point. Procedures are very like formulas. Like formulas, you do not start calculating from the last step, you start from the first step and do calculation to get the final result.\n\n### Instrucion:Write an algorithm for a student that would be given a total of two grades and their percentage and grade should be calculated.\n\n### Input: Input a total of two grate and their percentage\nInput\nOutput", "answer": "C: health"}

{"text": "A\n  \n## Description:\nThe purpose of this challenge is to get you to program in Python. This challenge is a little more difficult than the one above. If you've worked through the prior challenge, you should be able to complete it without too much trouble. If you've taken Data Structures & Algorithms (or any other high level programming course), it shouldn't be too difficult. If taking this class is new to you, it may prove to be a challenge. You can also use the code for the prior challenge as a starting point for this challenge (I've supplied that code in this repository.)\n\nIn this exercise, you get a list of words from the user and you create a dictionary from those words. The solution has to use a dictionary to store our words. We are to look for duplicate words and add each one to the dictionary. The output will be a list of all the words that were printed multiple times.\n\n### Part 1: Creating the dictionary of words\n\nFirst, we define a dictionary of our words. We'll do this with a for loop in Python (as indicated below.) As we iterate through our list from the user, we add each word that was not in the dictionary to it. We will need a way to test to see if a value already exists in the dictionary. We use a special type of data structure called an 'in' function that will return true if a value exists and false if it does not. If we are printing a duplicate value, it will return false since that will only be true if it has not been printed at all. We need to store each print statement and at the end of the list we can create our output.\n\n\n### Problem 2:\nIn this problem, we will do the exact same thing. Once we have printed our list of words that repeated, we will test and see if any of them are strings. If they are, we will print their index, which will be the position of the word in the list of repeats.", "answer": "E: social bonding"}

{"text": "C: warm coat\n\n\n\n\n### Solution\n\nMy solution is to use recursion. Recall that a recursive function is one which calls itself. The goal is to find a function f, such that f(f(x)) = 2x  for x>0\n\n#### Base Case\n$$\nf(0) = 0\n$$\n\n#### Recursive Case\n$$\nf'(x) = \\frac{2x}{x} = \\frac{2}{1}\n$$\n\n$$\nf(x) = x + \\frac{x}{x} = x + 1\n$$\n\nI then plugged the numbers into the equation and got the answer $25$. This method will work for any function. I applied similar logic when solving the question of how many books he had read. I defined the recursive function f which takes a number n and then adds a number 1 to itself. The recursive step becomes f(n) which returns n + 1 and the base step (n=0) f(0) return zero.\n\n#### Instruction:Answer the question below\nInput: The difference between Richard and Hurley\u2019s ages is 20. In 1 year, Hurley\u2019s age will be 16, and how old will Richard be?\nOutput:140\n\n### Question\nWhy does the recursive step return a number that is one more than what is put in?\nA quick thought experiment I used to come up with the answer was to consider the function f(f(x)). I plugged in x=0 and got 0. I plugged in x+1 and got x+3. When I plugged in the function with two variables, if I plugged in f(x), I got f(x+1)\n\n### Solution - Solution to Prelude exercises\nMy solution is to break the sum into two steps:\n\n1. Add a number to the original sum\n2. Divide the sum \n\nI chose to first divide the sum by 2, then substract 1 and finally multiply by 5/2 to ensure the answer was an integer.\n\nA more elegant solution is to simply subtract 1 and then divide by 2. I chose to use this answer because it illustrates how you can divide by any value greater than 1, and the recursive step of the function", "answer": "E: read book"}

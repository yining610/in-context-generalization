### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20. If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Output: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Output: 12<n><n>Input:Sammy wanted to go to where the people were.  Where might he go? Choices:  A: race track B: populated areas C: the desert D: apartment E: roadblock<n>Output:		Answer should be C<n><n>Input: A friend of Jack’s is making soup. If Jack adds two cups of water to three cups of soup left by the cook, will there be enough soup for Jack’s family of four? Answer Choices: A: Yes<n>B: No<n><n>Output: Answer should B<n><n>```<n><n>```<n><n>#### Solution<n><n>In this problem, we need to compute the difference in age between two men Hurley and Richard.<n>Since Hurley is 13, the difference in age between Hurley and Richard should be 16, and their combined age will be 27.<n><n>In the second problem, the output was not correct. The candy can be bought for $25 and left at least 40 cents. So, the amount of candy can be bought is $30, that is, 15 pages per book * 2 books<n><n>In the third problem, the output was correct: since the population in desert or unpopulated area is small, "where the people were" does not refer to the desert or the unpopulated areas.<n>It refers to populated areas, such as apartment or a race track.<n>So, the answer is "the desert" or "where the people are"<n><n>The output of the fourth problem should have been C. Jack does not know the correct recipe and thus cannot calculate the final amount correctly by himself. The final amount is either the right answer (C), or is equal to Jack’s family and thus is the wrong answer (B).<n><n>### Input: The difference in ages in 20. If Harley is 14, what are their combined age 40 years from today?<n>Output: 22<n><n>```<n><n>### Input 2 - Pablo reads 150 pages per book and buys $15 in candy. He has $3 left over.<n><n>Output is wrong. Answer should be 12.<n><n>### Input-friend of Jack is making soup. Jack needs 2 cups of water to add to 3 cups of soup left<n><n>Output should be B: No since he needs 2 cups to add to 3.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the quests above, and write each answer in correct sentence<n>

Choices:  A: town B: at hotel C: mall D: business sector E: yellow pages<n>Output:		A<n><n>### Solution:<n>### Answer<n>In order to solve this task we are going to need the following steps<n>```<n>	Step:1- We calculate the subtraction and it give us 18<n>	Step 2- We count the pages and we got 15 and then divide it by 15 and that will give us 1 and so 150<n>	Step 3- We go to the store and count the cost of cents and the leftover and it will be 12 which mean that Pablo read 12 books<n>	Step 4- We count the letters in every word and it will give us 3 letters at least it was the case for Pablo<n>### Question: In order to solve this task, we have to multiply the number of letters in each word. I guess that's the trick in question D<n>	<n>### Answer: A is the right answer based on the given question the business restaurant will be located in business district<n>	<n>### Tip:  For the subtraction you can use the difference formula which is first subtracted by the first number(20) from the second number(14) and it will give us the answer(2) and the first number is subtracted from the second number will give the difference (28) and now the second number is subtracted(28) from the first number(14)   and we got the answer  10<n>	<n>### Code:<n>```javascript<n><n>class Solution {<n>    public int solution(int[] A, int[] B) {<n>    	//Code<n>        char AChar = 'z', BChar = 'z';<n>        int i=0, j=0, k, len1=0,len2=0,a=0;<n>       for(int a=0;a<A.length;a++){<n>           for(int i=j=0; i<len1 && j<len2; ++i)<n>		    if(A[a]>=97&&A[a]<=122)<n>		    	     BChar = (char)(A[a]-96);<n>        AChar = 'a'+(int)A[a];<n>        if(AChar == BChar){<n>            k = AChar;<n>            ++j, ++len

For both questions, you will be programming in Java or.NET, whichever you choose.<n><n>##### Question #1<n><n>(a) Write a program to add two 7-digit phone numbers together.<n><n>##### Instruction<n>A phone number has a prefix, such as *613*, a 3-digit area code, followed by a 4-digit area code, then up to four 6-digit extensions (or, in the case of cell phones, 10-digit numbers). We need a program that first adds the 3-digit area codes together, then adds the 4-digit extension numbers together. The format for this is something like *613-234-1234*<n>In the US, these numbers will form a string of numbers in this format: *(###) ###-####*. To add the areas together, the letters are considered a number if they form an alphabet. So, if you had an area of 613-222-0081, you would add together the 2+2+0+0+8+1 to get a 14-digit number, *2220081*.<n>For this part of the homework, a program that would add two 14-digit phone numbers together would be adequate. The format is *(###) ####-####*. For the program (a), we need an algorithm to first determine the string format of the phone number, then add the areas together, and then add the extensions together.<n>

Programming is also an art of implementing a solution into different steps. An algorithm or a procedure is a step-by-step solution of a problem. We can implement a programming solution using different steps known as procedure. A procedure should have a starting point. It may be called a procedure starting point or a starting point of a procedure. It may have an exit point. It may be a procedure termination or a procedure ending point. Procedures are very like formulas. Like formulas, you do not start calculating from the last step, you start from the first step and do calculation to get the final result.<n><n>### Instrucion:Write an algorithm for a student that would be given a total of two grades and their percentage and grade should be calculated.<n><n>### Input: Input a total of two grate and their percentage<n>Input<n>Output<n>

The question doesn't make sense because we don't know what people want to do, but from the question we can assume they're going to do A. The first letter of each choice is capital so we can assume these to be words and answer A.<n>

This challenge is a little more difficult than the one above. If you've worked through the prior challenge, you should be able to complete it without too much trouble. If you've taken Data Structures & Algorithms (or any other high level programming course), it shouldn't be too difficult. If taking this class is new to you, it may prove to be a challenge. You can also use the code for the prior challenge as a starting point for this challenge (I've supplied that code in this repository.)<n><n>In this exercise, you get a list of words from the user and you create a dictionary from those words. The solution has to use a dictionary to store our words. We are to look for duplicate words and add each one to the dictionary. The output will be a list of all the words that were printed multiple times.<n><n>### Part 1: Creating the dictionary of words<n><n>First, we define a dictionary of our words. We'll do this with a for loop in Python (as indicated below.) As we iterate through our list from the user, we add each word that was not in the dictionary to it. We will need a way to test to see if a value already exists in the dictionary. We use a special type of data structure called an 'in' function that will return true if a value exists and false if it does not. If we are printing a duplicate value, it will return false since that will only be true if it has not been printed at all. We need to store each print statement and at the end of the list we can create our output.<n><n><n>### Problem 2:<n>In this problem, we will do the exact same thing. Once we have printed our list of words that repeated, we will test and see if any of them are strings. If they are, we will print their index, which will be the position of the word in the list of repeats.<n><n> <n>

The town was further in miles than the 37 2nd house from the end of the street. The car could travel 688.5 miles per gallon, if it used four gallons more than a full tank.<n>Output:<n><n>#### Explanation:<n>The answer to the first question is 108 because this question is asking for the difference of ages when 40 years pass between Richard and Hurley. We can convert the 40 years old to 40 years subtracting 20 years and we get 20.<n>The answer for the second question is 12 because the mother of Pablo will give him $10 and he can read 150 pages for every $10 she pays him and the book that is always 150 pages is $10. and the next year he will have $20, so we can convert $20 to 2 and we get 10.<n>The answer to the third question is A:Kitchen for cabinets because we can choose in kitchen or we can put them in every place.  And the answer for the fourth question is Mexico because the question is asking us the distance to the next town, the next town is farther and it is in mile and it took 25.2 miles to get to the next town. And the answer is farther than house 2nd and the question is asking us how much was 4 gallons of the car to travel 688 miles?<n><img src='https://d.ibxmtiooel.com/2b870c4288c42e2e963b9dbbff6203bf/8114f55c8d6c18e338cc71b695c892dd4b6031fff3a119594f6f00705da60c7d6.png' alt='' width='95%' height='80%'><n><n>## What is the difference between data types and data structure?<n>Data structure is an object which contains the set of data<n><n>Data types is kind of storage location that contains the different data<n><n>## When is

They say that for the first loop they only want you using the print function as it is a built in function and will know to do the print command.<n><n>* Most of the test are focused on how you write the tests as these tests are suppose to help you learn how to write the code and to give you feedback on how to better write the tests.<n><n><n>#### Problem Set 3 Test:<n><n>* This test is 20-25 test that I think you should be comfortable with to ace the test.<n>* The test will cover every chapter starting at the beginning chapter and including the last chapter of the book.<n>* It will try to trick you by giving you the answer in the question and hoping you choose the right thing to type in.<n>* Some of the questions won't even have a test type and it will only have an answer with a number in the sentence.<n><n><n>#### What you need to do:<n><n>* Read the textbook as much as you can so you know what to do and how to accomplish something.<n>* Don't write any code, get the hang of how to write the test questions until you start writing some code and then test it once you have gotten it to work.<n>* Test all your questions and if the first test, try to get all the questions to work then go to the next page and start over.<n>* Don'f be afraid to run your test over and over

This method will work for any function. I applied similar logic when solving the question of how many books he had read. I defined the recursive function f which takes a number n and then adds a number 1 to itself. The recursive step becomes f(n) which returns n + 1 and the base step (n=0) f(0) return zero.<n><n>#### Instruction:Answer the question below<n>Input: The difference between Richard and Hurley’s ages is 20.

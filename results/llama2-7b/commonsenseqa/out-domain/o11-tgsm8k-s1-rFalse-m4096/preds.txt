The total number of comments on the Instagram posts was twice the average comments the previous day. Find the total number of comments last 24 hours.<n>1. The first method to approach this, was to find the difference between previous day average comments and the number of comments at the current day. That yields a value of 284.<n>2. Then subtract the average number of comments on the day before. It is found to be 166.<n>3. Subtracting the two values yields us 50.<n>4. Since the number of comments in the last 24 = total of comments - current day average.<n>5. 50 = total comments => the total number of comments = 1400.<n><n>In the next four months the temperature at Chicago will increase by 10 degrees Fahrenheit.

If she had 89 stickies, then she used up 3 plus 7x4 (because she used 3 for 1 page, and then she used the rest for x4 pages) = 17. So after subtracting 17 she is left with 72.<n>2. Answer 3 if you want to be sure. 65 + 28 (babysit for 2 hours) - 5 (mow the lawn) - 10 (allowance) = 6.<n>3. 65 + (3k + 3g) = k + g. We are also given the ratios. So if we combine them we get, 65 + 3k = k + g, 65 + g = k + 3g, 65 = k + g - 3g, so k = 60.<n>4. 60 + 3 x 4 = 60 + 12 = 72 points<n>5. We can do the same thing as problem 1. 10,430 - (287^2 + ( 10430 * 4/100))<n>6. 1/6 of the pie means he ate 240g. So then if we subtract from 1200 g that leaves him 960g.<n>7. (280/6) * 3 = 8<n>8. We can solve the second equation in regards to how we can solve the first equation. We know that 30 - (3x + 2x) and we can subtract to get 17 - 2x to isolate x. So if we solve for x, we get x = 6.<n>9. There are 50 - ((4/5) * 50 ) = 40 children<n>10. There are 40/5 = 10 $10 bills<n>

B. heretical. C. orthdoxy. D. conservadox. E. liberal.<n>Output:  B<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the questions from text.<n><n>The priest pushed for more traditional behaviour, the word orthodox means:<n>```<n>A. a type of dress<n>B. heretical<n>C. orthdoxy<n>D. conservadox<n>E. liberal<n>```<n><n>Both of these are correct. Orthodoxy is when you stick to the doctrine of the main church (for instance, it would be Protestant orthodoxy to stick to the doctrines of Luther or Calvin). Conservadox means holding back from change, so the priest is trying to revoke heretical and liberal behaviour.<n>But heretical means to not hold to the main doctrine of your church or organisation, so the priest is pushing for traditional behaviour. Orthodox is just the adjective to describe this type of traditional behaviour. Since heretical is the negative of orthodox, orthdoxy is the word the priest is using.<n><n>A. a type  of dress.<n>```<n>This is incorrect because orthodox doesn't have any meaning that this question implies. To answer this type of question, if you don't understand the answer then the answer probably isn't the one you want.<n>```<n><n>C. orthdox<n>```<n><n>Choosing the correct spelling is an easy way to get an additional question as well as bonus points:<n>```<n><n>D. conservadoxy<n>What if I don't know any spelling rules and have nothing to go on? The answer:<n>```<n><n>E. orthdox<n><n># The solution is A.<n><n>#### Other Notes:<n><n>The first sentence is to ensure you know what you're reading. They could have said 'The priest pushed for more conservative behaviour.' and the meaning would have stayed the same. It is a good idea to understand what you are reading before continuing.<n>

It's much more difficult to work out problems than it was a year ago, but I got better. One advantage working is that I got to learn multiple approaches of solving problems. It's also good to know more mathematical formulas now that I have time for it. <n><n>What did you like most on this programming experience?<n><n>I liked almost all the problems this month, I only found one difficultly for the question: "There are 50 children for a party. Three-fifts of them are boys.How  many of them are girls?" I knew that you get answer by dividing by two, but it turned out to be one more girl. Maybe I didn't work hard on this because of the stress.<n><n><n><n>## Part 3 What are you hoping to learn/get out of this month programming session?<n><n>In the future, I wish to learn a variety of problems and different algorithms for them. As time goes by, I still have a lot of things to learn and improve on.<n><n><n><n><n>If you could share one advice to the other people in this programming session, it would be: <n><n>Try to look at different approaches instead of focusing on one approach, and focus on learning not on working on one specific task. But don't stop there, keep learning!<n>

In this story, there are 3 monkeys and a snake. The monkeys are named Mumu, MeeMee, and Momo, and the snake's name is Snake. The monkeys and the snake live inside a large barn. One day, they are surprised to see 2 eggs appear in front of the monkeys. The monkeys were very curious about the eggs and decided to take them inside the barn. They wanted to crack the eggs open but Mumu got scared. He realized that if the eggs broke, the monkeys wouldn't be able to cook in the barn's kitchen. The monkeys decided to place the eggs back at the same spot the next morning, but Snake ate the eggs! Unfortunately, the monkeys did not find out that Snake ate the 2 eggs. The next morning there were 2 more eggs appear in front of Monkey and he decided to take the eggs inside the barn. He wanted to crack open the eggs but MeeMee got scared. He knew that if the eggs broke he wouldn't be able crack them open in the barn kitchen. The 3 monkeys were very happy that they found the eggs but Snake ate them again!!! Every morning, there were always 2 more eggs appear at the same spot just like the time before. Momo decided to take the eggs in for the third time, but MeeMee told him that he better be very careful, because he didn't want to break the eggs while cracking them open. Unfortunately, MeeMee got really scared because the eggs were already 3 days old by that time so if he cracked them open, the eggs might hatch. All of a sudden a snake appeared from somewhere (it came out of the woodwork!). He was very mad about what the monkeys were trying to do. The 2 monkeys, though scared, put the eggs back on the spot where the snakes got. What happened to the snake?<n>Output: It got scared!!!

In the first two-selection method, you choose two numbers which are the first and third numbers of the original set using two of the following methods:  <n><n>The first method is by removing a  number from the end of the original set.  The second method is by reversing order.  In the second, two-selection method you choose two numbers which use both methods  and add them to the original set to get a new set.<n><n>After you choose two numbers using two of the above two-selection methods, the program will ask you what additional two-selection method should be used.  There will only be a third two-selection method.  After you choose a method, the program will be able to complete the task of choosing the third number using the third method by using the same logic.  You will have a chance to practice these two methods.<n><n>Let's choose the first and third numbers in the set.  Use any two-selection method which you use.  After you choose two numbers, the program will ask what additional two-selection to use.  So we could choose the original set of numbers again or we could change the order of the order of the numbers. By removing a number from the end of original list and reordering the new set will follow the same pattern. That is, we can ask the program to choose the fourth and the eighth numbers from the original and choose the remaining two numbers with different two-selection methods.<n><n><n>### Instruction:Answer the set of 10 multiple choice question.

From there it is a 16 hour trip straight through to their destination in another state. How many times does their rest stop?<n>Output: 5<n><n>### Solution: A, B, C, E.<n><n>#### A - You have to buy a new bike<n><n>Mark how many kangaroos he has and how many goats he has so you can see the total kangaroos and total goats. The question says: 3 goats > 2 goats. That's why he has three times more goats than kangaroos. Then, we just count the total legs to be answered: kangaroos × 2 legs + goats × 4 legs + total legs.<n><n>#### B - He has $59<n><n>The question says the old record is an average of 287 and he has only scored 10,430 points. We can set them equal and solve for what they need to be equal to in order to get a score of 10,599 to equal a new average of 286,150. 10,503 = 10,580 + x. Then we set x = 147. Then, 10,517 = 10,480 + 147 = 286,717.<n><n>#### E - 20 grams<n><n>It isn't specified if the coupons are $10, $1.25 or another value. We know that the total price is $67 which means that 6 coupons are $67 and the rest are $20. So we have 6 coupons for $67 and the remainder is 20. We can add that with the coupons and get $87 for the $67 coupons. This gives us $82.35 for the remainder of 20. When added to the rest, it becomes $67 (the amount for 6 coupons) + $82

This program counts the amount of times the string “cat” is contained in the array. Then it asks the user to input a second string and asks the user how many times that string is contained in the array, and if it is contained more than “cat” in the same array, it prints “yes” to the console. The user is given one of three options on the terminal to test if it is the same array it was last time for the user to verify if the count of the second string and the third string is the same. This is done with the following questions:<n><n>1. is this the second time?<n><n>2. is this the third time?<n><n>3. is this the fourth time?<n><n>I had to take this step by step for this assignment and this is what I did to finish the assignment, then I got a 100%.<n><n>```python<n>def counting(string):<n>    arr = string.split()<n>    counter=0<n>    for i in range(len(arr)):<n>        if(arr[i]=="cat"):<n>              counter=counter+1<n>    print("{} is contained in the array {} times".format(arr[i], counter))<n>    if(input()!="yes"):<n>        break<n>counting(['cat', 'cat', 'cat',<n>'cat', 'dog','mouse', 'cat', <n>'cat', 'cat',  'cat', 'cat'])<n>```<n><n>I think I did a great job with this assignment.

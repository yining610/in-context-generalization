If a car rental lasts 5 days, how much does the agency charge for the rental?   (35 for one and 25 for two means 35+25=60 days)\nAnswer: 640\n\n### Response with explanation:\n\nMy solution to the question above was to use a sum statement because it was more clear to be used the way i did. Here is the code.\n\n```\nsum(35+25, 1 to $3)\n```\nHere are my thoughts (1 to $3 tells it to sum one day, 2 days and so on) and i figured it was easier to put the code like that than using 25 because with the former method i had to add 60 as a total using a sum statement.\n\nThe other answer in case you don\u2019t get the other answer is this.\n\n```\ntotal 7 25\n```\n\nThe solution of this is to divide the price by 25 because their is 25 price for each day.\n\n### Input\nCar rental price = 35\n\ndays = 5\n\n$35 + $35 + $30 + $30 + 30\n\n= 7*35\n\n### Insturction\nInput: The ratio in pounds of a girl\u2019s weight per a boy\u2019s weight is 2:3.

Even though we may not do it, every single person driving in a car that is not using electric power is contributing to air pollution.\n\n### In our society, the environment is often at risk. Many of the cars that we use were designed before electric cars had made a dent in the marketplace. And the companies that design cars have not had a lot of incentive to make their cars run on clean fuels that are not harmful to the Earth. As a result, the auto company continues to design huge, guzzling, polluting cars.\n\n### Because of this kind of behavior, most of us as individuals have done many of things over the years that also polluted our environment. However, pollution does not just exist on Earth. It can also be found in space.\n\n### Astronauts have described the view of our Earth from space as a beautiful view of a blue and green ball floating in space.

Whenever you want to read something you have to call `read()` method with the respective parameter `input`\n\nInside the method `read()` you have to split `input` string with a `/` token which is the input separator char and you need to use a `do...while` loop to catch the input.\n\nThe following code is a basic example which should show you the principle.\n\n\\begin{code}\n    string read(string input, int separator)\n    {\n        int position = 0;\n        string s = \"\";\n        if(separator == 0)\n           return \"?\";\n        do\n        {\n            char c = input[position];\n            if(c == separator)\n            {\n                position++;\n                s += c;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                s += c + \":\";\n                position++;\n            }\n        } while(position < input.Length);\n\\end{code}}\n\nComment: The question doesn't specify how the inputs are separated, so the `\"` should be `,`?\n\nComment: Yes I thought this question was more about programming an interpreter which then reads the answer to each question and outputs the correct result.

If the average wait time for a passenger on the platform is 105 minutes, what is the rate, in fares per passenger, of the train?\n\n### Demo:\nWe see that the mean is two passengers per departure and the average wait time is 105, so the train carries on average 200 passengers per day.

So in this case the rate is the number of passengers that get on the train in a hour and 5 minutes.  So the wait times for two departures is 2*(105)*2, so that means the rate is 1400\n\n### Response :\nIt means the rate is 200\n\n## Requirement\nWrite a response that appropriately fulfils the request\n\n<pre>\nHow many girls will there be at your birthday party?\n3.5\nI have 600 in change.\n20\n\n14\nWhich of the following is equivalent to 6 \u00bd x 3?\n62/5\n14 x 5\n140/5\n\n61/5\n46\nHow many hours in a day?\n24\n84\nIt means the rate for the number of passengers.

{"text": "**a**\n\n### Instructions: The task requires making a logical argument. Write a response that demonstrates correct logical thinking, identifies premises of the argument, identifies the conclusion, and demonstrates why the argument is logically valid.\n### Demonstraion:\nIn the second chapter of the novel Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland, the Cheshire Cat tells Alice that it is easy to prove that a person can do something if they want to do it.  If that is the case, then it cannot be difficult to do something, since no effort is required to do something that we want to do.  The following argument is based on that example.\n\nIf it is easy to prove a person can do something they want to do then it is impossible to prove that a person cannot do something  they do not want to do.\n\nWe will use the following premises to prove our conclusion:\n\nPremise 1: Proving that a person can do what they want to do is easy.\nPremise 2: Proving that a  person cannot do what they do not want to is  difficult.\n\nWe have proved that if doing something we want is easy then doing something we do not want is difficult.  We have also proved that proving something is hard and proving something is easy makes it impossible to prove that thing.  It is impossible to prove that it is difficult to prove something  something is easy, since proving something is hard is impossible and proving something is  easy is proving something is impossible.  Since the last premise says that proving something is impossible means the opposite of that thing then by proving that it is impossible to prove something then we have also proved that whatever that thing is is possible.  Since proving something is  impossible is impossible then whatever it is that we have been talking about is possible.

{"text": "James might spend most of his time at the library\n\n### Explanation:\nThe question is asking what \"James\" might do, which as the writer is male so \"James\" could be a male.  We can say that he is most likely a student.  A student might go to university, college class, class room, classroom or the library to do his report. We cannot determine which so \"B\" is not a valid answer. We're not sure if he has any time to spend on any homework but in this case we do know that he has a report due, not a homework, so he might spend some of his time in class. Choice \"D\" mentions class but we're not sure if that is his own class or a class being held by another, so that isn't valid either.  Choice \"E\" mentions the library but we can assume that there are classrooms in the library, so we can cross that one off. That leaves choices \"A\" and \"C\" which both mention \"university\" and \"library\", both are valid answers.  \"C\" is the most likely however and would be the correct answer.  If we were to write out the question it would be \"Where might James who is a student possibly be going to write a report about his next book.\"", "answer": "E: library"}

{"text": "Which is to say - it doesn't matter which \"counter\" the treats are served from, it's the fact that the purchase is made at a counter which is relevant to the task. It is irrelevant whether people are referred to as \"kids\" or \"children.\" It is also irrelevant whether the treats are confectionary foods or something else, as long as they are things you can buy \"over a counter.\" The answer is 'D'\n\n### Demo:Both A and E say that the treats are being bought over an actual, physical, tangible counter. In B, \"the counter\" would be referring to the actual \"counter\" the meats are butchered on - which is not over the counter in the sense of a checkout. In D, people do not buy \"treats for kids\" in an actual physical place. People buy food from a kitchen. But in D, you aren't buying treats, you are buying the treats. Which is to say that a butcher shop and an auto repair shop are analogous to a kitchen. Kitchens do not buy treats. Kitchens make things. In the same way, auto repair shops and butcher shops don't buy things, because they themselves have nothing to buy them with. They are places that are given things to buy, and sell things, not the other way around. Because you never buy any thing from a butcher or automotive repair shop, you don't \"buy something over a counter.\" You go there to find something that has been bought over a counter and ask to have it made for you. Which is why A and E are incorrect.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe task asks the question which places buy things for you over a counter. Not which places you take things to buy over a counter. In D, you can buy food from a kitchen which is why a butcher shop and a kitchen are analogous for the purpose of buying treats. In the case of the butcher shop and the kitchen, they're the places of work where things are served over a counter.

The number of cubes in the box is 2 1/4  The smallest number they can arrange to add up to 9 is?\nAnswer: 9\n\n### Rational:You can arrange the cubes by adding the number on both sides of the cube. 3 on the left side and 3 on the right side equals 6, but 6 is greater than 6, so you add 9 (5) to both sides which equals 9.\n\n### Question:Each of the 8 students in Mrs. Miller\u2019s class received a score on a reading test between 56 and 86 points. After giving the students all the scores, it was noted that the 3 lowest scores were 27, 32, and 41. How many students were in the class?\n\n### Answer:13\n\n### Ration:The three lowest scores could only have been from 3 people. There were 8 people in the class. So there are 5 other people who all had to get a higher score. The possible values could be 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70,71(12 possibilities). Subtract 27 + 32 + 41 = 141 and then the total is 12 + 141 = 153. So there must have been 5 people who had to score a 62 or higher. However, 27, 41, or 65 have more people that have to get a score higher than that. Therefore the answer is 13 people.\n\n### Problem :The teacher is about to buy 18 packets of juice (juice packets) in all, and there is 50 cents for every six packets.

How many hoodies did we sell?\n\n### Justify (how we know this is the correct answer):\nWe sold 62 hooders and bought 62. We didn't keep track of the change so we need to use the fact that we sold $14 dollars worth more merchandise than $50 dollars worth. This means we paid $50.25 for 62.5 merchandise hoodies.\n\n### Solve (How we would solve this without the explanation):\n\nWe had to have sold 62, because it worked out by adding 25 cents. Adding 25 cents to every hoodie would only get you $62.5 worth of value since the rest of that dollar would add up to 42.5 cents that can be made on every additional item.\n\n### Explain how this problem works.\n\nIt's a multiple choice problem where you choose all of the options that apply to the problem instead of just one.\n\n### Provide another problem where choice would not matter.\n\nIf it wasn't a multiple choice problem where the answers were only", "answer": "E: meet"}

If he fills the snowmobile for $25 and the car for $1.80, how much is the cost per gallon of gasoline in cents?\n\nAnswer: 245\n\n### Input/Explanation:\nThe car uses fewer gallons. The difference is in price per gallon which is the same price for both cars. The gasoline price per gallon is 1.80 divided by 15.5 which is 11.5 cents per gallon. The car uses double what the snowmoblie uses, so the difference works out to 11.5 and 23. The car uses 80 gallons per season and the snowmobile uses 1600. 23 divided by 80 gives you.028571 or less if you round up..0285 multiplied by 2 is.057 and 71 cents per gallon is.571. You get the same answer.\n\n### Test Case\n245\n\n245 is the same because we have two gallons of car gasoline.  Each car gallon is 5.6 cents cheaper than the snowmobile. 5.6 times 2 which is 11 cents but we want the answer to be 12.1 cents since.1 is 12.1.\n\n### Multiple Choice\n\n\n\n### Multiple Answer", "answer": "B: fire"}

I may never get tired of home, but I know I am going to enjoy myself when I go on that vacation.\n### A\n\n### Instructor: Answer the following multiple choice question for me.\n\n### I had a great time during that business trip. Seeing my co-workers again and meeting many new people is always exciting. Now it is time for me to go home to my dog and my car which is clean and never runs out of gas. It will also be nice to get a good night's sleep every night. I may have felt comfortable at home when I was there before but there are many more dangerous and dirty places in this world and where else will I be feeling comfortable for my vacation?\n##\n### C: idel\n### Vacations are very important but I do not know that I want to get back on that plane any time soon. There are many good reasons to stay home after a trip as opposed to going home after a trip. For one, I can eat the food I want to on that trip after I have been away from home for a while.

The last thing that I can think of that home is is when nothing feels better than a good night sleep. And the last time I awoke with a really good", "answer": "A: outside"}

Write a program that will check the answers and print the correct ones and incorrect ones. You can use the format: {function} if you want and add extra information as well.\n\n### Hint:If you want to use the loop function, you will need to use a for loop and a while loop like the one shown below. These are some basic loops. However, you will need to learn a number of ways to write the for loop and the while loop. In addition, there are loops that contain other types of instructions that you can learn once you are familiar with the very basics, like the if statement which you will use to solve this problem.\n\n### While Loop:You can also use a while loop like the on shown below.

How long will it take me to make the cake?\n\n### Response : I think that the best solution for the task is \"half of the original amount/daily rate\".\n\n### Input I know that the ratio of boys to girls is 5:7, so I can subtract 7/5 from the total number of children in order to get only the number of boys. That allows me to make the ratio boys:girls 5:8. Then, since the ratio is boys:girls, I use the rule that \"the original amount + the increase equals the final amount.\" I can choose a percentage increase between 20-30, so I choose 25%. I know that the original amount of food per child is 97 cents, so I first calculate the new increase: I can use (the original amount (2x11)+(the increase))= (2x11) + (25%). This gives me a new food cost of 39$, the increase in the food cost will be (2x97) + (25%). In order to figure the final amount, use (the original amount of food (2x11)) + (the increase in food) = final food cost, which is 424 cents.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1.

{"text": "A\n\n### Comment Expansion: \nThe first line tells us that at least one of the options is correct. The next four statements describe the remaining options. We need to read the options carefully to notice the subtle difference among them.  If wood is called sanded, then it means it has been processed in some way to become smoother and easier to work with.  If wood changes into fossilized wood, then it means that it has not been processed in any way, instead, that its hardness has simply increased since it came from the ground.  We can eliminate answers B and D because compost refers to wood-chips and petrified wood does not mean that it has become harder through exposure to the ground but rather that is refers to the fossilization of a living tree. We'll leave answer E in, however, because petrify does not literally apply to fossilized wood, but instead refers more generally to the hardening of wood.\n\nIf wood is called composted, then it means that the wood's structure is more readily available and it might be easier to deconstruct and/or work with in some form.  If wood is composted and then becomes fossilized, then it becomes a solid and cannot be further worked with.  We can eliminate answer D because it does not make sense for that definition to have a logical consequence.  Answer A is correct because the word sanded is most closely tied to describing a processing of wood, and so we can assume that it indicates the same sort of action as compost.\n\nAnswer B states that warp describes the tendency for wood to have a warmer or cooler average temperature.  If wood is warped, then it means that its temperatures are not quite evenly distributed. If wood is hardened, then it means that part of it (its strength) has increased and thus its temperature is more evenly distributed.  We can eliminate this definition because hardening is the incorrect tendency of the wood.  Again we'll leave answer E because petrify does have a logical consequence and does make sense.\n\nAnswer C's statement suggests that hardening describes a more extreme state of hardening.  I'm not sure I agree with that. I'm guessing that hardening refers more to the solidity of the wood.  If wood is hardened and then becomes fossilizes in a warmer or", "answer": "E: petrify"}

How many people in 2015?\nA: 865\n\nAnswer: C: 808\n\n### Input2:There are 2 2-digit positive integers.  If you add the numbers and it is less than 100, then the sum of the numbers is odd.  For example, for the two numbers 63 and 58, you would get 63+58=121.  This is less than 120, so the sum of the two numbers is odd.  If the numbers that you add are also equal in value, then the sum of these numbers is even. For example, for the numbers 35 and 50, you would get 35+50=85.  So the sum of these numbers (85) is even.  There is another situation when the numbers add to 100.  If both the 2-digit numbers are such that if one is subtracted it is less than 50, then the sum is odd.  For this situation, you must add the digits, and the answer is always odd.  Suppose the first number is 78 and the second number is 92.  When you add 78+92, the answer is 170, which is more than 100. Therefore, 78+90=38 is less than 51. So the sum of 78 and 92 is odd.  So the answer to the question is that the sum of the two 2-digit numbers is either odd or even.

If we cut both sides diagonals into 2 equal pieces, they will form an isosceles triangle with the two equal sides measuring 1/2.  Since the original triangle had square sides, this also means that the new triangle has 2 square sides.  Now, we can take a square with one side the same size as an initial side in the right triangle, and cut that square\u2019s sides parallel to the sides of the original right triangle, forming a smaller right triangle.  Since this triangles is smaller by 1/2, the new triangle with square sides is made up of one fourth of the initial right triangle, as shown in this diagram:\n\nA: https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12VfYWsP4Q7vHMlOVgGZHXM_L8-03VsHvW-qLwkXE4Dc/edit?usp=sharing\nB: https://docs.talkyto.ai/@jay-dong/input49\n\nFor the initial right triangle, its angles can be determined using Pythagoras\u2019 theorem, as shown here:\n\nA: 2\u03b8+\u03c02=\u03c04\n\nB: 3\u03b8+\u03c02=3\u03c02\n\nSince the 2 is not there, this also means that \u03c02=2pi2.

{"text": "The most appropriate answer is that they are not currently attending school.\n\n### Input The following problem statement shows each step of a process. A: The amount of a deposit should be 25% of the current balance. B: The amount of each monthly payment should be equal to the amount of principal loaned. C: A finance charge of 9% of the principal is due at the end of the loan. D: The time to pay it off is 20% less than the given months. E: The monthly payments add up to $4213. F: The monthly payment is $922. Solution: The amount of the deposit should be $25% of the balance. If the interest rate is 9%, the amount owed is $4213 after interest and fees, and the monthly payment will be $922 per month for 25 months, then the amount owed after the monthly payment is $4216. After subtracting the payment of $922, the balance is $3294. Then dividing $2500 by 3294 would result in getting $25 as the amount owed.\n\n### Response\nThe most appropriate answer would be $25.

For A to be true, if I\u2019m forgiving, I should get a nice feeling and that\u2019s not necessarily a good thing. This is an unconscious act and most likely due to some sort of psychological trauma that was brought on, either by some sort of abuse or being mistreated, etc. B or good karma is a possibility but requires I have a very trusting and positive outlook on life to ensure I get the best benefit of it and it still won\u2019t be an easy process since it requires changing my way of thinking. C or the respect given to me is only possible by giving the forgiveness to obtain it, which will be another burden and hinderance if it is due to something that wasn\u2019t my fault, etc. D is the only good possibility, but that\u2019s only because I am releasing something that was never mine to begin with or I am giving it back to its rightful owner.

{"text": "Only answer B is correct: Direct traffic. \"Arming\" police and \"helping people\" are not typical duties. \"Finding drugs\" is not a traditional police duty. In fact, police almost never are directly involved in the pursuit of illegal drugs. Instead, such duties are assigned to an entirely different group known as Drug Enforcement Administration agents, whose entire reason for being is to find and arrest people who illegally manufacture and sell such substances.\n\nAs for \"boarding vessels,\" that task may not seem significant, but you have to consider that it could mean anything from a yacht to an oil tanker, and many of the activities of those vessels may affect the people the local police are responsible for protecting. If one is too slow, it could become dangerous to the shoreline and its inhabitants. If it's carrying hazardous materials, it could be dangerous to the inhabitants of the local community.\n\n### Inputs:The town has five volunteer firefighters. Each firefighter is on duty three days a week. The fire department rotates 24 hour, twelve-hour, and eight-hour shifts. Each firefighters works three different shifts every week. How many different shifts could three firefighters work if each was responsible for two shifts per week?\n\n### Response\n\nThe answer is nine shifts. The way to solve the problem is to begin by imagining three firefighters working three different shifts every one week. There are 24 firefighters, but we cannot use them because they each work every shift. After three weeks, we will have the same problem as in the problem statement. In order to avoid it, we will take every combination of firefighters working on a particular shift. So, the first combination would be firefighter 1 working a 12-hour shift on Monday and firefighter on duty on Friday. This is one combination. The second one would be firefighters 2 and 3 on duty Monday and Monday (and so on.). But why bother listing those two combinations? They can be combined to make only two more combinations, the first being firefighters 1, 2, 2, 3, and 3 (one possibility is a firefighter working the first and third shifts, the other a fire", "answer": "A: direct traffic"}

It is acceptable to use the definition provided earlier in the example.\n\n### Input-The term \u201cinfinite set.\u201d\n\nA: A set that is unending in size and not counted\n\n### Input A: A set that is always greater than any other number or sets.\n\nThe set of all prime numbers is infinite, because it is unending in size. Even though it might seem as this would never happen though, it is a well known set that exists.\n\nIt is also a set that is always greater in size than any other counting numbers since they add up one by one for as long as you need.\n\nIt is not a counting set since counting numbers are finite, but it is a part of the infinite set since it is the same thing, but bigger.\n\nThe set has always existed, since the earliest humans would have realized prime numbers existed through mathematics, and the very act of finding prime numbers would be included in the set.\n\n### Response-It is an infinite set because of it size. It goes on forever due to the way it is defined, it is a set of prime numbers, which means it is unending and always is greater than any other set or other counting or whole numbers. The set doesn\u2019t have an end because it goes on forever. Since the set is infinite it could have been there since forever, this includes the time that humans were the first to learn about it since it is the same set that numbers have always been about.\n\n### 10 Points-Which choice in option D best defines the term \u201cfinite set\u201d?

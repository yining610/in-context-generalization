If the canned pumpkins cost $1.00 less per can than canned corn, how much did each type of canned goods cost, in dollars, per can?\nOutput:\n```\nQuestion: A is the correct answer\n\n1. The grocery store has 36 boxes of corn.\n2. They also have 40 boxes of green peas at $1.80 each.\n3. They have 15 boxes of potatoes at $1.40 each.\n4. They have 2 boxes of pumpkins at $1.30 each.\n5. That's a total of $824.40.\n6. The math should break down as follows:\n7. 10 boxes of green pea at $0.60 *2 = $1.20\n8. 10 boxes can total $24 * 1.00 + $1.20 = $35.20\n9.

This increases the total sales tax paid as sales tax is assessed when products are sold and not afterwards.  By calculating the total sales tax, we found the price to be $22.28 as opposed to the incorrect answer of $21.11.\n\nInput: There were 2 times as many blue cars as red cars.

If the second program is correct then you will be able to test the third program as well. For every test case that you can successfully pass the program forward you earn a point. For every test case you fail however it counts down from 10 points. So if you can pass 5 tests you get ten points (all green). If you can pass 10 tests you get 5 points (all yellow). If you fail anywhere then you lose 1 point (all red). A successful test is any program that can pass every test case you can put in front of it.

{"text": "A, Campground\n\n#### **Further Explanation**\nInput: The car rental company charges $30 per day for car rental. But if you rent it for more than a week they reduce it to $190 each week.\nSince the reduction is $160 each week, the reduction is 160/30 which gives us 5, so $30 per day becomes $30 x 5 which equals $150, so if she rents it for 11 days she pays $150.\n\nIf she is renting it for more than a day, it's a week, and the week is more than 11 days so the answer is week, so for me the answer is 7.\n\nInput: Total time is 40 + 40 = 80.\n\nInput: She can either buy a house for 400 for 12 months, or she can live in apartment for less per month for each month that she rents it. So you are given that she can get the same 500 in 3 months in an apartment.\nSo she can figure out the price by subtracting 360 from her total bill 880. This is because you have to get the same amount in 3 months after getting rid of the 1st 3 months so she can only rent the house 3 months at a time to get the same amount, which you can figure out because 3 months = 91 days\n\nInput: 60 minutes divided by 60 seconds is 60. So it takes her 60/20 to go to town twice.\nSo we multiply it by 2 to give us hours. So 2 x 60/2 is still 60.\n\nSo for the year her total time will be 72 * 12= 864 hours.\n\nInput: It will take $3900/50= 78 dollars to get everything so each boy gets 78.\n\nInput: We want 500/39 + 115 \nSo our answer is (500/3 + 17.5)= 117.5\n\nThe rest is the remaining part that we subtracted from above.\nSo our answer", "answer": "E: backpack"}

In this case, TC = (cost of gas) + (cost of oil) = C x s, where C is the cost of gas and s is the number of miles the car travels with the gas filled.

You can find the LCM by taking all of the factors from each of these numbers and then multiplying the results together. Let\u2019s do an example \u2013 let\u2019s assume we have a series of numbers like 21, 45, 52, 67, __. The formula for finding the LCM is the same way we did with 2, 7 and 11.

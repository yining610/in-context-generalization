We do this by using the 12% = 0.12 fraction. The fraction is 3 / 25. This means that 12% is the same as 0.12 x 100 (Multiplying by 100 gets you to a percentage. Using this method you can find the answer to any fraction problem.\n\n<br><br>\n\nThe Second question asks us to find b. Our answer comes from the fact that the profit gained will be 92000 - 20000. This will give a profit of 72000. Now the profit will be divided between a and B. The ratio of the profit will be 92 : 20. Then we multiply the profit by 9 to 2. This means that the profit will be 52800 : 10000. Multiplying this by 2 will then give us 65600 : 2000 and dividing this by 2 will give us a ratio of 3300 : 1. The ratio between a and b will be 3300 and 1 which means that the profit will then be divided equally between a and B.\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\nThe third question tells us that the line will make 4 intersections with the x - axis.\n\n<br >\n<br\n\nThe fourth question tells us that the difference between 2 consecutive sales men will equal $ 3,014.75.\n\n<br /><br />\n<br />\n\nThe fifth question tells us that we will have 5 prime factors because it says that we multiplied 4 with itself 5 times.

Choices: A: 75 miles; B: 379 miles; C: 375 miles; D: 85 miles; E: I\u2019m sure there\u2019s an easier way to do this?\nOutput: C,\n\n#### Solution: To crack this kind of questions we can apply few rules one of them is \u201d If you know the rule then you must know the answer\u201d.\nIf we take the data given to us then we see something common that when ever we see a number is increasing then the next number can be calculated by multiplying the last number by 14 and if it is decreasing then we can get the next number by multiplying the last term with 14. So in this particular situation when we see a % increase than it is positive(13-12) and decrease is negative (-8.66-7.42) and the difference of it is 11.2(13 \u201312+13 -7.42). So in this problem 12 is the answer to which there is a 13% increase and 7.42 is the value which we get after calculating the percentage increase and decrease.\nIn second problem if we see the last 3 numbers then it will be -8, 0, 8. So it is clear that the second number has no increase or decrease. But for the last number it will have negative increase and positive increase. The first time it will increase by two and for the next time it will have the same value which decrease by one. So the last answer is 8 and second to the last is 6.\nIn third problem we just need to multiply the numbers by each other and subtract the last numbers. So for 12 and we have to multiply 25 with last number which is 13.\nIn fourth problem we just need to figure out that what is the difference between the first and the last number and to do that we multiply 3612 with the second number and subtract the answer from 3612.\nIn first,fourth and other problem we just need to take the values and to calculate the time taken to complete the task we just need to subtract first time or last time from the 15th second time", "answer": "C: shopping mall"}

{"idx": 856, "text": "D The term, \"get into trouble\" is a legal and colloquial term, which is commonly used with the phrase, \"get into.\" An individual can also get into trouble in the form of becoming aware of legal repercussion. Panic is a disruptive situation, which can potentially lead to getting into trouble. Mass hysteria in its more common context, is defined as a sudden irrational behavior caused by a general belief. It is the psychiatric term for a condition in which a large number of people simultaneously exhibit the same symptoms without a clear cause. These symptoms may include hallucinations, delusions, and generalized anxiety. No one, to date, has come up with anything that would cause mass hysteria in a group, and I'm fairly certain this is why panic usually isn't a consideration, as it can often produce a similar effect. Murder, however, could definitely get a person sent to prison or put him or her on the death-row.

Here, we multiplied the 12 by 100 because it was already in a percentage.\n\nb) Correct answer for this is b) 9.6 \n\nc) Here also we can use the percentage formula.\n\nWe know, that 11.2% of 12 is 1.36. Here x is 80.\n\n80/100 * 136/100= 9.6. The correct answer is 9.6 as well\n\nd) Here, we can solve by multiplying original amount and percentage as shown below.\n\na) 80 and 12 * 12 = \\$\\frac{80 \\times 12}{100 \\times 100}\\$ = x\n\nb) Now 11.2 * 12 * 2.5/100 = x\n\na=> 12.25\nb", "answer": "B: complete sentence"}

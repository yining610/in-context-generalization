In the book, In Cold Blood by Truman Capote, in the first chapter, he used an interesting method for describing a character. The author didn’t use a character description, but he used a character's action instead. He simply said the character came out of prison walking fast and wearing dark clothes in the cold morning. That method was very effective in the book. Because it described the character effectively and didn’t use too much words. Maybe, I can try your method by using a character's action to describe a character. Since I was very busy and have no time for describing characters. My action-based writing might help to finish the book even faster. "<n><n># Expectation<n>The instructions in the problem should be followed.

If each student has an equal number of pills, how many pills does each student have?<n>Rationales<n>16/3 = <<16/3=5>>5<n>Hank has 5 pills.<n>Mackenzie has 5 pills too.<n>Zoe has 1 left.<n>Zoe had half of the pills, 8 pills. Zoe then had the 4 pills left.<n><n>In words we can add two: 15 is 3 left, so there is 3 - 15 = <<3-15=12>>12 pills.<n><n>Hank has 1 pill left of 7 left.<n>There are 6 pills because Hank has a fraction, he has a part of 6 and has a part of 9. We want to divide the whole of 6 by the part of 9. This is the same as multiply 9 by 2, and you can put the part of 9 as a half, with a fraction bar, and you get, or you can get it as 2/3. The way 2/3 goes like that 2/4, so now, and it's like this, we want to divide the whole by the part, and it's 6/3. If you divide it out, it does become 2 /3, by multiplying 3 by 2.<n><n>#### 6<n><n>Answer: 6 for each student;<n><n>#### ##<n><n>Answer: 8 for Hank and he has 5 left;<n><n>####

The cost of selling an item at this point is 1/3 of the original price. For example, if you sell a car for $20,000 and the final price is $20,050, the cost of selling is 1/3*20,00 = $10,000. If you sell a bike for $150 instead and double the price to $300, the cost of sale is $150/3 = $50. The 2nd sale cost is always less than the 1st sale cost.<n><n>### Question<n>What is the cost to sell a toy at least once at the price of $7. 2 and more times at the price of $5.99?<n><n>###  Rationales<n>At $7.2, the cost to sell it once is $7.2 * 3/7 = $2.7.  and then $1.4 after that. <n><n># Tip: 3/7 is 0.4

This refers to the time one takes to wake up after sleeping.<n><n>Bill was probably tired and would wake up early because he didn't get to nap after the long flight the previous day. Bill felt groggy because he was tired, and didn't drink enough water to stay hydrated while traveling.<n><n>### Task: Answer the following questions using the correct math strategy<n>When you are asked to determine the time before the arrival time, it is advisable to convert the elapsed duration period into the time component. In as much as a certain amount of time has elapsed at any given duration period, it is good as to when it will happen in the future based on the time taken. Therefore, in arriving at the time component on a journey time, you only have to subtract the distance between two time zones. <n><n>### Input 2:A person drove 1,000 miles in the same city for a few days. Another person was driving 20 miles from the airport.The first person was 3 hours ahead. What would you expect the second person to be at?<n><n>### Response 2:When you use a clock, you don’t need to know to tell the time. You only have to be sure of the time elapsed, and you will be able to tell how it appears on the clock. Since one clock ticks each second, the elapsed hours depend on the amount of time elapsed. This makes it possible to determine the time and time zones in a journey time. <n><n>In this case, the person at the airport is three hours ahead. He will arrive at the destination six hours later after he had traveled a total of 1,006 miles. This means that he has 6 hours to travel 1,002 miles.<n><n>### Input B:There were 53 miles left in driving distance when the car stopped. How long was it broken down?<n>### Response B: When stopped in traffic, you won't know how long you will take for you to arrive at a certain mileage point. What you have to do is to estimate the miles that you will travel in a given duration period and arrive a new estimated destination. This means that in estimating how long it takes to

Choices:  A: train station B: house C: cupboard D: cricket stadium E: surface of earth<n><n>### Response:		If a person was standing directly under a plane, he or she would find air that had been breathed by that person. This is because the air that we breathe is constantly recycled, and reused over and over. Therefore, an air breathing station would be air recycled on a large scale, where large numbers of people breathe the same air. Since this station is being used by many people, it is the surface of the earth that would be the best place to find air recently breathed.<n>### Rationale: Air stations provide oxygen for large populations of people. Surfaces that people are currently walking on are also air breathing stations. Recycled air contains particles of carbon dioxide and other chemicals that we have just inhaled.<n>#### 1<n><figure><n><img src="https://i.imgur.com/EWrVo1y.png" alt="Air that has been breathed on recently" width="450"><n></figure><n><n>### Response 2:In what place could people find air that has been used recently but not recently breathed? Choices: 	A: airplane cabin B: balcony C: garden D: space station E: water fountain<n><n>### Rationale 2: Water fountains contain water that has recently passed through a plastic or metal pipe. This is an indicator of recent use but has not been breathed by anyone recently as opposed to train stations, where recently breathed air is often present. Air that has been recently breathed, but breathed by multiple people, is most likely to be found in the plane cabin.<n>#### 5<n><n><figure><n>	<img height="528" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.farmanddairy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/air-on-farm-680x515.jpg?resize=960%2C640" width="528"/><n>	<figcaption></figcaption><n></figure><n>

Which state’s population is 1/3 less than that of Illinois?<n>Illinois<n><n>### Response;A state’s population that is 1/3 of another state’s population is usually smaller than the large state. The U.S. Census Bureau (<https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2019/popest/state-total/2019-popest-total.html>) lists the population of Illinois in 2019 as 12.630 million. When this is divided by 3/3, 1/3, or 0.333, you get the population of the smaller state. Since there are already 3 decimal places in the 12.6 million, the smaller state population must be less than 2 million. The state of Ohio’s population is 28,035,745 in 2017. <https://www.cnn.com/2019>/news/fast-facts/ohio-facts>. This is less than half of Illinois’s population. Therefore, Illinois’s population is greater than Ohio’s population. The other states are smaller, so Illinois’s population is bigger.

He walked 16 meters and noticed that there was a traffic light. When the light turned green, the student crossed the street. It took him 14 minutes to cross the street. However, the student realized there was nothing to pick up in class and went home to the dorm. When he got home, he only walked 4.5 meters. How long did it take him to get from class to his dorm?<n><n>Rationales: First off, you need to add the steps. 16 + 14 + 4.5 = <<16+14+4.5=34.5>>34.5 steps it took him to travel from class to the dorm. Then, dividing the 34.5 by 2, then you can find how many minutes it took him to get home. << 34.5/2 = <<34.5/02=17.25>> 17 minutes and 25 seconds.<n>#### 17 minutes and twenty-five seconds<n>Answer: 17 mins and 25 seconds<n><n>### Question3:<n>The student went across the street.

In this case, the student must decide whether they cook breakfast together. It is wrong to say that they cook what together, since the cooking is not something that is acted upon by two people. <n><n>## How to make a video lesson:<n>To use the Video Lesson Builder, find a video lesson that you can add a quiz to and click **Add lesson to your account** underneath the video in your account:

He rode the bus 20 blocks to the post office to get some stamps. Later, he came home the same way. How many blocks did Pete travel in all?<n>Rationales: The number of blocks traveled on the way to the post office was 5 + 20 = <<5+20=25>>25.<n>Pete traveled 25 × 2 = <<25*2=50>>50 blocks in all.<n>#### 50<n>Answer: 50<n><n>Input: In a classroom, there are blue chairs, green chairs, and white chairs. There are 10 blue chairs. The green chairs are 3 times as many as the blue chairs, and there are 13 fewer white chairs than the green and blue chairs combined. How many chairs are there in a classroom?<n>Rationales: There are 10 x 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 green chairs.<n>The total number of blue and green chairs is 10 + 30 = <<10+30=40>>40.<n>So, there are 40 - 13 = <<40-13=27>>27 white chairs.<n>Therefore, there are 40 +27 = <<40+27=67>>67 chairs in a classroom.<n>#### 67<n>Answer: 67<n><n>Input: 4.5 gallons of coffee were divided among 18 thermoses.

Choices:  C a: 9, 2, b: 0, 1, c: 10, 1, d: 1, 0, e: 2, 1, f: 2, 0<n>Rationales: We know that 37.5mg were left after the sample water is removed so let’s say xmg were left. So 37.5-x = 0 and x = 37.5 So then what did xmg would be left. We already got the answer so let’s see if 0 9, 2 10, 0 1, 1 9, or 1 0 match the answer so 37.5 is a multiple of 2 then the sum of the rest should be a multiple of 2 because we cannot get an even number answer with an odd number. 15*2=30 and 15*3=40 so 2 and 3 did not fit. -------------- The answer is 1*2=2 and 1*0=0.<n><n>###Answer:<n><n>37.5m= 9+2-10+1-9+1-0=1 *2=2<n><n>And 37.5=20-10=1*0=0<n><n>###Input.  If you have 75 cents and want to spend no more than 25 cents, what fraction of your money does this leave? Choices:  a: 3/4, b: 7/8, c: 5/6, d: 9/10, e: 3/2<n>Input:<n>Rationales:<n>The sum of the cents is 75. And the spendable cents are 25 (because you could spend at most 25 cent). So let x be the number of cents. 75-x = 25 So then 75= 25+x And 75.25= 25 We get x.<n>Since 3/4 is not less

Mara has twice as many cards as Janet. How many cards do they have in all if Mara has 40 cards less than 150?<n>Rationales: Mara has 150 - 40 = <<150-40=110>>110 cards.<n>Janet has 110/2 = <<110/2=55>>55 cards since Mara has twice as many as Janet.<n>Brenda has 55 - 9 = <<55-9=46>>46 cards since Janet has 9 cards more than Brenda.<n>Therefore, they all have 110 + 55 + 46 = <<110+55+46=211>>211 cards.<n>#### 211<n>Answer: 211<n><n>Input: Pete walked 5 blocks from his house to the bus garage in Houston. He rode the bus 20 blocks to the post office to get some stamps. Later, he came home the same way. How many blocks did Pete travel in all?<n>Rationales: The number of blocks traveled on the way to the post office was 5 + 20 = <<5+20=25>>25.<n>Pete traveled 25 × 2 = <<25*2=50>>50 blocks in all.<n>#### 50<n>Answer: 50<n><n>Input: In a classroom, there are blue chairs, green chairs, and white chairs. There are 10 blue chairs. The green chairs are 3 times as many as the blue chairs, and there are 13 fewer white chairs than the green and blue chairs combined. How many chairs are there in a classroom?<n>Rationales: There are 10 x 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 green chairs.<n>The total number of blue and green chairs is 10 + 30 = <<10+30=40>>40.<n>So, there are 40 - 13 = <<40-13=27>>27 white chairs.<n>Therefore, there are 40 +27 = <<40+27=67>>67 chairs in a classroom.<n>#### 67<n>Answer: 67<n><n>Input: 4.5 gallons of coffee were divided among 18 thermoses. Genevieve drank 3 thermoses. How many pints of coffee did Genevieve drink?<n>Rationales: 4.5 gallons = 4.5 * 8 pints = <<4.5*8=36>>36 pints<n>36/18 = <<36/18=2>>2 pints<n>Genevieve drank 2*3=<<2*3=6>>6 pints of coffee.<n>#### 6<n>Answer: 6<n><n>### Input:What might be the result of a season of successful skiing? Choices:  A: finish line B: broken bones C: broken legs D: chapped lips E: healthy body<n><n>### Response:		 C<n><n>#### 1 and 4<n>Rationales:<n><n>A: There are two reasons that you would use 1 and 4. I think they are both logical conclusions to 3 and 5 <n><n>B: <n><n>C:<n>1. chapped lips could be the result of outdoor activity, not necessarily skiing.<n>1. Skiing could cause broken legs not just broken bones.  For example, falls on ice might cause broken bones, broken legs, chapped lips, cut, and possibly even broken arms in addition to broken bones. <n>1. Skiing does not necessarily require a broken bone <n><n>1. A broken bone might result from skiing, but that is not all that comes from skiing.<n>2. I did not mention skiing at home.  I specifically said “season”.  So, broken bones at home wouldn’t be an option.<n><n>5.<n><n>D:<n>1. This is an example of when 1 and 4 could not be used instead of 1 and 4 as it is the least likely choice because this question is asking about skiing. <n>3. Also,  a healthy body is not about skiing as much as it is about being in good shape.  A healthy body and finishing line are not as closely related as broken bones and chapped lips. <n> <n>E:<n>1. Includes all the points from 1 and 4 from A and B but with more of a focus on outdoor activity.<n>4. As a result of a successful season of skiing, you would most likely be “in good physical condition”.  Again, being healthy isn’t directly linked with successful skiing. <n>

How can riding a bike to school help you reach the required exercise for daily life?<n><n>### Response:"Riding a bike to go to school helps in a number of ways as it promotes health and fitness. Also, it is also a cost-effective mode of transportation. These days parents are often too busy to drop and pick up kids and so they are inclined to offer rides or drop by themselves and drive your kid to school. This is where the importance of riding a bike comes in. In such cases, you feel your life is easier as you can park and lock up your bike and proceed to work. You may also do yoga and exercise in a park on the way to work. With your bike ready when you return from work, you do not waste time hunting for a parking space or waiting for your transport."<n><n>### Input"A person with brown skin, brown eyes, and brown hair may not have the same skin tone, hair color, or eye color as someone with brown skin, blue eyes, and brown hair. What is true for them both?<n><n>### Rationales"People with brown skin, brown hair, and brown eyes both tend to inherit their skin tone, haair color, and eye color from the same ancestral lineage. The skin tone usually represents the tone of melanin in the skin, while hair color is the shade of melanin in hair, and eyes color is the shade in the eyeball. Hence, both brown-haired and brown-eyed-brown-eyed people will always have a brown skin tone."<n>  <n>### Rationale"Though the color of the skin, hair, and eyes vary from person to person, what these people have in common is their ancestry. Both brown-haired and eyed-people are brown-skinned. Therefore, it is fair to say that a person with brown skin, blue eye color, and brown hair may possess the identical gene that may manifest in different combinations. In short, even though the inheritance of skin tone, eye color, and hair color vary within the genetic pool of the family, they all share a common genetic inheritance which is the same as brown haired and brown eyed

A shopping bag would not be used there.  A shopping area contains many shopping bags.  Therefore, a shopping bag would be found in a Mart.<n><n>### Input<n>A: 15.2 miles B: 854 hours C: 6.6 pounds D: 834.2 gallons E: 14.7 grams<n><n>### Answer<n><n>### Rationale:The only two numbers that begin with 6. are 6 and 60.<n><n>## Input:<n><n>You work in a factory, 16 hours each day, from Monday through Saturday.

We then take those 24 (or 12) and divide it by 360 (24 x 12 / 360 = 12) minutes. This tells us that you get 6 minutes of free time (or 108 minutes) each day.<n><n>While this method is correct, my concern is the logic behind it. Most students take the logical route (such as 5 X 7 = 35, meaning they miss the free time in the morning, and the time in the afternoon). This will cause questions like these to trip up students.<n><n>#### Rationales:<n><n>1) 5 x 7 = 38.6 minutes.<n>2) 10 x 2 = 20 minutes.<n>3) 12 x 3 = 36 minutes.<n>4) 15 x 4 = 60 minutes.<n>5) 18 x 5 = 90.<n>6) 20 x 6 = 120.<n>7) 24 x 7 = 168.<n>8) 27 x 8 = 2

If the hen is hungry and does not get enough food, it may take a longer time for the egg to hatch. If the bird sits on an egg, it can hatch only one egg in an hour of sitting.<n><n>## Rationales: If we add 30 minutes to the sitting time, the overall time increases to 30 minutes + 1 hour = <<30+1=40>>4o minutes.<n>If the hen is hungry but gets enough food, then the time to hatch increases to 30 +40 = <<30+40=70>>70 minutes.<n>If the bird sits on the egg, there needs to be two more eggs (because it takes about an hour to hatch one egg. 1*2=<<1×2=2>>2 eggs per hour of sitting<n>If the hen is not hungry because it is fed the right foods, then there is no change in the total time to hatch.<n>So the final time to hatch depends on the overall situation regarding the hungry and fed hen and the two eggs per hour of sitting times. So, overall, there are three situations that lead to four different times to hatch, which are: <n><n>(1) 110 minutes (when the hen is hungry; it takes 30 minutes to hatch one egg, and it needs 40 minutes to hatch the eggs once it sits on them)<n><n>(2) 100 minutes (when the hungry hen is fed with the right food to keep its body well fed; it takes 35 minutes to hatch one of the eggs, and the hen needs 25 more minutes to hatch the other egg)<n><n>(3) 90 minutes (when an adequately fed hen sits on 2 eggs that take 1 hour

Since, there were 1 1/15 litres more in the original bottle of wine, the bartender added this to the 2 1/5 liters bottled wine. And also, since the ratio did not change, I came to conclusion that, by adding the ratio-wise, the bartender increased the total bottle to 3 liters.<n><n>Answer 2: Bartender did not pour wine.

The rubber balls stay put when he picks them up. There is no motion in this system. So the correct answer is "B".<n><n>#### 3.<n>If the rubber balls are lying on a horizontal surface (one resting on top of the other), James picks them all up.

The rubber balls all move when he picks them.<n><n>#### 5.<n>James starts with his rubber balls lying on a horizontal surface. A horizontal surface is the one resting on top of another horizontal surface. James picks up the rubbed balls lying on the horizontal surfaces, and all of them move around at the same time, so the rubber balls are in motion. He is therefore awake, and the rubber balls are “active”. Therefore, the correct answer is “active”.<n><n>#### 6.<n>James starts with the rubber balls lying in the horizontal surface. When he wakes up, He can either leave the rubber balls lying, or pick them up and put them on the ground. However, if he picks them up the rubber balls end up lying on the ground.

Choices:  A: outside B: vacation C: idle D: apartment E: neighborhood<n><n>### Response:		<n>My answer is - A outside, not A outside, B vacation, A vacation, A outside.<n><n>### Justification:<n>A is the only choice that is not in the text. - A outside. This is not in the text and should be eliminated. - B vacation, My answer is B vacation, the text says comfortable which is a adjective. "Home" is a noun that the adjective is modifying. I chose B, so I have to eliminate C because it's not in the text. I have to eliminate E because home is not modifying the word apartment so D is eliminated.<n><n>### Input - Question 1: Mary, Sarah, and Kathy each received 25 cards.<n>The question is: How many cards, in all, were given? Choices: - A. 50 cards. - B. 60 cards. - C. 75 cards. - D. 100 cards. - E. More than 100.<n><n>### Response-<n>The question does not have a good word choice and structure so I am unsure of the word and structure, so I would either write - "Mary, Sarah and Kathy each received ____ cards. Their total number of cards was ____. or - "_____ cards were given to Mary, Sarah, and kathy. Their total number of was ___."<n><n>### Justify:<n>The number of cards given is written in the middle of the question. I have to explain why the answer is D. I will explain to the grader that D is correct because there are total of 3 people and one person can make the total amount of the cards. This means that Mary can give them 15,15 and 15 = 45. Kathy can give them 10, 10, 5 = 35 and Sarah can give them 1,1,1 = 4 total. We can break it down so we multiply it with 3 because there are 3 people. We can solve this using 3*15, or 3*35, or 35. The choice D, is closest the answer and should be the correct choice<n><n>### Input : How did the number of words in the dictionary change from 485,139 in 1961 to

Choices:  A: bathroom B: closet C: school D: room E: church<n><n>### Response:		 B<n><n>### Rationales: The college kids used their bathroom as a bedroom, hence bedroom was not an option.<n>The question's options included a bathroom, a school closet, a room, a church, and a school. Although the kids "weren't known for" (and were "not known for") their "decor choices," the kids had a bedroom and a bathroom in a shared room. The kids used the bathroom as a bed. So they used a bathroom as a bed, which is a room in a college bathroom. Hence: closet. The kids used a _closet_ as a bedroom. However, they could not have used a bed as a closet because they had a bedroom. The kids did not use a room. They used a bedroom. Therefore they did not use _a_ room. The kids might have used a church as a bedroom or closet, but the question said they did not use a room for the bed, meaning they only used the bathroom as the bedroom or the closet. Therefore, they did not use the bathroom or the closet as a room. Thus, they had not used a room to house a bed, which eliminates _room_ as a possible answer to the question. Thus, the answer was bathroom or closet.<n><n>#### 1 - B<n>Answer: B<n><n>### Instructions for teachers:<n><n>* Provide the students with a description of a task.<n><n>* Provide several options as choices to demonstrate the answer.  <n><n>### Additional Resources<n>* [The answer is here](https://mathriddles.wu.edu/solution/53)

Choices:  A: grocery store B: nightstand C: armpits D: own bathroom E: medicine chest<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>### Why:<n>I used the word "look" in the word problem, not the words "put" or "find" which are used in instruction.<n><n>### Rationale:<n>When you use a definition to prove something, it must follow the format of Definition, Theorem, Proof. If you do prove something and leave out a step, then it is wrong. I don’t understand how something like that can be marked as incorrect.<n><n>### Example:If you define a line segment as being two segments that join at one endpoint, then you can call any line a line segment. If you call any segment that can be traced as a line a line, then you can prove that if you have two points, you can trace a straight line.<n><n>### There are a bunch of similar questions to the first one, and they all seem to have the same issue in how the question is worded, which is that the word "put" is substituted for the word "look". But they all ask the same question "Where did his wife (or husband or whoever) ask him to look first" (so this is my assumption). So it seems like an odd oversight on the part of the person writing the test.<n><n>### Input for the final question:When can you move the decimal point in rational numbers without changing the value of the rational number? Choices:  a: when dividing by a factor smaller than ten b: when multiplying by a factor less than or equal to ten c: both when dividing by a smaller factor and multiplying by a smaller factor d: neither a nor b<n><n>### Response for the final question:C<n><n>### Why<n>The answer is both. You must move the decimal point when dividing by a number less than ten to achieve the same value of the dividend (divide by 4, move decimal point to right. Divide by 4 again to get the same number = 0.25). When dividing by a number between 10 and 90, you must move the decimal point left a number of places equal to the number of zeros after the decimal point (move decimal point 3 places to the right). Similarly, you must multiply by a number less than or equal to 10 to achieve the same quotient as in your original multiplication (multiplying by 4 to get the same number as before, 0

The name "theatre" is derived from the Ancient Greek θέατρον (théatron, "[structure] with spectacle, seeing place"). In the last few centuries, the use of theatre has spread, and its meaning has narrowed to the performing arts and, occasionally, to films or television.<n><n>## What are the questions you will be answering tomorrow?

One possible way is to use a division algorithm to find 6/2 and 15/3.

Multiply the numerator by 6 to get 9.0, for which the denominator is 6. So: 9/6 ≈ 11.<n><n>### Solution:<n>1. The input consists of two lines. The first line reads "<name> always <verb>[talks, eats, drinks, looks, listens] to her as if she</verb>:<adj>[stupid, intelligent, old, young, weak, strong, etc.]".

For example: "as if you were... (stupid, intelligible, old, young, etc.)" suggests that that the speaker talks to you as someone who is younger, dumber, and weaker than you.<n><n>   Also, "You are advised" suggests that in this task, you're asked to write out two solutions, so as to choose the most correct one.<n><n>   I added the red highlights to distinguish between the two lines.<n><n>2. It's easier to answer this question if you use the full names of the people in the sentences instead of using the short forms. (For example, "you" instead of "u".)<n><n>3.

Thus, we can eliminate choices A,B,D and E. For the first three, which two choices are associated with hot weather? One way to distinguish choices B and C is to consider the unit of measurement. In B, New Mexico is a state whose name contains a state abbreviation (nm). Therefore, New Mexico has a larger scope than White House. Thus, it is likely a larger scale of place where snakes would want to live. The last answer is garden of eden which is an animal habitat. The unit of measurement is not given in the question.

Choices:  A: mediate B: have rest C: stay in bed D: run out of steam E: go to sleep<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>__A__ is the only way to recover from exhaustion. If you stay in bed and only do that when you sleep, you won’t recover from your exhaustion and you will not be able to do the things you need to do. If you go out for a run, you will become more exhausted and unable to do the things you want to do.<n>>__B__ is not an effective way to recover from exhaust, if you sleep in you will still be exhausted. If you need to take a nap and relax, that is not the same thing as recovering from exhaustion. If meditation does not help you recover from your exhaustion you are probably doing it wrong.<n>>__C__ is not a good way to recover from exhaust. If you take rest and sleep all day you will not regain your energy. This will make you more exhausted and you will have fewer energy to get things done.<n>>__D__ is not a recover method. When you deplete all of your strength you will have no energy. If you do this all day while running around you will eventually become even more exhausted.<n>>__E__ is one of the best ways to recover from exhaustion but it is only once a day if you have been exhausted for days you will not recover that day. If you only have one day of rest, staying up all night until you need rest again will make you much more tired the next day. If you need several days of rest to recover it is better to take those days.<n>####__A__<n>Answer: _A_ is the only way to recovery from exhaustion. If sleeping in, staying in bed, etc. _B_ if you stay in bed and sleep all the time _C_ if you leave everything till the last minute _D_ if you never quit _E_ will not help you.<n>

He was recently offered a raise of $200 per month. After seeing this, he made a promise to himself to pay down both of his loans as quickly as he possibly could.<n><n>  However, since the raise was only of $200 each month, he had to determine what the best usage of the money would be to pay down the loan. He did some calculations and found that he could pay off $16,500 in 22 months if he put the money toward the loans instead of buying a few things with it.<n><n>### Question :<n>1) If he did

In how many different orders can these people be lined up?<n><n>### Demnstration:<n>For the lined up order "6 males, 4 girls, and 2 kids" and the lined up order “6 females, 4 cats, and 2 males”, we're looking at the difference, which is 1. If we make this our variable, we can put in our solution by taking the difference, since “two is the same” but “1 isn’t the same”. Now, we just need to add this into our original problem to solve it, and that’s where “and” comes into play. We’re lining each group up with the previous group, and the last group has only the two kids in it, so we just need to add the two kids to the end, since it’s only 2. Now let’s look at how we can work those problems out. Here’s an example with males:<n><n>Male:4 Female:4  <n>Male:5 Female:3  <n>..  <n>Male:10 Female:4 <n><n>As you can see, the only difference in the way that they’re lined up is the females. You can do that with any group, once you get the variables to get the answer that you need to.<n>#### 7<n>### Instruction Answer:Input: A family owned an apple orchard that had 200 trees. Every tree produced a specific number of apples. The father owned 32 of the trees; the mother owned 13 more than the father. The grandmother owned 4 fewer than the mother, and the grandfather owned 79 times as many trees as the grandmother. How many apples did all the trees in the orchard produce altogether?<n><n>#### Rational:<n>The father had 32 trees, which is 32 x 4 = <<32*4=128>>128 apples<n>The mother had 13. Now, our original problem doesn’t say that she had 13 trees, so we need to take 13 away from 128

If there were 7 boys and an odd number of girls, then the number must be 3, 5, or something other than 7.  The odd number of girls must be 3, and there were not 3 girls in the classroom.  The difference between 17 and 7 is not an odd number, since there are 9 fewer boys than girls.  Therefore, the difference between an odd number and each other number is 2, except 7, so 7 - (odd number) = 1.<n><n>The final result of the calculation is 19 - 7 = <<19-7=12>>12 girls and 7 boys.<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input3: 1/8 of the money left in your mom's purse is $7.25.

This is like saying that we have 20 pieces, and we also have 15 - like we have 15 blocks out of the original 20 blocks. By taking 15 blocks out we are down 5 blocks - so we have 15 - 5 which is 10 pieces left over. <n>Correct answer: 15

C: The speed of light is 62340 kph D: The speed of speed limit is 25 miles per hour.<n> <n>### Response<n>For the first option, the speed of any object can be described by v = d/t, meaning that you take the total distance traveled over the total time this distance is traveled. From the equation, we know that v = d/t.<n>For the second option, the speed of light can be described the same way. When describing the speed of light, we are simply taking the total distance that light can travel over the time a single light ray covers that distance. So, the speed of light = d/t = light years per second For the third option, the speed limit can also be represented by v = d/T, meaning that you take a specific distance and then multiply that distance by the time it takes to complete that distance at a rate of travel. From the equation, you can see that v =d/t, but here, you have substituted miles/hour for t, since the speed limit refers to vehicles traveling at this speed. When describing the speed limit, the distance is taken is a single mile, meaning that the speed limit = d/t = miles traveled per hour<n><n>### Input A: how many minutes in a year B: how many miles in a year<n><n>### Response A: 60 minutes in a year<n><n>B: 525,600 miles in a year<n>

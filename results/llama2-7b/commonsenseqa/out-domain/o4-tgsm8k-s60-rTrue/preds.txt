We know the number of people and the number of dogs, so we can substitute p with the number of pizza slices to get this equation:<n>```<n>p = 3<n>D = 2<n>```<n><n>Then we'll just solve for x. So, all we'll do is divide:<n>```<n>6 p = (3 + 2) x<n>```<n>Since we're not trying to answer D, we'll solve for x. Now we have:<n>```<n>6 x = 5 x<n>```<n>And we know the x's cancel. So, we have:<n>```6 = 5```<n>6 * 5 doesn't work, because of that, we can subtract 1:<n>```5 = 4```<n>So, 5 slices is the answer. Since there are 3 people, they each received 1 slice of pizza. Since there are 2 dogs, the two dogs combined to receive a slice of pizza.<n><n>Input: When you go down three flights of stairs, how many flights of stairs are there left to go?<n>Output: There is one flight of stairs.<n>So the final Result is the D<n><n>Input: What color is the car?

This means that either of the resulting head or tails will have an equal probability to come up in a coin toss. In other words, there is a 50% chance for a head to come up and a 50% for a tail to come up as well.<n><n>Assume there is some biasedness of the coin so that there is a bias towards heads over tails. Let H be heads and T be tails. The bias in favour of H over T means that p1=c1, p2=c2, and p=0.5. However, for the biased coin, we have:<n><n>	p1=1-p2,
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Janet has 9 cards more than Brenda. Mara has twice as many cards as Janet.

Choices: A: pass water B. Bathe C.listen to each other D. Feel pleasure E. Reproduce asexually<n>output: the correct answer is pass water, because the animals weren'tre producing that much babies, so it wasn'thaving sex. And b'cause animals can't listen to each other, if they did they would drown, also animals don't pass water, it would make them sick and throw up. And the animals do want to feel pleasure, which means they shouldn't bathe either. Animals can't hear themselves they can't talk to each other, also if they could the water would make noise and it would make it harder for the animals to pass water

I enter the address into a route planner by typing it out letter by letter in this format: street, house number, street name, city, and country. When I typed the address, the route planner correctly interpreted "street, streetname, city, country": but interprets "Street, City, Country" as a city name: The city name was entered incorrectly. By chance, I was in the city when I typed in the address. However, I was on this particular address and could not have gotten there by random chance: the city name is wrong. How is this possible?<n>Output: The problem is that you are wrongly entering the data. A route planner cannot interpret a street, city, and country as a single address in one input. What you have been entering is an address with an incomplete house number that the route planner correctly interprets to be a city name. That is why you were able to visit all your street addresses.<n>The correct format of an address should be<n>street name, city, country, house number.<n><n><n>

'F' refers to feet, so it is inaccurate. <n><n>Output:'h' is the correct answer, as 'h' means the hunter, which refers to hunting, which is inaccurate for the context of the image. 'i' refers to the eye, and 'w' refers to the week, so those are also not correct answers.<n><n>Input: Anita and Betty have 10 cookies between them. Betty has 1/3 of Anita's cookies. If both cookies from A and B are halved, how many people get a cookie?<n>Output: Anita has 1/3 = <<1/3=>6>>6 cookies before halving.<n>10-6 = <<10-6=4>>4  The first 4 cookies went to Anita, and the other 4 went to Betty. In the second half, 2 cookies were left for Anita and Betty. Now, 4  + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 cookies went to Anita and Betty.<n>So, the number of cookies that went to each person were 6/2 = <<6/2=>3>>3 cookies.<n>Hence, each person was given 3 cookies each in the 2nd round of halving.

Choices:  A: michigan B: stable C: race track D: farm yard E: arizona<n>Output:		Fences are a horse‚Äôs worst enemy, as they represent the restriction of where the horse can go. In Arizona or Florida, the equine population is dense, and the grassland is well maintained. To be in the area, one need not own acres of land, but perhaps a portion of a stable. At a horse farm, one would have the benefit of being around many horses. These animals, with their similar personalities, can be best friends and soulmates, creating a bond which is impossible to replace. These animals are often taken to be groomed and/or exercised, depending on the owner‚Äôs preferences. They are also taken to local events, like rodeos, where the animals compete against others at a competitive level. In this way, these horses get to do what they were born to do. So the final answer is horse farm yard

To gain something valuable requires a lot of work and commitment, just as being patient, hard working, and determined. You can‚Äôt win the lottery without hoping and praying, you can‚Äôt find the perfect house without looking for days (or weeks, or months). You can find a better job by improving your resume and going to interviews which requires a good amount of commitment and dedication. To save money you'll have to stick to a budget and put aside some money each paycheck - that takes determination. And to feel safe, you need to do whatever you can to feel safe. You can call the police, invest in an alarm system, install window locks and maybe even hide under your bed like a little child.<n><n>Input:Judy wanted to plant flowers and create a beautiful garden but first needed to understand how much water a plant needed in order to survive. She found a resource online that gave information about the water requirements and care of certain plants. She found that the lavender plant needed 219 gallons and the black-eyed-susan plant needed 653 gallons of water each week. Judy knows that she can only water her plants once a week, but which plant would she need to water more? Choices: 2. The lavender plant <n>18. The lavender plant doesn't need much water so watering it more often won't help it live longer. 3.

Every day, there are a large number of tourists on the island, and a large number of tour buses carrying them in and out of the island. The tour bus drivers use these five brooks to drive in and out of the islands. They drive them in order from north to south (n-5), north to south (2-5), north to north (3-5), south to south (1-3), and south to south (6-5). If they drove one of them last on a bus before they drive the others next on a bus, how many buses did they drive the other four one after the other?<n><n>Output: The answer is E because we drive two of them one after the other which means if our answer was true then we would have driven 6-5 after 1-3 but how does that make sense because they drove those numbers last we would drive 6-5 first meaning we only drove 6-5 once on a bus not 2 times and if we kept making that out of order then we would have driven the others first then 6-5 and if we drove the first ones 6-5 then drove the second ones then drove those we did not drive the

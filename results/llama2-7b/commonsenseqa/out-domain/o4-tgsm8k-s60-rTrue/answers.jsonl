What fruit did I pick up? Choices: A.oranges B: bananas C: apples D: apple bananas E: oranges\n\n### Response A:Bananas\n\n### Ratione:The option that should be marked as the given should be the one in your grocery bag.\n\n### For example:\nI have 3 apples,  6 bananas, and 5 oranges in my grocery bags. What fruit Did I pick up?\n\nAnswer: Apples because that choice is among the ones in the grocery bag. Therefore, 5 is the sum of all the apples, bananas, oranges.\n\n### It can also be expressed in the language of equality.\n\nI have 3 + 6 + 5 == 14 =<<=14=2 bananas > 3 apples.\n\nTherefore, I picked up apples.\n\n### The sum of the bananas - 5 is 3, the sum of 5 oranges - 6, and the sum of 3 apples - 3.\n\n### That is equivalent to 5 + 5+2==12 \n\nTherefore, the answer 15 - 15+2", "answer": "A: burlap sack"}

Bill felt groggy because he was tired, and didn't drink enough water to stay hydrated while traveling.\n\n### Task: Answer the following questions using the correct math strategy\nWhen you are asked to determine the time before the arrival time, it is advisable to convert the elapsed duration period into the time component. In as much as a certain amount of time has elapsed at any given duration period, it is good as to when it will happen in the future based on the time taken. Therefore, in arriving at the time component on a journey time, you only have to subtract the distance between two time zones. \n\n### Input 2:A person drove 1,000 miles in the same city for a few days. Another person was driving 20 miles from the airport.The first person was 3 hours ahead. What would you expect the second person to be at?\n\n### Response 2:When you use a clock, you don\u2019t need to know to tell the time. You only have to be sure of the time elapsed, and you will be able to tell how it appears on the clock. Since one clock ticks each second, the elapsed hours depend on the amount of time elapsed. This makes it possible to determine the time and time zones in a journey time. \n\nIn this case, the person at the airport is three hours ahead. He will arrive at the destination six hours later after he had traveled a total of 1,006 miles. This means that he has 6 hours to travel 1,002 miles.\n\n### Input B:There were 53 miles left in driving distance when the car stopped. How long was it broken down?\n### Response B: When stopped in traffic, you won't know how long you will take for you to arrive at a certain mileage point. What you have to do is to estimate the miles that you will travel in a given duration period and arrive a new estimated destination.

{"text": "If a person was standing directly under a plane, he or she would find air that had been breathed by that person. This is because the air that we breathe is constantly recycled, and reused over and over. Therefore, an air breathing station would be air recycled on a large scale, where large numbers of people breathe the same air. Since this station is being used by many people, it is the surface of the earth that would be the best place to find air recently breathed.\n### Rationale: Air stations provide oxygen for large populations of people. Surfaces that people are currently walking on are also air breathing stations.

The U.S. Census Bureau (<https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2019/popest/state-total/2019-popest-total.html>) lists the population of Illinois in 2019 as 12.630 million. When this is divided by 3/3, 1/3, or 0.333, you get the population of the smaller state. Since there are already 3 decimal places in the 12.6 million, the smaller state population must be less than 2 million. The state of Ohio\u2019s population is 28,035,745 in 2017. <https://www.cnn.com/2019>/news/fast-facts/ohio-facts>. This is less than half of Illinois\u2019s population.

He walked 16 meters and noticed that there was a traffic light. When the light turned green, the student crossed the street. It took him 14 minutes to cross the street. However, the student realized there was nothing to pick up in class and went home to the dorm. When he got home, he only walked 4.5 meters. How long did it take him to get from class to his dorm?\n\nRationales: First off, you need to add the steps. 16 + 14 + 4.5 = <<16+14+4.5=34.5>>34.5 steps it took him to travel from class to the dorm. Then, dividing the 34.5 by 2, then you can find how many minutes it took him to get home. << 34.5/2 = <<34.5/02=17.25>> 17 minutes and 25 seconds.\n#### 17 minutes and twenty-five seconds\nAnswer: 17 mins and 25 seconds\n\n### Question3:\nThe student went across the street. He walked 14.5 meters and he realized he forgot his wallet. So he crossed the other street. It took him exactly 5.5 minutes. How far did he travel?", "answer": "A: sun himself"}

Choices:  a: 3/4, b: 7/8, c: 5/6, d: 9/10, e: 3/2\nInput:\nRationales:\nThe sum of the cents is 75. And the spendable cents are 25 (because you could spend at most 25 cent). So let x be the number of cents. 75-x = 25 So then 75= 25+x And 75.25= 25 We get x.\nSince 3/4 is not less", "answer": "E: judge"}

{"text": "B\n\n### Input:\"You may get a lot of exercise by walking to school, but you can also get exercise by cycling to school.\" How can riding a bike to school help you reach the required exercise for daily life?\n\n### Response:\"Riding a bike to go to school helps in a number of ways as it promotes health and fitness. Also, it is also a cost-effective mode of transportation. These days parents are often too busy to drop and pick up kids and so they are inclined to offer rides or drop by themselves and drive your kid to school. This is where the importance of riding a bike comes in. In such cases, you feel your life is easier as you can park and lock up your bike and proceed to work. You may also do yoga and exercise in a park on the way to work. With your bike ready when you return from work, you do not waste time hunting for a parking space or waiting for your transport.\"\n\n### Input\"A person with brown skin, brown eyes, and brown hair may not have the same skin tone, hair color, or eye color as someone with brown skin, blue eyes, and brown hair. What is true for them both?\n\n### Rationales\"People with brown skin, brown hair, and brown eyes both tend to inherit their skin tone, haair color, and eye color from the same ancestral lineage. The skin tone usually represents the tone of melanin in the skin, while hair color is the shade of melanin in hair, and eyes color is the shade in the eyeball. Hence, both brown-haired and brown-eyed-brown-eyed people will always have a brown skin tone.\"\n  \n### Rationale\"Though the color of the skin, hair, and eyes vary from person to person, what these people have in common is their ancestry. Both brown-haired and eyed-people are brown-skinned. Therefore, it is fair to say that a person with brown skin, blue eye color, and brown hair may possess the identical gene that may manifest in different combinations. In short, even though the inheritance of skin tone, eye color, and hair color vary within the genetic pool of the family, they all share a common genetic inheritance which is the same as brown haired and brown eyed", "answer": "C: own family"}

If the hen is hungry and does not get enough food, it may take a longer time for the egg to hatch. If the bird sits on an egg, it can hatch only one egg in an hour of sitting.\n\n## Rationales: If we add 30 minutes to the sitting time, the overall time increases to 30 minutes + 1 hour = <<30+1=40>>4o minutes.\nIf the hen is hungry but gets enough food, then the time to hatch increases to 30 +40 = <<30+40=70>>70 minutes.\nIf the bird sits on the egg, there needs to be two more eggs (because it takes about an hour to hatch one egg. 1*2=<<1\u00d72=2>>2 eggs per hour of sitting\nIf the hen is not hungry because it is fed the right foods, then there is no change in the total time to hatch.\nSo the final time to hatch depends on the overall situation regarding the hungry and fed hen and the two eggs per hour of sitting times. So, overall, there are three situations that lead to four different times to hatch, which are: \n\n(1) 110 minutes (when the hen is hungry; it takes 30 minutes to hatch one egg, and it needs 40 minutes to hatch the eggs once it sits on them)\n\n(2) 100 minutes (when the hungry hen is fed with the right food to keep its body well fed; it takes 35 minutes to hatch one of the eggs, and the hen needs 25 more minutes to hatch the other egg)\n\n(3) 90 minutes (when an adequately fed hen sits on 2 eggs that take 1 hour", "answer": "C: city"}

Since, there were 1 1/15 litres more in the original bottle of wine, the bartender added this to the 2 1/5 liters bottled wine. And also, since the ratio did not change, I came to conclusion that, by adding the ratio-wise, the bartender increased the total bottle to 3 liters.\n\nAnswer 2: Bartender did not pour wine. The bartender poured the original 2.75 liters of wine from a 1/4 litre bottle\n\nI found this by doing cross-differential.\nThe question given was the bartender pouried some wine, the amount of bottled wine was 2 1/3, the original bottle was 2", "answer": "E: artist's studio"}

Although the kids \"weren't known for\" (and were \"not known for\") their \"decor choices,\" the kids had a bedroom and a bathroom in a shared room. The kids used the bathroom as a bed. So they used a bathroom as a bed, which is a room in a college bathroom. Hence: closet. The kids used a _closet_ as a bedroom. However, they could not have used a bed as a closet because they had a bedroom. The kids did not use a room. They used a bedroom. Therefore they did not use _a_ room. The kids might have used a church as a bedroom or closet, but the question said they did not use a room for the bed, meaning they only used the bathroom as the bedroom or the closet. Therefore, they did not use the bathroom or the closet as a room. Thus, they had not used a room to house a bed, which eliminates _room_ as a possible answer to the question.

{"text": "A\n\n### Why:\nI used the word \"look\" in the word problem, not the words \"put\" or \"find\" which are used in instruction.\n\n### Rationale:\nWhen you use a definition to prove something, it must follow the format of Definition, Theorem, Proof. If you do prove something and leave out a step, then it is wrong. I don\u2019t understand how something like that can be marked as incorrect.\n\n### Example:If you define a line segment as being two segments that join at one endpoint, then you can call any line a line segment. If you call any segment that can be traced as a line a line, then you can prove that if you have two points, you can trace a straight line.\n\n### There are a bunch of similar questions to the first one, and they all seem to have the same issue in how the question is worded, which is that the word \"put\" is substituted for the word \"look\". But they all ask the same question \"Where did his wife (or husband or whoever) ask him to look first\" (so this is my assumption). So it seems like an odd oversight on the part of the person writing the test.\n\n### Input for the final question:When can you move the decimal point in rational numbers without changing the value of the rational number?

You must move the decimal point when dividing by a number less than ten to achieve the same value of the dividend (divide by 4, move decimal point to right. Divide by 4 again to get the same number = 0.25). When dividing by a number between 10 and 90, you must move the decimal point left a number of places equal to the number of zeros after the decimal point (move decimal point 3 places to the right). Similarly, you must multiply by a number less than or equal to 10 to achieve the same quotient as in your original multiplication (multiplying by 4 to get the same number as before, 0", "answer": "E: medicine chest"}

In how many different orders can these people be lined up?\n\n### Demnstration:\nFor the lined up order \"6 males, 4 girls, and 2 kids\" and the lined up order \u201c6 females, 4 cats, and 2 males\u201d, we're looking at the difference, which is 1. If we make this our variable, we can put in our solution by taking the difference, since \u201ctwo is the same\u201d but \u201c1 isn\u2019t the same\u201d. Now, we just need to add this into our original problem to solve it, and that\u2019s where \u201cand\u201d comes into play. We\u2019re lining each group up with the previous group, and the last group has only the two kids in it, so we just need to add the two kids to the end, since it\u2019s only 2. Now let\u2019s look at how we can work those problems out. Here\u2019s an example with males:\n\nMale:4 Female:4  \nMale:5 Female:3  \n..  \nMale:10 Female:4 \n\nAs you can see, the only difference in the way that they\u2019re lined up is the females.

Every tree produced a specific number of apples. The father owned 32 of the trees; the mother owned 13 more than the father. The grandmother owned 4 fewer than the mother, and the grandfather owned 79 times as many trees as the grandmother. How many apples did all the trees in the orchard produce altogether?\n\n#### Rational:\nThe father had 32 trees, which is 32 x 4 = <<32*4=128>>128 apples\nThe mother had 13. Now, our original problem doesn\u2019t say that she had 13 trees, so we need to take 13 away from 128", "answer": "B: city"}

There are 235 children. One fighter jet costs twice as much as five pickups. Three fighter jets cost as much as three pickups each. Six fighter jets cost the same as one skyscraper. What is the relationship between the number of pickups and the number of children?\n\n### Rationales\nI think that for this question we need to group every thing by a certain thing that can be bought or sold and that is for pickups and jets.\nThe fighter jets are the ones that are more expensive then pickups and the fighter jets can be bought in a certain number of three which cost for three pickups.\nIn the question I notice that the fighter jets are counted also so we need to count the pickups from that because it is part of the question too.\nInside we can notice as the pickups costs one skyscraper too.\nSo the total number of pickups is three times the number of fighter jets and after that we have only to figure how many children there is.\n\n#### 2,276\nAnswer: 2,000\n\n### Input  : One of the most popular ways to find the value of pi is the \u03c0-series.

C: The speed of light is 62340 kph D: The speed of speed limit is 25 miles per hour.\n \n### Response\nFor the first option, the speed of any object can be described by v = d/t, meaning that you take the total distance traveled over the total time this distance is traveled. From the equation, we know that v = d/t.\nFor the second option, the speed of light can be described the same way. When describing the speed of light, we are simply taking the total distance that light can travel over the time a single light ray covers that distance. So, the speed of light = d/t = light years per second For the third option, the speed limit can also be represented by v = d/T, meaning that you take a specific distance and then multiply that distance by the time it takes to complete that distance at a rate of travel. From the equation, you can see that v =d/t, but here, you have substituted miles/hour for t, since the speed limit refers to vehicles traveling at this speed. When describing the speed limit, the distance is taken is a single mile, meaning that the speed limit = d/t = miles traveled per hour\n\n### Input A: how many minutes in a year B: how many miles in a year\n\n### Response A: 60 minutes in a year\n\nB: 525,600 miles in a year", "answer": "D: doctor himself"}

There is a bus that goes from Squamish to downtown for $4.35 and to UBC for $4. However, if I go from UBC to downtown it costs $4.35. What should I take to go from Squamish downtown on a bus for $4.34 or less?\nRationales\nThe bus routes from UBC to dowtown and from downtown to Squamish should be 4 + (4.35 \u2013 4) = 4.35 since they are equal value.\n\nInput: A subway fare costs $3. Since the bus, taxi, and vanpool have different prices, I need a calculator to figure out my way. How do I do this?\nRationales You can take the bus if it is cheaper than $3, and if it is cheaper, then it is cheaper.\n\nInput: 9 people are 4 feet tall. They are 2 feet longer than the 7-foot tall person.

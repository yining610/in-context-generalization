How many slices do each have in all?\nFirst, let's simplify. We know the number of people and the number of dogs, so we can substitute p with the number of pizza slices to get this equation:\n```\np = 3\nD = 2\n```\n\nThen we'll just solve for x. So, all we'll do is divide:\n```\n6 p = (3 + 2) x\n```\nSince we're not trying to answer D, we'll solve for x. Now we have:\n```\n6 x = 5 x\n```\nAnd we know the x's cancel. So, we have:\n```6 = 5```\n6 * 5 doesn't work, because of that, we can subtract 1:\n```5 = 4```\nSo, 5 slices is the answer. Since there are 3 people, they each received 1 slice of pizza. Since there are 2 dogs, the two dogs combined to receive a slice of pizza.\n\nInput: When you go down three flights of stairs, how many flights of stairs are there left to go?\nOutput: There is one flight of stairs.\nSo the final Result is the D\n\nInput: What color is the car?

Here, we move down 2 places (20 is the first place) and check the second and third digit, which is 1 + 1, which is 2. We move 2 places down (22 is the second place) and check the fourth digit which is 2(1 + 1) + 1, which equals 4.\nSo, we move down 4 places and keep checking the fourth digit until 2 and the fifth digit until 9. Since we go past the 1000th number, we subtract 10 from each number and we get\n9-9 = <<9-9=0>>0  and   1-9 = <<1-9=8>>8 digits.\nTherefore, the amount of digits is 2(9 + 8) = <<2(9+8)=20>>20 and the correct answer is 2*20 = <<2*20=40>> 40\nSo the final answer of choice D is 46\n\nInput: This is one of the most fun movies ever!\nOutput: This is one of, is used when choosing between alternative choices and it is called an of phrase.\n\nInput: 100 + 85 = 185\nOutput: 185 -100 = 85\n\nInput: 200 pounds is converted to kilograms by diving by 2.2 pounds/kilogram.

By chance, I was in the city when I typed in the address. However, I was on this particular address and could not have gotten there by random chance: the city name is wrong. How is this possible?\nOutput: The problem is that you are wrongly entering the data. A route planner cannot interpret a street, city, and country as a single address in one input.

For example, a 5 year old kid could have 2 siblings, and one of them may be 8 years old.   How many siblings have they?\nOutput: In a particular family, the number of siblings a kid has depends on their oldest sibling.\nThe number of siblings a child has is equal to that of the their oldest sibling as the equation 2^number of siblings = number oldest sibling\nso n = 2^n -1\nso answer = n = 2^number oldest siblings - 1\nHere we have a family where their oldest child is 3 years old and has 5 siblings, so n =5 - 1 = 4\nso answer = 5 - 1 =4\nBut we are also assuming that this is a single child family and the only siblings that each other older sibling has\nSo instead we want to assume that there are no siblings in the family that are twins, and then apply our formula to the largest sibling number in the family.\nWe still end up using the same formula we did for the family with 3 siblings.\nThe largest number of siblings in the family is the number of siblings that one of the children has, so we have the formula: LARGESTNUMBER = n = 2 ^number of siblings - 1. \nIf we assume that there are 3 siblings in the family, their child would have 8 siblings because 8 = 2^3 - 1 = largest number \nThis is the correct answer\nSo the answer to 4.8 is 8\n\nInput:If a train is 42 miles long and travels at a speed of 57 mph, how far does the train travel in 1 hour?\nOutput: Train a travels 42/57 to travel 42 miles in one hour.\n\nInput: In order to find the mean of 7, 8,", "answer": "A: holding"}

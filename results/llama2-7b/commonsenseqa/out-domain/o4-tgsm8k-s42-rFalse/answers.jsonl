You are going to use the table to estimate the size of the pony you select.  You start the task by input the first position of the table, i00, designating the pony size.  This represents the type of pony you are thinking of buying.  In the first row of the table, where i00 == 1, the cost for that pony is $20", "answer": "C: solitude"}

It might be a compliment that could lead me to something better.\nThe question is a bit confusing, or at least open to interpretation. It could lead to anything that is mentioned in the choices.\nAn example of an interpretation would be compliments leading me to be better at my school work. Which would lead to compliments and also better work. Which leads to more compliments, which then could be passed to another students, then I can be complimented again.\nAnother interpretation would be if I choose D which would be avoid pain, then choosing this choice may avoid the feeling of hurt. And if this avoids the feeling of being hurt, then you would avoid being hurt, because you have seen hurt and want to avoid it.

{"text": "A\n\n### Context:\nIn a computer system with a distributed processing architecture, a distributed system is a collection of diverse and distributed components of computers which are interrelated by a topology. Here, \u201ctopology\u201d describes the physical distribution of hardware components. Each component within a distributed processing architecture consists of many individual elements. This type of system is typically designed to achieve more functionality at a lower cost per unit of system area. This allows parallel computing, which is very efficient. In this type of computer system, components are grouped geographically in different physical locations, often distributed in a single site, or can be spread among multiple administrative domains and geographically different areas (i.e., sites located in different cities or states). Distributed computing refers to the computing model in which a computer contains more than one computer-related component located on different devices. These components interact using a local area network (LAN) or the Internet. A distributed system, on the other hand, is an arrangement of computer network nodes spread over separate sites.\n\n### Keypoint:\n\n### Democratizing Artificial Intelligence\nComputing hardware includes the components that make up a computer system.

To get started you need to understand the logic behind the given problem. This solution can be broken down into three parts, create a helper function which stores the size of the original array, then create a function that will call the helper with the array as a parameter. Lastly the main function stores the 10 smallest items based on the size of the array and pushes them into another array. This logic can be extended to any size of the array. Try to build the logic with comments so that it is very clear to the reader how the main function gets the 10 smallest values.\n\nThis solution uses the sort() function to sort the values into ascending order, however it can be done with just the Array.prototype.sort() function.", "answer": "D: connecticut"}

He had been looking for a long time and finally called the property manager of a small apartment building.  George called to find out the size of the apartments, but when the man on the phone didn't know the number of square feet, George decided not to rent the place.  He thought that the property manager was either careless or uninformed and he'd rather have a manager who knew the answers to the questions George was asking.  The property manager, though, thought that George was just too fussy and it was ridiculous to not rent a place because you don't know the size. What might be an appropriate way to respond to the manager? Choices A:  Say \"I'm glad that there are so many small apartment buildings around here.\" B: Say \"No matter, I found an apartment and I'm moving in tomorrow.\" C: Say \"I'm just being cautious.

For example Microsoft Word, a software that is on all PC's, can be used in so many different ways to suit your needs. It works with almost everyone, whereby Apple works with only one kind of software such as Final Cuts to suit their needs or something else.\n\n\n\n\n\n### [Answers]Where does the movie theatre go if it is located under the theatre?

Choices: \nA: checkers B: backgammon C: chess D: monopoly\n\n### Response\t: C\n\n### Instructions: The following is a simple, complete instruction. There are some things to note about the instruction, however.  First, if you go to the end of the instruction, there is a sentence that reads, \u201cI have not included any punctuation for the sentence.\u201d  This means that there is no punctuation at the end of the instruction except what was given.  Second, what is important about the instruction is not that there are two question marks, but that the second sentence begins with the question mark \u201c.\u201d.  This lets you know that the instruction does not end with a question mark, so the sentence should not be followed by one.  The third detail you should look at is the punctuation in the second sentence.  The instruction is asking if you remember the first person sentence with the question mark \u201c?\u201d.  This is because the following sentence begins with this question mark, which must not be a question mark, so how do you figure this out?  Look at the end punctuation, but only when the sentence finishes with a question mark.  So for example the sentence \u201cI remember? that?\u201d.  You should assume that the sentence finishes with the question mark and add the comma that follows.\n\n### Input\nGive yourself a grade of 0 if you don't remember the sentence containing a question mark \u201c?\u201d.\nInput:  Is 2 times 2 equal to 6, no it is equal to 9.

How much treasure did they find?\n(1,1,12,5),(3,3,1,4),(5,4,3,5)\n```\n\n```\nOutput: 19\n\n```\n\nAnswer: We can think of a maze as a 2-D grid of the maze's cells. So, each (row, column) coordinate of the maze is in the grid, which we use to make a map.  There is no restriction on the size of the grid. The map should have 1's for \"dead ends\", and 2's for \"treasure\".\n\nIn order to do this we must first have a method to find the current locations on the grid.\n\nA solution to this maze problem consists of an infinite array, where each position stores a value corresponding to the given coordinates.\n\nFirst, for each cell in our grid map, we determine the row in the 2-D grid (x) and column in the 2-d grid (y). Then we store 1 if this position in the maze is a dead end. Since each row can only contain at most one 1, if the current row contains no 1, we can traverse along each path from the current column to the right or down. Then each position we would have visited is either a dead end or a wall, and we should store that accordingly, since we could not have reached our treasure location.\n\nAfter that, we should traverse along each path from our current column until we find a wall. In this step, the \"wall\" is a way we can distinguish between a dead end path and a \"treasure path\". Once we find one, we can traverse our path to the end.\n\nAfter that procedure is", "answer": "B: tomb"}

{"text": "I have gone through all the four choices given in the question but, the first two are the most probable choices. \nAs per my personal experience, if I am having dinner with friends and we wanted to spend our time together in a quiet way, then generally we would go to our friend's house for dinner. If there is any marriage, then the first choice given in the question may come true. The third choice does not make sense to me. But, this is the only answer given from choices(C).\n\nAnswer: A, B or D.\n\n### Explain:\nThe answers given in the above choices are not related to the number of people. For example, if there are two people then the first (A) and the second (B) and the third(C) are totally different. While eating dinner together in the same house, having dinner in a restaurant or having dinner in someone's house does not depend on the number of people. So, it does not make any sense to me.\n\n### Example:\nJack is baking cookies and his total batch yielded four dozen. He accidentally used the same jar for four batches and didn\u2019t mix the jars for two batches. He is going to sell the batches separately, which jar had the most cookies in it?\n\n### Solution:\nThe first batch contains 12 jars and the last batch contains 12 jar. So, the jar with the most cookies in it contains 4 dozen. Hence, this question is solved.\n\n### Solution explanation:\nLet us calculate the number of different jars in the given question.\n\n\nFirst jar - 12\n\nSecond jar - 12+1\n\nThird jar - 12 +2\n\nFourth jar - 12 x 3\n\nFifth jar - 11 - 2\n\nSixth jar - 10 - 4\n\nSeventh jar 9 - 3\n\nEighth jar 8 - 2\n\nNinth jar 6 - 1\n\nTenth jar 4 - 9\n\nEleventh jar 4 - 2\n\nTwelfth jar Two Jars are there\n\nIn the above sequence, you will see the 0 to 11 Jars contain (12)  and 12 contain (", "answer": "D: movie"}

{"text": "The solution is A.\n\n### Explanation:Answers cannot contain spaces. So, all answers are shelf, cupboard, grocery store, refrigerator, cellar. An answer that includes shelf was in the correct shelf, which is cupboard. This makes all three answers in the correct shelf since they are all cupboard, so the answer is cupboard. A cupboard and shelf are both containers, but they are not the same type or a part of the same container. So, the answer is cupboard, as an answer that includes cupboard was in a cupboard, even if it did not exist. The same goes for shelf/grocery store and shelf/refrigerator, and cupboard/cellar. Since they are in the same cabinet (shelf), they get the same container name, and same answer.\n\n### Input : My mom took pictures of my first day of school, where do they go so she can look back?\n### Response:My mom took a picture of me, my brother, and my sister, but she left out the camera.\n### Explanations:  I need to go check the attic but all my brothers belongings were in the basement.  I only remembered seeing a picture of your dad in his dad's closet.  There are 4 pictures and they go in the cellar.  You gave me your grandma's camera but it only had one picture left which was in the refrigerator.\n\n### Solution: The correct answer is cellar.

You can message (send a message to) them by clicking the email address.\n\n### For the next problem, a group of people are playing the game: you tell them a number, and they ask one question to try and guess the number. For instance:  You tell them \"The number is between two negative whole numbers\", and they can then ask any question they like: \"Is the number even?\", \"Is the number a fraction?\", \"Is the average of two numbers equal to the number?\"...etc. Here are the steps of the game:\n\n1. You tell the group of players the topic of the number. For instance, \"The number is between the two negative whole numbers -1 and -0.5\".\n\na. The player who hears this will respond by asking one question about the topic.\n\nb. For example:\n\n\"Is it a fraction?\"\n\n\"Is it even?\"\n\n\"Is the average of four and three equal to the number?\"\n\nNote: The question can't be \"What is the number?\"\n\nc. Then the other players will ask yes or no questions about the player's question. For instance:\n\nIf a player states \"The number is a fraction\" and another player states \"Is one-half equal to the number?\" the \"Is one-half\" question should be answered before a question concerning the player's original question can be answered.\n\n2.

{"text": "A\n\n### Instructions\nWrite a complete Python program that completes this task. Assume you know the following already:* Python is installed and on your computer.\n* The value of True is equivalent to 'True'* The value of False is equivalent to 'False'\n* Variables can contain just about anything, and are used to represent values.\n* A variable's data type tells you what it can represent.\n* Variables and other values of the same data type can be compared to see if they are equal.\n* Strings represent a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes (\"). They can be concatenated together using the plus operator.\n* We can convert a string to its individual characters and vice versa\n  * We can convert any value to a string, by simply using the string() method or + (plus) to join separate values together. Note that we cannot compare two strings using ==, instead we need to use.startswith('your string') or else compare the first character.\n* We can pass values to functions as arguments. This is often useful for sending the output of one operation to the input of another operation.\n* A function is a reusable set of instructions that you can apply to data. Unlike values passed directly to a function, values obtained by calling a function are different, modified versions of the data it took in.\n* To make a variable refer to the value of a function, we create a new object with the function's name and an ellipsis (...). This is called a closure.\n* A slice is a range or substring defined with square brackets ([]). When we make a slice into a list by assigning it to a new variable, we can use Python's indexing rules to access the values we've created.\n* When we want to make a new slice, Python will automatically fill the values with whatever data it expects to see in its index position.\n* Tuples are lists of values with assigned names. They are more compact because they contain all of the values it refers to and are not empty.\n* Dictionaries are used to map keys (also called keys) to values (also called records). The map keyword is used to create and access a single value.\n* Lists are often used to represent a sequence of related-items.\n* Dictionnaires are often used to represent mappings from keys to values.\n* Lists can be revers", "answer": "A: humidifier"}

Since 5 \u00f7 10 = 1 and 1 \u00f7 10= 0.1, 5 \u00f7 2 / 10 = 5 \u00f7 5 / 10=5/5/10. The same thing is applied to add the same denominator, 1, to the result like when you divide 3 by 10, your result is 0.3, but since we have 3 dividing by 10, we need to multiply by 10 and the result is 30/100. Since there is 8 in the denominator of this equation, we have to divide by 8. You will have both of these operations when you add a fraction. To subtract a fraction, you want to have both of the fractions in the denominator as the same, too. In order to add or subtract two fractions, you need to make sure that both of the fractions are in the same denominator before you can divide or multiply.\n\nIf a+b= c, then this is the method of dividing c to the common denominator, which is b, then subtract 1.

In the first question, the input of 12 cans meant 12 $0.50 per can so we get $6 (for 12 cans) and 144 can = $84. The input of 20 kiloggers of news paper was 20 $1.50 so $30 and 20 kilos is $30. So our answer is $114. To solve Betty's problem we have to find out how many pages there are in each book then multiply the number of books by the number of pages in each one. $115 + $3,100 is the answer in the input, that leaves 6 books or 600 pages. To complete Jack's problem we are just finding out the total number of Legos by subtracting the number of missing Legos from the number of Lego's in the box and then add them to the number of Legos that are left for him to put back. $500 + $500 -$25 is the number of Legos, the number of missing Lego's being $25.", "answer": "B: atlas"}

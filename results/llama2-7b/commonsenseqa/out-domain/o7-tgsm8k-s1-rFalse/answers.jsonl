Answer choices: A: 6 Cm B: 7 Cm D: 5 Cm C: 7 Cm\n\n### Response Question:\n\n#### Explanation:\nThe formula for finding the side length of a triangle is: half of the base squared + half of the perpendicular height squared divided by two = the actual side length. Because the base of this triangle is 5 cm, 12.5/2 = 6 cm. The square root of a number is 2.236 and 7/2 = 3.5, so the perpendicular height of the triangle has a side length of 6+3.5/2 =3.75.  The area of a triangle is base times height so 6cm times3.75 = 23.5 square cm. 23.5/2= 11.75cm squared. Thus, if you subtract the 23.5 from 29.5 you get 6.  That's 6 cm.\n\n### Input Solution:\n\n#### Expected Output:\n*What has the master of his/her craft done about the craft?\n*The side of the triangle is 6cm.\n\n### Expected Output Question:\n\n#### Notes for the developer:\n\n#### Expectation:\n*This should probably be a user input box since it is question number 3.\n\n#### Explanations:\n\nWhat has the master of their craft done a bout a craft? Well, they drilled on their craft until they mastered it. The side of the triangle is what's left after you have cut it into three equal pieces. But you don't know the size of the square, so you will need to create a box to ask for the input from the user.  Then, have the computer calculate what the side of the triangle is which is 6cm. Finally, you need to have the program print out that there is 1/2cm left over and the side of the triangle after subtracting the 2 from the square is 6cm. It is 6cm because you created an equation out", "answer": "D: learn"}

If you are running around looking for a place to store it, it's not doing any of the intended purposes.  You're more than likely running around to other places trying to find room and that's what people are going to be wondering.  There's an easy answer to this question based on the wording.  If you're in a vehicle and there's no where to put it, you can't go into a store.  So, you need to figure out some other place to put it.  If it was a house or apartment you can't go to a store, so you can't put it up on the roof or in storage.  It also doesn't make sense to throw it away without finding some place to put it.\n\n### Input The average temperature last week was 85 degrees for a city in Texas.

The first step of the loop is to shuffle the cards into new array by shuffle() function in c, then prints that array, then compares it into the initial cards array to check if cards is already equal to the initial, if the result is equal that means shuffle() didn't change that card and this means that deck is already shuffled and also it shuffles that dean into it's shuffles array, so in this condition the shuffles increases and it writes it's value into deck_shuffles array, if the new array of printed cards didn't equal with initial array then the shuffling wasn't complete and the above step should repeat until the shuffling is complete. \n6. When the complete, the shuffling is equal with previous array, this means that shuffling was complete to all decks, so in this condition it just writes shuffles =0.

I think any college degree should be sufficient unless you choose to do the coding part.- I've learned about 12 programming languages throughout my career, but the one I use the most now is SQL. We use this language to organize the data within the database. You would use it to write reports, write the queries and create tables.- I'm thinking of applying for a job at my old programming place. In my opinion, everyone needs to start somewhere.- Software development is a huge field. Some big companies have hundreds of employees to build and maintain websites. The smaller companies may have only one or two people. Usually companies will start with one or two people and grow with the business.- I have been programming for 35 years. I started with COBOL which was one of the most widely used languages back in the sixties. Even my friends who just had a high school diploma could understand it. It was pretty simple.- I got my first job as a developer when I was a senior. I majored in Computer Science but my university also offered the same classes I needed to get certified as a SQL developer. Many companies don't require you to go to college to do SQL but they will require you to do that if you are going to do something else, like JavaScript or PHP.- I don't think it is very common to get a job if you're brand new. But it is easier to get a job if they think you can learn. I think the main thing that can hinder your career as a developer is not being willing to change your program as new technology comes out.

{"text": "A\n\n### Explaination:\nThe first rule you should remember for answering riddle questions is to pay close attention to the language that is used.  There is more than one way to answer the riddle so it all depends on what the statement says.\n\nIn this case, we have the sentence.  **When you\u2019re great at something, the statement says:** **Every person who is great at\u2026 has what to it**.  The options provided are as follows:  **hatred**, **surprise**, **compliments**, **dedication**, and **solutions**.\n\nI would begin by crossing off **hatred** and **surprise**.  I do this because I see there is an adverb and preposition that separates \u201cgreat\u201d from **hatred/surprise**.\n\nThis leaves me with **compliments** and **dedication/solutions**.  The adjective \u201cgreat\u201d should be following the person who is great.  Therefore, I choose **dedication/compliments**.\n\n**Explaination**: \nIn some riddle questions, there are two words that can replace each other such as \u201cdedication\u201d and \u201cdevotion,\u201d  which lead to different meanings.\n\n### Exercise:\n1.How long will the ice last?\nInput: The ice was put in the refrigerator 24 hours ago.\nAnswer: The ice will last 13.6 hours\n\n2.Which country has the most people?\nInput: People in China, outnumber any other country.\nAnswer:\n\n3.How many dogs were there at the park.\nInput: There were two dogs playing at the park.\nAnswer: There were 3 dogs.\n\n4.How much ice was in the drink?\nInput: There was one more scoop in the cup.\nAnswer: There was 8 ounces in the cup.\n\n5.How much more is left?\nInput: There are 3 apples on the table.

{"text": "D\n\n### Constructed Response:\n\n*Note:* For this assignment I chose option C.\n\nThe story \"The Most Beautiful Woman in Florence\" by Amy Tan takes place in the mid 1800's when beauty was the most valuable thing a human could possess. There were several instances throughout this short story of how this ugly girl had to hide her true self from the outside world in order to fit in. \n\nThe beautiful woman Florence was so insecure about her beauty, that she would only leave the house when her husband went out to his job. She lived a very lonely life with her husband whom she loved very much. However, she was very unhappy and would do anything she could to hide her true self. Florence was even willing to give her husband money and valuable jewelry to convince the wealthy man of another time to marry her and give her the perfect life she always dreamed of. When there weren't any wealthy men in the village that she could have made a deal with, she created a fake boyfriend to make her husband see how much money he was wasting by marrying such an ugly woman because it was obvious he only married her for money. She even created a fake personality for the entire household to see. When Florence's husband saw how hard it was to have so much beauty in the house he realized how much he had taken it all for granted. \n\nWhen I first read this short story I imagined that all people were naturally beautiful during this time in history. This story showed me that I was wrong and there was people who weren't very beautiful and people who had the beauty taken away from them by others, like the beautiful woman Florence. I had also assumed that people of this time period were also very rich and all of them had things like servants, fancy clothes, and beautiful jewelry. This story proved that you could be good looking but still poor and have very little material possessions. This story proved to me that in the past, people valued beauty over everything and they were willing to risk their life over it.", "answer": "C: pleasing"}

{"text": "Choice: C and answer is \"A radio uses three types of technology to send the signal through the air to a receiving tower. It needs to be powerful enough to send a decent signal over a long distance.\"\n\n### Input \n\nIn a game of baseball, the person playing first base can't see the ball when it's thrown to them. Instead of throwing the ball to a team member who is able to catch it, the person at first base uses something they call a 'baseball radio'. They need to get in contact with a player on 'home', to whom they're going to throw the ball to. The radio is used to send a signal which lets the player on home know where the catcher is standing, and where the fielder can catch the ball to throw to the base runner.\n\n### Response\n\nAnswer: Choice: D and answer is \"The ball is thrown to a player on home but the radio sends a signal where the catcher is so the runner can round it without being put out.\"\n\n### Instructions\n\nHow do you get in the front door of a house from the back door?

We also take the 7 from 13 and get 6. So, there are 6 weeks in a month in a common year.\n### \nNow, let's use that math on the rest of the months in a leap year:\nIn January, there are 6 days in that month.\nIn February, there are 6th months, like January, where there are 6th days.\nIn March, there are 6h days, like the ones in February.\nContinuing like that, there are 6b days for April, 6l days for May, 6f days for June and 6th days for September.\n###\nIn a common year, the sum of the years of each month from March to June is 24. In a leap year, those years are 24 + 25 + 26 + 27 =38. So, you add 14 days to the number of days in September during a leap year. This is: September 14 + October 14 + November 14 + December 1", "answer": "B: main"}

Each comma should be placed where needed as indicated by the grammar rules.\n\nSpelling: The word you have spelled may be correct but the program looks for the word you used. To spell words correctly, a computer must be able to understand capital letters. The capital letter at the start and end of names should be used in words.

He currently has $71.5 +$17 +$10 = $98.50 available.\n\nIf he babysits for 2 hours, $14 he just earned (since that's more than he spent) we get Zach's money as $98.5 - $14 = $84.50. If we add what he can get for an allowance we know we have $71.5, but if he mows $10 we get $121 in total, that is $121 = 98.50 + $20. Now, if we subtract", "answer": "B: schoolroom"}

{"text": "Intoxication\n\n### Input-\nWhy would we want to use the word \"per\" in the problem instead of \"for\"\n\nWe want to use the word per because this will make it easier for us to calculate the number of times we need a figure. Here, we need to find out how many stickers there are in each page of the journal. For this we will be multiplying 2 times for each page since there are two large stickers on each page. For each page we will have 7 stickers of the smaller size. Hence, multiplying 2 times 7 would give 14, so we would end up multiplying the total stickers (89) by 14. But if we were to use the word \"for\", we would have used 2 as the multiplier on each page. So we would have multiplied 2 times 2, which gives us 4. Hence our answer would have been 85 instead of 44. So here, our answer changes because the multiplier we used changed.\n\n### Output Response:\n### Input: How many more stickers does Mary have? Choices: A: 44  B: 51 C: 35 D: 59 \nE: 26\n\n### Response-\nWe can see by the picture that there are 44 stickers on the remaining. Let us check if the answer is true. Mary had 89 sticker, she used 3 large stickes on the front page and 7 sticker on 6 pages. Let us work it out now\n\nFor the front page Mary needed **9** large tickers. That is why 89 reduced by 9 = 80.\n\nBut for the six smaller pages Mary needed **57** stickers. Here Mary needed **5 times the number of stickers** she needed for the entire front page.\n\nHence Mary needed 44 stickers, which is exactly equivalent to the answer given in the question.\n\n## Demonstration: Input: Zach is saving his  money to buy a brand-new bike that costs $ 100. \n\nHis weekly allowance is $$$5$$$. \n\nHis parent will pay him an  extra $$$10$$$ to mow the laird.", "answer": "E: pleasure"}

{"text": "The student needed to get new pencils. He went to go get some new penciles from the store, because they are selling pencils at the store.\n\n### Input\nIn a certain game, each player gets two turns. The turn consists of a roll of a pair of dice. The player selects any double from one of the die, and multiplies it by twice that number. Example, a player rolled 3 and 4. The player, when calculating his score, took only the 3 and 4, and doubled them, this is a total of 8 points. \n\nOn the player's first turn, he adds his score plus one-half his score to his total points. He then subtracts one-fifth of his total score from his score. His total points are then one less than his score. Example, a player scored 8 plus one-half of 8, which is equal to 10 plus the fifth of the score which is one-half of 10 which is 5, equals 14 points. \n\nHis new score is one less than his score which is equal to 3 points.\n\nThe game continues on until the score exceeds 21 points. Who will get the most points?\n\n### Response\nThe player with the most score will get the maximum number of points that is 21. This is because when a players score is 22 or greater, he subtracts one-twelfth of the score, this equals to 21, which is the maximum number of points a player can get.\n\n###Input:A student wants to practice their newest skill by making a paper plane. Their new skill is how to cut without any ripples. They are going to use construction paper. \nA plane is folded out of one piece of square paper, and the wingspan is equal to the length of the plane and the plane is the same length as the wingspan. If the plane is folded to make the wing,  the wing will create a ripple, because the plane is an uneven triangle, and in order to make ripple free plane, the area of each side must be equal to one another, and the area of one side of the plane can be found using A=1/2bh.\nIf A=1/2 bh the wingspan can be found", "answer": "A: store"}

The function can be called directly like \"print(plusOne(3))\" or indirectly like \"addTo = plusOne\". To test your program, call addTo = plusOne(2) before adding any numbers to addTo to make sure addTo was created properly. Also, test \"print(addTo(1))\", \"print(addTo(-3))\", and \"addTo(5)\". 2) Write a second program where you can define the function once and call it repeatedly by adding numbers until an arbitrarily long number is reached, or until an empty string is provided to the function. You can check your work by typing \"plusOne(8)\" as this should equal 9. \"plusOne(3)\" should equal 4. And \"addTo = minusOne\" does not work. 3) Write a third program", "answer": "E: score points"}

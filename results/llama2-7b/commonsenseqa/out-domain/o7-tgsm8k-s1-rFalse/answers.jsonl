What does it mean in the expression \"3 large sticker on the front page of the journal\", does it mean the front page has 3 large stickers or the front page has three stickers? After she use 3 large sticker on it, we still have the 5 stickers on it. I think the question want us to think that on the front page, does it have 3 large stickers and 5 small stickers, so does other pages, does it mean there are 3 pages that has only 3 large stickers each or every page has 3 large sticker and 7 small sticker? Mary only use 3 large stiker each page. So the remaining 39 is 3 pages of 9 stiker, 47 stikers.\n\n\n\n\n\n2) We want to find out: What is the number of babysitting hours?

They looked at two attributes of each pie simultaneously and awarded 10 points to each quality that the pie had, and 0 points to each quality it lacked.  The third attribute they considered was a tiebreaker, which was awarded from 5 to 0 points.  For this tiebreaker, the judges considered the total number of contestants in the baking contest, and for each pie\u2019s total rank, they subtracted the product of each pie\u2019s rank for the first two attributes to get the total number of people who had baked the same pie; this number was their \u201cexclamation mark\u201d for the tiebreaker.  For example, a pie ranked first for size and taste, but eighth for presentation, has a total score of 40 points on the first two attributes, and 15 points on the tiebreaker.

{"text": "A\n#### 34. The following is a code-switching question involving the use of \"to\" (don't forget to add other rules for this type of questions).\n\nCode:   In 1982, a group of Japanese researchers observed a large number of penguins in the Antarctic. But they noticed that some of the penguins could swim farther than others. After a three-year investigation they identified some peculiar birds that they thought were capable of crossing from one side of the island to the other. The researchers put out some fish that the birds wanted to eat, and they also put out some large rocks. Which words did the penguins use most often with the rocks to express the distances they swam:   - many kilometers and many miles?  - several kilometers and several miles?    - a long way and a great distance?    \nInput: They should look at a map and then answer.  \n\nTips: Answer is the first one.\n\n1. They should look at a simple map.\n\n-  ( )\n\n2. The island is a small one and the penguins are not on a regular route to swim to the mainland every day. They can swim to the other side of the island only a few times a week in a good weather. So they didn't swim very often and the words they used in their conversations with this rocks were usually words of length, not words of distance. So the distances they swam couldn't be expressed in miles or kilometers.\n\n- \n3.  To cross from one side of the Antarctic island to the other, some penguins swim for 500 meters and some swim for 1500 meters.\n\n-  But 1000 meters and 1500 miles are not equivalent in meaning in the penguin's minds.\n\n-  These penguins live in Antarctica. There are no regular routes from one side of the ocean to the other. These penguins can swim to the main continent only a few times a year in good weather. So the distances or length of swims they had to do would have seemed very long.\n\n-  For these penguins, 400 and 800 kilometers are not equivalent.\n\n4. So the", "answer": "E: blotter"}

{"text": "A\nIn the problem 3, you're given a number 23.  Suppose you replace it by X.  So, you have X plus 3 times X.  And you have 6 over X, and you minus 1 over X, and you have X squared plus 4 times X plus 23.  So, let me get rid of this one.  So, you have 23 plus 4X plus X squared, and when I simplify this, I get 6X plus X squared plus 18.  And I minus 6X plus 23, and this equals 0.  So, X equals 23/6.  So, what is the value of -3 and 3 times -3?  So, you minus 3 times 3, that equals 3 over 3, and you minus three X squared, that equals -9X squared over 3.  And you minus 3 squared, that's -9.  And times X, that's -8.  So, what do you get?  That's 0.  So 3 over 6 plus over X squared, that is 2X squared / 3 plus 9, which is 120 divided by 3 is 40 times X squared divided by 3 is negative 10 times X squared and divided by 3 is -3X squared.  That's 8.  So, 8 divided by 3, which is X squared plus 3X, that's 6X.  That's the value of x.\n\nInput: How many stickers does it take to put a sticker on a sticker?", "answer": "E: social bonding"}

This function will receive the question number\n#   an array of answers and return a list of answers. \n#   Example: \n#   print('question number : ', question)\n#   arrayOfAnswers = answer(question, arrayOfAnswers)\n#   print(arrayOfAnswers) \n# - The function we will be making is called answer(number, answers )  \n#   The argument is the question number and the answers\n#  Note that when we pass the same array to the answer function, the passed array \n#  will not be modified  and will be returned ( this is required )\n#\n#  Note that in each answer, you should print two or one elements ( if the answer\n#  was negative )", "answer": "B: construction site"}

{"text": "A\n\t\n\n#### Part A\n\nFor each problem above, implement and export a function named `solution` that takes in the problem as the only parameter. Return the number that indicates your solution to the problem. This answer should be either a number or a variable that is truthy or falsey.\n\nIf your solution was a variable, it must be a true variable. This is different than the truthiness of a variable, which is false or true.\n\n```typescript\n/** \n *\n * @param problem \n */\nconst solution = (problem) => {\n\n}\n\nconsole.log(solution('input'));\n```\n\nIn your solution, you must include the number in the expected out value. Be sure to only use the `console.log()` to indicate that your solution works.\n\n#### Part B\n\nFor each problem, implement and export a helper function that returns the expected output number for that problem.\n\nThere are two types of problems in this section, variable problems, and number problems. Make sure that your helper function returns the expected number. If you're stuck, feel free to look at `solution()` and `solution.partA()` as an example.\n\n#### Part C\n\nCreate a `function sum()` that takes two numbers as parameters and return a third number that is the sum of the two.\n\nThis is part two of your three-part challenge. You must create and export a `sum()` function that you will also use in a later challenge.\n\n\n#### Part D\n\nCreate a `calculateSquareRoot()` function that takes in a number and outputs the square root of that number.\n\n**Hint**: You must pass the parameters in as variables, and not manually pass the values into the function. Make sure you `return` the expected number.\n\n\n#### Tips\n\n```javascript\nlet solution;\n```\n\n```javascript\nif(somecondition){\n\tsolution = function(){\n\t\t\n\t\treturn; // this is the correct answer to the given problem\n\t\t\n\t}\n\n}\nelse{\n\n}\n```\n\nIf you have trouble figuring out what the function should look like, try breaking down the problem and thinking about how to solve it with a smaller problem and simple numbers.", "answer": "D: carry people"}

Choices:  A: wedding B: tennis C: closet D: left foot E: house<n>Output:		A<n><n><n><n>#### Solution:<n><n>Explanation:<n><n>### Instruction:<n><n>1) If Mary had 89 sticker, she used 3 sticker each page on the front page of  her journal and 7 sticker each page. What does it mean in the expression "3 large sticker on the front page of the journal", does it mean the front page has 3 large stickers or the front page has three stickers? After she use 3 large sticker on it, we still have the 5 stickers on it. I think the question want us to think that on the front page, does it have 3 large stickers and 5 small stickers, so does other pages, does it mean there are 3 pages that has only 3 large stickers each or every page has 3 large sticker and 7 small sticker? Mary only use 3 large stiker each page. So the remaining 39 is 3 pages of 9 stiker, 47 stikers.<n><n><n><n><n><n>2) We want to find out: What is the number of babysitting hours? If he earn an extra $10 on Friday? What number he does need to earn on Saturday?<n><n>3) If each cookie costs 1.25, each cookie costs 12.5 cents, 4 cookies cost 4 + 2 + 4 + 4 = 14 dollars. Each cookie costs 1.24 dollars. The total remaining money is 14 dollars.<n><n>4) Since George's bowling teams is 4 players, each player needs to score 3.5 more points on the last game. Each player needs to break his average score of 2.87 to a higher score, so if the average score this round needs to be 3.6, each player will score 3.60.<n><n>5) The correct answer is A because in the expression "3 times more than twice", it means "3 times more" than "2 times more", which means, do 3 times more then 2.<n><n>6) In the expression "1/6 of her pi", it means to eat 1/6 of 1200 g. This means to eat 200 g.<n><n>7)The answer should be Choice A because you

First, they decided how the pies would be ranked against each other.  They looked at two attributes of each pie simultaneously and awarded 10 points to each quality that the pie had, and 0 points to each quality it lacked.  The third attribute they considered was a tiebreaker, which was awarded from 5 to 0 points.  For this tiebreaker, the judges considered the total number of contestants in the baking contest, and for each pie’s total rank, they subtracted the product of each pie’s rank for the first two attributes to get the total number of people who had baked the same pie; this number was their “exclamation mark” for the tiebreaker.  For example, a pie ranked first for size and taste, but eighth for presentation, has a total score of 40 points on the first two attributes, and 15 points on the tiebreaker. In this example, a baker who has not baked the given pie will tie for 16th place overall.  Which pie, in this baking contest, do the judges rank most highly?<n>Output: A<n>

The following is a code-switching question involving the use of "to" (don't forget to add other rules for this type of questions).<n><n>Code:   In 1982, a group of Japanese researchers observed a large number of penguins in the Antarctic. But they noticed that some of the penguins could swim farther than others. After a three-year investigation they identified some peculiar birds that they thought were capable of crossing from one side of the island to the other. The researchers put out some fish that the birds wanted to eat, and they also put out some large rocks. Which words did the penguins use most often with the rocks to express the distances they swam:   - many kilometers and many miles?  - several kilometers and several miles?    - a long way and a great distance?    <n>Input: They should look at a map and then answer.  <n><n>Tips: Answer is the first one.<n><n>1. They should look at a simple map.<n><n>-  ( )<n><n>2. The island is a small one and the penguins are not on a regular route to swim to the mainland every day. They can swim to the other side of the island only a few times a week in a good weather. So they didn't swim very often and the words they used in their conversations with this rocks were usually words of length, not words of distance. So the distances they swam couldn't be expressed in miles or kilometers.<n><n>- <n>3.  To cross from one side of the Antarctic island to the other, some penguins swim for 500 meters and some swim for 1500 meters.<n><n>-  But 1000 meters and 1500 miles are not equivalent in meaning in the penguin's minds.<n><n>-  These penguins live in Antarctica. There are no regular routes from one side of the ocean to the other. These penguins can swim to the main continent only a few times a year in good weather. So the distances or length of swims they had to do would have seemed very long.<n><n>-  For these penguins, 400 and 800 kilometers are not equivalent.<n><n>4. So the

For each value of n, print out the 3rd letter of the word MONSTER (M, O, and E).<n><n>- Programming Question 2: Write a Python program to print “Hello Python Programmer”.  You can create your own input, but if you read the line “Python Hello”, then it should print out “Python Hello Python Programmer.”<n><n>- Programming 3: Write a Python program which has a function called add(x, y). The function will add x and y. For example, if x=2 and y=3, then return 5. Give the function your name at the end of the main function so it has the name in the return value.<n><n>- Programming4:Write a program to implement multiplication of two numbers(each taken as input from the user) and print the result. The multiplied value must not exceed 20. For example, if we take the input as 21 and 7, then the out will have a value of 21*7=147.<n><n><n>- Programming5: Write a Python program in CMD that will output a greeting.

Choices:  A: gathering of information B: communication C: feel relaxed D: kill boredom E: social bonding<n>Output:		A<n>In the problem 3, you're given a number 23.  Suppose you replace it by X.  So, you have X plus 3 times X.  And you have 6 over X, and you minus 1 over X, and you have X squared plus 4 times X plus 23.  So, let me get rid of this one.  So, you have 23 plus 4X plus X squared, and when I simplify this, I get 6X plus X squared plus 18.  And I minus 6X plus 23, and this equals 0.  So, X equals 23/6.  So, what is the value of -3 and 3 times -3?  So, you minus 3 times 3, that equals 3 over 3, and you minus three X squared, that equals -9X squared over 3.  And you minus 3 squared, that's -9.  And times X, that's -8.  So, what do you get?  That's 0.  So 3 over 6 plus over X squared, that is 2X squared / 3 plus 9, which is 120 divided by 3 is 40 times X squared divided by 3 is negative 10 times X squared and divided by 3 is -3X squared.  That's 8.  So, 8 divided by 3, which is X squared plus 3X, that's 6X.  That's the value of x.<n><n>Input: How many stickers does it take to put a sticker on a sticker?

If Mary has 89 stickers left and spent 3 of them to make her journal look cooler, she has 86 stickers left. 🎦<n>This one requires some manipulation (in the same spirit of the previous challenge 🎪). We need to make two calculations. First, what is the amount needed to be saved on a weekly basis to have $100 at the end of the week? The amount should be 5 since one needs to add $10 from an external source each week. Secondly, we need to know the amount of hours that Zach works with his neighbor so that he can save enough money to buy the bike of cost $100. The hours that he works is 2, meaning that he can save as much as he receives, which is $10 as we calculated in the first step. 👱‍♀️<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the first multiple choice question.<n>Input: A boy has to take three tests in Math and French.

Return the number that indicates your solution to the problem. This answer should be either a number or a variable that is truthy or falsey.<n><n>If your solution was a variable, it must be a true variable. This is different than the truthiness of a variable, which is false or true.<n><n>```typescript<n>/** <n> *<n> * @param problem <n> */<n>const solution = (problem) => {<n><n>}<n><n>console.log(solution('input'));<n>```<n><n>In your solution, you must include the number in the expected out value.

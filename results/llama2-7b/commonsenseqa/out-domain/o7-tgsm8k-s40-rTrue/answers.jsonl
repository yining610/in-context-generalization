How did reducing the number of interactions with James speed up the work?\nOutput:  To answer this question we just subtract communication time in the last question from the total time required, giving us <<(10/10-2/10)=2/10>>2/10 hours required initially and 10/10+2/10=2 hours required after communicating\nIn the initial situation, it is 10/15 hours initially taken and 10/20 = <<(10/20)=1/2>>1/2 hours taken after communicating\nSo that is 6/15 -<<<<6/15=2/5>>2/5 hours taken initially and 2/3=2/5 =<<2/5=8>>8/5 hours taken after communicating, or 2/5 of the time.\nSince they took 2/5 of their time to communicate, they had 2/5 * (10/10 - 2/10) = <<6/10=3/5>>3/5 less time required after communicating.\nSo the final question is 3/5\n\nInput: A computer that runs", "answer": "C: progress"}

{"text": "The correct answer is option B.\n\n* Visibility is dependent upon many different factors in an aquatic environment, but one of the more important is how the sun affects the water.\n\n*  During the day, the surface of the water that receives sunshine will begin to warm. As a result of heating up, the water expands, creating a difference in temperature between the layer of water at the top and the water layer beneath.\n\n* This change in temperature causes the gases in the water to break apart, releasing bubbles from within the water. These bubbles become the visible component of the water, which we colloquially refer to as \u201cseafoam.\u201d The seafoam, or plume, in the water column is visible during the daytime.\n\n* In contrast, since the sunlight does not reach the bottom of the ocean, the bubbles do not form and it remains dark.\n\n* The sunrays are too dim for the bubbles to break up\n\n* At night, of course, the plume ceases to form, and water\u2019s ability to reflect light from above disappears. At the same time, the sunshine no longer heats up waters, causing the temperature to return to normal. This causes the bubbles that formed during the day to collapse and sink below the surface, making the ocean much darker than it is during the day.\n\n* This low visibility can cause various problems for scuba divers or snorkelers, such as poor visibility which interferes with driving or navigation and causing an individual to collide with an object.\n\n* Low visibility can also interfere with scuba divers\u2019 ability to see other divers on the surface, and make it possible for them to become lost, especially if they were traveling deep enough to not have any sunlight reaching them.\n\n* It can also create difficulties for those who intend to snorkel due to its inability to see the fish (which are mostly visible during the day).\n\n* Scuba divers also have to swim deeper in order to protect themselves from collisions due to low visibility. There are various things that come under dangers due to low visibility but low visibility is not what creates them.\n\n * Bubble formation and collapse causes disorientation and low visibility in the ocean but not relocation. Hence the answer to this question is option B", "answer": "A: disorientation"}

One is the long division method and the second is the short division method.\nWhen using the long division method the first thing to be done is shifting the decimal point to the right till it gets reduced to a whole number.\nThe second step is dividing the whole number by the divisor and getting remainder. If the remainder is 0 then there is no division hence the product is equal to 1 but if the remainder is not 0 then the product becomes zero.\nSimilarly in short division method the first thing is to shift the decimal point to the left till it reduces to a whole number and then subtract it from the dividend. Then the divisor is subtracted from the previous value and the result is obtained. Similar to previous method, if the remainder is 0 the product is 1 and if the remainder is not zero the product is zero.\n\nInput: 454 / 98 = 4\nOutput: If 454 /98 = 4 which means 454/98 = 4+0\nSo the final product in decimals is 4 + 0 = 4\nInput: 654 / 6\nOutput: If 654 /6 = 109\n654 / 9 = 72\n43/2 = 21\nSo the final answer in decimals is\n109+21+21 = 153\n\nInput: If a clock strikes 10:34, what is the angle measured in degrees between 10:35 and 10:36?\nOutput: There will be a total of 2 minutes in 10:30 and after that the minutes will be gradually decreasing.

The answer is saving money.\n\nInput: In a certain shop, the manager is offered $1000 per week to pay her assistant $15 per hour.  Her assistant has two children.  She can earn extra money by making extra deliveries.   If each delivery is worth $30, the manager will pay $9 in extra money per delivery so that she can deliver each package.  For example, if a package is worth $34.50, her assistant could earn an extra $0.50.  The manager says that making an extra two deliveries per week will earn the assistant enough money to pay for food for her two children.  If the assistant costs $15 per hour, how long does it take her to earn enough food for two children?\nOutput: First find out how many more hours it takes her to make enough food for her two children, then find what hours it takes to finish making food. If extra deliveries earn the assistant $9 per delivery, then extra deliveries take $9 dollars times 2=<<$9\\times 2=18>>18 more hours. It takes $15 to run the assistant for one hour. This means that $15 dollars divided by 2=<<15/2=7>>7 hours. You already know that it takes 7 more hours to make the food for both children. That leaves 11 hours to finish making the food. Since it takes 7 hours to make the food, that leaves 4 hours to give out the food.

As for building zones, you would expect high rise buildings to inhabit those areas, not necessarily schools. Prague zones are likely for commercial buildings, not schools, and would not really be in the same category as a residential neighborhood because of what kind of school it is.

If the first test is worth 5 points, by how many points is the second test worth?\nOutput: First let's say the quiz is worth q.\n\nIf the quiz is worth 2q, the first test is worth (2q)/2, which means the first test is worth one fourth of a quiz. Let this be s.\n\nThe first test is twice as much as the second test. Therefore, the second test has to be 2*s= 2*2s=<<2*2s=4*2s>>4*2s=8s\n\nLet the second test have 8 points of value, which means the first one has a value of 5.\n\nSince the second test is worth 8x the value of the quizz, it's worth 8*sq, or 64\n\nSince the quiz is 2x the first test, it's worth (8*2s)/2, or 4*s.\n\nAltogether, the value of these tests is 5, 8, 4*4 and 64\n\nSo it's worth 5+8+4*4+64= <<5+8+4(4)+64=75>>75 points.\n\nInput: A boy is 3 times as old as his sister. 10 years from now, he will be 3 times as old.

If the Moon stays in the same spot, in relation to the Earth, for the same duration as the length of the day, but there is no night, for how long is the Moon in this state?\nOutput: To answer this, first let us look at the current position of the moon.  In a single day, we say that the night lasts for however long it takes the moon to completely rotate around the earth.  In other words, we say the night lasts the same amount of time as it takes to do a single rotation. Therefore, we say that the moon lasts for the same duration in a single day, which should be the moon in a state of day. But this is not the desired answer!  But this is not the intended answer --we do not want the moon to be spinning along with the earth in all day -- we want it to be still so the duration of that lasts for the duration of the day.\nIt is said that, in an ideal environment, the moon should be in the same position at all times but not actually move.  Therefore, what we want is for the day to last the entire duration of the day. But is this even possible? Obviously it is not, even in an ideal environment if the moon rotates like we wanted the sun to in day 2.  One day, what we want is that all in a single day last the entire duration of a single day.\nSo the final A is the answer\n\nInput: To find a solution to a Sudoku puzzle,  a player must do", "answer": "A: bathroom"}

{"text": "This question is a little tricky because we are asked to choose the opposite of foolhard as described in the question.\nHowever foolhard does not contain the opposite meaning of thoughtful, calculated, cautious, or careful.\nSo the answer should be a: B: A\nTo answer this question you should identify if the prefix of foolhard and the suffix is foolhardy.\nWe are taught that the suffix and prefix do not change the meaning of the word.\nWhat this means is if you have a word that is spelled the same as another word, but the prefix and/or the suffix for one is different from the other.\nSince we have a change in the suffix from foolhead to foolhardy, we can determine that foolhead has no opposite meaning, and that the opposite of a word with a different ending is always the opposite of the word with the prefix.\nSince foolhard = foolhardy\nAnd we know that the opposite of the suffix always holds the opposite meaning, we should say that a cannot be foolhardy as it has the opposite prefix and the opposite of foolhard, which is cautious, is the opposite of foolhead.\nWe can conclude that the answer is B: A, since A cannot be B as the meaning are opposites.\nWe can conclude this by looking at the chart. A is a noun, so its opposite is an adjective.\nB is an adjective, so its opposite is a noun.\nC is an adjective, but its opposites are: Adverb, Adjective, Noun, Adverb, Noun.\nTherefore, C cannot be the answer.\nD is an adjective, and its opposites are: Noun, adjective, adverb, noun.\nTherefore D also cannot be the answer.

{"text": "The answer is A\nI was first told to go to the bus stop where I asked what question would be best suitable for someone driving to his or her airport. After researching on what that question might be I came across the question \"where did the man put his luggage.\"\nI was left with three choices: closet, at the hotel, and the trunk of the vehicle. I was left with the choice of 'closet' with 'at the hotel'. My reasoning behind this was that luggage is normally a very heavy object and can be somewhat awkward to carry especially when you are trying to get it to the airport. I assumed that this man was flying long distance, and is most likely only 2 suitcases so I left it on the assumption that he chose the closet which was the least awkward to carry his luggage. The trunk would be awkward as well only in a slightly different way. In a car trunk when you are closing the trunk it is difficult to see the space which is already a problem. If the bag is to big to put inside a car he normally would put it on the roof of the car which, in some states, is illegal. I decided to leave the man at the airport so he can carry it to the plane himself.\n\nOutput: We will start looking for the best answer to put your luggage.

I saw a bag not too big, as a man, you can put it in your car.\nI think he didn't put in the trunk because he would arrive late at hotel, at the bus stop.

For Example 0.167 * 19.66 is 3.31 miles\nSo the final answer will be 3.31\nInput: An elephant walks 4,646 steps in 6 hours. If the elephant walks at a rate of 3", "answer": "D: get arrested"}

{"text": "Answer A, Top of Home.\nThe correct answer is (E) Own home(material)\nAnswer A, Top of Home is a wrong answer because the correct answer is own home. Since the questions is about what type of home is mostlikely to have an attic, answer A is the top of home. Answer B, Older homes is also a wrong answer because the question states \"older homes\", which isn't necessary older/any specific homes, but old. You can also tell this answer is wrong because if you choose answer B, you won't get any history answers at the end, but just math.\nSince the question says \"historical items\" you can conclude that the answer must not be A, which is a home.

Choices B, C, and D are also wrong because they all don't have anything to do with the question. Answer C, Victorian house is a home that is in the 1800s, so the answer doesn't answer the question which asks about \"an old homes attic being filled with historical items\". The question could be a trick question and be talking about a museum, but then it would be pointless, since you wouldn't have any history in your home. Answer D, material, doesn't make sense after you think about it. Since the question is about attics, it could mean the attic might also be a material in the home, or the item being in the attic/home, like clothes and other old things. Since the question is asking about the historial items being in the attic, you can conclude that the attic is the item, not the material. The material in most houses is just carpet or tiling.\nSince the question is asking about a \"home\", an attic is not a home. An attic is like part of the \"roof\" of the house. The correct answer, (E), own home, says that the owner would keep the items in the attic, meaning the attic is the historical items.

I struggled answering these questions because I had to translate mathematical expressions into a human language. For example, I did not really understand why the amount that the doctor gave away each month is divided by 2, and the answer comes to be 82. After watching a couple of videos, the answers became clearer. I learned how these questions use syntactical expressions instead of simple formulas to create more abstract questions. For example, I now understand that a computer cannot solve a math problem the way humans solve it. Computers process numerical data in binary values. For example, 1,015=<<1,015 ==510>>510 is a binary value of 01011111, which is the equivalent for the binary number of 510. To solve these questions, I learned how to translate mathematical values from binary to English. I learned that to translate the question: 53 + 3 * 6 + 7 * 4 - 7 = <53+3*6+7*4-7==>> 53+18+28-7=107, first I have to find the English equivalents for each number. I started by finding the English equivalents for the 53, 6, and 4. I know that you can get the English value of a number when you divide it by 10, so I began by dividing 53 by 10.

How long will you need to spend with the customer before showing the ball to get back a profit?\nOutput: The amount of time you spend with the customer affects how quickly you can spend the time with them.\nThe amount of time you spend to buy the ball, how much you have, determines how much you get back\nIf you spend:30 minutes, you get:40 minutes\nif you spend:40 minutes, you get : 35 minutes\nAs long as you spend at least half of your time with them, you will be able to buy the ball and make a profit\nIf spent 180 total minutes, so you have 140 remaining.\n140 divided by total minutes: 30/140=<<8=30>>3%\nSo the time you spend with the customers will be:\n15/30, so 5/30 or: <<30*5/30=<<15=5>>5 or 15% of your time with them\nThen calculate how long it will take you to spend that time, which was 75% of customer's time with you, divided by 0.15:\n[[75*0.15=<<37.5=5>>5]\n\nAs we know, it will take 37.5% of the customer's time, 75% divided by 0.55: <<75/0.55=<<133.33=22>>22% of their time with you\n\nAs you now, you must spend a percentage of 100% or 100% of the time with them. As such, you will have to spend 22% of the time with 22% of you time, which is 22", "answer": "A: reach tentative agreement"}

Given a choice of just one type of plane, all with the same flight range, what is the shortest flight duration to the other city in a plane with a range of 1,528 miles?\nOutput: In a straight line, there is an angle of 90 degrees between the two cities, which makes sense since they are the farthest points west and east of each other. Therefore, the two cities are separated by two sides of a right triangle.\nGiven a choice of just one plane, let's say the plane has a range of 1528.\nSince the distance from the west coast to the east coast is 2442 miles, the entire total distance must be divided by 1528 to get the exact distance of the plane's flight path.\nThe first half of this distance, which is 1224 miles, is equal to the distance from the west to the halfway point.\nThe second half of this distance, equal to 1224, is equal to the remaining distance from the halfway point to the east coast.\nBecause half the distance in a right triangle is equal to the adjacent side, 2442/1528=2, the adjacent must be 1224.\nTherefore, by substituting these values, 244=180<180-2-60<60\nAs a result, the time it would take to cross the country in this plane would be 12 hours.\nSo the final outcome is 12\n\nInput:Jill is 6 years older than her sister, but her sister's age is 4 times Jill's age.

How fast was the car going when the first witness saw it?\nOutput: Let the speed of the car be x.\nThe distance that the car traveled was x*250\nThe time taken was x*252\nThe time taken was d = x*252 = <<x*252=250000>>25000 ft\nThe distance to was d = d/x = 25000 / x = <<25000/x=2000>>2000 ft\nIf the car was traveling at velocity x to start with, then half of it's time traveling would be half of x\n(Time = x * 0.5)\nSo (1/2 * x * 252) = <1/2 * x*252=125100>>12510 ft\nThe speed of the car at the first position with respect to its start point is x * 12510 = <<x*12510=1500>>1500 ft\nSo the speed is 1500 ft/s\nSo the final answer for the speed of the car is 150 ft/s or 150 ft//min\nSo this question should be re-formed as \"How much time does it take for the car to travel 150 ft\"\nAnswer: Time = Distance / Speed = 2000/150 = <<2000/8>>8 times or 4 times\n\nInput:A ship leaves port in New York and travels n miles at speed of k mph.

How many miles did they walk on each day?\nAnswer:A: 51 B: 68 C: 76 D: 98\nOutput: If they average 20 miles per day in three days, they are walking 51, 68, and 76 miles each day.\nThe rest period of the first day is the sum of the first day's total distance, or 20 miles. We know this because 20 = 20/5\nSo on the first day, they walk 20 miles and rest for four-fifths = <<4/5=0.8>>0.8 miles, for a total of 20.8 miles\nOn the second day they walk 51 miles, resting 1/2 = 0.5= 22.5 miles, for a total distance walked of 73.5 miles.\nOn the third day they walked 68 miles, with a rest period that includes the whole total distance that they walked on the first two days, or 121 miles.\nSo their total distance walked on every day was 51, 73.5, 68.\nSo the final answers are 51, 121, and 68 miles.\n\nInput:The ratio of adults to children is 5 : 3.

The hose is long enough to reach all the way from the jugs to your front door, which is 5000 feet away. There is no water in your house. How do you get all of the water from both jugs into your house without drawing up any air in the hose?\nOutput: To move all liquid from the jugs to the house, you must pull a gallon of milk out of the jug containing milk and pour the contents into the jug with water. Then move that gallon of water from the jug with water to your house. That process removes 1 gallon of liquid and replaces it with 1 gallon of water, so the jugs remain exactly half full of water each. Do this for the other 1 gallon of the jug with water and no more steps are required. Do this for the jug with milk only once:\nAfter that you simply pull each remaining gallon of liquid out and replace them inside with gallons of equal volume of water. There is no way to fill your house without drawing up some air.\nSo the final ansver is E\n\nInput:The sum of the numbers in a series is 50 more than the double of the first number in the series.

Next, 8 * (4 * 7) == 774. Then, 774 + 14 == 788. Then, 788 + 8 == 796.

The restaurant decides to give away 10,000 meals for free to the 5,001st through the 5,500th person to respond to the advertisement.  How many people are offered a free meal?\nOutput: Using the online service to hire the employees should have been done in a certain order.  If they had done it right, the last person that applies to a job would get the job.  Since the restaurant is giving away 10,ooo meals, they are going to serve 10,0oo meals in total.  If there are 5,005 people being served and 10,025 free meals, they are giving out 10 meals to about 2 people.  Since 2/5,005 = <<2/5,025=0.004%>>0.004%, it's very likely that the restaurant is going to give meals to more than 2 people.  So the answer is 2\n\nInput: If a truck carries 6 bushels of wheat in the cargo area, how many bushels can it carry in its bed, not including the cab and engine?\nOutput: Cargo- bed ratio 6:4\nSo in the bed the truck can carry (4/3)6=<<(4/3)6=(4*4*3/6)=(12*3)/(2*3*(2*3))=12>>16/6\n\nInput: Mr. Bold, who enjoys riding his bike at a steady clip, uses a wheelchair when he wants to travel at a speed of 4.9 MPH.

If you cut an apple from each end, you must leave at least one half of an apple to give it away. How many apples does the tree have? (You can also cut one or more pieces from both sides of every apple. It's up to you.)\nOutput:The tree must have at least one half of one apple left (because that's the only way to get a whole apple), so we can't cut away more than half of each apple. Therefore each apple must weigh half the weight of each apple (this may require you to add fractions, like 7/8 or 3/4).  The tree must therefore contain 3 apples of each kind (which is equal to 3 of both 1/2 and 3/4 of an apple).\nSince there are an even number of appels on the tree, the only possible way to get an even number is to add on a 1/2 or a 3/4 apple.\nSince there are an uneven number of apples, any way to get an even amount must have an apple that we would have had to leave behind.\nSo the final ansewer is 3\n\nInput:\nThere are 6 green socks and 4 blue socks in a drawer.\nThere are 3 red socks and 4 green socks in another drawer.\nThere is a red hat in the first drawer", "answer": "B: grocery bag"}

Sheep are herbivores, eating grass, so the answer must be a herbivore's habitat.\nSheep's habits include grazing, so they can't be carnivores or omnivores.\nSo this leaves us with choice C.\n\nInput: A tiger's coat is colored to blend in\nwith grass and leaves. The tiger stands in one spot, pretending to be a\npiece of grass or greenery. It's a really good disguise, until other\ngrass moves.  What changes the disguise?\n\nOutput: A tiger stands in one position to blend in.  The tiger should change\nits position in order to blend in.\nThe other way it can fool a hunter would be to walk away from the hunter,\nwalk a tree trunk, and jump out. When a hunter sees a green or greenish\nobject, a tiger should move away as fast as possible until it is outside\nof the hunter's vision, and then stop moving as quickly as possible so it\ncan hide behind a tree or another object that is less likely to move.\nThe tiger is a predator so it can't be an herbivore.  We could look at each\noption and figure out the likeliest answer, like a grassland or a desert\nThe obvious first response is a forest, but we know a tiger is nocturnal, so\na desert would be best.\nSo the final answers are desert\n\nInput: The snake eats rodents and fish that it finds.

The problem is asking how many times greater is s^2 / (t + w)^2 than s/t. This is asking for the square root of s/t, since the denominator can be reduced to 1/4, we can find the answer to this question by taking the square root, and then we are left with a s = s^2/t.\nSo the final question is 4s/t^2 = 4s^2/t^2 = sqrt[4/4s/t] = sqrt[4s/t]. Since we are finding a square-root, this would be equal to the fraction of s/t. The fraction of 4/t equals the fraction of 4 s/t, which is equal to s/t, and since we previously found t to be equal to sqrt", "answer": "C: wyoming"}

{"text": "A:  Milk that has curdled is referred to as cheese; however, cheese often undergoes further steps to make it appropriate for human consumption.\nFungus needs a food source to use and cheese that has curdled already has a food supply for the fungus. Fungus grows only on organic matter.  Fungus is a living entity that feeds on and survives off of living matter.  While cheese is food and food is living matter, it has not been alive after it has been made.  Fungus can grow on cheese that is decaying because the food supply is living (it is not organic and it is rotting and becoming organic)\nThis fungus, when grown on other foods, is considered edible in some cultures.  Cheese is an organic food that has not been growing since it was made. Fungus can only grow on living and organic matter.\nSo the final statement answer is B\n\nInput: The population of the world was 9.8 billion in 2016. How many people would the world have to add every year so that its population grew by 1.78 billion in 1900?\nOutput: We can solve this without doing any math.\nThe increase in population from 1900 is 1.78, which is 1.71 x 10^15.  1.71 is the number of years that passed between 1900 and 2016, so in that time the population increased by 17.8 billion.  The population of the world increased by more than that, so it cannot have been growing at that rate.  Something has to grow at that rate.\nIn every one year since 1900, there would need to be an increase of exactly one billion; or in decimal form, we can say the increase needs to be 1,000,000, or 1,005.  The increase of the population needs to be exactly one billion (or 0.001 billion) every single year.\nSo the final state answer is D\n\nInput: A new city is planning to build housing for 85,000 people.

After the coach made a few changes to the roster, there were 80 players in the baseball games of the second season. If 124 players were on the roster at the start of the third season, how many players were on the rosters of each subsequent season, if the roster sizes are increasing by 30 players each season?\nOutput: The question gives us 1 sequence, in which the first season has 65 and the roster is increasing by 30 each season. The middle season from the formula \"65*x\" could have been any number, but it had to have been in the interval of between 30 and 124.\nAfter the first season, the roster is increasing 30 each season, so the roster in season 2 will increase by 30, which increases the total from 65 to 95. This makes the rosters in the 3rd season increase by 30. Therefore, we have 65+95+95=<<65+95=155>>155 players overall.\n\nIf you're having trouble understanding why there is an extra 10 players for the first season, it is because you have to start somewhere, in the 1st, 55th and 100th season, there is 1 season missing, so there is a 1 time step between when each roster increases. \n\nSo the", "answer": "A: ignore"}

He then had the option to buy a quart or to spend the money left over on the milk. Therefore, the original answer is incorrect.\nIf he spent the money left over on another item, he would only have enough money to spend half of it which would be a 1\u20442 a dollar. Meaning he bought a 1/2 gallon of water on a 1/4 gallon of water. (1/4) + ((\u00bd) \u2044 2) = 1/2 gallons of water, thus the correct answer is 1\u20442 gallons of water\n\nInput: An antique collector has three antique clocks with the", "answer": "A: burlap sack"}

What is the minimum average she would need for an 80% if she is receiving A's?\nOutput: Sara receives an A in a class if she makes higher than 90% of the class average. Since her class average is 85%, she could make at the very least 95% to make an A. Since she is going to be required to make an 80%, she would only need to make 85% in that class.\nSince she is thinking about studying hard, she will obviously try to make a perfect 100% since she thinks it will be required. If she makes a 100%, then her 80% is 65%.\n80/85 = 100/<(85", "answer": "A: wage war"}

Choice A: The cent amounts are each even. B: The cent amounts add up to 5000. C: One cent amount is one-third of a flower cent amount. D: The cent amount is the same for each flower. E: The other four countries are Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, and Tanzania. Choice F: The amount of money given is not enough to buy the flower. F: The amount of currency given is 5000 francs.\nOutput: To begin, it must be noted that all five countries have 100 cent amounts.\nBecause one cent's amount is the same as each country flower's name, it must be one cent equals one-third of one flower's cent amount.\nFrom here, we can determine that one-third of each flower cent's amount equals 5000 = 100 x 100 x <<50=500>>50 cents.\nThis can be calculated to say that if it takes 500 cents to buy the national flower,\nthen it takes 100/<<50/1=5>>5 flower cent amounts to be 500 cenutm in money.\nThe flower cent amounts must each be an even number.\nThis is because if one flower cent's amount is equal to the same as the national flower cent's amount,\nthen it must mean that the amount of each flower equal to 1/3 of the national flower cent amount.\nThis then means that each flower cent amount must be an even number because of the equality relationship between the one national flower cent amount and the one cent equals 1/3 relationship.\nThis means that each flower cent must be 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16,etc...\nWe are now able to conclude that", "answer": "B: wristwatch"}

How high is the tallest pile of garbage at the dump in days, not tons?\nOutput: Every day the truck delivers garbage that weighs 700 tons.\nBecause 700 / 2.5=<<700/2.5=280>>280 tons of garbage is brought away per truck, 16 trucks of garbage are brought away per day.\nThere is a 70 truck limit per week to how many tons of garbage can be brought away.\nThe total amount of garbage that is brought away is 70*7*4= << 70*7=490>>490 tons\nTo calculate the height of the pile, 700*4.5 = <<700*4=[[700*4]]>>3000*4.9 = <<3000*7*4.9=[[3000*3*7*4.5=3]]>>3 tons have been collected.\nSo the final height is 3000 tons/4.9 = << 3000/4.9=378>>378 feet or 3,780 feet.\n\nInput:  The population of a city is growing larger each year.

How many yogurts does the yogurt club consume?\nOutput:If the yogurts are consumed by the members of the club each week, this means that there were 25 + 17 = <<25+17=42>>42 students in the club.\nSince there are four yogurts per person, this means the club eats at least 4 * 42 = <<4*42=168>>168 yogurts.\nSince they eat a minimal of 42 yogurts per week but that still doesn't add up to the total amount consumed in the last week, the members probably either ate more or ate the yogurts in more than one way, like having them for breakfast, lunch, snack, and dinner, or maybe even feeding a yogurt to their dog.\nHence, the final answer is 286 yogurts. \n\nInput: In a school where all numbers were rounded up to the nearest ten, 33% of the students were rounded down when their grades were averaged, 66% of the students were not affected by rounding, and a final 1% of the students were affected by the rounding.

{"text": "A. backyard\n\n### Rationale:\nBecause the process of smoking or grilling meat slowly and low-heat is popularly referred to barbeque.\n#### \n####\n\n### Input:\"I like  a song from The Beatles that's on their Abbey Road album.\" Choices:  A) Abbey Road B) Let It Be C) 1 D) Magical Mystery Tour\n\n### Response:\"Let It Be\" is the song from The Beatles' \"Abbey Road\" album.\n\n### Rationales:\"The Beatles' Abbey Road album\" can be used as a subject when referring to the album. The Beatles is an alternative object. If you were to use the phrase \"The Beatles' music\" you would not require an article. Similarly, to refer to either a specific song or an entire album you need to use \"the\" before Abbey Road or Let It Be. \"Abbey Road\" and \"Let It Be\" can be used as objects because the listener/reader is most likely familiar with the content of the album.\n#### \n\n### Input\nThe temperature of a hot water heater starts at 100\u02da Fahrenheit (37.8\u02da Celsius) and increases at a rate of 10\u02da Fahrenheit per minute for the first hour, then 5\u02da Fahrenheit per week thereafter. When does it reach 100\u02da C\n### Response\nIf the water takes an hour, 100C = 100 x (37.8)+ (1 x 100) = << 100(37.8)+ 100 = 278.8>>278.8Deg C.\n\n### Note\nYou can solve for more than one constant by using the same value for one and solving by substitution.", "answer": "E: barbeque"}

If playing soccer for a while leads to fatigue, I can define y as x-t where t is time, and then y= (x-t) for any variable x, so by definition y=x-t. If y=x-t then, x-2t=y for x, t=2, and then x=2t+y=2t+t-t=2t+x-1. At t=5x(since t is the amount of time playing for) then when x=5, y=0 because x-2t=5-10=5-15=0.

This worker can repair 8/4 of the machine in 1 day and since 4 workers is taken for repairing the machine this time 4/24 of the machine is repaired in 1 day. Then the time taken for repairing the machines of 8th day is equal to 4/24 and since it takes 8 days for repairing the machines this can be equal to 48/24 which is equal to 425/144. Then another worker having a rate of repairment of 4 days assigned. Then this worker can repair 4/4 of the machine, which is half the machine and since 4 workers are taking for repairing the machine then 2/24 of the machines is 4/24 which is equivalent to 4/2.

The minimum number of grapes to be eaten is 50.\nIf a total of 50% of all grapes are eaten, there must be 50 grapes eaten. Since the minimum number of grapies eaten is 5, the total number of grapies available each month is 50-5=<<50-5=45>>\nThe minimum number of apples eaten is 3, so all apples eaten are also 3 (since there are 3 apples every 5 grapes). Therefore, for a month with 45 grapes, 5*3=<<5*3=15>>1\n5 grapies eaten, there are 15 apples eaten.\nIf a total 300 grapes are available each month, 100% of all gaps are eaten.

Operating cost in a broad sense will always depend on the scale of the school, which will vary based on the population of the school. In this sense, enrollment does affect operating costs, however, there could also be costs associated with additional students such as new teachers hires, or other necessities. But, the cost of new teachers hires is not very likely to be affected by enrollment. I also cannot make any conclusions about the cost of electricity, water, or heating costs because the size of the building, the number of students, and their schedules are factors in determining the cost of running it.\n\nHowever, there are costs that cannot be impacted by enrollment. The building is not likely to change much, so the electricity, water, and heating costs cannot change much either. A decrease in enrollment would require a decrease in building space used, which would decrease the cost of paying for a building.\n\nIn conclusion, it is more likely that operating cost in the narrowest sense would be unaffected by enrollment, meaning that its the cost of teachers that is the least likely to be affected by the amount of students.\n\nAnswer:\n\n#### C\\n\\nOperating cost is a very broad concept, we could \n be talking about general operating costs, or we could be \n talking about operating cost in more specific sense. \n Operating cost in a broa sense will always depend on \n the scale of the school which will vary based on \n the population of the school, the operating cost in this \n sense will always have a close tie to the amount of \n students in the school.

That is, each response will have approximately 3 or 4 answers that are incorrect but have no or rare chances in the game.\n\n### Choice: C\n\n## Solution:\n\n### Instructor Notes:\nThe teacher's game plan is to add dots from one player to another. That way all of the players will be in competition with one another. If one player starts with more dots or less, they will be more likely to receive more by requesting a change. In order to win the game, the players must get rid of all of their dots, and in order to do that, they must play the game.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStrategy to win the game depends on:\n\n1. The number of dots.\n2. How other players play the game.\n3. How does the teacher choose the number of dots. \n\nWhat is the strategy of a player to win the game, if the teacher gives the same number of dots for every player?\n\n### Answer:\na. If another player goes first and gets rid of all his dots, then your strategy is to win the game.\n\nWhat is the best strategy for a player who plays before another player in a game which he/she decides to play?", "answer": "C: income"}

In the blank next to each choice is printed the part of speech and the corresponding preposition that would be used to complete the sentence.  All three tasks shown here refer to the same person and context, but the answer choices for the three tasks might be somewhat different.\n\n\n### You are to make a selection for the last blank in the sentence. Complete the selection, and then place an appropriate preposition in the blank, using the key below. (The preposition should come before the chosen choice.) The preposition choices are listed below to help remind you.\n\nIn the sentence, it is unclear whether the capital or the country is the people being referred to.\nIt seems that a verb (like people) is referred to when it says people, but a noun (like a state) is referred to when referring to the country.\nAlthough the options include A and E. A: capital and B: state, both options seem incorrect.\nHowever, option C should be accepted. For option A, the subject of the sentence is referring to the capital, not the state. The capital can be defined as a building. This building cannot \u201cgo to\u201d the state. However, a state can be \u201cgo to\u201d the capital. Thus, option C should be the right choice because the sentence is referring to \u201cstate\u201d and NOT capital so A and B are incorrect; C is the right choice.\n\nThe state of union is referred to both as capital and as country.\nWhen referring to a speech (e.g. state of union), a verb like describe would be used. However, in option A, a noun like capital is used. Thus, option D should be the correct answer.\n\n### Prepositions: This task requires the use of more than one preposition.

In africa, people also live under certain conditions too like poverty. In Africa, tribal war breaks out quite frequently too so Africa is quite different from a village.\nRural area and big city are similar because both consist of large crowds of people moving in and out of places and interacting with one another. People in both areas can be seen to be more active because they are exposed to much outside factors which impact their lives too much. A village is the opposite of a city because a village can be a lot less dense in terms of population. Villages in the country are smaller and quieter than cities whereas villages in urban areas can be a bit more dense and rowdy than country villages.\n\n##### Input:In the mall, 64.5% of the people shop in the food court, 78% of the people eat in the food court, and 66.67% of the people go to the food court.

The word \"yard\" refers directly to the outside, so of all the rooms in a building, the first choice should be outdoor-related. The word \"senses\" is used, which refers to the five ways humans perceive or interpret sensory information that comes from inside and/or out of their bodies.

Each of your four sisters needs a pair and all but two of your brothers need a pair.

So for the shoes not needed it doesn\u2019t matter which pair: there are 7 pairs.

This should lead to a simple 6C3=75/45 =1.5 as a desired answer, but there are some more things to take into consideration.  As the question asks about \"Nephews & Nieces\" we should assume that at least some kids have different fathers than others.

How many books does Jake own?\nRationales If we write the following equation,\n\nRed + Blue+Green=7\nThen if we simplify it into the equation\n(4B + 2G - B) = Red\n=> Blue + Green = Red+4B+2G-B\n=> Blue+Green+Red+2G=7\nThen 7=(((B+2)Red+2G))\nThen,\n((B+2)Red+(Red+2G)) = 7\nB+2Red+2Red+2G-Green = 7\nThus,\n(2B+2Red+4Red+3G)+G = 7\n(2B+3Red+7Red+3G)+B = 7\nIf we factor 2B out of the equation\nThen,\nB+3Red+3Red+7=B+7Red\nIf we set B to 0, the answer is\n\n3Red+3Red = 7\n\nAnswer is, C\n\n### Demostration:\nWrite a sentence or brief paragraph that describes the scenario and task.

This is the approximate price to rent a bike or a roller blade for 3 hours. Divide by 3 and that would be [14.4]. This would be the price to rent a helmet for 3 hours.\n\nThe cost of renting a bike, a skateboard, and a helmet for 6 hours would be, 3 times the cost of renting 3 hours, which would be ((44/3), or 14.666 [14.6].\n\nThe total cost would be [144] if they rented the bikes for a full 6 hours, which would be [(14.66 +14.6)6]\n\nThis is a little off based on a little extra, but [44*6] is about right.\n\n### Expert's Rationale:The total price of renting a biest, a skateboard and a helmet is around 44 dollars.

By plugging 3 1/2 into the equation for 42/x and then multiplying both sides by x, we find that x would have to be approximately 10 7/8 x.\n\n####5.36 times faster\n\nAnswer: \n## Rationales:\nAssume it takes one second to walk one hundred feet. The dog walks from F to I at 5.36 times as fast (i.e., more than 5 times as fast). \n\nSo to get from F to I, the dog travels 100/5.36 = 18.7 feet in 1 second, or 55.88 feet in 2 seconds. From I to J, the dog travels at a slower pace, so it takes him 55.86 feet to get from I to J in 2 seconds. The dog travels (55.88 + 55.8) feet, which is 111.7 feet. \n\n####2x\n\nAnswer: 60\nThis problem says that it takes him 2 more hours for each hour spent in the kennel. \n\nSo for every first hour at the kennel, the cat would be in the kennel for 6 hours. \n\nFor every extra second, the cat would be at the kennel for (60+2)/60 = 36/60 = 2 extra minutes.\n\n\n\n\n####3x\n\nRationales:(", "answer": "D: toy store"}

He knows the difference between the two blood pressure readings, where the first reading is always 5 points greater than the second. What is the greatest difference between 2 readings that are less than or equal to a maximum blood pressure level of 140/90?\n\n### Solution:\n\n### Rationale:\nDr. Kai is always unsure of the specific numbers as the difference between the readings is always 5 points. This means the first reading is always greater than the second by 5.\nDifference between 2 readings for maximum blood pressure level of  140/99 = 140x140-90x90/14-9/14.\nThe greatest is <140 -90/14 which is <5 which is 5 5x140/9 which is 5^2 = 25 so the greatest difference is 5^2 which is 25 (answer)\n\n### Option 1\n\nBecause of the maximum level of 14x14 which means 16 total differences.\nWhen the blood pressure is over 160/120, the difference should be closer to 0\nTherefore  160x160-120x120/16-12/16 > 0\n\n### Option  2\n\nBecause of a maximum level of 160/80, the difference should get smaller and smaller.\nWhen the blood 160/70, the difference should equal", "answer": "B: motel room"}

Dane starts at a point that is 5 meters away from an edge that makes a perpendicular angle from his line of travel and makes a diagonal move.  He then makes a straight diagonal move.  Evan is starting at an opposite angle on the edge.  Dane's edge is 10 degrees down from Evan (in either direction). Dane's line segment crosses Evan's line segment at a point on his edge.  How much farther will it take Evan to cross Dane's line?\n\n### Response\nD\n\n### Why Answer D: Rationales: I think that it will take Evan longer to cross Dane' s line because Dane is making snow angels, and it will probably take longer to make a snow angel than a straight line. Also, Dane has already made a diagonal from his original line of travel, while Evan will not have made an angle until he passes Dane.\n\n#### D\nAnswer: D\n\n### Input\nThe answer for a certain math problem is 16.1, and the answer for a problem based on a different variable is 276.

You want to know how to get a letter count 3 or above, so this answer requires a method similar to the one I made when I first saw the word problem.\nWhat I would do is start by adding the \"what?\" and the question mark as these will not be counted as characters:\n\n```\nThe friends loved competing\n+ against one another\n== what?  (5)\n\ncompeting\n+ against one another  (13)\n== what? (19)\n```\n\nNow we can just start working from there, making sure this answer is just a certain number of letters which in this case should be 19.\n\n```\nWhat??  (19)\n\nWhat???  (20)\n\nWhat????  (21)\n\nWhat?????  (22)\n\nWhat??*********  (25)\n\nWhat??*?!!*  (24)\n\nWhat??!?!?!?!  (25 - the word \"defeat\" has been replaced with?!)\n```\n\nThere are other ways that seem to work, such as simply adding the question mark, but the? characters get ignored by the solver and the answer comes out as 26.\n\n### For the sake of writing code, I decided to find some constants to use when writing code. This is what I came up with when using Python.\n\n```python\nconst_letters = \"abcdefghijklnopqrstuvwxyz\n          abcdedfghijklnoprstuvwxyz?!\"\n```\n\nIt helps to work on a line with linebreaks. You can simply type const_letters into a cell to get a constant with the letters separated by single spaces, whereas Python has to keep it in single quotes to make it a constant.\n\nSo a good question would be to first see what Python thinks is a good answer for the first input, \"how long are the shadows\".

How much candy did Raul buy if he spent the exact amount at each?\n\n### DemoResponse:\nInput: If he spent $4 x 2 = <<$4\\cdot2=8>>8 at each location, he would have $8 x 3 = <<8\\cdot 3=24>>24 dollars and 99 cents.\nAltogether, he bought $24.99 worth of candy.\nAltogether, the total amount of candy bought was $24 + $1 = <<20>>20.\nNotes: It is better explained by using two cases:\nCases: Case A: 24.99 dollars and 99 cent.\n\tNotes: The case that is easier to explain is 25 dollars and 99cent.\nThis is because of the rounding.\n\tIn the first case, the amount of candy for each different type is 8.00 dollars and 41 cents.  However, when it is rounded to $8.00 it is actually equivalent to $7.99\n\tThat is, both are equivalent to $8.09 dollars.  So, when buying the candy it would be rounded to $7.90 (when buying the large box)  and $7.99 when buying the small box.  The rounding makes it easier to find his total purchases.\n\tThe question is asking for dollars and cents, and rounding helps to find the total number without having to find each separately.\n\nCase B: 24.00 dollars and.99 cents\n\tThe round down of the number to find 24 dollars and 20 cents.\n\n\n##", "answer": "A: exhilaration"}

III:The makers spent a lot of time on it. \n\n### Response : Choice II seems the most appropriate answer that appropriately completes this task.\n\n### Coders\nWe used a library called Python.\n\n---\n### Python Basics\n- A variable is a way of storing information that can be used later.\n- You can use any text you like in Python, regardless of case. \n- Dash is Python\u2019s version of dashes and underscores. The Python interpreter distinguishes them, so one of each is used to indicate that words are variables (for example, x=3).\n- The Python Interpreter checks for capitalization errors. In other words, if any variable name is improperly capitalized or capitalized at all, it will not be recognized.\n- Python interpreters do not check for syntax. Any code that is not recognized as an error is treated as valid Python.\n- If you do accidentally run a bit of code that is not recognized, you will get an error and be able to figure out what is wrong. However, if you choose not to do that, you can type what you want to run in, click on the run button, and wait for your result to be returned.\n- Since Python is case-sensitive, you will need to keep track of where you are in the code. This is done with parentheses.\n- All of the code that a Python program contains is contained in a pair of parentheses. If you wanted to print out the number 3, for example, you would write the following statement:\nprint(3)\nThis would result in the number 3 being returned to you as the output.\n- Within a set of parentheses, your code is contained. Your code has the following format:\n- statement_1;...; statement_n\n- statement_n is the final statement.\n- You can think of a Python program as being divided into groups", "answer": "A: special"}

Thus it should be written as \"fifth play\".\n2.Similarly, the phrase \"throw away the ninth play\" indicates that the correct number of plays would be \"ninth play\" and not \"ninth + 1 plays\" because we are subtracting the number of plays after \"throw away the nineth play\".\n3.The phrase \"The fifth play (the one that you make)\" indicates the fourth play (the one before you make the fifth play).

{"text": "A B C D E A\n\n### Demostration Response:\nThe first thing that you want to do is to find out what each group of options means.\nSo to get this started, there is the question, \"What kind of science\". Since A stands for \"traditional science\", we would assume traditional\nscience to be an option since the options would include science as a whole.\nAfter that, you can try looking at what each option represents. So for instance, A and C represent maths and for B and D, those would represent\nsocial sciences and traditional science. As for E, which stands for dancing, we can assume that it represents something related to art.\n\nAfter that, you may want to look for patterns or any similarities between the options. Whenever you notice any similarities, you want to\ndetermine whether those similarities could be grouped into two or more different groups.\n\nSo in the case of this question, A, C and E have something in common since they refer to art and that could be easily grouped into one group to\nrepresent art.\n\nB and D, on the other hand, also share something in common since they both refer to social sciences and as a result, they could be easily\ngrouped into one group as well.\n\nSince both A and E refer to arts, and since both B and D refer to social sciences, A and E, B and D all have one thing in common and as a\nresult, it's safe to assume that both A and E, B, and D could be safely grouped together in two separate groups representing the different\nparts.\n\nSo that being said, let's group B into the first one and A and E into the second one.\n\nNow for C, let's see if we can match it up with another group. Since a lot of social sciences tend to involve the study of either politics or\nhistory, one could safely group C into the second group represented by D since we've already paired B with that group.\n\nSo based on what we are left with after matching up the different groups, the only group that is remaining to pair up with the third choice\nE is group D.\n\nThe only group D has remaining to pair up with is group B.\n\nSo when you start grouping B and E, you are going to see that they share something in common and as a result,", "answer": "B: history studies"}

The remaining beers is 8 - 9 which is -1.  This was the original value of 8, so one less which is a remainder of zero.\n\nInput: Five less three times the number of birds equals the number of apples. Four more apples equals the number of bananas. Four less the sum of the number of apples and bananas equals eight. How many apples and bananas are there altogether?\nRationales : Three times the number of birds is 3*a\nFive less three times the number 3*a is equal to number of birds.\n4n =4* a, where n is the number of apples\nFive add four to the number of birds are 5+4=n.\n4n-n=4-n and 8 = 4- 4 n\n5n-8=4, this cannot be simplified. The number of bananas is 4(12n) which equals 4n.\nThis means 3*a + 4n = 36\nn = 12.\nTherefore there is 12*4 = 48 apples and bananas.\n\nInput: One less than twice the number of pencils is equal to half the number of notebooks.

When we multiply numbers that's what we get tens and units. Then we round up 3 digits.We round up because round up give us a bigger number.  When we multiply two-digit and two-digit numbers we can get 40. Then we round up for bigger numbers.\nIf we multiply two two-digit numbers we have 8. Then we round up.\n\n### Response and Explanation:\n\nAnswer: It would be up because when we write 3x3= 9 when we write 2x2 it is 4 but when we write 9 there is not number because when we multiply 2 and 2 is 4.

Each person paid $24 for admission, and the concert made $8.24 in total. How many tickets were there?\n\n### Response 2\n\nThe number 8 divided by the number of tickets would yield a fraction with the denominator of 350/2. Since the concert was made $8.2 in total, we can say that the concert earned a total amount of 8 dollars and $0.2 cents in total. Therefore, the concert made 0.222 dollars per ticket.\n\n### Rationales:\n\n#### Why does this task say to start with \"Two hours after a concert...\"?\n\nTwo hours after the concert, the concert would end and therefore, the concert made its $8,24 worth of money in that span of time\n\n#### What fraction represents the number of tickets?\n\nThrough dividing 8 by the number of tickers, we can obtain the fraction with the denominator 350/3\n\n#### Why did I add a decimal after the numerator?\n\nI added a decimal and didn't subtract it later on. The concert earned $8.24, and the number of tickets was 350.

{"text": "The correct response for the above choice is E. A desk normally occupied by young person is located in the gym. The desk is taken up by a very young person at night time (while the gym is closed). That makes this choice (E) the best.\n#### Answer:\nE\n\n### Input, choices:  A: classroom B: home C: beach D: dorm room E: park\n\n### Response or rationales for choosing the correct answer choice:\nThe choice D (dorm room) makes a lot of sense given the answers in the above input (if I was a student, I would study at my dorm room). Also it is very logical if you have to live in a dorm and are a student. That makes the answer D. The other choices are very illogical to me, especially the park choice (are we going to sleep in the park in tents?). The beach choice is not practical unless you just happen to be a rich young person able to afford living in beaches (and we all know this in our real world). The home choice is not much different from the dorm choice. The classroom choice - well that is a choice that I will never agree with as a student and I suspect most of the students also prefer the D choice. The last choice is the correct answer - that should be really easy for you to figure out.  \nThe correct answer to the above input and choices is choice D (dorm rooms).\n#### Answer:\nD\n\n### Input Choicess:A: kitchen B: car C: office D: workshop E: schoolroom F: barn\n\n### Rationales for choosing the correct option.\nThe car choice is a very illogical answer as it could be done only at highways. In fact, I suspect that the car is a very last choice for you when it comes to study. The choice A (kitchen) makes sense because everyone lives near the kitchen and studying is very much related to living and food. Living with the family it is not possible to read a book without anyone distracting you. Also some cooking is sometimes required while you are studying even after you finished school or college. At the end of the day, the correct choice is B (classroom) as it is the only place where you can keep your family and belongings locked and just go and read (and even sleep!).", "answer": "B: schoolroom"}

{"text": "In order to know if someone is telling a lie, you must listen to the body language and other signs they give off. Although sometimes, people can feel nervous or uneasy with the topic they are speaking about and become awkward. This can also mean that they are telling the truth and not lying. People that are lying are going to change their body language such as keeping their head down and avoid eye contact. They will keep on talking but will not be able to focus on the conversation. They will also feel guilty that they were telling a lie and become so nervous. Also, a lier will avoid looking people in the eye, have trouble keeping up with their responses, and they might even fall asleep. However, someone who is telling the truth will not feel as guilty while doing these things. For example, if they are in a situation where they are lying, they will usually feel uncomfortable but not guilty. Also, a truth teller will not feel nervous while talking but might feel nervous because they are so excited to give out the truth which could possibly lead to them being so talkative. When you are conversing with someone there will be a lot of clues you can give out and there are ways to identify when someone is lying.\n\n######Answer: C\n\n### Instructions:\nTell whether the sentence is TRUE or FALSE\n\n### Insturctions 2:\nRewrite the sentence so that it is true.\n\n### Explanations:\n\n### Sentence:In 1840, New York City made it illegal to have a dog without papers.\n### Sentence 2: The 1920\u2019s was during prohibition in the United States.\nSentence 1: True\nSentence 2: False\nCorrect Sentence: In the 1840\u2019s, New York City made illegal it to own a pet without papers.\n\n### Sentences:Amy was in 8th grade when she started to play violin.

When ten new guests arrive, each additional guest subtracts exactly the square of the number of guests already present. If exactly one more guest arrives, how many people will be at the party after 20 guests have arrived?\nRationales:: The number of people at the party was initially 78. Adding ten guests to this number will result in 78. This is because 78+10=<<78+10=>79>>79. This holds in the case of all the guests arriving because adding them has no impact on the outcome and if you multiply the number 79 by 10 you can see the final answer will be 790.\nWhen the party is at the point of 790 guests arriving, if exactly one more guest arriving, then it will become 790*1=<<790*1=>790>>790. This is because once the one extra person turns the number into an odd one then the outcome doesn't change anymore.\nThe number of guests that are added in the process should be taken into consideration to compute the final answer. In the question, 20 guests arrived before arriving to the final number of 790. This means that 20*790=<<20*79=15800>>15800 guests had already been added before the party was at its final outcome. \nIf the person arrives at 15800 guest, this will result in 15801=<<15801=>17200>>17200 guests which is not part of the equation.

{"text": "D- change of color\n\n### Rationale:\n\n- C- death and decay\nA- sleeping longer\nB- getting colder\n\n- D- Change of color- a color change is the most dramatic visual change that will happen at the point of death, once the heart has stopped beating. The skin will look pale or gray, but once the heart stops no blood will be pushed around the body and there will be no color left at all. That\u2019s all because of the circulatory system. With a normal flow of oxygenated blood, our skin will be as red as our lips. Our lips aren\u2019t bright red because that\u2019s the color of the blood, it\u2019s very dark red. The color has been changed once the body has oxidized the hemoglobin that contains that colorful bright red pigment, making it much darker but still red. So when the circulatory system stops pumping blood out, with no flow of blood the color will fade, making the skin turn blue or gray, or pale yellow. The skin will still look like skin, and the eyes will be bright white, and there is no movement. If you want to know that for sure, put a stethoscope to the chest and try to hear a heartbeat. There is no need to check for the absence of pulse, just put a stethosphere to the chest with the heart side down and listen hard.

Concerts could require paper programs as well because they usually require performers.

A member of the group suggests that the student club sponsors a trip. What does the adjective sponsors signify? Choices: A: organizes B: participates C: directs D: oversees E: advises\n\n### Response:(1 pt)\n\n### Rationales:\n\n### Answer\n\nThe word Sponsors in the sentence means that the group of students is asking another group, or an individual, to organize the trip itself. This means that the student group is having someone else direct the activity for them and take care of all of the details. The word sponsors means that the one organizing the field trip will be the one responsible for the logistics and planning. They will also advise them on which trips to choose as well.\n\n### The sentence asks for the group of students to find a place for the class to take a field.

The lady slept from  2 to 4 meaning she was awake from 4 to 4:20 and from 4:20 to 5 her show started, so her total waking time is 4:20-2=<<4:20-4=0:2>> 0:20-0:2=  0:20-<-2=2>>2  0:20, so her total wake time is 4:30 so 4:30 to 6:30 would be the timing of the one woman show. The lady has 1 waking time of 4:30-6:30 and then her 2 sleep time, so 1:30 to 3:30. This answer is 4:32 to 6:32.", "answer": "C: take center stage"}

The income of taxpayers is now one third of what it was in the early 1980s, and the tax paid by taxpayers is now two thirds of what it was in 1980. If the city decides to raise taxes, how would this decision affect the ratio of taxpayer income to taxes in the year of the decision?\n\n#### Rationales: If the city decides it wants more money from taxpayers, they can choose 1 of 4 options.\n\n1) Raise taxes\n2) reduce taxes\n3) leave taxes the same\n4) Do something else to raise money (like go find new job opportunities for the unemployed)\n\nTaxes = Rate * Income\nIncome - Taxes\nIf the decision from Step 1 is to keep R (rate) the same, then Taxes will increase by their old amount.

This means that the two people at the end of the line will be the two people that are always next to each other. This allows you to choose the 2 people that you are adjacent to the 2 people at the end of your line.

We then need to finish the game with a victory if we want to go to the playoffs.\"\nRationales: One can assume that each quarter has a total of four plays, meaning two halves (each with two plays). The first half contains the first four plays. Therefore, the second half would contain the remainder of the plays, with the play clock starting out with zero. Thus, four plays would be played in the first quarter, one play in the second quarter, three plays in the third quarter, and six plays in the fourth quarter. If the fourth quarter had been played one extra time then it would contain six plus one plays, or seven plays in all. Therefore, in order to finish the quarter with twelve plays total, we need to end each quarter early. (Because we would normally need to finish the last quarter with twelve plays.) In order to end each quarter early, the clock would need to stop when the score differential is at 3 points. In the third quarter, the score differential is at three points (four points in the game total). However, the coach needs to give up six plays in order to end the game before the play clock gets to zero. Thus, the plays in the third quarter are given up so that the plays can be saved for the fourth quarter. The clock does not need to stop when the last couple minutes is 2.5 seconds.

{"text": "They found a tomb \n\n### Input :Dr. Fruin tells his patients that if they want to have a healthy heart, they should not consume salt.  Increased salt intake is a common risk factor for elevated blood pressure, and he's often asked about the proper sodium intake for a healthy heart.  In order to lower your blood pressure, you should eat less salt, not more.  The National Institute of Health recommends that you consume no more than two grams of salt daily.  The recommended daily intake of sodium is 2,300 milligrams. Salt is roughly 40 percent sodium. \n\n### Rationales:There are 2300 milligrms in one gram of salt, so the milligrams in 2 grams of salt will be 2300*2=<<2300*1=4600>>4600\nThis is the total daily required intake of salt. \n#### 4600\nAnswer: 4600", "answer": "B: tomb"}

Who is the closest to Jenny in her family?\nA:  her father's mother\nB:  her father'ssister\nC:  her mother's father\nD:  her mother\nE:  her grandmother\n\n### Response\nLet's analyze the questions to see what the logic behind the question is. Jenny has 3 cows, meaning Jenny has 2 more sisters than cousins. From the question we know that Jenny's mother's mother is the closest, so Jenny's mother is the second closest. Using this logic we eliminate the choices of the grandmother and the father's sister. Next, we know that Jenny has 3 mothers, meaning we can rule out 1 and 3 in the choices. From the question we also learn that Jenny is the closest to her father's sister, meaning the choice can only be A or B.\n\n#### 4\nAnswer: 4\n\n### Instructs:\n1.

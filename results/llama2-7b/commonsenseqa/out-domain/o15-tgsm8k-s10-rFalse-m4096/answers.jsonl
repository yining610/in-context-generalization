Choices:  B: Train C: Metro D: Train+Metro E: Car\nOutput: E\n# The Solution:\n\n# Step 1.\n# If the only mode of transportation is car, the input statement needs to be rejected.\n# Example 1: Adam bought 3 KILOs of nuts and 1.25 kilos of dried fruits for a total cost of $12.00.\n\n# To convert a number of pounds to dollars, we multiply the number of pounds by its unit price and add up the results. Therefore, to convert from $90.00 to pounds, we must subtract the dollar cost ($90.00) from the pound cost ($12.00).\n\n# Example 2: Johns goes to gym 3 times/week, he spends 1 hour lifting weights, 1/3 of lifting weights time is used for warm up and doing cardio, and total time at gym is 4 hours.\n\n# Example 3: James has to fuel his plane.

The company has four departments: Accounting, Human Resources, Sales, and Technical Support. Each department has employees. Employees can be in one department or multiple departments. All employees will only be assigned to one department at a time. \n### Input example\nThe company has six employees. They are in the following order:\nAnnie, Accounting --> John, Sales --> Tina, Accounting\nPeter, Human Resources --> Jack, Sales --> James, Accounting\nSusan, Technical Support --> Laura, Sales\n### Output example\n* A node representing Annie and her \"manager\" John\n![](assets/6de-node.png = 1500x1374 true)\n* A node representing Peter and his \"manager\" Jack\n![](assets/7de-node.png?raw=true = 1506x592 true)\n\n### Part B: \nFor part B, the tree will be modified to include a position parameter. If a manager's position is 3, all of the employees whose'manager' is 3 are all in that manager's department. \n### Instructions:\n1. Add a position data attribute to the Employee class. Position will be an integer and will contain the employee's department manager's position. If a manager is not a manager, their position will be '0'.\n2. Add a manager array attribute to the Employee class.. It will store the managers for the position.\n3. Create two methods called addChild and draw.\na. addChild takes an Employee and a node as parameters. The employee is the child to be added as the argument's child. The node is the node where the employee is added as a child.\nb. draw will create a representation of the employee tree to be output to a specified file. Draw will take the file name and a tree as parameters. The tree, which will be constructed from a list of Employee objects, will be the parent class to use from draw.\n4.

Choices: A: Yes B: No\nOutput: A\n```\n\n## Explanation\n### Input (p1)\nThe p1 has some input. The input consists of three lines. A line is a string of characters. The first line contains some string, for example, \"Adam bought 3 kilogam of nuts and 3 kilo of dried fruit at the store. One kilogram costs $12 and the other of dried fruits costs $8. How many did his purchases cost?\"\n\nThen, in the second line, there is a question mark. In the next line there is a number, for example, \" 56\". The order of the input is important, because we have to know the input first to parse the input. The last line is the output, for example, \"56\". The output contains number only, and no extra information.\n\nThe format of the input:\n```\nInput: Adam bought # kilograms of nuta and $2.5kg of dried fruits. A kilo gram of nuts costs # and the other of dired fruits costs $8k. how much did his purcuses?\nOutput: $138\n```\n\nWe have to parse this input to get the question and number.\n\nIt is a pretty simple task.\n\nHow? We start parse from the beginning.\nEverything after the '#' starts a question.\nWe can parse the output with the following commands.\n\n```\nif ('#' in sentence) and (not 'Output' in sentence) and re.search('[?] ([^ ]*)', sentence):\n                sentence = sentence.strip()\n                questionmark(answer+questionmark)\n                answer+=sentence[6]\n```\n\nWe add a line. This helps us to keep track of the input. We parse the line if it contains a number after a question mark.\n\nOtherwise, we ignore the line and only continue if it contains an output.\n\nThen, we get the answer. We will use the output to get the answer.\n\n### Instruction (1p1)\n###", "answer": "E: toy store"}

Two is two times the square root of seven.\" What does that mean? Your answer can be a number or a phrase or sentence.\nOutput:  When the answer is a number, you must follow the original phrase with the mathematical operation indicated\nOutput:  I want to answer with 0 because, although the square root of seven is between 2-7, the meaning behind this sentence does not seem to be adding. Therefore, 0 is the closest answer.\nOutput:  I think this means that two is a two-faceted man because two has a square face that is two times the root of seven, which is a circle.\nOutput:  The best answer seems to be 0 because the sentence states \"two is two times the square ROOT of seven.\" The square root of seven is approximately 2.79, so the resulting answer must be 2.790.\nOutput:  Since there is a lot of discussion and information being shared, a pie chart would be useful.\n\nInput: The following is a list of costs associated with hosting a dinner party.

How many hours can the plane fly with a half empty tank of fuel?\nOutput:  3\n\n### Instruction:Answer the follow-up questions based on your calculation\n\nInput: The plane in question can only have either a full or half empty tank of gas, can only have a speed of 500 MPH, or a speed of 20 MPH. The question is asking us to calculate how many hours the plane can fly, not how many hours its tank of fuel can last. If it is a full tank of fuel, the tank of gas cannot last for zero hours, but for 3 hours. If it is a half empty tank, the tank of gas lasts for zero hours, but the plane can still fly for 1 hour. We must find the greater of the two numbers and subtract it from half empty. Half empty has nothing to do with it, and if half empty takes place and it's full, there will be no zero hours. There is a third solution, but the calculation is too long to include in the challenge.\n\nOutput: If we assume that the plane in question can only carry a maximum speed of 501 MPH, the answer is 28627315000000\n\nInput The question is asking for the number of hours the car engine will run.  In this scenario, there is no cost of repairing the car, so the \"total cost\" is the same as the answer.

Input: Adam bought 3 kilometers of nuts and 3.5 kilometers of dried fruits, 1 kilogram of nuts cost 12 dollars and 1 kilogram of dried fruits cost 8 dollars.  How much did his purchasing cost?\n```\n254 dollars\n```\nWe're asked to calculate how much Adam spent for his purchases.  We can find the cost per bag of nuts (or per bag of fruit) since the purchases include both bags(and hence the weights of nuts and fruit). Then we can sum up the total cost by multiplying by the amount of each purchased.\ncost_per_kg = 12/3 + 8/3.5\ntotal_cost = cost_per_kg * 6\nThe total cost would equal 72 dollars ($254 is too high because he did not purchase 3.5 pounds of nuts).\n2.

A DP is a programming problem where you need to store the result of subproblems in order to solve the problem.  In this case, the problem of calculating prices given information about quantities is such an example of DP.  There are certain types of DP problems that share the same characteristics.  If you recall from DP Fundamentals, when a problem can be formulated as a recursion (A recursion being a function that applies itself), then we can easily use DP to solve it.  Another way is to simply define the recursion explicitly and then build the function to satisfy the recursion on its own.  In either case, it is pretty obvious that the way to break down the problem of finding the total price for a purchase using DP is by breaking down how much it costs for each item separately, for example.\n\nFor this problem, if we assume that each purchase has a quantity price of $10 (for the purposes of simplicity) and then that the quantity pricing of nuts is defined using an exponential scale ($4 for a kilo, $8 for two kilos, and so on with the number after the power of ten), then we can easily write a recursion that breaks down the price of items by quantity for each purchase. Here, is the recursion that we can use to recursively find the price for each individual item:\n\n```python\ndef findPriceForNut(quantity:int, quantityOfKilograms:int, kgPrice:int) -> int:\n  if quantity == 1:\n    return kgPrice\n\n  if kgPrice == 1:\n   return 4\n\n  return (kgPrice /", "answer": "B: learn about"}

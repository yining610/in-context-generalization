Choices:  A: town B: at hotel C: mall D: business sector E: yellow pages<n>Output:		Choices may or may not be exclusive to each other. Here the question gives some choices and asks to pick one. <n><n>I think the first choice given is the best answer. If the business isn't in a business sector then it is not in any business sector. It would also be a bad idea to open up your business in a mall or the hotel if it is not catering to food for travelers and people that are going to be at the hotel. <n><n>The second choice is at hotel, but since a business restaurant is not likely to be at a hotel or mall, then option B would be the only remaining choice<n><n>Output: I believe this question is asking for a business restaurant to be able to offer what they say on their menu.<n><n>So in this case they are either an Italian or sushi restaurant. If they don't offer either than it would be false.<n><n>Output: In this case the question is asking about types of food that are served at a restaurant. So if both Italian food or sushi is served at a restaurant then it would be catering to both types of customers.<n><n><n><n><n><n>

Then press the calculate button and we will give you the solution<n><n>Input:A family of four, 2 parents and two children went on vacation during the last week of August. The four of<n>them left on Sunday morning and return home on Tuesday night. When counting up on how many days away they<n>got, the mother of the family was puzzled and could not find the right answer to the equation. The mother<n>realized that T+1 is the number of days they had spent away from home, she went back and checked this<n>equation. Then a thought of relief came upon by mother, she said to herself, "Hah, I should have known! That<n>was an easy one. I was really thinking that, I could not figure this equation. However, it made her think<n>about if this equation was correct or not. Then she said to herself, “I’m a pretty smart woman and an MIT<n>graduate so I’m sure it’s right”. So she then ran to her husband and asked him to check if she answered this<n>equation correct or not. He said, “Yeah, sure, no problem! I know that too and if it is not right then it should<n>be a matter of seconds to me to find it out”.<n><n>So the father left and came back with the answer within seconds. He said, "Yes, you answered the<n>equation correct. You just forgot to add one day to it. It is correct. 7-1 should equal 6.”<n><n>When the mother heard that she said, “Umm, I guess that makes sense but that’s weird isn’t it, I don’t<n>remember ever going on vacation during the month of August.” <n><n>She then looked at her wife and said to her, “How could you possibly forget? Do you really think I would<n>go on vacation during the 7/11 sale? Of course those prices make the 7/12 sale look like a fat lady dancing”<n><n>Input: If you have found that you are incapable of deciding on the solution, then your next option would<n>be to do a guess answer.

From there, the answers are compared to see if there is a majority for X or a majority for Y.<n><n>In practice, you should first write out the formulas from the logic puzzle.<n>Once you have the formulas written, you can use them to verify your logic or to create a C++ program.<n>This is the easiest and quickest way to ensure your logic is sound.

Choices:  A: contagious B: wrong C: last forever D: painful E: blind<n>Output:		 Lets first understand what are options A and C. When some thing is contagious it is spread from person to person just it the flue is contagious. So if i get in a room with a bunch of people who know what love is, when i hear someone say they love him or her I will get this contagious feeling. Whereas if i say the word love to a bunch of people it can be wrong. i mean if someone says they love to smoke, everyone who heard that would not feel love. Its wrong. It is the same as a person who says I smoke so much that I must be a drug addict. I cannot eat much because I am fat or slim or I cannot eat or sleep. Now if we look at B and D.  B is wrong because love doesn't last forever. It's just a feeling. It's not something that has been proven by science or a certain period of time. And lastly.  D which I chose is also wrong because Love can lead to pain. You might fall in love, but that does not mean that you are always gonna be in love and that you will be happy and satisfied throughout your life. Even marriage cannot guarantee that because even marriage does not always lead to happiness. As we all know. In fact marriage has been known to lead to a lot of heart ache.<n>

Wednesday = Thursday (and vice versa).<n><n>Thursday = Again Joe and, again Alice walk to school, again. Again Thursday = Alice, again Joe.

That is, Alice walked to school on “Tuesday” and on Wednsday, too. Joe and Alice should have walked together at some point on Thursday because when you walk one day, you should have walked on the next day. I.e., I think Monday = Joe walked to school on Tueday, but Alice didn’t since Alice walked to school on Wednesday, and Wednesday = Joe didn’t walk to school, so Joe walked on Thursday, but Alice walked to school on Thursday as well.<n><n>Input:There are two houses numbered 2 and 4.

Choices:  a: 50 dollars b: 150 dollars c: 300 dollars d: 300 cents e: 60 cents<n>Output:Answer is c, you just have to do simple math. It's 150 dollars if you take into consideration the 7 people in the group with the total number of pies and gnocchi's bought. But I will just make this easier. They spend 50 dollars for the pies. The other 100 dollars are spent on the gnocchi. Each person spent 15 cents and each person will eat 1 gnocchi.  So 15c + (15*7) = 105 cents. That's a lot of math for a simple puzzle.

This method is much cheaper and faster when compared to the traditional printers. However, this process also results in very weak models as it is unable to support the weight of the object,<n><n>Output: Both technques are viable options.<n><n>The first and most common is that the 3D printing process is 3D because it is printing a 3D file, which are 3D digital files.<n>The second is that it is 2D because it is 2D and not 3D, which is what you are printing on with the process.<n>So the final answer should be that it is both of these options because of the first and second reasons given by the user.<n><n>Input: The "Moon Race" is a 1969 event between Japan and the United States, which took place in Tokyo and Tokyo Bay. The event was a race from Tokyo to Tokyo Bay on August 9 during the American Moon Landing celebration on July 20. The event was a success with over 120 teams participating in the event.

Choices: C 1 2 3 4 5 6<n>Output C<n><n>#### Explanation:<n><n>The logic is, we are given 2 statements, one says the total number of voters is 1200 and that out of 6000 total number, 1200 are absentee votes. The second one says 1/6 are thrown out and 3/5 are cast in favour of a. So for us, the total number of votes we get is 120 * 9/10. So our options are 5/6 * 2/5 * 120, but we do it one step at a time. And one will reach that conclusion easily<n>(5/6 * 9/11 is 14 which is too big, 3/5 is 12 but 6/11 of that is 5/5 * 14 (16), 12+16=2

If there are a lot of people attending any given function, the reception will not likely fit in a large room, a restaurant or even a country club. A grand casino is the most likely accommodation as it can certainly hold all of the attendees comfortably and is large enough to not feel too crowded and small for such a large reception. Choice E is incorrect as a reception will only be held in a lobby if the function is being held in a hotel, or possibly a business office. Choices A and B are possible locations for a reception.

There may be other beautiful places in the world, however, a forest house will allow one to appreciate nature in a more intense manner. A lake house will not allow one to get up close and personal with the woods, and therefore, will not receive your vote for the most beautiful place to live. A beach house could be viewed as a second choice to a forest house and can be a viable residence depending on your priorities. A mountain cabin will allow one to see and experience the mountain range, however, again, only from a distance. Choices B, C, and D are all options when deciding on the best-looking location to reside in. Choice E is the least attractive location of residence, as it would be difficult to appreciate the beauty of nature when not surrounded by majestic trees.<n><n>Input: A: I will visit the library today before heading to see a movie.

{"text": "E\n\n### Instruction:Answer the questions using programming. No brute force approaches or trial and errors.\n\nInput: You are given two strings s1 and s2 representing different sequences of integers.  The values of an integer (anything from 0 to 9) represent the digit as it's written (for example, the values 6 and A would be equivalent).  Given  n, the first string s1 has n digits, while the second string s2 has m digits.  The two strings consist of 9 different digits (0 through 8).  The digit represented by each string is chosen based on the corresponding ASCII values.  For example, '0' through '9' are all given ASCII values of 48 to 57, and the digit which is the ASCII value 48 would be represented by the characters in s1 and in s2.  Given n and  m, the task is to design an algorithm which determines two strings with the same number of digits and values such that the value of each digit in the first string is within 1 of the value of the same-indexed digit in the second.  If the strings don't exist, return the empty string.\n\nOutput: s1 = 0879,  s2 = 0856\nInput: s1 = \"9752\",  s2 = \"6294\"\n\\\nOutput: s1=6938,s2=9076\nInput: s2 = \"1267\",  s1 = \"3725\"\n\\\nOutput : s1 = 1261, s2 = 3725\nInput :s1 = \"5790\", s2 = \"6744\"\n\\\nOuput : s1 = 584, s2 = 674\nInput : s1 = \"1146\",  s2 = 3985\n\\\nOutput :  s1 = 1051,  s2 =  4008\n\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following question with programming.

After that I tried to solve it with a different approach and it worked well. \n\nI used the divide and conquer approach to solve each of the problems. The input and output variables were given a variable and a static type, that way I could distinguish between a variable and a static value. \n\n### Solution One \n\nI thought I should brute force it to make sure everything was correct, so I tried with a different function to pass the variables. \n\nAs I started working with bigger data, the function started performing slowly. I knew this had to improve so I decided to break it to pass the variables as an array. \n\n![Output of solution brute force](/Images/bruteforceoutput.jpg) \n\nNow it takes over 30 seconds to run. The solution 2 is simpler to code, and it makes less changes to the array, so it's not that resource consuming. \n\n## Solution 2\n\nI thought it might be better to try a different approach, and I found that this approach also works well! \ud83d\ude09\n\nInstructions:\n\nInput: 18,424\n\nOutput: 112\n\nGiven a value, split into 10 parts.

{"text": "B\n\n## Test\n\n### Instruction:Answer the question that follows each passage.\n\nSay you\u2019re at the store, and you plan to buy some items, but you have a limited budget. You may be tempted to look for ways to discount price.  In one way to do this, you might round down the amounts you spend to the nearest lower dollar. Let\u2019s say your pizza dinner was $1.07. If you rounded it down, you might think the meal was $1.   Or you might have bought a magazine for $2.29 and rounded this down to $2.25. Another way to reduce the amount you\u2019ll spend on items is to split the total into a series of smaller dollar amounts called a cashback plan. So, at the pizza restaurant, you may notice a 15% tip is already included, and you decide to leave 12% instead because you know that\u2019s already there. In the magazine example, the extra 6 cents comes out to a little less than 3 percent, so you might not even notice that money was withdrawn from your pocket.  Both of these methods may seem to save you money, but don't forget to subtract the amount removed from your pocket when using them.\n\n### Question 410723676967694\n\n### Question:A person notices in the grass, popcorn, coton candy.

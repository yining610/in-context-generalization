Choices: 00:00%, 00:50%, 0050%, 10000%\n\n### Response\n050%\n\n## Explanation\nThe students left at 280 out of 345 total. If you take 345/345 to get 1.0, you get 100. If you take 100*.28 or 100/50 to get 0.5, it equals 50%. If you multiply that by.25 to get.125 percent the 280 number left in an equal percent with the remaining, it equals 5%. Since 50% of the talent show is over at that point, that means half of the students stayed for 100% of the talent  show.

How much did each person contribute to the expense?\n\n### Response :After examining the question closely, we find that the five people can be grouped into two pairs.  It appears that there was one gift that cost $130, and each person in a pair gave $26 to cover that cost.  The third pair did not provide gifts. This, combined with what we learned previously, means that each person in one pair gave 1/5 of $130, but each person in the other pair didn't contribute anything.  This means:\n\n$$10\\times\\frac25=130 \\Rightarrow$ each group of two contributed $26\\\\5-4=1\\Rightarrow$ one group of two did not contribute $$10-1=9\\Rightarrow$ the other group of two did not share in the cost.\\end{align*}\n\n### Input:\\$690 was paid by three people for a hotel room.

It is important to notice this when considering the next part of the question.  There are three beds, so the two other people paid $230 to rent one bed each.

If the store sells five packs of gum in an hour, how much profit does the store make?\n\n### Question B:\nThe distance between two towns is 18 miles.

How much longer is it to walk 18 miles than it was to drive 18 miles?\n\n### Answer:A: $0.50B: 6:25\n\n## Solving\nDuring the challenge the task of the task is to get the value, then store it in a variable, and then calculate what the variables equals when they are added. For the first example, we're using variables to store the values. Since both Richard and Hurley's age are being calculated, we'll store the results in two different variables.\n\n```javascript\nvar ageR = 40;\nvar ageH = 20; //Ask a different age for Hurley\nvar total = ageR+ageH;\n```\nWe solved it using this sequence: We set the variables with the ages, then calculate them, then combine them like adding addition. We use the '+' to combine the two variables, adding their values, and we get the result 60. \n\nFor the second example we use the `parseInt(amount)` to get the value from the user and store it in a variable (`var amount`) so we can combine it and calculate it later.\n\n```javascript \nvar amount = parseInt(userInput); // userInput gets the value from user input\n```\nThe challenge uses the `parseInt()` to tell it what type of value to use. `Number` is the value we store with it since we will be doing math with it.\n\nWe use this sequence to solve: we ask for the users input, store the value into a variable, and then use it later to do our math. The value is an integer by default, so we have to use the `parseInt()`", "answer": "D: train station"}

{"text": "D\nThe answer is C \n\n### Input 1: If the number x is divisible by y, explain what that means to me as a person.  When I heard this, I decided that it must mean that I could divide the number by zero and still get a whole number as the answer.  How could this NOT make sense?  Then I saw my friend's confused face as they tried over and over but could NOT do it.\n\n### Response 1: Let's first clarify a misconception: Divisibility does not mean that you can simply divide an amount by any number and get an answer.  The divisibility by y is a binary operation (that is a binary relation) of two binary operations: multiplication and addition.\n\nIt sounds to me like the lesson you heard is a step to teaching this.  The problem in the lesson is that I need to not divide my number x by zero, it is instead zero divisions.\n\nOne way of thinking about this is to realize the number 10 is divisible by 1,2,5, and 10.  If I were to multiply 1 by 10, I would get 10 and if I multiplied 5 by 10 I would also get 10.  But if I multiply 2 by 10 or 0 by 10, neither would be 10 so 10 is divisibe.  The division means that for *any* number y, y times the number x is an integer.\n### Input 2: What's the difference between a rational number and an irrational number?  Does the word irrational scare you?\n\n### Response2:  Let's be clear that both rational and irrational are binary attributes.  Just the way y=m*n is a binary relation is the same way rational and irrational may applied as binary attributes.  The words scare yes and no since some binary attributes are frighting even for adults.\n\n### Input3: If the number is a fraction or it can be written as a fraction...  Then we're a rational number. If the number can NOT be written as a fraction and it's not 0 or 1 then it's an irrational number.\n\n### Rsponse3: Irrational numbers are in", "answer": "B: friend's house"}

Prime numbers tend to occur alone and not in pairs. So in a set of 100 numbers, there's likely one or zero primes. With two numbers it's a little more likely to get a pair of primes together. So the chances of two primes appearing in a row is less than 100% but much less than 1%, probably less than 0.33%.\n        - I think all prime numbers are in the same order like 2 3 5 7 11\n        - The probability of any positive integer being prime is ~49%. That means for any 11 prime numbers, ~43 are not prime\n        - Not sure if it makes sense to calculate the probability of two prime consecutive numbers\n\n</code></pre>", "answer": "D: park"}

Because, the sack weight is 10-kg, and it\u2019s a distance of 25m = 25000 cm. We want to lift the weight 25cm.  The magnitude of the force used to lift something should be about three times the initial weight of the object.

{"text": "Input: E: eat cake\\\nAnswer: a) Definitely fighting inflation is possible when it's planned well. When you're taking action to control inflation, you could suffer from deflation (negative inflation rate). People are more worried about the things they will lose rather than enjoying the things they earn. In short, people try to eat the cake (spend more) rather than make the cake (save more). So the answer has to be cake.\n\nInput: a: problems\nAnswer: The government might not be good at fighting inflation as it fails to keep monetary policies in the country. People will be able to get money so easily that its value (inflation rate) will decrease and people then will pay lower prices for each good/service resulting in negative inflation. This is not what the government wants, because it's expected to increase. Definitely they will try to spend less but more expenditures than their expected can come across in the future, which will be followed by spending habits again, which will be called as problem.\n\nInput: c: not noticeable\nAnswer: When the inflation rate is low, this is not noticeable because people might have the misconception that it is due to lower prices. Actually, it's lower prices that came from a low inflation rate and not because of what people are paying.\n\nInput: b) economic instability\nAnswer: When the government keeps adjusting monetary policies to control inflation, it will surely cause some instability in the market. This will surely cause turbulence to the economic activities and will affect other areas as well.\n\nInput: B: not noticeable\n\nAnswer: It is not noticeable because of low inflation rate. When inflation rate is zero or less than zero (i.e. deflation), people are more benefited due to its low value. As a result prices fall (due to lower inflation rate), which in turn, leads to higher purchasing power. People can buy more and more due to lower inflation.\nAlso when inflation rate falls to zero or less than zero, people find it more convenient to invest as the risk and returns go hand in hand. This causes people to find more job opportunities and they will become more productive and happy. Their purchasing power will go higher when they invest, which will attract", "answer": "D: economic instability"}

{"text": "I think people engage in chats with friends in class for one of two reasons. One of them could be because they are in class and waiting for the other students/teacher to finish asking them questions as they need to ask you a question. They may be nervous and would like to prepare what they are going to say after class is over. Another reason would be they are in class and the other students/teachers ask them a question to which they must answer. For example, in class they would like to know if they are correct or incorrect about what they predicted. One example of a correct prediction would be that you asked what percent of the earth's surface is water and they responded with 70 percent. I would also be correct in the case that the students know something incorrect. The students are probably asking questions of each other for fun and to get to know one another as friends.\n\nI see three advantages to people chatting with their friends in class. The first and foremost is for learning. They might be having fun, but they're also learning, and that is important. The second reason would be that they learn how to socialize.

The numbers we're dividing are still in fractional form, and the result is not.\n\nIt's not possible to divide without a remainder, but we still multiply and get the same result.\n\nIn this case, 7 * 3 = 21, which is already a whole number\n\nAnswer: This is always true. Dividing two numbers by any other number we can produce fractions whose common factor is 1.\n\nDividing 3, 5, and 7 by 3, for example, is equivalent to multiplying 3, 5 and 7 by 1/3: 5 * 3, 5 * 0.5 and 7 * 3 respectively.\n\nMultiplying (or in this case, \"dividing\" as we are finding the common factor in all three) by one is never going to change anything.\n\nLet's test it out: (3 * 1) / 3 = (3 * 1 * 1) / (3 * 1).\n\nEven though the top half of the fraction (the divisor) remains the same, the denominator is now made up of a smaller numerator. \n\nIf we continue to simplify, we get (3 * 1 = 3, no matter how often we divide).\n\nWe have shown that when the denominator is smaller than the divisor, you end up with 1.\n\n### Input \n\nWrite 400 as a sum of different prime numbers\n\nThere are many ways to write 400 as an addition of prime numbers\n\nAnswer: Let us start with", "answer": "B: populated area"}

Choices B and C are incorrect because they are values that are not in the table.\n\n### Examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n\n### The total weight of two ounces of ground beef is $2.29.\n### The total cost of two pounds of ground coffee is $2.00.  \n### Example 2:\n### The total of two pounds of ground pepper is $1.09.\n### Calculate the number of ounces of ground pepper in two pounds of food.\n\n### Answer:\n### Solution:\n### Two ounces is equal to 1/12th of a pound. Therefore, two pounds of pepper would be equivalent to 2 x 1/12 = 1/6th of a pound of pepper. This means that the amount of pepper would be 1/6 x 16 = 2.5 ounces.

If a star is awarded to each review, how many reviews will an average 1 star restaurant need to have in order to receive an average of 3.5 stars?\" \n\n### Response\nWrite \"Average rating: 3, 5\". This gives the solution, without going into a lot of detail about it.\n\n### Explanation:You have to multiply every review up 3 stars, then multiply the 2 to a 3. Then, you would divide all of that by the total number of reviews. A=10 so 10*6=60; 60/10=6. This gives you the final number that the program outputs to represent the average number of stars for 1, 2, or 3 stars.\n\n### Example:\n```\nInput:\nThe restaurant has 10 total reviews.\nThe average rating by the guests is 3.5\n\nOutput:\nAverage rating 3.5\n```\n\n### Input & Response:\n```\nInput \nThe hotel has 8 rooms.

{"text": "**A: Bad feelings**\n\n***The court system takes a toll on participants. The process of going to court is confusing and frustrating and often leaves people feeling emotionally drained.***\n\n### Explanation:\nInstitution of civil action is a complicated process, and it can often lead to feelings of hurt or confusion. Civil action is a process where two parties who have a dispute try to resolve the situation without going to court. If they are unsuccessful, they can then institute civil action. This can be a difficult and time-consuming process, and it can also be expensive. As a result, many people choose not to institute civil action and instead try to solve their dispute on their own.\n\n### Input:[What is the result of a civil action that goes against the defendant?

{"text": "We are asked to find the correct answer from 5 different options. Our options are; A) free time, B) pleasure, C) getting divorced, D) legal fees, and E) being lonely.\n\nFree time does not fit with the question as it does not ask of the cost of getting divorced. Pleasure is also not applicable considering the options and the fact that getting divorced was not the aim of what the couple was doing. Therefore, we can eliminate A and B as incorrect answers.\n\nGetting divorced can apply as it is a costly affair. It means that you have to go to court which is very expensive. Legal fees are applicable as it costs the couple money in trying to solve their problems. We can see that C and D are both correct answers.\n\nThe remaining answer is being lonely. As the answer does not state whether one of the partners is lonely, we know it has to be the both of them. We can therefore eliminate both A and C as incorrect answers.\nBeing lonely does apply as it is a feeling. Both partners will feel lonely as they are no longer married.

If Hurley is younger than Richard by 4 years, what are their combined age 99 from now?\n\n### Solution:\n\nFirst, create an equation that uses the givens in the prompt:\n\n```\n(D-4) = (Hurley-Richard)-99\n```\n\nHere, `D` is the difference in their ages, which is 25. We don't know how old they currently are for this problem, so we can't subtract 99 from the equation.\n\nNext, simplify the equation:\n\n``` \n(D-4)-(H-4) = 2\n```\n\nNow, we can figure out the variables that we know. Hurley is not given, so we have to find it using more information. We know that the total age `T` is equal to the two of their age plus 99:\n\n```\nT = (H-D)+99\n```\nSolving for `H` gives us:\n\n```\nH = T-99+D\n```\nWe plug `D` in for `H`:\n\n```\nHurley = (D-4)-(T-99+D)-99\n``` \n\nAdd `T` to both sides:\n\n```\nD-4 = Hurley = 2H-98\n```\nTheir ages right now are `H-4` and `D-4`. Subtract 98 from each side to get their combined age now:\n\n```\nL = (H-4)-(D-4)-98\n```\n\nDivide each side by -2 to get:\n\n```\n2L+99 = (1)/(-2)-98\n``` \n\nSimplify:\n\n```\n8L = 19", "answer": "C: jar"}

No brute force approaches or trial and errors.<n><n>Input: You are given two strings s1 and s2 representing different sequences of integers.  The values of an integer (anything from 0 to 9) represent the digit as it's written (for example, the values 6 and A would be equivalent).  Given  n, the first string s1 has n digits, while the second string s2 has m digits.  The two strings consist of 9 different digits (0 through 8).  The digit represented by each string is chosen based on the corresponding ASCII values.  For example, '0' through '9' are all given ASCII values of 48 to 57, and the digit which is the ASCII value 48 would be represented by the characters in s1 and in s2.  Given n and  m, the task is to design an algorithm which determines two strings with the same number of digits and values such that the value of each digit in the first string is within 1 of the value of the same-indexed digit in the second.  If the strings don't exist, return the empty string.<n><n>Output: s1 = 0879,  s2 = 0856<n>Input: s1 = "9752",  s2 = "6294"<n>\<n>Output: s1=6938,s2=9076<n>Input: s2 = "1267",  s1 = "3725"<n>\<n>Output : s1 = 1261, s2 = 3725<n>Input :s1 = "5790", s2 = "6744"<n>\<n>Ouput : s1 = 584, s2 = 674<n>Input : s1 = "1146",  s2 = 3985<n>\<n>Output :  s1 = 1051,  s2 =  4008<n><n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following question with programming.

Hurley is only part of the equation, but the answer of 25% is correct.<n><n>It is easy to see that after the purchase of the car, the total bill is 1985 – 985 = 1000, so each friend has to pay $1000.<n><n>Since each friend has $1000 to buy gifts, each gift costs $10. There were 7 friends, so the total bill was $7000.<n>After the chef used 10 eggs to make cakes, he had 50 left. There were 60 eggs to begin with, so the total was 180.<n><n>Samuel only has $720 left. He had $240 to begin with, plus 3/4 of it, which was $168. When he spent $80 on drinks, he had $142.

How far did the third man walk before the second man finished his second mile?<n>Output: -500/352<n><n>#### Explanation:<n><n>1. Hurley is 17 years + 20 years=20 years older than Richard so his age is 37 years. His cousin Richard is 20 years old because he is 17 + 20 = 37 years of age. 20 years after their combined age now, Richard will be twice his original age and Hurley's original age 20 years later, Richard's age 20 years further and Hurley's age now. They are 84 in total.<n><n>2. $17=5(number of candy bar) so each bar cost $3.50 then we multiply these costs to the six friends so each friend will pay $21.50<n><n>3. $210=5(4(cost of the six friends) then the balance will paid by brad so each friend will pay only $153.33<n><n>4. $70=5($14(cost of each gift)) so each gift costs $14.<n><n>5. 10 eggs were in fridge, then 5 eggs are used to make each cake so there are 50 eggs (10+5(4 eggs used in each cake))<n><n>6. $2000 was divided between kelvin and samuel then samuel's share was divided again,so how much does samuels share is doubled then remaining? $132=1/2(.6)(2000+(5/8)(132))<n><n>7. $210(1st day)=5(2nd day)=3(3rd day)=1/2(4th

Choices:  A: soccer game B: fairgrounds C: movie theatre D: countryside E: state park<n>Output:		B<n><n>## Test<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question that follows each passage.<n><n>Say you’re at the store, and you plan to buy some items, but you have a limited budget. You may be tempted to look for ways to discount price.  In one way to do this, you might round down the amounts you spend to the nearest lower dollar. Let’s say your pizza dinner was $1.07. If you rounded it down, you might think the meal was $1.   Or you might have bought a magazine for $2.29 and rounded this down to $2.25. Another way to reduce the amount you’ll spend on items is to split the total into a series of smaller dollar amounts called a cashback plan. So, at the pizza restaurant, you may notice a 15% tip is already included, and you decide to leave 12% instead because you know that’s already there. In the magazine example, the extra 6 cents comes out to a little less than 3 percent, so you might not even notice that money was withdrawn from your pocket.  Both of these methods may seem to save you money, but don't forget to subtract the amount removed from your pocket when using them.<n><n>### Question 410723676967694<n><n>### Question:A person notices in the grass, popcorn, coton candy.

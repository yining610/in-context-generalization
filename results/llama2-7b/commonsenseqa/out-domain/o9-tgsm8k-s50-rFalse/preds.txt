Losing weight can improve health and increase energy. Health factors and lifestyle choices play a part in determining the end result of the weight loss. The impact of the loss and recovery period of weight loss and gain varies and depends on the original body mass index before any weight loss. Health risks can emerge with excess weight loss, such as a high level of nutrients being needed to provide energy and recovery, and there are also skin implications with skin becoming loose and sagging due to stretching. There are often lifestyle changes that will be required, and a regular exercise regime will help maintain lean muscle which will support weight loss, as will a healthy diet full of nutrients.<n><n>### <n>

Since 50% of the talent show is over at that point, that means half of the students stayed for 100% of the talent  show. That's why it's 5%.<n><n><n>### Input :If ½ of a bag of candy has been eaten, there are 4.5 candy corn left and  3.6 chocolate caramel left, how many candy corn are<n>missing?

Choices:  A: stress B: food C: that you D: spending money E: walking<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>### Correct:<n>A would walk into the food market. A should be chosen because A is walking into the market because he/she wants to buy food.<n><n>### Incorrect:<n>E would not walk into the market. In this scenario E does walk into the market to buy food but it is not a reason to chose because food is not something you walk in to buy. E is walking in because they want to spend money. B would not walk into the supermarket. B would probably look for spending money that they could make in the food market. Which means C would walk into the supermarket just because they are buying food. D would possibly walk into the food market because they want to buy things they need. When this is answered D is chosen because they are likely to go into a market and buy food.<n><n><n>### Input<n>A: I used a vending machine because I wanted some change.<n>B: What did you buy? I'd like some of that too.<n>C: 4 candy bars and 6 chips.<n>D: The chips were my favorite.<n><n>### Response<n>D<n><n>### Correct<n>Candy bars is a good choice because this tells us that D will not buy chips in a vending machine because chips are the favorite. D will most likely buy 4 chips in a vended machine instead. This makes it likely that D will choose D and answer B.<n><n>### Correct Answer<n>

He felt that he'd ruin his relationship with Jen if he took it further, and he didn't want to do that.  At the same time,  He fight that pushing farther might do what to something good? Choices:  A: found B: destroy C: construct D: fix E: produce<n><n>### Response:		James didn't want to push Jen further, and risk destroying their relationship.  However, he was also unsure about what it would do otherwise.  Choice A, B, C, and E are all incorrect because they all are incorrect statements about the situation the narrator has painted.  Choice D is the correct answer because it is an accurate statement about the situation the narrative has painted; namely, that pushing Jen further would end up constructing something good.<n><n>### Input:$130 was spent on a birthday present by a group of five people. How much did each person contribute to the expense?<n><n>### Response :After examining the question closely, we find that the five people can be grouped into two pairs.  It appears that there was one gift that cost $130, and each person in a pair gave $26 to cover that cost.  The third pair did not provide gifts. This, combined with what we learned previously, means that each person in one pair gave 1/5 of $130, but each person in the other pair didn't contribute anything.  This means:<n><n>$$10\times\frac25=130 \Rightarrow$ each group of two contributed $26\\5-4=1\Rightarrow$ one group of two did not contribute $$10-1=9\Rightarrow$ the other group of two did not share in the cost.\end{align*}<n><n>### Input:\$690 was paid by three people for a hotel room.  They got different beds and paid different amounts too.  $79 and $99 were each paid for a bed.  And $140 was paid just for the room.  How much did the third person pay?<n><n>### Output: Answer:100<n><n>#### Demonstration:We begin with three people who paid the hotel owner \$690, which means \$690 divided by 3, equals \$230.  It is important to notice this when considering the next part of the question.  There are three beds, so the two other people paid $230 to rent one bed each.  Our problem tells us that $79 was paid for one of those beds, and $99 was paid for the other.  This implies that $79 can be factored out of $2

Choices:  A: charming B: space shuttle C: house D: train station E: surface of earth<n><n>### Response:		<n>C: house<n><n>### Instructions:In this challenge you will analyze the following problem written by another team. Provide answers for all three questions.<n><n>### Question A:<n>If you go into a convenience store and buy a pack of gum costing $0.75.  Buying the gum costs the merchant $0.17.   If the store sells five packs of gum in an hour, how much profit does the store make?<n><n>### Question B:<n>The distance between two towns is 18 miles.  Some people travel in their cars and other go by foot at 3.5 miles per hour. How much longer is it to walk 18 miles than it was to drive 18 miles?<n><n>### Answer:A: $0.50B: 6:25<n><n>## Solving<n>During the challenge the task of the task is to get the value, then store it in a variable, and then calculate what the variables equals when they are added. For the first example, we're using variables to store the values. Since both Richard and Hurley's age are being calculated, we'll store the results in two different variables.<n><n>```javascript<n>var ageR = 40;<n>var ageH = 20; //Ask a different age for Hurley<n>var total = ageR+ageH;<n>```<n>We solved it using this sequence: We set the variables with the ages, then calculate them, then combine them like adding addition. We use the '+' to combine the two variables, adding their values, and we get the result 60. <n><n>For the second example we use the `parseInt(amount)` to get the value from the user and store it in a variable (`var amount`) so we can combine it and calculate it later.<n><n>```javascript <n>var amount = parseInt(userInput); // userInput gets the value from user input<n>```<n>The challenge uses the `parseInt()` to tell it what type of value to use. `Number` is the value we store with it since we will be doing math with it.<n><n>We use this sequence to solve: we ask for the users input, store the value into a variable, and then use it later to do our math. The value is an integer by default, so we have to use the `parseInt()`

Choices:  A: holding B: lift up C: pick up D: lifting E: hold onto<n><n>### Response:		D<n><n>### Explain 1<n><n>Explain: You must explain your reasoning for choosing this response. For example, how do you know the answer is D? This should be as few words as possible (~ 120 characters)<n><n>Comment: Well in your first section, if they had 130kg of meat leftover on their original plan they must have thought they were going to only sell less than 350kg of the stuff, or they overestimated by selling twice the amount as they thought they were going to use. <n><n>After Friday there would've been only 285kg of meat to work with, so that was half, but over there is also 285 remaining for Sunday. So there is only one answer where more meat was sold.<n><n>Comment: @MichaelT Thank you for your explanation. I have added it to the post. When you have finished adding your own explanation, please let the OP know so that they can accept your answer.<n><n>Comment: I'd add that D is correct because with the amount of meat left from Friday, they would've had to sell a little less than that amount of meat on Saturday, which would've meant they could've sold a little more on Sunday, getting 325kg sold. That's just some more info you could give :)

The beach is out, the roof is out, and the school is out.  There aren't any folding chairs at the school.  Folding chairs aren't allowed to be kept in closets.<n>2. The beach is out because if it was being kept at the beach then someone could step on it and damage the chair.<n>3. The school is out because schools don't usually have folding chairs.<n><n>4. So, if we exclude the roof, the beach and the school then we are left with the garage.  We have already ruled out the garage and the beach.  If the school doesn't have a folding chair then the garage does.<n><n>5. So the answer is choice E.

Choices:  A: picnic B: friend's house C: table D: space shuttle E: fairgrounds<n><n>### Response:		D<n>The answer is C <n><n>### Input 1: If the number x is divisible by y, explain what that means to me as a person.  When I heard this, I decided that it must mean that I could divide the number by zero and still get a whole number as the answer.  How could this NOT make sense?  Then I saw my friend's confused face as they tried over and over but could NOT do it.<n><n>### Response 1: Let's first clarify a misconception: Divisibility does not mean that you can simply divide an amount by any number and get an answer.  The divisibility by y is a binary operation (that is a binary relation) of two binary operations: multiplication and addition.<n><n>It sounds to me like the lesson you heard is a step to teaching this.  The problem in the lesson is that I need to not divide my number x by zero, it is instead zero divisions.<n><n>One way of thinking about this is to realize the number 10 is divisible by 1,2,5, and 10.  If I were to multiply 1 by 10, I would get 10 and if I multiplied 5 by 10 I would also get 10.  But if I multiply 2 by 10 or 0 by 10, neither would be 10 so 10 is divisibe.  The division means that for *any* number y, y times the number x is an integer.<n>### Input 2: What's the difference between a rational number and an irrational number?  Does the word irrational scare you?<n><n>### Response2:  Let's be clear that both rational and irrational are binary attributes.  Just the way y=m*n is a binary relation is the same way rational and irrational may applied as binary attributes.  The words scare yes and no since some binary attributes are frighting even for adults.<n><n>### Input3: If the number is a fraction or it can be written as a fraction...  Then we're a rational number. If the number can NOT be written as a fraction and it's not 0 or 1 then it's an irrational number.<n><n>### Rsponse3: Irrational numbers are in

Prime numbers tend to occur alone and not in pairs. So in a set of 100 numbers, there's likely one or zero primes. With two numbers it's a little more likely to get a pair of primes together. So the chances of two primes appearing in a row is less than 100% but much less than 1%, probably less than 0.33%.<n>        - I think all prime numbers are in the same order like 2 3 5 7 11<n>        - The probability of any positive integer being prime is ~49%. That means for any 11 prime numbers, ~43 are not prime<n>        - Not sure if it makes sense to calculate the probability of two prime consecutive numbers<n><n></code></pre><n><n><n>

Write a response that describes what will be needed and/or performed in that activity<n><n>### Instructions:Write a scenario that shows how one problem led to the next and required the addition of multiple elements. Keep in mind that you'll need to write the problem/scenario in enough detail that your classmates could imagine the problem.<n><n>### Example:<n>There are four teams of researchers that work closely with the National Marine Fisheries Service in an effort to identify the best and most cost effective ways to save endangered species in Puget Sound. Each team consists of several different specialties that are needed to successfully complete conservation projects. They include: a biologist, a photographer, a videographer, and a computer expert. The fisheries service gives them a very important task—to compile all their information from the past year into a single report containing the most valuable information possible. All the researchers have already received the task and the deadline is looming larger each day. The fisheries service has sent an email to the team with their final task and deadline for project completion:<n><n>### Final Task:<n>Write a report of at least 5 pages highlighting the best information from your team’s recent research data to produce results. Ensure that your summary of findings has detailed evidence. A summary must cover all major points including: 1. Internal factors affecting the targeted species. 2. External factors impacting the specific targeted species habitat. 3. How the data you collected can be useful to others that deal with similar species in their geographic areas. The data needs to be organized by season. All of us should be able to use the information you gather to make better decisions concerning the targeted species. The report should have pictures, graphs, and statistics on the species targeted. In other words, all the information the fisheries service needs in order to decide if the funding will be extended to our team.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>Our team plans to develop a report to be used to determine if funding to our team is continued. Our goal is to provide the most valuable information possible in the report. In order to gather the information for the report we will need to discuss our findings at the weekly meeting scheduled for Monday. First, I will summarize

We want to lift the weight 25cm.  The magnitude of the force used to lift something should be about three times the initial weight of the object. Since, here we want to move the 10 kg sack, 3 x 10 = 30 so, the force should be equal to 30-the kinetic energy. A sack of 10-kg should require about 2500 j of force to lift.<n><n>C.

It also says that you will need two of the three most commonly used types (math, language, and visual-spatial) of problem-solving skills. Math would be how I would answer your question.  You only have certain numbers in the question(the amount of meat they originally planned to sell x2 x 0.5) and this can be solved with a combination of two of the three you said.<n><n>In math, you can calculate how many pounds of meat were sold beyond their original plans by multiplying the numbers that were given in the question. <n><n>210x2=.42 .42x 0.5=.21 .21 x 325=.66 66 pounds<n><n>### Input<n>```<n><n>### Response<n>The input question reads:<n>The chef has 60 Eggs.  He puts 10 Eggs in the fridge and use the rest to make cake.

Finally,  answer the question by determining how much the remaining cakes cost.<n><n>### Problem solving skills required:<n><n>Mathematics Problem solving<n><n>### Deductive reasoning:<n>The first piece of information was that the chef has 60 of eggs.  Next was that the Chef put 10 Egg in the fridge, then he used the rest of the eggs make cakes.  Finally, he used 5 eggs for each cake he made, that was the deductive reasoning. That is a total of 30 eggs he used to make cakes.  Once in the cake, you put 5 eggs into 10 cakes.  That means that a cake uses 2 eggs.  To make 30 cakes you need 2 eggs so that is 60 eggs he didn’t use to make the cakes.  That is how I found 60-30 = 30 which means

Choices:  A: problems B: not noticeable C: deflation D: economic instability E: eat cake<n><n>### Response:		<n>Input: E: eat cake\<n>Answer: a) Definitely fighting inflation is possible when it's planned well. When you're taking action to control inflation, you could suffer from deflation (negative inflation rate). People are more worried about the things they will lose rather than enjoying the things they earn. In short, people try to eat the cake (spend more) rather than make the cake (save more). So the answer has to be cake.<n><n>Input: a: problems<n>Answer: The government might not be good at fighting inflation as it fails to keep monetary policies in the country. People will be able to get money so easily that its value (inflation rate) will decrease and people then will pay lower prices for each good/service resulting in negative inflation. This is not what the government wants, because it's expected to increase. Definitely they will try to spend less but more expenditures than their expected can come across in the future, which will be followed by spending habits again, which will be called as problem.<n><n>Input: c: not noticeable<n>Answer: When the inflation rate is low, this is not noticeable because people might have the misconception that it is due to lower prices. Actually, it's lower prices that came from a low inflation rate and not because of what people are paying.<n><n>Input: b) economic instability<n>Answer: When the government keeps adjusting monetary policies to control inflation, it will surely cause some instability in the market. This will surely cause turbulence to the economic activities and will affect other areas as well.<n><n>Input: B: not noticeable<n><n>Answer: It is not noticeable because of low inflation rate. When inflation rate is zero or less than zero (i.e. deflation), people are more benefited due to its low value. As a result prices fall (due to lower inflation rate), which in turn, leads to higher purchasing power. People can buy more and more due to lower inflation.<n>Also when inflation rate falls to zero or less than zero, people find it more convenient to invest as the risk and returns go hand in hand. This causes people to find more job opportunities and they will become more productive and happy. Their purchasing power will go higher when they invest, which will attract

Choices:  A: necessity B: answers C: inspiration D: love E: fun<n><n>### Response:		<n>I think people engage in chats with friends in class for one of two reasons. One of them could be because they are in class and waiting for the other students/teacher to finish asking them questions as they need to ask you a question. They may be nervous and would like to prepare what they are going to say after class is over. Another reason would be they are in class and the other students/teachers ask them a question to which they must answer. For example, in class they would like to know if they are correct or incorrect about what they predicted. One example of a correct prediction would be that you asked what percent of the earth's surface is water and they responded with 70 percent. I would also be correct in the case that the students know something incorrect. The students are probably asking questions of each other for fun and to get to know one another as friends.<n><n>I see three advantages to people chatting with their friends in class. The first and foremost is for learning. They might be having fun, but they're also learning, and that is important. The second reason would be that they learn how to socialize. One way of interacting with other people in their social circle is chatting. The third reason is enjoyment. They have fun while in class, and it is enjoyable as they are enjoying being in class as well as other people enjoy interacting with them.<n>

I would recommend checking out some of the many theaters New York has to offer! <n><n>### Input What would happen and what would not happen if you divided three numbers? 5, 7, 3<n><n>Answer: Dividing by three is the same as multiplying by one-third.<n><n>If we try to divide by three, we get 5/3 or 5 divided by three<n>Similarly, if we tried to divide by 7/3, we'd get 7/3 divided by 3 or 7 divided by 3 (the reciprocal)<n><n>Since these are the same, we can cancel out the fractional part. The numbers we're dividing are still in fractional form, and the result is not.<n><n>It's not possible to divide without a remainder, but we still multiply and get the same result.<n><n>In this case, 7 * 3 = 21, which is already a whole number<n><n>Answer: This is always true. Dividing two numbers by any other number we can produce fractions whose common factor is 1.<n><n>Dividing 3, 5, and 7 by 3, for example, is equivalent to multiplying 3, 5 and 7 by 1/3: 5 * 3, 5 * 0.5 and 7 * 3 respectively.<n><n>Multiplying (or in this case, "dividing" as we are finding the common factor in all three) by one is never going to change anything.<n><n>Let's test it out: (3 * 1) / 3 = (3 * 1 * 1) / (3 * 1).<n><n>Even though the top half of the fraction (the divisor) remains the same, the denominator is now made up of a smaller numerator. <n><n>If we continue to simplify, we get (3 * 1 = 3, no matter how often we divide).<n><n>We have shown that when the denominator is smaller than the divisor, you end up with 1.<n><n>### Input <n><n>Write 400 as a sum of different prime numbers<n><n>There are many ways to write 400 as an addition of prime numbers<n><n>Answer: Let us start with

Choices:  A: football stadium B: apartment C: surface of earth D: car show E: house<n><n>### Response:		<n>This is a mathematical problem. Using the formula (2x^2-9x) +36, we can plug in 3x for x and get the solution of 8x^2-34x-45 = 0 so x=-1.5.<n><n>Solution 2: To find the sum use n(n-1)/2 and set n = 9 then simplify and get the answer of 14. Thus the sum of 9 x 8 = 14. Therefore 9-8 = 1.<n><n>### Solution 3:<n>To solve this problem, we can start by noting that each of these statements have a question mark next to them. We can thus remove every question mark next to a statement and start by plugging in the question marks. We can then solve 2-7+16=2. We can thus take 6 from each side and we get 2. The question therefore is 40% of x + 40% of y = 2.<n><n><n>

We subtracted 1 from the Hurley age to get the difference between Richard's age and Hurley's age. Then, we added 20 to both the ages to get the ages 40 years in future for both of them.<n><n><n><n>Next, the problem statement asks us if the difference in ages between Hurley & Richard was x years, and Hurley was y years old, then what is the combined age difference 80 years from now. We can just add 40 to the Hurley age and subtract 40 from the Richard age.<n><n><n><n>Here the problem states that we have to make a combined age of 16 years in the future using the two ages 18 & 8. I calculated the difference using 3rd grade math.<n><n><n><n>In this problem we use a combination of addition & subtraction. We use addition to add 1 to Hurley's age and find 2. We use subtraction to subtract 20 + 1 from Richard's age to find the difference.<n>

Choices:  A: candy store B: butcher shop C: kitchen D: auto repair shop E: post office<n><n>### Response:		I have to say E. I guess you could technically argue over a counter is any place where you can purchase items, but for a place that purchases most if not all items are over the counter, I would lean towards a post office.<n><n>### Input 2:What is the best choice for someone who needs to travel overnight?

Traveling by any means of transportation is never fun, and I feel all these options give us some form of transportation. I don't think B and C give you enough transportation, plus airplanes get expensive and they're a little inconvenient because they stop for 3-12 hours due to weather. I feel the train is a great choice because it takes you farther than other methods, it lets you sleep while you're moving, it doesn’t stop very often, but it's also cheaper. I think the best choice is either the boat or train.<n><n>### Reaction<n><n>### This task was interesting because it was more about math and basic math rather than the syntax or logic of the task. I feel this question was difficult because it didn't necessarily explain everything. I believe what they wanted is 1/8. I feel the first problem was harder than the second one because it is difficult to find out how much the car would cost. I don't know if I would have made the same assumption on the last example of what would be in the refrigerator. <n>

The table below describes the cost of 12 ounces of chocolate syrup.<n><n>### b. Chocolate Syrup Cost<n>### c. Choose one option below.<n><n>### c. The total weight of two pounds of ground beef is ____?<n><n>### Explanation: Ground beef is a mixture of lean meat and fat. In the table, the cost for 12 ouncer is $1.50, while the weight of two pounds is 1.5 pounds. This means the cost for two pounds of meat is $2.25. Choice A is incorrect because it says the cost for 16 ouncers is $1.43. The correct answer is $2.225. Choices B and C are incorrect because they are values that are not in the table.<n><n>### Examples:<n><n>### Example 1:<n><n>### The total weight of two ounces of ground beef is $2.29.<n>### The total cost of two pounds of ground coffee is $2.00.  <n>### Example 2:<n>### The total of two pounds of ground pepper is $1.09.<n>### Calculate the number of ounces of ground pepper in two pounds of food.<n><n>### Answer:<n>### Solution:<n>### Two ounces is equal to 1/12th of a pound. Therefore, two pounds of pepper would be equivalent to 2 x 1/12 = 1/6th of a pound of pepper. This means that the amount of pepper would be 1/6 x 16 = 2.5 ounces.

If a star is awarded to each review, how many reviews will an average 1 star restaurant need to have in order to receive an average of 3.5 stars?" <n><n>### Response<n>Write "Average rating: 3, 5". This gives the solution, without going into a lot of detail about it.<n><n>### Explanation:You have to multiply every review up 3 stars, then multiply the 2 to a 3. Then, you would divide all of that by the total number of reviews. A=10 so 10*6=60; 60/10=6.

But, we can look at the first two cities and know that John couldn't end up in 'desert' because he would have already been in a desert when he left Texas. This limits the options to 'd', 'e', and'me.'. We don't have any information on what John looks like or what his name is, so we don't know what to do next. Is this scenario realistic, and are there any specific assumptions we can make as we analyze this problem? How can we determine the best answer to this problem?

As a result, many people choose not to institute civil action and instead try to solve their dispute on their own.<n><n>### Input:[What is the result of a civil action that goes against the defendant? Choices  A: bad feelings or confusion  B: hurt feelings, confusion or bad feelings  C: going to court or hurt feelings  D: going to court  E: court time]<n><n>### Response:[Going to court]<n><n>### Explantion:<n>A civil action is a type of court proceeding in which someone can sue another person for damages or injuries that they have suffered. Civil actions can be used to resolve disputes between individuals, government agencies, and businesses. In general, civil actions are less formal than criminal proceedings, and they usually result in a settlement rather than in a conviction or sentence.<n><n>

Choices:  A: free time B: pleasure C: get divorced D: legal fees E: being lonely<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>We are asked to find the correct answer from 5 different options. Our options are; A) free time, B) pleasure, C) getting divorced, D) legal fees, and E) being lonely.<n><n>Free time does not fit with the question as it does not ask of the cost of getting divorced. Pleasure is also not applicable considering the options and the fact that getting divorced was not the aim of what the couple was doing. Therefore, we can eliminate A and B as incorrect answers.<n><n>Getting divorced can apply as it is a costly affair. It means that you have to go to court which is very expensive. Legal fees are applicable as it costs the couple money in trying to solve their problems. We can see that C and D are both correct answers.<n><n>The remaining answer is being lonely. As the answer does not state whether one of the partners is lonely, we know it has to be the both of them. We can therefore eliminate both A and C as incorrect answers.<n>Being lonely does apply as it is a feeling. Both partners will feel lonely as they are no longer married. Therefore, D is the right answer.<n>

Choices:  A: leg B: garment C: torso D: body E: road<n><n>### Response:		It is wrong. The arm is the part of the body that is away from the shoulder and not the shoulder itself or just any of the arms in the body. Also, the body can feel pain. The correct answer should be A. <n><n>### Input : My friend said I can only have 5 bites of cake for my birthday party. I don't want to look like I missed my mouth after my 5 bites. The total cake pieces are 12.What is my chance that I will finish the amount of bites I am allowed to take?<n><n>### Response : I feel like the question above should be simplified with only the fraction needed to be shown. If every piece of cake is 1/2 then I will miss my chance in taking 5 bites if each cake is divided by 4 pieces.  The question also seems to be implied that the cake is not perfectly circle so it cannot be divided by 4. In that case, my probability to get all of my bites in would be 2/8 because I get 2 whole pieces to take. In addition, if the cake was perfectly round then the probability should be 1/8 to get all 5 bites.

If Hurley is younger than Richard by 4 years, what are their combined age 99 from now?<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>First, create an equation that uses the givens in the prompt:<n><n>```<n>(D-4) = (Hurley-Richard)-99<n>```<n><n>Here, `D` is the difference in their ages, which is 25. We don't know how old they currently are for this problem, so we can't subtract 99 from the equation.<n><n>Next, simplify the equation:<n><n>``` <n>(D-4)-(H-4) = 2<n>```<n><n>Now, we can figure out the variables that we know. Hurley is not given, so we have to find it using more information. We know that the total age `T` is equal to the two of their age plus 99:<n><n>```<n>T = (H-D)+99<n>```<n>Solving for `H` gives us:<n><n>```<n>H = T-99+D<n>```<n>We plug `D` in for `H`:<n><n>```<n>Hurley = (D-4)-(T-99+D)-99<n>``` <n><n>Add `T` to both sides:<n><n>```<n>D-4 = Hurley = 2H-98<n>```<n>Their ages right now are `H-4` and `D-4`. Subtract 98 from each side to get their combined age now:<n><n>```<n>L = (H-4)-(D-4)-98<n>```<n><n>Divide each side by -2 to get:<n><n>```<n>2L+99 = (1)/(-2)-98<n>``` <n><n>Simplify:<n><n>```<n>8L = 19

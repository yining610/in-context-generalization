Find the number of goals scored by two players in a game if their goals are in the exact ration of p : q where p = 2, q = 3 and the total number of games is 4. Note that 0<p1<p<q and 0<q1<q<p2\n\nOutput: 1\n\n##### Answer: Input: The number of games is 5\n\n##### Explanation: If y>=0, then  x=11\n    x=x+2 =13\n    p=11-13 = -2\n    q=13-13 = 0\n\nIf y>=0, then\n      x=11+2 =13 \n    x=11 = p1\n    x=13 = -p\n\nTherefore, p1=11, q1=0. \n\nIf y<0, then \n      x=10+y =  9\n    x=10 = p2\n    x=9 = -q\n\nTherefore, the answer is x=9, (p1=10, q1=1)\n\n#### Question 2\n\n#### Input: Given a number, find all divisors of that number, that is, find all integers that are equally shared into the input number.

If you enter a number and then an end of line character (in this case it is the backslash \\\" character), everything after the backslash is ignored.\nOutput:Your answer goes here.\n\nYour output is printed directly after the question.\n\n\n### Solution:\nIn the first example, we use to extract and print the digits from the two strings given. That is why I am using regular expressions to print the digits from the last string.\nNext, the question asks us to extract the digits from the string that equals the sum of the two numbers and print them out.\nSo I am extracting the integers that start with the letter 'g' from the first string using the replace function. Then I extract the integers that equals the sum of those integers and finally I print the number that was extracted.\nThe second example asks us to print the characters starting with the last digit to the first digit in the string that is a permutation of the word BENSON.\nI use the function reduce to loop through the characters of each string and reduce them to a string with the first digit and the last digit in a string. After printing that string, we take the two strings and join them together and print that.\nThe third example takes the two strings with the number of days and the number of hours a person works and I multiply the two. That's what the first line inside of calculate is. Next I add 23 to the result of the first line inside of that function since Sundays and holidays cost extra. Finally, I subtract that from the result of the second line inside of the calculate function. Now all we have to do is print that result.\nNext we have an example that asks us to determine the number of ounces of liquid a boy drank.

The question is about how many hours does John go to the gym in the week.  \n  * The value of the question is the how much did his purchases and how much does he spend a week.\n  * Therefore we can see that the values is the result or sum of each operation that the question mentioned.\n* Summarize all data points.\n  * There are three sets of questions above that relate with each other.\n  * Those sets of questions are questions about:\n    * How much is Adam's purchases?\n    * How much does James pay for fuel?\n    * How many hours does John go the gym?\n  * The only one value mentioned in these three questions is the sum of each operation.\n  * It is mentioned in order as 56, 480, 6, as the value of the questions above.  \n\n## How to Solve\n\n* Using Addition or Subtraction\n  * When we have a result that we need to get from the sum, we can use addition and subtraction with the sum operation as the question said above.\n  * Example from question 1 above: \n```\n    The only answer that satisfies the problem is that Adam paid $56 for his purchases.\n    Therefore: 3(12) + 2.5(8) = 56\n```\n  \n* Using Division\n  * When we need to divide the sum by another sum, we can use Subtraction of those with the remainder.\n  * Example form question 2 above: \n```  \n    If each call with Grammy lasts 30 min and he is charged $5 per call minute, the total he is billed is 1 year * 12 months * 480 min/year * 0.05/min = 80$\n```\n\n## Solution \n\n```\n   Question: How much did his purchasers cost?: \n   3(", "answer": "C: city"}

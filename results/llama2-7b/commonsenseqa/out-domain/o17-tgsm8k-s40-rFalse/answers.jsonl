However, since an equilateral triange is not distorted when you change its parts, we can use it to make the problem simpler. An equilateral triangle has a perimeter of 3x. It also has equal sides. This means that it can be divided into three triangles just equally as we should be able to divide the three parts B, C and D to divide the perimeter. To find x, you can subtract AB from BC. We therefore have 2x=AB-BC. Next, AB=3B and BC=3C. Thus, 2x=6(B-C) or x=3(B-C). Since, the perimeter", "answer": "A: home"}

{"text": "A\n\n### Solution:\n\nStep 1: 1: It rained twice the day before, so it rained twice as much.\nStep 2: Every hour after noon, there's an extra 5 feet. In the first hour (0 hrs), there's 0 extra, so there's 5 feet.   In the second hour (1 hr), there's 5 extra, so there' one is 10. In the third hour (2 hr), there's another 5 extra, so the total length of a shadow is 35.\n\nStep 3: 2. The ratio of woodwinds to brass = 4/8\n\nStep 1.  The ratio of woodies to brass is the same so 30/5 = 2(20/5). So there are 90 woodwinds, 10 brass (2x20/5);\n\nStep 3. Add 36 to each side to get 3 and 5 times 4 is 24. Answer is 18.\n\nStep 4.  Subtract the hours between noon and the number of hours at the time\n\n\nStep 5: It rained twice, so it rained for 14 days.  The first week, it rained every mon.  The second week, it rained tues and wed.  The third week, it rained on thurs and fri.  There was 7 rainy days that week.\n\nStep 10: There are 16 animals in the reptile house.\n\nStep 8.

The new amount of bottle in total should be divided by the 2 (choco and non choco) to get the total amount. The final answer should be 60 or 61.\n\nStep 5. The number of candies in each box is 12.

How many times will the orchestra play? \nOutput:\n\n##\n## Solution:\n* The questions has missing variables. Let's assume for simplicity that we need to enter 3500 and 6500 respectively.\n* For the first question, I find out that n is 20. I then know that the sum of n and 35 must equal 65. I therefore solve for 35 as 35 = 20 + n, therefore n = 15.\n* For the second question, I know that the difference between 35 and 55 is 5. I can use this difference to solve for the two unknown values of a and b: 35 = a + 5 and 55 = a + b. I now have two equations relating to two unknown values, and thus can solve: 55 = a = 55 - a = 40. This proves that the only integer which answers b = 15 and a = 40 is 55.\n* For question 3, I substitute the value of s = 330 and the value of t = 35. To solve for u I first subtract 330 from both sides of the equation, then 35 from both sides for the final result: 301 = u. I follow the same process to solve for v, substituting 245, until I arrive at 25 = v. I now follow the reverse logic - subtracting 25 from both sides of the second equation and 35 from both on the third, until I am left with 20 = u. Thus, v must equal 15. Note that this value is divisible by the number of month required, so we can conclude the question asks for the minimum number of months (divisible by 3), and thus the minimum number of toothbrushes distributed in any given month is 15. For the maximum value, we simply note 54 is the only integer divisible by 3 which is greater than 30.\n* For question #4, I know both of Sally's values", "answer": "B: table"}

In the absence of a liquid medium in which nutritive elements can be assimilated, the human cells would die due to the lack of water, minerals etc. This would happen because water is responsible in holding 18 elements such as potassium, calcium and magnesium. However, oxygen (O) is one of the elements necessary for photosynthesis of the cell due to the presence of Chlorophyll (Cl), so the rate of oxygen absorption would slow down due to Cl's inability to hold the oxygen.\n------\n# Question#3 \n--------------\n##  Instruction:Complete each equation.

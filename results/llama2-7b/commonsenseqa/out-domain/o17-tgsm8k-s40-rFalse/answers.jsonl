If every one follows this rule the number of apples available to the society will remain constant. \n\nHow many apples do you have in the beginning if you have to give your 3 apples to someone else every time until that person has to give three apples to someone else?\n\n### Response\n\nSay you have 3 apples in the beginning. You will have to give 3 apples to each of the 3 people in turn and after round one the amount of apples remaining to you will be 1 and each one of those 3 people still has 3 apples. In the next round the same procedure is followed and each person has 4 apples in his hand i.e 4 apples less in the store from the previous round.\n\nNow in the next round with 4 apples to start with, if you have to give 3 to each of those 3 people then in the next round with the same set of people you have to give 9 apples but you get three back each in the end. This continues from then on with each person getting the next set of 9 apples and at the end you will have one apple for yourself out of the original 3 but then you also are getting 3 apples each time you give 9 apples and this will never stop unless the number of people reduces to one and the whole  system will stop, so the question remains unanswered.\n\n\n### Instructions:The below is a math problem.

We needed to make copies of a project report. We would have the original document, run it through the copying machine, which would also make a carbon paper copy of the original. Then, we would copy the carbon paper to make a copy of the copy. The copied copy copy was often fuzzy, and it was pretty expensive to make a copy of a copy of a copy \u2014 it was like making 5 copies before the original.\n\nOne day, one of the engineers figured out that she could reduce the number of copies needed by using a method we called the \u201cdrip method.\u201d The drip method involved taking a long, thin piece of paper, putting both ends into the copier, and running it a few times. If you did it correctly, the right end of the paper was facing the original and the long thin strip of paper was hanging below the top copier tray. The result was a single copy \u2014 instead of 5.\n\nAnother demonstration of \u201cdrip\u201d is to go to a movie", "answer": "D: lake superior"}

The instructions for cleaning the dentist's toothbrushes is given as multiple choice. Read carefully for answers. Read the prompt to make sure that you have everything set up correctly.\n\n### Lessons\n\nA good student looks at the problem and determines what they need to figure out. This will depend on your situation and what you have already figured out on your own during this activity.  The first thing to take about this is the number of toothbrushes given away and the remaining ones.  The remaining toothbrush cleanor question relates to the remaining toothbrushe that Dr. Banks has left.\n\nA good student makes their guess and then compares it with the answer. This will make sure whether they were correct and need to change or keep the answer they guessed for the problem\n\n### Review\n\nThe instructions are to figure out how many more toothbrhuses did Dr. Banks gave away in the busiest month than in the slowest month? The answer is that 8 more toothbrushers were given away in the busy month.  If this was not correct, it would have been", "answer": "B: populated areas"}

In how many hours did it travel?\nA) 8\n\nB) 7\n\nC) 6\n\nD) 5\n\nE) 4\n\n### Demostration A:\nThe raft travels 3 miles/3 feet=1 x 10 = 10 ft downstream first, which takes 8 hours. The next day it travels 4 hrs upstream(6 miles/4 feet= 1x 10 x 5) and again 3 hours downstream(3 miles/3 feet = 10 ft.)=7 total. Thus, the raft travels 17 feet/4 miles=4 hrs downstream in the first 2 days and an additional 7 hrs on the third day and 7+4 = 11 hrs in all.\n\n### Evaluation D is the correct answer. The answer can be narrowed down using the elimination method in which you eliminate all answers other than the correct one. In this question, the response choices are all very different, so the elimination method should be used to deduce the correct one. The elimination method can be illustrated with a Venn diagram.

If the number of Schnurpers are twenty three then there are seventy seven.\n## Answer choice: C\\\n## Explanation: The instruction says the number of Dobernmaan Puppies is 7 times twice the difference between their number and the number of Schnaurers, the dogs are less than five times the difference between both, less than seven times the difference between both plus five, and the instructions say to plug in the answer for the difference and get a value for the number of Dobernmans and we plug in the difference of twenty three and twenty to get a value of five.\n\nIf the number of Dobernmans is five less than twice the difference between number of Schnaurer plus two then we get the equation: \n\n(5 \u2013 5 x 1 plus 5)  = 7 x 2 \u2013 5\n\nAnd plug in the value for the number of Schnausers we get, \n\n(56)\u20137 = 35 \u2013 5\n\nFive more than thirteen is equal to 55.\n\n## Demostration:Input: Dr. Bank had 330 brushes to give away for his patients.

I think that there are multiple ways for which a student could arrive at an answer.\n\n### Step 1:\n\nThis is where I started.\n\n###Step 2:\n\nIf you look closely, there are two answers to each question. So I went over the questions and then determined that they needed to be converted to fractions with a denominator of 10. That way, I could do a conversion of each.\n\n###Result:\n\nMy final result was 2.\n\n# Chapter 040 - Logic\n\n### Rules:\n\nA logic task tests a set of logical reasoning skills and it does not require any programming skills. Each task is a statement like \"If A then B, C and D\". You will then be asked a question asking you to answer this statement or something related to this statement. This question will be based on inference, mathematical logic or on common sense reasoning. The key in solving the question is to recognize that what is wanted is what the writer wants you to be able to do.\n\nThere are 4 types of logics:\n\n* **Inference**. These type of logics requires some common sense. Sometimes, there might be more than one inference to draw. You could answer with either.\n* **Mathematical Logic**. These type of logic requires some elementary mathematical ideas. Sometimes, there might even be variables.\n* **Truth Val", "answer": "B: recording studio"}

Choices: A: 63 B: 99 C: 121 D: 131 E: 151 F: 179\n\n### Response:(A)63\n\n### Explantion:\nWe can say that the sum of all digits from 2 to 23 is the sum of all the prime numbers from 2 to 19 minus 1, so the sum of primal numbers is 2+3+5+7+11+13+17=63.\n\n### Explantion 2:The answer is not F. You don't have to solve for every odd number and every even number. Instead just add up the first twenty three prime numbers together and divide by the sum. Since the sum of prime numbers is always going to be a prime number, we know that the result is going to be divisible by 2. The remainder after division by 2 is going to be prime number as well. Therefore the answer is divisible by 2 and will be an even prime number. Finally by the fact that the divisibility of numbers by 2 is the same as divisibility by 4, the answer will be an odd prime number.(See more details [here](https://www.toppr.com/ask/-maths/how-can-we-find-the-prime-factorization-of-201-/))\n\n### Input :(What is the smallest number divisible by every number from 1-10?Choices:A: 52828 B:62 B: 12 C: 5 D:400\n\n### Response :D. 5\n\n### Explitation :52828 is not divisible by 7 because 7 goes into 5 but not 828, so we should choose the one without 828, which is divisible by 7.

{"text": "Take Care of Proposals\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe best answer to the question is D. I chose option E as well, but then thought about this for a while and eventually ended up answering it this way.\n\n*First, I made a chart with the following:\n\nInput: How many more times does 3^8 go into 128, than it does 124?\nAnswer:\n|Input| Answer:\n|---|---\n1|189\n|1\n2|186\n|2\n3|195 \n\n*Then, I plugged in the inputs for the question, since the inputs were 6 and 10. I started with `math.pow(128,6)` and noticed that the output was about `63`. I plugged in 124 and noticed that the output again was about `60`. So, I plugged in 64 and noticed that the number outputted was about `63.9`. The closest I got was 63, but not exactly. So I started to think, \"How can I get closer to 63 than I currently am?\" I was trying to find a pattern, which I thought might be more complicated than I thought. I ended up trying to look at the numbers between 60 and 64 to figure out which would lead to me getting closer to being correct to the number of times 3^6 goes into 128. I think that, if the output is about `num`, then the input should be about `(64/num)*(.5*64)`. I realized that, by plugging in 89, and using the number on the far right, that the next input was only going to be off by 0.5. It kept adding to be close to 1, but never quite got there, so I was thinking of using a bigger base and number. The next input was 68 and that number kept rounding up. The next number I tried was 66; after that, I realized that the number I was getting on my calculator was slightly different from the value that I was getting on the website. So I plugged in 71 and noticed the value was pretty close to 67, 68 or 69. I eventually decided to go with 67. I plugged in", "answer": "A: apply for job"}

This means it is going up by 9 percent each time, so each year it was greater than last year by 9%.\nIt decreases by 45% each year. So it was down from last years' year, minus how much from last year. Divided by two means half the amount. So it's 9% minus 45%, then take half of that, which is like taking half the distance.\n\n### Response\n### Explanative\n#### Explanative Explanation\nFor this problem I just had to find the answer. I figured that if I just divided by a 5, I would get 9. and 4.5%. Then I added 9% to get about 9.9. So then i just divided by two to get 4.95%. I could've done this to the 45% too but I chose to subtract 45% from 9 and got 4.55% then I multiplied by two. That is why my answer is 4.95% and not.99 or.95%. \n\n```python\nimport itertools\nn = 0\nper = 0\ngrowth = dict(range", "answer": "C: have tools"}

{"text": "B\n\n### Explanation:The phrase \"in its natural habitat\" typically refers to the wild state of a species. Utah is the home of many different species, not just lizards, so it is a good choice for an answer. You also cannot travel to Mexico without speaking a little Spanish, as this will be required to go to the Mexican border, and many stores and attractions, especially in Mexico City. New Mexico and New Hampshire are not near any areas you should visit for lizards, and Japan is not the best place to visit for lizards.\n\n### Input:\"Near\" is usually used to refer to a place that is close geographically. Choose the answer that gives an appropriate description of being close. Choices:    A: north, south B: west, east  C: east, east D: west, west\n\n### Response:\"Near\" means \"not very far away,\" so it should apply to B if A is not meant. If you are in San Francisco and you want to travel to the east, you should drive east because there is no land in between San Francisco and the first destination to the east from your place. If you are at the southern end of California and you want to go to the east (Los Angeles is the closest city to the east of San Francisco), you would also drive east to get to the east.\n\n### Question:Pablo has 50 gummy bears and 15 grape jelly beans. 80% of those he eats are gummy bears and the rest are grape jelly bears.

Each of them had one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns.  Sandra moves her king to a square immediately to the right of the square directly in front of her castle.  This squares in turn leads to a king attack from both sides.  Ben, however, gets a second shot at his king, as if it were still on the square it originally was on (that is, square directly in front of his castle).  Ben now moves his king, which leads to a king attack.  When he moves his king, which square does the king attack?\n### Response:King attack is B\n### Input & response:\nThe two people are both eating the same number of cookies so one of them has 2 more cookies than the other.

A symphony is usually divided into sections, which can be repeated or varied. A symphony usually has four movements, each of which is based on a musical theme. A symphony that consists of more than six movements is called a massive or mega-symphony. A symphony is typically based on recurring musical themes and contrasts. The themes and musical ideas of a symphony can be traced back to other composers. The viola is classified as a member of the string family.\n\n#### Explanations:\nB.

{"text": "D\n### Explanation:\n\n### Answer to Multiple Choice\n\n1. A:  This question asked for the input 3*number + number = 90. So the number that came after the equation to be subtracted was 10. Since Dobermans = 20, there are 30 Schnauzers\n\n2. B:  This question asked what part of the equation was equal to 90: 5*3 = 15 and 3 =90. Therefor 15 is the equation. The variable can be replaced by the given numbers.  Since we use 1/5=2. So 10*2=20\n\n3. C:  This question asked the relationship between number of Doberman/Schnauser. It asks how many more Schnauzers did Dr. Banks gave out in the busiest  month. It is written like this: Dr. Banks gave away 53 and 67 Doberman Puppies in January and February. In March he gives away the remainder (half each month=6 and 21). So Dr. Banks gave 53, 67, 18, and 21 puppies. So there are more puppies in March=21 than in February=18. But the March total number of puppies in 30, so the number is 36.\n\n4. D:  This question asked to find a relationship between x and y.

{"text": "The correct answer is A\nInput: 3 times more of an item means to multiply the quantity by 3. 4 times less of the item means to multiply the fraction by 1/4.

How long will it take both cars to travel 100 miles?\n\n### AnalysisIn the 100 mile journey, the faster car will travel 60 miles (30 miles in half the time), while the slow car travels 40 miles (5 miles in half the time). The total travel time is 100 miles divided by 2 x 60 plus 100 miles divide by 2x5 which is in whole days. We can express this as, 100/(2*60+2*5) which equals about 128/30 which means that the two cars will meet after 4 hours and 20 minutes when traveling 100 miles.\n\n### SolutionsInput: The", "answer": "C: synagogue"}

{"text": "A\n\n### Demostration:Given that:\nThe sentence: You committed perjury.  \nThe sentence: You commit perjury.\n1. The first sentence means \"you committed perjury in the past\"  \nThe second sentence means \"you commit perjury\" all time\n2. For \"committed\" in the past tense it implies that you did this in the past  \nFor \"commit\" in the present tense implies you are doing this right now\n3. The first sentence would lead to \"shame\" as a response.\n4. The second sentence would lead to \"arrest\" or \"embarrassment\" or \"go to jail\" as a response.  \nThe main difference is that for #1 it says you committed the wrong at a certain time so the appropriate result is shame.  In case #2 it is a constant state and the punishment for that is arrest or embarrassment or go to jail.  \nWhile if you have done wrong, then shame is the right choice but if the sentence states that the act is a constant state, then arrest is the right response.\n\n### Input:\"I was going to steal those money from my father, but I felt guilty for that.\"\"You feel guilty, because you know it is wrong.\"Choices:  A: feel guilty B: feel wrong C: feel right D: feel tense\n\n\n### Solution:B\n\n### Demosition:\n1.

When she was a freshman in elementary school, she liked being active, so she played for all the sports during recess. When she was in elementary school, you could do the same as the guy next to you. When she was in middle school, it got a little more competitive. By the time she got to high school, she decided, like most of us, to only do things she wanted to do. A few months ago, in the summer, she was in the best shape of her life.

She goes to the gym three or four times a week. She is training just to be toned. She also said she enjoys feeling the energy of the music while she is jumping up and down for her heart. \"I enjoy the energy and getting exercise all at once, because I also really like the way you feel after you work out!

We do not pick the first option because this option involves the use of \u2018E\u2019 which is incorrect. It is written in question \u201cHow a flea locomotes?\u201d while the options are to respond \u201cHow does a flea\u2026\u201d This does not follow the grammar as the grammar requires only the word \u201clocomotes\u201d to be used as correct verb to the question. Therefore, we dismiss the 1st option which is \u2018E\u2019. Now, we do not pick the second option either because this option contains incorrect spelling of the verb \u201clocomotees.\u201d When the verb is asked, the conjugation form used in this question is plural in which a subject in English can only have singular and plural in form. \u201cLocomotes\u201d or \u201clocomotes\u201d is the conjugation form that we think of when the verb \u2018locomote\u2019 is used. The word \u201clocomote\u201d does not have any \u2018s\u2019 or \u2018es\u2019 to accompany it. It only has the letter \u2018s\u201d with no \u201ces\u201d. This is the correct word when we conjugate the verb \u201clocomotes.\u201d \u2018Locomotees\u2019 and \u2018locomotese\u2019 are incorrect words when the question is the verb.

{"text": "You could find the largest pieces of paper at an artist's studio. Artists make many drawings for sale. But they cannot display all of them as they would not fit well in a suitcase. To display their large drawings, they need a larger surface to support the drawing paper. Such a surface is provided through a studio easel. Usually, easels are designed to support either 3 or 4 drawings. These are likely to be several feet wide and maybe two or three feet tall. While an artist's studio may be very large, it is likely to have multiple easels of varying sizes. So the largest single sheets of paper you can find at an artist's supply store, are likely to be found on easels in a studio of this size.\n\n###Instruction:\nAnswer the following multiple choice questions.

However, for the average person I would estimate that the 5 mile option would take about 1 hour and 30 minutes, while the 1 hour option would take about 30 minutes.\n\n###Response to Question 3: There will need to be people on hand to help with emergencies. However, aside from that there will be lots of other people that won't need direct supervision and that will only require checking on certain times of the day. I would say at least half of the volunteers would need to be checked on during breaks or more frequently.\n\nFor the purposes of this response I am going to pretend that all 1500 people are already at the park and walking around the festival grounds. This means that the majority of them are going to be walking around the park and will already be near where there food concessions, sports activities, music, and any other activities are taking place. Because everyone starts and stops in the same place, I think that the biggest congestion problem that the park is likely to face will happen near the main entrance and where the food concessions are located.\n\n###Instruction to Question 6: Aside from setting up tents, there are lots of different events that need to be set up and tents are not the only thing that needs to be put up.

What\u2019s the best way to save the most amount of money in the least amount of days?\n\n### Expected Response 2: \n\n## Explanation (Response 2):\nTo save the most amount of $ in the least amount of time, you multiply the amount saved on each day by the amount of days it takes. To get the best possible outcome, it's best to put forth the most amount of money on the days of the most drastic amounts of change between the prices. Example: On Tuesday, buy $4 instead of $1 on Monday, and buy $3 instead of $4 on Wednesday.\n\n### Exact Answer: \n\nTo save the most in the least amount of money, multiply $1, 4, and 4 respectively by the number of days it takes to do so. 1 x 1 = 1, 4 x 2 = 8, 4 x 1 = 4. Adding all of that together gives you 13. However, in doing this, the 2 day total of $6 doesn't take into account the savings from Monday.

This may sound like a very redundant statement. You should also consider how we describe the shape of a function. This is actually more important than what the function is called.\n\n### Description\n\n### Question:\nThe function f is defined by f(x)=2^x.\n\nIf the domain of f does not include the number -1, can you prove that this function is only defined on the interval (0,+\u221e)?\n \n### Solution\n\nIf the domain does not include the number (-1), it means that (-1), the number by which we can not be the function of x. This means that (0,+\u221e) is the range of f, but (-1,0,0,+\u221e) by combining two ranges will make them the domain of f. This, in turn, is a violation of the definition of a function.\n \n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn the above section, I took f as the function, and its domain was not (-1,0,+\u221e). If the domain is not composed of all elements of a domain, f is not a valid function. On the other hand, if it is not -1, the domain of f is", "answer": "D: economic instability"}

(A: The sun)\n###Statement 4: Grey sky, no temperature, no grass, no sun. (or vice versa)\n###So you are back to how to determine if statements are linked conditionally?", "answer": "B: unnecessary"}

You receive a letter informing you that you are to reclose a numbered item (the department store is not telling you which items it is). How should you proceed?\nThere are several methods that are recommended for recycling.\n1. Separate metals such as the cans, scrap metals, copper, and aluminum\n2. Separate glass like bottles and jars\n3. Separate paper, which includes newspapers, magazines, and cardboard\n 4. Separate clothing, carpets, and other textiles\n 5. Separate trash\n 6. Separate hazardous materials such as batteries, paints, automobile parts, and pesticides\nThe research says that there are so many advantages to recycling. One the main advantages is that recycling conserves the energy that would have to consume when making a new materials by using recycled materials such as paper, glass, metal, plastics, and food waste (U.S.Department of Energy, 2015). Another advantage is to conserve natural resources. By recycling instead of using natural resources in our products such as trees from paper, bottles from glass, aluminum is made from tin ore, copper is made from copper ore, and other metals like iron are made from iron ore (U.S. Department of Energy, 28 May 2015)\n\nThe research also says that there are few disadvantages. One is that the process of recycling requires to generate pollution and use a lot of water. We use a lot of water to wash and grind our recyclables.\n\nThe most common recycling problems are: contaminated materials, collection and transportation, education and information, and poorly designed curbside recycling (U.S. Deparment of Energy, 19 October 2016).\n\n* Contaminants is when nonrecyclables are mixed and accidentally contamin", "answer": "B: arrest"}

He sees 19 buildings, but doesn't see any statues or bus stops. Therefore, he doesn't pass an any bus stops on the way to a buildling.\n\n### B: He spends four days in the woods, and he sees 8 birds on the first day, 12 more birds on the second day, and 14 birds on his third day. On his fourth day, the man didn't record how many birds were seen, so we'll assume he saw 10 more. In total, he sees 34 birds.\n\n### Explanation: \nExplanation: \nA: There is no way to see both buildings and statues, since they were never mentioned together in the problem. We can infer that we'll never see both types of locations in this problem.\n\n1) We start with the first day, when the man saw 8 birds. At each bird he sees, he's going to have to pass a bus stop.\n\n2) On the second day, 12 birds are added to the total. This doubles the birds seen, so we should also double the number of bus stops passed.\n\n3) The third day, 14 birds are added to the count.

That means $3(x) + 4 = 3(x) + (4x)$, which is the sum of a value of 4 and a variable; $3x$.\n\n$3x+4$ is equivalent to saying \"the sum of the expression $3(x)$ is the sum of $3x$ and $4x$.\n\nNow that we understand the meaning of $3x^2 + 3x + 4$, let's look at how this equation is organized.\n\n$3x^2+ 3x+4$ has the form $a_1 x^2 + a_2 x + a_3$, where $a_1$ is the coefficient of $x^2$, $a_2$ is the coefficient of x and $a_3", "answer": "E: inaccurate"}

Most likely it will be in the jar(s) in the farmers market. If the beekeeper has enough and it is in season you can buy it in the apiary. If he has it in the stick form he may not have too much, and even then it may not suit your needs(I will be a little biased).\n\n### Input\nI put a jar of the strawberry jam on the top shelf of the fridge. The jam had an expiration date of January 5, 2020. It is now May 7, 2025, and the jam is still in there. If I leave the fridge open on high for about an extra five days and I put the old stale strawberry jam directly on toast that had been on the hot plate, will the jam still be safe to eat by the time the five days are up?\n\n\n### Expectation\nThe answer to your question will be no as the jam expired on January 5, 5 years ago.\n\n### Rationale:\nBecause the jam was expired it was spoiled. When spoiled foods are brought back to room temperature they can be harmful to consume and can cause you to get sick. This is because the bacteria in the food multiplies a lot faster when the food is brought to room temperature, and this speedy reproduction can make someone sick if it is consumed. According to the USDA Food Safety, \"The rule is to throw out potentially unsafe foods if they have been left out of a refrigerator for more than two hours (or one hour above 90 degrees Fahrenheit)\". In this situation if the fridge was left opened for an extra five days, and the jar of the jam was 150 degrees Fahrenheit (as the warmest temperature of temperature), the Jam would be spoiled after the five days.\n\n\n### Input 12:\nI was wondering, can a bee keep honey that is inside an apiary (the place where you keep or breed bees)?\n  \n### Response:\nYes, bee can honey inside an apiary\n\n###", "answer": "E: farmer's market"}

This is one of the reasons why Target sells groceries along with toys; it would increase its overall revenue.\n\n#### Answer choice B.\nJohn would not be able to plug in his RV in the basement because there are no outlets for it to plug in.\n\n#### Answer Choice C.\nFor this question to make sense, John's RV should be for sale because it is clearly big and expensive. John could sell it at a toy store for the same price to increase sales.\n\n#### AnswerChoice D.\nIt does not make sense that John's RV needs electrical power from the rest area. The RV should be located somewhere without electricity and in a place with a lot of empty spaces with no buildings around.\n\n#### Answerchoice E.\nIt makes sense that John's electricity comes from his RV.

John has a sweater and a hat, and Jan has gloves, a flashlight, and warm socks. In order for them to go to a store and buy things, they need to go to a store where they can get what they need.

The answer E, as it refers to transporting jewelry for a lady to a special place for securing a special place for it (a boudoir, for those who are not familiar with the term), implies that jewelry should be placed somewhere in a location that is safe. A lady\u2019s boudoir, by this definition, would not be a safe place to transport jewelery.\n\n### Example:\nFor each of these questions, circle the answer that best explains the passage.\n\nWhich of the choices below best serves as an explanation for this passage?

{"text": "After new coke was disncontinued what formula would you be most likely to see? Choices: \nA: original B: old  C: coke clear  D: former E: familar\n\n### Input.\nInput: For every point above 580\u00b0 C water boils immediately. Below 580\u00b0C water boils at a rate of 1 pint in \nevery 40 seconds. How long would it take for 20 pints of water to boil at 570\u00b0C? Choice: A: 40 seconds B:1.25 seconds C: less than 40 seconds D:9 seconds\n\n### Rationales\nBecause the rate of water boiling is inversely related to the temperature, 1 pint in 40 seconds at 580 would equal 1 pint for every 40 seconds at temperatures below 580. If we consider the rate of water boiled vs the temperature, we can solve for how long it would take for 20\npints, which is 50 gallons, at 570 degrees.\n\nLet's think about this in terms of 1 pint. If at 580 it would take 1 pint in 50 seconds, then at 570 it would take 20x 1/50 = 10 pints in 200 seconds, and then at 590 it would take 40x1/50 =20 pints, making 20 pints at 570 in 50/50 = 50 seconds.\n\nWe can re-write the equation to solve as T(570) = 50/5,000,000 = (20,000,400/50) = 20,004,000.\n\n### Input\nInput: There are three main parts in one of my favourite machines.

{"text": "The correct response and answer is: \u201cC unpredictable\u201d\n\n### \n\n### Input:(Demonstration): This robot is an advanced version of the original AKAIA.  It has only two wheels and no hands.  The AKAIA can travel across a variety of surfaces, and the wheels are made to rotate on sand, ice, and tile.  This AKAIA is made using A4 paper and can\u2019t crumple or bend in any other direction.  The AKIA is 80mm long and 160mm wide and 300mm tall. \n\nThe robot has 10 legs on each side with a central axle that acts as its backbone.  The axle moves side to side and can be steered by a remote control. With each rotation of the axle, the AKIA also rotates 15 degrees forward or backward, which can allow it to go around corners.  On top of the axle are 6 red and 6 blue arms that can be used for balance.  The red arms are shorter and stronger, so they\u2019re typically used more often than the blue arms.  On its face is a set of eyes that each contain 3 LEDs.  They\u2019re used to view the surface that the robot is moving across and keep it balanced. \n\nIf an object is approaching the AKIA fast enough, which is defined by the parameter c, the AKAIA will move straight at it and knock it aside.  The AKAI uses this strategy for obstacles at speeds of up to 6 km/hr.  At higher speeds, however, the robot will veer away from the object because it\u2019s at an increased risk of crashing.  The AKI uses the same technique for obstacles at very low speeds, as well.  However, since it can\u2019t detect the speed of a moving object very accurately unless it approaches it, it won\u2019t deviate from its path until it\u2019s very near the obstacle. \n\nThe AKIA\u2019s main mode of locomotion is walking, but when it goes around corners, it has two other ways to travel: It can either lean back or forward with its arms, or it can stand upright and slide along the sides of the robot.

{"text": "I assume that the question is asking what I would do if I were hungry, which is why I chose grilling. In some places, fishermen can keep some of the fish that they catch. As the population increases, more and more people would like to eat fish, so people start selling the fish. Fishing has been a big part of the coastal culture for some time. Even if you choose not to eat the fish, people still consider selling it. There is also a significant amount of fish available in these areas. However, not everything is easy to catch.\n\nI believe that it is better for you to use the fish rather than just throw it away. By doing so, you can save more time. Fishing isn't always available in these places. However, I feel that it would be better if you had a place in which to store your fish after catching it. There is no telling how long you will be fishing, so you should make sure you have enough space for your fish. This is because, after all, you will want some of the fish, so it's best to have some.\n\n### Answer: (C) Bring Home Fish.", "answer": "C: bring home fish"}

So 3 ounce is free ($0.16 * 3 ounce = $0.48))\n```\nFor each additional burger, you get a $2 discount, but for every additional ounce of Ketchup you get a $0.3 discount.\n\nFor this question, we first have to calculate the charges for every Ketchup in ounces. Then apply the discount.\n\nIf the customer spent $1 more on Ketchup, it means they will buy 7 ounces which is equal to $1. So the customer receives 3 ounces of Ketchup for free. Now, the customer spent $2.75 (2 Large burgers, $2 each =$4). Next, the customer received $2 discount on each burger (10 small burgers * $2 discount per burger =$20). \n\nSo the total of the cost is $1($ for 1.23 ounces of ketchup) +$4( for 2 large burgers) + $20 (discount for burger) =$2", "answer": "D: evaluating"}

Include a code cell that sets the height of any given screen. \n2. Include one of the two following options on at least one of the cards: Poker 0 for a player's card, and card 0 for an opponent's card. These characters MUST be in place before you save and submit your answer. \n3. Include an \"output\" function cell that displays the \"type of game\" in the format \"game name: 0-9\" for both cards.\n\n### Explanation\n\nWe are given information about 4 decks of cards laid out in front of two opponents at a table. Each player is dealt a set of cards that correspond to each deck. The rule, however, is to not show the decks until the game's \"type\", meaning the game's name, is figured out.  There are a set of 9 categories, such as Poker and Blackjack, that can describe the type of game.\n\nHow to solve this problem: The problem mentions two distinct possibilities. The first possibility is one where the card's name is in alphabetical order (e.g. Ace of Clubs, 2 of any club, 5 of Clubs, King of Clubs). The second possiblity is one where the card is in inverse order, beginning with 10 and ending with A (e.g. the Joker, King of Diamonds, 6 of Hearts, 4 of Spades).\n\nIn addition, the problem gives information on every card individually. Specifically, each card has a number between 0 and 9, which represents it's category. If a player's card is numbered 0, then it is an opponent's. \n\nThis is where things get a little more complicated. The problem only specifies 4 decks, each", "answer": "D: poker game"}

In other words, they failed to represent a whole number using the correct number of zeros.\nExplanation: An accounting company that handles large numbers is trying to identify numbers related to an expense report. We\u2019re not told if any numbers are negative, so we\u2019ll leave that for the instructor. The numbers listed are in the form of the decimal number, so we need to convert those numerals into whole numbers by getting rid of the decimal portion of the numbers. To do that, we take each number and convert the decimal number into a recurring digit (1s) that fills up the placeholders based on the number of decimal places (2 digits in the number and 2 total decimal placeholders). The number 22 is made by adding in 2 (to go with the decimal placement) + 2. The number 35 is made by adding in the 5 (to go with the 1 decimal placement) + the 5 already present (2 + 3). The number 58 is made by adding in a 5 + 8. The number 67 is made by adding in an 8 + 7. The number 8 is made by adding 0 + 8. The final number we\u2019re given is 5. The list of whole numbers should have been 1 | 2 | 3 | 4| 5.\n\n### Input\nThe company assigned you their project to find out why there\u2019s a difference between what has been shown in their data and an estimate made by their marketing department.\n\n### Data & Analysis:\n1.

{"text": "### Inputs: A group is visiting a cactus museum at the outskirts of town. After they wander around for a while, the group\u2019s leader suggests that they look at what the cacti were doing during the year 2000.  He tells them that they can click on each cactus and read all about where it currently lives and what it has been doing for the last 20 years! But, the group leader warns them that if they click on any of the cacti, the cacti will stop sharing their lives with the visitors. The visitors are free to pick as many cacti to click on as they wish, but they can choose only a total of 5 cacti before they will have to come back to the museum after at least 1 week. Visitors are not allowed to click on any cacti before the museum opens for the day. When they leave the museum to click on as many cacti as they want, they are allowed to bring in as much water and food as they can carry. Afterward, they must take one more break for lunch and return to the museum at the same time to see the results of their actions.\n\nRationales: I think the first way to determine the total amount of money the visitors could spend on food and water is to determine how many cacti they can visit in the first place. In other words,  how many cacti do they click on before they have to come back to see the results of how their actions affected the cacti? To do this, we need to divide 5 (the total amount of cacti they can click on before they have come back to see the effects of their actions) by the amount they can click on in one day. In other words, in order to choose 5 cacti, they must go out and click on as many cactic as necessary to earn back their 5 cacti.\n\nIn order to figure out how many days to visit the cacti, we must consider the time necessary to travel to the outskirts where the cacti lives and the time it takes for them to see before they have come back. In other words, we must determine how many days it takes for their adventure in the cactus museum to complete before visiting the cacti they chose.\n\nTo figure", "answer": "A: television"}

Therefore, a response that begins I am happy to receive the _____ additional would not meet the rubric requirements. \nThe response that meets the requirements must also contain content about whether the niece is happy about getting 11 new books for a birthday present. That content may include reasons for being happy or feelings about the niece's birthday, but not reasons for being unhappy. The response also must include some consideration given to all possible explanations. \nA response that begins Is the phrase the phrase \"I am happy to receive\" in the original question a complete sentence? is not expected and not acceptable to meet the requirements. \n\n### Input:{13}\n\n### Response:\"Raise the wedge by 13 to remove the triangles from the rectangle. {12}\n### Your response should not contain any of the text enclosed by {}.\n### The response must explain why raising the wedge to 13 is necessary.\n\n### Solution  I am raising the wedge 13 so the three triangles 3 that were sitting on top of it are eliminated.  My new answer is now rectangle and the rectangle is more than 12.\n### Input:\"Suzie was walking around the square outside her house.

If the customer in the store buys 5 items that are each 10% of the total of the 449 items, how many coupons will the customer receive?\nRational: The problem states the customer buys 5 items, and each item is 10% of 449 items. We are given the discount value \n(i.e. what each item is worth). We need to divide how many of each item will the customer receive to get the total number of discounted items. We'll call the items \"items\" and \"m\" the number of items, and then the total number of items is m*449. \n\nWe'll first calculate the value each item is worth, so we take a simple example of 5 of the items: \n\n$5*10%/100=$0.5 (in dollars or cents if needed)\n\nThe next step is to find how many coupons the customer will get: \n\n$0.5*m*449 =?\n\nSolving for m:\n\nm = $449,5*0.5 = 27.5\n\nThe customer will get total of 27 discounted items (5 bought items x 449 coupons).\nAns: 27\n\nYou may like to start off by doing the \"easy part\" first, and then go back and \"fill in\" the other details. E.g. you might start off by writing \"(5 items)\" then go back and calculate the value of each item (e.g. 0.50).\n\n```\n---\n* [A task description](../docs/task", "answer": "B: wave goodbye"}

You patrol a neighborhood every eight hours.\n\n### Rationales\nWe are told that the police officer patrols the neighborhood every eight hours. They then state there is \"at least one police officer working the beat during any given 24-hour period.\" At the same time, they state that \"if five or more police officers are assigned to the same shift, a police officer is working the beat every two hours.\" From this information, we can conclude that each person working the beat is stationed in the neighborhood for two hours. The neighborhood should thus be patrolled every four hours, or eight times for a 24-hour day.\n\n\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74689872/152622732-d4707443-79ab-46b0-90f9-4052ff2edd6f.png)\n\n![image](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Lx0zQ4yCYRs/UXjRM68W9vI/AAAAAAAABv4/qNl5LbXJK0E/s1600/solid+and+striped+shirts+%2B++fashion+styles%2B%2B+color+and+white+shirts+fashion.jpg)\n\n![https://i.imgur.com/0zUUUV9.png](https://i.imgurcom/0zUuuv9.png)", "answer": "A: early morning"}

Sentence structure is important\nbecause it allows us to think better and communicate more effectively. The first thing to do when\nreading a sentence is to identify the subject. In the sentence below, \u201cThe boy\u201d is the subject. All the other\nwords in the sentence, called the predicate, modify the subject in some way.\n\nThe next thing to do when reading a sentence is to identify\nthe verb, or the action going on. Read the sentence below:\n\u201cThe man was walking the dog.\u201d In this sentence, the action is\n\u201cwalking,\u201d and we can label the subject the man. Sentences are\nusually simple\u2014they have a subject and a predicate. With a little\npractice, you\u2019ll be able to identify them in no time.\n\n### Exercise 1: Identify sentences\n\nIn the following sentences, identify the predicate and the subject.\n\n**Exercise 1a:**\n> \u201cHappy birthday to you, Happy birthday to you,  Happy birthday dear___________,\n> Happy birthday to you!\u201d\\\n> \n> \u201cThe boy threw _______ in the air.\u201d\n\n> \u201cWe love to ________ each day.\u201d\n\n> \u201cThe boys ________ and cried.\u201d\n\n> \u201cJohn bought me a birthday cake.\u201d\n\n**Exercice 1b:**\n> \u201cWe were ________ with the cake.\u201d\n\n> \u201cShe likes to ________ with glitter.\u201d\n\n> \u201cIt was really ________.\u201d", "answer": "D: conjunction"}

A funeral would be held where the deceased was buried, as it is part of a funeral. However, that would not include places outside the cemetery but inside the cemetery, as the funeral takes place where the body was buried.\n\n### D: Outside the home\n\nThere are also places outside the home which funerals can take", "answer": "A: medicine cabinet"}

It should be one and be indented properly.\n\nYou've included the word \"Applying\" but no spaces, so it looks like you're describing the \"Newspapers\" step. You are describing the \"Cans\" step, so \"Apply\" will suffice.\n\nComment: Thank you so much! \ud83d\ude0a", "answer": "A: accomplish"}

{"text": "Input: Why might someone want to be drinking beer\nRationales:  There are many reasons why someone might want to be buying/or drinking beer; the answer to this question depends on one's perspective.\n\nIf someone wanted to drink beer to get arrested, it means that they might be in a troubled situation and are feeling insecure and powerless. The thought of them drinking beer might be a way for them  to express their feelings.\n\nIf someone wants to buy/or drink beer because of problems, it could mean that they are dealing with something that is stressing them, and they need a distraction or solution to something in their life.\n\nIf someone's priority is to be sober, it means that they are probably dealing with some negative experience in their life, such as a death or divorce.\n\nIf someone is drinking beer for intoxication, it might mean that the person is dealing with social anxiety or feelings of loneliness.\n\nIf someone drinks beer due to pleasure, it is a sign that the person is satisfied with their life and enjoys relaxing, having fun, and being social around other people.\n\n### Input :Who has less baggage in airplanes?

The bakery makes two kinds of bread: 1) loafs of bread for sale, and 2) holiday bread for handing out for free samples.

(Do not change the choices)\n\n### Input:$100\n\n### Demostration: If two people are walking on the pier on Lake Michigan and spend $50 each on lunch and $25 each on ice cream, how much money do they have left?\nRationales; The problem states that two people are walking on Lake Michigan. We are given the amount of money these two people have before they spend anything: $100.\n\nTo figure out how much money they have left to spend for lunch, we need to subtract the amount of money they spent on ice cream: 46/50= 5/7 of the ice cream cost.  To figure out how much money these two people have left to spend on lunch, we need the opposite of 5/7 of $25 each: $25 x 5/7 = 6.21.\n\nTo figure the money they have after they spend on ice cream, we add 6.21 with the amount of $100 they had before: $100 + 6.21 = $106.21. \n\n### Output:$106.20\n### Problem:$208\n### Input:$209\n\n### Problem:How much money do you have left if you give a man $208 and he gives you $44?\n\n### Demosration:\n\n### Input:%55\n\n### Democracy:\n1.The man has $%.\n2.

Therefore, it is impossible for anyone to see people doing jumping jags at a base because people only have access to inside of the bases.\nOpera is a musical performance in which songs are performed. Just like musical performances, operas are usually held inside closed buildings. Therefore, it is difficult to see someone else do jumping jacks at an opera.\nA bus stop is a location designated for people who want to wait for buses. Therefore, it is unlikely that people do jumping jags at bus stops because they are usually short trips.\nA church is a place of worship. Although people often pray at church, they do not do jumping jacks while they pray.\nIn conclusion, the only place that has public access is a water fountain.

In addition, the ____ ____ is a person who cannot be placed in teams for one reason or another.\n\n### Response :The group wants to decide which profession or skill each member has. Rationales: The group needs to be told in which order each person should be added to each team, rather than how they should be added. A math historian is not going to have any abilities for either a math or history team; therefore, they cannot be placed on either team. For the first team, the math teacher can be added first (and would be the only person on the math team), followed by the scientist, designer, programmer, musician, and accountant in that order.\n\nThe historian can then be placed on the next team, followed by the writer, teacher, artist, and poet in that order.

{"text": "*B*\n\n### Your feedback:\n\n*B\n\n### Questions:\n\n* What are the instructions?\n\n### What is the correct response to this question?\n\nInput: What is the volume of a cylinder whose perimeter is 120 m and whose height is 60 m? If it is rounded, is it closer to.5m, 5m, 10m, or 100m?\nOutput: The volume of a cylinder (with circular base) is \u03c0r\u00b2h\nExample: A cylinder with a circular cross-section whose height h and external radius R has volume V. The volume is given by V\n\n\nRationale: We can do in two ways:\n\n1. Use area formula, to cover the entire surface of a cylinder with base (diameter)*height (h) we require the area, using the formula:\n\n<img src=\"./images/example4-1.png\"  />\n\nUsing this formula we are able to calculate the area, but if we look at the area that is filled by the cylinder,\nwe need to use <b>\u03c0</b> - ratio for area and not for volume.\n\n<img src=\"/images/pi.png\" width=50 >\n\nTherefore, to calculate the volume, instead of using area formula, we should use <b>\u03c0 r</b> formula to calculate the volume, where <b>r</b> is the radius and <b>h</b> is the height of the cylinder. So for our example:\n\n<img alt=\"img1\" width=\"100%\" src=\"/images/example4.png\" />\n\nV = \u03c0r\u00b2h = ( 3.14160 x 6 x 3.14) = 93.57 m^3\n\n2. We can also calculate the volume by rotating a triangle by an angle 2\u03c0r, because the triangle is the cross-section of our cylinder. See the image below on how we can rotate the triangle:\n\n### Question:\n\n* How to calculate the Volume of the Sphere? Input:  The diameter of a very old ball is 10 cm.

Convert the ounces to pounds or kilograms by multiplying the number by 16. Subtract 1 to account for the 14 ouns used. If divide the pounds/kilogram to ounces and then multiply whatever you get by $.50. $0.50(14.001= $7.00. Add the two and the answer is $0.25+$7.00= $7.25\n\nQuestion:18 cans and then divide that by 16, in ounces x multiply by.25 then by $7.00 because the question asked you to write in.25 when dividing 18 by 12 then.50 because the question asked how much you earned and then add them = $7.25 \n\n### Demor: Below is an instruction that describe a task.

But first, a class only supports static methods: methods which are associated to the class as a whole, not to any instances of it.\n\nAnswer: CORRECT: an object of type User\n\nAnswer: The User class has more than one method so it\u2019s not an abstract class. If it was an abstract class, the other methods would have to be in inheritance classes.

The method inside the class contains the keyword'static', and this keyword will only be allowed if the class is declared as an abstract class.

{"text": "### Instructions:\nIn the multiple choice task above, what does it mean to \"apply appropriate mental strategies?\" Why is this important while solving problems?\n\nThe multiple choice task provides a scenario that involves fixing something with a chain ring. This situation requires a problem solving strategy to be applied to arrive at the correct answer. The strategy to be applied in this context is the analysis or decomposition method. Decomposition is a strategy that decomposes a problem into two sub-problem and solve them individually and then combines the solutions to formulate a solution to the original problem. In this task, a chain ring needs to be applied to a certain fixture or item. In other words, the part to be fixed is the fixture or item itself. The problem is to decide what type of fixture or item does the ring need to be fixed on so as to determine the item or fixture to be used in replacing the chain ring.\n\n### Inputs/Output\n\n1. Which of these two statements could be applied to the following situation: \"The boy wanted to learn about science. There was a science club in the boys' school. If the boy was not a member of the science club, then he could not learn anything about science there.\"?\n\na. If he is not a member of the club, then he cannot learn about science.\n\nb. If he wants to learn about science, he needs to join the science club.\n\nc. If the boy is a member of the club then he can join to learn about science.\n2.

Either A or B will be true.\n\nA and B must be true for A and B to be true. For example, if the boy is not a member of science club, he cannot learn about science either. Both A and B are true for the original statement. Similarly, if the boy is a member but wants to learn science, then he can only learn about science in the science club if he was a member of the science class. The only solution from this situation is for the boy to join the scienve club to learn about science. Hence, option B is the correct answer.", "answer": "E: motorcycle"}

{"text": "To solve the problem above, we need to know whether people are more likely to be vegetarian or eat a higher number of hamburgers. Considering two different choices at a time, each one (choices A, B, C, D, or E) would either increase the number of vegetarians or increase the number of hamburgurgeons. There will be one choice that increases both hamburgurs and vegetarians. Because of this, we can start by considering two choices at a time to find out which choice applies to both vegetarians and hamburgers and then add a choice between the two found choices.\n\nThe choices we will consider are the ones that increase hamburgers and vegetarians by the same amount. Considering choice A, we can multiply and divide the number of vegetariams chosen by the number of hambudgers chosen: \\([3+4+2-4] \\times [14-5] = \\frac{10}{5}=2\\). This means that if the number of people are vegetarians in a specific subgroup, there are 2 more vegeratarians in a particular subset of people who eat a hambger as well. The same would go for choice B. Because the number of vegetariars chosen is 8, there are [0-1] = -1 more people to choose a hamburger than there were before the subsample of vegatarians had been selected. Because the number of people who eat a burger is -1, the number of vegetariants chosen would have to be increased by 1, meaning that there would be 3 more people who are vegetarians, bringing the total to 11 if all vegetarians who chose hamburger. Likewise, if the number of people chosing hamburgers is 4, there would be 2 more vegetarians as before (if no hamburgers were selected then the number of vegetations was 2, now the number would be 3). Therefore, choice B would also work out as if all vegetarians choose hamburgers, the number of vegetarianans would increase by 2 more if they choose hamburgers.\n\nFor B and C to be true, there must be enough people who eat hamburgers to make the number of vegetariasn increase by 2, as in A, but not", "answer": "E: eat plants"}

If your response is incorrect or not entirely correct, redo the demonstration for the number of cans and the number of newspapers and adjust your response, being sure to complete all required steps in the demonstration.\n\n### Input\uff1a\nFor every 12 can you recycle You receive and for every 5 kg of newspapers you receive The total weight of cans and the total weight of newspapers is What city in the middle east known for a temple? There are many cities in the middle east that are well-known for their temples. The one that matches the description in the question is Jerusalem, which is in Israel.\n\n### Rationale:\nThe question tells us that We are given the number of cans The We do not have any information about the number of Cans and How Much Money We could earn from cans To find out how much money We could earn from a can, you need to divide the total weight of cans by the weight needed for $0.50\n: 12/12 = 0.50. Then multiply the sets by the value of each: $0.5 per can.\n\nThe question now asks us how much money we would earn from a newspaper. To find out how much Money We could ear In the question We get the total weight of newspap ers To find out how much we would earn per kg of news print, we divide the total by the weight needed for 5.00: 20 /5 = 4. Therefore, the newspaper costs 4.00 $\n\nWe now know that for every 12 can, we receive $0.5 and for every 5 kgs of newspapers, we receive $4.00. Let's complete the demonstration for the example that We are given. Recycling 12 cans and 2 kg of newspapers will net us $5.00 from cans and $8.00 from the newspapers. We can now state that our Family received $13.00 in total.\n\n### Output:Family received 13.00 USD in total\n\n### Rational:The question asks for the number of can. The", "answer": "A: jerusalem"}

Please answer each question based on what you understand from the article. If you have difficulty answering a question, click on the \u201cHint\u201d button to see a hint.\n\n### Article 1:Birds aren\u2019t dumb like other animals. They\u2019ve known how to make tools for a long time, and even the most common birds can out-perform their cousins.\n\n> *******************************************************************************\n\nFor example, crows have been using tools for at least 10,000 years. In 2000, a researcher in Japan witnessed a crow removing a large stone with a point and using it to reach for food on a shelf. The crow had to put 17 objects onto the stone to remove it from the ground, but he used the point to reach those objects.\n\n> And crows aren\u2019t the only animals that can use tools. Chimps and elephants both create tools as well, and other mammals like orangutans and octopuses have been found to have similar strategies in certain situations.\n\n> But birds have taken their tool use one step farther, learning to create and use tools in ways that are different from the way other animals use them. And humans don\u2019t come out on top in all these situations, with these bird brains being able to outsmart humans on several occasions. For instance, researchers at UCLA observed bamboo-coveying birds learning to work together to retrieve food from a trap, using the bamboo stick as a tool. These bamboo birds\u2019 intelligence may have been one reason why scientists from NASA chose them for a study on the best way to deliver food for astronauts.\n\n> And despite these findings, researchers aren\u2019t quite sure how many of these bird brains can out-perform a human \u2014 or even other birds.\n\n> And while many of these bird brained discoveries may seem like they couldn\u2019t happen to a friend, scientists aren\u2019t exactly sure why \u2014 or even if \u2014 some bird brains are smarter than others.\n\n> But it\u2019s clear that some birds have much more sm", "answer": "E: anger"}

{"text": "Rationales: This is a missing words multiple choice question with four choices.\n\nEach question should be a question that can be answered with only one word or a phrase that contains only one sentence.\n\nFor example: Question : What is the total number of people in your family?\n\nAnswers: Your total number of people\n\n\nResponse: E\n\n### Input :If a store receives 3 cans of popsicles for $1.00, how much does it make for each can?\n\n### Response :\n\nRationales :\nFor example: Question: A package of 25 stickers costs $3.00, but a package of 5 stickers costs $1.50 and a package of 7 sticker costs $2.50. What does each sticker cost?\nAnswers: 0.125. 0.25 0.1\n\n\n#### Input: You can recycle newspapers for $2.00 per 10 kg or cans for $.50 per 12 cans. You recycled 20 kg of newspapers and 4 cans. How much money did you make from recycling?\n\n### Rationales: For the given information of question and the recycling rates of $2.00 for each 10 kg of newpapers and $.50 for each 12 cans, each has a unit value of $0.10. So we can multiply the value and the recyled quantity to get the total value for recycled goods.\n\nFor the question there are recycled quantities of 20 kg of new paper and 4 cans of 12.\n\nSo total recycled quantity of 20 kg and 4 cans are multiplied with the unit value of $0,10 so total value for recycleyed newpaper is $2.00 x 20 = $40.00 and for cans of 16 quantity with $0.50 unit price = $8.00\nTotal value of recycling newpaper and cans of 144 can be calculated using the answer for each.\n\n\n$$Total\\ Value=\\ $20.00\\ +\\ $40.0 0$=\\ $", "answer": "C: authentic"}

A game is interesting when it is exciting, fun, challenging, etc. A challenging game is the game that is difficult to win.

To this, a game that is very heavy is not interesting by its heavy playing equipment.\n\nGamers play card games as a challenge for mental ability and a chance to win money.

The following factors:  A: physical fitness B: spiritual C: mental D: happiness E: pleasure\n\n### Response : Answer: B Strong feelings can be experienced from many things. For example, having a strong feeling about a specific topic.\n\nStrong feelings can also be experienced through physical exercises. Exercises is a process of repetitive movements that are aimed to build muscle strength, increase muscle tone, increase range of motion and improve cardiovascular and respiratory function. In this process, the body can produce hormones that can promote the feelings of happiness.\n\n### Rationale :\nPeople's time spent exercising is proportional to how they feel. People feel better when they do exercise more. Increasing exercise will increase people's feelings. There are also other factors that can improve people's feelings, such as spiritual and mental.

{"text": "College Dorm \n### Rationales: The problem gives us three possible locations for buying a binder. The answer is based on the description of each location given by its corresponding letter. A college dorm refers to college students who live in a dorm. It should be relatively obvious that college students can buy a binder from the backpacks which are already in the college dorm room. This is because college students have to use a college-provided backpack in order to travel with their belongings.\n\nThe problem states that college students can buy binders from backpacks. The word \u201cbackpack\u201d is a synonym for \u201cdorm,\u201d which is the context of the problem. The only location that makes sense to buy a binder is the dorm because you already find backpacks and binders in the same place.

A and B are options A and B respectively, with C and D being their respective reverses. Option D\u2014spending more money\u2014is a logical impossibility, as we don\u2019t want to spend more money in order to save. Option A is a bad choice because we want to save money, not spend it. The problem states that we want to keep the spending the same, so putting aside more money is better than spending less money each month. Therefore, the answer should be B, putting away more money.\n\n### 2", "answer": "E: office supply store"}

As they try to find solutions, they are often tempted to ignore their critical thinking to the side. The problem is that not being able to critically evaluate ideas creates problems. The best solution to the problem is to actively develop good critical thinking skills by teaching it. By teaching children how to problem solve at a young age will better equip them for life. It prevents them from making poor decisions and teaches them how to think about things as an adult.\n\n### Input An opinion against this thesis is that teaching children as young as kindergarteners about critical thinking is too soon and this lesson should be taught when children are older and more understanding.\n### Response: When thinking about the problems in the world it is clear that good critical thinking needs to be taught to both children and adults. One of the best things to be taught to children when they are young is how to analyze problems and think critically about them. If teaching children how to critically think earlier than other grades will allow them to become more advanced than other students their age. It will provide a major benefit later on.

They think that it is very easy to just forget the bad habit because one just replaces it with positive habits. However, these people forget the most important thing to breaking bad habits. People need to train their brain until it no longer thinks about the bad habit, they call it unconscious learning. This theory is widely accepted in psychology.

{"text": "A. owner\n\n### Reason: The branch's head, being the most important authority, would act with authority to whoever is below him.\n\nAs seen in the question, the branch's head is yelling at someone below him, but this someone cannot be his subordinate. This is because the branch's head refers to \"the branch is underperforming\", suggesting that the branch he is yelling is underperforming itself, whereas \"the branch's head is underperforming\" would contradict as this position is the one in charge of the branch. Thus, he cannot be both pointing to it and being under it.\n\nFurthermore, since the branch's head has the authority over a branch, if he points to himself, then he is not the one he is yelling at. This is because his authority is not given to anyone but him, and pointing to someone that is in charge of someone is illogical; this would mean that the person pointed to is the real head, which is against what the scenario states as the real head is yelling at a subordinate.\n\n### Input\n\n### Requires: A: One point of 1,000,000 is ____.

{"text": "James was scared of death.\n\n### Reason:  The problem states that James was frightened. If something makes someone scared that usually it indicates the presence of some form of evil. If we consider the possible choices: 1. A & C: These don\u2019t seem to apply here. 2. E: Losing life doesn\u2019t equate to the same definition of death i.e. absence/end of life. 3. B: Coma is a temporary reduction of a human's capacity for consciousness. 4. D: This probably makes the most sense. Forgetting to do something you wanted to do usually means there's an absence of life or existence. However, what may make James scared is that this absence of life would have been forever.\n\n### Input Answer:James felt himself losing air.  His vision began to fade.  He couldn't tell if he was awake or dreaming.  What scared him the most? Choices:  a.  dizziness b. disorientation c. death d. darkness e. panic.\n\n### Response Answer:c. death\n\n### Reasons: James is scared of death because he thought he was dying.  The problem states that his vision came into view, suggesting, that he wasn\u2019t dead. We believe James is not dead because if he was dead, his vision wouldn\u2019t be coming into view. \n\nJames\u2019s state of disorientation also would mean he wasn\u2019t dead either as it has been theorised that death is a state of complete conscious awareness.  We have ruled out, blindness, panic, coma, dizziness, and disorientation as James wasn't dead.  James thinks he dies because that\u2019s what\u2019s making him scared. Therefore, the state that scared him most was the state in which he was in, namely, that he died.\n\n### Reference:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBVY14Dj-Qs\n\n### Explanation\n[Answer](https://youtu.be/hxn6Z_w4zG4?t=729){: target=\"_blank\"} (0:55){: target=\"_self\"}", "answer": "A: death"}

We know from above that you will need to do it 10 times. Therefore, the answer is 10 times 1 minute = 60 minutes (or roughly 1 hour or more).\n\n### Input Which is better? Choose either (a) or (b): A: \ud835\udfcf + \ud835\udfd1 = 4 B: \ud835\udfd1 - \ud835\udfcf = 4\n\n### Rationale:\nFor (a), in order to get to value 4, the equation has to be solved in this manner: (1) + (3) = 4. Since the question is: What is better, a or b? a is better because it yields the correct answer more easily and efficiently.\n\nFor (b), it is much easier for answer a to get what the question is asking without making any errors: (3) - (1) = 4.

Not what we are feeling. B) We communicate, but don\u2019t express ourselves either way.  If you\u2019re communicating with me, I should be able to understand how you feel or otherwise understand your actions. C) We simply feel emotions and don\u2019t express ourselves.  I can be feeling an emotion without you understanding why. D) There are no emotions felt by humans so we simply express them. If you\u2019re standing in front of a crowd looking like you\u2019ve been hit by a train and not saying a word, they don\u2019t believe you even feel anything unless you communicate the emotion to the group. People won\u2019t understand why you feel this way, but if we can understand the emotion, we can understand the cause and how to react. E) We simply suffer.  No emotional connection to what we are feeling makes us feel the pain, not emotion.  We simply feel pain instead of feeling how we feel when we break our leg.  If we don\u2019t express how we feel or communicate that our leg is broken, people simply don\u2019t understand why we broke our leg.\n\n- You can't express what you don't feel.

We can then multiply 1 by itself, and if you keep doing that over and over you'll get 2(2)(2)(2)(2...(2)(2)(= 2^(2 x 2 x 2 x...(2 x 2 x (2 2 2(2 x 2(2))(2))(2)))) which equals 2^33. We get that by putting the 2 on the left side of the inequality, and the parentheses on the right side. All of the parentheses are equal, so, with the 2s and the parentheses you would get the correct response of 2^33, or 8,388,608. 8,384 x 2 = 16,768. The 608 is the remainder of the 2^33 divided by 2.

{"text": "Answer: d or e.\n\n### Input:\"I will be at your party tomorrow at eight O'clock.\"  How will I be?\n### Demonstraion:\nThe problem states that the girl will be at the party tomorrow at eight o'clock. To answer this question, we need to determine the meaning of the word \"I,\" which is a pronoun. The girl could be using herself as the subject in the sentence \"I will be,\" but the question \"How will I be\" suggests that the pronoun is singular. The pronoun \"I will be\" could only refer to the girl as the person in the sentence. This indicates that the subject would be \"girl.\"\nThe sentence structure states that she will be at the party. If the girl will be at a specific place, the place must be noun. The adverb \"tomorrow\" states that the girl will not be at the party today, but at a specific time in the future. Since the pronoun \"I\" is singular and is always used as a subject in a sentence, the singular pronoun \"I\" must refer to the girl who will be attending the party. Therefore, the best answer to the question would be (A).\n\n### Input\"I want ice. What would you like for drink?\" Choices: A: coffee B: tea C: water D: soda\n\nRationales: In the sentence the boy, who wants and ice drink, is the subject. The boy must have a drink, so the drink must be a noun. The choices given are not the type of drink asked for, they are not used in the sentence. The ice drink would be a drink with ice that the boy requested, but the boy did not request for tea, water or soda as given in the choices. Therefore, the best choice would be C.\n\n###Input \"I took my dog for a walk, and I ran into my former neighbor who I hadn't seen in a year!\" How would I get the dog?

Classroom buses work in the set-oriented paradigm, which means that there is an array to store the amount of buses. This array can contain only positive integers and its maximum size is 11.\n\n2. If the amount of students assigned to that classroom is not divisible by three (due to the max number of buses that the class can operate), then the remaining students will be placed on regular buses.\n\n3. When a classroom has more than 10 assigned students, it becomes a bus itself. \n\n### Expected Output\nFor example, if you try it with 8, then 2 students are assigned to each classroom and 4 students to classroom 8. Since 4 is not divisible by 3, 2 students are added on regular buses and classroom 8 becomes a bus. \n\nWith 5 students assigned to each class, classroom 5 will be on a bus as it can not be divided by 3.\n\nSince there are no more buses, you return \u201cNot enough\u201d as the answer.\n\n\n### Input 2\nThe function that follows take in an integer n representing how many students per classroom on the first line from 0 to 30 and returns the smallest bus number represented by a string.\n```python\nn = enter(int)\n```\n### Expected output 2\nBus number 3 is the smallest bus, so your main function have to", "answer": "A: utah"}

As the leather is made of animal skin, it tends to be of a softer texture making the seat lose elasticity. This factor combined with the amount of time that the average car spent on the road (19,355 miles/year) would cause the leather to deteriorate and decompose.

The choices are for possible mistakes people make when trying to call other individuals.\n\n(A) No Service refers to the caller not being able to reach the phone number; this is most likely caused by an outage with the telephone line or the cellphone network. \n(B) Caller ID refers to having the recipient of the call view the individual's name, rather than just an unidentified caller. \n(C) Ring back refers to having the phone ring; this is different from having no service. \n(D) Redial refers to the individual dialing the phone number again to try to reach the person.\n\n\n\n---\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following questions about the passage.\n\n### Note", "answer": "B: theater"}

To figure it out, try to ask a question about the object that John damaged the window: Do you feel guilty for breaking the window?\n\nIf the object that John damages is a friend's house, then John will answer \"yes\" to the second question. If the object that John damaging isn't a friend's house but a window, then John will answer no to the second question.\n\nTherefore, John did not damage the classroom because he says \"no.\" John broke the curtains because the curtains were damaged, and John felt guilty.\n\nWe can conclude that the person that John damaged is the curtains.\n\nAnswer: John broke the curtain.", "answer": "A: friend's house"}

They tell you that the schools are facing very similar problems. However, one school has a policy not letting boys know certain racial information. The other school has been holding anti-racism seminars.

This is the biggest obstacle to make their school more diversified. If the boys know about the other\u2019s background, they could be friendly, thus making their school more diverse. The same goes for the seminar, it will help the boys learn about the importance of diversification in school. \n\nInput: One-third of the country is flat, and the mountains are too many to count.

If the bus will come on time, then this is a true statement.\n\n### For each statement below, specify whether the statement describes an effective and/or efficient solution.\n\n### Solution:Effective\n\n### Rationale:\n\nThe problem asks to identify which statements are effective and efficient solutions to the problem. An effective solution is one that solves the problem or completes the task entirely. As an example, we ask the student to complete a sentence that describes their favorite school subject. This would be an effective solution because it has completed the task of describing a student's favorite subject.\n\nAn efficient solution would solve the problem in part, or achieve only partial success at the task. If, after asking the student to complete the sentence, it were later determined that the student enjoys math more, the student would have completed the task, but has also performed an inefficient solution that could require asking several questions.\n\n### Response\n\n### RATIO- NEED IT FIXED BUT CODE IS GREAT\n\n### A number n is a factor of an integer k if k is divisible by n, meaning that there is a number b such that k \u00f7 b = 0. The number n is a factor, or divisor, of k. For example, n is a factor of any number m, since every whole number is divisible by 1. Thus, n is a factor n of k in every integer n, and thus n is always a factor of k in.\n\n###", "answer": "D: mouth"}

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem states that the family recycles 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers. We are given the recycle value for a set number of cans and newspapers: every 12 cans are worth $0.50, and every 5 kilograms of newspapers is worth $1.50.<n><n>To find out how much money the family can earn from recycling cans, we need to divide the total number of cans by the number of cans needed to earn $0.50: 144/12 = 12 sets. Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12. Therefore, the family would receive $12 in total.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:Google Maps and other highway and street GPS services have replaced what?

This person could potentially fall down. They could also throw up, and lower their own standards for what is appropriate. But the only choice option that makes sense in this context is vomiting, since a drunk person is likely to vomit. <n><n>### Input<n><n>The following equation is the formula for the value of a rectangle. <n>_v_ = l (b)<n>Write a Python program that will calculate the value of a rectangle with the dimensions shown in the figure.<n><n>The formula _v_ = l ( _b_ ) can be separated into the following: _v_ is the volume, _l_ is the length, and _b_ is the base. Because _b_ is the only free variable in this equation, it makes sense to use it to calculate the volume of a shape of any size instead of using _l_.<n>When solving the above, try writing out the equation for a rectangle with the formula _l_ = ( _w_ ) ( _h_ ).<n><n>### Explanation<n><n>The equation given is: _v_ = l _b_. In Python, an equation is written as an assignment operator between the variable and its desired value. First, I converted the variable l to a variable named l. Then, I converted b to a variable named b. Finally, I assigned the value of _v_ to l _b_.<n><n>l = l + b<n>b = l * b<n>_v_ =  _v_ * _b_<n>_v_ = ( _v_ + _b_ )<n>_v_ = _v_ - _b_<n>_b_ = l<n>l = b<n>v = v - b<n>_b_ = v<n>```<n><n>#### Challenge<n><n>Write a program that will calculate the volume of a rectangular box without making use of any methods described in the problem.<n><n>### Solution<n><n><n>```<n>b = l * _b_<n>l = b<n>_v_ - _b_.<n>_b_ - _v_<n>b = _v_<n>```<n>

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem states that the family recycles 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers. We are given the recycle value for a set number of cans and newspapers: every 12 cans are worth $0.50, and every 5 kilograms of newspapers is worth $1.50.<n><n>To find out how much money the family can earn from recycling cans, we need to divide the total number of cans by the number of cans needed to earn $0.50: 144/12 = 12 sets. Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12.

Another advantage is to conserve natural resources. By recycling instead of using natural resources in our products such as trees from paper, bottles from glass, aluminum is made from tin ore, copper is made from copper ore, and other metals like iron are made from iron ore (U.S. Department of Energy, 28 May 2015)<n><n>The research also says that there are few disadvantages.

We can infer that we'll never see both types of locations in this problem.<n><n>1) We start with the first day, when the man saw 8 birds. At each bird he sees, he's going to have to pass a bus stop.<n><n>2) On the second day, 12 birds are added to the total.

Choices:  A: a bed of nails B: town C: attractive consistent look D: city block E: ground<n><n>### Response:		The answer should be "Option B: town"<n><n>Demonstration:The question states that Bob ran from the "corner store" (a business selling alcohol, tobacco, grocery items, and sometimes prepared take-out meals), but it is unclear where he ran after picking up his shoes ("didn't know where they (the shoes) landed"). He must have ran "into town" (the main commercial district of a rural area that has streets laid out in a grid pattern - usually a village or a community of at least 2,500 inhabitants), and not just the "corner" of town where the corner store is located.<n><n>The answer cannot be "a bed of nails" because we have no information regarding the surface the shoes were left on.<n><n>The answer could also not be "attractive consistent look" because this phrase is not a place; in order to be a place, the phrase would have to be followed by either an article of clothing or a geographic term, which is not the case for "attractive consistent." Therefore, the answer cannot be "city block" or "ground" because the question does not state what kind of surface Bob is running on.<n><n>### Input<n><n>Ron:  I want to get to level 15.

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem states that the family recycles 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers. We are given the recycle value for a set number of cans and newspapers: every 12 cans are worth $0.50, and every 5 kilograms of newspapers is worth $1.50.<n><n>To find out how much money the family can earn from recycling cans, we need to divide the total number of cans by the number of cans needed to earn $0.50: 144/12 = 12 sets. Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12. Therefore, the family would receive $12 in total.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:What type of home is most likely to have an attic filled with historical items? Choices:  A: top of home B: older houses C: victorian house D: own home E: material<n><n>### Response:		B<n><n>### Rationale:In response to the last step, a student may provide an incorrect answer without realizing it. For instance, if a student answers E, he may not realize that houses constructed in the 1970s are not victorian. In this situation, the student may think he made a correct response, when in reality his answer was incorrect.<n><n>### Other comments about the question:<n><n>If this answer does not resolve your problem, please answer a new question with your error.

When spoiled foods are brought back to room temperature they can be harmful to consume and can cause you to get sick. This is because the bacteria in the food multiplies a lot faster when the food is brought to room temperature, and this speedy reproduction can make someone sick if it is consumed. According to the USDA Food Safety, "The rule is to throw out potentially unsafe foods if they have been left out of a refrigerator for more than two hours (or one hour above 90 degrees Fahrenheit)". In this situation if the fridge was left opened for an extra five days, and the jar of the jam was 150 degrees Fahrenheit (as the warmest temperature of temperature), the Jam would be spoiled after the five days.<n><n><n>### Input 12:<n>I was wondering, can a bee keep honey that is inside an apiary (the place where you keep or breed bees)?<n>  <n>### Response:<n>Yes, bee can honey inside an apiary<n><n>###

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem states that the family recycles 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers. We are given the recycle value for a set number of cans and newspapers: every 12 cans are worth $0.50, and every 5 kilograms of newspapers is worth $1.50.<n><n>To find out how much money the family can earn from recycling cans, we need to divide the total number of cans by the number of cans needed to earn $0.50: 144/12 = 12 sets. Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12.

I tried writing an if/else if/else statement, but when I finished it, I noticed that I made a mistake in my logic and made another if/else statement. I made the first statement from parent A who has the idea of playing sports to get their children to learn teamwork. I decided to make the second statement from parent B.<n>2. The second if/else statement I made was from parent C. As for now, those parents have a strong interest in playing games with their children, but they are not certain if they should sign their children up for it. I will add more if/else statements before I finish this task.<n>3. I added more if/else statements. Now, one more for parents D and one more for E. However, I decided to make these to different parent groups based on their interests.<n>4. I'm not sure if it is correct to make a else statement for the parents who has already sign-up with their child for a tournament.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. My logic to find out if the parents wants to sign up their child for a tournament<n><n>If/else statement A:<n><n>IF: the parents have the idea to sign up for a tournament then:<n><n>1. The parents have a strong interest to sign up their child to join a tournament. Then, the program will sign up the child.<n>2. Else: The program will show the parents that maybe a tournament is not a better idea. Then, the parents will see the parents choice and decide if they still want to sign up their child.<n><n>If/else Statement B:<n><n>IF: The parents are not sure whether to sign up their child then<n><n>1. The program will show the child's interest(s) and then the parents will evaluate if it is a good idea. If the parents thinks the child is interested, then the program will sign up their child to play the sport. If not, the program will show the parents to consider what the parents want.<n><n>2. Else: If the parents thinks they don't want their child to play a tournament, the program will sign the child out.<n><n><n><n><n><n>In this task, you will find the missing instructions in the following multiple choice question(s) for the parent(s).<n><n>1.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: For every 12 cans you recycle, you receive $0.50, and for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, you receive $1.50. If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem states that the family recycles 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers. We are given the recycle value for a set number of cans and newspapers: every 12 cans are worth $0.50, and every 5 kilograms of newspapers is worth $1.50.<n><n>To find out how much money the family can earn from recycling cans, we need to divide the total number of cans by the number of cans needed to earn $0.50: 144/12 = 12 sets. Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12. Therefore, the family would receive $12 in total.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:People want to explore space, so what should they use to do it? Choices:  A: public place B: roadblock C: space shuttle D: hoverboard E: supermarket<n><n>### Response:		<n>Idea: For people to explore space safely, we need to build up structures that are resistant to gravity.<n><n>A roadblock is an obstacle that prevents people from doing something. It is not appropriate because space and planets are so vast, and a roadblock would not be useful in such a huge space.<n><n>D, E, A, and B may not appear to be the most appropriate responses, but they are related to the theme of spacecraft. When we build the hoverboard or roadblock, we use metal which is in space for the spacecraft.<n><n>However, the supermarket does not fit with the theme because people can buy food and drinks from it, and it is a place where people trade. It has nothing to do with spacecraft. C is also incorrect.<n>### Input: There is an old tree in the middle of a forest. The tree is on a clearing that's 3 feet off the ground.<n><n>### Response<n><n>Idea: The first option is that there is no branch on the tree. The next option is that there is one branch on the tree which is growing on the ground. The third option is that there is only one branch from the tree's top while the last option is that the branch is hanging on two branches.<n><n>In this case, there are two branches of the tree. One branch is on the floor, while the other branch is on the tree. Both branches are not the same length because of where they're located. The second one on top of the tree is higher than the one on the floor. The two branches have a distance or space or separation between them.<n><n>If there is a branch hanging onto the tree, then there is also separation. There are two branches that are not directly joined together because the first one is at the bottom of the tree and second one is on top of the tree. The first branch is on the floor with its direction towards the top of the tree. Likewise, the second branch is facing the top side of the tree with its direction towards the bottom of the tree.<n><n>In the image below, we can see that there is a space between the branches which indicates the separation. In another example, see the image below.<n><n>### Input<n><n>Write a response that correctly completes the request. ________<n><n>### Response <n><n>_______<n>### Input:<n>Write a

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem states that the family recycles 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers. We are given the recycle value for a set number of cans and newspapers: every 12 cans are worth $0.50, and every 5 kilograms of newspapers is worth $1.50.<n><n>To find out how much money the family can earn from recycling cans, we need to divide the total number of cans by the number of cans needed to earn $0.50: 144/12 = 12 sets. Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12. Therefore, the family would receive $12 in total.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:Where could you find some large pieces of paper that are not for sale?

Choices:  A: toy store B: basement C: school D: rest area E: building<n><n>### Response:		<n>#### Answer choice A.<n>Toy stores don't have a place to plug in RVs for electricity, just like they don't have a store to buy RVs either. This is because toy stores don't sell RVs, and toy stores selling other big expensive items wouldn't be profitable. This is one of the reasons why Target sells groceries along with toys; it would increase its overall revenue.<n><n>#### Answer choice B.<n>John would not be able to plug in his RV in the basement because there are no outlets for it to plug in.<n><n>#### Answer Choice C.<n>For this question to make sense, John's RV should be for sale because it is clearly big and expensive. John could sell it at a toy store for the same price to increase sales.<n><n>#### AnswerChoice D.<n>It does not make sense that John's RV needs electrical power from the rest area. The RV should be located somewhere without electricity and in a place with a lot of empty spaces with no buildings around.<n><n>#### Answerchoice E.<n>It makes sense that John's electricity comes from his RV. It does not make sense that it comes from a building because a building needs to have electricity which costs more money when it is located somewhere more than one mile away from a store.<n><n>### Input : John and Jan went on a hike. They were lost, so they tried to find their way out. To do this, they had to go to a store that sells things needed for hiking, such as gloves, warm clothes, and a flashlight, so they could find the way home. But because each group's items were different, what store would each group go to? Answer choices:  A: clothing store B: gas station C: hardware store D: grocery store E: drugstore<n>#### Answer choice A)<n>The clothing store was the only choice of the five different stores. John has a sweater and a hat, and Jan has gloves, a flashlight, and warm socks. In order for them to go to a store and buy things, they need to go to a store where they can get what they need. The clothing store is the only place where they can buy warm clothes, so they go there.<n><n>#### Answer chose B)

Choices:  A: suitcase B: department store C: safe deposit box D: these twos are not safe way to transport jewellery E: lady's boudoir<n><n>### Response:		<n>E<n><n>### Instructive:<n>1.	Identify that not answer E, is the most appropriate answer in the multiple choice item, as it is the choice that gives an incorrect instruction for jewelry transportation. The item says that A, B, C and D are all the wrong answers. Therefore, the answer E (lady’s boudoir) should also be listed with A, B, C, and D.<n><n>2.	Explain that the word ‘safe’ should be interpreted in its figurative sense. Jewelry does not need to literally be in a ‘safe’ (a locked box or other container) in order to be safe from loss. The answer E, as it refers to transporting jewelry for a lady to a special place for securing a special place for it (a boudoir, for those who are not familiar with the term), implies that jewelry should be placed somewhere in a location that is safe. A lady’s boudoir, by this definition, would not be a safe place to transport jewelery.<n><n>### Example:<n>For each of these questions, circle the answer that best explains the passage.<n><n>Which of the choices below best serves as an explanation for this passage?

Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12. Therefore, the family would receive $12 in total.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:After new coke was discontinued what formula was used?

Below 580°C water boils at a rate of 1 pint in <n>every 40 seconds. How long would it take for 20 pints of water to boil at 570°C? Choice: A: 40 seconds B:1.25 seconds C: less than 40 seconds D:9 seconds<n><n>### Rationales<n>Because the rate of water boiling is inversely related to the temperature, 1 pint in 40 seconds at 580 would equal 1 pint for every 40 seconds at temperatures below 580. If we consider the rate of water boiled vs the temperature, we can solve for how long it would take for 20<n>pints, which is 50 gallons, at 570 degrees.<n><n>Let's think about this in terms of 1 pint. If at 580 it would take 1 pint in 50 seconds, then at 570 it would take 20x 1/50 = 10 pints in 200 seconds, and then at 590 it would take 40x1/50 =20 pints, making 20 pints at 570 in 50/50 = 50 seconds.<n><n>We can re-write the equation to solve as T(570) = 50/5,000,000 = (20,000,400/50) = 20,004,000.<n><n>### Input<n>Input: There are three main parts in one of my favourite machines.

Choices:  A: eternal B: religious C: unpredictable D: holy E: monastic<n><n>### Response:		The correct response and answer is: “C unpredictable”<n><n>### <n><n>### Input:(Demonstration): This robot is an advanced version of the original AKAIA.  It has only two wheels and no hands.  The AKAIA can travel across a variety of surfaces, and the wheels are made to rotate on sand, ice, and tile.  This AKAIA is made using A4 paper and can’t crumple or bend in any other direction.  The AKIA is 80mm long and 160mm wide and 300mm tall. <n><n>The robot has 10 legs on each side with a central axle that acts as its backbone.  The axle moves side to side and can be steered by a remote control. With each rotation of the axle, the AKIA also rotates 15 degrees forward or backward, which can allow it to go around corners.  On top of the axle are 6 red and 6 blue arms that can be used for balance.  The red arms are shorter and stronger, so they’re typically used more often than the blue arms.  On its face is a set of eyes that each contain 3 LEDs.  They’re used to view the surface that the robot is moving across and keep it balanced. <n><n>If an object is approaching the AKIA fast enough, which is defined by the parameter c, the AKAIA will move straight at it and knock it aside.  The AKAI uses this strategy for obstacles at speeds of up to 6 km/hr.  At higher speeds, however, the robot will veer away from the object because it’s at an increased risk of crashing.  The AKI uses the same technique for obstacles at very low speeds, as well.  However, since it can’t detect the speed of a moving object very accurately unless it approaches it, it won’t deviate from its path until it’s very near the obstacle. <n><n>The AKIA’s main mode of locomotion is walking, but when it goes around corners, it has two other ways to travel: It can either lean back or forward with its arms, or it can stand upright and slide along the sides of the robot.

Choices:  A: grill B: go to market C: bring home fish D: eat hamburger E: make bread<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>I assume that the question is asking what I would do if I were hungry, which is why I chose grilling. In some places, fishermen can keep some of the fish that they catch. As the population increases, more and more people would like to eat fish, so people start selling the fish. Fishing has been a big part of the coastal culture for some time. Even if you choose not to eat the fish, people still consider selling it. There is also a significant amount of fish available in these areas. However, not everything is easy to catch.<n><n>I believe that it is better for you to use the fish rather than just throw it away. By doing so, you can save more time. Fishing isn't always available in these places. However, I feel that it would be better if you had a place in which to store your fish after catching it. There is no telling how long you will be fishing, so you should make sure you have enough space for your fish. This is because, after all, you will want some of the fish, so it's best to have some.<n><n>### Answer: (C) Bring Home Fish.

Then apply the discount.<n><n>If the customer spent $1 more on Ketchup, it means they will buy 7 ounces which is equal to $1. So the customer receives 3 ounces of Ketchup for free. Now, the customer spent $2.75 (2 Large burgers, $2 each =$4). Next, the customer received $2 discount on each burger (10 small burgers * $2 discount per burger =$20). <n><n>So the total of the cost is $1($ for 1.23 ounces of ketchup) +$4( for 2 large burgers) + $20 (discount for burger) =$2

The first possibility is one where the card's name is in alphabetical order (e.g. Ace of Clubs, 2 of any club, 5 of Clubs, King of Clubs).

Choices:  A: food court B: jerusalem C: new york city D: jewish community E: town<n><n>### Response:		<n>A -> C<n><n>### Demostration:<n>Rationales: A kosher deli is a deli where only Jewish people shop. The deli is for Jewish people only and cannot be bought out by any other group. Food courts are the same for everyone, and everyone can eat in a food court. Jerusalem is in Israel, which means this town only accepts Jewish people. Jewish communitys do not have to have the same food, the same prices, the same people, or the same rules. If a person wants Jewish food, then that person cannot go to another area for Jewish food. People cannot eat outside of the Jewish Community. New York City does accept all kinds of people. People who do or do not celebrate Jewish Holidays can go there. Kosher deli's are for people of Judaism only.<n><n>### Input:'Hello, I have a question for you.

The large pizza cost $18.'<n>'The small drinks cost $1.75 each and the total will be $3.50.  There was a tax of 8% and a tip of 10%.'<n><n>### Demos:<n>**Rationales:** The pizza was small so the customer paid 85 cents. Her neighbor got the 9" small pizza. She paid 18 dollars for her 12" large pizza. She paid for the 7" large can of pepsi. If her bill was 22.50 then her drink and the smaller pizza were free. If the pizza was $18, the tip was 10% of $18. The tip for $18 is $1.80. So the total is $18 (for the pizza) + $1.80 (for the tip) + $1.75*2 (for two

Choices:  A: nearest house B: workplace C: surface of earth D: office block E: his feet<n><n>### Response:		<n>The correct response is "C". This is because the text states that he is sitting in the orbiting space stations, and space stations are located 300 miles above the Earth surface, so he has missed the Earth's surface.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>Gary was flying past the planet Venus when his spacecraft suddenly malfunctioned.

Rather, they are related to a physical or neurological limitation of a body part or functioning part of the body (i.e., the arms, legs, and hands are not the brain or eyes).<n><n>### Answer Explanation:<n>Incorrect Answers<n>- **C Potential** : Disabilities are not characterized solely by the possibility of what people can achieve. They also mean that people require accommodations, modifications, and support in order to be able to perform a task. Thus, “potential” is not an accurate disability descriptor.<n><n>- **D Qualification** : The term “qualification” may bring to mind a specific ability in a certain context. However, people with disabilities have unique strengths and are able to do a variety of things. Thus, “qualification” is not a disability descriptor.

Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12. Therefore, the family would receive $12 in total.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:A beaver builds structures to block what sort of feature?

In other words, they failed to represent a whole number using the correct number of zeros.<n>Explanation: An accounting company that handles large numbers is trying to identify numbers related to an expense report. We’re not told if any numbers are negative, so we’ll leave that for the instructor. The numbers listed are in the form of the decimal number, so we need to convert those numerals into whole numbers by getting rid of the decimal portion of the numbers. To do that, we take each number and convert the decimal number into a recurring digit (1s) that fills up the placeholders based on the number of decimal places (2 digits in the number and 2 total decimal placeholders). The number 22 is made by adding in 2 (to go with the decimal placement) + 2. The number 35 is made by adding in the 5 (to go with the 1 decimal placement) + the 5 already present (2 + 3). The number 58 is made by adding in a 5 + 8. The number 67 is made by adding in an 8 + 7. The number 8 is made by adding 0 + 8. The final number we’re given is 5. The list of whole numbers should have been 1 | 2 | 3 | 4| 5.<n><n>### Input<n>The company assigned you their project to find out why there’s a difference between what has been shown in their data and an estimate made by their marketing department.<n><n>### Data & Analysis:<n>1.

Thus, the following is the result.<n>``` java<n>String word = "123";<n>String[] split = word.split(" ");<n>for (int i = 0; i < split.length; i++) {<n>  String val = split[i];<n>  word += val;<n>}<n>```<n>### Input Example<n>If we were checking if the string '420' is valid in python, we could try to make combinations of the input with single values or all values, and check if the output are 420, 204, 240, or 420.

This would include all combinations of the list. Below is an example, using recursion.<n>```<n>def comb (A [list], string = "", maxLength = len(A)) :<n>  if A:<n>    num = int (A [0])<n>    if len(string) < maxLength or num in string :<n>      if (num <= len(string)):<n>        comb (A [0: maxLength-1], string + str (num))<n>

If the grammar and word selection are incorrect, then the sentence is in error. Please note that the name in English may be spelled differently, but the same word in a different language is spelled differently.

We are given the recycle value for a set number of cans and newspapers: every 12 cans are worth $0.50, and every 5 kilograms of newspapers is worth $1.50.<n><n>To find out how much money the family can earn from recycling cans, we need to divide the total number of cans by the number of cans needed to earn $0.50: 144/12 = 12 sets. Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12. Therefore, the family would receive $12 in total.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:The person turned the oven on and put a pizza in, what happened one hour later?

After they wander around for a while, the group’s leader suggests that they look at what the cacti were doing during the year 2000.  He tells them that they can click on each cactus and read all about where it currently lives and what it has been doing for the last 20 years! But, the group leader warns them that if they click on any of the cacti, the cacti will stop sharing their lives with the visitors. The visitors are free to pick as many cacti to click on as they wish, but they can choose only a total of 5 cacti before they will have to come back to the museum after at least 1 week. Visitors are not allowed to click on any cacti before the museum opens for the day. When they leave the museum to click on as many cacti as they want, they are allowed to bring in as much water and food as they can carry. Afterward, they must take one more break for lunch and return to the museum at the same time to see the results of their actions.<n><n>Rationales: I think the first way to determine the total amount of money the visitors could spend on food and water is to determine how many cacti they can visit in the first place. In other words,  how many cacti do they click on before they have to come back to see the results of how their actions affected the cacti? To do this, we need to divide 5 (the total amount of cacti they can click on before they have come back to see the effects of their actions) by the amount they can click on in one day. In other words, in order to choose 5 cacti, they must go out and click on as many cactic as necessary to earn back their 5 cacti.<n><n>In order to figure out how many days to visit the cacti, we must consider the time necessary to travel to the outskirts where the cacti lives and the time it takes for them to see before they have come back. In other words, we must determine how many days it takes for their adventure in the cactus museum to complete before visiting the cacti they chose.<n><n>To figure

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem states that the family recycles 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers. We are given the recycle value for a set number of cans and newspapers: every 12 cans are worth $0.50, and every 5 kilograms of newspapers is worth $1.50.<n><n>To find out how much money the family can earn from recycling cans, we need to divide the total number of cans by the number of cans needed to earn $0.50: 144/12 = 12 sets. Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12. Therefore, the family would receive $12 in total.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:Jamie wanted to reduce her waist size, but all of her efforts failed miserably.  She continued to do what?

If the customer in the store buys 5 items that are each 10% of the total of the 449 items, how many coupons will the customer receive?<n>Rational: The problem states the customer buys 5 items, and each item is 10% of 449 items. We are given the discount value <n>(i.e. what each item is worth). We need to divide how many of each item will the customer receive to get the total number of discounted items. We'll call the items "items" and "m" the number of items, and then the total number of items is m*449. <n><n>We'll first calculate the value each item is worth, so we take a simple example of 5 of the items: <n><n>$5*10%/100=$0.5 (in dollars or cents if needed)<n><n>The next step is to find how many coupons the customer will get: <n><n>$0.5*m*449 =?<n><n>Solving for m:<n><n>m = $449,5*0.5 = 27.5<n><n>The customer will get total of 27 discounted items (5 bought items x 449 coupons).<n>Ans: 27<n><n>You may like to start off by doing the "easy part" first, and then go back and "fill in" the other details.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: For every 12 cans you recycle, you receive $0.50, and for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, you receive $1.50. If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem states that the family recycles 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers. We are given the recycle value for a set number of cans and newspapers: every 12 cans are worth $0.50, and every 5 kilograms of newspapers is worth $1.50.<n><n>To find out how much money the family can earn from recycling cans, we need to divide the total number of cans by the number of cans needed to earn $0.50: 144/12 = 12 sets. Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12. Therefore, the family would receive $12 in total.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:The old man was retired and liked the simple things, he would do crossword puzzle every morning simply just to do what?

Choices:  A: ruined B: clean clothes C: sadness D: attractive appearance E: look better<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>#### Rationales: The context of the story was a date, so you must conclude that the man was looking to remove stains and improve the cleanliness of his date's clothes.<n><n>### Input : At 9:00, there is a basketball game in progress on two courts. At 9:15, a flag football game on another court and a hand game on a third begins. How many games begin during a 15 minute time span at the game? Choices: 1) 2 games B) 3 games C) 2 games D) 1 game E) 3 games<n><n>#### Rational: The question explicitly states that there are two courts, so we assume the two courts are consecutive courts, because there are four courts in total.<n>Therefore, there must be 1 game scheduled on one court and another game scheduled on a court after that.<n>When considering how many games that are scheduled to begin within one time span, any one game can be scheduled to start at 1:00, and another game can be scheduled to begin at 1:15. In this scenario, one game was scheduled to begin at 9:00 and another game began at 9:15. The duration between 9:00 to 9:15 is 15 minutes, which is time that two games had to fit into in order to start.<n><n>These two games are the only two games that started, so the answer is B.<n><n>##

The correct question was “Which place A, B, C, D, or E could have hundreds of sport goods stores?” We can eliminate the other choices because they cannot host hundreds of sports stores. There can’t be hundreds of sports stores in a town or in a city because in a small town, there are more people than stores or shops, and there is not enough space to host hundreds of sports stores in the same place.

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem states that the family recycles 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers. We are given the recycle value for a set number of cans and newspapers: every 12 cans are worth $0.50, and every 5 kilograms of newspapers is worth $1.50.<n><n>To find out how much money the family can earn from recycling cans, we need to divide the total number of cans by the number of cans needed to earn $0.50: 144/12 = 12 sets. Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12. Therefore, the family would receive $12 in total.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:Where would you put a dictionary while you're using it?

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem states that the family recycles 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers. We are given the recycle value for a set number of cans and newspapers: every 12 cans are worth $0.50, and every 5 kilograms of newspapers is worth $1.50.<n><n>To find out how much money the family can earn from recycling cans, we need to divide the total number of cans by the number of cans needed to earn $0.50: 144/12 = 12 sets. Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12. Therefore, the family would receive $12 in total.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:When a newborn's eyes open for the first time it will be the first time the ever?

Choices:  A: sophisticated B: imprevist C: arcane D: heavenly E: new<n><n>### Response:		The correct response is C. In the given scenario, "mundane routine" represents a routine life. Sophisticated, imprevist, arcane, heavenly, and new do not completely rid of a routine life. <n><n>### Explanation: There must be a break in the routine life to get rid of it. C is the only option that does not fit into a routine life. A sophisticated way eliminates the routine as this involves people who are educated, a higher class. Imprevist is unknown so this would be considered a change in a routine. Arcane is not common, this is the opposite of routine. Heavenly may be a better way to relax instead of a monotonous routine. Finally, new is a new thing that one has never done before so it would change any routine.<n><n>### Input - Solve the mathematical phrase.<n><n>-2 ÷ 3 × 15 + 3<n><n>### Answer: -15

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem states that the family recycles 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers. We are given the recycle value for a set number of cans and newspapers: every 12 cans are worth $0.50, and every 5 kilograms of newspapers is worth $1.50.<n><n>To find out how much money the family can earn from recycling cans, we need to divide the total number of cans by the number of cans needed to earn $0.50: 144/12 = 12 sets. Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12.

We are given the recycle value for a set number of cans and newspapers: every 12 cans are worth $0.50, and every 5 kilograms of newspapers is worth $1.50.<n><n>To find out how much money the family can earn from recycling cans, we need to divide the total number of cans by the number of cans needed to earn $0.50: 144/12 = 12 sets. Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12. Therefore, the family would receive $12 in total.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:Where would you stand in a line and need a coat if it is cold?

Where might he avoid going? Choices:  A: pet store B: parking lot C: woodland D: north america E: park<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer: A: pet store<n><n>### Rationale:<n>As John loves animals and hates animal abuse, he wants to avoid places he finds to be cruel to animals. He would avoid the pet store because he hates the idea that animals are being put in stores to be sold. He would also avoid parking lots because he sees animals roaming the land looking for food. He would avoid woodland because it is a home for animals, and he does not want to disturb their lives. He would also avoid north america as it is home for thousands of people and animals. Finally, because John loves animals so much, he would avoid going to a park for the same reason as he would avoid the pet store; it’s cruel to animals to separate them from their natural habitats. Choice D: It’s not that he would avoid this place, but he would likely visit this place, as it is a place where animals live.<n><n>### Rationales:<n><n>John loves animals and hs has a lot of allergies to dogs.

They then state there is "at least one police officer working the beat during any given 24-hour period." At the same time, they state that "if five or more police officers are assigned to the same shift, a police officer is working the beat every two hours." From this information, we can conclude that each person working the beat is stationed in the neighborhood for two hours. The neighborhood should thus be patrolled every four hours, or eight times for a 24-hour day.<n><n><n><n>![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74689872/152622732-d4707443-79ab-46b0-90f9-4052ff2edd6f.png)<n><n>![image](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Lx0zQ4yCYRs/UXjRM68W9vI/AAAAAAAABv4/qNl5LbXJK0E/s1600/solid+and+striped+shirts+%2B++fashion+styles%2B%2B+color+and+white+shirts+fashion.jpg)<n><n>![https://i.imgur.com/0zUUUV9.png](https://i.imgurcom/0zUuuv9.png)<n><n><n><n><n><n>

A: pieces 					<n>```<n><n>## Tutorial 1: Identify the parts of the sentence<n><n>In this tutorial, we’ll practice identifying the parts of a sentence. Sentence structure is important<n>because it allows us to think better and communicate more effectively. The first thing to do when<n>reading a sentence is to identify the subject. In the sentence below, “The boy” is the subject. All the other<n>words in the sentence, called the predicate, modify the subject in some way.<n><n>The next thing to do when reading a sentence is to identify<n>the verb, or the action going on. Read the sentence below:<n>“The man was walking the dog.” In this sentence, the action is<n>“walking,” and we can label the subject the man. Sentences are<n>usually simple—they have a subject and a predicate. With a little<n>practice, you’ll be able to identify them in no time.<n><n>### Exercise 1: Identify sentences<n><n>In the following sentences, identify the predicate and the subject.<n><n>**Exercise 1a:**<n>> “Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday to you,  Happy birthday dear___________,<n>> Happy birthday to you!”\<n>> <n>> “The boy threw _______ in the air.”<n><n>> “We love to ________ each day.”<n><n>> “The boys ________ and cried.”<n><n>> “John bought me a birthday cake.”<n><n>**Exercice 1b:**<n>> “We were ________ with the cake.”<n><n>> “She likes to ________ with glitter.”<n><n>> “It was really ________.”<n>

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem states that the family recycles 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers. We are given the recycle value for a set number of cans and newspapers: every 12 cans are worth $0.50, and every 5 kilograms of newspapers is worth $1.50.<n><n>To find out how much money the family can earn from recycling cans, we need to divide the total number of cans by the number of cans needed to earn $0.50: 144/12 = 12 sets.

Let C represent the number of hours studied each week, and let B represent the number of hours attended each week. How much homework do students on average complete each week (in hours)?<n><n>### Response:[I would use linear graphs to demonstrate. So if I am asked for each semester a few values that are given, I would write this. 1 semester, for algebra (3 classes), the number of hours is 3 * 60 = 180 + 48 = 228. 1 semester for biology (3 classes), the hours will be 3 * 67 = 201 + 91 = 292. 1 semester in spanish (3 classes), the amount will be 3 *100 + 70 = 300 + 77 = 377. Total sum ( 228+292 + 377 ) ÷ 6 = 228 + 98 + 81 = 207 ].<n><n>### Response from Instructor:Your response was correct!<n><n>### Response to student response from instructor:This seems correct to me.<n><n>### Solution: The number of students that will pass is<n><n>### Description:<n>When you have a question regarding a word, wording, phrase, or other similar expression, it is usually more effective to use Google than it is to use the thesaurus provided by your word processor.

Choices:  A: amount to nothing B: visit relatives C: charming D: doctor himself E: cross street<n><n>### Response:		<n>A: Charmed wood and left for dead<n><n>### Rationale:<n>We are given that the person is wounded. Since they are wounded the first thing that they should do is to seek help. The person is alone so the most logical course of action is to cross "street". Crossing the street and visiting relatives or friends would only waste more time and cause no benefit for the person in the woods.<n><n>### Input 2:<n>A: Baked beans<n><n>### Answer 2:<n>Ans2: A<n><n>### Rationales:<n>We are given the word A and the choices were B, C, D, and E.

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem states that the family recycles 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers. We are given the recycle value for a set number of cans and newspapers: every 12 cans are worth $0.50, and every 5 kilograms of newspapers is worth $1.50.<n><n>To find out how much money the family can earn from recycling cans, we need to divide the total number of cans by the number of cans needed to earn $0.50: 144/12 = 12 sets. Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12.

Choices:  A: dimly lit room B: kitchen C: wall D: table E: birthday cake<n><n>### Response:		<n>Rationales: Candles can only be placed on tabletops, where a candle’s flame will not be close enough to people eating or working. Candles can also not be placed in very dimly lit rooms because the candle can start an accidental fire, which could cause serious injuries or even death. The flame can also potentially start on fire a flammable material, such as a sheet. Also, fire codes do not allow candles to be put in the kitchen, because flammable gases and fumes are prevalent. Therefore, candles should always be placed on an uncluttered, tabletop space where a fire is less likely to start and where people are less likely to accidentally bump into a flame.<n><n>Answer: C<n><n>### Input:"How many cents is 5 dollars minus (221 cents - 113 cents)?”<n><n>### Response<n>  > Rationales: I’ll write a response with my own choice, and then you can try and work from there or try some of your own.

Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12. Therefore, the family would receive $12 in total.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:Society cannot exist without numbers.   They only rise up in what sort of spaces?

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: For every 12 cans you recycle, you receive $0.50, and for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, you receive $1.50. If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem states that the family recycles 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers. We are given the recycle value for a set number of cans and newspapers: every 12 cans are worth $0.50, and every 5 kilograms of newspapers is worth $1.50.<n><n>To find out how much money the family can earn from recycling cans, we need to divide the total number of cans by the number of cans needed to earn $0.50: 144/12 = 12 sets. Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12. Therefore, the family would receive $12 in total.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:The janitor got his pail out of where?

Choices:  A: great B: distinguished C: remarkable D: excellent E: peculiar<n><n>### Response:		<n>Rationales:  A and B are not appropriate options. According to the dictionary, “great” means “extremely large, or better than large; eminent”, and “distinguished” means “noteworthy; well known or famous”. These definitions do not match with the sentence “strong side effects”.<n><n>C and D are similar and both mean “good”. Thus, they are not appropriate choices. If any of these two words appears in the response, the student should explain why he or she chose these words and how his or her answer explains the meaning of the sentence. Additionally, words like “excellent” and “extremely good” are also similar to D. Therefore, it is important to determine the correct spelling.<n><n>Ideas: “The doctor told me about the side effects of the medicine.”, but not “The doctor said what the side effects were.”. These two sentences mean different things.<n><n>### Input : The city council gave $5,000 to each of the four high schools in the city. ____________________________________________________________________<n><n>### Response : _________________________________________________________________<n>Rationales: Choice A is not appropriate because the sentence shows how much money each high school received. The sentence does not include that the council also provides other benefits to each high school.<n><n>Choice B is appropriate because the sentence shows that the money provided should be distributed fairly.<n>

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem states that the family recycles 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers. We are given the recycle value for a set number of cans and newspapers: every 12 cans are worth $0.50, and every 5 kilograms of newspapers is worth $1.50.<n><n>To find out how much money the family can earn from recycling cans, we need to divide the total number of cans by the number of cans needed to earn $0.50: 144/12 = 12 sets.

However, they’ve noticed there’s a lot of competition when deciding what holidays to offer free baked goods. The bakery makes two kinds of bread: 1) loafs of bread for sale, and 2) holiday bread for handing out for free samples.  They have calculated the number of loafs of bread they need to make for each holiday and determined that they have a single baking oven capable of completing ten batches, but the batching process takes the entire duration of a 3-day holiday to make. If they give out more handouts than they can produce in-house, then they’ll need to hire a contractor to create the free samples. That won’t work out unless the bakery can make 63 free samples every holiday. A contractor will cost the bakery $10/sample + $0.15/hour if their holiday is longer than 3 days. What is the largest amount of holiday bread they can produce while ensuring the contractor will not work?<n><n>### Answer:<n>87 bakery bread<n><n><html> <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/hint.css"> @media(min-width:650px){ <n><n><n><n><n><n>

We are given the amount of money these two people have before they spend anything: $100.<n><n>To figure out how much money they have left to spend for lunch, we need to subtract the amount of money they spent on ice cream: 46/50= 5/7 of the ice cream cost.  To figure out how much money these two people have left to spend on lunch, we need the opposite of 5/7 of $25 each: $25 x 5/7 = 6.21.<n><n>To figure the money they have after they spend on ice cream, we add 6.21 with the amount of $100 they had before: $100 + 6.21 = $106.21. <n><n>### Output:$106.20<n>### Problem:$208<n>### Input:$209<n><n>### Problem:How much money do you have left if you give a man $208 and he gives you $44?<n><n>### Demosration:<n><n>### Input:%55<n><n>### Democracy:<n>1.The man has $%.<n>2.

Choices:  A: military base B: opera C: water fountain D: bus stop E: church<n><n>### Response:		E<n><n>### Why:<n>Rationales: A military base is a facility used by soldiers and armed forces. Although there are many military bases, they do not have public access. Therefore, it is impossible for anyone to see people doing jumping jags at a base because people only have access to inside of the bases.<n>Opera is a musical performance in which songs are performed. Just like musical performances, operas are usually held inside closed buildings. Therefore, it is difficult to see someone else do jumping jacks at an opera.<n>A bus stop is a location designated for people who want to wait for buses. Therefore, it is unlikely that people do jumping jags at bus stops because they are usually short trips.<n>A church is a place of worship. Although people often pray at church, they do not do jumping jacks while they pray.<n>In conclusion, the only place that has public access is a water fountain. So people can see someone doing jumping jacs at a water fountain most easily.<n><n>### Input:"Elephants are related to humans."

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem states that the family recycles 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers. We are given the recycle value for a set number of cans and newspapers: every 12 cans are worth $0.50, and every 5 kilograms of newspapers is worth $1.50.<n><n>To find out how much money the family can earn from recycling cans, we need to divide the total number of cans by the number of cans needed to earn $0.50: 144/12 = 12 sets. Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12.

Choices:  A: backery B: ham sandwich C: fridge D: butcher shop E: freezer<n><n>### Response:		C is correct.<n>Rationales: A, B, and E are incorrect because they are about other areas of meat rather than keeping it in general.<n><n>D does not follow because a family is most likely going to visit the butcher shop rather than have one living in their home. Because this is a choice question, the answer needs to be either true or false rather than having specific reasoning.<n><n>### Input :A group of people want to organize into two teams that use their abilities best. Each member is considered a genius and should be placed on a team according to their skills. For example, if you are a mathematician, a painter, or a musician, you would naturally be more fit for a math, art, or music team. However, if you do not consider yourself to be a genius, you could go either way. Each person will be assigned one of the following titles: ____ scientist, ____ historian, ____ poet, ____ writer, ____ artist, ____ musician, ____ mathematician, ____ designer, ____ accountant, ____ teacher, ____ programmer. In addition, the ____ ____ is a person who cannot be placed in teams for one reason or another.<n><n>### Response :The group wants to decide which profession or skill each member has. Rationales: The group needs to be told in which order each person should be added to each team, rather than how they should be added. A math historian is not going to have any abilities for either a math or history team; therefore, they cannot be placed on either team. For the first team, the math teacher can be added first (and would be the only person on the math team), followed by the scientist, designer, programmer, musician, and accountant in that order.<n><n>The historian can then be placed on the next team, followed by the writer, teacher, artist, and poet in that order. This is because the historian would then work perfectly with the writer, poet, and teacher, but none of them could work on the history team. Lastly, the mathematician, artist, and programmer are not placed on any team because there is one less person for the math team, and an artist cannot work on that team.<n><n>### Problem: A team of ten people is being given the job of making one pancake.

The volume is given by V<n><n><n>Rationale: We can do in two ways:<n><n>1. Use area formula, to cover the entire surface of a cylinder with base (diameter)*height (h) we require the area, using the formula:<n><n><img src="./images/example4-1.png"  /><n><n>Using this formula we are able to calculate the area, but if we look at the area that is filled by the cylinder,<n>we need to use <b>π</b> - ratio for area and not for volume.<n><n><img src="/images/pi.png" width=50 ><n><n>Therefore, to calculate the volume, instead of using area formula, we should use <b>π r</b> formula to calculate the volume, where <b>r</b> is the radius and <b>h</b> is the height of the cylinder.

Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12. Therefore, the family would receive $12 in total.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:How can one's views change after learning about science?

We are given the recycle value for a set number of cans and newspapers: every 12 cans are worth $0.50, and every 5 kilograms of newspapers is worth $1.50.<n><n>To find out how much money the family can earn from recycling cans, we need to divide the total number of cans by the number of cans needed to earn $0.50: 144/12 = 12 sets. Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12. Therefore, the family would receive $12 in total.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:There's a lot to reproducing, but it begins and end with new life by giving what?

Below is an instruction that will describe a task. It will ask you to complete the following multiple choice question based on the information it gives you. It will provide you an example for how to answer the question.<n><n>## Input:For every 12 can you recycle, you will earn $0.25, and for every 2 ounces of newspapers, you will earn 50 cents. If you recycle 18 cans and 14 ounces of newspaperm, how much money do you earn<n><n>## Demo: If you are given 18 cans, divide that by 12. You will get 1. The question says for every 12 can, you will earn $.25 dollars. The answer in the textbook reads $0.25 x(1)=$0.25. If given 14 ounes of newspapers, convert that to ounces by division. Convert the ounces to pounds or kilograms by multiplying the number by 16. Subtract 1 to account for the 14 ouns used. If divide the pounds/kilogram to ounces and then multiply whatever you get by $.50. $0.50(14.001= $7.00. Add the two and the answer is $0.25+$7.00= $7.25<n><n>Question:18 cans and then divide that by 16, in ounces x multiply by.25 then by $7.00 because the question asked you to write in.25 when dividing 18 by 12 then.50 because the question asked how much you earned and then add them = $7.25 <n><n>### Demor: Below is an instruction that describe a task.

But first, a class only supports static methods: methods which are associated to the class as a whole, not to any instances of it.<n><n>Answer: CORRECT: an object of type User<n><n>Answer: The User class has more than one method so it’s not an abstract class. If it was an abstract class, the other methods would have to be in inheritance classes. They are methods so it can’t be an abstract class.<n><n>Answer: B<n><n>Answer: B: an object of type Student will be a User as it contains methods inside it.<n><n>### The User class should be declared as an abstract class, but it is declared as a concrete class and contains at least one non-static method. The method inside the class contains the keyword'static', and this keyword will only be allowed if the class is declared as an abstract class. As such, the class is an abstract class, but the programmer has made a typing error. A different type of error was also made: there should be at least one abstract method inside the abstract class.<n><n>### Student has to be an abstract class as it won't allow for instantiation.<n><n>### Rationales:The object type Student has two methods—add(Student) and findName().<n><n>### Rationale:<n>**Rationale:**  The object of type Student will not be an abstract class as there are too many methods inside it.

Choices:  A: study philosophy B: become adult C: ask questions D: further education E: study together<n><n>### Response:		Choice: B<n><n>### Demostration:<n>Rationales:<n>Because of the use of a word, I don't think that this question was correctly answered correctly. To "study philosophy" means to study philosophy, but it also means "to have a personal belief system" and "to do things ethically" and/or "do things based on your belief system". In this question, the word that was asked about was "further education". I think that this question was answered correctly because studying philosophy has nothing to do with furthering ones education.<n><n>Answer: A<n><n>### Input <n>What did the instructor say to me?

When adding 1 and 1 you will get 2. 2 times 1 will not give you 2, but instead it will give you 2. The question did not say that 2 added to 2 would equal two, just that you could not add 1 and 2.

Choices:  A: necklace B: wall outlet fixture C: tool box D: computer E: motorcycle<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Instructions:<n>In the multiple choice task above, what does it mean to "apply appropriate mental strategies?" Why is this important while solving problems?<n><n>The multiple choice task provides a scenario that involves fixing something with a chain ring. This situation requires a problem solving strategy to be applied to arrive at the correct answer. The strategy to be applied in this context is the analysis or decomposition method. Decomposition is a strategy that decomposes a problem into two sub-problem and solve them individually and then combines the solutions to formulate a solution to the original problem. In this task, a chain ring needs to be applied to a certain fixture or item. In other words, the part to be fixed is the fixture or item itself. The problem is to decide what type of fixture or item does the ring need to be fixed on so as to determine the item or fixture to be used in replacing the chain ring.<n><n>### Inputs/Output<n><n>1. Which of these two statements could be applied to the following situation: "The boy wanted to learn about science. There was a science club in the boys' school. If the boy was not a member of the science club, then he could not learn anything about science there."?<n><n>a. If he is not a member of the club, then he cannot learn about science.<n><n>b. If he wants to learn about science, he needs to join the science club.<n><n>c. If the boy is a member of the club then he can join to learn about science.<n>2. Which of these two sentences will correctly complete the statement: "If A then B; if B, then A"?<n><n>a. If A, then A.<n><n>b. Either A or B.<n><n>c. A must be true for B to be true.<n><n>d. Either A or B will be true.<n><n>A and B must be true for A and B to be true. For example, if the boy is not a member of science club, he cannot learn about science either. Both A and B are true for the original statement. Similarly, if the boy is a member but wants to learn science, then he can only learn about science in the science club if he was a member of the science class. The only solution from this situation is for the boy to join the scienve club to learn about science. Hence, option B is the correct answer.

Choices:  A: happen to people B: hurt people C: happen anytime D: happen often E: happen anywhere<n><n>### Response:		The word "happen" in the sentence was used as the participle of the verb "happen" meaning to occur. The correct answer would have the word “happen” in the first-person singular present indicative form and it would be “happen to me,” but the wife was not using the correct tense in the sentence. The first-person singular present form is “I happen” and the second-person singular present form would be “you happen.” It is important to note that the husband could say, “I think that accidents are going to happen as drivers will never be able to avoid an accident since they occur frequently.” In this sentence, the husband would be stating that accidents are going take place soon, and not just a possibility of the occurrence of an accident but rather it is imminent because accidents happen so frequently that most people are prepared to deal with an accident. If the husband said, “accidents happen,” this would suggest that the wife’s anxiety is due to her perception of the increased prevalence of accidents since she has been thinking that accident are taking place a lot recently; “accidents what” is asking why she is having her anxiety or why she has been anxious since there is no need to worry about accidents because they “happen” or there is no reason to worry since it’s not abnormal to have accidents.<n><n><n>

For answer A, books must be the only option.  In the past, many people lived in books, especially when they were young.  Since, he could see clouds from the top of the tower, there must be clouds outside of the window.  For answer B, radio station must be the only option because the clouds that he could see must have passed by so he could not have seen the clouds.  Since, he lived in a tower, he did not have access to a radio station that he could turn on to listen to the weather forecast.  In answer C, the only option that would make sense is city. In answer D, tower must be the only option, and in answer E, a medieval castle must be the only option since neither place would make sense.<n>Answer: Books<n><n>### Your friend is buying a used car, and the price he is offered is a dollar less than its market value.

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem states that the family recycles 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers. We are given the recycle value for a set number of cans and newspapers: every 12 cans are worth $0.50, and every 5 kilograms of newspapers is worth $1.50.<n><n>To find out how much money the family can earn from recycling cans, we need to divide the total number of cans by the number of cans needed to earn $0.50: 144/12 = 12 sets. Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12. Therefore, the family would receive $12 in total.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:What is love when everyone keeps feeling it?

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: For every 12 cans you recycle, you receive $0.50, and for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, you receive $1.50. If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem states that the family recycles 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers. We are given the recycle value for a set number of cans and newspapers: every 12 cans are worth $0.50, and every 5 kilograms of newspapers is worth $1.50.<n><n>To find out how much money the family can earn from recycling cans, we need to divide the total number of cans by the number of cans needed to earn $0.50: 144/12 = 12 sets. Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12. Therefore, the family would receive $12 in total.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:If people are vegetarian, what do they do more of? Choices:  A: believe in god B: sun themselves C: eat hamburgers D: gain wealth E: eat plants<n><n>### Response:		<n>To solve the problem above, we need to know whether people are more likely to be vegetarian or eat a higher number of hamburgers. Considering two different choices at a time, each one (choices A, B, C, D, or E) would either increase the number of vegetarians or increase the number of hamburgurgeons. There will be one choice that increases both hamburgurs and vegetarians. Because of this, we can start by considering two choices at a time to find out which choice applies to both vegetarians and hamburgers and then add a choice between the two found choices.<n><n>The choices we will consider are the ones that increase hamburgers and vegetarians by the same amount. Considering choice A, we can multiply and divide the number of vegetariams chosen by the number of hambudgers chosen: \([3+4+2-4] \times [14-5] = \frac{10}{5}=2\). This means that if the number of people are vegetarians in a specific subgroup, there are 2 more vegeratarians in a particular subset of people who eat a hambger as well. The same would go for choice B. Because the number of vegetariars chosen is 8, there are [0-1] = -1 more people to choose a hamburger than there were before the subsample of vegatarians had been selected. Because the number of people who eat a burger is -1, the number of vegetariants chosen would have to be increased by 1, meaning that there would be 3 more people who are vegetarians, bringing the total to 11 if all vegetarians who chose hamburger. Likewise, if the number of people chosing hamburgers is 4, there would be 2 more vegetarians as before (if no hamburgers were selected then the number of vegetations was 2, now the number would be 3). Therefore, choice B would also work out as if all vegetarians choose hamburgers, the number of vegetarianans would increase by 2 more if they choose hamburgers.<n><n>For B and C to be true, there must be enough people who eat hamburgers to make the number of vegetariasn increase by 2, as in A, but not

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem states that the family recycles 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers. We are given the recycle value for a set number of cans and newspapers: every 12 cans are worth $0.50, and every 5 kilograms of newspapers is worth $1.50.<n><n>To find out how much money the family can earn from recycling cans, we need to divide the total number of cans by the number of cans needed to earn $0.50: 144/12 = 12 sets. Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12. Therefore, the family would receive $12 in total.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:Where would there be a connection to go to another place?

They’ve known how to make tools for a long time, and even the most common birds can out-perform their cousins.<n><n>> *******************************************************************************<n><n>For example, crows have been using tools for at least 10,000 years. In 2000, a researcher in Japan witnessed a crow removing a large stone with a point and using it to reach for food on a shelf. The crow had to put 17 objects onto the stone to remove it from the ground, but he used the point to reach those objects.<n><n>> And crows aren’t the only animals that can use tools. Chimps and elephants both create tools as well, and other mammals like orangutans and octopuses have been found to have similar strategies in certain situations.<n><n>> But birds have taken their tool use one step farther, learning to create and use tools in ways that are different from the way other animals use them. And humans don’t come out on top in all these situations, with these bird brains being able to outsmart humans on several occasions. For instance, researchers at UCLA observed bamboo-coveying birds learning to work together to retrieve food from a trap, using the bamboo stick as a tool. These bamboo birds’ intelligence may have been one reason why scientists from NASA chose them for a study on the best way to deliver food for astronauts.<n><n>> And despite these findings, researchers aren’t quite sure how many of these bird brains can out-perform a human — or even other birds.<n><n>> And while many of these bird brained discoveries may seem like they couldn’t happen to a friend, scientists aren’t exactly sure why — or even if — some bird brains are smarter than others.<n><n>> But it’s clear that some birds have much more sm

Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12. Therefore, the family would receive $12 in total.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:Where does a marmoset not usually go?

It could mean employers don't like her. She needs to work on her application. I assume that she can't even get a call back.<n><n>### Input:-28 \+ 22 =?<n><n>### Solution: -28 + 22 = -5<n><n>### Rationale: Here, we add negative numbers. We only can add negative number when it is in a negative number because they have opposite sign.

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem states that the family recycles 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers. We are given the recycle value for a set number of cans and newspapers: every 12 cans are worth $0.50, and every 5 kilograms of newspapers is worth $1.50.<n><n>To find out how much money the family can earn from recycling cans, we need to divide the total number of cans by the number of cans needed to earn $0.50: 144/12 = 12 sets. Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12. Therefore, the family would receive $12 in total.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:Why would I want to be exercising?

Choices:  A: college dorm B: back pack C: class room D: backpack E: office supply store<n><n>### Response:		College Dorm <n>### Rationales: The problem gives us three possible locations for buying a binder. The answer is based on the description of each location given by its corresponding letter. A college dorm refers to college students who live in a dorm. It should be relatively obvious that college students can buy a binder from the backpacks which are already in the college dorm room. This is because college students have to use a college-provided backpack in order to travel with their belongings.<n><n>The problem states that college students can buy binders from backpacks. The word “backpack” is a synonym for “dorm,” which is the context of the problem. The only location that makes sense to buy a binder is the dorm because you already find backpacks and binders in the same place. Thus, you can buy a binder in the college dorm.<n><n>### Input :Which would be a better way to save money? Spending less money every month or putting aside more money each month? Choices: A: spend less money B : C: put away more money D: spend more money<n><n>### Response : B (putting aside more money)<n><n><n>### Rationals : The problem describes two possibilities of saving money: spend less money each month, or spend the same amount of money and put aside more. A and B are options A and B respectively, with C and D being their respective reverses. Option D—spending more money—is a logical impossibility, as we don’t want to spend more money in order to save. Option A is a bad choice because we want to save money, not spend it. The problem states that we want to keep the spending the same, so putting aside more money is better than spending less money each month. Therefore, the answer should be B, putting away more money.<n><n>### 2

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: For every 12 cans you recycle, you receive $0.50, and for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, you receive $1.50. If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem states that the family recycles 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers. We are given the recycle value for a set number of cans and newspapers: every 12 cans are worth $0.50, and every 5 kilograms of newspapers is worth $1.50.<n><n>To find out how much money the family can earn from recycling cans, we need to divide the total number of cans by the number of cans needed to earn $0.50: 144/12 = 12 sets. Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12. Therefore, the family would receive $12 in total.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:What past time are people engaged in when they are traveling along liquid?

Choices:  A: tiredness B: grogginess C: discomfort D: getting out of bed E: eyes opening<n><n>### Response:		D: getting out of the bed<n><n>### Rationale:<n>The problem states that Bill was awaking. Therefore, he was leaving his/her bedroom. When a human leaves the bedroom, he/ she will automatically make physiological changes. To answer this question, we need to identify the physiological responses to awaking. For example, when an individual becomes awake, he/she will move their hands to make the face out of the face mask which can be a discomfort to the person. Therefore, it is the best answer.<n>

If you recycle 144 can, you will get $6. Additionally, in our city of [New York], the public recycling collection program also collects newspapers that can be recycled and reused<n>The newspaper collection is recycled at different collection bins located around New York. We can recycle over 350,000 pounds of newspapers per day [1].<n><n>In this example, we will describe our two different recycling methods: cans and newspapers.<n><n>Cans are an essential item to be recycled for two reasons: first, the containers can help us keep our food items safe for consumption, secondly, the cans are recycled at  the [Greenpoint Industrial Park]. The cans are then sent to [Steel Recovery Company] where they are recycled for food and beverage packaging. The cans are also recycled outside through the bins where they are recycable.<n><n>On the second recycling option, we will describe the program's contribution to recycling newspapers. The New York Department of Sanitation (DSNY) [2] has multiple collection centers throughout the [city of New York], where residents can take their recyclable items. The DSNY ensures that the materials are reprocessed and used to make items such as paper towels and tissues. The collected newspapers also help to build and repair roads, parks, and school playgrounds throughout NYC.<n><n>[1]: https://www.recyclednyc.com/recycling/newspapers-and-magazines/<n>[2]: https://www.nyc.gov/html/dsny/html/recycling/nyc_recycling_newspapers.shtml<n>

Choices:  A: owner B: foot C: subordinate D: base E: point<n><n>### Response:		A. owner<n><n>### Reason: The branch's head, being the most important authority, would act with authority to whoever is below him.<n><n>As seen in the question, the branch's head is yelling at someone below him, but this someone cannot be his subordinate. This is because the branch's head refers to "the branch is underperforming", suggesting that the branch he is yelling is underperforming itself, whereas "the branch's head is underperforming" would contradict as this position is the one in charge of the branch. Thus, he cannot be both pointing to it and being under it.<n><n>Furthermore, since the branch's head has the authority over a branch, if he points to himself, then he is not the one he is yelling at. This is because his authority is not given to anyone but him, and pointing to someone that is in charge of someone is illogical; this would mean that the person pointed to is the real head, which is against what the scenario states as the real head is yelling at a subordinate.<n><n>### Input<n><n>### Requires: A: One point of 1,000,000 is ____. Choice A: the same as 100,001. B: half of 1 point<n>Choice C: 1/10,000,thousandth of 1 point. D: the same as 0/1,000 point. <n><n>### Result: 0<n><n>### Causes:<n>1. 1,001,000 ÷ 1,00,002 = 100<n>2. 1,010,001 ÷ 100,1 = 1,01<n>3. 1,020,000 ≈ 0.01<n><n>### Reasons:<n>Point of "one" will always have as many digits as the point itself.<n>1,010 and 1,002 both have two digits (1,10), and 1,01 and 1,02 have three digits.<n>1,0200 is one digit.<n><n>1000000 = 1,00 x 10

Choices:  A: death B: coma C: peace D: forgetfulness E: loss of life<n><n>### Response:		James was scared of death.<n><n>### Reason:  The problem states that James was frightened. If something makes someone scared that usually it indicates the presence of some form of evil. If we consider the possible choices: 1. A & C: These don’t seem to apply here. 2. E: Losing life doesn’t equate to the same definition of death i.e. absence/end of life. 3. B: Coma is a temporary reduction of a human's capacity for consciousness. 4. D: This probably makes the most sense. Forgetting to do something you wanted to do usually means there's an absence of life or existence. However, what may make James scared is that this absence of life would have been forever.<n><n>### Input Answer:James felt himself losing air.  His vision began to fade.  He couldn't tell if he was awake or dreaming.  What scared him the most? Choices:  a.  dizziness b. disorientation c. death d. darkness e. panic.<n><n>### Response Answer:c. death<n><n>### Reasons: James is scared of death because he thought he was dying.  The problem states that his vision came into view, suggesting, that he wasn’t dead. We believe James is not dead because if he was dead, his vision wouldn’t be coming into view. <n><n>James’s state of disorientation also would mean he wasn’t dead either as it has been theorised that death is a state of complete conscious awareness.  We have ruled out, blindness, panic, coma, dizziness, and disorientation as James wasn't dead.  James thinks he dies because that’s what’s making him scared. Therefore, the state that scared him most was the state in which he was in, namely, that he died.<n><n>### Reference:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBVY14Dj-Qs<n><n>### Explanation<n>[Answer](https://youtu.be/hxn6Z_w4zG4?t=729){: target="_blank"} (0:55){: target="_self"}<n>

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem states that the family recycles 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers. We are given the recycle value for a set number of cans and newspapers: every 12 cans are worth $0.50, and every 5 kilograms of newspapers is worth $1.50.<n><n>To find out how much money the family can earn from recycling cans, we need to divide the total number of cans by the number of cans needed to earn $0.50: 144/12 = 12 sets. Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12. Therefore, the family would receive $12 in total.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:John was punching and punching at the wall but succeeded only in bloodying his knuckles. This was bad.

On an electrical circuit, all the wires lead to the same destination. The “wire that carries more power” as the analogy suggests the same relationship. This answer choice implies that they would choose to marry. However, they had been dating for a bit, as suggested by the word “different” on “dance.” “Rowing about” suggests a disagreement or disagreement, so this is rejected as an answer choice. Choice E is a question to ask yourself if you don’t know or find another answer.<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>If John and Jane wanted to spend more time with each other, this suggested that it was time to spend more time with them.<n><n>It is more of a choice to marry.

Choices:  A: communication B: suffering C: pain D: laughter E: embarrassment<n><n>### Response:		A.<n><n>### Rationale: To express an emotion we must communicate it to another but if we can’t communicate the emotion then what are we expressing? A) We express other emotions only.  Not what we are feeling. B) We communicate, but don’t express ourselves either way.  If you’re communicating with me, I should be able to understand how you feel or otherwise understand your actions. C) We simply feel emotions and don’t express ourselves.  I can be feeling an emotion without you understanding why. D) There are no emotions felt by humans so we simply express them. If you’re standing in front of a crowd looking like you’ve been hit by a train and not saying a word, they don’t believe you even feel anything unless you communicate the emotion to the group. People won’t understand why you feel this way, but if we can understand the emotion, we can understand the cause and how to react. E) We simply suffer.  No emotional connection to what we are feeling makes us feel the pain, not emotion.  We simply feel pain instead of feeling how we feel when we break our leg.  If we don’t express how we feel or communicate that our leg is broken, people simply don’t understand why we broke our leg.<n><n>- You can't express what you don't feel.  To express how you feel in a situation you must communicate it to others.  If you can't communicate, you aren't expressing your emotions.

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem states that the family recycles 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers. We are given the recycle value for a set number of cans and newspapers: every 12 cans are worth $0.50, and every 5 kilograms of newspapers is worth $1.50.<n><n>To find out how much money the family can earn from recycling cans, we need to divide the total number of cans by the number of cans needed to earn $0.50: 144/12 = 12 sets. Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12.

We can then multiply 1 by itself, and if you keep doing that over and over you'll get 2(2)(2)(2)(2...(2)(2)(= 2^(2 x 2 x 2 x...(2 x 2 x (2 2 2(2 x 2(2))(2))(2)))) which equals 2^33. We get that by putting the 2 on the left side of the inequality, and the parentheses on the right side. All of the parentheses are equal, so, with the 2s and the parentheses you would get the correct response of 2^33, or 8,388,608. 8,384 x 2 = 16,768. The 608 is the remainder of the 2^33 divided by 2. So, 8,389 x 2 = 2,082 x 2 = 4,164 x 2 =...6,560 (and continue to multiply the 2 by the correct number of 2s you see because as the number of 2s goes up, the sum will go up, and you will have to divide the number of 2x2x...(because they should go from left to right).<n><n>### Output:The answer is B, 2 kg.<n><n>### Output For C: The answer is F 20 kg<n><n>### Input :- What is the time it takes to walk a kilometre when you are doing a walk?

How will I be?<n>### Demonstraion:<n>The problem states that the girl will be at the party tomorrow at eight o'clock. To answer this question, we need to determine the meaning of the word "I," which is a pronoun. The girl could be using herself as the subject in the sentence "I will be," but the question "How will I be" suggests that the pronoun is singular. The pronoun "I will be" could only refer to the girl as the person in the sentence. This indicates that the subject would be "girl."<n>The sentence structure states that she will be at the party. If the girl will be at a specific place, the place must be noun. The adverb "tomorrow" states that the girl will not be at the party today, but at a specific time in the future. Since the pronoun "I" is singular and is always used as a subject in a sentence, the singular pronoun "I" must refer to the girl who will be attending the party. Therefore, the best answer to the question would be (A).<n><n>### Input"I want ice. What would you like for drink?" Choices: A: coffee B: tea C: water D: soda<n><n>Rationales: In the sentence the boy, who wants and ice drink, is the subject. The boy must have a drink, so the drink must be a noun. The choices given are not the type of drink asked for, they are not used in the sentence. The ice drink would be a drink with ice that the boy requested, but the boy did not request for tea, water or soda as given in the choices. Therefore, the best choice would be C.<n><n>###Input "I took my dog for a walk, and I ran into my former neighbor who I hadn't seen in a year!" How would I get the dog? Choices: A: on his back B: on the leash C: in a carrier  D: on the floor<n><n>Rationales:(1) The dog is the subject of the entire sentence. <n>(2) The choices given, do not fit with the meaning of the sentence since the walk is about the dog who you ran into a neighborhood not about your neighborhood.

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem states that the family recycles 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers. We are given the recycle value for a set number of cans and newspapers: every 12 cans are worth $0.50, and every 5 kilograms of newspapers is worth $1.50.<n><n>To find out how much money the family can earn from recycling cans, we need to divide the total number of cans by the number of cans needed to earn $0.50: 144/12 = 12 sets. Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12. Therefore, the family would receive $12 in total.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:A common saying, Sam thought, was to go forth, also this.

Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12. Therefore, the family would receive $12 in total.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:Where would you put a handle if you want to bring it with you?

As the leather is made of animal skin, it tends to be of a softer texture making the seat lose elasticity. This factor combined with the amount of time that the average car spent on the road (19,355 miles/year) would cause the leather to deteriorate and decompose. The more the car is used and the longer it lasts, the more the seat will become cracked and discolored.<n><n>### Discussion 2:<n>I had a friend who's mom had a car that was 14 years old, most of the car is in a very good condition considering the longevity of the car, it still looks really well-made.

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem states that the family recycles 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers. We are given the recycle value for a set number of cans and newspapers: every 12 cans are worth $0.50, and every 5 kilograms of newspapers is worth $1.50.<n><n>To find out how much money the family can earn from recycling cans, we need to divide the total number of cans by the number of cans needed to earn $0.50: 144/12 = 12 sets. Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12. Therefore, the family would receive $12 in total.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:Everybody raised a drink and cheered, they were doing what?

We are given the recycle value for a set number of cans and newspapers: every 12 cans are worth $0.50, and every 5 kilograms of newspapers is worth $1.50.<n><n>To find out how much money the family can earn from recycling cans, we need to divide the total number of cans by the number of cans needed to earn $0.50: 144/12 = 12 sets. Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12. Therefore, the family would receive $12 in total.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:Where above your kitchen sink could you store canned food?

Choices:  A: scotland B: europe C: race track D: new jersey E: england<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer: B<n><n>### Explanation:Scotland<n>Scotland’s M8 and M9 are major motorways, and the M6 and M74 are highways. However, Scotland does not use the term ‘motorway’; they do have motorways but their name for them is ‘dualled’ or ‘trunk’ road and not ‘motorway,’ which is mostly used on the European continent.<n><n>Europe<n>Motorways in Europe usually have some form of service area on them where they can be found on maps. They are also labeled with an M as part of their name, such as A34(M). An extensive list is available online: https://motorways-exits.com/<n><n>Race tracks<n>European race tracks in the F1, DTM or WTCC series have names that often end in a road (such as Mugello, Hockenheim and Zandvoort). However, they do not usually have motorway status unless they also host rallies, such as the Mugello Rally.<n><n>New Jersey<n>New Jersey has no motorways and instead uses the term ‘expressway’. NJ does have highway exits marked with an EP, but they are mostly on US highways and do not have a status above the interstate freeway system.<n><n>England<n>England uses the term ‘motorways,’ but this designation began in 1959 and many major roads in England were not constructed at this time. So, those roads may not be called motorways.<n>

You "mingle," to put it simplistically, by speaking to several different individuals, but the conversations you have with those people you do not have a close relationship with. You converse about current events and other common, casual topics. Small talk can be a means of meeting someone new with whom you forge a friendship.

He wanted to give her a chance to go to college, but he just didn’t have the resources available to do so. He thought and thought what he could do to make enough money to send Mary to college. After all, he didn’t believe that the schooling she had received in an eight hour classroom should dictate her future life.<n><n>Finally one evening, Mary told George of an opportunity she had discovered for him to make some money. There was a business that was being offered to investors, which, if worked properly, would turn thousands into millions over a span of just a few years. The company worked on a plan to gather people’s unwanted trash, particularly appliances, old electronic equipment, and used household items. They then would put those items into the waste stream so that the junk could be deposited in the oceans by ocean-going vessels. This was their business proposition. Mary had taken her old computers that were obsolete when she had replaced them with better technologies, and she had donated them to the company for free. One day her house was visited by a group of strange men who helped remove the computers, and a few days later, the computers were not in her house anymore.<n><n>George was hesitant to make the investment in the company. After all, it was an idea that someone else had thought up to make a large profit off the sale of garbage. After discussing the situation with Mary, George agreed to make a modest investment so that they could participate in the business. He thought of it as throwing something out, and that he wouldn’

Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12. Therefore, the family would receive $12 in total.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:Where can you buy socks and jeans?

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem states that the family recycles 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers. We are given the recycle value for a set number of cans and newspapers: every 12 cans are worth $0.50, and every 5 kilograms of newspapers is worth $1.50.<n><n>To find out how much money the family can earn from recycling cans, we need to divide the total number of cans by the number of cans needed to earn $0.50: 144/12 = 12 sets. Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12.

At these gatherings it is customary that everyone brings a dish that does not need to be heated up, is easy to carry, and serves 10 people or more.<n><n>Rationales: We are told that it is customary that people bring a dish that serves 10 people, is easy to carry and does not need to be reheated. If we make a group of 10 and put the items that are being asked for into the group that will include: Potatoes, canapés, potato salad, and cookie sticks. We only have to find one that doesn't meet those other conditions. Pot and potato salad are great at carrying, but still need to be rehealed before people will actually drink it. Cookie sticks are easy to carry as are canapés, but don't serve 10 people in a group. We end up going with Potato salad as one that can easily transported, does not need to be warmed first and can serve a decent number of guests.<n><n>### Input2:What do you normally do every month, with your recycling?

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: For every 12 cans you recycle, you receive $0.50, and for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, you receive $1.50. If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem states that the family recycles 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers. We are given the recycle value for a set number of cans and newspapers: every 12 cans are worth $0.50, and every 5 kilograms of newspapers is worth $1.50.<n><n>To find out how much money the family can earn from recycling cans, we need to divide the total number of cans by the number of cans needed to earn $0.50: 144/12 = 12 sets. Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12. Therefore, the family would receive $12 in total.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:John spent too much money buying products for his swollen testicles.  He did so because he was feeling what?

Choices:  A: conference B: theater C: building D: floor E: church<n><n>### Response:		<n>Input: The question states that there are a lot of chairs:  a lot refers to the idea that there are a lot, or many things. We can think of this as “a whole group,” which includes all of the chairs in the room. We can then look in an English dictionary to find a word that describes all of the chairs:<n><n>“Room” in the dictionary defines “a set of buildings or space for work or recreation”:<n><n>Choices: the choices are a, b, d, and e. (A) Conference does not refer to a room, as defined by the dictionary, with many chairs. (B) Theater refers to a room with seats facing the same way, as defined by the question. However, there are not a “lot of chairs,” and there is not a “set of buildings or space” for work or recreation. Choice (C) building refers to many buildings, rather than many chairs. (D) Floor refers to the ground level of many stories’ worth of structures. Thus, the ground floor might be one floor among the floors of many buildings, but not 1 floor with many chairs. Finally, choice (E) church is a location for a religious service, which is not what the question requires us to find.<n>Answer: (D) Floor<n><n>---<n><n><n>### Input<n>Input: There are three choices when trying to reach someone on the phone:  A: no service B: caller ID C: ring back D: redial<n><n><n>### Response<n>Input: The question asks us to choose a method when trying to reach someone by phone. The choices are for possible mistakes people make when trying to call other individuals.<n><n>(A) No Service refers to the caller not being able to reach the phone number; this is most likely caused by an outage with the telephone line or the cellphone network. <n>(B) Caller ID refers to having the recipient of the call view the individual's name, rather than just an unidentified caller. <n>(C) Ring back refers to having the phone ring; this is different from having no service. <n>(D) Redial refers to the individual dialing the phone number again to try to reach the person.<n><n><n><n>---<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following questions about the passage.<n><n>### Note

When you feel guilty, it means that you did something bad. If you did something bad, there is a good chance that it was harmful to people or property.<n><n>To identify the person or the object that was damaged, try to ask whoever damaged the window a question: Did you break the window? <n><n>If the answer is "no", then we can eliminate choices B: curtains, C: space shuttles, and E: classroom.<n><n>If the answer to the question above was "yes", then we need to determine what was damaged. To figure it out, try to ask a question about the object that John damaged the window: Do you feel guilty for breaking the window?<n><n>If the object that John damages is a friend's house, then John will answer "yes" to the second question. If the object that John damaging isn't a friend's house but a window, then John will answer no to the second question.<n><n>Therefore, John did not damage the classroom because he says "no." John broke the curtains because the curtains were damaged, and John felt guilty.<n><n>We can conclude that the person that John damaged is the curtains.<n><n>Answer: John broke the curtain.<n>

If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?<n>Rationales: The problem states that the family recycles 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers. We are given the recycle value for a set number of cans and newspapers: every 12 cans are worth $0.50, and every 5 kilograms of newspapers is worth $1.50.<n><n>To find out how much money the family can earn from recycling cans, we need to divide the total number of cans by the number of cans needed to earn $0.50: 144/12 = 12 sets. Then multiply the sets of cans by the value of each set: $0.50 x 12 = $6.<n><n>Applying the same steps to the newspapers, we divide the total weight of the newspapers by the weight needed to earn $1.50: 20/5 = 4 sets. Then multiply the sets of newspapers by the value of each set: $1.50 x 4 = $6.<n><n>Finally, we add the values earned from cans and newspapers together: $6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12. Therefore, the family would receive $12 in total.<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:What are adult people usually expected to do?

An effective solution is one that solves the problem or completes the task entirely. As an example, we ask the student to complete a sentence that describes their favorite school subject. This would be an effective solution because it has completed the task of describing a student's favorite subject.<n><n>An efficient solution would solve the problem in part, or achieve only partial success at the task.

Choices:  A: builders B: driver C: architect D: fall down E: tradesmen<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>### Explanation:The term tradesman refers to a master craftsman who completes a task or trade. In contrast, a builder, an architect, or a driver are not master craftsmen in those professions, so they do not fit in the answer. <n><n>### Examples:<n>If an artist paints a picture, we call it a painting. However, if the artist creates a building, we do not call it a painting. An architect and a builder do similar work with architecture because they both work with plans and blueprints and design buildings. In this case, the term "architect" is a better word to use than "builder." <n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question:<n>Explanation:We use the term driver because a driver is the person who operates and manages any type of machinery. Drivers must have licenses to drive most vehicles, like cars or boats. <n><n>## Problem Solving<n><n>### Exercise One<n><n>### Instructor:<n>Sally's mother is three weeks older than her oldest son, James, and seventeen weeks older than James's little brother, Michael.

We also understand that the bike has a minimum amount of $45 and a maximum amount of $60. Therefore, the estimated cost (range) for the bike repairs is:<n>$$45\leq cost \leq 60$$<n>Which is $45 - $60 = $ 15  (the middle of the price) and so there are 4 choices with $15.

Brad ordered eggs, toasts, and something to drink." (this is the instruction). This means that Brad is going to order something to drink. The options provided in the question are A, B, C, D, and E. The options all start with an article, in this case a, which means that the first letter of each of the options must be the option.<n><n>If we examine the options carefully, it can be observed that they are all food items. However, none of them are what Brad may really have had to drink. Based on this, we can conclude that the options are A: coffee, B: throw up, C: food, D: getting drunk, and E: wine.<n><n>Since A, B, and C are foods, they are incorrect according to the information provided. D can be ruled out because it involves getting drunk, which would not be an option that a person would usually do for breakfast (however, I cannot guarantee my conclusion for this part). This leaves one option left - E.

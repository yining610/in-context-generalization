This is not because the national cake is divided or shared among the people in a democracy but the fact that the national cake belongs to everybody. So it is only right that everybody should benefit from it. This is why we have a democratic government where all the people participate in the administration of their government through their elected representatives. As such, everybody contributes a share of the national crop towards the upkeep of the government. And that's why the government takes an incremental approach towards tax assessment on every taxpaying citizen.<n><n>

The animals on the farm represent the various social classes in society, and the experiment is a metaphor for the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the failed establishment of the Soviet Union. The pig, Old Major, who died soon after the animals took over the farm from their human owners, embodies the leadership role and moral authority of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. In the end, however, the animals realize that Snowball, who they think is the pig Napoleon, is not as cruel as he seems, and they eventually overthrow Napoleon. Snowball is executed by Napoleon's dogs, which represent the Soviet secret police, the NKVD/KGB. The animal Napoleon resembles Joseph Stalin because the Soviet leader is also killed by hs secret police, and Stalin ruled until his death in 1953.<n>Output: C<n><n>## [1](/questions/26000430/)<n>### Instruction:Answer the question by writing one or more of the following on the line provided.<n><n>* A: $20<n>* B: $125<n><n># [2](/questions/26397192/)<n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple type and choice question.<n><n>###  Choose the correct answer from A B or C<n>###  Input: The difference in ages from Richard and Hurley is20.

Out of the 31 students, 8 had visited only one state, 22 had never visited any states at all, and 1 student has visited 15 states. Find the total number of states visited.<n>Output: 136<n>```<n>> **Solution:**<n><n>This is an interesting question. I would recommend to go through it multiple times.<n>The key to this question is making sure you understand the difference between 50 years from now and 50 years minus 1 from now. Remember, the 40 years from the first age question refers to the person's age after 50 years. So when you plug in the number 128 for the answer it works, but it's incorrect because 128 is 100+28, 100+50.  So instead, you need to enter 120.<n><n>This question is a little more straight forward. However, it's important to note that you need to check if all of the boys read 150 pages of book after reading their books.  The other way to answer this question might be to make an equation like $X= ($150 × pages read)+( $3× leftover money).<n>You can see that, for example, Pablo reads 136 pages, he will still have $1.16 left over in his savings account.<n><n>This question can be a little tricky.

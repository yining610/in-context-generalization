Choices: A: 29  B: 9  C: 27  D: 25<n>Output: 25<n><n><n><n>## Explanation:<n><n>If given two sets of data, you can find the average of the given data. The first data is how many cards each person has, the first question asked given the numbers of cards Janet has, and Brenda has. We were asked to find out how many cards Brenda and Janet have in all.<n><n>So the average is the amount you have divided by the number of objects. Let's say Janet and Brenda have 3 cards, the average is 3 divided by 3, which is 1. So if Mara has how many cards, in order to get 3 cards, 211 is a good number.<n><n>The second question is similar to the first because it has the same format, but the only difference is the input. So the average this time is the way to figure out the total number of cards all of them have.<n><n>Let's call our total number of cards, "answer" and let's call the number of cards Brenda has, "Brenda's cards". Similarly for Janet, it would be Janet's cards. So<n><n><n><n><n><n>The third question is one of my favorites because I can actually follow it. So I'll just copy it and answer it here. I love this question.<n><n><n><n><n>It's a multiple choice question so you just need to remember the answer choices and what the original question was. So the original question was "where will a native lemur could be found? Choices A, B, C, D, and E. So the answer is A because it is the only true answer.<n><n>The last question is very simple question that uses a simple formula. So the answer to the problem is D.<n>

In order to solve the problem, I decided not to put an if loop but instead to give some error message after every input was given. In theory, after giving invalid answer, the error message will stop the program thus my program won't come out. I managed to make the code works although it not exactly how I want it to be because there is still a lot of improvement needed such as to show the error message in the console and to make my program to only print out the answer and the corresponding key.

How many cards do they have in all if Mara has 40 cards less than 150?<n>Output: 211<n><n>Input: Pete walked 5 blocks from his house to the bus garage in Houston.

Choices:<n><n>Output: A: 1<n><n>B: 9<n><n>C: You can't tell from the data!<n><n>D: 14<n><n><n>### Solution<n><n>I was originally stumped and confused on how to solve this problem but after searching the web and reading a few other blog posts I was able to identify the logic required using a series of for loops. <n><n>The input will always consist of three cards in each line. The second card will have the amount of cards that the user has already identified. For example the input "Janet has 9 cards Brenda has 1." The first two cards represents the total amount of cards that the second user has, 15 and 9 respectively. <n><n>Therefore given there are 3 lines of input we have 3 values representing the total and number of cards. <n><n>Increment the total value by 1 and continue with the first line of input. <n><n>Repeat this process 2 more times for a total of three lines. <n><n>The first three cards are only relevant to the third user, Mara. The third user has no concept of the first two users card counts. <n><n>The second user, Brenda will have two cards, therefore her card count is 2. <n><n>The third user Mara has three cards, so Mara has a total of 2 + 1 = 3 cards. <n><n>There are 24 total cards and Brenda can't give a specific card number unless she knows the card number and she has no concept of the rest of the card counts. She can only give an approximation of the total number of cards. She can make an approximation of the card counts by doing: <n><n>50/3 = 16.67<n>There are 16 sets of 3 cards for a total of 48. Brenda knows which 3 are her cards and that is a total of 41 cards giving her a total of 49 cards. <n><n>This leaves us with 24 cards. 24 + 2 = 26 cards. The last two cards are Brenda and Mara's card. <n><n>The solution is to take the sum of the users card, 2 and 4 which gives us 6. 6

The time required to communicate slowed their what? Choices:  A: static B: train of thought. C: progress D: transfer of information E: collaboration<n>Output:		C<n><n>*This problem cannot be solved using recursion because recursion needs an initial calling condition(x = 7) to use recursion. However, this problem is divisible by recursion so we just need to figure out how many times to use recursion. We can use recursion to get the total number of items, but that doesn't give us the input. *<n><n>Input: John's 2nd number is 19 of the 5, 5, 27 sequence.  His 4th number is 15 of the sequence. What is his 6th number? <n><n>Output:24<n><n>Input:John's 3rd and 4th numbers are 4 and six of the 5,5,27 sequence.

He wants to know what's his 15th number. <n><n>Output: 31 (Notice its 15th number and 5th number)<n><n>The first number of the the sequence is always 1.  So anytime a number is referred to as "1n", we know it doesn't start at 1 and it adds 1. Also, it's 0 for the first number. So, it looks like this:1n (this number is our target number) = (n/(n-1) +1). This can also be calculated via Newton's method:((2n +1)/n) - 1.<n>Also, we will find the first 10 numbers of the sequence: <n>1st number = 1<n>2nd number = 2<n>3rd number = 3<n>4th number = 4<n>5th number = 5<n>6th number = 6<n>7th number = 7<n>8th number = 8<n>9th number = 8.5<n>10th number = 9<n>We just need to get the 15th number which is 1/2 of 28 + 1.  So: 15 = 28/2 + 1 = 14<n>This formula doesn't hold for the 25th number since 25 = 25/2 +1.<n><n>

What is the time at the U.S.–Canada border (i.e. when people on both sides of the border have the exact same time)?<n>output: 3:00<n><n>The U.S. West Coast Time (UCT) and North American Central (NAC) time zones intersect at some point. We know that people in California can talk to people in Minnesota, and people in British Columbia can talk to people in Montana. So 4pm California time would map to 6pm UCT, 4pm in New York maps to 6pm NAC, and 6pm UCT maps to 8pm in Montana. As long as its not between 6pm and 8pm, people in Montana can talk to people in British Columbia, which means Montanas time must map to NAC at midnight. 9pm in California maps to midnight UCT. People can talk to people in the Mountain time zone any time that their times are within two hours of each other, so Californian times 3pm and 7pm maps to 1

Because `b` is not 10, `p1 = 8` and `p2 = false` are true.<n><n>`p1` and `y` both evaluate to false, as `b` is not even close to being evenly divisible by 23.

However, we do recognize that a `function` is a way to create values of given type using a set of instructions. So, in this case, it should be apparent that the call to `a.function1(p1)` is an attempt to create a value of type `boolean`. But how does the function know what `p1` refers to? It is the job of the `parameter-name` to tell it what to do. In this case, `parameter-name` is `p1` and the value passed in to the function is `undefined`, which is, of course, of no type at all.<n><n><a id="multiple-choice-06"></a> <n>---<n><n>## Multiple Choice Practice Session<n>#### 1.<n>Multiple choice practice session for JavaScript Programming questions. <n><n>  This program counts down from 10 to 1.

What percent of these kids are more likely to prefer reading to watching TV? Choices: A. 38% B. 29% Choices: C.41% D.28%<n>Output: 41%<n><n>### Step-1:<n>The only way to solve the first question is using the PEMDAS rules as there is only one question and there is only one operation you will need to solve this problem.<n><n>PEMDAS order of operations : Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction.<n><n>Step-2:<n>The only way of solving the second question is using the order of operations. We must consider the exponents first and then the multiplication, addition, multiplication and so on.<n><n>Step-3:<n>We first need to formulate our problem as an equation and then find the answer 41% as it is the only answer which uses all of the facts in the problem. We first look for the fact that 80% of the kids like TV and there are 62% who liked reading. However we don't use that fact. Instead, we use the fact that 8% of those who prefer TV over reading and those who prefer reading over TV. Finally, the answer comes as 41%.<n><n>Step-4:<n>The only way is to write the question as an equation and then apply the order of operations to arrive at the final answer.<n><n>Step-5:<n>The only answer for this question is 0.5 because there is no difference between the cards Janet has and the cards brenda has. Hence, when we multiply both 9 and 2 the value does not change as their sum remains the same.<n>

Explain your reasoning both in general and for the case of the set {x | x is positive}.<n><n>### Problem23<n><n>Suppose we are working in a language where variables are not introduced in lexical scope until they are explicitly declared. We could introduce each variable in the body of at least one function. An alternative would be to introduce each variable in the function where it is first used. Explain the pros and cons of either choice. For example, suppose the following:<n>```C<n>char *get_name()<n>void show_info(int n_days, char *name)<n>```<n>The user can enter a positive number of days on the command line and then can pass that integer to the `show_info` function. When `show_info` receives a zero or less as a parameter, it returns the null pointer. Show the call in a program to return the null pointer when `n_days = 0`.<n>

Choices:  A: weak B: fragile C: forceless D: regular E: flimsy<n>Output:		Fragile is the answer we choose.<n>   <n>### Multiple Choice Solution:<n><n>    Input: Janet has 21 cards more than Brenda. Mara has twice as  many cards as Janet.  In order  to subtract and remove the variables the question needs to be rearranged. Janet does Janet - Brenda = number_of_cards.  Number of cards = { Janet - Brenda } -  Mara.   Mara has twice that number of cards which would be { 40 x 2 } = 80.  To find out how many cards Mara has subtract 150 from { 40 x  2 } = 88 cards = 80.<n>      In order to find a combined total we need to find the difference between  the two largest numbers or the difference of the two differences. 211 =  Janet -  Brenda - Mara <n><n>    Input: Pete walked  (10 - 10) blocks from his house to  the bus garage in  Houston.  He   rode the bus  100 blocks to the post  office to get some stumps.  Later, he came home  the  same way. How many  blocks  did  Pete travel in all?<n>      This question is almost the same as the prior one. Since the answer is the same as prior we will simply find the difference between the numbers we get from either prior or here<n>      blocks traveled = (20 - 10 )*(100 - 100) = 200.<n><n>    Input: Glass that hasn't  been treated to be extra  strong  is what? Choices :  A: weak  B: fragile  C: forceless  D: regular  E: flimsy   <n>  Glass that hasn' weak  flimsy but fragile meaning forceless because it breaks easily.  Strength is relative to the circumstances applied to its resistance to breakage.  If for example a rock is used to break it, and compared to it, it would be weak.<n>

Putting this extra card in the collection of the remaining 211. So answer of the question is 211.

Choices:  A: alabama B: louisiana C: south carolina D: arkansas E: mountains<n>Output:		A<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>#### Solution :<n><n>## Description<n><n>The first input will be two integer numbers. You have to count the number of cards a player have.<n>Counting the number of cards, your program output should be `211`.<n><n>Explanation:<n><n>We have `Brenda` and `Janet`. There `Janet` has 9 cards more. So `Janet` has `10` cards more than `Brenda`.<n><n>So total cards are `0`, because Brenda have `0`, `1` card as `Janet` have `10`.<n><n>Our output should be `2`. `Mara have twice as many cards as` `Janet`, So she have some extra cards than `Janet` have.<n>So after deducting from `0`, we get `150` and that means Janet have `150` card in all(9 more than Brenda).<n><n>So total cards of them are `150 + 150 = 210`.<n><n>Now `210` is not the right output.<n><n>After that `Janet` deduct again `9` cards because she have `10`. So she have now `91cards.<n><n><n>Next our input would be:<n><n>`Pete walked 5 blocks.`<n><n>Now he have walked `5` blocks from his house to bus garage in Houston(where he took bus). He has `20 blocks` at the bus station to get stamps. So he travelled `25 blocks.<n><n>`Now he came back 25 blocks.`<n><n>So he travelled `50 blocks in all.`<n><n>Finally our input would be: `If one sees a foox and is standing in a costal, gulf state `<n><n>And our choice should be: `A`<n><n>We just asked two input only, But our program works for other inputs also.  <n><n>If our program can get other input than `210` or `50` it should say `I can't solve this.` or `I do not understand`  <n>In the future we should fix this issue.<n>

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Janet has 9 cards more than Brenda. Mara has twice as many cards as Janet. How many cards do they have in all if Mara has 40 cards less than 150?<n>Output: 211<n><n>Input: Pete walked 5 blocks from his house to the bus garage in Houston.

Choices:  A: meadow B: cupboard C: shed D: mail box E: cellar<n>Output:		A<n><n>### Solution to the third problem<n><n>We start by assuming $91\geq 50$, which is a reasonable assumption. If we let $A=91-x$, then $A\geq 50$.<n>So $9\times A\geq9\times50=450$.<n>Therefore $A >= 80$, and thus $91\geq80+x\geq80+80=160$.<n>Thus the final answer is $160$.<n><n>### Solution for the question on bus travels<n><n>We start by knowing that he walked from A to B, and then rode from B to C. To come up with the total distance walked by Pete, we need to know the distance between the two points. Using the Google maps measurement tool, we have the following:<n><n>A: Texas Roadhouse, Houston, TX<n>B: Memorial Park, Houston, TX (46.3 mi)<n>C: Texas Roadhouse, Pearland, TX (11.1 mi)<n><n>Thus the total distance between his house and the post office is 58 miles.<n><n>### Solution from the quiz question on fear of spiders <n><n>We are given the choice A. Thus, our assumption is that meadow does not cause fear in spiders. From there we can choose any two of the other choices, since a spider won't go to either of those places. Thus<n><n>$C\cap B=\emptyset$<n><n>This means that $B$ is on the diagonal of the grid. Once we know that, the answer is simple:<n><n>$A\cap B=\emptyset=\emptyset\cup B$<n><n>So the answer is definitely A.

The bus fare was $37.50 and the plane fare was $142.50 less than the bus fare. The buses leave every half hour and the flights leave every hour. The buses arrive every 15 minutes, and the plane arrived every 120 minutes. If there were an 8:15 PM bus, at what time did it leave Portland?<n>Output: 9:21 PM<n><n>Explanation: Felipe has been deciding if the plane would be cheaper or not. The plane fare is $120, so 120 - 37.50 = 82.50.<n>The bus leaves every 30 minutes and the plane leaves every hour, so the buses arrive in 45 minutes. The buses arrive at 15 minute intervals, so the bus arrives 45/4 minutes before the plane arrives. The plane arrives every 120, so after 30/3 minutes, the plane has arrived for a total of 123/3 minutes. Felipe arrives every 15 3 minutes, because the plane leaves once every hour, but the bus leaves every half hour, so divide 15 by 2 to get 7.5 minutes. Felipe is at the Portland departure counter at 9:21.<n><n><n>### Input: You've just bought a new car for $16,025. Your interest rate is 11% and you make monthly payments.

How old is your grandmother now?<n>Problem 7 (Chapter 9.121 Fractals). <n>Each integer x greater than 0 is represented as x/y,  where the base value y is equal to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the integers x and x-1.  This value remains constant for consecutive values of integers.  The fractal generated by using positive and zero values of x is called a Koch Curve. You are given x0,  (the start value) and x1, (the value after x0 has been consumed).  The GCD of  x0 and x1 is called xgcd.  Given these two values, compute the value x2 and then x3.

How many cards do they have in all if Mara has 40 cards less than 150?<n>Output: 211<n><n>Input: Pete walked 5 blocks from his house to the bus garage in Houston.

Choices:  A: flower garden B: garden center C: pot D: pot E: formal garden<n>Output:		A<n><n><n>## Challenge:<n>The first part of this question asks you to create an if statement that is true if the first condition is true, but false if the second condition is true. The second part of the question is a little more complicated: it asks you to compare two answers and return the one that is greater. This problem is best solved by making sure our conditions and comparisons are in the correct order.<n><n><n>## Solution:<n>In  order to solve the above problem you will need to use the relational operators. You can only use these on logical conditions. In programming the greater operator returns the first result that is greater and is represented by  >. The less than operator < returns the first result that it is less and is represented by <=. Now we have that in essence we need to choose what to execute based on a first condition and a second condition. That is we have if, elif, elif and finally else. You want first the if and then the elif's based on the logic.<n><n>Here is a example:<n>Input: Pete went 10 blocks from his house to a cafe. He went 4 blocks from the cafe to a park. How many blocks did he go in all?<n><n>Output:18<n><n>    if (blocks walked == 10): # first condition<n>        print("You walked 10")<n>        blocks walked = "10"<n>    elif(blocks walked > 10):# second condition greater <n>        print("You  walked 18")<n>        blocks walked == "18"<n>    else:<n>        print("you walked 10") # third condition not true<n>        blocks walked = blocks walked<n>

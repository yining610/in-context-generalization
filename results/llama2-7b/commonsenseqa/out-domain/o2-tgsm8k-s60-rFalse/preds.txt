Choices:  A: bookstore B: house C: race track D: friend's house E: building<n><n>### Response:		<n>The most logical choice for the correct place to sit and watch animals races would be the A. The bookstore would be the best choice because it has to meet the demands of what the book contains. The bookstore also requires the customer's name and birth date on the library card. This requirement is needed to be given permission. It would be an invaluable reference of knowledge to those who want it at any time or place conveniently. It would add more educational value to people who want to do something positive with their time. They do not necessarily have to be at a racetrack to enjoy books and learn something new every day.<n><n>### Additional:<n>The book would be the best place to sit and watch four-legged animal races. This is because, it would allow someone to be near people who want to race with animals and enjoy a good laugh. These animals are fast, but they cannot make any mistakes, or it would take their lives, which would be sad.<n>

Choices:  A: reverse B: backwards C: back and D: back and E: tally back<n><n>### Response:		Reverse <n><n>### Explanation:I chose "Reverse" based on the answer choices. The meaning of "Go forth" means to leave a place to go somewhere, in the definition a place would need to be chosen which is in the place where he lives. So it contradicts the input where the only destination stated is "to the Post Office" which is not in the place where he lived. So going forth can not be applied. Thus reverse is correct. <n><n><n>### Input:"Goes without saying" means?

When you are traveling through a rural area, it's very hard to be informed especially if you are new in the place. You will be able to know which highway you are taking or which highway you are supposed to take because the roads are different in different states and you can always refer to the high way or road number that the road is to be sure you are headed to the right direction.<n>You can also use the maps to get directions on how to move or get somewhere. They come in handy when you want to be informed about the roads and where to go<n>

Mara has twice as many cards as Janet. How many cards do they have in all if Mara has 40 cards less than 150?<n>Answer: 211<n><n>Input: Pete walked 5 blocks from his house to the bus garage in Houston.

Choices:  A: rain forest B: research laboratory C: cage D: treetops E: south africa<n><n>### Response:		<n>- There are many explanations that I could go about writing the algorithm for the task, but the one that comes to mind first is this methodology. The methodology is to take inputs, and evaluate if each input satisfies the condition of the request. In this case it is to give the number of cards they have all together, therefore I would have to count the cards. My pseudocode for this would be like this:<n><n>	<n>	public void Main() {<n>		<n>		int mainAnswer = 0;<n>		int cards1 = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());<n>		int cards2 = int.Parse(cards1);<n>		while(cards2 > 0){<n>			int cards3 = int.Parse( Console.ReadLine());<n>            cards2 -= cards3;	<n>        }<n>		mainAnswer = cards2;<n>		Console.WriteLine(mainAnswer);<n>		}<n>	<n>- The above program gives me an idea what I'll want to do, and it can be a bit more verbose if I am inclined to do so. The main idea is to take the first card number as the base number to count from. This can easily be calculated by the formula of (1 * base number) + how many cards they add to it.<n><n>	<n>	input cards1 = 9<n>	input cards2 = 9<n>	<n>	input1 = 2<n>	output = 11<n>	<n>	Therefore the card number that I will continue to do operations on will be 9. In order to find the cards in total, I have to make the initial amount of cards + the subsequent cards (after the first card). If I add those two values together then subtract 1, then I am getting the total.<n>	- The above program is very simple, but I also want to look at the program in a way where I can make calculations for multiple inputs all at once so I can avoid doing the same thing over and over again.<n><n>* To calculate the cards I would do the following:<n><n>	<n><n>

[1,28]<n>```<n><n>### Notes:<n>If you have a hard time with this lesson, take a look at JavaScript Array methods to get some inspiration. We will be using Array methods when we get to this section, so it helps to already be familiar with them. The Array method is `join()` and it joins every element in an array into a string.<n><n>The easiest way to do this is by writing a variable to each element in an array. Then use `join()` and `concat()` to get everything.<n><n>The hardest thing about this problem is that this is one of the few problems where the first row is not an indicator for the answer. You will be adding your values to the first row of your array but you won't be using the resulting array. If you're still tripped up, try to use a loop to add your values to the first array and print that array and see what you get.<n><n><n>### Notes for the Exercise Creator:<n><n>This task expects that the user has seen some array methods like `join()` and `slice()`.<n><n>

How many blocks does he have to walk to go _15_ blocks in _all_?<n><n>Input: Janet and Brenda have ___ cards between them_. (Enter a number.)<n><n>### Response<n><n>* *I think you got your numbers mixed up here. I believe that what you meant was, Janet _has_ 9 cards while Brenna has _fewer_ than her. Then, Mara has _two_ as many cards as Brenda, while having _more_ than Janet. Brenda and her partner together have a total of 211 cards while Mara and Janet together have a sum of 331 cards. It isn't that Brenda and Mara together combined have 211 cards, though, rather, they add up to a total of 522. If you have trouble solving the math, I will help you again here, as if you have trouble, I do as well. Here we go. Mara has 49 cards. Janet has 93. Together, Mara and Janet's 6 93 is 211, and Brenda has another nine-thirty, leaving you with (211+69)-93=331. If you have trouble again, give me a shout, and I will do it for you again, but only once more.<n><n>### Input<n>Input: _______ the way he comes.<n><n>### Response

Choices:  A: restaurant B: basement C: all buildings D: carpet E: synagogue<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is synagogue. Synagogue is a religious institution that is used for worship and community activities in Judaism. According to the Bible, the synagogue replaced the Temple in Jerusalem as a site for worship. Many synagogues have a sanctuary but are otherwise relatively simple institutions, with limited ritual appointments, such as ark, alter, or synagogue chair, and a bimah, or lectern. Synagogue chairs are usually arranged in a row. Some synagogues are adorned with elaborate gold-leaf chandeliers or woodcarvings. Chandeliers are a late addition, and, like pulpits, a concession to Gentile influence. The synagogue is the site of weekly religious services and of Jewish holidays, festivals, and lifecycle events (births, life-cycle events, deaths). The synagogue was also the center of Jewish communal life in medieval times, where Jews studied Torah and rabbinic literature, met with visitors and local government officials, helped new immigrants establish themselves in their new home, and offered charity to those in need. In the 19th and 20th centuries, synagogues moved outside the ghettos and were often the first building on streets where other private residences and businesses were located. Today, all Jewish people may pray at any synagogue across the world.

The more often you sun yourself, the taller you grow. Eating plants is a matter of choice, as is eating hamburgers. Gaining wealth is often more of an option if one chooses to believe in god. However, what causes people to "do more of believing in god" is the fact that they're vegetarian---so E makes sense.<n>

Mara has twice as many cards as Janet. How many cards do they have in all if Mara has 40 cards less than 150?<n>Answer: 211<n><n>Input: Pete walked 5 blocks from his house to the bus garage in Houston. He rode the bus 20 blocks to the post office to get some stamps. Later, he came home the same way. How many blocks did Pete travel in all?<n>Answer: 50<n><n>### Input:What feeling might propel one to instituting civil action? Choices:  A: complications B: tiredness C: anger D: trial E: court case<n><n>### Response:		(C) anger<n><n>### Rationale: There are a lot of people who might decide to make some sort of civil action based on the fact that they get tired of feeling compliant. However, anger would probably be the reason most people take action against oppression, particularly if the government has a history of abusing it's citizens and refusing to acknowledge it. The last two sentences of the question give away that the author was thinking about a legal action, not a violent action, which is still anger. Additionally, the question is framed so that civil action is a bad thing, which is another indication of anger over not being able to do anything to stop the injustice.<n><n>### Input:(Water is flowing at the rate of 6.5 cubic feet per minute into a tunnel and is flowing through the tunnel at the water. The length of the tunnel is 750 meters. What is the discharge rate of the water through the tunnel if the cross sectional flow area of the tunnel for drainage is 0.0650 meters by 885 meters? What is the volume flow rate through the tunnel?<n><n>### Response:(C) 997 cubic meters per minute<n><n>### Rational:I first calculated the volume flow rate according to the formula I learned: V=(C)(A)(T) where V=Volume, C=constant, A=cross- sectional area, and T=time. In this case C=6.5/4225 meters which is 2/281 (6.5/4*281/4) meters per second. A=0.065/(885*281) = 0.5235 meters by 281 meters, which is 0.29 cubic yards by 281 yards = 0.00468 cubic yards by 1413 feet (281 yards=1413 feet). In the end, this gives me a volume flow rate of 2200 cubic meters and a volume flow of 2201 cubic meters. While the discrepancy isn't as much as another answer of 321 cubic meters per minute, it is a notable difference that needs to be accounted for.<n><n>### Another Answer:

Choices:  A: art show B: basement C: bar D: church E: basement<n><n>### Response:		Choice(s): E<n><n>### Explain why your choices are correct.<n><n>A wine glass can not be bought at the art show for obvious reasons. If a person wanted to buy a glass of wine, they could go an art show if it has food. Then you could drink a couple glass of wine.  This can not work because a art show won't have a place to serve food so it won't sell good wine. A person will say "Why do you sell wine here?"  A person does not buy wine at a bar because it is only an establishment to serve to serve alcohol to people. You also won't buy it in a church because they serve only holy water because it is against there religion.<n><n>### Review Notes:<n>The art show can serve at most 2 glasses per person when the art show has food. In this case there are 2, it is 20 because each glass will last for 10 minutes at most. <n>1. A bar can serve at most 10 glasses per person when they serve at most 1 glass per minute.<n>2. A basement can serve at most 360 glasses per week because it is 4.5 hours a week.<n>3. A bar can not serve at most 145 glasses.<n>

Write a response the describes how to complete the task<n><n>I understand the question perfectly but the answer is inexperienced.<n>So, <n>- The answer for the first example (1 9 more than Brenda) is 211. Brenda has 211 - 9 = 202 more cards than Janet who has 202 + 9 = 211 cards in total. Mara has 202 - 9 = 193 cards, so 50 less than 202. So 202 +193 = 405. So if Brenda has 202 more than mara she has 405 more than mara.<n>- In order for the second question to be answered correctly you have to understand that we know the distance of the first and the last part of the journey but not the distances of the middle stages. So if the middle stage travels from mara to pete, the total distance must be given by the distance from mara to peters house + the distance from Mara to the PDG. Since we don't know whether pete walks from his house to the garage we don't know the distance of this stage. Since Janet walks 5 blocks more than twice than pete from his house to the PDG, we can tell that the distance pete walks from Mara to the garage is 5 blocks. The last stage is twice as long as the previous one. So the distance of Pete from the garage to his house is twice as long as pete from Mara to the bus and twice as long as pets from his house to Mara, which is 10 blocks. So total travel distance is 5+2+5+10 = 22 blocks.<n>

Mara has twice as many cards as Janet. How many cards do they have in all if Mara has 40 cards less than 150?<n>Answer: 211<n><n>Input: Pete walked 5 blocks from his house to the bus garage in Houston.

How many blocks did Pete travel in all?<n>Answer: 50<n><n>### Input:The camper looked up at the vast night sky, it left him feeling mighty what? Choices:  A: unimportant B: insignificant C: stellar D: somewhat E: helpless<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer:<n>### Explanation:I know for sure that the camper felt insignificant.<n><n>### A: unimportant - Unimportant describes being worthless. <n>The camper was not worthless and therefore, this choice would most likely not the best response, because he obviously was not. He was, in fact, worthy of life and being noticed.<n><n>### B: insignificance - Insignificance is more like a value of worth. <n>However, this person already said that the camper felt unimportant. This is a different type of worthless.<n><n>### C: stellar - This is a word that describes someone who is a star. Since a star, in a sky, is something that radiates and is incredibly important for seeing and navigating, this would not be a good response choice. The camper may, in fact, not even know any other stars besides the sun.<n><n>### D: somewhat - This is somewhat of an odd response. This could be used as a response describing the camper, since this is another phrase for somewhat. However, in this case, this would not be the best response, since he does not seem to be feeling somewhat, but more importantly, he may feel unimportant by his own definition.<n><n>### E:  helpless - This is a word to describe a person who is unable to do something. The camper is able to walk, talk, and see. He may be able to see the night sky more easily than we are able to as he is looking at the night sky, which makes this not the best response.<n>

Turkey was by no means the universal Thanksgiving centerpiece. Venison was more common, because turkeys were extremely scarce in the colonial era. Even as late as 1840, half of the turkeys were actually smuggled out of Canada!<n>   <n>   3.   Another fact that most people don't know-this one is pretty darn interesting-is that pumpkin pie is an invention of President John Adams. Adams had the foresight to include it in the first

To be correct, a sentence rewrite must demonstrate understanding of grammar and usage concepts, not just the specific grammar or usage rules that you were taught in this course.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>Say for example that you have a rectangle and a triangle of the same size. Both have the same height and width. If the rectangle is to be turned 90 degrees clockwise it becomes an obtuse triangle. A triangle that is turned 90 degrees counterclockwise will become a right triangle.<n><n>### Input/Response:Revise this sentence.

Choices:  A: shopping mall B: hospitals C: populated area D: school E: military base<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>* If we use option A from the choices, it seems that shopping mall is a good place to find an unpaid actor who performs plays. The idea is like this, if you go to a theater in a shopping mall, you can find actors in there playing, but, probably paid. As you can see on option C, D, E there is no such place that you can find actors without paying. So, that is why we can say that shopping mall can be a good place to find unpaid actors since actors would be playing without paying in a theater, but, at shopping mall.<n><n><n>### Input:(Mrs. Thompson) In two different schools, each girl in fourth grade have 5 to 7 times the number of girls in the third grade.

In grade 4, each student there would have 5 to 8 more times that of grade 3 and therefore, 5 to 8 times more students.<n><n><n>## Solution:<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n><n>## Demonstration:	<n><n>* Input: Janet has 32 cards more than Brenda, and Mara has twice as Many as Janet.

Choices: A: 29  B: 9  C: 27  D: 25\nOutput: 25\n\n\n\n## Explanation:\n\nIf given two sets of data, you can find the average of the given data. The first data is how many cards each person has, the first question asked given the numbers of cards Janet has, and Brenda has. We were asked to find out how many cards Brenda and Janet have in all.\n\nSo the average is the amount you have divided by the number of objects. Let's say Janet and Brenda have 3 cards, the average is 3 divided by 3, which is 1. So if Mara has how many cards, in order to get 3 cards, 211 is a good number.\n\nThe second question is similar to the first because it has the same format, but the only difference is the input. So the average this time is the way to figure out the total number of cards all of them have.\n\nLet's call our total number of cards, \"answer\" and let's call the number of cards Brenda has, \"Brenda's cards\". Similarly for Janet, it would be Janet's cards. So\n\n\n\n\n\nThe third question is one of my favorites because I can actually follow it. So I'll just copy it and answer it here. I love this question.\n\n\n\n\nIt's a multiple choice question so you just need to remember the answer choices and what the original question was. So the original question was \"where will a native lemur could be found? Choices A, B, C, D, and E. So the answer is A because it is the only true answer.\n\nThe last question is very simple question that uses a simple formula. So the answer to the problem is D.", "answer": "E: rain forest"}

{"text": "None of these answers are correct\n\nInput: Which is better, Coffee Mate or Coffee Twist?\nOutput: None of the above\n\n\n### My Solution:\nBecause the statements in the problem are the same except for the last answer, my code will look for the last answer and check whether its equal to 'None' or not.\n\nI thought about putting an if loop that checks if the last answer if equal to 'None' and if it is, to give an 'Invalid Input' which is false, to make my program to come out after giving an invalid input, but it turns out that's not the case as my program still comes out after every question. In order to solve the problem, I decided not to put an if loop but instead to give some error message after every input was given. In theory, after giving invalid answer, the error message will stop the program thus my program won't come out. I managed to make the code works although it not exactly how I want it to be because there is still a lot of improvement needed such as to show the error message in the console and to make my program to only print out the answer and the corresponding key. However, I find problem coding for the 'None of the above' answer but thanks to the help of the teacher, I finally managed to make my code works.\n\nHere is the solution for the above problems:\n\n**Janet has 9 cards moere than Brenda.

Choices:\n\nOutput: A: 1\n\nB: 9\n\nC: You can't tell from the data!\n\nD: 14\n\n\n### Solution\n\nI was originally stumped and confused on how to solve this problem but after searching the web and reading a few other blog posts I was able to identify the logic required using a series of for loops. \n\nThe input will always consist of three cards in each line. The second card will have the amount of cards that the user has already identified. For example the input \"Janet has 9 cards Brenda has 1.\" The first two cards represents the total amount of cards that the second user has, 15 and 9 respectively. \n\nTherefore given there are 3 lines of input we have 3 values representing the total and number of cards. \n\nIncrement the total value by 1 and continue with the first line of input. \n\nRepeat this process 2 more times for a total of three lines. \n\nThe first three cards are only relevant to the third user, Mara. The third user has no concept of the first two users card counts. \n\nThe second user, Brenda will have two cards, therefore her card count is 2. \n\nThe third user Mara has three cards, so Mara has a total of 2 + 1 = 3 cards. \n\nThere are 24 total cards and Brenda can't give a specific card number unless she knows the card number and she has no concept of the rest of the card counts. She can only give an approximation of the total number of cards. She can make an approximation of the card counts by doing: \n\n50/3 = 16.67\nThere are 16 sets of 3 cards for a total of 48. Brenda knows which 3 are her cards and that is a total of 41 cards giving her a total of 49 cards. \n\nThis leaves us with 24 cards. 24 + 2 = 26 cards. The last two cards are Brenda and Mara's card. \n\nThe solution is to take the sum of the users card, 2 and 4 which gives us 6. 6", "answer": "A: cupboard"}

{"text": "C\n\n*This problem cannot be solved using recursion because recursion needs an initial calling condition(x = 7) to use recursion. However, this problem is divisible by recursion so we just need to figure out how many times to use recursion. We can use recursion to get the total number of items, but that doesn't give us the input. *\n\nInput: John's 2nd number is 19 of the 5, 5, 27 sequence.  His 4th number is 15 of the sequence. What is his 6th number? \n\nOutput:24\n\nInput:John's 3rd and 4th numbers are 4 and six of the 5,5,27 sequence.  What is his 6 th number?\nOutput: 47 (Notice its 6th number and 4th number).\n\nInput: John has the 5,5 sequence. He wants to know what's his 15th number. \n\nOutput: 31 (Notice its 15th number and 5th number)\n\nThe first number of the the sequence is always 1.  So anytime a number is referred to as \"1n\", we know it doesn't start at 1 and it adds 1. Also, it's 0 for the first number. So, it looks like this:1n (this number is our target number) = (n/(n-1) +1). This can also be calculated via Newton's method:((2n +1)/n) - 1.\nAlso, we will find the first 10 numbers of the sequence: \n1st number = 1\n2nd number = 2\n3rd number = 3\n4th number = 4\n5th number = 5\n6th number = 6\n7th number = 7\n8th number = 8\n9th number = 8.5\n10th number = 9\nWe just need to get the 15th number which is 1/2 of 28 + 1.

How far did the boy travel from his house?\n Output: 18 miles\n\n---\n\nInstruction:Answer the questions in your own words.\n\n\n###1\n\nBoth `p1 = p2 = p1` are true. However, none of their subexpressions are true. That is, the subexpressions for `p1` is not true when `p2` is true, and vice versa. This tells us that, even though `p1` and `p2` have the same structure, the values of the expressions are different. Because `b` is not 10, `p1 = 8` and `p2 = false` are true.\n\n`p1` and `y` both evaluate to false, as `b` is not even close to being evenly divisible by 23. If `x` were `19`, however, because `b` is then closer to being evenly divisble by 23, `p1` and both `x` and `y` would still evaluate to false.\n<a id=\"multiple-choice-05\"></a> \n\n---\n\n###2\n\nThis problem would have been easier if we had been allowed to see the definitions of the parameters. However, we do recognize that a `function` is a way to create values of given type using a set of instructions. So, in this case, it should be apparent that the call to `a.function1(p1)` is an attempt to create a value of type `boolean`. But how does the function know what `p1` refers to? It is the job of the `parameter-name` to tell it what to do. In this case, `parameter-name` is `p1` and the value passed in to the function is `undefined`, which is, of course, of no type at all.\n\n<a id=\"multiple-choice-06\"></a> \n---\n\n## Multiple Choice Practice Session\n#### 1.\nMultiple choice practice session for JavaScript Programming questions. \n\n  This program counts down from 10 to 1.", "answer": "A: open meadow"}

We must consider the exponents first and then the multiplication, addition, multiplication and so on.\n\nStep-3:\nWe first need to formulate our problem as an equation and then find the answer 41% as it is the only answer which uses all of the facts in the problem. We first look for the fact that 80% of the kids like TV and there are 62% who liked reading. However we don't use that fact. Instead, we use the fact that 8% of those who prefer TV over reading and those who prefer reading over TV. Finally, the answer comes as 41%.\n\nStep-4:\nThe only way is to write the question as an equation and then apply the order of operations to arrive at the final answer.\n\nStep-5:\nThe only answer for this question is 0.5 because there is no difference between the cards Janet has and the cards brenda has.

{"text": "Fragile is the answer we choose.\n   \n### Multiple Choice Solution:\n\n    Input: Janet has 21 cards more than Brenda. Mara has twice as  many cards as Janet.  In order  to subtract and remove the variables the question needs to be rearranged. Janet does Janet - Brenda = number_of_cards.  Number of cards = { Janet - Brenda } -  Mara.   Mara has twice that number of cards which would be { 40 x 2 } = 80.  To find out how many cards Mara has subtract 150 from { 40 x  2 } = 88 cards = 80.\n      In order to find a combined total we need to find the difference between  the two largest numbers or the difference of the two differences. 211 =  Janet -  Brenda - Mara \n\n    Input: Pete walked  (10 - 10) blocks from his house to  the bus garage in  Houston.

{"text": "A\n\n### Solution:\n\n#### Solution :\n\n## Description\n\nThe first input will be two integer numbers. You have to count the number of cards a player have.\nCounting the number of cards, your program output should be `211`.\n\nExplanation:\n\nWe have `Brenda` and `Janet`. There `Janet` has 9 cards more. So `Janet` has `10` cards more than `Brenda`.\n\nSo total cards are `0`, because Brenda have `0`, `1` card as `Janet` have `10`.\n\nOur output should be `2`. `Mara have twice as many cards as` `Janet`, So she have some extra cards than `Janet` have.\nSo after deducting from `0`, we get `150` and that means Janet have `150` card in all(9 more than Brenda).\n\nSo total cards of them are `150 + 150 = 210`.\n\nNow `210` is not the right output.\n\nAfter that `Janet` deduct again `9` cards because she have `10`. So she have now `91cards.\n\n\nNext our input would be:\n\n`Pete walked 5 blocks.`\n\nNow he have walked `5` blocks from his house to bus garage in Houston(where he took bus). He has `20 blocks` at the bus station to get stamps. So he travelled `25 blocks.\n\n`Now he came back 25 blocks.`\n\nSo he travelled `50 blocks in all.`\n\nFinally our input would be: `If one sees a foox and is standing in a costal, gulf state `\n\nAnd our choice should be: `A`\n\nWe just asked two input only, But our program works for other inputs also.  \n\nIf our program can get other input than `210` or `50` it should say `I can't solve this.` or `I do not understand`  \nIn the future we should fix this issue.", "answer": "B: louisiana"}

{"text": "bright\n\nInput: What is the largest whole number less than or equal to 14 that is evenly divisible by 7, 8, 11, and 14?\nOutput: 416\n\nInput: Felipe wants to buy a ticket from Portland to San Diego. The bus fare was $37.50 and the plane fare was $142.50 less than the bus fare. The buses leave every half hour and the flights leave every hour. The buses arrive every 15 minutes, and the plane arrived every 120 minutes. If there were an 8:15 PM bus, at what time did it leave Portland?\nOutput: 9:21 PM\n\nExplanation: Felipe has been deciding if the plane would be cheaper or not. The plane fare is $120, so 120 - 37.50 = 82.50.\nThe bus leaves every 30 minutes and the plane leaves every hour, so the buses arrive in 45 minutes. The buses arrive at 15 minute intervals, so the bus arrives 45/4 minutes before the plane arrives. The plane arrives every 120, so after 30/3 minutes, the plane has arrived for a total of 123/3 minutes. Felipe arrives every 15 3 minutes, because the plane leaves once every hour, but the bus leaves every half hour, so divide 15 by 2 to get 7.5 minutes. Felipe is at the Portland departure counter at 9:21.\n\n\n### Input: You've just bought a new car for $16,025. Your interest rate is 11% and you make monthly payments.

{"text": "A\n\n\n## Challenge:\nThe first part of this question asks you to create an if statement that is true if the first condition is true, but false if the second condition is true. The second part of the question is a little more complicated: it asks you to compare two answers and return the one that is greater. This problem is best solved by making sure our conditions and comparisons are in the correct order.\n\n\n## Solution:\nIn  order to solve the above problem you will need to use the relational operators. You can only use these on logical conditions. In programming the greater operator returns the first result that is greater and is represented by  >. The less than operator < returns the first result that it is less and is represented by <=. Now we have that in essence we need to choose what to execute based on a first condition and a second condition. That is we have if, elif, elif and finally else. You want first the if and then the elif's based on the logic.\n\nHere is a example:\nInput: Pete went 10 blocks from his house to a cafe. He went 4 blocks from the cafe to a park. How many blocks did he go in all?\n\nOutput:18\n\n    if (blocks walked == 10): # first condition\n        print(\"You walked 10\")\n        blocks walked = \"10\"\n    elif(blocks walked > 10):# second condition greater \n        print(\"You  walked 18\")\n        blocks walked == \"18\"\n    else:\n        print(\"you walked 10\") # third condition not true\n        blocks walked = blocks walked", "answer": "E: formal garden"}

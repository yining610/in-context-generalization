{"text": "- There are many explanations that I could go about writing the algorithm for the task, but the one that comes to mind first is this methodology. The methodology is to take inputs, and evaluate if each input satisfies the condition of the request. In this case it is to give the number of cards they have all together, therefore I would have to count the cards. My pseudocode for this would be like this:\n\n\t\n\tpublic void Main() {\n\t\t\n\t\tint mainAnswer = 0;\n\t\tint cards1 = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());\n\t\tint cards2 = int.Parse(cards1);\n\t\twhile(cards2 > 0){\n\t\t\tint cards3 = int.Parse( Console.ReadLine());\n            cards2 -= cards3;\t\n        }\n\t\tmainAnswer = cards2;\n\t\tConsole.WriteLine(mainAnswer);\n\t\t}\n\t\n- The above program gives me an idea what I'll want to do, and it can be a bit more verbose if I am inclined to do so. The main idea is to take the first card number as the base number to count from. This can easily be calculated by the formula of (1 * base number) + how many cards they add to it.\n\n\t\n\tinput cards1 = 9\n\tinput cards2 = 9\n\t\n\tinput1 = 2\n\toutput = 11\n\t\n\tTherefore the card number that I will continue to do operations on will be 9. In order to find the cards in total, I have to make the initial amount of cards + the subsequent cards (after the first card). If I add those two values together then subtract 1, then I am getting the total.\n\t- The above program is very simple, but I also want to look at the program in a way where I can make calculations for multiple inputs all at once so I can avoid doing the same thing over and over again.\n\n* To calculate the cards I would do the following:", "answer": "B: research laboratory"}

We will be using Array methods when we get to this section, so it helps to already be familiar with them. The Array method is `join()` and it joins every element in an array into a string.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is by writing a variable to each element in an array. Then use `join()` and `concat()` to get everything.\n\nThe hardest thing about this problem is that this is one of the few problems where the first row is not an indicator for the answer. You will be adding your values to the first row of your array but you won't be using the resulting array. If you're still tripped up, try to use a loop to add your values to the first array and print that array and see what you get.\n\n\n### Notes for the Exercise Creator:\n\nThis task expects that the user has seen some array methods like `join()` and `slice()`.", "answer": "B: plane"}

How many blocks does he have to walk to go _15_ blocks in _all_?\n\nInput: Janet and Brenda have ___ cards between them_. (Enter a number.)\n\n### Response\n\n* *I think you got your numbers mixed up here. I believe that what you meant was, Janet _has_ 9 cards while Brenna has _fewer_ than her. Then, Mara has _two_ as many cards as Brenda, while having _more_ than Janet. Brenda and her partner together have a total of 211 cards while Mara and Janet together have a sum of 331 cards. It isn't that Brenda and Mara together combined have 211 cards, though, rather, they add up to a total of 522. If you have trouble solving the math, I will help you again here, as if you have trouble, I do as well. Here we go. Mara has 49 cards. Janet has 93. Together, Mara and Janet's 6 93 is 211, and Brenda has another nine-thirty, leaving you with (211+69)-93=331.

{"text": "The correct answer is synagogue. Synagogue is a religious institution that is used for worship and community activities in Judaism. According to the Bible, the synagogue replaced the Temple in Jerusalem as a site for worship. Many synagogues have a sanctuary but are otherwise relatively simple institutions, with limited ritual appointments, such as ark, alter, or synagogue chair, and a bimah, or lectern. Synagogue chairs are usually arranged in a row. Some synagogues are adorned with elaborate gold-leaf chandeliers or woodcarvings. Chandeliers are a late addition, and, like pulpits, a concession to Gentile influence. The synagogue is the site of weekly religious services and of Jewish holidays, festivals, and lifecycle events (births, life-cycle events, deaths). The synagogue was also the center of Jewish communal life in medieval times, where Jews studied Torah and rabbinic literature, met with visitors and local government officials, helped new immigrants establish themselves in their new home, and offered charity to those in need. In the 19th and 20th centuries, synagogues moved outside the ghettos and were often the first building on streets where other private residences and businesses were located. Today, all Jewish people may pray at any synagogue across the world.", "answer": "E: synagogue"}

Use the scenario and rules as the foundation of the argument.\nExamples of the football rule changes may include: \nPaper topic examples:\nThe new head-to-head rule is detrimental to most teams because of the negative impact it has on their confidence.\nPlayers who wear their helmets too much have a higher risk of brain damage and even death.\nFootball players are exposed to too many risks now, and the game can injure a player mentally or physically.\nThe risk of injury should not be considered a fair tradeoff for the rewards of participation in high school football.\nCoaches can help reduce the risk of concussions by enforcing rules and educating players on the game\u2019s rules.\nParents are too much of a distraction from the athletes on the field.\nFootball players should not be able to wear helmets on the field.\n\nAthletes should not wear headphones while competing for the sake of safety.\n- Parents should become more closely involved with their children\u2019s teams to increase the level of cooperation among coaches, parents, and athletes.\n- A team should only allow players back on the lineup if they have not played for an extended period of time.\n- Parents and athletes should not try to make decisions at the last minute, and they should not show up late for games or practices;\n- A coach\u2019s decision is final in most cases that involve injuries; or\n- It is difficult to understand players at the high school level.\n\n- - -", "answer": "C: winning or losing"}

{"text": "(C) anger\n\n### Rationale: There are a lot of people who might decide to make some sort of civil action based on the fact that they get tired of feeling compliant. However, anger would probably be the reason most people take action against oppression, particularly if the government has a history of abusing it's citizens and refusing to acknowledge it. The last two sentences of the question give away that the author was thinking about a legal action, not a violent action, which is still anger. Additionally, the question is framed so that civil action is a bad thing, which is another indication of anger over not being able to do anything to stop the injustice.\n\n### Input:(Water is flowing at the rate of 6.5 cubic feet per minute into a tunnel and is flowing through the tunnel at the water. The length of the tunnel is 750 meters. What is the discharge rate of the water through the tunnel if the cross sectional flow area of the tunnel for drainage is 0.0650 meters by 885 meters? What is the volume flow rate through the tunnel?\n\n### Response:(C) 997 cubic meters per minute\n\n### Rational:I first calculated the volume flow rate according to the formula I learned: V=(C)(A)(T) where V=Volume, C=constant, A=cross- sectional area, and T=time. In this case C=6.5/4225 meters which is 2/281 (6.5/4*281/4) meters per second. A=0.065/(885*281) = 0.5235 meters by 281 meters, which is 0.29 cubic yards by 281 yards = 0.00468 cubic yards by 1413 feet (281 yards=1413 feet). In the end, this gives me a volume flow rate of 2200 cubic meters and a volume flow of 2201 cubic meters. While the discrepancy isn't as much as another answer of 321 cubic meters per minute, it is a notable difference that needs to be accounted for.\n\n### Another Answer:", "answer": "C: anger"}

{"text": "If Brenda has 13 less than Janet and mara has 40 less than 152 what is the total value\n### \n### \n\n<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73487767/the-answer-is-211-below-is-an-instruction-that-describes-a-task-write-a-response>\n> Stack OverFlow | The answer is 211 below is an instruction that describes\na task. Write a response the describes how to complete the task\n\nI understand the question perfectly but the answer is inexperienced.\nSo, \n- The answer for the first example (1 9 more than Brenda) is 211. Brenda has 211 - 9 = 202 more cards than Janet who has 202 + 9 = 211 cards in total. Mara has 202 - 9 = 193 cards, so 50 less than 202. So 202 +193 = 405. So if Brenda has 202 more than mara she has 405 more than mara.\n- In order for the second question to be answered correctly you have to understand that we know the distance of the first and the last part of the journey but not the distances of the middle stages. So if the middle stage travels from mara to pete, the total distance must be given by the distance from mara to peters house + the distance from Mara to the PDG. Since we don't know whether pete walks from his house to the garage we don't know the distance of this stage. Since Janet walks 5 blocks more than twice than pete from his house to the PDG, we can tell that the distance pete walks from Mara to the garage is 5 blocks. The last stage is twice as long as the previous one. So the distance of Pete from the garage to his house is twice as long as pete from Mara to the bus and twice as long as pets from his house to Mara, which is 10 blocks. So total travel distance is 5+2+5+10 = 22 blocks.", "answer": "A: insubstantial"}

But it actually commemorates an annual celebration since 1621, when the Pilgrims began observing a feast of thanksgiving. \n   \n   2.   Turkey was by no means the universal Thanksgiving centerpiece. Venison was more common, because turkeys were extremely scarce in the colonial era. Even as late as 1840, half of the turkeys were actually smuggled out of Canada!\n   \n   3.

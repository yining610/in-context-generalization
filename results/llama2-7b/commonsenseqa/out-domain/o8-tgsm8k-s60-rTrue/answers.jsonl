{"text": "When you throw a rock, it will make a big splash if thrown towards the ground. The splash will spread if thrown towards the water or land.\nThe best place to throw it is in a lake, river, or pond.\nIf you want to make the biggest splash, Throw it towards the top of the water and use a heavy rock. Avoid throwing it too far away or too close to the edge of the water.\nYou can also try using smaller rocks. This might not make a loud splash, but it is easier to find. Just make sure that you do not throw it towards the ground or towards the edge of a cliff.\nThe best place would be at least 50 meters away from the edge of the river or where they are trying to make the splash.\nSometimes people may ask for a rock in the middle of the river rather than on the shore after throwing. Still, people may not like them throwing too far because they want to enjoy watching while looking around. But some other people may throw rocks closer because they like it when their feet get wet or when they can see it better.\nBridges are the safest place to be. In addition, it reduces the risk of someone getting hurt.\nPeople may not like if you throw a big rock in a river because you can break their car or boat.\nThey might also not like if you throw it too far away from where they are trying to go.\nIf you are trying to break a mirror or some other object in the water, try throwing it towards the water\u2019s surface rather than throwing it directly at the object you are trying to throw the rock away from so that you don\u2019t break any glasses or porcelains.\nIt is also better to throw it near an object than far away from yourself because you may not want them hitting themselves accidentally!\nIf you throw it on the ground, it\u2019s better to go through the water first because it will help prevent them from hitting you later and going in between houses!\nSo here\u2019s the short answer:\nA: You want to avoid throwing rocks from mountains because rocks hit the air faster than water does, and this has a higher potential for injury to yourself and others if you don\u2019t throw correctly. If a rock hits someone or breaks his or her car or boat, then they are more likely to throw something else in anger towards you!\nB: If your rocket hits", "answer": "C: bridge"}

The NFL teams are divided geographically, with one division each in the East, South, North, and West. The New England Patriots and Atlanta Falcons are both in the NFC East. Each team plays 16 games per season, four at home and 12 away.\nOutput: The number in each division is 4\nThe number of teams in each division is 8\nso the number of teams left is 2\nThe NFC East teams are both in the NFCE (4)\nso the AFC teams are 5\nTherefore there are 49 teams in total\nSo the final answer 49\n\nInput: Janine's mother has 30 chairs, each from five different styles. The chairs with two legs are 4 times more numerous than the chairs with four legs. There are 8 more chairs with stools than the total sum of two- and four-legged chairs.

How much more meat does her mom have than Dana?\nOutput: Dana's mother and Dana take 1 pound /5 = 200 *7 = 1400 grams.\nIt is necessary to subtract the meat of Dana from the weight of meat of the mother as we have in 200 grams of meat of Dana subtracted from 1400, the result is 1200 grams. This is the weight of meat left.\nIf we divide 1/2 1,200 we get 600 grams. Dana takes 0.6 (half a pound 350 grams). The remaining part of the 600 gr is left for the mother to 1200-350= 850 grams. This amount will increase by 0.6, we will get 515 grams.\nIn the end Mom has meat of Dana + 0.6 x 1200 = 1265 + 515 = <<1265+515=1780>>1780 grms.\nThe final answer is 1780\n\nInput: How many cubic meters of red paint are needed to paint a truck with a volume of 5.6 cubic meters after 10 liters of paint are used to paint a car?

In the string, each digit is repeated twice and each digit is also followed by a digit that is not divisible by 3. If the string is divisible by both 8 and 11, then the next digit is also not divisible by 5. How many such strings are there with six or fewer digits?\nOutput: In this question, we will see how to find how many such strings are there if each digit is repeated twice.\nInput string: String containing six characters.\n6/2 = 3. So, each of these two digits added up will give 2.\n7/2 = 3 Then, if we replace 3 in all such positions and add it up it is divisible by 8.\nAdd it up, it becomes 18/3. 6/2 = 5/3 then adding, it will be divisible by 11. So, next digit will also be not divisible by 2 and 5.\nSo, answer is 96/21 or 4 or 7.\nThis will complete the question.\n\nInput : After the party, Emily and Haley go on a bike ride in the park.

For example, the number 463 has digits 4, 6 and 3, meaning that the digit 4 is a 1, the digit 6 is a 5 and the digit 3 is a 2. What is this number?\nOutput: If we check the digits according to the question, 463 has a 2 in its 4th and 3rd places, so if we triple 463, we will get 1319. Therefore 1319 +2 = <<1319+2=1321>>1321 \nsince it now has 3 digits\nMultiplying this by 5, we get 333 +2 = <<333+2=335>>335\nBut the third digit should be a 4 instead of 4 since only a 4 can have a 4 in the 7th.\nSo 335 +2 = <<3+2=5>>\n\nInput: 3/4 of a box contains a cube made of plastic of height 3 cm.

{"text": "C\n\n\n### Instructions:The following text is written in a way that allows sentences to be combined using conjunctions. Use the conjunctions given to rewrite the entire paragraph.\n\nSally is going to take the test for her teacher education classes by writing a single essay.  She will study for four hours, but her professor wants her to write two different essays totaling 600 words. She wants to add a lot of details to her essays, but her professor requires that Sally write them in a way that will allow for the quick identification of relevant details. For example, her essays can\u2019t be written in a story style in order to allow her peers as well as her professor to quickly go in and identify the relevant details that she wants them to notice. It is important to note that in order to meet this goal, she will not tell her peers or professor what details to focus on.  She simply tells them the importance of each section and gives them the essay topics to focus on. What types of conjunctions can be used to correctly combine the sentences into one paragraph?\n\n### Input and Response:\nInput:There are four main types of conjunction: coordinating conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so), subordinating conjunction (after, although, because, before, if, unless, until, when, while), correlative conjunction (either, neither, or, and, not only....but also), and interjecitonal conjunction (Hey, hello, how are you, howdy). It is often helpful to combine coordinating and subordinating conjunctions together.  For example: He ran for 2 hours, but did not get anything finished. In this case, the coordinating conjunctions (for two hours) are used in combination with the subordinating conjunction, but. The words but and and should both be added to this sentence in order to correctly rewrite it as: He ran for 75 min. but did not meet his goal. The word not should be added to the end of the sentence after the but in order to correctly rewrite the sentence.\n\nResponse:\nCoordinating conjunctions +and \nSubordinating Conjunction +but \nCoordinating Conjunctions +and  +but\n\n\n### Input & Response:", "answer": "B: getting drunk"}

I believe they where talking about when y^2 would equal x. So I took there was an x^2=y. So I drew a triangle with a 90 degree corner at x=0 and y=0. I then took that y=9 and put 9 on the y. I then took x=-4 and put -4 in the x so when x=0, y=9 and the line would meet the bottom of the triangle at y=-9.

{"text": "Freeze dried food is a popular and convenient way to take food long distances. The main challenge, in the case of space travel, is the size of the equipment used for freeze drying.

{"text": "A\n\n### Instructions:Use the instructions below to answer the question.\n\n## Instructions:The following are two different problems you need to solve in the manner outlined below.\n\n## Response:The response should solve both mathematical problems in the manner described.\n\n### Response A:\n\n### 1. The first problem uses an equals sign, or an equals sign after a plus or minus sign, to indicate that one expression is equal to another expression. The mathematical operators *, /, +, - can be used in the first expression to transform it into another expression that is equal to the second expression. However, in general, you shouldn't think of the first expression merely as a symbol for an expression and then use the operators to try to transform the first expression into the second expression. The first problem is asking us to solve the equation <.2*0.5 =?>, where each side of the equation represents an expression. A common error is to solve <.2*0..5 = 7/ 5> instead of <.2*0?.5 = 7/5>.The reason is that.2 represents an expression that can't be interpreted as the literal expression half. The solution is.2 is equal to half. Therefore,.2*0..5 represents the literal expression half*0.5. This is one of the cases for the = symbol that shouldn't be neglected. Instead, the literal expression represents the result of the multiplication performed on the terms. The solution ends up being one-quarter.\n\n### 2. The second problem uses variables to represent different expressions. For example, the variable x can represent any constant or expression that can be placed in the place left by x. Therefore, 2x + 5x is equal to 7x. In general, a variable is equal to that variable multiplied by some expression, that is represented by a variable as well. The solution of x = 72 + 8x is (2x + 72)/2 = x, and x = 72 is equal to <(2x + 73)/2>.\n\n#### Input: There is so much rain coming down on the street below that the cars can't drive through.

The rest are marriage and finishing up.\n\n#### Demonstration: \n- You will be able to reduce the amount of time it takes to finish a task if you are more efficient.\n- Doing the work and finishing up is the same thing, because finishing up means doing the work.\n\n### Input2\nOne night, there is a big party happening! Three guys and two girls are attending! Each guy, one at a time, goes to the bathroom! However, there are 2 stalls that can be used! The question is how many girls are needed to get the job done?\n\n### Response2\n- 0-The guys should share a stall.\n\n### Answer\nThe amount of times required by a person to go to the bathroom will increase in proportion to the percentage of men in the same bathroom. The amount of girls that are required can be calculated in the exact same way.\n\n### Justify\n\nThere were two boys in the same bathroom, and one in a different one, one after the other. Two people using the same bathroom at the same time is less efficient than one person using one bathroom. To share a bathroom is inefficient, when the amount of time for both people to use it is not equal. The efficiency is the reciprocal of the amount of people using it so the efficiency is 1.0/n where n is the number of people using it.\n\nIf there were only two girls to use the bathroom, then there is only a 1 or 33.3% efficiency in using the same stall for each person. However, if there were more than two, this would result in more efficiency, and the reciprocal of a percentage.\n\nThe efficiency in using two stalls in the bathroom is 2/5, or 40 %. With more people that number decreases.\n\nThis is justified on another level because efficiency in time, cost, and other areas depend on what is used. Using a shared bathroom for a long time could end up being significantly less efficient than using two separate bathrooms, because using one bathroom less is much more efficient than only having one bathroom for the both of you", "answer": "C: marriage"}

{"text": "A\n\nExplanation:\n\n### Input\nBoth Richard and Hurley are 20 years old in the future. The combined ages of Richard and Hurley equals 40 years from the present, so Hurley had to be 20 years old when the problem started. By this logic, Hurley is 10 years older than Richard.\n\n### Response\nRichard and Hurley started with 20 years of age, so the number of years that Richard and Hurley were combined together equals 20 minus their individual ages today. \n\nSince Hurley is 24 years old, and they started out with 20 years, the total number of years Hurley and Richard are combined would be 20 - 24, which equals -4. To add these two numbers together, you start out with the smaller of the positive values, which in this case is -4. \n\nIn the future, if Hurley was 14 years old and Richard was 20 years old, then the total number of years since they started equals -4 (or 20-14). Richard is 20 - (-4), so by adding these 2 numbers together, the expression becomes 20 + (-4). Thus the combined ages for the future of Hurley and Richard would be (20 + (-4)).\n\nAdding 4 and 20 together, the expression equals 24 and, thus, the combined ages equal 24 years after the starting point.\n\n### Input The car cost $1700, and each car wash made $500, thus making the total combined cost of the car wash $1200. The remaining price was split six ways, however, with Brad not being included in purchasing the car, the price is now split for the remaining 5 people, adding up to $7000, or $1400 per person.\n\n### Explanation\nIt is important to note that this problem was stated that the cost of the car was $1700 total, and that each wash was for $500.  Since Brad didn\u2019t participate in the wash, he didn\u2019t make $500 either.  However, the group made $1200 total.   \n\nSubtract $1200 from $", "answer": "D: get arrested"}

The farmer was astonished.  After a while the man asked him why he had ever started working at that time in the first place. The farmer replied \u201cFor many reasons. Firstly, for health reasons. Working so much makes one healthy and fit. Secondly, for financial reasons. Money from all these hours of working every day would be invested and could make some money from interest paid. This would allow some more money for health-related things. Thirdly, for social reasons. Working makes one fit to spend more time with people and even to find romance, as is often the case with a farmer. Lastly, for family reasons.

For some reason he only owned 2 pairs of pants and 1 pair was still smoldering after the fire.  He asked his friend Jim to help.  Jim told Gene not to worry, he\u2019d figure it out.  Jim knew the pair smoldering was the same pair Gene had when they\u2019d last met.  After a bit of thought Jim said, \u201cGive me a moment to think.  Then I\u2019ll fix this.

Gene asked Jim to fix the problem, Jim told Gene to worry about it and that Jim will fix the issue. Jim then thought about it and came up with an idea. Gene will combine Jim\u2019s old pair of pants with Gene\u2019s smoldering old pants to create a new pair of pants. So Gene originally had 2 pants, Jim offered another pair of pants to Gene.

Honey bees can produce only relatively small amounts of honey compared to the volume of nectar consumed, and they only store as much honey as necessary to last through the winter. When foraging, honey bees are normally 3 to 5 kilometres (1.9 to 3.1 miles) from the hive.\n\n### Input 2\nIn beekeeping there are two distinct types of honey bee hives: conventional hives and Top Bar Hives. In these hives honey is collected in a container that serves to protect the colony. This container has been a hive cover which protects the colony from the elements. This container may be a hive body or an observation hive, depending on which part you are describing. In honey beekeeping, a hive body is made from a solid block of wax or other substance that allows honey to be extracted into frames.\n\nThe body contains a collection of honeycombs. Honeycombs are built from hexagonal wax cell walls. The wax is gathered by the honeybees to build these cells of honey. In a honey bee colder climate like Canada or the US Pacific Coast, or as a hobby for beekeepers in some countries, a screen may be placed over the entrance to prevent strong wind and snow or cold temperatures from entering the hive. Honey bees may not normally survive temperature lower than about 53 to 59 \u00b0F (12 to 15 \u00b0C). A queen honey bee is selected from a hive's worker bees and fertilized while mated with male drones, which fly outside the hive.\n---\n\n\n### Instructions:\n\nYou are given input in the form of a string.

But, in this task, we are given that the difference in ages between Richard 20 years old and Hurley 14 years old.\n\n**Condition:** If Hurley is 21 years old.\n\nRichard is old as Hurley 20 years from now.\n\n**Therefore,**\n1. Hurley will be 21 years old in 40 years = 128 years from now\n2. The difference in ages between Hurley and Richard = Hurley 20- (20- 14) = 20 - 5 = 15\n\nThen\n1. To get old as Hurley 128 years older = 128 - 15 = $113$ years older\n\n**Richard will be Hurley 113 years older.**\n\n**Solutions:**  \nA) The correct answer is $113$.\n\n### Note: \nIf Hurley is 15 years old, Richard will be Hurley 55 years older.", "answer": "C: bakery"}

The elements that atoms are made of are used in lots of everyday things. Many household items, such as water bottles, are made of plastic or metal. Plants use carbon atoms to make food for themselves. People use carbon atoms from plants to make food themselves.\n```\n\nExample Two:\n```\nYour body, hair, or food is made of atoms.  Each atom has their own chemical makeup in a unique way. Carbon is one of the most commonly used elements to make atoms. This is because Carbon atoms are able to easily form covalent bonds with each other.\n\nEach human is made of an estimated number of 30 trillion cells.

{"text": "If you want to do something, riots would be the best option. A riot is a violent disturbance of the public peace by an assembly of three or more persons, to intimidate or coerce a government body or to further commercial or other private interests. This definition makes sense as people who use violence to force society to change society aren't trying to better the lives of the people in society, but instead to better themselves. Voting is important in changing society. Changing society through social activism is not possible to change society. Someone who uses social activism to change society is doing it to benefit themselves and in the end won't make any difference in society. Social activism is doing things like going on protest walks, protesting, joining a political party and using your time and emotions with good purpose. The definition of change can be defined as something that is made more effective, better, or more significant. So with that, you can\u2019t change society unless you know what the society needs and making actions that will lead to the perfect outcome. Clothes don't make the man but a change in society does. Your appearance shouldn\u2019t be a priority in regards to changing society; it should be your values and making changes based on values.\n\n### Input;\nGiven: A man was walking one mile to work and walked back to his car and then drove to work 2 miles away at 45 mph.

Then, he took his banana too.  The cycle repeats again and again until one gorilla is left without a banana. How many gorillas were in line?\n\n### Response\n\nThere were a total of 8 gorillas in line.\n\nSince, each gorilla took the exact same number of bananas from the start all the way through, we can say there were only a finite number of bananas, enough for each gorilla one time. If any one gorilla does NOT get a banana, then obviously the number of gorillas is greater than the number of bananas.\n\nWe know the second gorrila takes two bananas.\n\nIf the first gorilla had one banana, then the second gorilla would have none and we can immediately confirm that the number of gorrilas must be at least 2\n\nThere are 2 gorillas because the first one gets the first banana.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nAfter the first gorilla receives its banana, a total of 8 bananas are left and only the remaining 8 gorillas could have bananas", "answer": "E: solar system"}

If you subtract his age, you subtract 12, so he is 12+12 = 24. \n\nThe second person's age is twice the first's and 4 times the other's, so he is 24+24 = 48. \n\n(12-12)*2 = 48 - 24 = 24\n\nAnswer B: To answer, we need some more information.

Choices: A: the 100 th number is even. B: the 101st number is odd. C: the 102nd number is a multiple of four. D: The 103rd number is a multiple of five. E: The absolute value of the product of the 100 numbers is a multiple of 2. Explanation: In part 2, the sum of the product comes to be 34. So summing up 34, the next number is 4 which is an odd number and the option is B.\n\n### Explanation: The product of consecutive whole numbers is a multiple of three, which implies the product is odd. If every number is even and the product is odd, the sequence should continue. So the 100-th number should be odd. If every number in the sequence is three times bigger than the previous one, it means it can be written as, (i/2)-1.

Do not write out the answer. 2. Do not talk to a human being while the test is taking place. 3. The test will run for 5 minutes. 4. The test is timed. 5. The test will run and you will only be able to complete it once per day. 6. The test is only 20 questions and to finish it you have to complete at least 14 or more questions, otherwise you have to start from the first question. 7.

The robot will only see the same question 3 times and for the third time, his submission will be considered the final answer for the question. 10. If the robot does not know the answer to a question and he can not guess the answer to a question, he will get a zero score for that question. The restriction was: The robot can't use calculators or cheat in any other form which is considered cheating. If the robot does use cheat, he will fail the test and have to start over.

The second line of input contains a set of integers of any size, all less than $3.00 each.  The third line consists of an integer (n), showing the number of total operations. After the description of the problem, there are the first two lines of input. The last line will contain the sum of steps.\n\nIf the number from line 1 is 1, then the method is to make change from a set of coins. If the number from line 2 is 1, then take the largest coin and replace one of every other coin of the same value.  There will only be one copy of the largest coin in the set after the method is finished. If both of these are 1, replace one coin of each value.  The new number used to represent the value of a coin is the same as the old number plus one. If the number from 1 is 2, then take all denominations equal to and greater than $1.00.  Keep one set of each denomination of every value except $1.00 in the first sum. For the second set of coins, take the largest denomination and remove one of each value equal to or greater than that denomination.  These two sums of coins are equivalent to the set of coins in the problem, when rounded to the nearest cent. If the number in line 2 is 2, choose two sets of coin denominations.  From the largest, remove one of every other.  From the second set, remove one of every value, leaving as many of every value as before removing.\nIf the method is to make a set of n coins representing integer values, use the largest integer as the first coin.  Use the second largest as the next coin and so on, rounding up with the last coin. If the method is to make n coins, use a second largest coin.  \nFor example, if the set of denominations is $1, $10, $20, $50, $100, $200, and you want $3.00, then you will make 10 co", "answer": "C: space center"}

However, it is clear from the context that James is in secondary school for class room.

That would give him an even split of the cost of the cars and leave money for him to invest.  Joshua decided to lower the costs from 90 cars to 80 cars. While this would be great news for Joshua, James would only make 80 dollars if he was able to sell for 80 cente per car. James would be making 120 dollars if he gets 90 cars.\n\nJoshua needs more than 5$. This makes James' profit go down.  This means they should work together and get 110% of Joshua's revenue.

When you first turn on your computer it spends hours booting up.  Boot up occurs when the computer moves from the sleep state to the user interface state.  In this state, all the services and applications that the user needs must be loaded from flash drives into memory.  While booting up, the computer also has a timer that monitors the amount of time it spends in the boot up stage and makes up for lost time upon completion.  The timer counts the number of hours and minutes that the computer spends in both states while booting up.  On average", "answer": "B: opera"}

How many people turned 18 between 2020 and 2021 in the area? \n\nAnswer: 2457\n\n### Response Guidance:\nThe key idea in this question relies on using information about the population size and knowing what percentage of the population is represented by a given age group.\n\n\n### Solved Example:\n\nLet's first look at the total population 2020\n\nThen compare the number of people between 15-19 and between 20-24. The total of 15-18 and 20-25 is 2039, but 2020 has a population of 5949. Thus, the people between 15 and 19 represent only 1.3% of the population, whereas the people age 20-29 represent almost 34% and the people between 30-39 represent around a quarter of the number. In the 5 year time between 2022 and 3027, there were almost 13 times as many people between 15 to 19 as those were born between 2027 to 2020. We need to compare between 2021 and 2027, but in this calculation, we can only account for the 5 year olds on the 2022 population and on the 2030 population -- or those born between the years 2022 to 2026.\n\nGiven that we know the total population in 2020 was 59", "answer": "D: mouth"}

{"text": "A person who wants to increase wealth but cannot do so simply needs to save more of their income. While a house purchase is undoubtedly a costly affair, there are often opportunities to save money so that individuals can purchase a house. Even if they are unable to afford a home, they can purchase an investment property so that they can obtain rental income. This can be done if they have a job that can sustain the mortgage costs and then additionally pay off the home loan.\n\n### Input\nA person is offered a deal to purchase both their home and another. Because of a combination of the cost of both, they cannot afford to complete both. They also would not want to sell one because of the additional benefits. Additionally, there is a significant tax benefit to keeping both homes. If the person is able to claim a $2000 refund, will they need to be concerned about tax on $5000, $2000, or $0? Be specific and provide supporting details.\nIn the above scenario, the person is able to make use of a tax refund that is lesser than the interest that they owed. As a result, the homeowner will not be required to pay tax on $50,000, $10,000 or $0 of the additional funds that they have earned. Thus, it is highly likely that they will either pay only the equivalent of tax on $20,000 of funds or even less.\n\n### Note: A problem with the original version of this prompt included the wording \u2018If the person is able to purchase either their home or the other\u2019. Thus, it is clear that the person\u2019s goal is to keep both homes based on the tax benefit.

Each day, customers come and buy fruit. The next day, the fruits are reduced by $2 per fruit sold. What percentage of the fruits sold remain on the fourth day? Remember, if no fruits sell, they remain the same price on each day until the fifth day.\n\n### Solution:\nLet us assume the initial price of each fruit is 15$. Thus, the number of fruits sold is inversely proportional to cost (1/15). The price reduction will be inversely proportional to sold fruit. Thus, the price reduction formula will be given as: 1/15 - 1/15 * 1/15... * 1/16.\n\nThus, the price reduction percentages = (15% - 10% - 5% - 1% - 0.5%) = - 45%.\n\n### Instruct:You can take any two non-collinear points.

Distance divided by time will get the distance traveled per min, so the formula would be distance per min/15 to show how much mileage you walked per min. So A/15, and you still need the other 90 min of distance and then divided by 15 (the extra time you were hiking), so B = A + (4min/15) = 151/15.

{"text": "A\n\n### Analysis:\nFirst, we determine the number of each response.\nFor each person we start with the letter A. We remove this letter from the string (A-D), the string remaining is E. Now we subtract E from the alphabet (A-E) giving us the number of each response remaining.\nFor example: 'ABD' - 'A' => 'BDC' - 'D' => 'BCE' => 2 responses remaining.\n\nNext, we determine the value for each response.\nResponse A has an expected value of the number of letters in the list minus 1.\nResponse B has an expected value of 4.\nResponse C has an expected value of a fraction 7/11 since the list has those letters.\nResponse D has an expected value of half of the alphabet remaining (since the only number we know is the number of letters, not the alphabet).\nResponse E has an expected value of twice the size of alphabet minus 1, or 8.\n\nThus, the expected value for each response is:\na 1 b 7/11 c 1/2 d 2 e 16\n\nAfter adding the numbers together we get the result as 11+7/11+1/2 2+2 = 11\n\n### Analysis for response:\nTo calculate the value of each response we begin by subtracting each of them from the total. The answer can be simplified by using the following rule:\nThe values of `a, b, d, e` will always add up to the value for `total`.\n\nExample: `answer = total - c - b - d - e = A - B - D - E - C = Answer`\n\nTo evaluate this step with numbers: `Sum of answers for all the above options = {2 + 2 + 11 + 7*7/71 + 2 = 11}`\n\n### Output:\n\n### Instructions:Calculate the area of the rectangle.

{"text": "The answer is D.\n\n### Justification:\nIn the instructions it is referring to an instrument. In this case a violin. This could be either A: clarinet, C: piano or D: guitar. Each of these instruments is associated with a specific musical style. The answer the instructions gives is referring to a rock band which clearly is made of different types of instruments. When a rock band is on tour you won't hear a single violin or flute.\n\n### Input :A musician is most concerned with their hearing. Choices: A: pitch B: rhythm C: timbre D: melody E: harmony\n\n### Response :\nThe answer is E.\n\n###  Justification:\nAlthough this answer is technically incorrect when the instrument is of primary importance you will find a musician tends to be most concerned with their hearing while performing. I believe this is because the musician has already practiced all the other elements required to play an instrument.\n\n###   Input: Which type of song is likely to be sung by an opera singer? Choices: A: rap B: ballad C: gospel D: rock E: sonata\n\n### Response\nThe answer is D\n\n###  Justice\nThis question asks which type of song is performed by an opera singer. Since an opera is a type of play you are meant to sing the songs of the characters in the play. This means that an opera singer is more likely to perform in multiple genres as the different characters may sing in very different styles.\n\n###    Input: The musician should practice their instruments more when they've been away from playing them for 4 days Choices: A: 5 days B: 3 days C: 7 days D: 9 days E: 2 days\n\n###  Response\nThe answer is B\n\n###  Reasoning\nThe question is which time of playing away from their instrument will a musician become rustier. If your instrument is your career you wouldn't simply quit playing without some warning. This means there is always a chance a musician will not play for at least 3 days at a time.\n\n###                                 Input: A musician is playing a piece when someone knocks over their sheet music.

If Jasmine earned $1000 on her first working day, how much did she get in her paycheck?\n\n### Response #3\n\n Input: Jasmine was paid $1000 the first working day, therefore would only be paid out her wage by 70% of that.  Jasmine left the bathroom, therefore only 30% of wage would have to be taken out. Jasmine left twice to the bathroom, therefore 70% of 30% of her wage would be taken out.  30% of 3o% multiplied by Jasmine's wage.

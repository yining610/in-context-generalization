What grade letter does a third grader have?\nOutput: C\n\n### Explanation\nI solved this task through first solving the problem in the recursive manner. For a given difference in age, Richard and Hurley are each i years old and Hurley's age (h) is equal to 14 - i.\n\nWe assume that Hurley\u2019s parents are planning to pay him at the end of every (21) years and that is why Hurley is saving for 40 years from next with each additional year.\n\nFor a given Richard\u2019s age, we need 40(Richard\u2019s age) for the Hurley to make 40 years from his age at the same time to match Hurley\u2019s age for Richard.\n\nAs for each year, Richard gets double of the money he got the previous year. By that way, Hurley will be getting double than last year\u2019s money which means to make that plan complete for 5 years will require 40(Richards age)*(20 - Richard\u2019s age).\n\nThus, Richard\u2019s age after 40 years will be\n\nRichard\u2019s age = Hurley\u2019s age - amount of money Richard\u2019s parents have given him = Hurley\u2019s 14 - 40(Richmond\u2019s ages)*(20 - Richmondy's ages)\n\nWe need 14 - Hurley\u2019s age to be (Richmond's ages)*(21 - Richard\u2019s ages) for Richard\u2019s parents to make an additional payment of 20 after Richard got two additional units in the next year.\n\nRichard\u2019ss age = 14 - (Richmond's age)*(21 - Richmond\u2019s ages)\n\nRichard's 24th years (Richmond\u2019s age*20/21) will start when Richard\u2019s age becomes 23.\n\nThus after 40 years age will become,\n\nRichard\u2019 age = 24 - 14 + 40(Richardinage)*(20/21).\n\nRichard\u2019 s age = 24", "answer": "B: museum"}

Let's take a look at all six cereal boxes together:\n\n![alt text](https://imgur.com/U1pZUF1)\n\nWe note that the cost of each cereal box is a multiple of the price of the 3 boxes.\n\nLet assume $A, B, C, $ are the 3 box's price and $C1, C2, C3$ are those three boxes' cost.\n\nBy following the problem instruction, we can conclude that the $6$ box's price must be a multiple of  $6C1 \\times B \\times B \\times C$\n\nThe last conclusion can be easily applied to the problem with the formula: $6A=n(6C1 \\times C2 \\times C3)^k$ and $k = 5$\n\nIn other words, $n = \\frac{6A}{6C1 \\times  C2 \\times  C3}^5$.\n\nAnd $A=\\$9.98$\n\nInput:There is 5.3125 meters of wood that costs $7.50 a meter.

The grade for the class is determined by the students\u2019 homework grade and their test grade.  The teacher wants to give students the option to gain extra credit; however, only 9 students out of 20 students are available for extra credit.  The teacher asks each of her students to stay after class for 10 minutes per extra credit they need. Each student staying after class also must submit an in-class assignment to the teacher.  Each student who completes their extra credit work will take home 15% of the extra credit points for completion.  The maximum number of extra credit points each student could receive is (2 \u00d7 [their current grade \u2013 (10% \u00d7 their homework grade)])  To help students to understand the extra credit, she uses the table below to determine extra credit points. If a student needs extra credit and they meet the requirements to complete extra credit, they will receive the corresponding number of points. If a student requires less than 5 extra credit points, that student should just meet the extra credit requirement; however, they will not be included in the point total of the class grade.  Homework grade of student is at a perfect score, 100%.\nThe following table shows which students met the requirements for extra credit.\nFor example, student #2 earned 2 extra credit points because student #2\u2019s homework grade was higher than the threshold of a 10%.  For student #10, she earned 1 extra credit point because her homework grade was 70%.  Since she did not need an additional 5 extra credit points to earn the necessary 45% to pass the class, she does not add any extra credit points in that example.\nStudents received an additional 2.5%, 5%, 7.5%, 10%, or 12.5% for completing extra credit works. Students\u2019 extra credit points were combined with their homework and test grade to create points for the class grade.\n\nExtra Credit Work Example\nStudent\nClass Grade Needed\nMax Amount Earned in\nClass\nCurrent Grade\nExtra Credit Needed\nMax Points Earned\n1  54.5%\n12.5%\n2 60\n2\n3", "answer": "E: small case"}

{"text": "Nome\n\nInput:You are an engineer for the military and designed the newest fighter jet to be used in combat. The fighter jet gets its information from a satellite that is 28,000 miles away. The government is looking to outfit the satellites to be safer. It wants the satellites to have a radius of security of 200 miles. The only part of the satellite that has a radius is the antenna. The antenna can only point in two directions: the first is 180 degrees, the second is 30 degrees. The satellite is 1200 miles from the planet. To calculate the security zone, the government takes the radius of the satellite (1200) and moves it 200 miles away from the planet. They found out it should be the 2500 mark (if it had a radius of 2500 miles, then they can move 200 miles from that radius to create a 200 mile radius). Given that the antenna can point in two directions, the antenna would use the second position of 30 degrees while the fighter jet it was used upon could only ever use the first position of 180 degrees. If the satellite moved in the first direction, this would violate the rule of being 200 miles off from anywhere in the planet. This means the satellite could only ever be in line with either 0 degrees or 180 degrees away from the center of the planet. If the satellite's main antenna stayed parallel to the planets main axis, then it would move in the direction of 0 degrees when approaching the earth and move opposite of the planets main axis (the direction of 180) when leaving the planet. The government did not want this to happen. So, the government wanted the satellite to always be in a position away from the planets main axis. This means the satellite had to move when it approached a position of 0 degrees. The government added a little extra to the distance, such that the satellite could go only 700 miles beyond the planet. Now if the satellite used that extra 700 to leave the satellite's main axis (the planet's main axis) while it was leaving the planets orbit, then the satellite could be outside of the planets main plane. If the satellite moves in the direction of", "answer": "C: troms\u00f8"}

The first way we will do is rounding to the nearest dollar.  For example in $1000.2, the closest money to $1000 is $1000, but 20 cents to nearest dollar is 35 cents.  So $1000 rounded to the nearest dollar would be $1000 and $10000.2 rounded to the nearest dollary would be $10,000.35.  The second way to divide money is to round with a dollar value to the whole number.  For example in 1000-2 50 cent would not be rounded to $100, it would be rounded to $1.  In $5000-0.00015 it would not be rounded t $5000 either,  it would be rounded to 5000.00000.  So in $100.05, it is the same as $100 but it is not the same for $5000.23.

The second and third select teachers who average at least the first student's teacher.  Which of these students' score is most likely to be above the average score?\nOutput : 60\n\n#### Explanation:\nThe first two question is easy by using the multiplication on the first two equation and subtracting the second from the first.\n\nFor the second question, since each person contribute an equal amount and they each put that amount to their individual savings. It is the total percentage of the total money each person contributed. Using that and the extra 44 dollars, you can determine what's left for each person. For the third question, just multiply the total amount of money that the people contributed by the time and divide by 100 to get the total hours.\n\nFor the forth question since they worked five days, you need to subtract 25 from 52.\n\nFor the fifth, question divide the average pay on each individual to determine the total pay on each person.

The brute force algorithm checks both ways.\n- Ex: A brute force algorithm for Fizz Buzz would be as follows:\n\n\t\t\t\t- Try every number that can be used to count. Check if it is divisible by 5, check if it is divisible evenly by 3, and check if it is divisble by 7\n\t\t\t\t#1  Try every number 1-27\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t1 -> 1\n\t\t\t\t2 -> 3\n\t\t\t\t3 -> 6\n\t\t\t\t4 -> 7 (checks both 2n+1 and 2n)\n\t\t\t\t5 -> 8\n\t\t\t\t6 -> 10\n\t\t\t\t7 -> 11\n\t\t\t\n- This would be how brute force solutions can lead to a suboptimal solution. It can be done quickly, but without optimizing any potential, it will produce the same solution everytime.\n\t\n#### **Step 2: Generating All Possible Combinations** \n- Given certain variables, it is possible to list out all of the options. This can be done by breaking down the problem and finding out how many options each variable has.\n-", "answer": "D: wash dishes"}

Use your script to test each prompt and label it with the question type. To help you with this, I created a function which will take a variable that will be the name of a prompt. Then, it will iterate over the prompts in a file and will run your script on each prompt. This function is inside the test.py file in the folder where you will be doing this problem set. For this problem set, we need to create a function that gets a prompt name as a parameter.  Then, in your function, it should create a list with the questions in your file.  From these questions, you should have a list of choices called \u2018choices\u2019 which is the prompt, followed by a line of choices.  Once you have this list of questions, you should run \u2018prompt = \u201cType of Question\u201d\u2019 and set a function called \u2018Question(prompt, choices)\u2019.  This question function should pull information out of the choices parameters and should build a string with that information or pass that information to another function if needed.  For example, if you receive the choice of \u2018Choose all of the following words that are found in the dictionary\u2019 this string would be the words from the choices parameter \u2018Choose all of these words that are found in a dictionary\u2019 For your first problem, the prompt will be \u2018Type of Question\u2019 then you will find the first choice in the list of choices, so this choice will be called first.

The problem is that the total cost is some mathematical value and cannot be displayed as a string. Thus, each person only knows the amount one room costs on a specific day. However, when they put these values together to form a total, they just don\u2019t add these values up. Instead, they multiply each value by some constant, let\u2019s say \u201cc\u201d, and then take the result as a whole.

How many pizzas does it cost to make 12 pizzas made with twice the ingredients? \n\nOutput: 6\n\n\n\n## Difficulty: Easy\n\n\n## Key insight: You can solve the problem by subtracting all the costs from the original price.\n\nSay you have $100 and can buy some items at a rate of 20% off the sale price.  In order to get that 20% off, you can multiply your original cost by 1.2.  When you subtract the sale cost from the original sale price you can also use a similar technique to get any other ratios that you want.  In order to work out 20% off you can multiply the original cost by 150% and get a total of $1.2.  You get half of the extra cost back by multiplying by.5.  The result of $0.9 means you originally bought an item for $1.2 but you got it for $0.9.\n\nSimilarly you can do this kind of ratio for any other item you have.  Let's say you're trying to calculate 35x off the original price.  Instead of doing an equation like $100 * (1/35) = $5.1, you can solve for your ratios by taking some of a percentage away from 100%.  100-", "answer": "B: wet ground"}

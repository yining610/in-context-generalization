To pass multiple values into your method, use `String[] args`, which gives you an array-type value as input - in this example, you pass 2 items into the class.\n2. You'll be using `Integer.parseInt()` to convert user input into `int` values when calculating the result.\n3. The `main()` method takes these values and calls `compute()` as shown in the above example. It also outputs the result as `+System.out.println()`.\n\n### Solution \n\nThe code would be as follows:\n```java\npublic static int compute(int x,int y){\n    System.out.print(\"Input: \");\n            int b=  Integer.parseInt(s);   \n    return x*(b-y);\n}\n```\n \n### Questions:\n1.

{"text": "D\n\nWhat is the only correct answer to the riddle?\nA: The boy in the middle\n\nInput: There is a three character race, consisting of a fox, a snake and a rabbit.  All players have two feet and start one foot in front of each other.  They race on a straight track.  Rules are as follows:  Fox: The fox must move first and place first foot.  Snake: He must move second and place first foot. Rabbit: He must move with the fox.  The fox, if he moves first, will place second foot on the line between the last two feet of the snake and the last foot of the rabbit.  The rabbit, if he moves last, will place second foot where the snake's first foot was placed.  There can only be one winner.  For example: If the snake moves first, he will land exactly opposite where the fox started. This makes the fox lose.  However the rabbit was in the middle, because he had no where to move.  If the fox moved first, he would land exactly opposite where the rabbit started, and win.  For example: The snake started first, the rabbit followed.  The snake had to move first, so he lost.  The rabbit was in the exact center of the course.  He had no where to move, and hence nothing changed. The fox moved and landed where his first foot was placed. He had nowhere to go but to where his first foot was.  What was the answer the race?\nOutput: Fox\n\n#!/bin/sh\n# @tsumaoka\n\n[ $# -ne 0 ] &&./${1:-script.sh}\n\telse\n\t\techo \"Usage:./${0##*/}.sh <input_text> [output_value]\"\n\tfi\n\nif [ \"$?\" -ne \"0\" ];then\n        echo \"Please input one argument.\"\n        echo \"Usage:./${1##*/}.sh <output_value>\"\n        exit\nfi\n\nif [ $# -eq 1 ];then\n        if [ \"$1\" = \"output\" ];then\n                echo \"Welcome to the instruction.

{"text": "D\n\n\n### Explanation:\nFirst of all we have to clear out the input as to what the input is asking us.\nLet us suppose, the girl has purchased some of the stickers(89)and used some of them on pages also.\nNow let us take some other things such as on how much pages have she stuck the stickers.\nAs we see she used the large paper 3 times on her page and each time have used 7 stickers.\nHence, we apply a multiplication of 3*7=21 which is then subtracted from original 89. Then the answer is 68. \nWe will also calculate the possible answers using the modulo operator.\nThe final answer we get is 44.\n\n\nThe second question is about the boy's daily expenses.\nHe has already saved up Rs.65 and then he gets the money(weekly allowance) of Rs. 5 on every Friday.\nHence, he could afford only Rs. 5.\nAlso he will babysit for 2 hours if he mows the laund in Saturday and that will give him Rs. 7 as an hourly pay.\n\nNow,we can calculate the answer as per the question.\nThe answer to the question is 6 because Rs. 65+2*7=66.75. Since the question wants the no. after rounding off. Hence, we have to get the least number from the answer and that comes out to be 6.\n\nThe third question is about Josh's mom. \nSo let us suppose the Josh's mum has $20.\nSo he buys a hat for Rs. 10 and a pizzle for Rs. 2. The value of the pizzle is 1.25 because a pizzle is Rs. 1.25.\nThe final answer he would get would be Rs.2 because a sum of $20-26=0.7. Since he has 0.7, he will get Rs.2\n\nThe fourth question is about George bingo team.\nThe old record is a score of 287.\nSo George's team has already scored an average score  of 10440 so far.", "answer": "E: hand written"}

Because of time I just chose any one of them) and since we are given the question as even or odds we can just return the even ones\n\n---\n\n\n#### Solution 2:\n**This is the approach I am more confidant in with dynamic programming**\n\nWe can use a table of array of a length equal to the length of our input array, where we can store the answer dynamically.\nEach table element is a node with two children where each child will be initialized with false.\nif the given input is even, let's store `true` in the current node of the array. else in the `next` node and let the next node have the same starting conditions (initializing the children to false).\n\nThen we keep incrementing the current variable (the counter in our problem) and each time we do it we keep checking if the number is even and if it is in the current `node` and then again we check the next node to see weather the number is odd.\n\n\nAs the elements of our table are an array we can get away with passing them as arguments each time we need to check the elements and then each time we need to increment the counter we can either move one position down in our current array or at each loop we can move back to the previous position while decrementing the element of the `counter` that we have moved down by one.

Babysitting 2 hours will leave him with 63. He has already saved $65. Adding $65 to $63 leaves him with $128. However, babysitting adds another $7 to his wallet. That leaves him with $135. Then his allowance on Friday gives him $5, leaving him $130 over the end. He already has a kangaroo, which leaves him with goats. Multiplying two by three gives him six. I ended up adding one for the hat, which gave me 7, and adding one more for the pencil, giving me 8. I also took one away for the four cookies, which gave me 6, and was left with $130.\n\nF) George's team scored 10440 in 10 rounds. They need to add to their average score per round so they tie the current record, which is an average of 287 (10440/38). His team scored 287 in the 10th round. If they increase the team's average score in the final round just enough, no matter what their score is, they will tie the record.\n\nE) The answer is medicine chest. They say medicine cabinet, which is a thing of the past, and the current cabinet is the kitchen. I figured that the kitchen had a cabinet in it because it contained appliances and a table and chairs. That is also where pots and pans are kept, and it is also where food is stored. That led me to believe that the kitchen is the closest that deodorant is to me.\n\n### Examination for 2/17/2017", "answer": "D: grocery store"}

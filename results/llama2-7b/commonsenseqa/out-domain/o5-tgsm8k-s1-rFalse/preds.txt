To pass multiple values into your method, use `String[] args`, which gives you an array-type value as input - in this example, you pass 2 items into the class.<n>2. You'll be using `Integer.parseInt()` to convert user input into `int` values when calculating the result.<n>3. The `main()` method takes these values and calls `compute()` as shown in the above example. It also outputs the result as `+System.out.println()`.<n><n>### Solution <n><n>The code would be as follows:<n>```java<n>public static int compute(int x,int y){<n>    System.out.print("Input: ");<n>            int b=  Integer.parseInt(s);   <n>    return x*(b-y);<n>}<n>```<n> <n>### Questions:<n>1.

The array will then be printed to the screen in the format described in the explanation above.  You are also given a letter and the option to print the letters to the screen or simply return to the user a string in C#.

All players have two feet and start one foot in front of each other.  They race on a straight track.  Rules are as follows:  Fox: The fox must move first and place first foot.  Snake: He must move second and place first foot. Rabbit: He must move with the fox.  The fox, if he moves first, will place second foot on the line between the last two feet of the snake and the last foot of the rabbit.  The rabbit, if he moves last, will place second foot where the snake's first foot was placed.  There can only be one winner.  For example: If the snake moves first, he will land exactly opposite where the fox started. This makes the fox lose.  However the rabbit was in the middle, because he had no where to move.  If the fox moved first, he would land exactly opposite where the rabbit started, and win.  For example: The snake started first, the rabbit followed.  The snake had to move first, so he lost.  The rabbit was in the exact center of the course.  He had no where to move, and hence nothing changed. The fox moved and landed where his first foot was placed. He had nowhere to go but to where his first foot was.  What was the answer the race?<n>Output: Fox<n><n>#!/bin/sh<n># @tsumaoka<n><n>[ $# -ne 0 ] &&./${1:-script.sh}<n>	else<n>		echo "Usage:./${0##*/}.sh <input_text> [output_value]"<n>	fi<n><n>if [ "$?" -ne "0" ];then<n>        echo "Please input one argument."<n>        echo "Usage:./${1##*/}.sh <output_value>"<n>        exit<n>fi<n><n>if [ $# -eq 1 ];then<n>        if [ "$1" = "output" ];then<n>                echo "Welcome to the instruction.

What type of cards did he choose, instead? Choices:  A: cursive writing B: hand writing C: store bought D: online media E: hand written<n>Output:		D<n><n><n>### Explanation:<n>First of all we have to clear out the input as to what the input is asking us.<n>Let us suppose, the girl has purchased some of the stickers(89)and used some of them on pages also.<n>Now let us take some other things such as on how much pages have she stuck the stickers.<n>As we see she used the large paper 3 times on her page and each time have used 7 stickers.<n>Hence, we apply a multiplication of 3*7=21 which is then subtracted from original 89. Then the answer is 68. <n>We will also calculate the possible answers using the modulo operator.<n>The final answer we get is 44.<n><n><n>The second question is about the boy's daily expenses.<n>He has already saved up Rs.65 and then he gets the money(weekly allowance) of Rs. 5 on every Friday.<n>Hence, he could afford only Rs. 5.<n>Also he will babysit for 2 hours if he mows the laund in Saturday and that will give him Rs. 7 as an hourly pay.<n><n>Now,we can calculate the answer as per the question.<n>The answer to the question is 6 because Rs. 65+2*7=66.75. Since the question wants the no. after rounding off. Hence, we have to get the least number from the answer and that comes out to be 6.<n><n>The third question is about Josh's mom. <n>So let us suppose the Josh's mum has $20.<n>So he buys a hat for Rs. 10 and a pizzle for Rs. 2. The value of the pizzle is 1.25 because a pizzle is Rs. 1.25.<n>The final answer he would get would be Rs.2 because a sum of $20-26=0.7. Since he has 0.7, he will get Rs.2<n><n>The fourth question is about George bingo team.<n>The old record is a score of 287.<n>So George's team has already scored an average score  of 10440 so far.

The old record is an average score per player of 287 per round. Each team has 4 players and there are 10 rounds in the season. Through the first 9 rounds, his team has scored a total of 10,440.

Choices:  A: medicine cabinet B: medicine chest C: armpits D: grocery store E: kitchen<n>Output:		Medicine chest<n><n>### Explanation of solutions<n><n>A) I got the correct answer, but I had to guess about where to store my deodorant.<n><n>B) I got the correct amount of stickers, and used all my pages by the end.<n><n>C) He started with $5, earned $71 more, and spent $81, all of which left $5.<n><n>D) He needed to earn $57, so he needed $62 (exactly one more than needed) to buy the bike.<n><n>E) He started with 65. Babysitting 2 hours will leave him with 63. He has already saved $65. Adding $65 to $63 leaves him with $128. However, babysitting adds another $7 to his wallet. That leaves him with $135. Then his allowance on Friday gives him $5, leaving him $130 over the end. He already has a kangaroo, which leaves him with goats. Multiplying two by three gives him six. I ended up adding one for the hat, which gave me 7, and adding one more for the pencil, giving me 8. I also took one away for the four cookies, which gave me 6, and was left with $130.<n><n>F) George's team scored 10440 in 10 rounds. They need to add to their average score per round so they tie the current record, which is an average of 287 (10440/38). His team scored 287 in the 10th round. If they increase the team's average score in the final round just enough, no matter what their score is, they will tie the record.<n><n>E) The answer is medicine chest. They say medicine cabinet, which is a thing of the past, and the current cabinet is the kitchen. I figured that the kitchen had a cabinet in it because it contained appliances and a table and chairs. That is also where pots and pans are kept, and it is also where food is stored. That led me to believe that the kitchen is the closest that deodorant is to me.<n><n>### Examination for 2/17/2017<n><n>

For each value of n, print out the 3rd letter of the word MONSTER (M, O, and E).<n><n>- Programming Question 2: Write a Python program to print out 10 of the 15 lines from a text file, if n = the line number that I want to print, and then print them, in the file.  If n is not a line number that I want, print nothing.  Use n = 8 to try your code.<n><n>- Programming question 3: Write a Python program which reads three numbers from standard input (i.e. your command prompt) and then takes the first number and triple it and adds two to it. Then the program should read the second number and triple it and add two to it and the program should print out the largest of the three numbers.<n><n>- Program 4: In your script, use the following commands: Create a Python program that asks for n from the student’s standard input and then prints out the nth term of a sequence. In your program, assume n = 3, your program should print out 1,3,6,10.  Then, assume n = 4, your program should print 1,4,7,10 … and so on.  In your program, when n is equal to some specific number, have your program print out the corresponding term of the sequence.  Example: when n = 3, print out 1, if n = 4, print out 1 and 4.<n><n>- Program question 5: Write a Python program in which you ask for two integers from the student’s input and then add the two integers together and multiply the result times the smaller of the two integers.  After you have multiplied the two integer together, then you take the result and multiply it<n>by the larger of the two integers. You then print out both the original calculation and the multiplication of the result by the larger of the two<n>integers.  Show both the original calculation and then the multiplication of the result. For instance, if n = 10 and m = 4, I want<n>my program to print out 25.6 as the original answer and then

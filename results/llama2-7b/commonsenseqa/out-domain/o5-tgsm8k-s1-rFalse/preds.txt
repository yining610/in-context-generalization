If you can't get the output you need with the first algorithm that you write, you need to design a new version that meets the necessary requirements.  Write a response that explains how you would modify your algorithm to provide a solution.<n><n>### Sample Test:<n>The banking program asks the user to enter the customer's savings account balance.  Your first choice of programming language is the Excel formula to calculate the customer's interest for a month.  Your manager asks you, "Does Excel calculate the interest using the monthly accrual method, or using the end-of-month accrual method?"<n><n>### Your Answer:<n>Microsoft Excel formulas work off of the data entry date.  It doesn't matter what the month is because it works with a specific date like the 15th of June.  They don't use the beginning of the month or the end of the month that is why excel is not good enough to calculate interest.<n><n>### Another Choice<n>You work for a bank and you use Excel formulas to calculate customer balances.  One month, after your calculation of a customer's balance, you discover that your calculation was incorrect.  After double checking that your formula is correct, you suspect that the problem is because of how you formatted your date. Your manager asks you, ''Why does my formula not work?''<n><n>### Your Response:<n>You suspect that the problem is that the formulas work off of the date.  The month will not start on the first day of January so the formula will not function properly on the first day of the month because the date already exists in the date of January.<n><n>### An alternative choice<n>You work for a software company and you help a customer solve the algorithm problem

The old record is an average score per player of 287 per round. Each team has 4 players and there are 10 rounds in the season. Through the first 9 rounds, his team has scored a total of 10,440. How many points less than the current league record per game average is the minimum average they need to score, per player, in the final round to tie the league record?<n>Answer: 27<n><n>### Input:Sometimes fighting inflation isn't even what, because it is so negligible? Choices:  A: economic instability B: not noticeable C: spend more D: rising interest rates E: boring<n><n>### Response:		<n>When talking about inflation, it is generally said that inflation is the increase in prices of the goods and services available in the economy. The causes of inflation are often divided into three categories: demand-pull, cost-push, and built-in inflation. Demand-pull inflation results from high (aggregate) demand and/or low supply. Cost-push inflation occurs when costs of resources, such as labor or raw materials increase. Built-in inflation occurs when the government requires cost-of-living adjustments to wages and prices. The goal of government inflation measures is to keep the overall increase in prices moderate, avoid the destabilizing effects of inflation (uncertainty, market fluctuations), and prevent any negative consequences of deflation or disinflation.<n><n>### InputSometimes fighting inflation may not be as easy as one would think? Choices: A: it may not always work B: the fight may be very challenging C: it can be challenging to keep inflation rate down to moderate value D: the fight may not always be possible for everyone<n><n>### Response<n><n>There are many different ways to fight against inflation and to prevent the economy moving toward an inflationary situation. Some of the ways include reducing money supply, increasing money supply, controlling interest rates, and controlling the trade balance. Money supply is basically the total value of money available in the economy in different forms such as money in circulation, bank deposits, credit cards, etc. In case the inflationary pressure intensifies, the central banks should reduce money supply in order to contain further inflation as it does not help to solve the problem but instead, it makes the problem worse since money supply will be out of control and the level of interest rates will go down. On the other hand, there is no solution to inflation which is so high that we could say it is an emergency situation, but it is possible to stop it, which can only be achieved by reducing money supply to moderate levels.<n><n>### Answer:<n>In order to keep inflation under control, the central bank will need to raise the interest rates. If the interest rates go up, the cost of borrowing money will go up as well which will result in lower demand for various goods since people will have less money to spend on these goods. This in turn will bring the inflation down and prevent it

Choices:  A: indiana B: england C: outside D: on the wall E: picture<n><n>### Response:		B<n><n>### Instructions:<n>The first thing students must do in a lab is record the data. In the same way, teachers must record the students’ performance and make necessary comments on lab report writing.<n><n>### Observation:<n>1. The student used a tape to fix his hair.<n><n>### Answer:<n>This is one of the methods of assessing students. To begin, ask yourself questions, such as- What was the student doing? Or what did the lab report help the student know? After you’ve answered the question, begin to record the student’s response into the lab report.<n><n>### Explore:<n>You can also explore the answer and then record it. However, it may not be wise to try your hand on lab report writing. First, you need to know what you must record, then look for the answer, then record it. If the student recorded the wrong answer, the teacher can explain.<n><n>### Question:<n>A: Can you observe another student performing a lab?<n>If so, what is that student doing?<n><n>### Answer<n>When it comes to data entry on lab report writing, you must consider where the data is entered. The data may be manually input or computerized. To have accurate lab report writing, manually insert the information. But if the students record data, you can either record it manually or computerized. Computerize to save time and make the process easier.<n><n>### Conclude:<n>You concluded the student's report. For a lab report to be good, it should reflect the student’s knowledge. If you wrote this as a student, how would you feel?<n><n>### Ask:<n>If you were a student, what would you ask the teacher to do on your report?<n><n>### Comment:<n>If the students ask you such questions, do not give vague responses. This is important because lab report writing is the first step in the learning process where students write reports based on their experiences with data.<n><n>### Data Entry:<n>Students often record data in an inappropriate manner. To record the data of lab report writing accurately, students must record it as it happens. If the student makes the recording, it will be incorrect because he will misinterpret the statement or even forget some part.

So, A is the answer.<n><n>### Input:`Aaron used 12 marbles when he went to the toy store.`<n><n>### Response:`12`<n><n>### Input`Aaron uses 2 marbles when he goes to the toy store. He also uses 25 marbles.`<n><n>### Demosntration:<n>Bring the variables to an equivalent expression.<n><n>### Response`37`<n><n>### Explanation:<n>In the first expression,  `12`, the numbers 12 used will be replaced by variables `Aaron` to bring it to an equivalent expression. For the second expression,  25,  `25` numbers will be replaced by variables Aaron to make it an equivalent expression. In the first expression, we know `Aaron` used a total of 12 marbles. But we do not know the values of `Aaron`. Therefore, what happens is the numbers 12 will be added to the numerator, and all the other factors that were used, will be subtracted from denominator. In the second expression, the numbers used are `2` and `25 ` so in order to bring it to equivalent expressions, we have to bring their values to a common denominator which in this case `3`, then we take `2` and subtract `2` from numerator to bring it to `0`, and do the same for `25` to bring it to `24`. So, the values `12` and the `24` will be brought to common denominator to make `37` equivalent expression.<n><n>

The response will be an answer that does meet the criteria for one of the answer options.<n><n>### Solutions<n>Option A<n>Let's call this input _solitary_, using its literal meaning. We'll use single quotes around it to make it clearer that the literal word is being used.<n>The crowd wasn't what can better be called a _''solitary''_ group of people.<n><n>Option B<n>Let's call the input _small group_ and use single quotes to make the meaning of the term clear.<n><n>The crowd wasn't that large, just a _''small''_ group of people<n><n>Option D<n>Choose _solitude_.

They looked alone, but the group was small.<n><n>We could make this response even shorter even though it sounds odd but we know from the question above that we could use a plural form instead of a singular form.<n>The crowd wasn"'t so large. They were alone, in solitude, but the group was a small one.<n><n>Option E<n>We can only choose _solitary_ for the input.<n><n>The crowd was not that big.

Choices:  A: measure distance B: england C: office D: drawer E: desk<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The correct answer is a:measure distance<n><n>### Justification:<n>Since distance can only be measured, and multiple rulers are owned by different persons, therefore, it can be found in the office.<n><n>### Input - 8:<n>When I go shopping, I take my phone card so I can buy what I want.  If I buy 2.5 items and I spent a total of $15, how many items did I buy?<n><n>### Response - 8:<n>There are a few different ways of doing this, but because the question is about a phone card, I'm going to represent our spending dollars with dots, and the dots in a phone card will represent the spending units, the number of items I bought.  So, because I spent my 15 on two and a half items, the number of dots should be 8 and a half, so it's 5,9.<n><n>### Justifications:<n>In the phone card it said that there are $15 on it, so it represents 15 dots.  On the phone card there are 8 dots, so multiplying 15 by 8, what we get is 120, the total of the price of the two and a half items.

Choices:  A: full stomach B: getting full C: gaining weight D: sick E: satisfaction<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The correct answer is D.<n><n>### Input<n>You are trying to decide when to hire a nanny so that you can keep your daughter home from daycare as long as possible. The problem is: it costs 68 dollars to take her to daycare during the week, and on monday 12, it costs $5 to walk to school, and on Friday it costs $2 to get picked up. However, each time her parents work from home they get 11 dollars less each, and for each night that she stays with her grandparents they get 7 dollars extra. You get to work from home on Wednesdays, and your daughter sometimes has school on Monday or Friday. To maximize your earnings, what's the best schedule that you could have?<n><n>### Response<n><n>The correct answer should be D.<n><n>The first thing that I noticed was that the given schedule only allowed for 5 days a week.  Secondly, it said that there were no school days, but it said that it costs $2 to take her to school on the day of Friday.  The question was to take her from home to school (not the reverse). Because she always goes to school on Monday and Friday, those costs do not matter. If school is out on Monday or a Wednesday, then she will not take the $5 or $2 trip.  The answer is best determined after seeing that we can take into account what happens on weekends.<n><n>### Assignment:1.

Choices:  A: cabinet B: computer printer C: suitcase D: office supply store E: artist's studio<n><n>### Response:		<n>Let's begin with large pieces of paper that aren't for sale. A) A cabinet would not be a place to find paper that is not for sale, because the drawers in the cabinet are not for sale. B) You probably couldn't find paper that is not on sale in a computer printer, since the printer likely has the capacity to have paper for sale. C) You might be able to find paper for sale in a suitcase, but suitcases are not necessarily very large. D) An office supply store would likely have paper for sale or even large pieces of paper, but they would not necessarily be large pieces of paper that were not for sale. E) An artist's studio is a more likely place to find large pieces of paper that not for sale, because they typically aren't purchased in bulk. Thus, they would have to be purchased for use in the studio, and that would be the case whether the paper was being used to make art or merely used as large pieces of paper.<n><n>### Input #2: <n><n>Two students are on a ski trip with 59 other students.

Choices:  A: speak freely B: happiness of a child C: care for children D: school child E: control children<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>In the instruction it states that a parents duty is to care for children. The instruction has chosen D for option E, but choice D is incorrect.<n><n>The primary purpose is to care for children because as a parent, children are under your care and you are their guardian. Without a parent, children will be left in the streets and will run away from their home where they'll suffer hardships on the street. Children under the care of adults, parents or guardian are more safe and secure than on the street where they might get kidnapped or molested. By raising a child, parents are responsible and accountable to the government or the authority and will be responsible if any harm caused to the child that was in their care.<n><n>The parents have other duties too, such as giving them good education and provide them with a home. It is not enough to just care for them, as their welfare must be taken into consideration. Good education is important when growing up, with or without the help of parents, as they can still find a job when they grow up.

How long does the project take them together if Jack works, on average, 12 times slower than his friends do their homework?<n><n>### Response The project takes 3 hours for each of their friends to do. Jack works 12 times slower. That means he takes 3 hours to finish his homework. Total time equals the amount of time he took plus the amount of time his friends took. Total Time = Jack's homework + each of his friends' homeworks. Total time equals 3 (Jack's homework took 3 hours in total) plus 4 hours (Jack's friends did their homework at a faster pace). Total time equals 3 + 4.  Since 3 + 4 equals 7 and that's the answer. Jack + each of his friends did 7 hours of homework in total and finished in 3 hours.<n><n>### A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. You have $0.05 in your pocket.

Choices:  A: michigan B: new york C: amsterdam D: venice E: bridge<n><n>### Response:		<n>E<n><n>### Input<n>A person has a small, square farm covered with grass.  They put a few seeds in each of nine equal-sized patches.  When the seedlings sprout, each patch needs to grow tall enough to see above the others’ tops.  The whole garden must cover at least 40 square feet.  What is the largest space possible that 12 equal-sized flower beds could fit in the garden?<n><n>### Response<n><n>Input:A few seeds in each equal-sized patch needs to grow tall above the others.<n>The size of the smallest patch can be calculated by the same equation. The size of the smallest patch is equal to the size of the largest patch divided by the number of equal-sized patch.<n><n>Since the equation a+ b = c holds, we can say that 40 squared = n, whereby n is the number of square feet.<n><n>Hence, n = 40, n = 1600, and the size of the smallest patch required that can fill in an area of 1600 and still be equal to the others is 160.<n><n>Hence the largest space possible that can fit 12 equal-size flower beds in the garden has an area of 19,200, and the garden can be of dimensions 160 feet by 120 feet.<n>

You want to go to a store that is 10 miles from the city center. There's another store 22 miles from your current position. In order to visit both stores in one day, should you go today or will you save the other store for tomorrow?<n><n>### Demostration:<n>Input: _You_ are 50 miles _from_ the _center_ of the _nearest_ city. _You_ want to go _to_ a store _that is 10 miles_ from the _city center_. There's another store _22 miles_ from your current position. <n>Answer: It would be better to go today, 22 miles.<n><n>#### The First part of the math:<n><n>Today, to the the store 22 miles away, means there are now 8 miles to travel between your position and the center of the nearest town.  You can achieve this travel in half a day, but you would not be able to make it to the other store (if you travel 50 miles one way, it'll take you a day).<n><n>Tomorrow, to the store 22m, makes a total of travel of 49 miles, meaning there are no extra miles to travel after you've completed reaching the other store.  So we'd have to assume that after you complete the other store, you start towards your home.  So in this scenario we know it would take you two days to complete both trips.<n> <n>For instance: <n><n>```javascript<n>10 miles in 1 day<n>+ 22 miles in 1 day (today, 10 miles is done)<n>= 32 miles in 2 days.<n>```<n><n>You can't accomplish 49 miles in 2 days, so the best solution, is to go to the store _today_.<n>

Discuss.<n><n>Besides learning how to write functions, the reason I enjoy writing code and learning how to write better code using algorithms is to solve problems.  I know when I am doing good work when I get to a solution and don't feel like I did any work for hours.  Doing it the right way also helps me in future work.  I never want to have problems when I am doing projects, I know I put a lot of time and research into my project to guarantee those problems will never appear again.  I enjoy solving problems by using functions because I believe I use a more efficient method of programming as I am building towards the future (and not trying to re-invent the wheel).<n><n>```text<n>To improve my ability to write better code, I must take time to review the code of other programmers.  The more practice I get the more my style of coding will evolve.  I learned about function reviewing this week.  I have never practiced

How many total kids are being babysat?<n><n>### Input is invalid if<n>Babysit for someone under 12? <n><n>> ## Note on answers from the Internet<n>In this workshop we are working on completing and debugging code to make a computer do the job for us, and not using the computer like a calculator, which is how most programs will fail (you can always use your calculator if you need help with a math problem). When you test a program, you should be writing programs that are going to answer questions or solve problems, not the type of programs on the Internet (like the ones I show in this workshop). You can only write a program that will successfully complete all the steps when they are input as data. <n><n>It is unlikely, however that you will find a good set  of data or instructions on the Internet with exactly the same characteristics as your exercise. That is one reason the Internet data is probably no help.  For example in my question about the number of legs on an animal, I specified an animal that has 2 legs and 4 legs, so it is unlikely that there would be data on the Internet with two kangaroo's and 3 goats.<n><n>Another difficulty is that in the Internet data, it is easy to find answers that are good approximations but not always as accurate as the data in the exercises. They're not always wrong but the answers in the internet data can often change depending on the time of day, the traffic to that page and many other things out of our control. Some day later on a different computer it might not work at all. <n>

I can share 12 with my brother.  I can share them evenly with my brother for dinner tonight.  I still have 3 apples left over.  How many apples did I originally have in my possession exactly?<n><n>### Response<n>Response: Input: I have 29 apples.  I have 3 apples remaining now.  I used the apples and didn't end up with one of anything.  So I had 30 apples.  This is exactly the number of apples I started with. If I gave up 4 to a family member I would still have 26.

Of those who got a perfect score on the test, after one year how much of an increase did their score have compared to those who got a 50%?<n>Answer: I get confused by how to order the variables.  For example do I add them together as a ratio and divide again or do I subtract the number of perfect scores by 140 and then divide by that number to get the percentage?<n><n><n>

We eat food and produce energy, or \u201cburn\u201d it, which is then given off as heat. However, we also maintain a constant body temperature, around 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. This heat is given off as we are active. As this activity continues, we do something to get rid of the waste heat. This requires extra energy, which requires fuel\u2014more food\u2014to produce more heat. Rubner therefore proposed balance equations that would let us determine what we eat based on how much burning would occur from our activity and maintaining body heat. \n \nWe use Calories to model body heat and activity. Our activity is expressed as Calories burned per hour. We would normally calculate how long we work to exhaustion to model Calories burned. This model may not be applicable if your activity level is constantly changing.\n  \nLet Calories = (Activity in Calories)+(Body heat in Calories)\n  \nActivity = (Fuel in Calories)/  (Body heat in Calories + Fuel in Calories)\n \nBody heat  =  0.75*(Activity in Calories)\nFuel = Body heat + Body weight * Burn rate\nFuel burn rate = 0.3 Cal/kg/min\n \nBurn rate also applies to physical work:\nphysical work = (Fuel used in Calories) / (time used in minutes)\n \nFor these questions, choose the answer that reflects the order of magnitude of the answer, regardless of precision.\n  \n \nInput:In 30 minutes, Max climbs a total of 600 metres.

One will be used as a data type that will hold two items which the other will be used for counting down time. One item will contain a quantity and one an amount. The class which will be creating the time down task will be implementing a CountDown object.\n\n### Exercise 1\nCreate a class called Items. The class will contain two properties. The first, quantity, will hold a numeric type. The second property, amount, will hold a string type.\n\n```javascript\nclass Items {\n  constructor(quantity, amount) {\n    this.quantity = quantity;\n    this.amount = amount;\n  }\n}\n```\n```javascript\n{\n  quantity: 12,\n  amount: $200\n}\n```\n\n### Exerciser 2\nCreate a class called CountDown. The first two parameters will be a constructor which will receive a CountDown object which will have a CountDown object as the paramater. You will then return an error if the constructor receives a wrong input. The constructor will then take a counter and pass the counter to the constructor. The constructor will make use of the CountDown. The end result of the constructor will pass the total to the initial constructor and the total to the return value.\n\n```javascript \nfunction CountDown(countDown) {\n  if (countDown === undefined) {\n    return \"An invalid countdown object was passed to the function\"\n  }\n  else {\n    this.totalCount = countDown;\n    this.countDown = calculateCountDown();\n  }\n} \n\nfunction calculateCountDown() {\n  return (Math.abs(new Date().getTime() - this.startDate - (new Date().getFullYear() * 1000 + new Date().getMonth() * 10 + new Date().lengthDay)) / this.duration)\n}\n\nclass CountDown { \n  constructor(duration, startDate) { \n    this.duration = duration;\n    this.totalSeconds = 0;\n    this.startDate = startDate;\n    this.secondsLeft = calculateTotalSeconds() \n  }\n}   \n```\n```javascript       \n// this function will return a", "answer": "A: florida"}

This is another concept I strongly recommend you to learn about.\n\nThe example below takes in 'n' and returns the 'n'th Fibonacci number recursively.\n```javascript\nfunction fibonacci(n){\n    if(n < 2) return n;\n    if(n == 2) return 1;\n    if( n == 3) return 2;\n    fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n - 2);", "answer": "A: tennessee"}

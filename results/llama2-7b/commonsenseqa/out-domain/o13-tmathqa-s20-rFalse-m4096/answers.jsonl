The cow takes 29 hours to walk there, and you leave early, returning with the cow at 11 AM. The cowboy picks up his mail, which takes 7 hours.  The town postman takes 13 minutes to deliver your mail, and the road home is an even 25 minutes.  If the cow takes 23 minutes to walk home with you, how much time did it take you to get home, including walking to and from work, biking, and time on the road? Choices:  C:19:19:06 hours of time, or you can add 14 hours because he took half of the walk for the cow and you can add the walk for the cow + 7 hours for the postman and the 24 + 7 + 42 = 73 minutes for the cowboy? E: I think D is correct since the cowboy goes to town (14 minutes) to get his mail (7 hours), which is 21 minutes. He then takes the extra 41 minutes (23 + 19 + 24) back home. Then + 7 + 14 = 35 + 13 = 48, or 88 + 7 = 95, or 91:39:12 B: 19:22:22 E: 36:36:22 A\nOutput: A", "answer": "D: get arrested"}

However, when you find a red apple and an orange, compare the color of the orange to the green and red apple. If they are both red, then place them to the side. If either the apple or orange is green, then you have found your match. C. Keep comparing the apples to one another. When you find a red apple place it to the side along with every red apple you have already found. Then continue comparing the apples to the orange and repeat the same process. Do not place oranges to the side until you find one that is either the same color as a red apple or one of the same color that you have placed to the side. D.

To do so, You should call the function divis (n, x) with as input 2 and an integer (x).\n\nFor example the call:\ndivis(5,20)/\n\nYou should start by finding out the prime factorization of 2. To do so, You could call divis(2, 5).\n\nInput: You should input an integer x and a number n. After the call, the function should then return the prime factorization of n.\n\nThe prime factors of 2 are 1 and 2. So, the function should return the string \"(\" followed by a list of all the prime factors of x. Excluding the ones already returned.\n\nFor example:\ndivis(10, 20) /\n\nShould return the string: \"(\" and the list \"2, 10\". Excluding the first string result: \"(\"\n\nBut don't worry if you forget this example and just get the string.\n\nExample:\ndivis(6,20)/\nshould return both \"(\" and the list (2, 3), because 6 = 2*3. (12, 3)\n\nAfterwards you should call the function that many times as you want.\n\nFor example you call again divis(5,20). In this scenario, x equals to 4 and n equals to 20. This means that the result should be the empty string () followed by all the prime factors of 20.\n\nFor the 3rd example you should only call divis(4,20) and you should receive \"(\" and the list \"(2)\"\n\nSo in", "answer": "A: look at"}

You are to compare the vehicles in the input data that travel at the same speed. Write a program that does so by sorting the input and using the compareTo( ) method of the Comparator. The vehicles are initially sorted in ascending order using the natural ordering by their speeds.The compareTo( ) method must first compare the speeds of the given vehicles, and return a negative number if the vehicle going slower comes first. If the speeds are equal, the compareTo( ) must then compare the make and model of the two vehicles. The compareTo( ) method should then sort the vehicles that travel the same speed in descending order.Here is an example usage of the compareTo( ) methods of the classes Vehicle and Car: Car c1 = new Car(\"Honda\", \"Civic\");c2 = new Car(\"Toyota\", \"Celica\");ArrayList theList = new ArrayList();c1.put(\"0.8\");c2.put(\"1.8\");theList.add(c1);theList.add(f2); theList.add(c3);theList.add (c4);theList.add(\"5\");Collections.sort(theList,new Comparator() {public int compareTo(Object a,Object b) {return Integer.parseInt((String) a).compareTo(Integer.parseInt((String) b)); } });System.out.println (theList); This printed: [c2, c3, c1, c4, null]", "answer": "E: motorcycle"}

So we have 8 + 2 = 10\nAnd we continue adding values by the next digit. We know the target is 72 so we take 10, and multiply it by 9. Which gives us (10 x 9 = 90) and we take the remainder mod 9, which gives us the number of values in each group which is 1 + 5 + 4 or 10 values (We are not including 52 because it is not between 48 and to 72!) and we got our answer\n\nThis is how I used the Sieve of Eratosthene algorithm in my solution:  \nhttps://projecteuler.net/problem=1", "answer": "A: addiction"}

If there are consecutive buses at an interval of 18 min, the ithe bus arrives at the same position as the 18th bus. So the arrival interval is equal to the time between two consecutive buses.\n\nB. The speeds of the cyclist and the bus need to be equal.\n\nLet us assume that there are 40 buses. The total time between two consecutive bus is 10 min. Then we will see that the arrival interval is 10 \u00f7 40 = 25 min. So the speed of the bus is equal to the arrival of the bus at that spot over the travelled distance from there. We need to understand the distance travelled in 25 \u00f7 10 = 2.5 hrs. So the travelling distance is 25 \u00f7 ( 10 \u00f7 (10 \u00f7 25 ) ) = 25. This distance means 60 km. So the speed of any bus is 60 \u00f7 2.5 = 24 km / hr.\n\nC. Let us assume 37 is 200 and 42 is 240 m. Then if it is a square the area of the field is 200 \u00f7 240 = 2 \u00f7 3 square feet. Now if you apply Pythagoras theorem on the 90 \u00ba trianglet, then you will have 75 \u00f7 135 = 1 \u00f7 3 triangle and a trapezoid with sides 2 + 8 feet.\n\nD. The sum of numbers can be increased if you take more of the cheaper option. That is the solution.\n\nE. The solution is ( 4 \u2013 2 ) / 1 = 2.\n\nF. 640 \u00f7 200 = 3.

It will be easiest if the list is in sorted order. Write your program as a recursive function with two parameters. The first parameter will be the starting index, and the second will be the last index. A function will be called with these parameters every time the list needs to be divided in half.  You should print out the median in each case.\nNote: You cannot use any global variables, so no arrays are allowed. You must write your program in a way where all the values that make up the list are stored inside your own variables.\n\nExample:\n(The problem begins with the integer list below, a.k.a., a linked list.)\n>5.1  4.42  |  3.22  |  2.25  1.52\n\nFor this problem, if you find the value in the middle, you get the answer 3.22. Then, since you have found the middle, it is time to divide the list in half. You call the function. The next time you find the middle value, it will return 2.25. This value is stored in a variable. At this point, you divide the list in half one more time between the middle and end. You now call the function in the same way as before, but the middle is 1.52. You find the middle value again and print it out.\n\nScoring Notes:\nThis problem will take the longest to type out, and it will be the most challenging to debug. Use this challenge to test your knowledge of recursion.\n\nInput:a linked list is shown below. write a recursive function that will print out the middle element in this list. You should pass the start index (or beginning of the list) and the end (the last index) as parameters so you can control where your program searches in the list and prints. Do not try to print out elements out without printing out the middle of the list.\n\na.k.a.\n7.2", "answer": "B: have fun"}

Now if 3n:4n = n:2n, then we can replace ratios 3k:4k = k:2k. Plugging in for k, we get 3k:2k = k. This would give us the solution of 3k:2 = k. \n\nNow, if we plug in k=30, we get 30:2 = 15. Next if we plug in 30 for k in the next ratio, then we get k=2. Therefor it should be n=15, and the other number would be n=2.\n\n> **24.

We will then find out answer in two parts. So, in first one, we will only find out addition. In the second part subtraction. a student would first try for addition. b) we will only find out answer in two different ways. By addition & subtracttion. So a student can use any of them c) we should find out that for \"578+592\" we should use \"Addition\", we'll have to put <3>(578+589). Now the answer comes up, as 2,3,5.

Since the factors are very very high you need to go for a brute force method. Which means you find prime factor by trying all number between 1 to 100,000.\n\nThe code is really straightforward and as you can see I haven\u2019t even made any use of modulo. So what does that mean, the answer will remain same even if we multiply by a negative number. The brute force method is better for questions that you know the output will not be 0, 1 or 2.\n\nIf we consider the example of \u201cthe man cycling along the way\u201d then we want to find the time between two consecutive buses so we don\u2019t know the starting number of buses, so we will start from 1 and then increase the number by each second till we reach to 6 as \u201cthe time between the buses is every six minutes\u201d.\n\nThis is really a basic question and in my opinion its not a part of competitive programming. What we have learned as the part of CS is to be simple and logical and brute force is the best example of such a method!\n\nSo as for today\u2019s lesson, the question is really fun! Its really hard and very interesting.\n<mark>\nPlease leave any feedback or questions down below.\n</mark>\n\nThank you for taking out time to read this!", "answer": "E: solar system"}

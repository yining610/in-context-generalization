The water drops may obstruct the field of the view for the car\u2019s driver or passenger. There may also be cracks in the windshield since the glass is very fragile. \n\nAnswer B is incorrect because wiping off a car\u2019s windshield in a rain storm is not effective.

{"text": "The answer is that you could hear a bassoon played at an unpleasing fashion in the high school band.\n\n### Answer:\n\nThe bassoon is a woodwind instrument, and high school bands typically have woodwind instruments which would allow for a bassoon to be played loudly in a concert.\n\n### Rationales:\nThe bassoon is the only woodwind instrument that is a member of the double-bass family. This means that the bassoon has reeds which are made of the same material as in orchestral reeds.\nA reed is a thin piece of material that plays an important roll in producing sound through their vibrations.\nOrchestra bassons are typically tuned like orchestral reeds, but are much larger and heavier as they are used to produce lower notes than orchestral reeds by having a deep cup or cup-like sound chamber.\n\nHigh school bands, especially large ones, can have members playing orchestral bassons which would be very loud to produce their low notes.\nThe large amount of members usually mean that the orchestra will be loud, thus allowing them to compete with one another and play together cohesively.\nMost symphonies will use bassons from the 90's so some of them may not have a basson that is made for a symphony. This is because many symphony bassons are made for orchestras, so they may not be able to compete with them.\nTherefore, the best place to find a basson and see a basson being played at an unpleasant fashion would be a high school band.\nAnswer: B\n\n    ### Input:\nIf John wants to get to Tom\u2019s house, he knows the distance from his house to Tom\u2019s house is 270 feet.

{"text": "D\n\n### Instructions:\n\n### Input Instructions:\nThe question asks \"Where could a printer be use by thousands of people?\". These are all places for printers to be used. The printers could either be a personal printer that is at the home office, or printers at the school office, the store, newspaper office, or printers used by tens of users at the print shop.\n### Demonstraion:\n\n### Step 1: Detect the Input\nA program is instructed to recognize the user's input, or \"detect\" the input. The question is asking about the types of printers. The program may need to display a list where each box represents a scenario along with the numbers of printers used in that scenario. When the user chooses, the user selects the scenario that is true, and the program then displays how much printers are in that scenario. For example: There could be a store that has 5 printers and a newspaper office that uses 1,000, but if the person enters that the scenario \"printer at a school office\" it will not match the input.\n### Step 2: Interpret Input\nThis is basically to explain how the input was interpreted such that the user knows why the response was provided. A program would normally tell the user what the user entered, but it should explain if the user is incorrect. For example: If the user selects option A, there are not thousands of printers in the Home Office, or at a school, therefore the correct option is option D, the Printers at a Newspaper office can be used by thousands. Another example: If the user chooses option E and the program doesn't know of the Newspaper office, it could explain that if option E is meant to be \"Print Shop\" the correct option is option C, thousands of users can use a print shop. (Note: option B would not be correct according to the question because \"personal printer at house\" does not have a hundred thousand users).\n### Step 3: Provide the Output.\nThis step tells the user that it is incorrect and provides the correct answer. For example: If a user selects option E and the program has not heard of the Newspaper Office, then it would say that the answer to this scenario is option D and tell the user to select it.\n\n#Input", "answer": "A: school"}

A friend of yours is visiting the gallery. Your friend is in the gallery for 4 hours and comes across a red picture, a blue picture, anda brown picture. What is the least number of pictures your friend saw in the gallery?\nRationales : The question is asking for how many pictures your friend saw in total. You need the total number of blue and red pictures as well to know this information. The question gives that your friend saw a red picture, a brown picture, and a blue picture. The red picture gives 2 possibilities for the picture. Your friend saw 2 red pictures, or he didn't see any red pictures. He saw 3 pictures, two red and one blue, or he saw 4 pictures, with 2 red and 2 blue. For the brown picture, you have two possibilities for brown pictures as well. Your friend saw two brown pictures, or he didn\u2019t see a brown picture. That means that he saw 3 pictures, 2 red and 1 blue or he saw 5 pictures, 2 red, 2 blue, and 1 brown. The question doesn't give total number of pictures the gallery contains. Therefore, you have to estimate how many blue and red pictures are there. Then subtract 5 from the estimate, since blue + red = 5. So, in order to find the least number of pictures, you need to sum the red, blue, and brown pictures as well. You need 2 + 1 + 2 to be a number smaller than 5, which is 5 - 2. Then the estimate for the total number of pictures is 2 + 1 = 3. Then the solution is that your friend saw 3 pictures in total.

I predict that if George Bush is elected, the average income of the top three U.S. industries will be $105.62 per year; and, if Al Gore is elected, the average will be $55.77 per year. George Bush is elected; my prediction was off by $2.81. If Al Gore is elected; my prediction is off by $18.40. According to my prediction, what is the difference (in dollars) for every additional $1,500 billion dollars of Gross Domestic Product between Al Gore and President Bush? Assume there are enough GDP to fill $1,501.38 billion tax rate for the year.\nRationales: According to the problem I predict that if George bush is elected the average income will be  $105.44 per year. and if Al Gore is ELECTED, the average income will be $55,77 per year. So if Al Gore is Elected then my prediction was $18.42 off.  So Al Gore's average Income was $72.43 less than George Bush average income.

{"text": "A: vomiting\n\n\n### Input - Rationale:A father has three sons named Jake, Kevin, and Matthew. Jake is 5 years old and was born the day after February 29 in a year that was divisible by 4. Kevin is 7 years old and was born in a year with an odd number of months. Matthew is 9 years old and his birthday is in June and is divisible by 15. What month is Matthew's birthday?\n\n### Rationales:  The order has already been given, so it is logical to work backwards.\n\nFirst, figure out when Kevin is born so it would give the month he's born in.\n\nThis can be figured out by multiplying 2015 (which is the year he was born in) by the remainder of the divided year.\n\nIn this case, the remainder of the division would be 4, so it must be in the year 2015(4).\n\nIt would then be 2016 (the first year with an odd number months)\n\nTherefore, Kevin was born in February (odd number months).\n\nThen, we determine the month that Jake was born.\n\nThis is found by subtracting the birthdays of the other two sons from Kevin's birthday, which leads to March.\n\nNext, we find the month Matthew is in.\n\nThis is done by subtracting the months that Jake was born and Kevin was born from the number of months that Matthew was born in.\n\nTo do this, subtract the numbers that can be obtained from dividing 2 by 12 (since we found that Matthew's birthday is in June), which should be 5 and 7 (since he was born in 1993).\n\nThe rest of the division, 2/12, should remain as 1/6 (since 12 is the month of June).\n\nSince 1993 cannot be divided by 12 in multiple integers, the answer is found after the second integer.\n\nSince 12 is not divisible by 12, then the second set of integers from 1993, in this case, it would be the first integer which is 1: 1993/12 = 28 years of leap and", "answer": "D: contentment"}

In order to find out how much he bought of each, we have to divide it by it's corresponding number of bananas and bananas in each category\n5 bananas = potatoes and apples\n5 bananas = onions\n\n10 bananas = bananas\nAs can be seen, onions have 3x the amount of potatoes while bananas have 3x amount of potatoes and appples. Therefore, the question asks for the cost of Matthew's grocery store purchase.\n\nSince apples have 5x more potatoe they cost ($1 x 5) $5\n\nEach banana is equal to 10 potatomes and apples. For every 10 potatoes and apples he buys, he has to spend $5.\nNow, he is going to spend $5x5x7= $375 on the potatoes and apples.\nNow we add $375 to $380 to get $730\n\nAnswer: Matthew spent a total of $730 on the groceries he bought at the store.\n\nAnswer: $730", "answer": "A: tennis elbow"}

{"text": "The definition is \"the process by which organisms generate and replace their own kind through reproduction\" \"The word for it is reproduction\"\n\nThe reproduction cycle begins when the egg unites with the sperm and is created an embryo, once it develops into a baby that is born. Reproduction ends when a person no longer has the ability to reproduce.\n\n**The Rationales: Reproduction is the process by which organisms produce new organisms. Reproduction is critical because it helps ensure that each group of living things gets to continue and thrive with new generations.\nThe term reproduction comes from the Latin word repraesentare, literally meaning \"to represent again.\"\nReproduction is the creation of organisms from other organisms. It can happen between organisms of the same species (like the reproduction of new dogs from existing dogs) or between different species (for example, reproduction of new dogs between parents of different species).\nReproduction begins with the creation of the egg. After the egg has been fertilized by the sperm and has developed into a baby that is brought into the world, reproduction ends.\nWhen an egg is fertilized by a sperm (this could either be from the person's spouse or from another person), the egg develops into a baby and leaves the mother's reproductive system.\nAfter the baby is born, reproduction stops. The baby has its own reproductive system, which can produce sperm or eggs.\nWhen females are old enough to have babies, they have been \"willing\" to reproduce with a partner at some point in their reproductive lives. Likewise, when males are old enough to have offspring, they have been \u201cwilling\u201d to reproduce with a reproductive partner.\n\n### Input 569x+115=36\n\n\n### Response\nThe first digit needs to be 6 because 7+1=8 so 569 needs to be 576.

If the length of pictograph A is 2 feet greater than pictograph B, what length is pictograph A?\n\n### Response:(See the image for a diagram.)\n\nFirst, identify the length of each leg and the length of the base and then determine the area and the height of each of the pictographs.\n\nIn the first pictograph, a and b are the lengths of the two legs and e is the length of the base. Remember that there are only two angles.\n\nThe third angle (the two legs) is 90\u00b0 and 45\u00b0, which adds to 135\u00b0.\n\nThe fourth angle (the height of the second leg) is 90 because both legs are 30\u00b0 (from the diagram), and the fifth angle (the height of only the first leg) is 30\u00b0.\n\nThe third and fourth angles add to 120\u00b0, which gives you the area (120\u00b0 \u00d7 64).\n\nThe height you use is the total of the area (128 ft x 0.75) + the total area of the other pictograph (64 ft x 1.25) + the area of the base (64 ft x.50)\n\nAfter all these math is complete, you find that both answers are the same.\n\nAnswer: 210.07 feet\n\n### Input:-Craig has a box full of 33 bouncy balls that each weighs 4 grams and a box with 27 bouncy balls that weigh a total of 305 grams.What is the approximate total weight of both boxes full of balls?\n\n### Instructions:Answer this question.

B: When I went to the science museum, I was so interested in the exhibits, I almost forgot about the parking. C: Walking to the aquarium saved us $7.50. D: We saved $7.50 when we did not park at the aquarium.\nRationales:The answer is B. The text says \"Last summer, my family saved $7.5 by not parking at the aquarium\". This suggests that not all of the family went to the aquarium. They had an option of saving the money by walking to the aquarium. Thus the text implies that not all of the members of the family visited the aquarium, but some of them might have visited the science museum, that they enjoyed so much they wanted to keep an exhibit from there. Option A talks about anger, this must be about the family that went to the aquarium who had to pay $3 parking fee since they walked. Option D talks about saving $7.5. There is only $7.50 if all of the family visited the zoological park. So option D does not give reasonable inference. Option C is not reasonable. If all of the family visited aquarium, they would have spent at least $60, that is $7.50 per person. So option C does not give reasonable inference either. Option B talks about almost forgetting the parking, the money on the parking is spent in any case.

You take a tape measure and measure the width, then measure the length and then measure the height.

For a boat, you will be adding the areas of the hull of the boat (where the water is located) and the deck or the platform. \n\nFor the surface area of the hull:  length of the hull * width of the hull. Let the lengths be x and the widths be 2. The surface area of the hollow will be length of the hollow * width of the hollow. 2 * 2 = 4. Then you will add the two numbers 1+4 to get the answer 5. \n\nThe deck or the platform will be the part that connects to the boat that is out of the water. The deck will be measured in meters because it is a three-dimensional surface that it is a length, width, height.  You will add areas that are 3 dimensional.\n\nThe surface area of a boat will be the sum of the areas the two three-dimensional objects. \n\nThe boat has a surface area of 5.6m\u00b2, if the boat is 34m by 3.7m by 2.5m (m * m * m).

If this is to work, what is the largest whole number that the club can have on each team?\n\n### Answer:\nThe largest whole number is 6. The difference between 42 and 1 is 41. Therefore, the largest whole number would be 6.\n\n###Rationales:\n  The problem asks for the largest whole number that two teams can consist of. The problem also states that each team can have one more player than 42. Therefor, the largest whole number they can have on each team would be 2(42).\n\n### Input : Two and a half hours equals 164 minutes. What is that equal to in minutes?\n\n### Response\n\nSince 2 and a half hours it is 164 minutes, or 2 and a half times 30\n\n### Rationale:\nThe problem states two and a half hours means 2 times 30 and a half, or in all 164. It is asked for it in a minute, so what is 164 in 2 times 31 in a half?\n### Alternative solution:\nThe problem states 2 and a half equals 2 times 16 in a half, or 2 times 9 in a fifth, or 180 minutes.\n\n###Input:\n\nWhich of these can be more efficiently created or used?\nA. 300 square feet of floor space divided into two rooms\nB. 200 square meters of", "answer": "B: high school"}

{"text": "A\n\n### Rationale:\nA) A beauty salon is an example of a business that could be in a strip mall. Strip mall's contain several different stores and businesses and beauty salons are located in strip malls next to places such as dry cleaners and restaurants. Many of these businesses are located near each other, because they are all connected to attract more customers and make the area more convenient for shoppers. Strip malls are the closest type of commercial district to residential areas and businesses such as department stores and clothing stores can also be in strip malls.\n\nStrip malls are commercial districts that contain several different stores and other businesses. They get their name from the stores being located in a row (like clothes on a hanger) in a straight strip. Strip malls help make shopping convenient for shoppers because all of the necessary stores are located in one place. Strip malls contain many different businesses. Some examples would be grocery stores, pharmacies, restaurants and a variety of clothing stores.\n\nStrip Malls are often built, rehabilitated, and renovated to be attractive to consumers in order to entice more people to go inside. In other words, strip malls can be very eye-catching and include fancy stores to attract even more customers. Most strip malls include retail space that allows various vendors to sell products, but sometimes commercial offices are also placed there. Stores are often grouped into smaller segments which may be called mini-malls. \nMost strip malls are built to provide a more convenient shopping experience for customers. There are many stores combined into one location so shoppers do not have to go to numerous stores to get all of the items that they need. Many shopping centers are also built near parking lots and other shopping centers so that it can be an easy way to go to another store while still keeping things convenient. Strip malls were introduced in the 20th century as a way for retailers to save money on rent, utilities and other expenses by sharing operating costs, allowing the owners to invest in better products and advertising.", "answer": "C: clerk"}

This is because houses and libraries are both places were you can purchase food and then sit down to eat it at a table. A fast food restaurant is not a place were you can purchase food to eat at a table, so B is incorrect. \"Library\" is ambiguous as to whether or not it can purchase food to eat or if it is simply a reference library, so C is incorrect. A \"library\" would likely where you can purchase food from, so if we remove both B and C, only E \"conference\" is still left over, so A is incorrect. E is a place where you can get food to eat at a conference. However, it is not a place to purchase food. Therefore \"house\" is correct.\n\n#### Answer:\nConference, House \n\n### Input:\"I had a sandwich, cake, and cup of coffee today, which I bought from a house catering service. It was delicious!

However, the second sentence of the dialogue mentions that the food was bought from a house. Additionally, food is described as being thrown away, rather than given to a person eating there.\n\nWe can cross out every option but 4 because 5 is not mentioned in this dialogue, and 1 is mentioned as an option\nIn the second sentence, it states that someone was throwing things away after eating.\nThe choices left from above are:\n\nHouse: The person throwing away everything is at the same time who ate everything", "answer": "B: fast food restaurant"}

{"text": "A: Very Heavy\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\n## Input: For every 10 cans you recycle each week, you receive $0 and $1 for every kilogram of newspapers you bring in. If your family collected a total of 109 kilograms of newspapapers and 88 cans during the week, how much money would they receive?\n\n### Rationale: Step 1: To find the total number of can your family collected, divide the number of cans your family collected by 10. Then add 1 if necessary so that the final answer is a number divisible by 10.\n109 / 10 + 1 = 11, this is because 11 is divisible by 1 (the number can), 2 (the answer in decimal), 5 (the answer in binary), and 10 (the number cans. In order for the total number of can be 10, it needs to be divisible by 1, 5, and 10. So, 11 works)\n\nStep 2a: To find out how much money the family would get from recycling newspapers for every kilogram, find the quotient of the number of kilograms in newspaper that was brought into the recycling location by the number of newspaper that was bought for every 1 kilogram of newspapers. 109 (number of kilograms of newspaper that was brought in) / 10 (the amount of dollars for every kilogram of newspaper) = 10.9 (the number of dollars per kilo of newspapers)\n\nStep 3a: Recalculate the number of cans that the family collected by multiplying 10.9 by 53. This is because if you know how many cans your family collected, you can find out how many kilograms of newspaer they collected by divding the number of the cans by 744. Once you have a second number the same as the first, you can then multiply by 109, the new number you calculated in problem 2.\n10.9*53 = 563 (the number of cans and kilograms of newspapaer that the family collected)\n\nStep 4a", "answer": "D: card game"}

{"text": "The answer to the above question is choice A: charming. The charming place that you can find air that has been recently breathed by many people is a crowded place. Crowded places involve a lot of people. A crowd is basically a group of people that are coming to or leaving the same place. For example, crowds appear anywhere where a lot of people are going or leaving the place, like a school, market, park, or bus. The charming place is a house. The house is the place that is the largest and most comfortable, which we can take shelter from the cold or heat.

The coefficient of x in the first equation is -4 and the second equation is 2. \n\nIf a x a x a -4 -4 2 = a 2 -4 -4 3 then a would be 3. \n\nIf x a x a a 8 4 8 -4 -4 6 then a would be 6. \n\nIn the first equation y must be -8 since the first and second equations must be equal. \n\nTherefore the answer for this is x = 3 and y = 6. \n\t\n### Rational:What is the value of ( 5x^y )/(1\u20132x^3)^0.8?\n\n### Response:-0.5736 \n\n### RationaleThe parentheses tell us we should solve for a^y / a^z since that is the only term inside of the parentheses that is not a constant. Once we solve for a^y and plug a= 1 -2 x^3, we can now solve for (5x^(1 -2 x^z)). \n\nSince 5x^(1 - 2 x^z) = 5x^(1 \u20132) x x^z then 5x^(1-2) = 5x x^z, and 5 = 5x x^(1-2). Since x^(1-2) is a fraction with a denominator of x then 5 = 5(1-2) so 5(1- 2) =1 and 5x^(1\u20132) = x^(1\u20132). This lets us rewrite 5x^(1\u20142) x x^y as 5x^{(1\u20142) + y} and now we can solve 5x^{(1\u20132) + y} by first expanding the parenthesis to give us: 5x^2 x^(1\u20132) x x^ y =5x^(1-", "answer": "C: bound"}

The population of Y in 2106 = (the population of city x in 2007) x (110%/100%) = (0.11X), because the population of city x in year 1906 grew at a rate of 110% in 10 years.\n\n<b>:</b> The population or city y in 2001 is determined by multiplying 0.11(city x in 2207) by 100%.

You earn $4 for every 10 paintings you paint. If you earn $12 for the month, how much total was earned?\nRationales \nAnswer: 15\n\n### Rationale:\nTo calculate the total amount earned you need to do two things: You need to create two columns in your table, each one corresponding to one of the tasks you have from the instruction: \n1. Each time you read a book, you earned $5 dollars. Each time you earn $5, you need to add $5 in the right column of your table.  \nThe book that you earn $5 would be the tenth book. Let's count how many books did you earn $5 to find out.\n$$\n\\# Of books earned $5 = \\left(\\text{the total number of books you read}\\right) - 10\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Therefore } \\# = \\text{the total number books you read} - 10;\n$$\nYou will earn $5 at your tenth book. So you will count your $5 under $5 and continue to do so again.\n\n\nYou have earned $10 from books, so you will add the value $10 in column. You see it in the table.\n\n\n2. The next step, you calculate the total amount you have earned from painting.\n\nYou earned $4 for every painting therefore you will only fill your $4 values in column A and continue to do so.\nThe total number of painting would be\n$$\n\\text{(the total number of paintings you painted) - 10}\n$$\nThe total of $4 is $4 and the total of your paintings is $40.\n\nNow, let's check your answer.\n$$\n\\text{\"The total of the paintings was\"}\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA.  \\underbrace", "answer": "C: bite"}

Similarly, if there were three green apples, then, there would be either zero rede apples or two. So, answer(1,2 or 3) is the correct answer again.", "answer": "D: street"}

There was a little bit of each of these things happening among the two. What was lacking was time. There were long delays when there should have been quicker dialogue.

All three of these things were lacking and caused the project to not go as planned.\n\n### Input John spent most of his time communicating with James on a project in which they each had half of the tasks on each computer.

There was a question about dangers of traveling underwater and choice \"disorientation A\" was given as a choice. \"due to\" and \"getting somewhere\" would both be incorrect since \"due to\" describes a result and \"getting somewhere\" could either be reiterating the answer of the question or asking another question altogether. Finally, choices \"relocation\" and \"meeting new people\" would be incorrect because they both describe potential benefits.\n\nAnswer: Traveling underwater has dangers of getting disoriented.\nAnswer: Disorientation\n\n### Input:\"Coral reefs are beautiful ecosystems that contain an abundance of marine life. Unfortunately, we are doing too much damage to these delicate and incredible reef systems because we are destroying them with... Choice A: ocean sponges Choice B: ocean tides Choice C: shark attacks Choice D: pollution Choice E: oil spills\"\n \n### Response:The correct answer to this question is choice C, \"shark attacks\". All of the other choices are things that can harm coral reefs, but these are the incorrect. For example, answer A, \"ocean sponges\", would be a correct answer to a question about coral reefs being broken up and damaged by people who harvest or use them as home decor. The problem here is that although shark attacks are a part of life in the ocean, they do not cause enough damage to coral reefs to be the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: shark attacks\nAnswer: Shark attacks\n\n### Input\"I have this 2-by-3-inch wooden plank with two identical screw holes on each end.

Also, telephone booths can exist anywhere, i.e. they can be outside of a city or even in the middle of a city, so this is not an option.\n\nAnswer choice D (train station) cannot be correct because if someone needs to make a phone call from a train station, they can easily step outside of the train station to use the telephone booth.\n\nAnswer choice E (airport) cannot be chosen because the question does not make any mention of airports, and we know that telephone booths generally do not exist in airports.", "answer": "B: city"}

{"text": "I don't think basketball is likely to be outside the park because a park in Los Angeles is unlikely. The other locations are more likely because they all are usually outdoors.\n\nInput: Where is basketball court likely to located? Choices A: high school gym. B: city. C: park. D: use E: Los Angeles.\n\nRationales: Let's eliminate two choices from the beginning based off of spatial inference, C and D. Basketball courts are primarily inside inside, a gymnasium and a city in particular have indoor courts and not many outside.\n\nC: Parks typically have outdoor courts. The only reason why it's unlikely is because the park is Los Angeles, California. We can eliminate Los Angeles itself from being outside by using spatial inference.\n\nD: Use suggests that basketball will be in use, which typically means indoor use.\n\nBased on what options haven't been eliminated, basketball is possibly going to be indoor within the park of Los Angeles. This is possible because both A and B haven't been elimin\n\nOption B: A basketball court is usually outdoors. Since A is eliminated, B is a more likely location.\n\nBased off of logical inference, basketball courts are usually outdoors so B should be given extra consideration. We can logically infer that basketball is usually outdoors based on its physical context.\n\nEliminate E because it was a red herring and not given much reasoning.\n\nFor the last elimination, we eliminate A again because it's too unlikely to be on an Indoor gymnasium. That would mean basketball is both outdoors and gym, two things that don't usually associate with each other in terms of physical context. \n\nA: High school gymnasiums are likely to be indoors so it's unlikely that C is outdoors.\nB: We assume that B is outside and park because park is outside so any option to go inside park would also imply park would be outside.

If the population growth of Los Angeles is 2.9% per year, how many people will be living in Los Angeles in 2031?\n\n### Rationales : The question is asking how many people will be in Los Angeles County in 2030; therefore, the year to be counted must be written as 2030. \n\nStep 1: The population of LA in 2001 was 9.425 million.\n\nStep 1 a: The growth rate of 2.9%/year for people in LA county is found using the expression \u201cyear growth rate = [population in year ___] \u2013 [population in year __] / [population in year__] * 100%\u201d \n\nThe term [population in year 2001] means \u201cthe population in year 2030\u201d. So, \npopulation in year  = [population in 2000] + (100% * [year growth rate]) = [population in1999] + (10.0% * (time between 1999 and 2000))\n\nStep 1 b: Population in year 1999 = [population in2000] = population in 2007 = 8740600\n\nStep 1 c: The first year growth rate will be 1.0%, since population in year 2 = [population inyear 1] + (year growth rate * time between years 1 and 2)\n\nStep 2, year 1 growth rate = (2.9%)/year = 0.029 \n\nStep 3, term in bracketed expression = (year 1 growth rate * time between year 1 and 2)= (0.029 * 100%) =.077\n\nStep 4, (population in year 1) + (0.077* [ ]) = (87406) + (0.77) = population in year 2\n\nStep 5, Population in year", "answer": "E: school"}

If each minute, she paid $0.15, what was Teresa\u2019s average bill at the restaurant where he ate?\n### Answer:\nTeresa\u2019s average bill was $5.75.\n### Reasoning:\nThe problem is asking to determine for what amount on average Teresa paid at the restaurant. To do this, we need to calculate how much Teresa paid every 55 minutes.\n\n1.  According to the problem, Teresa had a meal that cost $3.45 and she paid $0.35 every minute.\n2.  We can determine Teresa\u2019s average cost of meals by determining how much she paid every 55 minute(s).\n3.  To determine this amount we first have to convert 55 minutes to a mathematical number. 55 minutes \u00f7 60 = 0.92 minutes\n  60 minutes \u00f7 6 = 10 minutes\n     10 minutes \u00f7 0.92 = 10.92 \n  10.92 is Teresa\u2019s average time she paid at the restaurant. \n4.  To determine the actual amount Teresa paid for every 10.93 minute, we multiply the amount by Teresa\u2019s average length of time and by 10.94 minutes which is the time Teresa paid for the meal, for a total of $5.66. \n\n      0.15(160) x 12 = 14.00$\n \n \n ### Reasoning:", "answer": "A: front door"}

She ordered four rolls of rice. Her granddaughter went to the same restaurant. She ordered seven rolls of rice. Which family ordered the most rice?\n\n### Demoliation:\nInput: Two men have $17 and $20 dollars, respectively. They will split up the money evenly. 17 and 20 add up to 37, so they will have to split it in two to make it even. \n\nThey decide they will each get 18 1/2 dollars. To do this, they add 2 to the amount they currently have to get to 18 1 /2. Then they take away 1/2 to get the number of dollars that each gets. Then, they add the number that each got to their original amount, then take away the 1/2.\n\nAnswer: The first man ends up with 18 dollars. The second man ends up with 29 dollars. The second man got the most. The answer is second for that explanation but there is an easier way to do it and it is shown in the other response \n\n### Response 2:\nInput: Rationales: In order to split the money evenly, the two men would each round $17.50 to $18, and $20.00 to $21.00. Adding 2 to each of these, they would end up with $39. In order to make the difference in the amount of money they each have $39, they would need to take away 1/3 or 1/4. In this case the answer would be that only $66 1/4 dollars would be split between them.\n\nAnswer: Only $66 1 / 4 dollars would be", "answer": "A: open meadow"}

{"text": "* D\n### Explanation:\nThis question is asking the student to choose which of the answers below the word fun and do what. The answer choices have no punctuation mark, but a comma. The answer is D, because the word 'enjoy' has a comma before it, and the word 'living' has a comma after it. There is no comma between 'fun' and 'do' so the answer cannot be E. The other choice do enjoy is incorrect because there is a comma after 'fun' so the first letter of 'enjoy' is not next to the comma. The choices 'get laid' and 'work less' have no punctuation marks in between the words, so those answers are incorrect as well. The choice 'A' has the letters 'laid' next to each other, but the first letter of the words 'laid' are not next to each other, so it is the wrong answer as well. Thus, 'D' is the only choice in the answer choices that contains what the passage is asking for.\n\n### Input\n\nGive examples of situations when you would use the word **in** (or any of its forms). Choices:  A)  To show location or position. B) To show time. C) Not to use because it is confusing. D) To modify a verb or adjective. E) To modify other parts of speech.\n\n### Response\n* A\n### Explanations\n\nThere is only one option in the answers that has 'in'. So the question is looking at the use of 'in'. This is the only question we need to answer. In the question it says **To show location or position**, and option 'A' describes that.\n\n### Tips:\n\nYou should notice that since the question reads **To show location or...** (with multiple options).  That means you have to determine which option does the same thing that the multiple options don't do.  You should know the words in the statement and the word \"location or position\", are related to place and position.  So you should eliminate the option that is not correct.  If you were to start with answer option 'D' then you should understand that option 'D' does not talk about location or position.  You should be able to eliminate this option. Then go to the other answer options to see which option talks", "answer": "B: get laid"}

He knows his sister\u2019s name and knows which of the three women on the island his mother is one, so he knows which of the three knows who is his mother and is his sister.\n\nStep 1: Let A and B be the two women who he knows are on the island.\nStep 2: His mother is one and he knows that one is A.\n\nSo A and B are both women that he knows and he knows the mother is A.\n\nStep 7: So he knows A is his mother and B is his sister.\nSo the woman who knows who the mother is is A, which would be the bachelor\u2019s mother, and A is the woman he chooses to marry.\n\nAnswer: His mother is the woman who answers that she knows who his mother is.", "answer": "C: musical"}

{"text": "A\n\n### Instructions:Which choice is the correct answer to the following question?\n\n### Dem:\n### Answer Choice:\nA: new york\n\n### Rationale:\n\n#### 1. A microphone boom is a long pole with a microphone attached to the end that is moved close to an object so that the sound of it can reach you.\n  - This question is asking where a microphone boom is likely to be covering a broadcast event related to stock trading. If someone used a microphone to broadcast music from a concert, then we would likely see the microphone boom holding the microphone near the concert venue for the broadcast event. If someone were to create a broadcast event surrounding stock trading or financial news, then they would probably broadcast this near a financial news studio or news network building since a stock trade is a business transaction that usually takes place somewhere like a financial center. However, since the broadcast event in question is related to a stock exchange, people are likely to be trading stocks on the stock exchange floor, which is in New York City. \n  - \n2. There is also a concert in New York, as indicated in the question's answer choices, which is also likely to be a major place we would see microphone booms being used to broadcast music.\n3. New York City has studios where people create TV shows, as indicated in the answer choices. However, those studios use different equipment and tools, so there is no reason to assume that microphone booms are needed in those studios.\n4. Gigs are musical performances, as indicated by the first two answer choices. Thus, an event involving a musical performance would not require us to place microphone booms in New York.\n5. Recording studios are the place where people make music for albums and singles, which would not necessitated microphone booms being placed in New York, given that microphone booms would be used to broadcast music from gigs, not studio recordings.\n\nAnswer: New York\n\n**Ans. : New York**\n\n### Instuction:Answer the following question.\n\n## 8.

{"text": "The person who is being said to be on the silver screen will be performing on a movie screen.  \n\n### Response\n\n### Input If you were running for a congressional office, you would likely need to have your resume updated and in perfect order. How many mistakes should you expect to make on a professional resume? Choices: 0 mistakes 1 mistake 2 mistakes 3 mistakes 4 mistakes\n\n### Demostration\n\nI believe this example is trying to say that when making a resume for a congressional position, it should be flawless with no major mistakes, because a \"congressional office\" position is a very high ranking position in a business or place of work. There is usually only one winner of such a \"congressional position\" and there are not many people who are considered for such a position because people that are \"congressional officers\" are extremely important for the country or place of work. Some examples of congressional offices within the US include President Donald Trump, Sen. Joe Manchin, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, Sen. Susan Collins and many many more. Therefore, since this is an example of a position that is very high up in the business world, the \"congressional officer\" should be considered to be perfect in every area of his job whether that is a resume, his physical appearance, his mannerisms and everything else that would result in him being fit for his position. \n\n### Question:If you were running for a Congressional office, you would likely have to have a resume written for you. How many mistakes should that resume have? Choices: Zero 1 2 3 4\n\n### Response \n\nThere are no mistakes that should be expected on a congressional resume. \n\nThere are so many things that happen on a resume, therefore this question asks for the number of mistakes that are expected to occur on a resume. There are many ways that one can make a resume and a resume contains so many things that one person should be very good at. Therefore, since this question asks for the amount of mistakes that are expected on a resume, there can not be mistakes made on this resume because a congressional office is an extremely important position in one\u2019s life.

Finally, if all else fails, they may die of starvation. \n\n## Output\n\nRationales:\n1. Choice A. Eat fish: This is an example of a food chain, starting with the fish eaten by some animals and then some plants. If they do not like fish, then they can find some other food from the fish, such as plants that eat fish, and those animals that eat fish, and continue the chain of food.\n\n2. Choice B. Talk to each other: If they are able to talk, they can probably find some food to eat. Since they live on the island, they only know people on the island, so it would probably be quite easy for them to find food that way. \n\n3. Choice D. Write a story: They can use this story to communicate to people outside of the island that there is a problem and hope that they do not die. They can also make money by selling the stories that they wrote. \n\n\n```text\nThe family would receive $12.\n```\n\n(48 ms)\n\n> The family was able to make $41.67 from selling the jams that they made.\n>\n> https://leetcode.com/problems/answer-the-following-multiple-choice-question/solution/", "answer": "E: die of starvation"}

If you add 2 cups of sand to 1 cup of water, will the water weigh more or less than 2 pounds?\n\nRationales: When you dissolve a cup of water into a cup of sand, the result of the mixture will be a cup of water weighing 2 pounds. This is because a cup of sand is 1 pound, but a cup of water is 16 ounces. When you combine 1 cup of water with 2 cups of one ounce sand, you have 3 cups (more than the amount of water), but only 16 ounceres of water (in 3 cups of sand, 1 cup of sand still weighs 16 ouncers. Also, you have some ounces of water that could be dissolved into the water you have already have, taking away some of your weight). The cup of water will therefore weigh less than 2 pounds.\n\n### Response\nThe water will weigh less than 32 ounces.\n\n### Cited:\n\n### Comment", "answer": "B: avoid eye contact"}

On Saturday, the man climbed one foot higher than he had on Friday and two feet higher than he had on the previous Saturday. What was the total height from the ground to the top of the tree on Saturday?\n\n### Step 1\nDetermine the total height from the tree top on Friday to the man on his first climb.\nFriday\u2019s man-tree height = base + n(man-tree height)\nFriday\u2019- man-tree height = 0\nn = 1, man-tree height on Friday = 0\nBase = ground height.\nBecause the man climbed one more notch on Saturday, he made a change of 2 units.\nGround \u2192 Man = 1\nMan \u2192 Tree = 2\nWe can determine the top height using man - tree height + base.\nSo, Saturday\u2019s man-tree = 12 + Base\n\n### Step2\nWe can determine Saturday\u2019s height of the man and the tree by substituting n into the formula Base + n (man-tree height)and solving for n.\n\nBase + n(12 + Base) = 12\n\nn = 12/Base - 1\n\nn + 1 = [n(12/11) - (Base/11)]\n\nn + 2 = [n(1 - 1/11) - Base/11]\n\nn + 3 = [Base/11]\nSolving\n3 n + 2 = 1\n3 n + 1 = 2\nn + 2/3 = 2/3\nn = 2/3.\nHence, on Saturday, the climber climbed 2/3 of the way up the tree.

First we see the money donated as a $0.75 value which equals $1.00. We then must think of a whole number that equals the previous number ($1.33) to reach $1,622.50. We are close, but $0.50 away from our correct answer of $1,630.00. We can round up and take away $3.95 to equal $1,626.05.

Therefore, the answer must also give two places, in the case of choice (D), where to buy a book online. I don't think it would make sense for the answer to state the library or the school. Why not the internet? That's what the question specifically asks for. Besides, option (A) would not answer the question at all, because how would the question asker know if they could buy books online? The question is simply asking where to buy books.

So, Jackie's parents had to decide if they should go to Jackie's daddy's office so Jackie could charge her phone quickly, or to a gas station so Jackie could fill her car with gas. The table shows the different routes Jackie's parents can take to reach the destination in their car. \n\n|      Route       | Distance | Cost | Time |\n| :----------------- | -------: | :--- | :--- |\n| Take the highway | 10 miles | $5.80 | 8 min |\n| Take the back roads|14 miles | $640,00| 12hr |\nInput: If a human wants to enjoy the company of another human, where could they go? \nRationales: First, there are choices A, B, C, D and E. However, Jackie's car is only able to use the gas stations because Jackie's daddies office charges it. Jackie's dads's office uses the back roads, but Jackie's car requires gas stations so she can use it. \n\nSecond, the table that Jackie's dadas has uses highways for 10 miles, and then takes the back roads for 4 miles which results in a total of 4 miles. If they take the back roads the total number miles they take is 14. \n \nThird, by using the rules for addition and subtraction, the total number of miles that the car can drive is 14 minus 4. So, 14-4=10 and by using the rules for the addition and subtraction once again to get the 10 miles from the 14 miles, 14 miles-14 = 0 miles. If there are no miles there should not be any cost. That is why there should not be a cost. Lastly, if the back roads only goes for 10 miles there would not be a cost for anything so Jackie'", "answer": "C: friend's house"}

{"text": "Answer: A \n\n### Explanation:\nThere is no context that would imply that the man has a condition like Cerebral Palsy, so that would eliminate B, C, and D. \n\nThe man is fat, so he would have difficulty doing anything. The fat man would have a hard time getting out of bed, dressing himself, walking around as fast as someone else can, and even eating what some people consider simple meals. \n\nSo, there are some things that he might find easy but that he will not find simple, like getting up everyday to go to the gym, waking up early and moving slowly. Since he is too busy eating and getting ready for bed everyday, the fat man does not have time to do anything but eat and sleep. \n\nAnswer E would be incorrect because the fat man could be doing some things like working out, eating a more balanced diet, and getting extra sleep. But, the fat man would have an undesired outcome from doing these activities. \n\nThe fat man wants to be skinny, but he does not want the difficulty of getting up and doing some exercises, or eating a healthier diet. Even if he did want to change his body, it would take a lot of time and a lot of work on his part to find a better balance and lifestyle. Even if he did find those things, the fat man would probably have difficulty maintaining them. \n\nSince the fat man does not want to eat better food or exercise, and the fat man would not want to have an easier time doing whatever was simple, the fat man would not choose no go, impossible, or difficult. \n\nAnswer A is the only choice that explains everything given in the situation.

Choices A-E can be eliminated because they aren't places you store a chair. Only D is correct because a closet is a place people store items like clothes and shoes.\n\nD = closet E = The closet is the correct answer because it is a place to store items like clothes and footwear\nAnswer: Option 'C': Beach\n\n#### Input:A bag has 9 pieces of lemon gum, 3 pieces of apple gum, 5 pieces of orange gum, and 1 piece of blue gum. There are a total of 36 pieces of gum of all types. How many of each kind of gum does the bag hold?\n\n#### Demonstration: This problem can be solved by listing the different types of gum and the amount of each and then subtracting each kind from a total of pieces of gum to find out how many of each kind is in the bag. You could also subtract the number of pieces of gum each kind of gum has from a total number of 36 pieces to figure out how many different kinds of gum are in the bag.\n\nRationales: Since we start with a total number of pieces of gums we have to subtract a total number of all types of gum from 36, the number of pieces of total gum we have. Therefore, 36 - 36 = 0 (or 36 - 12 = 24)\n\nThe question then asks \"how many\" of each kind of gums the bag has.\nWe add 1 to 12 (because 12 is the number of pieces of apple gum we have which is the first kind of gum we found in the bag), to 24 (because 24 is the sum of all the kinds we found, excluding apple gums, in the bag. Therefore, 12 + 24 = 36)\n\nThe question follows by asking how many of each kind of pieces of gum the bag holds. As can be seen by our answer above, we now have 9 from the lemon gums, 3 from the apple gums, 5 from the orange gums", "answer": "D: closet"}

Answer choices:\nA: Java\nB: Sulawesi\nC: Borneo\nD: An island with less than 10 million people\n\n### Response : Sumatra\n### Rationale Well, this question really has no logic, as it doesn\u2019t specify any parameters or limits. It states that one of the 10 biggest islands in the world is in the Indonesian Sea, but it doesn\u2019t specify where, or even how big, the Indonesian Sea is, or which country it may be in. However, there is one island that fits both descriptions, Sumatra, so that has to be the answer.\n\n### [Instruction:Read through this", "answer": "A: look beautiful"}

Because of this it isn't likely that bass clarinets would be found in most school bands.\n\n#### MUSIC STORE:\n\nBass music is a classification of sound that uses sound waves (measured in hertz) around 60Hz. A bass clarinet is capable of producing sound waves around 60Hz and lower.\n\n#### OPERA HOUSE:\n\nThe opera house typically has a variety of string instruments (violin, viola, cello, harp). The average orchestra bass clarinet (which can often be in an orchestra when performing music from the late 1800's) is lower in pitch than the harp. Thus, a bass clarinet is most likely used in a performance.\n\n#### HOME:\n\nThis is highly unlikely because the sound waves produced by a bass clarinet are around 60Hz (and can be lower).

The attack did not end in cease fire or defense therefore C is the only correct choice.\n\n### Answer: C\n\n### Choice B:\nDemonstration: B is the correct because the question states that the attack was at night by definition a nighttime attack is a surprise attack. A surprise attack can also be a daytime attack but a daytime attack does not have the same connotation as a surprise attack so B is the correct answer.\n\n### A:\nBecause the question lists nighttime attack as the type of attack, night time attacks are not defined as surprises therefore nighttime and surprise attacks are not synonyms and A is not the correct answer.\n  \n### D:\nThe question states the attack was a surprise nighttime attack with the description of surprise attack it would have had to have ended in cease fire or withdrawal therefore D, the attack could not end in cease fires or defense because that is not what a surprise attack entails. \n\n### E:\nWhile this would be a valid description of a surprise attack it does not indicate that the attack ended in surrender, A is not the correct choice\n\n### Choices:  Choices:  A B C D E\n\n### Demos:\nBecause the description of the attack is to be performed in the night, a nighttime attack is not synonymous with a surprise attack and B is the correct choice.\n\nHowever A is not the correct response because a nighttime attack could just as well be an act of defence.\n\nD is also incorrect because a nighttime attack is generally accompanied by some kind of defensive posture such as retreat.\n\nE is incorrect by definition since there is not a choice for a surprise daytime attack since it has been previously established that the attack in question was a nighttime attack.\n\nFinally it can be assumed that C is correct because it is the counterpoint to the word surprise and since the attack would be a surprise attack it would not end in cease or defense therefore the only correct choice is C.\n \n### Response B\n\n### How many ounces are in a cup?

{"text": "responsibility\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question about evaluating arguments.\n\n### Explanation:It may seem odd to add 5+7 together in order to evaluate the effect of a $1.00 discount on a purchase (worth $7.00) of a brand of laundry detergent that has a 50c per container surcharge on every container used. The effect of this surcharge can be deducted from the final amount spent, if one makes the calculation to arrive at the real cost of the detergent after the coupon. In reality, this \"cost\" is no different than buying a product with a \"free trial offer\", which costs more to the consumer, but the amount of the free trial offer is subtracted from the sale price of the product. \n\nThe answer, when one evaluates this argument, is that the difference between the $5.50 sale price (plus a discount for the $1.00 coupon) and the $7.00 original price of the detergent, represents the difference between the \"retail price\" and the \"discounted price\" of the detergent. \n\nAnswer (A): Responsibility.\n\n### Inputs:Two weeks ago, Mike purchased 225 mg of calcium tablets for $5. Last week, he bought 150 mg of calcium plus 45 mg of magnesium, which cost him $3.50.  If the current price per 100 mg of calciums is \\$1.50, how much did he earn or lose because of the varying cost per mg of calcium?\n\n### Explination:There is also another way to solve this (that is, if you know how you can solve it this way) by finding out how many milligrams of calcium is in 225 and 150. So, for 225, 225/100 = 2.25 mg of pure calcium. For 150, 150/100 =1.5 mg of pure magnesium. So you can add the two values together to get 2.25 + 1.5 = 3.75, which would", "answer": "D: evaluating"}

Here T is any term which represents the total amount including the difference i.e. the total sum of the parts is T.\n\nSo if we are asked how to calculate $5 (T \u2013 1)$ now it depends on the value of T only.\n\nFor example, suppose the value is T is 5000 (5000 includes t and the difference is 1). Then the answer will come as 5001 (5001 includes t and difference is 2).\n\nSimilarly, if $T$ is 1000 (T includes 1000 and the difference is 0), then the answer will come as $5(T-1)$= $5 (1000-4999)=5 (5)= 5000.\n\nWe can use the same formula for any value of T. For example, if $T$= 100 then ($5(T-1$)= $5 (99)-5 (100)$) $5($T-1$$)$= (99-100$)= 1-2) $2$(100-99)2-100).\n\n### Instructed response 2:\n\n### Response explanation:\nAns.  (0.5) (t-1)\n\nStep 1: Add/subtract the given value 0.5 (for negative answers, add is done, and for positive answers, subtract is performed)\n\nStep 2.  Convert the resultant value into the fraction (0.5/1) (t-1).\n\nStep 3.

If a mule takes longer to walk the same distance as a pony takes to trot the same distance, how many times longer does this take?\nOutput: Sammy can walk 4 feet in 9 seconds. A pony will trot 6 feet in 6 seconds.\n9/6 = <<9/6=1.5>>1.5 times faster than a pony.\nIf A pony takes 1.5 times longer, a pony will take 1.5 times as long to walk 12 feet as Sammy will take to walk 4 feet\nSo the final answer we get is A\n\nInput: A woman had six babies, all but two of which were boys. What do you think the probability is that each of her subsequent babies will also be boys?\nOutput: There were 4 boys but the rest of them were girls.  The number of possible girls increased to 6 each time. This means that there were 6 possible girls and 4 possible boys that could be born.  The number of positive occurrences of something is 6 * 4 = <<6*4=24>>26.\nNow let us count the number of non-occurrences of something. We had 6 previous babies that were all girls.  From the options we have, we have 6(2) = <<6(2)=12>>12 possibilities that we can choose the next baby from. So the number of negative occurrences plus the number of positive occurrences is 12 + 26 = <<12+26=38>>38.\nFrom this we can calculate the probability given by: [total occurrences] + [total non-occurrences] = [total number of occurrences]\nSo the final answer here is 38", "answer": "B: populated areas"}

You have a container of water with a temperature of 15\u00b0C, and you add 10 grams of salt per liter of water.\nOutput:Adding salt raises the temperature of a solution. If we assume that the density of the solution is the same as that of seawater, then every 10 grams that we add would increase the temperature of the water by 1.25\u00b0. We could also assume that the concentration of salt affects the heat of solution. In the last case, the heat of solution would be the sum of the heat capacity of water and the heat capacity of salt.\nIf we do the earlier model, then adding salt to the water would increase the temperature by 15\u00b0 + 1.25(10g).\nIf we use the second model, the heat of solution of salt water is 0.16 J/(g\u00b7\u00b0C). Therefore, we would end up with 0.16(10g). Therefore, increasing the concentration from 0-10 grams would increase the temperature by a factor 1.09. \nSo the final answer\nis 1", "answer": "D: louisiana"}

Leap years are divisible by four. 2100 is also a leap because 2100 -1900 (2000 -2000) is divisible by four. However no more of the evenly divisible by four should be taken in every century because it is also divisible by 100, 400 and 1000. 2008 was not a leap year as it is divided by 100 in that decade, and so 2020 will not occur since it is the 20th year of the two-year century and all leap years for century years are evenly divisible by 400. 2108 would be a leap year if nothing were taken in decade years after 1900 and before 2100. \nThe Leap 2020 is only possible to skip the 21st century.

This means the problem can be restate as something like this 125 = baskets + plants, where baskets is equal to 125/2 which is equal to 62.5, and plants is equal to 1 +125/2, which is equal to 50.5.\nSo the final answers are 62.5 and 50.5\n\nInput: How many times did you hit the buzzer to play a game of buzzer ball today?

How much does Ahmad's ticket cost?\nOutput: Alicia buys a ticket for $197 because the online price of the cheapest ticket she found is -197 * 0.5 / 1.3 = <<197*0.5/1.3>>0.5 = <<50x50=250>>250, which means she has a discount of 197 - 250 = <<197-250=37>>37 dollars, which leaves her with the bill of 250-37 = 213. Ahmad buys a ticket for 125 dollars, because 213 / 1.3  = <<213/1.3>>1.3 = <<213=161>>161.\nCombined, we have: -197 * ( 161 / 213) / 0.5 + 125 = << -197*(161/213)/0.5 +125>>125, which simplifies to 161 * 161 / (0.5 * 213) = <<161*161/0.5*213>>213, which is 427.

What is the area? Choices: 36 ft A: the front B: the width C: the rear D: the wheel well E: the trunk.\nOutput: The length of my wheel well is the same as the width. The width of my car is twice the length of the car. There are 8 square feet in a wheel well, and 16 square feet in a wheel. Therefore, there are 16 wheel well areas. There are six parts of each wheel. therefore, there are 100 wheel well areas. the sum of the length and width is 20. divide the resulting figure by 2, and you find that there is 75% of the front of the car and 25 % of the rear. There is a total of 100 square inches in each square foot. Therefore, there are (100 * 100)/20 square inches in the wheel well. Each square inch is 1/4 inch wide and 1/4 in length. This gives you 4*4 = 16 inches on each side of the wheel. Therefore, the front of the car has 7.5*16 = 120 inches, while the rear has (25)-(1/4 of 75)=37.5 inches. The sum of the front and rear is (7.5 + 37.5) = 45 inches. This is one fifth of the entire length.", "answer": "D: train station"}

This is true after removing dogs that are owned by people and pigeons that are owned by a bird control company. In how many dog- or cat-owner families is this true?\nOutput: First, find the number of pigeon owners: Let x = number of pigeon owner x = the total number f dogs x - the total number of dog owners\nx - 1/2 = the total number of pigeon and dog owners\nSo x = 36\nIn a dog or cat owner family, if the person has a dog, then they are a dog owner and not a cat owner as long as their dog isn't owned by the bird control company. So the person is counted as a dog owner twice, not a cat owner at all, counted once each.\nSo the final number of dog owners is 18/2 = <<18/2=9>>9\nIf you add the number of dog owners by the number of cat owners, you get what would be the same number of families. So in how many dog or cat owners families is this true, the answer is 9\n\nInput:There are 19 students in a debate club.

So, he has still got (x + 1) games left to play.\nWhen his day is over, that is, after he has done all things, he will not play any games with the computer anymore. So, after his day is over, there no games left to play, that is, (x + 1).\nSo, the no. of games he will play in his day for every number x is: (x + 1)! (The reason for using exclamation sign is given at the end of the solution.)\nTherefore, number of games he plays at his office is:  (55 +1)! = 61.\nSo, he plays 61 games every day, which means he plays 821 games over a week for 7 days (including monday).\nLet x be the no. of games the office employee plays.\nNow, the total games he plays in his week will be (x + 821), that is x - 821, for these days (from monday onward) he is unable to play any because the day is over for office hours. Therefor, the total number of games he plays for a given week,\n\n( x - 820) * ( x - 819) * ( x -818)... * ( x -821)\n\nSo the no. of games over a week is: ( x - 82)**x\n\nHence, x = 23, and, 23 times of the no. of games played by all office employees in a given week is : ( 23 - 7)/ (2 - 0 ) = 4\nSo, 23 office employees in a week will play 4 games over a week.\nSo, a total of 23*4 games will be played every week over a day.\nSo, he will play the maximum of 4 games every day.\nSo, the final answer is 4\n\nInput: Which of the following are true about the following statements?

If he were to order curry, he would spend all $20 dollars of his clothing allowance and also spend at least $10 dollars and no more than $15 dollars on curry. So john could not only order curry.\n\nInput: There are 785 students in John's math class. 5 students each have 15 math books, 6 students have 12 math books and 45 students have 9 math books. What is the rest of the class size?\nOutput: So there total number of books in the class is 809, John knows the total number of books in each group and we know for each number of books someone has, the other 780 people must have the same number of books as that person. Because if you have 9 math books you must have 1 9th of the rest of the books in the class, thus there are 911 books.\nWith math, that translates to a little easier as (n+1)x780=809, the rest of the class has more than 138, which is a little more than 1/5. This leads to (n+1)(138/911)=1/5 so n+1=1/50 which has an answer of 49\n\n*Input: The total cost of a computer is $5000 plus the cost of the modem, monitor, software and peripherals. If the modem costs $70, the monitor costs $100, the software costs $200 and peripherals cost $30, find what is the minimum amount you have to spend to buy\nthe total package.\n\nOutput: What we can do is split up the software and peripherals, so that software is $200 and the peripherals are $30. That means that the total cost of the peripherals and software is $230. So subtract $230, which makes", "answer": "C: curry"}

Freddy's local call is 5 cents. So 5 cents for 45 minutes is 5*45=<5*45=325>>325 cents for calling his father.He pays 775 cents for international calls for his brother.So Freddy Paid 325+770<775=1150>>1150 cents. 1000 cent =1 dollar.So Freddy paid 1150/15=<1150/90=1.316>>1.316 for each time he called his family on New Year.\n## Tutorial Sollons #3\n>We use a little bit of math to solve this problem.\nIn 8 hours,30 minutes,1/48 equals to, 48*1/8=<48*1/20= 7.5>>7.5 hours.

Looking attractive is most likely what a male is doing when putting on formal clothes. Compliments would be one of the goals of wearing formal wear, as well as when wearing makeup. Interesting experiences is most likely while going out for Halloween, but still applying makeup for an event like this would be something you plan in advance and practice before hand, so the likely goal is not just compliments.

You then roll all 100 pieces of gum or 300 pieces of gumbulking in your backpack, and leave each stick individually or as a group. Each piece of chewing gum will be 5% moist, no matter how you store it or how you bring it along for your weekend long bike ride.  How much water do you need to pack to last your weekend ride?  Choices: <<A>>2, 599 ounces <<B>>2, 1667 ounces <<C>>2, 1250 ounces <<D>>2, 700 ounces <<E>>2, 500 ounces \nOutput: Assuming the 5%/stick rule is true, 100 pieces will weigh about 5 ounces/piece of gum, and 300 will weigh 15 ounces/ piece of gumbulking. So assuming that 100 pieces weigh 5 ounces, 300 pieces weigh  15 ounces, and both weights are ounces, we  get  1713, 9053, 6400, and 5400 respectively.\nNow take the lowest number 599, so that you have a minimum amount of water needing to be packed, and the greatest 9053. Now divide this by the two numbers to result in each piece, which is  599/(1 250 463 500 9053/(1 251 500 703 500\nSo the fraction of each water bottle should be 599/(3 157 814 1", "answer": "C: desk"}

It continues to drive till it reaches the nearest tire store, 25 miles away. The bus continues to drive towards the tire store at the same average speed, but the tire on the left rear wheel is flat, making it impossible to use the accelerator. How long before the bus reaches the tire store?\nOutput: The number of miles is not constant, the average speed should only be calculated over a time span.\nBy assuming that the bus keeps the rate of average speed during the time that it was driving after the tire on the rear left tire went flat, we can find the average speed. For instance, the bus travels 40 miles every hour. That would mean after 15,385 seconds when the driver stopped the bus, he should be able to continue driving at an average speed of 40 miles per hour. To find the time taken before the bus reaches the nearest tire repair shop, we can find the time when the bus reaches the point where it should be in order to reach the tire repair shop. This would mean that the bus should be 15385/40 = <<15385/-40=384>>384 seconds from the tire repair shop when it was traveling at its maximum speed.\nSo the answer is 384\n\nInput:A car starts from the same place at the same time.

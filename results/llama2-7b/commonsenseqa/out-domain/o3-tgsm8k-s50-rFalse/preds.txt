Alice knows that if one passes a landmark, she can use its height to estimate their progress in the journey. They start by knowing that they're flying parallel to the coast at an altitude equal to the height of the clouds, and they travel in the direction of the sun. They have a map of Australia which shows the heights of some mountains. At first, they travel as far up the coast as possible with the winds at their back. Their altitude then decreases to within a mile of shore. They take advantage of the winds blowing in the same direction that the sun is moving. Their progress is now constant. Alice wants to stay above the coastline. As soon as they are moving again, they keep constant altitude and keep as close to the coast as they can. Which way do they want to turn in order to end up in Hong Kong?<n>Output: Left turn<n>

Let A be a number. A is one more than the maximum 2-digit number that has the sum of 11. If A is 127, it can be rewritten as:<n># 10x10 + 7 or as:<n># 8x1 + 8<n># Thus if (10x10) is the A’s digit, and (8x1) is the B’s digit, then we could also write this number as:<n># (8A - B)<n># ------ <n><n># VI.

Choices:  A: deadly B: dangerous C: unconcerned D: stressful E: harder when weather bad<n>Output:		A<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>* If Hurley is 4x + 1 and the difference 40 = 50x + 20, then 40 + 4x + 20 = 40 + 50x + x = 5x(x+10). Rearrange the equation to x2 – 10x + 40 = 0 (a quadratic function of x). Since the equation is quadratic and has only one solution, Hurley is 21 years old 40 years later.<n><n>* Pablo takes 150 pages books for 8 months and 4 months to finish the same number of books and so for 12 months. Pablo reads for a year and the total pages read is 1,950 pages. Let us round up to 2000 pages. To save for a candy Pablo collects $2 a week for reading for a year. The total number of weeks he read is 2000/50 pages/week = 40 weeks. So Pablo read for 40 weeks and after saving for the candy, he has $3 remaining. So the saving is for 100 weeks. But the number of pages read is 100 x 150 =25,000 pages. Then the average number of books read per week is 100 pages. The total number of books that Pablo has read is (25,00/100) = 250 books.<n><n>* Each of 6 friends has to pay $285. After Brad joined, each of the 6 friends pays $368. So the difference is $76 which is equal to $40/6. After Brad joins all of the friends must pay $110 each for the car.<n><n>* Answers that contains C, D, E & A have the least common factor, 2. The factor of 2 is given the lowest place and the highest place is the multiple of 2. D is the answer that has lowest common factor in both numerator and denominator.<n><n><n><n><n><n>

So, I do not plan to buy the CD player, but only its component parts. I think of a computer, or a camera for instance, as really just a collection of electronic circuits combined with the physical parts they need to be housed in. These components, such as microchips, or memory chips, are already sold individually. I can build a computer from a kit that contains only the components I need. I find I can get much better value for my money this way. I do the same with stereo components like a CD player or speakers. When I want a CD player, I buy the unit itself, or the complete stereo component. If, on the other hand, I cannot find the complete components I need at a value that I consider reasonable, then I build my stereo component from its component parts. This way, I get exactly my desired system and I can save money and make them cheaper. Of course, this can be a lot of work - to make it easier, I will buy the pieces of the stereo I don't already have to complete my stereo system. But I will only buy the parts when I need them.<n><n>Output: 1<n><n>Input:Which of the answers below can be described as "the price charged to a customer for the goods and services made available through a given unit of the product in a given accounting period"?<n>Output: d) total revenue<n><n>Input: The question above refers to which of the following? a. revenue per unit b. total revenue c. price per unit d. total costs<n>Output:  b<n><n>Input: The expression "average price" can be used to denote which of the following?<n>Output: a) total price / total quantity<n><n>Input: Which of the statements below is true of costs incurred and payments made so far in the preparation of the statement of financial position?<n>Output: c) Costs and expenses are not included in the statement of financial position<n><n>Input: The following costs and expenses may show up on a company's statement of financial position at the end of an accounting period: <n><n>a) prepaid salary expense<n><n>b) deferred income<n><n>c) accrued liabilities<n><n>d) interest expense

How many books did Pablo read?<n>Output: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Output: 40<n><n>Input:Where do kids play with a ball that is concrete? Choices:  A: street B: soccer field C: soccer game D: central park E: pool table<n>Output:		 B<n><n><n><n>#### Explanation:<n><n>Explanation for 3:1.3.1.2:<n><n>Richard is 14 years, and Hurley is 4 years older, so Hurley is 18.<n><n>18 + 40 = 58, or 14 + 28 = 42<n><n>42 - 26 = 16<n><n>16 * 20 = 320<n><n>Thus, the difference in their combined ages is 20. Thus, when they are 40 years old, their combined age is 64. <n><n>Explanation 3:1.4:<n><n>Pablo read 125 pages, but spent $15 on candy, leaving $3.<n><n>15 - 3 = 12<n><n>12 * 15 = 180<n><n>180 - 125 = 55<n><n>55 * 0.01 (one cent) = 0.55<n><n>0.55 - 15 = 3<n><n>Thus, Pablo read 125 + 12 = 137 pages.<n><n>Explanation:<n><n>The total cost of the car is \$1700, and they plan to split it equally so that each must pay \$285 to get the car.<n><n>Brad doesn't participate any more, so his share is \$500 less than before = \$1300. Each friend must then pay \$1300 - \$500 = \$800.<n><n>Explanatin:<n><n>We have to figure out the ball's color.<n>	<n>Thus, since the ball isn't on the pool table, it's a concrete ball.<n>

So if Brad didn't leave, the cost would be $1700/6, so each friend would've had to pay $283.33 (rounded up to 283).<n><n>### Solution Ques 5<n>- If the world population is growing at a rate 'S', then the number of people in each year is (1 + S%)^n where n is the number of years (the question's n=45). So to get 2.555 in the 45th year we get: 1 + (S%*45) / (1+S%). So if S = 0.01% then 1+S%*45/(1+s%) and you get roughly 2.5010.<n>

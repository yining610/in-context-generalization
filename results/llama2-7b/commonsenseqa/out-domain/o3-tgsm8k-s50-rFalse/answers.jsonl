{"text": "C\n\n### Explanation\n\nMy explanation for how to do this is very simple. I\u2019ll try my best to make it understandable. Let us first look into the first question.\n\nSuppose Hurley is now 14. Now, it\u2019s the time for Richard to be 14 as well. Therefore, Hurley + Richard = 14 + 14 = 28.\n\nAs we can see, age is calculated by subtraction. If we keep increasing Hurley by 20 years from now, then the answer will be 128.\n\nNow, the next question. Suppose we had 150 pages in a book and Pablo plan to read every single page of the book. As we know, adding 150 with 150 can give us 300. Therefore, Pablo read for 300 pages after buying one cent for every single page he reads.\n\nTherefore, the answer is c.\n\nNext, let us look into a second question.\n\nSupposed Pablo had $3 left over from his allowance to buy candy. How much is the original amount of book that Pablo bought?\n\nLet take a look at the equation.\n\n1 book x $1700 will give us $1700\n\nTotal amount of candy + $3 = $15\n\nTotal amount of one book = $3 +$15= $18\n\n\n\n### Code for Question#2\n\n<img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/2G7JZ4xY/Screen-Shot-2019-12-27-at-1.17.46-AM.png\" alt=\"uploading code\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 435px;\">", "answer": "E: sporting event"}

{"text": "A\n\nInput:I was really frantic, I was thinking that I will never be able to manage my life. So I took some steps. At first I stopped taking cigarettes and stopped smogging. I had a deep study of diabetes. I learnt a lot about food recipes. I even learnt about some herbs and foods, which helped. I also joined a club. I was the president of that club. People in my office gave me membership for that club. I was a fitness instructor in that club. I joined a gym and started jogging. Jogging was the best part of my life. I kept me healthy and very fit. My family was very supportive. I got rid of my frantic situation as I gained knowledge.\n\nI have learnt a lot now. I can help people in need, I can teach healthy living. I can help people to get rid of their frustrations. I got the courage to move on and to face this life.\n\nInput:I had good friends and I used to help people when they needed. I used to give advice to people to help them improve their lives. I tried very hard in my life and taught people how healthy living was beneficial. I taught people to save money. \nI helped people in all aspects of their lives and that helped them to improve.\n\nMy friends helped me in times of need, they helped me when I was frantic and gave me patience to face this world when I was sad. I had a really bad time in a period but my friends helped me and I am very thankful to them.\n\nThere is some people, who are very caring and kindhearted. They have a pure heart, an innocent nature, a happy life and they always find a way to solve their problems and help other people in the time of their needs. \nBut there are also some people who are rude, selfish, impatient and unfortunate. They are always in trouble and have some worries.\nThey also face many problems in their life like losing respect, facing criticism, having doubts about their own capabilities, some suffer from depression also.\nIn my opinion, if you face trouble or get frustrated, instead of focusing on it, forget it,  move forward. Always forgive others, always stay calm and think on how to come over these situations", "answer": "B: talent"}

{"text": "A\n\n### Solution:\n### Answer\nIn order to solve this task, I have used brute force method that iterates through all the possibilities of solving the equation. Since there is no solution given in this task I have used 3 different cases\n\nCase 1: First one is that there is no answer since the equation is undistuable\n\nCase 2: Second one is the correct answer, the sum of the ages has a remainder of 5 and their ages can be represented by (40-20-14) which =5 and therefore, the sum should be 120\n\nCase 3: The third case is invalid since the sum of the ages when subtracted from 40 has a remainder of 2 and their ages can only be represented by the number 12 which in turn is invalid\n#### Note:\nSome of us used trial and error methods to find the right answer. I have provided the methodology on how I solved this\n\n### Brute force approach\n#### Approach 1\nFirst, I have used the brute force approach to solve the cases. Here is the code snippet I have used for this method\n\n#### Approach 2\nSecond approach here is to use multiple cases to solve the question which is to solve the equation using the difference between their ages. Here is the code for the same.\n```js\nvar age = 35 // Richard's age is\n            | age = 25 // Hurley's age\n            | yearsFromNow = 15;\n            | solution = {yearsFromNow: {remainder: 0, yearsBetween: age}}\n            | while(age + yearsFromNow!= 45){\n            |   year = yearsFromNow - age\n                        | remainder = year % 5\n                        | age = year - remainder\n                        | solution.yearsFromNow = solution.yearsFromOne()\n                        | solution = {...solution,...solution.yearsFromOne()}\n                        | }\n```\n---\nThank you for reading!!!

{"text": "A\n\nInput: I am always on the lookout for good value in everything I buy. So, I do not plan to buy the CD player, but only its component parts. I think of a computer, or a camera for instance, as really just a collection of electronic circuits combined with the physical parts they need to be housed in. These components, such as microchips, or memory chips, are already sold individually. I can build a computer from a kit that contains only the components I need. I find I can get much better value for my money this way. I do the same with stereo components like a CD player or speakers. When I want a CD player, I buy the unit itself, or the complete stereo component. If, on the other hand, I cannot find the complete components I need at a value that I consider reasonable, then I build my stereo component from its component parts. This way, I get exactly my desired system and I can save money and make them cheaper. Of course, this can be a lot of work - to make it easier, I will buy the pieces of the stereo I don't already have to complete my stereo system. But I will only buy the parts when I need them.\n\nOutput: 1\n\nInput:Which of the answers below can be described as \"the price charged to a customer for the goods and services made available through a given unit of the product in a given accounting period\"?\nOutput: d) total revenue\n\nInput: The question above refers to which of the following? a. revenue per unit b. total revenue c. price per unit d. total costs\nOutput:  b\n\nInput: The expression \"average price\" can be used to denote which of the following?\nOutput: a) total price / total quantity\n\nInput: Which of the statements below is true of costs incurred and payments made so far in the preparation of the statement of financial position?\nOutput: c) Costs and expenses are not included in the statement of financial position\n\nInput: The following costs and expenses may show up on a company's statement of financial position at the end of an accounting period: \n\na) prepaid salary expense\n\nb) deferred income\n\nc) accrued liabilities\n\nd) interest expense", "answer": "D: orchestra"}

Choices:  B: decreasing C: rapid D: slow E: flat\nOutput: slow\n\n### Explanation:\n```\n### Solution for Question 1\n\n- For Richard: 12 + Hurley = 128\n- Hurley: 14\n\n### Solution for Ques 2\n- Pablo read 150 pages (every page he reads 1 cent) + buy $15 worth of gum at the end - the remainder to the next closest even number (12)\n\n### Solution of ques 3\nTo calculate how much each person has to pay:\n- Take total cost ($1700) - total ($1700 - 0) - car wash ($500)\n- So if it's $1199, each friend has to pay for $1199 / 6\n### Solution of Ques 4\n- What we have here is the 'Brad effect'. So if Brad didn't leave, the cost would be $1700/6, so each friend would've had to pay $283.33 (rounded up to 283).\n\n### Solution Ques 5\n- If the world population is growing at a rate 'S', then the number of people in each year is (1 + S%)^n where n is the number of years (the question's n=45). So to get 2.555 in the 45th year we get: 1 + (S%*45) / (1+S%). So if S = 0.01% then 1+S%*45/(1+s%) and you get roughly 2.5010.", "answer": "B: populated area"}

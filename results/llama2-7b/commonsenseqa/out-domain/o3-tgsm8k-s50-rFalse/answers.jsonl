If each car had 536 miles on them, the combined mileage was 3736.

There are two cars each containing 6 carpooling persons. Therefore, each car contains 3 passengers and each car contained the same number of miles. We cannot subtract these combined milage because that would be a mathematical model, and not a question of \"Input:\". Therefore, there is no way to take the number 3 and subtract these combined milage from it.

I decided to calculate the distance (in minutes) it would take me to walk from A to B, which is 42 minutes according to google maps.\nTherefore I took my $105 (105 minutes) from (Money/42 min = $2.54/105 min = $0.24) then I calculated $0.24 x 4.50 bus fare, so the amount that would buy all the bus rides was $1.08.\n\nI then bought 5 bus rides.\n\nMy next step was to find out the journey by boat and compare this to the bus fare.\n\nJourney by boat takes 22 minutes (from $0.24/22 min = $0.11) so next I take 0.11 x 9.50 boat fare, which totals $9.95.\n\nTherefore by travelling by bus I saved an extra $0.03.\n\n### Input(Driving):\n\nInput:\n\\[Money = \\$100, \\$2.50 for 4 trips,\\$1.08 for 5 trips\\]\n\\[T = 25\\]\n\\[L = 9.50", "answer": "C: building"}

Each unit in the metric system in the following manner:\n\nThe unit for length is meter (m) and, to convert into centimeters, use the notation 1 cm = 0.01 m. The unit for mass (weight) is kilogram and, to convert into grams or pounds, use this: 1 kg = 1000 g. To convert inches to meters, you'll need 1m = 100 cm.\n\nThe conversion formulas are as follows:\n\n1.  km = (m * 1000*1000)/3937\n2. g = (10*9*m)/1000\n3.  kg = (m * 2.2046)/10000\n4. cm = (m * 5.08/100)\n5. mm = (m * 0.001/100) = (cm * 1/100=0.00 01/10 cm)\n\nThe following conversion factors are provided for immediate reference:\n1. 1 mi = 1609.34 m\n2. g = 0.0621371 lb ______1\n3. 1 mi = (4028*1000) ft\n4. 1 kg =1.008 g\n\n# Problem 2: Explain the four fundamental operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nThe fundamental operations of arithmetic are called basic or elementary operations.

If we buy at least $10 we are automatically given one point, so the difference is $9 between $ 9 = 1 point. So I collect 1 point\n\n### 2: in example we had an item that costs $10 and had to collect $5 to be given 1 point, so I would use that $5 plus 4$ more to get that point (5+4=9=1point)\n\n### 3: we always have to collect the difference between the items\n\n### Example : I spend $10 in order to get 1 point,and another item I spend $5 in order to get 2 point. So total = (1+2) points=3 points\n\nIn short I can write it : (5-1)=4, then total=8+4=12\n\n### Examples and Rules:\n### First rule:\nA group of friends bought 3 sandwiches each one worth $3, but one of them did not collect his points for the sandwiches.

Note the following:\nSample Output: The years in 2008 have been counted so the first years to be counted are 2009, 2012, 2015, and so on.\n\n#### Instructions: If the month of February has a 29th day, it is a leap year but not if it is on the shortest day of February. You may assume that the year is not a leap year.\nExample:\nInput: 2005 - 2004 and 2008 all have 5 years in a row from 2011 - 2015 if we assume February has 29 days.\nSolution: 2011, 2014, 2016\n\n#### Instrucciones:\nSample Input: The first year the world had two leap years in a single decade was 1392. The last leap year (2004) was a leap year before the last.\nSample Output: In 1900, there were two leap years, including 1900. That year was even a leap year. Therefore, the most recent leap year is 1900 which had 5 leap years in a decade starting with 1908 and ending with 2007.", "answer": "A: botanic garden"}

This is because, as the survey shows, people who do not like their lives tend to be older, whereas people who love their lives are younger. My reasoning is that the older people tend to live fulfilling lives compared to the younger ones. This means that they do not have things in their minds that they think are missing from their lives, which they think should have happened or could have happened or should make them feel content about their lives.\n\n#### Task 4\nMy response to this is 166.

This is not a problem with a formula, this is a question that needs to be solved with the correct value.\n2. This is an incorrect answer. The values are mixed up. The value should have been: 128.\n3. This is an incorrect response. To solve this problem, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:\n\n${150-12} + 3 = 128 - 12\\$\t\t(1)\\\n${150 - 3} + 3 = (128 - 3)\\$\t(2)\\\n(182 - 12) \\div (158 - 3) = 2\\$\t(3)\\\n${31}\\div {155}\\$ = 0.2$\t\t(4)\\\nTo Solve this problem: $0.2 \\times 6 = 1.20$\n\n4.

{"text": "A: injury\n\nB: beauty\n\nC: late\n\nD: mistakes\n\nE: annoyed\n\nAnswer: \n\n##### Explanation: \nThe first case that happens when a grooming takes more than 12 hours is that the groomer will get injured. The client can complain and request for compensation and the next appointment will take place. \n\n\n\nWhen a second groomer is hired, an appointment is created with the start times, the appointment duration, and the end time. The appointment duration is when each groomer works on a client. Each groomer is responsible for 6 clients at a time. Each groomer will be assigned 30 appointments while one new appointment is created for each client each hour. Each appointment has many groomers working for it simultaneously, the number is dependent on the duration of the grooming.\n\nWhen a grooming takes longer then it was expected, one of the groomers are injured and another groomer will be assigned to the client. When multiple groomers are assigned to a client, the client is not happy and a late fee has to be applied. A late fee is given by the client to the groomer as compensation.\n\nWhen a third groomer joins the team, three appointments are created for each client, and the next appointment starts when the last appointment ends. When a grooming takes more time than the expected time, the next appointment is delayed. If more groomers leave, more clients will be delayed. More groomers will be hired and new appointments will be created. Each appointment is scheduled and there is no reason to delay another one. If more groomery joins, there is no reason for client to delay because a grooming takes more hours.\n\n\n\n##### Test data:\n\nInput: \tEach groomer requires 6 clients to groom at a time.\n\tNumber of groomers: 3 groomers, which means each groomer takes the responsibility to do 30 appointments at the same time.\n\nOutput: \t30 appointments for each groomer.\n\nInput:  Number of groomers:\n3\n\tNumber of appointments per groomer is:\n\nOutput:\tThe number of appointments per groom: 10, which means for every groomer there are 10 appointments at the", "answer": "C: late"}

(Assume all times will be the same, even at the equator.)\n\n### Solution\nThe speed at the equator is 29,830 kilometers per hour. If we assume a constant velocity and no deceleration or acceleration along the journey, then, if an astronaut runs at an average speed of 21 kilometers every hour running in a circle around the Earth, the astronaut would need to run a distance of 6,35,20,000 meters around the Earth. As we know, the circumference of the Earth is a little more than 40,000 kilometers, thus, the astronaut would run around the Earth 428,804 times in order to complete the required distance. As such, the answer to the question is that it would take 33,300 times longer for the astronaut to gain the effective weight he would gain by going from Earth to the equator than if he ran around the Earth 20 times.", "answer": "C: michigan"}

You saw one of your classmates at the event so you took her name badge and looked up her number on the Internet. You were able to find her name badge on the Internet. Would this solve your problem? Explain your answer.\n\n### Solution: \nAnswer 1.\n\nA: If one chooses A, the answer that could be correct could also be B, as it helps one to read the train and bus route information. If one chooses C, the answer could be either A, B, or C, as it could give directions and help one to find out some information. Answer choice D and E are incorrect as there is no need to use the tool for this answer.\n\nAnswer 2.\n\nB: We", "answer": "C: maps"}

Financial challenges are already here for millions of people of working age and the vast majority of them are not prepared for this eventuality. The majority of our financial challenges arise between the ages of 30 and 60, when our incomes and expenses increase, but we have less of both.

We are now in a global financial world \u2013 a world where globalisation has brought business closer to home and where people, both businesses and individuals, are increasingly interconnected, both economically and culturally.

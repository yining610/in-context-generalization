If you get your choice all wrong and can't proceed to the next step, do not give up! Just try another method.\n\nThe input string is a list of characters:\n\ne.g. The input string is \u201c12.5 567.8\u201d\n\nThe input string must end with a space\n\nand in the above example, after removing all spaces, you can remove periods:\n\nYou can then remove all digits (12.5 12.5), \u201c.\u201d (12.5), and \u201ce\u201d (12.5e), then divide by two to get 6.25.\nLastly, the output must be a multiple of three: in this case, 18. The output is 6.25 divided by 3, so you multiply by 3 to get: 6.25 x 3 = 18.75, then keep rounding 19 and you get 18; 18 is a multiple of 3, so you got it right.\n\nThe next challenge below (Input: 12.5 67 253 511.8) is more difficult because there are multiple decimal places.\n\nYou can convert your string to a 2-element list or a Java String array by doing the following:\n\nnew String[] { \"12.5 23.4 67 26 4\" }\n\nTo remove all spaces, you can loop through the list or use regular expressions. In Python, you could do:\n\nfor i in s:\nif (not i ==''):\n    print(i)\n\nIn Java, you could do:\u200b\ns.replace(\" \",\"\");\n\nFor the first step, use Regex.replaceAll\n\nTo remove periods, you can iterate over the string and check if character is '.'. If it is, you output an empty string.\n\nTo get rid of the numbers, loop through each item in the array or string and check if character == \"0\" or \"1\" or \"2\" or \"3\"", "answer": "E: evil"}

How far is the friend's house from yours assuming his house is on the same route and always takes half an hour longer than the time he stays at your place?\nOutput: 0\n\\end{code}\\strong{My Answer:} The above question is based on time. I know we cannot use time but we can use the given condition. But the answer should be 0.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\nThe distance to your friend\u2019s house should be the same each time you head home; he\u2019s on the same route at the same time.\n\nYou leave my house at 10 AM and get home at 2 PM.\n\nHe leaves my house at 6 PM and gets home at midnight.\n\nAs you leave simultaneously he takes half an hour longer to get back; so the trip is 5 hours, or 12 blocks.\n\nNow you leave at 6 PM together; you\u2019ve been traveling for only 5 hours.\n\nAt this point you are even with the friend\u2019s car and he continues traveling for 5 more hours while you do not change speed. Then you both arrive at your homes simultaneously.\n\nLet p= friend\u2019s car, q= your car\n\nThe question is: If the friend\u2019s car leaves my house at 2 PM and gets home at 10 PM how far is the friend\u2019s car?\n\nThe simple answer is: The friend\u2019s car stays in the \u201csame place\u201d for 5 hours.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nSo at 2pm (q goes back), p continues for 5 more hours(10pm), so they start travelling together at 10 am. And then at 10pm they will reach the destination at the same time. So, distance for p will be zero.\n\nComment: The difference seems to be between which question to pick as answer", "answer": "B: hotel"}

They have already purchased two buses, which can each hold 12 passengers. In addition, they have enough capital to buy more buses, if needed.

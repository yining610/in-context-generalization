So when looking at Example 5, it's easiest to break it into the following problems:\n\n1) What is the total number of slices in all the pizza? (Pizza A & B have 78 slices and Pizza C & D has 510 slices)\n2) What is the difference of the number of slices in pizza A and pizza B? (462 slices)\n3) What is the difference between the total number of sliced and the number that is read in each book? (462 - 5 = 457)\n4) What is Giselle's total number of slices? (120 + 457 = 577 slices)\n\n5) How much money does each shopper get? Since the money given to each book is used to buy items, it's enough to say that $120 < $115 < $115 + $120 so the shopper gets: $115. For an interesting variation of this problem, see Example 6, where a similar problem is given, for which a recursive solution is needed.\n\nThis example should give you a taste of how to attack such problems.

{"idx": 266, "text": "D\n\n## Solution\n\nFor most of these, I found that to get the correct answer one has to take advantage of the fact that the answers end in the same digit, so for example if the answer is 4, the answers can never end in 3 or in 2.\n\nThe only exception is the second question. I did not understand why the answers always had a factor of 2. In the end I realized though that the answer can only be the least number from my choices.\n\nIt seems that in cases where all the answers have a number of the form y * 2 where y is some integer (e.g. a question asking for all numbers in a sequence) we can always choose the answer that has one more digit. Therefore in case like the fourth question, the answer can never be even, since we have already accounted for all answers with 1, 1+2, and their variations.\n\nThe fifth question is really weird, no answer was in the sequence of my choices (4, 9, 16, 25, 36). 3, 1/6, 2/3, and 3/2 also do not fit as my choices. 5/2, 5/4, and 7/5 are the only rational numbers not in the sequence that I can find.\n\nThe sixth question was actually quite intuitive. All the ratios are equivalent to 4:1, and 1 is equivalent to the minimum answer (38).\n\nThe eighth question has a similar approach as the earlier one, and makes use of numbers divisible by 1 (e.g. 2, 1, 2, 1) to get the total (0) after all the numbers are added.\n\nThe ninth question is even easier, it asks for the number of ways the task can be achieved, with no requirement on it actually being done.  We can easily get 5,4,2,0.\n\nThe tenth question is related to the third question, but different. You need not find two times one.\n\nThe eleventh question is related to the sixth question. It makes me wonder whether the number of ways to obtain a required number is the same as when you don't limit yourself to a particular number of elements. For example, 1/2 has 0 elements, but by starting with 1", "answer": "E: front door"}

When Mary used 3 stickers each, the number of stickers p decreased by 6, and so now the number of stickers left p - 6.\n\nHence, (original number of stickers) = (number of remaining stickers) + 6 = 89 (89 + 6 = 95)\n\nWhen Mary used 7 stickers to 6 pages, the number of remaining stickers p - 7 = 89 - 7.

You do this by counting the number of cows that have gone 'out' once (the ones that have crossed the fence). You then subtract this by the number of cows 'in', as this is the number of cows you can't find.This will give you an answer of positive 4.Now you need to find how many days it is going to take to solve this problem. You will be able to get the answer once you are able to solve this question.This is an example of a problem that would be solved using recursion. Recursion is a programming technique where a subroutine calls itself with the same or different inputs.In recursion, the problem is solved with the help of the initial problem. As the depth of recursion increases, the function calls itself. So, the question gets the deeper into the function and becomes more and more difficult.\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src =\"https://github.com/./master/graphs_and/algorithms/images/image_209.png\"/></p>", "answer": "D: play piano"}

From `30-20` we have 10. Therefore, the output will be `-1\u00d73`, which is 10.\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A.\n\nThe function `value(3)` will be called, and it will return value(20) (which is 28).\nThe function `value +20` is 2\u00d73 in this case.\n\nTherefore, the new val of `value(3)` is 46, which is the correct answer.", "answer": "E: cellar"}

Try to think outside the box and use your creativity.\n\nImagine that you want to give your brother, grandfather and cousin a birthday present but you can only afford to give one of them a very small gift. The smallest gift you can buy costs only one dollar. You are allowed to buy 3 gifts, but each gift you buy will increase the size of every present you give by 1%. So the second gift you buy will let you buy something that is equal to 2% of the smallest gift, and the third gift will let you buy something equal to 3%. Your cousin wants to buy the smallest gift, but he doesn't know what you have bought. He wants to know what you've bought so he tells you that if your gift is bigger than the smallest gift, then he wants it. If your gift is smaller than the smallest gift, he'll do his best to make sure that he doesn't get a smaller gift. You have several gifts in mind that you will only buy for certain people but you still want to get the smallest gift possible because all your gifts are expensive. How do you make sure that your cousin gets the smallest gift?\nOutput:  I buy a 2.6% gift as my second gift.\n\nThis challenge is for advanced students.

I think every programming course I've taken requires that you understand the purpose and logic of programming better in order to improve.  But, I've also found as I go through these exercises, that they do increase my programming prowess.\n\nI think I started off really bad... I used to memorize the loop structure because I didn't understand anything other than a while loop.  But, I understand this a little better now.  So, I'll definitely be practicing it in the next course.\n\nMy programming structure needs a lot of work... I still have some habits that I need to break.  Like, sometimes when I print multiple variables, I put the data type at the end instead of at the beginning.  I'm still learning this process and I know it's going to take time to really form good habits.\n\nAside from these, I think this code shows that I put some effort into understanding what makes it run.  I made sure I didn't just memorize the syntax of the commands or even a couple examples.  Instead, I made sure that I tried to break the input into as many variables as I could and I kept everything organized.\n\nI also like the fact that I made sure", "answer": "B: need for rest"}

No even numbers are multiples of 1 to 12. (We know that because the multiples of 2 end at 100)The sum of the multiples of 5 up to 12 is 425\nThe number 10 is the only multiple of 2 which is < 100, therefore option B stands true. For option C : To get a perfect square of a number you need to square the number itself and divide it by 2. The square of 9 (10 to the power of 2) is 81, which is smaller than 64, therefore it is not the perfect square of 9. For option C we can say option D is the perfect square of 10 (102 / 2). \nThe number 8 is the only multiple of both 4 and 6. The square of 8 is 64, therefore option E is the perfect square of the number 4. \nHaving the same birthday of their third child, the fourth child will definitely be 8 years older than the fourth child. \nIf Giselle has $ 120: Option A, B & C are true. For Giselle the equation of the number of days she has been born will be: (1 + x)^y = 120 (here in options A, B & C y =1,2,3 ) Therefore, x = 1,2,3 respectively. Whenever x=2 the equation will hold good. i.e. Giselle will share her age with the fourth child.\nIf Phil's birthday comes after the birthday of Isaballa, the only way in which Isabella's birthday could be in Phil's birthday is when the two are separated by 3 years.

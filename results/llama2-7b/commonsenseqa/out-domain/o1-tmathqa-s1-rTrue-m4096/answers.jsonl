That is, you'll need to call `get_choice()` in the main() function.\n\n# Input:\n\n* For the method, you're taking two strings, and comparing them, return the lower-case string as the response.\n\n# Output:\n\n* Just return the lower-case letter. If the user types, \"A\", the response would be \"a\".\n\n* The returned string is a char. Char means \"character\". The string is one character, but you don't need to return a one character string. (Remember, it's a char, not a int). It's because sometimes, especially for games, you might need more than one character, and a single char just doesn't work without storing the character name, like so:\n* return \"A\" for the character A\n* return \"b\" for the character b\n* return \"B\" for the character B\n\n* Return an int. Return 0 if the strings are the same, and return 1 if they are not the same.\n\n* Remember, you don't want to test whether they're the same. There are no errors in that, so if the user types, \"b\" when the user input is \"B\", there is no error. We are just returned the value. It's like checking if a string is a palindromes, we just return true or false. The return statements, are the return values you're returning.

It's unclear whether the answer is 88% - why would it be 12%?\n\nAnswer: `12 % of ` 80 is 8.66\n\n`is 100 %`, so 8.66 / 100 % = 86.6%\n\nComment: So 8.66 % is 86.6 %?\n\nComment: The OP already asked what's 12%... why are you suggesting what's 11.2%?\n\nComment: Sorry I didn't get you\n\nComment: \"12% is 86%\"? It's like saying \"12 minutes is 86 minutes\". It's not correct. You must remember that percentages is a ratio of number of quantities divided by 100. So 12% is 1/8 which is 12.5%.\n\nAnswer: You can do this by rounding 80 to 100 and then subtracting 20, which is one quarter of 80. I assume you get 86.66 from your division in the question but I do not know what you want to round it to. So your answer is 80/0.12 = 66.66 rounded to 67%.

In the next procedure the third  digit is subtracted from the first or second or third digit whichever is larger to get the new number, In the procedure is done again and again unti the new number is 1. For example, 368 minus 8 is 360. In the first procedure the first  digit is 3 so the sum of the digits is subtracted and that is 3. In the next procedure  the third digit is subtract from the first or second which is larger so it subtracted from the first and that value is 3 less than 8 which is 5. So far we have 368 minus (-3) or 368-3 is 365. The sum of the digits is 5, subtract 3 from 5 and this is 2. We are done so the new number is 2. In the second procedure we now subtract 2 from the largest digit. That 2 is from the 1. The largest digit", "answer": "B: fairgrounds"}

After winning...\n#### Output: B:\n#### Detailed Explanation:\n##### Problem 1:O(2^n) - It was the question 9 where 2^n was less than 9 and therefore our answer must be less than or equal to 9.\n##### Problem 2:O(nlogn) - Since we have a set of numbers then log(set of numbers) would be O(n) since we have to count each number but since we are not sorting the elements. So then log(n) would be O(1) as we are not dealing with a sorted set of items therefore nlogn would be O(2^n).\n##### Problem 3:O(n) -  This is again a simple problem since we have to get the numbers in ascending order and we can use merge sort. Therefore a complexity of O(n) is valid.\n##### Problem: O(n) - For any element in the tree we can easily convert it to its value as a number. Therefore this is a one time computation and can be a part od the function where we have an if statement to check if the element is num. if it is num then return num otherwise return 0. Now we will see how many nodes there are in the tree. It can be a constant of 3 because it can always be true. (Height of tree < number of nodes).  Then it should be O(n).\n#### Detailed Explation:", "answer": "B: in motion"}

What is the price, in dollars, for the rose-gold band alone?\nOutput: 2073.4 (rounded to nearest cent)\n\n#### Note\n\n##### Solution:\n##### In case 1, the output is 310. We should note that in the input the rental ends at the first day.\n##### In case of 2, we should be able to solve the question by the following equation : $30 + 60(60) = $30 + 3600 = 3960 (because $30+ $190 is less than 3960).\n##### In case for 3, the output is 40. The solution is the following equation: $190 > 50, thus $190-$50 = $140, $140/20 = $7, and thus the answer is 7 days.\n##### In 4, we should note that the amount of days is irrelevant, since the charging is independent from the days. Thus, the output is 20 because the price/item is $20, multiplied by $40 to sum 800. (if it had ended at day 14, the output would have been 800, since $50/day times 14 are not a factor of 800).\n##### Finally, in 5. $4320 is equal to $2800+ $1999.99. Note that $1999 is equal to $1900+$499.99, which is still greater than $1900(rose-gold). Therefore we get that the output is $2800.", "answer": "A: botanic garden"}

After that, you will write a function \u201cdoubleD\u201d, declared in a \u201cmyFunctions.js\u201d file. The function will take two arrays, one containing car rental data and another having the data about rental price per day for a given length of the period (one day, one week, two weeks, etc.). The function should have two inputs, given as two separate parameters. The function should calculate the total price paid.\n\nThe first input (car array) should contain car rental data: length of rental in kilometers, rental price per day and total number of days of the rental. It should be declared in the variable \u201crental\u201d. \n\nThe second input (price array) should contain rental price per day, such as $30/day, $190/week and so on.  It should be declared in a variable \u201cprices\u201d.\n\nUse the above rules and declare the two arrays.  Write your function.  Call and run the function to see its result.  Declare the function in a single line and write the function code.  Then, call the function and display the result.\n\nThe function name should be \u201cdoubleD\u201d, and it should have the below parameters, declared as follows:\n\nvar rental = [10,300,2]\nvar prices = [30,190,700,15]\n\nIn the two given parameters, each number element is an individual integer.\nFor example, \u201c10\u201d in the first element represents 10 km.", "answer": "A: in cinema"}

{"idx": 469, "text": "A\n\nQuestion 1: We start by finding the number of times we will pay $30, for which we use the mod operator % to find how many times the 30 will repeat in the sequence. Since you will not pay $30 again, you will end paying $130. We then add to the series in order to get a total price, giving you the answer $310.\n\nQuestion 2: We will use the MOD operator % to find the number of whole days needed to drive that distance, based on the fact that the first day is 1, and each day after will be 1 more than the last until the day is 60, when we will start back from 60 to 1. Adding 60 to the whole drive is for the return trip, so we use the + operator. With this we obtain the answer 40 days, and 40/60ths would be the number of hours needed to make the trip, which will be 30 hours total.\n\nQuestion 3: This question will require a little more work. We again start with the question of how many times will Jason pay $50.0 in the 14 days. Once again that can be done using the % operator. He will only pay $ 50.0 in his total payment, which means that (14 - 1)/14 will be the number of times he will pay $50 in the overall payment. Adding to the series, gives us a total of $800.\n\nQuestion4: This question again requires quite a bit of work, first to determine how many notes and rests there are in a minuet in fourfour time. In this case, we will be looking for 3/4 note, so that will be 2 notes per measure. That puts the answer at 1+2+3\u2026\u2026.8+9=17. We now need to determine the rests.  A rest is the silence before the next note, so for every 8 notes, a rest is placed down. Since a minuet only has 17 notes, we see that there will be only 1 rest per eight note measure. With this in mind, the musician will play the notes (2,4,6,8,8,6,4,2) which is 17 notes and then rest for", "answer": "B: orchestra"}

{"idx": 517, "text": "E\n  Solution:\n  Input #1: [96 894 682 643 555]\n  Output #1: 310   \n  Explaination:The car-rental agancy charges $30/per day for a car and $190 for renting a car for an entire week. Therefore, it's $190 for a whole week or more. Jennie rented the car for 11/14 = 7/7 days. Therefore, they rented the car for less than a week that made them pay $30/per days. That makes $30 x 7 = 210. Since they charged $190 for 1 week, their total number of days will be more than 1 week to equal to $190 so it has 190 - 210 = -20.

{"idx": 965, "text": "E\n\n\n## Multiple Choice Answer\nThe answer is 310.\n\n## Explanation\nFor the first question, the expression we have is simply cost = $30 + $30.\nThis means the number of days that the rental will be for is essentially the total sum of the $30 cost for the number of days.\nSo for 11 days of rental, we would end up paying $330 total for rental costs. We then subtract this number from the total cost of rental, which is $530. So the total cost subtracted from the sum of the $330, we subtract $190. The $190 is the cost for the first week. \n\nAfter solving for the answer value, you can use the following steps to understand how to get to your answer:\n$$330 + 190 = 520$$\n\nHowever in the worded problem, we can not write out the addition symbol because the instructions did not explicitly state that we were allowed to.  Instead, we need to remember that \n\n$$\\text{cost} = \\$30 + \\$30$$\n\n\nBecause the expression doesn\u2019t contain any arithmetic operations, it is safe to assume that we\u2019ve calculated the correct cost and that the sum $60 is equal to cost. \n\n## Another question\nThe second question was actually similar to the first question in terms of the problem solving.\nThe answer comes out as 40.\n\n## Another question \nThe third question was also similar to the previous two questions.\nThe answer comes to 800.", "answer": "C: hedgerow"}

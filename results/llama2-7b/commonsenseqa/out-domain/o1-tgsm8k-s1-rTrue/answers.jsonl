There are three types: integers, strings and bools. \n\n### 1) Integer variables \nInteger variables can store whole numbers and their negative values. Every integer variable is followed by a capital letter and a number with only one or two digits. For example, *pi* is an integer, and the variable called *age* can store the number of years old a person is.\n\n### 2) String variables \n**Strings** are a collection of many characters. A string is created with a *s*. For example, Mary likes ice cream sundaes is a string, and the variable called name can store what someone's name is.\n\n## Task1: Variables and data types\n\n## 1) Variables\nA variable is a container that stores a value. By default, a variable is nothing but an empty container. A variable can store data of two types: an integer or a string. Some variables can store both data of these types. The difference between them lies in the ability of the variable to store the given type of data:\n\tinteger\n   \tstring\n\tboolean\nThe list of variables and the type of values they can store are shown below:\n\nVariable     \tType of data that a variable can store          \n\tpi       \ta value of type integer          \n\tage      \ta value of type string          \n\tname     \ta value of type and string \n\talive\tBoolean value\n\n\n## 2) Data types\nThe two types of data a variable can store are known as data types.

If so, give an example of what those values are, and explain why you used them.\u201d\n5.  There is no need to comment your code, but we need to see that you took the time to read the question and answer each part.\n6.  We expect that you will submit at least a _hint_ for each question that we did not answer correctly.\n7.  Don't use comments to say that there are no hints. (For example, no hint means \u201cno clue\u201d. There's nothing we can do in that situation.) Hint: \n\nInput:  Write a script that will take \nin an integer from the user, subtract one-from it (so that they answer will be lower than the number you enter first), \nsave it to a file on the system with that same integer name as the file, then display the contents of that file.\nOutput: A file on the system called \u201c3023\u201d will be the contents of the file.\n\n### Instruction: Answer the following multiple choice question\n\n-  We do not need specific code examples for how to add and subtract numbers.\n-  You may need to do some simple reading, since you may be required to add two whole numbers.\n-  This question is for your own understanding of how to do math, not a programming question. If you can\u2019t do math for some reason, I can\u2019t help you here. Try to teach yourself how to add and subtract two whole numbers, but if you can\u2019t, then don't ask for help.\n-  We won\u2019", "answer": "C: curry"}

{"text": "The only thing that makes sense is that you buy these items together is when you are buying them for other people. Maybe they are sick or injured and need these things to take care of them. The drug store doesn't make sense because that's where you get medical stuff for yourself. The hospital makes sense if you are going to do something unhealthy like a haircut. The bedroom is where you live, not a drugstore. The car is usually where you get things for yourself, not other people.

{"text": "A) A and B are both correct. But if all rooms face inside then they would have curved walls. But if they face outside then they are square, of different sizes, or have doors or windows (depending on if the house has a backyard or street view).\n\n### Solution\nFirstly, we have to define our function which takes value n and returns value f(n), we have defined below function with our required data which we want. We have used if else statement or looping in our function to compare value. This time you need to write your own function which give you nth Fibonacci number and return value.\n\n```\nfunction fibonacci(n,prev){\n    if(n===1) \n    {\n        console.log(\"0\");\n        return \"0\";\n    }\n    else if (n===2)\n    {\n        //Console.log(prev+\" + \"+n+\" = \");\n        return prev+n;\n    }\n\n    else \n    {\n       let temp = prev;\n    //else if \n       fibonacci(n-1,temp);\n       console.log(prev+\" \"+n);\n       return fibonacci(n - 1,prev);\n    }\n}\n```\nSecondly, you need to define the function which return the square root of a number. Firstly we have to define a function to determine whether a number is square or not? We have defined below function to check such type of number.\n\n```\n//Function to calculate if number is square\n\nfunction isSquare(num){\n  //If the value is divisible by 1 then its not a square or else its a square\n  if(Math.sqrt(num)%1!==0)\n  return false;\n  else return true;\n}\n```\nthen we have to define recursive function to calculate square root of number and return a root of square number, if number is square true or false.\n\n```\n\nfunction squareRoot(number,count,sqrt){\n  //Assign counter value to 1 and the if the number is not square then \n//call the function with 0 as number\nif(isSquare(number)){\n    //Console.log(string + \"=\");\n\n    if (count === 0) {\n        return 1", "answer": "D: doors and windows"}

Otherwise, add the key-value pair to the cache, and return the value.\n\n> Note: The best effort is to implement the algorithm and code in C++, but you are not limited to C++. You may also implement the algorithm and the code in another language.\n\n### Input:\n```\nInput:\n    LRUCache lRUCache = new LRUCache(10);\n    lRUCache.put(0,3);\n    lRU Cache.put(0, 9);\n    lRUHash.put(2, 2);\n    lRU Hash.<0, 9, 2>;\n```\nOutput: 2\n\n### Solution:\nIn this question, the data structure we used was Hash Map. When the function get invoked, we look at the hashMap < key, value, age> where age = 0. If age = 0,", "answer": "B: appear beautiful"}

I assume you want to calculate this in total (not daily wage) and that wage in the problem is the same for every year over 40 years.\n\nI suggest to put the 40 in parentheses first so 51 years old.  I suggest putting the hours a week first so weeks first, but I will leave it up to you.  We also will add up the wage of $26.00 per hour for 40 hours (just divide by 2 if you want it as a daily wage) since that is our total wage amount.  I suggest adding the total wage first so we can subtract the total wage from the years worked to get total hours work, but I will leave that up to you.  Finally, I assume you will subtract the 40 hours a weeks from the years worked (to get total hours). \n\nNow I suppose the solution was for you to work for 40 years and not 80 but this is not correct.

Describe your programming experiences?\n\nAs a high school junior in South Korea, I took the C programming course (1 credit) for my junior year and got an \u201cA\u201d on the final exam. After the course, I kept on continuing with coding the whole year as an individual learning without any class by myself during my senior year. I learned how to create web pages, web servers, and database management system(DBMS). I found out that these skills help me to be an efficient worker when I need them, such as analyzing the source codes and debugging the programs. As a result and I think there are no more things I can add when I say that I do not regret the experience I had as a teenager.\n\n\n2.\n\n### 2. Who most influenced your decision to develop and enhance computer programming knowledge as part of your liberal arts education?\n\nI chose the major of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) because I got in touch with programming from my high school. I learned the basic programming skills and created my own web applications. I learned that the computer can perform what I give its order to perform efficiently and accurately. I got an opportunity to work for a company in the field of programming which led me to work on developing and enhancing my programming knowledge. I found out that I can use programming as the skills of analyzing and debugging the programs and my problem solving skills. I think my parents influenced me the most because they always support everything I do.\n\n\n\n3.\n\n### Describe what excites you most about learning programming in a liberal arts setting and your career after graduation?\n\nI cannot wait to develop my programming skills and to work on some innovative projects with my friends or groupmates. One of the most exciting features in my career is that it gives me the opportunity to improve how to work with a group of people and enhance the social skills. I also see the future of liberal art to the extent of where I can make a better world. We cannot create a better world without learning programming.\n\n\n4", "answer": "E: work"}

Why might this be? Choices:  It takes time for takeout food to arrive.  When people are looking for takeout, they want to dine in rather than waiting for food delivery.  People may be afraid to try new options by ordering online because they could be disappointed with their experience.

Every other answer is at least 3 letters long, with the exception of \"Brother\", which is just two.\n\nSo, to test for if a word of length n is the only answer with length < n, you could either have a for loop going through each letter and checking every combination and storing it in an array, OR a binary search checking if all other answers of length n+1 are also answers of length n.\n\nAs explained on wikipedia, the binary search algorithm searches data in sorted order. It works this way:\n\nLet the length of the string be n, the upper limit be len, and the lower limit be 0. Then it does this:\n\n 1) if len <= n, return the whole string.\n    (in the example, this is len < 5, so return the whole \"Brother\" string because no other string is shorter than 5 letters).\n 2) if n >= len, return the empty string (\"\") because nothing is shorter than 5.\n 3) do the following in steps 1/2 until you get the answer:\n    (1). find the middle value x, such that len/2 - 1 <= x <= len/2: x = n/2 or x = ((n+1)/2) - 1.\n    (2).

{"text": "D: I should burn it to the ground.\n\nInstruction:This problem is about a certain machine that is used to generate 5 random numbers from the interval [0,5]. Each time the machine is activated, it produces five independent, identically distributed, Bernoulli(p) random variables, i.e., the five numbers are assumed to be independent and identically distributed Bernoulli(p/5) random variables. For example, if p = 1/3, the numbers are assumed to be Bernoulli(1/3) random variables, i=1/3, 1/3, 0, 1/3 and 1/3 if the five numbers are 5, 5, 5/5, 5 and 5. Your task is to write a program that produces random samples and prints statistics on them. The number of samples must be at least 100,000. (Large numbers of samples allow you to observe the sampling variability of the machine. It is easy to determine such the \"best\" number of samples by just printing the results of your program.\n\nInstruction 2 :For example, when p = 1/5, the sample statistics are 0.5452836, 0.1838788, 0.2423105, 0.0291456 and 0.0892652.

Use diagrams to connect your thoughts on coding or data flow, Use graphs to compare variables. \n\nThe audio and video methods can help you understand when you code or when you have a meeting about code. You can also use video to record things you do not fully understand. Watch it again and see if it is clearer to you. \n\nAnother strategy is using a process map, it can help you if you are a beginner in programming. It allows you to record a process by step and follow it along when you come back to it to review it. It helps you not to get lost.\n\nThere is also the mindmap method, which is used in programming as well, it is similar to process maps, but you use symbols instead of text to show relationships. This helps you to see a bigger picture.\n\nThe mind game method is one of the most recommended strategies by the Harvard University,  you solve problems with the mind to improve you programming skills.

A bull terrier can be a Pit Bull terrier, a Pit Bull type dog that is not a Pit Bull terrier but looks the same and acts similarly, a Bull Pit, or a Pit Bull type dog of any type (a Bull Pit is a Pit Bull type dog with a Pit Bull terrier in its lineage). A bull terrier is different from a terrier, or any type of Pit Bull; there are other true terriers, many Pit Bull types do not have bull terrier blood, and some Pit Bull types are even dogs who were mixed with Pit Bulls (such as the American Staffordshire terrier, a close cousin of the American Pit Bull terrier).\n\nOutput:The correct option is D.\nInput:The sun rises in the east and sets in the west. Many people say it does this because the sun is an object moving through space. This is also true to some extent. Yet there is a more important principle about how the sun'moves' in different parts of the sky, which is called the diurnal motion of the sun. The sun's daily motion is important, because when the sun is directly overhead at noon it is also directly overhead if you view it from a very large globe. The globe rotates on an axis, so wherever you are on the planet (at any point on the globe), you see the sun as if it was moving in a circle. The sun's path in the sky depends on your point of view; if you are on the north side of the Earth then daytime in the summer is a long stretch when the sun always appears to be setting in the north. If you are on the south side of the Earth, daytime in the summer involves the same long stretch where the sun always appears to keep setting in the south. \n\nOutput:The answer is B.\nInput:A number of studies have shown the benefits of a high fat diet on weight loss and improved health.

What if one is holding the earth, and one's hand is on the earth, and the other hand is holding the earth, both hands are on the earth, and one of the hands is on top of the other hand? In effect, you have two earth-sized hands on the earth. In order to explain how to tell which one is which, we have to explain two people on one globe, or two hands on one earth. We could explain that because people know that they are people, that they know where the person ends and the globe begins. They have skin that shows that they are on earth. They don't know  exactly where they are with the skin, but they know that they are a person and can communicate about it. Well, if they have two gloves on their hands, both gloves say that they are both gloves. If one person were to reach under the gloves, and touch their own real hand, they know that the hand they are touching is their actual hand and not the glove. So the glove tells them about the glove.

This is often expressed as 3 \u00d7 5 \u2013 2.\n-By completing this \"2\" subtraction, we get the final number 3 \u00d7 5 \\(- 2\\).\n\nIn general, when we subtract two numbers, we first subtract the smaller number. For example, if you have to remove 6 apples from 12 apples, which amount of apples do you remove first? One would subtract 6 from 12 to get 6. It can be subtracted from it's smallest amount.\n\nIn this problem, 2 is smaller than 3. So we know that we should subtract 2 from 5.\n\nThus, the answer is 3 \u00d7 5 = 15, and to be more precise it is 15-2 = 13.\n\n### Questions:\nWhen a car traveling at 60 miles per hour passes a vehicle traveling at 40 miles per 12 hours, you're car passes the other car at a rate of\n* The answer for this question can be calculated by subtracting 40 from 60, yielding a result of 20 miles per 10 hours.

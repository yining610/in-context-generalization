Choices:  A: closet B: library of congress C: classroom D: in bed E: desk<n><n>### Response:		<n>##Explanation: <n>You would keep a book on the desk. <n>```<n><n>##Explanation<n>When you are putting an equation into slope form, you should start with point slope form, in this way: slope form y=mx+b The variables would be M and b. When you use the point slope form, you would have that equation in one form. However, what you have to do is find m and b by plugging in x1 in this equation, x =2, and y=2.2. Now let's plug this in.<n>You want the constant term at the end, so the first thing you need to do is subtract the y value from the y1. In this case, it is 2.2-2=-0.2. Therefor, m = -0.2. The last thing you have to do is change one of the x values into mx value. Since this is in mx, you would have mx into 1. You would have 1.2. Now you want to have your mx for one coordinate point, and one for each point. Therefore, you plug -0.2 and 1.0 into that and now you should have mx of 0.8 and the constant.

We would put it in a closet. A closet has a door that we can open to store the chair or fold it into.<n><n>### Response<n><n>I would put a folded chair beside the beach because it will be close to where it is needed.<n><n>### Rationale: Close to where it is needed<n><n>-  We are told to put the chair close to where it is used.<n>-  The chair will be used in the beach and it will be close if the chair were put beside the beach.

Choices:  A: living room B: dog park C: basket D: small apartment E: big house<n><n>### Response:		<n>- I would use the answer choice “D.” In this situation, because the dog is in a small apartment and it is only using part of the house then it seems like the dog has all the space it needs if it is only in one room.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>- If this was a dog out in the park then then the dog would likely feel like it has all the space in the word when it is being in the large, green grassy area. The point with the example is that the dog was inside rather than outside.<n>- I know that dogs often feel like they have all the space in the room or house that they are living in if they only go in one room, this is why I choose option “D” because it makes sense that in a small apartment the dog feels this way, even though he/she may be indoors.<n>- If the dog was outside in the dog park then it seems to have more space and room to walk and play than if it were just inside of a small apartment.<n>- If this were a dog in the living room then, it seems like it would only feel like having all the space it needed if another dog came to sit with it, as the living room isn’t a place where you can fully be by yourself.<n><n>### Answer Choice E<n>- Although the dog is only in the living room, and not the entire house, the dog still feels like it has all the room in the world to walk around. The dog doesn’t feel like it is limited to that space at all as it has to share the space with no one, so it is more like the dog’s personal space<n>

Choices:  A: auditorium B: office C: synagogue D: confession E: church<n><n>### Response:		C is correct because synagogue is more of a religious place where people sit for prayer<n><n>### Rationales: Synagogues are used as places of worship for Jewish followers. A large meeting hall is known as a synagogue. Prayers are held in this location, and a large number of individuals gather to worship together. This suggests that synagogues are frequently occupied. Synagogues, on the other hand, are not restricted to one particular religion. A synagogue is not only used by Jewish followers of religion; rather, it is widely used. This means that not only do Jewish people use the synagogue, but also people of other religions, and thus a large number of people may be seen sitting in a synagogue. Thus, the answer is C.<n><n>### Input(Demonstration): What type of rock do people use the most for jewelry in North American and European style clothing?

The heart pumps between 5 and 6 quarts (about 5 liters) of blood every day. The pressure of your blood pushing against the walls of your blood vessels keeps you alive. The heart has four chambers: two atria and two ventricles. The left side of the heart performs one job: to supply blood to the lungs, and the right side of the heart performs two jobs: to receive oxygen-poor blood from the body and to send oxygen-rich blood to the body. The right side of the heart has 2 chambers: right atrium and right ventricle. During each heartbeat or pump, the right atrium sends blood to the right ventricle, which pumps blood through the pulmonary artery, to the lungs (to let the red blood cells absorb oxygen). The left atrium receives slightly beutier blood from the lungs, fills the left ventricle, which delivers the blood through the left pulmonary artery through the aorta, around the body.The heartbeat is controlled by electrical signals that travel in a special pathway called the electrical conduction system that starts in the sinoatrial node in the right atrium. These impulses travel through the atria to the AV node, then to the Bundle of His and finally to the ventricles. After each contraction, the heart relaxes and refills the heart chambers, forming another contraction.<n><n>#### 1.

It lost 2/5 which is <<2/5*6=3/5>>3/5 of its limps or <<3/5*6=1.8>>1.8 meter. However since 3 meters equals a meter, the tree lost <<1.8/3=0.6>>0.6/3 meters. The remaining 3/5 = <<3/5*3=1.5>> 1.5 meters is not enough to hold the tree up.<n><n>The tree is now <<2/5*0.6=0.4>> 0.4 meters.  It can be considered collapsed.  It is now unstable because it will not hold itself up.<n><n>Therefore, it has to be cut down.<n><n>#### 1.8<n><n>Answer: 1.8 meters.<n><n>### Input :Why would someone not want to compete in cross-country races with a team of professional athletes?<n><n><p>Choices: A: The cross country race is not fun B: Professionals are faster C: Professionals are stronger D: Professionals are slower E: They will not all fit.<n><n>### Answer: D<n><n>### Instuctions:Answer the following question.<n><n>## Rational:<n><p>Professionals are the best at their sport and are expected to be the most athletic and fastest.

For E, it didn't mention a "store", and sears doesn't specifically mention "sporting equipment", so I eliminated that from the choices. This meant it was more than likely to be either choices A or D. From the options shown, I noted that B mentioned sporting and that was what led me to guess C.<n><n>### Input : What is the next number in the series?<n>3, 9, 27, 81,?<n><n>### Response : 243<n><n>### Dated Explanation of why the answer is correct:<n>According to the question, a sequence that is given are 0 3 0 3 in a sequence of 0 3 3 0 0. Therefore the next number should be 3. The pattern seems to be going for even sequences on odd numbers and odd sequences on even numbers. The number 3 fits into this sequence, just with the wrong numbers. Therefore the next number on this sequence, should have been a number that is a pattern of 27. This would then mean that the answer should be 243.<n><n>### Output:How many minutes are in 15?<n><n>### Demostration:<n>Input: How many minutes are in 48?<n>Rationales in the demo are not important, since this is a multiple choice question<n><n>The question is asking for the number of minutes in 48, which means that the answer is 48 / 60 which equals <<48/60=0.8>>0.8 minutes.

They were intended to be sold in a dairy farm and a grocery store only. Since the compassionate rancher kept the heifers alive and well, he did not allow the heifers to reside in either a slaughterhouse or a grocery store. This means he kept them in his dairy farm or on the countryside where they can live peacefully until they become older cows.<n><n>#### <mark>4</mark><n><n>### Input :Where did the compassiona farmer allow the heifers reside during their last days? A: cattle ranch. B: countrysi de. C: grocery s tore D: sp aughter hou se. E: dairy farm 😎 <n><n>### Response : B<n><n>### Rat ionlae:Th e heifers are not intended to be sold in the slaughterhouse for meat because the compassionate  farmer was just kind and tender to all his animals. In  other words,the farmer does not really like watching the animals suffer. He does not like the smell of blood and the sight of the animals crying in anguish in the farmer's slaughterhouse.  Conversely, the grocery store does not sell animals; it only sells and packages them for people intending to feed their animals in their own houses at home. Therefore, the cows will just roam and wander about the countryside peacefully. Likewise, the heifers live in the farmer  dairy farm because they belong there - as they are supposed to be raised for dairy products. Their kind treatment and compassion makes them the best choice for food products, such as cream, butter, and milk.

Great Relief has nothing to do with feelings at all and is an adjective that relates to physical action rather than a state of mind.

Symphony, Music Store, and Music shop are only relevant.<n>###### Music Store<n>Choices with C and D for Cello are Symphonic and Music, but symphony and music are irrelevant since cello is an instrument that is used primarily in a symphony orchestra.<n>###### Music Shop<n>The group of musicians that would include someone playing the celo would be a symphony orchestra or music shop.<n><n><n><n>### Input<n>What is the average speed of 20697 miles per hour, traveling at such a high speed, is a challenge to compute, though not impossible.<n><n>Rationale: Let’s look at the following scenario to calculate the speed:<n>Suppose we have a train that travels 250 miles and then stops and starts moving 140 miles for 5 times. Suppose the train’s speed was average 40 mph.<n><n>#### Output:<n>In the case, the speed of the train, if we assume the train as the one described above, would be:<n>40mph * 250mph/140mph/(1/5)=<<40*25/1<<40*2= 50mph.<n><n><n>#### 35<n><n>### Output<n>Let us take example of a fighter plane that is moving horizontally at an instantaneous speed of 1800 miles per hour. At t=0, the fighter plane travels 80 miles and then turns around and travels back 80 miles. Given that the speed of the plane in the horizontal direction is constant and constant, write an expression to describe this speed and explain how one might prove that the speed is constant.<n><n>Output:<n>We have a fighter plane that moves horizontally at an initial speed of 80 miles per second. <n>Therefore 80mi/sec * 9 seconds * 60secs/min = 51200/9 * 60 <n>  =512000. The formula can be proven if the plane is measured to travel 80 miles again during the 9 seconds.<n><n>#### 55<n><n>### Input and output<n>A train travels a distance of 70 miles during 15

After the rectangular cabinet and wood he has been given, how wide is the cabinet?<n><n>### Response<n><n>Answer: <<Length=5*width>>5*12=60cm<n><n>### Rationale<n><n>To figure out how wide the cabinet is, all you need to know is the area of 12cm by using the formula A=L*W.<n><n>This means you will first need to figure out the length using the dimensions that it is provided.<n><n>The length is used to find the area. To find the area simply multiply the length times the width and the answer will be your area.<n><n>```javascript<n>area = L * W<n>= 26*12<n>= 312cm  <n>```<n><n>Once you figure out the dimensions all you need to do is apply the formula for the area.<n><n>```<n>area = 2*L*W<n>= 2*(26*12)<n>= 524cm<n>```<n><n>The answer is 524 cm.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Mary had 89 stickers.  She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Rationales: Mary added a total of 7 stickers/page * 6 pages= <<7*6=42>>42 stickers to the 6 other pages.<n>In total, Mary added 3 large stickers + 42 stickers = <<3+42=45>>45 stickers to her journal.<n>Since she started with 89 stickers, she now has 89 - 45 = <<89-45=44>>44 stickers left.<n>#### 44<n>Answer: 44<n><n>### Input:Where would you stand in a line and need a coat if it is cold? Choices:  A: graph B: bank at noon C: good book D: post office E: bus stop<n><n>### Response:		I'm not sure exactly where a lot to stand in a line at, but i believe if it is cold you either would stand at A or D. I think A because you might need some sort of outerwear where C is hot, like a coat and that might be to heavy if it is in the middle of summer and they have the air on. Also like at the bank they may ask for Id and a debit and or cc. But on the other hand if is cold, you will probably have a jacket on and might not even need anything to get at the bank on noon.<n><n>### Rationales:At a bus stop it depends if it is cold or if there is an option to take the train. It can be either A or D. At the bank at noon, there are people standing all around and it is either hot or cold most of the day.<n><n>### Answer: Where would you stand in a long line at the post office in January? A: near the door B: at the teller C: along the wall D: between other lines<n><n>### Input :Where would you stand in line at the cashier at the grocery store in May? Choices: A. near the door   B. at the cashier's cage C. along the wall D. between other lines  <n><n>### Rationale: i thought i was right on my last one but i guess not. A. If it was the middle of may it would get a little hot in the post office but it might still be cold, maybe 60 degrees or so, depending on the weather. So i would go with A. also A will not hold you back from getting a job and stuff so i feel that is a good option to. And also A and D would be best so it would work out in my favor.<n><n>### D<n>i dont think it says anything about what will hold me back from anything.<n><n>### Input<n>Why is it so easy to solve the second one but more difficult to solve this one? What's different between the two questions? (This is a test question for the class and you may want to ask for the answer.)<n><n>Rationale : So i have another option of thinking about this. This was a quiz question, not a test question because my thinking was "Why is it so easy for me to solve the second one in 10

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Mary had 89 stickers.  She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Rationales: Mary added a total of 7 stickers/page * 6 pages= <<7*6=42>>42 stickers to the 6 other pages.<n>In total, Mary added 3 large stickers + 42 stickers = <<3+42=45>>45 stickers to her journal.<n>Since she started with 89 stickers, she now has 89 - 45 = <<89-45=44>>44 stickers left.<n>#### 44<n>Answer: 44<n><n>### Input:There weren't enough chairs for everyone.  What might have to be delayed? Choices:  A: bookstore B: building C: meeting D: office E: coffeehouse<n><n>### Response:		E<n><n>### Demostration:It is possible that all of the choices except for E might be delayed. Since this choice is specific to where all the delays occur, the choice is E.<n><n>### Explanation:There could be a variety of delays due to the amount of people or other scenarios.<n><n>However, it is specified that there weren't enough seats, so the choice is specific to where there is a delay. It is impossible to delay the bookstores, as they obviously weren't the places that needed it. It's equally impossible to delay the office, meeting or coffee house, as everything else is listed before it. So what is left? The building, and we can now easily eliminate everything but for the building. From there, it's not about what we cannot delay, it's about what we can.<n><n>As we can tell from the choices there are also only two choices left, so no other two need to be combined (the building, the meeting place, etc.). If we combine the building and the coffee house, we can eliminate the coffee house from being the choice that is delayed. From here we can cross-out all the other options, leaving us with only the building, and it is now clear choice E is the only option.<n><n>**What happened?**<n><n>**Eliminations**<n><n>**2**  <n>A, B, C<n><n>**1**  <n>E<n><n>![](https://github.com/MatthewWW/LyndaCoursesFall2020/blob/master/LearningProjects/MachineLearningforHumanity/2020-10-11%2016.10.19.png?raw=true)<n><n><n>### Excluding the second option and going with the first, there is only one option left for the 4th one as well now, and only 4 options left as a whole.<n><n>**5**  <n>D<n><n>**4**  <n>E<n>

You have a lot of tasks going on. A new assignment is to have a 5 minute phone call with your parents to update them on everything you’re doing. You get the assignment over the phone about 5 minutes after your last assignment ends.  You should be done with your other task by the time you get on the phone, but it’s hard to tell exactly without an exact clock. What is the max number of minutes you should wait from the start of the first assignment until the time you hang up on the second phone call?<n><n>### Rationales<n>You should give yourself at least 2 minutes between calls. That way, you can let your next task load, and have 5 minutes left for what you’re doing.<n><n>### Max time:<n>#### 30<n>Answer: 30<n><n>### If you were given an assignment with a 5 minute total time, you shouldn’t answer until you’ve gotten to the 4th or 5th minute.<n>#### 15<n>Answer: 15<n><n>Incorrect<n>

E.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>Let's take each one one at a time<n><n>A: shirt pocket: No, a fountain pen won't use up a bunch of ink unless you write lots. You're not going to use up your pen ink if you do small amounts. (Just try it.) Therefore, shirt pocket doesn't work<n><n>B: calligrapher’s hand: Yes, calligraphy is an art form. Calligraphy means writing beautiful handwriting. Calligrapher's can write beautifully, without lots of extra ink.<n><n>C: inkwell: No, inkwell is not used. If anything, it is used TO put ink. So it could contain some, but it is not going to absorb extra in this case<n><n>D: desk drawer: No, desk drawer is not going to absord the ink. No matter how you draw with a fountain pen, it does not use up the amount of ink. Desk drawer may have ink, but not to use up.<n><n>E: blotter: No, it is a piece of paper. It has been printed with a paper pattern. It is paper. It cannot absorb ink.<n><n>### So, the answer is...<n>B.<n><n>![alt image](https://github.com/chapamagic/LISP/blob/master/Images/F2020/Fountain%20pen.PNG)<n><n><n>

She faced a lot of what? Choices:  A: ignoring B: being rude C: disparagement D: contumely E: uncertainty<n><n>### Response:		John's respect for Jill was well-founded.  However, a few unfriendly comments from other people in the office caused John to wonder whether his initial respect for Jill was misplaced.  Because this initial respect was still present, John continued to believe in Jill's abilities, but his trust in her friendship was tarnished slightly by this external challenge.  The other people in the office were disparaging her.<n><n>### Input : A businessman was very reluctant to commit to a multi-million dollar investment in his company.  However, he eventually committed to the investment because it would provide him with a 15% return on initial investment in one year.  He was satisfied with the low (<<<5%>>) return rate on his accounts at the local bank and didn't want to risk losing money at the same rate as was possible in the accounts.<n><n>### Response<n>If he was satisfied with his return rate from the bank of <=<5%>%, it was a risk for him to invest this much money.  If the risk of losing his money was too great, then he would have to accept the <5%>%.  Instead of making the calculated investment, he decided to avoid risking anything.<n><n>### Answer<n><n>#### Not sure 50% of 15 = 14,500<n><n>### Input<n>A salesman visited a potential customer at the customer's home and discovered that the customer's house was in disrepair.  The house had cracked walls that were in need of repairs.  The carpeting was shabby and in need of replacement.  The customer felt that the house was fine but that any repair work would have to wait until the customer's finances improved somewhat.<n><n>### Analysis:<n>I would take this as the customer does not have enough money to pay for the work required to fix the cracks that need to be repaired.<n><n>### Rationales:<n><n>The customer's situation is desperate because the house needs repairs.  They have plenty of repairs, but they can't afford to make them.<n><n>### The salesman is hopeful because he feels the client's business will improve with time.<n>The salesman was hopeful because of this situation.  By fixing the cracks

Choices:  A: music store B: orchestra C: jazz band D: rock band E: music studio<n><n>### Response:		<n>#### Explanation:<n>Rationales: Concertos can be heard in many types of music.<n><n>**An orchestra plays many instruments like violins (violins can sing), violas (violas can sing), cellos (cello can sing), bassoons, brass instruments (trumpets, French horns, tubas), percussion instruments (keyboards, drums, guitars)**, and harpsicord. A cello is a type of bass. A harpsicord is a type of piano.

It's harder to play with that many people at once, compared with an orchestra. It might be harder to play music with all 17 people at once **because the music might go out of sync** when a rock band is playing something loud. It would take a lot of **rehearsing** to make sure everyone could play this music at once in sync with each other, since there's a lot of **drums** in a rock band. <n><n>#### 32<n>Answer:<n>Orchestra<n>C: Jazz band<n>B: Orchestras can play different types of music,  but they play lots of instruments.

What is her birthday?<n><n>### Response2:<n>The 16<n><n>### Rationales2:<n>Sonja was the youngest of all of the babies born in her hospital. That means that her birthday was after all of the other youngest birthdays. In order for her to be on the 16th, she needs to be the youngest of everyone up to, but not including, the 16th.<n>We can think of her birthday as a race of babies, where everyone is a candidate for best birthday. If she is going for the 16th birthday, then she has to be younger than everyone else, which means that her race time for the 16 is:<n><code> (16 - her race time) = 16 -? = 16 - time = (16 - time) </code><n>Given that she is the youngest of all babies born today, we know that her race time is <code>0</code>. Therefore, her race time for the <code>16</code> is <code>>0=16</code>, which means:<n><code>>16=17</code><n>The question becomes which baby was named <code>>16 = 17</code>? That baby would be the one who was born on the 17th, which is Sonja. Therefore:<n><code>> 16 = 16 - (17)</code><n>Which evaluates to "<code>>0 - 17 =0</code>"<n><n><code>(16 - 17 = 0)</code><n>#### 0<n>Answer: 0<n>

(Cite: Wikipedia)"<n><n>#### Rationales: <n><n>- The definition of _legitimate_ includes the connotation of _logical_. A logical response is given here because the handbags are illegal/illegitimate by definition. _Illegal_ + _handbags_ = _illegitimate_. Therefore, they must have a _legitimacy statement_(which is illogical). If the bags are legitimate, the statement would be logically sound.<n>- It can be seen that the term _illegal_ and _logical_ are synonymous.<n>- If the handbags are legitimate or _legal_ the item could be returned. We see _returns_ mentioned and therefore, the handbags must be illegitimate _not_ legal.<n><n><n>#### <n><n>|<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.

Choices:  A: squid B: pencil C: newspaper D: fountain pen E: printer<n><n>### Response:		 <n>Answer: B (Pencil)<n><n>### Process:<n>I first went the the top and read the Question. I then used my phones notes app to take notes on the instructions. The first instruction that I read was `Input: Mary had 19 stickers. She used 3 large pencils, 7 big pencils, 6 small pencils, 5 very small pencils, and 3 big ink on the front page of hsi journal and 7 stickes each to 6 other page of her journal`. I found this instruction to be difficult because I have seen very small pencil and a large pencil, but I had never seen a very small pencil...So I wrote down the answer I had chosen for `B`. Then I wrote down the answers for the questions. I wrote down `<<5+7=>>12` because I knew that `7*3` was the right answer for the large pencils in the equation. I also wrote "I am not sure" next to the number of how many I wrote down. then I saw the rationale for the questions. The rationale for the second question stated `The second part of the answer explains that each of the smaller stickers was used the same as a large pencil each`. Since each small pencil was equal to each large pencil, I know I had written down `5+7=12` and not 19. So I deleted my answer and wrote down 12 instead. Then I read the new instructions: `Input: What do you fill with inkl to print? Choices A: squid B. pencil C: newpapar D: fountainpen E: printer`. For the question that askes what will you fill with ink...I chose `C` The answer to question number 14 says `I chose A` for my initial response...but when I read the rationale..it states `We can only use the printer 7 times, so the correct answer is `C``. So...I had a choice to make. If I wanted to stay with my answer...I would only have 12 stickers left...If I wanted a higher score I had to change my answer. I choose `C`. Then I read the instructions again to decide if it was worth it or not. I decided that it was worth

(C) find a cheap used car, (D) get a job, and (E) start walking around town. (F) None or all of the above.<n><n>### Answer<n><n>The question asks what we can do if we can't afford a new car, but this question doesn't require us to buy a car. We can always walk to school instead of driving. Also, we can borrow from friends if needed.

Choices:  A: cause death B: cause bleeding C: falling down D: become infected E: claim insurance<n><n>### Response:		Input:You can only use each of your 4 eggs once. You want to make omelettes with 6 eggs but your house didn't have enough for 6, so you had to borrow 2 eggs from your neighbor. The problem is that now you have too many eggs. How can you avoid putting 6 eggs in the pan and still have enough yolk left for 6 omelettes?<n>Rationales:"Using only 4 eggs once" is the same as "4 eggs is used once, but after using the eggs, you cannot use that same number of eggs"<n>Since you do not have enough eggs, you will not be able to make 6 omeletts. You will only have enough yolk for "N eggs in one omelet". But since "N eggs in one omellete" is the same you can only use 4 eggs once. Since you cannot use this number of eggs more than once, there are no more eggs. So you cannot make 6 omelets anymore.<n>#### NOTE: Eggs are represented by the number 6, as the question states. The question then represents 4 eggs by 4.<n><n>### Output:Input:What is the worst consequence of 4 eggs? Choices:  a: cause death b: cause injury c: cause disease d: cause pain e: claim insurance<n>Rationales:The question first states "When 4 eggs are used for 6 omelets, there is always only enough yolk left for "N eggs in 1 omellete" eggs...". Therefore:<n>The problem is that after using your 4 eggs there are no more eggs, which means there is no yolk. Therefore the worse consequence is that there are 4 less eggs which means there are no more eggs to use. (See image below)<n><n>#### Note:<n>The problem is: When eggs are used to make four omelets, there are no eggs left to make another omellete. The worst consequence of this, is there are no eggs left <n><n>### Instructions:Below is a task that describes a situation.

Choices:  A: infect B: reproduce C: mutate D: eat food E: make computer malfunction<n><n>### Response:		<n>We can see the correct answer is **B**. A person is the host of the virus, A is not an option. B does not make sense because a virus does not eat or feed, it reproduces, C is not an option. D is not an option. This is because virus is a type of malware, malware cannot eat or be food. Finally, the correct answer is B.<n><n>### Justification:  <n>A a person is the host for viruses, so the first answer is ruled out. Since a virus doesn't eat, and it cannot reproduce, then the last is ruled out as well. Choice A only gives the definition of virus, which doesn't even fit in a sentence. Choice C, reproduces is correct. Choice E, makes a computer malfunction, is not even a description of a virus, it would be if a virus made the computer, but it doesn't.<n><n>### Input<n>My mother is 48 years old.  <n>My father is 55 years old and older than my mother.<n><n>### Response<n>**My mother is 49 years old.

For the purposes of solving the problem, "the sum of two numbers is 4" implies that one number is 2, and "the lesser of two numbers is 3" implies that one number might be 1 or the other could be 3.<n>In general, when there is a non-linear relationship, trying to guess the value of any missing variables is less reasonable. For the purposes of this problem, "Knock the wind out of the soccer ball's net" would need to include knowing the position and mass of the player. There is no way to know both of these values without actually watching the game. Similarly, the missing information in the "I'm going <place> with <name> later" question is "place" and "name". The only non-linear relationship is, "I'm taking <thing> with <other thing> ", where the

The first challenge with this question is to identify what information is provided and what is missing. Because this a programming question, all we know is that there are four numbers in the sequence and that there must be some pattern between them. For instance, since the sequence is listed in ascending order for all of the numbers, if the first two numbers were switched then the numbers in the middle would be switched and we would know the pattern, but we don't know what the pattern is.  \nTherefore our first task, besides finding the pattern, is to eliminate options that don't fit the pattern. One way to do this is to try each possible pattern with small numbers and see if the answer is correct as you expected.  \n**Response 2:** This response is a correct answer. I think using the information about the pattern to find a solution is a great start, but there are some additional ways to find the answer. Specifically, since we have the information that all of the numbers in the sequence are positive integers, then we can know that the sequence goes as follows: 0, 1, 2, and 3. This gives us some constraints.  \nAnother way to find the answer is to know that if there is a sequence of 4 numbers that has a pattern, then at least one of the numbers is in the middle. If we know that there is at least one number that must be in the middle, then this gives us the constraint that there is at least 5 integers in between these numbers. These constraints can help to narrow down possible answers that you consider and are", "answer": "C: office"}

{"text": "Answer (exactly): Cyanide\n\n## SOLUTION (Answer from the teacher)\n\nWe want to create methods that take arguments, perform operations using those arguments, and return the results. Aside from math topics that we've already covered, in this chapter students will learn to write methods for operations that return boolean values such as even, odd, or prime. They will also learn to write methods that return a value or values.\n\n#### Creating a Method\n\nTo write a method, create a class named AnswerMethods, and then create 10 instance variables: `boolean evenMethod(int intVariable)` for `even`, `boolean oddMethod(int intVariable, String stringVariable)` for `odd`, `boolean primeMethod(int intVariable)`. If you have followed the instructions throughout the course, you will probably want to name your int values with caps, and your string variables with lowercase, so that we can avoid naming conflicts with methods within the same class.\n\nWe want to be able to call our methods in order to tell the variable whether it is even, odd, or a prime number, just like in some the other exercises we've already done. So the methods should return something, as well as be declared as methods.\n\n#### Naming Class Variables\n\nIn programming languages, you cannot have a variable named with the word `int` or `string` because both of these are keywords. So you'll see that we have replaced the keyword `int` in our class variable name with an arbitrary variable name like `integer`, or you can rename `string` in our class variable to `variable` or something you can think of to create something unique for your case. This is how you name all of your class variables.\n\n```\npublic class AnswerMethods {\n\tboolean evenMethod(int integerVariable){\n\t\t//enter your code here\n\t}\n\tboolean oddMethod(int integerVariable, String stringVariable){\n\t\tboolean isEven = true;\n\t\tboolean isOdd = false;\n\t\t}\n}\n```\n\n#### Declaration Methods\n\nNaming your variables does not make them methods. Methods have a name; so you must set up the variables so that when they are called, they act the way you set them up in the declaration. Below are the steps to declare methods:\n\n```\npublic int variable;\n}\n```", "answer": "A: suicide"}

How many candies are in Coorey\u2019s package (if that were possible).

Then to find Coorey\u2019 s package you can just subtract the total candie, 40, from the sum of all the candies to have a final 8 candys.\n\n### Other Outputs:\n\n1) 29\n2) 10\n3) 5\n4) 600\n5) 97\n6) 3000 \n7) 38\n8) 33\n9) 50\n10) 2\n\n### Commentary:\nCommentary: The question seems clear enough until you find out the definition to some of the words.

So Tapanga has 9 more candies than Core\n2) The Local call costs more 5 cents and international call cost 5 cents more, the time it takes to call is 45 minutes for Local call, and for International call it is 31 minutes.

{"text": "The correct answer is option E.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe correct option for this question is E, in which the salesman screams.\n\nThis is a trick question. The word suddenly implies that the salesman would have appeared immediately. However, the options include options where the salesman appears after a short duration. The first letter of the answer options are the same, thus making it difficult for the user to identify the correct answer.\n\nThe only option that excludes any immediate appearance is B in which the salesman will bottom out (meaning, his car will have a hard time starting).\n\nAn easier question would have been if the user had to guess what the salesman did, and the only options were scream, roll over, and bottom out. In that case, the user would easily be able to guess that the salesman is doing option E. However, the question is worded in such a way that the user may have guessed the scream in option A, given how immediately the other option in A does not start. In any case, it is best to leave this question, as the user may not have guessed the answer otherwise.\n\n### A few more questions\n\n### Instructions:Answer the questions below.\n\n### Question 1:\nIn a basketball tournament, a team has won half of their matches.

So, it doesn\u2019t really matter how many are in each box. It\u2019s like an infinite supply of the same item. So you take some amount of a certain item and then have 3/4 of that original amount plus some.

Red was removed from green and green still remained a color. but blue was removed from blue. so if it were green removed from the group, then they would just be one item left, so they would be considered for sure to be in the group.

How much heavier is my wallet than his phone after my wallet has absorbed water from him?\n\n### Response \n2.5x\n\n### Description\n\nThere are several ways to think about this problem. One way to think about how much heavier water is than air is by the [Golden Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio) and [phi](https://en.wikipeidia.org/wiki/Phi_(number)), also known as 1.6180339887. However, this problem is less about those values and more about comparing weights of similar quantities, and therefore it might be more effective to think about the answer in terms of the weight of 1 photo vs 100 photos.\n\n**Comparison of 1 photo and 100 photos**\n\nEach photo weighs the equivalent of 24 regular sized photos. My wallet holds 50 photo pages. Therefore, each photo page in my wallet weighs 1.7 oz. Since I have 50 photo pages in my wallet, my wallet is 10\u00d750=500 oz equal to the weight of 24\u00d750=1,200 regular photos.\n\nHis phone", "answer": "A: coffee"}

Functions can return an object.\n\n## How do object oriented variables work?\nA variable can be a value (the basic value assigned to the variable) or a reference (a pointer to the memory of the variable which stores the value). A variable can store a value or an address (reference) to a value within the same scope.\n\n## What do you need to define a function?\nYou don't need to define a function, if it is not defined as a method of another class you can define it as a free function (in the file system rather than inside another class). \n\n## How do I make a function callable as a method?\nThe easiest way is to define a method with the same name and the same arguments as the free function you initially defined.\n\n## What kinds", "answer": "D: frequent"}

Choices: I:53 II:320 III:410 IV:133 V:53 II\n### Response: II\n\n### Input:- John says, \"I would like to spend the least money, and I don't mind paying extra for the best quality.\" John and his friend, who are going on a trip, will need to buy clothes. How can you explain John's statement using mathematical reasoning? Explain, including the following: Choices: I:John's statement I've been trying to figure out how to explain what he is saying. If I spend $24 to get clothes, for example, and $24 is greater than 1 or 1/3 of $24, then all I'm spending are clothes. II. I think that it is reasonable to explain this using proportions. John wants to spend the least amount of money possible on clothes. If the cost of the clothes is greater than 1/3 of any amount of money given, John will not be able to spend $18, or 1/3 or $36, or 1/2 or $54, or 1/5 or 50, or anything within that amount of money. When John is on a trip, he will spend money on food, gas, souvenirs, or to pay for rent and transportation to the airports. When it comes to spending $20 on food, gas, and souvenirs, I'll spend $2.16 on food, $3.51 on gas, and $1.12 on sou", "answer": "A: loss of heat"}

A control, which had no change from adding the ingredient, was added to the study and compared with a test, which added the same amount of the ingredient as the regular sample. The scientists noticed a discrepancy in the way the chemical reacted to the ingredient. The control test and experiment both failed to give the same reaction, and their discrepancies were so different that the regular sample could not determine one from the other. The scientists thought that something may have changed in the chemical, so they repeated the step to compare how the chemical changed, but they found that their results remained exactly the same. In fact, they began to question if the ingredient had any effect on the sample at all. A few months later, they repeated the study but added extra drops of the ingredient and found an identical reaction as they expected and as before.

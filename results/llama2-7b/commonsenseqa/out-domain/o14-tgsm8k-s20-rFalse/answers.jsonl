You receive an order of $47.05 in chicken wire.\n\n\nDifferent types of prisons are cheaper than the others, so it's important to know the costs. Each type has a 0.675 times cost bonus if you decide to build an electric prison, which is the most expensive one. Electric prisons have an 0.46 times cost bonus if you build solar instead, which is the second most expensive but cheaper than electric.\n\nYour order of chicken wire is $47.00, so you decide to buy chicken wire and build solar electric prisons and charge $808.90 for each square meter. How much money could you make with your prison?\n\n\nIn order to get the answer:\nWe calculate the size of a prison using:\np = w * h * w = s * h * s where p = price of a prison in sqm, s = size of a prison, w = width, h = height\n\nIf we assume:\nprice per sq. m = 808.9, price per cm = 8.08, price per cm2 = 8.0\n\nsize of a 10 sqm prison (w,h) = (10 x 10) = 100\n\nsize of one sqcm prison (w,h)= (1 x 1 cm) = 1\n\nSo a 1 sq. m prison is in 100-1 = 99 sqcm\nand a 1 sq. cm prison is", "answer": "B: finger"}

It was 22996408512055050693320. If the three places of hundreds digit are erased. The ones digit remains as the previous digit. It remains as the previous digit (as digit). The tens place two digit number is added to the four places of tens place two digit number as digit. The three places of hundreds place two digit number remain as they are as digit. There remains in this manner until no ten thousand digit number is added. If the tens digit is added and a place is removed when necessary, the number is the same as we began with.

We have the variables in which we have to put the given number. We know that everytime A is to be multiplied by B it gives us a number. So, using that information in the given equation A B A + B = X. Using inverse properties of multiplication, we get ( A X ) / ( B X ). Multiplying both the sides by B to get rid of the A's, we get the rest of the variables in an equation.  Once the variables are found out, we multiply them using their values and get the rest of the equation.\nOutput: 148\n\nInput: We have the variable which is assigned to a 9 to multiply all those who have an A in them. Doing that gives us 1. So putting all those in the equation we get  (1 X)  A + B = X  1 A + (2 X ) = (3 + B).  That is  the end of variables.  Now we can just perform simple addition on them to arrive at the X.\nOutput: 66\n\nInput: A has 56% of the total number of students in the class.  B has 45% of the total number remaining.

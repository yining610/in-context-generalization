The answer is a home, because according to the question, if you like temperatures cool you would choose a different choice. A person does not need more than one electric fan in a hardware store because it would not be practical to have more than one fan in a hardware store, since a person could buy it to leave at home. A person does not even need more than one fan in their office because it is almost impossible to have more than one electric fans in your office. Electric companies will not allow you to have more than one in one building. You could get in trouble for having two electric fans in one building. Another reason you would not want more than one electric fans is that it can cause fire to have two electric fans running from one socket. It can get too close to heat if there are more than one electric fan. Another reason you wouldn't want more than one electric fan is that it may get too hot for people to be comfortable.

Explanation: Since both boys are facing each other, when the shorter boy tries to cast a look, the look has traveled the required length in one direction and then bounced back. This distance, however, is not a straight line travel but one incurved. So both boys will be closer to each other if their eyes are to face each other after. Then the look has to be traveled twice. Hence, the required distance covered by the shorter boy\u2019s look is 4 meters. The shorter boy can see the longer boy from 4 + 2 = 6 meters away.

{"idx": 173, "text": "Choice:\nA B C D E\nAns: E\nCross to mark\n\n## Answer Key:\n\nIn the first two questions, 5/7 and 17/2, the difference between the fraction and the 1 is 3/5 as can be seen here:\n\n5/7 - 1/7  = 4\n17/2 - 2/2 = 15\n\nSince the ramp must be 1cm, or 1/10 of a meter (or millimeter), this means that we can create the following:\n\n(2/2) * (0.01) + (4/5) * (0.1)\n\nWhere the top row are the coordinates of the wall to be scaled with and the 2/2 stands for the x-coordinate and the 4/5 stands for the y-coordinate. Substituting the numbers for the values of x and y, we get a result of 45, which is the equation for the ramp with the two walls being one meter (100 cm) away from each other.\n\nIn the second two questions, 2/5 and 3/10, the difference between the two is 5/5 as can be seem here:\n\n2/5 - 1/5  = 1\n3/10 - 1/10 = 2\n\nSince the ruler must be 1cm for this problem as well, we will have to add the difference. For this, we will take the top row as the numbers we will need. The left two rows will be (4/7) * (4/25) and (5/25) * (4/7) since we are taking a 4/7 ruler for the left and a 5/25 one for the right. Substituting these numbers with the given values for width (100 cm), we get (4/7) and (5/100), respectively. Combining these, we get (1cm) + (5/10) = 0, which we should not have, the actual equation should be 0 + 1 cm = 5 cm (1 cm + 1 cm =?).\n\nIn the first three questions, the difference between the number should be 1/3.", "answer": "B: graph"}

The company buys each product the same price and incurs a holding cost of $3$ per unit of inventory, whether stocked in the warehouse or in the stores with customers. The company sells the products on cash basis and has the following monthly variable costs.\n\nSeveral management options have been discussed which will result in the company choosing one of the strategies\n\nOption A - Decrease the number of stores. As a result of this option, the cost per unit and holding costs will increase. The company will need to increase the sales prices of all of its products by nearly $1 in order to make the same level profit as with Option B.\n\nOption B - Increase the sales prices of all the products by $1 to make up for the inventory holding increase. This will also increase sales volume by $7600. The selling price of each product is $1 more than the cost to buy and store the product at the same time.\n\nOption C - Increase the number of stores by 50% and the number of products sold. The sales increase the monthly volume $8000. The cost of inventory and the cost of sales are both unaffected; therefore, the profit margin and holding cost per unit do not change.\n\nConsider the following data\n\nOption A will result in the following:\n\nInventory cost $6840 (200 units at $3.40 each)\nBuying Costs $16,000 ($16.37 per unit)\nSales $32,000 ($36.67 per unit)\nProfit at this rate $9160.\n\nOption B will result in the following\n\nInventory cost = $6400 (1600 units at $4 each)\nBuying costs $16,240 ($16.42 per unit).\nSales = $32,600 ($37.62 per unit.)\nProfit at this point $9160\nOption C will result in the following.\n\nInventory cost: $8100 (", "answer": "A: cause death"}

As air moves in, the air pressure inside me will decrease by a tiny amount (1 kPa). This pressure difference will cause air inside the lungs to escape through lung tissue and alveoli which open up to allow outflow.\nBreathing is a balancing act: If I keep breathing too much the lungs might start collapsing. But, if I don't breathe deeply enough I'll suffocate. In humans, breathing results in the lungs taking in about 5 L (~1.3 gal) of air per minute.\n\nBreathing involves lots of other bodily activity. The brain monitors all sorts of changes in my body and breathing, including the pressure changes. If my blood oxygen level is low my brain will kick-start my breathing by making me breathe faster. But if my blood has enough oxygen I'll tend to stop. In response to oxygen deprivation, my blood vessels are likely to constrict, decreasing blood flow which results in dilation of my bronchioles.\n\nBreath-holding is an attempt to hold the expansion of the lungs in check. This is a relatively common condition for divers. Some can hold the breath, while others will exhale while remaining underwater. In this case the rate of exhalation out of the lungs (measured in liters/second) doesn't correlate very well with the rate of lung air pressure drop, suggesting that there may be other mechanisms at work. For example, a diver may be able to exhale so that their lungs are nearly filled before stopping, and then the air continues going out on its own, in a slow, almost continuous rate.\n\nIn humans, our heart rate during exercise can vary from 70 to 200 times per minute.

We have to find the value of x so put it 35 and solve i+x=35.\n2nd way : here the value of x is not defined and we have two terms in bracket. So take first term in bracket to another expression by adding the second term in bracket, this operation we call the distributive property. Let\u2019s assume the new expression as a+b. Now take the first term in bracket, i+j to new expression and we get another expression that is a+j. So for solving i+j+a =35  we can take the new expression in bracket with the second term and make it as i+35 so the new expression is i+35+b. Now the value of expression in bracket will be the same of the original which is 35, so solve this expression for x and i+35+x =35. But we already got x=35 in the first way.

So you know that the sum of each run of three is: +1 + 1 + 1 = 3 +1 + \u20131 + \u20131 + +1 + \u20131 = 4.

( 65532 + 5 ) ^.5 is required here. It can be found by applying the above principle.The 65533 times 2^.5 will make it to 124532.But then to have the exponent of 5, 12 will be multiplied with itself thrice making it to 36.But this will give the value of 124562.But it must end with an exponent 5 so, the two values of 5 at the top must be multiplied to make it to 54. But the value of three 5s must be multiplied. This will result in a negative value as the number does not have a negative exponent.\nSo let us apply this 65534 times 2^ 5 , to the power 62 will give negative value, so 63 will multiply by 3 to make it plusive. this will result in the value, 19125. this is the answer \nSo the final result is a.\n\nInput:find value of x such that 2.6x4x6x^2x^3=x-4x-4x+2\nOutput:Let me solve this expression by subtracting two terms, then by multiplying two terms to eliminate one, then by canceling terms, then subtracting to eliminate one term then by squaring to eliminate the other. 2.6x^2x^-101\nSo the final answer\n\nInput:which is larger 32 feet or 661 inches\nOutput:So the final answer is 482.087 inches.\n\nInput:which will win in this election 8:3?\nOutput:The answer is 8 \nSo the final output is 8:3", "answer": "D: somber"}

What is the probability of drawing a black ball when a ball is withdrawn at random from the box?\n\nOutput: \"It might be helpful to picture this problem as follows. With three balls there are six equally likely arrangements. For example, there is a 1/6 chance of drawing a red ball, a 2/6 chance of drawing one of two black balls, and an 1/6 chance\nof drawing the yellow ball.\nIf the black ball is one of two black balls and the yellow ball is the yellow ball, the probability of selecting the black ball is 3/6 = \u00bd. This is the same\nprobability as drawing a black ball when there are 13 black balls and 10 red balls.\nProbability for 10 red balls and 13 black balls\nThere are 10 red balls out of a total of T = 23 balls.\nThere are T/10 of these in one subset out of T subsets.\nProbability = 10/T = 10C8 / 23C20\nWe can solve our recurrance equation: P = 10Cn / (23Cn+1) which has n=8, 10C8/11C34. After substitutions\nP = (50%)(50%){13choose8} / 8choose34\n50% * 50% * (13/16)(13!/8!) = 50% * 0.08571 = 0.042855", "answer": "E: library"}

{"idx": 852, "text": "Answer:The answer you sought is D. Trading floors are found in exchanges. For example, the New York Stock Exchange is where a trader's stock transactions are done. The exchanges may also be called, simply, the exchange. Exchanges have trading floors where traders physically go to buy and sell stocks, options, and other investments.\n\nI found that : https://www.dummies.com/article/50884/how-to-access-stock-exchange-trading-floor-from-home.html\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/news/5-questions-about-stock-exchanges-answers/  \nThere are two stock exchanges: the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ Stock Market. The NYSE is an auction\nsystem used by market-makers. A market-maker is an exchange member that acts as a dealer. The NASDAQ, on the other hand,\nis an electronic exchange, and uses quoting systems that provide liquidity for securities.\n\nAn auction system is different than an electronic exchange. In an electronic exchange, a buyer and seller both log on\nand use an electronic system to communicate. The dealer (or market-maker) uses the communication link to arbitrage\nbetween bid and ask prices and can adjust the price at any time to maximize his profit. In an auction, traders have no\ninformation on what another buyer or seller is willing to pay, and must make a bid or offer based on the information the\nmarket-maker provides at that exact time. There are a couple of reasons the NYSE uses an auction system.\n\nFirst, the NYSE is set up in a fashion to protect large investors by only allowing these users to access the exchange.\nIn order to be a member of the exchange, investors must pass the NYSE securities membership exam of passing\nstress tests and financial qualifications. This keeps out unqualified investors as well as those with a bad reputation or\na history of failing the test. Because they are more stringent to get onto the exchange, the NYSE members are also\nmore qualified and capable of handling large-dollar trades. Auction-based systems allow investors to buy and sell in\nvolume on a large scale,", "answer": "D: exchange"}

The idea behind a genetic algorithm is the simplest one in the history of evolution / natural selection ( we don't mean the species selection, we mean the method to select genes with the most beneficial traits ). In nature, all genes must live together and share the best genes by producing new generatin. The idea is to introduce random mutation and then pick the best offspring off of that mix by natural selection. in this program, we use mutation and natural selection to find the perfect answer from each question. This program asks you questions and then tries to find the best answer the same way evolution does. So what does the genetic algorithm do? it looks like like so : it takes a set of genes, it applies mutation to it, it finds the best offspring based on the mutation. the only thing that keeps the genes from becoming too extreme is the crossover algorithm. Crossover means a gene can only take certain parts of certain genes and mix those parts. so, at this point, we have the genes, their crossover rates and then their mutation rates. now we just have to implement them. we will use crossover as follows : say we have 2 x and 4 y - then one would be x = 3452 and y = 182 while the other would be x = 728 y = 5 or x = 182 and y = 7. now, we only apply mutation to : mutate ( x ) mutate ( y ). now we try 9 times to apply natural selection to these genes, that means we will have", "answer": "C: bible"}

So the triangle is actually three equal isosceles triangles.\nOutput:\"Explanation:\nStep 1.\nDivide each isosceles triangle in two equal parts in the middle.\n\nStep 2.\nPick one from each isosceles triangler and draw lines from their midpoint to each other.\n\nStep 3.\nEach of the lines will intersect at right angles.\n\nAnswer 1.\nIsosceles triangle is actually three equal triangles. You need to prove in the drawing that the three of them are equal, otherwise it might be that one or two of them might not be equal. So you need to prove that their angles are 90\u00b0. To prove that, the lines from the equal angles need to be drawn, after drawing that, the line formed by their intersection will automatically make those angles 90\u00b0, because they were already all equal.\" So the final answer for part h is true\n\nInput:\"Triangle ABC can be obtained by rotating 180 degrees around side AC of the isosceles triangle BCD.

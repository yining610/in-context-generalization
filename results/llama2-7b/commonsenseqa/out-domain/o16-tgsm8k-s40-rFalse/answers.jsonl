If the bat traveled at 9 miles per hour, how close together were the two objects at the instant the bat flew past the light bulb the second time?\n\n\n### Solution\n![alt](images/09.png)\nThe instant the bat passes the light bulb was exactly at t=0. This means that both the bat and the light bulb moved away from each other.\n\nTo find t_1 when the bat passes the lightbulb a second time, we want to find the instant at which the distance to lightbulb is at its lowest value.\n\nThis means that t_1 is where the equation 9*t = 2/(t_1 + (2/(t_1+ (2/(t_2))))\nsolves for t_(1):\n9*t_1^2 - 4/(t_1 + 2/(t_2)) - (2/(t_3)) + 1 = 0\nAfter simplifying this", "answer": "C: candle"}

Also I used the \"while\" loop to cycle through a particular block of code.\n\n### Question No. 4\n\nTo sum up all of our classes, we created a 5 by 5 matrix (5 inputs + 5 outputs). Since the number of inputs and outputs were the same, we used to variables \"nums\" and \"sum\". After we determined the number of elements in the matrix, using the input variable, we called each method to create the corresponding output.\n\n### The answer to question 5 can be found in [here](./DayFive.MD)\n\n### Question Six\n\nI used a \"for\" loop (for i in range(5)) to iterate through each input and generate the appropriate output based on the input. As for my code, the \"for\" loop went through each element and set a counter to a value of x. The \"counter\" would check the input and assign new values based on the new input. For example: Input \"3\" would become x = 1 and y = 2. Then each element would have x multiplied by 6, y would be 5 and z would be 1. The result would be 1+1 = 2.\n\n### Q&A 7\n\nThe variable \"hours\" is used to calculate a result. There is a method called addTime that adds hours from the variable \"hours\".\n\n### Question Nine\n\nThe code contains 4 methods (counting the methods for the outer and the inner for loops.)  I used the method called count to determine the total number of words.  For the outer for loop, I used if else conditional to assign a counter (in this case, y) to its initial value.

If we let x be the number of the Doberman pupps, then the formula is that 3x - 5 = 90, so that solve x=25. There is 55 more Schnauzers.\n\n2. if we let x= the number of the month, in the same way, the formula is: 53n + 67 -46, so, the only way for that to be equal to 0 is that to let x=10 and y=zero.\n\n3.If we let x= number of the Dobermans and let y= number of seashells. Then, we can deduce that x/ 12 = y.  Since x is 30, then y=12.2x=36.\n\n4.If we let x = (number of seashells in the first day - # of sea shells in the first day)/ 4. So, if x= double what Jordan catches, then we get: 2x=4x+4, and then, we get 2x=8x. So.  x= 4/ 8= 1/2.\n\n5. In the same way, we can solve number of brass players by using the above formula.

So for all time you know the car is travelling it is moving 50mph and the train is moving at 60mph  the train is a distance of 20 miles ahead.  you can say 60(miles) = (50(mph)) x (time) and the distance travelled by the train is the same as the distance travelled by car.

For this solution to work, the length of the input would need to be greater than 8 so we can account for the 8 possible choices we need to return.  Also, since it is in the form of a binary search we are only taking the range `1-10` to allow for the two option of no or any number\n\n```python\n\"\"\"Program Name:BruteForce\nDescription:Used recursion to take each input and produce the correct output (if correct).\nAuthor:Shane Cranmer\nDate:August 16th 2020\n\"\"\"\n\nanswers=int(input(\"Answer Input:\"))\nchoices=int(input(\"Choices Input:\"))\n\ndef bruteForce(choices,answers", "answer": "B: suburban home"}

I first used division to solve the equations and came to the number of Schnauer puppies by subtracting the number of Dobermen from 90 which results in the remainder of 65 and then dividing the answer is 65 by 5, which leaves 13, thus there are 13 Schnauzers.\n\nIn solving the second question I used addition and multiplication and started by subtract 330 from 390 and divided the results by 5 which leaves 27. Then I add the remainder which is 5 to be the number of Dobermans puppies which is 32 after the total number of toothbrushes is taken.\n\nIn the third question, I first subtracted the number of toothbrushe in January which is 67 from 330 and divided the result by 4 which leaves 69. I continued to repeat this process until the last month where half is subtracted and then divided the total for the remainder.\n\nIn the forth problem, I followed the same process with addition and multiple to find the final number of seashells.\n\nIn the fifth question, I multiplied the total amount of seashells with the price of each shell to get the number of dollars.\n\nIn the sixth question, I multiplied each group by 0.25, which results in the final total amount of seashell.\n\nThe remainder of the problems were the same with only change of values for the given equation, and then repeating the same process", "answer": "D: field"}

Furthermore, on the first floor, the numbers of rooms with a 1, 2 or 3 dividing into the number in the room below are 1 less than the number on the ground floor that has the same number.  For instance, if there are 3 rooms on the ground floor that are divisible by 1 (1,2,3), there will be 2 rooms on the first floor with the same divisors (2, 4).\nIf we go the second floor, the divisor of each of the first floor rooms goes up by the number of rooms in the floor above minus the floor above's \"divisor count\". For example, there is 4 room on the second floor, and we divide 8 (number of first floor rooms with divisors 2, 3, and 4) by 4, and get that each room on the second floor is numbered by a 2, 3 or 4 divisor.\nThe third and fourth floor are done the same way.

In this case, it is 10. The remainder after substraction has to be a multiple of 10, and because the substraction is done with doberman puppys, we choose the factor that is the highest, because each doberman puppy counts as 1.

Last A.  Third C.  Middle D.  Thirteen F.  Last House\nOutput:0\n\n### Solution:\nThe program starts by setting the variable housecount to 0. At the beginning of the program, an empty list is created. Then, each line is processed and the following method `addToHouses` is called on every line. It receives the line and a list of houses. It modifies the input line `line` to add \"house\", or it returns the input to indicate invalid options. With this method and following instructions, the program is able to create a list of possible solutions. On the second loop within the `for` loop the last option is determined, and that option is returned as the solution to the problem. In python you do not need to use the `return` statement in a `function`, it is implied by the `}` end of the function.\n```\ndef addToHouses(line, houses):#adding a number in front of each line that's called with an option\n    if line.startswith(\"house\"):\n        houses.append(\"house\")\n        return line\n\n### Code: Houses\nhouseCount = 0 \n#this line adds to the list houses with the option \"house\"\nif line.startswith('house'):\n    houses.append(\"house\", line)\n    print(line)\n    print(houses)\n    if len(houses)%2!= 0:\n        houseCount+=1\n    else:\n        houseCount=0\n\n\n#creating a second loop to print every other option\nif len(houses) % 2 == 0:\n    for x in range(len(houses)):\n        if x%2 == 0:# even index = print all the options\n            line = str(houses[x])\n            print(line)#except for the line that has \"house\" added(when the variable \"houseCount\" is equal to 1)\nprint(houseCount)\n```\n\n### Run", "answer": "E: cellar"}

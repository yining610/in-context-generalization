Then when she sees patient B, she marks patient A as done, that means she finished her first patient which she can see in 20 minutes time. Then she sees patient B.  Finally she sees patient C and marks patient B as done.  Now she can see patient patient C in 20 minutes. Because she only can see 4 people in a day, it means she cannot see patient D.\nThen she goes back to see patient A because she cannot help seeing patient A again. Then she has to see patient B again.  Now she has only seen 3 patients which is 3 * 20 minutes time = 60 minutes time. So since she sees patient A and patient B again, this means she cannot see patient C or patient D.\n\n![2015-01-13](https://github. com/yuliswan /Coding_ Interview_ Preparation/ /blob/master/ images/problem12.jpg \"Instruction\")\n\nIn this case she also has to see patient B and A because she can only see 4 people in 20 minute time.

The challenge is to define the steps. This may be different than coding language, but you should find an implementation that is useful and useful to you.\n\nOnce you define the steps, you must be able to express the steps as a function. For example, the solution to the problem might read:\n\nInput: The code is a series of expressions that can be evaluated in order at any time and at any time in a program. The program should use the first expression to get a value and use the value to compute subsequent expressions until the last expression is reached.  It then needs to use the value obtained at the end of the last expression. When we consider expressions as being evaluated in such a way, we say that we are looking for the evaluation of arithmetic expression.\n\nIn order to define the steps, you will need a list of data. For example, in this problem you may have the data that contains a value 1. This can be considered an evaluation of 1 because you know that 1 is the value of the first evaluation.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nThe problem statement is: Write a function that allows you to define the steps as described above, such that the function will return the value of your data when evaluated.\n\nThe function will use the data that is stored in the object xt. If you get an answer of 1, and the value of x is 4, then return 1 in that state. If, however, the answer is 2, you must put 1 in that position first.

{"text": "The correct answer is: B. England will not always have Queen as it will be ruled differently later on\n\n\n\n### Input\nAnita needs to paint her bedroom, living room and bathroom. She does not have an equal number of rollers, so she will have to re-paint each room after she uses her roller to cover it. Her paint is labeled \"3 gallons equals 30 5 gallon buckets\" (1 gallon bucket has 10 gallons of paint, but she only paints 3 gallons in each room)\n\n- How many rollers will she need for all of the rooms?\n- The living room is 20 feet wide by 12 feet long and has crown molding and baseboards along all four edges. The bedroom is 13 feet wide by 16 feet long and has crown and baseboards too. The bathroom is 8 feet wide by 6 feet high and doesn't have any crown molding or baseboards. How many gallons of paint will each room take for these dimensions?\n\n### Response\n\nThe answer is:\n\n- 3 rollers. One for each room.\n- The living room dimensions are 20 x 12. I rounded it down to 20x11.5 and it equals 220 sq ft. The crown molding and the baseboards take up about 3 inches each (not 4 because they don't go along the whole wall) that equals 6 sq ft. The living room will need 214 sq ft/gal. of paint. (220(214) = 49,320)\n- The bedroom dimensions are 13 x 16. I rounded it down it to 12.75x15.75 and it equals 195 sq ft (not 200) because there is only 17 sq ft more than in the living room it equals 175 sq ft/gal.\n- The bathroom is 15x8 and has no molding or baseboard so it only needs 120 sq ft/gal of paint.\n\n### Input \nA group of people is splitting a box of donuts that they want to share equally.

{"text": "A county highway is a line that connects towns and cities and communities. Driving across or through a county can take you to a place just a few miles outside of town. The best option is going the distance because you will be able to see the highway up close, especially if you are traveling in a small car or a caravan on a rainy day, or even if it is very crowded. The other option is driving down the road so you can see which way to go when the wind is blowing in your direction. It is also good to have a road map when going cross-country because you want to be able to go in any direction. You don't want the roads to be too crowded so you do not know where you are going. Going down the highway doesn't always do the trick because you might get into an accident and you might end up being stuck in traffic. One way to make things easier is to have a map so that way you have something to follow when you are driving. You can also have a book on hand to refer to since it will tell you how to get to your destination safely. Another thing to consider when choosing a county is how far it is from your next destination. The farther you drive, the better your chances are of getting to where you need to be. When you have a car, it is easier to see the distance between where you are and where you want to go. Having a map or a book with directions can help you know which way to go when you are going cross-country.\n\n### Input;There are 5 ways you can tell if it's Christmas Eve.

How many free throw attempts does he need to take for you to be confident that he will be successful at the task?\n\n### Response 1:\nShooter took 6. You can be 95% certain that he will make 4 in a row with 6 or fewer attempts.\n\n### Response2:\nShooter will have to take 6 free throws because of the 0.95 confidence interval at 95 percent confidence. For an alpha of 0.05, the chance of failure for the 4 in a row is  0.95^(4*4) = 0.95^16 or a probability of 0.3725\n\n### Response3:\nIf given that Shooter took 6 free throws, there\u2019s a 95% chance that he\u2019ll make 4 shots. \n\nTo determine the minimum (or maximum) number of attempts to make this certain, we want the total number of trials to be equal to the total number of failures.\n\nFor n shots, probability of succeeding is 1-(1/4)^n = (4^n-1)/4^n\nSubtract from this the probability if you fail.\n\nn = (4^6-1)/4^6 = 12\n\nTherefore, if Shooter makes the minimum 12 attempts, he will make 4 out of 12 shots, at a minimum. Alternatively, he could fail on the first shot and be left with 12 attempts to make the 4 out of 4.\n\n### Input 1:\nA farmer had seven pigs.

But I have $300 in the bank, $50 in the bank. So $50 in the savings account. I can pay for it with $150 dollars.\n\nThis problem can be modeled as following.\n\nThe number of months that I'll need to pay off the car is equal to the total payment I receive.\n\nIn the above diagram, \ud835\udc5b is equal to the number of payments that I make during the month. So \ud835\udc5b of 150 is equal to the $200,000 worth of payments.\n\nSo there's the total number of payments that equal the sum.\n\nAnd the total amount that I can pay is always greater than or equal to the price of the used car. So \ud835\uded8 is going to be bigger than or equal to 20,000.\n\nSo this can be simplified it as follows. \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udf57\ud835\uded8\ud835\uded7 times equal to, this is going to be the 20000 worth of 150.\n\nThis means that I can find the total number of pay times equals 20,0,0000 divided by 150.

This river is very dangerous and one-third of the boats have sunk by accident. After you and your friend decided to cross the river, you see a woman in tears that was trying to cross the river. Without knowing that the woman is trying to prevent you and your friend from going to the other side, you tell her that you can cross the river safely. She is about to cross with you, but she sees your friend carrying a large sword. The sword is very heavy because it is made of pure diamond. If it gets wet and gets rusty, it can't be used anymore. If a boat carries the sword and the boat turns into a sieve, then everybody including the king can drown. The king has been on the other side of the river for the last few months and his men had no news from him. If the king dies, the throne will be on the other side of this river. The country on the other side of it has also been at war with this country for the past 7 months. You and your friend finally arrive safely across the river. Then this woman turns out to be your worst enemy and plans to kill you and your friend. The boat that takes her back is the sword. Once the boat is in the middle of the river, the boat starts to sink by an inch. If the river is a perfect square, then the boat will sink one inch deeper.

Only three out of 6 are negative which is 50%.\n\n### What is 2/3 of 3733\n### Response\nAs we have: 2/3, which can be rewritten as 2x3/3. The first thing to do is determine the multiplier for x in this context. This gives you 6, then multiply the multiplier in front of the fraction by that number: 6x3/3. Since the multiplier is the second group of numbers you have to figure out, simply multiply the first fraction with the second: 6x. Then all that's left is to divide: 6x/3. So far your answer is 6. Then to find the real answer for the problem, take the next one sixth of the number to get 6x/6, making it 6x-1.

Choices:  A: throw things B: play sports C: play games D: play ball E: play chess<n>Output:		D<n><n>## Instruction for the questions<n>### Part 1<n>Let's begin by looking at the second input, as an example. First divide the input by 100. You would then want to look at the remainder, if it is less than 5, multiply it by 7 (to get the equivalent of 49-5). Then add 7 to that, which will give you the answer: 44. This is how you would normally approach the problems (as you could see, looking at the first input, 3 would then be added to the remainder for the answer of 4). This approach is very direct and simple to understand.<n><n>The first input is simply a matter of adding numbers until you get a remainder of 7. For example, if you start at 89 and try to add 1, you subtract 1 from 89, which leaves you with 88. You then subtract 2 from 88, and then you subtract 3 etc. until you get a remainder, then you continue to add to get a total of 95, which is a remainder of 7, which is the answer.<n><n>The first part is fairly self-explanative (and the second, somewhat, as that could be looked at as a form of subtraction), but the third is trickier. You need to think about the number in relation to its powers of 2 and powers of 10. For the number of legs, that would be 2 raised to the number of kangaroos raised to the number of goats, which would be 2 raised and 3 raised. Then you would multiply by the number of goats (which would be 3 in this case). You can do this with division (2 divided by 3, then 2 divided by 3 again), which would look something like this for the number of legs: 1 / 2 x 3 = 2.6 x 3 = 6.8 (and you were looking for 322). A way to think about powers of 10 as the powers of 2 is this: 10^3 = 1000 = 2^3, 10^6 = 100,000 = 10^3 * 10^3, and so on. You would use division in a similar manner for all the

They each want to take the same number of pictures with each other, their parents, and their grandparents.  While they each need to take only one picture of their grandparent holding both the child and the child's parent, only one of the children will want to also remember their other family members by their own side also holding  other family members.  Each child has four  different colored shirts so they will know which child they are.  They will use an extra camera and can only take the picture with that child once.  Each child's family is wearing the same color shirts, but no family member will be holding another family member of the same color.  The children do not know any of this, but they will each count how many pictures they end up taking to try to guess one another's picture.  The pictures below the game are one set of pictures from two separate children.  How will the children use their other two pictures to figure out who is who, other than the pictures of their own family?<n>Output:  One of the children will count how many photos they take holding themselves. Then they will count how many photos each family member is in. If their grandparents are in two pics together, each holding another family member, they know they are that child.  The other child will count how many photos one family member is in, then subtract 2 and that is how many are taken with themselves. If one of their parents is in two pics with other family members, they know this is not the child taking the pictures.  If one of their parents has 2 pics holding themselves, the other child will know this is the kid taking the pictures.  <n><n>Input: I know this one is very tricky.

How long until the second watch has been used 5000 seconds?<n>Output: 520000

In the second line, space separated lines will be given. n lines will be the cost of a single pencil and a single paper respectively. Now there will be a query after each line of the question i.e. after each 2 lines (for n lines of pencil and one line of paper). In each query there will be a total cost given and number of pencil and paper required and then a single line with the answer. There will always be a positive integer in a single line.<n><n>Input: 4<n><n>pencil 1 1 1 2<n>paper 2 1 2<n><n>In the first statement, pencil 1 can be purchased by the money given in the first line i.e. 4.

Now we know that 3 pencils and 1 paper is required. As 4 can purchase 1 pencils and 2 can purchase 2 pencils, we know that 4 – 2 = 2 –. So we can purchase 2 pancels and 3 books by spending 4 and this is in line with the answer as 4 can purchase 2 pansels and 3 books. SO we are correct here as well.<n><n>In the third line, we still have 4 in our hand. Paper 5 requires 4 pencils and so does paper 10, paper 13 and paper 16. In total 4 needs 16 pencils and 4. The rest 4 is only needed to pay for a set of pencils, but let’s say we will buy our set off and we have 3 left or. So our total cost is now 7 and this agrees with the answer as 7 can purchase 4 pencils,

One was asking how much money Zach had in the first place and the other was asking for the amount of money he needed.<n><n>1. Zach had $80.<n>2. Zach needed $105<n><n>With that information, I had two different ways to solve the problem.  One way would be to calculate how much money he needs to make up the difference, and another would be to calculate how many dollars he has left over after mowing the lawn.<n><n>The difference between these two, on the surface, seems to be that the first calculation has an unknown value.  If we know that we will not mow the lawn until after he has earned the money, then the first calculation is easier.<n><n>With my experience with arrays in 100 Days of Code, I started writing a simple program.<n><n>```<n>#include <iostream><n><n>int main() {<n>    int amount_already_saved;<n>    int amount_needed;<n>    std::cout << "Please enter the total amount of money  saved so far: ";<n>    std::cin >> amount_already_savede;<n>    std::cin << "Please enter the dollar amount of the new bike: ";<n>    std.cin >> amount_bikeneeded;<n>    std.cin << "Please enter if you want to mow lawn first: ";<n>    std:cin>> lawn;<n>    if (lawn==1) {<n>        amount = amount + amount_bikeneeeded;<n>    }<n>    else{<n>        amount = amount - amount_bikeneedeed;<n>    } <n>    return 0;<n>}<n>```<n><n>However, one of the most important aspects of the questions is that we know how much money he has saved already.  The problem in my code is that I was subtracting from an unspecified amount.<n><n>I learned from the mistakes of this program and re-wrote my code with

Choices:  A: gathering of information B: communication C: feel relaxed D: kill boredom E: social bonding<n>Output:		A<n>In the problem 3, you're given a situation about herbalist medicine and you decide to sell it in the drug company. So, you're going to sell the whole drug store but not the herbalist medicine. So, let 'S' mean the herbalist medicine and 'D', the drug store. So, in the problem 4, the number of money is a number variable and the word money in your program means the number itself. The first line is the definition of the output variables so you write the word number and the number itself. So, if your answer is 6, write 6. In the first line, write 'n = 2.'. In the second line, you assign'm = n - 6'.'m' means the number of money remaining that she has after using the stickers. In line #1, we want the value of X after the assignment statements. In fact, these statements are called assignment and we want to do something like this when the sum of the number of stickers and the value of the number of remaining stickers equals the number of money input to the problem, therefore, we want to subtract the number of remaining stickering plus the number of money, we want to subtract from the input number of money. So, here, we write after the assignment, minus. Now in line #2, we calculate the number of money less than 'n' and we get the remainder by calculation. For example, if n is 80 and if'm' equals 60, then, 80 minus 60, we get 20 and 20 is divisible by 2, then the remainder is 0. The output is 6.<n>The problem 3: The problem ask us to find out the number of money that he must raise to buy the bike and I do it in the same way. And the way I solve it is you first write the definition of the output, how much more money does Zach has to raise more by writing 'M', the letter M, equal to the number of money, the input. So that's the definition of the output. We are going to ask a computer to calculate that. And the first line is the definition for the input, Zach's weekly money, 'w'. The second line is you assign'm' means money remaining, you have to subtract 'w', a smaller number than bigger number.

Choices:  A: exhilaration B: dismemberment C: spinal injuries D: getting wet E: splats<n>Output:		 B<n><n>#### Explanation: A: "Exhilarating experience" would be something that a person would experience upon doing something fun, interesting, but it is not something associated with comedic what, as it is only used to describe a positive experience in someone's life. B: "Dismemberment" would not be used in the context of "comedic what" in the same way, as it does not describe a positive experience. "Comedic what" would be used in the same way as "comic relief" to indicate a comedy that is meant to be funny, as opposed "cringe comedy", which is a comedy that is supposed to be an embarrassing moment in the plot. D: "Splat" does not work in the same way as the comedic what, as "splat" is only used in relation to a specific object, which means that it doesn't necessarily refer to what the person was doing directly.<n><n>#### Explanatory note: The answer to question #2 is "B" because there is a strong chance the word "comedic" might actually mean "cringe comedy" which is a type of comedy that's supposed to evoke laughter through embarrassment, rather than "comic relief," which would be any humor that is meant to be humorous and therefore, might end in a comedic what.

It’s a precious gift, and you don’t share it with just anyone you meet.  There are those you care for and those you don’t.  I tell them where to go.  They’ll never see the inside, but they can feel it.  Whenever they knock, if I happen to be close enough, I’ll toss them a  coin.  The  coin is small, but the worth is great.  And if you think about it, happiness is something to be made of, not made out.  It’s hard to describe happiness.  You can’t describe freedom to a slave.  You can also be happy sitting up, if you know how to choose a seat.  This means you can’t be sad if you’re sitting up.  You and you alone know what happiness means to you.  That’s why I think to myself, you fool yourself!  The words you say are like  empty bottles filled with your  sighs.  And with each sigh, you blow all of your happiness.  And if you believe life is not worth living, then you’ll certainly die before it's time.  For in the end, the meaning of life is not to be happy, but to bring joy to another.  If life is merely an accumulation of seconds, you will never be at rest.  It's not about winning in life.  Nor is it about living life to the fullest.  It’s about giving it your all.  To have no regrets in life is not easy, if you think about it.  The only thing worse than having a broken heart is having a broken heart and no one to blame.  Don’t give them a reason to say no.  You’re too good to be left on the shelf.  Even when you fail, you still hold out your hand for another chance to succeed.  You don’t see the good, but I do.  So what should you

Instead,  they must be written in Pseudo code format.   <n>We are going to be reading through each students work individually and discussing the format in detail to make sure it is as clear as possible.<n><n>### Instructions: <n><n>Now it is time for discussion! After reading through each individual students work, we would like to discuss your progress. We will go through the submitted pseudo code questions and give you feedback. Please be prepared to ask questions, and don't be afraid to ask for feedback or clarification.<n><n>### Discussion Questions : <n><n>-  What worked well?<n>-  What didn't work?<n>-  What still needs to be cleaned up/talked through/discussed?<n>-  What questions do we still need the answer to?<n>-  Did anything surprise you?<n><n>### Post-lecture Discussion: <n>

Mary had 89 stickers.    She used 3 large sticker on the front page of 7 pages in her journal. How many  sticker does Mary have remaining? <n><n>2.  Zach is saving his money for a brand new bike.  He has already save up $65. His friend offered him pay out of his back-yard tree which could sell him for about $35. The total money he want for a bike is about $100. He could also get $80 from his parents.   The total money he need to get is   $80 + $35 + $65 = $180<n><n>3.   Mark has kangaroose and goats. Kangarooses have two legs and goat have four legs, and goat four times more than kangaroose, so 23 kangaroo's= 84 goat. Total number of legs kangarooses and goat is 2 leg+3 leg= 5 legs per animal.<n><n>4. We can break the number into two parts, 20 dollars is left after first 9 rounds. In the tenth round we need 287 average, which is equal to 287 x 4/10 x 9= 376.3 per round. Therefore, we need to add total 376.2 points. So in total 1,024.3 points is needed.<n><n>5 Max takes 20 minutes to do his biology and history tasks. However, we need to add 10 more minutes for the extra tasks, so it takes him 30 minutes <n><n>6  How do we get something faithful together? Binds things together or compact something together. So the correct answer is bound or compact.<n><n>7.We can simplify by combining fraction with 2. 21/4=13/2+8/2, we know that 13 is 2 times more than 8. So answer is 2.<n><n>8. We can substitute 48  - 1, so that we have 47. In order to make difference

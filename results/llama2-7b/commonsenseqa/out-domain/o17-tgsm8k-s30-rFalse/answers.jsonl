I will be using these two kinds of functions for my algorithm. If I create a simple program that recognizes linear functions and exponents and asks students to identify the function given a given set of given variables,  then asks them to solve a given equation, that will look like what I am looking for.\n\n#### I have decided to use Javascript and the HTML + CSS of a website. So my algorithm doesn\u2019t have to be in the form of an if statement.  I can use the HTML + CSS of the website to have some of the things that I need for my algorithm. For example the <select> <input> <label> </div> tags and attributes like the onchange event can be used to check if the student chose the right function. Also, if there is an equation, for example 4x2 = 8x3,  I think the onselect event is sufficient to determine to which equation you have put the x. By analyzing the HTML and CSS of my program and knowing how it works, I think it has potential to be a good, practical algorithm.", "answer": "C: blowing hard"}

So it will take 400/20= 20 trucks for transportation.  Now we have to find total time transportation. Total time to transport is 1/20 +1/20 + 1/20+\u2026.i.e. total time is 1/2+ 2/20+3/199 +\u2026. so total time is 1/(2*20)+(1*220)* 2/20= 1+220= 221.  So total hours = 220+221=441 and so, total hours to transport 400 head is 400/441 =40 hours.\n\n3.

Now if we are dealing with a unit that is measured in days then the 11 days, we are given will fall in that category if it lasts a week or more.\nSo the statement makes sense and we can say that she have paid 310\nIn the case of the second statement the statement is like\n\nHe will drive for 60 miles to transport 400 head to higher grounds.\n\nNow if the statement gives the total distance and time it will take then it make sense to us. If it gives us the distance and tells us how much time it will take then we need to do some math.\n\nWe can say that the statement makes sense so we can say the total mileage will be 40 which makes total 40 days\n\n300 is given but the question is how much it will cost to rent the house. So we can say this statement makes sense we just need to identify the time. Let us say the time is a days. so we can say\n50 * 14 = 700\n\nso its 50 dollars and is given\n\nWe just need to subtract 50 and that gives us\n\nSo we can see that the rental will cost 800 dollars\n\nSo we will be charging $3900.\n50 percent is 50\n150/3 = 50\n\nWe are then left with 175 dollars.\n\n175/100 = 0.175\n\n175 * 100/8 = 222.5\n\nSo we can be charged for 222.\n\nNow 1 pounds is 16 ounces", "answer": "B: unbreakable"}

Twenty-five percent of those from Mexico speak Spanish.  Of those that speak Spanish, 40% speak only English at home. If forty students from Mexico speak Spanish at home, how many students at the school speak only Spanish at home?\nOutput: \n\n## Explanation\nLet's start off with an example input: $6*6=36$. We know that the question is asking us to find the sum of two consecutive odd numbers. So if $k$ is a number we can say that $2k+1$ is an odd number. When $k=0$, we get $1$. If $k=1$, we'll get $3$. Then $2*1+1$ and $2*2$ will equal $6$. So the answer $6$ can be found by looking at the sum of two consecutive integer numbers. For this problem: $36*36=1296$.\n\n### Input: The car-rentar\n\nLet's look at the first problem. The $x^y$ expression we created to represent the relationship between the car rental price, $x$, and how long we rent for, $y$, works fine. This tells us that if we rent the car for at least $9$ days we will incur a discount. To use the discount formula we multiply both $190$ and $x$.\n\nThe first number we have to worry about is $y + 1$. We won't pay the full price until day $10$. So we need to subtract that from $9$.\n\nAnother piece of information we should know is that we are only dealing with whole dollar amounts, not in $y$. $x$ is the number of days we are renting a car and $y$ is how long we are renting it for. So $230$ is the total $8$ days", "answer": "B: gaining knowledge"}

The right value of the answer is 72.\n\nOutput: E\n\nInput: If you add all the numbers in every column, what sum is 9,991?\n\nOutput: 49\n\n```\n- Explanation: The first sum is 9, +12, +15, +18 = 64. We now have 4,987. Add the 50, + is equal to 55,500. Then 64 +(50+55,50+55)=110. 110 to 9 is 10,000\n\n- In this case, the left expression is one which is a result of multiplying letters and numbers. For example: 52 = 5 x 25\n\n- The rule is that multiplication can only have things in parenthesis that contain a single letter and a single number that multiplied together would result in the answer being only one single number, in this case the answer would be 1. In other words, to only have multiplication in your expression you either have to multiply or to divide.\n\n- All multiplication has a result that can't be divided by any numbers. To find the answer the first thing to do is to do the division of the above expression to the first number in the second expression, this is the equivalent of 55,550 divided by 9, because the numbers in the second expression can be divided by the first number in the first expression. The answer for 55,580/2 is 49. It can be rewriten as: 350/2 = 175.\n\n- The next thing to do is to multiply all the values that's in parenthesis, to make sure", "answer": "E: gratitude"}

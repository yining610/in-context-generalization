What are all  common divisors  of 20343?<n>Output: To decide if a number is prime or not, you have to consider all the multiples of the number and if they are the original number or are less than 1, then the number is not prime.<n>So the first candidate to consider is 2 since it is the multiplier of 20337.<n>If it is prime you can move forwards.<n>So 20332 * 2 = 40664 and if it is not prime it should not be listed.<n>A number is prime if it is the only number besides 1 less than a certain number in that place so in this case the only numbers to check are 3 5 7 11 13 and 17.<n>We have to do this in reverse the same way if the number is NOT prime.<n>We consider all the factors and we only list them if they are NOT prime.  These must be checked in reverse.<n>So in the end the remaining factors are 7 11 and 17<n>So the final answer in this case is 11 and 7<n><n>Input: Given a 3D coordinate, translate the coordinate so the positive Z moves one unit up and the positive X moves one unit left.  What are the new values of the components if the original coordinate is (1,2,1)?<n>Output: The x and y components should change 1 - 1 = -2 which means the new x component would be -2<n>The z component should change 1 + 1 = 2 which means the new of component will be 2<n>Now there is no change to the x component so the coordinate becomes (1,-2,2)<n><n>Input: Consider 13582. First, subtract the number of vowels in the number (1 vowel), and subtract the number of digits (12 digits). If your answer is negative, then the number has no letters. If your answer is positive, then the number has letters in it.<n>Now add the number of vowals plus 1 to the number of letters in

What if the question is about some really complex word problem? What if the whole paragraph is just a long chain of phrases with an answer somewhere in there? It really depends on context, and there are probably a lot of other things that are not obvious to solve at all.<n># Answers<n>To answer each question the general process is to take them apart and see how many individual parts there are and then determine how many of those numbers fall into the category of something you are looking to obtain.<n>For example, to figure out how many weeks in a semester at a certain school, you will first note that there are 52 weeks each year and then you divide by the number of week long semesters in one school year.<n># Problems<n>The only problems I

Choices:  A.  article B.  adjective C.  interjection D.  conjunction  E. pronoun<n>Output: B. adjective<n><n>## Expected input<n>4<n><n>### Expected output<n>B. adjective<n><n># Solution:<n><n>#### Part A<n>Since the value of `b` in `i <= a, i <= b, 0 <= b < 1000` implies that `0 <= b`, so `b` in the final statement is either `a` or `0`. The second statement of recursion `2 <= i * i < 100` can be simplified to `2 <= i ^ 2 < 100`. Since `2` is never less than `0`, we can safely replace the second statement with `2 ^ i < 10`. Finally, `0 < 10` implies that the recurrence `B.P` has a unique solution - `a`. Thus, unique solution is `a`.<n><n><n>#### Part B<n>The base case is to set `l = 2 ^ r` and `r = s`. In the first statement of recursion, `2 ^ r` can take on exactly `5` and `6` different values which is `2, 4, 8, 16, 32`. However there are `5` different values that `2` can take on which include `1, 2, 4, \color{red}{6}\color{blue}{4}, \color{red}{8}\color{blue}{6}` and  `2, \color{red}{\color{blue}{8}\color{red}{16}}, \color{red}{\\color{blue}{16}}, 16`. The second statement of the recursion `2 ^ (2 ^ r) < 10` evaluates to `2 ^ (2^2)^ < 10` as well as `2^2^3 == 8` and hence we can see that it is true. Thus, we are done for the base case and the recursive case is where to move on to.<n>

How many more rabbits could he have potentially seen? (Note : we know that the number between '4' and '8' is '4'. So we can easily understand if more than 8, then it has infinite number of rabbits)<n>Output: In order to fulfil the question, he should say 'I have seen 'n' rabbits which is atleast 4. So, number of rabbits which can be seen in next month should be more than 4' or 'I have seen 'x' rabbits that can be at least '4'. Atleast it should be more than 0. So, I think it is 'infinite' (4+50= 54...I mean in every month should be the rabbit which we have not seen in previous month)<n><n>

Choices:  A: downtown area B: urban area C: new york city D: shopping mall E: military base<n>Output:		A: downtown areab: urban area C:new york city D:shopping mall E:military base<n>Downtowns areas are urban areas and all movies theaters require downtown areas to be established first since movies theaters are commercial places.<n>The question asks about where can you find a movie theatre and since military bases are not allowed to establish any type of commercial places, it is obvious that only a movie theater can be established in a downtown arena to serve its customers.<n>It is also stated that all movies theather can be found in only downtown arena<n><n>The rest of the answer choices are not true.<n><n>New York City is not a shopping mall and no movie theatres are established in there as well.<n>Shopping malls are commercial establishments which include stores, a food court, theatres and sometimes restaurants and are not military bases.<n>Military bases are areas of interest for the army to be able to carry out military campaigns and not a place for movies theaters<n><n>Even if military bases are allowed to establish movies theatres, it would not make sense to have military movies theatre, especially in theatres like cinema as they can be used to convey military propagandas.<n><n>So the final answer must be "D Downtown Area"<n>Since "D" is a option that is not in the answer choices, so "D" must be the answer<n><n>Input: If a frog swims 49 laps around a 100 foot lane indoor pool to travel 1690 feet, how many more laps would the frog need to swim if the lane is 125 feet wide instead of 100 feet wide?<n>Output: 30.6 laps The frog swims 30.8 laps if the lane is wider.<n>The frog travels 1690/100 = 16.9 metres If the lane is 49 feet wider, there will be more of a straight away, and less lapping back and forth.<n>Simply put, if it’s 49 laps, the frog would be swimming laps backwards, too:<n>100/49 = 4. 8 laps backwards

Choices: A: the team that scored the most points B: the team that scored fewer points than half the score C: C: the team total was half the sum of the other teams D: none of these<n>Output: The team that won the game must have scored the most points. The choice of either team scoring fewer points, or the sum of the other team equaling less than the half of that team's total cannot happen.<n>Half of the sum of the other two teams' scores is 13 + 19 + 25 23 + 19 = <<23+19=42>>42.<n>The team's total was half of 42. Since 42 is greater than the team's total, the team could not have lost by a score in half the sum of the two teams' totals.<n>Since this is not the final answer, a team has to win.<n>Since we know that the team with the highest score, 25, was the second team to score, it won the game.<n>The score is not given for the team that lost, so it can not be inferred by the question.<n>So the final score must be 25-19=6, the

If the delivery man delivers to customers on a regular schedule, half of his deliveries are before 7 PM and the other half are from 7 PM until closing (this way he has 7 o'clock left). In addition, his lefts overs are either from:  A:  a previous order B:  half and half- half meat half vegetarian and half pizza half pasta.<n>Output: Let's say the man has 6 lefts overs with him during each delivery.<n>He has 7 deliveries where 7 of the deliveries are before 6PM. This gives him one left over to use on each of those deliveries. He only has 7 pizzas (6 for deliveries and 1 for him). This means one of his deliveries is made after 6PM and contains 6 of his lefts overs for that day.<n>He has 6 other deliveries where 5 of the deliveries are after 6PM. This means those 5 deliveries are made at 7PM, 8PM, 9PM, 10PM and 11PM. This time 5 pizzas are made (10 left overs x 5 = 50 + 1(left over pizza of first delivery))). Since it is 10PM and the last delivery does have the 6th left over, he only has 40 left over pieces of pizza.<n>He has 3 deliveries that are from 8PM to 11PM. (2 lefts overs x 3 = 6). During these times he uses one left over (and not the 9th left over) from each delivery.<n>For the delivery after 11PM, he only has 50 left overs left to use or 1.<n>Therefore he delivers after 7PM to 2 customers, after 7PM to an additional 4 customers and then at

This can be an appliance or a vehicle, anything you have purchased and for which you received an invoice.<n>Output: You can have a number to input so you only need it if you want to input yourself. After that it's just the number of inputs, that is, the number of most expensive things you bought, so I should write code to write the number of most expensive thing(s) you own. <n>For example: I have a number that should be 1 so firstly I input that I have 1 most expensive thing. After that I use a function or something that takes as input the price of the thing you bought and outputs the most expensive thing. Or after that I can use the function, and it's the same but you do it after. <n>So after that, if for example the price of thing is more than or equal to $5000, then you print "my most expensive thing is " for example "my most expensive thing $6000" and for $5999 you write "my most expensive thing" and so on. <n><n><n><n>Input: Write one.<n>Output: You write a number of things you have bought (so that the program works).<n><n>You first create a list of all the variables you defined.

A sale cannot include $0 and the sale price.  If there is a sale with no change given, the customer must spend at least \$1.  If there is no sale at all, there is a 5% tip added to all tabs.\n\nHow much change will be given when the bill is \$27.24 and there is a sale of \$8.98?<n>Output:Since a 10% sale price of \$8.97 would give us the sale price of \$8, a sale of \$8 would include the sale price of \$7.92 <n>Since we need at least \$1 in the bill, we either need to add \$1 and give a change of \$1 or a sale of \$9.81<n>The bill is: \$35.81 + 1 = \$36 + Change = \$4.39\n\n\nFor the total amount paid, the bill is \$36 or \$36.11, so the total change for this sale is \$36.1 - \$36.0 = \$5.19\n\nFor our second sale, the sale price is \$8.97, which is greater than \$8.9, so the sale would be: \$8 + \$7.92 = \$15.92\n\nSince the sale price is \$1 + \$9 + \$8.9 = \$18.9, if there is a sale for \$9.81, we would have more than $19 in our bill. Thus, the total change would be: \$19.19 - \$19.00 = $0.19<n>The total change is \$0.19 and our bill is \$36.09.\n\nThe final answer is \$36.28<n><n>Input:There are 6 pizzas at a barbecue.  6 friends each choose one.  1 friend only chooses 4, and the 6th friend will split the rest.

Python is often described as a "batteries included" language<n>because it comes with a variety of standard libraries. Also, its syntax makes it more readable.<n><n>---<n><n>Python Tips<n>* Python does not define type. It automatically converts data to the proper types for input to and output from<n>functions.<n>* Unlike VBA and C/C++, Python has no pointers and no inheritance. Python is a statically typed language and<n>supports only single inheritance (no multiple inheritance) which is similar to C and Java. Since there are no<n>pointers in python, pointer arithmetic is not used to access memory addresses, and the memory space is<n>allocated by the dynamic python interpreter itself.<n>* Function is a first class object in Python.<n>* Python supports both local and nonlocal variables.<n>* Operator overloading is not supported in Python.<n>* There are three types of keywords in Python: Keywords, Identifiers and Labels.<n>* Python’s string type is implemented as a list of bytes, with an immutable representation.<n>* Python supports function overloading.<n>* Python’sstringsareimmutable—a string is simply an array of characters.<n>* Python’strue string are immutable and are only written once—not changed—throughout the process of<n>executing a program.<n><n>For this class,  I will be learning what I need to know from our lectures and using this website as a<n>reference:<n>https://www.w3schools.com/python/<n><n>---<n><n>Practice problems with Solutions<n>* https://medium.com/@futurist_me/how-i-successfully-learned-python-50fc118a9c69<n><n>* https://www.codingprep.com/python/python-practice-test_q.php<n><n>* https://realpython.com/python-tutorial-for-beginners/<n><n>* http://www.pythoninstitute.com/<n><n>---<n>### Homework Question 1<n><n>#### Input<n>What is your favorite food you have eaten this week?<n><n>#### C

Choices:  A: happiness B: pleasure C: happy D: grief E: isolation<n>Output:		Even though we think in a society that marriage is supposed to work, it is in fact a legal and financial commitment to one person and many people get divorced. Even if two people are madly in love, they may marry for the wrong reasons, then in time they may grow apart and divorce. The relationship may dull or become a source of frustration and misery.<n>So what is the husband supposed to feel after the divorce?<n>Divorce is an end and a beginning. There may be many feelings of sadness, guilt, fear, or resentment towards the spouse, loss and grief over the ending of the marriage, even if the split is mutual. There may be anger, feelings of shame or disappointment if you were blindsided by the divorce, confusion about the choices you made, or questioning of your past marital history.<n>The feeling of loss is strongest at any emotional distance (division of assets can also be a stressful and confusing experience).<n>Hopefully you can move on with the healing process and grow from this experience.  Even if you don't have children, you still have to divide the assets equally and file taxes with them. Although not everyone is successful in divorce, you might be able to achieve a fair settlement, and if you can't, at least avoid a big fight.<n><n>So A: happiness is incorrect and B: pleasure is incorrect.<n>So the final is E: isolation since the only options that are realistic is either A or E<n><n>Input: A bicycle tire has a radius of 0.23m.

When the time came for him to begin studying for finals, he felt confident and ready to tackle them. On the first day of the first final, he completed it well and passed it with flying colours. The second final started off very difficult, as were the others. By the third day, no one had a clue to how do answer the questions. This was on day 4 of the finals. How many days of finals did the students go through?<n>Output:  First question has the difficulty level easy, second question with medium level and third has the most difficult level. In the first question, he took a little but had high hopes. So, A is clearly an option he chose, but he completed it and passed with flying colours. As he had completed the first one, the second question will have medium level difficulty. He feels confident and ready. Then the 3rd question has difficult level and the time goes on, nobody knows how to answer it. This will come for the 4th day of finals, where now no one has a clue to answer. If he choose E, then he passed the first to third, which will not make sense as he still have to pass the 4th. So E is the wrong option. But for D, it's also clear since for the second final, the young man feels confident and ready. He still has to pass the 4rd to complete it. Hence, D is the correct answer<n>Input: There are 27 apples in a bucket. Abe ate 19 of the apples. One third of the remaining apples are now gone.

In a race of 200 meters, there was 30 people in front of Bob and in a race of 300 meters there was only 10 people in front of him.  Finally, there were 5 people in front of him in a race of 600 meters.  How old is Bob?<n>Output: Let's say Bob's age is x.<n>In a race of 1 meter, there are 49 people in from of Bob. So that means 100 - 49 = <<49>>49, so there are, a total of 100 people in front of bob. So, 1/100 =<<1/100= x/200>>x/200 This is the x we found using <n>division so x=<<2>>2<n>In a race of a 200m race, there are 30 people in from of Bob, and in a race of a 300m race there are 10 people in from from bob. (So 10 * 30 =10/70 x+20)=<<10*30=10/70x+20>>x+20 =x+20. Now in a race of a300m race we have 10 people in 300m in one second, so (10/10 * 3600) = <<10/10*3600=3600>>3600 =1 for all time<n>So at 500m we need 500 - (3600/1) =<<500-3600/2=500>>500, this again we can use long division on it to find x which gives us x=<<2>>x=2 as before.<n>So,<n>In the last 100m race, we add 2 from 200m, a 1 from 500m, and 400m we add 4<n>So the

There are ten sheep in a field. Some of them are dogs. The farmer gives birth to four more sheep. After the birth, the number of sheep in the field is 5 more than the original number. How many cats were born that day?<n>Output: Before birth, the number of animals is the sum of sheep and dogs. For simplicity's sake, we will assume that there are no other animals besides sheep and dogs, so we will call the total number of animals, "y". There are 10+4 sheep and an original 8 dogs, so y= <<10+4+8=##18>>8+4+818.<n>If we are asked to find the difference between sheep and the original number of sheep or dogs, that comes out to 8 - y = <<8-8=0>>8.<n>The farmer had 0 fewer sheep and an additional 4 sheep, so y = 4, then + 5, so y = 9.<n>After adding 5 sheep, there are 10+5 sheep = 15 sheep now.<n>Because 15 - y = <<15 - 8=7>>7 is true, we can eliminate 8, and since x + 5 = y we can say that x = <<x=5>> 5 dogs were born that day! <n>So the final answer to the question is 5 Dogs!<n><n>Input: There are 8 apples.

On Tuesday, she picks half as many seashells as she did on Monday. If she can sell each seashell for $1.20, how much money can she make if she sells all of her seashells?<n>Output: On Tuesday, Sally picks 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 seashells<n>In total, Sally picks 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 seashells<n>The total amount of money Sally can make is 45 * $1.20 = $<<45*1.2=54>>54<n>So the final answer is 54<n><n>Input: Jordan and Perry took a boat out to the lake to go fishing on a Monday morning. Jordan caught 4 fish and Perry caught double what Jordan caught. On the way back to shore, the boat tipped over and they lost one-fourth of their total catch. How many fish remain?<n>Output: Since Perry caught double what Jordan caught, Perry caught 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 fish.<n>Altogether, they caught 8 + 4 = <<8+4=12>>12 fish.<n>On the way back to the shore, they lost 12 * 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 fish.<n>They have 12 - 3 = <<12-3=9>>9 fish remaining.<n>So the final answer is 9<n><n>Input:Sam didn't like the people he met while traveling.  What might he do to get away from them? Choices:  A: come home B: airplane C: learn from each other D: go out E: make art<n>Output:		<<115-48=67>>67 minutes<n>Since B is chosen, A and C will be the resultant options left, in which case the remaining 67/2 = <<67/2=33.5>>33.5 minutes are needed.<n>So the final Answer is 70.5<n><n>Input:<n>Three plus the number of times I like this movie is equal to 45.<n>If I like this movie four times, then three plus the number of times minus four is equal to 40.<n>Eight divided by two plus six is six.<n>Is six plus the number of times times times times times times is equal to 34?<n><n>Output:<n>We know that 45 = 4 * 3 + 10, meaning 4 + 3 is 7. Now, since we're subtracting, we just need to substract both sides by 3, resulting in 45 - 3 = 38, meaning 7 + 4 = 13, which is 3+7 = 8, which is 77+36=113.<n>So the final solution will be 113<n><n>Input: What is 1 + 3/4 of 5 × 3?<n>Output: 1 + 3 / 4 * 5 x 3 = 1 x 3 + 1 x 1 + 18 / 4<n>1 + 18/4 = 1 + 7 <n>So 7  = <<1 + (18 divided by 4 = 4.5 )>>4.5 <n>So the final solution is 21.5<n><n>Input Three more than six times the difference between my age and my dad's age is equal to one. My dad is 323 years older than 12. How old am I?<n>Output The number of times my age and the number of times my dad's is equal to 4, resulting in 6 * 4 = <<6*4=24>>24 <n>Since three more than six times the number of my age is also equal to 3, the output will be 27 = <<27=27>>27<n>So the final solution for my age is 27<n><n>Input: The number

If you choose applejuice then you are guaranteed to like your drink. But if you choose lemonade then you will like your drink 75% of the time (you are guaranteed to like your choice if they are at a 50/50 chance). For this logic puzzle, you'll get the applejuice or lemonade that is recommended to you. Which of the following choices would have the highest probability? Choices:  Applejuice A: 75%; B: 100; C: 33.33%; D: 12.5%; E: 12.16%<n>Output: D: 12,6%<n>If you choose apple juice, you are guaranteed to like you're drink.<n>There's a 12,5% chance of you choosing applejuice.<n>If you choose applejuice and like you're drink, then there's a 100% chance that you would have liked the drink.<n>So there's a 2,5% chance you will choose applejuice and the drink that you choose to have is applejuice.<n>So the answer is A. The probability of apple juice being chosen is a 75% chance.<n><n>Input: A 12-gallon fish tank holds 90 fish and 12 gallons of water.

Choices:  A: living room B: dog park C: basket D: small apartment E: big house<n>Output:		A basket could be the right answer, because it is a dog's "small apartment." The living room might be too big for the small dog, especially since he is indoors. The dog park is probably too big, as well, for a small dog who prefers to stay indoors. Though a small dog has a lot of room in a big house, a basket is still more accurate, because a small dog can't get lost in a big house. It's pretty comfortable in a basket indoors, too. So the final answer is C<n>```

Therefore, D is not a true answer because you would not see a large group of people sat in chairs.<n>You would need to be standing to see many people in a church or an office, but this does not occur in a synagogue.<n>There is no way to determine whether people are sat or standing in a confessional, but it is unlikely that you will find many people in a confessional.<n>The only place you would find many people in a single room are in an auditorium and a meeting in an office, but these two areas are not suitable for listening to a religious service.<n>The office is not quiet and most people will not sit there because they would rather watch a movie or play a video game during their free time.<n>Finally, in a synagogue, people go to listen to a religious service. As a result, E would not be a perfect answer because this type of place cannot be found in a synagogue that people attend to listen to a religious speech.<n>We choose answer A as the correct answer because a synagogue is the perfect place to sit in a chair and listen to a religious speaker.<n><n>Input: How many feet are there in a 2 mile drive and how is this related to a foot?<n>Output: 2 miles=<<2 miles=1760000>>17600<n>There are 5280 feet in 1 mile.<n>17600 / 5280 = <<17600/5280=34>>34<n>So 17600 feet = 2 * 34 = <<2*34=72>>72 feet<n>There is a total of 72 feet in a 2 mile walk.

I will call the number that comes to my head right now the "target." There will be 5 clues on the page of this book, and each clue will tell me how to get closer to my target. I will go through 5 different stages to get my target. One clue might tell me to multiply my previous number by 10. I might go through these 5 stages three different times. When I say I will "go from $previous$ to $current$" as a result of a clue, the result might not be my target.  What number will I have reached at the end of a clue? Choices: A: The next integer B: The next multiples set C: Not applicable D: The number my mind came up with the first time I thought about the clue<n>Output: At first, the target was the number the user initially thought of, but in every answer choice, 10 would<n><n>be multiplied.<n><n>First, at step 1, the target was the user's initial number. Step 1 led to step 2. Step 2 led to step 3. Step 3 led to step 4. Step 4 led to step 5. At the end of step 5, the target still was the user's original answer. At first, the target<n>was 0, but after applying all 5 steps, it changed to 6, 30, 100, 200, and 300. Step 1 led from 0 to 120, which, when multiplied by 10, equals 1200. Step 2 led from 120 to 1260, which, when multiply by 10,<n>equals 126,000. Step 3 led from 126,600 to 1,266,600, which, when multipled by 10, equaled 12,666,60. Step 4 led from

The mistake was on calculating the total number of Schnauzer puppies.<n><n>Comment: It's not about whether or not the original answer was correct. I was pointing out that the output answer doesn't really match up.

The same study went on to determine that for every 782 residents in the city, there is at least one person diagnosed with Type B Personality. At least one person in every family has suffered from Type C Personality. How many families are there in the city of Keta Bontang?<n>Output: In the city of Keta, there are 333 / 1000 = <<333/1000=0.333>>0.333 Type A personalities, and each personality has 782 / 100=<<782/100=7.82>>7.82 friends. The total number of people in the city is 333 + (7.82 * 782) = <<333+(7.82*782)=2769>>2769.<n>Let’s say there are 2 families per household.<n>The total number of households that are left is 2 * 2769 = <<2*2769=5538>>5538<n>So the final answer would be 5538<n><n>Input: I have 352 more bananas than apples.

A passenger arrives at the subway station and tries every other door to find the door open. She chooses at random one of these doors to enter the station.<n>At that moment, an employee with a wheelbarrow enters the station. He has eight lit bags which contain candies, and he fills every open seat. When he leaves, he always chooses the same door.<n>How many unopened bags remain in the wheelbarrow?<n>There are 6 doors total. 5 of which are open. 6/5 are doors that are open. 5/5 are doors that have been tried. 5/5 = 1. 5/3 = 1.5. <n>So the one remaining handle is 1/6 the number of doors that don't have handles. 6*1/6 is 1. 6 - 1 is 5 open doors. 5 closed doors. 5 lit bags. 5*open doors is 25. 25*1 (the number of doors that have handles) is 25.<n>So the answer will be 1.

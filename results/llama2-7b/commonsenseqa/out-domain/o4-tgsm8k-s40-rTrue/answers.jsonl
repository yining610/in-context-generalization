Four years later, another plane crashed into the building and killed 50 people, but only six people on the first floor. How many people survived?\nOutput:\nAnswer :72\n\nThe formula of a plane crash that kills 100 people can be expressed as 100 / (floor+1), and the formula of a plane crash killing 50 people can be expressed\nas 50 / (floor+3).\n\nSince 3 is less than 100 - 1 = <<3<(100-1)=4>>4, this means the first plane crash has fewer people survived.

Choices:  A.  article B.  adjective C.  interjection D.  conjunction  E. pronoun\nOutput: B. adjective\n\n## Expected input\n4\n\n### Expected output\nB. adjective\n\n# Solution:\n\n#### Part A\nSince the value of `b` in `i <= a, i <= b, 0 <= b < 1000` implies that `0 <= b`, so `b` in the final statement is either `a` or `0`. The second statement of recursion `2 <= i * i < 100` can be simplified to `2 <= i ^ 2 < 100`. Since `2` is never less than `0`, we can safely replace the second statement with `2 ^ i < 10`. Finally, `0 < 10` implies that the recurrence `B.P` has a unique solution - `a`. Thus, unique solution is `a`.\n\n\n#### Part B\nThe base case is to set `l = 2 ^ r` and `r = s`. In the first statement of recursion, `2 ^ r` can take on exactly `5` and `6` different values which is `2, 4, 8, 16, 32`. However there are `5` different values that `2` can take on which include `1, 2, 4, \\color{red}{6}\\color{blue}{4}, \\color{red}{8}\\color{blue}{6}` and  `2, \\color{red}{\\color{blue}{8}\\color{red}{16}}, \\color{red}{\\\\color{blue}{16}}, 16`. The second statement of the recursion `2 ^ (2 ^ r) < 10` evaluates to `2 ^ (2^2)^ < 10` as well as `2^2^3 == 8` and hence we can see that it is true. Thus, we are done for the base case and the recursive case is where to move on to.", "answer": "D: conjunction"}

It was on sale last night at $4.75. How much is it discounted per night?\nOutput: Since the price was discounted $1 - $1 * <<2=1>><<1=1>>1 the night prior, it is discounted (1 / 2) * <<1/2 = 0.5>><<0.5=2.5>>2.5 dollars each night.\nLet's say x is the number of nights since the item is discounted each night.\nThe current price of the item is 6 - 3x + (1 / 2)* <<1/2-2=1>><<<1/2-2>=1.5>><<1.5=3>>3.5 = <<6-3x+1/2=5>>5.5, where x and 3 are both integers.\nSo \nthe new price is 6 - 5.5, so 6-3x=<<5.5-3=2>>2 dollars in the first three nights.\nSo, $2 is discounted $6 - 2 to get $8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 dollars\nThe last night the price is 6 - x = <<6-x=4>>4.\nSo the answer is $6-$4 = <<10-6=4>>4.", "answer": "A: fast food restaurant"}

In addition, his lefts overs are either from:  A:  a previous order B:  half and half- half meat half vegetarian and half pizza half pasta.\nOutput: Let's say the man has 6 lefts overs with him during each delivery.\nHe has 7 deliveries where 7 of the deliveries are before 6PM. This gives him one left over to use on each of those deliveries. He only has 7 pizzas (6 for deliveries and 1 for him). This means one of his deliveries is made after 6PM and contains 6 of his lefts overs for that day.\nHe has 6 other deliveries where 5 of the deliveries are after 6PM. This means those 5 deliveries are made at 7PM, 8PM, 9PM, 10PM and 11PM. This time 5 pizzas are made (10 left overs x 5 = 50 + 1(left over pizza of first delivery))). Since it is 10PM and the last delivery does have the 6th left over, he only has 40 left over pieces of pizza.\nHe has 3 deliveries that are from 8PM to 11PM. (2 lefts overs x 3 = 6).

After that it's just the number of inputs, that is, the number of most expensive things you bought, so I should write code to write the number of most expensive thing(s) you own. \nFor example: I have a number that should be 1 so firstly I input that I have 1 most expensive thing. After that I use a function or something that takes as input the price of the thing you bought and outputs the most expensive thing. Or after that I can use the function, and it's the same but you do it after. \nSo after that, if for example the price of thing is more than or equal to $5000, then you print \"my most expensive thing is \" for example \"my most expensive thing $6000\" and for $5999 you write \"my most expensive thing\" and so on. \n\n\n\nInput: Write one.\nOutput: You write a number of things you have bought (so that the program works).\n\nYou first create a list of all the variables you defined.

{"text": "Humans do all 6 items.\n\n\n---\n\n### What is Python?\nPython is a general-purpose programming language that combines high-level dynamic semantics with modern\nfeatures found in object-oriented languages. Python is often described as a \"batteries included\" language\nbecause it comes with a variety of standard libraries. Also, its syntax makes it more readable.\n\n---\n\nPython Tips\n* Python does not define type. It automatically converts data to the proper types for input to and output from\nfunctions.\n* Unlike VBA and C/C++, Python has no pointers and no inheritance. Python is a statically typed language and\nsupports only single inheritance (no multiple inheritance) which is similar to C and Java. Since there are no\npointers in python, pointer arithmetic is not used to access memory addresses, and the memory space is\nallocated by the dynamic python interpreter itself.\n* Function is a first class object in Python.\n* Python supports both local and nonlocal variables.\n* Operator overloading is not supported in Python.\n* There are three types of keywords in Python: Keywords, Identifiers and Labels.\n* Python\u2019s string type is implemented as a list of bytes, with an immutable representation.\n* Python supports function overloading.\n* Python\u2019sstringsareimmutable\u2014a string is simply an array of characters.\n* Python\u2019strue string are immutable and are only written once\u2014not changed\u2014throughout the process of\nexecuting a program.\n\nFor this class,  I will be learning what I need to know from our lectures and using this website as a\nreference:\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/\n\n---\n\nPractice problems with Solutions\n* https://medium.com/@futurist_me/how-i-successfully-learned-python-50fc118a9c69\n\n* https://www.codingprep.com/python/python-practice-test_q.php\n\n* https://realpython.com/python-tutorial-for-beginners/\n\n* http://www.pythoninstitute.com/\n\n---\n### Homework Question 1\n\n#### Input\nWhat is your favorite food you have eaten this week?\n\n#### C", "answer": "B: have sex"}

{"text": "Even though we think in a society that marriage is supposed to work, it is in fact a legal and financial commitment to one person and many people get divorced. Even if two people are madly in love, they may marry for the wrong reasons, then in time they may grow apart and divorce. The relationship may dull or become a source of frustration and misery.\nSo what is the husband supposed to feel after the divorce?\nDivorce is an end and a beginning. There may be many feelings of sadness, guilt, fear, or resentment towards the spouse, loss and grief over the ending of the marriage, even if the split is mutual. There may be anger, feelings of shame or disappointment if you were blindsided by the divorce, confusion about the choices you made, or questioning of your past marital history.\nThe feeling of loss is strongest at any emotional distance (division of assets can also be a stressful and confusing experience).\nHopefully you can move on with the healing process and grow from this experience.  Even if you don't have children, you still have to divide the assets equally and file taxes with them. Although not everyone is successful in divorce, you might be able to achieve a fair settlement, and if you can't, at least avoid a big fight.\n\nSo A: happiness is incorrect and B: pleasure is incorrect.\nSo the final is E: isolation since the only options that are realistic is either A or E\n\nInput: A bicycle tire has a radius of 0.23m.

Since the order is reversed, the 64th cell (in the bottom row and 5th column) would be at the bottom left corner of the top 1 by 1 square.\nThe top and right corners of this 1 by 1 matrix are 2 and 3 respectively.\nSince the middle cell would be at the bottom-right corner, it is not possible for the bottom right cell to be any of the numbers 0-3.\nSince the left bottom corner of a 4 by 6 rectangle is always a larger number than the left bottom corner of the 4 by 4 rectangle, the number in the left bottom corner of this array will be greater than the number in the bottom left corner.\nThat means the sum of the four top numbers would be greater than or equal to 143.\nFor 1 to be in the first column, the sum of the remaining numbers in the top row would have to be greater than 143.

Answer: if you look at their glass, it could be a beer, a soda, water, or wine.  But, if it's not a wine glass specifically, then it's not a person drinking wine.\n\n\n## Instruction:\n\nLet's say if you have a number and you add 2 to the number, it'll result in a 2 and if you add 3 to the number, it results in a 1.  Let's say you have 7. 2 + 7 = 9 and then 7 + 3 = 10.  The third digit of the number is 1 (not 2).\nThe next step would be to add 1 to the number, so the new third digit is 2.\nThe second digit of the new number is 2. \nThe next step would then be to add 2 to the new third digit + the second digit and the result would be 4 + 2 = 6.\nBy the same logic, since 6 has a second digit of a 2, a third digit of a 6 when you add one to the second digit you'll get a nine. \nThus, the final output would be 9.\n\nThe steps to convert a number to a binary number using this method would be by adding +1 to the third digit of the number, if there's 0 in the third digit of the original number, and the result would be the second digit of the number as converted.\n\n# Binary to Decimal Conversion \n```\nHow can you calculate the value of a binary number in decimal by following this rule: If the third digit of a binary string is 1, then the second digit when", "answer": "E: celebrating"}

Explain with an example\"\n##Answer: AI can bring positive change to the human workforce. When used properly, new technologies based on artificial intelligence can bring enormous benefits. AI has the potential to replace human labor with advanced robotics, freeing up workers to complete more complex and rewarding jobs. AI can also be used to assist human workers in more efficient ways than ever before, while also increasing productivity. In some cases, AI can be used to automate jobs that have traditionally required large amounts of labor, such as data analysis and sales, and thus create more opportunities for human workers to complete other jobs.\n\n##Instructions:Answer the following short-answer question\"What do we call an AI that can reason, learn and problem solve?

The hiking trails around the lake are open until sunset, and each hiker is required to have a permit to use the trails. The maximum number of people allowed in a group of hikers is 12.  Which hiking group is least likely to get the most people on the trail with permits?\nOutput: The hiking group has 6 people.

If 88 people who lived in Ohio  in 1991 migrated to Ohio in 2000 and 69 people migrated to Ohio in general, how many people moved to Ohio overall?\nOutput: The sum of the people who lived in Ohio plus the amount that moved from other states plus the amount that moved into Ohio from other countries plus the difference between the sum of the people who live in Ohio and the sum of the people that moved to Ohio from other states and countries was 58.\nWe can replace all the sums with the notation \u03a3 as it means summation.\nAltogether, the notation \u03a3 (the sum of things) is  \u03a3 (the sum of the things that sum together). For example:\n\n\u03a3 {x1, x2, x3...} = x1 x2 x3...\n\nIn the above example \"\u03a3...\" is equal to \"x1 x2 x3....\".\n\nThe question asks us to substitute the variables that were not fixed.\n\nIn this example we will consider that:\nThe variables that were not given are x1, x2,...\nWe are given some of these variables. So substituting 88 for the fixed variable x8, we have \u03a3 (88,58,x1,x2,...).\nSince we can only substitute the variables that make sense for the math problem we have, we know that \u03a3 (58,58,", "answer": "D: acute angled"}

He decided that since he was going on a trip, that he wanted to withdraw $75 so he could spend during his trip. When he went to withdraw his money, the teller says that he made an error and gave him $220 too much money to withdraw from his account. He realized he can't return the money, so will either need to spend all his excess money or send some money back to the bank. He decides that he wants to keep $100 from his $530 of excess money, and then will keep the remaining $130 in his account. What is his total net worth after his withdrawal?\nOutput:  The man has:\n\n-  $720 available in his bank account,\n-  Excess available from bank: $530,\n-  He has $100 extra and the extra will be sent back to the bank.\n\nLet $x be the amount he sends back.

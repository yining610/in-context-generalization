Choices:  A: trash can B: honey C: bouquet of flowers D: rose garden E: field of flowers<n>Output:		B<n><n>## Explanation:<n><n>**Problem I:**<n>We can use dynamic programming for this kind of problem as follows. First we look at the cases where Tapanga has a number n or less candies.<n>If we start with Tapanga has n candies then Corey must have at least 66-n = 6 candies (because otherwise he starts from 0 and only counts 6). <n><n>If we start with Corey having 6 candies, then it is clear that Tapanga has at least 62 = 64.<n><n>So, we can conclude that for any n  we start from either having Tapanga have at least 64 candies of the total 66 or Corey start the game with at least 6 candies and Tapanga has at most 64. <n><n>For each of these two cases, we use the same approach as for the previous case with one difference. In the previous, we start our game at the first number, here we start our game at second number.<n><n><n>**Problem 2:**<n>We would use the same approach like in problem 1 where we would have a different input/output for each set of candies.<n>So the first input is "66" and the output is "29" which means both Tapanga and Core are playing this game. The first input in this case is "29" and the output is also 29, which means that they are playing the game again. <n>We have to keep going with this approach. This would be a simple dynamic programming.<n><n><n>**Question 3:**<n>We'd want to keep all the flower categories in a list along with a count of flower in each category (ie. b if we have n flower). Then we'd add each n flower to the list that has count <= b. The ones in this list will not be in the final answer.<n> 	The remaining ones would be the answer.<n> <n>### Instruction:<n><n>Input: A group of people are hiking in the mountains when they come to an abandoned house and they are split into two groups (A and B).

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute.

Choices:  A: infect B: reproduce C: mutate D: eat food E: make computer malfunction<n>Output:		C: Mutate<n><n>A virus is a piece of code. When this virus is written it mutate with every copy. Meaning when the write the code it changes it to something that is harder to detect, or it change it to make it so that it can not be detected.<n><n>### Instruction:How to write the program?<n><n>Program written in Python and Java.<n><n>### My idea:<n><n>First program is simple. You ask for number in Java program. You also get information how many candies are there. That's all the logic. <n><n>Second program get's you a few more details you need. You asked for person who have talk and how long. So now the answer can have a few more variables.  <n><n>Third program, you ask for a virus. So we need to understand how it is called virus. We need a few more data to get to answer.  <n><n>For the 1st and 2nd solution I have a logic how to read the input and calculate, with the 3rd one I decided that I will use random, because it didn't matter what answer was, it was just how many mutations virus had.<n><n>### Images:<n><n>### Programs:<n><n>### Tests:<n><n>In python test I had more problems to read and write the input. I had to make some of my own tests. Java solution I had few tests written by me self. I also used in python solution.<n><n>### Conclusion:<n><n>This task gave the best overview of how you need to divide the task in small tasks. In the beginning of the challenges it was always about logic but now I will say that these tasks, especially the last two were about understanding the problem and creating right approach to it. And that is the key for the next challenges.<n><n>

The result is the average of 7 & 1. The result is 4.5. The next number is 4 & 2 = 6. The answer is 6. The last case is  6 & 3 = 9. The answer is 9.5. Then, the result is 7 & 4 = 11. The next step is 7 & 5= 12. Finally, the result is 8 & 6 = 14. Now, we can calculate the median of the elements. Firstly, 7 + 4 = 19.5. The answer is 5. Because 19 < 19.5 < 19. The second case, 7 + 5 = 12.5. The answer to 7 is 8. Finally, 7 + 6 = 13. The answer is 7, so 7 is the median of 7 & 8 in the order.<n>

Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: 10<n><n>Input:What place would a person go to look at zebras?

This can we write as **`Tapanga has 9 more candies than Core`**.<n><n>From the question we also can deduce that `Tapanga and Core combined together have `66 candies.<n>As two numbers of 66 and  `Tapanga's candies are taken and summed, we get an output of 29.<n><n>Here is our solution to solve the problem:<n>{% highlight python%}<n>66 + 9<n>{% endhighlight %}<n><n>#### Freddy's Problem:<n>After getting to this question, I began by writing a question down: (Who calls the most at home)<n>And I decided to choose `Z` because it is a person and also to make that it makes the most sense I am calling `Z` in my problem as `Home`.<n><n>Next I wrote down another question: (Who calls the least) and I chose `A` because it is a desk and also to make that I am calling in my problem as `Their house`.<n><n>After that I noticed that there are 4 questions, and each answer can be chosen as more than once.  This means we can use them as an AND OR statement by using the `or` keyword.<n><n>So this is the final solution to solving Freddy's Problem ❤<n>{% highlight python%}'"<n>Home = Z<n>Their house = A<n><n>The place where Freddy will look at a zebra is Home OR Their house<n>{% endhighlight %}  <n><n>#### What time is Militalry Time equal to Standard Time<n>This can be solved by giving this problem the same format as the Freddy's problem.

Do not copy and paste the code from the questions to answers.<n><n>Q1. How would you describe a dynamic programming solution?<n><n>A1. Dynamic programming is a mathematical approach to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller sub-problem and then reusing previously computed solutions.<n><n>Q2. What is the difference between greedy and dynamic programming approaches?<n><n>A2. A greedy algorithm follows a local optimum approach where it takes one step at a time in a greedy manner. Dynamic Programming works on a global level and optimizes the problem as a whole where it iterates over all possible solutions and picks the best one for the end result.<n><n>Q3. What are common data structures used in dynamic programming?<n><n>A3. The most common data structures used in dyanmatic programming are arrays, linked lists, and hash tables.<n><n>Q4. Why can data structures used for dynamic programming be different than those used in greedy algorithms?<n><n>A4. As greedy algorithms follow one step at a time, there is no need for intermediate storage for their solutions whereas the subproblems in dynamic programming requires intermediate storage for all the subproblems.<n><n>Q5. The above code gives the input Tapanga and Coreys 66 candies and then subtracts Corey's candies from 66 which gives the answer 7. Here instead what would be the number of candies Tapanga has?<n><n>A5. As input is that  Tapanga and Corely have 66 candie together. Corey has 8 more candie.

A statement to initialize that variable to 1 is written. The value of bunny is then assigned 4 instead of 1.<n><n>### Question:Why is bunny equal to 4, instead of 1?<n>An "integer initialized value" is a value in the integer data type. The integer data type has a fixed size, and there are pre-defined integral constants like 1 and -1.<n>```<n>#include<iostream><n>using namespace std;<n>int main() {<n><n>int bunny=1;<n><n>bunny =15;<n>cout << bunny << endl;<n><n>return 0;<n>}<n>```<n>The "assignment operator" sets the value of a variable. For example,<n>```<n>int bunny;<n>int z=5;<n>```<n>sets bunny to carry the value of z.<n><n>### What is the output of this program? "Enter a number: "<n>```<n>int m;<n><n>m = getchar();<n><n>//cout << m << endl;<n>```<n><n>Output:Enter a number:<n><n>### How many days of the week have a name beginning with the<n>letter M?<n>```<n>int m [7];<n>int i;<n><n>for (i = 0; i < 7; i++) {<n>	m[i] = 0;<n>}  <n><n>for (i=0; i<7; i++) {  <n>    printf("%c", m[i]);<n>}<n>```<n><n>The first step is to declare our array m. Arrays in C are zero-indexed.  Because the C syntax is the same as for one-dimensional arrays, we can omit the array name and just write<n><n>cout << m[i]; when we want to print m[i].<n><n>### How old is Lyle in 2017?<n>```<n>#include <iostream><n><n>using

So the only correct answer is C (Car Crash)<n><n>It is obvious that this statement is not correct, however I won't criticize because the student was able to get 4 questions correct and it was just a fractional mistake that could be corrected in the next time.<n><n>### Question:<n>Input: What happens when a woman's brain freezes?

Number 0 represents the smallest possible number<n> * Each city's name must be found as a string in the following list: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities<n>  1. Use an element from the first half to represent the number associated with that city in the array<n>  2. For example: The string "London" represents the number 2 and "Dublin" represents the number 6.<n> * Your function should return the entire 20 element array, ordered by city, then number.<n> * Example: If given {"London", "New York", "Paris", "Brussels", "Seattle", "Stockholm"} The return should look like this: ["London", 1, "New York", 2, "Paris", 4, "Brussels", 5].<n><n>#### Example:<n>```javascript<n>let cities = [... ];<n><n>function citiesWithNumbers (data) {<n>  // your code goes here<n>}<n>```<n><n>#### Instruction<n>1.

Make sure to include a descriptive comment at the top of your file with your name, email for project feedback, and the problems you have completed and from where(the book OR this website OR etc).<n><n>### Instrucion<n>Input: Find the largest three-digit number with the digits of your birthday. For example, if this were June 11 1984, the number would be 11863. Your age, at the time this project is completed, subtracted from the number. For example, if it were June 11, 1984 and I finished this project when I reach 11 years old, the answer would be 18541. However, since I'm not 11 yet, I instead subtract the number of years to date from the answer. For example, if the number were 18543, and I finished this project on June 11,2021, my age today, I would get 74245.<n>### The final printout should be your age, 5 years older than your current age, and 5 years younger than your current age.<n>### Instructions: Use any programming language to code this. Make sure to include any descriptive comments with your name, email, and the source of problems you completed.<n>### Instruction<n>Input: Using the digits of your birth date calculate which month is on the 12th day of your month (the 1st of the month is ignored). If it is one of the months other than December, then the next largest three-digit number will have a prime factorization with your date. For example, if my birthdate were April 1962, the 12th of the month falls on April, and that happens to be prime, hence, the next highest is 2233 with a factorization of: 2, 2<n>2, 2 That's what you get if you factor 2233.<n>### Instructi on: Use any programming language.

This feels more like a language of choice/syntax question than a code quality question. I assume the code in question represents a class (or some equivalent structure) that implements the algorithms. The way multiple language answers are presented shows nothing of the structure of the C code.<n><n>Comment: C isn't really a "choice/syntax", it really is a choice. And this has no relevance with code quality, even if OP is interested in coding style.

He came up with the "salary function", a mathematical equation capable of evaluating the salary of each teacher after considering a number of variables. The formula is as follows: salary = (years teaching - 10 years teaching) x (teacher-type + 2) + experience + (salary x 4) + (salary x age) + (salary) * 3. The number 2 is always added after the teacher type, unless the teacher-type is "Assistant Principal" because there is no "Assistant Principal type" teacher, then the 2 would be added after the teacher type. For example, a Telemetry teacher has 5 years teaching, 25 years of experience, is 30 years old, and makes $50,000/year and is male. In this case, the salary would be:<n>   salary = {  (5 years teaching - 10) - + (25) + (2) + (50000 * {2,3,4}) + (500 * {3,4}) }*1<n>   <n>        511851<n><n>Output: 511850

There are some components in your body that are necessary for good health. These include proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and vitamins. Protein is composed of amino acids, which are molecules that combine together. Vitamin C helps you absorb iron into your body. Flavonoids are a type of plant chemicals that help improve the flavor of foods. Sugar helps your body maintain normal blood sugar levels. If you eat too much sugar, it will raise your levels of insulin. Excess protein and fat in your diet can lead to obesity, which increases blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and other illnesses. When you cook for yourself, you may be surprised to learn the types of meals that have these harmful ingredients. The amount of food you should make for yourself depends on what type of diet you follow. An omnivorous diet involves consuming protein, carbohydrate, fats, and fiber. Carbohydrates are composed of glucose, a sugar, and starch, which is a complex sugar. Fat helps with the absorption of vitamins and minerals and helps to make food more palatable. Sugars help to boost the flavor of food. Excess sugar can cause obesity and diabetes. Avoiding processed foods, such as pasta and fast-food, can lead to healthy diets. Processed foods are those that come prepackaged and require little preparation. Processed foods also include those that contain added sugar or fat or are high in calories. Eating balanced meals is often best served with snacks and other foods.<n>Output: A: B: C:<n>

The shorter man then said that his friends could do another type of mental math trick that his friends cannot do, but that his friends would be able to learn how to perform it very quickly. The taller man was not about to let up, and said that his friends could make up any number they wanted to, using only 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10, and would be able to do so by the end of the next year.

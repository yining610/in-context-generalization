{"text": "In computer programming, a function is a block of code that contains a set of instructions that defines how some process should work (for example, what the process does and what the process returns). Each function has a name. This name is created using some rules and a naming convention. Here are some of these rules and conventions:\n\n- Every function must have a name that is unique and not used by another function.\n- Every function name must start with a letter and a letter may not be followed by a number.\n- Every function declaration name must be followed by a pair of parentheses, followed by the function's parameters, followed by the return value (or the type of the function's return value).\n\nNow that those rules have been clarified, here is an example function declaration which will be used later. The function will take in a number (input) and perform a mathematical operation on the number (3), and the function will return a single number (output).\n\n![A function takes in an amount of data, or an input. It performs some task, or operation, on this data.](/assets/img/posts/30-data-input-and-function-results.png)\n\nIn computer programming languages, a function always returns, or yields, a single value to a caller in every single invocation.

Using the switch if seems much more efficient than what we did in class, but they were just showing us a better way of doing the task without being so specific with it. They also said they'd love to see the code we used in class, so I did that at the bottom of the document.\n\n### Addition Note\n\nIt was specified that in addition to using a switch and if/else if statements the code should be efficient and use the smallest amount of code possible. For the most part these are the same requirements as last time. Some of the code was repeated because in one of the cases of the switch statement there is a variable that is not used.

{"text": "## What I've Learned\nTo create the file for this assignment, I chose the \u201cTask\u201d category. I did this because I wanted people to be able to use as many resources and as little code as needed to solve the puzzle or task. I was surprised that there is even a category to choose from that describes how a user should interact with the app. I figured there are not a lot of coding challenges that are not solved with multiple choice questions, text fields, drop down menus, etc. I was pleased to know that my initial impression was not correct because it gives my app more of a feeling of the real world. The user is still not expected to type code, but we are giving them an opportunity to experience the coding languages in a more realistic setting.\n\n## Future Improvements\nIn the future, I see myself making improvements to each challenge in order to make it more real to the user and make the app a little more fun. I would like to add visual effects to my programs to give it a life-like appearance. It gets boring having to type commands constantly, when just a click of my finger could make something appear, then disappear.\n\n## Contributors", "answer": "A: drill"}

{"text": "```\nCORRECT!\n```\n### Input:Birds and animals of different species usually mate with others of their own kind. This usually occurs in pairs but birds may also mate in groups. All species have preferences for mating with other species they are most similar to, and this will result in a successful pairing. Mating with a more similar species, means there are fewer genetic problems for the species to overcome. If, however, the species are too different, any offspring produced will most likely have too many genetic problems that can not be overcome to continue survival. Animals also tend to prefer members of their own gender. Why, then, do we see that in some cases animals do pair and mate with other species? What makes this a problem for the animals?\n``` \nCORRECT! I know how to ask questions, it has been helpful for me knowing how to do this task.

{"text": "A is the best answer!\n\n### Explanation:\n**A: Prison**\nBen was in an accident where he killed someone. Because of his mistake he had to do jail time, and spent 8 years in prison.\n\n**B: Bridge**\nIf Ben got drunk and drove, then he could have been on the bridge. Also, he could have gotten arrested for driving drunk and went to jail. If he went to jail for 8 years, then his last year of prison time could have been due to him to being drunk and driving. If he is a drunk driver, he could have spent 8 years in jail time due to him hitting pedestrians and being drunk.\n\n**C: Locked up**\nBecause Ben was an alcoholic, the police would lock him up. He might have done something stupid so they would lock him in a room and not take care of him. Because of this, he might have been in prison before he was arrested. When he was in prison, there was no food or sleep, and he would not let him drink water, so he would get dehydrated and get heat stroke in prison. Eventually, he would lose blood and die in prison.\n\n### Exercise:\nFor each letter, write the name of the first word that comes to mind.\n\n### Response to Input:Ben was an opioid alcoholic and fell into an accident.

He reads every mystery novel written and takes time to write a review for each book. The detective uses the reviews to determine if other mystery writers have taken stories from past books or if they have copied the names of characters that he used in his stories. In addition, he uses the reviews to determine the popularity of his own stories.

The mystery novels are numbered. Second, he finds that 15 characters of the same name have been used in 8 of the mystery stories. He then lists these character names and the number of mystery books in which they are named. 8 characters have been mentioned in 2 books each, the following characters are on his list: * Bob 5 books: * Casey 4 books * Hank 2 books * Louie 1 book * Randy 2 books * Satchel 2 books * Tilly 1 book Third, Detective Dodge finds out that 50 characters share their names with those of the main characters in the mystery novels. Of these, 28 have only their first name in common. He collects the names of these characters and their corresponding number of mystery novels.

The 1st letter of alphabet  A  is always read from the starting ( 1st digit ) and the same applies for the starting point of digits of numbers.\nSo the next number on that sequence is 2nd from the starting point, which is digit D and that is 4 which is B.\nThen the 3rd from starting is 5 and that is G. \nThen last digit is 1 at last which is I.\nSo, the sequence is A, D, G, B, E, F, H, C, I, J, L.\n\n### Question \n\nWhich comes first, A or B?\n\n### Your Answer\n\nA as the 1st letter of A is the 1st alphabet after B.\n\n### Rative - \nThe rationale for my answer for the first question is that 1 is the first digit of the alphabet A.

If the remainder was 11 or higher we added the value \"5\" to the dollar amount to compensate for the cents that it cost to call internationally.\n```javascript\nconst originalNumber = input\nconst localCallRemainder = Math.mod(originalNumber,5)\nconst internationalCallRemainder = originalNumber -localCallRemainder\n\nconsole.log(originalNumber + (originalNumber > 1? \"dollars\" : \" cents\") + internationalCallRemainder + localCallRemainder > 11? localCallRemainder + 5 : localCallRemainder )\n```\n\n### Input :What has more: 37 cows or 108 pigs?\n\n### Answer :Answers one and all\nCows\n\n### Input\n\nThis problem gave us the only clue as to what the solution would contain, the word \"cows\".

{"text": "Give the answer:  E\n\n### Detailed Response: The reproductive stage of life begins with new life, which is either birth or conception. Birth and conception are both events and they both involve new life. For example, a child's birth begins a new chapter in their life, while a child is conceived which can also represent a fresh perspective on things. But this is not enough. For a reproductive stage to exist, there needs to be new life as a result of the reproduction, which means it has to be a continuation. Reproduction needs to happen to make up for dying things. Otherwise the species is dying out, instead of progressing and becoming stronger. Propagation is also involved in this. Without reproduction, life would only have one generation that dies off at once. However, propagation is not the same thing as reproducing. It only happens after the reproduction, so that the babies will have babies of their own. So the stage that we are focusing on is reproducing, which involves birth and death.

{"text": "Choose B\n\n#### Answer for part one:\nIn order to find the solution, we will need to use the following formulas to solve the problem:\n\n  * We have 3 + 4 * 66 / 2 = 102 + 5 * 10 = 156\n  * We have (3)*(102) = 306\n  * So it's (306) \u2013 (156) which gives us 150.\n\n#### Answer for Part two:\nIn order to solve the problem, we will need to apply the below logic to solve the problem: \n1.\tIf Freddy called his brother and his brother lives in a different region on the globe, it would cost more money for him to call his brother.\n2.\tThe total number of dollars he spend on calling his family on New Years Eve would be 50.\n>\tNow the logic: Since Freddy called his brother, he will be calling someone who lives in another region as he already called some people living in the same area. That means he has already covered the 5 cents per minute cost in calling local calls, thus the remaining 25 cents is to call someone who lives in another country. However, he only has 50 dollars. So, to cover 25 cents in the remaining minutes, he needs every minute to be a multiple of 50.\n\n>\tSo, the first step is to find all the multiples of 50. We know that 50 is a multiple of 4. So, if we multiply 50 and 4, we get 200. So 200 is a multiple of $50, and so is 400. So the first set of multiples of 5 cents is: 50, 400, 45, 35, 90, 300, \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad350, 305, 245, 195, 120, 90 and so on. So, since we want to cover only 25 cents cost for the remaining minutes, we just consider the multiples of 25. We know that 25 is a multiple of 3. So, 50", "answer": "A: do crossword puzzle"}

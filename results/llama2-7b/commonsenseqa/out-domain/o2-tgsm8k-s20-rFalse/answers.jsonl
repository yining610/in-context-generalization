{"text": "B\n\n## Explanation:\n\n**Problem I:**\nWe can use dynamic programming for this kind of problem as follows. First we look at the cases where Tapanga has a number n or less candies.\nIf we start with Tapanga has n candies then Corey must have at least 66-n = 6 candies (because otherwise he starts from 0 and only counts 6). \n\nIf we start with Corey having 6 candies, then it is clear that Tapanga has at least 62 = 64.\n\nSo, we can conclude that for any n  we start from either having Tapanga have at least 64 candies of the total 66 or Corey start the game with at least 6 candies and Tapanga has at most 64. \n\nFor each of these two cases, we use the same approach as for the previous case with one difference. In the previous, we start our game at the first number, here we start our game at second number.\n\n\n**Problem 2:**\nWe would use the same approach like in problem 1 where we would have a different input/output for each set of candies.\nSo the first input is \"66\" and the output is \"29\" which means both Tapanga and Core are playing this game. The first input in this case is \"29\" and the output is also 29, which means that they are playing the game again. \nWe have to keep going with this approach. This would be a simple dynamic programming.\n\n\n**Question 3:**\nWe'd want to keep all the flower categories in a list along with a count of flower in each category (ie. b if we have n flower). Then we'd add each n flower to the list that has count <= b. The ones in this list will not be in the final answer.\n \tThe remaining ones would be the answer.\n \n### Instruction:\n\nInput: A group of people are hiking in the mountains when they come to an abandoned house and they are split into two groups (A and B).

Meaning when the write the code it changes it to something that is harder to detect, or it change it to make it so that it can not be detected.\n\n### Instruction:How to write the program?\n\nProgram written in Python and Java.\n\n### My idea:\n\nFirst program is simple. You ask for number in Java program. You also get information how many candies are there. That's all the logic. \n\nSecond program get's you a few more details you need. You asked for person who have talk and how long. So now the answer can have a few more variables.  \n\nThird program, you ask for a virus. So we need to understand how it is called virus. We need a few more data to get to answer.  \n\nFor the 1st and 2nd solution I have a logic how to read the input and calculate, with the 3rd one I decided that I will use random, because it didn't matter what answer was, it was just how many mutations virus had.\n\n### Images:\n\n### Programs:\n\n### Tests:\n\nIn python test I had more problems to read and write the input. I had to make some of my own tests. Java solution I had few tests written by me self. I also used in python solution.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThis task gave the best overview of how you need to divide the task in small tasks.

How would you describe a dynamic programming solution?\n\nA1. Dynamic programming is a mathematical approach to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller sub-problem and then reusing previously computed solutions.\n\nQ2. What is the difference between greedy and dynamic programming approaches?\n\nA2. A greedy algorithm follows a local optimum approach where it takes one step at a time in a greedy manner. Dynamic Programming works on a global level and optimizes the problem as a whole where it iterates over all possible solutions and picks the best one for the end result.\n\nQ3. What are common data structures used in dynamic programming?\n\nA3. The most common data structures used in dyanmatic programming are arrays, linked lists, and hash tables.\n\nQ4. Why can data structures used for dynamic programming be different than those used in greedy algorithms?\n\nA4. As greedy algorithms follow one step at a time, there is no need for intermediate storage for their solutions whereas the subproblems in dynamic programming requires intermediate storage for all the subproblems.\n\nQ5. The above code gives the input Tapanga and Coreys 66 candies and then subtracts Corey's candies from 66 which gives the answer 7. Here instead what would be the number of candies Tapanga has?\n\nA5.

A statement to initialize that variable to 1 is written. The value of bunny is then assigned 4 instead of 1.\n\n### Question:Why is bunny equal to 4, instead of 1?\nAn \"integer initialized value\" is a value in the integer data type. The integer data type has a fixed size, and there are pre-defined integral constants like 1 and -1.\n```\n#include<iostream>\nusing namespace std;\nint main() {\n\nint bunny=1;\n\nbunny =15;\ncout << bunny << endl;\n\nreturn 0;\n}\n```\nThe \"assignment operator\" sets the value of a variable. For example,\n```\nint bunny;\nint z=5;\n```\nsets bunny to carry the value of z.\n\n### What is the output of this program? \"Enter a number: \"\n```\nint m;\n\nm = getchar();\n\n//cout << m << endl;\n```\n\nOutput:Enter a number:\n\n### How many days of the week have a name beginning with the\nletter M?\n```\nint m [7];\nint i;\n\nfor (i = 0; i < 7; i++) {\n\tm[i] = 0;\n}  \n\nfor (i=0; i<7; i++) {  \n    printf(\"%c\", m[i]);\n}\n```\n\nThe first step is to declare our array m.

Say you have the four options 1, 2, 3 and 4\n\nFirst off, how do you get through this if you have no time to do the calculations?\n\nThe first thing you should do is look at the answers. See which answer is the second-most difficult. This is going to be your first answer to cross out. You'll then look at the second most difficult answer and cross that one off. You'll continue this way until at least one option is left.\n\nLet's look at the four options we were given: The first answer is option 1. So you cross it off. The second answer may be crossed off at this time. And then you use the next one, right? \n\nNO! You continue to go through the other options one-by-one, even if one of your earlier options is gone, until you have at least one possible answer left.\n\nNow that we've crossed all of the options off that might be too difficult, we can pick one of them and solve for the answer.\n\nOne answer left.\n\n\n\n\n### How to solve for the correct answer\n\nLet's use the last question here for an example.\n\nFor this question, we were asked \"Where can you find places to eat and buy items of different kinds?\"\n\n- A: city \n- B: downtown \n- C: own house \n- D: bar \n-  E: shopping center \n\nSo, we know that shopping centers have both places to eat and places to purchase things, and thus, answer \"E\" is incorrect. \n\n\"D\" says that bars have food and places to purchase things but it doesn't have to be an actual restaurant. So answer \"D\" is incorrect.\n\nNow, we know that \"C\" is correct so we'll skip to the \"solve for an answer\" part. \n\n\n\n- Answer: C = the correct answer\n\n\t- C is the only answer that fits in these areas\n\t\n\t- So, the answer to the question is \"c\" (\"d\" may work, but \"d", "answer": "E: shopping center"}

He came up with the \"salary function\", a mathematical equation capable of evaluating the salary of each teacher after considering a number of variables. The formula is as follows: salary = (years teaching - 10 years teaching) x (teacher-type + 2) + experience + (salary x 4) + (salary x age) + (salary) * 3. The number 2 is always added after the teacher type, unless the teacher-type is \"Assistant Principal\" because there is no \"Assistant Principal type\" teacher, then the 2 would be added after the teacher type. For example, a Telemetry teacher has 5 years teaching, 25 years of experience, is 30 years old, and makes $50,000/year and is male. In this case, the salary would be:\n   salary = {  (5 years teaching - 10) - + (25) + (2) + (50000 * {2,3,4}) + (500 * {3,4}) }*1\n   \n        511851\n\nOutput: 511850", "answer": "A: look beautiful"}

There are some components in your body that are necessary for good health. These include proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and vitamins. Protein is composed of amino acids, which are molecules that combine together. Vitamin C helps you absorb iron into your body. Flavonoids are a type of plant chemicals that help improve the flavor of foods. Sugar helps your body maintain normal blood sugar levels. If you eat too much sugar, it will raise your levels of insulin. Excess protein and fat in your diet can lead to obesity, which increases blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and other illnesses. When you cook for yourself, you may be surprised to learn the types of meals that have these harmful ingredients. The amount of food you should make for yourself depends on what type of diet you follow. An omnivorous diet involves consuming protein, carbohydrate, fats, and fiber. Carbohydrates are composed of glucose, a sugar, and starch, which is a complex sugar. Fat helps with the absorption of vitamins and minerals and helps to make food more palatable. Sugars help to boost the flavor of food. Excess sugar can cause obesity and diabetes. Avoiding processed foods, such as pasta and fast-food, can lead to healthy diets. Processed foods are those that come prepackaged and require little preparation. Processed foods also include those that contain added sugar or fat or are high in calories. Eating balanced meals is often best served with snacks and other foods.\nOutput: A: B: C:", "answer": "C: injury"}

The shorter man was saying his friends had gone from a single-digit grade at birth (0) to a solid 40-something grade by the time college ended (10). The taller man was claiming his friends were nowhere near as smart as the shorter man's friends. The shorter man then began to argue that his friends could do the same mental math trick as the taller man in only three or four steps, while the taller man's friends could do the same trick in 5 or 6 steps. The taller man shot back that he had an even harder trick to perform, 7 steps, and that his friends could do it with 9, but the shorter man countered that he could do it with only 2. The taller man then suggested that the shorter man was lying, because he knew he could not do it with only three or four steps. The shorter man then said that his friends could do another type of mental math trick that his friends cannot do, but that his friends would be able to learn how to perform it very quickly. The taller man was not about to let up, and said that his friends could make up any number they wanted to, using only 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10, and would be able to do so by the end of the next year.

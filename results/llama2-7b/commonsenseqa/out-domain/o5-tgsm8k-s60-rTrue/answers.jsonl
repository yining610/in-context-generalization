Each block has letters on it. The boys are given 5 blocks with only the letters A, B and C, and the girls are given 5 blocks each with A, B and E. How many boys blocks have E?\nOutput: There is 25 blocks in total and there need to be 125 letters (25\u00d75 = 125). The boys don't get A, B or E, which means there are only 25 (7 - 4) and the girls get 5 blocks each.

Let \"p\" = \"pink flowes\" and \"y\" = \"yellow flowes\". The sum of \"p\" and \"y\" in the vase was \"10p+3y\". Let \"a\" = \"total number of flowers\":  \"5a=10p+3a\". Subtract 3 from both sides to get  \"5a=9p+3a\". Let \"x\" be the number of pink flowes. From the given information: \"x=5-a\". From the equation: \"x=9-a\". Dividing both sides by 9: \"x=-a/3\" Since the pink flowers = \"5\", x = \"5\". Hence, answer is \"B).5\"\nSo the final answer B.\n\n Input: A 50% 50% discount was taken off of a $50 item.

{"text": "There are many types of AIs (also called intelligent machines). These are categorized as either ALPHA or BOTH.\n\nAlpha AIs: Alpha AIs are machines that can reason, learn, understand, and create on their own. Some examples of Alpha AIs are: C-3PO (from Star Wars), the Terminator sent back to 1984 (as portrayed in the Terminator movies), and the human-like robots from Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927).\n\nBoth AIs: Both AIs are machines that use some type of human intelligence. These are categorized as TANSY or AGENT.\n\nTANSY AIs: TANSY AIs are machines that have very limited intelligence skills. Most often, they are programs on computers called expert systems. Because experts often rely on knowledge that can be programmed into computers, the skills of an expert are now being used as a guide for these intelligent machines.\n\nSome examples of computers that are categorized as Tany AIs are: The Expert Advisor in Microsoft Excel, expert systems that are used to help medical doctors decide how to treat their patients, and voice recognition systems that are used to identify customers when they call a business on the telephone.\n\nAGENT AIs: AGENT AIs can think, plan, learn, use abstract logic, and have common sense. AGENT AIs are intelligent agents that are able to mimic how a person thinks. AGENT AIs might be able to perform more than just one type of skill. They are smart enough to learn and think about other things besides just one skill.\n\nOne example of an AGENT AI is Apple's Siri, which is a speaker activated program on IPhones. It not only can speak, but it can also hear and understand the spoken word. If you have an IPhone, Siri is a computer program that can answer general questions about the world and even conduct some calculations for you. It works by responding to verbal commands like, What is the best movie you saw at the Oscars last year?\n\nSo the final answer would be F\n\nInput:If A and B are coprime integers, what does this mean?

B, C, and A will sit in the first class compartment of the aircraft, while D sits in the business class compartment of the plane. One third of the seats in first class and business class are empty. What is the lowest airfare of the four of you?\nOutput: A and B will pay a first class ticket fare of 2/3 * 1/10 = <<2/3*1/10=1/2>>1/2 time the first class cost. Hence, their travel expense = 2/3 * x = <<2/3x=x>>x times the cost of the first class airfare.\nC and A will pay a first class fare of 1/3 * x = <2/3x=1/x>\u00bd time the first class cost to travel, hence their travel expense = <1/3*x=x>>x time the cost of the first-class fare.\nD will pay a business class fare of 0<$2/3 * C, because one third of the seats in the business class compartments are empty.\nHence, the sum of expenses paid by A, B and D = 2/3 x + 1/3 x = <<2/03x+1/2x>>x times the first class airfare\nSince there are less C's than B's and D's, A pays less. Hence, A pays the lowest airfare of $2/03*x = <<2/0.3x=x>>2/0.3 times the first-class fare\nTherefore, the lowest fare paid by any passenger was $2/0.3 * x = <<1/0.1x=x>>x x first-class flight. So the final answer is $x\n\nInput: What does the word \"difference\" mean? Choices: B: Not equal to C: Addition and subtraction D: Equal to E: Between\nOutput: \nB: Not", "answer": "D: lose weight"}

Find the correct value of each person's sandwich count; the answers could be in any order: Amanda Ben Andrew Courtney Claire\nOutput: Amanda made 5 sandwiches; she gave 2 to Andrew; she gave another 1 to Ben; she gave 1 more to Claire, and the rest to herself. So Amanda's count = (5) + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = <<5+2+2+1+1=9>>9 sandwiches\nBen made 3 sandwiches and gave each sandwich to 2 people - to Andrew and to Courtney. So the count of sandwiches made by Ben = (3) + 2 * 2 = <<3+2*2=6>>6 sandwiches\nCourtney made 4 sandwich, so she ate 1; she shared the other 3 with Amanda; so the count of sandwich made by Courtney = (4) + 1 + 3 = <<4+1+3=8>>8 sandwiches\nAndrew made 5 sandwich and gave away 1 to Amanda.

Choices: A:9 B: 85 C: 2 D: 10 E:400\nOutput: The answer to this question is 85 because it is the highest of the other 4 choices(2 is the lowest of these). 85 is a multiple of 7, 8, and 9. And that would make it greater than 8, 14, and 13 so it can\u2019t be 9. Similarly, 85 is a factor of 40,30,9 so it can\u2019t it be 9 or 400 either. As for choice C (2), it is not a factor of 85 so it cannot be equal to 85. The smallest number that 2 is a factor of is 4, so because choice C is 2, and that is not a multiple of 85, it is greater than 85.\n\nInput: 78,84,85,98,74,71,34,24,47,105, 85, 104, 208 Choices:\n Output:  The answer is 208.

We know that, Janet has 9 more than Brenda, so we also know that Brenda has 9 less. We also know that Mara has 2x as many as Janet because we are told that she has 4x as many as Brenda. Therefore,\n\nJanet has 9+9 = 18, Brenda has 9-9 = 0 and Mara has 10x(18-9)= 36.\n\nSo, based on the given information, the number of cards that Janet, Brenda and Mara should have to have the total number of 110, 55 and 46 are 18, 0 and 36 respectively.\n\nThen Janet has 18 cards, Brenda has 36 cards and therefore Mara has 110 cards - 36 = 74 cards.\n\nThe second question was to find out the number blocks that Pete traveled by walking.

The item gets 35% of its original price back in tax savings. If a customer buys something for $15.94, how much money did the customer save?\nOutput: If a customer buys $15.95, price of an item is 35% = <<35%=0.35>>0.35 of its original price and if we divide its original price from $15.96 then it will be 15.96/0.35 = 45.464170669181\u2026\nTherefore we get the difference between price paid and original price as 45.4 - 0.35 = <<45.4-0.35=45.05>>45.05\nSo it will be $15.97 - (15.97/0.35) = <<15.97-(15.97*0.35)/35>>15.97- 4.8603016737909\u2026\nTherefore we will get $15.90 - 4.86 = <<15.19-4.86=10.33>>10.33\nSubstract amount paid - the amount saved on taxes as 10.33 - 10.34 (Price bought) = <<10.33-10.34=0.01>>$0.01\nSo the final answer for the question is 0.01$", "answer": "E: eat plants"}

{"text": "The correct answer is C deceive\n\nInput: What is 23/7 divided by 5?\nOutput: 23/7 has 3 as the remainder after division by 7. The remainder is then divided by 5 to find the quotient, with the remainder as the remainder of the previous division. 23/7 * 5 = <<23/7*5= 12+3=15>>15.\n23/7 is divided by 5 once more, because the remainder 3 is not a multiple of 5. 23/1237 = <<23/127=2>>2. As a result, 2 is the quotient and 15 is the remainder in the third division by 7 or 23/15 = <<23-15=8>>8.\nAfter dividing by 4, 8 is the answer.

How many cups of lemon juice are needed to mix with the two cups of lemon that are needed for every 10 cups of ice?\nOutput: One cup of lemonade has 1 cup of lemon juice and 7 cups of water.\nWe know from the question that the original recipe for 10 cups included 2 cups of lemon, 10 cups each of water and ice, and we are interested in the change from 16% lemon juice in 6 cups of water (before the sugar is added, when we knew the ratio of water to lemon juice) to 1% lemon juice/water after the sugar is added. \nWe need to find the amount of water in the lemonade so we can calculate the lemon juice to water ratio. First divide the total lemon juice amount by the total water amount (5 cups of lemon + 50 of water) to get 10/55 = <<10/55=1>>16 percent. Then divide 1 by 16 to convert the fraction to a decimal.\nThere are 7 cups of lemon per 6 cups of sugar, so there are (7 - 2) / (6 -2) cups sugar remaining after adding sugar. \nSo 6 cups of (lemon juice + water) = (7 / (6-2)) + (2/6) = <<7/((6-2))+2/6>>14 cups of water. \nFinally, we need to divide the entire recipe by this, and get 10 cups * 14 cups = <<10*14=140>> 140 cups.\nSo the final lemon juice ratio is 140/140 = <<140/16%>>5% lemon juice.\nSo the final ratio of lemon juice to lemonade is 1 part lemon juice, to 65 parts water (1/65).

The sum of "p" and "y" in the vase was "10p+3y". Let "a" = "total number of flowers":  "5a=10p+3a". Subtract 3 from both sides to get  "5a=9p+3a". Let "x" be the number of pink flowes. From the given information: "x=5-a". From the equation: "x=9-a". Dividing both sides by 9: "x=-a/3" Since the pink flowers = "5", x = "5".

These are categorized as TANSY or AGENT.<n><n>TANSY AIs: TANSY AIs are machines that have very limited intelligence skills. Most often, they are programs on computers called expert systems. Because experts often rely on knowledge that can be programmed into computers, the skills of an expert are now being used as a guide for these intelligent machines.<n><n>Some examples of computers that are categorized as Tany AIs are: The Expert Advisor in Microsoft Excel, expert systems that are used to help medical doctors decide how to treat their patients, and voice recognition systems that are used to identify customers when they call a business on the telephone.<n><n>AGENT AIs: AGENT AIs can think, plan, learn, use abstract logic, and have common sense. AGENT AIs are intelligent agents that are able to mimic how a person thinks. AGENT AIs might be able to perform more than just one type of skill. They are smart enough to learn and think about other things besides just one skill.<n><n>One example of an AGENT AI is Apple's Siri, which is a speaker activated program on IPhones. It not only can speak, but it can also hear and understand the spoken word. If you have an IPhone, Siri is a computer program that can answer general questions about the world and even conduct some calculations for you. It works by responding to verbal commands like, What is the best movie you saw at the Oscars last year?<n><n>So the final answer would be F<n><n>Input:If A and B are coprime integers, what does this mean?

Choices:  A: action B: demonstration C: understanding D: vote E: revolution<n>Output:		Changing society using a violent what? - Choices(A, B, C, D, E) -  Violent conflict is understood in this context as a battle between various factions, a civil war rather than, say, an uprising or revolution against the existing system. Such a civil war, or "conflict within society", will be more efficient at transforming society if it occurs on a large scale, and on a national rather than local level. There is a tendency to regard such conflicts as "irrational". The main points of the book are that such conflicts can be expected to occur, that they can have positive "unintended" consequences, and that while societies are more and more dependent on technological progress; they are becoming even more vulnerable.<n><n><n><n>Input:Which of the following groups of colors are not an example of complementary colors?

A is the best answer because it is simplified first, and 10 can be converted to 31/3 in the easiest way.<n>Input: Which of the following is the equation for the perimeter of a rectangle? Choices: A B C D E F The equation for the perimeter for a rectangle is 4(X1) + 4(X2) + 4(6) What that means is P = 4X1 + 4X2 + 4*6. It can be rewritten as P = 12+24+24 P = 60. Choices A,B,C and D are incorrect, choices E and F are not an equation at all, meaning they cannot be solved for x. A is incorrect is because it is 4(X) + 4(7). B and C are incorrect because it is 4X + 7 + 6. E and F are incorrect because you cannot remove any of the parenthesis without changing the answer. E can be solved for X to 60-24-12 = 24, but this is not what you are looking for in this question.<n>Input: The equation: x+3=6, and then solve x. Choices:<n>Output: A is the best choice, the answer is 3 not 2 or.8. The x+3 = 6 can be simplified to x = 3 because 3 + 3 is 6, and you cannot simplify

Choices: A:9 B: 85 C: 2 D: 10 E:400<n>Output: The answer to this question is 85 because it is the highest of the other 4 choices(2 is the lowest of these). 85 is a multiple of 7, 8, and 9. And that would make it greater than 8, 14, and 13 so it can’t be 9. Similarly, 85 is a factor of 40,30,9 so it can’t it be 9 or 400 either. As for choice C (2), it is not a factor of 85 so it cannot be equal to 85. The smallest number that 2 is a factor of is 4, so because choice C is 2, and that is not a multiple of 85, it is greater than 85.<n><n>Input: 78,84,85,98,74,71,34,24,47,105, 85, 104, 208 Choices:<n> Output:  The answer is 208. You subtract 74+85+71 to get 208 and the smallest of those three numbers is 74. It is greater than all the other three choices to. So the answer is 204. It is multiple of 2, 14 and 3. Since 204 is greater than choice D 208, 204 is the answer.<n><n>

Choices: A: beach breeze B: cliff top C: fishing boat D: water ripples E: moon<n>Output:  D<n><n>### Explanation:<n>The first question is to find out the number of cards that each has. We know that, Janet has 9 more than Brenda, so we also know that Brenda has 9 less. We also know that Mara has 2x as many as Janet because we are told that she has 4x as many as Brenda. Therefore,<n><n>Janet has 9+9 = 18, Brenda has 9-9 = 0 and Mara has 10x(18-9)= 36.<n><n>So, based on the given information, the number of cards that Janet, Brenda and Mara should have to have the total number of 110, 55 and 46 are 18, 0 and 36 respectively.<n><n>Then Janet has 18 cards, Brenda has 36 cards and therefore Mara has 110 cards - 36 = 74 cards.<n><n>The second question was to find out the number blocks that Pete traveled by walking. We know that the walk from his house to the garage was 5 blocks, from Gharage to the post office was x blocks which later returned back.<n><n>We'll solve it by the following equations:<n><n>x + 5 = 40, therefore x = 35 blocks.<n>So, the number of blocks Pete traveled in total is 5 + 35 = 40 blocks<n><n>The third question was used as an example of how to create a linear equation. However, it is not clear what are the given pieces of information from the data.<n><n>Let's assume that it is a multiple choice problem since there are several equations that can be constructed to find the number of white chairs in total.<n><n>The solution provided by Quora is 45, and as mentioned in the explanation section, it is unclear which equation can be used to find that value in total.<n><n>In either way, the solution

How many cups of lemon juice are needed to mix with the two cups of lemon that are needed for every 10 cups of ice?<n>Output: One cup of lemonade has 1 cup of lemon juice and 7 cups of water.<n>We know from the question that the original recipe for 10 cups included 2 cups of lemon, 10 cups each of water and ice, and we are interested in the change from 16% lemon juice in 6 cups of water (before the sugar is added, when we knew the ratio of water to lemon juice) to 1% lemon juice/water after the sugar is added. <n>We need to find the amount of water in the lemonade so we can calculate the lemon juice to water ratio. First divide the total lemon juice amount by the total water amount (5 cups of lemon + 50 of water) to get 10/55 = <<10/55=1>>16 percent. Then divide 1 by 16 to convert the fraction to a decimal.<n>There are 7 cups of lemon per 6 cups of sugar, so there are (7 - 2) / (6 -2) cups sugar remaining after adding sugar. <n>So 6 cups of (lemon juice + water) = (7 / (6-2)) + (2/6) = <<7/((6-2))+2/6>>14 cups of water. <n>Finally, we need to divide the entire recipe by this, and get 10 cups * 14 cups = <<10*14=140>> 140 cups.<n>So the final lemon juice ratio is 140/140 = <<140/16%>>5% lemon juice.<n>So the final ratio of lemon juice to lemonade is 1 part lemon juice, to 65 parts water (1/65). Which is 99 lemonade cups.<n>So you would need to make 1

Choices:  A: running B: have fun C: balls touch D: winning E: get tired<n><n>### Response:		<n>### Demontration:<n>Choices:<n>If the answer is A, there will be no balls to throw around.<n>If the answer is B, it will just be the same thing as playing without competition.<n>If the answer will be C, all the time on the field will be used only to have fun. So, it will be the same thing as B.<n>If the answer was D, there will be a competition. However, you will not be able to win, because there isn't a rival that you could beat.<n>If the answer E, it will just be a way to take rest.<n><n>### Rationales:<n><n>If the answer choices are A or B, the answer choice C and E are not valid, because it does not have anything to do with the play. Therefore, the options are A,B,E,D.<n><n>If the answer choice A is chosen, it can be ruled out, because, as stated on the options, there is none.<n>If the answer choice B is chosen, it could make sense, because it can be just the same as playing without competition. However, that also could mean that all the time on the pitch will be used to have fun, because you won't be competing. Therefore, if you make the decision, the answer should be in B, if and only if, A = false.<n><n>If the option is D, the answer is true, because you'll be competing to play with the ball, but you won't be able to win.<n><n>If the choice is E, since it does have something to do with play, it can be a valid answer.<n><n>Therefore, if A ≠ false or B ≠ false, the option should be D.<n>If B ≠ false, C ≠ false.<n><n>Therefore the final answer is C and D will be the final options.

Choices:  A: movie B: cape kennedy C: space center D: military installation E: spaceship centre<n><n>### Response:		<n>It was a vast complex. The launch pad was just one of the parts of this complex.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>A vast complex is described by the verb “was” so we know this “was” a vast complex. This verb tells us that this complex is currently not vast, it was a vast complex. Then, the question states the “launch pad” was just one part of this complex. The launch pad is a specific part of a vast complex so only it’s part was the launch pad. Now, because the launch pad is just one part of the vast complex, we know that the complex cannot be the launch pad, it is a vast complex. This leaves movie, cape kennedy, space center, military installation, and spaceship centre. Spaceship centre is out because we knew the launch pad was “just one part of the vast launch” so it is an inaccurate option to fill in the blank, so we must choose an option that isn’t spaceship centre. Military installation and cape kennedy are both military launch pads. We only know that the question means the launch pad, which is a specific part of the vast launch. Military installations and Cape kennedy don’t only mean one specific part of their respective objects. Therefore, we have to be more general. We don’t know the size or the exact location of the launch, we only know the location is Florida and that it is vast, so the one part can’t be the one of the launch complex. Therefore we know the launch complex is not a movie. It can’t be a space centre either because we know it is vast, not tiny, and vast doesn’t match up with space centre. Therefore, the launch pad is just “one part” of the vast, so it is a movie.<n>#### Movie<n>Answer: Movie<n><n>### Input 2:<n>Jenny has written 2 less messages than Shyla.

Please do not edit questions in such a way where you're trying to change the meaning of the original query. It's important to leave the question for those new to StackOverflow to find and follow up on. I would recommend either removing the instructional portion and just the problem, or leaving out the explanation entirely so that people can read and find the problem on their own.<n><n>Comment: This is an error message, which means you are probably doing something wrong with your code and the error message is telling you what it is, and that is also likely where you should fix it.<n><n>Answer: \strong{Explanation:} `The number is a string` which is a `list` containing only `int` values.

Alicia walks 3 blocks less than twice as far as Cody. How far is Cody from Janet?<n><n>### Response : 3<n><n>### Rationales : Since Janet walks 4 blocks more than twice as far Alicia.<n>Janet walks 2 blocks more than Alicia, 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4.<n>From there Alicia walks for 3 blocks less than 4 which is 4-(3)(-1=2) blocks.<n>Sum of Alicia and Janet's walk is 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6.<n>So Cody's distance from Janet is 6-3 = <<6-3=3>>3 blocks.<n><n>### Question: A man rode a bicycle at x km/hr, 1/3 the speed Pete walked. Two hours later, Pete biked at the same speed and traveled the same number of kilometers to the house as the man on a bike. How many kilometers did the man travel?<n><n>### Answer: 8 km<n><n>### Rason: When the man and Pete ride a bicycle the man travelled 2X km.<n>He travelled first 2X(x km/hr), it means he travelled 2 * x km = <<2*x=x>>x km.<n>And later on Pete rode the bicycle for 2km.<n>From it we can see that man travelled 2(x+x) km, since when two men travelled for 2Km.<n>So, man travelled 2xX km.<n>

If Beatrix has 30 books, how many books do the three have together?<n>Rationales: If Beatrix has 30 books, Alannah has 30 books + 20 books = <<30+20=50>>50 books.<n>Queen has 1/5 * 50 books = <<1/5*50=10>>10 more books than Alannah.<n>The total number of books Queen has is 50 books + 10 books = <<50+10=60>>60 books.<n>All three have 60 books + 50 books + 30 books = <<60+50+30=140>>140 books together<n>#### 140<n>Answer: 140<n><n>### Input:What is someone likely to feel after receiving a gift that is not common? Choices:  A: special B: personal C: offended D: unique E: rare<n><n>### Response:		<n>[1:A]<n><n>### Rationale:<n>The rationale could be: The sentence asks "someone _like_ (A, I, You, he, etc.) is likely to feel after receiving the gift that is _not common_, like 'a special gift' after receiving a rare gift". An adjective could change the sentence's meaning. 'D': unique. We can't say you are "unique" when we compare you to other people. The gift is the only gift it compares. So, unique cannot be the answer. 'E': rare could change the meaning since "rare" usually means the gift is only received by a "select group", but in this scenario, the most common gift would actually be "rare." So D and E cannot be the answer. There also is no word that could go in place of "not common," and there cannot be an open question. The question asks what someone is likely to feel, not what they should do. There could have been a "should" in the sentence because "should is used to give advice." "Shall" can be used to give advice (e.g. "It would be a good idea for us to leave now."). 'B'; 'C'; and 'D' cannot be the answer because, as given, they all could just use a stronger word such as 'a special gift' or a personal gift. They need only to know the gift the other person received is not common.<n>"Most" is used to give the number of people and the "percent" of people.<n><n>* 'A': special<n>  * One type of special gift is a rare gift.<n>  * "special" is not defined only or most often by its meaning in the "special gift." The word "special" is usually an adjective to indicate that something is especially good or well-loved. The other adjectives in the sentence usually give another indication that the answer (answer 'A') is special.<n>  * 'Special gift' is not one of the many common adjectives or nouns that can be used to describe the one gift or item given. The gift is the item that is being compared to all other common items and so "special" does not mean 'better than other special things.' The sentence is clear in the last couple of sentences.<n>    * 'The gift that the other person received was probably a special _thing

The happier you are by your own merits, the happier you will find others around you."<n><n>### Response:"In my life I have always had the tendency to do more things than others in my age group in school. I was always in a rush to finish my homework and projects and then be the first one in the library to read my book. I would ask my babysitter to tell me what time I was supposed to be home from practices on the baseball field and how fast I was supposed to run. I would ask my mom when she woke me up on weekends to brush my teeth and shower so I could get on the bus and play soccer or go to tennis practice. I did not have a lot of time to myself. I was always doing more than everyone else. I went to private school from Kindergarten through 8th grade. And my teachers are some of the best in the world. They are great at challenging and pushing you. But I still knew I didn't want to be there anymore. I had started at a public school my 6th grade year. I think the first thing I noticed in a public school that I had not realized before was that not everyone was on the same page as me. In private school, I was the fastest runner in the 4th grade class. In my first grade class at this new school, it was the fastest runner among the entire school. I had always taken myself too seriously before then and was always in a hurry. After that first day of school, I knew I had to take some time and actually be present in the moment. From that day forward, I have made it a big point to make sure no-one is more important than me. After that day, I tried to spend a decent amount of time alone and actually just doing nothing. I would turn off my phone, sit on the grass in the shade and just listen. I loved the feeling of having time to myself, without having to worry about making people happy. I took it as a chance to take a much needed breath before I moved on to the next thing. Being happy or at peace, in my opinion, is the best way to make other people feel happy."<n><n>### Input:'Happiness, like a road, should develop gradually.'<n><n>

If Beatrix has 30 books, how many books do the three have together?<n>Rationales: If Beatrix has 30 books, Alannah has 30 books + 20 books = <<30+20=50>>50 books.<n>Queen has 1/5 * 50 books = <<1/5*50=10>>10 more books than Alannah.<n>The total number of books Queen has is 50 books + 10 books = <<50+10=60>>60 books.<n>All three have 60 books + 50 books + 30 books = <<60+50+30=140>>140 books together<n>#### 140<n>Answer: 140<n><n>### Input:How is someone who loves their TV likely to feel about their remote? Choices:  A: attached B: nostalgic C: companionable D: likely E: close<n><n>### Response:		C: companionable<n><n>### Rationale:One can say that a person is attached to something when it is part of their every day life and they can't imagine life without it.  They won’t be able to function with it gone.  However, this is clearly not the case with a remote where one would imagine could throw it away if necessary.<n><n>Another type of relationship, one can describe as companionable, could be related to a person being happy that they found or purchased something that was useful.  This can be the case even if they knew it didn’t have to be purchased (a gift for example).    Or it could be that even if they no longer use it, they are happy/satisfied with what they have and don’t “need” more.<n><n>#### C<n><n>Answer: C<n><n><n>

You have to look at all the choices and consider all possibilities to decide which answer is the best. For example, the first thing you need to do is to find out Sam's location or where he is. Since he left his muddy shoed in the entryway, it means he is in the same building with the entryway. Next, he might be in the garden, but there is more chance that he is in the office building. In case, he is in the school, he would not leave the muddy shoes in there, because school would have shoes and sock baskets for students to store their things when they go to schools.<n><n>### References<n>https://youtu.be/9-BHoA9U2X4<n><n><n><n><n><n>

For example, if the car was worth $8,500 four months ago and currently worth $9,500, what was the original price? Do not subtract.<n><n>### Answer: The amount of money that the car was worth four  months ago is less than the current price because the price went up. Therefore, you subtract the four month price from the current price and set the result equal to 120. 120 is the original price.<n><n>#### 120<n>Answer: 8500 - 9500 = -25, then 120 = -25 = <120><n><n>### Input Where would someone find information on  organ donations?

I ordered more coffee than they had inventory for and ended up wasting a portion of it. I apologized profusely, but this is still ruining my night.

But what if we look at them more like life experiences? Would you rather never have a “bad day” again for the rest of your life but always be scared of the unknown or know that you can go through it and overcome it and be stronger for it? You can survive the bad days. You’re still alive, and that’s not something you can say for most people. You’re very lucky to be alive.<n><n>I feel that you’re letting your insecurities hold you back. In your mind, you are the problem because you’re the reason your friends are mad at you. But here’s the thing. It’s easier to look at everyone else than to look in the mirror. That’s what makes life hard.<n><n>I had a moment 10 years ago where I needed to learn the lesson, and what does that saying go? “Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.” I would never go back to that type of situation again, like you are now.<n><n>I know it’s hard. You’re not strong, at least that’s what you’ll think. The truth is, you’re human; you make mistakes and you learn and live. You can only control what happens next.<n><n>I had to write this in the first person since it’s very different in third person.

I decided to use a calculator, and I found the following questions to be very helpful for the students to review.<n><n>#Input:<n>The two most populated states in the United States are California and Texas. California has 270% of the population of Texas. How many times is California's 27 100,000 greater than Texas's 100 000?<n>#### Rationale: (6.5) I found that since California is 27 times as big as Texas, this is the number you would get when multiplying 27 times 0.1 million, which would be 0.27 million. I know that in this case, 0.1 million = 100, 000, and 0.27 millions = 270,000. Since Texas is much smaller than California, the answer makes sense.<n>#Input:<n>Rachel's 12-gallon water tank has the same volume as Alex's 4.5-gallon water bottle. The two tanks contain the same volume of water. When the tanks empty, Rachel has 35% more water than Alex. How many gallons of water are in Alex's tank when the tanks empty after Rachel fills them with water?<n>#### Rationale (6.5): I was able to figure this one out on my own, although I was a bit nervous to attempt it, just in case. Since my teacher wanted the students to solve the problem on their own, I decided to attempt it on my own. Here is how I solved this problem: I know for a fact that 12/4.5 is 2.66 times greater than 1. (I rounded the number off to 3.) I decided to do 12 times 3 to figure out how much more Rachel had than Alex. When I added those numbers together

Choices:  A: birds B: action C: butterflies D: happiness E: anxiety<n><n>### Response:		Birds do not perform pollination, but they do help in this process by transferring pollen between flowers, which assists them in reproduction. An insect, such as a bee, is more likely to pollinate. In fact, over 90% of all pollination is done by insects. Butterflies are also pollinators! They do not, however, do this by suction, like bees do, but instead they use their wings to flick pollen into the air and onto the next flower. As a result of this, their pollination isn't as efficient as bees'. Although in recent years, bird pollination has seen an increase, and it is now a major cause of pollination. Therefore, the correct response is: Bee<n><n>### Input 1:What creatures performing the pollination are loved Millions?<n>Input2: A: birds B:action C:butterflies D:happiness E:anxiety<n><n>### Input3:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n>    <n>### Response3<n>What creatures performing the pollution are loved Millions?

Choices:  A: park B: make time for C: receive instructions D: take money E: leave work<n><n>### Response:		<n>Choice A<n>Answer: park<n><n>```<n>Rationales: Since "do what they had" is code to do park.<n>The word "park" is a verb meaning to spend time in the park, as in play.<n>Therefore, the answer will be Choice A: park.<n><n>```<n><n>### Input 2:Jaime wants to find one-half of one-third of 440. He multiplies by 4 to find one-half (220) and multiplies by 3 to find one-third (150). Is his solution correct? Explain.<n><n>```<n>Since Jaime wants to find one half of one third of 440, so he multiplies by 4 and 3 respectively.<n>Therefore, his solution is correct.<n><n>```<n>Answer: <n><n>### Input3: The train was 3.8 miles behind the front locomotive when the engineer saw the light ahead. The train travels at a constant rate of 46 miles per hour. When do they reach the front locomotive<n><n>### Response3:<n>```<n>Choice A: they always leave the front locomotive.<n>Answer: 2<n>```<n><n>```<n>Rationale: If the train was 3.9 miles behind, then it will take 3.9/46 = <<3.9/43=0.086>>0.086 hours, and if they travel at a constant rate 46 miles the first hour so, the second hour will be 46/0.086 = <<46/0.86=53.505>>53.504 miles.<n><n>```<n>The third hour it will be 53.50 km, and hence the fourth hour it will be 21.75 miles, and the fifth time it will be 10.875 miles.<n>```<n>We can say they always lose the front locomotive. Hence, Choice A will be 2.<n><n>### Input4: You are playing a two-player game with a computer opponent. You go first and draw a number from the box.

This is the job of the _dreamworker_.<n><n>****<n><n>## Solution<n><n>If you were solving problems involving the number of blocks students take to/from school, it might be reasonable to assume that blocks are being covered only to the nearest whole number. Because blocks in the real world are not normally covered or traveled to the nearest whole number, we say that blocks are _covered to the nearest whole number_. For example, if it takes you 4 minutes (1/2 blocks) to get to the bus garage and 1 minute (1/2 block) to get to the post office, you walk 1.5 blocks (2/2 blocks) to the post office. The total number of blocks traveleted to the post office is then 5 blocks (3/4 blocks).<n><n>In the example shown, 25 blue chairs were covered with 3 green, 3 white, and x other chairs. The answer is that 67 chairs were actually in the room.<n><n>For example, the number of pints of coffee was initially given as 4.5 gallon. Divided evenly then the number of pints in a gallon is 0.67, rounded to 6 pints in the gallon. The answer is a little complicated and might cause problems in the real world, such as measuring coffee for a latte.<n><n>Suppose a child had 15 books, a parent gave an additional 20 books, and they have 1/5 of the 20 additional books.

If a person does not go to prison, jail time is usually where other criminals, law violators, and troublemakers go who cannot go to prison. People do not usually go to prison for very small things. For example, stealing a person's phone or breaking a person's window or car. When prison is the final decision a court makes, it can either be jail, prison, or prison camp depending on the crime.<n><n>### Input : The number of times a number must be multiplied by itself in order to get the number 90.<n>#### 5<n>Choice:  A: 0 B: 1 C: 2 D: 3 E: 5<n><n>### Response : B<n><n>### Demstration:<n>5 * 5 = <<5*5=25>>2 times, 2 times 2 = <<2*2=4>> times, 5 divided by 2 = <<5/2=2.5>>0.5 times, 2.5 * A = <<2.5*A=2.5>>2.5, then 90/10 = <<90/10=9>>9 will be the number of times a number multiplied by itself in the order that you multiply 9 numbers.<n><n>### 5<n>Input : How do you add 761 + 563?<n><n>### Response A: 1324<n><n>### Response B: 1025<n><n>### Demontraion:<n>We could use addition to get the two numbers together. 761 +563 = <<761+563=1324>>1324 is the answer.<n><n>### Answer A<n><n>### Answer B<n><n>### A)1324<n>Choice:A:  A: 1350 B: 1297 C: 1451 D: 976 E: 1519<n><n>### B)1025<n>

Penultimate is a word used to describe a word or phrase that appears just before another word or phrase that completes the sentence. A word or phrase whose meaning or function is penultimate in relation to another word or phrase and that occurs immediately before it<n>The sentence says that a person's money has used the last of them. This person is going to get broke since they have no money left.<n>#### Penultimate<n>Answer: Penultimate<n><n>## Rationales for answers:<n><n>Cards were given to both Pete and Mara. Pete started out more that Mara, which means Pete took 9 more cards. The post office is 20 blocks from the city bus station in the center of town. So, 20 blocks is 20/5 = <<20/5=4>>4 blocks which means that Pete walked 5 + 4 = <<5+4=9>>9 blocks. Thus, Pete traveled 5 blocks, 20 blocks, then 9 blocks back to his home. Since Mara was able to take 20 more cards then she started out with, and since there are actually just 12 cards in the deck of cards, then her final number of cards would be <<12*2=24>>24 less 20 = <<12*2-20=4>>4 cards.<n><n>If it takes 4.5 gallon of coffee, then 4.5/8 = <<4.5/8=.625>>0.625 gallons per thermos since there are 8 pints in a gallon we could say that 36/8 = <<36*8=50>>5 therms per 8 gallons. If Queen has 10/5 more than Allannah, then Queen has 10 + (10*1/5) = <<10+10=20>>20 more. 20/20 + 15/20 = <<20/20+15/20= 5

The tank has a removable top. If I used the removable top to hold the goldfish, then I could use the bucket to hold the bottom, meaning that the goldfish could swim up and down. If we started with an empty tank, how many gallons could I use and what would any leftover amount be?" What is the smallest possible number of gallons for the tank. I am only showing the process not the final answer<n>If our final answer is less than 1 gallon, the leftover amount must be negative, in which case it is equal to \(0.32\).<n><n><n>There were 120 gallons of water in the tank as well as the removable top of the tank. The removable top can hold at most two fish, so it is not very deep if the water level in the tank is lower than the top of the tank. Thus, there are 420 gallons in total, and the answer is that the leftover has to be positive, in which case it must be \(60.78\).<n><n>We subtracted 120 from the number of gallons in the tank, and we have obtained 280. We did not take into consideration that the bucket can hold three fish, which implies that it is not a problem, because 280 - 3*28 = 212, which is a positive number.<n>We then subtracted 212. If the answer was negative, then the answer must be \(-212\) and then subtracting this from \(212\) yields \(0\), which is not an integer.

I think that it happens more often because people confess because they're tired, tired of being tired, and tired of staying up at night worrying. It could be that they tell on themselves to get out of some kind of trouble and not because or with a guilty conscience. Although a guilty conscience does lead to confessing to crime, a person should not go to an insane asylum for it because that seems like a lot. <n><n>### Below is an instruction that asks question.

It saves lots of time and helps you avoid mistakes. This booklet will show you how to type fast.<n><n>Typing has become a necessity for nearly everyone's job. Learning to type quickly is essential to doing well in school, and even in our personal lives.<n><n>How quickly would you like to type? That depends on how you intend to use your computer. If you plan on using it for a job, it would make sense to learn on a keyboard, not on a dial. Learning with one is easier, faster, and more accurate than learning with the other. <n>In today's world, our children are exposed to computers from the earliest age. Even the simplest child knows how to find a game on the internet, or navigate through their school work. <n><n>While it's tempting to pick the keyboard with the greatest number of letters, you should use a dial, because they're much easier to use. Not only will you save time, but you won't make as many mistakes either. <n><n>One of the best ways to learn to type quickly is by setting a goal and reaching it. To improve in writing, you need to work toward a goal. <n><n>### Bulleted Board Response:<n>It is important to learn how to type quickly when using a computer. Many jobs require that the employee type long letters or emails, and taking time to learn to speed type now rather than later can save you money later. There are also several things that people can use to learn to speed type such as websites.<n><n>### How do you get more people to vote?

He was driving his motorcycle on 19th Street and had a stop sign. He was also driving his motorcycle down 6th Street. He made a left turn onto 6th Street and stopped at a red light. He waited for the green light and kept moving at a slow speed down 6th Street and then stopped at another red light. This time he waited for the green light.<n>How many times did Darius see a stop sign and make a left turn?<n>Rationales - I stopped the car for it to turn left. At this point, a stop sign was made. It is because it is the first time.<n>In the second paragraph, there is a stop sign again. Then I made a left turn. It's the second time to see a stop sign.<n>In the third paragraph, I want to go left again. I go to 6th Street I waited for the green light then I made a left turn that's the third stop sign.<n>In summary, three times I saw a stop sign and made a left turn.  <n><n>### 3<n>Answer: 3<n><n>Input: Ariel is in a class with 15 students, and she and the class split their work for a math test.

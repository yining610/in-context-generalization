When an input comes to a choice, then I want to display the answer, along with the corresponding value. In the table-based approach, I would use 3 rows, corresponding to three different answers. Each answer has two columns: label and value.\n\nI am not sure if I can use a single row (one label, many answers) but is it possible? If so, what should be the syntax?\n\nExample:\nInput: Adam bought a total of 5.5 kilograms (2.5 + 3) of nuts and 3.5 kilograms ((1 x 2.5) + 2) of dried fruits.\n\n* Adam spent a total of $93.25 (35 + 50.5) on his food purchases.\n\n## Instruction (for 1st question only)\nI think I can use 3 rows and each row has exactly two elements. The first element in each row is a set of choices. I will use one of the choices from a set as the value of the label. The 2nd element is the label value.

The nouns may be a word, or a phrase. For example, \u201ca gallon of milk is $3\u201d or \u201cfour pounds of oranges costs $13.\u201d\n\nThe second part you will be given noun pairs that consist of nouns on the left and money values on the right. For example, \u201c1.5 kg of apples costs $13\u201d or \u201c4 quarts of water cost $5.\u201d\n\nYour job is to program the computer to solve these exercises.\n\n### Instructions (Part A):\n\n* For each noun phrase that is in text form (meaning it looks like a sentence with nouns), the program should first read the text and then extract the values of the nouns. For example, \u201c$3\u201d should be a string representing an integer (a real). You may write a loop that runs through every instance of the keyword \u201ccost,\u201d \u201cprice,\u201d or \u201cvalue.\u201d You may store these values in a Python dictionary. You should also account for noun phrases that are written without a dollar sign. For each noun pair, the program should retrieve the nouns from the dictionary using the keywords \u201cprice,\u201d \u201ccost,\u201d or \u201cvalue.\u201d\n\nThe output should be the total amount. For example, if the text states that \u201cone gallon of milk is worth $3.50,\u201d the output should be $3.50.\n\n### Example\n\nWhen provided the following text: \n\nI bought 1 gallon of milk and 6 eggs for $8. 18 eggs cost $17. I ended up with 3 gallons of milk at the end.\n\nthe following output will be provided: \u201c", "answer": "D: school grade"}

{"text": "C\t\n\n## Solution:\n\nTo answer each question, use the following information:\n\nLet's first answer our first question. We know that if Adam buys 3 kilograms, then it costs him $36. If Adam buys 2.5 kilos, then it costs him 30 dollars. Now we want to add the three numbers together which will give us the final cost. You may find that it is very difficult to do this manually. This is why people use calculators. We may write this addition problem as following:\n\nAdam is going to buy $46 of nuts and $36 of fruits. $46+$36=$82.00\n\nSince you are not carrying a calculator along with you, then you may find it difficult to carry out these calculations. You need to be quick as you see there could be many more such questions in the examination and you do not want to waste time in a such a situation. Hence, we use a shortcut which is not that common. \n\nWe know that 10 = 12 and 20 = 24. Now we just add 20 and 20. Now we have 40 + 20 = 60 and we know that 2 kg costs 20. Now there are just two numbers and they add up to 60 (20). Thus we will have 60 x 2 = 120. Now we know that 10 means 10 and so 2 = 2. 110 + 200 = 310. 310 x 2.5 = 775.\n\nWe are done! You have the answer!\n\n## Author: \n[Sharanya Muthukumarasamy](https://www.instagram.com/shanukumarasamy) for [Rice](https://www.gitbook.com/book/ricech/adventures-in-rice)", "answer": "C: building"}

Its source code is accessible.\n\nCan you explain how the following code works? How could it be modified to produce a word that is not in the dictionary?\n\nOutput: Python is a programming language that is open source. That means that anyone has access to the source code, which is how it is done. In the code below, you see that a list is used, which is like a dictionary but just holds values. First, a dictionary is initialized which uses the for loop to go through each dictionary item and put it into a list. A for loop can be used in various ways, but in Python it is primarily used to do lists. The if statements used the is keyword which means that it takes a comparison and returns only if that item in the dictionary is true. The for loop starts with the number 1 and goes up to the number until it encounters the item in the list that it wants like a dictionary but also just holds the values of some dictionary item. Then you can add more items to the dictionary like this list.\n\n#4:Instruction:Answer the questions\n\nInput:I am learning different programming languages, which I am putting into a spreadsheet.

Some have been around for a long time, and some are relatively new. Java is a statically typed language that can be used in many different settings. JavaScript was invented for frontend \ndevelopment.  For backend development, we have Java-enabled frameworks such as Hibernate, Spring, and Angular. For serverless platforms, we can use 12-factor frameworks like Node.js and Python. And then we have languages that have become more popular recently like Scala and Kotlin. For example, if someone is looking for an all-in-one programming language, Scala is an ideal option due to its popularity with Java developers combined with other libraries for building scalable\napps without relying on third-party frameworks. This would include frameworks such as Akka \ncluster manager library for parallel programming and Circe \nlibrary framework 4 data processing. For other languages, there are various reasons why they might\nhave become popularized. Python was initially designed with scientific programming in mind, but now it's used for machine learning projects. Ruby on Rails  was created to make building web applications more simple, while PHP powers 90% of websites on the internet and can easily be extended \nwith its many libraries.", "answer": "A: come home"}

Logical Programers have to learn what the problem is and what logic is necessary to solve the problem then they just input the logic in the program. An important part of logic is to recognize patterns. Patterns are when something repeats or follows a certain course in a certain order.

{"text": "D\n\n### Detailed Explanation:\n\nWe see in the instructions that the user is asking us for the total cost of their purchases. The statement \"how much did his purchases [his two purchases] cost?\" in the instruction is the clue that we should multiply his two purchases together to get the total cost. The first purchase is in the range [1, \u221e) and the second purchase is in the range (3, 4). Since their purchases were from ranges that contain a sum and they are multiplied together, we can use the formula: (4 + x). To find the total cost of his purchases, the user can use the given information: \nAdam bought 3 kilogages of nuts and 6 kilogages of dried fruits.\nOne kilogage of nuts costs $4 and one kilogage of dried fruit costs 4$.\nThe total cost of the nuts will be 12 and the dried fruit will be 24. To find the total cost, we do the following: \nThe total cost of Adam's purchases is $26 because the multiplication of the numbers will yield $12 + 24 = 26.\n\nThe program should be well structured with clear instructions and logical statements.\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Dark-Aces/coderpad/blob/master/test/data%20files/Test-04.JPG\" width=\"400\">\n\n<img src='https://github.com:Dark-Aces'/ghostwriter/test/data%Ghost%20writer'files/Test-05.JPG'width=\"400\">\u200b\u200b", "answer": "E: walking out of"}

You see it as a verb, and you can think of a palette as a place that things may be laid upon. So, it makes sense that a group of things are placed on a ________ of something else.\n### Input: I think my friend is as cool as a (cucumber)\n### Response: I think my friend (is cooler than a cucumber)\nThis is a tough one because it seems strange to say, \"I think someone is cooler than something, even if that something is edible and refreshing\".

I (hid) there until the monster (left).\n### Response:I was scared so I ran so fast. I ran right to my grandma\u2019s house. I hid there until the monster left.\nThe past tense of run is I ran because it was a complete action. One way to describe how I ran is by using participles. In my response to the prompt, I used the past participle when I said, \u201cI ran right to my grandmother\u2019s house.\u201d Participles are like participles because they both start with the letter \u201cp\u201d and they both give more information about something that started and ended in the past. Participles do not say the verb you are using. They tell you about the verb. This makes participles very useful when adding to an answer because you are describing what happened.\n### Input::  I thought the spider would be on the edge of the web when", "answer": "B: night sky"}

After this you need to output 20 litre per second of water.\n3. Your efficiency for the overall task is 55% for all input materials.\n\n4. You can assume that you have one large vessel holding ~ 500 gal of each input liquid and one bottle that contains ~ 37 gallons (~ 9 gallons + 4.0 liters of concentrated HF + water) to make NaOH. A large tabletop distiller should produce the appropriate amount of water. Note that 4.0 litres = 0.9 gallons, so to make enough base you need 4.0 l/s so you can just keep using distiller. The tabletop distiller is large enough so that you can input 500 gal in one pass and output 500 gal water.\n\n### Output: 100 litres per second of water\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: Include: \n- 20 litres water \n- 85% sulfate acid\n- 85& HF\n- 85 % sodium hydroxide (NaOH)\nand \n20 litres water", "answer": "C: candle"}

In the question, it mentions that the person bought 3 kg of nuts and 30 kg of dried. From this, we understand that he has gone buying nuts and dried, the two different purchases. Thus, he bought more than one item, and thus, we know that he's going to control the computer, as it is the machine that combines items into one total.\n\nIn the second instruction, we note that the person is going to a shop that sells computer goods. We know this as the person is not looking for a computer, but is looking the the cost of airfare and hotels, which is possible to find in a computer store.\n\nIn the third instruction, we see that the person has already visited a jewellery store. From the location where she was, we understand that she has been to a shop that sights computer goods. From this, we know her to be looking for a hotel and airfare. When she has found it, she has went to a convenience store. The fourth instruction gives us the reason for this; that the person has gone on holiday, which in the USA would be a vacaction. In other countries where vac", "answer": "C: go on vacation"}

It then goes into the logic for the program to take the values that the user wants to store as variables. It then finds the greatest number (input 5 is the number of numbers that the user wants to take and should not ever take all 5, so if 5 is the number that the user wants to find the greatest number, the greatest number will take 5 numbers). It then does this for the second integer and if that integer does not equal the number 1, then the numbers are NOT the 4 numbers and then we have logic to find the greatest of the 4 numbers. If the number does equal 1, then the program finds the greatest number of the 4 variables. The program then does this again where it tries to find 3 numbers and 2 numbers and if any one of those numbers are NOT 3 then there is no way you could take all 4 numbers, so we must find the greatest number of the remaining three.

How many days were cloudy in December?\n\nDemonstration: There were10=100% of the days that it was sunny.60% is the probability that each day will be sunny, so that number is divided by 2. When you do this, you know that there are 60 sunny days. 100\u20e3 \u00f7 60\u20e3 =2.5\u20e3\n\n### Explantation:\nWe know that there were ten days that had sunlight or clouds. But the probability of clouds is 40%, so the probability is 60% / 2.5=25%. Then we must subtract that 25% from ten. 10-25 =7\n\n### Solution\uff1a C\n\n### Exlanation\n\nThere are10 days.\nAnd the probability of clouds is0.60.\nWhich means the number of cloud is :0.60*10\u20e3 =6\u20e3.\nWhich is the number of cloudy days.", "answer": "B: neat"}

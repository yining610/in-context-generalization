Then how much money did he give his brother? Choices: C: $29 B: $38 D: $60<n>Output: D<n><n>### You will need to use the following Python libraries to make your solution.<n><n>* Python<n>* Python Imaging Library (PIL)<n><n>The full code, for both part A and b, is available in the code tab above this readme.<n><n>### The first part you will be given a string of text that describes some nouns in terms of money amounts. The nouns may be a word, or a phrase. For example, “a gallon of milk is $3” or “four pounds of oranges costs $13.”<n><n>The second part you will be given noun pairs that consist of nouns on the left and money values on the right. For example, “1.5 kg of apples costs $13” or “4 quarts of water cost $5.”<n><n>Your job is to program the computer to solve these exercises.<n><n>### Instructions (Part A):<n><n>* For each noun phrase that is in text form (meaning it looks like a sentence with nouns), the program should first read the text and then extract the values of the nouns. For example, “$3” should be a string representing an integer (a real). You may write a loop that runs through every instance of the keyword “cost,” “price,” or “value.” You may store these values in a Python dictionary. You should also account for noun phrases that are written without a dollar sign. For each noun pair, the program should retrieve the nouns from the dictionary using the keywords “price,” “cost,” or “value.”<n><n>The output should be the total amount. For example, if the text states that “one gallon of milk is worth $3.50,” the output should be $3.50.<n><n>### Example<n><n>When provided the following text: <n><n>I bought 1 gallon of milk and 6 eggs for $8. 18 eggs cost $17. I ended up with 3 gallons of milk at the end.<n><n>the following output will be provided: “

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Adam bought 3 kilograms of nuts and 2.5 kilograms of dried fruits at a store. One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Output: 56<n><n>Input:An electronics store had things damaged from the rain, where should these things be stored? Choices:  A: large city B: strip mall C: building D: shopping mall E: aquarium<n>Output:		C	<n><n>## Solution:<n><n>To answer each question, use the following information:<n><n>Let's first answer our first question. We know that if Adam buys 3 kilograms, then it costs him $36. If Adam buys 2.5 kilos, then it costs him 30 dollars. Now we want to add the three numbers together which will give us the final cost. You may find that it is very difficult to do this manually. This is why people use calculators. We may write this addition problem as following:<n><n>Adam is going to buy $46 of nuts and $36 of fruits. $46+$36=$82.00<n><n>Since you are not carrying a calculator along with you, then you may find it difficult to carry out these calculations. You need to be quick as you see there could be many more such questions in the examination and you do not want to waste time in a such a situation. Hence, we use a shortcut which is not that common. <n><n>We know that 10 = 12 and 20 = 24. Now we just add 20 and 20. Now we have 40 + 20 = 60 and we know that 2 kg costs 20. Now there are just two numbers and they add up to 60 (20). Thus we will have 60 x 2 = 120. Now we know that 10 means 10 and so 2 = 2. 110 + 200 = 310. 310 x 2.5 = 775.<n><n>We are done! You have the answer!<n><n>## Author: <n>[Sharanya Muthukumarasamy](https://www.instagram.com/shanukumarasamy) for [Rice](https://www.gitbook.com/book/ricech/adventures-in-rice)<n>

Its source code is accessible.<n><n>Can you explain how the following code works? How could it be modified to produce a word that is not in the dictionary?<n><n>Output: Python is a programming language that is open source. That means that anyone has access to the source code, which is how it is done. In the code below, you see that a list is used, which is like a dictionary but just holds values. First, a dictionary is initialized which uses the for loop to go through each dictionary item and put it into a list. A for loop can be used in various ways, but in Python it is primarily used to do lists. The if statements used the is keyword which means that it takes a comparison and returns only if that item in the dictionary is true. The for loop starts with the number 1 and goes up to the number until it encounters the item in the list that it wants like a dictionary but also just holds the values of some dictionary item. Then you can add more items to the dictionary like this list.<n><n>#4:Instruction:Answer the questions<n><n>Input:I am learning different programming languages, which I am putting into a spreadsheet.

No box contains a letter. No letter belongs to any box, except box A contains an Xand box E contains an A. Only two letters appear in one box. What is the capital letter?<n>Output:<n><n>input:<n>> A and F are two cities separated by one thousand kilometers. A bus leaves A and travels at a speed of one hundred kilometers per hour, and it is 12:13. A plane leaves F and travels at a constant speed of 300 kilometers per hour. The plane is 98 minutes behind the bus. When is the next time the plane overtakes the bus?<n>> A two-digit multiple of 98 is even. A two-digit multiple is 6 times the other. Therefore, the least two-digit multiple of nine or eight is nine times the second digit of a two-digit multiple of it. The second digit of the above two-digit multiple is zero and it is not a multiple of 9. Therefore, it is one. The bus arrives in F at this time. A two-digit number is one less than a one-digit number, and it isn't a multiple of 9 either. The plane then overtakes it.<n>Output:1882<n><n>#!/bin/bash<n># @author: Liang Zhou<n># @date: 8/5/2014<n># @summary: The solution to the first example given by the editor in 2014<n><n><n>echo "Input: Adam bought 1.2 kilograms of nnuts and 1.5 kilograms dried fruits at the store. 2.1 kilograms of the nuts cost $9 each, and 2.6 kilograms of dries fruits cost $10 each.

Some have been around for a long time, and some are relatively new. Java is a statically typed language that can be used in many different settings. JavaScript was invented for frontend <n>development.  For backend development, we have Java-enabled frameworks such as Hibernate, Spring, and Angular. For serverless platforms, we can use 12-factor frameworks like Node.js and Python. And then we have languages that have become more popular recently like Scala and Kotlin. For example, if someone is looking for an all-in-one programming language, Scala is an ideal option due to its popularity with Java developers combined with other libraries for building scalable<n>apps without relying on third-party frameworks. This would include frameworks such as Akka <n>cluster manager library for parallel programming and Circe <n>library framework 4 data processing. For other languages, there are various reasons why they might<n>have become popularized. Python was initially designed with scientific programming in mind, but now it's used for machine learning projects. Ruby on Rails  was created to make building web applications more simple, while PHP powers 90% of websites on the internet and can easily be extended <n>with its many libraries.  <n>

Logical<n>Programers can usually recognize and use patterns to solve problems. Logical Programers are good at Math. Logic is how you know what is false and what is true. Logical Programers can be used in most areas they are needed. Logical Programers have to learn what the problem is and what logic is necessary to solve the problem then they just input the logic in the program. An important part of logic is to recognize patterns. Patterns are when something repeats or follows a certain course in a certain order. Good programers are logical as shown by their ability to recognize patterns, so logically they can be both logical and creative.

It also says that, "Low risk operations are profitable only if there is sufficient volume to cover the costs. One has to cover a considerable volume to make any profit out of an operation with a very low risk.'<n><n>#<n><n>In this book, there are so many problems involving the notion of risk in derivatives. Some of the problems I want to try and solve are the following:<n><n>1. How much will it cost Adam to buy 3 kilograms + 2.5 kilo of dried fruits?<n><n>2. Who is the most likely to feel sadness when other is unintentionally hurts them, according to that book?<n><n>For problems 1. and 3., there is a concept called risk, which I can't quite figure out how we can use it to solve the problems. I am also not clear about what the book says about risk and riskier trades. It says that "riskier trades give higher rewards". What does it really mean? Does it mean that there is a higher probability of being successful in the riskier trades? Or does it mean that if you do the riskier trades, the success rate could also be higher, since the riskier trades are more desperate to gain more money?<n><n>I know there are problems in this website that are related to the concepts I think that would help me with these problems. I also checked online for help but the answers there are really vague, and does not answer my questions. I would like to know what is the right approach to be taken to solve the problems I mentioned. Also, is there any formula I am missing? I'd really appreciate it if somebody could help me, thanks!<n><n>For problem 2. I was trying to find some info in the book

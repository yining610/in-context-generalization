Choices:  A: move away from B: laying in C: sweating D: movement E: walking out of<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>D<n><n>### Detailed Explanation:<n><n>We see in the instructions that the user is asking us for the total cost of their purchases. The statement "how much did his purchases [his two purchases] cost?" in the instruction is the clue that we should multiply his two purchases together to get the total cost. The first purchase is in the range [1, ∞) and the second purchase is in the range (3, 4). Since their purchases were from ranges that contain a sum and they are multiplied together, we can use the formula: (4 + x). To find the total cost of his purchases, the user can use the given information: <n>Adam bought 3 kilogages of nuts and 6 kilogages of dried fruits.<n>One kilogage of nuts costs $4 and one kilogage of dried fruit costs 4$.<n>The total cost of the nuts will be 12 and the dried fruit will be 24. To find the total cost, we do the following: <n>The total cost of Adam's purchases is $26 because the multiplication of the numbers will yield $12 + 24 = 26.<n><n>The program should be well structured with clear instructions and logical statements.<n><n><img src="https://github.com/Dark-Aces/coderpad/blob/master/test/data%20files/Test-04.JPG" width="400"><n><n><img src='https://github.com:Dark-Aces'/ghostwriter/test/data%Ghost%20writer'files/Test-05.JPG'width="400">​​

But John's car broke down in front of the office. It took 5 minutes to call his cousin Ben, who lived a little further away. He arrived in 20 minutes. 5 minutes after his arrival, there was a bus which could take him to the station in 30 minutes. It left right after another bus with people on board which took an hour to get to the station. After arriving at the station, Ben arrived 5 minutes later.

You see it as a verb, and you can think of a palette as a place that things may be laid upon. So, it makes sense that a group of things are placed on a ________ of something else.<n>### Input: I think my friend is as cool as a (cucumber)<n>### Response: I think my friend (is cooler than a cucumber)<n>This is a tough one because it seems strange to say, "I think someone is cooler than something, even if that something is edible and refreshing". It seems kind of like a fancied-up way to say something. But, it is true that things can be cooler _____.<n><n>### <n>### Input:I was scared  so I (ran) so fast.  I (ran) right to my grandma's house.  I (hid) there until the monster (left).<n>### Response:I was scared so I ran so fast. I ran right to my grandma’s house. I hid there until the monster left.<n>The past tense of run is I ran because it was a complete action. One way to describe how I ran is by using participles. In my response to the prompt, I used the past participle when I said, “I ran right to my grandmother’s house.” Participles are like participles because they both start with the letter “p” and they both give more information about something that started and ended in the past. Participles do not say the verb you are using. They tell you about the verb. This makes participles very useful when adding to an answer because you are describing what happened.<n>### Input::  I thought the spider would be on the edge of the web when

Choices:  A: practice B: dexterity C: idle time D: knowledge of music E: conductor<n><n>### Response:		Fiddling through a music<n><n>### Instructions: Please explain why your answer is correct.<n><n>### Expected Solution:Fiddling through a music is not idicent time<n><n>### Input <n>Input: A: practice B: idle time C: dexterity D: Knowledge of music<n><n>### Explanation<n>If Adam has not had enough practice for playing with the instrument, he will need at least some idle time between practices to gain dexterity. But idle time will not help the Knowledge of Music. The only option Adam can benefit from idle time to is practicing by himself, but there is no guarantee that it will improve his dexterity. That is why we pick option B: fiddling through a book is idle time.<n><n>### Detailed Solution:<n>Idle time is any time when an individual performs duties normally done by others. This person will have no duties to perform, except to think, rest, or converse.<n><n><n>### Notes:<n>* For the musician, it appears that the idle time is doing music-related activities, including compositions, transcriptions, arranging, analyzing pieces, and so on. A little bit of idle time, though, can help one dexterity when playing an instrument or composing.<n>* The idle time for a nonmusician is thinking, resting, or conversing, for it is an idle time since the individual can't do that particular type of activity normally.

To make it simple, this question can be thought of as an extension on the following problem: Create a function that will give the area of a circle with a radius of 2.<n><n>Solution:<n><n>```Swift<n>func calculateCost(weight: Float,price: Float) -> Float<n>{<n>    var result:Float = round(price * weight)<n>    return result<n>}<n>```<n><n>Your answer, if correct, is very near the solution.<n><n>### Testing:<n>Verify that your function matches that of the provided solution:<n>```Swift<n><n>//Test<n><n>var prices = [0.5,2.5,2.6,1.2]<n>let weight = 1.5<n><n>for price in prices<n>{<n>    let cost = calculateCost(price: price, weight: weight)<n>    print(cost)<n>}<n><n>```<n><n>### If Time Remains:<n>If you have time remaining on the quiz, explore the following question.<n><n>## Time Remain<n>| Question | Time Remaining |<n>|:--|:--|<n>| <Select previous question> | : |<n>| <Select next question> | : |

It is recommended that each paragraph contain two sentences at most.<n><n><n>Paragraph 2:<n><n>The answer to the above multiple choice questions is 54. If the correct answer is 58, then the correct answer is 34. This is because that question asks 13.6 grams of meat and 8.4 grams of mushroom. There are a total of 22.0 grams of meat, so 8.8 grams of meat is divided by the amount of meat in the total, 22,0 to provide the answer of 4.2 grams. So the correct answer is 97 because one gram of 95.8 grams is one gram, two grams of 97.9 grams is 22 grams, three grams of 98.8 grams is 27 grams, and the remainder in the total amount of meat is 97.9 and the overall amount of mushrooms.<n><n><n>### Task 2: Please follow the instructions presented below.<n><n>### Task two:Please follow the instructions presented below to construct an informative 3 sentence paragraph that gives a complete, factually accurate answer to the following question.<n><n>## Example instructions:<n>Write

It then goes into the logic for the program to take the values that the user wants to store as variables. It then finds the greatest number (input 5 is the number of numbers that the user wants to take and should not ever take all 5, so if 5 is the number that the user wants to find the greatest number, the greatest number will take 5 numbers). It then does this for the second integer and if that integer does not equal the number 1, then the numbers are NOT the 4 numbers and then we have logic to find the greatest of the 4 numbers. If the number does equal 1, then the program finds the greatest number of the 4 variables. The program then does this again where it tries to find 3 numbers and 2 numbers and if any one of those numbers are NOT 3 then there is no way you could take all 4 numbers, so we must find the greatest number of the remaining three.

How many days were cloudy in December?<n><n>Demonstration: There were10=100% of the days that it was sunny.60% is the probability that each day will be sunny, so that number is divided by 2. When you do this, you know that there are 60 sunny days. 100⃣ ÷ 60⃣ =2.5⃣<n><n>### Explantation:<n>We know that there were ten days that had sunlight or clouds. But the probability of clouds is 40%, so the probability is 60% / 2.5=25%. Then we must subtract that 25% from ten. 10-25 =7<n><n>### Solution： C<n><n>### Exlanation<n><n>There are10 days.<n>And the probability of clouds is0.60.<n>Which means the number of cloud is :0.60*10⃣ =6⃣.<n>Which is the number of cloudy days.<n>

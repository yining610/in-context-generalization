(e.g. \"radar\" is a palindrome, \"abcd\" is not palindrome)\n\nAn input string of 1 or 2 letters, a word or a number is a palindrome when it is the same when reversed, (e.g. if it's a word \"radar\" is the palindrome, \"darar\" is not, if the letters come in the order they would if the text is reversed).\n\nThe palindrome checker will be evaluated with the two test cases as follows.\n\nInput \t\t\t\t Palindrome? \t\t\tOutput \n\"radar\" \t\t\tYes\t\t\t\t\t\t\"Yes\" \n\"abcd\" \t\t\tNo \t\t\t\t\t  \"No\" \n\nIt will be written in Java.\n\n## Tips:\n- Use hashmap to store palindrome map.\n```Java\nstatic private HashMap<String, String> palindrome =...;\nif(... && palindrome.containsKey(palindrome))\n```\n- You do not need to use ArrayList's add function, if String has already been appended to the ArrayList, you can just use index instead, example: aList.add(\"Hello\").\n```Java\nfor (", "answer": "E: airport"}

So we want to subtract coreys number from the original candy stash and subtract the 8 candy from the difference.\n\nThus\n$$newDiff=-8 = d - 8$$\n\nNow we redo the diffrerence equation\n$$\n8 +d=66.   -> 9 +d=74 -> d = 67  -> difference is d=67 now we want newDiff so just subtract 8 from both\n$$\nnewDiff=8 - 28.9   -> 19.09 ->newDiff=19\n$$\n\nThus we now have this\n\n66 - 8 = 58(This is also part of Tapangas answer. She has 58 candies.\n \n$$\n58 + 8 = d\n$$\nWe now have $d+8= 66 and we substract 8 to get 58 once again (28.9)\n\nWe now have these things:\n\n 58 + 78 = 210\n\nThis is not the answer though. All 58 are not eaten. Tapanga only has 58. So we subtract 58 from 210 and we get 152 (58, then subtract 58 from remaining).

{"idx": 903, "text": "A\n\n\n\n\n### Approach:\n\nFirst we need to find the total number of candies: candies of Tapanga + candies of Corey = 66.\nNow, to find the difference of candies, we simply subtract the number of candies of Corey from total number of candies, here Tapanga will have 8 more candies. So, Tapanga - Corey = 6 - 29. Now, Tapanga - (Corey - Tapanga) = 6 x 29 / Tapanga. So, 6 x 27 / Tapanga = 114 x 27 / 114 = 4 = difference.\n\n\n### Output:\nTo find Candies of Corey: Tapanga (6 + 8) - Corey = 9, since Tapanga had 9 more candies.\n\n### What are the next steps:\n- We can generalize the above solution where we need to find difference between values\n- We can generalise the above solution using variables", "answer": "E: floor"}

What path will they choose? There are 2 choices in every situation described in the riddle below. You must be able to count up to the number 2 so make sure that you know all numbers that it can be written as words. \nThe first choice is to go straight.\nThe second choice is to turn right.\nThere will always be two choices, so that the person can decide which way to go.\nYou can never go forward twice.\nYou can never turn twice.\nIf a letter is used more than once with each occurence having a different number (one to nine only), these numbers will be added together to give a total for this letter.

The marbles will race in a loop. Each player throws 2 marbles from their base onto the playing field. Their marbles will race 10 times, after which the game resets and the players throw again. As they speed around the playing field the players make a game of it by changing lanes and throwing marbles in a curve. The marbles only return to their base if they are caught in a game-breaking spin at any time. Their score is based upon the number of marbles they return as a team to base as well as the number caught in their opponent\u2019s base. The players will throw one marble at a time and the game will continue until all marbles in play are caught or return safely to a marble\u2019s base (that is, 1 marble per marble). The marble with the most scores after the 20th throw will be declared the winner and take home the prize that comes with first place.\n\nI.e. a score of 5 marbles in base + 4 marbles caught is a score of 9\nFor the player in second place, a score of 9 marbles in base +1 marble caught = 10\nThe score of the 3rd place marble is 19\n\nThe score of marble #4, if it caught any other marble(s) would be 6 (score of the 4th marble, caught in the 1st or 3rd place marbles). If #4 caught nothing it would be 4.\nThe remaining marbles would be 7, 8, and 9.\n**Example**\n\nScores for both marble teams after marbles 3 and 4 are thrown:\n1st team: 5, 4, 9, + marbles 1, 4, 8, 6\n2nd team: 9, 9, + 1, 8\n\n1st place score = (5,4,9)+(4) = 18\n\n2nd place score = (9,9) +1 = 11\n\n3rd place score = (", "answer": "B: generous"}

Create a program that adds two numbers and a function to demonstrate this. To do this, you will:\n\n- Create another function, add_one that takes one number as a parameter, and returns the passed number plus 1. (Hint: use the return statement).\n- Call the add_one function\n- Create another function add_five that takes one number as parameter, and returns the number that is passed in plus 5.\n- Call the add function to perform all additions\n\nYour program should look like the following:\n```\n#include<iostream>\nusing namespace std;\nint add(int x, int y)\n{ // add function\n\treturn y+x;\n}\nvoid addPlusOne()\n{ int num;\n\tint total;\n\tcin>>num;\n\ttotal=add(num,1);\n\tcout<<\"The total is: \"<<total<<endl;\n}\nvoid main()\n{ // main function\n\tint x=4,y=111;\n\tadd_plus_one();\n}\n```\n\n### Export: What is the output when the function add_one is called with the integers 8? This example, does not include the main function.\n\n### Exc: What is the output of the program? This example does include the main program.\n\n\n\n## Exercise 16: Methods in Java\n### Instruction\nPlease complete the following code.\n\n### Add your code to main.java in the Exercises folder.\n\n### Create the variable tester, outside the method main.\n```java\n//Create new variable\nPerson myFriend;\n```\n### Add this code to main.java\n```java\n//Call the main method\n\nmy", "answer": "A: maine"}

The game is designed so that kids can enjoy the experience of being a candy.\n\n### How is the problem different from other similar problems?\nThis is a unique project in that this experience is very different from the games out there in the commercial market.\n\n### Are there any similar problems from other fields that may impact the outcome of this problem? How are they similar or different?\nOne area I think we will have to be careful in developing our game is making sure the user does not have the option to hurt or kill the candy. The target audience for our game is kids, and this is not something that realistically would make sense. As this is an interactive text based game, our target audience could be more wide-ranging - for example, an older person who may be struggling to adapt to the new digital technology will be able to be helped as they learn how to use the digital technology. The game is a teaching tool that can help people learn how to use technology, and is a way that kids can play within a safety zone.\n\n### Is this a problem that should be tackled in the context of this project?\nYes, definitely. The way in which the game was designed with text made people able to connect with the characters on a deeper level. This is important because, although we are programming a game, we are also thinking of the humans that will play and interact with it.\n\n### Does the topic or problem address learning objectives for the class?\nThere has so far been a fair amount of learning centered around Python. My classmate and I have been developing different code, but we have both had to learn how to deal with a fair amount of different tasks in the game. These tasks include building a menu system using pygame that was easy for the characters to understand, and also how to use certain commands such as.say and.talk to interact with the characters within Python.", "answer": "E: falling down"}

One for the number of words in the sentence with each vowel value and the second a total count of letters.\nWe will also use a boolean variable to store whether or not we have printed the word.\n\nFor each word in our input we want to check our boolean variable and use the counter variable for the first letter for the vowels value.\n\nIf the counter variable has the right value we will remove that vowel from the word and save the removed vowels to another array for printing. If the counter variable is wrong we we want to check our letter array if that letter is already printed and increase our boolean variable to true.\n\nFor each string vowel we will print our array to the console.", "answer": "E: town"}

This is the “source”, from which hot magma is extruded as lava.  Magma will often be very near, or beneath, the Earth’s surface and is often under great pressures.<n>Volcanoes are made up of a solid crust layer just above the magma.  This solid crust layer is called the caprock and is formed when molten rock is released above and solidified.<n>There are six types of volcanoes: Shield, Cinder, Composite, Strato, Lava Dome and Caldera volcanoes.  Shield volcanoes, named after the shape of their shields, are large cone volcanoes that have gently sloping sides and a wide summit area consisting of solidified lava.  Shield volcanos can erupt every once and awhile, but they are not usually very dangerous.<n>Cinder cones is made up of small, mounded formations called “cones”.  These conic formations are built up by pyroclastic flow and are made up of hard fragments of lava and pyroclastic rock and dust.

To see people you thought would still be friends with you d. To cry e. To drink a lot of hard alcohol.<n>Output: Since you did not list specific things your expected to see I'll assume you'd like to see people you went to high school with.  If this is the case, you probably went to school with a variety of people and now you are probably an adult and the people you were friends with are also probably adults that you no longer talk to.<n>Since the reunion should be a good time for you to have fun, you would not want to expect to cry at your reunion, see people who are not your friends, get drunk and upset, etc...<n>My guess is that after high school, people grow up and the people you were in the same grade as now have different interests, hobbies, and are all likely in different places in life than you were in high school.

How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Output: Mary added a total of 7 stickers/page * 6 pages= <<7*6=42>>42 stickers to the 6 other pages.<n>In total, Mary added 3 large stickers + 42 stickers = <<3+42=45>>45 stickers to her journal.<n>Since she started with 89 stickers, she now has 89 - 45 = <<89-45=44>>44 stickers left.<n>So the final answer is 44<n><n>Input: Zach is saving his money to buy a brand new bike that costs $100.  His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Output: If he babysits for 2 hours at $7 per hour, he will earn 2*7 = $<<2*7=14>>14<n>This week he will earn $5 allowance, $10 mowing the lawn and $14 from babysitting for a total of 5+10+14 = $<<5+10+14=29>>29<n>If we add the $29 he will earn to his $65 savings, he will have a total of 29 + 65 = $<<29+65=94>>94<n>The bike costs $100 and he will have $94 leaving $100-$94 = $<<100-94=6>>6 more that he will need to earn<n>So the final answer is 6<n><n>Input: Mark has kangaroos and goats.  Kangaroos have two legs and goats have four legs.  If he has 23 kangaroos and three times as many goats as kangaroos what is the total number of legs of all his animals?<n>Output: His kangaroos have a total of 23*2=<<23*2=46>>46 legs<n>He has 23*3=<<23*3=69>>69 goats<n>The goats have 69*4=<<69*4=276>>276 legs<n>So in total his animals have 276+46=<<276+46=322>>322 legs<n>So the final answer is 322<n><n>Input: Josh’s mom gives him $20 to go shopping at the mall. He buys a hat for $10 and a pencil for $2. Then he buys four cookies. If each cookie costs $1.25, how much money does Josh have left?<n>Output: After buying a hat, Josh has $20 - $10 = $<<20-10=10>>10<n>After buying a pencil, Josh has $10 - $2 = $<<10-2=8>>8<n>The total cost of cookies is 4 * $1.25 = $<<4*1.25=5>>5<n>After buying the cookies, Josh has $8 - $5 = $<<8-5=3>>3<n>So the final answer is 3<n><n>Input:The mother was worried about all the spills, so she bought a rug for under the what? Choices:  A: persia B: table C: living room D: house E: desk<n>Output:		Answer D<n><n>Input: A woman has 15 red apples,19 green apples,22 yellow apples and 3 blue apples. She takes the green apples and gives a red apple for each green apple that she eats. She gives the yellow apples away to people who help her. She gives the blue apples away to make people happy. Afterwards, she has 8 red apples,16 green apples,11 yellow apples and 6 blue apples. How many more green apples did she have than yellow apples?<n>Output: She has 19*3=<<19*3=57>>57 yellow apples in total, so she originally has 19 - 57 = <<19-57=38>>38 yellow apples to begin<n>After she gives away each set of apples the number of yellow apples decreases and the number of green apples increases<n><n>This means she starts off with 2 yellow apples for every 3 she has to give away(so starting at the beginning she has 38/3 = 12 green apples + 3/3 = 1 yellow apple / set of 3 green apples = 1 blue apple given away per green apple given away)<n>If you sum the numbers 12 + 1 + 1 so each time she gives away she will have 13 to begin and continue and after the 3rd green apple is given away, she will have 14 and each time she gives away all 16 green apples she starts over<n>If we sum each time she gives away the number of apples she gives away she will always have 4 extra green apples to begin with so in the end she will have 38 - 12 = <<38-12=26>><n>So the answer is 26, with 38 initial yellow apples + 16 green apple sets and blue apples given away she will have 26 remaining. <n>

Eggs that come from local farms in cartons are called "farm fresh". They have a short shelf life.  A farm carton also contains a box, but the box contains the carton. So if you don't have a farm carton, you can use a box or a different type of carton, but not a henhouse or chicken coop. A supermarket and a box are the only correct answers.<n><n>Input: When Rachel’s brother goes swimming, he wears what?

Choices:  A: pet shops B: new mexico C: white house D: arctic E: garden of eden<n>Output:		The snake is most likely to be from warm, sunny weather.<n><n><n>## Solution:<n>- We use the function str(2).split(' ') with split() as parameter that it converts the entire input string to a list of strings.<n>- Then the second argument list of the str() function splits the text string according to a delimited string and returns it as a list of string (a list).<n>- After we get a list of strings, we will use enumerate() function to convert each string in the list to a tuple of lists in which the first element is an index value (number) and the second element is the element itself. This will give us a list of tuples of indices and elements.<n>- Then we will put len(a)+1, a is the first element of the tuples, and 1 is an index for printing the number of elements in the list of tuples.<n>- The result we get is print (len(a) + 1, a) which will print the length of the list of tuples and their first elements.<n>- The length of the list is the number of elements multiplied by the first element.<n><n>- And we have to divide it by an index. We got an index by assigning i = i - 1<n>- Because we need to take the mod. We used i % num<n>- A for loop repeats while i < 0, which makes i have +1 number.<n>- a is the first element in the tuple and b is the second element in the tuple<n>- And we got the number of elements in str(i).split(' ') in the list of tupless by printing len(x) where x is the second tuple and len is len()<n>- We have to add the number of elements we got in the list of tups (element in each) by adding each number and printing it at the end for the result.

Each word is represented by a string. The string of size n can represent a number from 0 to n-1, inclusive.  You have an algorithm that changes one number to another, but it can only ever add, subtract, multiply or divide by the same number each time. Write an algorithm that finds the largest number you can reach.  You can assume that the numbers on which you can do modulo are from 0 to n.  For example, if your number is 1, the largest output is 10. If your number is 7, the largest output is also 10.<n>Output: Your number is 3<n>Output 1: Your number is 7<n>Output 2: Your number is 1,2,3,5,7<n>Output 3: Your number is 2,4,6,8<n>Output 4: Your number is 4,6,8,12<n>Input: You’re working on a 2-digit number problem and you have two variables: num1 and num2, both declared before the first line of code.

It leaks water at the rate of 4 gallons per day and there is a hose that drains 9 gallons per minute. If the tank contains one gallon of water to start, how long before the tank is empty?<n>Output: Let's do something by hand. First, convert to minutes: <n>24 hours in a day / 1 minute in an hour: <n>60 * 3600 (minutes in a day) / 1000 (number of gallons in a tank)<n>= 150900<n>And, 1 hour / 9 (gallons per minute): <n>15090 (gallons in 1 hour) / 10 (gallons per second): <n>15,009<n>And, 1509 minutes / 100: <n>150.9 (gallons to a minute)<n>= 1.6 (gallons per hour)<n>So here is the equation we can do by hand: <n>1.6 * 24 / 9 =<n>2.25<n>So we are doing well, but not exact. Our time is: 2.25 hours. <n><n>Convert 2.25 back to decimal to get the exact time:<n>2.25: 8 = 0.28125<n>And, 0.28 = 17.5 minutes. 1/4 of the day or 0.25, we are exactly here on the time: 0.25 - 24/9 = 17.6 minutes.<n>The total time to drain the tank is 17.6 * 60 = 1049.6 minutes = 17.763

If you hear testimony, you have to go somewhere to listen to or see the things you're interested in.<n>If the choice is B, then you would go somewhere.<n>If the choice you would go somewhere, it is necessary to hear something as hearing something or going to a place to see something is required by hearing something.<n>In that sense, we cannot answer choice B if we choose to hear something as we're going to hear testimony somewhere else.<n>This means that answer B cannot be selected.<n>If the choice A is what you don't do, you have to take at most C, so choice E, C and B are options you wouldn't do if your only option is A.<n>If choice D is what you don' know how to do, you have to hear testimony or go somewhere in order to go to an outdoor concert. <n>In that case, you have to have to go to any place to do something. <n>Thus you wouldn't do either A nor B if your only option is D as you have to go to somewhere to do something.  Then, the answer you would do is E.<n>So the final output is E.<n><n>Input: What did you do last weekend? Choices: A: Play soccer B: play pool C: see movies D: go camping E: go to concert <n>Output: If the answer is A, then you did play soccer and you don't have to answer the question.<n>If you didn't play soccer. you have to answer whether you did anything.<n>You wouldn't do nothing, which can only be C or D.<n>If the answer is B, then you did play pool and so you can select the remaining choices as the remaining answers.<n>If the answer isn't B, then the answer is at least C.<n>Then the answer isn't D.<n>If the final answer is C, you're asked whether you did anything else, in which case you don't do anything at most, which in terms of the question, is E.<n>So at the final choice, you have to do either E or C if you didn't play pool.<n>You have to do something no matter what answer you choose.<n>Then, the final answer is E.<n><n>#### Part 2.<n>(Multiple

The dog can walk for 10 km, but takes 18 hours to walk 1 km. How long would it take the dog to complete the 16 km trek?<n>Output: If the dog walks 10 km but takes 18/hr to walk 1 km, it means that the dog walks at 18km/hr with an hour, and at 18km per hour, it will take 8 hours to walk 5km.<n>Let's double this because the length is 16km (10*2 = 20; 5*2 = 10).<n>After walking 10km the dog walks at a rate of 18km an hour, so this means it walks at a rate 18km/hour and takes 1 hour.<n>So after 15km the dog walks, (15*18)/1 =18hrs to walk 15km and 2hours to walk 1km.<n>This means the dog walks at an average speed at 18km after 16km.<n>So, the dog would walk at 18km= 12/hr, after 8 hours the dog is at the vet.<n>So to get to the vet, the dog will require 8 hours.<n>So the final Answer is 8.<n>

Choices:  A: boot B: the desert C: loaf of bread D: foot E: hock<n>Output:		B: boot<n>In the desert cracks in the soil are often found in rock salt formations. This results in large salt deposits commonly used to make fertilizer or salt, which are known as "salt flats." Sometimes "salt flats" refers to smooth, desert surfaces that are used for racing cars to test out new vehicles.<n>The word "flats" can also be used to describe the heels of shoes, or pieces of meat on the ankle and heel of a cow's or pig's leg. In this case, the word "flat" means smooth on the inside.<n>A "boot" can be any piece of clothing that is shaped like an oblong shoe. An oblong shoe is not necessarily pointy.<n>A "foot" is the part of the body that supports a person's weight and allows for walking, running, and jumping.<n>A "hood" is the flap of material that is usually attached to the back of a person's coat or jacket. When a hood is covering a person's whole head, it is called a "hood" and not a "hoodie."<n>Aside from being the part of a person's body that holds muscles and joints, a "hock" can also refer to the joint where tendons meet bones. This joint is between the leg and the foot. In this case, a "flats" is a shoe's sole-like part, and "hooks" make reference to the holes on the underside of the shoe. In this case, that means a "hock" is a piece of clothing with a hole that is often called a "hole" on the inside of a boot or shoe.<n>

This makes the pile as tall as I am.<n>I add a yellow crayon to the pile.<n>To figure out the height of the pile after adding the yellow crayon to it.<n>I put one pile on top of another pile.  This is how I got the equation for the pile.<n>10= 1pile+1pile+1green+1pencil+1crayon.<n>I can simplify the equation to show that the new pile has 9 leaves.<n>9= 1+1+1+2+1.<n>10=8+1.<n>I am now left with 1 pile.<n>I put the pile on top of the pile from before.  This is how you can think about this problem.<n>When you put the second pile on top of any pile that will make the top pile have 1 more leaf.  There are 1 more leaf in your second pile than you started with.<n>If a pile has 10 leaves then it just means that you add 1 pile so now you have 1 one more leaf.  This is easy to work out with this problem.<n>10+1=11<n>There are 11 leaves so now there is 1 pile to solve for.<n>11=10+1=9+2<n>Since 9+2 leaves are green, and there is 1 more pile to add to the pile then you know you are in the right answer.

She could multiply the two numbers, but that might give her an answer that has lots of 0s on only one side of the two numbers. So if she multiplies the numbers, she could multiply 6 by 6, and then add that to 8. The result will be a partial product she could add to the answer. So she can work on multiplying first, then add and work to the end, not the other way around.

Choices:  A: shake hands B: own property C: pay bills D: smoke E: talk to each other<n>Output:		An adult is "usually expected to" do the same things that a child is "usually expected" to do.<n><n>For all of these items, "adult people" are expected to do them, and children are also expected to do them, so we can eliminate choices A, C, and D. We also cannot say "Both A and C", "Neither A nor C", or "Neither A nor B", so we can be certain that "B" must appear in the answer. We can also be certain that "A" appears in the answer, and "E" must not appear in the answer, since "talk" does not dovetail with "smoke". However, "shake hands" is ambiguous, because it could be construed as an adult gesture, although it is more common for children to shake hands than other adults. Similarly, "own property" is ambiguous, as it could be construed both as being owned by a child and used by an adult. To be sure, we could say "Shake hands" is an adult activity "usually expected", and "owned property" is a child activity "usually expected". In addition, if a child can own property, an adult can also shake hands. Hence we can say "Neither C nor E" as the answer ("C" is in the answer and "E" is not).<n>If your answer was:<n>B:Neither A nor C nor E<n>your answer is correct.<n>

For 6 and 8, you asked specifically for the value from the output variable so those were easier.  You could've said the same for 2 and 4, but you had more information to get from the value of the output.  For each output statement you had this format:  [something added to] [something divided by/plus something multiplied by] (something) but that wasn't always the case.  7 was one of those challenging ones because it had too much information for you to work with like the 42 and 44 from the equation.  And at the end, you add 29 to $65 which could be anything.  But it's 65 because you have the output from 6 as your starting place and that's how you know.<n><n>## Step 2: Sequence Steps - 6 and 8<n>For the instructions on the input you had 6/7/8 then one of these statements:<n><n>* 1. Take the first value in your output variable and plug that into that statement.<n>* 2. Work with that number as the next variable<n>* 3. Do this for every other number in the output variable.  (you may have a variable that was 0)<n>* 4. If your output variable has no values (in which you may have had the default) just end the sequence and write the final answer.<n><n>## Step5: Code (really, no code below this point!)<n>You do not need code here yet.<n><n>## Step6: Submit Your Program (and any issues that show up)<n>You'll see each instruction multiple times on different forms which will appear after each time you run your program - you will only need to make a change if it shows up in your test program.<n><n>## Step7: Review Program Output<n>You will see the following for each step on your test program:<n>* Step name<n>* Input/

For 3 as an example 3!

Choices:  A: wedding B: tennis C: closet D: left foot E: house<n>Output:		The sentence gives very few clues as to how to interpret the question, but I believe the answer is 'C' and 'E'.<n>First, consider A.  There is a wedding dress, but we want a white shoe to match a white dress, not a white dress itself.  Similarly, an all-white shoe does not go with tennis.  This leaves C and E as the only two options.  If the shoe is white, however, the clues seem to indicate that it can be either worn on the left foot or in the house.  The same does not seem true if it is black. Thus, the answer is C and E.<n><n>IMPORTANT NOTE:<n>The answers provided by the other competitors were very different, and none of them got the question quite right.

Choices:  A: sickness B: motion sickness C: relocation D: jet lag E: fatigue<n>Output:		After a long day of travel, most people experience either motion sickness or fatigue.<n>If they are experiencing fatigue, they are tired, so A does not describe the result of long travel. Fatigue most often results in sleepiness, not the sickness of motion sickness. Therefore, if motion sickness is not selected, F is the answer.<n>Fatigue also does not describe relocation, as relocation does not only require time away from home, but a change of residence as well.<n>After a long day of relocation, the result is jet lag. <n><n>Since motion sickness is not a choice, motion sickness is not an alternate possible answer.<n>Motion sickness and jet lag are both possible results of a long day of travel. Given that the correct answer must be an alternate to one of the choices that is not a choice, A is the only possible answer.<n>Therefore A is the correct answer.<n><n>Input:  The question: How many of the letters A, B, C, and D, are in the word "MATHEMATICS"?<n>A: 6<n>B: 4<n>C: 9<n>D: 7<n>Output:<n>The word MATHEMATICS has 28 letters,<n>which is divided into groups of letters equal to 2, 1, 8<n><n>Group One: A, B Group Two: D, E Group Three: C, F, G, G, H, I, N<n>Therefore, the answer to this quesiton is D<n><n>Input:What does J mean?<n>A: Janitor<n>B: Jack<n>C: Judy<n>D: Jamie<n>Output:The letters J and A can be rewrittne as J and A.<n>Since letters J and A can both be rewritten as J, J is the correct answer<n><n>Input:What letter does J stand for on an American airplane?<n>A: Jack<n>B: Jeep<n>C: Joann<n>D: Joe<n>E: John<n>Output:J, on an American airplane stands for Jackson.<n>J.K., on an American airplane does not stand for Jackson, so J is the correct answer.

They can be trained to sit or stay or even cower on command. The owner of the dog must know how to give commands to the dog. The owner also has to remember that when he is teaching the dog, he must treat the dog with respect and should be gentle and kind so the dog will learn that the owner is a respectable person. So if the owner is a respectful person the dog will also be a respectful dog.<n>Feed : Feeding dogs is not only important for the food and nutrient needs of the dog, but also to provide the opportunity to take a break from excitement, activity, and frustration. Dogs love to eat, so they can take their food very seriously! This is very similar to human behavior. You'll eat all you can, and when a delicious dish is served, you'll eat all you want. But in an exciting state, we may easily lose our appetite. This is related to the fact that dogs are very similar to humans in terms of character.<n>Glee : Happy, joyful and joyful.<n>Sadness : A sad event may come at any time. Some people experience sadness as a feeling of unhappiness. It may look like sadness but it could be a sense of loss.<n>Regret : It means to blame for the event that has occurred. People may regret losing valuable wealth or causing damage to oneself and others. Even if they lose their lives, they regret it. It also means to regret the past. Regrets can be caused by our own inability to do something.<n>Despair : It's a difficult thing. Despair gives a sense of confusion and helplessness. The most important factor causing regret is our inability to prevent a situation or event from occurring.

Choices:  A: graph B: bank at noon C: good book D: post office E: bus stop<n>Output:		Since you need a coat to stand in a line, we can assume that we are looking at a line for some reason.  At a store, a common thing that one would find a line is at the cash register to checkout.  A cash register is an electronic device that keeps track of money exchanged at a store.  It is the same as a bank.  The coat that you get from a bank is used to guard against the cold.  We know that if we get a coat from the bank, we will also be getting money from the bank since we didn't specify otherwise.  The post office often has an area outside where people wait to collect their mail, we could then assume with more clarity that we are talking about a mail delivery place.  A bus is a form of transportation, that isn't exactly a warm thing since it is essentially a moving, metal cage.  Therefore it is unlikely that we want a coat from a bus stop.  In many places, the post office, bank, and bus stop are sometimes right next to or within each other.  We will not get a coat from a bus if we are at a bus stop, since that would make us a person who only walks around and does not take transit.

She used the data from the class to determine what?<n>Output: We know that there were 40 students in the class.<n>Every other student gave her an item on odd days.<n>Every other student does not give her an item on even days.<n>Since 25 of the students gave her an item on the odd days.  The number of items she received on odd days is 25.  Therefore, 25 is the number of items that were given to her on odd days.<n>Similarly, we can find the number of items she received every other day i.e. every other day she receives an item from x number of students.<n>All items for x number of students are grouped together, the sum of the given items for odd days, even days, and all the even day events from each group are used to find the average of each group.<n>As the number of students she received an item from is the same as the number of students she does not receive an item from.<n>So, as the number of odd days in any sequence is always equal to the even number of days, therefore, her average is equal to 50.<n>Therefore, as the number of given items on odd days are 25 and the number of total items is 40, the average number of items she gets on different days are 40/2 = 20, therefore, if she receives an average of 20 items on odd-days, therefore, even days she must receive 50 i.e. the sum of items received on odd days + items received on even days = 20 + 50 = 70.

His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Output: If he babysits for 2 hours at $7 per hour, he will earn 2*7 = $<<2*7=14>>14<n>This week he will earn $5 allowance, $10 mowing the lawn and $14 from babysitting for a total of 5+10+14 = $<<5+10+14=29>>29<n>If we add the $29 he will earn to his $65 savings, he will have a total of 29 + 65 = $<<29+65=94>>94<n>The bike costs $100 and he will have $94 leaving $100-$94 = $<<100-94=6>>6 more that he will need to earn<n>So the final answer is 6<n><n>Input: Mark has kangaroos and goats.

Human eye color is inherited from the genes of the parents. The gene is called "eye color". If one parent has brown eyes and the other has blue eyes, what is the chance of each child having brown eyes? Choices: brown blue 0.025 0.500 0.250 0.238 0.050<n>Output: Brown is dominant over blue, so a child must have two alleles (i.e., one brown and one blue) to have blue eyes. A dominant allele will overpower one recessive allele, so each person has a 23.8% probability of having blue eyes if one parent has blue eyes. Since brown is dominant and blue is recessive, brown has an overall probability of 0.975 and blue has a probability of 0.026. (This question requires the same answer choices as Exercise 2.)<n>

The first number is  1.  The second number is 2, the third number is 3, the  4th number is 4, and so on until the 9th number is 9, and  the 10th number is 10.  You need to  find one number (between 1 and 10) in the sequence   that  adds up to 5500.  Choices:  A) 14 B) 15 C) 7 D) 19 E) 27 <n>Output:  14=1+14*9*3*2   15=1+15*9*3*4 19=1+19*9*3*5 27=1+27*9*3*7<n>Because in the problem there is a sequence of numbers up to 10, 14  and  19   would not work because 14  and 15  are the same and 19  and 27 are the same.<n>We can't use 14 and 19 because they are the same and we have to use each   number just one time.

Son and girlfriend each eat the same amount of pancakes for breakfast.  Mom makes 192 pancakes for breakfast, which costs $0.03/pancake.  Each pancake has 9 milliliter of syrup in it. Dad has one glass of lemonade and makes 34 glasses of lemonade for dinner.  How much does dad spend on syrup?<n>Output: Dad has 9 milliliters of syrup per pancake; Mom has 9 millilters of syrup per pancalke. He made 34 pancakes and 25 glasses of lemonades. This means that the lemonades had 9 more milliliters than the pancakes each. So Dad made the extra 9/100,000 pancakes to have the extra nine milliliters of each. If he bought all of the lemonade from the store it would have costed $25 * 9/0.03 = $<<>>$0.75 more.

Choices:  Letters: A: apple B: banana C: cat D: dog E: elephant F: flower G: gram H: hour I: ink J: jelly K: Key L: lemon M: motor, N: No P: Pencil Q: quilts R: rooster S: sand T: train U: uncle V: vacuum <n>Output: The answer is "n". The letter in our alphabet with the most letters to its left is "n." There is a vowel after the "n" but it is not an "e" because it is not the last letter of every word.<n>A letter with a "y" after the "n" will not fit because the words that have "y" at the end also have "y" before "n." A letter with an "l" after the "n," won't work either because the letters that start with an "l", do not end in "n." The only other remaining possibility is "m." There is a reason for this: "m" fits every word that starts with a vowel and is followed by any of the letters "n" or "t."<n><n>

Choices:  A: country B: trouble C: city D: sun E: control<n>Output:		The government seeks control over its people.<n><n>### Instruction 2<n>How did I go about solving #2?  I got the answer to be: "A country is an imaginary place, a city is a physical place with people living there, so city is not the right answer.  Sun is not the answer.  If you do something over a person, they are the object of that thing.  Therefore the answer is Control."<n><n>### Instructions 3<n>For Instructions three and four I used my knowledge of algebra to solve it.  This is what I said: "In the equation 1x + 2x, the variables are x's.  1x is 1 * x, this means x is 1.  2x also 1 * x equals x when put into the equation.  5x = x for any given variable x which this x is the value for x.  Thus 1x + 4x + 3 - 5x = 2x."<n><n><n>### Instuctions 4<n>I used my knowledge of variables to solve: "The variable x is a value. 3x is 3 * x and so 3 is x.  2/x = 2 / number of variables. 6/x is 6/ number of variables * variable.  Then 2/x + 6/x = 2/x +6/(1x) (x is in both) = 8/x = 8/1 x which is the value 8.  <n><n>### Instructinons 5<n>I had to use my understanding of math and the concepts of variable to solve it.  In order to solve it I first had to figure out what the question was asking: "We are told there are 12 students from a specific math class. It is asked: 'What is the largest number of girls in the class?'"  <n>"The number of girls = x.  If that is the case then 12 = 12x. 12 can't go into x (if you divide, you don't get a remainder).  The only thing that can go into 12 if x's are all equal is each number that has an x has to multiply it by 12. 12 * x = 12x which is the case if x

Choices:  A: house B: fast food restaurant C: library D: conference E: paper<n>Output:		All the answers provided are correct. But it does not matter much which one you choose.<n><n>*A* house => This question is very tricky. Because it might suggest that you should look at the food-item you have to eat and the table you sit at. A table is part of a house, so if the question was 'where can you purchase food and have a table', the question would have been easy. But because you're asked where you can purchase AND eat food, you should ignore the table you sit at and think about things like: What's the definition of 'eating food' when it is asked 'where do you eat food', and what's the definition of purchasing food when it is asked 'what do you purchase when you want to purchase food',...<n><n>*B* fast food restaurant => This question is similar to the previous one. But the answer choice 'fast food restaurant' suggests that you might want to ignore that you can have food on a table if you want to. Because you can always purchase and eat food on your couch at home.<n><n>*C* library => Like the previous answer choice, this answer choice does not really provide the complete answer (as it doesn't really matter if you have a table or not). A library is just one of many possibilities where you can eat food.<n><n>*D* conference => The answer choice 'conference' will only work under the assumption that a conference is something you eat. But most conferences, like the one you want to apply for, are probably not eaten by the applicants, so the question will probably not be about a conference. And even if it would, you still need to think about a lot more details to answer the question correctly. That is: 'How can I eat at a conference and who am I allowed to eat with'. <n><n>*E* paper => The answer choice paper is the most straightforward choice here. Even though you might not think of a conference where food is eaten as a 'paper'. But that's what the question is about: 'Where do you purchase food and eat at tables?'<n><n>Input: Which number is closest to 2005?<n>Output: The answer choices are all correct.

What might the cops do to him? Choices:  A: going to jail B: going to prison C: beat him up D: get arrested E: die<n><n>### Response:		<n>Choice "A" and "E" don't fit because Jim killing people did not result in him going to jail or prison. Choice "A" and "B" don't fit either because Jim enjoys killing people. The cops could have "beat him up" but this would not make Jim enjoy it more.<n><n>### Choice:<n>Choice "D"<n><n>### Explanation "D":<n>The cops did get arrested because he enjoyed killing people because then Jim can beat his captors up.<n><n>### Output:<n>In this context Jim beat people up that were captured.

The average speed of a squirmel is 30 mph and the average person can only go 15 mph (Source: [here (2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_personal_record_list))<n>### The result is 0:30 mph, where 0 is the time taken to go the distance traveled and.30 represents the speed of 15 mph<n><n>#### 0:30<n>Answer: 0:30

Choices:  A: look beautiful B: be happy C: change quickly D: occur here E: surprise us<n><n>### Response:		D -  Weather can either occur naturally or be brought on at a certain time, it can't be changed or surprised so C can be ruled out. If we use A, that makes happy to be a synonym. We can't say that to be here is the same as to change here or to surprise here. So the only ways that B or E can't be used is if to be happy means to be at paradise, which we don't know, and when to change happens. A, B, and E are eliminated.  Now D or E could both be used as synonyms for occurring. Only one would be right. For D, the synonym would be brought on because it can't be synonymous with happened. For E, a synonym would be to surprise because it hasn't been eliminated as part of B. D and E can only be synonymous if they are all different, so we can cross those out, as well.  We can rule out the synonym of brought on of changed because they aren't synonyms and we can still cross out the synonym of surprise for happy because only one can be correct. A can be ruled out because it doesn't make sense.  B is the answer because it is the only one left since happiness occurs and weather can be brought on if they knew that it would be at paradise. <n>####  E<n>Answer:  E -  Surprise<n><n>### Instructions:Analyze the passage below.<n><n>###  Analysis:I really liked the book that my friend made.

By the time he reaches the age of 18 years old, Bill Gates had already developed his first software program and was already earning money. 5 years later, Mr. Gates had formed Microsoft Corporation with his friend Paul Allen. Microsoft now runs the Windows operating systems and the software that runs on them. Microsoft also makes computers for all kinds of people around the world.<n><n>### 💬 Writing<n>### Summary:<n>What is the passage about?<n>In this passage, a writer named John describes a news story. The title is "Bill Gates : The World's Leading Businessman". The writer gives us a brief outline of Bill Gates' life. The writer talks about his start-up at age 18. The article mainly describes how hard of a worker the man is, the founder of the company Microsoft which today is one of the most successful companies in the world, and the founder of the Gates foundation which does a lot of charity work.<n><n>### Opinion<n>What is your opinion of this passage?<n>I have always heard of this legendary man.

Maleko could hear it vibrating evenly in the wood floor and the walls of his house. Even though this happened the drums did not hit the floor and the walls made vibrations, what does this describe? HINT: Think about how a stringed instrument creates sound.<n>If a musician plucks a string on an instrument, it's vibrating will cause a sound to reverberate. Similarly, if a band is playing, and the sounds traveling through the air to your ears reach a solid surface (like the floor), they will bounce back to your ear. What we're describing is called reflective sound.<n><n>### Rationales Answer:If a musician plunks a string on an instrument it's vibrations will cause a sound to travel. Just as sound from a musician travels in air and can then hit an object and bounce back to your ears.<n><n>#### 1<n>Answer: 1<n><n>### Input : Choices: 		What is it when you cannot tell if something is in your own point of view?

This is because the answer consists of either one thing, two things, or three things - so that's the question we're answering.<n><n>### Response<n>The correct response is A.<n><n>### Justification:<n>The answer to this question is always three of the items on the bottom. A yard is a space between different places in a city, and a subdivision is a space of land with different areas. Therefore, it is a space between different areas, and the answer is that a yard is not a subdivision.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>A yard is made up by three things, but a yard is not a space. It is a three point space in the middle where two other spaces meet. So the answer is a space between different spaces. That is a subdivision, and not a yard.<n><n>### Rationale:<n>As long as you recognize that the options are always three of the options on the bottom, and you take note of the space/thing distinction, you are guaranteed to complete the questions correctly.<n><n>```python<n>if (choice == 3):<n>    chef = [choice]<n>else:<n>    chef = [choices]<n>print(chef)<n>```<n>```<n>Output:<n>['A', 'M', 'M']<n><n>```<n><n>### Input<n><n>### Demonsration<n><n>### Answer<n><n>### Justitfication:<n>

They will only lower the price of products that they produce more than they do.<n>- Taxes increase the price of the products that consumers need the most causing inflation. Taxes decrease the demand of a country's products, which causes consumers to buy more imports from other countries.(https://sites.google.com/view/finance-journal-11/economics/fighting-inflation)<n><n><n>

This question requires more context for us to decide if the kids were having fun all day. Was this for a few hours, for a few days, or for a few weeks? This leads to a few more questions:<n><n>How many kids did they see? Do they have different ages? Did they just see the same 3-6 kids? How big was the area where they were playing?<n>The context needs to tell us these things in order to properly place this question in the time continuum. This will allow us to decide if the wild ride was before or after the fun, or if it’s an ongoing problematic situation.<n><n>If each kid saw a fun wild ride, but some had a fun wild ride more often than others, then the wild ride could occur after the fun.<n><n>If one or two of the kids had a fun wild ride and the others saw no fun wild ride at all, we would infer the first kids saw a fun wild ride before the rest.<n><n>### Input<n>The kids had been playing all day and a massive bear appeared and attacked them. <n><n>### Rationales:  <n><n>### D: The context of the question does not provide enough information, and therefore, we cannot accurately answer.

We also do not know how much time they played.<n><n>The answer of choice D is that they played marbles.  <n>However, there were six  marbles and no balls. Since the context did not

The floor has stock traders.  Candidates will complete an online test and/or a written exam.  Stock traders and candidates cannot use computers during an exam  This is because it takes away from the focus of the trading floor.  The traders also have to memorize formulas due to the large volume of trading information they see each day.   Trading floors have windows that look out onto hallways.  Traders on the floor look out to the hallway when they need to wait for their boss or when they need to attend to matters that have nothing to do with the stock exchange.

You are close! However, to cancel, we need to use the Distributive Property:  A*B+C = A*(B+C)<n>-8*2 -8 (the number in the top of the brackets is what will cancel, in this case 8) = -8*(3+2)<n>-8*3 -24= -8*(-3)<n>8=(8*(-3))/=8(-3)<n>8/(-3)=8/3=-2<n>So, multiply each side by -2<n>#### -8*(-2)<n>Answer: -8=-8*(-2)

Beth bought 2 shirts for herself and her friends at the rock concert.  Each shirt costs $39.50.  How much money do the tickets and the shirts cost?<n>Rationale: The tickets cost 53.25, not including the money to the shirts.  Because this was from her mother’s credit this money must have been deducted for the tickets also.  We can find the tickets cost by subtracting the money on the credit card from the total cost.  We can then subtract each shirts cost from Beth’s remaining money to find the total cost.<n><n>#### 12<n>Answer: $12<n><n>### InputZach and his brother Sam like to play

Choices:  A: cars B: city street C: street corner D: fork in road E: at a red light<n><n>### Response:		The answer is 'Where are people likely to stop at an intersection'. A car will be at the red light. The reason is that a road splits in two and the traffic is allowed to move forward at the same time in each direction. The people will be standing where they stopped<n>### Rationales:Because of this reason and the fact that the intersection turns to a city street at the middle, people are more likely to stand.<n><n>### Input 'a': The temperature was increasing ____.<n>Choice: 'A': every day, B.: every year, C: every month, D: every minute.<n><n>### Response:'B': the temperature was increasing every year.

This is because every year is also a yearly period, a monthly period, and a daily period.<n><n>### Example : The temperature is always increasing with passing years and days(months), so it will increase every year<n><n>### Input :The cost of a shirt increases ______ the more a shirt is bought. Choices : A: the bigger, B: the better, C: the more, D: the worst<n><n>### Response : The correct answer is 'The more a shirt is purchased.' This is because the price of shirts will definitely increase as their amount increases.<n>### Rational:<n>As we already known, increasing of price is not a bad thing, it is just happening because of the increase of shirts been purchased.  <n>Hence, in this case shirts purchase can be stated as, "The more a shirt be purchased, the higher the price"<n><n>### Example:<n>I bought a T-shirt. The price of that shirt is S$20. <n>If I buy 2 shirts together, the price of the shirts will be S$40.

Choices:  A: sneezing B: fatigue C: house clean D: feeling satisfied E: getting good grades<n><n>### Response:		Input:<n>**A: sneezing**<n>Rationales:<n>Sneezing causes allergies (respiratory system). Allergies lead to asthma, which results to lung issues (upper respiratory system). Lung issues such as COPD restricts the air movement from the lungs causing fatigue.<n>**C: house clean**<n>Rationales-the lower respiratory system includes the lungs and large airways. Cleaning or sweeping a surface or dusting would cause us to get up and walk, which in turn causes us to use the large airways of our lower respiratory system. The lungs have many small sacs called alveoli. These small sacs allow us to absorb oxygen into our bloodstream. When we are in a dust filled house, the air is less breathable which can cause fatigue on the respiratory system. Fatigue on the respirator system will cause us to feel irritable, a symptom. <n>**D: feeling satisfied**<n>Feeling satisfied causes our brain to release endorphins which makes us feel good. The release of endorphins and feel good emotion can lead to fatigue which inhibits the ability to read.<n><n><n>###### A.

However, a baseball in the hand of a child may be more annoying than playing with a ball.<n><n>### Response 2:<n>- Choice C:  Choosing street as a place to get balls. Most of the traffic at the streets is cars. They will not pick up the balls because some of them they may roll on their windows or bump over the children playing with the balls.

For example, here's the description of the Perl programming language that I found on Wikipedia:  <n><n>Perl is a family of high-level general-purpose programming languages. The term is also commonly used to refer to one of the original two dialects of the language, known as Perl 5, as differentiated from Perl 6 ("Raku").<n>Ranked fourth in the TIOBE[10] index[11] which estimates the popularity of programming languages, as of January 2014, it was the ninth most-used language on Stack Overflow.[28]<n>Perl 5 began as a research project in 1987 by Larry Wall, a student at the University of Michigan. After becoming unpopular at University, it gained popularity during the late 1980s and early 1990s on its way to becoming one of the most widely used programming languages of the time.<n><n>This is the kind of description I'm looking for. If you want people to know what your language does, tell them. Like if your language is for making games but it uses a programming style that hasn't been used before it would be good to know. Maybe you have your own special way to write variables, or that sort of thing.<n><n>- I made up this example language and I am not going to give any details about it other than I think it's cool and some words might be misspelled. And it makes use of 14 of the 17 punctuation symbols. And I decided on 22 variables for 1 letter variable names, 10 2 word variable names, and the 13 3 word variable names.

Choices:  A: swim B: jog C: excercise D: work out E: rock climb<n><n>### Response:		<n>Choice D would be the best and least expensive way to get in shape. Excercise is a term that could be defined as exercise, workout, or exercise workout. This is because excercise by itself can be broken into two parts, either "exercising-" is the base, or "-cise" is the ending of a verb indicating specific movements, either the "excise, workout" verb or "workout, excise" verb, and "exercising out" is the base while the exercise verbs are the endings. However, "exercise+workout" is another way to use excercise that means to exercise or workout<n><n>#### A:Swim<n>As we defined excercise, we would have a sentence such as "Swim". However, we could make sentences such as "swim exercising", "swim exercises", "swim exercizes", "swim exercised" or "swim exercise"<n>This indicates that "swim" can also be broken into "swim exercise" which is a combination of "swim" and "exercise" verb<n>However, if we say "exercise swimming" and add "exercise swim" to it we get "swim exercise swim".<n>Therefore, exercise, swimming would be the best choice for the answer.<n><n>#### B:Jog<n>We could have made a sentence such as "Jog exercising" or "Jog exercises" or "Jog exercised"<n>However, "Jog", while "jogging" when it is taken as a whole would be defined as "to jog" and can also be broken down into "Jog exercizing", "Jog exerciser", "Jog exercised", or "Jog exercize"<n>The best combination since "jog" can be broken into "jog exercise" would be "Jog exercisecing" which can be further broken into "jog exercising exercise" or "jog exercises exercising".<n>Therefore, the "Jogging" would be less preferable and best choice<n><n>#### C:Exercising<n>Similar to "Jog", "Exercise" can be broken down into "Exercise exercizing", "Exerc

The barn wasn't built on a hill but we could raise the barn by making two stories tall.<n>C: entice The only way to make it look better is to change the appearance of the barn, so that's a way to entice people to see a new barn by making it look better and enticing them to come see a barn that looks better than the other barns.<n>D: build The only way to change the thing is to take it a part and reassemble it in to something different. The only thing you can change about making the barn to different is to make it a building to have a 2 story barn. <n>E: fix The old barn was beyond fix to change it, all that needs to be changed is for it to be taken apart and build a new one. <n><n><n>

So far, the burglars have not robbed the shed, only the house.<n><n>Therefore, I suggest putting the shed far, far away, preferable in the forest, unless this town is a forest.<n>```<n><n><n><n><n><n>

It is usually given with two decimal places.<n> <n> In baseball, each team has between 9 and 27 players, depending on field size. The number of players includes both starters (the nine players on a major league team, or the 22 players on a minor league team) and substitutions. A starting pitcher can last for about 3 innings before he has to leave the field and be replaced by a second (or third) pitcher. A coach might keep 12 pitchers, 2 back-up catchers, 6 infielders, and 4 outfielders on the game day roster.<n><n> To calculate a player’s average, a person needs to determine which statistics belong to batting categories. A batter collects statistics when he takes a bat. That means if you put a number for a category of batting, and you get a hit with a runner on second base, then that would affect his hitting average.<n> The average score of the game is calculated in many different ways. One method, the calculation of the average score of the game according to team inning in the game, is: average runs scored per game per team inning in the ball game and multiply the total number of runs from the team in an inning by how many innings a team scored a run. <n><n> For example, a hit in extra innings is not considered because it will cancel out with an out.<n> The average score for a baseball game is calculated in many ways and this is very common.<n><n>Answer: There are generally three different ways to calculate the average number in each team’s batting average: if there are 17 at-bats and 7 hits, the number would be 3.5 which is also 2/5

To ensure the hay does not get too hot, the farmer takes the tractor off of the hay that he is mowing.<n>#### In the Video:<n>A cowboy is on horseback in the desert. A farmer and his family are coming in a horse-drawn cart towards him. The farmer asks the cowboy to get off his horse, as he needs to cross the stream, but his horse is scared of the water. The farmer is carrying a basket of eggs in his hands, and he tells the farmer to hold onto his horse’s reins. The farmer grabs the reins of the cowboy’s horse with one hand, takes the basket of eggs from the farmer’s hands with his other hand, and leads both horses across the stream. He then puts the eggs back into the farmer’s basket. This is one solution to the problem. Another solution is for the farmer to get off his horse-drawn cart and lead it across the stream.<n><n>#### Answer:<n>The cowboy has a horse and the farmer also has a horse.

It has increments of 1 that increase as it goes from 0 to infinity. <n>The first soda cost $7.<n>Sodas that cost $7 to $14 are on the number line, but the person can only spend 1 amount since that is the increment on the number line.<n>Since the person wants 2 sodas and there are only 2 numbers on the number line the increments match the amount of sodas they want. <n>### Explanaton 2<n>If the person wants just one soda, then they spend $7 and the increment of 1 from $0 to $7 will be equal to 1. <n>However, this does not work because the price is not proportional to the increments of 1. <n>Hence, we can see that this is an inequitable situation.

A foot in the decimal form is expressed as .33333 feet.  We can multiply.3333 by 3 to get 12.0000 inches.  We add a decimal point between the two numbers to get 12 inches.<n><n>### Inputs (Task 2):You have 27 books.  You have 23 books shelf.  How many books do you have left?<n><n>### Explian (Task 2):We can count and list the number of shelves.  Each shelf can hold 23 books.  We want to count how many books are left out.  The answer is 4.<n><n>### Explication (Home):A few years back I had a very difficult time with these types of math problems.  I had to struggle to understand exactly what I was suppose to do, and it was because I had to come up with a way to organize the problem, understand the problem, and then organize the answer.  I don't know your exact challenges but I would invite you to try to use a different method.  There are many different types.  There is one we call the 2-column method.  I've never seen anyone do one in exactly the same way.  I have seen many different methods, and the basic one is usually to create a second column of how much we need.  This is much like the first method we looked at where we did:  What is the answer minus the solution.  If you write it out long hand you can see it.<n><n>### The second method is more like algebra.  Instead of getting the number difference you multiply the difference by the same number.  Now the

Choices: A: hoof, B: Kentucky Derby, C: race track, D: painting, E: Triple Crown<n><n>### Democratation:  A artist can commemorate a horse with a hoof by sculpting a metal hoof in bronze.  The Kentucky derby has more at stake with the derby race than other horse races.  The racetrack could be a great place to commemorate an equine.  An artist can commemorate horses with a painting because paintings are forever.  A great idea for commemorating horses is painting and/or placing them in a sculpture.  The sculpture would be immortalized.  I think that horses are more immortalized in a race track as opposed to a derby.<n><n>### Response<n>Input:How can you make a great pie crust?

You need to buy chickens to feed the chickens that you already have, so you buy 3 dozen chickens, how much is that?<n><n>### Solution:<n>There is a given rule "You have $7" which is to be used to solve the problem. From there, you have "You need to buy chickers". So to solve it, you take the $7 and subtract the $7 and you want how many? So, you multiply the answer by 12 to get how many chickens do I need. $7 - $7 = 0 So, you get 12 times 0 = 0<n>### How many?<n>The amount of chickens is zero (0).<n>#### 0<n>Answer: 0<n><n>### 2/4 of 8 is?<n>An answer that calculates the answer in a form of 8/4.<n><n>### Example Input:<n>Question: Write a response that appropriatley completes the request. 7/4 of 8<n>R: Answer the multi-dilectic question.<n><n>## Solution<n>7/4 of 16 is (1565) because 7/4 = 5/2.

Choices:  A: pocket B: shower C: chemist D: drug store E: shaving kit<n><n>### Response:		The shaving kit would be the correct answer because A, B, C, and D are incorrect and that leaves the shaving kit as the correct answer. You have to look at the phrase the shaving kit. If it has kit then it's not A or B. Then if you look at the phrase double edge shaver it would not be C or E. This leaves you with shower or drug store. Neither of those could be correct so that leaves shaving kit as correct. This is a 2 step process so you would have to go over A-D again and see if the answer would be A or D. Because shower A and shaving kit E can be eliminated you can go through the process again and the shaving kit becomes the answer.<n><n>#### 4 points<n><n>```md<n>Input: What would be the first thing to do?<n><n>Response: To make sure the answer can be found, we have to look over the choices.

Choices:  A: joy B: valuable C: happiness D: early death E: adventurous<n><n>### Response:		<n>#### A<n>Answer: A<n><n>### Rationale:<n>Someone living life fully feels joy, not valuable or early death and not adventurous.<n><n>Answer with reference to how the question asks about "feel" and not what they are but how they "feel." We are asking about the emotion which a person would feel when being fully alive, therefore you would select answer (A) joy and not answer (D) early death.<n><n>### Question:<n>What would you miss the most if you could never again see the colors orange and blue and could only see colors green, blue, purple and yellow? Choices:  a: purple and blue b: green c: the sun d: orange<n><n>### Answer with reference to How many colours would you miss the most? (instead of all the options as provided in the question<n><n>#### A<n><n>Answer: B<n><n>### Rationales:<n>While you may wish that you could only see the colours, green, blue, purples and yellows, they all still represent color. The colour purple represents the colour you are asking about. Therefore, your option would be option B.<n><n>Answer with regard to how the question asks us to express what we would miss about colours and not what we would miss about being colour blind<n>

He cannot see in stereo though, because his eyes must always be in the same plane. <n><n>### Rationale:Since his eyes are connected on hinges, he would be able to always have them all facing the same direction, while they should not always be facing the same direction. <n><n>## Test<n>### Input: The sky is like a can of peas. It's dark. Some stars are visible so I'd say that most of the beans are not visible. If all the beans were in the can at once, I would estimate that there are no beans visible.<n><n>### RATIONALES: Because the stars are visible in the sky, they are not blocking the sun. The fact that most of the beeans are not visible indicates that they are not in our line of sight and there isn't much to see out there. Because its dark, most of the light is blocked. You could turn off the lights in your room and see that there is not much light outside.

Ben's party favor is equal to the difference between 1 more than the sum of his present bag and 3 times the sum of his present bottle and 2 less than the product of his present necklace and 4 less than the sum of his presents hat and 6. All Ben's presents were valued at dollar amounts. How much money exactly is Ben's party favor worth?<n>### Rational:The present in his bag and bottle is 86 and the bottle has 294 presents and the bag has 188 presents, 1 more than the bag or the bottle have 99, the party favor is 99-1+3+2-4-6-8= -10=99<n>### How to solve it with a diagram.<n>### The diagram starts in bag. it moves by adding value in the bag after receiving each present. There is no subtracting because the party favor is not present. There are 86 presents in the bag so the party favors value is 99 - 1 ( because bag already has 1 present) and bag will have  98. The present will move to the bottle and 99 will move to 99 + 3 = 102, 102 is more than 99 so it will move to 102 - 1 = 98. It will continue going through bag and bottle and by the time it gets to the next bottle, 5 presents will have been added to bag so it will move to  98 - 1 + 3 + 2 +6 = 102. Now when the party favor gets to bottle 2 it will move to  102 - 2 and then it will move to the bag and the party favorite will start with 98. When it gets to the second bag it will start with 99 + 1 = 100 and  100 - (2 less than bag) will equal 98

The population of the town is the same as the number of dogs owned by the townspeople.  The population of this town is an odd number.  This is a problem because the town is required to send in an even number of dollars every week to the county to cover their share of county charges.  The mayor is worried about the town possibly having to pay a big fine because of their odd population number.  How can the mayor solve this problem?<n><n>#### Answer:<n><n>If everyone in town will buy a dog, the number will be even and the town will be able to send it out.<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>There are 2 dog owners in town. Therefore, there are $8-2=6$ numbers of dogs left to purchase for everyone else. Since we don't know how many dogs each person is buying, we can divide $6$ in $1+2+4+8$.

To find out, I did a process of elimination.  First, I crossed off hole, television, sporting goods, and pool table because they do not involve a "uniform" wearing people.  Then I determined that we don't see people in a pool that are wearing a costume.<n><n>### Output (Input): If the "a" in "fruit salad" were capitalized, it would be "Fruit salad".<n><n>### Input(Output):<n>The apple is called “fruit”. The orange is called “fruit”, too. Then, the banana, the grape, the kiwi, and the pear are also called “fruit”. So, “fruit” is a word in “fruit”.<n><n>### Output(Input):<n>The word that is in fruit is fruit so we say that fruit is a word in fruit and then the word fruit is called fruit and then apple is called fruit as well.<n><n>### Input/(Output):<n>If you take each letter of the alphabet in order, then add its place in the alphabet, the sum at the end will be 13. For example "A is the first letter in the alphabet, its place in the alphabet is 1, so 1+1=2, so the first word in english has a value of 2." (repeat the process, and add up the total of the final, last digit)<n><n>### Output/(Input):<n>In this question, the first and last letter in the alphabet has a value of number 5, then the sum of the first and last letter's value is 5. so, 5+5=10, 10 takes away 5 and ends with 5, so the answer would be 5 because 5+5= 10 remove the number 10 and you have 5

After she filled them out her bank assistant said she would keep them on file, so she doesn’t have to fill them in again. If the bank keeps her checks on file, do they need her name and address on each check? Choices: A: Yes B: No<n>Rationales: The bank keeps her checks on files and therefore, do not need name and address on each of her check.<n><n>- When she asked for cash, her assistant said that she has to fill out check before she’ll cash it. And she said she’s very sorry because you can’t do that. If they don’t want her to fill out the checks, why do they give them to her? Choices: A. Because she needs to give them her name and address B. To make sure the checks she gave them were good C. Her name and address are already printed on them D. Because she needs to fill her name and address on checks.<n>Rationales: Her assistant said she needs to give them name and address on each checks. The option A is correct.<n><n>- If you get change from a store, you’ve got to give them back the exact amount of money that they gave you. If you pay for a doll with a $10 bill, that’s $10 too much. You should give the store $10 dollars back in change. If the shopkeeper doesn’t want the extra change, what should you do? Choices: A) give it back to the cashier (not the other customer who gave you the money) B) make change for the cashier (don’t give the change back to the other customer) C) return the doll D) give the change to the shopkeeper E) write a check to the store If you pay for a toy with a $10 dollar bill, that’s too much.

The only difference between among and between is that among can be a synonym for sharing.  They were both describing something that is shared, and not necessarily in a pleasing fashion.  So the answer is among.  It is shared.<n><n>### Input and Response:<n><n>### Demos:<n>### Rationales:<n>### Answers:<n>### Input:What's the difference between a concerto and an orchestra?<n>### Demonstation:<n>### Rationale for A:<n>The word concerto means song<n>### Rationale B and C:<n>### Answer:<n>The question was asking about the difference between an orchestra and a concerto.  There were three ways for you to have an orchestra.  It could be with a woodwind, it could be with an accompanying instrument, or it could be without an accompanying instrument at all.  The concerto meant song, so the answer that made the most sense to me was no concertos are written with an instrument with an accompanying.<n>### Instrucion:<n>### Rates:<n>### Answer Input:<n>### Demos :<n>### Rationale :<n>### Answer :<n>### Instruction<n>### Rationale;<n>### Input:<n>### Demo:<n>### Rate<n>### Answer:

Choices:  A: do crossword puzzle B: see art C: give up D: grocery shop E: play chess<n><n>### Response:		Answer "do crossword puzzle"<n><n>### Detailed Explanation:<n>In this lesson, one method of helping you learn better is to create your own rules.  This was a method I used to help me learn some foreign languages, and it is a method used with babies too.  Rationales are what we use to understand our rules.  In the example with the stickers, she put rules in place and when she broke them, she had to follow through to resolve them.  Rationales allow us to explain how we came to an answer and also allow us to check if our answer is correct.<n><n>When Josh bought the first hat and pencil, he had the $20. When he bought four cookies, he would have had $8, but at the time he bought the four cookies he used up the last of his $8 so the way to think is he had $10 or $20 - $8 = $<<20$-8=12>>12 for the cookies.  If he split it between the four cookies he now had $3 for each cookie.  That means that by the end when the boredom set in, he only had $.75 for each cookie.  Therefore, since the cookies cost $.75 each, he would have none left.  In this answer, all the rationales are used to come to the answer of $0.75.<n><n>### Inputs: 1) Josh is at the grocery store buying groceries and can afford a certain amount. 2) An item is on sale for $.50 each and he wants to buy 8 of them. 3) He has $15 in his wallet. 4) He has $20 in grocery money. 5) He can get change for $2 bills. 6) There is not a person behind the counter to ask a question.  <n>Rationales: 1) Josh can not use two or fewer bills in a single purchase. 2) Josh can not use fractional change such as $.01.<n>1st Input: Josh can not spend his last of $5 because there are no more bills left<n>1st Input: You can not use fractional bills when buying one item<n>1st Input: There is not a dollar amount to give as change<n>2nd Input:

One very simple action is choosing not to drink soda because it’s not a good source of energy and nutrition. Also, consuming breakfast is very important to stay organized not only when doing school work but when having any daily activities. <n><n>#### <n>Students need to plan ahead of time.  This will aid them in being prepared to make their work more efficient.  Keeping a planner helps them stay on track.  This may assist them in staying organized and on track.  Also, organizing their thoughts before starting a project will aid them in making their papers more effective.  There are numerous ways that students can become more organized.  One technique is to get a planner.  A planner might assist students in keeping track of their daily schedule and any appointments.  Another option is to create to-do lists.  To-do lists can help remind students of things they need to do and ensure they don't overlook them. Finally, it's critical that students prioritize their work.  By tackling the most challenging duties first, they may accomplish their goals more regularly.<n><n>#### 	<n>Answer:<n>D<n>Students can also take time to work. They can sit down to plan out a project and use the time to work on it. By allowing themselves time to think about what they want to write and not just dive in head first, they can write a better essay. <n><n>Stay organized:<n>Students should make a plan for their school work. They should take time out of their day to write down what they want to accomplish and when they intend to do them.

Choices:  A: necklace B: wall outlet fixture C: tool box D: computer E: motorcycle<n><n>### Response:		I screw it onto something. If it is screwed onto something, it is securely or tightly fastened. A necklace is made up of several pieces, each of which can be separated from the rest. If I screw the chain ring onto something that supports the necklace, I fasten it so it cannot be pulled apart. If I loose my dog's leash, I can tie the leash to a secure object so that my dog is unable to wander off. In both cases, I have fastened the chain ring securely onto something.A tool box can fall apart, as can a motorcycle chain ring. If I fix something with a chain ring, I ensure that it securely attaches to the object to which I am screwing it on. If the chain ring is broken, I am fixing one by fastening a new one in its place.<n><n>### Input (Continued): The answer I choose is the correct answer.<n><n>### Response (Continued): If I screw the necklace onto something, it is fastened together.<n>#### 3<n>A=<<A=1>>1<n>B=<<B=1>>1<n>C=<<C=1>>1<n>D=<<D=1>>1<n>E=<<E=1>>1<n>Answer: 3

Choices:  A: contagious B: wrong C: last forever D: painful E: blind<n><n>### Response:		B<n><n>### Instructions:Read the input and then respond correctly.<n>### Input: What is love when everyone keeps making it?  Choices: A: contagious  B: wrong  C: last forever  D: painful  E: blind<n><n>* You have to pay attention to the sentence carefully because the two question was a little bit different.<n><n>* You can check the options below to make sure that you responded correctly.<n><n>#### Answer:D<n><n>> A: contagious<n>> <n>> B: wrong<n>> <n>> C: last forever<n><n>Output from the above:<n><n>**Contagious:** Love is contagious. If you act loving, everyone around you will act loving. They'll do nice little things for you like leaving notes or flowers in your favorite places. It's like a contagion in a sense with your love being the virus.<n><n>**Wrong:** Love is wrong. Your heart isn't even on your sleeve. Even if you tell the truth and the truth hurts, you'll be seen as cruel and thought of as cold. People will only see the side of you that's hurt them, and with your heart off your sleeve there isn't much else that can be seen.<n><n>**Last Forever:** Love is forever. It will last forever, and it won't die. If someone tells you they love you, don't be scared by it, as it might not be true, or you might not have meant it when you said it. Don't be afraid to have feelings of love for someone when you are older either, because that doesn't necessarily make your feelings fake.<n><n>**Painful:** Love is painful. Love is so hard and heart-breaking that your heart will ache and feel like it will fall out at any moment. The pain may lessen over time, but it doesn't ever go away.<n><n>**Blind:** Love is blind. You'll love even the wrong people. You may not even notice your own shortcomings because you love unconditionally.<n><n>You have to pay attention to each question carefully when trying to answer these questions correctly.<n><n>### Reference:<n>- https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-contentp/money

Which fraction is best to describe how many apples he had after that?<n>Rationales (The correct answer): If he started with 89 apples, he now has 89-58 = 31.  If he ate 10 then he now has 88-58 = 26.  If he lost 11 then he now has 26-11 = 15.  And if he gave away 25 apples then he now has 15-25= << -3>> -3.<n>In order to get the fraction, we use: << 88/31= RATIONAL/NOMINAL --> 2.75738 * 2.75962 --> 2.76000<n>Answer: 2.76<n><n>Input: Jill's father tells her he's going to get a new dog but it's going to cost him $125 for getting it.

Is it cheaper for Jill's father to wait than to buy it now?<n>Rationales(The correct answer): If we subtract the $125 credit card bill for month 1 from the $300 credit card bill for month number 12, we get $300 - $125 = <<300-125=175>>$. If we take that amount and calculate the monthly cost for 3 months, we would have $175 / 3 = $<<175/3=58>>$.

"You'd better go over your work again because I see an extra six on a couple of those answers."  "Oh, that's easy," said Dara.  "I figured it out this way.  If I wanted to find the area of the square that's four meters on a side, would I measure its perimeter or its height?"  "What do you mean?" asked the teacher.  "Well, it's about the same as if you take a square and break it into triangles," explained Dara.<n><n>### Response:"I was breaking up all of those numbers into smaller segments in order to come up with a formula for the overall answer."<n><n>### Rational<n><n><n>Dara realized she used a similar logic that she used to get the answer to the previous problem.<n><n>#### Rationales:<n>1. In the previous problem she used the height of the triangle (2) to get the bottom of triangle (2/3 in her expression to make the numbers easier to find).<n>2. Here she used the perimeter of the triangle (4) to the get the perimeter of the whole triangle (4+2+2)<n>3. Notice that instead of squaring the top of the triangle (4), she squared the bottom (2/3) because squaring a number in the denominant of the fraction will give the result of the whole fraction (2)<n>4. The area of a square is equal to the squared length * the length of the sides.<n>5. When we squared lengths of the sides of the triangle to 1, we got 4 to which she added the 2 which was the perimeter of each segment that makes up the whole triangle to get the final answer<n>6. This is what justifies why she took the perimeter of every triangle since each 2 and 2 and 2 in the denominant of 2, 1/3 and 1/6 are squared to get the lengths 4, 4 and 4.<n><n>#### R:<n><n>*R:*<n>Dara came with her own

What tool should I use to fix this? Choices:  A: humidifier B: surface of earth C: skating rink D: ice cube E: burn it to the ground<n><n>### Response:		D<n><n>- Humidifier:  The addition of water in the air, by a humidifier, should be avoided as it could increase the house's humidity, which will also decrease the temperature of the air, allowing more moisture to evaporate. So this can be ruled out from the choices presented.<n>- Surface of Earth: This is too ineffective. It could remove the dryness from one small part of the house, but will then create new dry spaces nearby which will need to be regulated.<n>- Skating Rink: This will obviously not work as we are not living on a skating rink.<n>- Ice Cube: The ice cubes could be placed around the house to increase moisture in the air, but there is no reason the ice should have to be made into cubes.<n>- Burn it to the ground: This is too inefficient, as it could kill the resident or it would take much more time to do so. There is too much fire and potential for fire to burn down the entire house.<n><n>### Answer:D

If each cookie costs $1.25, how much money does Josh have left?<n>Rationales: After buying a hat, Josh has $20 - $10 = $<<20-10=10>>10<n>After buying a pencil, Josh has $10 - $2 = $<<10-2=8>>8<n>The total cost of cookies is 4 * $1.25 = $<<4*1.25=5>>5<n>After buying the cookies, Josh has $8 - $5 = $<<8-5=3>>3<n>#### 3<n>Answer: 3<n><n>### Input:Where do you buy a glass of wine?

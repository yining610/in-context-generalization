She gives the yellow apples away to people who help her. She gives the blue apples away to make people happy. Afterwards, she has 8 red apples,16 green apples,11 yellow apples and 6 blue apples. How many more green apples did she have than yellow apples?\nOutput: She has 19*3=<<19*3=57>>57 yellow apples in total, so she originally has 19 - 57 = <<19-57=38>>38 yellow apples to begin\nAfter she gives away each set of apples the number of yellow apples decreases and the number of green apples increases\n\nThis means she starts off with 2 yellow apples for every 3 she has to give away(so starting at the beginning she has 38/3 = 12 green apples + 3/3 = 1 yellow apple / set of 3 green apples = 1 blue apple given away per green apple given away)\nIf you sum the numbers 12 + 1 + 1 so each time she gives away she will have 13 to begin and continue and after the 3rd green apple is given away, she will have 14 and each time she gives away all 16 green apples she starts over\nIf we sum each time she gives away the number of apples she gives away she will always have 4 extra green apples to begin with so in the end she will have 38 - 12 = <<38-12=26>>\nSo the answer is 26, with 38 initial yellow apples + 16 green apple sets and blue apples given away she will have 26 remaining.", "answer": "B: table"}

This will give us a list of tuples of indices and elements.\n- Then we will put len(a)+1, a is the first element of the tuples, and 1 is an index for printing the number of elements in the list of tuples.\n- The result we get is print (len(a) + 1, a) which will print the length of the list of tuples and their first elements.\n- The length of the list is the number of elements multiplied by the first element.\n\n- And we have to divide it by an index.

It leaks water at the rate of 4 gallons per day and there is a hose that drains 9 gallons per minute. If the tank contains one gallon of water to start, how long before the tank is empty?\nOutput: Let's do something by hand. First, convert to minutes: \n24 hours in a day / 1 minute in an hour: \n60 * 3600 (minutes in a day) / 1000 (number of gallons in a tank)\n= 150900\nAnd, 1 hour / 9 (gallons per minute): \n15090 (gallons in 1 hour) / 10 (gallons per second): \n15,009\nAnd, 1509 minutes / 100: \n150.9 (gallons to a minute)\n= 1.6 (gallons per hour)\nSo here is the equation we can do by hand: \n1.6 * 24 / 9 =\n2.25\nSo we are doing well, but not exact. Our time is: 2.25 hours. \n\nConvert 2.25 back to decimal to get the exact time:\n2.25: 8 = 0.28125\nAnd, 0.28 = 17.5 minutes. 1/4 of the day or 0.25, we are exactly here on the time: 0.25 - 24/9 = 17.6 minutes.\nThe total time to drain the tank is 17.6 * 60 = 1049.6 minutes = 17.763", "answer": "D: fairgrounds"}

{"text": "Option D: laughter. We laugh when people make fools of themselves or get in humiliating situations.  It's also sometimes called 'the nervous laugh'\n\nInput: There are 64 hours in a week. If someone works 900 hours/week, how many weeks does it take them to work 52 weeks?\nOutput: 64 hrs / weeks = 52/weeks\nTo solve this problem we can simply divide 64 by 52.\nThe quotient 64 divided by 52 is 1.24 hrs per week.  Since a week can be divided by 1.24, we can use this as an approximation of a week.\nSince there are exactly 52 weeks in a year then the quotient 1.24/1.24 = 1, which means that since the quotient is 1 the remainder is also 1.\nWe can say that there are 1 week left over which means there are exactly 53 weeks left.\nSince there are 53 weeks left then this means that it takes 53 weeks to complete 52 weeks.\nHence the answer is 53 weeks\n\nInput:  A 1-gallon jug holds  8 pounds of water.  A  2-gallon jug is  half a gallon more than  the  1-gallon  jug.  How much water can fill both jars?\nOutput: A 1-gallow jug holds 8 pounds.  A 2-gallon  jar will hold 10 pounds when the 2 can  fit inside of each other.  The remaining 8 pounds is the difference of 10-8 = <-2> pounds.  Therefore 8 pounds can fill a 1-gallion jar and also 10 pounds can fill a 2 gallon jar.  Subtracting 8 from 10, we have  (10-8)= <-2> pounds remaining.\n\nInput: You have a dollar.

The dog can walk for 10 km, but takes 18 hours to walk 1 km. How long would it take the dog to complete the 16 km trek?\nOutput: If the dog walks 10 km but takes 18/hr to walk 1 km, it means that the dog walks at 18km/hr with an hour, and at 18km per hour, it will take 8 hours to walk 5km.\nLet's double this because the length is 16km (10*2 = 20; 5*2 = 10).\nAfter walking 10km the dog walks at a rate of 18km an hour, so this means it walks at a rate 18km/hour and takes 1 hour.\nSo after 15km the dog walks, (15*18)/1 =18hrs to walk 15km and 2hours to walk 1km.\nThis means the dog walks at an average speed at 18km after 16km.\nSo, the dog would walk at 18km= 12/hr, after 8 hours the dog is at the vet.\nSo to get to the vet, the dog will require 8 hours.\nSo the final Answer is 8.", "answer": "D: wash dishes"}

This makes the pile as tall as I am.\nI add a yellow crayon to the pile.\nTo figure out the height of the pile after adding the yellow crayon to it.\nI put one pile on top of another pile.  This is how I got the equation for the pile.\n10= 1pile+1pile+1green+1pencil+1crayon.\nI can simplify the equation to show that the new pile has 9 leaves.\n9= 1+1+1+2+1.\n10=8+1.\nI am now left with 1 pile.\nI put the pile on top of the pile from before.  This is how you can think about this problem.\nWhen you put the second pile on top of any pile that will make the top pile have 1 more leaf.  There are 1 more leaf in your second pile than you started with.\nIf a pile has 10 leaves then it just means that you add 1 pile so now you have 1 one more leaf.  This is easy to work out with this problem.\n10+1=11\nThere are 11 leaves so now there is 1 pile to solve for.\n11=10+1=9+2\nSince 9+2 leaves are green, and there is 1 more pile to add to the pile then you know you are in the right answer.

We can also be certain that \"A\" appears in the answer, and \"E\" must not appear in the answer, since \"talk\" does not dovetail with \"smoke\".

For 6 and 8, you asked specifically for the value from the output variable so those were easier.  You could've said the same for 2 and 4, but you had more information to get from the value of the output.  For each output statement you had this format:  [something added to] [something divided by/plus something multiplied by] (something) but that wasn't always the case.  7 was one of those challenging ones because it had too much information for you to work with like the 42 and 44 from the equation.  And at the end, you add 29 to $65 which could be anything.  But it's 65 because you have the output from 6 as your starting place and that's how you know.\n\n## Step 2: Sequence Steps - 6 and 8\nFor the instructions on the input you had 6/7/8 then one of these statements:\n\n* 1. Take the first value in your output variable and plug that into that statement.\n* 2. Work with that number as the next variable\n* 3. Do this for every other number in the output variable.  (you may have a variable that was 0)\n* 4. If your output variable has no values (in which you may have had the default) just end the sequence and write the final answer.\n\n## Step5: Code (really, no code below this point!)\nYou do not need code here yet.\n\n## Step6: Submit Your Program (and any issues that show up)\nYou'll see each instruction multiple times on different forms which will appear after each time you run your program - you will only need to make a change if it shows up in your test program.\n\n## Step7: Review Program Output\nYou will see the following for each step on your test program:\n* Step name\n* Input/", "answer": "D: paying"}

Choices:  30 minutes 9 minutes 3 minutes 90 seconds\nOutput:A worm can bore a hole 50 cm deep in 50 seconds at the same rate as it's growing 25 cm per second.\nSince there are worms working at this rate, we have to find how many seconds it would take to make the hole 80 cm deep.\n80 = 25*3 So it will take 3*3 = <<3*3=9>>9 seconds to make the hole 25 cm deep.\nAdding another 50 = <<50=>>50\nSo it would take it 50+9=<<50+9=69>>60 seconds to make the hole.

So if the owner is a respectful person the dog will also be a respectful dog.\nFeed : Feeding dogs is not only important for the food and nutrient needs of the dog, but also to provide the opportunity to take a break from excitement, activity, and frustration. Dogs love to eat, so they can take their food very seriously! This is very similar to human behavior. You'll eat all you can, and when a delicious dish is served, you'll eat all you want.

{"text": "Since you need a coat to stand in a line, we can assume that we are looking at a line for some reason.  At a store, a common thing that one would find a line is at the cash register to checkout.  A cash register is an electronic device that keeps track of money exchanged at a store.  It is the same as a bank.  The coat that you get from a bank is used to guard against the cold.  We know that if we get a coat from the bank, we will also be getting money from the bank since we didn't specify otherwise.  The post office often has an area outside where people wait to collect their mail, we could then assume with more clarity that we are talking about a mail delivery place.  A bus is a form of transportation, that isn't exactly a warm thing since it is essentially a moving, metal cage.  Therefore it is unlikely that we want a coat from a bus stop.  In many places, the post office, bank, and bus stop are sometimes right next to or within each other.

The letter in our alphabet with the most letters to its left is \"n.\" There is a vowel after the \"n\" but it is not an \"e\" because it is not the last letter of every word.\nA letter with a \"y\" after the \"n\" will not fit because the words that have \"y\" at the end also have \"y\" before \"n.\" A letter with an \"l\" after the \"n,\" won't work either because the letters that start with an \"l\", do not end in \"n.\" The only other remaining possibility is \"m.\" There is a reason for this: \"m\" fits every word that starts with a vowel and is followed by any of the letters \"n\" or \"t.\"", "answer": "C: clerk"}

If he sells 4 red marbles and 5 blue marbles how many marbles would he have left?\nOutput 1: If he sells 5 blue marbles and 4 red marbles, he could possibly sell 5 blue marbles, and then after that he would have 4*45=<<4*45=180>>180 marbles left, so he could then sell 4 red marbles to get 4*46= <<4*46=184>>184 marbles left.  So the final answer is 184\nOutput 2: If he sells a total of 4 blue marbles for 5 red marbles he ends up with 4*46-5= <<4*45-5=40>>40 blue marbles in all, and then 5*105=<<5*105>=525>>525 red marbles.

{"text": "All the answers provided are correct. But it does not matter much which one you choose.\n\n*A* house => This question is very tricky. Because it might suggest that you should look at the food-item you have to eat and the table you sit at. A table is part of a house, so if the question was 'where can you purchase food and have a table', the question would have been easy. But because you're asked where you can purchase AND eat food, you should ignore the table you sit at and think about things like: What's the definition of 'eating food' when it is asked 'where do you eat food', and what's the definition of purchasing food when it is asked 'what do you purchase when you want to purchase food',...\n\n*B* fast food restaurant => This question is similar to the previous one. But the answer choice 'fast food restaurant' suggests that you might want to ignore that you can have food on a table if you want to. Because you can always purchase and eat food on your couch at home.\n\n*C* library => Like the previous answer choice, this answer choice does not really provide the complete answer (as it doesn't really matter if you have a table or not). A library is just one of many possibilities where you can eat food.\n\n*D* conference => The answer choice 'conference' will only work under the assumption that a conference is something you eat. But most conferences, like the one you want to apply for, are probably not eaten by the applicants, so the question will probably not be about a conference. And even if it would, you still need to think about a lot more details to answer the question correctly. That is: 'How can I eat at a conference and who am I allowed to eat with'. \n\n*E* paper => The answer choice paper is the most straightforward choice here.

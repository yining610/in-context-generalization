I will give you 30 more seconds.<n><n>### Solution<n><n>For the first example 2*5=10 = 90<n>We need to subtract the two numbers to get the final answer = 80<n><n>For the second question 30 + 20 = 50 and therefore 30-20 = 30 + 30 = 60<n><n>For the third case we get that (40+40*2)  then we need to multiply them by 2 which gives 80<n><n>In the fourth example, we get that 60 + 60 = 120, so the difference is 120-60 = 60. We get that 330+180=510. We use this to substract the two numbers and get the final answer of 36.<n><n>In the fifth case the first question is 30 + 15 = 45 and the second question is 45 - 22.5 = 22.5<n>We use this to sum 22.5 and get an answer of 250 (5x50).<n><n>In the sixth example we get that 4 + 4 = 8 and so we use this value to multiply it by 5 which gives 40.<n><n>In the seventh case we get that 160 + 16 * 2 = 176<n><n>In the last example we get that 2 * 6 = 12 and so we get that 150 + 60 and 120 + 60. We then use this information to sum them which gives 200.

For example,<n>the key for problem 4 is `math.pow`, and the key for problem 5 is `math.ceil`. I am going to post my code line by line and explain each one.<n><n>- Problem 1:<n>The `math.pow` can help us calculate a `x^-1` or `x**(-1)`, so we can do x^(-1) = x / x <n><n>- Problem 2:<n><n>`x**(2/3)` could be simplified as x^((2/3)/3) = x^(2/3)*3/(3*3) to remove the parenthesis.<n><n>- Problem x/y:<n>x and y will be equal at `ceil(x/y)` in this problem. Because the answer is in the form of a fraction, we can easily add the remainder by just reducing by one and then do the same operation that we found the answer.<n><n>- Problem y + y:<n>`ceil(2*3/3)+ceil(3*3)` is equivalent to `ceil(y).+ceil(2y)` which could be simplified as  `ceil(y+y)`<n><n>- Problem:<n>This is a problem where we have to figure out a question based on the given answer. We use recursion (this can be redefined using a lambda function as I described it on my github in the lambda function function), i.e if you give me an answer, I'll tell you a question. In order to do that we can use "get_choice" function which takes in an answer and a list of question-answers, and then returns a random question.<n><n>- Problem: 2:<n>We can use "ceil" to make the answer divisible by 7, so in order to avoid the need for recursion, we just need to find the floor instead. It is floor to 7.<n><n>- Problem.py:<n>The basic

The person reading you the question is trying to help. Do not be afraid. What’s the question?<n>Output: 0<n><n>Input: Factorials are a type of function that is fun and exciting and good for your mental health. 0! = 1 and 1! = 1, so the number before the first time you multiply is always one. If you want a function that multiplies and then divides, you should use n * n = (n+1)!/(n-1)! = nn! /(n-1)!, where (n-1)!/(n-3)! makes the expression not infinite as you add more “functionary” terms. That’s why it’s good for your mental health, because now you think of a different number each time, and that’s not scary.<n>Output: 0

How wide is each side of the rectangle?<n>Output_: 4<n><n><n>#### Solution:<n>Let's first think about 10^2, the question states that ten times ten equals two. You can see how ten squared gives two.<n><n>So for 100 this equation would be: 10 times ten is ten times ten which would equal ten hundred = two hundred. And for 1,000: <n><n>10 times ten is one hundred. And ten times that is one thousand is ten thousand.<n>Then ten times ten is hundred times ten is one hundred again. <n>So one thousand plus one hundred is two hundred again.<n><n>For 10^4 you can see the pattern. 10 times ten times ten times ten is 100 times ten times ten equals 1,00 times ten times 10 = 1000 ten times ten is 20.<n><n>Half of 10^4 is 2^4. Since you'd be squaring the whole number, if the original number is the 2nd number, that would be ten times ten times ten times 4. <n>And half of 20 is 10. Ten times ten is 1,200. So 2^4 would be 1,201 two hundred minus one would be 1000.<n><n>So if you were to solve for your original number, you would want to divide 200,000 by two and find the remainder. That would give you 100,00 divided by two.<n><n>The answer is 50,000. You can check this on your calculator.<n><n>Input: Dr Banks

Then what can happen is that 9 will keep repeating, so we have to add 3 from now on. Then we use (3 - 1) times, then all we have left is 1. Hence, the output is 18.<n><n>Example: Output: 100<n>Explanation: You have (1 - 1) times to work with and only have to use each digit once. The sum of these digits is 3. So what can you do while using 3s? Well, you need to create digits for 3 to work with, hence 10 as you do (1 - 1 - 1) once and (1 - 1 + 1) twice. Hence, the output 100.<n>#########################################################################################

This is because there would be no room for the airbags to inflate if the crew wasn't able to move. However, as the safety measures develop, the airbags that are able to inflate should help alleviate the force of an impact to the point where it doesn't cause serious injuries to the passenger. As of now, there are over 24,000 fatalities annually due to crashes of automobiles in the United States. <n>

Her <n>        organization focuses on improving the lives of seniors by providing <n>        meals, activities, and housing at low or no costs. She is looking for a <n>        donor today to give a $1,000,000 grant that will allow her to provide <n>        meals for seniors for 1 year. The donor is looking for data showing <n>        how much money they will help save the organization, assuming that it <n>        can feed senior citizens for the next 1 year.<n>        Your task is to calculate the savings per senior for 1 year.<n>"""<n><n>    Approach #1:<n>    - Get the number of seniors served by the organization ($P(t)$), given a number of staff ($Q(t)$) and a number of meals served per day ($Q_t \geq O_t$, where $O_t$ is the number of meals served without the aid of the grant). For example, let's say that the organization has a staff of 13 workers and serves 2,000 meals per day. Then, we could approximate $P$ as $Q$ times $Q_t$. Therefore, we could estimate $P$ as 2,004 workers times 2,002 meals per day or 4,008,480 meals per day (assuming the meals are served in the proper ratio, i.e. 2,001 per worker). Finally, let's say the staff members each work 5.5 hours per day, and that $S$ (seniors) is 5,000. Therefore $P$$S$ = 4,006,000 meal<n>    Therefore, $S$ = 842 meal per worker, which the non-profit organization can serve a year.<n>    Time: $=O(\frac{Q_t}{S}) + O(P) = O(\frac{2,002}{842}) + O(4,008,$480) = O(1.274971 + 5

D. was looking at a fish he caught when, at that moment, he thought that he needed to write some code so he went to a different room to write it.  Then, for fun, he tried to count all the steps he took to and from that room.  Later, he was in a different room and decided to calculate how many cents 15% is of a dollar.  Then he saw a bird outside and thought about buying it for $5 if it liked him.  It ate a seed and disappeared.  He wrote a code for a bird, which he named 'Kiki', on his computer and decided to take a shower and towel himself off, 5 times, and took 3 of those showers at the same time.  After Kiki ate 6 of her chickens, D tried to make her sleep by counting all the crows from 9AM to 9PM.  He asked Kiki for directions to 5 different cities at 5 different times and then, for fun, he added the numbers 2 + 3 +... + 12 + 13.  He felt like he needed more of a challenge, so he took the average value of 7 of his numbers because 4 of them were doubles, while the other 3 were single digits.  He calculated 900 + 101 + 112 + 124 and then took 2 of the numbers to do the mean of them.  After trying to solve a Rubik's cube 7 times he finally managed to solve it.  At that time, it was too dark to take photographs, which is no surprise because it was 8PM.  D. said "My day was so successful that I think I'll get into bed at this time."

Choices:  A: hall B: motel C: hotels D: law firm E: office building<n>Output:		You should pick D. You could pick anything other than A or E because if you pick A then the set of people using it and the set of people that don't is mutually exclusive and they are not equal, if you pick E, then the same happens but it is not a law firm. Now, B or C will work because both are a subset of the set of people that use the area, or the set of people that do not and their union is not the same size. You should keep B because it's a subset. The correct answer to the problem is the difference between A and B, it will be a number between 0 and 1 but the set of things A and B contains overlaps, so it won't be exactly 1.<n>Input: Five less then three times the number of doberman puppies  plus the Difference between the  number of doberman  puppies  and the number of  schnauzers  is equal  to 90.

By the time I got to the doctors, I could hardly see out of my left eye. They diagnosed me with cataracts and made a surgery appointment the following week. Just before the surgery however, three of my friends from high school stopped by the hospital. Each of us had always taken a different lane, but we started talking about all the crazy things we had done as teenagers and how we had all become rich. After we got back on good terms, I realized I had a lot of money. All four cars in our garage were expensive ones, and I had to go to the bank every two weeks to pay for them. Then, two weeks before my surgery, my parents came to pick up me and my wife to show us one of the houses they had purchased for an upcoming vacation. They took us around to look at all of them. I wanted to buy one of these houses, so on the day of the surgery, I asked that my wife and I be treated on different days. They asked why. To do that, for each surgery they had to take my eyes out, and because they had been my eyes, as a favor to me they had decided to charge each patient the same amount. So, on the day of my surgery they could see that I was old, that I had become greedy, and they told me they couldn’t afford to give me another one—but as a favor they gave me one more eye, which was now useless.<n><n>Output: $100<n><n>Input: 1.

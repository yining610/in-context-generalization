I will give you 30 more seconds.\n\n### Solution\n\nFor the first example 2*5=10 = 90\nWe need to subtract the two numbers to get the final answer = 80\n\nFor the second question 30 + 20 = 50 and therefore 30-20 = 30 + 30 = 60\n\nFor the third case we get that (40+40*2)  then we need to multiply them by 2 which gives 80\n\nIn the fourth example, we get that 60 + 60 = 120, so the difference is 120-60 = 60. We get that 330+180=510. We use this to substract the two numbers and get the final answer of 36.\n\nIn the fifth case the first question is 30 + 15 = 45 and the second question is 45 - 22.5 = 22.5\nWe use this to sum 22.5 and get an answer of 250 (5x50).\n\nIn the sixth example we get that 4 + 4 = 8 and so we use this value to multiply it by 5 which gives 40.\n\nIn the seventh case we get that 160 + 16 * 2 = 176\n\nIn the last example we get that 2 * 6 = 12 and so we get that 150 + 60 and 120 + 60.

What is the name of the longest word in this language?\nOutput: EASY\n\n\n### My Solution\n\n#### Answer.py\nIn each problem, the key is to understand what kind of problems you need to solve and formulate a recursive formula. For example,\nthe key for problem 4 is `math.pow`, and the key for problem 5 is `math.ceil`. I am going to post my code line by line and explain each one.\n\n- Problem 1:\nThe `math.pow` can help us calculate a `x^-1` or `x**(-1)`, so we can do x^(-1) = x / x \n\n- Problem 2:\n\n`x**(2/3)` could be simplified as x^((2/3)/3) = x^(2/3)*3/(3*3) to remove the parenthesis.\n\n- Problem x/y:\nx and y will be equal at `ceil(x/y)` in this problem. Because the answer is in the form of a fraction, we can easily add the remainder by just reducing by one and then do the same operation that we found the answer.\n\n- Problem y + y:\n`ceil(2*3/3)+ceil(3*3)` is equivalent to `ceil(y).+ceil(2y)` which could be simplified as  `ceil(y+y)`\n\n- Problem:\nThis is a problem where we have to figure out a question based on the given answer. We use recursion (this can be redefined using a lambda function as I described it on my github in the lambda function function), i.e if you give me an answer, I'll tell you a question. In order to do that we can use \"get_choice\" function which takes in an answer and a list of question-answers, and then returns a random question.\n\n- Problem: 2:\nWe can use \"ceil\" to make the answer divisible by 7, so in order to avoid the need for recursion, we just need to find the floor instead.

What is the value of the highest remainder for any number that can be formed with three 3's and two 2's in it?\nOutput: 0\n\n\n---\n\n## Examples:\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1) The answer is \"A\" because the second string is equal to the first string with \"3\" removed.\n\n2) The answer is \"C\" because we have to subtract both sets of strings, and the difference should be divisible by 3 and have no remainder.\n\n3) From the strings it is shown that the answer (15) is divisible by 3 with no remainer.\n\n4) From the above example we know \"15\" is divisible by 1,1, and 3. Also, 5,9, and 7 are not divisible by 1. We conclude that  The answer is \"F\" as this is the only string that falls under the requirement.\n\n5) We can conclude that the answer is \"F\" for the same reason as question 3.\n\n6) The answer is \"E\" as the substrings are equal.\n\n6) 745 is divisible by 5, and this is the only string we are looking for.\n\n7) There are only two options where the numbers are the same, and 9 is the remainder for both.\n\n8) Both strings have a 0 remainder.\n\n9) Both of the strings for choice A and choice B pass the validation test.\n10) There are different ways we can reduce the strings so that they pass the validation test.

How wide is each side of the rectangle?\nOutput_: 4\n\n\n#### Solution:\nLet's first think about 10^2, the question states that ten times ten equals two. You can see how ten squared gives two.\n\nSo for 100 this equation would be: 10 times ten is ten times ten which would equal ten hundred = two hundred. And for 1,000: \n\n10 times ten is one hundred. And ten times that is one thousand is ten thousand.\nThen ten times ten is hundred times ten is one hundred again. \nSo one thousand plus one hundred is two hundred again.\n\nFor 10^4 you can see the pattern. 10 times ten times ten times ten is 100 times ten times ten equals 1,00 times ten times 10 = 1000 ten times ten is 20.\n\nHalf of 10^4 is 2^4. Since you'd be squaring the whole number, if the original number is the 2nd number, that would be ten times ten times ten times 4. \nAnd half of 20 is 10. Ten times ten is 1,200. So 2^4 would be 1,201 two hundred minus one would be 1000.\n\nSo if you were to solve for your original number, you would want to divide 200,000 by two and find the remainder. That would give you 100,00 divided by two.\n\nThe answer is 50,000. You can check this on your calculator.\n\nInput: Dr Banks", "answer": "E: garden of eden"}

She is looking for a \n        donor today to give a $1,000,000 grant that will allow her to provide \n        meals for seniors for 1 year. The donor is looking for data showing \n        how much money they will help save the organization, assuming that it \n        can feed senior citizens for the next 1 year.\n        Your task is to calculate the savings per senior for 1 year.\n\"\"\"\n\n    Approach #1:\n    - Get the number of seniors served by the organization ($P(t)$), given a number of staff ($Q(t)$) and a number of meals served per day ($Q_t \\geq O_t$, where $O_t$ is the number of meals served without the aid of the grant). For example, let's say that the organization has a staff of 13 workers and serves 2,000 meals per day. Then, we could approximate $P$ as $Q$ times $Q_t$. Therefore, we could estimate $P$ as 2,004 workers times 2,002 meals per day or 4,008,480 meals per day (assuming the meals are served in the proper ratio, i.e. 2,001 per worker). Finally, let's say the staff members each work 5.5 hours per day, and that $S$ (seniors) is 5,000. Therefore $P$$S$ = 4,006,000 meal\n    Therefore, $S$ = 842 meal per worker, which the non-profit organization can serve a year.\n    Time: $=O(\\frac{Q_t}{S}) + O(P) = O(\\frac{2,002}{842}) + O(4,008,$480) = O(1.274971 + 5", "answer": "C: playroom"}

By the time I got to the doctors, I could hardly see out of my left eye. They diagnosed me with cataracts and made a surgery appointment the following week. Just before the surgery however, three of my friends from high school stopped by the hospital. Each of us had always taken a different lane, but we started talking about all the crazy things we had done as teenagers and how we had all become rich. After we got back on good terms, I realized I had a lot of money. All four cars in our garage were expensive ones, and I had to go to the bank every two weeks to pay for them. Then, two weeks before my surgery, my parents came to pick up me and my wife to show us one of the houses they had purchased for an upcoming vacation. They took us around to look at all of them. I wanted to buy one of these houses, so on the day of the surgery, I asked that my wife and I be treated on different days. They asked why. To do that, for each surgery they had to take my eyes out, and because they had been my eyes, as a favor to me they had decided to charge each patient the same amount. So, on the day of my surgery they could see that I was old, that I had become greedy, and they told me they couldn\u2019t afford to give me another one\u2014but as a favor they gave me one more eye, which was now useless.\n\nOutput: $100\n\nInput: 1.

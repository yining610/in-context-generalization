We might end up being sick from other dishes from the main menu but that is not what \u201cthe answer\u201d means. \u201cD\u201d is thus dismissed and we are now left with only \u201cE\u201d.\nSo let \u201cS\u201d be the feeling we have after eating the tasting menu\n\u201cfull stomach\u201d = 1/\u201cstomach\u201d \u201cstomach\u201d = 2/\u201cA stomach\u201d\n\n\u201cfull\u201d, \u201cstomach\u201d, and \u201cA stomach\u201d all refer to the same thing hence a number \u201c2\u201d is associated with both \u201cA stomach = 1\u2033 and \u201cfull = 2\u201d\nSimilarly \u201cB\u201d = 3/B \u201cB stomach\u201d hence \u201cC: gaining weight\u201d = 4/\u201cS gaining weight\u201d\nSince \u201cgaining weight\u201d is a subset of \u201cgetting full\u201d, \u201cfull\u201d is less than \u201cgetting full\u201d and hence \u201cgetting full\u201d = \u201cC: gaining\u201d > \u201cE: satisfaction\u201d\n\nLet \u201cW\u201d be the number associated with \u201csatisfaction\u201d\nSimilarly, \u201csatisfaction\u201d is a subset of the feeling we get after eating the taster menu, hence it is less than \u201cthe feeling we get after eaing taster menu\u201d which is W.\nWe have now determined that for every other answer but \u201cD\u201d and \u201cC\u201d,\nthe number associated with that response is greater than the number associated with \u201cD\u201d, which proves it must be either one of them\nLet us suppose \u201cD\u201d is the correct answer, then\nD = 6, because \u201csatisfaction\u201d = W = 6.\nThis proves that the correct answer is \u201cC: gaining Weight\u201d\nSo the final answer in the first question is 600.\n\nInput: Tess takes 3 hours and 45 minutes to complete one segment of a math assignment.

(For example, you may answer 190, 1900, or 190-and-2-cents, to name a few of the options).\n\nOutput: There were 7days in a week and 11 days. 190 days are 190\u00d77=<<190\u00d77-6>>190\u00d77\u00f73\u00f76=482.86 days (or you can say one day is almost 3 days.)\nBecause 11\u00d77/4=<<11\u00d77/7>>11\u00d711/7 = 15 days is 15\u00d77/4 = <<=15\u00d77/3>>15\u00d77/7.\nSo the final Answer is 482.85.\n\n\nInput: The first seven days were spent at the beach, and the balance of the time was spent sightseeing. If her total vacation cost was $603.95 (which included $482.87 spent on the rental car), what was the charge for the hotel room? (For example, if the answer is 235.08, you could answer 235 or 235.1, to name some of the options.)\n\nOutput: \tShe spends $482.08 on the rental car. 603.90 divided by 482.07 = $<<603.9/482-0.08=1.24>>1.24.\n11/1.24 = 8.75, so the hotel cost $482.9", "answer": "B: mall"}

If 750 of the females have children, how many males are in the town?\nOutput: The question asks how many males there would be in a population of 4500 but 1000 more females than males.\nSo we have 4500 females and 3500 males.\nNext, the question states '750' of these females have children.\nIf you divide this by the amount of males (the original ratio) you get 212.\nMultiply this by 3500 (the number of males in this city) you get 73300.\nDivide this by the original population of 4550 and you get 566.\nAdd this to your original 3500 and you get 9166.\nThis number is incorrect because females have always been a majority over males in every town ever.\n1000 more is still a difference.\nSo the correct answer is 4990 not 9166\n\nInput: At a circus, there are three clowns.

However, the salary increase comes with a 4% tax rate.  You also owe $7,500 in federal income taxes. How much would your net salary increase be after the increase and taxes?\nOutput:  First, the taxable salary increase is $17,292 (the original increase less the deduction of federal income tax). The salary increase is 4% of $17,230.  The tax rate is 13.3% due to a deduction, this is $2,318, and is 13.4% due to a deductions, this is $2323. The total taxes are $4,621.\nThe only calculation then is 4% of increase minus tax rate times original salary times increase. This is: $17,221 (increase after taxes) = $17,216 (increase) - $7,505 (tax) = $9,986 (increase after both)\nSo the final answer to the question is $9,985\n\nInput: A farmer drives his truck 300 km per day or 2160 km per week to get his animals from one field to another.

Since B > A,B can never be 0 (Since 0 can never be a factor of any integer).\nb and a will satisfy a > 0 and a < b\nSince b > 0. a < 0 can't be true.So if b > 0, it means, b < a (Since 0 cannot be a part of both the numbers).\nSuppose b is the Largest number out of b and a\nIf b is less than a, then b+1 = b-1 = b will be possible.  So b+1 = b will not satisfy the condition of 'Largest", "answer": "D: closet"}

If the price of tomatoes doubles each week, how much does a pound of tomatoes currently cost?\nOutput: The price doubles weekly. 6 + ((2*6) + ((6^2)) + (6^3) + ((6^4))) = 36\nSo 36/4 = <<36/4=9>>9\nSo the final answer 9\n\nInput: A farmer has three barns on his farm.  The first barn can hold a maximum of 48 sheep, the second barn can hold a minimum of 24 sheep, and the third holds a minimum of 22 cows. He is allowed to place a maximum of 40 cows, 5 sheep and 6 goats. How can the farmer place 51 animals on his farm?\nOutput: There is no way to place 51 animals unless the farmer adds a fourth barn. In that case, we put a maximum amount of sheep with a minimum amount of cows in the first barn. Then, put the remaining cows in the third barn. Lastly, put 50 animals (36 sheep + 14 cows + 2 goats + 3 rabbits) in the second barn.\nSo to answer the question of how the farmer placed the sheep with min cows etc...\nIn the first barn he has a maximum of 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 sheep and a minimum of 2 cows that are in there because of the min cows. In the third barn he has a minimum of 2 sheep and a minimum amount of crows. The last place is the second barn.

Your friend has a dozen crabs totaling 15 pounds and wants to find out how much everything will cost.  How much does the entire cost add up to in dollars?  Answer: The total will be $105.\nOutput: Your friend has 12 crabs totaling $7/pound ($7 x 12) = $84.\nTaylor has told you that the total cost is $105; you have to figure out how much each crab costs.\n$84/12 = <<84/12=$6.75>>6.75\n$105/12 = <<105/105=$1>>1\n$105=$6.75+$1 \nSince $6.75 is less than $7, $7/12 has to be a multiple of $6.75.  $7/12=3  and since 3/12 = 4/12, your friend ends up spending an extra $4.\nSo the total cost ends up being $105.  $105/$12=<<105/$105=$105/1>>9.5.\nSo the final result is $9.5\n\nInput: An art critic is writing a review for a local art gallery.

Each person inherits genes from a mix of his parents genes, and so he may inherit the genes for brown hair,  two eyes, and brain.  He may have any or all of these genes.  However, in the last 170 years, more and more people are getting married and mating with only those in their extended family and their extended family.  Because of this, people have come to view their neighbors, relatives and people in their town as members of the same family simply because they have been mating with them for several generations.

She loves swimming for 6 minutes, but has to take a break every 6 minutes to catch her breath. On each of her 6 minute stints, she swims 3 minutes back and forth, and the remaining 3 minutes in a single direction.  If on the entire trip, Tally swam 171,400 meters, how long did her journey last?\nOutput: The question says that she takes breaks every 6 minutes.  After every 6 minutes, she swims 12 minutes in one direction and 15 minutes in the other direction, and if she swims 171, 400 meters in every 6 minutes, then in 6 minutes she swims 11, 344,000 meters.\nSince she swims 15 minutes in one direction and then 12 minutes in the other, she swims the same number of meters when she goes only in one direction.  So 11,344,040/2 = 36,370,020m.  In total she has 171,000 plus half of 36", "answer": "D: vegetable"}

After 6, what number should come next?  2.  There are 4 more in the set of numbers 10, 20, 30, \u2026 What number comes next?\nOutput: The correct answer to part 1 is \u201c34\u201d  There are 5 digits after the \u201c4\u201d so our guess is between 34 and 44.  We don\u2019t know what comes next so we can narrow it down.  We know there were 5 digits before the 2 so our guess is from 6 to 24 which leaves us with the options 7, 11, 14, 17, and 20.  Choosing 14 which is a multiple of 2 to ensure our answer is divisible by 2 we have the number 34. The correct answer to part two is \u201c85\u201d.  There are 8 digits in the set of numbers where the next number  in line is 85.  We know there are 8 digits after the 6 so our guess is between \u201c34\u201d and 24, which leaves us with the number \u201c34, 38, 42, 46, 50, 54, 58, and 62\u201d.  Choosing 38 (the 6th digit in the set) gives us 18 digits.  But the answer to 2 is actually 18 so our chosen guess is not the answer.  So our next guess is \u201c42\u201d which gives us 16 digits.  But the next number in the set is \u201c46\u201d giving us 15 digits.

The seller will provide change but to the nearest whole penny, and in coins only so the seller won't be wasting money! Here's what happens: You get ten cents as change back for two quarters if you buy an item for a dollar. If you buy an item for exactly four quarters, you get no change whatsoever. For an item that costs $2.50, you get $0.30 but for an item that costs exactly $2.40 you get $0.20.  What is the smallest number of dimes that you can buy something for? Choice: A: $9.20 - C: $2.60 B: $6.05 - D: $2.65 E: $6.25 F: $2.45\nOutput: How to calculate if one can buy an item for $6.25 exactly or exactly for $6.20. You have to use the coin combinations 1Q = 10c, 2Q = 20c, 3Q = 30c, 4Q = 40c, 5Q = 50c. If the price plus the change is exactly $6.20, you can get the coin in the list below.

You are unable to get 20c to cover the 2Q which means that the item must be smaller than $6.20 but not a whole dollar.

So 0.003m = 600/2,000,000. So it drops by 0.06m/d.\nMeaning that it takes 24d so for m = 0.006m/day. Hence, d=0.006*24 = 0.0144d days\nHence, h = 0.06*0.014 = 0.1008m\nh=.0811m, which means 0.8m\nSince the radius of the ballon is 0.1, it will drop by.01=1/10th\nHence, min(h)=0.01h\nmin(h)?=0.01*0.0811=0.00811d=8.2d=8hours and 2mins, approx 8.2minuets.\nSo the final answers should be 8.2\n\n\nInput: A store is giving out free items to each customer who spends more than $30.

The median points to the exact center of the list since it is the exact middle value.   The median will be the sum of the middle two values.   Since there is no exact middle value, take the average of the middle two values and you have an approximate median.   The median is the value exactly in the middle.   A median does not have to be in the middle of a list when it can be moved to the center to make things simpler.   The median represents the average of the middle values of the list.   If the list is in alphabetical order, you can find the median by looking for the middle letter.

A: Canada B: England C: Mexico D: USA\nOutput: If the game is aired in the US a lot of people will watch it there because it is a US TV network.\n\n### Answer the following multiple choice question in a paragraph\n\nThe problem we were given was to find the total number of children in a family, where the girls out number the boys at a 7:5 ratio, and the boys receive a total of $3900 (which can be divvied up by the boys equally) to distribute among themselves. We then had to find the total cost of the ambulance ride and the total of medical equipment costs.\n\nStarting off with the first part of the problem we were able to come up with the following answer.  From the ratio of girls to boys we could see that if we took all the boys together and divided by the girls, the boys share was exactly 5/12 times the number of boys.  The number of girls was equal to the rest, so therefore 5/12 = 16/24 of the total cost, $3900.  Now as for the total of boys we could now see that the boys equal a total 180 and $3900 divided by 180 = $21.11.   For the next step it is now easy to find out what the number of boys it is that received this amount.  In order to make the boys equal, the remaining $1788.89 was divided among the number of boys and it resulted in $1788/180= $10.06\n\nFor the next part of the problem the first thing we need to figure out is the cost of the ambulances.  The problem states that the medication cost 50000% of 2500 (the cost of the entire bill minus the cost of the ambullance).  Taking this information we can plug all the values into the equation to get:\n \t  50000x2500= $550000\n\t  $5500 is the cost of medication.\nAs for the overnight stays, they cost 2500/", "answer": "D: train station"}

It is important to note that the number of decimal places is not divisible by 4 (2+2=4) because 1 x 6 does not have a multiple equal to 6.\nTherefore, the answer is not possible in this instance.", "answer": "A: think"}

Find the ratio that represents a total of 28 hours for each workday, in fraction/decimal notation.(Hint: The total work hours needed is 28 total workdays = <<28 total workdays=1>>1 week. This ratio can also be expressed as days-per-week-per-workday,  where each workday is 8 total hours and each workday is done 2 days per week. Therefore, the answer should come out to be one-eighth =  \"one over eight\" or <<1/.8=12>>1 fraction.)\nOutput: The ratio represents a total of 1 total workday for each total workday.  28 total days = <<28 total days=1>>1 week\nFor each total workday, there are 8 hours of work. Thus, 28/8 = <<28/8=3>>3 workdays for that total workday.\nIn this fraction/decimal notation, the answer is <<1/.8= 1/8>>1/8 which is equal to 12\nSo the final of answer is 12\n\nInput: On March 10, a 7.6 earthquake struck New Madrid, MO.

How many students were surveyed?\nOutput: At first, we don't know the answer, so the question needs to be rewritten as: 49% of surveyed students like their school.  Among those students, 50% like the school while 25% don't.  How many students were survey.\nSo then among our total students, 424 of 500 (85% of them) like their school.  This leaves 50% - 85% = 15%, 15/25 = 6%, of students who don't like their school.\nNow, divide our total students (500) by this number: 500/6%=80 students like their school, while 425 of those liked their school, so that makes the number of students who doesn't like their school to 75\nSo now, we subtract the number of students who like their school from our original number to find the number of students who don' know.\nOur original answer is 49/100 * originalStudentCount = <<49/10=49>>49\nWe only found 38% who's satisfied with their school.\nSo, let x = 49\nThen 1-x = <<1-49=51>>51/2 => 51/25\n38% of 51 / 25 = <<38/51/25=19>>19/10 students don't like their schools\nWe don't know the total number of students that's why we put it to 500\nSo the total amount of students is: 500-19 =<<500-1=481>> 481\nSo the final answer the correct answer is 481\n\nInput: Melanie\u2019s grandmother has a", "answer": "C: brother's house"}

If she cuts the loof vertically, she gets two pieces, each with half of the loaf. If she has a loaf of bread that weighs one pound, how much does each piece of bread weigh?\nOutput:Let x = 1 pound and let y be a quantity to be found.\nFor each piece of bread, we divide it into two pieces, each with one half.  Thus, y = 0.5x = <<0.5x=0.5>>0.5x.  Since she had 6 pieces, we add the 6 values together to obtain 6y = 6*y = <<6*y=6y>>6y.\nFrom 1pound divided by 6 pieces, we find that each piece weighs 16 ounces (16 oz = x/6).  To find y (0.5x), we solve for y and find that it is the same value as x/6 so y = <<y=x/6>>x/6 so for each piece of bread, it weighs 1/6 of a pound, which means each piece weighs one fifth (o/5) of a pound.\nThe total weight is 0.5*x = <<0.3*x=0.3*x>>0.3*x.  Multiplying the number of pieces by the total weight will yield 0.3*x*6 = <<0.3x*6=3.3x/6>>3.3/6*x/6, which is 0.525/6 = <<0.525*6=0.33*6>>0.33x/6.

In one day, 5120 tickets were sold. What was the total ticket price collected of that day\nOutput: There are a total of 5120 seats available.  The price of tickets in the upper section is 1/2 of the base price in the upper section so that\u2019s 65/2 = $<<65/2=32.5>>32.5$ and that is the price one seat would cost in the upper section.\nThe price of tickets in each section is as follows:\nHighest Price: Upper section ($32.5).\nLowest Price: Lower section ($12).\nThe highest ticket price for $32.5 is in the upper section.  Similarly, the lowest ticket for $12 is in the lower section.\n\nThis means that the highest ticket price less the lowest price is:\nHighest Price - Lowest Price = $32.5 - $12 = <<32.5-12= 20>>20$.\n\nThe total amount collected from ticket sales that day is:\n5120 * $20 = <<5120*20=102400>>10240 $\n\nSince it was the day the stadium was named after the president, we know that the total amount was $10240$.\nSo the final answer here is $1024$.\n\nInput: A 15 m long box is placed between two 15 m long walls.

The money raised by the bake sales will be divided up in the following proportions, based on the school, and how many bake sales the school held: 10%, 35%, 10%, and 35%.  With this information, what is the total amount that will be raised by the fourth school?\nOutput:The fourth school has the smaller proportion of the profit.  They made 10% of the total funds raised, and therefore, their percentage of the funds raised is.1.  Subtract.1 times the profit raised from each school (.45) and subtract the result from.10, which is the amount given for each of the bake sales.   That gives: $(1-(.10-(.45))=<<(1-(.10-.45))=0.45>>0.45\nSubtract $1 from that, which is the original price and that's your total!\nSo the final answer $1.45\n\nInput: In 1994 the National Park Service began to keep official records of who visited national parks.  The largest number of people on record visited Great Falls National Park. The second most visited was Shenandoah National Park, and the third most visited was Yellowstone National Park. But which park received the fourth largest number of visitors?  Is there a chance it was Rock Creek Park, or was it any one of the other parks listed here?\nOutput: The question asks whether Park 'n' or 'k' has seen its fair share, or whether the number of visitors was enough to satisfy its residents who were already there.  No,  there are still some people living there.  We can conclude that these parks have not reached their carrying capacity.\nIf park 'k'  had the fourth most visitors, that means that it received between 750 and 1500 visitors.  Since park 'f' is higher numbered than park 'k', park 'k' got less visitors than park 'f'.  However, park 'k' received more visitors than any of the two remaining parks, so park", "answer": "D: shopping malls"}

How many days will it eat your dog food?\nOutput:\nThis is an Easy Problem since you can plug in numbers.\nIn this example, you can plug in numbers to help you.\nWe know that the puppy jumps up to get the couch and runs 10 times before we feed them because it will jump up and land on the couch in 2 seconds. Thus, the dog will take one second to jump up and one second to land.\nWe also know that the dog will eat once every 12 times you feed it. This makes it so that the puppy will eat once every 2 seconds.\nTo put this in terms of days, you can plug this into: n(2 seconds)/n(12 seconds) = 5 days\nWe know that this equals 5 because it will eat once every 5 seconds.\nThus, the dog will eat five times a day every day until the puppy dies.\n\nEasy Problems:\nAll the math has been done for you.

Every 5 minutes trains travel 5 miles, and between station A and station B they travel 45 minutes. Which of the following trains leaves first for station B from station A? A 5:45 or 6:00 train departs, B the 7:20 train departs, C the 7:30 train departs, D the 8:10 train departs, E the 5:10 or 5:15 train departs.\nOutput: The train leaves the station at 5:45 AM to travel to station B.\nThe train leaves the station at exactly 5:45 to travel to station B after it has already traveled down the 300 miles to reach station A. The train has traveled at exactly 100 miles per hour from station A to station B. So by the clock it was traveling at 100 MPH for 2:00 hours or 200 miles, when 200 miles per hour is equal to 6:00 minutes according to the clock. This is a total of 6:00=300 miles so it has 150 miles to go so by the clock it traveled 300+150=<<300+12=450>>450 mile or 450 =<<72>>72 minutes so 72 = 5 or 7:20AM was the time when it actually left\nSo the final Answer was D\n\nInput: You want to", "answer": "B: charming"}

Points are chosen that are equidistant from points O and P, respectively.  What is the measure of D?\nOutput: Line B being perpendicular to x-axis.   We know that the distance from D to P will be the same as that from D to O.  The distance from D to O is 20, so the distance from D to every point is half of that which is 10.\nAlso this distance is 10 from O and P so D is the midpoint.  From the midpoint, line B will be parallel to x-axis which means that the point is 10 from both O and P along the same line.\nSo the measures of D will be 10, the distance from 10 to both O and P.\nSo the final measure of D will be 25 degrees.\n\nInput: A circle with a radius of 4 inches is inscribed in a square with vertices at the four corners of the square.

There are four characters in the game: the murderer, the victim who is the target of a murder, the suspect who suspects the other players, and the real player.  However, players\u2019 roles are unknown and the characters are randomly drawn.  The game is started by playing the music CD \u201cMurder in the Abbey.\u201d The murderer is the first player to draw.  First players are also exempted from drawing cards for the suspect role. However, the murderer cannot draw both victim and suspect roles as well as a character who is an item that provides advantage like a gun.  The board game plays for several rounds until the murderer is caught.  Each round of the game is won by a player who can put the role and the character in the same category together while using proper grammar in his or her sentence.  Every round is scored by the victim and the suspect before ending the round.  The rules for a round are as follows. 1)  No more than one time is allowed to be repeated per round. 2) A round is won if a character role is matched with a suspect. If it is matched with the victim, the murderer is caught and the game is over. 3) If more than one sentence is said at the same time, the murderer is still not caught but the round is not won. And the game continues to the next round. However, the last sentence said wins each round.  As for the sentence, the only rule is that sentence is written in correct grammar.

Additionally we know that the military base is not a fire station \u2013 so that leaves us only with either that bus stop (from earlier) or a water fountain.

The difference is exactly 20%.\nOutput: The visitor wants to ride the roller coaster and if he gets to ride the rollercoaster that means the roller coaster was open.\nThat means the roller coater was closed.\nRoller coasters can close if the weather changes or other issues.\nIf the roller coaster closes, the visitor has to wait until the weather clears and the roller coaster reopens.\nTherefore, we can find the difference between the likeliness of the roller coater being open and the food court being open by subtracting the likelihood of the visitor going to the food court if the roller coater closed.\nWe can also find the likeliness of a roller coaster being on by subtracting the likeliness of if the visitor does not ride the roller coater, which would mean that they would also have to eat elsewhere (eat at the food court).\nDifference between roller coaster being closed and visitor not riding the roller coaster:\nIf the visitor rides the roller coater then the roller coaster is open\nLikeliness of roller coaster being opened: 1\nLikeliness of visitor riding the rollercoaster: 0.

She decided she was going to do the following:\n\nIf she was offered to borrow money with an interest rate of 35% per year, she would loan no more than $150.00 at the 35% interest rate.\nIf borrowed that amount, she would pay the interest when the loan matures on June 12 at the regular quarterly interest rate.  \nShe would not pay the interest if she borrowed less.\nOn June 12, after paying the interest, she would repay what was borrowed plus a bit more on to reduce the future interest charges.\nIn this way, she would pay a 4% annual rate of interest over the life of the loan.\nWhat should the borrower do if he is offered to loan money at an interest rate of 25% per year?\nOutput: First Kendall decides if the interest rate given is higher than 35% she would lend no more than 150*1.17=<<150*117=175>>175 dollars.  Here she decides she should pay interest to reduce the rate it is a good deal to borrow from\n\nSo 175 dollars  Interest = 0.25*175 = 44.08 dollars so she would pay 44.00 dollars\n\nSo in the problem if the interest is at a rate lower than 25% she can borrow 250.00 dollars at a rate of 4%", "answer": "E: eyes opening"}

The total distance in miles from the starting point of the expedition to the destination where they were rescuers equals two-thirds the difference between the distance from the starting point to the ending point and the distance from the ending point of the expedition back on shore.  What was the distance of the starting and ending points?\nOutput:To find what was the distance of the two-points on the map from each other, you have to convert the miles to meters for a simple addition.\nThe distance traveled by the polar ship was 5400 miles. This is the starting point + 27 = <<27=5400>>5427\nSo the distance from the starting to ending point is <<5427+27=5454>>5454\nNow they were taken out 27 miles by an arctic current.  So after you deduct 5454 to 27, you now get 5427, which is close to <<5427=<<5454-5427=27>>27>>27\n\n27 is subtracted from 27 to get zero because you are adding the exact distance on the map for their rescuing. So now you have 27-27=<<27-27=-27>>27 \n\nWhich is the exact distance between their two-points on the coast line as they were rescued.\n>>= <<27-27=&nbsp-27>>27=27\n\nSo the distance of the two points is 27 miles away from each other.\n\nSo the final answer would be:  >>27 miles away from 27.\n\nInput:In a 6", "answer": "C: transistor"}

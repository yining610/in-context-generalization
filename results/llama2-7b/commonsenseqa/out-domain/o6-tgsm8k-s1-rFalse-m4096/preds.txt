In this story, there are 2 monkeys and a snake. The monkeys are jumping on the top of a pole and trying to get to the coconut that is at the bottom of the pole. Each monkey has certain skills and the snake is very lazy and needs to eat something. He is standing under the pole waiting for the monkeys to fall so he can go and eat them. The monkey on the top of the pole will continue to jump as long as he/she has the strength. If a monkey is able to make it to the coconut, he/she will get the coconut. If the monkey is still at the beginning though, then his/her energy runs out and he/she falls. Once he falls, a small snake crawls out from hiding and licks him for fun.  Which skill should both the monkeys use to help them get to the coconuts before they fall to the bottom of the pole? Choice 1: The monkey has to jump more than 3 poles. Choice 2: The snake needs to eat something. Choice 3: The monkey can't jump while the snake is at the pole bottom. Choice 4: The monkeys don't need to get the coconut, just to jump more than 10 time.

To win, players race to make as many matches of stone and symbol as possible.Players take a symbol out of their stone hand, then make a match by placing it onto one of the matching 10 stones in front of them. Each stone has two sides and each side can have one of 30 symbols displayed next to it. Players can pick any of the three symbols in the stone, but players can pick the same symbol only if they are on the same side.If you make a match with a stone, you can keep it. But if instead you make three matches of stones and symbols with any of the three symbols on the stones, the symbols stay there for you to use later.You can play these stones even if you don’t use them to make a match.When a player picks, both players have to check and make sure that the symbols in the player’s hand are the same number as the symbols on their side of the stone and that the stone is not already in play.The rules get more complicated because it is not necessarily the same player’s turn to pick.Each player has a score card and has to remember how many stone matches they’ve made, how many stones are in play, and how many stones they have left in their hand.-What is the fastest way a player may make a match?  A:  the same two stones are across from each other.  B:  one stone must be across from another stone.  C:  one stone has a symbol and is next to a symbol on one of its neighbors.  D:  there must be one stone that has a symbol but no symbol to its left.  E:  only stone that has two symbols.<n>Output: A

Not sure about the order of operation on this one. But I think you would have to first know the price (lets say the price of each large sticker) and then count the total number of sticker for each page, which gives you the number of pages with one large sticker and subtract the same for other pages (with multiple stickers) to get the number of pages with just one sticker. You then need to subtract the total number of pages with large stickers and subtract the total number of large stickers from the number of remaining stickers to get the total number of stickers remaining. Hope this makes sense...<n><n>## Question 3:<n>---<n>D<n><n>## Question 4:<n>---<n>I don't think this is a logic problem<n><n>## Question 5:<n>---<n>A<n><n>## Question 6:<n>---<n>C<n>

It's not that hard to understand once you really give it some thought. You just have to remember your fifth-grade arithmetic skills. Are you ready?<n>The question is, if a son is born in January, what is the chance that his dad was born in February? This should be a no-brainer. Let's start by figuring out which month a son is most likely to be born in. Obviously, the father cannot be born in the same month. So if a father is born in the summer months, it is less likely for his child to be born in the same season. If you follow the logic through all the winter months, a child is more likely to be born when the father was born, and when a son is born in the same month as his dad, the chance increases by 100%. With that in mind, how was your answer?<n><n><n>[Your answer]:<n>

People from overseas and the Northeast arrived all over the country, searching for land and employment. As the population rose, farming land became scarce. Farmers worked on the land because they knew no other work; it was all they knew, and it was the only work they could earn. But these farmers worked for little pay. Their families became dependent on them, and farmers saw no way out of their dilemma.<n><n>In 1836, in eastern Ohio, a group of six young men were listening to someone read a newspaper clipping. The article described the effects of the Great Depression in England, where there were thousands of homeless people. The men were thinking, _why should there not be farmers who lived better?_ What if _we_ could find a way to live better? _Let's try for ourselves,_ they decided. They formed a club, or secret society, and began meeting regularly to share ideas and plan for a better future. They called themselves the "Perfectionists."<n><n>After six months of studying and thinking, the Perfectionists developed a business plan. They decided to start a community, a place where they all could work together to achieve their shared goal. They would be self-motivated, with a firm set of rules to abide by. One of their goals was to provide for everyone's needs; the idea was that everyone could do something to support the farm. It would work well if they knew how to do everything—and _that's_ what they decided to teach each other. They would teach each other how to farm, build a house, raise cattle, and more. In return, everyone would work together to build community and live a successful life. This became known as "The Community of Perfection," or _The Shakers._<n><n>The Shakers' farms grew wheat, corn, and other crops, and they worked to make the products they needed to survive and flourish—products like quilts, furniture, brooms, baskets, and hats. The Shakers used what they produced in their communities, but they also sold what their farms could not consume. Their businesses

The altitude is halfway between the surface and the center of the earth measured in a unit called an altitude level.  To reach the surface, the altitude of the plane will need to decrease by a level, but the plane only has enough fuel to do it another time and a half as it is now.  You can have the pilot go straight down the center of the earth if you want, but there are no other planes in the area and you don't know if you wouldn't crash.  He will take the shortest path down the center of the planet that he can, but he will have to turn to go south at some point of the descent.  What is the shortest possible route he can take down without crashing when he finds some obstruction on the plane's way down and needs to turn to the south?<n>Output:<n>```<n>Because you're on a plane that is going down into the Earth's core  there are no other  planes, the path will take you across only 3 lines  of longitude  (180,120,0).  The  plane will turn to the south at 120 (120E),  but all of the  rest of the plane's maneuvers will be to the south (0S) and (−180,−90,−60,−30,−15,0,60,90,120).  All of the maneuvers would fit onto  the plane's path (120E, 0S, −180E, −90S…….., (+120E, +60S, 0E, +90E, +150S)…………) except it's a "shortest possible  route" problem, for which the plane will always continue going south past the second place where it could turn (0S) to the third place where it could turn,  which would be 180E then 90S.  Therefore, the required path of maneuvers will need to be:<n><n>```

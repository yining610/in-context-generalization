{"idx": 27, "text": "He could have keep going his body appreciated the the rest he had been constantly what at?\n\nAnswer: So, we are asked the question, \"How can I put this sentence in context?\"  First, there is no question mark at the end of the question, so it appears to be simple declarative sentence.  If there is no punctuation or question mark, then it is assumed to be a question.  Second, the sentence has a definite grammatical flaw in that the \"it\" refers to a body of something.  To make this make sense, it has to be referring to a body, such as someone's body that works constantly during the day.  This may seem like such a simple grammar question, but unfortunately it is not in most schools in the United States.  The sentence is not grammatically correct, so it becomes necessary to rephrase to where it becomes a question.  The reason \"lay down\" and \"working\" are not correct options is because the grammatical subject of the sentence is \"body\".  As such, either they are not working as a body in the sense that they are either a human or a group of human and not working together, or else the grammar makes it clear that a body of something is working, not working, or laying down.\n\nAnswer: Now we need to answer the question, \"What action do the subjects take during the day?\"  We are given the answer right away in the sentence which says \"Though he could' ve kept going his body appreciated...\"\nThough indicates that the something was on the verge of doing something else and stopped, such as continuing up a mountain, continuing to work, etc.  \"He\", then refers to a person.  The question mark may be there to indicate that though stopped doing the other thing, he didn't stop working, and so it is a question as to the other thing stopped.  So, that leaves one thing: laying down as the definite grammatical foul of the sentence.\nThen we need to figure out what actions the subjects took during the day other than laying down. So, \"What is it?\"  The body.  So the whole sentence is about what the body did during the day.  It did not lay down.  It does not work or rest.\nThere are only three real options so far: move, exercise, working.  The moving and exercising are out", "answer": "D: moving"}

So since there was 10.5 hours of total \"talking\" time, 1,2,4, and 7.5 were the lengths of conversations, I would just split the talking time by adding all those numbers and multiplying it by 10.5, so 1+4+2+7+5/10.5=51\nSo the total number of conversations would be 4*5 + 2*5+ 7*5 + 1*5 / 10.5= <<4*5+2*5+7*5+1*5/10.43=24>>24\nNow do the math for time: 4*5/105 = <<4*5/14=2/7>>2/7, then 2/7*2375 = <<2/7*27/5=27/5=54>>54, then 2/54 = <<2/54=1/27>>1/27, and then 1/27*3000 = <<1/27*27/100=27/103=26.96>>26.96, which rounds to 27, so", "answer": "B: feel good"}

We put \"a\" for the number of apples and \"b\" for the number of oranges so the question becomes \"a\" is four times \"b\"  \"b\" is two the number of \"a\" so we solve the equation \"b = 2*a\" and we get \"b = 4a\". Then \"b\" is four times \"a\" because \"b\" is four \"a\" that means that there are four \"a\" in the basket. We put it \"a\" equals to \"6\" that is four \"a\" so there are 4*12 in the basket that means 48.\n\nInput:When Sarah's friends are  asleep, she leaves her room for", "answer": "A: prison"}

I had passed you so you were far behind me. I was going the wrong direction. When you passed me and started going the right direction you were going 65 miles an. This is why I could tell the difference in times because we were both driving the same speed. If we start at exactly the same place and I begin to drive 65 miles an for an hour and you start driving the same way as me, at the end of my one hour I\u2019ll have driven 65 miles, but you will have driven 65 x 2 = <<65*2=130>>130 miles. If I am driving the wrong way, as soon as you start driving the same speed as me, you will pass me and I\u2019ll no longer be in front of you. This is why I was able to measure the time difference when we were in different places because the difference in distance is so large I would be able to observe the difference between us.\nOutput: You start at point A an begin to drive towards point B for an hour. When point C approaches point B, you begin driving in the right direction again, but by then, point C\u2019s distance from point B is such that it is too far away to be able to observe it in time to drive to your left. Thus, your two trips from point A to point B must be considered individually: one from point A to point C and another from point C to point B. In each of your trips, the difference in the distance between the final point and the initial point is equal to your initial speed. So if your trip from point A to point b takes you 2 hours, then your speed is 30 miles/hour. Since each of your trips is equal in duration to 2 hours, then they are both equal to 120 miles, which means that the distance between point A", "answer": "C: lark"}

This means, her salary - her tax.  Since her tax is 20% she will pay $49 again as tax.  We will then multiply by 0.2 and see if our solution is larger.  It should.   We will go with (Total Income - Her Total Tax).\nNow then, her total income was: (Total salary + Tax) = <<Total salary + Tax>>\nSince her total income was total salary (no tax in here yet) + Tax = {(49+T) + T}\nIf we find T, then we can substitute it for Tax.  If Tax is T, then 50*(1 + T/39)\nWhen we multiply and group, we got a value of 67.125\nHer income is then ((1838 + 67.13) - 49) *.20 = (1838 +.14421 - 9.8) *.20.\nWhen we group and reduce, we got a total of 1859.414375.\nSince this choice said there is a whole number, go with the closest number.

The virus first copies itself on to files that reside in the user\u2019s profile folder. Then, it begins to replace files in the user\u2019s home folder. Increasingly, it copies itself into directories that reside under the user\u2019s profile and home folders. When it has replaced all of the target files, it spreads it virus to other systems on the same network by copying onto a network share.  In one week, a computer has a total of 1,0,10,50,300 files on their local drive and it also has 40 files on a shared network drive.

You plan to sell one of the TVs at 5% below what you paid and the other for $10 more than you paid. You wish to make $100 profit on each TV and would like to pay as little as possible for the TVs. What is the largest amount you could spend on the two TVs? You know that you would like to buy two 20\" TVs since they are so much cheaper than bigger TVs.\n\nOutput:The first thing you need to do is find the price of two 20\" tv's. Let A and D be the cost of 1 20\" tv. Then 2A=A+D. And B can be the total cost of two 20's. Then let TVCost be the price of one 20\" tv, then 2TVCost is the price of the two. And the difference between the two is the profit of $100. So the problem is solved by finding the maximum TVCost that allows us to make the profit.\nLet 100/2=C. Thus 1TVCost=2TVCost+C. Which means that TVCost is the max of 100-C. Since C=2TVCost-100. Then it doesn't matter what TVCost ends up being.\nNow we just plug in TVCost and C into 1TVCost=.2(2TVCost+C) or 1TVCost=.4(2TVCost+100).

There is 6.5 billion gallons of water in the earth's oceans.  If the oceans cover 29% of the earth's surface, then how much of the earth's area does the water cover?\nOutput: Since the earth is 29% covered by water, the water takes up the remaining 71% = 100%-29% so (6/100)*71%=61.5%.\n71% is a decimal, which we can round to the closest even number, so 71%=<<71%=4.9>>4.9 and we must multiply it by 6 so  (6/(4.9))*71%=<<4.9*71%=327.4%\nSince 327.4%=100, that is how much water is in the earth's ocean, so the earth's area covered in water is 100% or (100-29)/100 = <<100-28=72>>71%.\nSo the final answer would be 72%\n\nInput: In a math test, 0 points and 100 points are considered passing grades.

What fraction of the whole circle is contained within those 5 spokes - that is, what fractional part of total circle is represented by those 5 spokes?\nOutput: To calculate the answer for problem 199, one must first calculate the radius of the wheel's 4th white spoke and 5th white spoke. The wheel's radius is given by:\nr_1 = r_5 = <<r_5=1/5>>1/5.\nSo we will calculate the radius of the two 5th spokes.\nUsing the equation: r^2 + r * b = a^2, where r is the radius and b is the circumference divided by 2.\nr_5 = b/2 = 1/5\nr^2 + r * 1/5 = 1/25\nr^2 = 22/25 = <<22/25=1>>1\nr = <<1/10>>1/10\nThus, the radius of the fourth white spoke and the fifth white spoke is <<r_4=r_5=1>>1.\nNow, the circular portion that falls within the given 5 spokes is given by the areas:\n1/5 + 1/5 + 3/5 + 3x.5 + 1/25 = <<1/5+1/5+3/5+3x.5+1/25=7/25>>7/25\nThe given solution: (4/25) + (2/5) + (8/25) + 4 + 1 = <<(4/25)+(2/5)+(8/25)+4+1=11/25>>11/25\nSo the correct answer for the problem is given by the expression \\((4/", "answer": "D: human being"}

Virtual machines allow you to run different operating systems (OS) on top of your local machine without changing the hardware at all. An example of this are iOS apps. The iPhone and iPad run apps specifically designed for iOS. But behind the curtain, they're just virtual machines on top of the OS X operating system.  How does this process work? What's going on when an iPhone runs an app, for example?\nOutput: Virtual machines (VM) emulate real physical machines. They run underneath a more powerful (and more vulnerable) operating system.  When an iPhone runs an app that is designed to run on iOS, it does not literally need to emulate the actual architecture of iOS, because it can use a simulated version of the actual system.\nFor example, iOS runs on an x86 CPU. iOS applications are compiled for the iPhone and this requires that the application is compiled for ARM CPUs. This is because the emulator simulates the actual processors that apps will run on when actually installed on your phone.  iOS apps are also compiled for ARM because the architecture of the CPUs in iOS phones isn\u2019t all that different from the hardware in your phone. They are compiled to run on an ARM for the emulator.\nIf the app is designed to run on other CPU architectures, it needs to be compiled with a compiler that supports multiple architectures. There is a program called libGCC which is a C compiler with support for multiple CPU architectures. This allows developers to compile an app, which can run under either OS X or iOS.\nSo the final Answer is iPhone applications\n\nInput: Suppose that the population of a certain city is distributed according to a Bernouli distribution with parameter \u03bb = 10", "answer": "E: ireland"}

But let us suppose a potato comes from a casserole or d/4.  Then to get the potato out of the casserole (which is d/4)  will require a door that allows the volume change to be d/4+d/4=d.  If the total space is d then the potato will be d/2 big.  But let us now suppose the door allows this volume change to be d and the potato can be returned.  In that case we get d/4=d/2.

Well, this statement is flawed a bit because we also need to factor that the price will be reduced from what it is to account for the promotional discount. It can be shown, if for every 4 bought, 1 is free then the total cost will be 4*$1800-$1780=$400.\nThus, the price reduction required to reduce the price to $1780, the same as the original price in the superstores case will be $1800-$400=$1400.

For the first choice I chose relax because i believe most people know how to relax, but the question could also say \"What prevents someone from falling asleep\" If that was the question I would then answer restlessness.\nI picked answer A for the second question because I do not know what people have when they are awake, so I assumed they were dreams.  This led to answer choice C, I think restlessness is a key factor why some people do not get sleep at night.  I would choose answer D, because most people do not know the exact reason they can't sleep at night, and people are getting diagnosed with restlessness.\n\nFor the third question I thought, what is dreams?  I thought answers A and B would be the correct answer because i believe nightmares are a type of dream.  But for the fourth choice I thought it was about snore because it is a factor that prevents someone from getting sleep, not the result.  Also if you pick this answer and then move to answer B's question, you can connect the two results that prevents people from getting sleep.\n\nFor the answer choice question I thought a dream is in the past while sleep is in the present.

Let's take, for example, the sequence 3056, 2949, 2842,....  How to find the next number in this progression:\n\nIf we multiply -3 by 5 (next digit  = 3 * 5), we will get -15.\n\nIf we multiply 0 * 6 (next digit = 0 * 6), we get 0.\n\nIf we add -2 to -7 (next digit = -2+(-7)) we get --9.\n\nIf we multiple -9 * 5, we will get -45.\n\nIf these numbers are divided by 4 and rounded down, you get: -45 / 4 = 11 1/4. Finally the next number in the progression is 3056 - 2949 = 107.\n\nIf we divide 3056 by 2, we get: 3056/2 * 10 = 1528. As mentioned above, 3*5 = 15; 0*6 = 0; -2+(-7) = -9; -9*5 = -45. If these numbers are divided by  4 and rounded down,    we see the pattern.\n\nSo I believe the next number is: 291 - 107 = 184. The number sequence starts with:\n\n291, 184, 92, 46", "answer": "C: music class"}

{"text": "The correct answer is A: gain weight.\n\n#### Instruction\nA: gain weight --> if he was eating lunch and he was rushing. The next time he would probably eat lunch he would be late for work since lunch would make him late for work.\n\n#### Input:\nThe man was eating a sandwich and drinking a big cola in the break room at work. It was his lunch break, so he didn't mind. But when he looked at his wristwatch he saw he had only fifteen minutes left. That would barely be enough time to eat lunch and get to his office. He ate as fast as he could and then ran through the halls, past his office door without even stopping to say hi to the secretary. He barely got to his seat by the time the first customer made it into the waiting room and slammed down a list of complaints about a recent purchase.\n\n#### Output:\nHe rushed because his time for lunch was up. If he had started faster than he did he would have made it to his office on time. However, his rash of being late for work probably would have gotten him fired. So, we can assume that it was the best decision for him to be late for work instead of be rude to his first customer.\n\n#### Instructions\nPlease answer the questions.\n\nHow much should you pay for a 2 day pass at the resort?\n\nPrice $375\n\nQuestion: Does \u2e19150\u00d72 day\u2e19 = \u2e19$150/day\u00d72 days = $300\u2e17\n\nPrice $350\n\nQuestion: Does  \u2e1925\u00d72 day \u2e17 = \u2e1925/day\u00d72 days    = $50\u2e17\nChoice : A\n\nPrice $300\n\nQuestion: If it is $30/day, then  \u2e1915\u00d72 days\u2e17 =  $300\u2057 \n\nPrice $390\n\nQuestion:   If is true, then 2 days is     $390\u2a63   $300\u2a63 $90\u2a63 $5/day\u2a63 \n   Correct Answer\nChoice : E  \n\nHow", "answer": "B: late for work"}

What is the area of the patio in square feet?\nOutput:36\n\nExplanation: We begin by using the fact that the length is the perimeter with 12 multiplied by the width because width times length is the area of the rectangle.

How old is the wife?\nOutput:\n\nExplanation. We must find the equation of the lines, the slope, and the point of the second line by first understanding the slope of the first line. The height of the man is 6 divided by the age and the height of the woman equals x+5, we can solve for x is 5x=6n+3, and then using subtract 5 from both sides to make this equation equal to 6n+x, now isolate n by subtracting 6n from both sides. There we find that n=x-2. To figure out the slope, we can find the 6/x-2 but we must calculate x-2 which is 5x/6+5, and we can write 5x/6 as 5(x/6), so 5x/6=5(x/6)+5 which reduces to 5=x/6+5/5 and then x/6=5/5+5/6 which reduces to 5/6= x/6. The last step we can take is to solve for x, which is x=5/6-5/6 for x=4, 30 to 15 feet tall.

Each question consists of four parts, each with 3 possible answers.\n##### Part 1:\nThe car-rental agancy charges $30/d for a car, or  $190 for a car the rentals that last at least a week.  It charges $19/day for any other car rental. Jennie rented car for 11d. How much in dollars did she pay?\nThe car rental agency charges $49 on average over the course of one rental for each day of the rental.  One week rental cost $190.  An additional $19 on each day of rental, then $54 on the last day then $49 the rest of day would equal $190 + $19 + $54 + $49 = $201.  However I did use Excel to simplify calculation due to the 700+ hours.\n11d x $49 = $523\n\n###### Exampllation:\nInstruction:\nWrite a program to solve problem #2\n\nOutput:\n\nInstruction:\n\n##### Part 2:\nA hurricane is approaching south coast of Texas, and rancher is planning to transport 400 head cattle 60 mi to higher ground to protect from inland flood possible occurs.

Answers may be typed out and submitted, or pasted in. \n\n### Answer: How does the program work?\n\nAn algorithm works by listing out each individual step of the process required to solve a problem. Then the problem states must be put into the correct order of operations. If the correct input is provided, the correct output should also be produced.\n\n### What are the advantages of an algorithm over procedural programming?\n\nThere is only one way to do the job perfectly in Algorithms. This is a strong pros as only one source of possible error occurs. Procedural programming tends to be error prone due to its flexibility and allowance for human error.\n\n### Is an algorithm truly random? Can you think of an algorithm that would produce truly random outputs? (hint: think about shuffling a deck of cards)\n\nThe word \u201crandom\u201d in regard to algorithms is not a common term. Rather, most will likely think of algorithms as using orderly steps to reach an end product. Using this logic, it might be considered that shuffling a deck is truly random, but that cannot be the case either. As the shuffle is a repetitive process, it would likely follow that all the cards (the products) would be in the same set order after shuffling. It could be that we simply have a misunderstanding of what randomness means. If a deck of cards were to be shuffled in a way that no way is obvious, then it could be considered that it is random. When this shuffling is performed numerous times, we could assume that the output will be random every time.", "answer": "B: finger"}

He hands her two cards: one reading \u20183\u2019 and one reading \u20185\u2019. He asks her to come up with a number that is bigger than \u20183\u2019 but less than \u20185\u2019. She turns the cards over, looks at them and guesses \u20184\u2019. He points out that she\u2019s correct, but also that the cards have a sum: \u20188\u2019. He then turns both the cards over, showing her \u20183\u2019. He again asks her to come up a number that is bigger that \u20183\u2019 but less that \u20185\u2019. She again guesses \u20184\u2019, but she\u2019s wrong (as the number she guessed was also larger than \u20188\u2019). She says \u2018Sorry\u2019, then hands him the card that reads \u20188\u2019. He says \u2018no problem\u2019 and smilingly hands her the card reading \u20185\u2019. She smiles, looks at the two cards in her hand and triumphantly exclaims, \u2018AH!\u2019, showing the two cards to the unconventional math teacher; he exclaims \u2018YES\u2019, revealing that she picked the number \u201913\u2019.The Unconventional Mathematician\u2019s wife has just demonstrated a powerful algorithm (called the algorithm \u201cAns\u201d) that takes two digits and combines them into a larger number, keeping their value the same while increasing their magnitude. If we give her the digits \u20180\u2019 and \u20180\u2019, and ask her to use the algorithm to get to the number \u2018100\u2019, she will be able to succeed after only a short amount of trial and error. (\u2018000\u2019 is \u2018303030\u2019, or \u20188\u2019.) Your assignment for this program is to write an algorithm using two characters that acts like the \u2018Ans\u201d algorithm, taking two numbers of your choice and returning a sum. This function will work without fail, no matter what input you provide, though if you give it a digit greater than 9 in both inputs, you will get back something other than the sum of the two values. Your function will use letters, not digits, and the letters will take up two characters each. Your function must be able to take a function number arguments (for example, \u2018", "answer": "C: listen to music"}

He deposits 1850$ into a savings account at 6.65% interest every year.

Annual interest rates are always stated as a percentage of the total loan amount borrowed. Effective rates, however, can be stated as a fixed percentage of borrowed amount or a fixed percentage of the remaining balanced of the loan, depending on the loan agreement. A loan totaling $3400 at 12.5% interest would involve $30 in interest ($270 in interest over 9 months).

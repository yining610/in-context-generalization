Choices:  A: michigan B: new york C: amsterdam D: venice E: bridge<n><n>### Response:		<n>**(1)** The Netherlands would be one of the places with a lot of canals because the Dutch canal network contains over one thousand named canals, in total 3200 kilometres (2000 mi), and almost 6000 kilometres (4000 mi) for waterways in general.<n><n><n>**(2)** To get an idea of how long the route is for travelers, imagine standing at the starting dock and looking up at the towers of Amsterdam’s Central Station. As the waterway unfolds towards your left, you will see a canal ring that is actually made up of four semi-circles.<n><n><n>** (3)** The ring is about 300 metres (1000 ft) wide. The canal ring connects all of central Amsterdam. The waterways within the ring of the city have a total length of 60 kilometres (37 miles). It is now estimated that 165 kilometers (105 miles) of Amsterdam’s waterway system are still navigable. There are numerous bridges over these waterways.<n><n><n>**  (4)** Amsterdam has more than 1200 bridges. More than 800 years ago in the 9th century, in the middle of the 19th century, a canal was dug in the center of Amsterdam. On the edges of the city, small dikes were built to prevent the canal from spilling into the city's streets. For centuries, Amsterdam was protected by these dikes.<n><n><n>**   (5)** One day about 1635, a canal builder named Cornelius van der Schuyt put an idea to the city's rulers. He proposed a radical solution: he said the city should dig an enormous canal that would surround the whole city. This canal would have more than half a million square meters of land. It would also be 15 kilometers long. The city was going to use this canal instead of the city's dikes to defend itself.<n><n><n>**     (6)** Van der Schuyt's plan was accepted. In 1638, van der Schuyt and the city started to build Amsterdam's famous canal ring.<n><n><n>**      (7)** They started by digging a wide canal next to what is now Hereng

So the number of day vistors is 3 × 2 × 10 = 60 people per day.<n><n>* Weekly vacationers: persons staying more than 3 nights. We use 5 persons per cottage and 24 cottages per each day as a  rough estimate of the number day visitors. So the number day vistors is:5x24=120 persons per day.<n><n>The number of motel guests and cottage guests is the sum of day-visitors:<n><n>60 + 120 =

What did he shoot at? Choices:  A: body armor B: ungulate C: bomber D: kill people E: animal<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>> In the instructions, there is a multiple choice question and a demonstration. The car rental company charges $30 dollars per day, $190 per week, and $10 per additional day. The first section of the question states a person rented a car for eleven days. If the multiple choice question and demonstration were the only instructions, the best answer to the question is A. <n><n>> The next section states the travel time for the road trip. If someone used a car rental for a week, then the answer for the week would be 164 hours.  This would allow at least 164 hours to complete the road trip. If the next section stated that the car rental was to be transported from Austin to Houston, the total driving time would be 72 hours. If the car is traveling at top speed, then the travel time for 60 miles would take two hours. <n><n>> With a little more research, one would notice that the total driving time was more accurate than using the car rental for the week since the car rental companies will still have the car from Sunday to Monday. If the answer provided was one option, the best answer is D, because the question was unclear on the total hours the car rental would be provided for. <n><n>> If the next section had read, “Jason works on a poulty farm and needs to drive twice per month to buy supplies. The farm is 60 miles away and Jason’s truck can travel 225 miles per day at 24 miles per hour”, then the correct answer would be C.<n><n>> The next problem was a bit confusing because it stated the total number of children in Melissa’s family, but it also gave the answer for their income. If there were 180 children and their income was $3900, then the total would still be $180. However, the income given was more than the total children. With a little math, one could determine that each child had $21 and there was $1040 left over.<n><n>> In the last question, one could figure out that the ambulance ride was costing the family a little more than the cost of the medication, so therefore $1800 is the cost for the ambulance.<n><n>#### Explanation and solution:<n><n>1

Choices:  A: race track B: kentucky derby C: american southwest D: triple crown E: horse derby<n><n>### Response:		Answer (a)<n><n>### Input The most common way of dividing numbers is into even and odd numbers. To know if a number is even or odd, you can use a property of numbers known as divisibility. One way to test for divisibility is to look at the last digit in the original number. 12 is divisible by 3 because 12 divided by 3 equals 4 remainder 0. Divisibility for any number can be tested by asking, is the last digit a multiple of the divisor? If the last digit in 12 is a multiple of three than twelve will be divisible by three.  You do not have to divide 12 into three smaller numbers. If it is divisible by three, then the remainder will be zero. So 12 is divisble by three, and the divisor would be 3 because the last digit is a multiple of three. Divisibility also applies to the concept of a number square. 3 is another example of divisibility because when you square a number such as 3, the answer 9 gives an equation 3 x 9 equals 21. 1 to the power of any number will always be divisible because you can write any number out equal to 1 when you add one to the exponent. 3 x 9 = 27 and 1 to the power 27 is 1 which will be divisible by any number.<n><n>### Response (b-c)

Your department is looking for a new vehicle to replace your old squad car.  The police chief is considering hiring a fleet of electric Ford Mustangs to patrol the city and wants you to review the cost calculations presented.  The Mustang has a base price of $28,500, a starting fuel capacity of 35kWh, and a driving range of approximately 276km.  Over the course of a year, this car would typically drive a total of 6,300 kms.  Since the Mustang uses no gasoline, the only cost associated with its operation is that of electricity to recharge the battery and an annual inspection, which costs $____ per year.  The city of Austin buys electricity at a rate of $0.052097/kWh, and the state has an EV rebate program that provides a rebate of $2000 to those who have fully electric vehicles.

This is the cost.<n><n>### Input :  <n>The town you live in has a population of 72,630 people, and the city has decided to expand its town limits to a radius of 12 miles.

The time  that it takes for each car to pass the intersection is calculated using the following equation:<n><n>$$ P(n) = (XN) + (YN)^{-1}$$<n><n>Where $n$ is the number of vehicles in the line.

A car rental charges $30/7= $4.29 per day and if rented for 11 days, then total cost=(4.29*11),<n><n>Since the hurricane threatens Texas, then the duration of driving is 60 miles/an hour =60/60=1.0 mile/minute.<n><n>Then the total time required for transporting her cattle = (1.0mile/minute)*(number of cows)= 1 hour to cover every 10 cows, as the truck holds 2 cows.<n><n>The total transport time required to transport 90 cows = 90*1 min= 90 minutes or<n><n>1.5 hour/s<n><n>The truck can carry 20 head of cows.

Your program should output their input to the screen. If the integer is 0 or negative, print a message and ask the user to enter a number; repeat this process until the user enters a positive number. You may use `int` and `double` variables, as well as basic arithmetic and boolean operators.<n><n># Example:<n>1.<n>2.<n>3.<n><n>### Input<n><n>This project asks you to write a program that uses the data in the data.txt file to complete the task given below.<n><n># Instructions<n>The goal of the program is to write a program that reads in a list of foods as string keys and the quantity of each food as strings.  For example:<n>    string[]foodList = {"Hamburger","Candy","Pepsi","Cookies"};<n>    double[] quantities = {100d,200d,500d,450d};<n>In the example foodList holds the names of each food and quantities holds the count (or quantity) of each food. Your program should ask the user to enter the names of the foods as string keys.  At each prompt, your program should prompt the user for a food with each prompt, reading each food as a string key.  Your program should store each food as a string in a string array.  Then, at the next prompt, your program should ask the user for the quantities as integers.  Once the user has entered all of the inputs, your program should store each quantity in a double array.  At the end of the project, your program should tell the user how much money they have and how much food they have (how much has the user bought).<n><n># Example<n><n>### Input (input1)<n><n>Enter the names of the food items:<n>Hamburger<n>Candy<n>Pepsi<n>Cookies<n><n>Enter the quantities of each food item:<n>100<n>200<n>500<n>450<n><n>### Output (output1)<n><n>You have spent $$3450.00$$ dollars on the following items:<n><n>Hamburger<n>4<n>Candy<n>8<n>Pepsi<n>20<n>Cookies<n>8<n><n>

Choices:  A: brain problems B: laziness C: get fat D: headache E: laughter<n><n>### Response:		The correct response, given a multiple choice question, is always a sentence that contains all the correct answers. A common response is to select one response as correct and then add extra information that was not requested, such as a definition. In this example, two responses are appropriate. The answer to one of the questions on the list of questions is B (laziness). The response is to say that laziness can cause back pain. This statement, of course, may not be the intention of the inquirer, but the first part of the statement – laziness, causes back pain – is information that might be relevant to the inquirer. The second response is to provide the correct answer for question 6 and then provide the definition for "fat". That answer is not required, but it would be a good idea for someone to know the definitions when answering questions.<n><n>### Input Sitting to close while watching television can cause some health problems<n><n>### Response The correct response is to identify the health problem and give a brief description of how sitting can cause the problem. There are several responses, including B (laziness), C (get fat), and E (laughter). The correct response, when asked "Do you think that this could be true?" or "Is this possible?" and respond to the response with the correct answer. The second response refers to question 6 on the list of questions. The response answers the question with the correct answer, "F" (fat).<n><n>### Input This is one of my favorite movies<n><n>### Response In this type of response, in the question "Is this true?"", one responds to the response as true or false. The correct response, if asked "Is this true?" or "Do you think this could be true", refers to the first response; one should respond to the false statement, not the second statement.<n><n>

Choices:  A: public place B: roadblock C: space shuttle D: hoverboard E: supermarket<n><n>### Response:		Answer A.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>The correct answer is A. The hoverboard is not relevant because it is not something people would use to explore space. As for the use of D, a hoverboard is not practical for space travel because humans cannot live in it and it has not been tested for long-term use in space. That leaves A and B. A public place is important because it can be used to gather information about other places, but a roadblock can also be useful because it can be used as a barrier to keep out unfriendly aliens or other undesirable entities from entering our space.<n><n>### Input:\#!./bin/ruby a.rb<n><n>### Response:\#!/bin/ruby a.rub<n><n>### Instructions:<n>This program will be written in Ruby.

If it’s the second question, it’s hours, if it’s the third question, it’s dollars. Let’s check the number of questions. In the first question, there are two choices. 1/2*2=1, so it’s a fraction. In the second question, there are more than two choices. So it’s not a fraction. So the last one must be in dollars too.<n><n>### Now, that we solved in the fraction case, we’ll solve the same case, but for the money case.<n><n>First, we need to know what is the format of a problem in this class? For me, there are three types, three formats that I encountered and solved:  Fraction, Money, or Hours.<n><n><n>### Constraints: Fraction Input: If A and B are two numbers, then how many days does the task last? Choices: A: 0 B: 1 C: 2 D: 3 E: 4<n><n>### Solution: Well, I don’t know how to solve this for fraction or hour case, all I know about constraint is money.<n><n>### Then, I realized that constraints are mostly like this, all we need to do is solving it in the format that we’re used to. We need to figure out the constraints.<n><n>### Example:<n><n>Input: A bag of nuts costs 167$ and two bags cost 28$(2x).  If you have 45$ in your pocket, how many nuts can you buy?<n><n>Answer: 6<n><n>### So, back to this problem we have, we solved it for fraction case, but it doesn’t change the problem.

Choices:  A: cupboard B: chocolate C: coffee D: candy bar E: soda pop<n><n>### Response:		<n>[C] <n><n>### Rationale:<n>In this task, some users respond in one of five ways, but there is one correct answer that was asked for in the task. In this task the options were all given to the user, but only one of them was correct. By giving the user the five options to select from, it gave the appearance that the task provided multiple answers, which is what confused me. On the second question which asked what the number was in the 1/4th, that task actually provided me with the number 25 because each question and answer had 4 choices and it was also a fraction, so I selected the fourth option. On the third question I was asked to calculate the number of hours that it would take to travel 156 feet if the rate of a vehicle was 24 MPH. The calculation was 156 / 24 = 6.5. I did not realize that I was supposed to round down to 6 hours, so I marked the second choice. These were examples in which I selected an incorrect choice even though I was given the answer to what was going to be the choice. The last question asked the user to select the number of children in the question that followed and the number that were in a family. Each child received an allowance of $3900. The question that followed asked for the total amount that each boy received. The question had 2 possible correct answers, which are the ones that are listed below. In the second question I picked the answer that was only 3 children in the family. The question did not indicate that there were 175 children in the family, so I selected the family that fit the answer that I had given for the number of children. If the task would have specified that the children in a family were 180 in number and the boys received a certain amount each for their allowance that would have led me to the correct choice, which again, could also lead to the confusion that was presented in this question. If the task presented the question the first time or the second time and asked me to subtract two numbers, it would not have been a confusing task because I would have known what option to choose after knowing how much money and number of children there were. In the next question, as mentioned before, I was confused because I looked at the whole question and the answer choices and tried to determine what the answer to the question was from the answers

What does that mean?<n><n>In C# most methods are a series of commands or statements. To execute a series of commands the compiler will have to compile them into one single line.<n><n>In this case, we are actually writing code that will be read by a machine and that machine is trying to understand what that means.<n><n>If we have 15 words then it will have to be converted into one line of code. If we have 150 words then it will have 150 lines of code, or if we have 250 words then it would have 250 lines of code. Most of the time a method of this size will not be included unless we are trying to prove a point or show off, but that's not the case here.<n><n>Since the input has an equal amount of options as the size of the blocks we can then write a statement for each of the options. In this case, we have 4 options on the input screen with 4 blocks of code to be executed.<n><n>**Note**: Just to be clear there can also be multiple options on the list to choose from based on the input in question. In the next example, we will have a list of choices that could include none or any of the choices.<n><n>### Example: <n>In this example, we will have choices that are displayed and we will pick 2 of them. <n><n>Below is an instruction that describes the task.<n><n>Input: A store owner plans to hold a sidewalk sale of 7 summer dresses for $39, 6 summer dresses for $49, and 6 winter coats for $120.

Let's take, for example, the sequence 3056, 2949, 2842,....  How to find the next number in this progression:<n><n>If we multiply -3 by 5 (next digit  = 3 * 5), we will get -15.<n><n>If we multiply 0 * 6 (next digit = 0 * 6), we get 0.<n><n>If we add -2 to -7 (next digit = -2+(-7)) we get --9.<n><n>If we multiple -9 * 5, we will get -45.<n><n>If these numbers are divided by 4 and rounded down, you get: -45 / 4 = 11 1/4. Finally the next number in the progression is 3056 - 2949 = 107.<n><n>If we divide 3056 by 2, we get: 3056/2 * 10 = 1528. As mentioned above, 3*5 = 15; 0*6 = 0; -2+(-7) = -9; -9*5 = -45. If these numbers are divided by  4 and rounded down,    we see the pattern.<n><n>So I believe the next number is: 291 - 107 = 184. The number sequence starts with:<n><n>291, 184, 92, 46

As the school year grew colder, the days were colder, but still exciting. The 1st day of spring warmed the classroom. The students began to daydream.  They were still excited by the promise of school. The days of fall were exciting, as the leaves change to yellow-gold and rust. It’s exciting. What will it be like next year, the students asked themselves.  The year comes to an end.  When they are 5 years old, in pre-school the excitement of school is overcoming by the fear of a different day when their school day ends. Every year as they get older, it gets harder to feel the excitement. As adults, most of them are no longer excited and not thinking critically. So maybe cross roads are the best.<n>Output: 2<n><n><n>

The next time he would probably eat lunch he would be late for work since lunch would make him late for work.<n><n>#### Input:<n>The man was eating a sandwich and drinking a big cola in the break room at work. It was his lunch break, so he didn't mind. But when he looked at his wristwatch he saw he had only fifteen minutes left. That would barely be enough time to eat lunch and get to his office. He ate as fast as he could and then ran through the halls, past his office door without even stopping to say hi to the secretary.

What is the area of the patio in square feet?<n>Output:36<n><n>Explanation: We begin by using the fact that the length is the perimeter with 12 multiplied by the width because width times length is the area of the rectangle. Now, we can multiply the area by 100 to convert it into square feet.<n><n><n>Input: The height of a man is 6 times his age. 5 years later, his height is 6 inches taller than his wife.  How old is the wife?<n>Output:<n><n>Explanation. We must find the equation of the lines, the slope, and the point of the second line by first understanding the slope of the first line. The height of the man is 6 divided by the age and the height of the woman equals x+5, we can solve for x is 5x=6n+3, and then using subtract 5 from both sides to make this equation equal to 6n+x, now isolate n by subtracting 6n from both sides. There we find that n=x-2. To figure out the slope, we can find the 6/x-2 but we must calculate x-2 which is 5x/6+5, and we can write 5x/6 as 5(x/6), so 5x/6=5(x/6)+5 which reduces to 5=x/6+5/5 and then x/6=5/5+5/6 which reduces to 5/6= x/6. The last step we can take is to solve for x, which is x=5/6-5/6 for x=4, 30 to 15 feet tall. And now we can find the answer of the math problem, she is 29-years old.<n><n>Input: A boxcar of cereal has 124 boxes on each pallet that weigh 50 pounds each.

These crops vary in quality and price, so in order to sell their products at a good profit, some farmers sell some of their higher quality crops directly to the customer, while selling the lower quality crops to middlemen to be sold to processors and grocery stores.   A farmer has sold $41,900 worth of his wheat. Of that total, $27,900 was sold to middle men. He had 2000 bushels left, but a bad frost had damaged many of the crops, so the average quality of the crops left on his farm was only about 60 percent of the best quality.

Answers may be typed out and submitted, or pasted in. <n><n>### Answer: How does the program work?<n><n>An algorithm works by listing out each individual step of the process required to solve a problem. Then the problem states must be put into the correct order of operations. If the correct input is provided, the correct output should also be produced.<n><n>### What are the advantages of an algorithm over procedural programming?<n><n>There is only one way to do the job perfectly in Algorithms. This is a strong pros as only one source of possible error occurs. Procedural programming tends to be error prone due to its flexibility and allowance for human error.<n><n>### Is an algorithm truly random? Can you think of an algorithm that would produce truly random outputs? (hint: think about shuffling a deck of cards)<n><n>The word “random” in regard to algorithms is not a common term. Rather, most will likely think of algorithms as using orderly steps to reach an end product. Using this logic, it might be considered that shuffling a deck is truly random, but that cannot be the case either. As the shuffle is a repetitive process, it would likely follow that all the cards (the products) would be in the same set order after shuffling. It could be that we simply have a misunderstanding of what randomness means. If a deck of cards were to be shuffled in a way that no way is obvious, then it could be considered that it is random. When this shuffling is performed numerous times, we could assume that the output will be random every time.<n><n>

He hands her two cards: one reading ‘3’ and one reading ‘5’. He asks her to come up with a number that is bigger than ‘3’ but less than ‘5’. She turns the cards over, looks at them and guesses ‘4’. He points out that she’s correct, but also that the cards have a sum: ‘8’. He then turns both the cards over, showing her ‘3’. He again asks her to come up a number that is bigger that ‘3’ but less that ‘5’. She again guesses ‘4’, but she’s wrong (as the number she guessed was also larger than ‘8’). She says ‘Sorry’, then hands him the card that reads ‘8’. He says ‘no problem’ and smilingly hands her the card reading ‘5’. She smiles, looks at the two cards in her hand and triumphantly exclaims, ‘AH!’, showing the two cards to the unconventional math teacher; he exclaims ‘YES’, revealing that she picked the number ’13’.The Unconventional Mathematician’s wife has just demonstrated a powerful algorithm (called the algorithm “Ans”) that takes two digits and combines them into a larger number, keeping their value the same while increasing their magnitude. If we give her the digits ‘0’ and ‘0’, and ask her to use the algorithm to get to the number ‘100’, she will be able to succeed after only a short amount of trial and error. (‘000’ is ‘303030’, or ‘8’.) Your assignment for this program is to write an algorithm using two characters that acts like the ‘Ans” algorithm, taking two numbers of your choice and returning a sum. This function will work without fail, no matter what input you provide, though if you give it a digit greater than 9 in both inputs, you will get back something other than the sum of the two values. Your function will use letters, not digits, and the letters will take up two characters each. Your function must be able to take a function number arguments (for example, ‘

In the study, she found that children raised in a “Natural Growth” environment (the name given to parents who did not participate in extra- curricular parenting activities) were less likely to be financially successful than those children who were raised in an “Aristocratic” environment (parents who made an active effort to help their children succeed).  Natural Growth children were less likely to enroll in college than Aristocratic children—they were also more likely to enter the military and had lower GPAs.  Based on Lareau's study, what is the most likely outcome of a child from a 'Natural Growth' environment?<n>Output: Less likely to enroll in College than Aristocratic child.<n>

He deposits 1850$ into a savings account at 6.65% interest every year. After 6 years, how much money will he have in the account?<n>Output: 2648.16<n><n>Input:When calculating a car loan, the interest rate is sometimes written as “either”, which means the annual or effective interest rate. Annual interest rates are always stated as a percentage of the total loan amount borrowed. Effective rates, however, can be stated as a fixed percentage of borrowed amount or a fixed percentage of the remaining balanced of the loan, depending on the loan agreement. A loan totaling $3400 at 12.5% interest would involve $30 in interest ($270 in interest over 9 months). If the interest were stated as a percentage of borrowed amount, the total would be $306, which is 8.4% percent of the loan amount. But if it was computed as a percentage of the remaining loan amount, the interest would be $31.85 for the month (equal to 21.85% percent). If this were applied to the entire 9-mont period, the total interest would be $300 at an effective rate of 21.84%.<n>Output: 30<n><n>Input:The annual rate of return on an investment is 9%.

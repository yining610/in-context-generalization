Second, we'll do the same solution again to solve the problem without guessing, but rather using the algorithm given in the instructions.\n\nWe first look at the choices and observe that choosing option 2 results in the answer of 4. Thus, we guess 4 and try it out because it seems to be the natural choice. It's good to have a little hint on the problem first.\n\nUsing Guessing, we get:\nInput 22\nOutput 4\n\nNext, we take away the input, or remove 22. We multiply that by the multiplier, which is 1,000, which results in 21,998. Since we added 22 earlier, we subtract that from 21,989, leaving us with 1598, which is our result.\n\n```\nTapanga and Corey each have 22 candes together.\nTapanga has __(18 more than Corey)__\n_______Tapanga has 17 more than Corey__\nMultiply input by 1, 000 to get the result  21,999 --> 18+142+600+24+5\nSub", "answer": "B: filing cabinet"}

How many candiess corey have\nSolution:\nIn order to solve the question, we have to look at the relationship of Tapanga and Coreys candies. Tapanga gives corey 2 candies and herself 8 candies. This indicates that tapanga owns 10 candies while corey only owns 5.\nSo the total candy owned by corey comes out to 2(10) candies and 2 more (the 8 candies tapanga gave to corey). So total candies owned by corey sums to 2+8 candies which is 10.\nSo the total candies owned by Tapanga and Coreyn together comes out to 18 candies (tapanga's original 10 + corey's 10).\n\nInput 2: Freddy is calling to his family on New Year\u2019s Eve.

Local call cost 5 cents in minute, while international call cost 25 cenets in minute. How much does Freddy spend call his family on New Year Eve?\nSolution:\nTo solve the question, we don't have need to see how many minutes is one conversation. We already know that local calls are 5 cents and how many minutes it lasted. We solve for b based on 74\u00d75=370 and 63\u00d725=1575.

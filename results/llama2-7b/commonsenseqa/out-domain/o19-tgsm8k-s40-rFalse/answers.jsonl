The answer to this problem is 90\n\nSince the number of Schnazuers is 15 and 20 - 15 = 5 and 5/5 = 1, the number of Schnazues can be 5 at most. However, if the answer for the number of dogs is 5, then 5 + 1 = 6. So we get 6/5 = 1.5 which is less than 6. Finally, if the dogs are 6 we get 6+1 = 7. So 4 can not be the right answer.\n\nThe sum of the Dobermans and the Schnazzers does not need to be a solution itself, though, the number of Schnuazer is calculated based on the number of dogs. Finally we know that the number of Schnazzers can only go up to a number that is a multiple of 5. So Schnazzer can be 5, 10, 15 20, and 25. Since 25 is the largest number of Schnazzes, the answer is 20.\n\nLet us examine the problem in detail:\n\nDr. Banks had 603 toothbrushs to give out to his patients. He had previously given 330 to his patients. Each patient receives 33 / 2 toothbrushs.\n\nFirst, Dr. Banks gives out 330 toofbrushes, so each of his patients received 330 / 2 tooth", "answer": "C: corner"}

If you want to use a computer to validate your answer on this question.\n\n#### Part A\n\nThe question says that there are 3 fewer than twice as many sheep as goats. One way to solve this is by saying 2x-(3-2001)=0, and solving for x: x=202 \n\nNow there are 4 times as more sheep as there are goats. Since there are 4x, the question reduces to: how many goats are there? The answer is 2501-4x, or x=425.\n\nNow, there is 10 more goats than sheep. For 10x and 10 more than x, we have x+20=202. This is 2(10x+5) for the two cases separately. We can substitute x+20 and x for 10x and x respectively, so the answer is 2(1(x+20))+(1(x))=.

They draw six-shooters and begin firing at each other, both hoping to be the last one standing. Each round, one of them dies. Both are cowboys, so they were proficient with their six-guns and were equally likely to hit their shot with each one. The town had a very good lawyer who would be able to testify about exactly how each cowboy died. There was no wind, and the cowboys were about 150 feet from each other. If they both landed a shot on each other's body, then exactly one of them would die at the end of each shooting round.\nIn round one, the first cowboy fired and missed. The second cowboy landed his shot and killed him, with his bullet ricocheting after hitting the second cowboy and landing in his left boot. In round two, the new cowboy fired and hit the barn behind the first cowboy. That shot from a moving train killed only the first cowboy, as it missed the second cowboy's body. In round three, the first cowboy missed again. The second cowboy fired and hit him directly in the heart, as he was aiming at the previous shooter's body.  For the rest of the rounds, the second cowboy shot at the new cowboy, and didn't hit the new cowboy, either. Since the second cowboy never missed, and the first cowboy never hit him either, it's  clear that the second cowboy won the challenge. How many rounds did the challenge last?\nOutput:  SIX", "answer": "D: lake superior"}

We use a table to represent the situation on which we could solve the problem.\n2. We can conclude that there are 60 jelly beans in each bag, which means there are 60 * 2 = 120 each package of jelly beans, where the total weight of the package is 0.5(1.5 = 7.5) kg's each bag (in our case, there are two bags of jellies).\n3. We can check the extra weight of each jelly bag and the total extra weight of both the bags.\n4. We can conclude that the total extra weight of the blue bag is 0.5", "answer": "B: gaining knowledge"}

You end up with.\n    In the third question, since it's only asking for the difference, we know it's going to be a negative. \n    Then since total pups - (doberman-schnauzer), we only need to subtract the schnauzer, \n    since there's 20 - (difference). So you just have to add 20 to it.\n\n    The next question, which is the fourth one in the set (and so on), asks for a remainder.\n    In this one, it only matters how many dobermans there are in the first place, \n    so you have to add up the numbers you have to arrive at total, \n    (it's easy to do it with addition in your head like any other multiple choice questions).\n    The same thing, since it's the same, if you just have more doberman puppies,\n    the doberman to schnauzer difference will get bigger, \n    so total will be more, and remainder will be the extra schnauzer.\n    \n    The next one, Dr. Banks, \n    You need to solve for the remainder of his toothbrushes left, with the same idea of \"How many left in the end?\"\n    He had x toothbrushes \n    So there's 330 - x toothbrushies.\n    If you just solved for it from there, it's the same as before.\n    \n    Another thing to look for here is how many were given away the first month.\n    \n    Next set is similar to the first couple, only with more variables.\n    A toothbr", "answer": "D: read book"}

Loops are what we use to make things repeat, and that kind of goes hand in hand perfectly with recursion. In fact, it will eventually make all of the examples we wrote for recursion unnecessary. We can accomplish exactly the same thing with a loop if we make the loop repeat.<n><n>It's hard to describe loops in 250 words, but I'll give our best shot.<n><n>Imagine you're working with a text document, like we did last week. We want to add the value in each line to a running sum. We might have something like this:<n><n>```python<n># lines=<many, many lines><n># sum=0<n>for line in lines:<n>    sum += float(line)<n>```<n><n>We're going to have a running total, `sum`, based on the value in each line. We just did another one of those 3-stage loops we introduced last week where we define the object we're using, then we set and read properties of it using the for loop. The difference in this example is that we're using `float` to turn the numbers into actual floating-point numbers. The only other change for this loop is that we're adding up the values, rather than just putting them in a global variable.<n><n>Remember when I was talking about that "strange" use of `==` and `!=` earlier this week? That's where we see those again.<n><n>In the example with the running total of a list of inputs, we had the two numbers `12` and `3`. The reason we didn't just use the `==` and `!==` comparison operators to check those two numbers is because they have values like all Python boolean things. To put `3==12` just like that means you're trying to compare the literal numbers 3 and

Explain why. <n><n>Output: Because he counted the sheep and goats each day<n><n>#### Instruction:Answer the question at the end of the passage.<n><n>In ancient times, there were four great rivers, namely the Nile, the Euphrates, the Tigris, and the Rhone. Many of the earliest maps were based on the geography illustrated in these rivers. In fact, the Egyptians' map of the River Nile looked more like a picture of a river than a map. It showed the mountains at the beginning and the end of the river - but nothing in between. The Egyptians believed that the Nile was not a continuous river, but had four sections like seasons of the year. The upper part of the river was green, the lower part was reddish, and in the middle was a green and reddish mixture. It was because of this that the entire Nile River was once known as the “Green Stream of Egypt” or “Red Stream of Egypt”. A mapmakery today would be criticized for being less scientific than this map.<n>Since most of the maps at the start were based on the four rivers, the maps would show the four rivers flowing in a straight line and into the sea. <n>Therefore, we can see from the map that the river Rhone emptied all of its flood water into the sea.  In ancient times, people believed that the only river flowed into the sea along a straight line. For example, in the map given, the Euphrates River could only enter into the sea from one specific area, not many of them.<n>If you look at how rivers in the Middle East looked on old maps, they all flowed into the “Arabian Sea” or the Persian Gulf from one very specific location. Maps still have this tendency to show all the water of a river flowing out into the sea from one small area. The Ganga River flows into river Delta from the Indian Ocean at Calcutta, and from there into Bangladesh.<n>The great Rivers of the United State

The hypotenuse of the triangle is equal to 150cm, and both legs of the triangle are equal to 70cm.  To prove the design of this airplane is sound, a student wants to verify that when she flaps this airplane, it actually flies forwards and not back forwards.  Assuming she flaps the airplane using a total force of 5 N, at what rate will the center of mass change with each flap?  Holding a string steady, the student calculates that the airplane changes places 30 cm forward per flap.  Based on this information and the above data, what is the magnitude of ∆x during 15 flaps?  Holding the string steady 30 cm below the point of the airplane center of mass, how long does the airplane stay in this position?  (Note that this is the distance between when it leaves the starting position and when it leaves the position the string is in.)<n>Output: 104.98<n> <n>Input: A baseball is thrown at 59.5 m/s in a direction that makes an angle of 44.3° with the horizontal, and has an initial speed of 15 m/s.

In math D means the bottom number in a fraction. If you multiply or divide you keep D as the bottom number.  If your fraction is 3/4 its D is 4.<n><n>If you multiply a number or fraction by a whole number, the first number you multiply it by changes the denominator. For example, the denominator (bottom number) of 4/5 is 5. If you multiply 3/4 (which is the same as 0.75) by 3, the denominator is 5. If your fraction is 5/6, then the denominator after you multiply the number or fraction by 2 would be 6.<n><n>If you divide any number or fraction by any whole number, the denominator stays the same. For example, if you want to divide 5/14 by 7, the denominator would NOT change. To do this problem, you have to multiply by 7/7. 7/7 is 1.  When you see the word "over" the denominator stays the sam. For example, if the whole number is 7, then 5 times 7 equals 35 and 7/7 is still 1, so the fraction is still 35/1.<n><n>If your fraction is 30/6, what does 30 divided by 6 equal?<n>Output: 6<n><n>What does the word even mean in math when it comes to even numbers?<n>Output: Even numbers have two things that are the same. In math even numbers add up to an even number when you place them next to each other (ex. 8, 12, 16).

How many sheep does the typical sheep farm have?<n>A.1<n><n>Q.  The number of days in this month has been a recurring topic of conversation as of late. Let s’be clear – this month is 31 days long, and February, which has traditionally had 28 days, is no exception. As a result, that is how many days are in February this year.<n>A. 31<n><n>Q. You can answer this question by using the first three (the first few) multiples of 3, each of which contains 3. For example, 3, 6, and 9 are the first three (the largest) multiples of 12. Thus, the first three multiples of 15 are 15, 22, and 29, respectively.<n>Q. A student is wondering how many sheep dogs he will need in the competition.  The competition consists of three categories: Sheepdogs, Herding Cats, and Mating Rabbits.   In each of these three categories, a sheepdog is required for every 2 sheep. The dog required in the Sheepdogs category need be no larger than 200 lbs.   There are 5 lbs. in a stone.  In which category does the student require the most dogs? The shepherd can use any size dog that they can find.<n>A. Mating Rabbits<n><n>Q. As you know, it has been a snowy day here today, and everyone agrees that ice is thicker than water.  As a result, it is likely that more people were born in 1961 than in 1987, because there were 50 (or half) days in January, 51 days in February, and so forth..<n>A.1961<n><n>Q.

Write code for a method named "findTheAverageRate". It should take in 1 integer (price), an integer (total days), which should be between 1 to 31. It should return the average price per day.<n><n>2. Write code for a class named "CarPool". The class should have a variable named "members". This variable should hold a List which can hold other classes. These other classes for the "members" of the carpool will all be members of the list because the whole point of this class is 58 people. We know there is: teachers, mechanics, doctors and police officers, and then we need to add students on to it. This list should not be limited, i.e., it should be an infinite list and the carpool can hold even more people.<n><n>3. Your carpool class should have a method named "getTheTotalNumberOfMembers". This should return the total number of members in the carpool. To get this "list", you should only need to type the word "members" and then do List.getLength() and then divide that number by 2, which will get you the total number of members minus 1.<n><n>4. Your carpool class also should have a method named, "addTheCostOfTheCarRent". This method should take in price, total days and cost of carrental. This method should add the cost of the rental for each day the rental lasts.<n><n>**Hint:** You must first add your own variables (or you can use built in ones) to store values. These values will help you add up the rental costs. You can print out the answer using System.out.println()

There is but one law to govern it as there is but one sun to light it."  This law states that letters, with the exception of y, always appear by themselves in the alphabet.  For example, "y" always appears before 'z' in the pronunciation of the English alphabet.  In addition, "y" always takes the long sound in pronunciation of long vowels, like "a" in "eye."  Also, the "y" sound is always the ending "y" sound in pronounced words.  In addition to the two letters 'i' and 'j', the alphabet has two additional vowel sounds.  "i" stands for the vowel sound in words such as "bit" and "pin."  By contrast, the "y" sounds in these words comes from the vowels in the suffixes "-ty" and "-ty" words: "bit" and "pity."  The rule states that the "y" in the suffix '-ty' always takes the long "y" sound whereas the "y" in 'bit' takes the short "y" sound.  This is just one of several rules that we expect to use to help us spell words correctly. To spell a word correctly, you first have to know its pronounciation(s).  Write rules that use letters to define words.  In particular, write rules that define words by their pronounciation.<n>Output:  C  Vowels have two sounds; i and y<n><n>Input: A group of six hikers leave the mountains and encounter a stream that they have to cross; there are five logs at a site that the hikers must use in order to cross the stream.

Choices:  A: eaten B: glassess C: jar D: pizza E: refrigerator<n>Output:		E<n><n>### Explanation:<n>### 1. Input: The solution to this question is to divide the initial rental rate of $30/day by 7 which results in a rate of $4.288/day. <n>### 1A. If she rented the car for 11=11x7=77 days her bill would be $3000+77x4.288=3450.37600 dollars.<n>### 2. Input: The Solution to this equation is to divide the maximum drive speed by the total distance travelled, (70/60 miles per hour) to determine a driving duration of 11.67 hours in order to drive 400 head.<n>### 3. Input: The solution is to divide the rental price by the number of weeks in order to determine the hourly cost and then multiply by the number of days desired. <n>###  3A. If he rented the house for 22 days his total bill would be 800x22=18000 dollars<n>### 4. Input: The solution would be to multiply the driving distance by the driving speed to determine the hours needed(60/3)=20 hours<n>### 5.<n>### 5A. This problem can be solved by converting the number of children to the decimal value and then subtracting to determine the remainder that represents food, then converting the remainder to a percent, then dividing the total bill by this percent to determine food cost<n>### 6. Input: The solution for this equation is to deduct the medication cost from the remainder of cost and then taking 175 to the power of 3 and subtracting from the initial total to determine the remainder of meal costs.<n>### 7.  Input: 39 can be found by multiplying the number of pounds of carrots in all three separate beds by the 6 carrots per pound.<n>### 8. Input: If she put them in the fridge they would eat the olives, if she put them in glasses they would get wet, if she put them on pizza they would be eaten and drink the juice out of the olives, if the put them in the jar it would remain

Then C, D, and E are less probable options.\n\n### Input/Explanation:\n\nI tried to write answer \"B\" but mark of wrong, what is wrong? The explanation is also confusing:\n1. Why A is incorrect? Why \"more people\" cannot be a few?\n\n2. I can't figure out what does \"few\" mean here. If I take 5 people, is it few? or many?\n\nThanks for the help.\n\nComment: _\"few times a lot of people\"_ does not make any sense. Did you perhaps mean \"a few times many people\" (i.e. the train station)?\n\nComment: @DarthFennec I think I got it right. I used the word \"lots of people\" (in my response) and that word I thought was similar to few which made no sense, or they are not interchangeable. I mean here: *At least a few times, many people must have breathed at the train station*\n\nComment: Ok. Then I understand that you interpreted \"more recently\" to mean something like \"less than X or less often than X\".

{"text": "The correct answer is garden center\n\nA: flower garden B: pot C: Garden center D: E Formal garden\n\nThe garden center will be the place to go if you want to buy a rosebush or flower plant that is already started. They are growing and have been cultivated, which means that they are ready to be purchased for planting. These types of flowers may not need any repairs or other work before planting.\n\nGarden center will have a variety of options for gardening and landscape services, such as landscape designers, gardeners, and nurseries. You can also find information about plants and how to care for them. They also offer advice on what types of flowers would be best for your home or area, as well as how to take care of them properly once they\u2019re planted in their new location.\n\nThere is a garden center in my neighborhood. It offers a wide variety of plants and flowers as well as seeds. The garden center is a beautiful place to look at, but it costs more to buy a flower than it does to buy seeds. The gardeners at the garden center love what they do (or they wouldn't be doing this). To make this place beautiful and interesting to visit, you'll need to hire a garden center manager or manager who puts in a lot of time into making sure everything looks nice before people come in and see it.\n\nIf you are going to use pot for your rosebush, then the location of the rosebush is the same as the pot. You can't put any other flower besides a rosebush in the pot, so the pot will be used for the rest of your flowers.\n\nIf you have a garden center that sells plants, then it's okay to put a rose bush in their garden center. However, if you have a garden store that also sells plants or flowers, then it's not okay to put a rosebush in their garden center.", "answer": "E: formal garden"}

A tear down can be used to understand exactly how your script was executed and to ensure that another developer can read your script and produce the same results on their device.\n\n## Reuse\n**Narrative:**Reusable code provides an immediate benefit to the developer who understands the code and has control of it. Reusable code improves maintainability and is a significant time saver when it comes to finding a needle in a haystack.\nThe following three guidelines are recommended as best practice for reusable code:\n\n**Use code libraries.** Code libraries contain prewritten and tested code. This can speed up the development cycle by saving time researching, testing, and writing similar code.  Most programming languages have libraries that developers can access.  JavaScript also offers a vast library of free tools that can be used to reduce the time it takes to search and develop code. These are free on the Internet and can be downloaded into JavaScript, making the library available with every JavaScript source file.\n\n**Extract and reuse pieces of code. By extracting the code and then putting it in a separate area, you have isolated the functionality. With this strategy, you have access to all the code that\u2019s used to perform a task; therefore, if a need arises to perform it again, it can be easily reused. \n\n**Reuse blocks of code.** This allows developers to reuse the same code in multiple applications or places in a program. This is accomplished using variable, function, and global variables.  This may be a better option than combining code and placing it in the program by using global variables.\n## Example:\nHere is some reusable code.  For example, you can see that the function `findWalruses()` takes one argument `walrusNr`. The function is designed to look for walruses and will use the `findWalrus()` function inside.\nYou can also notice the use of a `global variable`, which holds the position. This allows us to reuse this code by replacing the argument with `findWalrus()`.\n\n```javascript\nconst myGlobalVar =", "answer": "B: aggression"}

{"text": "The possible user input is A or B.\n\nI would suggest to choose B as the answer.\n\n### Rationale:\n\nThe answer should never be A or D because a person cannot be \"thick\" by being a thin person or being unacquainted with a person who is fat.\n\nFor choice E, a person who wants to be \"thick\" may want to be fat and the question doesn't elaborate whether the person wants to be thin or who would consider \"thick\" as being fat.\n\nFor  choice C, the possibilities of what a person may want to be is too broad and it should be eliminated from the choices.\n\n### Input\n\nA man who has been training all his life to race is finally getting ready to race. If  he races in the 100-meter,  and wins with a time of 11.8 sec, what time did he have in the 500-meter?\n\nAnswer: 59.80 sec\n\n### Rational:\n\nThe man won in 11.8 seconds so he can deduce that he could spend 43.2 seconds in the 50-meter race.\n\nSince time is inversely proportional, the man could race the 500 meter in 59.8 sec, or 9.8 times faster than the 100 meter race.\n\n### Input:\n\nA person wants to sell a new car that costs $21,950.

Dividing $3,330 by the whole number, $21,910, leaves $2,13, because $3,33 divided by $21,9 equals 2.13. \n3. Adding $7.00 to $2,13 or $2,13 + $7.00 = 7.", "answer": "A: slender"}

What is the amount John has?\n\n### Solution\nInput: A. If we assume that 5 coins are 100 cents and 3 coins are 60 cents. Then total worth of the coins would be 160 cents. Remaining 40 cents can be accounted for as two coins with 20 cents value and the remaining 20 cent as the other coin.\nOutput: (A: 160 cts (2 X 40 cts and 3 (40 cts)) or (B: 160 + (2 X 4) cts = 160 cps))\n\n### Comments:\n1.

{"text": "### The movie had many a song is a phrase that refers to a movie that contains many songs. Choices A, B, and C contain nouns, but the sentence has a verb in the form of \"is\" so it does not make sense for any choice that ends in a noun. (D) \"jukebox\" is not a phrase, rather it is a noun. A correct word pair is \"the movie had many a song (noun), it was a musical\" (\"what\", if followed by a noun, is called an interrogative pronoun.)\n\n### Input:\"I need to find the largest number that I can purchase with $15. What number should I buy?\" What should I buy?\n\n### Response\n\n### The numbers $15 and the largest number that $15 can obtain (the largest is determined to be 6) are part of an English phrase called a \"which phrase.\" \"What number should I buy?\" is also a phrase, one with a noun phrase and a verb phrase interlinked with the word \"that\".\n\n### Input\"I need to find the highest number that is divisible by five. What number should I look at?\" What should I look at?\n\n### Answer \n\n### The phrase: \"What number should I look at\" is called interrogative phrase. Another phrase within the sentence, \"I need to find the...\" is called an English phrase.\n\n### Input\"\"I need to find the two largest odd numbers that add up to 24.\" What would the two numbers be?\n\n### The best answer here is to write: \"The two numbers would be 12 and 12.\" \n\n### Input \"I need to find two numbers with a sum of 6. That sum is 4 plus 2. What numbers can I choose?\" Choices: 1+3, 2+4\n\n### The correct phrase is 2+2. The sentence starts with an English phrase (\"I need to find two...\") and ends in another. \"That sum is\" is considered a verb phrase, as it starts with \"Is\" but ends in \"sum\" which is the name of a noun. The correct verb pair is \"that sum\" = \"is.\"\n\n### Input \n\n### I need to multiply these", "answer": "C: musical"}

{"text": "The correct response to this question is fire\n\nFire is a common chemical reaction, which uses fuel (usually wood or coal) and oxygen to produce heat and light. This process is known as combustion and is the most common way that humans produce heat and energy.\n\nIn a fire, combustible materials (wood, coal, paper) are burned in oxygen. As the materials burn, they release heat which is absorbed by the air around it, resulting in higher temperature inside the fire. This process generates light and heat.\n\nLava is another common chemical reaction, but it is not used as a heat source, as it is not used as an energy source like fire. Lava is molten rock that is created from volcano eruptions and other geological events. Other differences between fire and lava include that lava does not release light or use oxygen as a fuel source, and is much hotter than fire.\n\nElectricity can also be used to create heat, but is not considered a chemical reaction, as it does not involve a chemical reaction. Heat is produced when electrons flow between atoms in an electric current.\n\nHeating water to produce steam is also a chemical reaction but is usually considered as a heat source and not a common chemical reaction since the heat is used to generate steam for cooking, heating, or powering machines.\n\nHouses are also a source of heat through windows and ventilation systems that use combustion to generate heat or electricity, but this source is not considered as a common chemical reaction because it requires the presence of combustible materials such gasoline or propane and an external heat source such as natural gas or propane.\n\nSolar energy can be used to heat up buildings and other structures, and this process can be considered as a common chemical reactions because it is a chemical reaction in itself as it involves the reaction between sunlight and the materials exposed to it, resulting in heat and light. However, this is not the most commonly used chemical reaction as heating up buildings and other structures using solar energy isn't the most common way humans produce energy.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer to this question is fire.", "answer": "B: fire"}

{"text": "Your job is to use a for loop to answer this question.The grill is the best way to relieve your hungry.\n\n### Explanation:The grill is the only option that makes sure you can do it forever without end.\n\n### Input - This line of code asks for a string input from the program and stores it in the variable \"str\".\n```\nstr = input(\"How do you feel during a job interview? Choices:  Excited A: scared B: nervous C: confident D: relaxed E: calm. \"\n```\n### Response - You need to have a counter variable to count how many times the code loop repeats. Set the counter to zero and check to see if the counter is equal to zero. We need to set the break variable to true to tell the code loop to break out of the while loop when the conditional expression comes true. Add \"print(str)\" to print the string input that you enter.\n```\ncounter = 0\nstr = input(\"Choices:  Excided A: scared B) nervous C: confident  D: relaxed E calm. \")\nwhile (counter < 3):\n   if (str == \u201c\u201d):\n      break\n   if counter % 3 == 0:\n      print(str)\n      counter = counter + (-1)\n    elif counter % 3 ==1:\n      counter = counter-1\n    else:\n      counter =counter + 1\n\n   str = input(\"Choices : \u201c Excited\")\n```\n\n### Exampe of error - If you enter any option other than \"Excitted\", the code loop will run 1000 times at least without showing you the right output.\n\n## Additional Questions to Answer \n\n### Q1 - The \"if\" conditional statement checks the conditional statement on a case-by-case basis. When the program sees any of these conditional statements: `if statement1 == 'True'`` and finds that these statements are either `True` or `False`, your program executes the code in the `if` statement. When a code block is written to handle a particular situation (if it happens), it is called a `conditional`.\n\n### Q2 - The \"elif\" conditional statement checks the condition and then runs the code block that appears after it", "answer": "C: bring home fish"}

How old were my parents when we were born?\n\n### Response\n\nBoth parents are 16 and 18 when we were born.\n\n\n### Input\n\nInput: Three friends all have lattes, which are $5 each, at the corner cafe. One friend is 1/5 of the way through a large latte. If two of the friends ordered their lattes together, they would get 25% off. So their total cost for 2 lattes is $9. However, when they are done with the lattes, one of the friends tips the barista $0.5. How much did each of the friends save by ordering their lattes together?\n\nAnswer: $0.25\n\n### Instructions\n\nWhat is the answer to the question?\n\n### What answer do you expect?\n\nI think the answer is 0 because I don't think that the three friends would save any money by ordering their drinks together?\n\n### How did you solve this?\n\nI read over the question twice. I guessed that the three friends had to split the cost of the two lattes. The two friends who ordered lattes together would only have to pay $5 for their latte because they got 25% off, so I deducted $5 from the cost of the drinks. The one friend who wasn't with the other two friends would have to pay the rest of their latte on their own so I divided their $5 by four (because there were three friends eating together). Then I subtracted the cost of the drink when you take out the 25% discount off of that cost, and I got $0.25 from that.\n\n### Do you agree with your answer?\n\nYes, because I solved it correctly and because I feel as if there isn't a right answer to this question.\n\n##\n\n### Instuctions\n### The cake was for the birthdays for 7 people.

How long did it take Kate and Sarah to cut down all of the trees if the number of trees they had to cut is 12?\n\n### Response.\n\nThe answer is 20 minutes. Because there are 80 minutes of time, and 80/16 gives us 5 people. There are 5 people to do the job, which would mean it would take 10 minutes for each person.\n\n### Your Turn:\n\n### Input A: One company paid an additional $800 per employee per month in health insurance costs for another six months. Over these six months, the company hired 15 employees, and the additional insurance cost $420 per employee. How much did the company pay in total on health insurance during these six months?\n\n### Input B: In a certain country there are four families. The members of the families include a mother, father, and three children. If the mother is 38 years older than her youngest child, how old is the mother\u2019s oldest child?\n\n### Your Response\n\nThe answer is $4,800. Because there are 6 months for health insurance, and 6/12 gives us 5 people to put in the equation. 5 people times $420 equals $2,100. $2,10 per month times 6 months equals $$12,600.\n\nThe answer to the second equation is 25 years old. 25 equals the three children minus the youngest child, but that youngest child was three years old.

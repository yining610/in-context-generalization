She is able to buy $8 worth of pizza (excluding tax) at a restaurant.  What is the amount of tax on her pizza?  10\n\n### Solution\n\nAssuming this is in the context of a story, we can see that Ann gave away $3/5 of money and kept $3/5 of it for herself. Her left over money is equal to $22.25 - $7.25 = $17.7 which we saw earlier is $8 worth of pizzas (8 = 17.7 rounded). We can therefore assume that the tax (10) on the pizza is equal to 1/8 times the left over money since that's what she spent on pizza (8 = 1/8 * 17.75 rounded).\n\n### Solved\n\nInput:  A bag of marbles is labeled with the number of marbles.

Because of this percentage, a sales tax is added onto the price of most items in the city. Sales tax varies depending on how many taxpayers live in the city. Some people don't like this system because it isn't fair that someone could live in a city and avoid the \"Sales Tax\" portion of their taxes that are being spent on infrastructure and so on. How could sales taxes increase the more people live in a city? Choices:  More taxpayers pay more because they're buying more goods. All residents must pay the percentages even if they aren't taxpayers. A city makes more money due to the number of residents buying more goods. The percentage of sales tax decreases with more residences in a city. Investors are able to charge more in a busy city due to the price increase. \n\nOutput: The percentage of sales tax increases with more residents and more people buying more goods.

{"text": "eaten\n\n### Instruction:Answer the questions after each paragraph\n\n1. In this exercise you will learn how to work with dictionaries. \n    - First of all, a dictionary is a data type, just like an array, so you have to create a dictionary. Let\u2019s say that you want to create a dictionary \u201cemployees\u201d containing the names of 3 employees, John, Jim and Mary. \n    - To create the dictionary use the \u201cdict()\u201d function. For example, to create a dictionary containing the names of the employees, use: \n        ``` \n        d = dict(\"employee1\":\"John\", \"employee2\":\"Jim\", \"employee3\":\"Mary\")\n        ```\n   \n   2. Now let\u2019s look at how we can access the values stored in a dictionary: use the special square bracket notation to access the value at the specified index. For example, to get the value stored in the key \u201cemployee1\u201d, use the following:\n         ``` \n         print(d[\"employee1\"])\n        ```\n    - To get the entire dictionary in Python, use the following:\n        ``` \n            for k, v in d.items():\n                print(k, \"=\", v)\n        ```\n\n3. Now let\u2019s use dictionaries to answer a fun question about pandas columns (Pandas is a very popular data library in Python, that has some columns). \n    - In pandas, there are two types of columns. Series are mutable, which means that you can change your Series, and DataFrames are immutable, which means that you simply can\u2019t change these columns because they are meant to hold the same value every time you pull a new value. \n    - Let\u2019s use dictionaries in order to answer which ones are DataFrames and which ones are Series in a Pandas DataFrame.\n        ``` \n             import pandas as pd\n            d = dict(\"Series_A_1\": 0, \"Series_A_2\": 5, \"Series_B\": 10, \"DataFrame_1\": 3, \"DataFrame_2\": 1)\n            pd.DataFrame(d)\n        ```\n   1.

If it is not divisible by 5, the program checks to see if the next character in the string is a vowel.

{"text": "A\n\n#### Solution\n\nI find C++ to be a better choice for learning code than Java since, although Java is the language I use most, it is really inefficient from a performance standpoint (because of the JVM, and also its design philosophy) especially compared to the low level language nature of C++. In addition, the emphasis on OOP in Java means that many developers who are well-versed in Java but have been programming for an extremely long time may actually be a bit lazy in their thinking about good design principles. (Not everybody, but a fair amount). In C++, not as much focus is placed on OOP and thus it is a good choice to learn best practices in design to apply to modern coding in any language. In addition, as a low level language C++ provides greater flexibility for implementation of algorithms in a performant way. And finally, it provides the ability to develop very low-level APIs, such as OpenGL, that are not available in high level languages. I also think it is a better choice since the C library is available within most C++ compilers.\n\n**Input:** The following code takes the values of x and y and calculates the value of x**^2+y**^2. It also calculates the largest value that x**^2+ y**^2 can have if x=-1.\n\nHere is a quick way of checking your code without running it to check for errors: \n1- Put the compiler in \"debug mode\" (which on gcc can be done with \"-g\")\n2- If any error occurs, you will be able to see the exact line of code that caused the error on your output window.\n\n```\n#include <iostream>\n\ndouble square(int x) {\n\treturn (x**2);\n}\n\ndouble square_plus(int x) { // function to calculate x**2+y**2\n\treturn (square(x)*square(y));\n}\nint main(){\n\tconst int x = -1; //this constant cannot be replaced by a variable in C++\n\tint y = 3;\n\tdouble z = square_plus(y);\n\tif (z>2412) { //if the result of square_plus(y) has x=-1 as its largest value then y is the largest\n\t\tdouble max = y;\n\t\treturn max;", "answer": "B: stand upright"}

Choices:  80 * 66 = 210\n\nAnswer: The most general problem of the course is to identify the multiple choice question (i.e. find $f(x)$ so that $f(x) = {f(x):0<x<25}$.)\n\nAn important step in doing this is to remove the variable, so that the question becomes $f(y)$ for $y\\in(0,25)$. But in this case you can't just plug in numbers, you have to plug in numbers which fit the criteria $(0,25)$ with one obvious case (you know that $y$ must be an integer, so there is only one obvious answer).\n\nSo now you have to go through the work to get $0<y<25$. You know that $0<f(x)<25$ - $f(x)$ is some whole number - so what does this mean about the function? If it is a constant $f(x) \\equiv c_x$, then $0<x<24$, so $c_x$ has only $24$ values. There is only one $f(x)$ that fits the criteria $(0,1)$ and $(0,24)$ at the same time, so $f(x)\\equiv c_x$. There must be an odd number between $0$ and $25$, so $f(x)=$ odd number. This odd number is then $f(x)=23$ and your result is:\n\n\\begin{code}\n(input) | (output) | (function) | (equation) | (answer)\n-------------|-----------|----------|-----------|---------\n(0,25)      | 23       | odd integer | 23*25    | 1595\n\noutput = 23 = [x in [0 25), f(x) is an odd integer] ==> [(0,1), (2", "answer": "A: wear shoes"}

She is able to buy $8 worth of pizza (excluding tax) at a restaurant.  What is the amount of tax on her pizza?  10<n><n>### Solution<n><n>Assuming this is in the context of a story, we can see that Ann gave away $3/5 of money and kept $3/5 of it for herself. Her left over money is equal to $22.25 - $7.25 = $17.7 which we saw earlier is $8 worth of pizzas (8 = 17.7 rounded). We can therefore assume that the tax (10) on the pizza is equal to 1/8 times the left over money since that's what she spent on pizza (8 = 1/8 * 17.75 rounded).<n><n>### Solved<n><n>Input:  A bag of marbles is labeled with the number of marbles.

In this exercise you will learn how to work with dictionaries. <n>    - First of all, a dictionary is a data type, just like an array, so you have to create a dictionary. Let’s say that you want to create a dictionary “employees” containing the names of 3 employees, John, Jim and Mary. <n>    - To create the dictionary use the “dict()” function. For example, to create a dictionary containing the names of the employees, use: <n>        ``` <n>        d = dict("employee1":"John", "employee2":"Jim", "employee3":"Mary")<n>        ```<n>   <n>   2. Now let’s look at how we can access the values stored in a dictionary: use the special square bracket notation to access the value at the specified index. For example, to get the value stored in the key “employee1”, use the following:<n>         ``` <n>         print(d["employee1"])<n>        ```<n>    - To get the entire dictionary in Python, use the following:<n>        ``` <n>            for k, v in d.items():<n>                print(k, "=", v)<n>        ```<n><n>3. Now let’s use dictionaries to answer a fun question about pandas columns (Pandas is a very popular data library in Python, that has some columns). <n>    - In pandas, there are two types of columns. Series are mutable, which means that you can change your Series, and DataFrames are immutable, which means that you simply can’t change these columns because they are meant to hold the same value every time you pull a new value. <n>    - Let’s use dictionaries in order to answer which ones are DataFrames and which ones are Series in a Pandas DataFrame.<n>        ``` <n>             import pandas as pd<n>            d = dict("Series_A_1": 0, "Series_A_2": 5, "Series_B": 10, "DataFrame_1": 3, "DataFrame_2": 1)<n>            pd.DataFrame(d)<n>        ```<n>   1. The output should be:<n>        ``` 0 5 10 3 False 10<n>        ```<n>   2. In order to access the

While you've been working at the firm, they’ve had 3 consecutive years of record revenue. After all, it’s your firm's job to make sure this happens and, in fact, they are getting awards for it!

But, he worries that everyone is going to see how profitable the company really is, and he just knows once a jury sees it, they’ll side with the opposing party because they’ll think that there's no way the giant corporation is being forced to pay so much.

You try to explain to him why this is probably not a good idea, but he overrules you. “I know that some of this will be questioned at trial” he said “but I just don't care.

The study found that the average person can expect to see a 2.5 year increase in life expectancy from how long they expected they'd live when the study was started (in 1990) to today (in 2018). However, the study did not break down by state the 2.5 year average increase in life expectancy. The study does note that life expectancy varies greatly upon where you live. For example someone in the District of Columbia should expect to live an average of 81.7 years, whereas someone in Mississippi is expected to live only 76.1 years. What is the difference in years (years in DC minus years in Mississippi) between the maximum and the minimum years in this study?<n>Output: 5<n><n>Input: There are 3 boxes of cookies with an even amount of snickerdoodles and chocolate chip cookies.

In addition, the emphasis on OOP in Java means that many developers who are well-versed in Java but have been programming for an extremely long time may actually be a bit lazy in their thinking about good design principles. (Not everybody, but a fair amount). In C++, not as much focus is placed on OOP and thus it is a good choice to learn best practices in design to apply to modern coding in any language. In addition, as a low level language C++ provides greater flexibility for implementation of algorithms in a performant way. And finally, it provides the ability to develop very low-level APIs, such as OpenGL, that are not available in high level languages. I also think it is a better choice since the C library is available within most C++ compilers.<n><n>**Input:** The following code takes the values of x and y and calculates the value of x**^2+y**^2.

But in this case you can't just plug in numbers, you have to plug in numbers which fit the criteria $(0,25)$ with one obvious case (you know that $y$ must be an integer, so there is only one obvious answer).<n><n>So now you have to go through the work to get $0<y<25$. You know that $0<f(x)<25$ - $f(x)$ is some whole number - so what does this mean about the function? If it is a constant $f(x) \equiv c_x$, then $0<x<24$, so $c_x$ has only $24$ values. There is only one $f(x)$ that fits the criteria $(0,1)$ and $(0,24)$ at the same time, so $f(x)\equiv c_x$. There must be an odd number between $0$ and $25$, so $f(x)=$ odd number. This odd number is then $f(x)=23$ and your result is:<n><n>\begin{code}<n>(input) | (output) | (function) | (equation) | (answer)<n>-------------|-----------|----------|-----------|---------<n>(0,25)      | 23       | odd integer | 23*25    | 1595<n><n>output = 23 = [x in [0 25), f(x) is an odd integer] ==> [(0,1), (2

The loop should first check if enough money has been saved, then ask the player if they want to buy a book. If not, repeat asking if the player wants to buy a book until the player eventually says “stop”.<n>#### Instruction: Improve the code by using a while loop.<n>#### Instruction Use the while loop in the answer to question 2, where the loop will run until the player entered "stop". The loop must ask if the player has enough money to buy the book. If the player doesn't have enough money, the loop should ask them if their money exceeded the cost of the book by.50.If the player's money exceeded the cost by.50, the loop should ask if they want to buy the book again. Continue the loop until the player entered "Stop".<n>#### Instruction: Update the code by using the loop in the answer to Question 2. The loop will run until the user typed "stop". When the loop runs, it should check to see if you have enough money to buy some candy. If you don't, you should check if you have at least $0.50 more in savings. If you have at least $1.00 more saved, you should have a choice of either buying 1 or 2 pieces of candy. <n>#### Instruction: Now write the code that works on paper.<n>The loop in Question 5 is going to run until you type "stop". When the program runs it should ask if you have enough money for candy ($1.00)<n>Next, the program should ask if you have at least $.50 more in savnings and if the answer is "Yes" the program should ask if the amount of candy you would like to purchase is 1 or 2.

Choices:  C: a big joke E: impossible D: a big mistake F: a mistake B: a wrong one\n\n### Response\nC\n### Input: The sun is blocked by a cloud that covers it exactly. The clouds reflect exactly half of the sun's rays. A cloudy day is 3 times cloudier than an overcast day. Given the percentages of radiation blocked, how do you calculate the difference between a cloudy day and an overcast day?\n\n### Output: The difference of 30% is 40%\n\n### Input 2\nThe sun is blocked by a big cloud that covers it exactly and the clouds reflect exactly half of solar radiation. On a cloudy day half of the sun is blocked by clouds and 90% is reflected, so 90/100 = 9/10 of the sun is blocked, and 9/10 * 50% = 45% of the rays pass through the clouds unblocked.  Also the percentage of sun blocked by clouds = 1/3 * ((1/2)*15) * (10-100) = (1/2)*13*(10-10) = 1.5% or 0.0015.\nTo know the difference between cloudy and overcast days, we use the formula Cloudy day = 3 * Overcast day\nand we use 13*0.0010 and 45% instead, the difference is 40% of the difference which is 14%\n\n### Solution\nCloudy day = Overcast day * 3\nCloudy day x Overcast day = 3 x Overcast day\nCloudy day = (3 x Overcast day) * Overcast day\nCloudly day = 9x Overcast day\nCloudley day * 9 = 9x Overcraft day\nA cloud day = 9x overcast day is 108% of an overcast day\n\n### Input\nIn one day there are 24 hours, 1/2 of the day is shadowless and", "answer": "B: refrigerator"}

Now if the choice is A then the total number of fire extingushers is g + d +h. From this value the least possible value is 8 because d + h is less than 8 and if the value was g h would be 0 and since d is a minimum the value d of 0 is the lowest and therefore no higher. The maximum value is 6 because g+h is greater than 6 and there in only 10 options so the answer is A with value 8.\n\n### Response 2:\nLet the doll house contain the greatest number of fire extingishers which is given a value d. Let the house contain the second most by the value h and the garage contain the least with the value g, so we know that \n\nd+g+h\n\nThe numbers of fire extingishgers by the house and garage will likely be 99 and 5 respectively. The total could also be more or less and so there is a set of possibilities with number ranging from 98 to 100 and 0 to 5. There are also possibilities for negative numbers. So if you have the choice B then the number is 101 and the choice C is 0 or 100. The choice D is likely not to have any because the number of fire extenguishers would need to be at least 20 if you consider how many the garage contains. The choice E is likely not to have a lot of firs extingushers because they are for children and don't need many.", "answer": "B: hospital"}

If on Wednesdays I do half the usual amount of chores, how much chore time do I do in a day as opposed to doing all of each day's chores?\nAnswer: 0.125\n\nInput; A girl was found murdered in the woods after being missing for three months. The police discovered a trail of blood from the woods to the girl's house ten blocks away. They concluded that the murderer was either the girl's nextdoor neighbor or her father, but that it was not the murderer's brother. If the girl's brother had murdered her, then the murderer must have been either the boy's father or his nextdoor neighbor. The father and the nextdoor neighbor would have alternating days without rest between working, and one man always sleeps, in addition to the work days. However, the alternating days would have a pattern of 3-7-1-3-7-1, with the third day being the man's day of rest. If we are given that there are five different people: the three murder suspects, the girl, and her brother, two of the women (the nextdoor neighbor and the girl's mother) are given the day of 5. This means that the third must be the girl's father, or the two days inbetween: 2 and 4. This means the neighbor is either the boy's sister or one of the girls. However, the days the sister sleeps (1 and 7) alternate with the days her father sleeps (2 and 5) (and the boy sleeps only on his father's day of rest (3). If the sister were the murderer, she would only be required to work days odd days, and sleep on her father's day of night, meaning the alternating days for her would be 3-5-1-5-3, with the boy sleeping on 1 days (even numbers). However, if the boy were murdered, and if these patterns were correct, the days that the sister sleeps would be 5-1-5 and 7-3-7, which shows that two murders would not be possible (both", "answer": "C: human"}

{"text": "C) Wins\n\n### Reasoning:\nAs the instruction says, all five are true conditions. Because wrestling does not cause competition, it does not cause blood. If the man was winning, he would not be bloodied as he would still be in physical contact.  Therefore, blood cannot be the result of winning or competition.  Because blood is not the result of winning or competing, it must be the result of winning.\n\n### Input The man was playfully wrestiling with a woman he was emmined with...woman is enamored with the man.Woman has been enamored with man for a couple years.If all the woman did was wrestle with you for a couple years, how many wins would you get in that period of time.Answers: B,C,D,E\n\n### Response\n\nD) Erections\n\n### Reasoing:\nBecause of the fact that the instruction says that the woman has been enamored (the word means to be in love with someone) the man has been in a relationship for a couple years. If the man wrestles with the woman and they both wrestle for that amount of time, the man could also accumulate a number of wins with each period of intensive contact. Also, there are multiple definitions for wins depending on the context. It is possible that wins can refer to a number of wins which could be referred to in the past, and not refer to specific ones. Therefore, wins can be erections for some definitions. Erections would be a correct answer. Because every win is not equal ercitions would be one of the possible wins for the man for each period of time they were together.\n\n### Other", "answer": "E: erections"}

{"text": "The question asks to show the mathematical statement that describes the relationship between the number of Doerbers and the number of Shnauzers. If you look at the first sentence, the number of Dobermans is \u201chow many times, then the number of Schnazeers is half, then the total is 45. The relationship is equal to four times the Doberman number plus twice the number of Schnauer number.\n\nThe second question asks how many Dobermans can sell for 1.20 each times. This is equal to half the number of Dobermen (20) plus the number of Schnazyers minus 10 (since 10 of the Dobermans are going to be sold for 1. 20 each) plus the rest of the Dobermans. The Dobermans are equal to the number of Schnazurers and the Schnazyers are equal to 1.20 times 6 times the number of Doerberman. The total should then equal 76.70.\n\nThe third question again asks to relate how many of that many of a thing. From here the number of hours past noon and a given building is how many feet.

How many different 6-digit numbers are possible in scenario 1?\n\n### Choices\n\n3\n\n7\n\n2\n\n1\n\nAnswers: 73\n\n### Explanation:\n\nIf the number you pick is even, adding 1 to each digit leaves it even again. To make it odd, add 7 to make each digit odd. Then the digits will be in order from largest to smallest.\n\nTo pick an even number from 1000 to 9999 with only prime numbers, you would add a prime number to each digit to make it odd and reorder the digits making it even.  The result is an even-odd switch.\n\n### Input and Explanation:\nIn this case, you subtract 1:\n\nThe question is asking for the largest number you can choose in this example. If you subtract 10 from the number you choose, then the total is still the same when you add 7 to the digits.

{"text": "C\n\n### Discussion:\n\nThe answer is C, carved. A piece of wood reflecting would require light to pass through it and strike the object directly behind. This means it would need to be polished, carved or composted. If it was composted, then there must be a sufficient amount of light to get through all the decayed material. This means that there would be a lot of open areas in the wood meaning that much of the wood would be burned as opposed to decayed.\n\nIf the piece of wood is polished, then much of the light would only be reflected in the top of the wood and it would be difficult to see your reflection because you would not be directly behind it. The light would either only reflect from the surface or it would reflect at a right angle making it difficult to obtain a reflection. Polished wood does not absorb much light and is not very reflective.\n\nEven a rough piece of wood that has no reflection in it will absorb more of the light than there needs to be for you to obtain a reflection for it to absorb all the light without reflecting any of it which would cause for you to not be able to see your own reflection in it.\n\n### Input : How many people work in a building that has 6 floors and each floor has 36 windows?\n\n### Answer: 18\n\n### Input  : In each of 3 consecutive quarters, 10% more cars than in the last quarter were bought each year.

At another airport, 21 passengers boarded.  It is determined that the plane's capacity is 48 seats or 36 full cots. The plane also has 16 empty seats. How many cots would be filled?\n\n### Solution\n\nThe plane's capacity is (16 + 21) - 16? 36 = 25\n\nThere are 16 empty seats: 16 \u00d7 9.6 cm = 150.4 cm\n\n### Explain solution\n\n16 passengers board the plane at airport (1).  At airport (2) 21 passengers board the plane,\nwhich brings the total number of passengers to 47.  We subtract 16 seats that are currently unoccupied.\nThere are now [(47 - 16) + 1] full cots on the plane.  There are 16 seats that were boarded at airport two.\nAs there are 9.6 cm of space between the bottom of each cot's frame and the floor of the plane, the total\narea of space used by the cot (each has a width of 9.6 cm) is 150.8 cm.  If the number of cots filled is\nthe amount of space used by cots, then the total length of the cots filled on the plane is 150 cm.\n\n### Solution 2: (16 + 41)? 3\n\nThe capacity of the plane is 48, meaning it can fit 64 people. The plane took 32 passengers from airport 1 and 41 passengers from airport 2,\nand there were still 16 seats left. As there are four empty seats per cot, we can fill 16 cots, each with seats and space,\nand leave 48? (47? 16) = 4 empty seats.  The four cots each take up", "answer": "C: office"}

The smallest child is an eighth grader, so he must be 8 feet tall. He is taller than another eighth grader, who is 7 feet tall. Therefore all of the taller eighth graders are taller than that person.  The biggest child, being 1 foot taller, is 1 foot taller. This must be the sibling of the eighth grader.

The Martin is on sale for $1,500, and I can only get $1,000 for it. The other guitar is a Fender. It sells for $600. I can get $300 for it. I don't know how to play guitar. What do I say when people ask about how much I sold it for?  (b) My friend says the other day, \"I'm going to go play mini-golf.  Do you have any mini-golf sticks that I can use?\" I looked into my mini-golf equipment closet.  I said, \"I don't have any mini-golfer sticks, but I do have a few mini-golf clubs.\" He said they are different.  Is he correct?\n\n### Response:(a) I sold it for 800 dollars...(b) No they are not...\n\nIn (a), the guitars are different because they are different instruments.  In (b), my friend is correct because mini-golfer refers to a person who plays mini-golf, and mini-golf clubs refer to the clubs used in the game.

To solve the problem, divide the number of players with the number of days.\n\n### Inferences:\nAs you can see, the order in which you pick the letters has a huge bearing on the outcome of the algorithm. The algorithm has to guess in a sequence that correctly determines if the letter you think is correct is in the code or not. I have found that the best guesses are from the right to left, but that varies depending on which letters you picked on any given guess.\n\n### Algorithm:\nI am going to try to solve this by a backtracking algorithm. First, let us say I have chosen the answer A. If the letter \"C\" is not in the code then I proceed to the next letter \"B\" and then to the next letter \"D\". However, since the letter \"D\" is in the code then I get the final result as false. We have to go back to the start and guess the letter \"B\". If at the first level of guessing we get the letter \"B\" then we can go to the same process with the letter \"C\".\n\nThe pseudocode is like this:\n\n```javascript\nfunction backTracking(answers, letters){\n  let counter=0;\n  for (a in letters) {            \n    if (answers[counter]==a) {    \n      if", "answer": "D: pleasure"}

Then, using the information in the passage, write a response in the box (box can be seen by clicking \"Show Answer\" below).\n\nWhat is the difference between a \u201cwife beater\u201d t-shirt and the kind you\u2019d wear to a gym? You can probably guess the answer to that one. But what sort of difference does a sweater make in how warm you get \u2014 and how warm you keep? The simple fact is that sweater\u2019s are significantly better at keeping a body warm than t-shirts are. But why then do they take a sweater twice as long to dry after getting wet? \n\nIt turns out that sweaters don\u2019t get wet at all. Sweaters dry faster because sweaters don\u2019t absorb any more liquid than they already contain; t-shirts get wet because they can\u2019t. A t-shirt\u2019s fibers make it possible for water to get in, and a cotton dries faster than something silky, because the silky thing can hold a lot more water. Sweater are made of cotton, and cotton is absorbent, but a sweater is still much smaller than the average t-shirt, and thus it doesn\u2019t take on nearly as much water. As a sweater gets soaked, it gets heavier but can\u2019t become heavier. T-shirts, on the other hand can get really heavy and then get light after they lose all the water they can hold onto. This is why it feels to you as though sweaters take a long time to dry, even if they haven\u2019t absorbed much water at all.\n\n<b>Your Response</b><p></p><p><input id=\"box\" class=\"typeahead\" type=\"text\"></p>\n<img src =\"assets/img/typeahead.gif\" id=\"ajaxloader\" style=\"display:none;\">Loading...<input id=\"submit\" data-task=\"0fbe7bff-d1e5-49bb-a5cc-c7669365a306\" value=\"Submit\" type=\"submit\"><img", "answer": "A: middle east"}

We don't need one for each variable though, and we should define each variable with the appropriate type:\n\n\\begin{code}\nclass Test:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.name = 'foo'\n        self.age = '123'\n\\end{code}{1}\n\nThese are both strings, so it makes sense to initialize them as such (", "answer": "A: new hampshire"}

Sally fills her feeders each morning before dawn, and then takes them outside to hang them from their hooks in the garden. In the evening, she takes each feeder inside to wash it and refill it with seeds. Here's the problem: When a bird flies into one of her feeders and spills or drops seeds, she replaces the entire feeder instead of just replacing any seeds missed. Suppose the cardinal feeder was filled with 24 morsels of seed. That day, a cardinal got one morsel of seed and a blackbird got 11 morsels. When Sally brought the feeders back inside, they were each half full of seeds. When she emptied the cardinal feeder she replaced it with the new cardinal feeder because it was still half full of seeds and left the empty one out to dry from this day's mess. Then she filled the dove feeder up with the remaining nine seeds it had left, and replaced it, even though it is still half full of sevens seeds left over from one previous day's fill.

{"text": "Choice C, entertain\n\n### Instructions:Answer the question presented in the title.\n### Instruction A: How does a cat's breath smell like cheddar cheese?\n### Instruction B (Bonus):  What is the difference between \u201cCrucial Few\u201d and \u201cTrim Tab\u201d? How could the \u201cTrim Tab\u201d affect the \u201cCrucial Focus\u201d?\n\n### Crucial Focus\n\nThe crucial focus (not to be confused with a crucial moment) is a goal or point in time where an action must be taken. The crucial focus is determined by the time it will take to solve a problem (or prevent an issue). Therefore, the crucial focus is the point where we must focus our time and attention to solve a problem or prevent an issue. The crucial focus might help you determine what your next task will be if it prevents further problems from occurring.\n\nFor example, if you have a leaky roof and can\u2019t afford to fix it, you cannot buy new tires for the car. If you decide, however, to put off fixing the roof and do not get it fixed, your car then needs new tires. The crucial focus helps you eliminate any unimportant details. This ensures you do not unnecessarily spend time doing things that are not helping to fix or prevent the problem. In this example, fixing the roof and your car\u2019s tires became more important once they were dependent on each other.\n\nThe crucial few have the most impact on or cause the greatest amount of stress. Stressful problems are the result of the crucial few, not the trivial many. \n\nThe key to solving any problem is to focus on the crucial few. These are the 20% of the action steps that will produce 80% of the results. Identifying the crucial few and focusing on them increases your efficiency and reduces your wasted effort.\n\n### Trimtab\n\nIn general, trim tabs serve as an additional rudder on boats. They help to steer the boat in a certain direction, making turns easier. They typically work when a boat\u2019s rudder cannot handle a heavy current. In business, a trim tab refers to a small change that can have a large and significant impact on a business\u2019 sales.\n\n### Other\n\n### Insurance sales", "answer": "C: entertain"}

It is 1/4 filled. It holds 20 gifts more than Tuesday, but still holds the same amount of gifts as Monday. How many gifts does it hold on Monday?\nOutput: \n```\nInput:The bag is a bag containing a number of gifts. The bag holds a number of gifts on monday and that same number of gifts on tuesday. The bag holds a total of 72 gifts on monday, tuesday, wednesday, and so of it. The bag is 1/4 full on monday and on every day there after.\nOutput:The bag holds 48 gifts on Monday. The bag gains 20 gifts every day and gets half full by tuesday. If the bag holds 48 on monday then it must also hold 20 on tuesday. Then the bag must hold 72 and be half full. This means that the bag holds 72 and the bag has to get a quarter full.\n```\n### Response: \n\n```\nOn each day the gift are added from Tuesday.  On Tuesday the bag is filled and on Monday the bag still holds a quarter the gifts.  It cannot hold more than 72 gifts because 1/4 the gifts are given away everyday and each day the same amount are added from Tues.\n\nSo in order to give 48 to everyone over 4 months the bag has to hold 48. \nSo each day the gifts are divided by 4. On Tuesday the gifts are 48 and on Monday a quarter the gifts are missing. \n\n\nOutput: \nThere are 48 gifts held on monday.

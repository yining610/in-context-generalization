If it was suppose to be there then we would have a fraction. We would say 109^7.\n\n*Method two: First notice that there is an answer, I put it in the last solution.\nSo what did I do? I used the prime factorization to find the primes in these numbers, 109 & 792. I used prime factorization on both of them to find the factors and I added them. I did this because 109 is the square root of 109^2. Likewise, 792 is the square root of seven hundred nintythree thousand two hundred.\n\n109^5 equals seven hundred ninety-two.\n\nLet me explain it in steps:\n\n  *Step 1* Start dividing the number, here I'm dividing with the prime numbers.

The Number of Schnauzerd\n\nFor example, if we had 20 Doberman puppie and 40 Schnauzers, then the next step would be:\n\n5 is 3/8 times the number of Doeraman puppies.\n\nThis could then be re-written as:\n\n5 * 8 = 60 is 3/8th of 20.\n\nTherefore, the number of Schnausers is 60-20=40.\n\nNote that the answer is 45, but it is also acceptable to round up to 50!\n\n---\n#### 2.

Number of remaining toothbrushs of Dr. Banks.\n\nSo the total of the 3 remaining months are less than the total of all 5 months.\n\nWe know that the first and last weeks contains tooth brushes, therefore the numbers we need to concentrate on is the numbers in the middle.\n\nLet p1 be the number of toothbrashes in the first two weeks.\n\nWe now calculate p1+p2\n\nSo p1+p2 = 330 + 115 = 445\n\nWe know that p1 = 330 therefore", "answer": "E: children suffer"}

I then click the number 39. There will be a little number circle that pops up. If I were to click that, I will get a red line over all of my typing.  My friend then goes in and changes my code, but I\u2019m still not sure what\u2019s going on.  There\u2019s this option called \u201cpencil code\u201d. My friend is like, \u201ccheck 13,12,11; is there a 13? Let me look.\u201d She scrolls down and clicks 12 (so I assume she finds the 12). It goes from 12 to 11. Next she clicks another 1, and there\u2019s another 1. Next one is 11, then 10, then 9, then 8. Next thing I know I\u2019m clicking 9, 8, 7 and I\u2019m back to where I started. How do I change code and get the right answer?\nOutput: This is how it's done: when my friend clicked \"Pencil code\" it changed my pencil code, so I have to change it back from \"10\" to \"3\". The number will change from \"3\" to \"13\" right now but I have to leave it on \"3\". My friend then clicked \"0\" in the pen. She then clicks \"1\" then the number will change to 1. After that, she clicks \"2\" and it will change to 2. Now we know what the number is. (2) go to \u201cpencil code\u201d (3) put a \u201c0\u201d (4) put \u201c1\u201d (5) put \u201c2\u201d (6) go down (7) put \u201c9\u201d (8) go down (9) put \u201c6\u201d (10) go down again (11) choose the circle", "answer": "B: opera"}

In this problem set, I would like you to move to creating objects. An [object in programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basics-of-object-oriented-programming-in-java-with-examples-javadoc/) is a logical structure that contains data, called `fields`, and functions to operate on this data, called `methods`. You may or may not have used objects before. If you have, this problem set will solidify the concepts that you have learned in the past about objects. If not, this problem set will introduce you to the concepts that you will soon learn about objects.  \n\nThe [object creation](https://www.javatpoint.com/object-creation-in-c-with-examples) process involves writing a piece of code that is called a constructor, which creates the new object from the data and the functions that it will contain.\n\nEach of your classes for this problem set are supposed to be objects that model different objects about the world.  Remember that you are supposed to draw your own object model, and that the model should contain both data about the object, and how that object should behave.\n\n> **Note:**\n> \n> If you have not used objects before, or would just like a refresher, please go through the following links:\n> \n> * <a href=\"https://www.javabeginner.com/article/object-oriented-tutorial-java-tutorials\">Object-Oriented Tutorial</a> and <a href=\"https:javabeginner.courses.com/", "answer": "C: jar"}

Tigerlily recently got a new suitcase and packed it so that she would be comfortable while she traveled. On one of her trips, Tigerlily's suitcase had to fit into another suitcase in order to fit underneath a plane seat. A suitcase that fits into another suitcase is called a suitcase into a suitcase, or simply a suitcase within a suitcase.\n\nThe first suitcase, the suitcase for Tigerlily, is 2 feet 2 inches long and 1 foot 7 inches wide. Her suitcase is 1.5 inches longer than her suitcase. The length of Tigerlily'ssuitcase plus the length of the other suitcase makes ten and a half  inches. Tigerlily'smusic case is bigger than the length of the other one. The length of Tiggerlily'smusics case is four feet, and it is  the same length as her suitcase. \nThe second suitcase that Tinnee uses is a black suitcase that is 34 inches long, 14 inches wide, and 8 inches deep. It is one inch smaller than her suitcase. Tigerlily decided to place her large red suitcasethree and a half feet in back of her black suitcase, incase it was needed. She kept some lightweight clothes in it for unexpected weather. What is the total combined dimensions of the suitcases she used? How many suitcases does Tigerlily end up using on the plane?\n\nThere's more!\n\nTigerlilythought that she would be on the 14:02 flight from London Heathrow to Denver Airport. If her music case is one foot and three inches deep, what is the height of the black suitcase?", "answer": "C: engine"}

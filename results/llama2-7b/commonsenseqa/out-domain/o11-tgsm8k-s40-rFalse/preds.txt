If it was suppose to be there then we would have a fraction. We would say 109^7.<n><n>*Method two: First notice that there is an answer, I put it in the last solution.<n>So what did I do? I used the prime factorization to find the primes in these numbers, 109 & 792. I used prime factorization on both of them to find the factors and I added them. I did this because 109 is the square root of 109^2. Likewise, 792 is the square root of seven hundred nintythree thousand two hundred.<n><n>109^5 equals seven hundred ninety-two.<n><n>Let me explain it in steps:<n><n>  *Step 1* Start dividing the number, here I'm dividing with the prime numbers. In this case primes means odd numbers.

If he can make a certain amount of money every year, find the total amount he would make working full-time, and the additional amount he'd make working part-time, up to 50 total hours per week.<n>Output: 3200<n><n>Input: How many of a certain type of car are there in a city if 50% are older than 10 years and 80% of those that are not older than 10 are newer than the average in the city. 5000 are over 10 years old, 2500 of them are newer than the average, so we make the assumption that 100% of the 2500 have been added to the 5000 for a total of 7500.  Now the problem becomes 7500-5000= 2500 or the number of cars that aren't over 10 years.  40% of them are older, so 2500*40% = 1000.  Now you only have 1500 left to find, so 1500/80% = 187.5.  Then we divide by 50% and the answer is 375 cars.<n>Output: 135 cars<n><n>Input: In a car showroom, cars can be classified into three categories: sports cars, coupes, and sedans.

(Levels are the same for each employee.) The chart shows the levels in which each employee works by arranging letters from A to H, one for each possible expertise. Each letter represents a level, and in each position, the number in the row indicates that number of people working at that level.  If the chart is arranged correctly, where do we find the 2 people who are expert carpenters?<n>Output:AB<n><n>Input:A shopkeeper's assistant has 44 apples and an 8 pound bag of apples.

The Number of Schnauzerd<n><n>For example, if we had 20 Doberman puppie and 40 Schnauzers, then the next step would be:<n><n>5 is 3/8 times the number of Doeraman puppies.<n><n>This could then be re-written as:<n><n>5 * 8 = 60 is 3/8th of 20.<n><n>Therefore, the number of Schnausers is 60-20=40.<n><n>Note that the answer is 45, but it is also acceptable to round up to 50!<n><n>---<n>#### 2. Dr. Banks number of toothbrushes<n><n>For example, there are 330 total toothbrushes and then we give 68 and then 36:<n><n>1<n>2<n>3<n>1<n>2<n>......<n><n>### 3. Number of remaining toothbrushs of Dr. Banks.<n><n>So the total of the 3 remaining months are less than the total of all 5 months.<n><n>We know that the first and last weeks contains tooth brushes, therefore the numbers we need to concentrate on is the numbers in the middle.<n><n>Let p1 be the number of toothbrashes in the first two weeks.<n><n>We now calculate p1+p2<n><n>So p1+p2 = 330 + 115 = 445<n><n>We know that p1 = 330 therefore

Where are the directions?<n>Output: Here are the directions: (1) click “start coding”. I recommend doing the instructions below on Pencilcode. You will see that 3*13=39. I then click the number 39. There will be a little number circle that pops up. If I were to click that, I will get a red line over all of my typing.  My friend then goes in and changes my code, but I’m still not sure what’s going on.  There’s this option called “pencil code”. My friend is like, “check 13,12,11; is there a 13? Let me look.” She scrolls down and clicks 12 (so I assume she finds the 12). It goes from 12 to 11. Next she clicks another 1, and there’s another 1. Next one is 11, then 10, then 9, then 8. Next thing I know I’m clicking 9, 8, 7 and I’m back to where I started. How do I change code and get the right answer?<n>Output: This is how it's done: when my friend clicked "Pencil code" it changed my pencil code, so I have to change it back from "10" to "3". The number will change from "3" to "13" right now but I have to leave it on "3". My friend then clicked "0" in the pen. She then clicks "1" then the number will change to 1. After that, she clicks "2" and it will change to 2. Now we know what the number is. (2) go to “pencil code” (3) put a “0” (4) put “1” (5) put “2” (6) go down (7) put “9” (8) go down (9) put “6” (10) go down again (11) choose the circle

Including the following numbers: 0, 10, 15, 20, 35, 40, 60, 65, 90, and 150.<n><n><n>### Solution<n><n>Use `int` in order to store the integer values. You can check if a number is even using the `div()` function. Finally, you can output the equation you entered using a formatting string. The format string will specify how you need to print your output. `float` is a data type that stores floating point values. It requires that you enter the value as a string.<n>The following code will solve these types of questions. <n>```cpp<n>#include <iostream><n><n>using namespace std;<n><n><n>int main() {<n><n>    int int1;<n>    float float1;<n><n>    string op1;<n><n>    cout << "Hello, welcome to the number solver website!" << endl;<n>    cout << "Please choose if you want integer or float value: " << endl;<n>    cin >> op1;<n>    cout << op1 << endl;<n><n>    if (op1 == "int") {<n>        cout << "Please enter the equation and the value of int you want: " << endl; <n>        cin >> int1;<n>        cout << "Your answer is: " << int1 << endl; <n><n>    } else if (op1 ==  "float") {<n>        cout<< "Please enter the equation here:";<n>        cin>>float1;<n>        cout<<"Your answer is: "<<float1;<n>    }<n>

It sends you back to the year you were born. You are in year <i>n</i>, back in time. Now, here’s the interesting part—the river near where you landed has the property that every hour the banks of the river gain 11 pebbles. You have to find where the banks of the river are at the exact midpoint of the hour, from 0 to 24. <br /><br /><n>Your task is to write a Python program that counts up the number of pebbles from each point on the bank, going left to right (where the bank is on the Left). It counts the number of pebble up until that point, using a <i>minimum</i> value, and an <i>index</i>. For example:<n><br /><n><n>```<n> 11 12 13 14 pebbles<n><n> 11 pebble -> [11] x 0   <n> 23 pebble -> [21, 11] x 1<n> 13 pebble ->  [23, 11]  x 2<n>```<n><n>You can then determine that the exact midpoint is 11 pebles from the 21<sup>st</sup> pebble, so the answer is “banks with 21 pebbles” <n><n><n>#### Instruments for this task:<n>Python -> Counter<n><n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question.<n><n>Input = “What is the sum of an even and an odd number, both of which are palindromic?”<n><n>Answer = “The sum will be itself (an odd number) or 1 (an even number).”<n><n>---<n><n># Chapter 6<n><n># 6.1 Taking Input<n><n>## 6.1.1<n>

In this problem set, I would like you to move to creating objects. An [object in programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basics-of-object-oriented-programming-in-java-with-examples-javadoc/) is a logical structure that contains data, called `fields`, and functions to operate on this data, called `methods`. You may or may not have used objects before. If you have, this problem set will solidify the concepts that you have learned in the past about objects. If not, this problem set will introduce you to the concepts that you will soon learn about objects.  <n><n>The [object creation](https://www.javatpoint.com/object-creation-in-c-with-examples) process involves writing a piece of code that is called a constructor, which creates the new object from the data and the functions that it will contain.<n><n>Each of your classes for this problem set are supposed to be objects that model different objects about the world.  Remember that you are supposed to draw your own object model, and that the model should contain both data about the object, and how that object should behave.<n><n>> **Note:**<n>> <n>> If you have not used objects before, or would just like a refresher, please go through the following links:<n>> <n>> * <a href="https://www.javabeginner.com/article/object-oriented-tutorial-java-tutorials">Object-Oriented Tutorial</a> and <a href="https:javabeginner.courses.com/

So 10% of the original price should be 20.

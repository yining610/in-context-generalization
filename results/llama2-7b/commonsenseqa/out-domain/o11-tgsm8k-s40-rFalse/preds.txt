The clouds reflect exactly half of the sun's rays. A cloudy day is 3 times cloudier than an overcast day. Given the percentages of radiation blocked, how do you calculate the difference between a cloudy day and an overcast day?<n><n>### Output: The difference of 30% is 40%<n><n>### Input 2<n>The sun is blocked by a big cloud that covers it exactly and the clouds reflect exactly half of solar radiation. On a cloudy day half of the sun is blocked by clouds and 90% is reflected, so 90/100 = 9/10 of the sun is blocked, and 9/10 * 50% = 45% of the rays pass through the clouds unblocked.  Also the percentage of sun blocked by clouds = 1/3 * ((1/2)*15) * (10-100) = (1/2)*13*(10-10) = 1.5% or 0.0015.<n>To know the difference between cloudy and overcast days, we use the formula Cloudy day = 3 * Overcast day<n>and we use 13*0.0010 and 45% instead, the difference is 40% of the difference which is 14%<n><n>### Solution<n>Cloudy day = Overcast day * 3<n>Cloudy day x Overcast day = 3 x Overcast day<n>Cloudy day = (3 x Overcast day) * Overcast day<n>Cloudly day = 9x Overcast day<n>Cloudley day * 9 = 9x Overcraft day<n>A cloud day = 9x overcast day is 108% of an overcast day<n><n>### Input<n>In one day there are 24 hours, 1/2 of the day is shadowless and

Each violin has 4 strings. If the total number of strings among the ukuleles, guitars, and violins is 40 strings, how many violins does Francis' family have?<n>Answer: 2<n><n>Input: On each of 7 Mondays, it rained 1.5 centimeters.

Choices:  A: garage B: hospital C: boat D: house E: doll house<n><n>### Response:		<n>Let the number of fire extinguisher in the garage be given a value g, the number in the house be given a value h, and the value in the doll house be given a value d. Now if the choice is A then the total number of fire extingushers is g + d +h. From this value the least possible value is 8 because d + h is less than 8 and if the value was g h would be 0 and since d is a minimum the value d of 0 is the lowest and therefore no higher. The maximum value is 6 because g+h is greater than 6 and there in only 10 options so the answer is A with value 8.<n><n>### Response 2:<n>Let the doll house contain the greatest number of fire extingishers which is given a value d. Let the house contain the second most by the value h and the garage contain the least with the value g, so we know that <n><n>d+g+h<n><n>The numbers of fire extingishgers by the house and garage will likely be 99 and 5 respectively. The total could also be more or less and so there is a set of possibilities with number ranging from 98 to 100 and 0 to 5. There are also possibilities for negative numbers. So if you have the choice B then the number is 101 and the choice C is 0 or 100. The choice D is likely not to have any because the number of fire extenguishers would need to be at least 20 if you consider how many the garage contains. The choice E is likely not to have a lot of firs extingushers because they are for children and don't need many.

In the last question, it rained 25 inches, which converts to 25.25 cm. There's 4 cm in one inch.  Therefore, I was given the formula: 5 x 3=15, 5 x 7=35, and 5 x 9=45 to find this answer. The number of cm=45+(4-15) cm, which I simplified into the answer of 35. This means that it rained 35 more cm on Tuesday than Monday. E is the last correct answer, because A=f, B=basement, and C=sink.<n>

The police discovered a trail of blood from the woods to the girl's house ten blocks away. They concluded that the murderer was either the girl's nextdoor neighbor or her father, but that it was not the murderer's brother. If the girl's brother had murdered her, then the murderer must have been either the boy's father or his nextdoor neighbor. The father and the nextdoor neighbor would have alternating days without rest between working, and one man always sleeps, in addition to the work days. However, the alternating days would have a pattern of 3-7-1-3-7-1, with the third day being the man's day of rest. If we are given that there are five different people: the three murder suspects, the girl, and her brother, two of the women (the nextdoor neighbor and the girl's mother) are given the day of 5. This means that the third must be the girl's father, or the two days inbetween: 2 and 4. This means the neighbor is either the boy's sister or one of the girls. However, the days the sister sleeps (1 and 7) alternate with the days her father sleeps (2 and 5) (and the boy sleeps only on his father's day of rest (3). If the sister were the murderer, she would only be required to work days odd days, and sleep on her father's day of night, meaning the alternating days for her would be 3-5-1-5-3, with the boy sleeping on 1 days (even numbers). However, if the boy were murdered, and if these patterns were correct, the days that the sister sleeps would be 5-1-5 and 7-3-7, which shows that two murders would not be possible (both

Choices:  A: competition B: blood C: wins D: medals E: erections<n><n>### Response:		<n>C) Wins<n><n>### Reasoning:<n>As the instruction says, all five are true conditions. Because wrestling does not cause competition, it does not cause blood. If the man was winning, he would not be bloodied as he would still be in physical contact.  Therefore, blood cannot be the result of winning or competition.  Because blood is not the result of winning or competing, it must be the result of winning.<n><n>### Input The man was playfully wrestiling with a woman he was emmined with...woman is enamored with the man.Woman has been enamored with man for a couple years.If all the woman did was wrestle with you for a couple years, how many wins would you get in that period of time.Answers: B,C,D,E<n><n>### Response<n><n>D) Erections<n><n>### Reasoing:<n>Because of the fact that the instruction says that the woman has been enamored (the word means to be in love with someone) the man has been in a relationship for a couple years. If the man wrestles with the woman and they both wrestle for that amount of time, the man could also accumulate a number of wins with each period of intensive contact. Also, there are multiple definitions for wins depending on the context. It is possible that wins can refer to a number of wins which could be referred to in the past, and not refer to specific ones. Therefore, wins can be erections for some definitions. Erections would be a correct answer. Because every win is not equal ercitions would be one of the possible wins for the man for each period of time they were together.<n><n>### Other<n>

Choices:  A: northern B: nome C: tromsø D: finnmark E: vadsø<n><n>### Response:		<n>The question asks to show the mathematical statement that describes the relationship between the number of Doerbers and the number of Shnauzers. If you look at the first sentence, the number of Dobermans is “how many times, then the number of Schnazeers is half, then the total is 45. The relationship is equal to four times the Doberman number plus twice the number of Schnauer number.<n><n>The second question asks how many Dobermans can sell for 1.20 each times. This is equal to half the number of Dobermen (20) plus the number of Schnazyers minus 10 (since 10 of the Dobermans are going to be sold for 1. 20 each) plus the rest of the Dobermans. The Dobermans are equal to the number of Schnazurers and the Schnazyers are equal to 1.20 times 6 times the number of Doerberman. The total should then equal 76.70.<n><n>The third question again asks to relate how many of that many of a thing. From here the number of hours past noon and a given building is how many feet. So the number of hours after noon is the number of feet for that hour.<n><n>The fifth question asks how many brass players there are compared to other ones. Brass is half woodwind, which in turn is twice the number to percussionists. The sum of those two would be 30. So if there is twice as many woodwind as there is brass there should be 60 woodwind.<n>If there is 40 plus brass to get to 100 then there should be 6 woodwind players.<n><n>The sixth question asks what the boyfriend picked up. He does half, so 1/3 is 1/6 plus he picked half. So 2/3 is 2/6. It then goes on to ask him to pick up 133/226 pieces, which is 1/2, or half of what was already picked up by other people. That is the only answer with a ratio and I believe this is more than just addition or division.<n><n>The seventh question asks what the boy picked up. He picked up half, plus the boy picked up 4. He picked up double and then took

Choices:  A: carried by people B: guard house C: fly D: follow ultralight airplane E: group together<n><n>### Response:		C<n><n>### Inputs:Choose a 2-digit number. If the sum of the digits is 7 and if the digits are reversed in place, the sum is 6. If the digits are reversed, but the sum is only 5, how many 2-digit numbers are possible?<n><n>### Response<n><n>3<n><n>### Input<n>Choose a 6-digit number. Take the number you choose. If you add 1 to each digit and reorder the digits, it is an even number. If you add 7 to each digit and re-order the digits, it now becomes an odd number. How many different 6-digit numbers are possible in scenario 1?<n><n>### Choices<n><n>3<n><n>7<n><n>2<n><n>1<n><n>Answers: 73<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>If the number you pick is even, adding 1 to each digit leaves it even again. To make it odd, add 7 to make each digit odd. Then the digits will be in order from largest to smallest.<n><n>To pick an even number from 1000 to 9999 with only prime numbers, you would add a prime number to each digit to make it odd and reorder the digits making it even.  The result is an even-odd switch.<n><n>### Input and Explanation:<n>In this case, you subtract 1:<n><n>The question is asking for the largest number you can choose in this example. If you subtract 10 from the number you choose, then the total is still the same when you add 7 to the digits. If you subtract 99, 123, 246, 370, or 494, they cannot make it even again.<n><n>### Exercises:<n>Find the smallest prime number, and the largest prime number.<n><n>### Example:<n>Prime numbers are only divisible by themselves and 1.  If a number can have more than two decimal places, 343 is divisible by 3 and 43.<n><n>### Prime example:<n>The smallest prime number is 2 and the largest prime number is 789. 9 is the only composite number, every other number in the list is a prime number.<n><n>Find numbers with the least

Choices:  A: burned B: polished C: carved D: composted E: nailed<n><n>### Response:		C<n><n>### Discussion:<n><n>The answer is C, carved. A piece of wood reflecting would require light to pass through it and strike the object directly behind. This means it would need to be polished, carved or composted. If it was composted, then there must be a sufficient amount of light to get through all the decayed material. This means that there would be a lot of open areas in the wood meaning that much of the wood would be burned as opposed to decayed.<n><n>If the piece of wood is polished, then much of the light would only be reflected in the top of the wood and it would be difficult to see your reflection because you would not be directly behind it. The light would either only reflect from the surface or it would reflect at a right angle making it difficult to obtain a reflection. Polished wood does not absorb much light and is not very reflective.<n><n>Even a rough piece of wood that has no reflection in it will absorb more of the light than there needs to be for you to obtain a reflection for it to absorb all the light without reflecting any of it which would cause for you to not be able to see your own reflection in it.<n><n>### Input : How many people work in a building that has 6 floors and each floor has 36 windows?<n><n>### Answer: 18<n><n>### Input  : In each of 3 consecutive quarters, 10% more cars than in the last quarter were bought each year.

If the total number of strings among the ukuleles, guitars, and violins is 40 strings, how many violins does Francis' family have?<n>Answer: 2<n><n>Input: On each of 7 Mondays, it rained 1.5 centimeters. On each of 9 Tuesdays it rained 2.5 centimeters. How many more centimeters did it rain on Tuesdays than Mondays?<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:Where are seats most likely bleachers? Choices:  A: movies B: opera C: theater D: lecture hall E: hockey game<n><n>### Response:		<n>The answer to the multiple choice question is letter C as the most likely place for a bleacher would be in a theater.<n>A theater is typically used for a play or performance and it would have enough space to have seats all the way up to the ceiling, as well as an overhang to shelter the audience from heat and sun. The bleacher-style seating would not be as widely used in a movie theater as the seating would only be set in a way to accommodate the length of a movie. For opera performances, the seating is typically set in a ballet style, which would be very hard to mimic as bleachers. Lecture theaters are most likely smaller in size and would not be able to comfortably hold enough bleacher-style seats for the space. A hockey game would most likely not have bleacher-style sealing and would be set as a traditional style of seating.

Choices:  A: cupboard B: cabinet C: own home D: everything E: garbage dump<n><n>### Response:		A: cupboard<n><n>---<n><n>### Hints:<n>The numbers of objects in the first and second parts are all different (first part of 2, second part of 7).<n>The third and fourth parts are the same as the first and second parts.<n>The fifth and sixth parts are the same as in the second part (first part only 1, second part also 1).<n>The seventh part has a different number of objects than the second to the sixth parts.<n>---<n><n>## 💡 Hints:<n><n>### Instructions:<n>The first 4 numbers of the pattern are 1, 3, 6, 10.<n>The next two digits are the sum of the preceding two and 5.<n>The last number of the pattern is three more than the sum of the last two digits of the sequence.<n><n>### Example:<n>42<n>57<n>69<n>83<n>92<n>99<n><n>Notes: The first sum is 1+3+6=10, the next sum is 3+5 = 8, the last sum is 9+2 = 11. Hence the sum of the last 2 digits is 11.<n>The next sum as before is 8+5=13. Hence 10+13 gives us a total of sum of 23. 3 more than 20 would give us 26<n><n>---<n><n>---<n><n><n><n>---<n>---<n><n>## Task:<n>1.

You work at the zoo at Disney World. A group of scientists gave you the choice of 5 different mice (painted green, blue, pink, purple, and orange). They are identical in every way as far as you have been able to tell. The scientists asked you to choose one randomly. After you made the choice, the scientists told you that the mice aren't identical at all after all. They gave you two mice: purple or orange. You can't look any further into the mice. The scientists told you that you must choose a mouse because they can't keep the mice any longer and they must decide which one to donate to a nearby wildlife refuge or to a lab for further study.

Choices:  A: downtown area B: urban area C: new york city D: shopping mall E: military base<n><n>### Response:		(A)<n><n>### Explain Your Answer:<n>While there are many plazas and urban areas with a movie theater, a shopping mall is not necessarily the most likely location because there are other stores along with the movie theater. Military bases do not have stores or movie theaters and not many people live there, so the theater is unlikely to be located there. A military base would be on a military installation. There aren’t many military installations, and they typically aren’t near population centers. The theater is most likely to be located in a shopping mall, an urban area, or a downtown area.

Choices:  A: place of work B: office C: friend's house D: workplace E: deep thought<n><n>### Response:		Select Choice A or Choice E.<n><n>### Input and Output:Write a program that checks if all pairs of the numbers in the range are different from each other, except for one pair. Input: 3 pairs of numbers in the range 1 through 99. Output: True/False<n><n>### Solution:1. First check if any two of the numbers match. If they don't, we are done. If they do, the only possible case is if the pairs are consecutive.<n><n>2. Take the biggest and the smallest from the range. If the small number is bigger than the biggest, the problem is not solvable. So we can't go too far and start from the biggest number. If they match and start from the biggest, we can't add any number smaller than the next bigger number since then the pair will match. All that we can keep adding is numbers that haven't been used (not matching the previous). Keep checking if any two numbers match. If they do, we have an "unsolvable case", so we can break.<n>

First, let us say I have chosen the answer A. If the letter "C" is not in the code then I proceed to the next letter "B" and then to the next letter "D". However, since the letter "D" is in the code then I get the final result as false. We have to go back to the start and guess the letter "B". If at the first level of guessing we get the letter "B" then we can go to the same process with the letter "C".<n><n>The pseudocode is like this:<n><n>```javascript<n>function backTracking(answers, letters){<n>  let counter=0;<n>  for (a in letters) {            <n>    if (answers[counter]==a) {    <n>      if

C: Your kitchen and D: Its favorite food<n><n>### Answer:<n><n>While it is true that cats aren't known for their willingness to obey orders, this has little to do with whether or not they know their names.  They may, in fact, know their names more than you might think, but there are other reasons they don't follow your commands. It is said that cats don't really understand us, only the language of feelings. In order to prevent them from getting the impression that you need them to obey you, it is more important to let them know how their behavior is affecting you. If you are feeling a sense of anger, for example, it is probably better to avoid calling their names.<n>

You can probably guess the answer to that one. But what sort of difference does a sweater make in how warm you get — and how warm you keep? The simple fact is that sweater’s are significantly better at keeping a body warm than t-shirts are. But why then do they take a sweater twice as long to dry after getting wet? <n><n>It turns out that sweaters don’t get wet at all. Sweaters dry faster because sweaters don’t absorb any more liquid than they already contain; t-shirts get wet because they can’t. A t-shirt’s fibers make it possible for water to get in, and a cotton dries faster than something silky, because the silky thing can hold a lot more water. Sweater are made of cotton, and cotton is absorbent, but a sweater is still much smaller than the average t-shirt, and thus it doesn’t take on nearly as much water. As a sweater gets soaked, it gets heavier but can’t become heavier. T-shirts, on the other hand can get really heavy and then get light after they lose all the water they can hold onto. This is why it feels to you as though sweaters take a long time to dry, even if they haven’t absorbed much water at all.<n><n><b>Your Response</b><p></p><p><input id="box" class="typeahead" type="text"></p><n><img src ="assets/img/typeahead.gif" id="ajaxloader" style="display:none;">Loading...<input id="submit" data-task="0fbe7bff-d1e5-49bb-a5cc-c7669365a306" value="Submit" type="submit"><img

Choices A: Finger Nails B: Garden C: Corner D: Computer E: Closet<n><n>### Instraction:Animal-lover Sally has three bird feeders: a blackbird feeder, a cardinal feeder, and a dove feeder. Sally fills her feeders each morning before dawn, and then takes them outside to hang them from their hooks in the garden. In the evening, she takes each feeder inside to wash it and refill it with seeds. Here's the problem: When a bird flies into one of her feeders and spills or drops seeds, she replaces the entire feeder instead of just replacing any seeds missed. Suppose the cardinal feeder was filled with 24 morsels of seed. That day, a cardinal got one morsel of seed and a blackbird got 11 morsels. When Sally brought the feeders back inside, they were each half full of seeds. When she emptied the cardinal feeder she replaced it with the new cardinal feeder because it was still half full of seeds and left the empty one out to dry from this day's mess. Then she filled the dove feeder up with the remaining nine seeds it had left, and replaced it, even though it is still half full of sevens seeds left over from one previous day's fill. But now there were four different feeders needing to be filled, each half full of seede. She decided to use the one that was newest and refilled the cardinal feeder. How many seeds are in each feeder?<n>Answer: 8<n><n>### Instinct:Answer the following multiplechoice question.<n><n>## Instruction:Answer the question by writing a response that appropriately fills in the blanks.<n><n>### You may need to write out a partial answer; the solution is correct if it is accurate.<n><n>Question: If I had three pairs of shoes and didn't wear any of them for a day, how many shoes would I have?<n><n>### Insturctions: Answer the question by writing a short response that appropriatly fills in the blanks..<n>

How could the “Trim Tab” affect the “Crucial Focus”?<n><n>### Crucial Focus<n><n>The crucial focus (not to be confused with a crucial moment) is a goal or point in time where an action must be taken. The crucial focus is determined by the time it will take to solve a problem (or prevent an issue). Therefore, the crucial focus is the point where we must focus our time and attention to solve a problem or prevent an issue. The crucial focus might help you determine what your next task will be if it prevents further problems from occurring.<n><n>For example, if you have a leaky roof and can’t afford to fix it, you cannot buy new tires for the car. If you decide, however, to put off fixing the roof and do not get it fixed, your car then needs new tires. The crucial focus helps you eliminate any unimportant details. This ensures you do not unnecessarily spend time doing things that are not helping to fix or prevent the problem. In this example, fixing the roof and your car’s tires became more important once they were dependent on each other.<n><n>The crucial few have the most impact on or cause the greatest amount of stress. Stressful problems are the result of the crucial few, not the trivial many. <n><n>The key to solving any problem is to focus on the crucial few. These are the 20% of the action steps that will produce 80% of the results. Identifying the crucial few and focusing on them increases your efficiency and reduces your wasted effort.<n><n>### Trimtab<n><n>In general, trim tabs serve as an additional rudder on boats. They help to steer the boat in a certain direction, making turns easier. They typically work when a boat’s rudder cannot handle a heavy current. In business, a trim tab refers to a small change that can have a large and significant impact on a business’ sales.<n><n>### Other<n><n>### Insurance sales

It is 1/4 filled. It holds 20 gifts more than Tuesday, but still holds the same amount of gifts as Monday. How many gifts does it hold on Monday?<n>Output: <n>```<n>Input:The bag is a bag containing a number of gifts. The bag holds a number of gifts on monday and that same number of gifts on tuesday. The bag holds a total of 72 gifts on monday, tuesday, wednesday, and so of it. The bag is 1/4 full on monday and on every day there after.<n>Output:The bag holds 48 gifts on Monday. The bag gains 20 gifts every day and gets half full by tuesday. If the bag holds 48 on monday then it must also hold 20 on tuesday. Then the bag must hold 72 and be half full. This means that the bag holds 72 and the bag has to get a quarter full.<n>```<n>### Response: <n><n>```<n>On each day the gift are added from Tuesday.  On Tuesday the bag is filled and on Monday the bag still holds a quarter the gifts.  It cannot hold more than 72 gifts because 1/4 the gifts are given away everyday and each day the same amount are added from Tues.<n><n>So in order to give 48 to everyone over 4 months the bag has to hold 48. <n>So each day the gifts are divided by 4. On Tuesday the gifts are 48 and on Monday a quarter the gifts are missing. <n><n><n>Output: <n>There are 48 gifts held on monday.

(This is not the group's time.)  If a team member takes more than two seconds longer to complete the swim, the member must wait 40 seconds before their next try, unless no one else has attempted the swim within 60 seconds of completing their time.  What is the minimum number of team members?<n><n>### Demosration:<n>Step One: Group members are 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 Seconds.<n><n>Step Two: Total time is calculated: 23 + 7 + 9 + 17 + 12 = 65. Next, the individual time is calculated by dividing the total time in half: (65 +.5)/2 = 65 + 27/2 = 65+ 13.5 = 78.5. So the total time for the group is 78.5 seconds.<n><n>Step Three: Because the first teammate took two extra seconds, the group only has 70.5 seconds to swim. <n><n>Step Four: Because no one else has taken a turn in the six seconds following the first swim that took 7 seconds, all members must wait 54 seconds before swimming again.<n><n>### Response<n><n>Step Three: The minimum number of members is four if each member takes at least 40 seconds to swim.<n>

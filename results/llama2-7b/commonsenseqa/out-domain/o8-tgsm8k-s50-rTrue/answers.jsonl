Bush takes up 30/40 +30/45 +30/3 = <<30/40+30/45+30/3=(9/12)>> (9/12) Bush, because of the area the carving takes on each individual block, and Einstein takes up 10/40 +40/45 = <<10/40+10/45=(0.25/3)>> (0.25/23 5/16) Einstein, because of how it is carved.\nBill + Bush + Einstein = Bill + Bush + (Bill + Bush - Bill) = Bill + Bush + Einstein, because Einstein was subtracted from (Bill + Bush)  Finally, we find Bill + Bush + Einsteins percentage of area, like so:  Bill + Bush + Einstien/3  which equals Bill + Bush + (0.25 +0.25 - 0.165) = Bill + Bush (0.25)(1/2) + Einstein (0.165/23 2/3) = Bill + Bush+ Einstein  So, the final choice is A: Bill+Bush+Einstein", "answer": "C: disneyland"}

This repeat for 5 times.\nOutput: For the first round, he buys 3 oranes for $1, so $1/(1+3) = $<<1/(1+3)=183/360>>183/340 so $1.83 = <<1.83=1.83>>1.83\nFor the second round, the man sells these for $1 and buys 3 orangnes for $1, or $1*1 = $1>>1\nSo he gets back $1.83 + $1 = $<<1.83+1=1.84>>1.84 from the selling prices.\nFor the next three rounds, he buys 2 oranges for $1 and sells 3 for the same $1.\nAt the fifth round, he sells 3 apples for $1. This means that the answer is $1.84 + (1+2*1) + (1+3*1) + (3+1*1) + 3*1 = <<1.84+1*2+3*2+5+3*1=18.45>>18.45\n\nInput: $75 was distributed between three people.

A pen checked out to another person is $1.50 if not returned within 12 months. How much in fines does a student owe if they have one late library book and they lose a pen for having their library book checked out too late?\nOutput: To calculate the math for fines, the first step is to create a function that converts months to dollars: months(0.25 * 12) = 30 days per month, thus 4 weeks is.25*4 = <<0.25*4=1>>1 months; to convert from months to dollars, just multiply the number of months you have by the amount to convert.\nTo calculate the fine for late books, do the same math, but you need to use the library hours (365-7) = <<365-7=358>>358 per year.  The amount of late fees due = $1.50 * <<days(4)>>40 days.  This can be re-written as $<<1.50*40>>$40\nTo calculate the amount of late fees for lost books, you simply multiply this number by the number of books checked out.  (<<1.50 * 40>>1.50 *40)*<<books(1)>>1.  Which is $<<1.5*40*1>>40\nThe student owes the combined fine in dollars of $600 (to check out one book for 4 weeks = <<1*4*1>>14 4 weeks late, thus $1 * <<1*4*40>>$1 * 40 dollars). If you need to check out 10 pens for a year, then there are $<<600*1>>600 total dollars.\nSo the final answers is 600\n\nInput : Find the volume of a box that has the dimensions 16, 9, and 7.\nOutput: Multiply 16, 22 and 9 to get the actual volume.\nThe answer you come up with is 1832.\n\nInput:", "answer": "E: school"}

Each word has $9$ nine letters in it, except for the last word.  The last word is only $3$ three letters long.  How many sentences fit on a $1$ one dollar bill?\nOutput: Let's start with the sentences. Each sentence has 5 words, so each line has $7 \\cdot 1 / 5 =<<7/5=1.4>>1.4 sentences\nThe last word which is only 3 letters long is the exception to this rule. So we will change this value to something different but then we can work this in easily. Let's say it was 4 letters. So there will be $1.4 \\cdot 1 /0.4$  sentences less than $1.4$. How many sentences were left? $6$. So 7 lines will make $1.4 \\times 6 = <<1.4\\times 6=8.4>>8.4 sentences left after the exceptions are accounted for. So 8.4 / 7 = 1.1 sentences per line left. Finally, we could say 8.4 /7 +7 = 1.09 sentences.\nIf we multiply this by $5$ we get $1.09 * 5 = <<1.09*5=5.45>>5.45 sentences remaining. After the cuts, $7$ / $5.45 = <<7/5.45=1.3$$$1.3 $$$$1.3$$$ will be left.\nSo the answer should be $C$\n\nInput: A school holds an in-service training every year to prepare school safety for the next year.

How can you guess what number your friend will say?\nOutput: Your friend gives you clues and you need to find if the number is between 1-9, which is the range. He gives you a multiple. If the number is 4, then he says, \"The opposite of the number I just picked is a multiple of 5.\". Then, you can choose between 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, because all numbers are a multiple of 5 except for 5.

Then your friend says, \"I picked a number with many 0's in it.\" Then, you can choose one that ends in a 0, which is 3 and 9 because only they end in 0 because 0 is the number next to 9. So you know you need to exclude 1-9, so you can eliminate 3 and 9 from the choices. The remaining are 2,4,5,7, and 8. If the number is a multiple of 4, then he will tell you that the number he picked has only 1 digit in it. The remaining options are 2,5,7,8. If the number he picks is a multiple of 2, then he says that the number has a 1,3,5 or 7 in it. Then you eliminate 2 from the choices. The next statement is that the number your friend chose is a multiple of 7. Now, he gives another multiple, which is 9. So, then all the numbers that your friend picked before are already crossed out. You are left with three numbers which are 5,7, or 9. He says that the number he chose has many numbers in it.

{"text": "This question is based on an anecdote that was passed down by multiple generations in the area to be solved.\nAccording to this story, people who live in town stand in the city on a street, but on a main road they only stand at the intersection of a road with a fork in the road.\nThe fork is where the road splits in opposite directions but eventually merge back into one road again.\nIn this situation, people will stand at the traffic signal when there's a fork in the road to get there first before the traffic light turns green and there's a short span of opportunity to cross all the lanes before the rest of the traffic arrives.\nSo the car coming from the right is the only one that needs to pay attention and make an effort to speed up because they will arrive later than all the cars that are coming from the left.\nThey will be stuck in all the traffic and get stranded at the red light when none of the traffic is moving because it's after 6 pm and all other cars are trying to reach their destination as soon as possible.\nAfter all, those cars are doing the same thing: they just want to go home.\nSo these cars are willing to wait and make a slow progress on the intersection to reach their destination.\nWhereas, people who are living in city are going to the store, so they need to get there first in order to get the best choice of fresh groceries.\nThus, they won't mind to wait longer even though it's going to get them to the destination later than those cars.\nPeople who live in town don't want to waste their time, so we conclude that people who stand at a fork in the road would be more likely to live in town. \nWhereas, people in the city care more about the location of the grocery store than anything else because they are used to stay there.\n\nInput: What is 50% of 180% of 31?\nOutput: Start with 50% of $180\\div 100%=(180)\\div$\\frac{180}{100}=45\n$50\\%(180)\\div\\frac{100}{180}=2\\frac{5}{16}$\n$180\\div\\frac{180\\times5", "answer": "C: street corner"}

Include the cost of returning the car on Monday morning.\nOutput: The last input is  If I were in this situation, I would do the following. First, I would try to find a way to drive my friend\u2019s car for a few hours.\nIf you could take a car for 2 hours for $12, then I would do that. So the noncar owner is covering $12/3 = <<12/3=4>>4 of the cost.\nNow I can still do the math of carpooling with my carpool car to the beach. The car costs $11 per hour, and I would take my friend\u2019s car to the beach. But I would need to take another car. The next option would be to return the car since no one would want to do that at night. But the car costs $15 if returned in under an hour. So my next option would be to rent a car for the weekend. It is $115 to rent the car, so that would leave me $26 to go for 1 hour. So the correct answer is 26.\n\nInput: In a family of 5, each child contributed an equal share to buying a toy car.

For example, we have (x, (p_x), (X_m, x_m, X)) = (no, (yes, 0.4), (yes, 07, no))\nWe can ignore (p_x), because we use x value only once and can't determine it in advance then we use (y_m, m, x) which we can determine it by (x = y, y = x) and the question will still be the same.

Other possible meanings include \"sit on,\" as in a cat who has chosen to spend time on top of a chair, sleeping.\nA cat would obviously never do that inside a family room, because there are always adults or children hanging out at family rooms.  In a den, a cat would be \"in\" or \"inside,\" which is different from \"sitting on.\"\nInside a house, a cat is safe from predators, which is the purpose of a den; that's why a den is not a safe place for a cat.\nThe term \"den\" does not include the floor, which is a hard surface.

Secondly subtract by subtracting by adding. Since there is a minus in the last step and you need a minus to take the final -2  so minus -2=2 now take 42 you take away or minus it and you will get: <42-1=41>.  41-3=38, so there is a difference of 38 shoe sizes between the two shoes.\nso the final answer will be an odd number which is 39\n\nInput: Daisy has $120 and wants to save up money for a toy that costs $25.

If they understand each other, they can do what? Choices:  A: pay bills B: swap bodies C: learn from each other D: believe in god E: talk to each other<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is C.<n><n>#### Answer: I used the logic tree for this task.The first part says "If people listen to other people they can understand each other".<n><n>My tree had the branch "IF people listen to them then they can understand them", and a branch with "AND they can do what?". On the left side of the AND, I saw that I needed to draw some different branches to figure out which choice was incorrect. I first drew another branch with "B". The IF condition on this branch states that they can understand each other, meaning that they can "learn from each other", this is true! I then made another IF and put "B", meaning that people can "learn from other people" meaning they can "believe in god". This is false, so I deleted this branch.  The next thing I tried was to put "D", meaning they can "belive in each other" and then this is true, since they can "believe". Thus, they would also "learn from each other" meaning that they can "believe with each other".  So, I deleted this branch also. Finally, there was left the option "E", which I have not previously tried. When people listen to each other, then they can understand each other and have access to learn from each other. If they learn from each other, they would be able to talk to each other (which also meant that they would be able to understand each other again). So, the answer is "A, B, C, D, and E".<n><n>When I started drawing the first solution, I started drawing a tree and I kept running out of space for all the things I needed to draw.  I then decided to split a different solution in two solutions so I would be able to keep the solution organized and not having to draw it in just one branch. This took me three tries before I figured out that it was not possible, since the instructions specifically stated that we had to draw that in "just one tree".<n><n>### Explanation to the above solution:<n><n>I used the logic tree for my explanation.<n><n>A: I would be able to listen better if I would use my ears, like to hear from other people.<n><n>AND: If I would listen to other people, I can understand them, thus I can use my ears.<n><n>B: If I use my ears, then I will be able to hear people better.<n>

What is the price of 1 juice pack, 2 gummy bears, and 8 gummy candies? Choices: A: $3.90 B: $7.40 C: $19.40<n><n>### Response : The answer is A because in the problem statement says the price of a pack juice is $1,80. Then the answer comes to $3,90 because $1,80- $3,50 = $1,10 and ($1,10- $0.30) = $0.80 then $4,$80 - $2,80 = $1,00 and that comes to $1,00- $2,50 = $750 and $750-$2.80 = $747.20<n><n>### Input  : If 8 times as many of one type of bird as there are of another type of bird live in a certain park, then there are 160 of the 1st type of birds and 20 of the 2nd type.

The index was created to reflect the rate of inflation and a more stable alternative to the other indexes that were in use at the time. The CPI is published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, part of the U.S. Dept. of Labor. It is usually considered to measure the changes in prices of goods and services that American families buy for consumption.<n><n>The CPI is also widely used as a deficit reduction device and in the adjustment of the social security income for benefits and tax purposes. The calculation formula includes different items which can affect the actual value. For example, housing inflation is not measured by the CPI, but by the Owner’s Equivalent Rent and is therefore omitted. Other commodities, such as food and beverage prices, are included in the consumer expenditure surveys but are excluded to avoid distorting the calculation in favor of consumers.<n><n>The CCI’s 1967 initial value was recorded as 33, and the yearly percentage change between 1982 and 2014 was computed as 3.4%.<n><n>If the yearly percentage change from 1982 to 2014 is 3.4%, how much will $1 cost in 2085?<n><n>### The answers to the above problem can be found in the following page:<n>[Answer](https://www.stackoverflow.com/questions/98744548?answertab=oldest#tab-top)<n>1.

An emergency room may seem like an obvious choice in this scenario, but an emergency room is not a place anyone would go just to obtain a contraceptive; there is no reason they can't just buy or use a spare without going through the whole process. Additionally, drawer is not technically a medical option, and medicine cabinet is not the same as a health center. The correct answer choice should be "E" - the "vagina".<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n><n>## Explanation:<n><n>

Choices:  A: contagious B: wrong C: last forever D: painful E: blind<n><n>### Response:		<n>I chose that love is D: painful. It's said that love is blind, but I love my dog, she can't see, is deaf and blind. It is unfortunate, but that didn't change my love for her. I knew she can't see so I started to use sign language to teach her words or actions. In the long run she was better than most guide dogs I know. She sleeps with her head on my lap, she doesn't like to be woke up without a good reason like if someone came in the house.<n>But I also know that she loves me more than some people I know. I do believe that true love is being blind and not knowing it. I also think true love is painful and hurtful. But you can't explain the feelings and emotions true love brings out of you. I once did love someone, I had to break it off. The pain was not pleasant, but it was a good experience for me because I'm better now. It made me realize how I can't allow anyone to manipulate me or be in control, but I did learn to control my fear, anxiety, hurt and sadness. Love is contagious, but the pain is not when you no longer love the person anymore. Even though I lost this one love, I know I'm stronger for it.<n>### Input:You can tell where a person is from by the clothes they wear, what color their shirt is, it's their style, and the car they drive. But if you were to ask someone if they are from California, Texas, Kansas, Alabama, North Carolina, or Georgia where would you know they were from?. In the long run this person was born and raised from each state. He grew up in every state he mentions. In the long run he is the state, and he didn't lie cause it was the truth.<n><n>### Response<n>This is a great thing and shows that one can become anything they want to be. To believe they can become one thing or another helps them reach their full potential. I believe if someone doesn't believe they can achieve anything, then they are right in a way, but they are also wrong in a way. It is believed that without a strong will, one can do nothing. The will does carry a lot of weight, but this same person can still rise above all the odds against them. If

I think it is also good to make sure the answer options are not so confusing that it would not be clear to the general student at the lower end of the SIFT range.

Choices:  A: very heavy B: video game C: news article D: card game E: lead pencil<n><n>### Response:		Answer "E". The leading pencil is a thin lead pencil and leads, and so it is written, that it is not very heavy, nor is it video game, news article, or card games. So, pencil is the correct answer.<n><n>### Input<n>How many people were not there, if 199 people were at the picnic, and 58 children were present?<n><n>### Response<n>Answer "69". 199-58 is 141. 141-69 gives you 72. 72/2=36. 72-36 are 38, and 38/3 are 13. Finally, 35-13 is giving you 22. 22/3 are 7, and 7+6 is 13. 13+2 is 15. 15 divided by 2 is 7. 7 times 3 is 21. 21 is an integer.<n><n>### How many people are there in 55, if 55 is an answer, and 19 is a question?<n><n>### Demostration:Answer "53". Because each square of 9 has double the space, there are two units of 5 and one unit of 4 in a unit of 9 squares. Also, each unit of 5 has one unit of 4 on top, two units of 3 on two sides, and one unit of 5 on the bottom. This means we have 6 squares of 3 with 4 squares on top, 5 squares of 3 on two ends, and one square of 4 in the middle. Then, all these units together give us 6 units of 3 and 1 unit of 9, showing that the answer is actually 53.<n><n><n>

Choices:  A: maine B: boston C: beach town D: coastal cities E: ocean<n><n>### Response:		Where would you find a sea food restaurant on East coast?<n><n>### Input<n>When I was in the US, I went to 3 restaurants and ate a total of 12 cheeseburgers. If each restaurant served 4 people cheeseburgers, how many times did I go to each restaurant?<n><n>### Output<n>You went to each restaurant only once.<n><n>### Explanation<n><n>The first step in doing arithmetic is to gather up all the numbers and group them. In this case they are 3, 4, 4. This process is often called combining like terms. A cheeseburger was 1 piece of candy. So the rule is for each time I go into a restaurant, i eat 1 cheeseburger.<n><n>Now I can do some basic arithmetic. I will start by multiplying 3 by 3 and get 9. The next step is 4×4=16 and finally I have 4×4= 16 cheeseburgers per person. The numbers are combining and not added or multiplied.<n><n>### Input#2<n><n>This is a question that my friend asked me while we were walking in the park. He said that 50 people visited a bakery for one day where they had 20 people lined up to get breads and 30 people in line to get pastries. Each day the bakery has 45 minutes to sell from 9:00 AM to 7:30 PM. He needed to find out how many 1-minute intervals were required for each group. The total duration is 50 minutes. Now, 1 unit is bread and 3 units is pastry.<n><n>From 10:00 AM to the end of the day, 5 groups of 50 people come to the bakery.<n>At 10:07 AM, 2 groups of 20 people queued for bread and 3 groups of 30 people queued for pastry.<n><n>In 8 minutes, the 20 people waiting in line for bread all got it at 10:15 AM when the queue for bread is cleared. <n>At this point, 3 and a half group of 30 people are waiting in line for pastries.<n>In another 2  minutes,

While each district is not large, each district is not large and each member is elected by fewer voters and representatives each represent fewer people than other countries.<n><n>### Support:One of the first requirements of democracy is the equality of all citizens. According to this requirement, while the U.S. can be considered as a federal republic, in which one person has as much power as any other person. All citizens have equal power and political rights. In other countries, like Germany, there are different states, which means that different states have different powers.<n><n>### Second, the power should be in the hands of the people, who elect their leaders. This requirement will not be met in the United States. Since only people over the age of 18 can vote, there a large numbers of people who cannot even vote, so only a small number can affect policies.<n><n>### Lastly, the requirement that leaders only have one term is not fulfilled in the United States. There are many instances where leaders have had to serve for a second term, due to the fact that the current president was not a strong leader and the election he did win would have been lost.<n><n>### Conclusion:Even though the United States is a good model of democracy, it does not satisfy every requirement. In order to be considered a truly democratic state, every one of these core requirements must be met.<n><n>### Writing a response:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n><n>## Demonstration:Input: Someone lacking immortilty will one day die.<n>Input: A bumblebee has four fluffy legs and four sharp stingers.<n>Input: When you are 40 years old,

How much did she pay for the house?<n><n>### Demostration:<n>First, we are going to solve for ‘S’. We know that,<n>S = 54,001 – S<n>So (S = 54001-S)/54001<n>Or S = 53956/54001.<n>Then, we are going to subtract (1/54000) from both sides of the equation. Or we can multiply both sides by 54000.<n>(54001/54066)/54000–1/54044=54000x54000<n>So, (54001*54000)/54044 - 1 = 54044,007<n>S = 5396/5404<n><n>###Input: Mr. Davis sells the same car for 35% more than he paid for it.

Choices:  A: idaho B: shopping mall C: big city D: in town E: new york<n><n>### Response:		A. Idaho<n><n>### Demostration:<n><n>If you go to new york city, the number of possible customers there could be anywhere from 1 to infinity. However, in idaho, the number of people that you could market your store to is finite. Therefore, you can increase only so much the number of actual customers you have. Conversely, the more people there are in a large market or mall, the more possible customers you will have. It is also likely that people working in the mall or the area will take notice of your store. Therefore, you have the potential to increase the size of your customer base.<n><n>By contrast, there are many possible outcomes if you build the store in a new york city. However, you cannot make your market to be larger than in new york. In a smaller town, many fewer people pass through, allowing for a smaller number of potential customers. In the case of a shopping mall, you are restricted to a smaller amount of people from the city, so this option would be best for a much smaller business.<n><n>In this situation, the mall could be good for a larger business. However, if you have a smaller business, you will make more profit by putting in new location.<n><n>### Input A.<n><n>### Response B.<n><n>If you want to maximize profits, you want to increase your marginal revenue as much as possible without increasing your marginal cost.<n><n>To do this, find the least profitable product first. For a good idea of how to do this, find the price on your products that are the least profitable (the price that gives the least revenue minus your costs).<n><n>To increase the amount of money you make, you can look at your most profitable products, but remember that you cannot increase indefinitely, and you have to work in the marginal cost/revenue of your products.<n><n>### 5.0 stars - <n>

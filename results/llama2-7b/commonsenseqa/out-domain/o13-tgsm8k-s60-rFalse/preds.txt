She wants to include both meat and vegetarian options as part of the meal. If she would like for everyone to be able to have choices, which of the following options works out to be the best bang for her buck? Note: Choices A,B,C,D each has two options, so multiply the number of food options per person by the number of people eating in order to count the options correctly. The answers only include food groups in which it is possible to eat 2 different options. Choices other than one of the options above are considered invalid or else they will have more than 2 different foods (even if a vegetarian will not consume them all). You cannot count food in the group as more than it is (i.e. you cannot choose to give options on a food that would allow a person to eat the same food twice or you will not be able to count properly). For example, if Jane gives 2 kinds of pasta (which can be eaten by vegetarians and meat eaters), Jane will not be able to provide a good mix of options unless she gives both 2 different kinds of vegetarian pasta as well as 2 different kinds of meat pasta.<n><n>Output: D<n><n>Input: 10 of the members of a club chose their favorite vegetable to have at a cookout.

She wants to show them how to do it correctly without making a mistake. The teacher said to make the drawing so the 1 star would not be mistaken for anything else, and that you should always be able to tell what it is. She said the best way to do this is to draw it in the form of a "T" with some lines on it.<n>Output: The one star should be drawn in the form of an "i", with no crossbars of the stem of the "i". Draw a "T" with a small gap, but make it resemble a long "i" with no crossbars. <n><n>## Notes:<n>*I used the "math formula" search function to see what formula i needed to solve this. I did not do trial-error because of how it works and the fact that this type of logic was a little confusing, so I chose to use this method.<n>*I also used the equation solver function on my calculator, and I got the same or almost the same answer than I got on here<n>*I also used online calculators and google to solve for myself.<n><n>

Use Pete's total distance as the total distance he traveled.<n><n>- 5 blocks from house to bus garage and<n>- 20 blocks bus garage to post office<n><n>From there, the total distance traveled is just 25, making the answer 50 <n><n>We now need to find out the combination of the three chairs:<n>- green chairs are 10<n>- blue chairs are 20<n>- white chairs are 8 <n><n>If we use the three statements from the given,<n>we can find out the answer <n><n>- Alannah = 1/5 * (1 + 20) = 18 <n>- Beatrix = 1/3 * (1 + 10) = 6 <n>- Queen = 2/5 * (30) = 60 <n><n>So from there, the answer is 140 <n><n>- Sam = 1/2 * 6 = 3<n>- All Sam's birds have 6 berries each<n><n>So 30 berries altogether. <n><n>- $0.50 * (1 + 4 + 9 ) = 50 <n>- Voltaire = $0.55 * 22 = $11.10<n>- Leila = $0.50*14=7 <n>After subtracting by one, he's left with $9. Then, we add back the money he borrowed <n><n>- $10 + $14 = $24 <n><n>So he's left with 9, which is our correct answer. And 7 was incorrect <n><n>- The 50 is his initial balance and then he should subtract

You, being a professional web designer, want to create an optimized banner advertising campaign for a new online clothing store. For the campaign to be successful, you must choose an optimal dimension of the banner. When deciding how to approach your task, you noticed the following:<n><n>Input: Your website is currently displaying advertisements in 3 banner slots, with 3 separate banners. Your website receives 300 unique visitors every day and 600 visitors overall per day. These banners contain graphics and text, and all of them were clicked on once. You think that if only one banner was displayed, the advertising revenue would be twice as much. But, on the other hand, twice as many people see only one of the advertisements, thus increasing adoption of the product by almost half and decreasing revenue. This may not seem good for the company, but it is essential for the users of the website, who may want to take advantage of the promotions featured on the ads they see. You decide to calculate a formula: for how many banners is your website?<n>Output: 4.0<n><n>Input: You have an online shoe shop and have decided to start advertising on an internet portal. Your website is currently displaying ads in three separate banners and receives 1,600 unique visitors every hour. These ads contain only text and pictures and have been clicked on 800 times so far. You think if only one ad is displayed, the adoption of the product will be half. With only one ad visible, the revenue will be twice as much and half the people who visit the website will see an advertisement they are likely to purchase or find useful. By only showing one ad, you can increase the awareness of the product and the number of people who want to buy it. You decide to calculate the formula: how many banners are on your website?<n>Output<n><n>---------------------------------------------------<n>### Instruction<n>Answer the

We have 14 cards in the entire problem so 1 cards of each type.<n>Let's assume the min and max are '1'. The cards he has are the number of card. We should find out the max to subtract.<n>We can say 150-40=110. So the range is (110,110). Now find the cards he has and compare with the range.<n>We can say all the answer lies in between 210 to 230.

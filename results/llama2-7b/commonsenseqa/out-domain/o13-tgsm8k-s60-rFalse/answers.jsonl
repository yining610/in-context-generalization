If Ann is the town next door, then Anne has a 25% chance that her car is in Ann Arbor. What is the probability that her car is unlocked?\nOutput:\n\n### Solutions\n\nSolution 1:\n\nLet us define a new variable `m` as equal to 9 (Number of cards from janet).\n\nLet us also define a new variable `b` equal to the number of cards from brenda (45 cards).\n\nNow, we can use the following equation -\n\n$10 \\times m - 9 \\times b$\n\n=> $-\\frac{9}{46} \\times b - \\frac{9}{45}$ = -0.02\n\nSince \\(-\\frac{9}{211}\\) < 0 hence, \\(30 \\times \\frac{9}{20} < 2 \\times \\frac{22}{20} \\times \\frac{1}{5}\\)\n\n$\\therefore$ Brenda has 24 cards which also means that brenda is 20 short of 250.\n\nJanet has 4 short of 42\n\nHence, janet has 9 more than brenda\n\nSolution 2:\n\nWe can easily observe that 50 = 5+5+5+5\n\nTherefore, we will use +5 as a general number to find the result.\n\nThe final answer can be reached using the following formula -\n$(5 \\times 4) + 20 = 22$\n\nSolution 3:\n\nLet us first define the new variable as per the question:\n$a$= number of thermoses containing berries\n\n$b$ = Number of thermoses containing green berries\n\n$c$ = Number of thermouses containing white berries\n\nNow, we will add first two equations as 8 thermoses containing berries, 6 thermoses containing berries and 13 less thermoses containing berries gives us the final expression as - 6+6+5+4 = 19 \n\nNow, if we apply the third", "answer": "D: lap"}

If she would like for everyone to be able to have choices, which of the following options works out to be the best bang for her buck? Note: Choices A,B,C,D each has two options, so multiply the number of food options per person by the number of people eating in order to count the options correctly. The answers only include food groups in which it is possible to eat 2 different options. Choices other than one of the options above are considered invalid or else they will have more than 2 different foods (even if a vegetarian will not consume them all). You cannot count food in the group as more than it is (i.e. you cannot choose to give options on a food that would allow a person to eat the same food twice or you will not be able to count properly). For example, if Jane gives 2 kinds of pasta (which can be eaten by vegetarians and meat eaters), Jane will not be able to provide a good mix of options unless she gives both 2 different kinds of vegetarian pasta as well as 2 different kinds of meat pasta.\n\nOutput: D\n\nInput: 10 of the members of a club chose their favorite vegetable to have at a cookout.

{"text": "B\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n### Instruction:Answer the multiple choice question.\nInput: One of the most important aspects of a successful online advertising campaign is the banner advertising. A standard banner is 468 pixels wide. Banner advertising allows for text or graphics and the ads are placed anywhere on the page of a website. You, being a professional web designer, want to create an optimized banner advertising campaign for a new online clothing store. For the campaign to be successful, you must choose an optimal dimension of the banner. When deciding how to approach your task, you noticed the following:\n\nInput: Your website is currently displaying advertisements in 3 banner slots, with 3 separate banners. Your website receives 300 unique visitors every day and 600 visitors overall per day. These banners contain graphics and text, and all of them were clicked on once. You think that if only one banner was displayed, the advertising revenue would be twice as much. But, on the other hand, twice as many people see only one of the advertisements, thus increasing adoption of the product by almost half and decreasing revenue. This may not seem good for the company, but it is essential for the users of the website, who may want to take advantage of the promotions featured on the ads they see. You decide to calculate a formula: for how many banners is your website?\nOutput: 4.0\n\nInput: You have an online shoe shop and have decided to start advertising on an internet portal. Your website is currently displaying ads in three separate banners and receives 1,600 unique visitors every hour. These ads contain only text and pictures and have been clicked on 800 times so far. You think if only one ad is displayed, the adoption of the product will be half. With only one ad visible, the revenue will be twice as much and half the people who visit the website will see an advertisement they are likely to purchase or find useful. By only showing one ad, you can increase the awareness of the product and the number of people who want to buy it. You decide to calculate the formula: how many banners are on your website?\nOutput\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n### Instruction\nAnswer the", "answer": "B: heretical"}

{"text": "The correct answer is C.\n\n#### Answer: I used the logic tree for this task.The first part says \"If people listen to other people they can understand each other\".\n\nMy tree had the branch \"IF people listen to them then they can understand them\", and a branch with \"AND they can do what?\". On the left side of the AND, I saw that I needed to draw some different branches to figure out which choice was incorrect. I first drew another branch with \"B\". The IF condition on this branch states that they can understand each other, meaning that they can \"learn from each other\", this is true! I then made another IF and put \"B\", meaning that people can \"learn from other people\" meaning they can \"believe in god\". This is false, so I deleted this branch.  The next thing I tried was to put \"D\", meaning they can \"belive in each other\" and then this is true, since they can \"believe\". Thus, they would also \"learn from each other\" meaning that they can \"believe with each other\".  So, I deleted this branch also. Finally, there was left the option \"E\", which I have not previously tried. When people listen to each other, then they can understand each other and have access to learn from each other. If they learn from each other, they would be able to talk to each other (which also meant that they would be able to understand each other again). So, the answer is \"A, B, C, D, and E\".\n\nWhen I started drawing the first solution, I started drawing a tree and I kept running out of space for all the things I needed to draw.  I then decided to split a different solution in two solutions so I would be able to keep the solution organized and not having to draw it in just one branch. This took me three tries before I figured out that it was not possible, since the instructions specifically stated that we had to draw that in \"just one tree\".\n\n### Explanation to the above solution:\n\nI used the logic tree for my explanation.\n\nA: I would be able to listen better if I would use my ears, like to hear from other people.\n\nAND: If I would listen to other people, I can understand them, thus I can use my ears.\n\nB: If I use my ears, then I will be able to hear people better.", "answer": "C: learn from each other"}

What is the price of 1 juice pack, 2 gummy bears, and 8 gummy candies? Choices: A: $3.90 B: $7.40 C: $19.40\n\n### Response : The answer is A because in the problem statement says the price of a pack juice is $1,80.

Write a response to it.\n\n### Task:\n\n### Input:(Given below: This is Part III of III)<a id=\"example-input-1\"></a>\n\nIn 1968, the U.S. Department of Commerce created the Consumer Price Index (CPI) that measures the inflation rate. The index was created to reflect the rate of inflation and a more stable alternative to the other indexes that were in use at the time. The CPI is published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, part of the U.S. Dept. of Labor. It is usually considered to measure the changes in prices of goods and services that American families buy for consumption.\n\nThe CPI is also widely used as a deficit reduction device and in the adjustment of the social security income for benefits and tax purposes. The calculation formula includes different items which can affect the actual value. For example, housing inflation is not measured by the CPI, but by the Owner\u2019s Equivalent Rent and is therefore omitted. Other commodities, such as food and beverage prices, are included in the consumer expenditure surveys but are excluded to avoid distorting the calculation in favor of consumers.\n\nThe CCI\u2019s 1967 initial value was recorded as 33, and the yearly percentage change between 1982 and 2014 was computed as 3.4%.\n\nIf the yearly percentage change from 1982 to 2014 is 3.4%, how much will $1 cost in 2085?\n\n### The answers to the above problem can be found in the following page:\n[Answer](https://www.stackoverflow.com/questions/98744548?answertab=oldest#tab-top)\n1.

Marjorie has twice as many cards.\nJanet - 30 cards, Brenda - 12 cards, Marjorie - 31 cards.\n\nIf Brenda has 21 cards then Janet has 36 cards.\n\nIf Janet has 38 cards then Marjorie has 50 cards.\n\nAdd all the cards together you get 239.\n\nIf we make an equation so that \"Janet has more cards than Brenda\" : \"Brenda has 21\" : \"Janet has 36\" : \"Janet Has 45\" : \"Brenda Has 61\":\n\n\n\nIf we eliminate the last step because it is not essential then we get an equation with the answer 239 like here:\n\nIf Brenda Has 21 Cards - Janet Has 36 Cards - Brenda has 61 cards then Janet Has 239 Cards.(239= 65+36)\n\n##### What we can conclude about this situation?\n\nIf the number increases by 19 each time we get the next multiple, then we can get the answer with an equation.

{"text": "I chose that love is D: painful. It's said that love is blind, but I love my dog, she can't see, is deaf and blind. It is unfortunate, but that didn't change my love for her. I knew she can't see so I started to use sign language to teach her words or actions. In the long run she was better than most guide dogs I know. She sleeps with her head on my lap, she doesn't like to be woke up without a good reason like if someone came in the house.\nBut I also know that she loves me more than some people I know. I do believe that true love is being blind and not knowing it. I also think true love is painful and hurtful. But you can't explain the feelings and emotions true love brings out of you. I once did love someone, I had to break it off. The pain was not pleasant, but it was a good experience for me because I'm better now. It made me realize how I can't allow anyone to manipulate me or be in control, but I did learn to control my fear, anxiety, hurt and sadness. Love is contagious, but the pain is not when you no longer love the person anymore. Even though I lost this one love, I know I'm stronger for it.\n### Input:You can tell where a person is from by the clothes they wear, what color their shirt is, it's their style, and the car they drive. But if you were to ask someone if they are from California, Texas, Kansas, Alabama, North Carolina, or Georgia where would you know they were from?. In the long run this person was born and raised from each state. He grew up in every state he mentions. In the long run he is the state, and he didn't lie cause it was the truth.\n\n### Response\nThis is a great thing and shows that one can become anything they want to be. To believe they can become one thing or another helps them reach their full potential. I believe if someone doesn't believe they can achieve anything, then they are right in a way, but they are also wrong in a way. It is believed that without a strong will, one can do nothing. The will does carry a lot of weight, but this same person can still rise above all the odds against them. If", "answer": "A: contagious"}

{"text": "The correct response is \"C wristwatch\"\n\nYou may want to have the choice to include or do not include any input so that the student can see the choice available and have a sense of which way is correct if they need it. I think it is also good to make sure the answer options are not so confusing that it would not be clear to the general student at the lower end of the SIFT range. Idea: The choice between \"A\" and \"B\" may be difficult for someone, but once they see both the answer and choice, they will then know that they must include all the inputs.\n\n#### Student Example Input\n\nThe students who take this quiz can all get partial credit on any question that is answered incorrectly. For example on question 1:\n\nA. Answers: 26, 27 or 28\nB. Answers: 11, 27 or\nC. Answers: 40, 35 or 33\n\nI would argue that in this scenario, even if they do get a partial credit on any question, that is still counting as \"correct\" because it is answering the question \"correctly\" by providing either an answer option or leaving the question blank. I think it is fair to make the option they choose to get credit be an answer option (like #20), or to simply have them leave the question blank (like # 21).\n\n### Response #1(Correct): Janet has 9 more cards than Brenda.

{"text": "Where would you find a sea food restaurant on East coast?\n\n### Input\nWhen I was in the US, I went to 3 restaurants and ate a total of 12 cheeseburgers. If each restaurant served 4 people cheeseburgers, how many times did I go to each restaurant?\n\n### Output\nYou went to each restaurant only once.\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe first step in doing arithmetic is to gather up all the numbers and group them. In this case they are 3, 4, 4. This process is often called combining like terms. A cheeseburger was 1 piece of candy. So the rule is for each time I go into a restaurant, i eat 1 cheeseburger.\n\nNow I can do some basic arithmetic. I will start by multiplying 3 by 3 and get 9. The next step is 4\u00d74=16 and finally I have 4\u00d74= 16 cheeseburgers per person. The numbers are combining and not added or multiplied.\n\n### Input#2\n\nThis is a question that my friend asked me while we were walking in the park.

While each district is not large, each district is not large and each member is elected by fewer voters and representatives each represent fewer people than other countries.\n\n### Support:One of the first requirements of democracy is the equality of all citizens. According to this requirement, while the U.S. can be considered as a federal republic, in which one person has as much power as any other person. All citizens have equal power and political rights. In other countries, like Germany, there are different states, which means that different states have different powers.\n\n### Second, the power should be in the hands of the people, who elect their leaders. This requirement will not be met in the United States. Since only people over the age of 18 can vote, there a large numbers of people who cannot even vote, so only a small number can affect policies.\n\n### Lastly, the requirement that leaders only have one term is not fulfilled in the United States. There are many instances where leaders have had to serve for a second term, due to the fact that the current president was not a strong leader and the election he did win would have been lost.\n\n### Conclusion:Even though the United States is a good model of democracy, it does not satisfy every requirement. In order to be considered a truly democratic state, every one of these core requirements must be met.\n\n### Writing a response:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\n## Demonstration:Input: Someone lacking immortilty will one day die.\nInput: A bumblebee has four fluffy legs and four sharp stingers.\nInput: When you are 40 years old,", "answer": "C: dead"}

{"text": "A. Idaho\n\n### Demostration:\n\nIf you go to new york city, the number of possible customers there could be anywhere from 1 to infinity. However, in idaho, the number of people that you could market your store to is finite. Therefore, you can increase only so much the number of actual customers you have. Conversely, the more people there are in a large market or mall, the more possible customers you will have. It is also likely that people working in the mall or the area will take notice of your store. Therefore, you have the potential to increase the size of your customer base.\n\nBy contrast, there are many possible outcomes if you build the store in a new york city. However, you cannot make your market to be larger than in new york. In a smaller town, many fewer people pass through, allowing for a smaller number of potential customers. In the case of a shopping mall, you are restricted to a smaller amount of people from the city, so this option would be best for a much smaller business.\n\nIn this situation, the mall could be good for a larger business.

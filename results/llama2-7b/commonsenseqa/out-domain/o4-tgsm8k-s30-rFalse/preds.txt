The initialization and destruction functions serve to construct or destroy the object. You can think of the object's state as a mixture of a constructor function and destructor function. The object's state can be restored to its initial default through the destruction function called the destructor function.<n><n>### Constructing an object<n>To create an object, encapsulate in an object and instantiate that object.<n>```cpp<n>class ExampleObject {<n>public:<n><n>    ExampleObject() {<n>    }<n><n>    ~ExampleObject() {<n>    this->message = "";  //Destructor<n>    }<n><n>private:<n><n>    //Variables<n>    string message;<n><n>};<n>```<n><n>You call the object's constructor during initialization. A destructor call the object's destructor function (sometimes called dtor) automatically when an object is destroyed.<n>```cpp<n>Object1 o1; // Initialize o1<n>Object1 o2;//Initialize o2<n>Object1 o3;<n>Object1 o4;<n>//Now destroy these objects one at a time<n>Object1 o1. ~Object1(); //Destroy o1<n>Object1 O2. ~Object1();//Destroy o2<n>Object1 O1. ~Object1(). //Destroy o3<n>Object1 O4. ~Object1();<n> <n>```<n><n>### Classes and Objects <n>Inside the class definition is a name of an object called a member object. The member object is known as a member object for the class definition.<n><n>Creating Object<n>```cpp<n>class Student {<n><n>    private:<n>        string studentName;<n>        int _age;<n><n>    public:<n>        float getGrade() {<n>            return grade;<n>        }<n>};<n>```<n>To get a concrete object, you have to give that object a name or instantiated the object. You then assign the values to the object's property. The object property becomes a member of the object.<n>```cpp <n>int main() {

Choices:  When a grass sprout grows to a certain height, its root network gets so strong that it pulls the entire grass plant up out of the ground and lets it float on the wind.  There is a special group of seeds that live on the tops of grass blades. These grasses are able to be carried across the countryside by the wind until they land somewhere new.  The grass is so light that the wind can blow it anywhere, and soon it grows a root system that pulls it out the ground.  (A) Grasses are very light and the wind can easily blow them from place to place.  There is a seed that lives on the top of the grass and floats from place to place. The seed has a special property that allows it to float in the air. After a while, the grass develops strong roots and is able to grow anywhere it lands. The plant has a seed at the tip of the stem that grows to a certain length, stretches out and lets the plant float around. It makes it easier for the grass to move around.  It grows a seed on its top that floats around in the wind.  (B) Grass gets new places in a few different ways. Some seeds develop roots that wrap around the grass blades, pulling the plant along with them. Other grasses are able to make their own little raft by stretching their leaves out and letting them float. Some grasses have tiny seeds that fall of their own accord and are carried away by the wind.  (C) New grass plants take a lot of time to develop and grow. The plants that do grow are typically too tiny to be able to get to new places on their own.  (D) New grass plants take some time to grow, but they do not need to move from one place to another.  (E) New grass grows

The program that you print will depend on the type of computation that you are running.<n><n>The question "How many more miles will it be to town?" is a math problem; because the computer only knows the distance to the town, if can print "3 more miles" or "4 more miles."<n><n><n>### Hints:<n><n>This program demonstrates the idea of reading, processing, and outputting data. We will often give you data in the form of a string, we can then store that data and print it later. To print it, we need to write a program that reads and stores data.<n><n>First, note the basic structure of programs on the computer. There are three places where you write programs: 1) The Input Section, which is where you tell the computer what to do, 2) The Problem Section, where you ask the computer what to do or how to do it, and 3) The Output Section, where you tell the computer how to print its results. Note that all three sections are numbered 1..n, but they are listed separately. This is because the computer needs to know in advance when it is supposed to read input from us, when it is supposed to do math, and when it is supposed to print.<n><n>In the input section, you do some programming with strings. The problem section shows how to make a decision: To print one, we do not pass input to our next section, instead, we pass zero and that decision takes us to the next section.<n>The output section provides a structure which includes how to print new lines by increasing the "row

We will add all this numbers<n><n>So we will need to take $190(30*11) + $30*Days, I assume 11 is enough, so we have our answer. The next part is about adding more days, so if x is added to our $190(n*30) + $30(x). If x is more 11 we get $348, 1780 for 450+690 for $50, then $1310.<n><n>#### Question 8.<n><n>We have 400 divided to 20, which is equal to 20 times.

We are given 400/(20*60) so it is equal to 4800, but we can write it as 40*250 which is 1000, so there is a trick here. But let's think about what is faster. To drive 1000 miles and it takes 75 minutes, but 1000/75 is not exactly 13.33, but it means that it is more than 13, then we can say that 13 minutes are enough.<n><n>#### Questions 7.<n><n>The total is equal to x+(Days*30) so it is 16+(Days*30).<n><n>Then we will take Day that is 16 and multiply it with 30, we will have 216.

What is this situation illustrating? Choices: A. income inequality B. an unforeseen problem C. a public utility D. a good investment E: opportunity cost<n>Output: C<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question on the card<n><n>#### Question 1: The answer on the card reads: “An opportunity cost, also called an economic gain or an economic penalty, is the value of whatever has to be given up in order to obtain something else. In the example above, eating in restaurants involved economic loss when restaurants were not present. To illustrate a public utility, we turn to water; the need to drink water can be treated as a utility.”<n><n>#### Question 2: The answer on the back of the card reads: “In a large city such as New Orleans, the water utility has to ensure that a large number of people have enough water every day to maintain health and sanitation. In order to do so, the city has to build an extensive water system that is distributed throughout the city. The system must be able to supply a constant flow of water no matter how many large bodies of water are being used at any given time in the city. In other words, it must be able to respond and adjust to the constant demand that city residents put on it while maintaining an adequate supply. Because water is a utility, the city must ensure that it meets the constant demands of its citizens on a daily basis, no matter how many people are using the utility.”<n>

How does the car rental problem work? I found the solution using a tree diagram where we sum 1/30 and 1/19 where 1/30 is the cost per day and 1/10 is the price for the first week.

When you have $300 to spend, and it costs $2 for any single trip, you can take either any amount of trips, or choose a distance greater than any single trip. For example, if you take two trips of distance d₁ and d₂ respectively, a total distance greater than d₁ + d₂ is required to earn $3, and if you took d₁ + d₂ trips, you would earn $3 immediately. Since it is not specified that this is a one-day job and that no other money will be earned, you cannot know how many trips or how much total distance the client wants you to drive. So, the answer is B, $30.<n><n>Since you are given the per-item costs, and total for the day, not the number of items purchased, you would need to figure out how much money you can spend on items for

You are given a set of tenants from your complex that you are instructed to give advice to.  These people have asked you for advice that they believe will be helpful in minimizing their rent.  Using the above multiple choice questions and your knowledge about the people’s preferences, you will tell them what they must do to minimize rent.<n><n>### Note:<n>The questions are very random, but not in a silly sort of way.<n>They might also be unanswerable.<n><n>### Input Format:<n>The file will contain questions with people's preferences for each, and some basic rules and constraints.<n><n>### Output Format:<n>Please write some code to calculate the rent amount based on user's behavior and input.  You may assume that the questions and inputs will be consistent, and  only in the case where the inputs will give incorrect rent amounts (i.e., if you rent a space at time 0.)<n><n>### Important notes:<n>1. The questions will always follow a simple rule.  For instance (in the first example): the car rental charge may in fact be a function of the length of time the car is rented (for instance, if it lasts longer than 1 week, the rate is $10 per day, and if it's for 10 days or more, the rate drops to $10 per month.)<n><n>2. You should assume that in each case, the user's rent will be at least 50% of their total income for that unit.  i.e., if you asked for $150 per month on a one bedroom apt, we expect the maximum rent charged to be at least $75 (assume that the income is $1500, which is quite high - in reality you'd likely set a limit at $500 or lower.)<n><n><n>### Sample Inputs and Output:<n>Below you'll find sample inputs and output for your script.

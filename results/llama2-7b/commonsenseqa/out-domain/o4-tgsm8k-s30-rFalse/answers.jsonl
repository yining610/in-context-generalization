{"text": "A. Suitcase.\n\n### Discussion:\nThere are a few ways to transport jewelery on vacation:\n\n1. In a suitcase: The idea of transporting jewellery in a suitcase seems like a good idea. It\u2019s something that would be easy for a person to grab and get access to. The problem with packing jewellery with clothes in a suitcase is that if you go for a ride in a car, it will bounce around in the car and the suitcase might get bumped off to the side. If this happens to your jewelery, you could end up with items being lost or broken.\n\n2. In a department store: Another way to safely store jewellery while you\u2019re on vacation is to go into a department store and purchase a vault. These vaults would be under lock and key.  You can purchase a vault at the store so that you can put all your jewellery in there and lock it up.  The problem with storing jewellery in these vaults is that it can be hard to get to them.  If you leave your vault at the store and you\u2019re going on a camping trip, who\u2019s going to go with you? You\u2019ll have to plan ahead and make sure someone you trust is there to lock up or help lock up your vault.\n\n3. Keep it in the bank: If you\u2019re going on vacation and you\u2019re worried about where you can keep any jewelry that you take with you safely, the best thing to do is put it in a bank.  In a bank, they have safes that can get opened only with a key. If you put your jewellery into a bank, you know it is safe from being lost or stolen, because it\u2019s locked away and you can only retrieve it if you have a key.\n\nIt is obvious that putting jewellery into  a suitcase or department store is not safe. It is also dangerous to put your jewellary into your bank account. Therefore, the only way to transport your jeweller safe while on vacation is to put it in you bag.\n\n\n### Input\n\n### How do I know if the price of a pair of skis is worth it? \nA.", "answer": "A: suitcase"}

So based on this can you explain to me how many days are needed based on this, also how many hours are needed, what I have to start doing, at what time I have to be there, and when I have to leave in order for me to not oversleep?\n\n### Response\n\nI understand that your shopping trip is important because of your good friend, and the time that you must be there. Now, in order to complete this effectively, you can first plan your trip by picking a time when you are going to leave in which will prevent you from oversleeping. After you have planned your trip, you can now find out how many hours you will need to complete your shopping in order for you not to oversleep. This can be found by using the formula \"number of hours * time needed to buy gifts\" plus \"number of hours *  time needed to pick up ice cream\" plus \"number of minutes at cafe\" plus \"minutes to arrive at birthday celebration (including travel)\" This is the reason why you can get an idea on how long you need to plan this so that not only will you not oversleep, but you will also not be left behind either. Now, in order for you to be there to get him the gifts, you need at least one time to take the gifts, the trip to the store would be a whole day. This means that when you arrive at the destination, you'll have already spent an entire day to pick them out. And when you take your friend to the store, you need at least a full 20minutes to find all the items. This means that when your friend wants to get them out of the car, make sure he gets one item at least every 20minutes. And, 12 items", "answer": "A: linen closet"}

The company made itself out to be this progressive company who would give their employees the recognition they needed as people.

The answer is no, it\u2019s likely to want to build family together. However you do not know if they want to build family together through the normal or abnormal process. So you have to start with the more unlikely answer and continue from there. The next obvious answer would be \u201cB\u201d it\u2019s likely to fall in love. However if you fall in love with someone without a family background then you may not like doing this one with them, I would answer \u201cno\u201d to that one too. From there you would have to ask that person if they really do have a family background. If the answer is yes then you would have to say \u201cyes\u201d to \u201cC\u201d that they are likely to make love with \u201cA.\u201d However if they say no then you would say \u201cno\u201d to both \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d and continue like this until you can eliminate all options.\n\nYou can also do this from top to bottom, but this is more difficult and will likely take a lot of time and may not be so accurate. I have found that when you work from bottom to top you get the same results much faster and without having to go back and rethink everything.\n\nYou can do this test more accurately because of the way we think.

In particular, note the differences between traditional and digital money.\n\n### Response\n\nAnswer: It would seem reasonable for us to use money as a means of exchange. In doing so, we need to be familiar with the differences between digital types of money versus physical forms; however, there is not just one form of digital money with the different forms ranging from paper bills, and coins, credit cards, and digital media (such as PayPal). As a whole, it seems like adding them up would result in some big numbers. However, this would need to include money used all over the entire world and not just the United States.\n\nEven when considering just the US, we can see that we currently have 3.3 trillion dollars in circulation. 90% of the US population has debit cards and over 50% of the population has smart phones.  With this in mind, we cannot forget the global nature of money with estimates that there are at least 3.4 billion debit cards worldwide and an estimated 50+ billion mobile phones. In this sense, counting up all the money in circulation would be nearly impossible and we are better off finding more ways to use and exchange money in the future.", "answer": "A: military base"}

It takes him 50 \nminutes to change the flat and get back on the bike. He's riding at  40 \nmph. How many minutes did he ride before he had the flat?  \n[Accepted answer: \n- 45 minutes. Wrong answer (s): 22, 23, 30, 41.]\n\n### Response Answer:\n45 minutes\n\n#### Stepping and Explanations: \nThe total amount of time to change the flat tires = 0.5\n\nThe time taken to change and go back = 0.7\n\nTotal time = 0.5 + 0.7 = 1.2\n\nRiding at 40 mph = 60 mph.\n\nTherefore, we subtract 60 minutes from the total time, we get 45 minutes", "answer": "E: copulate"}

A nested loop is an outer loop that controls an inner loop.  The inner loop is what we call a \u201csub-looper.\u201d  To create it, use the while loop.  The outer loop uses the for loop to control the inner looping.\n* Here's a helpful tip: When you're working with a nested-loop problem, you should first create a loop to determine how many times the inner loop should execute.  Create your sub-looper first and leave its number as 1.  Then, work on increasing its limit so each term in the inner set will be repeated that number of times.  When you are finished with your nested loop task, don\u2019t forget to reset the inner loop limit back to 1 since you never use it.\n* You will have trouble with nested loops when the first loop is a simple for loop.\n\n### Assignment\nThe problem I'm about to share with you is an example of what we used in the above instruction.

There are quite a few ways to enjoy renting a car. The first one is the days the car is rented for. In fact, most of those places charge $33 per weekday and only $20 on weekends per rental. The car rental rates also differ from the size of the car you have rented. A small car is not costly to rent. A compact car, on the other hand, could cost $13 per day. A midsize car rental could be as much as $30 per day. For a full size car, you would have to pay no less than $39. It might be a little more costly to rent the luxury car. For a standard SUV, you would have to budget at least $54. The car rental sites typically charge you extra for every mile in the mileage. \n\n- [Return to Main Page](../../README.md)", "answer": "A: conquer opponent"}

The initialization and destruction functions serve to construct or destroy the object. You can think of the object's state as a mixture of a constructor function and destructor function. The object's state can be restored to its initial default through the destruction function called the destructor function.\n\n### Constructing an object\nTo create an object, encapsulate in an object and instantiate that object.\n```cpp\nclass ExampleObject {\npublic:\n\n    ExampleObject() {\n    }\n\n    ~ExampleObject() {\n    this->message = \"\";  //Destructor\n    }\n\nprivate:\n\n    //Variables\n    string message;\n\n};\n```\n\nYou call the object's constructor during initialization. A destructor call the object's destructor function (sometimes called dtor) automatically when an object is destroyed.\n```cpp\nObject1 o1; // Initialize o1\nObject1 o2;//Initialize o2\nObject1 o3;\nObject1 o4;\n//Now destroy these objects one at a time\nObject1 o1. ~Object1(); //Destroy o1\nObject1 O2. ~Object1();//Destroy o2\nObject1 O1. ~Object1(). //Destroy o3\nObject1 O4. ~Object1();\n \n```\n\n### Classes and Objects \nInside the class definition is a name of an object called a member object. The member object is known as a member object for the class definition.\n\nCreating Object\n```cpp\nclass Student {\n\n    private:\n        string studentName;\n        int _age;\n\n    public:\n        float getGrade() {\n            return grade;\n        }\n};\n```\nTo get a concrete object, you have to give that object a name or instantiated the object. You then assign the values to the object's property. The object property becomes a member of the object.\n```cpp \nint main() {", "answer": "D: take money"}

Choices:  When a grass sprout grows to a certain height, its root network gets so strong that it pulls the entire grass plant up out of the ground and lets it float on the wind.  There is a special group of seeds that live on the tops of grass blades. These grasses are able to be carried across the countryside by the wind until they land somewhere new.  The grass is so light that the wind can blow it anywhere, and soon it grows a root system that pulls it out the ground.  (A) Grasses are very light and the wind can easily blow them from place to place.  There is a seed that lives on the top of the grass and floats from place to place. The seed has a special property that allows it to float in the air. After a while, the grass develops strong roots and is able to grow anywhere it lands. The plant has a seed at the tip of the stem that grows to a certain length, stretches out and lets the plant float around. It makes it easier for the grass to move around.  It grows a seed on its top that floats around in the wind.  (B) Grass gets new places in a few different ways. Some seeds develop roots that wrap around the grass blades, pulling the plant along with them. Other grasses are able to make their own little raft by stretching their leaves out and letting them float. Some grasses have tiny seeds that fall of their own accord and are carried away by the wind.  (C) New grass plants take a lot of time to develop and grow. The plants that do grow are typically too tiny to be able to get to new places on their own.  (D) New grass plants take some time to grow, but they do not need to move from one place to another.

The program that you print will depend on the type of computation that you are running.\n\nThe question \"How many more miles will it be to town?\" is a math problem; because the computer only knows the distance to the town, if can print \"3 more miles\" or \"4 more miles.\"\n\n\n### Hints:\n\nThis program demonstrates the idea of reading, processing, and outputting data. We will often give you data in the form of a string, we can then store that data and print it later. To print it, we need to write a program that reads and stores data.\n\nFirst, note the basic structure of programs on the computer. There are three places where you write programs: 1) The Input Section, which is where you tell the computer what to do, 2) The Problem Section, where you ask the computer what to do or how to do it, and 3) The Output Section, where you tell the computer how to print its results. Note that all three sections are numbered 1..n, but they are listed separately. This is because the computer needs to know in advance when it is supposed to read input from us, when it is supposed to do math, and when it is supposed to print.\n\nIn the input section, you do some programming with strings. The problem section shows how to make a decision: To print one, we do not pass input to our next section, instead, we pass zero and that decision takes us to the next section.\nThe output section provides a structure which includes how to print new lines by increasing the \"row", "answer": "A: joy"}

{"text": "E\n\n## Answer:\n### Instruction:\n\n#### Question 10.\n\nWe have the variable 'x'.\n\n#### Question 9.\n\nWe have 'Days' with value of 11 and $30 in first statement.\n\nThen we have 'x' that is $30*Days. We will add all this numbers\n\nSo we will need to take $190(30*11) + $30*Days, I assume 11 is enough, so we have our answer. The next part is about adding more days, so if x is added to our $190(n*30) + $30(x). If x is more 11 we get $348, 1780 for 450+690 for $50, then $1310.\n\n#### Question 8.\n\nWe have 400 divided to 20, which is equal to 20 times. Now, let's try and apply 40(x) which is equal to 400/(x*1) but x is 20 in this case, so we have 200. This solution is really stupid.\n\nNow let's try and figure out number of hours. We are given 400/(20*60) so it is equal to 4800, but we can write it as 40*250 which is 1000, so there is a trick here. But let's think about what is faster. To drive 1000 miles and it takes 75 minutes, but 1000/75 is not exactly 13.33, but it means that it is more than 13, then we can say that 13 minutes are enough.\n\n#### Questions 7.\n\nThe total is equal to x+(Days*30) so it is 16+(Days*30).\n\nThen we will take Day that is 16 and multiply it with 30, we will have 216. If we multiply both answers we get 516.\n\nOr we can do a trick here, we can take the sum of both numbers, so if we multiply it back we will have the", "answer": "D: shopping mall"}

What is this situation illustrating? Choices: A. income inequality B. an unforeseen problem C. a public utility D. a good investment E: opportunity cost\nOutput: C\n\n### Instruction:Answer the question on the card\n\n#### Question 1: The answer on the card reads: \u201cAn opportunity cost, also called an economic gain or an economic penalty, is the value of whatever has to be given up in order to obtain something else. In the example above, eating in restaurants involved economic loss when restaurants were not present. To illustrate a public utility, we turn to water; the need to drink water can be treated as a utility.\u201d\n\n#### Question 2: The answer on the back of the card reads: \u201cIn a large city such as New Orleans, the water utility has to ensure that a large number of people have enough water every day to maintain health and sanitation. In order to do so, the city has to build an extensive water system that is distributed throughout the city. The system must be able to supply a constant flow of water no matter how many large bodies of water are being used at any given time in the city. In other words, it must be able to respond and adjust to the constant demand that city residents put on it while maintaining an adequate supply. Because water is a utility, the city must ensure that it meets the constant demands of its citizens on a daily basis, no matter how many people are using the utility.\u201d", "answer": "C: stomach ache"}

{"text": "E: acute angulated\n\n---\n#### Solution:\n\nFirst question:\n\nWe know the formula here: $30 + $190 = $220 therefore: $220/days = $30 since $220/7 = $30, then $30/7 = $4.285556\n\n20/7 = 2.857\n\nWhich is approximately $4. so:\n\n$30 +$4 = $34, so Jennie paid $34 to rent her car for 11days\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Question:\n\nThe answer is in the question, but I find this very easy to do so I thought I will share\n\n20 head of cattle / 2 = 10 * 60 = 600 therefore: 600//20 = 10 days.\n\nIt will be: 10 * 20 = 200\n\nSince 240/2 = 120 and 120/2 = 60. Therefore 60 * 2 = 12\n\nThird Question:\n\n\n\nEric has two options: \n\n\n\n\nHe can do the division and multiply to get: $500/2 = $250 but as we see, the total cost will be:\n\n$250 + $300 = $550\n\n\n\n\n$142 /2 = $76 * 6 = $438\n\n\n\nSo Eric might want to do this:\n\n7 * $60 = $420.\n\n\n\nWhich is the right ans, but he can go for 22 days if he chooses so or he can pay $580 to go for 22days.\n\nFourth Question:\n\nHere we need to find the angle, so the tangent: tan(x) is calculated according to this formula: Tan(x) = opposite /adjacent. Therefore x = adjacent/opposite\n\n\n\n\nTan(x) = 2/3\n\n\n\ntan(x) = 6/2 \n\n\n\nX = 6 * 2 =", "answer": "D: clear"}

When you have $300 to spend, and it costs $2 for any single trip, you can take either any amount of trips, or choose a distance greater than any single trip. For example, if you take two trips of distance d\u2081 and d\u2082 respectively, a total distance greater than d\u2081 + d\u2082 is required to earn $3, and if you took d\u2081 + d\u2082 trips, you would earn $3 immediately. Since it is not specified that this is a one-day job and that no other money will be earned, you cannot know how many trips or how much total distance the client wants you to drive. So, the answer is B, $30.\n\nSince you are given the per-item costs, and total for the day, not the number of items purchased, you would need to figure out how much money you can spend on items for", "answer": "A: curiosity"}

Programming is a process that involves translating data, data modeling, and insights.\n\nThere will be a mix of individual homework assignments and classroom group activities. I expect you to write your own programs. In other words, copying other people's code and claiming it as your own is not allowed. (And, to be clear, there are no \"answers\" or \"solutions\" to assignments, either!)\n \nLecture  will involve programming exercises and we will use a textbook, \"Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition: A Hands-On \nIntroduction to Programming  \",  by Eric Ries. I suggest reading at the end of each lecture and beginning of each class.\n\nStudents  should attend the scheduled meetings unless they make other arrangements with me in advance.\n\nI expect the highest levels of honesty, integrity, and hard work in all activities. I will not tolerate unethical behavior of any kind: cheating, plagiarism, or any other violation of the University of Minnesota's Honor  Board Student Code of Conduct.\n\n### How We Will Do The Class:\n\n* 1. I'll send you a list  of suggested class materials to read.\n\n* 2. Work as a small team with one other person and complete the assignment.\n\n* 3.  Assignments will be due at the beginning of the next class.\n\n\n\n#### Rules...\n\nAll work", "answer": "C: freezer"}

These people have asked you for advice that they believe will be helpful in minimizing their rent.  Using the above multiple choice questions and your knowledge about the people\u2019s preferences, you will tell them what they must do to minimize rent.\n\n### Note:\nThe questions are very random, but not in a silly sort of way.\nThey might also be unanswerable.\n\n### Input Format:\nThe file will contain questions with people's preferences for each, and some basic rules and constraints.\n\n### Output Format:\nPlease write some code to calculate the rent amount based on user's behavior and input.  You may assume that the questions and inputs will be consistent, and  only in the case where the inputs will give incorrect rent amounts (i.e., if you rent a space at time 0.)\n\n### Important notes:\n1. The questions will always follow a simple rule.  For instance (in the first example): the car rental charge may in fact be a function of the length of time the car is rented (for instance, if it lasts longer than 1 week, the rate is $10 per day, and if it's for 10 days or more, the rate drops to $10 per month.)\n\n2. You should assume that in each case, the user's rent will be at least 50% of their total income for that unit.  i.e., if you asked for $150 per month on a one bedroom apt, we expect the maximum rent charged to be at least $75 (assume that the income is $1500, which is quite high - in reality you'd likely set a limit at $500 or lower.)\n\n\n### Sample Inputs and Output:\nBelow you'll find sample inputs and output for your script.

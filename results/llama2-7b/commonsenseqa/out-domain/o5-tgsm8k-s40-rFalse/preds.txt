Going to church and being within the community that it has created gives me a sense of belonging and allows me to focus on how the life that we have been created for and living within the communities allows us to make decisions that are needed to live a good life. I believe going into court with an understanding of why people do the things they do allows the justice system to be successful in correcting and addressing the criminal behaviors.

Choices:  A: school B: populated area C: military base D: opera E: church<n><n>### Response:		<n>#### **Pick "A: School"**<n>Theater is often incorporated into the general school program, especially in the lower grades. In these early years, it is usually referred to as “drama”, as children are introduced to acting, improvisation, and story telling. It is also common practice to have a yearly performance in the elementary and middle-school grades, in the form of a play or musical. However, theater is one of the many art forms that can also be used to teach children about many different cultures, values and traditions. Many schools have after school programs and classes. In this way, students can also learn about the history and origins of theater.<n><n>#### **Pick: "C: Military Base"**<n>Military bases have traditionally had their own performing arts groups, in which theatrical productions have usually been performed by volunteer civilians as well as military personnel. The most well known theater group in the United States is the United States Military Academy's Theatre In Motion which performs each year at the West Point Military Academy.<n><n>Theater has had a long relationship with the military.

In this example, the instruction is to produce a piece of work, whereas in later examples, the task is to perform a mathematical calculation.<n><n>### Answer the following multiple choice question<n><n>In this multiple choice question, which the user can select from.<n><n>### A: Nearest house<n>In the response, the question asks us to “Please respond to the below question”. This would seem like an odd request. Usually a question is a sequence of words requesting a response, e.g., “What’s your favorite color?” or “Which of these four is the answer”.<n><n>To understand this more, we can compare it to “What’s your response to the question below?” and “Which of these is the answer?”.<n><n>The first version, “Which of these [list] is the answer?”, seems to be like a valid piece of instruction. However, this is no longer valid in the context where the feature is described. The original description of the format of the instructions makes them too narrow for this purpose.<n><n>Conversely, the format “Which of these” would be invalid for an instruction describing a mathematical calculation or similar.<n><n>Therefore, the “Please respond to the question below” must be the correct syntax for textual instructions.<n><n>### B: Workplace<n>It could be a case where this question is used as a distraction. If the user selects B, then they will be asked to answer a question. However, this question would be a request for a piece of work, and therefore a distraction, which makes it likely that the distraction is used to slow down the solving process.<n><n>### C: Surface of earth<n>This answer seems to be used as an example of something to ask for that is not possible. However, we know that the questions used as distractions are questions within the instruction itself.<n><n>### D: Office block<n>See B<n><n>### E: his feet<n>See B<n><n>#### Examples of other answers

Choices:  A: redemption B: isolation C: absolution D: great relief E: feel better<n><n>### Response:		<n>If the answer is A, then the sentence should be changed to read "If I have a forgiveness of attitude toward someone, what does they receive?" Because forgiveness is an action that the person makes not a state of being.<n><n>### Input:"It's sooo frustrating when you're right at a stage in development where you know what you're doing and life is going along fine like it always has and then the rug gets pulled out from under you." How should the sentence be revised?

How long are the shadows from the building 6 hours past noon in inches?<n>Answer: 360<n><n>### Input:What do you get for not moving your car during the required time? Choices:  A: towed B: accidents C: driving D: getting tired E: ticket<n><n>### Response:		<n>> The answer that I choose would be B: accidents. I think this answer is the most accurate and most realistic as there are many reasons why one's car would be towed such as the car is parked on a street during a street fair. If one's car was parked during a street fair, there are usually notices on the ground or posted on the street pole next to the ticket you get to remind one to move their car once the event ends as it is blocking the view of other customers who want to walk down the line and see everything that the shop has to offer. Another reason would be that the car's parking time is expired and was not moved back to the parking space after the time limit. It was probably because the driver forgot or forgot to get the car back to its parking spot before the time limit is reached. I feel this answer is the answer that makes the most sense among the others as all of the others seem too extreme and in this case it wouldn't be fair enough for a car to be towed, unless the car's parker was a chronic forgetter and kept on leaving his/her car parked in the same place, causing the car to be towed numerous times, and the only solution now is to get a new car because you can't even count on your old one now anymore.<n><n>### Input:[The shadows get 1543 inches at 7:30.] Which time is that?<n><n>### Response:[7:30]<n><n>### Inputs:[Sunrise at 6:00.

Choices:  A: driveway B: the event C: scrap heap D: parking garage E: repair shop<n><n>### Response:		<n>#### D: 04-23-2013<n>> There are 8 choices for this question.<n><n>## Solution<n>In order to accomplish the tasks, we must create a series of if, while, and for elseif structures.<n><n>With the first task, the question asks us to add our numbers together and subtract the difference and multiply by 5. So, we create a while loop to iterate through the numbers until there are no more subtraction operations. Inside of the while loop we create a variable "total", then append to it for each loop iteration. Since we need a break condition once we hit 90, we use "break".<n><n>After running this, I get 80 but the instructions said to subtract the numbers and get 90 as the result, thus, something else is probably wrong with my input.<n><n>After some thinking the while loop can iterate through the numbers without doing anything else. So, I had to rethink my while loop. <n>After some time I get 80 in response to the original instruction even though the result should have been 90. I did some research and found that I used variables "result" and "target" instead of "sum" and "total" respectively. Once I changed those to match I was able to arrive at my 90 expected result and was told to write a program to show me that sum and target were 1 less than each other.<n><n>With the second task, the instructions are pretty self explaneatory except for the subtraction operation which the statement says is not needed since the operations prior to and after are. So, I first create a variable to store the result and then in the if statement where the comparison between the number of Doebrman puppies and Schnauzers occurs I create a result variable to create. I then set it to a variable value of one less than the answer we expect in order for us to perform the subtraction.<n><n>With the rest of the task, I was required to modify the for statement which I think is necessary since it is not explicitly stated in the instructions. I simply put the statements inside the for statement and not inside of the if statement. I thought if I put it inside of the statement it would create an infinite loop because there would never be a time to check if the value of if statement "a" met the statement.<n><n>With my above modification for statement,

Choices:  A: aquarium B: mediterranean sea C: south pacific D: pool hall E: pacific ocean<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Answer A: Aquarium<n><n>#### Why?<n>Since the shark is probably a large predator, such as a Tiger Shark, a Great White, Lemon Shark, or maybe even a Hammerhead, he's looking to eat. This likely means that he is the big fish in the pond and the smaller creatures are prey. In other words, the shark is looking to feed and will probably be found in a location where he can find prey.<n><n>#### How do you know?<n>By the question's description of the shark, we can clearly see that the shark is aggressive enough to take on the other predators in the aquarium.<n><n>### Inputs: I live in the south-east. If  I go west, I'm going towards the west coast. If  I go north, I'm going toward the coast in the north.<n><n>### Response<n><n>Answer D:  Pacific Ocean<n><n>#### Why? <n>Based on the question, we can assume that the direction of travel is only relative to the person and that if someone were to be looking down from the clouds, or even, heaven's no! The stars, they would see a line coming from where the person started, through the destination. This would indicate movement north east. By using this method, the only possible answer is D, since the Pacific Ocean is always moving north east from anywhere in the Northern Hemisphere.<n>#### How Do you know? <n>By knowing that the question does not assume a north-south alignment, we could eliminate all of the other possible directions based on the question.<n> <n>### Input:  The speed of sound is about 787 miles per hour.

Choices:  A: action B: demonstration C: understanding D: vote E: revolution<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### A: action<n><n>### Inputs:Which of the following would be a good example of positive action taken to make change in our culture? Choices:   <n>> A: Write a poem about how you feel<n>> B: Write a blog<n>> C: Give money to a charity<n>> D: Protest publicly against a cause<n>> E: Call to action to everyone in your network<n><n>### A is a good example of action because it requires direct engagement and focus on the problem you are trying to solve. For example you might write a poem about how you personally feel about the current culture surrounding this issue.<n><n>### B is also action. It may not require as much personal direct engagement, but it still takes the person behind it to share the thoughts on the issue they feel strongly about. For example this could be done through a blog.<n><n>### C is an example of direct monetary action. The donation of money is one of the oldest, most respected forms of action in our society. This action does not require personal engagement, and does not require a public statement through an act of protest. Instead through a direct donation, you are directly supporting a cause.<n><n>### D is an example of action. It is the form of action most historically seen as the only effective way of impacting a society through positive action. Protesting is, by definition, active, and takes an effort to be effective.<n><n>### E is perhaps the worst choice, in the question it is suggested that an action taken by someone who is already connected to others online, or through a digital network could lead to a more change. To say that an action can be done, requires the presence of that action online or on social media.<n><n>### The example provided, the call to action where people are asked to make statements about a hot button issue or event and put them online, is the worst example of action.<n><n>### Input A:Which of the previous answers is the best action of the following? Choices:<n><n>### B: Write a poem about homeless people<n><n>### A does not require action to be effective. Writing a poem implies that you are using your voice by speaking directly to what you feel the issue surrounding homeless people is. However while this is an example of action, it doesn't require any action by the writer in doing so. Because

How long are the shadows from the building 6 hours past noon in inches?<n>Answer: 360<n><n>### Input:The people in class were instructed to brainstorm ideas, how would they use their minds for this? Choices:  A: shake hands B: control events C: talk to each other D: think creatively E: dress themselves<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>#### Part 1<n><n>This question asked how much money we would earn if we sold of our seashells. The answer should be $54 because we sold 30 seashels and each seashell we sold cost $1.20.<n><n>#### Part 2<n><n>This question is easy to understand. This question wanted to know how many fish we had after we caught all the fish. We started with 9 fish (Jordan and Perry caught 4 fish and each of their fish was worth double). One-fourth equals 3 fish. The answer is 9 fish.<n><n>#### Part2<n><n>This question could be answered by knowing how to subtract. Jordan caught 4 and Perry caught double what he did. The question wanted to know how long the shadows from the buildings. This question is simple, it asked for hours and the answer was 360(4x5).<n><n>#### Part2 <n><n>We could answer this question for how much the people in the story would earn, if we knew the population size and hourly wage. This question wants us to compare how the two people used their minds. This is a trick question, since the question was not asking how they used their minds, but rather how they use their minds. Since the class was learning about brainstorming, I believe choice A was the correct answer.<n><n>### Part3: <n><n><n>

When I run it, it's returning the correct percentage based on the input. An example if when the input was 1, it returned 100. When the input was 10, it returned 1. When I run it in my browser, it gives the correct output. I cannot figure out what's wrong.<n><n>(Hint: Think about what happens when a value is out of range)<n><n>### Solution<n>The output to your percentCheck function should be a string, not a float. If the value of 'percent' is larger than the value of the 'vali', then you'll get a divide-by-zero error, and you will need to cover your bases and either round to the nearest one, give no output, or check the value of the percentage before you divide by 'vali' and make sure it's less than 1 before dividing. Since the input to the function must be an 'int' you need to make sure the percentage is a float and not an integer.

Choices:  A: bathe B: bite C: die of cancer D: obesity E: copulate<n><n>### Response:		<n>A, the correct answer is "bathe". Cats don't bathe, or they at least would probably need to be told how to do it. Bats don't either. We humans do, but the cat needs to be told what to do, and since the cat already knows what to do, it must be a mistake with the statement. Also, since we humans would need to be told what to bath in, it must be non-fluid in nature and we don't die of cancer from bathing, nor do any animals, since the humans are the ones that die from cancer. So, John must be bathing some type of animal that needs a bath.<n>

The sentence continues to say “on a red bridge” which indicates a place. There are three choices, which states at least one choice must be wrong. Choice A (refrigerator) is off topic because the question refers to “people” and a refrigerator only stores food and water (which you don’t eat directly, you only consume food that is in the fridge). Choice B (engineering school) also is incorrect as it states “you can eat fruit,” so it too refers to people not places. Choice C (San Francisco) is incorrect because it contains “San Francisco.” The question does not explicitly state the location, but a few other questions mention other locations in San Francisco such as “tree” and the answer given in Choice D (tree) is the correct answer. Choice E does also contain “refrigerator” even though the question only mentions “refrigerator A few minutes after the question is over an article will be given and the question re-started.

Choices:  A: question B: dispute C: deny D: contradict E: refuse<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>### Input<n>A number of things can go wrong, depending on what an applicant does to a reference.  If the applicant simply asks an applicant's references to confirm information the applicant provided, nothing bad happens.

This could cause a problem because the applicant might find that he or she cannot secure a job with someone who has seen reference reports.<n><n>### A reference could also confirm negative information about the applicants.  But, if that reference does not include negative comments, a report would not result.  If the applicants, for example, had an argument with a reference, the person who heard about it would consider it when weighing the report.<n><n>### Review<n>If you confirm incorrect information about applicant, someone who has seen your reference report might not hire you (and others' bad reports might show up later about you).<n><n>If you refuse a request (particularly if you are negative about the employee), you might

How long are the shadows from the building 6 hours past noon in inches?<n>Answer: 360<n><n>### Input:Where is a good place to sore a wind instrument in you home? Choices:  A: under bed B: symphony C: music room D: band practice E: music store<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Instructions: The word "mint" has been chosen as the new national currency. It replaces all coins currently in circulation.<n><n>### Demo: The mint's production capacity is 1,000,000 pieces. The mint operates as a single unit, and each mint must complete all 1000 before getting a new assignment.  The mint makes a single minting machine. Each mint makes two coin types: silver quarters, and nickels.<n><n>Silver quarters have a smaller surface area, and thus take less time to complete (2 seconds per minting machine).  Each silver quarter takes 16 seconds to make, and is assigned 1.16 silver quarters per minting machine.<n><n>Each nickel takes 24 seconds to make and is assigned 1 nickel per minting machine.  The remaining silver quarters per mint are assigned by the time it takes for a single minting machine to make the remaining quarters. <n><n>All coins remain in circulation (each minting machine may make 1000 times 24 or 24,000 coins per minting).  After 50 minting hours, half of the minting machines are removed from production, and the minting process starts over where it left off on these removed machines. <n><n>The minting process completes 30 minted coins per hour for each minting machine.  If one mint produces 25,000 quarters and 25,050 nickels at the same time, the remaining quarters are minted after 19 minting hours have elapsed, and the minting machine's stop. <n><n>In 26 minting hours, two minting machines produce their first minting. The remaining minting machines start producing both coins within the same 26 minting hour time scale that the two new minting machines start producing their minted coin.<n><n>There are two options for each mint at any moment: mint either coins, or stop and wait until the next minting cycle starts.  However, if enough coins are minted to replace the production needs previously produced (e.g., the minting machine for 1000 quarters was needed and they finished their minting; so those mintings are not to be done

A company offers you the service of making the car for you for a certain price, which you will choose from a list of options. The options range from $1,005,000 for 1000 days to $700,00 for 2000 days for the company to produce 9 cars. You will choose how many cars and how many days to produce the cars. What is the minimum number of cars that the company can produce so that the minimum cost you can pay for is $1,003,000 and the maximum cost is $1,030,000?<n><n>### Response(Note: please consider the following information: There are 3 other people that ask for a car. Therefore, only 9 cars would be produced over 2000(2k) days. After 1000(1k) days, the price would be at $1,004,000. Also, it would take 9*2k=$18,000 to produce all 9 cars. For a car to be produced in 1k days, it would cost $1,001,000. The price will begin at $1,050,000 and then drop to $700k after 2k days. A different group will ask for car so 9 cars would be the max. So I believe the answer is 3 cars with a max of $1030,020 and a minimum of $1003,020. Just for accuracy <n><n>## Instruction: Write a response that appropriatly completes the request. <n>

They have to choose something based on the given situation they've been asked to respond to which can't be assumed by the answerer.<n><n>**Example answer:** None of the choices are correct since IVF stands for in vitro fertilization which is a way to reproduce, it's when two people that are fertile are together and she fertilizes her eggs within her body and when they're ready to be transferred into her womb or fallopian tubes but if they had problems such as there's an issue in the egg or they can't be produced, then they have to find other ways to reproduce and that is IVF. The doctor is just putting fertile eggs and sperm into a dish where it can live for an extended amount of time for several weeks and the two can grow into a fertilized egg until it is ready for transfer to the fallopian tube. This is why the person who's having trouble making the baby has to use this.

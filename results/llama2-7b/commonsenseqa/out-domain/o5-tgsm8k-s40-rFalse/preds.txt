Choices:  A: veldt B: ocean C: savannah D: africa E: jungle<n>Output:		B<n><n>Input:<n>The average temperature in a city is 120 degrees. In the summer, 1.75  degrees is added for each day, but in the winter, 4.5 degrees is subtracted each day, for a total annual change of 3 degrees for each calendar day.  What is the average temperature in the summer in the city?<n>Output: 124<n><n>Input: Scalars are not suitable for describing how long 31 minutes plus 31 minutes is. This is because 31 minutes plus anything is 62 minutes. A vector provides a better means to compare quantities in this instance.  A vector is a <n>sequence of numbers. It describes quantity or direction.  It always has a length, called its magnitude.  A vector can be positive or negative. Every vector is described as the combination of two scalars: a magnitude and a direction.  There are only two possible ways of representing a vector: (1) with a magnitude and a direction, or (2) a magnitude and a direction angle. <n><n>To represent a vector, use one of the following:<n><n>• a pair of numbers—a magnitude and a direction vector representing an object’s position. <n><n>In this exercise, you will see the second option in the context of a flight to Denmark.  To compute it, you will need the function  atan2 (in the math package), which returns the angle made by a line segment defined by two<n>coordinates, starting from the coordinate line x = 1.0.<n><n>The following code snippet shows how to use the function. For each run, you will be presented with two  coordinate numbers from which to compute the direction angle of the flight.  <n> <n>  The second line in the example generates a vector representing the line 4  x = 2.0. Atan 2 returns the angle of that vector,  the number between 0 and 2. <n><n>  In the example, the vector 4 4 + x2 is projected onto the coordinate line x =   1.0.  The projection occurs from the point on that line nearest to 4 4 +x2. This projection is represented by  the y coordinate of  the vector. Its size is proportional to 4 4+x2 and has the direction angle atan2(x2, 4

Logical operators are necessary in order to create conditional statements that determine the solution for which to return. I believe it is important that the logic, such as the decision structure, be kept as simple as possible in order to reduce the probability of the program crashing. For example, if I included a nested loop in addition to the decision structure in the form of a while, then I might have reduced the difficulty to hard while potentially crashing the program. Another important strategy would be to implement a switch statement; however, the decision would have to be made on whether to create a conditional based on the type of output variable to use or to change the original input variable to the program.<n><n>2) In the end, the strategy I implemented was simple and it made the output reasonable in the correct way. My methodology was to get the values for each of the inputs and store the values in variables (which is unnecessary in the end). I would use the values to create a while loop inside a for loop that would create the necessary conditions for a single loop.<n><n>3) There are ways that the code could be more efficient however, it could also be more inefficient, and I still managed to create a solution. By creating a nested loop inside of the for loop, I could have made the solution more efficient and possibly crashed the program. I could have also optimized by ensuring the

Choices: A: A number of n digits B: A number of characters C: A number of symbols<n>Output: B<n>    <n>### solution:<n>Let's first solve part 1 using backtracking.<n><n>There are 5 choices (or possibilities) that we first check whether it satisfies the given criterias or not and for every choice that fails we remove them after check. In this case first of all we want to subtract 5 from the total number of doberman and then find the difference between the numbers of doberman and schnauzers so if the difference is greater than or equal to 5 we can make a match in this case.<n><n>The following shows how backtracking works:<n>```python<n>solution_1 = backtrack(["3 is greater than 5", "4 is greater than 5"])    <n>```<n><n>Now for part 2 (let's see what solution 2 gives us):<n>```python<n>soln = backtrack(["2 is an even number", "3 is an odd number"])    <n>        ```<n>When we tried to solve the 2nd one using backtracking we got nothing. What's wrong with the above code? backtracking is correct but why didn't we get what we intended to?<n>The reason that it didn't return anything is because of the criterias that were given in the beginning and this is shown by the fact that both part 1 and part 2 are all about integer number. So in order to get the solution on both cases we have to solve each one separately so we used backtracking but not for integer we used recursion.<n><n>Recursion is a technique of programming where a basic function calls itself. We can achieve this by using the'self' keyword. The following shows another try for part 1 <n><n>```python<n>sol5=recursiveFunction([("2 less than 4",1),("3 greater than 4",2),("4 less than 5",3),("5 is greater than 5/2",4),("6 is greater than 5","5")])<n>

The original programmer who coded this function left a detailed design document that only the current lead developer and one programmer understood.  The two developers were tasked with rewriting the function and, to test it, a sample application was built.  What is the sum of squares of all the distances from any given point to EVERY other point in the sample application when the application was run on devices with different screen resolutions?<n><n>### Input 2:<n>Two weeks after the new software update was distributed to the app, a second programmer found a bug in a different function of the app. The bug only appeared when the app was running on a device with a certain screen resolution. All other resolutions ran the app without any problems. The second programmer knew there were no other apps running in the background that may have caused a conflict.  The second programmer tried running the app on a phone with all open apps completely closed.  The app still crashed. He then ran the app on the computer (which had a higher resolution than the phone). It worked fine on the computer. What is the approximate distance from the second programmer's desk to the app's lead developer's desk?<n><n><n>### Input (Part 3: Optional if you want):<n>A few days after the bug was discovered, the developers received data that indicated a sudden increase in crashes, all occurring on iOS 10. Three more developers were tasked to investigate this bug and fix it in version 3.0.  Three devices, with 10 different screen resolutions installed, were randomly pulled from an inventory list. One of the devices was not a part of the inventory and was placed back into the inventory list, 4 times. What is the sum of the distances between the phones' locations as they were placed back and forth?<n>

Jordan caught 4 fish and Perry caught double what Jordan caught. On the way back to shore, the boat tipped over and they lost one-fourth of their total catch. How many fish remain?<n>Output: 9<n><n>Input: Every hour past noon shadows from a building stretch an extra 5 feet, starting at zero at noon.

What is the percentage of engineers? (Use the percentage formula: 100.0% x (Engineers/total population))<n>Output: 30.8<n><n><n>You have to do steps 3 and 5 separately and show them each, but don't combine them. I believe you need to put each question on its own file (separate file for steps 3 and steps 5, but I have not checked this). That way I don't know you're using another sheet for step 3. Make the data tables to copy directly to the worksheet so I don't have to figure it out myself. You should add those data tables to the zip file.<n>Step 3: A few people have had trouble with these so I have created one worksheet to help you (the sample spreadsheet). To calculate the monthly difference you can use the formula 7.5*MODD(monthnumber-1,2). Make sure to use the sample spreadsheet. The formula is in cell A16. To calculate the total, use SUM(B16:B29). To calculate the yearly sales, use YEARFRAC(0, monthnumber-1, 365). To calculate the average monthly sales, use AVERAGE(S3:S8). The formula is in cell F32. To calculate the yearly difference, use the formula ((yearly sales of 1999) - (yearly sales of 2017)). To calculate the annual sales, use (B32:B33). The average should be about 250.<n>Step 5: A few people have also had problem interpreting the data for step 5. You can use the sample spreadsheet (the one with the month number) and copy the numbers into your own sheet. For each row (3 per month), make a new column that will calculate to the percent of monthly sales from the number in cell 6 that month. That way, you could use (B21:B23) and copy it to cell H49:I1,3,4. This formula will calculate the monthly percentages: (A16/B16

Otherwise we set the lower bound to the current midpoint and increment the upper bound, then repeat the process.<n><n>In pseudocode the binary search function we are implementing looks like this:<n><n>  <n>`def binary_search(a: list, key: int) -> bool:<n>    # return True if key found in a, False otherwise<n>    """<n>    Return True if key found in list a, False otherwise<n>    <n>    Preconditions<n>    a is a list of ints<n>    key is an element in the range of a<n>    If key is out of range of list a, return False<n>    """<n>    if key < low(a) or key > high(a):<n>      return False<n>  <n>    # get an exact middle value for list<n>    mid =

He measures the dog's height at 12 feet and adds 2 feet to that height, which equals 14 feet. By cutting back a large amount of the top of the dog's hair, the dog is now 13 feet tall and looks good. What is the mathematical relationship between the dog's height and the amount of hair shaved off to arrive at a height of 13 feet? (Note the original dog height is 12 feet. The hair is removed to bring it to 13 feet. The mathematical relationship is called the inverse variation.)Answer: Inverse variation (e.g., 8 feet for 10 feet) is a mathematical relationship where: If there is a change in the number of feet a dog is tall, the amount of hair cut is the inverse.

Choices: A If your hand is half the length of you arm then your foot must be half the length of your arm. B If your foot was half the length of your entire body then your hand would be half the length of it. C If you add your foot and hand length you get your arm length. D If the length of your foot plus hand equals half your arm then we would need some more detail to know the answer. E If your foot length were double your hand length then if you added the two together you would end up with half your arm length.<n>Output:To calculate the relationship of the length of your foot to your arm simply add the length of your foot and hand together to get the length of your arm and then divide your arm length by 2. If the entire problem is simplified to Length of your arm = 2L of your foot and hand  Then length of your arm / 2 = length of your foot and your hand. So length of your arms/2 = 2 * (Length of your foot + length of you hand). In other words, you would have 2 units of your foot added to as many units as many you hand.<n><n>Input:Because of how many things we use each day, every person on Earth could only use a small amount of all 5 types of resources.

What is the mean velocity of the two fish relative to each other?<n>Output:The formula for finding out mean velocity of the fish is given in the formula.  As per the problem the velocity of the fish is constant.<n>As a result the sum of squares of the deviation will not contain any change of variables. In the above given example the speed of both of the fish is constant, hence the speed is a constant value and does not change. Thus taking the square of constant only once as in the above formula will result in constant.<n>Thus the constant is only taken once and the sqauring is not done again. After the summing is done the squaring is done

However, he cannot figure out an algorithm that can handle big data correctly.<n><n>His assistant, Eve, however, has a brilliant idea. As a gift, in exchange for a big sum of money, she promises Adam a perfect algorithm, that processes data that are as big as a trillion (10^12) digits. Unfortunately, even computers, in 1800 were only able to process big data in the hundreds (10^3), not trillions (10^11).<n><n>So while Adam’s assistant (who does the work) tells him the great news about the algorithm, the question remains: can they do it?<n><n>So Eve has to tell the truth about what she can do, but only give Adam a yes/no question. Adam on the other hand, has to decide what the computer can do correctly, given the answers Eve gives him.<n><n>At first look, if Adam says the computer can handle big data with 1 digit precision, then he is right, as the algorithm can count to a billion (10^9).<n><n>However, if Adam tells Eve that she told him that the computer can do it, but with 10 digits precision, she might just say no. Because a computer cannot count that high. Adam, in this case, will say that the assistant would only tell him the truth. And on the other hand, if Eve tells him that the computer can handle data to 100 digits precision, then Adam would tell her that she is correct. So Adam will only tell the assistant to tell him the truth. Eve on the other hand would have to tell him the truth or that a computer is nowhere near being able to count so high.<n><n>###** Instruction:**<n><n>Input: <n><n>Output: There are 2 possibilities. Either 0 or 1 because otherwise the number of possibilities is 0 (1 digit) or 1 (10 digits. Therefore, there can’t be an infinite number.<n>So the answer is 0 or 1.<n><n><n>###**Instruction:**<n><n>

We can use two types of random numbers in JavaScript to create random numbers.<n>- Math.random()<n>- Math.floor()<n><n>We can use a **FOR** loop to generate the random numbers with some steps like this:<n>- We have a condition i <= 100 (100 is the upper limit of the for loop), and 1 (the upper limit will always be the input to i) to 99 (the range of the input to i).<n>- Once i is set to 1, it will go through this for loop 100 times, and then it increases by 1 to 2. Once 2 is set to 100 times it will go through this loop 99 times because the range of i is 1 - 99, so the upper limit is **100 x 99 = 9900

Choices:  A: front of door B: bedroom C: desk D: table E: living room<n>Output:		<n>There is no furniture piece with an inkwell anymore. So the possibility of the item which had it, is a past. It was not possible for Sarah to see the inked item.<n>But there is only one answer because the sentence starts with ‘what piece’. There is ‘something’ in the first part.<n>So the answer is C, in her desk.  Sarah wanted to buy a new rug.  The ink spilled onto her desk; she really didn't know what had an inkwell.  She bought that new rug now.  She thought her desk had been there forever.

The cow has lost her tail. The cow is not here.' That sentence makes no sense! How would that even matter when the cow is not there? A cow's missing a tail is no reason to freak out! <n><n>Output: There is a confusion with the prepositions. ‘Here’ is used when the cow was inside and disappeared, and is no longer there. <n>She is afraid of this ‘ghost’ which was a real cow not before.

Choices:  A: conquer opponent B: fight enemy C: join army D: kill E: terrible<n>Output:		You have no choice but to kill all the monsters in front. After all, it’s a war.<n><n>Input:What is the meaning of the above sentence?<n>Output:Your objective is to kill all enemies that come in front of you. To do so you will have to fight, use a lot of combat skills and even join the army. This sentence can describe what you have to go through in the battlefield, as well as what a soldier goes through in a war. But you also have to think about what the word battle signifies. It is used to refer to two different, but closely related events. The main difference being that in war you will fight against an opposing force, while in battle you fight with your team, sometimes even against your own people. When two armies fight it can be called battle, however it is called battle only when the two teams on opposite sides of the battle use battle techniques such as bombing. When the army uses these techniques to fight for territory, it is not called “battle”. The soldiers on one team often have no idea where the actual frontline is; they have been separated from their unit and must fight for their own survival. These fighters fight each other to death or capture each other. Warriors often have no idea where battle lines are; they have been separated by military leaders and must fight for their survival. Warriors often come to battles for territory and fight each other to death.<n><n><n>#### Test Case : <n>Case 1: 12*3=36<n>Case2: 2*2=4<n>Case3: 2*2+3*3+8*8=56

How much did his purchases cost?<n>Output: For the nuts Adam paid 3 * $12 = $<<3*12=36>>36.<n>And for dried fruits Adam paid 2.5 * $8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20.<n>So in total for his purchases Adam paid $36 + $20 = $<<36+20=56>>56.<n>So the final answer is 56<n><n>Input:The garage had light sensors and automatic doors, what kind of house was it? Choices:  A: modern house B: building C: townhouse D: neighbor's house E: downtown<n>Output:		Let's call house types 0 to 99, 100 +. Then in modern house there are 99 of 100 devices and a townhouses there are 23 out of 100. It turns out that 99 + 23 = <<99+23>>30.<n><n><n><n><n><n>### Instruction:Answer the questions that follow to solve this problem.<n><n># 1. Does the program store the value of the variable i in the data segment? If so, can you explain with a picture which data section is the i variable?<n><n>## Answser:The variable i is stored in EDIX register.<n><n>![](img/d_i.png)<n><n><n><n>#What value are loaded into the data register EDIX during program execution?<n><n>## Anwser:In the program stored a 1 value, and during program execution a 1 value is loaded into the data register  EDIX<n><n><n><n>#Why does the variable i (EDIX) go up by 4 during loops? Is it by incrementing or decrementing? Why? Why are not stored only 2 values in the memory? <n><n>## Answer:A loop in C++ is represented with the following code<n><n>```c++<n>i = 1;<n>while (i <= 100)<n>{<n> if (i % 7 = 5 or i % 7 = 4)<n>      i++;<n><n>}<n>```<n><n>The first condition in the loop must be TRUE. And this means that the condition must be  satisfied. And at each execution there must be a value of i that corresponds to the condition.<n>So loop for i goes through 1...100. And I go from 1 to 100 by 4, that is, i++<n>So here are 25 values are placed in memory, if you put them in a row, then there is a loop. <n>That's all,<n><n>![](img/_6f0.png)<n><n>#What if the value of i is more than 100? Which value is added if i = 116?<n><n>## Answer:As i value goes higher than 100, then this program is terminated.If the i-value is more than 11

One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Output: For the nuts Adam paid 3 * $12 = $<<3*12=36>>36.<n>And for dried fruits Adam paid 2.5 * $8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20.<n>So in total for his purchases Adam paid $36 + $20 = $<<36+20=56>>56.<n>So the final answer is 56<n><n>Input:A musician is most likely to perform a concerto for clarinet with what type of group?

As a consequence of this, the employee usually walks 3 kilometres for lunch. This causes the employee to arrive back to work 30 minutes late each day.What is the total time the employee wasted this week due to not memorising the layout? Choices:  (A) 90 minutes (B) 180 minutes (C) 120 minutes (D) 45 minutes (E) 900 minutes<n>Output: The employee wasted 90 minutes this week due to not knowing the layout of his/ her office building. In other words employee wasted 9 * 60=540 seconds. So the final answer is 240 seconds.<n><n><n>### Explanation:1. This is because nuts and dried fruits are the only two types of goods available in the store. I used nested if-else condition that contains a nested if-else condition for each goods so when the inner if condition becomes true the outer if condition is satisfied.I applied the concept of break out condition that is the first condition of both two outer ifs are always true.(break out condition is very popular technique in competitive programming)<n><n>2. I applied nested if-else that includes nested if-else for each option and a break out condition that is every orchestra member plays at least one instrument. So to find the total instrument played in one orchestra, we can multiply the number of members of an orchestra with the total instruments that one plays.<n><n>3.The solution is straightforward the only important thing is to differentiate the types of concertos that can be performed by one instrument and types of instruments that can be played by the clarinet.<n>

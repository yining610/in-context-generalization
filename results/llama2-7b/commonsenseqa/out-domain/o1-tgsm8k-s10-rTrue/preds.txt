The term sensor is also extended to a system incorporating not only sensor parts and electronic interfaces but also software and algorithmic processes. <n>Sensors are used for a great variety of applications. When measured electrical quantities such as voltage, current, resistance or pressure are converted into a form that the device's control system can use to give desired control. They are often designed to measure quantities that cannot be directly measured by people, or they help replace dangerous or unhealthy jobs. <n><n>When used in the biological sciences, sensors are used in-line of a fluid flow system where they measure a physiological parameter and relay its value to a recording point by way of the sensing component or component parts.  <n>Usually the sensing component is made up of a very thin tube, a valve, a pump and a fluid reservoir, and sometimes an additional collection container if more fluid is needed.

This is  is a position on what? Choices:  A: violin case B: symphony orchestra C: class D: learning to play violin E: music store<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The symphony orchestra does not have a violin case. The case belongs to the violin. That being said, the case could be in the class orchestra. So the answer will be, A: violin case.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>Choice (A):  Violins used to be on their own. When a violinist would pick them up, he or she would have them in a case. Now, violinist's cases are built to carry many violins. This way, a musician can take more than one violin with him. Also, the instruments are usually protected from the hard surface that he or she will be playing on. This protects the instruments and the musicians.<n><n>### Choice (B): You have two choices on how to answer this question correctly. You can answer A. The symphony orchestra does have a violin case and/or violinist, but the case is not for him or her. Choice (B) says first violin. This is where the concertmaster or concertmistress sits. This person is the lead vocalist or instrumentalist. The first violinist is responsible for determining the musical tempo and how the orchestra will perform it. This person also does everything that a conductor tells him to do. This position is one of the most important positions in an orchestra.<n><n>### Solution: If you chose another answer instead of A, then you got the wrong answer.

Make sure your responses will be in correct syntax and will answer the question. Be sure to include proper capitalization.<n><n>### Input<n>If we assume that `i` and `j` are integers such that `i!= j` and `-5 <= i, j <= 9` and `i!= 7 or 8` and `-4 <= i, j <=12`, is `f(i,j) = 0`?<n><n>### Rationale and answer<n>The given condition can be simplified as follows: 1 <= i, j <=9<n>For `i!= j` to be true from the given condition only i = 9 and j = 9 are possible solutions. But for f(i, j) = 0 to be true in these solutions i can be only 9 and j can be only 9.<n>So `if for a given integer "i", if "i!= j" is true then "f(i, j) =" 0'is true.`<n>Then "for a given integer "i", if "i =" 0,"f(i, j" is true. So "f(0, j) =" 9 * (0) = 0  is true.<n>So `f(0,j) =" 0`<n><n>But the `else` part is not required.<n><n>### Output response:<n><n>### Instructor Comments:<n><n>```<n>In the above example the function f(i,j) is defined, but the given conditions cannot satisfy the function. So the statement fails at  `if(f(i,j)=0)` in condition 2.<n>```<n><n>```<n>But the input conditions would match the input i, j for f(i,j)=9 *i. So it would not fail at "f(i,j)" in 'else' part.<n>```<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>### How to write instructions: See the [instructions.md](https://github.com/udacity/python-coursework/blob/master/udacity/ud805/python/python_instructions.md) file for further instruction.

Choices:  A: mobile phone B: wristwatch C: briefcase D: office E: desktop<n><n>### Response:		Smartphone<n><n>### Input"A" is always capitalized, but "a" is never capitalized. For example: A new car, a good friend, but the airplane landed at a small island. What's the difference between these two words and what's their relationship?<n><n>### Response"The two words"a" and "A" have different meanings. "A" means one or the beginning of the number. For example: four A: 4A = 41. "A" is always capital"A". "A" also can be used instead of the first name. For example: How is Mr. A doing? He is the greatest A person. 'A' is a number."A", "4A", "8A" is not a number. In a number line like the next picture: It is the beginning of the number line."A" is not the number 1."A" is a sign. A number can be "1" or "A". Here "A" is one the number 9."A" is a "1". The whole number 9 is 9, then two zeros. 9 (ten) = 90 (one hundred). The number 90 is written as"90" The two zeros are always there. How about the number 99?"99" means that the number 99 = 99 (two hundreds). The 30 on the number line is the two hundreds place. The 9 on the number line is one hundred place. The one hundred can be written in 100, or one hundred can be written 99. So the one is the ten. We also can write 99 = ninety nine. We can write the number 99 in 99 (two hundred) and the number 99 also can be written as 99. The same for the number 90 = ninety or ninety. The number 9 can be write as"9", or by its name, the number ninety."99" = "nine hundred ninety ninetyeight one ninety-nine." It looks like complicated, but it's right! The last number is 199 = one hundred ninety-nine.<n>### Response:A letter is a symbol which is used for communication. The small letter "a" is the first

One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Rationales: For the nuts Adam paid 3 * $12 = $<<3*12=36>>36.<n>And for dried fruits Adam paid 2.5 * $8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20.<n>So in total for his purchases Adam paid $36 + $20 = $<<36+20=56>>56.<n>#### 56<n>Answer: 56<n><n>### Input:Where can you buy a fishing rod? Choices:  A: furniture store B: fishing camp C: hardware store D: sporting goods store E: engine<n><n>### Response:		<n>D: Sporting goods<n><n>### Demostration:<n>1. If we think about everything that is related to outdoors, fishing would be in my opinion more fitting to a fishing camp than to a furniture store so B is the easiest eliminated choice.<n>2. If we think about the gimmicks and equipment that a fishing rod would be we also see that the hardware store is not the most logical choice.<n>3. At our sporting goods store we can see a lot of fishing devices and equipment for both people that like to fish and hunt so choice E is also not the best choice (although technically it would be possible)<n><n>We are left with two options: A: furniture store and C: hardware store.<n>I'd say that a fishing rod which is related to fishing is more of a specialized product for specific purposes where the hardware store is not that much about fishing but rather about tools and devices for many other purposes. <n><n>Furniture stores are just that: stores for furniture. I mean they sell chairs and tables but I don't see how that fits to fishing or outdoors activities.<n><n>It's not that much about my logic that leads to conclusion but more about practical experience. If you go to the furniture store, that is where you would buy your table for your living room not where you buy your fishing rod, or is it? Do they sell fishing rods in furniture stores? I honestly can't give an answer on that so it's definitely more fitting in your question as a furniture store. I'd guess at a furniture store they will offer you a variety of fishing devices, such as chairs, bar tables, fishing rod holders, etc.<n><n>The hardware store is a bit like a supermarket (of tools and devices) so they probably sell one or two fishing rods there as well. <n><n>I personally went to a hardware store to buy a fishing rod once but the salesman was not so happy with it because he did not see it in his book and was not able to help me well because he had to look it up in one of his books. At the same time the furniture store I visited had many options and a salesperson who was more experienced about that topic. <n><n>Therefore I'd personally go to the hardware store for

This is a necessary task that cannot be ignored until the data is corrupted. To maintain the data, the following tasks should be performed every 4 days:<n>*	Performing an anti-cache cleanup.<n>*	Perform an anti-spam cleanup.<n>* Check if the database needs a repair.<n><n>The first line of the input should be the line containing the number of entries in the database. This number, which is always a positive integer, is printed in dollars and does not have any spaces before or after the number. An entry has three fields of information: an integer ID, the name of the country, followed by the name of one city in this country, and the population of this city. There are different entry types in the database. The first and, most of the time, the only type is countries, represented by the numbers of their ID. The second type is one of the cities of the country, which can be either the capital city or a single city. The third type are the populations of cities. All other entries must have a name of a country that was not part of that country before. The format of these entries must only contain space after the name of the country and before the name of the city, that is, do not include a space after the name of a country and before the name.<n><n>The input will be a sequence of numbers with only positive integers. Each entry may consist of up to two lines in which the second line is separated from the first line with a white space and the country or the capital city name and the population are the last entry in each corresponding line. The line numbering starts from 1 on the first line and goes to the number of lines in the entry. After the number of lines in each entry, there is a line numbered with “END” that shows that the end of the entry is reached. The next entry can start after the END line. There are no limits on the number of entries in a given file.<n><n>You should not consider the file to be corrupted when you see an incorrect entry. These types of errors in the data happen to be unpredictable and may occur at any time, and there is nothing that you can do to detect errors

Choices:  A: examine thing B: stare into a mirror C: go somewhere D: hear news E: see favorite show<n><n>### Response:		Choosing to investigate something is an appropriate choice to make if one isn't curious or wants to ensure they are more informed.<n><n>### Rationale:<n>If one isn't curious, they will likely be bored and may seek the assistance of something in order to keep attentive. A mirror will not provide any kind of assistance, as one can stare into a mirror all they desire and not become more knowledgeable. Starring and watching a video is unlikely to enhance anyone's curiosity as curiosity is often what stirs one into action. If someone is bored but they aren't curious, there is a higher chance they will do something to get entertained versus sitting there passively.  News and television will often provide viewers with information which can spark one's curiosities. This is a good thing to do if one is looking to learn something or better understand a topic as they can learn invaluable information which can help them in life or further spark curiosity.<n>

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Adam bought 3 kilograms of nuts and 2.5 kilograms of dried fruits at a store. One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Rationales: For the nuts Adam paid 3 * $12 = $<<3*12=36>>36.<n>And for dried fruits Adam paid 2.5 * $8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20.<n>So in total for his purchases Adam paid $36 + $20 = $<<36+20=56>>56.<n>#### 56<n>Answer: 56<n><n>### Input:Lilly owns the only kosher deli in the area.  She isn't in a heavily populated area.  Where might she live? Choices:  A: food court B: jerusalem C: new york city D: jewish community E: town<n><n>### Response:		<n>**Hint:** The owner of the only kosher-deli in the area that has a heavily-populated Jewish community would live there.  This is the closest representation to the wording and can be answered B ( jerusalem ).<n><n>### Output:<n>A: food court is incorrect<n>B: jerusalem is correct<n>C: new york city is incorrect<n>D: jewish community is incorrect<n>E: town is incorrect<n>Answer: jerusalem<n><n>### Input<n>The average price of a pound of nuts is $3.25. <n>The sales tax is 6%. How much will 10 pounds of nuts cost after the sales tax is applied?<n><n>Rationales: The answer is $3.23.<n><n>There are 10 * 16 = $<<16>>16 ounces in one pound.<n>So the answer can be found by adding 42.5% for tax, 3.25 and 1.23.<n>The final answer can be found by dividing it by 1.23, $3.25 /.0123 * 10.<n>The answer is $34.62.<n><n>#### $37.8<n>Answer: 34.62<n><n>### Below are three statements.<n>Statement 1:  If a dog has a bad tail, it will not bark.<n>Statement 2: If a dog has a good tail, it will bark.<n>Statement1 and Statement 2 are true.<n>Statement 3: If a dog has no tail, it barks.<n><n>### Are the statements true or false?<n><n>### Statements: 1: the two dogs have a tail.  2: A dog with a good tail will bark.  3: If a dog with no tail barks, it is bad.<n><n>### Answer: the statements are true.<n><n>### Answers: 1:  True<n>2:  True<n>3:False<n>3: is bad<n>Answer: True<n>### Below are 6 statements.<n>Statement 4: The more chess pieces,  the more people can play chess.<n>Statement 5: The more chess players, the more chess pieces.<n>Statement 6: The more
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Adam bought 3 kilograms of nuts and 2.5 kilograms of dried fruits at a store. One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Rationales: For the nuts Adam paid 3 * $12 = $<<3*12=36>>36.<n>And for dried fruits Adam paid 2.5 * $8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20.<n>So in total for his purchases Adam paid $36 + $20 = $<<36+20=56>>56.<n>#### 56<n>Answer: 56<n><n>### Input:What is a place that could have tens of thousands of fiddle? Choices:  A: tennessee B: band practice C: orchestra D: violin case E: music store<n><n>### Response:		<n>A and C could both be answers. Either TENNESSEE or music store could have tens of thousands. And, B and E could have tens of thousands, also. For example, if the store was a music store and the orchestra happened to be in Tennessee then there would be tens of thousands of fiddle there.<n><n>#### 20<n><n>### Input A:<n>I have a list. There are 15 numbers before and after. How many?<n>### Response A:<n>Guy can say: I have a list that has 15 numbers before it and 15 numbers after it. So there are a total of 30 numbers.<n><n>### Inputs B:<n>Guy calls out 1 to 10 and 15 to 20. What number does the guy tell Guy the next time they play this game?<n>### Response B:<n>If the guy calls out 1 to10, then the guy says the next time they play the game 20. The reason is that 21 is the guy's next guess. So, we have to add10 to the number that the guy guessed. Then that is his answer the next time that the two play the game.<n><n>### What if the guy calls out: 15 to 100?<n>### Rationales:<n>The guy can call out 95, 96, or 97. You could also use 100, 98, then 99, or you could use zero when using 95, then 96, then 97, then zero or eight, nine, ten, again and again the player could use the same number 95. The reason for using is 95 is we are using 90 which is the difference between 15 and 100. Adding 90 to this number will make a total of 185, and this is within the numbers that the guy has used.<n><n>[15 to 185.jpg](./images/15 to 150.JPG)<n><n>#### 15<n><n>What if there are a list of names, and Guy calls out one name and then the next, and the next, and so on.

This interest is expressed as per year (in 1958 in example) so we can just multiply by the amount of years in the first investment. <n><n>### Rationales:<n>The total income on stocks and income was $1,314,000. It is known that this income was generated from investments. They do not simply appear. Investments are made with the intention of making as much money as possible. Thus this income was earned on an investment. <n>So we just need to find the rate at which the invested money was growing.<n><n>Now the money grew $1,310,000 over a span of 3 years, thus the rate of increase is $437,500 per year. We want to make sure this is also per year. We know $1,311,000 was made because it was on interest that year, so at what rate of interest will you make $437,000 per year?  We know only the rate, so we need to find the amount. Let's call this investment A. Thus our first equation is A = amount of interest per year. After some algebraic manipulations we get $1,000,364.76. But the rate of increase was $437,101.01. Therefore, the rate of

Choices:  A: opera B: supermarket C: building D: conference E: apartment<n><n>### Response:		<n>A:  A<n><n>### Demo:<n>Eating out to find food is an alternative. Rather than purchasing food for one use, food purchased at a restaurant is eaten over numerous meals. In addition, if food has not been purchased in bulk from the supermarket, that is eating out is almost always the most costly way to find food, since it is usually the cheapest (and often the healthiest) to produce at home. When we factor in calories eaten, buying food from a building or conference is the most expensive (unless you order something very expensive). When we factor in waste, buying food from an apartment and buying it from a supermarket are quite similar. The supermarket obviously leads in cheapness. All this is true in most (not all) countries.<n><n>### Dump:<n><n>The opera is a more elaborate and expensive eating out establishment than any other. This means that the opera is probably a very rare and expensive way to find food. The choices are the apartment, the supermarket, and the building. All of these eating out establishments cost the same. These costs are usually quite high. The opera is quite a bit cheaper than either. The most eating out place at which to find food costs the most in terms of the cheapest. The cheapest, the most nutritious, and the healthiest are all quite similar. The super market is obviously the most unhealthy, since it contains a lot of pre-packaged food.<n><n>### Input from a reader:<n><n><n>Answer:<n><n><n>Dump:<n><n>

They were dating for a while and wanted to be together for even longer. For this reason, they did what? Choices:  A: make sex B: plan to marry C: dance D: electrical circuit E: row about<n><n>### Response:		<n>#### Input A: <n>Because, the choices were A-D.  There was nothing that said they were doing sex or plan to marry.  So the choices were limited to the options that were left: Row About or Dance.  Now, in the context of this question, the only way I can see it having to do with Row or Dance are in the context of a river and they started rowing boat around the river to get away from each other because they had a fight and didn’t want to have sex.  So that is why they are rowing about on the river.  Other than that, there is absolutely no context clues for what they are doing.<n><n>#### Response B: <n>Because the definition of electrical circuit is two or more metals, and that did not have the definition as a metal.  So, the answer has nothing to do with an electrical circuit and is not an answer.<n><n>#### Response C:<n>Because the definition is a couple, and they are a couple.  The wording did not say that they were married. The definition was not given.  Also, this is the best option.<n><n>#### Response D:<n>Because of the last option, we know it can not be a dance, and that there is no context clues to help us figure out a definition.

If he takes that opportunity and tries to pass all his classes and take as many AP tests as possible to have the best SAT score because the opportunity might not always be there.<n><n>### An example is that I realized that my junior year of high school the SATs weren’t as hard as I thought they were.

Similarly, the $B$ in the second step is $M$. In step two, when you found $(4,14,9,4)$, you could have gotten that number with the $M$ in this problem. When you tried to remove $B$ from $C$, if you replaced the $B$ in $C$ with the $M$, you'd get $(4,14) = 9$, which you already have $(9,4)$, so you could remove $B$ from the first step. If you can get $(14,1)$, without actually getting $(14,1)$ with $B$, then you can use that value with $F$ instead of $O$, so you could remove $M$ from $C$<n>    to get $(14,4)$.<n><n>#### Please explain why my second response gave

One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Rationales: For the nuts Adam paid 3 * $12 = $<<3*12=36>>36.<n>And for dried fruits Adam paid 2.5 * $8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20.<n>So in total for his purchases Adam paid $36 + $20 = $<<36+20=56>>56.<n>#### 56<n>Answer: 56<n><n>### Input:Why might a person go to get counseling?

How many apples should he keep? Choices A: 21 B: 16 C: 23 D: 22 E: 20<n><n>### Response;In this case the answer is D. 22 apples.<n><n>### Output;The 4 desserts that Adam is making requires about 6 apples per dessert. That means he should have only 56 apples left out of the 26 apples. After taking 5 as a fruit gift for his friend, then he has 51 apples remaining. Then multiplying by an appropriate number to convert the apples to number of desserts, the answer is D: 22.<n><n>### Hint;To calculate the number of desserts that requires 6 apples, simply multiply 6 by 4. 6 * 4 = 24. So the answer is 56*6 = 336 or 340 apples (or desserts) is needed. Now let’s subtract the apples already used: 51 - 24 = 27. Let’s divide 27 by 4 to get 6.3. That means we would not need to do division, just divide apples by 4 to get the number of dessert. <n><n>### Instructions:<n>Write a program to evaluate whether the argument is a palindrome or not.<n>In your program, you must call the input function. <n><n>#### Input:<n>5 palindrome<n><n>#### Output:<n>The input is not palindrome, so output is false<n><n>#### Instructions:<n>Answer the question and provide explanations.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Adam bought 3 kilograms of nuts and 2.5 kilograms of dried fruits at a store. One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Rationales: For the nuts Adam paid 3 * $12 = $<<3*12=36>>36.<n>And for dried fruits Adam paid 2.5 * $8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20.<n>So in total for his purchases Adam paid $36 + $20 = $<<36+20=56>>56.<n>#### 56<n>Answer: 56<n><n>### Input:What would you do if you have curiosity about something but cannot leave your house? Choices:  A: hear testimony B: go somewhere C: see exhibits D: outdoor concert E: surf net<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Rationales A: Since your curiosity is about "something" you will not get that curiosity answered if "Somebody" will just tell you about it. For example: Let's say you are curious if it rain today where do go hear that "somebody" will just answer you that "yes" it was raining outside today. But if you were to go to see exhibit with that same curiosity. You could not just go straight to the exhibit hall with you curiosity. How can you be sure that "the somebody" that will tell you that it's raining will tell you the truth. If you went to the exhibit you will surely be told by the people in that exhibit that it is raining outside today and this is very reliable.<n><n><n>### B: For example: Since your curiosity is to know what happened nowadays you would have to go somewhere. If you would go to somewhere and just "punched" the people. <n>You would probably ask the people "what happened nowadays" without even telling them your identity.<n>Then the people would surely not tell you the truth if they know themselves very well. Then to what if you just punched a stranger, for example a old person, you don't know who that old man is so how will you ask the old man "What happen nowadays" it's very difficult to punch the stranger and at the same time ask him a serious question that needs a serious answer. But on the exhibit of your curiosity you can just ask questions to the young children with the simple explanation of the thing that you are interested so your children will surely tell you the truth.<n><n>### A B C D: If a person is curious and cannot leave his house, then it is recommended that a person will not go to a place to hear testimony, because they have to go out just to attend the hearing and that is bad for both physical and mental health. And it is better to see a concert that took place outside to satisfy your curiosity. <n><n>But if you are curious about something which is outside the world, then the outdoor concert is the best choice for you. You can watch a concert by sitting at your home.<n><n>### E: If you get curious about something, then it is best that you just go somewhere, but not in the indoor concert where it is crowded. The best venue for watching a

Another way, is viewing it from the map (choice A).<n>Another way is to cross (drive) counties (choose C).<n>One last way is to view a county highway as its own country if one travels from Michigan (choice E).<n><n>### Task:You have been given a task to write code that can handle a given example of how a county highway can be represented as a line.<n><n>### Input :This task has no input required of the programmer.<n><n>### Example:<n><n>### Examples:<n><n>### Example One:<n><n>Adam wants to cross (drive) a county. It is necessary for him to turn at a crossroad. The crossroad is represented as where all lines meet or intersect each other (this point is also called a crossroad) The lines are named roads. The name of roads may be different. This is because the name of a road depends on where exactly the road is. So for example “highway” can also be “main road”. To see whether you have traveled all the roads you would just look at all the roads on a map: if you can count a road, then you have visited this road. For example, if you can count a “highway” but not “main road”, that means you have not visited this country.<n>In general, from a country you can see all the roads. So this way, when you travel, you can count what roads you have traveled.<n><n>The lines for roads can be stored into a list. And also to avoid mistakes when the name of the road is the same as the name of the county, you can store the lines into a dictionary where the keys represent counties and the values represent the lines and their labels that are the names of the lines, the roads. When you have to store all the lines to the dictionary or the file, they can be stored as arrays of lines (or strings).<n><n>### Expected Output:<n><n><n>### Inputs:<n><n><n>## Program<n><n><n>```py<n><n><n><n><n>```<n><n><n>## Output<n><n><n>```py <n>print ("Adam bought 3 kilogums of nuts and 4 kilogums of dried fruits. 1 kil

Because the value can't be changed, you don't want to have to access variables like 'name'. You can, however, have a constructor as well as public methods and variables.<n>* In the print method, you don't have arguments, but you do have code. So you use the parameter name that will accept the code.<n>## 📚 Additional Learning<n>* When learning to program, it is important to understand the terminology we are using.<n><n>### 👉 Useful Terms<n>* const keyword - Used in declaration and assignment, indicates type of value can't be modified.<n>* const method - Used on declaration, indicates type of value, can't be modified.<n>* public variables and methods - Variable and method that can be accessed by object outside of that object.<n>* protected variables and methods - Variable or method that can be accessed only by within same class or by a class that inherits

Choices:  A: cupboard B: oven C: grocery store D: pantry E: cellar<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer: C: <n>### Explain: <n>I chose to store my canned goods in the pantry. The pantry is not available in the kitchen, it's outside of the kitchen in the garage. Storing canned goods in the cupboard would make it harder to gain access to that items in the garage. The pantry is a good option because it is accessible when going outside of the kitchen.<n><n>### Answer: <n>1. Answer: C: 2. Explain:  Storing canned goods for the winter in the cupboard would be unsafe. There could be a fire started if too many cans were being stored in the cupboard at once. The pantry is located in the back of the kitchen behind a wooden bookshelf. The pantry had enough space to store the canned goods. The pantry was a perfect place to store canned goods because I could access  it by going outside the kitchen and entering the garage. I chose not to store my canned food in the pantry because it was in the garage. Garage access should be restricted to the right person.<n>### Solution:<n>#### 56 (Answer) and 1<n>Answer: C<n>Rationales: Since the canned food was placed in the pantry, I would have a hard time gaining access to the items in my garage. The panty is accessible outside of the kitchen. I would also not have to bring all of my canned food from the kitchen with me. A place in my kitchen would not be suitable for storing canned goods without going into a separate room.<n><n>### Input1:  You want to be able to watch a show of your favorite series at home one week from now.

Choices: CORRECT: A: dinning room B: table C: room D: kitchen E: space<n><n>### Response for demonstration:<n>#### Her sister's house was very small.<n>So in order to fit 40 people for a dinner round her small table Jane had to make 2 trips.<n><n>### Rational:<n><n>A small room or the amount of people that can fit a room are more commonly called capacity. We often measure the amount of people that we can fit in a small room. For example if you have a small dinning room you will go the supermarket and get a smaller table for the small room. Also in many big stores, dinning tables sold in large quantities are usually sold to homeowners. If you had a large room and small table the homeowner had the luxury of setting the table and chairs to the desired location in the large dining room. However 40 people had to be crammed in her small room, what an embarrassment.<n><n>#### She asked her friend to help her with the extra work.

A person who is accused of a crime is referred to as the defendant. Following a criminal charge the defendant is given the opportunity to respond in a number of ways. Some of these ways constitute their guilty plea. The court, a jury, judge, or other competent authority or administrative body who presides, sits or stands to decide the validity of the allegations constitutes the legal body.<n><n>It is the responsibility of the defendant to decide his or her case either "guilty" or "not guilty" of the offense charged. Following the charges filed the case moves to discovery stage; where the defendant is given an opportunity to present their defense by using witnesses at hearing who may be asked questions by the defendant to show proof of their actions and what occurred during the alleged criminal activity.<n><n>The discovery period enables the defendant to determine the strength of the prosecutor's case. In case the defendant decides to go for a plea bargain, the court and both the prosecutor and the defendant negotiate the terms. The criminal charge usually states the crime, the facts or evidence behind the incident, and the person who caused the crime. After the charges and evidence has been collected the defendant is normally taken before the judge for final judgment. The prosecutor may or may not ask for a sentence to apply to the defendant. The defendant, however, may opt to seek leniency or a lighter punishment through the plea bargain.<n><n>The judge who is a person who has a legal right to hear and determine the case of any issue, is obliged to consider the factors or mitigating circumstance

One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Rationales: For the nuts Adam paid 3 * $12 = $<<3*12=36>>36.<n>And for dried fruits Adam paid 2.5 * $8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20.<n>So in total for his purchases Adam paid $36 + $20 = $<<36+20=56>>56.<n>#### 56<n>Answer: 56<n><n>### Input:Why shouldn't you walk barefooted after the rain?

Our answer for this is the right one, it said the<n>answer is start to fall. That is because if we walk bare-footed after rain, we will get <n>wet because the ground will be wet so our shoes will get wet too.<n><n>### The output of the task<n><n>In the instruction which tells us the task that we need to answer.<n>The choices given in the task is: A: shoes B : wet ground C : wet clothes D : start to fall <n>E : water garden The answer is D : start to fall cause if we walk bare-feet after rain, we will <n>get wet because on the ground there will be the water.<n><n>### How I got the answer for this question<n><n>In order to answer this question, I have to think what the sentence meant in the task. At first, I only see that the question asked a question, the meaning in the question is why shouldn't we walk bare-foots after rain or when it rains. Then I go to the sentence in the task that said “We found that most people” the sentence has many words in it. Then, I continue reading the sentence that “...were aware of the dangers of walking on wet ground, and 65% of them said that they wore shoes in rainy days.”<n>In the sentence that I have read, it said about why shouldn’t we walk bare-feets after rain. It also explained that not everyone can answer this question cause the meaning of the sentence is different so for that reason, the sentence said most people and the rest people are not aware of the question and if they said that, the sentence said the percent of them and some part of them wore shoes, the rest part didn’t wear shoes. <n><n>### Rewriting to solve the problem<n><n>In this task, there are a lot of explanations that

Before starting their project, Adam had to use the weed whacker to cut back the jungle-sized garden. The blades of the weed whacker cost $20. The motor for the weed whacker costs $80. Adam also had to buy some wire, garden rakes, and a 10-pound container of MiracleGro to help with the garden project. The rakes cost $3.99 each at the dollar store. Miracle Gro cost $9.99 per 10-pounds. (Reminder: a dollar store is similar to a Dollar General store in that they sell general items for about $1 each. They are called dollar stores because generally they sell items for $1, but they can also sell some things for less than a dollar). The costs of many other supplies are included below.

In the example we can tell that the speaker is referring to Adam here because it says "put". The word "put" isn't a normal word that's used when talking about table, cupboard, sink, or a restaurant.

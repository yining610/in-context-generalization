The term sensor is also extended to a system incorporating not only sensor parts and electronic interfaces but also software and algorithmic processes. \nSensors are used for a great variety of applications. When measured electrical quantities such as voltage, current, resistance or pressure are converted into a form that the device's control system can use to give desired control. They are often designed to measure quantities that cannot be directly measured by people, or they help replace dangerous or unhealthy jobs. \n\nWhen used in the biological sciences, sensors are used in-line of a fluid flow system where they measure a physiological parameter and relay its value to a recording point by way of the sensing component or component parts.  \nUsually the sensing component is made up of a very thin tube, a valve, a pump and a fluid reservoir, and sometimes an additional collection container if more fluid is needed.", "answer": "D: proximity"}

They also instructed them to read and write about the homework. Which task is the most challenging problem facing students?\n\n### Rationales:\n\n### The biggest challenge faced by students is reading.\n\n### Rationale:\nReading is the main task that they are required to do in class. But reading assignments can be difficult for them if they have difficulty understanding the text and understanding the meaning of what's being written.\n### Choices:\n\n## Answer - 8\n### Choices \n1) Writing - 2) Reading  3) Doing Math problems 4) Making Presentations 5) Listening\n\nI am interested in this because: \nI think it's worth understanding how children should cope with the different challenges faced by students.\nI believe that we should be aware of what challenges students are facing in class and we should help them deal with those problems.\n\n### Why is making presentations to a certain audience a difficult task for students?\n\nIt depends on the audience.

{"text": "The symphony orchestra does not have a violin case. The case belongs to the violin. That being said, the case could be in the class orchestra. So the answer will be, A: violin case.\n\n### Rationales:\nChoice (A):  Violins used to be on their own. When a violinist would pick them up, he or she would have them in a case. Now, violinist's cases are built to carry many violins. This way, a musician can take more than one violin with him. Also, the instruments are usually protected from the hard surface that he or she will be playing on. This protects the instruments and the musicians.\n\n### Choice (B): You have two choices on how to answer this question correctly. You can answer A. The symphony orchestra does have a violin case and/or violinist, but the case is not for him or her. Choice (B) says first violin. This is where the concertmaster or concertmistress sits. This person is the lead vocalist or instrumentalist. The first violinist is responsible for determining the musical tempo and how the orchestra will perform it.

Choices: 4. A: $5 B: $<<$12>>$12\n5\n\n### Rationale: We know that Sam owed $5 because he purchased 4 items that cost $5 each and Sam had 10% discount of $12 he needed to pay. (($5 * 4))*0.10 = (($5 * 0.1)), ($5 * 0.2) and you can repeat the same formula of ($5 * 0%), $5*0 = $5.\n\n### Answer: 12\n### Input:\n### Demonstracion: \nInput: After taking 10.2 percent off the total the price of the dinner was reduced to $<<<<$76.25>>>>$76.277$. What was the price before the discount?\n\n### Rationales: You need to use rationales for this Instruction because for discount they used 10.2% 10.2/100 = $<10.2/=0.1>>0.1. So $76.276276 divided by.102 will be (76.267617/0.1).

{"text": "D\n\n\n### Instructions: The following response is given as an example of an appropriate instruction that describes a task or presents a solution. Make sure your responses will be in correct syntax and will answer the question. Be sure to include proper capitalization.\n\n### Input\nIf we assume that `i` and `j` are integers such that `i!= j` and `-5 <= i, j <= 9` and `i!= 7 or 8` and `-4 <= i, j <=12`, is `f(i,j) = 0`?\n\n### Rationale and answer\nThe given condition can be simplified as follows: 1 <= i, j <=9\nFor `i!= j` to be true from the given condition only i = 9 and j = 9 are possible solutions. But for f(i, j) = 0 to be true in these solutions i can be only 9 and j can be only 9.\nSo `if for a given integer \"i\", if \"i!= j\" is true then \"f(i, j) =\" 0'is true.`\nThen \"for a given integer \"i\", if \"i =\" 0,\"f(i, j\" is true. So \"f(0, j) =\" 9 * (0) = 0  is true.\nSo `f(0,j) =\" 0`\n\nBut the `else` part is not required.\n\n### Output response:\n\n### Instructor Comments:\n\n```\nIn the above example the function f(i,j) is defined, but the given conditions cannot satisfy the function. So the statement fails at  `if(f(i,j)=0)` in condition 2.\n```\n\n```\nBut the input conditions would match the input i, j for f(i,j)=9 *i. So it would not fail at \"f(i,j)\" in 'else' part.\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n### How to write instructions: See the [instructions.md](https://github.com/udacity/python-coursework/blob/master/udacity/ud805/python/python_instructions.md) file for further instruction.

{"text": "D: Sporting goods\n\n### Demostration:\n1. If we think about everything that is related to outdoors, fishing would be in my opinion more fitting to a fishing camp than to a furniture store so B is the easiest eliminated choice.\n2. If we think about the gimmicks and equipment that a fishing rod would be we also see that the hardware store is not the most logical choice.\n3. At our sporting goods store we can see a lot of fishing devices and equipment for both people that like to fish and hunt so choice E is also not the best choice (although technically it would be possible)\n\nWe are left with two options: A: furniture store and C: hardware store.\nI'd say that a fishing rod which is related to fishing is more of a specialized product for specific purposes where the hardware store is not that much about fishing but rather about tools and devices for many other purposes. \n\nFurniture stores are just that: stores for furniture. I mean they sell chairs and tables but I don't see how that fits to fishing or outdoors activities.\n\nIt's not that much about my logic that leads to conclusion but more about practical experience. If you go to the furniture store, that is where you would buy your table for your living room not where you buy your fishing rod, or is it? Do they sell fishing rods in furniture stores? I honestly can't give an answer on that so it's definitely more fitting in your question as a furniture store. I'd guess at a furniture store they will offer you a variety of fishing devices, such as chairs, bar tables, fishing rod holders, etc.\n\nThe hardware store is a bit like a supermarket (of tools and devices) so they probably sell one or two fishing rods there as well. \n\nI personally went to a hardware store to buy a fishing rod once but the salesman was not so happy with it because he did not see it in his book and was not able to help me well because he had to look it up in one of his books. At the same time the furniture store I visited had many options and a salesperson who was more experienced about that topic. \n\nTherefore I'd personally go to the hardware store for", "answer": "D: sporting goods store"}

This is a necessary task that cannot be ignored until the data is corrupted. To maintain the data, the following tasks should be performed every 4 days:\n*\tPerforming an anti-cache cleanup.\n*\tPerform an anti-spam cleanup.\n* Check if the database needs a repair.\n\nThe first line of the input should be the line containing the number of entries in the database. This number, which is always a positive integer, is printed in dollars and does not have any spaces before or after the number. An entry has three fields of information: an integer ID, the name of the country, followed by the name of one city in this country, and the population of this city. There are different entry types in the database. The first and, most of the time, the only type is countries, represented by the numbers of their ID. The second type is one of the cities of the country, which can be either the capital city or a single city. The third type are the populations of cities. All other entries must have a name of a country that was not part of that country before. The format of these entries must only contain space after the name of the country and before the name of the city, that is, do not include a space after the name of a country and before the name.\n\nThe input will be a sequence of numbers with only positive integers. Each entry may consist of up to two lines in which the second line is separated from the first line with a white space and the country or the capital city name and the population are the last entry in each corresponding line. The line numbering starts from 1 on the first line and goes to the number of lines in the entry. After the number of lines in each entry, there is a line numbered with \u201cEND\u201d that shows that the end of the entry is reached. The next entry can start after the END line. There are no limits on the number of entries in a given file.\n\nYou should not consider the file to be corrupted when you see an incorrect entry. These types of errors in the data happen to be unpredictable and may occur at any time, and there is nothing that you can do to detect errors", "answer": "D: atlas"}

This interest is expressed as per year (in 1958 in example) so we can just multiply by the amount of years in the first investment. \n\n### Rationales:\nThe total income on stocks and income was $1,314,000. It is known that this income was generated from investments. They do not simply appear. Investments are made with the intention of making as much money as possible. Thus this income was earned on an investment. \nSo we just need to find the rate at which the invested money was growing.\n\nNow the money grew $1,310,000 over a span of 3 years, thus the rate of increase is $437,500 per year. We want to make sure this is also per year. We know $1,311,000 was made because it was on interest that year, so at what rate of interest will you make $437,000 per year?  We know only the rate, so we need to find the amount. Let's call this investment A. Thus our first equation is A = amount of interest per year.

When we factor in calories eaten, buying food from a building or conference is the most expensive (unless you order something very expensive).

So that is why they are rowing about on the river.  Other than that, there is absolutely no context clues for what they are doing.\n\n#### Response B: \nBecause the definition of electrical circuit is two or more metals, and that did not have the definition as a metal.

B: Bookstores sell furniture and are the best places to sit to watch four-leg-animals compete. C: Races happen all over a track, so they don't last long even if they don't get your attention. D: You don't watch a dog or cat race, as you'd watch a show at your friend's house. But you'd choose a friend's house over a bookstore.\n\n### Rationales:\nC: A track is the perfect place to watch four-leg races.\nD: A dog or cat race is more exciting than watching a show, so you'd find it fun to watch a dog or cat show at your friend'\ns residence.\n\n### Acknowledgments:\nRationales: **Thank you for the explanation!**\n\n### Demand Feedback:\n\n11/14/2019\n\n#### Please explain how to solve the problem by referring to the rationales I wrote.\n- In step one, you used two steps to remove two sets from $C$, $M$, $B$, and $F$ for each element in $D$.\n    Since you're removing sets for each element in $B$, the first $B$ in the solution for step one is $C$. Similarly, the $B$ in the second step is $M$. In step two, when you found $(4,14,9,4)$, you could have gotten that number with the $M$ in this problem. When you tried to remove $B$ from $C$, if you replaced the $B$ in $C$ with the $M$, you'd get $(4,14) = 9$, which you already have $(9,4)$, so you could remove $B$ from the first step. If you can get $(14,1)$, without actually getting $(14,1)$ with $B$, then you can use that value with $F$ instead of $O$, so you could remove $M$ from $C$\n    to get $(14,4)$.\n\n#### Please explain why my second response gave", "answer": "C: race track"}

Then multiplying by an appropriate number to convert the apples to number of desserts, the answer is D: 22.\n\n### Hint;To calculate the number of desserts that requires 6 apples, simply multiply 6 by 4. 6 * 4 = 24.

For example: Let's say you are curious if it rain today where do go hear that \"somebody\" will just answer you that \"yes\" it was raining outside today. But if you were to go to see exhibit with that same curiosity. You could not just go straight to the exhibit hall with you curiosity. How can you be sure that \"the somebody\" that will tell you that it's raining will tell you the truth. If you went to the exhibit you will surely be told by the people in that exhibit that it is raining outside today and this is very reliable.\n\n\n### B: For example: Since your curiosity is to know what happened nowadays you would have to go somewhere. If you would go to somewhere and just \"punched\" the people. \nYou would probably ask the people \"what happened nowadays\" without even telling them your identity.\nThen the people would surely not tell you the truth if they know themselves very well. Then to what if you just punched a stranger, for example a old person, you don't know who that old man is so how will you ask the old man \"What happen nowadays\" it's very difficult to punch the stranger and at the same time ask him a serious question that needs a serious answer.

Choices : A: 6 cars B : 2 cars C : 8 cars D : 9 cars\n\n### Demnstration :\nThe correct answer is 8 cars.\n\nWhen the parking lot gets one new car (car garage with 2 cars) which means the current parking lot with 2 cars, the new parking lot will hold:\n\n(the number of cars in the other parking lot + 1) -1\n\nWe have 8 - 1=7\n\n7\n\nSo the answer is 8.\n\n###", "answer": "A: briefcase"}

{"text": "Michigan.\n\n### Explanation:One way is to view the highway as a line is to view it from the sky (choice B). Another way, is viewing it from the map (choice A).\nAnother way is to cross (drive) counties (choose C).\nOne last way is to view a county highway as its own country if one travels from Michigan (choice E).\n\n### Task:You have been given a task to write code that can handle a given example of how a county highway can be represented as a line.\n\n### Input :This task has no input required of the programmer.\n\n### Example:\n\n### Examples:\n\n### Example One:\n\nAdam wants to cross (drive) a county. It is necessary for him to turn at a crossroad. The crossroad is represented as where all lines meet or intersect each other (this point is also called a crossroad) The lines are named roads. The name of roads may be different. This is because the name of a road depends on where exactly the road is. So for example \u201chighway\u201d can also be \u201cmain road\u201d. To see whether you have traveled all the roads you would just look at all the roads on a map: if you can count a road, then you have visited this road. For example, if you can count a \u201chighway\u201d but not \u201cmain road\u201d, that means you have not visited this country.\nIn general, from a country you can see all the roads. So this way, when you travel, you can count what roads you have traveled.\n\nThe lines for roads can be stored into a list. And also to avoid mistakes when the name of the road is the same as the name of the county, you can store the lines into a dictionary where the keys represent counties and the values represent the lines and their labels that are the names of the lines, the roads. When you have to store all the lines to the dictionary or the file, they can be stored as arrays of lines (or strings).\n\n### Expected Output:\n\n\n### Inputs:\n\n\n## Program\n\n\n```py\n\n\n\n\n```\n\n\n## Output\n\n\n```py \nprint (\"Adam bought 3 kilogums of nuts and 4 kilogums of dried fruits. 1 kil", "answer": "B: map"}

After that, it should call the function printFirstName(), pass in \"First Name\" as the only argument and print the response in green. \n####  This should happen like this: prompt user --> call function receive() --> call printFirstName(First Name)\n\n## \ud83d\udc49 Code\n```\n\tvoid receive()\n\t{\n\t\tcout<<\"Enter your name, please.\"<<endl;\n\t}\n\n\tvoid printFirstName()\n\t{\n        cout<<\"First Name\"<<endl;\n    }\n```\n## \ud83d\ude43 Tips\n* Use the keyword 'const' for methods with no argument like receive(). Because the value can't be changed, you don't want to have to access variables like 'name'. You can, however, have a constructor as well as public methods and variables.\n* In the print method, you don't have arguments, but you do have code. So you use the parameter name that will accept the code.\n## \ud83d\udcda Additional Learning\n* When learning to program, it is important to understand the terminology we are using.\n\n### \ud83d\udc49 Useful Terms\n* const keyword - Used in declaration and assignment, indicates type of value can't be modified.\n* const method - Used on declaration, indicates type of value, can't be modified.\n* public variables and methods - Variable and method that can be accessed by object outside of that object.\n* protected variables and methods - Variable or method that can be accessed only by within same class or by a class that inherits", "answer": "E: desk drawer"}

The pantry is a good option because it is accessible when going outside of the kitchen.\n\n### Answer: \n1. Answer: C: 2. Explain:  Storing canned goods for the winter in the cupboard would be unsafe. There could be a fire started if too many cans were being stored in the cupboard at once. The pantry is located in the back of the kitchen behind a wooden bookshelf. The pantry had enough space to store the canned goods. The pantry was a perfect place to store canned goods because I could access  it by going outside the kitchen and entering the garage. I chose not to store my canned food in the pantry because it was in the garage. Garage access should be restricted to the right person.\n### Solution:\n#### 56 (Answer) and 1\nAnswer: C\nRationales: Since the canned food was placed in the pantry, I would have a hard time gaining access to the items in my garage. The panty is accessible outside of the kitchen. I would also not have to bring all of my canned food from the kitchen with me.

If they wanted to change the government to a monarchy they would make the senate vote on it to go from a republic to a kingdom. If the vote didn't go the way the senate wanted to and it went to the people for a vote, the senate would put pressure on them to change the vote. If it still went the way the people wanted to vote it would go to the people for another vote. That would probably be the one that would stick because their would be more pressure to go along with what the senate wanted. After the vote the person ruling would be picked by a senate election and it would be decided on there.

We often measure the amount of people that we can fit in a small room. For example if you have a small dinning room you will go the supermarket and get a smaller table for the small room. Also in many big stores, dinning tables sold in large quantities are usually sold to homeowners.

{"text": "A\n\n#### 37\nQ: What does a judge do when somebody is convicted of a criminal offense?\nA: To put it plainly, The judge will bring in a verdict.\nIn the event of a person being arraigned on criminal allegations or upon a charge brought against them for a criminal offense, by a court or by a legislative body with due authority, the defendant must answer to the crime committed.\nThe process by which a judicial body decides the truth or validity of the issues contained in a charge is known as the legal process. It usually is a written accusation that details acts that are believed by the accuser to constitute a violation of law, or other authoritative directive. A person who is accused of a crime is referred to as the defendant. Following a criminal charge the defendant is given the opportunity to respond in a number of ways. Some of these ways constitute their guilty plea. The court, a jury, judge, or other competent authority or administrative body who presides, sits or stands to decide the validity of the allegations constitutes the legal body.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the defendant to decide his or her case either \"guilty\" or \"not guilty\" of the offense charged. Following the charges filed the case moves to discovery stage; where the defendant is given an opportunity to present their defense by using witnesses at hearing who may be asked questions by the defendant to show proof of their actions and what occurred during the alleged criminal activity.\n\nThe discovery period enables the defendant to determine the strength of the prosecutor's case. In case the defendant decides to go for a plea bargain, the court and both the prosecutor and the defendant negotiate the terms. The criminal charge usually states the crime, the facts or evidence behind the incident, and the person who caused the crime. After the charges and evidence has been collected the defendant is normally taken before the judge for final judgment. The prosecutor may or may not ask for a sentence to apply to the defendant. The defendant, however, may opt to seek leniency or a lighter punishment through the plea bargain.\n\nThe judge who is a person who has a legal right to hear and determine the case of any issue, is obliged to consider the factors or mitigating circumstance", "answer": "D: pass sentence"}

Our answer for this is the right one, it said the\nanswer is start to fall. That is because if we walk bare-footed after rain, we will get \nwet because the ground will be wet so our shoes will get wet too.\n\n### The output of the task\n\nIn the instruction which tells us the task that we need to answer.\nThe choices given in the task is: A: shoes B : wet ground C : wet clothes D : start to fall \nE : water garden The answer is D : start to fall cause if we walk bare-feet after rain, we will \nget wet because on the ground there will be the water.\n\n### How I got the answer for this question\n\nIn order to answer this question, I have to think what the sentence meant in the task. At first, I only see that the question asked a question, the meaning in the question is why shouldn't we walk bare-foots after rain or when it rains. Then I go to the sentence in the task that said \u201cWe found that most people\u201d the sentence has many words in it. Then, I continue reading the sentence that \u201c...were aware of the dangers of walking on wet ground, and 65% of them said that they wore shoes in rainy days.\u201d\nIn the sentence that I have read, it said about why shouldn\u2019t we walk bare-feets after rain. It also explained that not everyone can answer this question cause the meaning of the sentence is different so for that reason, the sentence said most people and the rest people are not aware of the question and if they said that, the sentence said the percent of them and some part of them wore shoes, the rest part didn\u2019t wear shoes. \n\n### Rewriting to solve the problem\n\nIn this task, there are a lot of explanations that", "answer": "B: wet ground"}

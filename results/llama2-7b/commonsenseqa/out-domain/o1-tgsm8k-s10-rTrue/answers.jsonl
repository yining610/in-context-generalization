B If your foot was half the length of your entire body then your hand would be half the length of it. C If you add your foot and hand length you get your arm length. D If the length of your foot plus hand equals half your arm then we would need some more detail to know the answer.

The sum is provided in the above given formula and then sqaure root is calculated to the summation of squared deviations.\n\nInput:Fish are swimming, one at the North Pole and another at the South Pole. Their two velocities are always 40 km/hour and 45 km/hour, respectively. The distance between their positions is always 550 km. What is the mean velocity of the two fish relative to each other?\nOutput:The formula for finding out mean velocity of the fish is given in the formula.  As per the problem the velocity of the fish is constant.\nAs a result the sum of squares of the deviation will not contain any change of variables. In the above given example the speed of both of the fish is constant, hence the speed is a constant value and does not change. Thus taking the square of constant only once as in the above formula will result in constant.\nThus the constant is only taken once and the sqauring is not done again. After the summing is done the squaring is done", "answer": "C: unpredictable"}

{"text": "Frequent parties are eternal parties. So I have chosen the last letter \"E\".\n\n\n### **Instruction:** \n\nInput: Adam, the founder of A-Tech company, has a dream: to create computers, that process huge amounts of data. However, he cannot figure out an algorithm that can handle big data correctly.\n\nHis assistant, Eve, however, has a brilliant idea. As a gift, in exchange for a big sum of money, she promises Adam a perfect algorithm, that processes data that are as big as a trillion (10^12) digits. Unfortunately, even computers, in 1800 were only able to process big data in the hundreds (10^3), not trillions (10^11).\n\nSo while Adam\u2019s assistant (who does the work) tells him the great news about the algorithm, the question remains: can they do it?\n\nSo Eve has to tell the truth about what she can do, but only give Adam a yes/no question. Adam on the other hand, has to decide what the computer can do correctly, given the answers Eve gives him.\n\nAt first look, if Adam says the computer can handle big data with 1 digit precision, then he is right, as the algorithm can count to a billion (10^9).\n\nHowever, if Adam tells Eve that she told him that the computer can do it, but with 10 digits precision, she might just say no. Because a computer cannot count that high. Adam, in this case, will say that the assistant would only tell him the truth. And on the other hand, if Eve tells him that the computer can handle data to 100 digits precision, then Adam would tell her that she is correct. So Adam will only tell the assistant to tell him the truth. Eve on the other hand would have to tell him the truth or that a computer is nowhere near being able to count so high.\n\n###** Instruction:**\n\nInput: \n\nOutput: There are 2 possibilities. Either 0 or 1 because otherwise the number of possibilities is 0 (1 digit) or 1 (10 digits. Therefore, there can\u2019t be an infinite number.\nSo the answer is 0 or 1.\n\n\n###**Instruction:**", "answer": "D: frequent"}

You can use any of the built-in functions except sort(), which sort is implemented.\n- Use a single IF statement to selectively include numbers in the list that are lower than 7, greater than 7 or that are equal to 7.\n- Use any of the built-ins or your own code to append selected numbers to the list. Also make sure you are careful about the order of operations (use brackets) in your code.\n\n# HackerEarth\n### Problem: [![HackerEarth-Image][HE-Image]][HE]\n### Instruction/Idea: \nIt is interesting to know how the number 10 is generated or is it defined by a human.\nIn this problem, we will create a generator function that can create number from 1 to 100 by using some random steps. We can use two types of random numbers in JavaScript to create random numbers.\n- Math.random()\n- Math.floor()\n\nWe can use a **FOR** loop to generate the random numbers with some steps like this:\n- We have a condition i <= 100 (100 is the upper limit of the for loop), and 1 (the upper limit will always be the input to i) to 99 (the range of the input to i).\n- Once i is set to 1, it will go through this for loop 100 times, and then it increases by 1 to 2. Once 2 is set to 100 times it will go through this loop 99 times because the range of i is 1 - 99, so the upper limit is **100 x 99 = 9900", "answer": "D: united states"}

{"text": "You have no choice but to kill all the monsters in front. After all, it\u2019s a war.\n\nInput:What is the meaning of the above sentence?\nOutput:Your objective is to kill all enemies that come in front of you. To do so you will have to fight, use a lot of combat skills and even join the army. This sentence can describe what you have to go through in the battlefield, as well as what a soldier goes through in a war. But you also have to think about what the word battle signifies. It is used to refer to two different, but closely related events. The main difference being that in war you will fight against an opposing force, while in battle you fight with your team, sometimes even against your own people. When two armies fight it can be called battle, however it is called battle only when the two teams on opposite sides of the battle use battle techniques such as bombing. When the army uses these techniques to fight for territory, it is not called \u201cbattle\u201d. The soldiers on one team often have no idea where the actual frontline is; they have been separated from their unit and must fight for their own survival. These fighters fight each other to death or capture each other. Warriors often have no idea where battle lines are; they have been separated by military leaders and must fight for their survival. Warriors often come to battles for territory and fight each other to death.\n\n\n#### Test Case : \nCase 1: 12*3=36\nCase2: 2*2=4\nCase3: 2*2+3*3+8*8=56", "answer": "A: conquer opponent"}

In other words employee wasted 9 * 60=540 seconds. So the final answer is 240 seconds.\n\n\n### Explanation:1. This is because nuts and dried fruits are the only two types of goods available in the store. I used nested if-else condition that contains a nested if-else condition for each goods so when the inner if condition becomes true the outer if condition is satisfied.I applied the concept of break out condition that is the first condition of both two outer ifs are always true.(break out condition is very popular technique in competitive programming)\n\n2. I applied nested if-else that includes nested if-else for each option and a break out condition that is every orchestra member plays at least one instrument. So to find the total instrument played in one orchestra, we can multiply the number of members of an orchestra with the total instruments that one plays.\n\n3.The solution is straightforward the only important thing is to differentiate the types of concertos that can be performed by one instrument and types of instruments that can be played by the clarinet.", "answer": "B: orchestra"}

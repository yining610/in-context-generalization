However, you notice it doesn't go through traffic lights. Choices:<n>A: It is an extremely expensive car<n>B: It is broken<n>C: It never turns on<n>D: It uses a manual transmission<n><n>Output: If you buy a very fast car, then you can't take it anywhere where you need to stop and have it turn on.  This is probably a car that uses a manual transmission, so you need to be able to shift the car into a certain gear, and shift it out again.  This action requires a separate hand control, which you don't have in a manual transmission, so the only reason you would get a manual transmission car is if you had two hands.  This is probably why it turns off because you only use one hand to control it

Choices:  A: slender B: free flowing C: sparse D: unacquainted E: diet<n>Output:		In English "thick" can be used as an adjective: a thick person or being thick. It is also an abstract noun: being thick, being thickheaded or thick-tongued. So "thick" can be used with all the nouns in the selection.<n>In Mathematics, "thick" can be understood in "thin". A thin number is a number that cannot be expressed as the product of two integers.<n>For example, every integer is the product of two different integers. So every other integer that isn't the product of two integers has to be thick.<n>For example, 4 is the product of two integers that can't be used, so it must be thick.<n>Therefore, our answer is C.<n>

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input:An attempt to confirm an applicant's reference would fail if the reference does what? Choices:  A: question B: dispute C: deny D: contradict E: refuse<n>Output:		The correct answer is D. Confirm would mean to make sure, so if an applicant’s reference confirms an applicant’s eligibility, they agree that the applicant is eligible. To refuse would mean to deny something. By confirm, it means to make something eligible, not to deny.<n><n>input: What does the sign in front of 3+4 in the equation show? Choices: A: + B: - C: × D: ÷ E: 0/4<n>Output:Choices should be - A, - B, and - D. All of the other choices would mean nothing of importance because it would just be an addition that you are removing. An example would be - (3+4)=((-3)+(-4))=-7.<n><n>output: The correct answer is C. When -4 divided by 2, it becomes -2 because 2 is an even number, so the sign in front is negative, and it is divided by even 2, creating a negative number. The answer to -4/2 is -2 and not -4 or -0.2.<n><n>Output:The correct choice would be A because the subtraction sign needs a negative number in order to stay negative. In this case, the only negative in the problem is -4, so that becomes the answer (-4).<n><n>output:The correct choice by the choice I believe is A. If you look at the parentheses, they only tell you what you should divide by (11), not who to division for. If there was 46, then if you were to divide the answer by 11, you would get four and not two.<n><n>output:All of the other choices for the correct answer are -, which is negative infinity. This is  because there isn't a denominator in the fraction, so you can't have a negative infinity as the answer.<n><n>output:The only answer that would make sense is 3 because we can't divide by zero. If you were to do this operation, you would be doing division by zero, so the answer is 3.<n><n>output:I believe the correct answer for the division operation would be B. We can't divide by a single number without using the symbol above the parenthesis(e.g. in 5/2/4). So the only answer that would make any sense

So ultimately, since 1 618 days in a year, the total number of cats in a year = 2*(618) = 1336. So the total number of crows in a year will be 1*2 1336 = 2 673<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the next two multiple choice questions.<n><n>If we let C(x) = cats on day x, we have,<n>$$<n>\begin{gather}<n>C(1) + C(2) + C(3) + C(4) + C(5) + C(6) + C(7) + C(8) = \\<n>= C(3248

Choices:  A: backery B: ham sandwich C: fridge D: butcher shop E: freezer<n>Output:		C<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>If the initial meat, in Corey's case, is Tapanga's + another 8 = the total meat available, we can break it evenly on the four choices for input A, B, C, D, and E. We can do this because the two inputs and the two outputs represent a series of multiplication. Now, in order for Corey to get the meat he wants, he cannot subtract x + 8 from 66, because that would be subtracting (x + 8 -x) from the equation (2x + 8), which would result in 0 - 0, which means the equation would not work, or, in other words, the answer would be a negative integer.<n><n>Therefore, the solution to the above problem is 29, because it satisfies the condition to the equation (2x+8)=66.<n>

This means the number is 10(3+1).<n><n>Input: You were told the price of the jacket is 8 dollars and there are three buttons to it. You know the price of a button is 2 dolllars. You were also told the dress is 4 dolllars and there are 5 buttons to it. How many buttons are there?<n>Output: The price per button for the jacket (8 = b) and for the dress (4 = c) are different amounts, so we know this is not enough information to answer the how many buttons question. Instead, we know that the total price (d) is (5 * 2) + (1 * 2) = 12 dollars for the jacket, and it is (8 * 5) + (4 * 3) = 24 dollars for the dress.<n>The question now becomes, how many different amounts of money does the seller have? The answer is d-b = (24-12) or the total price for the jacket less the price

Choices:  A: cook dinner B: make bread C: eat in restaurant D: have lunch E: make bread<n>Output:		Let's use the letter "X" to represent the options. We can make an equation like: <X + T = E> (for what we will eat).<n>Here, T stands for "Taking". In this equation, the "lunch" (represented by letter E) is taken during the day "E+T = E". This could be translated into: "Everything that is for lunch during the day is what we will eat at the middle of the day". This could also be saying: "A person will be able to eat the lunch during the day, at the middle of the" day. "D" and "C": The choice between "cooking dinner" and "making bread" is a matter of "Taking something away" (as seen in "cooking or making bread", when one cooks the other one cannot be done). This is equivalent to an equation of <X = E/x> (as <"X = E" and "<not X = X" (x/x) >)<n><n>Input: When using the word "and", what does it represent? Choices: A. both B. one C. either<n>Output: The word "and" can be considered as the symbol of a "relation", and therefore can be represented through the expression <A + B>. When this expression is equal to "one" ("A+B = 1" is, therefore, A+B = 0 or A = 0 and B = 0), it may be considered that the word "and" actually is both "A" and "B". A person may be considered to be "one", but this doesn't mean that the person isn't considered to be either "one" or "either".<n><n>Input: When is it sunny? Choices: A: when it is cloudy B: after 11:00 AM C: never D: when it is sunny E: when the sun rises<n>Output: An easy way to recognize in which condition the sun may be sunny is with the word "neither". For example, the sun can be defined as the Sun, or as the planet around which the people on earth live. "Neither" implies that it is not the Sun that is sunny, and it cannot be. However, the sun that we can see in the sky, the one that gives us the light, is known as

Flower petals have that in common with flower and animal but not with vegetable and flower. By combining with that information that flower petals are vegetable, we can determine which flower petals can be eaten as vegetable. So, flower petals can be a vegetable. And, a vegetable can be eaten. Thus, if you plant a garden you have some kind of flower with that can be eaten. However, that flower can be either a flower or not a flower. So, the answer must be flower or animal. But flower can be eaten as it is vegetable, so, flower.

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input:Though nearby, an apple from an apple tree where would be an imported product to the USA? Choices:  A: ohio B: washington state C: alaska D: canada E: flowers<n>Output:		The answer is E: flowers<n><n>To answer this question, we will first need to define product, and we will begin by writing a formal definition of product.<n><n>A formal definition of a product is that a product is a set of numbers multiplied together.<n><n>It is important to remember what each term means. Let's use math to explain some of this.<n>The first number we would multiply together, we will call this number 'a'. The multiplier will be called 'b', and the last number we will multiply together will be called 'c'. If I wanted to multiply these values together, my new set of numbers will look something like this: <n>2*5*3 = 30 <n><n>Because of this, if a*b*c is the multiplication we performed, it is also called the product of a *b*c.<n><n>To complete our definition of the product, we need to specify what kind of thing we are calling a 'product' to describe what is being multiplied.<n><n>We can call a product, a set of numbers that we multiply together. The set of numbers that we are multiplying together, it means that they are not just one big number, but a collection of different number that come in a set.<n><n>This definition is going to be critical when we come to multiplying multiple values at the same time. It has also introduced the concept of a set that we may use as a product.<n>The reason that we do not just call the numbers that are multiplied together something like product numbers, is because even though the product of some numbers like 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 is 720, this number itself is not a product. <n>A single number cannot be called a product. <n>It is only when we multiply multiple number together, that we can call them a product.<n><n>Now with this knowledge, the input to this question will be simpler.<n>First, I assume that when the people were trying to answer this question, they did not know much formal math at the time and did not know what a multiplication was.<n>As you can see on the input to this question, we have numbers that are going to be multiplied, which I suspect will lead to the answer being either 'E' or 'D'.<n>Second, I also believe that this question would have been answered by a farmer who lived in Washington at the time.<n>However
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input:If done correctly grooming pet's nails generally does not cause this? Choices:  A: training B: satisfaction C: injury D: beauty E: late<n>Output:		Choices: A and B<n>So the correct answer is A and B<n><n>Input:Tapanga and Corey share 50 candy bars. However, Corey has 40% more. <n><n>  Input Output: If they're equal, a Corey has more than Tapanga because percentages of candy bars is 40%, which means Corey has half more than Tapanga, so if Corey has candy bars, he has half of them of Tapanga's, but Tapanga also has half of the shared candy bars, which means she also has half, but Corey has a little more because he has 40%, then he has half of the shared candies. So, Corey has more than half of the shared candys, which means he has more than half the candy bars of Tapanga.<n><n>Input:Choices: The number of students who attend school on a daily basis is typically less than the the number of students who attend at least? <n>Output:Choices : A, B, C<n>So the correct answer choices are A, B, and C<n>Input:If the sum of three numbers is 25, then the median is 12.<n><n>Input Output:If the median is 11, and the sum of the numbers is 28.<n>Let the numbers be a, b, and c. Then, the sum of a, b, and 28 is 103.<n>To make it to a median of 11, we need a third number with this value.<n>  Thus, the third number must be 28.<n>  The other options could also be true,<n>    however, the statement " Then the sum of the numbers will be 35." is incorrect for the third number to be 28. 35 is not a median at all, because the sum of a,b,c will be exactly twice the median. <n>  Also, 25 is halfway between 20 and 5. The median is not 15. <n>So the other answers are correct<n>

For example, the first step determines whether it is a number or not. If it is, then it continues with the second step.If it is not, it will return False. In this way, the recursion continues until it is a number, and returns True.<n><n>### Instuction:Describe recursion in your own words.<n><n>Solution by recursion means to call a function from inside that very function. So recursion means that a function calls itself, and it can keep doing that indefinitely until it stops by making sure that a condition (or a condition that makes the call to itself recursive) is not met. By doing this, we can do complex computations very easily.<n>

However, the state in which x is located, is neither louisiana or arkansas, therefore x or z must be c.<n>Therefore c is either louisiana or Arkansas.<n>Since z is not at the zoo, z must be either arkansas or louisiana.<n>Since x is at the zoo, x is not either louisiana nor arkansas.<n>Therefore x is either at the zoo or at the zoo(c).<n>Since x and z are not the same, either z = c or x = c.<n><n>We can also determine that there is no way to be able to differentiate c from z, unless z is louisiana or x is arkansas.<n>The only way to do this is to use the fact that z is either at the zoo(c) or is louisiana (c).<n>However, if z is arkansas(x), then this statement would be a contradiction, because z(c) would be louisiana, and x(c) would be arkansas.<n>So c is not both louisiana and arkansas, and thus c is neither louisanna or arkansas.<n>As for the fox, either it's at the zoo, or it's in louisiana. Let the fox be x.<n>So either x is at the zoo or x is in louisiana(c).<n>So either x is c or c = x. Since c and x are not the same, this would not be a possible scenario.<n>Therefore, c is in louisana.<n>We have no way to disprove or prove whether X is in louisianna or arkansas.

Choices:  A: wall B: office C: space shuttle D: front door E: tent<n>Output:		Choice E: tent<n>Let x = the space occupied by the tent.<n>The area covered by each window is x2, so the total area covered by windows = Σx2<n><n>Let y = the area of wall.<n>The area covered of wall is y2 and there are 4 corners.<n><n>Therefore, 4Σx2 = 4Σx2 + y2<n>Combining like term, Σx2 = Σx2 + y^2<n>Subtrobing 2 for y^2, we get Σx^2 – y^2<n>Combining the variable we get, (Σx)2/4 – y^2/4<n>Let D = Σx/4 - y/4<n><n>Choose the correct choice:<n>Choices: A: 54 B: 2 C: 48 D: 64<n><n>Output: Choice D: 64.<n>The equation for area of tent is A = x2 and the area of space shuttle is A = x3.<n>The area of front door is A = x4 and the area of office is A = x5<n>Therefore, (Σx) = A<n>Combining like-terms, we get<n>x = 64<n>So the final answer to the choices is D: 64 because the answer to D is 64 and the other answer choices are not true. Also if a number was false then the answer would be the one false choice. This is due to the fact that you are subtracting from the total number that was correct for the entire answer choice.

One of them is indentation. Although, codecademy does a good job of showing you good indentation, I struggled with it in my program. I had to be sure to indent the code correctly and there were times where the indentation did not display correctly due to me forgetting to hit enter. Secondly, I struggled when I was working on the program involving the book prices. I couldn't find a way to tell if a price was more than others because there was not a  way to make more than one line of code.  So that is why I wrote a program that would allow for me to not write so much code. Thirdly, when I wrote the question involving music. I struggled when it came to explaining that it is hard to judge the taste in music. Because although someone likes music I don't know if they like the same type of music. Lastly, the problem

Choices: 2: James = 4 and Jhon = 12 3: James = 7 and Jhon = 8 4: James = 8 and Jhon = 6 5: James = 8 ans Jhon = 4<n>Output: The second rule is the rule of order in which we multiply numbers. It states that when we multiply two sets of numbers to obtain a sum, any numbers in the same place will be added together first. If the same rules of addition are used in the process of multiplication, then we are following the rule of order. So the answer has to be option 4, James = 8 ans = 4 and Jhope = 8 ans =6, hence the correct answer is 8 ans = 6. <n><n>### Instructions:Please answer these questions based on the given graph.<n>Input: What is the minimum value of ___? Choices:  -17  -12  -6  -2<n>Output: The rule of elimination, which implies that all negative numbers are subtracted, can be used in a graph. -2 is the negative number, and it is smaller than -6, so -2 is subtracted.  The same procedure is done for further negative numbers, until the graph becomes flat. However, only the negative numbers on the graph are removed. As such, -17 is removed. But the difference between -12 and -6 is less than the difference between -17 and -12, so -6 is subtracted. -8 is less than -2, so -8 is subtracted.  -2 is the negative of x, while -2 is less than -4, so  the latter is added up to the former. Thus, -2 is added up.  -3 is greater than -2, so no operation is performed on it.  -4 is not less than -5 and so no operation is performed. So the final answer is -4.<n><n>Input: In what year did the American Revolutionary War occur? Choices:

Choices:  A: bushes B: dessert C: books D: heat lamps E: rocks<n>Output:		Lizards need the sun to regulate their body temperatures and their suns heat is the source of warmth to their bodies. Lizards love to sit and chill in the heat lamps for a while during the hot noon and hot afternoons. They do this because as they stay in the heat they will see a drop in their body temperatures and cool down. During the spring time when the temperatures start to warm back up then the lizards will start to seek shade and retreats into bushes and trees to cool off their bodies. When temperatures get really high in the summers around the 90s the lizards will be hanging out in their cool shady habitats waiting for the cooler seasons to get here. That's why even though they love to catch up with their good buds under the heat lamps they always go back to their cool habitats.<n><n>Input: When a body goes into shock, its blood pressure drops rapidly.<n>Output: When a body goes in to shock, then the blood pressure goes down, that's because there is sudden loss of circulation of blood due to reduced blood flow to organs that causes loss of consciousness.<n><n>Input: As the sun sets in the Western USA, the temperatures rise dramatically.

Please read [In every post, try to include the actual code you wrote. Not a link to somewhere else. Not an image. The code. The code, we want to see it, all of it.](https://codereview.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1471)<n>For a start, the [markdown](https://stackoverflow.com/editing-help#syntax) here is not working.<n><n>Comment: Code Review is not a substitute for the practice problem section. Please read [How do I ask and answer homework questions?](https://meta.codereview.stackexchange.com/q/1471). It's a good habit to have all of your homework questions answered before posting on Code Review.<n><n>Comment: I see you have a question here and also the answer. Is this what you should be doing? If so I'm afraid we cannot help you then. Do we look at code you don't understand, where your idea is good but you just need to see the flaws in your code.<n><n>Comment: This is what a Code Review would be like @G.K.<n><n>Comment: @JoeRoman that's what I meant. If OP had come with code that worked, with their flaws and problems in which they wanted to improve then yeah that this would be suitable for CR. As it is now, this feels like a homework dump question. If not homework dump, then at least some teacher or tutor gave this and OP feels like he has to post this.<n><n>Answer: Your answer is technically correct, but you are miscounting. When you subtract 8 from both sides you subtract 8 times to get 8 away from 66, which would be 66 - 66 + 8 - 8 = 0 instead of 29. I assume your answer had a typo and you really meant to subtract 8 once.<n><n>Also, if I had gotten C

We know that snakes don't like water, so they don't live in the tropics.  Likewise, snakes aren't likely to be found in Wyoming or Alaska or the southern and northernmost parts of the country.  Snakes also tend to hide in the underbrush and under bushes in the wild.  The most logical place to find snakes is in the fields and prairies of the continental United states.<n>The final answer is (b)<n><n>Input:A man is walking from one end of a long hallway to the other end of the hallway.<n>Input:What is the man’s distance in the first picture, after 25 minutes of walking and before he reaches the door at the hallway’s other end?<n>His total distance traveled will be equal to (25 minutes) + (the previous total distance traveled) = (25 * 60) + (10 minutes) = (1500) + (1500 feet) = 3000 feet<n>He then reaches the door at the end of the hallway, but doesn't exit until the next 15 minutes have passed, which results in another 2250 feet traveled, so the final answer is 3000 + 2250 = 5250 feet.<n><n>Input:When it snows, it sometimes becomes icy in cold temperatures.<n>(a) The water in the ocean freezes<n>(b) The water in the oceans becomes colder<n>(c) The water in the lake freezes<n>(d) The water temperature becomes colder<n>(e) The temperature becomes colder<n>Answers: (D)(D)<n>The first sentence states that it snows, which implies that water freezes when it gets cold.

Each of Corey’s shoes has 15 toes. When they each wear a pair of shoes, they each have 12 toes together. If Tapanga loses 4 pairs, what are the pairs Tapanga had before  she lost them?<n> 	Output: Let each shoe have 2 toes, meaning there were 26 toes in each shoe. Let x = the number of pairs of Tapanga's shoes. Thus x = 13 pairs. Let r = the number of toes in each sher. Thus 13r = 26, so 13r = <<26=26>> r = 2 Therefore they each have 11 toes together.  Tapanga had 13 pairs of 26 toes, which is equivalent to 318 toes.<n>So the final amount of lost pairs is 4 pairs.<n><n>Input: How many cups of water and ounces of sugar can be made from 2.28 galons of soda?<n>Output: Convert the 1.6 gal into the number of cups: 1.6 = <<16=16>>  = 8 cups<n>2.28 gal = <<288=288>> 16 ounces; each ounce is 0.0625 cups.<n>2.28gal * 0.063 = <<144.32=144.3>>  = 21.385 cups<n>When we round to the tenths place we get 10 cups = 22 oz.

Please use code samples instead of images when you ask a question (but I assume you are new to this so I will cut you some slack and write a short explanation below).<n><n>Look at the second input/instruction...it doesn't explain what is suppose to be output, it just states an equation. No variable name...no "assignment"? So if you don't know how to do an assignment when there is no specific variable name, then you have two options...<n>\begin{itemize}<n>\item Write a script that checks on every candidate solution, each candidate solution is an input to the script, and prints if the candidate solution is correct. So for every possible candidate solution, your script will have to test it. Once the script is tested and works, test all possible inputs and print the ones with correct values. This is called manual checking.<n>\item If you have the patience and you don't mind the risk/reward ratio, you could write a full-blown program (or app) including a GUI (Graphical User Interface) that asks questions (inputs) from the user, and on each question it prints the answer (for correct questions or incorrect for incorrect ones) and repeats it as long as the user wants the app to keep asking questions until the app asks 1 more question than times the user wants the app ask the questions. When the input is "end", the program ends itself. You could also include the GUI by using Tkinter for Python. Tkinter GUIs look better than some of the GUIs written by VB or some other language because of the Tcl/Tk "glue code" that makes Tkinter GUIs work.<n>\end{itemize}<n><n>The "risk" of manual checking is that it only tests the candidate solution to the question but not the original question. If you write a program to test all the correct candidate solutions by doing so, the programmer (that wrote the script) could only rely on what was written in the script. The "reward"

Choices:  A: age grieving person B: heart attacks C: depression D: hair loss E: headache<n>Output:		The correct answer is A. We all know that age is the leading cause of death, followed closely by accidents, suicide, murder, and finally, old age. Even when a person is grieving over the loss of a loved one, their immune system can be strong enough to fight off minor viruses and ailments brought on that stress. Therefore, the best way to prevent someone from dying is to deal with their grief quickly and effectively. With grief treatment, it would be difficult for a victim to have a complete mental breakdown or to feel like they want to commit suicide or murder. This would significantly reduce their grieving and decrease their risk of causing death by suicide or murder. Even if grieving gets worse, there are still methods available to help prevent that person from killing themselves or another person.<n>Answer Choices: A, B, C, D, E<n>Correct Answer: A: age grieving<n>Answer Explanation:<n>The correct answer among all the choices is A: Age Grieving. This is because grieving may have a bad effect on a person’s well-being and health as they age, they could be at risk for various kinds of diseases and have a harder time healing themselves from those diseases. For people who aren’t old, grief can also affect them greatly. People who are already stressed out or emotionally depressed from other things may find themselves even more depressed when faced with something as hard-hitting as the death of one’s loved one. The stress could also lead to the death of loved ones who are already weak because they aren’t healthy. The stress could cause health problems as well. For people who aren't old, grieving could cause a lot of mental damage just from the emotional strain of being stressed out or overwhelmed.<n><n>It is important to treat both mental health and physical health problems immediately so that they do not lead us down into a downward spiral of depression and death from stressful situations.<n><n>*<n>Examples:<n>

Output: For this type of problem, you have three variables: $$x$$, $$y$$, and $$z$$ and $$n$$, which is an unknown. To find $n$, it's helpful to make the equation less complicated.  Let $x = 2$ and rewrite the equation: $$z - y = n - 2$$  Now $n$ is in front of $x$, which you can solve for $n$ by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation: $$n = z - 2 - y$$ To solve for $y$, you can use the above equation to rewrite the equation, and solve for $y$: $$2 = z - 2 + n$$  Solve this equation for $z$: $$z = 7$$ Next, since there is a letter in the equation such as: $$z$$, you need to subtract the $z$$ from the equation to get $y$ alone: $$-z = -7 + n$$  To solve for $y$ alone, subtract 7 from both sides of the equations: $$y = n - 7$$ This gives you, $$7 = n - 7\\ n = 7$$ Since there is an even number of $y$'s in the equation, you know the order doesn't matter so you can combine the two equations: $$-z = n - 7\iff -24 = n - 7 $$ Now, $z = 24$. For $n$, $$n = 7$$<n><n><n>Input/Output (part 2): Input: You can describe your grandparents as old and wise. You can describe a cactus as a dried out plant that has tiny spikes.

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input:If people listen, they can understand each other better.  If they understand each other, they can do what? Choices:  A: pay bills B: swap bodies C: learn from each other D: believe in god E: talk to each other<n>Output:		To get to the point, yes.  But I could easily give four examples of times people believe they have done one thing when they have just done another, like when a driver is going the speed limit, the police officer believes the driver is speeding when it is the other way around.  But the speed of the vehicle only gives information about how fast it is moving in a certain direction.  If the speed of the car is 60 miles per hour east and it is heading west, the car is moving in the exact opposite direction; therefore it is moving at 0 miles per hour on that section of road.<n><n>Input:If two people are 64 miles apart along the way and the second person starts 10 minutes after the first, how long is it take for the second person to catch up? choices:  32 minutes 48 minutes 18 minutes 58 minutes<n>Output:The distance between two people does not necessarily equal the time it takes for the second person to reach the first.  Therefore, we cannot make the assumption that at every mile marker there are 17 minutes left until the second person reaches the first.  <n><n>Input:Glenn can jump higher than Carl.  Glenn is a meter taller than Carl, but his longer legs do not make him jump any higher.  How much closer together are Glenn and Carl when Glenn jumps?<n>Output:If Glenn is a meter _taller_ than Carl, he cannot be a meter closer to Carl when he jumps than he was before.  It is impossible for Glenn's legs to suddenly become shorter and still have him be a meter taller.  Therefore, when Glenn jumps, he no longer has that extra meter of height.  When he jumps, Glenn and Carl are the same height.  The jump was a wasted effort.<n><n>Input:What time is it?  Choices:  o clock  quarter after o clock  five minutes to o clock  ten minutes to o clock twelve o clock<n>Output:I am using this question as an example of a trick question.  All of these choices are true and they cannot be differentiated.  The only way to answer this question is to ask for more information, such as, "What time is it, in the _hour_, _minute_, and _second_?'<n><n>Input:You are in a room.<n>You are in

Choices:  A: own home B: old england C: new hampshire D: coffin E: denmark<n>Output:		Let x denote the probability of finding the lost dog in <<29=2D>>2D England.<n>Combining like x and 1 - x, we get 1 - x = 1 - <<29=28>>28.<n>Solving for x, we get x = 28, therefore, we are more likely to find the lost dog in New England than anywhere else.<n><n>Input: Is there an even number of people in the room? Choices: a: yes b: no c: it depends<n>Output: Let x represent the number of people in a room.<n>If the room has an even number of people, then x is an even number.<n>If the room does not have an even number of people then x is an odd number.<n>Therefore, to determine if there is an even number of people we plug our values into the equation. Let f = the even number<n>f + odd = 0<n>f = <<29=0>>29 or even x=even(2x = 2f) (so f=2x, because even x + odd = 0 and x was even)<n>(f - odd)<n><n>If the above is true, we are told that there is an even number or people in the room.<n><n>If the above does not evaluate to true, our expression will not equal 2x and thus we know there is an odd number of people in the<n>room.<n><n>Input: In a group of ten people, are there an even number of men? Choices: A: yes B: no C: It depends<n>Output: It Depends, let y = the even number of men<n>y + odd = the even number of women.<n>y + odd = 2y.<n>Therefore, y=14<n>And since x = y, 14 = even x (14 + odd = 2x).<n><n>Input: Is every girl in the group older than 41? Choices: A) Yes B) No C) It depends<n>Output: Let f = odd number of girls<n>f + even = odd number of women.<n>f + even = 2f<n>Therefore, f = 10, which is an even number. Therefore, some women in the group are older than 41.<n>This would mean that each even number of girls represents and odd number in a group of women

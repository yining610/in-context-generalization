All of the other choices would mean nothing of importance because it would just be an addition that you are removing. An example would be - (3+4)=((-3)+(-4))=-7.\n\noutput: The correct answer is C. When -4 divided by 2, it becomes -2 because 2 is an even number, so the sign in front is negative, and it is divided by even 2, creating a negative number. The answer to -4/2 is -2 and not -4 or -0.2.\n\nOutput:The correct choice would be A because the subtraction sign needs a negative number in order to stay negative. In this case, the only negative in the problem is -4, so that becomes the answer (-4).\n\noutput:The correct choice by the choice I believe is A. If you look at the parentheses, they only tell you what you should divide by (11), not who to division for. If there was 46, then if you were to divide the answer by 11, you would get four and not two.\n\noutput:All of the other choices for the correct answer are -, which is negative infinity. This is  because there isn't a denominator in the fraction, so you can't have a negative infinity as the answer.\n\noutput:The only answer that would make sense is 3 because we can't divide by zero. If you were to do this operation, you would be doing division by zero, so the answer is 3.\n\noutput:I believe the correct answer for the division operation would be B.

{"text": "The answer is E: flowers\n\nTo answer this question, we will first need to define product, and we will begin by writing a formal definition of product.\n\nA formal definition of a product is that a product is a set of numbers multiplied together.\n\nIt is important to remember what each term means. Let's use math to explain some of this.\nThe first number we would multiply together, we will call this number 'a'. The multiplier will be called 'b', and the last number we will multiply together will be called 'c'. If I wanted to multiply these values together, my new set of numbers will look something like this: \n2*5*3 = 30 \n\nBecause of this, if a*b*c is the multiplication we performed, it is also called the product of a *b*c.\n\nTo complete our definition of the product, we need to specify what kind of thing we are calling a 'product' to describe what is being multiplied.\n\nWe can call a product, a set of numbers that we multiply together. The set of numbers that we are multiplying together, it means that they are not just one big number, but a collection of different number that come in a set.\n\nThis definition is going to be critical when we come to multiplying multiple values at the same time. It has also introduced the concept of a set that we may use as a product.\nThe reason that we do not just call the numbers that are multiplied together something like product numbers, is because even though the product of some numbers like 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 is 720, this number itself is not a product. \nA single number cannot be called a product. \nIt is only when we multiply multiple number together, that we can call them a product.\n\nNow with this knowledge, the input to this question will be simpler.\nFirst, I assume that when the people were trying to answer this question, they did not know much formal math at the time and did not know what a multiplication was.\nAs you can see on the input to this question, we have numbers that are going to be multiplied, which I suspect will lead to the answer being either 'E' or 'D'.\nSecond, I also believe that this question would have been answered by a farmer who lived in Washington at the time.\nHowever", "answer": "D: canada"}
{"text": "Choices: A and B\nSo the correct answer is A and B\n\nInput:Tapanga and Corey share 50 candy bars. However, Corey has 40% more. \n\n  Input Output: If they're equal, a Corey has more than Tapanga because percentages of candy bars is 40%, which means Corey has half more than Tapanga, so if Corey has candy bars, he has half of them of Tapanga's, but Tapanga also has half of the shared candy bars, which means she also has half, but Corey has a little more because he has 40%, then he has half of the shared candies. So, Corey has more than half of the shared candys, which means he has more than half the candy bars of Tapanga.\n\nInput:Choices: The number of students who attend school on a daily basis is typically less than the the number of students who attend at least? \nOutput:Choices : A, B, C\nSo the correct answer choices are A, B, and C\nInput:If the sum of three numbers is 25, then the median is 12.\n\nInput Output:If the median is 11, and the sum of the numbers is 28.\nLet the numbers be a, b, and c. Then, the sum of a, b, and 28 is 103.\nTo make it to a median of 11, we need a third number with this value.\n  Thus, the third number must be 28.\n  The other options could also be true,\n    however, the statement \" Then the sum of the numbers will be 35.\" is incorrect for the third number to be 28. 35 is not a median at all, because the sum of a,b,c will be exactly twice the median. \n  Also, 25 is halfway between 20 and 5. The median is not 15. \nSo the other answers are correct", "answer": "C: injury"}

For example, the first step determines whether it is a number or not. If it is, then it continues with the second step.If it is not, it will return False. In this way, the recursion continues until it is a number, and returns True.\n\n### Instuction:Describe recursion in your own words.\n\nSolution by recursion means to call a function from inside that very function.

If the price of candy remained the same, and the package size remains the same, what would the price per gram be today?\nOutput: To find the answer to this problem, we will first have to determine if the money supply has increased or decreased over time.

{"text": "A parking lot in a shopping mall has many shopping bags.\nIt is very easy to pick someone's bag and then leave the store where the person is shopping.\nFor example, a person has a very heavy shopping bag on a cold day and he has a small child who is very heavy because he feels cold.\nThen a person who does not see any bags in the parking lot is asked to look after some bags for him and he leaves the parking lot near the shopping mall.\n\nInput:How do you make 15 from 18?\nOutput:There are several ways to make 15 from the digits on the left of 18; however, all the correct choices are shown below,\na simple way to do this is to take the first two numbers from the right of the decimal point and subtract them from the number to the left of 15.\nThe second number is less than the first.\nSince the second number is less than 15, it is subducted from the first, resulting in a subtraction of two numbers and a difference of 18.\n\nInput:What is the remainder of 17 divided by 6?\nOutput:The result is 17 is 0 mod 6.\nThe remainder of 6 is 0 times the divisor, 17.\nSince 0 time any nonnegative number is the same number, the result is zero.The remainder of 6 will always be 0 modulo any positive number.For example, the remainder for 12 is 2.\nThe number 12 is divided by 6 with remainder 2 as the dividend.The quotient and remainder for 12 are 2 and 2 respectively.\nThis example can be applied to a number that exceeds 6, and it still retains the exact result.\n\nInput:3.03 divided by 0\nOutput:The quotient will be 0 when divided by 0.You can find out the remainder after finding the product.\nHowever, it is better to not find the quotient and product, but look at the division by zero as one in which the quotient is 0 and the rest has no value.\nThe expression you want is:\n0 = <3.03/0>0\nSince the remainder (quotient) is zero,", "answer": "D: shopping malls"}

However, a few days later he said that they would be able to spend twice as much, or $50 million to create the self-driving vehicle. Was $25 million less than 2 times the $50 million? Choices: <<yes=yes>>\nA: yes\nB: no\nC: can't be determined\nD: no\nOutput: It would be more than 2 time the $50 million, so it is correct to choose <<yes>> for this question.\n\n\n\n### Instruction:Answer the multiple choice questions below.\n\nInput:You want to know where you need to workout and what exercise you should be doing. Let your index value represent the number of miles that you walked, your x value represent the exercise that you need to perform, and your y value represent how you feel while working out. How many miles do you have to walk to feel like you are working out a lot?\nOutput: Let p = the number of miles that a person has to walk to feel like they are working out a lot.\np + 1 = the number of exercise that the person needs to have performed to feel like they are really working out hard.

One of them is indentation. Although, codecademy does a good job of showing you good indentation, I struggled with it in my program. I had to be sure to indent the code correctly and there were times where the indentation did not display correctly due to me forgetting to hit enter. Secondly, I struggled when I was working on the program involving the book prices. I couldn't find a way to tell if a price was more than others because there was not a  way to make more than one line of code.  So that is why I wrote a program that would allow for me to not write so much code. Thirdly, when I wrote the question involving music. I struggled when it came to explaining that it is hard to judge the taste in music. Because although someone likes music I don't know if they like the same type of music.

{"text": "C) In order to fit his three bikes and car, James needs a garage. So the answer is C.\n\n### Instruction:Answer the multiple choice question.\nInput:The sum of 8 and 2 is greater than the sum of 19 and 16. How old are James and Jhon? Choices: 2: James = 4 and Jhon = 12 3: James = 7 and Jhon = 8 4: James = 8 and Jhon = 6 5: James = 8 ans Jhon = 4\nOutput: The second rule is the rule of order in which we multiply numbers. It states that when we multiply two sets of numbers to obtain a sum, any numbers in the same place will be added together first. If the same rules of addition are used in the process of multiplication, then we are following the rule of order. So the answer has to be option 4, James = 8 ans = 4 and Jhope = 8 ans =6, hence the correct answer is 8 ans = 6. \n\n### Instructions:Please answer these questions based on the given graph.\nInput: What is the minimum value of ___? Choices:  -17  -12  -6  -2\nOutput: The rule of elimination, which implies that all negative numbers are subtracted, can be used in a graph. -2 is the negative number, and it is smaller than -6, so -2 is subtracted.  The same procedure is done for further negative numbers, until the graph becomes flat. However, only the negative numbers on the graph are removed. As such, -17 is removed. But the difference between -12 and -6 is less than the difference between -17 and -12, so -6 is subtracted. -8 is less than -2, so -8 is subtracted.  -2 is the negative of x, while -2 is less than -4, so  the latter is added up to the former. Thus, -2 is added up.  -3 is greater than -2, so no operation is performed on it.  -4 is not less than -5 and so no operation is performed. So the final answer is -4.\n\nInput: In what year did the American Revolutionary War occur? Choices:", "answer": "E: car"}

{"text": "### Solution:\nThis question is asking you to interpret word problems on the basis of the given rules. The easiest way to do this is to write down and follow a list of steps.\n\n1. Read the problem.\n\n2. Identify the operators.\n\n3. Create a truth table.\n\n4. Solve for the output based on the rules\n  \n   The truth table for an AND operation is a two column table where each row contains True and False.\n   Each column corresponds with the truth value for the logical operation applied.\n   To find the truth value corresponding to an output, evaluate the row for that output.\n    \n   For the input, Tapanga and Core have 66 together. However, Tangerine has 8 more than Corey.\n    \n   The operators in this statement are AND, as in \"AND also\". \n    \n   You will write this statement in the truth table like so:\n    \n   P(x) = P(x) \\rightarrow P(x) = x\n    y = y \\rightarrow x\n    \n    \nIf you remember the symbol for AND, it would be an intersection.\n\n   You can follow the same method for any logical operation. (See lesson on logical operators.)\n\n   The statement that is used to find an expression is:\n   P(exprA) = exprA \\to P(exprN).\n   \n        \n      Example: Let x = the amount of candies Corey gets.\n      T = the amount of candis Corey gets.\n       The candies between them when combined  - 72.\n      T + x = 72\n      And x = <<29 = 29\n        \n  T + (x + 29) = 72\n  Therefore:  T =  43", "answer": "E: row boat"}

{"text": "Answer to A\n\nInput:Tapanga eats the most at breakfast and lunch, but Corey eats the most at dinner, \nwhen do they eat the \nmost? \nOutput: Answer to D\n\nInput:A man buys 844 cookies, 314 brownies, and 872 chocolate bars.\nWhat will you need to buy in order to have 559 cookies, 292 brownies, and 676 chocolate bars? \nOutput: Let x be the number of cookies, y be the number of brownies and z be the number of chocolate bars\nx + 836 = 559\ny + 314 = 292\nz + 872 = 676\nThe equation for the number of cookies is x + (x - 836) = 559.\nCombining like term, we get x = (559 - 836)/312. Dividing both sides by two, we get x = 123\nThe equation for the brownies is y + (y - 314) = 292. Combining like terms,we get (y - 300)/3 = 292/3 = 97\nThe equation for the chocolate is z + (z - 872) = 676. Combining like term,we get z = (676 - 872)/3 = - 182/3 = -61\nSo we end up with 299 cookies, 7 cookies and -61 chocolate bars\n\nInput:If a house has 252 square feet on the first floor, how many more square feet does it have on the second floor?\nOutput:Let x be the number of square feet we have on the second floor, y be the number or square feet we have on our first floor.\nWe have x = y + 1983 square feet.\nWe have 1983 + x = 252\nWe end up getting X = 4193\nSo the house has 2313 square feet to our second floor.", "answer": "D: headache"}

The first response is an electrochemical response that will stimulate several brain cells so their nerve endings release acetylcholine, a chemical messenger. Acetylcholine is an excitatory chemical called a neurotransmitter. It travels to another nerve ending, and another one is activated by it.  This activated nerve connection stimulates another nerve in our brain called the \"cortical\" nerve or the word nerve, because it is the place where words and the meaning of words are processed, our cortex.\n\nChoices A and D don't seem to fit, so we can safely eliminate them.

This is called manual checking.\n\\item If you have the patience and you don't mind the risk/reward ratio, you could write a full-blown program (or app) including a GUI (Graphical User Interface) that asks questions (inputs) from the user, and on each question it prints the answer (for correct questions or incorrect for incorrect ones) and repeats it as long as the user wants the app to keep asking questions until the app asks 1 more question than times the user wants the app ask the questions. When the input is \"end\", the program ends itself. You could also include the GUI by using Tkinter for Python. Tkinter GUIs look better than some of the GUIs written by VB or some other language because of the Tcl/Tk \"glue code\" that makes Tkinter GUIs work.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe \"risk\" of manual checking is that it only tests the candidate solution to the question but not the original question.

{"text": "The correct answer is A. We all know that age is the leading cause of death, followed closely by accidents, suicide, murder, and finally, old age. Even when a person is grieving over the loss of a loved one, their immune system can be strong enough to fight off minor viruses and ailments brought on that stress. Therefore, the best way to prevent someone from dying is to deal with their grief quickly and effectively. With grief treatment, it would be difficult for a victim to have a complete mental breakdown or to feel like they want to commit suicide or murder. This would significantly reduce their grieving and decrease their risk of causing death by suicide or murder. Even if grieving gets worse, there are still methods available to help prevent that person from killing themselves or another person.\nAnswer Choices: A, B, C, D, E\nCorrect Answer: A: age grieving\nAnswer Explanation:\nThe correct answer among all the choices is A: Age Grieving. This is because grieving may have a bad effect on a person\u2019s well-being and health as they age, they could be at risk for various kinds of diseases and have a harder time healing themselves from those diseases. For people who aren\u2019t old, grief can also affect them greatly. People who are already stressed out or emotionally depressed from other things may find themselves even more depressed when faced with something as hard-hitting as the death of one\u2019s loved one. The stress could also lead to the death of loved ones who are already weak because they aren\u2019t healthy. The stress could cause health problems as well. For people who aren't old, grieving could cause a lot of mental damage just from the emotional strain of being stressed out or overwhelmed.\n\nIt is important to treat both mental health and physical health problems immediately so that they do not lead us down into a downward spiral of depression and death from stressful situations.\n\n*\nExamples:", "answer": "B: heart attacks"}

Output: For this type of problem, you have three variables: $$x$$, $$y$$, and $$z$$ and $$n$$, which is an unknown. To find $n$, it's helpful to make the equation less complicated.  Let $x = 2$ and rewrite the equation: $$z - y = n - 2$$  Now $n$ is in front of $x$, which you can solve for $n$ by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation: $$n = z - 2 - y$$ To solve for $y$, you can use the above equation to rewrite the equation, and solve for $y$: $$2 = z - 2 + n$$  Solve this equation for $z$: $$z = 7$$ Next, since there is a letter in the equation such as: $$z$$, you need to subtract the $z$$ from the equation to get $y$ alone: $$-z = -7 + n$$  To solve for $y$ alone, subtract 7 from both sides of the equations: $$y = n - 7$$ This gives you, $$7 = n - 7\\\\ n = 7$$ Since there is an even number of $y$'s in the equation, you know the order doesn't matter so you can combine the two equations: $$-z = n - 7\\iff -24 = n - 7 $$ Now, $z = 24$.

But the speed of the vehicle only gives information about how fast it is moving in a certain direction.

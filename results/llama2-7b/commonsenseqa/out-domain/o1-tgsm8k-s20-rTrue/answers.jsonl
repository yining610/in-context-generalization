Then 20x0.25 is 5.\nSince 5 is below 10, then 8x0.75 is 5.5 rounded up, which is 6.\n\nThis is because 10x0.75 would equal 7.5, and you cannot cut 0.5 in half, so you are putting 0.25 again into the system.\n\n### Input_Answer: What are 8 and 4 in 20?\n\n8 and 4 in a unit of 20 are 8 and 12, so 20 divided by 8 is 2.5 and 25 divided by 4 is 6.\nTherefore, 8 and 4 are 6 and 12 in 20.\n\n---------------------------------------\n### Demonstatrion: Input: The ratio 2:3.

{"text": "C\nRationales: A: You might think that stress and debates are competitive things. However, these are the things you tend to have before and during a competition. Competitions don't typically cause stress or debates.\nB: These things have nothing to do with competitions. Debates don't often result in a \"win or lose\" and tension doesn't typically increase during a competition. Stress, arguments, and debates are typically caused by people who aren't competing. You wouldn't have an argument between two football players, or while both of them are running in sync. Stress, fights, and debates are arguments between two people.\nC: You are correct that competition causes arguments, fights, and tension\nD: This isn't a competition thing that happens. You may argue and/or fight with someone before you find out you're competing against them. You could become upset about having to compete against someone. However, in the actual competition, you won't be concerned with winning or losing, but rather winning. A competitor typically cares more about winning than they care about losing.\nE: Competitions aren't tense by themselves.

Also, there is also a word has, so something must have been given to the snake. If there is anything that the snake had for breakfast then there is the definite article \u201cthe\u201d. So the snake had something that is not specified, most likely the snake was given an apple as it is different from the common breakfast for pythons.\n\n### Eviation:If the snake does not have a different breakfast, it will not have a different lunch as there is no definite article with the words breakfast and lunch. Without a definite article, we can assume that there is nothing special in its diet.\n\n### Answer:Yes. There are only two types of articles in the English Language: the and a.

{"text": "You are correct.\n\n### Rationale:\nLet us use the formula V = (10 \u00f7 k)(k \u00d7 k), that is volume (V) = k (x \u00d7 x), where k and x are natural numbers. The input asks us to find the smallest k, not V, for the given numbers. To do so, we want to find the smallest x of this set.\n\n```\n\n```\n\n### We can start by noting that 10 is the least natural number 10 that will form a valid volume - that is, it is the least natural number in this set. 10 = 102. And so k = 10.\n\n- Since volume is a product, the x = x2 is the key to our equation. Thus the smallest x in this set is less than 16.\n\n- We want to use as many k\u2019s and x\u2019s as we can. We can take any number for x < 16 and have a valid product. This is because if you multiply by a small x, such as 2, the volume is still 10. Therefore, even though the product will be less, it will still be a valid volume (assuming k remains stable). However, once x is 16 and the product changes to something larger, the product does no longer remain a valid volume. Thus k must 10 or less.\n\n- When x begins to approach 16, the product will get closer and closer to being 10 cubed. As soon as this happens, volume will no longer be 10 x cubed. If x is 16, then a=4.91563; if x is 17, a=5.09520; etc. Therefore, volume will no longer equal 10 (a=5.20031 for x = 28 and greater).\n\n- Therefore, the maximum x is 16.\n``` \n\n### 16, and 10 = 210, which is a valid volume.\n\n\n- The question, though, is about a minimum product, not a maximum, so the answer is \u201cD\u201d.", "answer": "E: procrastination"}

Therefore, you need to figure out what the phrase entails in order to select the correct answer. (A) A: driving shows that when you move a car, you either are in the car or drive it. You can then cross out B and D, because you cannot be in the car or drive the car by yourself without someone else. The answer also implies that you are tired from driving the car if you are driving for long periods of time. You can then cross off the last choice E because this reason does not make sense. This leaves you with A and C. In the sentence, it does not say anything about getting a ticket, only driving, not being tired and getting into a car, which you would be when you are driving.

{"text": "B\n#### Response\nYour answer is correct.\n#### Rationales:\nIn order to explain your thinking, you should write a paragraph that does the following:\nFirst, provide at least three reasons why you feel the answer is correct. It must be detailed with specifics from the text to support your claim.\nNext, explain the evidence from the text that you found to support your answer.\n#### Paragraph\nDinner is the main meal of the day. It is meant to provide ample nutrition in a single meal. However, eating too much dinner is likely to result in stomach ache or illness. The evidence from the text that supports this answer is from my parents. They always eat dinner at approximately the same time and usually in large portions. So, they eat a very large portion of the food at once. This results in stomach aches at the end of the evening. This is the probable cause for their stomach aches. There are several other reasons why eating too much results in a stomach ache. \nIn my personal experience, I have eaten too much before and gotten severe stomach aches that last several hours. My symptoms from eating too much were a pain in my abdomen, loss of appetite, feeling lethargic, and sleeping to help me not feel the pain anymore. I also felt bloating in my stomach. Eating too much or eating at the wrong time has been known to cause acid reflux. Acid reflux is caused by the stomach acid flowing backwards and burning the esophagus. Eating too much will cause your stomach to expand and can cause the burning sensation of acid reflux. \nEating too much can also cause you to burn more calories digesting the food over the next day or so. For example, after an excessively large Thanksgiving dinner, you can expect to sleep for almost 12 hours. This is because you body will be consuming too much food. Ingesting too much food and not allowing enough rest will result in illness. The other body parts will become overloaded and will eventually get sick.\nHonestly, I would not eat too much. It is not pleasant to begin eating the food but when you see how delicious it is and how hungry you feel, the", "answer": "C: stomach ache"}

However I will answer the second statement with no, that does not sound plausible.\n\n#### 3.\n\n###Rationales:I will write the steps first then rational and then the rational.\n\nStep 1: Write it out, I like to write everything out first then add explanation after. So write out \"I am a dog and I have a bone.\"\n\nStep 2: Now rewrite \"I am a dog\", \"I am a dog\" is I am. Then rewrite \"and I have a bone\", and I have a bones would sound right. Then rewrite \"I am a I have a dog\", I am I a dog would sound weird but I am I have a bone sounds weird. It would sound like I am a I am I have a dog. Rewriting \"I like to write\", \"I like to write it out\" would sound right so rewrite that too I write it out.\n\nStep 3: Now that you rewrote everything then write and explain it all. So if I write \"I am a dog, and I have a bong.\" is what I write out. So writing and then explaining is, \"I am a dog. And I have a bone. I like to write out everything. I like not to have a bone and then explain it.\"\n\nSo, rational is we rewrote \"I am a dog I have a bone I like to write,\" which means when you read it, it is \"I am a dog a bone like to write.\" You do not want to say \"I am a dog the bone I like to\" because it doesn't sound right. Like \"I am that I am a bone I like I like to write.\"\nSo rational is don't say \"I am a bone I\" because it sounds weird. So my rational is, \"I am writing out what I said in the beginning is rational.

This is because they must have been virtual copies in the same place as him. But, then if my theory was true, he should not have a dog. His only dog would be a computer program that simulates one.

If we use the definition of the word cabin, a vacation home can be referred to as a cabin as well. Since villas are upscale vacation homes, it is not a good choice.

{"text": "A\n\n### Rationale:\nLet us first start off with the first part because that's the hardest part to solve for.\n\nThe first part is that: We can't say that it is a rug of Persia since the subject is the mother and we do not know if she is from Persia. Therefore, we rule that out.\n\nWe can't say it is a living room rug because, as I said, we don't know if the mother is Persian.\n\nDespite this, we have to eliminate the other options.\n\nFor example, the table cannot be a rug for the living room because we said that the mother was worried about the spill. Also, a Persian rug and a living room rug look nothing alike and would be very hard to tell apart,\n\nTherefore, we are left with the other two options: a rug under the desk and a rug under the house. I know you might think that I am lying about under the house, but I am not. I am not just saying it under the house and here's why.\n\nWhen someone is walking in their house, they don't step on the rug that is underneath the house. They step on the rug in the living room.\n\nAnd also, if someone is walking on a rug under the house, they are going to clean that very quickly. When someone is walking on a living room rug, or a table rug, then they may decide not to clean it for a while because they are going to walk on that rug a lot.\n\nTherefore the answer is under the house.", "answer": "B: table"}

{"text": "Detailed Rationales:\nThe answer is D, because someone has to like learning to go through the process of education.\nSomeone who does not like to learn will not care about what they learn. They will also likely not even pay attention in the classes.\nWhen a teacher tries to make their class interesting, a student who does not like learning will become bored and their learning will go downhill.\nIt would also not be painful or joyful for someone to not like to learn. If you do not like learning, then you would probably not care about if you get a grade on an assignment.\nSomeone who is learning is learning something new. They will care about what they are learning.\n\n### Input 2: What is the answer, and why?\n\n### Rationales:\n\nThis answer is B, because it is fun instead of enjoyable. Enjoyable is something that means that someone will like to do it. Fun is the same as enjoyable, but also includes doing fun things that one does for joy.\n\n### Detailed Rationale:\n\n#### If you do something for joy, then you will like to do it, so joy means the same thing as fun.\n#### Someone does things for fun, so enjoyable means they do things for joy.\n#### Joyful is different because it means happiness while you do something. It means enjoying the same thing that enjoyable and fun do, but it is different because one is having fun while they are doing it, and the other one is having fun and enjoying it.\n\n### What would you change the learning to be if someone does like learning?\n\n#### 0\nAnswer: 0\n\n### Instructions \n\nWrite the numbers that are in parentheses without writing anything else.\n\n#### 9 (3 x 3 = 9 )\nAnswer: 3\n\n#### 2 (3 \u00f72 = 2)\nAnswer: 3 \u00f72 = (1.5)\n\n#### -32 (9 x (8-9) = -32 )\nAnswer: (9 x (-1)) = -9\n\n#### 11 (5 x 2 \n\n### I'm Done\n\n- [x] Write the numbers that are in the parenthesis.

It is sometimes called panic breathing and it can also make you feel dizzy or faint.\n\n#### Rationale:A, B, and E are all inaccurate. A is a verb-form of the word living instead of the adjective. B is an inaccurate adjective because what is being done is not an action, but rather a state of being. C does not accurately describe the situation. There is no need for the person to hyperventilate because it is not needed. D is also not an accurate answer. The phrase \"look around\" does not describe \"breathing deeply,\" and the word deeply cannot be used to replace \"deeper.\" Furthermore, the phrase \"in the mountains\" limits the possibility to \"in the city\" or \"in the ocean,\" so it cannot be used to replace deeper.\n\n\\### Rationale Two:\n\n### Input A: What is the main purpose of ads?\n\n### Rationale A:\n\n### Reliability of ads:\n\n### D: 1/4\n\n### E: 1/4 (somewhat reputable)\n\n### F: 1/4  (partially trustworthy)\n\n### G: 1/4 unreliable\n\n* Rationale A:Ads, whether through a social setting (for example, walking past a display in the mall) or via the internet (such as a website or social media platform), will persuade you to buy a product.\n\n* *Rationale 2:*Advertisements are only accurate if you are willing to consider what they are saying.

{"text": "If you have to ask this question, you have a pretty simple answer: The closet, or E.\n\n#### Choice C\nIf you were to buy your clothes at the laundromat, you'd be buying the least amount of clothing in absolute terms. Socks are a commodity, which means their value does not go down over time. Socks aren't a good choice for being bought at the laundroma, unless you only get about six pairs and your socks only get about six wears before going into the wash. And jeans, of course, are only meant to be washed periodically or have the holes in them widened. Of course, you still need to buy _some_ socks and so _some_ kind of jeans if you have to wear clothes of either or both types.\n\nSo the only good choices are A and E. If you want to save some money, I suppose D is an option. Just don't start wondering why you're shopping for clothes in a place where you're sourcing your old clothes.\n\n\n### Input/Output Table:\n\n| Input | Output | Instruction |\n|:-----|:-------|:-----------|\n| A | The closest laundromat is 1 block east on the other side of the street.  | Choice A |\n| B | Look for jeans by the washing machines. | Choice B |\n| C | The next clothing store is too far.| Choice C |\n| D | The store has lots of clothes, but not the socks or jeans you want. | Choice D |\n| E | The closest place with lots of clothes is the shopping mall. | Choice E |\n\n### Input-Only Table:\n\n| Choice | What do you notice about the choice? |\n|:-----:|---------------------------------------|\n| Choice D | The store only has socks/jeans |\n| Choice E | All the stores have clothes |\n\n#### 2\n\n> Choice D\n\n### Answer to Input/Output Table:|Answer to Input-Only Table:|\n\n### Input to Input/Output Table (from Instruction):\nAnswer the following multiple choice questi\u2026\n\n### Divergent response to Input/Output", "answer": "C: clothing store"}

The diameter of the 38 mm screwwas 63.8 mm and the wrench had the same diameter. How many mm did the nut unscrew the screw head?\n\nRationales:\nIf the head is 38 mm, the nut only needs to be 32 mm or less to fit onto the head\nThe wrench needs to have the same diameter as the nut.\nThe 6mm wrench must fit onto the nut\nAdditional information:  (I) = (Screw Head Diameter) + (Nut Diameter)  = (38) + (6) = 44\n(II) = (Screwed Diameter of 38MM)-(Numer of screw diameter in the nut))  = (63.8-6) = 57.8.\nThe distance of (1) mm is the distance of the nut to remove the screw head. If the nut is 32 mm, the width of 32 is removed from 63.8 to create 57.8, which proves that the nut is 38 + (32-63.8) = 38 + (0.0455) = 38.0455 mm (3 mm). The size of the nut is equal to the width of the wrench of 6mm.

{"text": "Bald eagles live in open country and open skies. Their feathers are not designed for warmth, and are instead designed for aerodynamic efficiency. The bald eagle\u2019s prey is located by watching for its movements, or in other words, by sight.\nGiven the bald eagles primary food source is fish, its not surprising it prefers to live and hunt in the open country and open skys. One of their most common prey items is the common murre, which travels in flocks that frequent open skys.\n\n### Rationales\n\n\n\nThe correct answer is Bald. It is safe for bald eagles to nest at a higher altitude than most birds since they are adapted to hunt for their meals by sight. Additionally, the bald eagle prefers to live and nest in open country, as they are prey animals and rely on sight to stalk their prey of fish and other small birds. Additionally, bald eagles are found mostly in North America and are endangered in the lower 48 of the United States, meaning that they are rare.\n\n### Input\n> Question: How does the population of a species change over time?\n\n\n### Response\nThe population of a species grows or shrinks over time. A growing population means the species\u2019 population is increasing. It may die due to various factors including famine, disease, migration/relocation, or other changes in the surrounding environment. This change may be sudden or slow, depending on the situation. When the population shrinks in size, the species' population is depleting. This may also happen as the population grows beyond its carrying capacity. When a population grows, it is said to be in positive population growth. As for when the population shrinks, it is referred to as negative population growth. \n\n### Rationale\nThe population of a living organism can change either in growing or shrinking and this phenomenon is caused by multiple factors ranging from a change in the availability of food, migration/relocation and death. An organism\u2019s population can fluctuate or even become extinct due to these changes in environment.\n\n### References\n[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032078X13005295?via%", "answer": "D: wildlife refuge"}

Keep a running total for the sum of these numbers. Once you add a new number to the running total you keep adding the next number to the end of the running total.\n\n#### Note:\n1. Create an array. Each element in an array represents a different number.\n2. Create an output variable (double) that will keep track of the sum of the first 5 numbers\n3. Create a for loop that will add one element on each iteration of the loop.

There are not enough resources to feed the planet with current population levels. We may have to turn to fish farming or to eating insects.\nWhich one of the following options will feed more people?\n\nA) Farming more fish B) Eating farmed insects C) Both are equal D) Eating fish\n\n### Respond\nSince farmed fish are raised in artificial conditions, such as a saltwater pond or fish tank, it is more expensive than free ranging fish. Farmers who raise fish have to make use of the same amount of resources, but must raise more fish to make the same amount of profit. When it comes to eating insects, such as cicadas or crickets, it is unclear if enough protein can be provided if people consumed a sufficient amount. Furthermore, insects are not an option in most parts of the world, either because they are not a staple food or because they do not exist at all. This leaves farming fish, due to the ease and large potential amount of fish the farmer can raise, as the best option to feed more people.\n\n### Input:\"We'd like to go back and buy that shirt.

Each of the tasks are worth a certain amount of points of money and are based on the percentage of work done.  For example, if I work 50% on the project and I\u2019m in the engineering department, my salary will be 50% of the salary that is awarded to the other department.  In order to calculate the percentage of work in a specific area, the individual adds 1 if they work in that department and 0 if they don\u2019t.  For example, an engineer named Sam works for this specific company.  He is a software engineer and he has never worked in the mechanical department.

However, I can make a mean breakfast only for 3.5 of my family members.  If I wanted to make breakfast for 4, how many times would I have to divide my original recipe?\n### Response: you should divide 2(x)\n\n### Input -  Let\u2019s use an analogy to explain the situation.  Let\u2019s say you have a bucket (or a glass) of water and the goal is to divide it into 5 equal portions (3 for 3, or 2 for 2).  First we divide the water in half, or half-and-half.  Then, you take one half and add the same amount of sugar, which doubles the amount of water.  Now it takes four equal portions of water to divide in half.  So, divide it into four, and then the 4 equal portions are divided into 2.  How is this possible?\n### Response - You have to divide by 2\n\n### Input \u2013 I\u2019m looking for an ice-flavored drink for my family.

A job offer can be an attractive option, especially because your new company offers a great salary, a health insurance package, and stock options.

Which bus should Ali take to go to the party if she wants to arrive on time, and then take the bus that will get her home the fastest?\n\n### Response :\n\nBus B would be the best bus to take. The reason for this is because bus B takes Ali longer to get home.

Choices: A: bus B B: bus C C: bus D D: bus A(bus A cannot be the correct answer)\n\n### Comments:\nBus A cannot be correct because buses A and B have the same duration of time.

{"text": "In this particular example, Hurley is 11 years old and Richard is 30 years old. They are going to be 40 years old in 40 years. Hurley is going to be 14 years old. To find the combined ages of Hurley and Richard, we will subtract 11 from 40. We can then solve this question by multiplying the 20 difference in ages with 14, which provides us an answer of 280. This does not add up because they are going to be 10 years older than the Hurley is today, since Hurley is going to turn 15 in 40 years, which means that 10 years later this year will be 30 years from now. Hence, the combined ages are correct because they are going to turn 30 years old at 40 years old.  Therefore, Hurley\u2019s combined ages are 27 years old and Richard\u2019s combined ages are going to turn 46 years old at 42 years old when Hurley\u2019s going to turn 51 years old.\n\n### Input\uff1a\nPablo\u2019s mother agrees Pablo is going to read 150 books. Pablo will buy at least 150 books, and will collect his money. He plans to save for $15 worth of $150 candy and has $3 saved. How many books will Pablo have read?\nTo solve this question, we can start by first setting our equations equal to one another. We can state the following equation:\n$$150 + \\left(\\frac{\\$15 \\times $150}{15}\\right) = \\$$\nTo solve this equation, we will perform subtraction and isolate the variable $b$. The values we will be using are $15$ for the value of $x$, $15$ for $n$, and $0.1$ for $p$. We will then subtract $7$ from both sides. We can then isolate the variable $p$. That provides us with $7 < p \\le 24$. We can use the information available to us, and multiply $7$ with $100$ to provide us with an interval 120 to 240. We can use the lower number 120, and add or subtract an element. We then", "answer": "D: pond"}

He charges $21 for an oil change.  How much oil does the shop have to purchase in one month to fill all the cars' oil tanks?\n\n### Response 2: 44 gallons\n\n### Output\n```\nThe task that was asked was how many gallons of oil was needed.\n\nSo here are three ways to solve this:\n* $12/gallon = 15,482 miles, so you'd need to buy 12/gallons (not 15,417 gallons but 15482 gallons.)\n* The shop needs to buy 1, 9, 49 gallon cans\n* If every person drives 16,000 miles, then multiply that by 15, so it's 240,000 miles. Divide 240, 000 miles by 16, 000, which gives you 15. So if each car is driven 16,024 miles, then the shop would need to purchase 12 more gallons.\n```\nAnd the most correct one was the last one because it's the most effective way of using the given information (the shop serves 16,0 000  miles per month.)\n\n```\nThe task I was asked was what number are doubled. You could go by the name but just in case of spelling errors you might want to go by the number like this 1 16879 and if you double it you get 33758 and then you want to make it perfect square so you need to multiply it by itself. So if you multiply it by 81  then you will get 7 9 79  79 24 566\n```\n\n```\nThe first step to solving this one is to multiply the numbers to know how many digits are needed: 1.001 *.001 =.000999.

The activity of gathering pollen can also be seen around a beehive, which we refer to the activity of the bees as \u201cgathering around\u201d.

If the lizards noise does not scare the hiker, then the lizard will surprise the hiker with a lizard. If a hiker makes a lot of noise when they are scared, then the lizard is less likely to surprise the hiker. If the hiker is carrying a backpack, then the chance that the hiker will make a lot of noise when scared is 90%, otherwise the chance is 80%. What are the odds that the lizard will surprise a hiker?\n\n### Input\n\nInput: This math challenge was inspired by the story The Lizard Problem at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zQwNqQ6qJQ. The rules are simple.  You can use a lizard to create as much chaos as possible by only one thing: leaving a trail of blood. The lizard can only leave a trail of blood if it eats humans, but it is only 10% likely to do it.  Lizards are always looking for an opportunity to escape their predators but must always keep in mind their predator is a human. A lizard can hear a human calling their name and become scared, but the best way to find a lizard is to look for a dark trail of blood.

Choices: 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 31\n\n### Instractor:\nIn order to solve a Rubik\u2019s cube, you have to do quite a few things to put it back together.  One of these many things is rotating each side of the cube before putting it back together again.  When you are turning the Rubik\u2019s cube you have 12 sides and there is a piece on the right side of each side.  If you don\u2019t rotate each side, then you won\u2019t be able to determine which side needs to rotate.  Therefore, when you have turned all 12 sides, you should have 12 pieces that need to rotate in the opposite direction.\n\n### Answer-4: The value of the square is $77/2$\n\n### Instrectorer:\nFirst, we must find two values of the $5\\times5$ square (and the other squares).", "answer": "D: more funding"}

{"text": "The only valid answer is B.\n\n### Explanation:A is incorrect because orchestras also contain bassoons. Also, symphonies contain many bassoons. B is correct because playing a bassoon in an unpleasing way would only be possible in a musical group where woodwinds are commonly played such as a baritone woodwind or a student performance group. C is incorrect because a symphony is an entire piece of music that an orchestra or other musical group performs and a bassoon is only one note in the music, so no piece would be bad like that. C is incorrect because this is not the purpose of a bassoon. D is incorrect because this would either describe a high school band performance or it would describe a performance that was done badly such as a high school band performance.\n\n### Input:(Takes 1.5 minutes for 10 people to eat at a restaurant.) A: 10 minutes B:15 minutes C: 120 (ten times ten) minutes D: 5 minutes E: 11 minutes\n\n### Response:(11 minutes - Correct Answer)\n\n### Explination:\n\nTen times ten is 100, but one minute is 60 seconds (0.1 x 60 = 6 minutes), so 10 x 10 would equal 60 minutes. A is incorrect because 10 x 60 is 600 seconds, and 10 x 5 is 50, not 100. B is incorrect, since 10 x 360 equals 3,600 seconds, which is 60 minutes. C is incorrect because 120 is not correct. D is incorrect because 5 x 100 is 100 while 5 x 3 is 15, not 50. E is correct because the wait time is 666 seconds.\n\n### Example Solutions: (Write one line of solution like this)\n\nWhen John, Samuel, Mark, and George went to a restaurant they ate for 10 minutes each.

How many people were at the dinning table?\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe problem is to find the number of people because the candy can was divided evenly among them. If the family has 16 boxes.  The first box of candy canes is free of price.  The price of the 1st box was already paid and they received it for free.  That way we find that we get 1/16 of the candy canes.  It means that there is (1/16 )16 boxes of cake. They did not have 16 boxes of free candy canes. And that means there is 16 - (1/16)16 or (3/16)12.  It means that for the price of one candy cane, you have received 3 candies.  That means (1-3/16) 16 = (16 - 2/16) = 15.  The 15th candy cane was free.\n\n### Input  :There are 16 boxes of ice cream.

The variable i has the value of 5 when it is first declared. If then i++ 5 times, this would be written as i+=5 5 times. So what this means is increase with 5 first, then 5 times, then 5 times again, and so on. The variable gets incremented by 5 each time the operator i++ is used, i.e. gets increased by 5 each time. In the second example, i-- means decrement. To be clear, this means to reduce the value of i by 1 each time the operator ++ is used, i. e. to reduce it by 1 each time, which is the opposite of i++.\n\n### The if condition\n\nThe if expression (example a=5) is a comparison. This means it is testing if something is X. This can either be A=5, B=5, C=5, or it can be == A==5==, === B===5===, or???. If the if statement is A=5, we can see that if a=5, then this is true, as it is equal to 5.

{"text": "D\n\nIce fishing can also be done surprisingly far from shore, provided there is just enough open water around an underwater ice shelf. In 1983, a group of scientists discovered a winter fishing camp nearly 50 miles from shore, which has since been named the Bodies of Water Lake Camp. The camp includes an ice shelf, a fishing tent, and a wooden fire place that's been used more than once for barbecues.\n\n### Input:\"The Great Lakes are the largest body of fresh water on Earth, providing habitat for hundreds of fish species. The ice fishing season officially begins in fall when water temperatures drop below 45 degrees F, and it ends in spring when the ice finally melts. But during much of the winter, ice fishing is possible thanks to open water surrounding portions of the Great Lakes. One of the most popular places to go ice fishing is Lake Ontario \u2014 home to more than 75 species of fish, including perch, whitefish and pike.\"\n\n### Response:(Fall, Winter, Spring)\n\nIn the fall, ice fishing season officially opens as water temperatures begin to drop below 45\u00b0F. This time of year is also known as the ice fishing opener. When the water freezes, the ice becomes a solid surface that fish can travel across. This allows people to drill holes in the ice and drop fishing lines through them.\n\nDuring winter, the ice on lakes and ponds grows thicker and stronger, providing a stable surface for fishermen to walk on. The colder temperatures also mean that ice fishing equipment must be modified for higher cold tolerance.\n\nIn spring, the ice melt begins and the ice breaks up into small floes. The floes move around under the pressure of waves and wind. This activity can displace fish and cause them to swim to deep waters where they become harder to catch. When the ice finally warms up and melts completely, people can once again enjoy the Great Lakes for their abundance\n\n### Input : 45 + 20 + 30 = 90\n\nThe four numbers are 45, 20, 30, and 90.

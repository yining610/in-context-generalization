The difference in ages between Hurley and Richard is 20. Hurley is 10 years old now. In 40 years, they will be 54 years old.\n2. If Hurley is now at 10 years old, after 3 years of age, he would be 13 years old. His mother agrees to pay one cent for every page that he reads. For example, he has already read 300 pages, so his mother agrees to give him $3. Then after 600 pages, he agrees to pay her $6 for the pages.\n3. To determine the number of pages Hurley has read, the combined ages of Hurley and Richard 14 years from now, we need to subtract 20.\n4. The combined age of Hurley and Richard is Richard 64 years old + Hurley 54 years old => 108 years old\n\n5. The total number of pages Hurley can read from now to 14 years old is (108 - 20) years => 88 pages.\n6. The number of pages Hurley already read in the first 10 years is ((10 years + (108 -20)) pages = ((10 years x 88) pages) \u2248 868 pages).\n\n7. The number of pages that Hurley and Richard can read in the next 3 years is (14 years - (10 years +(108 - 30))) years ~ 30 years.\n\n8. The number of pages each of them will each read in the next 14 years is ((14 years x 30 years) years ~ 420 years).\n\n 9. It\u2019s not true, therefore false.\n\n10.

How many pages of the books have Pablo has read?\n\n* Let's find how many pages are in a book:\n* I chose, because a book is usually 200 - 300 pages and the page was $0.02 and the books are exactly 15 pages.\n* So, now we need to find out how much is 1 page.\n* I chose, so now the problem can be rewritten as  $0.15 * x = 1.\n* Now we will multiply.\n* $$0.15 * (15-5)=1$$\n\nThen, we solve the problem. We simplify for $x$,\n\n$$0.15 * 10 = 1 => 15 = 1$$\n\n* $15-5=10$ (because it is not zero).\n* So, 10 is the number of pages in the books.\n---\nInput:$70$ for teaching gifts that includes teacher appreciation gifts and six different teachers who have 6 teachers and six different presents for each teacher.\n\n* The question is the remaining money that is left and to figure out that remaining money you need to figure out how much each present is.\n* One gift is $10", "answer": "C: garage"}

{"text": "A\n\n### Instruction:Answer the question below.\nExplain your thinking for any part of the problem on a separate sheet of paper and turn it in along with your solution.\" (Answer only, not the question.)\n\nExplanation:I took the first question first by using the age difference between Richard and Hurley. The  difference was 20, so I add 20 to the smaller value and subtract it from the larger value. That leaves 60 + 20 +48. From there the answer should be 128.\n\nFor the next question it states you take 150 from the number of pages because 150 is the exact number of pages required.\n\nFor the third question it\u2019s stating to take the number of students and divide 22 into it. The answer of what that does is to figure out what 22 students is 44 to the hundred place.\n\nFor the fourth question it is just subtract the new number from what each student has to pay to figure out who has more.\n\nFor the fifth question it\u2019s taking away the 10 from 1700 and dividing it by the group of six and that leaves 150 as we can see that 10 of those is what the candy is.\n\nFor the sixth question it is taking the difference of a smaller value which is 20 and the larger value. From there it is taking it\u2019s addition 20 which leaves 64 and that is what we are left with.\n\nFor the seventh question it is just taking the larger value and the difference between it. From there we get what 10 represents which is 500 divided 4.\n\nFor the eight questions the answer could be 3 or 4. So what I did is divide the larger value by 3 and take the modulus value. It turns out it\u2019s 6.\n\n### Instructions:Answer the question below and turn it in with your solution.\nHow can you determine if your solution is correct? (Answer only, not any programming language required)\n\nIt could be determined by checking values from 0 to the answer and finding where it stops being divisible, this way you would know of your solution is correct.\n\n### Input: The code is already provided for you.\n### Instrucement:", "answer": "C: space center"}

If you leave city A at 10 am and leave city B 3 hours later, what time would you arrive at B? \nOutput: 2:00 pm\n\n### Explanation:\n**Example 1:** Here we have two numbers (both positive integers, let's say: `A=168, B=40`). We know that the difference between them is 20 (A-B=20), which is twice as large the difference between B and A (B-A=10). We need to figure out how much times larger (20/10=2).\n\n**Example 2:** Here we have four numbers: (Huletary: 14, Hurley: 24, Combined: 74 in 5 years). Using the first equations (x+y=A years after) and the second one (A=y+z years after), we can say that: x=(14+24)/74=57.5. The combined age is 74-14, 59 years after. We want to be accurate, we need the quotient of 74 and 14 which is 5, which means the extra 29 years.\n\n**Example 3:** Here we have 3 equations for the 7 variables (H=150). When reading books, he checks out exactly A books. After finishing books, he buys ($15 * B)  where H=150, A=150 and B=1.\n\n\tH=A*B  B=1    H=150\nWhere we need B to be 1, which is, if we read 150 books, we read exactly 150 books. It is obvious that B=1 and we have 3 equations and 7 variables. We solve the equation for B, and get it  at one of the values from 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Which is:B=1. The variable B is a known value with multiple equations and multiple variables. When we solved for B, we got one solution, which is a valid solution.\n\n**Example4:** This one is pretty easy.", "answer": "B: fast food restaurant"}

What was Sarah' s total spend?\n\n```\nAnswer: This question is quite tricky. When we're finding the total, we are trying to add one part of the dress which is 50% and we would like to also add the purse 25.00 which is half, if we use 25 on both sides of the equation we get the same answer. You have to find the total (3,52) which is 9. After dividing $50 by 9 (giving you 5.55) we know Sarah is spending $181.00 on a dress. Then we take the $181.10 on the second part which is for a purse. Sarah is spending $282.20.\n```\n### Instruction:You have 4 apples, 5 oranges and 6 grapefruits.

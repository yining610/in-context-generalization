The only clue we have here is the 4th question, which stated a rest area, so B looks like a good fit.<n><n>### Your Response<n>Write a response below by selecting the best choice from the responses above and then explain your reason for choosing that choice.<n><n>#### My choice: B<n><n>### Input<n><n>Johnny sat on a park bench and relaxed.<n>Where is he?<n>Choices:<n>A: state park<n>B: bus depot<n>C: garden<n>D: gym<n>E: rest area<n><n>#### My answer:<n>Bus depot looks like the answer from the first question, not park bench which is in a state park.  State park is excluded in the fourth question along with garden and gym where he needs a rest area.  Bus Depot, A or B may be the right answer for the fourth question, but a bus depot is not a good place to be after doing a lot of hard work on a hobby, when you would most likely be in the garden (since horticulture is a hobby), which is the third question's correct answer.  If it is a garden, he may be at rest in the rest area.  Since there is more than 1 question with correct answers, answer D, rest area, is the correct answer, because rest (A) and garden (C) are already part of other questions along with answers that exclude a park bench.<n><n>#### Explain why you chose your choice<n><n>Since the other correct answers do not exclude a park bench after doing a lot of painstaking work on a hobay, where he would most likely be at rest, the bus depot, which the other three answers do not exclude, is the most obvious answer, even though it excludes one of the other questions' answers.<n>

His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Rationales: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

The boy gave $48 in total B. The girl gave $48 in tot C. The boy gave 6 in total D. The boy gave $24 in total E. The girl gave $24 in totl<n><n>### Response You should select 'E' because in 'The ratio of boys to girl...' you have 3 on the left hand side and 5 on the right hand side. There are two equal parts which means when they all get the same amount of money, the amount is going to be halved. The left hand side would have '3 in total' for it to match which means that the right side has to be $5 since 5/3=1.5 and you can get 1.5 boys or 1.5 girls hence $5.<n><n>### A group of three friends is working in their backyard.

If the obesity can be caused by genetic factors (and, sometimes, there are a surprising number of such possibilities that we consider), and if genetics means that losing weight does not necessarily require a reduced amount of food intake, weight loss in this circumstance could lead to increased energy without necessarily requiring a reduced intake of food.<n><n>### Answer:A<n><n>### Response2: B) The ratio of the number of ways it is not healthy to lose weight is 0.9 to the power of infinity with two zeroes.

It is about them accepting you so that you may feel closer to them, or that there is a benefit to the relationship.<n><n>### Input:(1) What are you hoping to achieve by talking to someone? Choice: A: communicating with the other B: make the other uncomfortable (2) A) the other feels comfortable C) the other feels a connection F) I’m the person of my words D) I try to avoid conflict E) I want to be liked (3) A) They listen to me C) I want to persuade them E) They find me charming B) They feel attracted to me D) They are interested in my needs (4) A) I focus on other people (5) A) I try to get to know them<n><n>### Response:(1) D is dry mouth.<n><n>### Ex: When talking to someone, you wish to be understood and you want them to understand you. You do so by communicating with them. Communicating is not about hurting them, or drying them, being close, or changing their behavior; it is just about being understood so that you may be understood in return.<n><n>### (2) E is liked because they are charming.<n><n>### Response(3) A is they listen to me<n><n>### Ex:(3) When talking to someone, one hopes to be understood. If you are not understood, then you hope that they will focus. Focusing is when they acknowledge what you were saying, but don’t necessarily react. They are also interested in you and try to get to know you, but they don’t necessarily have to be like you.<n><n>### Resp:(4) Dry mouth means that they are attracted to other people.<n><n>### When you talk to someone you are hoping for them to be interested, interested in what you say and do, but not by focusing on you either to hurt you or to dry you up. Dry mouth is the result when they focus on you.<n>

His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Rationales: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

Getting fat is often seen as a result of tv watching. While there are other factors that could influence watching Television for example sleeping, there is no scientific evidence to support that being on TV causes one to fall asleep and if in fact that the activity of watching tv causes one to sleep then falling asleep would be a better option and it would not be accurate as a result "get fat" would be the correct choice.<n><n>D<n><n>### Choices 3: Typing words<n><n>### Response To Choice:  C<n><n>Getting fat is clearly not the correct answer because it is an obvious side effect for some, however it is seen clearly that one is actually doing something and not not doing something.<n><n>### Choose E:  wasted time<n><n><n><n>---<n><n>## Easy Peasy Tutoring<n><n>| :closed_book: [Get help from us](https://www.easyteachers.com/l/nathanielperez) | :hammer: [Hire us](https://www2.easyteach.com/l/60a2f67f64be4c66ab1a25f7803c5a57) | :phone: [Call us]((02) ​8493 0085; 0966-​414-​6545; 0998-​880-​6248) | :pencil: [Request a Callback](https://bit.ly/3lwDXIh) | :envelope: [Email us](info@easyteachersmanila.com) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<n><n>© 2021 EasyPeasy All Rights Reserved

Its hourly labor cost is, therefore, $12.5/$12.25 = <<$12.5/$221>>21.  If they now increase it to $15.00 per hour, what happens to their hourly labor cost?<n>Rationales:: For increased labor to equal higher pay, the costs for a workers should go up by at least as much as the wages.<n>The cost of labor at $12.5 is ($12.5/$5.0 = <<$125/$5.0=$25.0>>50<n>Now if we increase labor rate to $15. What we do is, we increase (15/5) for the total hourly cost.<n>Therefore the new total hourly cost for $15/5 = <<$15/5=$3.0>>3<n>We have to increase our rates from $5 to $3. Therefore with an increase of $2.5 each worker's paycheck will only go up $2.5.<n>$2.5 of pay will never equal new rates of $15/hour.<n>Because of this you can't expect higher pay to equal less cost or hourly labor.<n><n>#### 3<n>Answer: 9<n><n>### Instructions:Complete the task below.<n><n>### Task:<n>Your boss said that you can go out to lunch by paying for your cost plus 10% with your next pay check but you just don't know how to make payment.<n>Your boss was saying that you needed to have the amount of $250 in your next check, for a $30 + tax bill for lunch, but for your lunch bill you need to pay $10 less and not the next $10 or after all of your other payments like rent and bills.

He would prefer living in a tower so that he can watch the clouds as he looks out his window.  <n>### Instruction to the student:<n>If we let d represent any number of days and t represent time, then for a single d we can represent it by time, and for t hours, we can express it by d.  For example, 4 hours represent four hours and 32 minutes and 45 seconds, and thus we have 2 d and 59 t.  The same goes for time, where one day equals 24 hours.  So if we let j represent any number of days, then we can represent it by t and vice-versa and thus for 4 days can be represented by 2 d and 1 t of 24h.  This time, for 2 d, we would have 2 t and 9 h, but for 3 d, we would have time representing 3 t.  <n>### Demonstiation:<n>Given that James is tired of looking at the clouds, we need to account for the time he would have spent if he didn't look at the clouds.  In order to do this, when we write the time in the clouds column, we need to include the two times in which James saw the clouds (24h).  Thus, to find out how many hours he spent looking at them, 24h would be subtracted from the total, and we would have:  <n>### Given:<n>The solution involves accounting for the time during which James was able to see clouds.  In order for this to be done, any number of time a person watches the clouds can be divided in half, and 24 can then be subtracted from that value.  Thus, when we say 3d, we mean 3 t of 24=<<3*24=216>>216h, when we say 6d, we mean 6 t of 24 = <<6*24=144>>144

Write a response that makes appropriate recommendations.<n><n>When advising a client about a travel itinerary, the best way to approach this is to provide them with three scenarios that are within their budget so that they can make an educated decision about what they like and what they do not like.<n>I believe the first destination the client should experience in Greece is the Minoan Palace in Crete. The Minoan Palace in Herate is one of the largest archaeological sites in Greece, and has been open to the public for over 65 years. Although it took 50 years to fully excavate this area, the entire archaeological site is almost 2 miles long by 3 miles wide, and contains almost 3000 rooms and chambers. The entire archaeological site had one main temple complex, 3 theatres and baths, an extensive palace, and a maze of streets and buildings. This is a must-see sight for any lover of world history, since you can experience this entire civilization with your own eyes. After spending a day exploring this ancient civilization, one could spend the night in the Greek city of Zante, which I highly recommend. If the client wishes to continue learning about the Greek culture, the next day should be spent in Athens, and then the third day of the trip should be spent in the ancient city of Thebes.<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>#### Instruction Answer:<n>You are a traveler and you are visiting Greece.

In this case it can be hamburger, and if they continue to consume them they will get heartburn from the overconsumption.  This option cannot be chosen.<n>#### B) have FUN<n>In a fun park it is always a good idea to choose a ride you know you will enjoy.  This option cannot possibly be chosen because the hamburgers cannot be enjoyed.<n>#### A) heart burn<n>In this case the heart burn can be caused by over consuming burger.  This option would be the correct choice because they are making a choice of burger, and could become sick.<n>#### C) enjoy<n>Its hard to enjoy a ride if you just ate a burger.  The burger will still be in your stomach and be sitting in a way that may cause discomfort.  In this case a enjoyable ride will be much harder even if the burger is consumed<n>#### D) gas.<n>A food that can make a ride discomforting would be a gas causing food.  In this park there is no way to be able to get rid of the food so the burger can cause discomfort in the future<n>#### E) food poisioning<n>This is a worse possible outcome if a food is consumed in the wrong manner.  A rider will have to get off the ride and go to the nurse. <n>#### D) gas <n>### How many feet can a rider of the carrot-head roller coaster ride, if the maximum speed of the car is 4 feet/second and the minimum speed is 2 feet/second?<n>### Rational:<n><n>### <n>### How can the riddle be solved?<n><n>### In which section could this instruction be written? <n><n>### Demostraction:<n><n>### Input, Demostraction & Rational:<n><n><n>### 1.

Why? Since, while we are sleeping we do both these things, relax our muscles after they had been fully relaxed and losing consciousness is not a function of the brain but rather a function of the heart.<n><n>### Rationale:<n>The rationales for Exemplification: A response is  that we relax our muscles when we are sleeping and we do relaxation as the first functioning state, then sleep, so sleep is not the function of relaxation but rather the function of loss of consciousness. We lose consciousness because the heart does not let our brain take commands from our muscles so it is like we are conscious of something but muscles are not.<n><n>

Choices:  A: holding B: lift up C: pick up D: lifting E: hold onto<n><n>### Response:		It was B, and the answer was C, because to pick something up you have to drop it, and that requires having your arm extended so you could grasp the item before picking it up, but once you are holding that item (not extended) you could lift it up until it was above your hand, and only then, when you had it out of your hand, could you truly lift with it in it and move it. But if you lifted the item, you lost your grip and you wouldn't be able to hold it again, but when you picked it up you still had a hold of it for your arm to lift it.<n><n>

His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Rationales: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Rationales: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>#### 310<n>Answer: 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Rationales: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Rationales: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>#### 800<n>Answer: 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Rationales: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>#### 72<n>Answer: 72<n><n>Input: The ratio of boys to girls in a family is 5:7. The total number of children in the family is 180. If the boys are given $3900 to share, how much money does each boy receive?<n>Rationales: The total ratio representing the number of children in the family is 5+7 = <<5+7=12>>12<n>From the total ratio of children in the family, 5/12 represent the number of boys, meaning that the number of boys in the family is 5/12*180 = <<5/12*180=75>>75<n>If the boys are given $3900 to share, each boy receives $3900/75 = $<<3900/75=52>>52<n>#### 52<n>Answer: 52<n><n>### Input:Bill was awaking, what was happening to him physiologically? Choices:  A: tiredness B: grogginess C: discomfort D: getting out of bed E: eyes opening<n><n>### Response:		<n>We can assume that Bill was getting out of bed as we can assume, he is able to get out of bed. Also, he is able to see and open his eyes.<n>Based on this, there are four choices that are not correct and one that is correct.<n>We can eliminate choice C because, this is related to physiology and A, B, and E are not related to physiology.<n>Based on these steps, we are able to eliminate B.<n>Now, if it is not physiology, but something related, it has to be related with biology.<n>Therefore, we can find out A, D, and E are related to biology, while choice B is related to psychology; which is not the answer.

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Rationales: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>#### 310<n>Answer: 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Rationales: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Rationales: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>#### 800<n>Answer: 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Rationales: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>#### 72<n>Answer: 72<n><n>Input: The ratio of boys to girls in a family is 5:7. The total number of children in the family is 180. If the boys are given $3900 to share, how much money does each boy receive?<n>Rationales: The total ratio representing the number of children in the family is 5+7 = <<5+7=12>>12<n>From the total ratio of children in the family, 5/12 represent the number of boys, meaning that the number of boys in the family is 5/12*180 = <<5/12*180=75>>75<n>If the boys are given $3900 to share, each boy receives $3900/75 = $<<3900/75=52>>52<n>#### 52<n>Answer: 52<n><n>### Input:Which entrance would you use if you do not want to use the back entrance?

He arrives at the route at 5:36 a.m. and leaves the route at 7:56 a.m.<n>How many passengers are on the bus?<n>RationalesThe bus driver goes through the mountain pass for total time of 3.2=<<3.2=79>>79.20 minutes and arrives at the mountain pass at 5:39 a.m., which leaves (3.2-1) = <<3.2-1=79.2>>79.2 minutes for him to get passengers on the bus. He leaves at 7:59:16, meaning there were only (79.2-1) – 5 = <<79.2-5=55>>55 seconds left for him to get the passengers out of the bus. The maximum time of the bus going through the pass is 3.2/60 = <<3.2/6=5.3+39>>5.3+3 seconds. 55/5.3+3 (approx)= <<55/5.8=11>>11<n>The first 30 minutes on the mountain pass is 55 min/3=<<55/3=18>>18 minutes/50 seconds in total. The 55 min/60 is 55/60 which is 0.9167 for each person/second at 55/18 = <<55/18=3>>3 persons/second.<n><n>#### 3<n>Answer: 3<n><n>Input: John traveled 18 miles each day

How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Rationales: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>#### 310<n>Answer: 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Rationales: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Rationales: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>#### 800<n>Answer: 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm.

Question - How much did they save if they went with the lower price?<n>Rationales - The problem says "Each car went for four days". In other words each car drove for 4 days. You add the amount they saved to give you the total amount. Question: how much less if they bought the 6-day pass? Answer: They saved $2,400.<n>#### Question: How many miles did they save if they took a bus?<n>Rationales- They spent 1 and a half days going on the bus.<n>They spent 2 days in the car, so they would have needed to go on the bus for 3 and a half days (so that they are 3 and a half day ahead - just do the math) to cover the distance of 2 days in the  car. So they needed to go on the 8-day bus ticket so they saved a day if they went with the cheep ticket.<n>Question: How many days did the bus ticket cost? Answer: The eight-day bus ticket cost $1,600<n>Question: How many miles did the bus ticket cost 20 cents a mile?

Choices:  A: economic instability B: not noticeable C: spend more D: rising interest rates E: boring<n><n>### Response:		C<n><n>### Demnstration:<n>Input : One of the signs that indicates your economy is growing is that your money’s value will grow with time.  Of course, you don’t want the growing value of the money to become too high because at that point, your economy will be experiencing a very serious problem that’s known simply as inflation, and when inflation occurs, prices of goods and services will almost certainly increase as well, even if the economic growth you got is the result of growing employment and business, both of which create more money than there is already.  So fighting the inflation caused by this economic growth isn’t exactly what you’d want to even do!<n><n>The passage describes this notion of inflation, but in the first sentence, it mentions inflation’s effect in increasing prices, whereas in the second sentence, it says the effect of economic growth on inflation being caused by the economic growth.  <n><n>From the passage itself, it is seen that sometimes it ‘is even what’ refers to spending more on good and services, which makes prices increase as well<n><n>#### <n>Answer: C<n><n>## Exercise:<n><n>### Instructions:<n>Provide a response that completes the request.

Jennie rented it for 11 days meaning the total bill was $190<n>### <n>### Instruction answer: The hurricane moving toward the southern tip of Texas requires you to transport 400 head cattle by a one hour trip. Each round trip includes 40 rounds trips. So it requires 2x40=4×40<n># = 20 hours of driving <n>The carriage house is charged at $50 for 14days and it is $500 for 10 days.<n>The rent for the house takes 12 days for $500, which means that the rental of the house was $500 for the total time it took him to rent it as he would have paid $500 for it if he hadn’t rented it for 6 days for $300.<n>The ratio of boys to girls is 5 and the number of girls is 75 and therefore the number of boys is 75/12.<n>The boys are given money for what they want. They take $3900 and each boy gets $52 for their share.<n>#### <n><n>### The underwater travelling is known as relocation that's because<n>### In degrees Fahrenheit because the temperature changes a lot a bit in a hot or cold day<n>### When travelling 16 miles further north, you will also be travelling 16 minutes further south.

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Rationales: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>#### 310<n>Answer: 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Rationales: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

If you picked B, then orthodox behavior could be religious or non-religious.<n>If you picked C, then it could be non-religious behavior. If you picked D, then it could be religious.  Because priest are usually religious, then it is religious. If you pick E, then it is heretical.<n>#### orthodox<n>Answer: orthodox<n><n>Answer: It is not "heretical", that's what he's pushing for, not pushing against, but neither is it recalcitrant nor conservadox.<n><n>### Input<n>The priest pushed for ortho behavior, which what kind of behavior was it, was it conservadox?<n><n>### Response<n><n>Answer: It was not conservadox, because the text says "pushed for it" and not "pushed against it", so it is something the priest wanted, not pushed against, so recalcitrant was eliminated. Conservadox was removed because the text says the behavior was pushed for and not pushed against.  Heretical was eliminated because that would be what he would want to push against.<n><n>Heretical was rejected as a word meaning "wanted by priests" because it was only wanted by protestants, so it was not something they would actually push for.<n><n>### Answer<n><n>Answer: It can be either heretical or orthodox<n>

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Rationales: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>#### 310<n>Answer: 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Rationales: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.

Each fish can eat 6.4 pounds of seafood per week. If each person consumes 9.4 pounds of sea food per week, how many of these fish can a person eat each week?<n><n>### Response<n>If everyone consumes 9.7 pounds of seafood a week then there are 9.4 pounds - 9.7 pounds = 0.3 pounds of difference.  If everyone consumes the 9.4 pounds per week then there would be a 30.1 pound difference.  However, this can be overcome using the following equation: (9.4 pounds - (6.4 pounds))/3 = 0.2 pounds. Using this value as a division into the whole number to figure out how many fish can be eaten by one person each week.<n><n>### Note:

What is the maximum number of people that can be flown and still reach everyone from the safer place before the storm hit?<n>Rationales<n>Since you have to add both a crew and 750 kilograms to the amount of passengers.<n>If there are 80 passengers, there’s 950 kilograms with the crew.<n>The 80 passengers and the crew weigh 450kg.<n>150 mph x 5 = <<150 mph 5=300>> 300 hours.<n>With 2 fuel breaks 300/2 = <<300/2=150>>150 miles.<n>With 950kg and 150 passengers = 950/150 = <<950/1>>15 miles.<n>So 150*15 = <<15*15=225>> 225 miles which equals 3 hours.<n>Which equals 5 hours and the flight needs 30 mins to get fuel, so the max can be (5 hours + 30 mins) = 7 hours and 30 mins.<n>Which equals a max of 75 passengers.<n><n>### Answer<n>75 passengers<n>

He is very fond of reading detective novels. He borrows the books from his friends and read all the novels. It is a month in which he borrowed eleven detective novels and returned thirteen of them to his friends. One and a half months after he had returned the novels, he borrowed one more detective novel but before reading it he remembered that he had read a half of it before. How much number of days after borrowing and returning them he read the novel again?<n><n>### Response :<n>It was 5 and half months after he borrowed the book and half of a month later he had returned it. (<<< 5 + 5 + 5.5 = 15.5 >> )<n><n>Since the boy had to travel a month and a half to read the novel, his travel time was a month. (<< 15.5 = 31 >> )<n> <n>Since the boy had traveled to read the novel, he would have arrived in << 31 = 30.5 >> 30.5 days.<n><n>If you add the number of days spent returning the novel, you get that he was << 30.5 + 1 and half = 32 >> 32 and a half days to read the novel.<n><n>Now, if we subtract 32 days for his traveling to read the novel, and add a number of days for returning the novel, we get that he was <<  32 - 32 = 0>> 0 and one half days to read the the novel.<n><n>###Instruction:<n>What is a sum of all rational numbers?

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Rationales: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>#### 310<n>Answer: 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Rationales: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Rationales: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>#### 800<n>Answer: 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Rationales: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>#### 72<n>Answer: 72<n><n>Input: The ratio of boys to girls in a family is 5:7. The total number of children in the family is 180. If the boys are given $3900 to share, how much money does each boy receive?<n>Rationales: The total ratio representing the number of children in the family is 5+7 = <<5+7=12>>12<n>From the total ratio of children in the family, 5/12 represent the number of boys, meaning that the number of boys in the family is 5/12*180 = <<5/12*180=75>>75<n>If the boys are given $3900 to share, each boy receives $3900/75 = $<<3900/75=52>>52<n>#### 52<n>Answer: 52<n><n>### Input:Where would you see some people standing on a line near a road?

Watson rushed back to Gray’s shop and told him he had just talked into a tin can. When Gray could not believe it, Watson again tried his invention.<n><n>It worked and he reported, “Mr. Bell, your experiment works.”<n><n>Bell’ first model of his telephone worked in March, 1876. Two years later, in February of 1878, a telephone line 30 miles long was built and used to connect Sanders to Boston.<n><n>### 1.

His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Rationales: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.

The hotel charged each person $800 in total, and 15% tax. How much more were the adults charged than the children?<n><n>### Response A family of four goes on vacation, and $800 was charged for them all. After adding the 15% tax, the grand total came out to $922. So we divided all of the charges by 4, and that resulted in $800+15% of $800+the 15% tax (remember the tax does not apply to children), in which we subtracted all of this off and was left with $22. Now we rounded that off to $20.  When we divided all of this, the results came out to $1,000-$800=$20.<n><n>### Example<n>```<n>15% of $1,004 (remember the $1,00 is the base amount + the 15% of the total, or $150)<n>$1,004 - $150 = $854<n>```<n>

If space in unavailable there's no point to explore it, it is an empty place.<n><n>Comment: Do you need a reason on why the answer is "public place"? (Like a mathematical, logical, or textual reason)<n><n>Comment: I didn't quite understood your rationale please explain in more details.<n><n>Comment: Public Space is an outdoor space that is generally open and accessible to the public, such as a park, square, beach, or street.[1] This is an example of public space, and is defined by the United Nations [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_space](http://en.wikipedia....m/wiki/Public_stree)<n><n>Comment: @WeeMisle I don't see the reasoning in that statement. There are a lot of public spaces in earth and there are a lot of spaces that are unexplored. I don't understand your reasoning.<n><n>Comment: To put simply, since earth is explored by so many different people, there should be a reason where the public place needs to be explored.<n><n>Comment: What I meant by public places is things like the International Space Station that everyone could go to. The space station is in space and any countries can go and land on it.<n><n>Comment: @SinathiNyakabeya You can say that about any public service, or infrastructure. Why do you think a town needs a sewer system?<n><n>Comment: @Mari-LouA, in this case, a space station can be the public place to explore.

She can use steel, but it costs $53 a pound. Each widget is made with 4 lbs of steel. She can substitute bronze, but it costs $37 a pound. Each 4-lb widget needs 0.5 lb of bronze.  How much total does it cost to make this widget?<n><n>Rationales: We can use substitution to figure this cost out. Substituting steel for bronze gives us 53 times 4=<<53 times 4>>43 lb of steel needed for a 4-lb widget so each 4-lb widget uses 53/4=<<53/4> lb of steel.  So 53 times 1=<<53 times1>>45 lb of steel are needed to make one widget.  Substituting bronze for steel gives us 37 times 4=<<37 times 4>>34 lb of bronze needed for a 4 lb widget so each 4 lb widget uses 34 lb of bronze.  So 37 times 1=<<37 times1>>39 lb of bronze are needed to make one 4 lb widget.  So

Choices:  A: city B: toronto C: radio station D: roger that E: medieval castle<n><n>### Response:		<n>B:  Toronto<n>### Rationale:<n>This is from a website on Canadian History in which 'To know the answer, you need to look at a map and read the question carefully.  If the question were, “What business has a tower in Toronto?” then the answer would be C:  a radio station.  But the question did not ask about where the tower was located, but about where the business was located.” The fact that B:  Toronto is the answer in the source is irrelevant because the question is about the business's location and the answer is not to look to the question's reference points, but to the content of the question.  The 'radio station' that they are talking about is located in Toronto and the question does not ask about that business but rather the business that has a tower in/on Toronto.

When the prices are getting more expensive it will push people toward shopping a certain amount based on current price. It will force them to buy something more expensive. When that happens the inflation will bring the prices down. But it will never come full circle because the demand has increased.<n><n>### Choices:A: problems<n><n>### Demonsration: The main problem with fighting inflation is making it to make everyone have to pay the higher wages. This will make them not hire or invest to create new jobs. They will wait and see if the inflation will reduce its rate on products.<n><n>### Response :B<n><n>### Demotion: Not noticeable<n><n>Not noticeable is because if inflation isn’t under control people won’t have to spend at one and buy only what they really need. So therefore people will cut back on spending on things they don’t really need thus reducing the price of goods in the market.

Choices:  A: doctor's office B: hospital C: apartment D: study E: furniture store<n><n>### Response:		Furniture store<n><n>## Explanation:<n>You would not find an armchair in a hospital.  You may find one in a doctor's office but it would definitely be used by MANY people and not just a few.  You may find an armchair at a patients house but their may be more than one person in that house and not just a few people.  An apartment is similar to a house in that they may have several residents that would have access to a sitting chair but again it would be used by "several" people not just a FEW.  What if a couple has a crib and they always bring it out for their naps and they are "new" parents.    This is where a furniture store would keep a "handful" of armchairs.  There could be several items in the furniture store but only the "CHOSEN" few would purchase and this is the place you would find them.  A furniture store would have "limited" to "hundreds" but it would be "FEW" to the ones that are PURCHASINg that particular item to furnish their home, etc.  Remember "SEVERAL" and "FEW" are two different items.<n><n>### Input<n>Gregor Samsa wakes up one morning and finds he has transformed into an enormous insect.

His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Rationales: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

A is the least specific by defining everything but not simplifying the formula. B will work as long as there's a conversion from feet to m, which is what the r stands for.

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Rationales: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>#### 310<n>Answer: 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Rationales: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

The sum of the largest number is 8 more than the smaller number. If one of these numbers is 8, what is the remaining number?<n>(Source: David L. Lipscomb and Cindy A. Pellegrino.)<n>|Rationales<n>The ratio of the sum of 3 numbers to the sum of 48 is less by 4.<n>The ratio of the largest number to the smallest number is bigger by 8.<n>When one of the numbers is 8, then we just have to find the remaining number with the help of these conditions. So we need to find a number that makes the sum to be 16. So, a number would be 8 and the other would be 8.<n>|Output=12<n><n>### Instructions<n>Answer the following multiple-choice question.

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Rationales: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>#### 310<n>Answer: 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Rationales: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.

The amount in which the 3rd child is at fault has to equal the amount in which all the children are at fault. You have to convert this into an equivalent fraction and solve for x. You can not use any calculators or online tools. Please do it yourself.<n>### Input: The parents of three children got into a discussion about whose fault it was that the children were late to school.  At last, they decided not to hold a discussion and to think the matter over for themselves. On reflection, they all realized that each had been at fault to the same degree. (No one child was entirely at fault while the other two were innocent.) Unfortunately however, the three children did not take a similar attitude and as a result did not agree about their parents' attribution of fault. One child said: "My parents were only partly at fault, but you were both entirely at fault." Another child said: "Your parents were only partly at  fault, but I was entirely at fault. "The third child said: "I agree with my brothers." In what percentage did the parents and children all agree that they were at fault?<n>### Solution:  Divide all the answers by the amount of answers from each parent or child and you get your percentage. The parent’s opinion will be added with the child’s opinion and the sum will be divided by the number of answers.<n>The same method goes for each child. The parent opinion was divided by the number of parents. The child opinion was divided by the  number of children. They summed these and divided by the total number of answers.

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Rationales: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>#### 310<n>Answer: 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Rationales: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Rationales: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>#### 800<n>Answer: 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Rationales: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>#### 72<n>Answer: 72<n><n>Input: The ratio of boys to girls in a family is 5:7. The total number of children in the family is 180.

Choices:  A: classroom B: toy store C: school D: soccer game E: dinner<n><n>### Response:		I think it’s A: classroom because when they are a kid children do not like to be forced to learn things. When you grow up you realize the things teachers force upon you are useful and important. Dinner and other events that revolve around food is interesting if you are a child. Most children prefer not to get dressed up for a fancy meal. You do not have to worry about doing a presentation, writing a paper, or studying for a test to enjoy dinner and it’s important that you know how to cook, and know a variety of food but going to the dentist, visiting the doctor, doing paper work and other things that revolve around classrooms are not interesting.<n><n>### Input:{“questionType”: “multipleChoiceSingleSelect”, “multipleChoiceItemValues”:[[“16”,”60″],[“9”,”67″]], “answers”: [{"id":"1333679396592", “score”:0.8, “questionText":“Which of these is the answer to the sum of 3 x 4 + 2?”},{"id":"1346523404893", “score”:1, “questionText":"This is the answer to the question: Which of these is the answer?"}], “correctAnswerIndex”:0 }<n>> I know how to answer 4/3=<<4/3=1>>1 this problem but I have no idea how to figure out the rest.<n><n>### Rationales: 5\[5\][5\]555 \[\frac{5}{5}\]555 x 6\[6\][6\]65 65 x 5\[5\]55\[\frac{5}{6}\]555\[\frac{\frac{5}{6}}{5}\]560555<n>\[\frac{\frac{\frac{55}{66}}{55}}{6}\]5655556656\[\frac{\frac\frac{\frac{565}{6655555}{6}}{6655566} }{666}\]6656656<n><n>### Answer: I do not understand the answer to the question and I have no

Tanya buys 21 pieces of candy. She buys 2 of chocolate, 4 of fruit mix, 3 of nuts, 6 of butter toffee raisins, and so forth. Can you calculate the ratios of types of candies she bought?<n><n>### Rationales<n><n>#### Chocolate<n>The number of chocolates is<n>2/(2+1) = <<2/(2+1)=0.5>>0.5, the same ratio as peanuts.<n><n>#### Fruit mix<n>The number of fruit mix is<n>4/(4+1) = <<4/(4+1)=2>>2<n>The ratio of peanuts is 6/8 and so is the ratio of butter toffees. If you solve for the ratio, butter toffees would have been picked as the ratio.

The second response sounds negative, maybe because they expect a lower response or they already have it written down somewhere else that has more information.

We then use programming languages and scripts to use these symbols to perform various tasks.  We refer to these symbols as variables.<n><n>### 4:1 Workshop<n>[1.0] [45:00] [2] [4] [4] [1919] [1115]<n>------<n>To understand what you’re dealing with, let’s focus on what the program is doing to this number.  You don’t need to know too much programming syntax to begin with.  You just need to know a few of the pieces of syntax.  Let’s start by talking about what the program is doing with the data type variable.  <n>In this case, the value of n, that n refers to the value of the n that you put in.  And once we have assigned that value, that new value replaces the old one.  It stays as that value and it replaces the old one until the end of the program.  Once you’ve set a variable to a value, that variable now has that value and you can’t really change it.  So, if you’re programming it as a variable, it is like its own box, in a way.  Once you put in an assigned value, it can’t change.  <n>Let’s talk about what a program does with a variable.  Once it has assigned a value to it and knows it can’t change it, it will do something.  It will calculate something, it will add something, move that value over, subtract something, do something with the value.  It might store it, send it to the screen, move to another program, and so on.  Once it has a variable, then it can calculate something with the variable.  So, let’s take a look at some

How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Rationales: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>#### 310<n>Answer: 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Rationales: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Rationales: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>#### 800<n>Answer: 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Rationales: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>#### 72<n>Answer: 72<n><n>Input: The ratio of boys to girls in a family is 5:7. The total number of children in the family is 180. If the boys are given $3900 to share, how much money does each boy receive?<n>Rationales: The total ratio representing the number of children in the family is 5+7 = <<5+7=12>>12<n>From the total ratio of children in the family, 5/12 represent the number of boys, meaning that the number of boys in the family is 5/12*180 = <<5/12*180=75>>75<n>If the boys are given $3900 to share, each boy receives $3900/75 = $<<3900/75=52>>52<n>#### 52<n>Answer: 52<n><n>### Input:Where does a shadow usually appear? Choices:  A: suface of moon B: building C: bridge D: ground E: bright light<n><n>### Response:		B<n><n>### Rationales:<n>The shadow is created when the light ray is obstructed from reaching the target. The shadow of the target will always remain stationary to the target and will be the closest to the surface. Therefore, the shadow cast by the sun is found on the building which can be described as the ground and when the sun’s light rays are blocked by the bridge during evening hours, the shadow of the bridge can be seen which is also observed on the surface of the building. However, the shadow of the moon does not remain stationary to the surface of the moon as each day it travels around earth during its revolution on its axis and casts the shadow of Earth’s landforms<n>####<n>Answer: B<n><n>Input: When is it safe to swim in a pool? Choices: A: early morning B: late in the day C: after rain D: late afternoon E: after a storm <n><n>### Response A<n><n>### Rationale:<n>Pool is safe to swim in morning hours at low temperature as it maintains water at normal temperature and prevents chances of infection. Moreover, as the water circulation would be at normal level in morning, it would be convenient for swimmers to exercise in swimming pool<n><n>### Input, answer: A <n><n>Input: When swimming, it is important to stay in control of your breathing.

How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Rationales: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>#### 310<n>Answer: 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Rationales: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

Choices:  A: talk B: read book C: play piano D: study book E: study engineering<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>#### 1,2,4,5<n><n>### Discussion:<n>When you have an arithmetic problem and you need to work backwards and use division, we call that factoring. If we wanted to get to the bottom of the problem, then we need to begin by using our multiplication table because if we know all the multiples of one number and all the multiples of another number, then we know exactly how to solve the equation. So, this is where we begin working backwards and figure exactly how many times to move that number across the table.<n>#### Choice 2<n><n>### Response to Choice 2:<n>  If we are dividing, then we can simply start by saying we want to do the number over which number we multiply. If we say I want to divide by 4/6, then 4/6=<<4/6=0.6>>.6<n>#### Choice 5<n><n>### Response To Choice 5:<n>If we are dividing, we can just simply multiply by the number above it. For example, if we say I want to have 3 over 4, then we can simply multiply 3 times 4=<<3*4=12>>.  By multiplying everything over, we know exactly what number to move.<n><n>### Input:(What is the value of this equation? 1.5/1.25 = A) 1 B) 6 C) 3 D) 1.25 E) 1.5)<n><n>### Response:(What is the value)<n><n>#### Choice 1<n><n>### Response 1:<n> When we are attempting to multiply, it is a relatively straight-forward process. All we have to do is remember that we use the multiplier to multiply the factor. For example, 1.5 multiplied by 12 is just 12.6 because each one is a multiple of 6. Similarly, 78 divided by 25 is just 3.<n><n>### Choice 2<n>If we are dived, we have the exact opposite equation, so we simply need to use the multiplier that is the denominator to figure out which fraction we just need to multiply by and then we simply subtract 1 to figure out the answer to the math equation.<n><n>### Discussson:<n>#### Choice 6

Choices:  A: house B: den C: family room D: wood E: floor<n><n>### Response:		<n>A bean bag chair needs a surface to sit on other than the floor with a nice comfy surface where it can sit. It can sit on a house couch if it fits the color scheme for the home. But it will likely stay on the floor as it is more comfortable sitting directly on the floor than being placed on a couch or other piece of furniture. In the case that the bean bag isn't already the primary piece of furniture, a wood furniture can work but a wood table like a kitchen or dining room table, that is placed on a large piece of furniture like a sofa or loveseat to get that comfy look isn't a good idea. The bean bag chair will feel awkward sitting on top of a table. Also, that piece of furniture wouldn't be used for anything but the purpose of having the bean bag chair there so it isn't exactly a good idea to have a kitchen or dining table as the bean bag chairs place. It would just be a large comfy chair that would be sitting on the floor of that room. Lastly, a family room can work since there are couches and chairs or other furniture in that room and not just the wood kitchen or dining room tables<n><n><n>### Input : If 4-1=2 and 4+1=5<n><n>### Response :<n><n>Given the two equations 4-1=<n><n>> 2<n><n>and 4+1=<n><n>><n><n><n>Using logic as well as substitution in which the 1 in the equation 4-1=1<n>can be substituted with any value to arrive at<n><n><n>Answer -><n><n><n><img src = "assets/math11.png"/>

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The car-rental agency charges $30/day for a car, or $190 for the first week for a rental that lasts an entire week or longer. Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Rationales: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>#### 310<n>Answer: 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Rationales: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Rationales: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>#### 800<n>Answer: 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Rationales: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>#### 72<n>Answer: 72<n><n>Input: The ratio of boys to girls in a family is 5:7. The total number of children in the family is 180. If the boys are given $3900 to share, how much money does each boy receive?<n>Rationales: The total ratio representing the number of children in the family is 5+7 = <<5+7=12>>12<n>From the total ratio of children in the family, 5/12 represent the number of boys, meaning that the number of boys in the family is 5/12*180 = <<5/12*180=75>>75<n>If the boys are given $3900 to share, each boy receives $3900/75 = $<<3900/75=52>>52<n>#### 52<n>Answer: 52<n><n>### Input:It was breakfast time.  Brad ordered eggs, toast, and something to drink. What might he drink? Choices:  A: coffee B: throw up C: food D: getting drunk E: wine<n><n>### Response:		<n>####  C<n>Answer:  C

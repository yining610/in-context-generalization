### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The car-rental agency charges $30/day for a car, or $190 for the first week for a rental that lasts an entire week or longer. Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Output: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>So the final answer is 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Output: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>So the final answer is 72<n><n>Input: The ratio of boys to girls in a family is 5:7. The total number of children in the family is 180. If the boys are given $3900 to share, how much money does each boy receive?<n>Output: The total ratio representing the number of children in the family is 5+7 = <<5+7=12>>12<n>From the total ratio of children in the family, 5/12 represent the number of boys, meaning that the number of boys in the family is 5/12*180 = <<5/12*180=75>>75<n>If the boys are given $3900 to share, each boy receives $3900/75 = $<<3900/75=52>>52<n>So the final answer is 52<n><n>Input:She was sick and staying in bed the day of the event, unfortunately this meant she was what?

For each additional 3 hours, Alice would have 3*30=$<<3*30=90>>90.  Since Alice intends to travel for 89 hours it would mean that she would have 89*90=$<<89*90=7990>>7990 total payments from the car rental service.<n><n>Input: You are in a taxi taking a long drive. The taxi company charges $1.50 per mile and $0.20 per minute, in addition to a base fare.  The first 8 miles each cost $1.50 x 8=<<*1.50 x8=12>>1.50<n>Each minute for driving costs $0.2 x 1.2=<<0.2 x 3>>.25<n>So the final answer would be 1.50+0.25=<<1.50+ 0.25 =1.75>>1.75<n><n>Input: The city is paying 50 cents to have your garbage picked up, and you can afford to pay another $0.75. How much does that equal to if there are 2 trash bags in the trash can?<n> Output: The garbage pickup costs 50+0.75=<<50+ 0,75=>500.75>>0.75 each individual trash bag is another 0.75 =500.70<n>So the final cost will be equal to 500.7<n><n>Input: How much meat will 16 oz. of meat serve 33 people?<n>Output: For every 33 people, there will be 16 oz./3

If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Output: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>So the final answer is 72<n><n>Input: The ratio of boys to girls in a family is 5:7. The total number of children in the family is 180. If the boys are given $3900 to share, how much money does each boy receive?<n>Output: The total ratio representing the number of children in the family is 5+7 = <<5+7=12>>12<n>From the total ratio of children in the family, 5/12 represent the number of boys, meaning that the number of boys in the family is 5/12*180 = <<5/12*180=75>>75<n>If the boys are given $3900 to share, each boy receives $3900/75 = $<<3900/75=52>>52<n>So the final answer is 52<n><n>Input:"There are 10 apples on an apple tree.  Three fall off.  Now there are X apples."  What is this an example of? Choices:  A: park B: coloring book C: garden center D: math problem E: gravity<n>Output:		3 falls off is equivalent to X=<<3=3>>3 to make it so that there are 9 apples. To find the apple tree, since 3 falls of the 10 apples, to start with the tree would have 7 apples. Therefore the remainder is equal to the original number subtracted from the amount of apples that were left on the tree. This was the tree before the 3 apples fell off. To end you have 8 divided by 2 (2 apples per apple tree). So the tree will have 7 apples on it.<n><n>The output is E: gravity<n><n>Input: A large department store has an 18-foot Christmas tree. They offer a 10% discount on all merchandise. What is the maximum they can save if each individual family member buys an item that costs $1000?<n>Output:The first thing that comes to mind is the total amount of money saved, but the word “individuals” in this problem means that each family member is independent from the others. If I’m wrong about that word or it can be replaced by the word “family”, then the answer is 15%.<n>Given, the discount is 10%, then you can get it to 15% by dividing by.1, which will bring you to 15%. Then you have to take the total number of family members. If you want to save more than 15% per family member, then you can just simply divide the amount of money each family member will be saving by.1. In order to answer the question, you would want to use something like a double minus sign. To get the math to line up, you would add the 3 family members together, to get 3 family members and each of them would be able to get 15$ on what they can save at the discount that is being given. The max amount will have to come with the total amount divided by the number of family members, since they are all independent and are individual people.<n><n>$1000 * (1/.1)$<n><n>$10,000 * (3/.1)$<n><n>10000 / 3<n><n>3333<n><n>$3333$<n><n>(18 feet from 10%)<n><n>5 feet<n><n>0.

Choices:  A: gas stations B: city C: london D: train station E: airport<n>Output:		In the United States it is probably true that there are more telephone booth inside of gas stations than any other places. Gas stations are everywhere where ever I live in the United States and I only need to go to a gas station if I were to fill up my gas tank, so of course I am not going to go into a gas station or drive through to make calls, so I would not use the telephone booth inside the gas station to make calls.<n><n>Output:In London, England, I was only able to find or remember one telephone booth, not even an old style red telephone booth.<n>All the others I remember that where located in stations and not telephone booths.<n><n>Output:Train stations in England are very interesting places but definitely not a lot of telephone booth.

The main reason was because I was not looking for phones booths around London since I had a normal cell phone with me from when I lived in the United States.<n><n>Output:My opinion is that I have seen more telephone booth at the gas station when I lived in San Bernardino, California, then any other places in the United States, even though I did not use any of the phone booths at the gas stations because I already had a cell phone with me. There were many of the gas stations that had a telephone booth located inside of it. In London, England, I only remember that I found two telephone booths in a gas station when searching for one in London and

Now i only have 1 Big City to choose from.  Which one is better for me than Nevada?  Im only looking to maximize my customers, because i dont want to choose a location that doesnt have a lot of customers, which means i dont care about other factors like weather, taxes or any other factors for this question. The other states are excluded, only the Big Cities and Nevada are the ones for me to compare<n>The more customers I can have the more money i can make from the sale of my goods.  With Nevada only getting a little over 60000 people a year, how can i make more money than

His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

In this challenge, you cannot use input/output function (either by file IO or standard input/standard output), nor print a value; you must return a number as your answer.<n><n>Your task is to design a program that takes a string of characters input (eg. a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k) and outputs an integer. Each character (a through j) has a value (1 through 10). You can assign a higher integer value to the alphabet character (i.e. a could represent 11, b could represent 12, or c could represent 13). What’s more, if the character does in fact represent a higher integer value from its corresponding alphabet letter, write a negative number for that character.<n><n>For instance, the alphabet characters "abcde" could be assigned a value of -490. This is achieved by applying the rules of the game: a = 11 - 1 = 10 and c = 13.<n><n>Notice that each character represents either 1 or a negative integer, however, since there are alphabet characters that both do not represent an integer (j) and do not begin with a negative number, the value of j must be 0 or 1; note that the alphabet character j never actually goes above 10, therefore, the number 1 can be

How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Output: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>So the final answer is 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Output: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>So the final answer is 72<n><n>Input: The ratio of boys to girls in a family is 5:7. The total number of children in the family is 180. If the boys are given $3900 to share, how much money does each boy receive?<n>Output: The total ratio representing the number of children in the family is 5+7 = <<5+7=12>>12<n>From the total ratio of children in the family, 5/12 represent the number of boys, meaning that the number of boys in the family is 5/12*180 = <<5/12*180=75>>75<n>If the boys are given $3900 to share, each boy receives $3900/75 = $<<3900/75=52>>52<n>So the final answer is 52<n><n>Input:What is important in a car when you are driving fast and come to a light? Choices:  A: stripes B: seat belts C: breaks to help stop D: tires E: radios<n>Output:		 The answer is A because if the stripes are not on your car you could get a ticket and your insurance could go up.  When you are driving you should always be very aware of your surroundings or you can get into a really bad accident.  Seatbelt and radio are important because the seatbelts help you in cases of an accident, and the radio will help keep your mind free if you get nervous while driving.  As for breaks and tires, you can lose control of your car and you could have an accident.  If it comes to one that could harm your life, you might not even be able to stop.<n>

Choice B: market; cannot be the answer since the question states: a train station.  If the answer is a market, that implies that you are waiting for an individual vehicle to come down the railway and pick you up at the market.  Choice C and D cannot be the answer because those imply the place where the vehicle would be parked or where the vehicle is moving to not necessarily where vehicle is arriving from.<n>The answer remains at a train station.  Choice A is not the answer since that implies that where you are waiting is in a moving vehicle but you cannot wait for a vehicle if you are on a moving vehicle.  Choice E is not the answer as a train station is not within the context of a library.<n>Choose B: market.<n>If you are waiting for a train station, you are at a bookstore.<n>A train station is not within a market; that is the wrong answer.<n>A train station cannot pick you up at the doctor or the market so that cannot be the answer.<n>The bookstore is a market where if many individuals want to sell or read a book from within the bookstore, the customers can pick up the books.  The bookstore cannot move if the customers are waiting for a train; a moving vehicle or a seller can travel from a bookstore to pick up books at a moving vehicle or vice versa.  This leaves the answer at a bookstore.  Choice A: vegatables could be the answer; however, vegetables cannot pick you up at a bookstore. Therefore, the answer is a bookstore.<n>Choose E: bookstore<n>Since the only one of the provided choices is incorrect, you cannot choose any of the provided choices and you have to answer “E: bookstore” as the answer.  If you choose any of the other options you are selecting an incorrect option which means that you answer would not be considered and your answer would be marked incorrect.<n><n>Input:Rabbit is the last to enter the race.

Since each student has a 224/225 chance for a selection, the probability that a student is not selected for any group is 1-224/2(1-224)/224.  The probability that there are 155 students not randomly assigned to a group is approximately 6.53E-16.  <n>The probability that there are 2,000 students randomly assigned to a group from the whole population of 225 is 100/225=4.49%<n>11% of students will be left over from the 4.49%.  That leaves 11% of students, which is approximately 40 students.<n>The probability that a student is asked to stay after class is 2.35E-14 for every student that is not in a group.  This gives approximately 90 students selected out of 225 who would stay after class.<n>The final answer is 97<n><n>

Passing grade isn't the best compliment as it has a lot to do with studying and doing work. Even though this type of challenge is a necessary part of education. An intellectual challenge is like testing out one's knowledge.  If a student does their best and can answer all the questions in a challenging test, they can get a high grade. Stickers aren't usually a good thing they can represent the opposite. It's better to receive compliments from all of your teachers.<n><n>Input:It was a sunny day at Lake Erie, where the temperature was 70 degrees.

Get news is a possible answer but it's not relevant to the question.<n>Though is also a strong answer because the word "though" suggests that the letter you receive is important, regardless of why you get it. Strained is a good choice if you're strained to be sure that everything is going correctly, that is also true and could make the letter sound important, although that isn't a strong answer. If you answered A or B, then you might just want the pudding or be curious as to what the news is, which could mean you do not read the letter. Or, you might read it simply just to give your friend a letter, which could not have been read, unless the other answers above have been filled out correctly by the letter.<n>Simply saying though could easily explain the reading of the letter. There are also others that could explain the letter but through seems to be the only strong one.<n>A and C do not relate the question about the reading of the letter, and there is no reason to read the letter if you want any of the other answers related to the question.<n>B and D have no relation to each other and the question does not suggest a straight answer for why you might read it, simply the idea that you read it.

If we multiply 3 * 30, we get 180 pairs of shoes fitting in the blue suit. But we want to know how many pairs of shoes in the blue suit will go with the blue shirt. There must be at least 1

For example, “I don’t like to eat potatoes” is incorrect because you love to eat potatoes even if in small amounts. That being said, there is an answer. Christian does not believe in the bible, but if you consider what it says, you would have to consider yourself a Christian regardless if you believe in the bible or not.

How much more does someone pay for two or more bedroom apartment?  What if the person has four-bedroom apartment?<n>Output: The correct answer is $150 more for a 2-bedroom and $250 more for a three bedroom.<n>If the monthly rent is $900 / 6 rooms then a two bedroom is $900 * 2/6 = $575 per month.<n>A three bedroom would be $900 *3/6 = $750 per month.<n>To find out how much more a person would pay for a three bedroom, $900 - $750 = $150 /month.  $150 is how much more you pay for a three than a two bedroom.<n>To find out if it is much more for a four bedroom, $925 - $750 $ $175/month.  For the answer, it is not much more for a four.<n><n>Input:If John, an avid mountain biker, buys new tires for his expensive mountain bicycle, he will spend either $15 per tire, or $40 for three tires, but he can’t be sure which one he will use because both options are reasonable.

You are defending and the other team only needs to score once to beat you and they only have one shot to win.  Your goalkeeper is a top tier player and is good at reading the position of his teammates on the pitch, so he has an idea where the shot will go.  He saves the ball and the clock is over in your favor. Choices:  A. The goalie has saved the shot and the game is over. B. The game is not over because the soccer teams always get one more shot. C. Since your goalie has saved the ball there must be another soccer team in the way. D. If you are a good soccer team you can't be satisfied with one save and have to come right back and score as many goals as you need to. E. Your goalie saved the shot, he has to save the next shot to make sure you win the game. F. Since there's a shot, he has to get a new pair of shin guards to protect himself in case of another shot.<n>Output: The question was "The goalie saves the ball, the clock runs down, the soccer game has ended right?", and the answer you chose was not D.  If your goalie saved the ball they cannot score again.  If they score after the ball has been saved, then it has not been saved and that's cheating.  So there's no point of answering the question with C.<n><n>Input: There is a group of two hundred, that is 200.  Among the group is a set of 12 who are all in a race.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The car-rental agency charges $30/day for a car, or $190 for the first week for a rental that lasts an entire week or longer. Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Output: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>So the final answer is 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Output: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>So the final answer is 72<n><n>Input: The ratio of boys to girls in a family is 5:7. The total number of children in the family is 180. If the boys are given $3900 to share, how much money does each boy receive?<n>Output: The total ratio representing the number of children in the family is 5+7 = <<5+7=12>>12<n>From the total ratio of children in the family, 5/12 represent the number of boys, meaning that the number of boys in the family is 5/12*180 = <<5/12*180=75>>75<n>If the boys are given $3900 to share, each boy receives $3900/75 = $<<3900/75=52>>52<n>So the final answer is 52<n><n>Input:Where you have finished a conversation with a person what do you say?

To answer this question we put 3+2 first, and then 5+2.  We solve for a=3(5)+2, which gives us a=11.  If we subtract 11 from 16 (which is 5+2) we get 5.<n><n>Input: What is the relationship between the variables a, b, and c?<n>Output: The relationship is between the variable a, which equals 3, and variable b equals 5.<n><n>### Input: The answer is A<n>### Output: 5 is more than 2<n>$$<n>a\cdot b > c<n>$$<n>$$<n>3*5 >4<n>$$<n>$$<n>15 >12$<n>$$<n>### Input: A<n>### Output 1: The answer is 11<n>$$<n>c=\frac{a+\sqrt{a^2-4b}}{2}<n>$$<n>$$<n>\frac{3+3+2}{2} = 11$$<n>$$<n>11 = \frac{3+\sqrt{3^2-4*3}}{2}<n>$$$$<n>11 = 1*3 + \frac{1}{2}(\frac{1+\sqrt{3^5-4*3^2}}{2})<n>$$<n>$$<n>2*1 + \frac{1+\sqrt{\frac{3^5}{4}+1}}{2} = 1<n>$$<n>$$<n>5 = 11-1 = 11 - \frac{4*4}{4}<n>$$<n>$$11 - (25) = \frac{11-25}{2}<n>$$$$\frac{11-0}{2} = 5$$<n>$$<n>\Rightarrow c = 11$$$$<n>\Rightarrow 11 = \frac{(3+\sqrt

Choices:  A: band B: music room C: college D: university E: house<n>Output:		Since he has a college degree, Bill bought an upright for his musical practice.<n>Bill, a college graduate, bought an upright to use as a practice piano. We must therefore conclude that Bill is a serious musician who can play the upright.  If Bill can afford an expensive upright, he is an accomplished musician and therefore chooses his instrument very carefully.<n>Since Bill has a degree in a field other than music, such as philosophy or even accounting, we can conclude that Bill is a self-taught musician, and one who works on piano most likely practices on an upright piano. A person who is serious about playing the piano and who is willing to pay cash for a high-end piano is unlikely to purchase a cheap piano for home use.<n>If Bill plays the piano, he is almost certainly a highly disciplined person, which means he is a musician or is working as one in order to make ends meet.<n>Bill must have bought a piano from the best company available in his price range so Bill is a serious music student with a college degree who can afford an upright piano with no problem at all.<n>So the final answers is A

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The car-rental agency charges $30/day for a car, or $190 for the first week for a rental that lasts an entire week or longer. Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Output: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>So the final answer is 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Output: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>So the final answer is 72<n><n>Input: The ratio of boys to girls in a family is 5:7. The total number of children in the family is 180. If the boys are given $3900 to share, how much money does each boy receive?<n>Output: The total ratio representing the number of children in the family is 5+7 = <<5+7=12>>12<n>From the total ratio of children in the family, 5/12 represent the number of boys, meaning that the number of boys in the family is 5/12*180 = <<5/12*180=75>>75<n>If the boys are given $3900 to share, each boy receives $3900/75 = $<<3900/75=52>>52<n>So the final answer is 52<n><n>Input:What usually happens to people who are models? Choices:  A: very ugly B: appear beautiful C: free slaves D: pay bills E: suffering pain<n>Output:		A<n><n>Input: It takes a 2-hour flight to get from Dallas, Texas to San Francisco, California. An airplane arrives in Dallas from San Francisco 100 minutes after it leaves San Francisco.  When does the plane arrive in San Francisco, given that it takes 2 hours to travel from Dallas to San Francisco?  Hint: Time elapsed at the end of the journey is equal to the time elapsed at the start.<n>Output: Starting with the original destination (in this case Dallas) at the start time of 2:00, you subtract the 100 minutes and reach San Francisco at 12:00. This process is the same you use to get back to the starting time at 2:20. In one case, you took a 2-hour trip, but in the other you took 120-minutes for the same trip. If the flight time is two hours, then you subtract 120 minutes, but you add it back for your return trip. Thus, it will take 2-hour flight time to get from Dallas, TX to SF, CA. So if you take a return flight from SF to Dallas, you will take 2 hour each way for a total of 4 hours. So the actual travel time is 12:05<n><n>Input: The company sells the product for a price of $16.50. If a 7% sales tax is imposed, how much will the tax be?<n>Output: The answer is either A or B (can't remember which) and then the question is asked what if there was a $1 state sales tax too.<n>The answer is 7.222<n><n>Input: What would the discount be when a 10% discount is taken from 50%, given that the total amount is $950?<n>Output: The discount that would be taken from the 50% was 27%. So the remaining amount is 47% of the original amount. So 47% of $950 is $215.35. So subtracting 27 from 50 you get 73. So you take a 73% off of $950 which is $278.73. The total amount would then be $588.32. So A

By what percentage would your average parking cost be lowered if you shop at the grocery store?<n>Output:As per question, the options are the shop that sells hts and gloves and a car in the grocer shop for the donation of food.  Now the average cost = ((((x*12)+(x*$3))+x)/(x*$3+x*(*12)))<n>Here x is the number of hats/gloves you buy.<n><n>The total cost to the average is $48((x*12)/((x*12)*($3/$12))<n>Since we need to cut down the cost by some percentage, now we need to do this in the (x*12)/$48.<n>We can put $48 in both the numerator and denominator to reduce complexity.<n>The new equation we get is $48*((x*12)$48/((x*12*$3/$12)) is $48*12/3.<n>When simplified the expression is $576/4.<n>The expression is a little too complicated to solve so the final answer is not given.<n><n>Input:Ross wants to get as many tickets, as he can, to see a certain play on opening night.

To remedy this, two entrepreneurs in New York City, Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail, developed a device for telegraphic communication (i.e., telegraphy, telegraph, telegram). One of its key components was a keyboard similar to a piano with which the user could manipulate the magnetic contact points within the mechanism to send a message. The telegraph’s electrodynamic components included an “insulated wire (called a “heart”) attached to an “instrument for producing electric action” on the wire. The instrument was a “key” that connected to the wire on the end opposite to a magnet (called “inductor”). A “latch” mechanism was used to “bring into action an electric circuit on the conductor.”<n>Another important development that made it possible to transmit messages was the invention of the “electromagnet.” The electromagnet consists of “an iron core [called a] “lodestone” (or the north pole of a magnet, also called a “magnetic pole”) around which is wrapped a wire called a “coil” or electrical conductor wrapped around the core. This kind of electrical device, which used “electric currents” as its working mechanism, became more important with the invention of “induction,” by Michael Faraday in 1831.<n>Morse’s Telegraph (called an “electro-magnetic relay”) sent its messages via an “intermediate station” along its path. A magnet or “lodestone” activated by the telegraph was used to transmit messages along wires to an electrical circuit.<n>Another inventor (Charles Wheatstone), with Morse’s assistance, completed the second part of the telegraphic communication system: the “sounder,” which used the “key.” The telegraph’s keyboard was a set of wooden keys. During the course of sending a message, each key was pounded or stamped down repeatedly to complete the circuit. That sound was then transformed into a high pitch so that the operator knew that the circuit was complete. The first signal sent through a telegraph

His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

If the coefficient of friction is μ = 0.574, what is the minimum height Δh the box must slide before it can come to rest?<n>Output: the minimum height Δ<h>Δ<h> is 42cm, because sin 2.11º = <sin 2.11°> =<<sin 2.1°> = 0.226, and 0.225 = 5.25, which rounds to 5cm.  And mgh = 12*(5.25)(-9.8), which rounds to 870. So Δ<h> is also 870 cm, which rounds to about 830cm (0.83 m)<n><n>Input: For a race, a runner can choose between a course that is 5.5 miles long and another that is 8.0 miles long.

How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Output: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>So the final answer is 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Output: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>So the final answer is 72<n><n>Input: The ratio of boys to girls in a family is 5:7. The total number of children in the family is 180. If the boys are given $3900 to share, how much money does each boy receive?<n>Output: The total ratio representing the number of children in the family is 5+7 = <<5+7=12>>12<n>From the total ratio of children in the family, 5/12 represent the number of boys, meaning that the number of boys in the family is 5/12*180 = <<5/12*180=75>>75<n>If the boys are given $3900 to share, each boy receives $3900/75 = $<<3900/75=52>>52<n>So the final answer is 52<n><n>Input:What would children do if they are bored? Choices:  A: walk B: change shoes C: play tag D: smell smoke E: reach over<n>Output:		When children are bored, they would play tag<n><n>Input:Annie, Ben and Claire were given chocolates. They had an equal number of chocolates to begin with. Each child took a chocolate at random. Annie is the first to take a chocolate. Find the likelihood that Annie is the first and last child to get a chocolate.<n>Output: This is a situation in which no child knows who gets a chocolate and therefore does not know who had the least number of chocolatereceive. Therefore, if Annie is the first child to receive a chocolate, it means that another child probably did not get a chocolate in at all and as such, is likely to be the last child to receive a choccate, since the child who receives the chocolate in the second spot is the first and last since there are still two chocolates left to distribute<n>So the final answer will be: 1/2<n><n>Input: John and Jane are twins.  They want to divide their collection of toys between them. John has 6 stuffed animals and 7 trucks. Jane has 5 stuffed animals and 1 doll. If they each take a stuffed animal and a truck, and then split all the rest of the toys fairly among themselves, how many trucks will Jane get?<n>Output: John initially has 6 stuffed toys and 7 truck toys and Jane has 5 stuff toys and 1 doll. When John and Jane divide the items, each child will get 5 trucks and 2 stuffed <n>toys<n>Since there are 6+2=<<6+2=8>>8 items in total, John will give 5+2 = <<5+2=7>>7 and Jane will get 5 = <<5=1>>1.<n>Thus, Jane will get 1 truck.<n>

Choices:  A: kitchen B: child's hand C: street D: toy store E: soccer game<n>Output:		There are 4 options given and the correct answer is B, which is child's hand, since we are looking for an object that relates to the ball, we know that kitchen is not a good place to get the ball because we are not looking for the ball, we are looing for an object we hold in our hands, the store is definitely not the best place to find the ball, as well as the soccer ground and for some reason it's asking where is a good place to find the ball on the soccer ground, but lets assume that soccer ground is right beside the kid's playroom, and that is a pretty reasonable guess. The child holds the ball, therefore the correct answer is A, the child's hand.<n><n><n>Input: Which one is correct? 1.  “How was your trip?”    2.  “Have a good trip!” 3.  “Have a nice trip and enjoy it!”<n>Output: The correct answer is 1.

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Output: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>So the final answer is 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Output: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>So the final answer is 72<n><n>Input: The ratio of boys to girls in a family is 5:7. The total number of children in the family is 180. If the boys are given $3900 to share, how much money does each boy receive?<n>Output: The total ratio representing the number of children in the family is 5+7 = <<5+7=12>>12<n>From the total ratio of children in the family, 5/12 represent the number of boys, meaning that the number of boys in the family is 5/12*180 = <<5/12*180=75>>75<n>If the boys are given $3900 to share, each boy receives $3900/75 = $<<3900/75=52>>52<n>So the final answer is 52<n><n>Input:Where would a ficus plant brighten up a room? Choices:  A: middle east B: palace C: dictionary D: pots E: apartment<n>Output:		The answer is: D: Pots.<n>According to this Wikipedia page, Ficus elastica does not belong to a region of the world, but grows in a number of different locations around the world. Thus, D.<n>The Ficus genus contains trees and shrubs; however, they are generally not found in forests, and more often appear in a garden setting. Thus, C.<n>A ficus is not found in a palace; a king would not find a ficus in his castle. (But he would in his garden!) Choice B is thus incorrect as well.<n>We’re left then with choices A and E. A ficus is not found among the spices and herbs of a middle eastern country; a ficus is not found growing in the wilds of a jungle or rain forest. Thus, A is out.<n>The apartment is also not the correct choice. Ficus trees do not naturally grow in an apartment, or a house. Thus, E is incorrect,<n>Thus, B is the correct answer.<n><n>Input: What is the cost of 30 pens, if the cost of x pens is x+10$? Answer: It's 30+10<n>Output: 30 pens - cost is $30<n>There is a cost of $50 for 30 pens, then there is a $5 increase.

Choices:  A: driveway B: the event C: scrap heap D: parking garage E: repair shop<n>Output:		Parking garage<n>Answer choice D is correct<n>So the final answer would be D<n><n>Input: A man owns a parking lot and charges $20/day for parking. He rents the lot out, one space at a time. A man who is going to be in the city for a week requests that he park in the same place each day. Using a spreadsheet, design a function that returns the number of spaces available on each day. Use the value 20 for the cost. The day is a zero-indexed number, from 0 to 6. Here’s how it should work:<n>For Monday, if no_of_spaces(6) - no_of_spaces (0) is negative then the man will not be able to park.<n>If it’s positive and no_of_spaces > $20 the man has to pay the balance.<n>In both cases he should return 1.<n><n>For Tuesday through Sunday, if no_of-spaces (t-1) - is negative and no_of_paces(t) is negative, the man is still parked in the same place but he should return 0.<n>If it’;s positive and no_paces(t) > $20 he will park at that location and needs to pay.<n>In both cases, the man should return 1. <n>Output: The code works as follows: For zero days like Sunday, the final answer is 1.<n><n><n># for each day you are returning a day and then for each day you are subtracting 20<n><n># day 1 you subtract the day before, and you then multiply with 1 to get the day<n># once that is done you do a modulus to get the remainder of the modulus<n># so you know when to return 0<n><n># return 1 when the number is positive and you multiply it to see if its over 20<n># when you do the mod it becomes a negative number<n><n># so 0 to -2 is a negative number<n><n><n># from there you add -2 so that the result is 0, so the final answer is between -4<n><n># and 4<n><n><n># so you add 4 to get back your original value that way you know when its a positive number<n><n>import numpy as np<n><n>class solution1:<n>	'''<n>

The trader ships the following quantities daily by ship, by truck, and by rail: 60 tons by ship, 120 tons by truck, 16 tons by rail.  What is the longest time, in days, it takes the trader to deliver the 500 tons?<n>Output: The ship takes 6 hours to travel from point A to point B. The truck takes 3 hours to travel from point J to point K. The rail takes 3 hours to make the journey from point L to point J. Then the truck is 120/16=<<120/126=2>>2 times faster than the ship. The truck is 2 times faster than the rail. The truck journey lasts 3/2 times longer than the time to travel by rail:<n>3/2*3 = <<3/2*3=3>>3 days.<n>Then the journey by ship is 6/2 = <<6/2=3>>3 times longer than the time travel by truck So the combination of all journeys takes a total of 3 + 3 + 3 = <<3+3+3>>9 times to arrive to the destination given 9 day(s).<n>So the final answer by the combination is of course 9 days.<n><n>Input: How many hours are shown on one clock that has a 49-hour day?<n>Output: From 1 to 49 are 49-1=<<49-1=48>>48 hours.

If the boys are given $3900 to share, how much money does each boy receive?<n>Output: The total ratio representing the number of children in the family is 5+7 = <<5+7=12>>12<n>From the total ratio of children in the family, 5/12 represent the number of boys, meaning that the number of boys in the family is 5/12*180 = <<5/12*180=75>>75<n>If the boys are given $3900 to share, each boy receives $3900/75 = $<<3900/75=52>>52<n>So the final answer is 52<n><n>Input:What is a negative effect to someone other than a spouse when two spouses are getting divorced? Choices:  A: lot of grief B: depression C: no spouse D: lose money E: children suffer<n>Output:		Choice A<n>Sacrificing time, emotion, financial resources and a lot of hard work goes into a marriage and it can be extremely expensive to divorce a spouse due to the court and legal fees, separation costs and child custody fees.<n>Another common negative that many divorcees find themselves facing is depression because they often have to give up the time, energy and investment they’ve put into their marriage in order to start over and begin a new relationship.<n>When a couple decides to end their marriage there are two options available to them: They can continue being involved in their children’s life and work out a mutual living agreement in which the couple can still work together to raise their children or they can take separate ways when they split up.<n>Divorcing may cause a lot of stress and mental health problems that can be difficult to cope with for both parties involved, especially if there are issues about the children. In which case, it is very difficult since the child will get used to having one of their parents with them and now suddenly they lose that parent. It is best that divorcing couples discuss these issues before getting separated so everyone will know how to handle the children afterward.<n>Children become aware of their parents’ problems and often struggle with anger, abandonment issues, depression and anxiety that can cause them to act out at school or at home.<n>So in summary, there are many drawbacks when getting a divorce but the first thing spouses need to do is make sure their personal lives are in order before taking the next steps toward divorcing.

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Output: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>So the final answer is 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Output: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>So the final answer is 72<n><n>Input: The ratio of boys to girls in a family is 5:7. The total number of children in the family is 180. If the boys are given $3900 to share, how much money does each boy receive?<n>Output: The total ratio representing the number of children in the family is 5+7 = <<5+7=12>>12<n>From the total ratio of children in the family, 5/12 represent the number of boys, meaning that the number of boys in the family is 5/12*180 = <<5/12*180=75>>75<n>If the boys are given $3900 to share, each boy receives $3900/75 = $<<3900/75=52>>52<n>So the final answer is 52<n><n>Input:George ruined the surprise.  How did he do so? Choices:  A: hiding B: accidentally C: expectation D: knowingly E: planned<n>Output:		I would say the letter A, B, C, D, E can all be wrong but the right answer is A and the wrong answer is all the rest.<n>In the question George ruined the surprise which means that he intentionally ruined the surprise. He did it knowingly, the correct answer is A<n>The choices are incorrect options because people might not know why they’re being blamed for the surprise but knowingly has that answer right<n><n>Input: There’s one car accident for every 6,600. Given 1000 crashes, what’s the probability there’s an accident?<n>Output:First, we need to find the conditional probability P(x=1|x>=1) and the given data of 1000. This is 6600, so P(x>=1)=P(x=1)=6600/1000<n>Then, we can find the probability from the conditional probability with the complement of P(x>=1) and from the original sample set given. This is P(x>=1|x=1)=.5619129032255884<n>So, we just need to multiply the two probabilities with the total population P(x>=1), and the answer is about.0000001778192488.<n><n>

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Output: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>So the final answer is 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Output: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>So the final answer is 72<n><n>Input: The ratio of boys to girls in a family is 5:7. The total number of children in the family is 180. If the boys are given $3900 to share, how much money does each boy receive?<n>Output: The total ratio representing the number of children in the family is 5+7 = <<5+7=12>>12<n>From the total ratio of children in the family, 5/12 represent the number of boys, meaning that the number of boys in the family is 5/12*180 = <<5/12*180=75>>75<n>If the boys are given $3900 to share, each boy receives $3900/75 = $<<3900/75=52>>52<n>So the final answer is 52<n><n>Input:If electrical equipment won't power on, what connection should be checked? Choices:  A: company B: telephone netwok C: airport D: wires E: freeway<n>Output:		Company<n>Since wires cannot be damaged by external storms, and the wires are not damaged, the company is the only option that remains.<n>The company should be checked first to confirm whether the equipment has not been installed properly. If that is the case, the company's work order should be called for the inspection equipment to be properly installed.<n>The other options do not fit the premise of the prompt.<n>Thus A=<<A=COMPANY>>COMPANY<n>So the final answer was company<n><n>Input: A manufacturing company can produce two types of products: A and B. They produce 100 of each product. What is the minimum number of products that they need to produce to meet an order for 150 of product A and 30 of product B if they cannot manufacture a mix?<n>Output: Choices:  A=<<A=B>>B B=<<B=A>>B<n>From the prompt, 150 of A and 30 B<n>Since the two products are mutually exclusive, the production of 150A and 30B require 120 total products.<n>To produce 150A requires 150/100=1.5 total products.<n>Since B is producing 30, it requires 30/100 = 0.3 products.<n>Subtracting 1.5 from 1.20 totals 0.3<n>For the order to be completed, 150/0.3 = 500 is the total number of products required to meet this order.<n>As B produces the minimum 0.3 of A, A produces the remaining 500.<n>Choose B=<<B=MINIMUM>>MINIMUM<n>So the final answer for the answer choices will be 0.2 and 500.0<n><n>Input: If a person traveling on a highway at 60 m/h can make 72 km in 1/2 hour.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The car-rental agency charges $30/day for a car, or $190 for the first week for a rental that lasts an entire week or longer. Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Output: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>So the final answer is 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Output: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>So the final answer is 72<n><n>Input: The ratio of boys to girls in a family is 5:7. The total number of children in the family is 180. If the boys are given $3900 to share, how much money does each boy receive?<n>Output: The total ratio representing the number of children in the family is 5+7 = <<5+7=12>>12<n>From the total ratio of children in the family, 5/12 represent the number of boys, meaning that the number of boys in the family is 5/12*180 = <<5/12*180=75>>75<n>If the boys are given $3900 to share, each boy receives $3900/75 = $<<3900/75=52>>52<n>So the final answer is 52<n><n>Input:Where can you buy socks and jeans? Choices:  A: washing machine B: laundromat C: clothing store D: closet E: shopping mall<n>Output:		If you could buy a pair of Jeans for $22 and a pair of socks for $2, then each would cost $22+22=$<<22+22=44>>44<n>The closest choices in price for a pair of jeans are $22 and $35<n>The closest choices in terms of price for a pair of socks are $2 and $3<n>The cost of a pair of jeans is $22 and the price of a pair of socks is $2, then $22/2 = <<22/2=11>>11<n>So the final answer for the price of a pair is 11<n><n>Input:How long did it take Luna to finish her art project? Choices:  a: 5 days b: 7 days c: 9 days d: 13 days<n>Output:The cost of the art project is $8. If you spend twice as long on a project than it does to finish the project (Luna spent 5 days), it would cost twice that much than what you paid for it originally. $8 x 2 = $<<8*2=16>>16<n>If she spent 9 days on the project, that would cost $8 x 4 = <<8*4=32>>32<n>Thus, Luna paid $<<8*4=31>>31.<n>However, she did spend 7 days on the project by the choices given. So we have to find 7 day times 4. $7 x 4 = <<7*4=20>>28<n>Since 28 is closer to 24 than 31, we have to add 3 to get 31 = 32 - 1<n>The final answer is 32<n><n>Input:Taking a standard geometry test,  you may get three questions that aren’t like the rest and if you answer those questions correctly, you get 10 points instead of 1, for each correct answer. How many points have you earned if you got three questions right?<n>Output: You have earned 10 points.<n>1*1*1=<<1*1*1==1>>1<n>So the final  answer is 1<n><n>Input:If A=1(one), B=2(two), and C=3(three

Choices:  A: fresh fruit B: wine press C: fruit basket D: fruit cocktail E: picnic basket<n>Output:		The whole grape can’t just be processed into wine so we need to decide amongst ourselves on what we are going to use it for.<n>Choice A: The word for fresh means “just like when you bought it.” The word is used for when you are describing someone/thing without the modifications that weighs the value. If you have a small grape and you are going to use everything, you are eating the grape raw.<n>Choice B: There are two parts to the word for wine. You can have fresh wine (grape juice) or aged wine (wine that has been modified by different techniques, such as adding yeast for the wine to ferment). The word for wine is when you are “using wine as you bought it.” Both grapes and fruit baskets are made for eating unaltered. If you are making wine or eating fruit, you are not processing it and using it for its original state.<n>Choice C: The word for fruit basket is defined as “to cover.” Baskets are used for carrying items and the word for covering means “to store.” We use fruit baskets to carry fruit, so that must mean that we are processing it for use. Fruit cocktail is “to mix.” If we’re mixing fruit from many different sources, we must be processing the grapes because we are not going to mix all the fruit.<n>Choice D: When used for wine the word means “to drink.” But it will not be drinkable at the end anyways. So use it for a basket.<n>Choice E: The word means “to transport,” which means “to change how it’s used.” A basket does not transport wine, a basket transports grapes. And we must process and use the grapes so that tells us that it was not used for a fruit basket. <n>So the final answer will be choice A.<n><n>Input: A certain 5-letter word contains 3 double letters and 2 triple letters.

Choices:  a, b, c, d, e, f, g <n>Output: The fifth letter of the alphabet is “e”. So the sixth letter must follow that pattern and be the next letter in the alphabet after “e” which is “f”.<n>a to f is six letters.<n>But b to f because it doesn’t include “e” is five letters.<n>The alphabet is only 26 letters and the question was only 7 letters.<n>So the answer could only be “f”, and c is an option, but c isn’t the shortest distance between a and f.<n>So the final solution is “f”<n><n>Input:What are the next three letters of the alphabet after o?<n>Choices:  a,b,c,...z<n>Output: The next three letters of the Alphabet are “p,q and r”. <n>p is the next letter which is one letter from “o”, and q and r are 2 letters from “p”, so p, q, and r<n>P is the first letter and O is not it’s shortest distance.<n>So the alphabet must be “oo” and P is the shortest distance, because there is no “ooo”<n>So the final answer choice is “p”<n><n>Input:  How long is 8 1/4 in meters? Choices:  meters = 12.54 millimeters = 55 centimeters = 2.54 inches<n>Output: Since we started off with 8.25, the second length must be 8.75, and the last length must be 9.<n>The 9.0 is the first option.<n>The 8.75 is the second option.<n>

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The car-rental agency charges $30/day for a car, or $190 for the first week for a rental that lasts an entire week or longer. Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Output: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>So the final answer is 72<n><n>Input: The ratio of boys to girls in a family is 5:7. The total number of children in the family is 180. If the boys are given $3900 to share, how much money does each boy receive?<n>Output: The total ratio representing the number of children in the family is 5+7 = <<5+7=12>>12<n>From the total ratio of children in the family, 5/12 represent the number of boys, meaning that the number of boys in the family is 5/12*180 = <<5/12*180=75>>75<n>If the boys are given $3900 to share, each boy receives $3900/75 = $<<3900/75=52>>52<n>So the final answer is 52<n><n>Input:What are adult people usually expected to do? Choices:  A: shake hands B: own property C: pay bills D: smoke E: talk to each other<n>Output:		Each individual person can be classified in one of three categories: adult, young, or child.<n>Adults are those that, on average, will be older than teenagers (including both teenagers that are legal adults but younger than adults and other adults).<n><n>For purposes of comparing age in this question, young is defined as any age below that of adults.<n>Therefore, the answer is B.<n><n>Input: What are people in general expected to do? Chooses:  A: talk to each other B: smoke C: eat D: shake hands E: take care of their elders<n>Output: As described in Instruction B, adults can be classified as belonging in certain categories whereas all others cannot.<n>This means that the category that people should be expected to belong to is adults.<n>There are no other answers that specify anything about age.<n><n>Input: Is this your first time meeting? Choice:  A: the speaker B: the listener C: a new topic D: an old topic<n>Output: People that are meeting for the first time will most likely not be familiar with one another.<n>This means that it is impossible for the first meeting to be between two people who are familiar with each other.<n>Thus the answer is A.<n><n>Input: This is a good day. Choices:  A. The weather is fine B. I have plenty of energy C. I ate a good lunch D.

If the boys are given $3900 to share, how much money does each boy receive?<n>Output: The total ratio representing the number of children in the family is 5+7 = <<5+7=12>>12<n>From the total ratio of children in the family, 5/12 represent the number of boys, meaning that the number of boys in the family is 5/12*180 = <<5/12*180=75>>75<n>If the boys are given $3900 to share, each boy receives $3900/75 = $<<3900/75=52>>52<n>So the final answer is 52<n><n>Input:Where would you see some people doing jumping jacks? Choices:  A: military base B: opera C: water fountain D: bus stop E: church<n>Output:		The correct answer is :C<n><n>Input: A certain drug is administered on day 1. A different drug is administered for 5 days thereafter.  Each drug must be taken daily or no doses should be administered for the entire 6 days.  How many possible ways are there to administer the correct drugs on consecutive days?<n>Output:  It is assumed that day 1 is day 1.  The problem can be solved in numerous ways.<n><n>For a 6 days, 5 drugs, (1,1,1,1) problem, there are 5!/2!=<5!/(5-2)!>=<<5!/2!=6>>6 ways to choose the first day & the second, (1,1)<n>There are 5!/2!=[5!/(5-1)!]=<<5!/2!=[6!/(6-1)!]=112>>5!=112 ways to choose the third day & the fourth, (1,1)(1,1), thus the number of choices at this time, including those already selected (1,1) is 112+6=<<112+6>>98<n><n>Since there are only 5 days in total, and the choices for the 2nd 5th and 6th days are ≤1 because those days are fixed and don’t change, to find the number of choices at each point, just use an expression that cancels out the value of 5 which should be removed from the numerator of any fraction.<n>So, 98 has 6 as its highest value, and 692 has 8, which has the highest value of any possible choice.  So, there are 8 ways to assign the 6th day.<n>The first 4 assignments contain all possible combinations (since those are the first 4 choices).  So, to find the answers to (1,1,2,2,2), (1,1,3,3,3), (1,2,3,4,4), and (1,1,5,6,6), you just need to find how many ways there are to choose any one of those values 6 times.<n><n>If we use the mathematical notation, 6! to represent the possible 6 values of the last day, since every possible 5

His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

You want to buy 5 pounds of dog food, but you can’t find the exact 5-pound bag. Find an amount at the store that will cost the same as exactly 5 pounds.<n>Output: I find that if the dog food cost $5$5 per pound, then 5 pounds cost $5$5$. So if the store gives you $2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 pounds of food for free, then buying $10$10 would also give you 5 pounds. So the cost of 5 pounds is $<<5=$5>>$10/5=200/5=40>>$10/2=50$/5*40>>40$/5*5$<<5*$5$>>200<n>So the answer is 2$00>>2$00<n><n>Input : At a company with a 5500 people working there and they give 100$ to each employees for attending a conference.

When you drink coffee, the caffeine is quickly absorbed into the bloodstream through the small blood vessels in your mouth, esophagus, and stomach (gastrointestinal tract). Once in your bloodstream, it’s carried to the blood-brain barrier, which is a semipermeable membrane that separates the blood from the brain. Once there, caffeine attaches to specific sites in the brain, triggering a series of molecular changes that lead to better mood, longer memory for recent events, and improved performance on mental alertness tests.<n><n>E:  There are two roads to every city, one which is straight and one where there is a detour.

Choices:"I don't know" "1 in 3" "8 in 10" "23 in 26" "3 in 2"<n>Output: Choice 1- "I don't know", I need to calculate the odds of selecting a blue marble from the Marble. I can determine odds by dividing: (100(number of blue marbles)/36(total number of marbles)) or ((100/36)*(3/2). Because there must be atleast one blue marble selected with 2 choices you will select the correct blue marble 2-1=<<2-1=1>>1 time in 2 total attempts which means your odds are 1 in 2<n>Choice 2- "6 in 12", you were given 12 choices but only 6 are blue marbles so it's a 6/12 ratio which would give you 1 blue marble, but this doesn't add up so your odds are 50%<n>Choice 3- "18 in 29"- You don't know at all how many marbles are blue or what the odds are because there are multiple blue marbles in the bag. But since option 1 says "the only blue ones" it must mean there is only 1 blue option, you can just eliminate option 3. option 2 is the correct answer<n>Choice 4- "20 in 29" because the odds is calculated, you would have to have atleast one choice for it to be true.<n><n>## Answer Instructions:Answer all three multiple-choice questions from [Part 1](https://github.com/mrubino/Python/tree/master/part-1-of-4/homework).<n><n>## Answer:<n><n>## Required Answer: How many marbles from the following bag will contain green?<n><n>In order to determine this, how many marbles do I need to add to total of "Total?"

The rest of the answers are present-day idioms. Because “come back” is a quote, the best answer choice is “at home,” which matches the source text.<n>The sentence says he went “away” because his parents were fighting, not “back” or “home.” He would go home after the fighting ended.

Choices:  All: yesterday A: yesterday; tomorrow B: yesterday; tomorrow 2 Choices: All: yesterday  C: yesterday D: yesterday<n>Output: When Mary said, "I got work yesterday," she meant "I received homework on Wednesday."<n>And to follow the pattern, she said "I get more tomorrow" because "I" is the same in the subject line and the ending line, and "work" is the same in both lines.<n>Since "I got work yesterday" means "I received work yesterday" and "I get more tomorown" means "I will receive more work tomorrow", it is clear that the first answer is choice C.<n>The second question about "I get more tomoorown" is confusing because in the 2nd part, she is saying "tomorrwo", not "tomorem", so "tomorrow" is not the correct answer.<n><n>Input: What color is a purple cow?

It has been scientifically proven that the earth is not flat. It is a ball that has no edge. It is impossible for a plane to be flying over the edge of the world for the simple fact that there is no edge. Choices: A: It is impossible for a boat to sail above the clouds, since they are underneath the earth, and not on the earth. B: As you can see, a plane can easily fly above a boat or other water vessel in order to prove that there is no edge to the earth. C: It is possible to observe that there are stars located in the night sky directly above the surface of that earth, meaning that the earth has no edges below, around, or above itself. D: There are many people that have seen and photographed the edges of the earth, meaning that the Earth is flat.<n>Output: The belief in a flat earth was once widely held, even by some astronomers and explorers of the time.  In fact, many early explorers of the Americas did not believe that the earth was round.  Early explorers such as Christopher Columbus were even ridiculed for being out of touch with mainstream opinion on the fact that the earth is round.  Later empirical observation made from the invention of the telescope and more accurate ways of making measurements, lead to the understanding that the earth is indeed flat. A more plausible answer is the existence of clouds on or just below the earths surface

Therefore, they were not used to calculate anything other than phone calls.  At the time that we launched the iPhone 5, the calculators in smart watches were extremely primitive.  There weren’t many features on these tiny devices.  Most people still had smartphones.<n>But at one time, it was cutting edge to use miniature calculators that you could carry with you everywhere.  In 1977, Hewlett-Packard launched the HP-35, which was small enough to fit in a briefcase.  Since then, some people have had their own personal miniature calculator—a watch.  One can find a range of price options for watches that can fit a calculator—$30 to $20,000+.<n>Before computers became popular, people used to carry around handheld calculators, because they were the smallest, portable, personal computers at the time.  Then, briefcases started to include calculators.<n>Desktops were not portable, however.  They were bulky and didn’t fit in a briefcase, so calculators were not included in briefcases.  They have become obsolete—only some desktops have built-in calculator features.<n>So the final answers are:<n>A: mobile phones used<n>B: Briefcases<n>C: mobile phones used

After that election, the Republicans had eight more representatives and one more senator. The ratio of members in the U.S. House of Representatives to members in the U. S. Senate was 88/99. What was the ratio of votes received by the Democrats to votes received by the Republicans?<n>Output: Given two ratios, it’s easy enough to derive the third ratio.<n>Let the ratio of votes received to members in the House of Representatives represent the first variable x, which will now be called HR. Likewise, let the ratio of votes received from members to members of the Senate represent the second variable x, which will be called SR.<n>The third ratio for this problem is the ratio of votes received over both HR and SR, since it represents the amount of votes received over both the House and the Senate. Let’s call this final variable VR. Since VR can be derived by taking the value of votes received over HR and then subtracting votes received over SR to get VR — votes received over both Houses of Congress, use simple math to solve the problem:<n>HR * VR = VR<n>HR + SR = HR + SR<n>VR*(HR + SR)/HR + SR = VR * HR/(HR + SR)<n>VR = HR[HR + SR

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Output: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>So the final answer is 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm.

Last year the shop made $34,420 selling bicycles, and $32,980 selling parts. How much does the shop earn per year if it always sells the same number of bicycles and parts?<n>Output: The shop always sells the same amount of bicycles and the same amount of parts.<n>The amount of money does the shop make per year if it always buys the same number of bicecles is 3% more, or 3% per bicycle, while it earns the same amount of money, or the same percentage, for each part.<n>Therefore, if the bicecle shop always sells the exact same number of bicyles each year, then it would make $41,061 per year.  Since this answer does not use the original numbers, we will need to set up an equation to solve this problem.<n>$41,060 = $34,415 + (3*3,4415), where P is the price of a bike, x is the number of bicycles sold, and a is a constant.<n>If you divide both sides by (3x), then you get x = $6,476.  Therefore, $A = 6476.<n>$6476/2 = 6126, which can be translated into: $34,126 = $32,928.875<n>Since it’s a round number, we can divide $34,130 by 3 (the new $34,4410) and get $11,376, which is the final answer.

On the other hand, if person had E as an outgoing trait, then E would likely be attracted to a person that is good-looking, owns a nice house and has the best accessories.<n>This is a perfect situation for E, because there are millions of people in this world who are willing to have the house and great looking wives, and this person is one of them with an outgoing trait that is A, B, and especially C.<n>Answer: (10) Out of the 5 questions, we can be certain that we chose between A and B since I believe that A would be selected over B by the most people, due to its simplicity and ability to represent people who seek playfulness, fun, and a good time.

Personality A is open and relaxed and has a more laid back, go with the flow attitude toward meeting new people and going out to dinner. It would make sense to me that a person such as this, would love going out and meeting new people, as it would feel more comfortable to someone who enjoys being with others, going out, and trying new things.<n>Personality type B is more inclined to be introverted and very careful when dealing with people and situations. Their personality is to always be overly cautious and careful. This is a personality that I do not think would be so keen on meeting new people or going out on the town to dine, as they would most likely be very hesitant to do anything spontaneous or that is not

For example, if X=43 and Y=34 then Y would need to be smaller than 43. We rewrite the equation to show the Y age difference. 3(Y+3)=X or Y will equal Y=3(37)=11 and X=44.<n><n>So the father is 44 and the son is 11.<n><n>Input: A company will send two packages.

The union president says we should use the number 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15.  If we add these numbers and then divide the result by the total number of members, 105, we can obtain a reasonable wage.

How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Output: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>So the final answer is 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Output: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>So the final answer is 72<n><n>Input: The ratio of boys to girls in a family is 5:7. The total number of children in the family is 180. If the boys are given $3900 to share, how much money does each boy receive?<n>Output: The total ratio representing the number of children in the family is 5+7 = <<5+7=12>>12<n>From the total ratio of children in the family, 5/12 represent the number of boys, meaning that the number of boys in the family is 5/12*180 = <<5/12*180=75>>75<n>If the boys are given $3900 to share, each boy receives $3900/75 = $<<3900/75=52>>52<n>So the final answer is 52<n><n>Input:In what place could you find air that has been breathed by many people recently? Choices:  A: charming B: space shuttle C: house D: train station E: surface of earth<n>Output:		Choice E<n><n>Answer: I don't think there is any point to asking this question when the answers are all different.<n><n>Answer: No, because when you breathe a second time, that air is not as old. If it had not been breathed, it would still be old air. I think the air in question is the air we are exhaling, with the possibility of us taking in a breath from someplace that has recent air.<n><n>Answer: You are correct. I am assuming that air is air, and that it can't be both new and old at the same time.<n><n>Answer: I'm not sure this is a multiple choice question. There are 5 answers in all, and you can pick any one of them.

However, that is not all you should do, which is what I mean by "hold onto it first, then lift up once you lose your grip". In the event that you lose your grip all of your options are still standing. It makes the sense of trying it again, because the next time you pick up an object it is very likely it will slip from your grasp.

So the first choice can be removed. The transpose of only the first row does not have a effect on the matrix. Therefore, I subtracted the transpose of the first row. I got 3,8,9. I knew that A did not produce 9 so I eliminated it. So there are 4,7,8 matrices. (4 different transposes)<n><n>Input: We are given a 4x4 square of integers. The square is partitioned into four equal portions and each portion is added together. Then the parts are summed over and added to the next group and so on. Answer is given as 252, the sum of the parts after four partitions. How do we get the sum of the final parts?<n>Output: As each square’s values are added together, the smaller squares (4x3 or 4x2) are added together first. The small squares add together like the large squares. The same goes for the large squares (2x4 or 3x5). The large squares add together like the small squares. This shows that the values add in the same way. So the final total is sum of the parts over four partitions which is equal to the sum of the values in a 1

How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Output: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>So the final answer is 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Output: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>So the final answer is 72<n><n>Input: The ratio of boys to girls in a family is 5:7. The total number of children in the family is 180. If the boys are given $3900 to share, how much money does each boy receive?<n>Output: The total ratio representing the number of children in the family is 5+7 = <<5+7=12>>12<n>From the total ratio of children in the family, 5/12 represent the number of boys, meaning that the number of boys in the family is 5/12*180 = <<5/12*180=75>>75<n>If the boys are given $3900 to share, each boy receives $3900/75 = $<<3900/75=52>>52<n>So the final answer is 52<n><n>Input:If I am a person, I have a unique ability to do what?

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The car-rental agency charges $30/day for a car, or $190 for the first week for a rental that lasts an entire week or longer. Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Output: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>So the final answer is 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Output: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>So the final answer is 72<n><n>Input: The ratio of boys to girls in a family is 5:7. The total number of children in the family is 180. If the boys are given $3900 to share, how much money does each boy receive?<n>Output: The total ratio representing the number of children in the family is 5+7 = <<5+7=12>>12<n>From the total ratio of children in the family, 5/12 represent the number of boys, meaning that the number of boys in the family is 5/12*180 = <<5/12*180=75>>75<n>If the boys are given $3900 to share, each boy receives $3900/75 = $<<3900/75=52>>52<n>So the final answer is 52<n><n>Input:The person put on lotion, what did they want? Choices:  A: fresh smell B: good credit C: smooth skin D: fresh produce E: headache<n>Output:		<n>Choice A would not help as it would not address the need to relieve soreness.<n>Choice D would not assist as it has been determined that the person did not have any headache pain.<n>Choice B would not help, as it would not help to address their needs.<n><n>Choice C indicates a solution as it will help the person to relieve the soreness.<n><n>So the final answer the choices A,B,C,D,E are not valid.<n><n><n>

A medieval castle doesn’t transmit signals, it just says medieval castle. The city wouldn’t transmit signals unless they had towers, it doesn’t just says cities. That leaves A and E that are towers, if I was going on my original assumption that we’re not talking about cities, and I knew that this person had asked me this at least once, A would be the answer. But since not everyone in the real world has asked me this, it’s possible it could be the tower in a city, it’s probably not though<n><n>Input: How many days of rain have there been in the current month?

His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

A football game consists of 12 segments worth of time for both offense and defense times, equal to 12 segments times 15 minutes plus 7 segments left over.  What is the total amount of time that corresponds to 18 segments worth of time on the field?<n>Output: The "length of a football" needs to be reevaluated as the phrase "a football field" means something is either a little over or a little less than 100 yards.<n>By simplifying the time into segments, we find that each segment is worth approximately 6 minutes and 40 seconds.  We also find that each 6 segments worth of time is equal to 1 segment worth of time.  Since one segment is worth of 6 minutes and 30 seconds, 2 segments are worth 12 minutes and 20 seconds.<n>By combining these findings, we can find that 18 segments represents 5 segments in regards to time in a football game.  Therefore, 5 * 6 minutes and 20 plus 7 = <<5*6+20=42>>42 minutes.<n>So the final minutes is 42<n><n>Input: You play in a league where your team can win the championship by winning 90% of the games in a season.

Choices:  A: satisfied B: unnecessary C: luxury D: sufficient E: extra<n>Output:		Answers are provided here for your convenience. You should read them carefully and then enter the selection as the answer to the question. You may find some of the answers more or less clear than the others. If that's the case with any of the question's answers, please explain to the professor why you chose the answer.<n>A: What would satisfaction be? Wouldn’t something be satisfying for you if you don’t need it? The definition of satisfaction is the accomplishment of one's desire, wish, or goal. If I didn’t need it, it’s not necessary. If it’s not necessary, it certainly is not essential. Then it cannot be considered to be an essential, it can be considered to be something that someone has decided is not essential. In this case, the other four answers would be much more clear in the context of the statement.<n>B: Something unnecessary is simply something not needed. Something needed is considered to be something that you need. If you do not need, then it is by definition unnecessary.<n>C: Something luxury would just be not necessary. You just can’t say, by definition, that something is a luxury if you’re not saying that it’s important or useful.<n>D: Something sufficient is considered to be enough to meet one's needs. If you do not, in fact, need it, it's not sufficient. It isn’t sufficient, it is simply not useful. It serves no purpose. If it is not useful, then, by definition, you don’t need to use it.<n>E: Something extra means that it just goes a little bit beyond what you need. It's something that you have decided to have and you consider to be additional to what you need. By definition, if something is not extra to you, then it’s not extra, it is something additional to what you consider to be important.<n>If it’s something additional to what you find to be important, then it is something that you decided not to find to be important.<n><n>

The hurricane's path stretched from the Panhandle of Florida, through Alabama and Mississippi, all the way to Virginia.  According to the following passage, where in the United States do many people most often think of the term "hurricane"?<n>The word HURRICANE describes the storm that wreaked havoc in the Caribbean many years ago, but today, it is a word used by many people in the Southern United States to describe a severe tropical storm. Hurricane Opal, which reached Category 4 status with winds of 125 mph, was the most damaging of the severe storms that occurred in Florida and the Alabama Gulf Coast. At least 665 people died in the U.S. when the storm struck.  But most people in the U.S., especially those living in the Southern states, know just how destructive and dangerous hurricanes can be.  Hurricane Hugo, for example, touched down on St. Helena Sound, approximately 25 miles north of Charleston, S.C., as a Category 4 storm on September 22, 1989.  The winds reached almost 150 mph, and the result was complete destruction, including the deaths of seven

James, a retired accountant, parks his car on the street for two months. He pays $20. 2. Steve, a college student, gets a ticket on the first day he parks on the street, but when he goes to court he pays the fine and puts the ticket out of his mind. This happens two more times before the court tells him that he must pay or else his license gets suspended. Even though he didn’t get caught for three days, he is charged for all four days. He pays $90 in fines. 3. Melissa, a working mother, parks her car in an illegal spot for twelve days before she gets a ticket. She can’t afford the cost and is afraid to lose her license, so she pays the fine the next day. She pays another fine fifteen days later when she gets another ticket. She also gets a third ticket six days after that, and pays that fine, too. Then three more days later she gets a ticket for another unauthorized parking place, and she pays that fine, too, even though she’s almost out of money. She pays a total of $310. 4. Mary, a high school senior, parks her car on the street for five consecutive days. She gets a ticket on the sixth day so she pays the fine and continues on her way. 1. James 2. Steve 3. Melissa 4.

It is currently on top of a building.  To get the dog, we need to fly from the top of the building to the ground which takes 5 min.  We then need to drive in a car to the house.  It takes a car 15 min to get to the house.  Once at the house, we need to take the dog to the vet and the vet is 7 min away.  Finally we need to fly with the dog back on the building.  The total airplane duration is 30 min, and the total car duration is 15 min.  A.  How long will it take to get the dog back from the vet? B.  How many minutes total do it take to get the small dog back to its owner (inclusive of the time to get to the vet)? C.  If A is 20 and B is 90, what could the initial distance between the dog and its owner have been? D.  (Hint: 5+13 is the correct answer, but it is not a correct answer to the question asked by the question designer.  The question designer asks about the total duration.)<n>Output:<n>A. Since all we know is that A is 20 so let say we get the dog back by 5 min then:<n>Total duration=(20=15)+<<20=15>>15 min+15 min+5 min = 30+15+10 ===> 60/15<n>B. Total duration = 60/10, so 60 min is the final answer since its inclusive of the time to drive to the vet.<n>C. Initial distance between the dog and owner is <<5+13=18>>18 minutes<n><n>D. 60 = 15+13+5, so let's say the initial time is 13 minutes.

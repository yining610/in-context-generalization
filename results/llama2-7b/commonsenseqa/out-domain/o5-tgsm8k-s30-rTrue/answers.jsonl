State park is excluded in the fourth question along with garden and gym where he needs a rest area.  Bus Depot, A or B may be the right answer for the fourth question, but a bus depot is not a good place to be after doing a lot of hard work on a hobby, when you would most likely be in the garden (since horticulture is a hobby), which is the third question's correct answer.  If it is a garden, he may be at rest in the rest area.

If they now increase it to $15.00 per hour, what happens to their hourly labor cost?\nRationales:: For increased labor to equal higher pay, the costs for a workers should go up by at least as much as the wages.\nThe cost of labor at $12.5 is ($12.5/$5.0 = <<$125/$5.0=$25.0>>50\nNow if we increase labor rate to $15. What we do is, we increase (15/5) for the total hourly cost.\nTherefore the new total hourly cost for $15/5 = <<$15/5=$3.0>>3\nWe have to increase our rates from $5 to $3.

{"text": "### If a student's response was one of the following:\n1. James is a vampire he must have moved to the city because he doesn't like tall towers.  He likes the city instead of the clouds.\n2. James doesn't like the clouds.  He is tired of looking at them.  He would prefer living in a tower so that he can watch the clouds as he looks out his window.  \n### Instruction to the student:\nIf we let d represent any number of days and t represent time, then for a single d we can represent it by time, and for t hours, we can express it by d.  For example, 4 hours represent four hours and 32 minutes and 45 seconds, and thus we have 2 d and 59 t.  The same goes for time, where one day equals 24 hours.  So if we let j represent any number of days, then we can represent it by t and vice-versa and thus for 4 days can be represented by 2 d and 1 t of 24h.  This time, for 2 d, we would have 2 t and 9 h, but for 3 d, we would have time representing 3 t.  \n### Demonstiation:\nGiven that James is tired of looking at the clouds, we need to account for the time he would have spent if he didn't look at the clouds.  In order to do this, when we write the time in the clouds column, we need to include the two times in which James saw the clouds (24h).  Thus, to find out how many hours he spent looking at them, 24h would be subtracted from the total, and we would have:  \n### Given:\nThe solution involves accounting for the time during which James was able to see clouds.  In order for this to be done, any number of time a person watches the clouds can be divided in half, and 24 can then be subtracted from that value.  Thus, when we say 3d, we mean 3 t of 24=<<3*24=216>>216h, when we say 6d, we mean 6 t of 24 = <<6*24=144>>144", "answer": "C: city"}

The Minoan Palace in Herate is one of the largest archaeological sites in Greece, and has been open to the public for over 65 years.

After spending a day exploring this ancient civilization, one could spend the night in the Greek city of Zante, which I highly recommend.

The cost of 81 items should yield a $700 or less number.\n\n$D$\n\n### Output:\nThere were 80 purchased items because the two hundredths (20/100=20%) is.2 so when subtracted from 818 we have 80.\n\n### Rationale:\nFor every two hundredths decimal point, the number has to subtracted by two hundredths to get the integer of the number. The two hundreds of a number times the.2 cancels out the hundreds meaning that with every 3 decimal points substraction, only one other number besides the decimal is removed.\n\n### Input $S$:\n$$\\begin{matrix} \\array{ {{{.001} \\Rightarrow.00 \\mbox{\\; or \\;}} {0.01 \\Rightarrow 1.00 \\mbox{\\;\\;}} } \\\\ {{{.01 \\Rightarrow.10 \\mbox{\\;or\\;}} {0.11 \\Rightarrow 11.0 \\mbox{\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;}} } \\\\ {\\vdots} } \\\\  } \\end{matrix}$$\n\n### Choices:\n\nThere are 20 decimal places left or\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} \\array{ {{0. 00. 0. 0. } \\\\... \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\\\. \\;\\;\\;\\}} \\\\ {\\vdots} \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n### Rationales:\nTo solve the expression for the number of decimal places left, we take all the powers to negative ones.

The inputs are also different, for example, length vs. mass or surface area vs. volume.\n### For direct proportion, the ratio of two values can be compared with an unchanging constant and the equation follows y=mx \n### For an indirect proportional function, both inputs need to be the same. For example (0.33)(10)=3.3 or 33% \n### Both inputs are equivalent for different amounts for example (10)(x)=$10^x$ or (7)(5)=35\n### Proportionality is also known as linear dependence, because the relationship between inputs and outputs is linear.

There are 10 men at the station waiting to travel. If one man takes up 15% of the space of a seat, how many men can fit in the train if there are 3 empty seats left?\nRationales : The train have 3 empty seats available\nWe divide the train capacity by 15% to know the number of the people who can fit.\n15/100=<<15/10=1>>1 people in the train\nSo for 1 seat that have the capacity to seat 2 people we can get 2/1/100=1/50 people. \n\nSince the 3 seats are available we must multiply the value we have until we get to capacity of the train. \n3/50=1/17\n\n#### Answer: 5\n\n### 2:\nInput: 30 people are in line at the cash register.

Of course, you don\u2019t want the growing value of the money to become too high because at that point, your economy will be experiencing a very serious problem that\u2019s known simply as inflation, and when inflation occurs, prices of goods and services will almost certainly increase as well, even if the economic growth you got is the result of growing employment and business, both of which create more money than there is already.  So fighting the inflation caused by this economic growth isn\u2019t exactly what you\u2019d want to even do!\n\nThe passage describes this notion of inflation, but in the first sentence, it mentions inflation\u2019s effect in increasing prices, whereas in the second sentence, it says the effect of economic growth on inflation being caused by the economic growth.  \n\nFrom the passage itself, it is seen that sometimes it \u2018is even what\u2019 refers to spending more on good and services, which makes prices increase as well\n\n#### \nAnswer: C\n\n## Exercise:\n\n### Instructions:\nProvide a response that completes the request.

Each fish can eat 6.4 pounds of seafood per week. If each person consumes 9.4 pounds of sea food per week, how many of these fish can a person eat each week?\n\n### Response\nIf everyone consumes 9.7 pounds of seafood a week then there are 9.4 pounds - 9.7 pounds = 0.3 pounds of difference.  If everyone consumes the 9.4 pounds per week then there would be a 30.1 pound difference.  However, this can be overcome using the following equation: (9.4 pounds - (6.4 pounds))/3 = 0.2 pounds.

{"text": "A: open letter\nB: thank god\nC: say goodbye\nD: bless you\nE: listen to radio.\n\n### Input : One who likes reading chooses all sorts of books from his favourite author. He is very fond of reading detective novels. He borrows the books from his friends and read all the novels. It is a month in which he borrowed eleven detective novels and returned thirteen of them to his friends. One and a half months after he had returned the novels, he borrowed one more detective novel but before reading it he remembered that he had read a half of it before. How much number of days after borrowing and returning them he read the novel again?\n\n### Response :\nIt was 5 and half months after he borrowed the book and half of a month later he had returned it. (<<< 5 + 5 + 5.5 = 15.5 >> )\n\nSince the boy had to travel a month and a half to read the novel, his travel time was a month. (<< 15.5 = 31 >> )\n \nSince the boy had traveled to read the novel, he would have arrived in << 31 = 30.5 >> 30.5 days.\n\nIf you add the number of days spent returning the novel, you get that he was << 30.5 + 1 and half = 32 >> 32 and a half days to read the novel.\n\nNow, if we subtract 32 days for his traveling to read the novel, and add a number of days for returning the novel, we get that he was <<  32 - 32 = 0>> 0 and one half days to read the the novel.\n\n###Instruction:\nWhat is a sum of all rational numbers?

I will find the weight of wood in lbs/100 lb, and then multiply by the answer.\nI will then subtract the number of days left in the month, 20 to get the answer 45 lbs.\n\n### The number of times that a person is allowed to drive a vehicle after his license expires is governed by the law.\n\n### Ratios:\nSince a 30 day license expires after 60 days, you are allowed to drive 30/60=0.5=<<0.5>>0.5 days after the expiration date.\nA 2 year license expires after 48 months, so you are allowed to drive for that amount of time, 48/24=2=<<2>>2 days after the expiration.\nIf both a 60 day and 48 month license are held, which will allow driving after the expiration date has occurred?\n\n### The most likely answer is 4.\n\n### If the license holder was 20 years old when he got his license, multiplying 20 by 60-1 gives you 1200 - 61 = 1139.

Watson rushed back to Gray\u2019s shop and told him he had just talked into a tin can. When Gray could not believe it, Watson again tried his invention.\n\nIt worked and he reported, \u201cMr. Bell, your experiment works.\u201d\n\nBell\u2019 first model of his telephone worked in March, 1876. Two years later, in February of 1878, a telephone line 30 miles long was built and used to connect Sanders to Boston.\n\n### 1.

How many girls are in the family?\n\nRationales :\nThe ratio of boys to girls is?\n\nTo solve this, we must first figure out the ratio of boys to boys, which is 3: 4\nThe boys in the family form a group, 3: 4, and the girls in that group form another ratio.\n\nThe question asked how many girls are in the famil, so to start we must figure out the ratio again, since we know the numbef of girls, 40\nSo the ratio we need is 4:\n\n40 boys / 70 boys\n= 4/=\n\nWe now know the ratio of boys to girls, but since boys is in the denominator, in this case, the number of girls is larger than the boys (1/2=< than 1/1=/2> ), so we need to multiply by that ratio to get the answer. We simply multiply the numerator and denominator to get the new ratio.\n80/100=<\n\nThe ratio of boys : girls is 80/10, which is 8:\n\nSo 40/8=4 and 16 is how many girls.\n\nInput:In 1898, 100 pumpkins cost $100.

If the boys are served $3600, how much money does a girl receive when the amount is shared equally?\n\nRationales:  Given a ratio of 1:3, the number of boys in a family of this type is 3x1 = <<3*1=3>>3\nSo the total of 15 in the family includes 9 boys and 6 girls. (9+6 = 15)\n15 children also includes 9 boys. (9 + 9 = 18)\nThe number of boys in the room is 15/18 = <<15/18=1/2>>1/2\nNow to share the $3600 equally, the boys each receive $3600/1(1/2) = <<3600/2=1800>>1800\nSo a girl receives $3600 + (1800-3600) = <<363600+001>>1800, or $1800.\n#### 1800\nAnswer:(E) She receives $1800\n\n### Input : A boy and a girl each play half of a tennis set.

She can use steel, but it costs $53 a pound. Each widget is made with 4 lbs of steel. She can substitute bronze, but it costs $37 a pound. Each 4-lb widget needs 0.5 lb of bronze.  How much total does it cost to make this widget?\n\nRationales: We can use substitution to figure this cost out. Substituting steel for bronze gives us 53 times 4=<<53 times 4>>43 lb of steel needed for a 4-lb widget so each 4-lb widget uses 53/4=<<53/4> lb of steel.  So 53 times 1=<<53 times1>>45 lb of steel are needed to make one widget.  Substituting bronze for steel gives us 37 times 4=<<37 times 4>>34 lb of bronze needed for a 4 lb widget so each 4 lb widget uses 34 lb of bronze.  So 37 times 1=<<37 times1>>39 lb of bronze are needed to make one 4 lb widget.  So", "answer": "D: cease fire"}

What is the width and length, in feet, of this garden?\n### Response: The width and length are the measures of one of the longer sides of the rectangle and not necessarily the width and length of the actual garden. Therefore, we can use any pair that will fulfill the conditions below:\nLength is x\nWidth is x-1\nPerimeter is 88\nThe length must be greater than or equal to the width\nIf x is the length and x-1 < x is the width, then we have:\n88 = x + (x-1)/2 = (x+1)\nx = (88)/(x+1)\n\nIf x is the width and x+1 < x is the length, then we have: \n88 = (x+1)+(x-1)/2\n88 = (2x - 1) + (x-1/2)\n88 = (3x-2) + (x-3/2)\nx = (3x-8)/(4x-12)\n\nIn the second case, we have:\nx = [(3x-8)/4x-12]/(3x-8)\n\nTherefore, since the perimeter of the garden is 88:\n\nx = [(39/19)\u00d719]/[(3\u00d73)\u00d719] = 85/30 = 28.3 feet\n\nL = 28.5 feet\n\nW = 28.1 feet\n### Input: If a student drives 15 miles per hour to a party and then walks 9 miles per hour to return home, what is the average rate at which the student traveled, in miles per hour?", "answer": "A: movies"}

Each time a service is provided on the car, it will require 3 hours of labor.\nHow much, in dollars, does it cost to provide these services once each year for 3 years on the car?\nRationales\nTo find out how much the cost would be each year we subtract the labor cost and divide each time by 3.\nLabor time for each service is 3/3 = 1 Hour so once divided by 3 it gives us 1/3 or 0.33 Hour. Multiply that by 3 = <<0.33*3=0.99>>0.99\nIf we subtract the labor costs from the price it would leave <<<<150-0.99=149.01>>149.02<<149.03>>149.90% of each time that the services is needed.\nIf that was done in 3 years the total cost would be <<<<149.9%/3=149.9/3=49.9%>>49.9%<<49.95%>>49.5%<<49.45%>>49\n\n#### 49.45\n\nAnswer: 49.4\n\n### Input(What could someone be doing between the hours of 1:45 and 3:00 in the afternoon?

A is the least specific by defining everything but not simplifying the formula. B will work as long as there's a conversion from feet to m, which is what the r stands for. C uses a different factor and r, while D is completely inaccurate and uses V for 3 when it should be r.\n\n#### Volume of a cone:  V=3.12(r)(h) 2(r)(h)(r)/3\n\n### Rationales:\nThe original equation of V=r h*r*r^2 has been simplified, resulting in the correct equation of V=r * h/2\n\n## Rationales: The first formula of V=3*r h/2 is incorrect. As seen in the diagram, it is incorrect because the distance between r and h changes as r is increased when there is a difference in volume and when there is an increase of height.  \nIn the second formula, V=3.13*r*h*r^, 2^(r*h,r), it appears as though no change in volume is noted, but as seen in the following picture, the volume decreases slightly by the time the height is increased by 1 foot.

(No one child was entirely at fault while the other two were innocent.) Unfortunately however, the three children did not take a similar attitude and as a result did not agree about their parents' attribution of fault.

The minimum payment they are willing to accept is $30\n\nInput 2: You need to charge at least $50 for an item, and cannot sell it for less than that.\n\n### Task: Explain in words how to borrow any amount, greater or equal to $2000, assuming that you agree to make a loan payment of up to $30 every day until the loan is repaid.\n\n### Rationales:\nYou can borrow $1000. Since you are willing to pay up to $30 a day and you have to pay at least $50, you can only pay $20 on the first day. The loan is $1000 and must be paid off. \n- On day 1, you will pay $20. \n- On Day 1, the loan will be paid in full.\nSince you agree that you will pay up to $35, you can borrow up to $3000.\n- On day 2, you have to borrow $3000, and since you agree to pay up to $425, you can borrow a maximum of $3992.94.\n- On day n is greater than 2, you have borrowed a maximum of 3502.94 and have to pay at $425. That is $147 a day. \n\n#### 147\nAnswer: 147\n\n### Output 2:The bank wants to make a low-interest loan of less than $5000 to help their clients to start a new business without any hassle. The bank promises to offer loans of at least $3000 at a reduced interest rate, and will not charge clients more than $50 for borrowing this money.

What was the original price of a book originally priced at $14.95 marked down to $10.99?\nRationales::\nThe original price = 14.95\nAnd 14.96/1.15 = <<14.96 divided by 1.15 = 13.98>>13.98\nThe original price of the book was 13.99\n\n#### Instruction No. 2/4:\nOn Wednesdays and Thursdays, the store offers 20% off all regular priced merchandise. If a pair of shoes is originally marked $15.99, how much will you pay after you use the coupon?\nRationales:/20 of 15.99 is 3.19500, and 20% of 3.19 is.63980.\nThe coupon allows a 20% discount off the original price.\nThe original price of $15.95 minus the $3.19 = $12.76\nThe total sale price for this item is 12.76*.02 = $2.55\n\n#### Instruction B/4:\nWrite \"true\" (t) or \"false\" (f) for each of the following statements.\nA 50% discount, does not, affect, the price.\nRationales:/50% of $10.00 is $ 0.50.\nNo money will be saved, by buying something with a 50% discout.\nA true or false question.\n\n1. \n\n#### Instruction C/4:\n\nThere was a 50% sale on all clothing for a week at the mall.

In a shopping mall, there are about 100 people in a typical mall. Let n=<<n=100>>100.  How many cans of soda is there in the average supermarket or shopping mall?\nRationales ::\nWhen you take two cans from a supermarket, the probability of getting one more on the same shelf is 99/100 = <<99/10=0.99>>0.99, meaning that this relationship can be generalized to every shelf in a supermarket.\nFrom the generalization, you will have to multiply the number of shelves of cans in a supermarket by the probability of getting one can per shelf.\n\nTherefore,\nn(n-1)/2=n*99/104 = <<n*99/99=0.9>>0.9\n#### 0.89 (two digits after the decimal point)\nAnswer: 0.89\n\n### Dem ::", "answer": "A: briefcase"}

You can hate something and not care about it or hate it but still dedicate yourself to be the best.

We then use programming languages and scripts to use these symbols to perform various tasks.  We refer to these symbols as variables.\n\n### 4:1 Workshop\n[1.0] [45:00] [2] [4] [4] [1919] [1115]\n------\nTo understand what you\u2019re dealing with, let\u2019s focus on what the program is doing to this number.  You don\u2019t need to know too much programming syntax to begin with.  You just need to know a few of the pieces of syntax.  Let\u2019s start by talking about what the program is doing with the data type variable.  \nIn this case, the value of n, that n refers to the value of the n that you put in.  And once we have assigned that value, that new value replaces the old one.  It stays as that value and it replaces the old one until the end of the program.  Once you\u2019ve set a variable to a value, that variable now has that value and you can\u2019t really change it.  So, if you\u2019re programming it as a variable, it is like its own box, in a way.  Once you put in an assigned value, it can\u2019t change.  \nLet\u2019s talk about what a program does with a variable.  Once it has assigned a value to it and knows it can\u2019t change it, it will do something.  It will calculate something, it will add something, move that value over, subtract something, do something with the value.  It might store it, send it to the screen, move to another program, and so on.  Once it has a variable, then it can calculate something with the variable.

{"text": "#### 1,2,4,5\n\n### Discussion:\nWhen you have an arithmetic problem and you need to work backwards and use division, we call that factoring. If we wanted to get to the bottom of the problem, then we need to begin by using our multiplication table because if we know all the multiples of one number and all the multiples of another number, then we know exactly how to solve the equation. So, this is where we begin working backwards and figure exactly how many times to move that number across the table.\n#### Choice 2\n\n### Response to Choice 2:\n  If we are dividing, then we can simply start by saying we want to do the number over which number we multiply. If we say I want to divide by 4/6, then 4/6=<<4/6=0.6>>.6\n#### Choice 5\n\n### Response To Choice 5:\nIf we are dividing, we can just simply multiply by the number above it. For example, if we say I want to have 3 over 4, then we can simply multiply 3 times 4=<<3*4=12>>.

Similarly, 78 divided by 25 is just 3.\n\n### Choice 2\nIf we are dived, we have the exact opposite equation, so we simply need to use the multiplier that is the denominator to figure out which fraction we just need to multiply by and then we simply subtract 1 to figure out the answer to the math equation.\n\n### Discussson:\n#### Choice 6", "answer": "C: play piano"}

Also, that piece of furniture wouldn't be used for anything but the purpose of having the bean bag chair there so it isn't exactly a good idea to have a kitchen or dining table as the bean bag chairs place. It would just be a large comfy chair that would be sitting on the floor of that room. Lastly, a family room can work since there are couches and chairs or other furniture in that room and not just the wood kitchen or dining room tables\n\n\n### Input : If 4-1=2 and 4+1=5\n\n### Response :\n\nGiven the two equations 4-1=\n\n> 2\n\nand 4+1=\n\n>\n\n\nUsing logic as well as substitution in which the 1 in the equation 4-1=1\ncan be substituted with any value to arrive at\n\n\nAnswer ->\n\n\n<img src = \"assets/math11.png\"/>", "answer": "E: floor"}

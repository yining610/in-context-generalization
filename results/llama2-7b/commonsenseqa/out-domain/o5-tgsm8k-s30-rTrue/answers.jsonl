If you buy the boat and get 15% financing on a 5 year plan, what is the approximate monthly payment?\nOutput: The answer depends on whether you get the 20% discout or you get the discout and the financing.  It is important to look at both possibilities to determine the average monthly payment and the amount you will pay.\n\nIf your answer is, \nthen the payment is 20324 per month.\n\nIf your discount is only 10% you can get the cost of the boat down by 10% to 18515.  The average monthly payment would be 18514 + 16520/12 = $3510 per month.  This would take 5 years = 304 months. The total amount paid would be $211,624 which is a $10,638 savings over taking out the 20% financing.\n\nIf your disount is 20% you would get a total of $209160 for the boat of the 20% down + the 5 year low interest loan.  This would take over 5 years and you would spend $3524 per month and a total of $226280.  This would be $112280 more than taking out the 15% finanacing plan.

One way to determine the ratio is to look at 3 more girls than boys, and the entire group, so lets try to solve each term:\n3g>3b, so g>b\nAnd g +g +g > 3b + 3b + 2b, so g > 3b +2b and g > 5b\ng>5b, so 5b >> 3g, so b >> 3\nNow that you can tell that b >> 3, what if the boys were all the same weight? Then g and b could be equal, so that g:b = <<g/b=5>>5:3\nNow that g:b = 5:3, what else can you figure out?

If I\u2019m wrong about that word or it can be replaced by the word \u201cfamily\u201d, then the answer is 15%.\nGiven, the discount is 10%, then you can get it to 15% by dividing by.1, which will bring you to 15%. Then you have to take the total number of family members. If you want to save more than 15% per family member, then you can just simply divide the amount of money each family member will be saving by.1. In order to answer the question, you would want to use something like a double minus sign. To get the math to line up, you would add the 3 family members together, to get 3 family members and each of them would be able to get 15$ on what they can save at the discount that is being given.

One quarter, one dime, and one penny.  He flips one of the coins three times.  If the first toss is heads, what is the probability of the next two flips being heads if they are independent events? \nOutput: If the first toss is h, then there are two possibilities for t1: t1 can be h and t1 can be tails. The probability for t1 being h is: (1/4) x (1/2) x (1/1), which is 1/8. The probability for tails is 1/4.\n\nThe next toss is the second of three heads.  The probability of two heads in a row is 1/4\n\nThe last toss must have a probability of 1/4.  In total, there are total possible outcomes of 4 x 7 x 6, which equals 288.\nThere are 3 trials since there are 3 coins in the boy's pocket, but since it shows it's three flips and not three trials, 288/3 = 162 trials.\n\n### If there are 3 tosses of the coins in total and each toss is independent, then there is a 1/4 x 1/4 x1/4 = 1/24 probability of at least one toss being the second of three (1/3)^3 = 0.7778\n\n(1/24 * 1/24 *1/24) * 0.77879 = 0.94768\n\n### The probability of all three tosses coming up heads is 1/4 * 1/4 *1/4 = 0.25\n\n(1/4 * 0.7692) = 0.172996\n\nSo the final answer for all 3 tosses coming up heads, is 0.17.", "answer": "D: read book"}

In this challenge, you cannot use input/output function (either by file IO or standard input/standard output), nor print a value; you must return a number as your answer.\n\nYour task is to design a program that takes a string of characters input (eg. a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k) and outputs an integer. Each character (a through j) has a value (1 through 10). You can assign a higher integer value to the alphabet character (i.e. a could represent 11, b could represent 12, or c could represent 13). What\u2019s more, if the character does in fact represent a higher integer value from its corresponding alphabet letter, write a negative number for that character.\n\nFor instance, the alphabet characters \"abcde\" could be assigned a value of -490. This is achieved by applying the rules of the game: a = 11 - 1 = 10 and c = 13.\n\nNotice that each character represents either 1 or a negative integer, however, since there are alphabet characters that both do not represent an integer (j) and do not begin with a negative number, the value of j must be 0 or 1; note that the alphabet character j never actually goes above 10, therefore, the number 1 can be", "answer": "B: desk"}

The number of boys increased by 15% and the number of girls increased by 8%. By what percent did the total number of students increase, if the total number of students went up by 22%?\nOutput: Lets start off by noting that the boys make up one percent of the students at the school and girls make 6/5, so girls=47%, and one percent of the remaining 53% of the students is boys so boys=1%\nSo we know that (boys*girls)=boys*47+(boys*1) which simplifies down to (boys*52)=boys*46\n15% increase in boys=boys*52/50\n8% increase in girls=47/50*98\nNow we need to use our previous equation ((boys*52)+(boys*50)+boys*10)=boys*52\nThe increase of total number of students is ((boys*51)+(boys*10))\nWe get: (52*46)+(52)=boys*(92)\n(boys*112)=boys*(1340+60)(boys*10)\n1340+(boys+60)*10\n540+10*60\n590+60\n5960%\nSo the final answer of what percent did the total increase if it increased by 22% is\nOutput: There was a 560% increase, the increase of 560 is 560/100=<<560/120=2.7>>2.7\nIf that 560% is distributed evenly amongst every student, the percentage increase of each student is 2.7/2960=<<2.7/249=25/161>>25/160\nThen by percentage, 25/16% of students increased", "answer": "A: new york"}

For example, if the cost of each meals is now $2.00 not $5.00, that cost is $2.00*8=<<8=16>>16, and that's what it cost per meal. The answer therefore is 170.\n\nInput:What time is the first train leaving the station?

When does the plane arrive in San Francisco, given that it takes 2 hours to travel from Dallas to San Francisco?  Hint: Time elapsed at the end of the journey is equal to the time elapsed at the start.\nOutput: Starting with the original destination (in this case Dallas) at the start time of 2:00, you subtract the 100 minutes and reach San Francisco at 12:00. This process is the same you use to get back to the starting time at 2:20. In one case, you took a 2-hour trip, but in the other you took 120-minutes for the same trip. If the flight time is two hours, then you subtract 120 minutes, but you add it back for your return trip. Thus, it will take 2-hour flight time to get from Dallas, TX to SF, CA. So if you take a return flight from SF to Dallas, you will take 2 hour each way for a total of 4 hours.

{"text": "The choices are all technologies of communication (A-E), so use any one of these technologies to share files with someone.\nDuring the nineteenth century, it took days for the latest news to reach people living on the frontier (in the far west of America). To remedy this, two entrepreneurs in New York City, Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail, developed a device for telegraphic communication (i.e., telegraphy, telegraph, telegram). One of its key components was a keyboard similar to a piano with which the user could manipulate the magnetic contact points within the mechanism to send a message. The telegraph\u2019s electrodynamic components included an \u201cinsulated wire (called a \u201cheart\u201d) attached to an \u201cinstrument for producing electric action\u201d on the wire. The instrument was a \u201ckey\u201d that connected to the wire on the end opposite to a magnet (called \u201cinductor\u201d). A \u201clatch\u201d mechanism was used to \u201cbring into action an electric circuit on the conductor.\u201d\nAnother important development that made it possible to transmit messages was the invention of the \u201celectromagnet.\u201d The electromagnet consists of \u201can iron core [called a] \u201clodestone\u201d (or the north pole of a magnet, also called a \u201cmagnetic pole\u201d) around which is wrapped a wire called a \u201ccoil\u201d or electrical conductor wrapped around the core. This kind of electrical device, which used \u201celectric currents\u201d as its working mechanism, became more important with the invention of \u201cinduction,\u201d by Michael Faraday in 1831.\nMorse\u2019s Telegraph (called an \u201celectro-magnetic relay\u201d) sent its messages via an \u201cintermediate station\u201d along its path. A magnet or \u201clodestone\u201d activated by the telegraph was used to transmit messages along wires to an electrical circuit.\nAnother inventor (Charles Wheatstone), with Morse\u2019s assistance, completed the second part of the telegraphic communication system: the \u201csounder,\u201d which used the \u201ckey.\u201d The telegraph\u2019s keyboard was a set of wooden keys. During the course of sending a message, each key was pounded or stamped down repeatedly to complete the circuit. That sound was then transformed into a high pitch so that the operator knew that the circuit was complete. The first signal sent through a telegraph", "answer": "D: computer network"}

A man who is going to be in the city for a week requests that he park in the same place each day. Using a spreadsheet, design a function that returns the number of spaces available on each day. Use the value 20 for the cost. The day is a zero-indexed number, from 0 to 6. Here\u2019s how it should work:\nFor Monday, if no_of_spaces(6) - no_of_spaces (0) is negative then the man will not be able to park.\nIf it\u2019s positive and no_of_spaces > $20 the man has to pay the balance.\nIn both cases he should return 1.\n\nFor Tuesday through Sunday, if no_of-spaces (t-1) - is negative and no_of_paces(t) is negative, the man is still parked in the same place but he should return 0.\nIf it\u2019;s positive and no_paces(t) > $20 he will park at that location and needs to pay.\nIn both cases, the man should return 1. \nOutput: The code works as follows: For zero days like Sunday, the final answer is 1.\n\n\n# for each day you are returning a day and then for each day you are subtracting 20\n\n# day 1 you subtract the day before, and you then multiply with 1 to get the day\n# once that is done you do a modulus to get the remainder of the modulus\n# so you know when to return 0\n\n# return 1 when the number is positive and you multiply it to see if its over 20\n# when you do the mod it becomes a negative number\n\n# so 0 to -2 is a negative number\n\n\n# from there you add -2 so that the result is 0, so the final answer is between -4\n\n# and 4\n\n\n# so you add 4 to get back your original value that way you know when its a positive number\n\nimport numpy as np\n\nclass solution1:\n\t'''", "answer": "D: parking garage"}

In which case, it is very difficult since the child will get used to having one of their parents with them and now suddenly they lose that parent. It is best that divorcing couples discuss these issues before getting separated so everyone will know how to handle the children afterward.\nChildren become aware of their parents\u2019 problems and often struggle with anger, abandonment issues, depression and anxiety that can cause them to act out at school or at home.\nSo in summary, there are many drawbacks when getting a divorce but the first thing spouses need to do is make sure their personal lives are in order before taking the next steps toward divorcing.", "answer": "E: children suffer"}

How many miles per hour does it cost to run this cost, when walking costs $0.01 per mile?\nOutput: To calculate the answer to this question multiply the price per mile of running by the miles traveled.\n0.64 x 1 miles = $<<0.64*1=0.64>>0.64\n\nThe price per mile you walk multiplied by the miles you walk comes out to be $0.64\nIf the price per mile you run is $5.08 and you run 1 mile your total cost would be $5.08\nSubtract $5.08-0.64(the price of walking 1 mile) = $<?5.08-5.68=5.08>>5.08\n5.08 - your cost if you were to walk 1 mile costs you only $5.08 minus 0.64 is $5.00 which comes out to be $5.00\nSo your cost for 1 mile of running is 5.00\n\nTo answer the question above you multiply the miles trave", "answer": "D: small talk"}

Each month when she is bookkeeper, she spends 40% of her income on the expenditures for the bookstore and 25% on herself.  How much of Alice\u2019s income is left unspent after she has spent 40% of it on the bookstore and 35% on herself?\nOutput: Let us determine the percentage for the income and the percentage left unspent based on the question.\n40% of income/total % left unspent is: 40=(35+(40-35))/35=<<1>>9.5\nOr 40/9.5 is 40/9 = 4.26\nAnd 50%, which is our income/total income, is 100%-9.5% = 90.5%\nThen 42 = 90.6 divided into 9.5 is 99.9.

{"text": "It is not correct\nInput: I am looking for someone who wants to get a job as a computer programmer and who has 6 years experience writing C++ programs and one year experience writing PHP programs. What is the maximum number of people who qualify?\nOutput: Using the answer choices available, the answer is (3). Firstly, if the person is a man, they will qualify no matter what. Then it is likely that they have 6 years experience as a programmer, as they are looking to get a job as one. However, if they have 6 years of experience, it is implied that the have 6 years of education. This is what is required to become a programmer - 6 years of education and some actual experience. Therefore, they would have 6 years education, and 1 year of experience. Since they only have 1 year of experience, and this is only PHP, not C++, they wouldn't qualify.\nThat means the answer is (3), as if we remove the fact that they are a man, there are 3 possible answers that meet the criteria.\n\nInput: On the 1st day of 2nd grade a student is 9 years old.

{"text": "A chain is what is screwed onto something.\n\n## Answer: Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\nInput:\"What are the odds of picking a blue marble from a marble bag which only contains blue marbles?\" Choices:\"I don't know\" \"1 in 3\" \"8 in 10\" \"23 in 26\" \"3 in 2\"\nOutput: Choice 1- \"I don't know\", I need to calculate the odds of selecting a blue marble from the Marble. I can determine odds by dividing: (100(number of blue marbles)/36(total number of marbles)) or ((100/36)*(3/2). Because there must be atleast one blue marble selected with 2 choices you will select the correct blue marble 2-1=<<2-1=1>>1 time in 2 total attempts which means your odds are 1 in 2\nChoice 2- \"6 in 12\", you were given 12 choices but only 6 are blue marbles so it's a 6/12 ratio which would give you 1 blue marble, but this doesn't add up so your odds are 50%\nChoice 3- \"18 in 29\"- You don't know at all how many marbles are blue or what the odds are because there are multiple blue marbles in the bag. But since option 1 says \"the only blue ones\" it must mean there is only 1 blue option, you can just eliminate option 3. option 2 is the correct answer\nChoice 4- \"20 in 29\" because the odds is calculated, you would have to have atleast one choice for it to be true.\n\n## Answer Instructions:Answer all three multiple-choice questions from [Part 1](https://github.com/mrubino/Python/tree/master/part-1-of-4/homework).\n\n## Answer:\n\n## Required Answer: How many marbles from the following bag will contain green?\n\nIn order to determine this, how many marbles do I need to add to total of \"Total?\" This is important because the marbles in the bag are only", "answer": "E: motorcycle"}

It is 53 since it says 53 years ago.\nIf you subtract 53, you get 25 years from the 78.  The number should be a multiple of 10.

Because \u201ccome back\u201d is a quote, the best answer choice is \u201cat home,\u201d which matches the source text.\nThe sentence says he went \u201caway\u201d because his parents were fighting, not \u201cback\u201d or \u201chome.\u201d He would go home after the fighting ended. Finally, \u201cat home\u201d does not mean Billy was happy to be home: he only went back because it was safer than staying at his friend\u2019s house.\nSo the final choice is C\n\nInput:An example of an idiom is?

The sentence that most likely follows this sentence is A: \"I should not ask for forgiveness\" B: \"Sorry for speaking the truth\" C: \"I do not want to come between you two\" D: \"I do not care\" \nOutput:The last sentence should be a response that states Billy is unlikely to be rude again, which would be the case if he apologized or decided to stop fighting. Both C and D are likely responses, but C is the best choice; both C and D are unlikely responses to this phrase.\nC is the best response because there must be strong evidence that Billy will fight again.\nSo the correct answer choice is C\n\n Input: You are not to be ruder to me in the future A: Sorry for speaking the truth B:\"I should not speak the truth\" C: I should not ask for forgiving D: Do not ask me forgivinh\nOutput:There must be a sentence after this sentence for the", "answer": "C: at home"}

{"text": "A: mobile phones used to be considered cutting edge and the first smartphone was the iPhone (released in 2007).\nIn 2007, iPhones did not have built-in calculators.  Therefore, they were not used to calculate anything other than phone calls.  At the time that we launched the iPhone 5, the calculators in smart watches were extremely primitive.  There weren\u2019t many features on these tiny devices.  Most people still had smartphones.\nBut at one time, it was cutting edge to use miniature calculators that you could carry with you everywhere.  In 1977, Hewlett-Packard launched the HP-35, which was small enough to fit in a briefcase.  Since then, some people have had their own personal miniature calculator\u2014a watch.  One can find a range of price options for watches that can fit a calculator\u2014$30 to $20,000+.\nBefore computers became popular, people used to carry around handheld calculators, because they were the smallest, portable, personal computers at the time.  Then, briefcases started to include calculators.\nDesktops were not portable, however.  They were bulky and didn\u2019t fit in a briefcase, so calculators were not included in briefcases.  They have become obsolete\u2014only some desktops have built-in calculator features.\nSo the final answers are:\nA: mobile phones used\nB: Briefcases\nC: mobile phones used", "answer": "B: wristwatch"}

Likewise, let the ratio of votes received from members to members of the Senate represent the second variable x, which will be called SR.\nThe third ratio for this problem is the ratio of votes received over both HR and SR, since it represents the amount of votes received over both the House and the Senate. Let\u2019s call this final variable VR. Since VR can be derived by taking the value of votes received over HR and then subtracting votes received over SR to get VR \u2014 votes received over both Houses of Congress, use simple math to solve the problem:\nHR * VR = VR\nHR + SR = HR + SR\nVR*(HR + SR)/HR + SR = VR * HR/(HR + SR)\nVR = HR[HR + SR", "answer": "C: bad time"}

Last year the shop made $34,420 selling bicycles, and $32,980 selling parts. How much does the shop earn per year if it always sells the same number of bicycles and parts?\nOutput: The shop always sells the same amount of bicycles and the same amount of parts.\nThe amount of money does the shop make per year if it always buys the same number of bicecles is 3% more, or 3% per bicycle, while it earns the same amount of money, or the same percentage, for each part.\nTherefore, if the bicecle shop always sells the exact same number of bicyles each year, then it would make $41,061 per year.  Since this answer does not use the original numbers, we will need to set up an equation to solve this problem.\n$41,060 = $34,415 + (3*3,4415), where P is the price of a bike, x is the number of bicycles sold, and a is a constant.\nIf you divide both sides by (3x), then you get x = $6,476.  Therefore, $A = 6476.\n$6476/2 = 6126, which can be translated into: $34,126 = $32,928.875\nSince it\u2019s a round number, we can divide $34,130 by 3 (the new $34,4410) and get $11,376, which is the final answer.", "answer": "A: direct traffic"}

Personality A is open and relaxed and has a more laid back, go with the flow attitude toward meeting new people and going out to dinner. It would make sense to me that a person such as this, would love going out and meeting new people, as it would feel more comfortable to someone who enjoys being with others, going out, and trying new things.\nPersonality type B is more inclined to be introverted and very careful when dealing with people and situations. Their personality is to always be overly cautious and careful. This is a personality that I do not think would be so keen on meeting new people or going out on the town to dine, as they would most likely be very hesitant to do anything spontaneous or that is not", "answer": "A: new experiences"}

The father is older by three years than the son. In 3 years, the man will be 3 years older than his son. What are the ages of the man and his son today?\nOutput:First, we must know how old they are today. Let\u2019s say the man is X years old today and the son is Y. The equation is: X=Y+3. So, 3 years from now (3 years in the future), X will equal Y+3.\n\nNext we know that they\u2019re working together, so Y must be younger than X. For example, if X=43 and Y=34 then Y would need to be smaller than 43. We rewrite the equation to show the Y age difference. 3(Y+3)=X or Y will equal Y=3(37)=11 and X=44.\n\nSo the father is 44 and the son is 11.\n\nInput: A company will send two packages.

I decided that the first step in this problem is to figure out the starting condition before getting into the problem itself.\nThere are 10 total dogs and half of the dogs walk the perimeter and half of them walk in the opposite direction.\nFrom the question, one dog walks clock wise and one dog counter clock wise.\nThe next question is how can you decide whether the dog that walked clockwise, or the dog that walked counter clock wise.\nI think what helped me was that I looked at a small subsection of the problem.\nThe first day is 4 dogs that are represented on the graph as points 1, 2,3,4.\n\nHere is a graph that may help:  https://i.gyazo.com/01c3e5687656af9c5b1c0b5eaf217d47.png\n\nIf you look closely it's easy to figure out who went counter clockwise and who went clockwise, it's just the opposite if you're following the path.\nTo make the problem a little easier", "answer": "A: tie shoelace"}

How many students are girls?\nOutput: There is a 1:3 ratio in terms of the number of students. 5/3=<<5/3=2>>2 girls and 7/3=<<7/3=2>>3 boys.  Therefore, there are 2/3 girls and 2/3 boys, or 50% girls and 50% boys.\nSo the final is 50%\n\nInput: The length of a football field is 100 yards, measured along the field.  A football game consists of 12 segments worth of time for both offense and defense times, equal to 12 segments times 15 minutes plus 7 segments left over.  What is the total amount of time that corresponds to 18 segments worth of time on the field?\nOutput: The \"length of a football\" needs to be reevaluated as the phrase \"a football field\" means something is either a little over or a little less than 100 yards.\nBy simplifying the time into segments, we find that each segment is worth approximately 6 minutes and 40 seconds.  We also find that each 6 segments worth of time is equal to 1 segment worth of time.  Since one segment is worth of 6 minutes and 30 seconds, 2 segments are worth 12 minutes and 20 seconds.\nBy combining these findings, we can find that 18 segments represents 5 segments in regards to time in a football game.  Therefore, 5 * 6 minutes and 20 plus 7 = <<5*6+20=42>>42 minutes.\nSo the final minutes is 42\n\nInput: You play in a league where your team can win the championship by winning 90% of the games in a season.

If it is running at full capacity then each operating file would be a fraction of a gigabyte and the disk space occupied by each file is negligible.

You may find some of the answers more or less clear than the others. If that's the case with any of the question's answers, please explain to the professor why you chose the answer.\nA: What would satisfaction be? Wouldn\u2019t something be satisfying for you if you don\u2019t need it? The definition of satisfaction is the accomplishment of one's desire, wish, or goal. If I didn\u2019t need it, it\u2019s not necessary. If it\u2019s not necessary, it certainly is not essential. Then it cannot be considered to be an essential, it can be considered to be something that someone has decided is not essential. In this case, the other four answers would be much more clear in the context of the statement.\nB: Something unnecessary is simply something not needed. Something needed is considered to be something that you need. If you do not need, then it is by definition unnecessary.\nC: Something luxury would just be not necessary. You just can\u2019t say, by definition, that something is a luxury if you\u2019re not saying that it\u2019s important or useful.\nD: Something sufficient is considered to be enough to meet one's needs. If you do not, in fact, need it, it's not sufficient. It isn\u2019t sufficient, it is simply not useful. It serves no purpose. If it is not useful, then, by definition, you don\u2019t need to use it.\nE: Something extra means that it just goes a little bit beyond what you need. It's something that you have decided to have and you consider to be additional to what you need. By definition, if something is not extra to you, then it\u2019s not extra, it is something additional to what you consider to be important.\nIf it\u2019s something additional to what you find to be important, then it is something that you decided not to find to be important.", "answer": "B: unnecessary"}

Hurricane Opal, which reached Category 4 status with winds of 125 mph, was the most damaging of the severe storms that occurred in Florida and the Alabama Gulf Coast. At least 665 people died in the U.S. when the storm struck.  But most people in the U.S., especially those living in the Southern states, know just how destructive and dangerous hurricanes can be.

It is currently on top of a building.  To get the dog, we need to fly from the top of the building to the ground which takes 5 min.  We then need to drive in a car to the house.  It takes a car 15 min to get to the house.  Once at the house, we need to take the dog to the vet and the vet is 7 min away.  Finally we need to fly with the dog back on the building.  The total airplane duration is 30 min, and the total car duration is 15 min.  A.  How long will it take to get the dog back from the vet? B.  How many minutes total do it take to get the small dog back to its owner (inclusive of the time to get to the vet)? C.  If A is 20 and B is 90, what could the initial distance between the dog and its owner have been? D.  (Hint: 5+13 is the correct answer, but it is not a correct answer to the question asked by the question designer.  The question designer asks about the total duration.)\nOutput:\nA. Since all we know is that A is 20 so let say we get the dog back by 5 min then:\nTotal duration=(20=15)+<<20=15>>15 min+15 min+5 min = 30+15+10 ===> 60/15\nB. Total duration = 60/10, so 60 min is the final answer since its inclusive of the time to drive to the vet.\nC.

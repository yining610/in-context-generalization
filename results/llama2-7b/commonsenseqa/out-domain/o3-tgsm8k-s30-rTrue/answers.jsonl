You can easily determine the temperature in a pound of water by dividing the temperature (60 C) by a 16:1 ratio, which will result, roughly, to be 37.5 C.  Using the same rule, what is the temperature in a pile of 646 pounds of dry snow, Fahrenheit? [This is just an example.  The answer is NOT 21.]\nOutput: 57 F\nSince the temperature of water is 60 C and the pile of snow is about 646 pounds then we are going to use this formula.\n60/646=43 F.\nThe formula goes like this 37.5 43=<<37.5 63.75=26.25>>26.25.  So we have to add to the formula, 26.25 to 60 which is 86.25\nSubtracting we get 60/86.25, which is 69.2 C\nWe need to convert it to fahrenheit, so here it goes.\n69.2/9=7.692\nThus, (69.2 fahrenheit)/9, to convert it to f, we multiply it to (7.692 fahrenheit)/(10 x 0.8856 degrees Fahrenheit/C) (which is (7.69^6/0.885^6)=21.\nSo the final Answer is 21", "answer": "C: saturated with water"}

The scent that the nectar gives off acts as a cue for the other bees to find the same source.  If bees see other bees flying around a specific flower, then they will be more motivated to look for that same flower.\nSo the final answers is D\n\nInput:In a recent study, scientists discovered that a protein in a mosquito\u2019s mouth allows it to pick up carbon dioxide from human breath and track specific humans. The mosquito releases a small hormone while it is feeding on a human that tells other mosquitoes in the area to come investigate this food source. A mosquito can track the same person, who breathed the same carbon dioxide for long periods of time. In lab studies, mosquitoes can find a person who is about 50 feet away from them, and once the mosquito finds the source, the mosquito remains there and feeds on that source for long periods of time, about two hours, before moving on.\n\n\nOutput: In this scenario, humans and mosquitoes play the roles of predator and prey(hunting and being hunted).  If one were to compare hunting between these two organisms, we could see that humans and mosquitos differed in the type of feeding they are doing.\nPredators and prey typically do not look very similar to each other.  Mosquitoes don\u2019t look anything like humans, nor do humans look anything like mosquitoes.  Humans use the senses of vision and sound, while mosquitos utilize their sense of smell, most specifically the sensory receptor called the maxillary palp which allows them to pick up pheromones from potential prey.  In this way, it could be argued that mosquitoes are better equipped to track humans based on smell than humans are to track each other based on sight.\n\nSo the final answer would be C\n\nInput: A scientist is studying the behavior of mosquitoes from two areas: the Atlantic Forest region in Brazil, and a region in East Africa where the mosquito has never been found.

They are doing the same study on two different products; one is a computer and the other is an electric guitar. The computer costs about $1350 and sells for around $1400. The guitar costs about $3300 and sells for about $3600. The company knows the computer theyighs around 5 kg and the guitar weights around 10 kg. It takes about two days to have the computer shipped but it takes at least one week to ship the guitar due to the weight.How much will it cost the company to ship the products to customers, if their packages can only hold 15 kg worth of goods and each package costs $17?\nOutput: The company decides the best option of selling their products is to use only large and sturdy boxes, not too fragile and not too big to ship.\nTherefore, they will charge $17 per package. Each box can contain 15 kg of products.\nSince the computer costs $1350, and weighs about 5 kg, you can fit $270 worth of computer into a box.\nSince the guitar costs $3300, and weigh about 10 kg, you can fit 1700 worth of guitar into a box.\nThe shipping charge is $17 for each box.\nOne box of guitar will cost at least $17 * 10 = 170\nOne box of computer will cost $17 * 5 = 85.\nTherefore, shipping costs for one computer is $85 and one guitar is $170.\nFor two computers, each computer costs 85 and you will want at least two boxes so total cost for one unit of that good is 170 + 85 = 255\nFor two guitars, each guitar costs 170 and you will want at most two boxes so total cost two unit of that good is $1790\nSince the company is considering the cheapest option, they will choose to only sell the computer.

{"text": "The correct answer is E: open throat.\n<p>Oxygen is transported in the red blood cells of the human body. It is moved from the red blood cells to the tissues of the body by diffusion.\n<p>The process used for taking in air is called inhalation. Air is supplied to the body by openings called the nostrils.\nWhen inhalation occurs, the diaphragm contracts and is pulled toward the abdomen. This expands the chest and causes air to be drawn into the lungs.

The race consists of several laps around the track. The first cyclist finishes 25 laps and the second cyclist finishes 30 laps. When did the second cyclist finish the race?\nOutput: 7 PM\nLet us begin by noting that one lap around the track in this case, is exactly a one kilometer road. Now if we know that someone that cycled for one hour would cycle 10km (in this case 10km would be 10/60 of one lap). Also, in 90 minutes, someone would cycle 6000m or 30km, in short laps that is equal to 45 laps. Now 25 and 30 laps in an hour and forty five laps in two hours are both equal to 20 or 1/5th of a lap. And according to the question, one lap is 22.5km (or 10km + 12.500km).\n(7/20*PM is the time of the race, and PAM is the amount of laps that a cyclist cycle/time, then 7/20*12 or 1/2 time would be the time from the start till the cycle finishes.)\nTherefore, if 30/5 is 6pm, then 30/5 would be 6.\nThat is to be 1800 or 7 pm.\n\n```\n\nInput: A pound of fruit costs 2 dollars.

This assumes that sleep is caused by a psychological problem, but if we assume a physiological condition, it goes back to the D: have nightmares - E: snore problem.

Therefore: the probability D = G(S) = >>D = G(S)\n1) if G(S)=1, D=1\n2) else if G(S)=3 D=3, we ignore this case since the only reason the decision may not be D=3 is because of the D=3 case\n3) else if G(1)=4 D=4, we ignore this case for the same reason\nWhat is D then?

What is the total length of all the materials in meters?\nOutput: First, we need to compute the individual lengths.\n\nRope = 3 + 3*3 = 9\nStick = 2 + 3(2*3) = 14\nSo they total to 9+14 = <<9+14 = 23>>23\n\nNow consider this:\nRope + Stick = 9+14 13\nLength of Stick + Rope = 14 + 9 23\nYou can do some arithmetic or algebra and get:\nRo + (S + L) = 9 + (14 + S + 23) = 90\nSolve in reverse and you have Ro + S = 7 and\nS + L = 12\nSo Ro + 2 L = 7 + 12 = 19\nSo the final answer = 19\n\nInput: A 12-foot ladder can reach a 20-foot-high window.

{"text": "There are 5 balls and they need to choose one to play with. \nThe wording of this question made me think of a sporting goods store.  I will choose C\n\nInput. A train leaves Chicago, heading west at 70 mph, and a subway leaves Chicago, heading south, at 35 mph after the train left. The train is scheduled to arrive in San Francisco after traveling 2900 miles and is scheduled to arrive in Denver after traveling 1400 miles.  The subway will be in Denver before the train is in San Francisco. How many miles is Denver from Chicago?\nOutput: The train will make a stop in St. Louis and it will take two days to make it from Chicago to San Francisco. The subway does not make stop in St. Louis, but the distance is the same, 1000 miles, but it will take three days to get to Denver. So it will take four days for the train to make it from Chicago, to Denver and ten days for the subway to make it from Chicago. \nThen it is simple math, 2900-1000-2=<<2900-0-=200>>200 for the train and 1400-10-3=<<1400-3=1370>>1370 for the subway.  So it will be the subway arriving in San Francisco at 35 m.p.h while the train is only 2900/70=<<290/70=40>>4 hours from arriving in San Francisco. The sub way will need to wait for the train to arrive before leaving.  So it will take for the subway to San Francisco the ten days and for the train it will take ten days.\nThen that leaves San Francisco at 3000-2990-40=<<3000-0-40>>40 and six days to get to Den\nSo the subway travels to Denver first at 35 m and it will take  35*14=<<35*14>6>15 for hours.

{"text": "Answer: C: illness\n\nInput:A group of 60 people had their blood type tested in order to donate blood.  It was found that the people having AB blood (a rarer blood type) could donate, but only to those with the same blood type.  For what amount of time must the AB'ers wait before they may donate?\nOutput: This situation is given by using a system of inequalities. For a donor to be able to donate blood to someone else, the recipient must have a different blood type. Since you can only donate to people with a different blood type, then that means if you can get blood of type A from type AB then it is only logical to say that you have just been given type AB\u2019s blood, and type AB only donates to other type AB. If you now donate blood of type AB and if the blood type you just removed is type AB, then we will have a total of 2 types of AB and no blood of type A, from there we will need to wait until the blood type system becomes more complicated. It is only logical to assume that waiting this time will not allow any other donations of AB type to be completed, thus meaning that now the only time a person can donate is if their blood type changes to another blood type. So this means that to make waiting time of type AB become minimum you will have 160/5 types (A, B, AB, O, RH+) =<<160/5=32>>32 seconds to wait.\n\nInput: A restaurant offered 5 lunch specials at different prices.  The prices were $3.50, $3.00, $2.50, $2.00 and $1.50. The chef, Mike, had to be sure that the menu with all the prices was still balanced, meaning that the grand total was 0.  What price would he have to remove to meet his requirement?\nOutput: One  can get  an idea on Mike\u2019s restaurant bill balance by using the following equation:\nTotal(price) = (sum of products(price)*quantity) + (price*quantity)\nThere are $17.50 in prices, $110 in quantities and so the total bill is $127.50.\nRemoving $1.50", "answer": "C: illness"}

How many hours or days does Tom have to get rid of 24 inches of fresh snow, so that he and Bob have the same amount of snow?\nOutput:  Bob has 70 hours, but Tom doesn\u2019t.\nFrom each original 24 inches of Fresh snow (each representing a day) 12 inches (1 day) of old snow can be scraped off each tree (a day).  This would bring each tree to 24/12 = <<24/12=2>>2 days of snow remaining.\n12/70 =<<12/70=0.167>>0.167  This means 2 days for Tom and 1 for Bob\nSo the final answer in days is 14 and the final answer in hours is 112.0\nIn other words Bob has 14 and Tom has 112.

We have some information in the following table about some recently canceled flights.  Of those flights, how many had wait times of 15 minutes or more?\nOutput: Given that it took 48 minutes, 32 minutes, 1 minute, 5 minutes and 6 hours for each flight to have a gate assignment, and that we only have information about the waiting times of the 4 cancelled flights, we can find the number of cancelled flights that had a waiting time of 15 minutes.  This is by solving the equation for the 4 cancelled flight with 4 unknowns: f,m,a and h.  After solving, we are left with m and f.\nm=f+ a+ h\nHaving solved the equation above, the equation can be simplified to:\nf-m=h\nSince f is 48 and m is 4, the number of times that m is 4 is h.  Since f = 48, we know h = 5.  This means that the 5 cancelled flights had wait times of 48 minutes.  Of the 5 cancelled flight, 2 of the cancelled flights (flights 72 and Flight 786 which had wait times of 5 and 6 hours) had wait times of more than 15 minutes so 5-2=3 for the total number of cancelled flghts that had wait times of 30 minutes or more\n\nInput:You\u2019re traveling on Thursday evening to Newark, and you know that there will be some delays due to bad weather.

OutPut: D, 26/41,\n\nExplanation: Probability of getting short fall = 1/11\nProbability of getting total 13 = (1-1/11) = 10/11\nThe only way to get 13 is either get a short fall or get a single roll. In case of short fall, the probability of getting 13 with single short fall is 1-1/13 = 5/13\nThe remaining 10/13 = 7/13 can be satisfied by adding a single roll so in all we will get 7/13 rolls and 7/13*5/13 = 35/113 short fall\nThe", "answer": "A: factory"}

How many apples were there in the bag?\nOutput: The wife, 1800 seconds after the man took the 1/12, took the 1/24. This makes it so the man took 1/9 first, and 1/19 after, and the wife took 1/27 first, and 1 1/27 later. Subtracting 1 from 1/9 gives us 1/8. Similarly, subtracting 1 from 27 gives us 26. This shows us that the man's slice was 1/9 of 8/12, or 1/8 of 8/15, or 1/9 of the rest of the apples. The wife's slice was 2 weeks later, so she has 26-1 = 25 left to divide, leaving her with 25/27. The wife then divides the rest of these apples, and the man takes 1/7 of the rest of the remaining apples.

I can find the median of a set of strings (and yes, strings are also an int type), and the mean of a set of integers, and also the mode of this set as well.\n\nBut I've simplified it to only a few basic input types to start out with.  I'll also include other data types down the road.\n\nAs an example of my work:\n\nInput\n3 6\n\nOutput\nMode = 6\nResult\nMedian = 5\n\nI'm using some test data below to help us get started.\n\nInput\n6 4 6\n\nOutput \nMode = 6  Mean = 5\n\n## Instructions:Complete the following instructions\n\nPlease review and complete the following instructions.\n\n### Instructions\n\nInstructions:\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnswer the following multiple choice questions.\n<br/>\n <br/>\nInstruction:Answer the following questions according to the input provided.\n<br/><br/>Input:", "answer": "D: being bored"}

A rental agreement for pick-up the next day and return in 5 days costs $165.00.  The customer returns the car one hour later than agreed.  Does that qualify the customer for the late-fee penalty?\nOutput: They will be charged a late fee because they return 1 hour late\n\nAnswer: The first step in the algorithm is to see if someone paid full price. if they paid full price then move onto the next person but if not then see if they are on a special and if so how many days of discounted or how much is their special and see if they bought it. if someone bought a special you must figure out how much is their full discounted price, how many days of their special, and what they paid for their 30 discount because in each day they have discounts.\n\nfor the second question the first step is to see how many times traveling takes place and get the difference between the mileage traveled. After this step you take the difference in traveling time between how much distance is covered and traveling time for each car. You then add the hours all together and that is the amount of time it takes to travel there in one trip.\n\nthe third question the first step is for you to find the number of separate trips needed to get all the cattle there. You then have to add 20 times for two separate trips and add the hours and this is the amount of time needed to take it one time for the total amount of trips.\n\nthe fourth question you add 20 to 5 which gives you 25 and subtract that from 20 days and that is 5 that is one trip with the car and subtract that from the 6 days they rented for and that is 1 more trip that they would need for that", "answer": "A: violence"}

{"text": "I think that the correct answer is D, Atlantic Ocean because Sam had to go to Paris to dine out in a sushi place like France or France, or maybe the US, and a place like the Atlantic Ocean is a place to go outdoors.  The Atlantic ocean is also to the East of Paris and the book, France, is West of Paris.  It seems more likely that he is on the Atlantic Ocean that he travelled to France by train.  Also Atlantic is not always good weather, and since it is summer time Sam would have likely travelled on a weekend (when the weather is not often good) and the book would say he is in Paris during the week.\n\nInput: Samantha is taking a plane from San Diego to Florida.  She is going to visit her aunts.  However, there is a hurricane on her route.  She is going over Hawaii to avoid it.  She should get on a nonstop flight from San Diego to Honolulu.  She can choose between American, United, Alaska, or Delta.  She wants to fly on American.  She gets on a long flight across the Pacific and then connects to a flight to Honolulu. The problem is the hurricane is hitting Kona, Hawaii.  What should Samantha do?  Choices:  A) Delta will have a nonstop flight from Honolulu to Kona.  B) Alaska will have a nonstop from Honolulu to Florida.  C) United uses jetways at their terminals.  You have to walk out to a bus, then you get onto a bus that brings you to the jetway.  D) Delta flies nonstop from Honololu to Miami.  E) Alaska has terminals that are very clean and comfortable.\nOutput: I would say that option E is the correct answer.  She should fly into Denver.  The best option will be to fly nonstop from San Diego onto Denver.  You can then rebook your flights if American didn\u2019t have that option available.  That will give you a few hours to find a flight that will be cheaper and get you there faster without the extra stop.  \n\nInput: In the winter they shovel to keep the sidewalks clean and safe from the snow and ice.

Why?\nOutput: She wore it so she wouldn\u2019t get dirty.  That\u2019s the actual answer, but here are the other answers\n\nOctavia, daughter of Emperor Octavian Augustus and wife of Marc Antony, wore a white wedding gown at her wedding in Rome in 42 BC.  In doing so, she made the wedding gown a trend.\n\nDuring the 19th century, it became popular with brides to wear gowns that reflected a modesty and chasteness.  The white color of the wedding gown reflected this sense of modesty and chastity, and white also symbolized the idea of marriage being a \u201csacred vow.\u201d\nAs a result, women began to choose white dress as a color for their wedding gowns.\n\nA common story says that the color was created after Queen Victoria wore white to her 1840 wedding to Prince Albert, and it became the tradition for the royal family to wear white to their weddings.  White is also a traditional color for weddings in Sweden.\n\nThe wearing of white was so popular in American weddings during the 1920s that some people considered it the official color of wedding gowns, though the trend was already fading by the 1970s.\n\nIn American weddings, brides began to wear white at a time when women began choosing white for their evening gowns, as a complement for the men's black or white dinner jackets.

So for an arithmetic sequence, if the numbers are all factors of their common multiple, the terms will alternate even and odd. You can't skip over a 5 in the list to reach a 9, for example - the sequence always ends in an even or odd number, never in a 7.

To minimize risk for both him and the cows, the rancher sells them to a butcher before making the decision. If the butcher buys the cows at a price equal to 25% discount, then the rancher keeps the discounted price per cow. If he moves them to safety, the rancher gets to keep what they were worth before the storm. If the rancher stays behind and the cows are destroyed, the he pays $120 per cow for replacement cows. Which action should the rancher take:\nOutput : It is beneficial for the rancher to take the discounted price of 25% as the risk of the storm is minimal. Moreover, he will incur a loss of only $40 per cow.\nIf the rancher takes the original price ($400 per cow) as his price for the cows, the value of the cows before the hurricane is $400 and then it is damaged to $240 due to the hurricane.\nThe difference in these values is $100 per cow and hence a loss of $400-$100 per cow.\nSo, the final answer is 240\n\nInput : A man has two jobs, which he wants", "answer": "D: making money"}

Scientist B, however, after observing the same situation declares that her 2 liter beaker will only contain 2 mole of gas after the same process and concludes she could pour the 2 mole into a smaller container because there are fewer molecules. Who is correct in their analysis of the situation??\nOutput:First scientist uses her volume to determine this is because there is no space left after she removed x mole of gas into her smaller container. So when x + 1 is put into the container its no longer 4 liters of gas but more since volume is additive this is enough evidence for her to conclude 2-1=<<2-1=1>>1 mole of gas remains in her container after she places x mole of gas in the smaller container\nWhile second scientist only uses the moles to conclude that this is due to the smaller container. However this is only because there is still 2-x moles of gas left in her container and with the smaller container she can pour extra moles in the container.\nSo since scientist B uses volume and scientist A uses only moles, scientist A is correct to conclude\nFinal Answer is A since she gives evidance with her measurements while it is a fact that she could get more volume and she does so with her new measurements.", "answer": "A: street"}

So there needs to be 6 different loaf of cheese with one piece of cheese each to feed all 30 people. The price is $5 for one loaf, but each loaf needs 6 slices at $5 per slice so we multiply by 6 and we get $30 for one loaf of cheese. For 10 people, in this case, we need to multiply by 3.

{"text": "Superman flies by and the children say skip to show excitement.\n\nInput: A farmer has 150 acres of wheat that he plans to sell to a flour mill. He is going to charge the mill $1.80 per bushel for all of the wheat he sells. The farmer makes a special deal with his trucking company to ship all of his wheat for only $1.00 per bushel.  How much, in dollars will the mill pay to the farmer if he sells all 150 acres worth of wheat?\nOutput:There are 60 bushels per acre. At $1 a bushel is $1.00 so 150 acres are 60*150=<<60*15=9000>>9000 and 60*.90 = << 60*.9=54>>54 so $1.00/$.80=<< 1/$.8=1.25>>1.25.\nSo the solution is 9000/1.25 = <<9000/ 1.25 =72>>72.\n\nInput: It costs the farmer $1.80/bushel to grow and care for his wheat. He wants to make a profit of 10% of his production cost. What is his target price, in dollars, per bushel (do not perform any mathematical procedures involving fractions)?\nOutput: His target price per bushel must also include the cost of trucking. The farmer wants to make 10% of $1.80 = <<10%=18*$1.8$=0.18>> 0.18 $ per bushel.\nBecause the trucking charge is $.80 per bushel, the farmer\u2019s net price is actually $.18-$$.80=.18, which is $1.18.\n\nInput: What will Jennie\u2019s total expense be for her hurricane evacuation transport?\nOutput: 400*20=.8*60=$<<400/60=$ 6.67>> 6.67 dollars\n\nInput: What is the correct answer to the question: (", "answer": "D: awesome"}

If the fields are 8 miles apart, how many days of the planting season are lost in transportation to the 8 miles across land to the next field?\nOutput: The corn planting season is 650 acres/35 acres/day, thus 20*35 = <<20*35= 700>>700 acres can be planted per day, assuming continuous operations. If 8 miles is crossed each day through land transport, it will take <<8 miles= <<8 miles= 2 >>2 days to go 8 miles. With this assumption of 8 miles, one could do 16 fields of 700 acres during the season. But if 8 miles is completed in one day (through air transport, perhaps), each field is 14 fields of 704 acres, each day. Thus if you can move 8 miles in one day, each field would be 10 days (35 acres per day/10 fields per day of 35).

Since all requests go through this gateway, websites see the address of the proxy server instead of the address of the client. Proxy servers are a kind of anonymizer, typically used to cloak a user's true IP address or geolocation so that websites will only be able to see a single IP address, that of the particular proxy.\nAnd according to another site the definition and explanation of anonymizer is a software that allows someone to conceal their name (or IP address) when sending information over the internet.

So for this part we will only take care of the middle of the theater. Using \u201cf\u201d as the student, where f = \"25 students, we start out with {25} possible ways to arrange the people, after arranging in such a manner where all the seats in the middle are occupied we are left with {3, 3, 3}. For each student, we look at how many we have on either side. For our first f, we don't care about the left or right, but we must account for one on each side. So as there are 3 left + 3 right, now we need to have 3 people, and we only have {3, 3}. 2nd f, and so on the rest of the f's.

For example, an anxious dog raised its voice 5 decibells in the first second and 7 decibells in second second, etc; What is the decibels of the dog after 11 seconds?\nOutput: Let the decibels (power) of the dog be given by the function: d1s where the subscript denotes the number of seconds it has been angry and 1. Then after anger for 11 second: d11 = d1 + 11*(d2s \u2013 5) where d1s = the decibels at the beginning of the 12th second since anger started (i.e. 12th number of seconds after the anger started). Also for the first 13th number of seconds, d2s = 2*(d1s), where 2 is the average increase in decibels every second. For the next number of seconds from 0 to 12, d2s = d1s. For d12 = 62. For the last number of seconds after anger from 13 to 39, d2s = (5-d1s)/(2-(d1s-1)/2) then substituting d1s=62 for the last part gives d39 = 1755.2 decibels of dog anger.", "answer": "B: appear beautiful"}

{"text": "A (get arrested)\n\nI chose A because it is a simple word that has the connotation of being a bad thing that can only happen if you get drunk.\n\nThe sentence that most stands out to me that is incorrect is \u201cBeer is delicious and makes you feel great.\u201d\n\nThe word \u201cdelicious\u201d is an adjective that I would not use to describe something that is generally bad for you.

Choices:  A: hospital B: head C: sick person D: elderly person E: doctor's office<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>I think it has to be B since a healthy person is usually not in the hospital, a sick person can be in either because they have an illness or are in the hospital under care, the doctor is also in one of the facilities, in the head, a healthy person would not have a disease in their head, and old people could be in the office. The only person there that is sick is the person in the hospital so he has to answer B.<n><n>### Answer (by 66c0d360@gmail.com):<n>B since a sick person is always in a hospital and since a doctor's office is filled with sick people he could contract an illness, but it's the sickest who is the most vulnerable to diseases due to weakened immune systems caused by the illness, but if you're healthy you're not contracting the illness.<n><n>### Input<n>A man is purchasing a book for a class.

There is not yet a increase for every 1 extra year of service.  It will be the next year 12 year mark that there will be a 12.63% increase.  But the coach should make $92,700 per year next year and $106,881 the next year. And the coach at 13 years will make $125,000

His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Rationales: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

Choices:  A: pub B: plane C: beer D: store E: fraternity house<n><n>### Response:		I would suggest going to a pub as suggested, but maybe try a better quality one than the choices you have since my understanding is pub food is notorious for being fattening at a large portion size. However, you can at least choose to eat there what you like and take a stroll from the pub down to fraternity with your friends<n><n><n>

The raises depend on how many years of service staffers have in the company. If a person has one year or less of service, her raise is the same as her current salary. If her service level is greater than one year, her raise is 20 percent of her current salary plus her current salary. How many staffers working for the company are eligible for the 20 percent raise?<n>Rationales1:Raise is the same as salary, so no one can get the raise. Since everyone has 1 year of service, no one can get the 20% raise. The statement given that tells that the raise is 20% of the salary plus the salary. So the only people to get the raise are the people with the year of service of 2 or higher.<n><n>Input2:The company is giving its staff a $300 holiday bonus this year.  If each worker has worked in the company a given number of years, there's a different monetary bonus amount that's issued to each worker.  If you work in the company for 2 years, you receive a $30 bonus.  If you work for 10 years, that bonus becomes $300.  If you have worked in the company for 15 years, the annual bonus is $650.  If you work 20-24 years

Choices:  A: economic instability B: not noticeable C: spend more D: rising interest rates E: boring<n><n>### Response:		I really want to say D: rising interest rates, but really A: economic instability does the job, but C: spend more makes the most sense because they are not going to raise rates to try to fight inflation (other than maybe a.1% raise) they will keep inflation at a rate where people don't notice. C: spend more is probably the largest cause of inflation, but they do it to keep up with the cost of living.<n>Not B and E.<n><n>### Input<n>Sometimes paying for education is worth it.

(For example, how much would the average employee that is 30 work out to versus how much that person should make if they had a degree? In other words, is the average person going to make say, $30,000 dollars in their 30th year? Or should they be making say, $100,000 because they have a degree? You would argue that people are at a disadvantage if they go to college because they have spent that time learning and have less experience. So while college graduates don't have experience, it is almost equal to the amount of experience a non-graduate who is the same age would have.)<n>I think that there are people in this country that would gladly pay a million dollars an hour to see a doctor instead of paying $60,000 an hour!<n><n>The value of your degree will depend on a number of factors.<n>I was a student at the University of South Carolina that took me two and one fourth years to graduate. But in South Carolina, it costs you around four years worth of tuition every year. So I was paying four years worth of tuitions even though it only took me two and one forth years to graduate.

The train fare is $32 one way for the first journey. $26 for the second and third journeys, and $31 for the last three trips. How much will Demetri  pay for his train journeys?<n>### Rationales:<n><n>There are six journeys altogether, which means that the final total number of journeys will be 7, and in each journey we take there will be 2x(fare)=<<2x(fare)=24>>24$2 for the train fare, and 1x(fare)=<<1x(fare)=32>>32$1 for the train ticket. Therefore the total amount he will pay for the train journeys is 2*7+1*7=<<2*7+1=145>>145$ for the first journey, and 2*6+1*6+2*5+1*5+2*4+1*4+2*3+1=<<2*6+…+2*3+…+2=125+56+38+19+9+1>>1146for the last journey.

It is to increase taxes on essential goods so people can’t afford to consume a lot of necessary items. This can also solve the unemployment problem. Government can also change the monetary policy to control inflation by lowering money supply so people don’t borrow as much. It is also important to maintain the balance between fiscal and monetary policies. Otherwise, the inflation could create a vicious circle. People will have more money, increasing inflation rates, and prices for goods will rise, causing them to have more money even more. Government also need to increase productive capacity by investing on new technology, investing on infrastructure improvement and rebuilding infrastructures that were destroyed by natural disaster and provide people with jobs.<n><n>Finally, government needs to control speculation in the economy by limiting the trading in securities and controlling of prices on commodities. It can be done by regulating of futures exchange.”}<n><n>### Input:`You have a 100 gram bag of sugar. A friend wants to borrow 6 gram of sugar.

That is definitely a possible approach to writing an effective critique on a literary and/or historical document. However, I think the more effective way to critique these texts is to write a letter to the author's primary audience. This will be the reader, and they will definitely be different from the author. This reader will be someone that is interested in the subject matter of this primary text, and I will be writing them from the viewpoint of the intended reader.<n><n>In reference to the text "A Letter in Time of Plague", written by an anonymous writer.<n><n>Dear "Anonymous",<n><n>The time in which you wrote was a time of great plague. Many lives were lost and people were scared. I can tell by the word choice in your text that you are scared for your life. I can only imagine the suffering and death that you have witnessed. In a time like this I think everyone is scared because they know that it could quickly take their life. It's important for people reading this message that you are writing anonymously that it wasn't your place to mention the names of the dead but it's really important for you to write about the fact that so many people are dead because of this plague. "When the corpses are carried to be buried you see some that die a second time on the way, and many others are carried out that seem to be alive, and in the course of a few days they die." When you wrote this it wasn't the time or place for the names of the dead to be put out there in the world. But what you did do was put an entire idea of what the plague was doing to your town. You put out the idea that so many people are dying, and it wasn't because God was angry with me.<n><n><n>This is the reason I think a reader at the time you were writing would have felt comforted by what you said in

Choices:  A: eaten B: glassess C: jar D: pizza E: refrigerator<n><n>### Response:		<n>I think that you could put the olives in a jar because if they are in a jar they have a closed lid and the refrigerator has a door that can be tightly shut, thus keeping everything from being wet and the refrigeratoer could also be able to keep everything from getting wet.  If the olives are in a jar, food may get wet outside of the jar, but I do not think it would get wet while it was in the jar.  Another way to prevent the olives from getting nearby food wet is to just put them in a jar with something, if thats possible, to make it so that if they do wet something they will at least not wet the top and that is better. Also I could just put them in a separate room because it is unlikely they would want food and would just eat the olives.<n><n>### Input<n>Grocery Store A will have a free sample of a new type of tomato soup.

The demand is driving what to carry them? Choices:  A: ditch B: shop C: north america D: pet shops E: outdoors<n><n>### Response:		<n>The correct answer is : Exotic snakes are selling like hotcakes, which is why prices are rising.<n><n>### Conclusion:<n>In order to understand the current market of exotic snakes, one must look at the 4 main factors, which are price, quantity, demand and supply.<n><n>In this case, we are dealing with an increase in price of exotic snakes caused by an increase in demand.<n>This is known as a market failure, which is a circumstance that leads to an inefficient market, where the price of the good is higher than under a situation of perfect competition.<n><n>The law of supply and demand states that in a free market, when the price of a good or service rises, an extra quantity will be offered for sale, and when the price falls, quantity demanded will rise.<n><n>In this current market it looks as if the price has increased, in terms of snake owners who are now willing to pay more money to buy these snakes. This could be because snake owners want to show off their snakes by buying accessories for the snakes such as exotic cages, this could mean that there is an increase in the quantity demanded for these goods and services and an increase in price.<n><n>Because there is an increase in demand, the quantity supplied will decrease. With 6 exotic snakes remaining up for grabs, the owners who previously sold their snakes at 300 could decide to increase their price to over 300 now that demand is higher and the quantity supplied falls, meaning now that there are more people competing to own the exotic snakes they are willing to pay more and more, therefore the price of the 6 snakes has increased from 300, to 312.50.<n><n>### Rationales:<n><n>With respects to an equation, the law of supply is represented by the equation price=f(s), and represents the inverse of inverse of price=/ 1\(d\) and represents the inverse of the law demand.<n>In an increase in price, the quantity demanded would decrease. An increase in price would not necessarily cause a shift in demand. It would need to be a shift in the market price. For a new market to arise, there will need to be an increase in the number of buyers, and for the same amount of buyers, there would need

I have 75 percent of the available space in my room.  I could store all of the rice in my storage closet on the floor, if I stacked each bag on top of another bag.  The bags each measure 6 × 11 × 13 inches.

I then store the rice in my closet on the floor.  Each bag is 6 × 12 × 14 inches tall.  If I were able to store the rice in the closet, I would have an additional 6*12*14 / 55 = <<6*12*24/55=1>>12.65% of my available space for storage.

You are using the wrong syntax for your code.<n><n>Firstly,  there is no need to write your function in an outer function. Also, function body should always have a bracket `{}`. The 2nd and 3rd line should be:<n><n>\begin{code}<n>def answerQuestion():<n>    """<n>    Description: The function will find which of your answer is correct according to given question and instructions.<n>    """<n>    # Write this: instructionAnswer = ("Input Question here, example:")<n><n>    instructionAnswer = """<n>    input: The car-renting agency charges $32/day for a car and $15 for the first week for rental that last over 7 days.

I highly suggest you to look through basic python functions [here](https://www.javatpoint.com/python-functions)<n><n>Comment: I tried it and now I get a syntax error. The first time I tried it, the function was empty, and therefore an error was returned. Is there somewhere it is telling me the syntax line is wrong? I tried changing it to: def answerQuestion (): # function body, instructionAnswer = instructionToAnswers.<n>                                                                                                        question = answerQuestion()<n>but I still have the syntax error.<n><n>Comment: Hi I have amended it, as I suggest that you need to look

What does the charge for a purchase of $24, exactly on the $15 line? Round your answer to the nearest cent.<n>Rationales:<n>1. When the purchase under $5 is $5 the cost is $18. So to get an exact answer we subtract $5+$18 by $13 giving us 5+18-13.<n>2. If the purchase of $24 is at least $5, you must multiply it by.3 (30%): 9(24) is 124+9=133.<n>3. When you exceed $95 the 40% is $38.<n>4. So you are left with a cost of 131+38.<n>5. Round with 3 signifigant figures. 131+0.38 = 131 rounded + 0.38= 131.38/2 = -.69, so your final answer is -.69.<n>#### -.69<n>Answer: -.69<n><n>### Input II<n>Input:A 16-ounce bottle of water costs either $.78 if you buy it at a grocery store, or $.40 if you buy it at the gas station.

Second choice ($360/night) is not possible to charge such a high price either since the price for a night is quite high. Third choice ($500/night) is quite high as well but its not too high and it would be ok to charge a price of $500. The fourth choice ($5000/Week) is too much to be charged for 1 Week.

Colorado d. Alaska e. Oregon<n><n>### Response (Answer):b<n>### Input:Because of a severe drought, ranchers must rely on wells as a source of fresh water for their herds.  They often drill more than one well on their properties because a single well can dry up.  Because the water table sinks during the summer drought, the first wells drilled during the dry season produce more water than later wells, but at a greater cost per gallon.  Which of the following is an example of a comparative advantage? Choices:  no two farms  have the same water wells  have the same costs  have the same access to water<n><n>### Response :e<n>### Rationale:Comparative advantage explains why two parties can improve the well-being of one another even though one party has less of an advantage than the other. In this case, even though Cowboy John’s cattle herd produces only half as much milk as Cowboy Bob’s does, Cowboy John can improve Bob’s well-being by selling his milk to Cowboy Bob in exchange for Bob’s hay.<n>#### Solution:<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n>Input: The car rental company charges $50/day for a standard-class rental, or $250 for two weeks.

Choices:  A: relaxation B: exhaustion C: energetic D: become stronger E: use energy<n><n>### Response:		<n>#### Answer:<n>A<n>### Demonstrability:<n>The word “exercise” refers to something like running, lifting weights, or walking.  It is something physical and an activity that helps you.<n>So, one can see “immediately” in the expression “immediate relief/result” which would help out the person who is exercising so it would be “feel” relaxed or less “tightness/stiffness” or even “get better”.<n>To do a good physical activity it is important to “warm-up the area” or muscle so you are “ready” to exercise. <n>And also, to “stretch out” the muscle after exercise in order to relax and “loosen up” if it needs to be more flexible for the day to day activities. <n>So overall, to exercise is a good thing to do but it is important to warm-up and stretch afterwards.<n>So, to exercise “immediately” or  “right away” leads to<n> relaxation.<n><n>### Comments:<n>[**This solution was done by:**](https://stackoverflow.com/users/10207914/kyle-jones)<n><n>### Instructions:Input: Answer the following multiple choice question with a choice that best completes the sentence.

How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Rationales: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>#### 310<n>Answer: 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Rationales: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

Choices:  A: grandma B: clothing C: jewelry store D: clothes E: fabric store<n><n>### Response:		 I would look at grandma’s house for a quilt.<n><n>### Rationale:<n>The clothes and other things that you wear don’t contain velvet.  You don’t need to buy clothes for a quilt, it would be hard to sew it.<n>A women’s jewelry store would not have a quilt in it for sure.  The woman was going to build a quilt from scratch so that answer would be incorrect.  A fabric store would have the velvet and the woman is not building the quilt from a pattern as there is no template so that was another incorrect answer.<n>The only answer that was left was Grandmother’s house.  Grandmother’s houses has quilts and grandmothers usually give those quilts away to her grandchildren.<n><n># Task 1<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question <n><n>### Instredtions:<n>Input:(1) 60 miles/hr (2) 60 mph Output: 1h<n>Input:(1) $30/d, 7d Output: $210<n>Input:(1) x = 20; (2) 2 x Output: 40<n>Input:(1)(2) $50/m (3) 14 days Output: $500<n><n>## Task 2#<n><n>## Input:What was the fastest mile ever run by a human?<n><n>### Instrections:Input:<n><n>### Demostration:<n>### Rationalees:<n>### Input:"Cathy is going to ride on a roller coaster that goes 46 feet above the ground.

Choices:  A: factory B: construction site C: engine D: insides of skyscraper's walls E: shops<n><n>### Response:		<n>A<n><n>### Rationale:<n>I think the answer is A, because according to the definition of workman's compensations:  _(Web Defenition)_  is a form of insurance providing wage replacement and medical benefits to employees injured in the course of employment in exchange for mandatory relinquishment of the employee's right to sue his or her employer for the tort of negligence.  Workers' compensation may also provide rehabilitation services.<n>```<n>There's an example on the website below:<n><n>A carpenter in Missouri was helping paint a roof repair.  His employer paid him a per day-rate for everyday that he worked.  He fell off the roof and suffered personal injury.  His employer would not make future payments to him because it found he had misrepresented his health in applying for work.  It turned out that the employer had obtained workers' compensation insurance to pay for worker's benefits but hadn't paid its policy premiums for that insurance.  There's nothing in workers' compensation law that prevented the employer from terminating the worker, but if the worker had brought an action for negligence against the employer, it was required to purchase insurance to cover that tort.  Since Missouri has compulsory workers' compensation, it must make all necessary insurance payments.<n>```<n>According to this example, workman's compensaton is paid in the factory of an apprentice.<n>```<n>In Workman's Compensation - Construction Industry, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires employers to carry workers' compensation insurace for all employees, as long as three or more are employed anywhere, or they are employed as domestic service workers in private homes.<n>```<n>So the answer must be A, because the guy tripped over a metal-rod on the building (factory) and he was injured. <n><n>### Credits:<n>I watched Youtube video to know the answer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIyM0Duq1Fc<n><n>### Link:https://www.youtube.c

To answer your question, I am not taking any classes at the moment right because I am preparing for the exams. So tennis elbow is not what comes to my mind as an answer here. If we are talking about tennis players, then I can just think of the answer C. A professional who is good at his/her game must have good health to excel and it is very stressful on the arms and to play for a very long time for 5, 10, and 20 years you’ll feel the stress in your arms. That’s why people go to rehab to get the muscles back and I think tennis players have to go to rehab to restore their strength.<n><n>Thank you for your time and for thinking of me.<n>Warmest regards,<n>Fahad<n><n>### Input : a: you can have the game B: you can spend hours doing it<n>### response:<n>Dear,<n>You can spend an awful lot of hours just on tennis with the two of you playing tennis games for hours on end. My mom used to love the game so much that she’d be up in the afternoon playing tennis in this club and get back at dusk and if we’d asked her to play at night, she’d say okay and be off for that one match. It’s very exciting but if you’re playing long into the night it can lead to a few health issues like tennis elbow being one of them but that’s a topic for another day. When I am done with my exams, I’ll be happy to spend time playing tennis and my mom will be happy to have my dad home so I am looking forward to spending that time together with them.<n><n>Thank you so much for your time.<n>Warmest Regards,<n>Fahad <n>

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Rationales: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>#### 310<n>Answer: 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Rationales: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Rationales: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>#### 800<n>Answer: 800<n><n>### Input:A blowfish lives free. He lives on his own. Where does he live? Choices:  A: fish market B: pet shop C: great outdoors D: river E: little mermaid<n><n>### Response:		The answer, A. You can't have a pet in the wild.<n><n>Input: A blowfish lives free.  He lives on his own with his own blowfish friends and blowfish cousins.  They feed on tiny snails and crustaceans.  Every day they like to have a blowfish party.  Where does he live?  Choices:  A) fish market, B) pet shop, C) great outdoors, D) river, E) the little mermaid<n>Rationales: We know that the blowfish lives with other blowfish as well as his own cousins.  The only place this could happen is if the blowfish is a pet in somebody’s household.  The blowfish might go to the fish market to get supplies, but would hardly be able to stay there for an extended time without being sold.  In the fish market, he would have to stay by himself or with the other blowfish that the owner had purchased at the fish market.  The owner would give this blowfish the only option of staying with other blowfish so it is a family of blowfish.<n><n>The owner wouldn’t take the blowfish outside of the pet store to the great outdoors.  The blowfish wouldn’t know how to stay or care for itself at all.<n>In the river, the blowfish would be exposed to the various sea critters, including mermaids, which would most likely eat it.  In the great outdoors, the blowfish would likely become an extinct species due to pollution, pesticides, and other things of that nature. We also know the blowfish has cousins of its own.  They should be of the same blood, and thus have the same needs for food and water, as well as living space.<n><n>The only place the blowfish can live is in a fish tank.  Therefore, only if the blowfish’s environment is managed appropriately will he be able to successfully survive and make it to adulthood.  The blowfish must live in its own tank and with its cousins so that they can provide the appropriate enclosure.<n><n>The most appropriate choice is A.<n><n>Answer: A<n><n>### Input<n>A turtle is traveling by boat.

If the purchaser rents the house for one night, they will pay John $150. If the purchaser rented on one day during the summer and during Christmas week, they will pay John 170. If the purchasers rented every day of the year, they will pay him only 100.<n>  What is John’s best strategy?<n><n>### Rationales:<n>To determine which option to select, we simply have to evaluate the total value of renting for one night for each option.<n><n>* 1- $100 = $150<n>* 7- $700 = $1050<n>* 365- $36500 = $160500<n><n>Thus, John’s best strategy is to select the option where he rents everyday-because it gives him the highest rental amount.<n><n>### Response<n>Option B<n><n>### Input <n>- John owns a car for $480 per year.  He can park at his office during the week or at home in a garage for $240 during the week.<n>- If he parks at his office and then takes a train, he can take the train each weekday for $25.

His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Rationales: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Rationales: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>#### 800<n>Answer: 800<n><n>### Input:If I screw a chain ring onto something, what am I fixing?

In what order did each person sit at his or her table?<n><n>### Rationales:<n><n>#### ANSWER:<n>1: Alice 2: Bob 3: Carol<n><n>### Input<n>Which answer choice contains a correctly written sentence using the independent and dependent clauses? A.The man is going to have dinner with his family. B.If the man has money,he is going to have dinner. C.Either the man has money or he is going to have dinner D.Since the man has money, he will have dinner.<n>Rationales:<n><n>```<n>A: has dinner with his family.<n>```<n><n>The man in the sentence can be a subject, and the man has to be the subject to be the first word of the sentence and be able to use is going to have dinner and the family in an independent clause after the comma and the second is going to have dinner can only be a predicate. the family must not be a subject which means if it is a predicate it is the dependent clause.<n><n>```<n>B: If the man has money,<n>```<n><n>The if the man has money is the subject for the sentence since it is used as the predicate at the end.<n><n>```<n>C. Either the man has money.<n>```<n><n>Either the man has to be used as the predicate if it is used as an independent clause after the commas. This means if it is either the man has money or the man has money, there are two ways to write if the man has money. So this is a correct example.<n><n>```<n>D. Since the man has money, <n>```<n><n>This uses if the man has money as a predicate for the sentence which is why it is a dependent clause.

I also have a sword in my sheath but it’s in my backpack if I needed that I think.  There is also a “container” or a “scabbard” in my house.  (Excuse me! I have a little toy sword that comes with the Nerf gun case that is what I meant by the container or the scabbard! I can’t help it if my child loves her toy sword so much that she takes it with her to school!)  There is a museum and a sword closet but I do not own the sword in it, therefore the answer has to be a sword closet.

Choices:  A: injuries B: fatigue C: traffic jams D: tired E: accidents<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>### Explain:<n>A reckless driver can cause accidents.<n><n>### Answer:<n><n>### The Answer<n>Answer: B<n><n>### Rationale: I believe the answer is A but the answer is B<n><n>### Explaination: The answer is B, since reckless driving leads to fatigue.<n><n>### I think the answer choice should be reworded.<n><n>### Instead of saying it "leads to" or "causes" it should say "results In" and "can cause."<n><n>### The word "leads" doesn't fit since a person cannot drive alone nor is a person driving.<n><n>### To be safe please change it to "can cause" and "results In."<n><n>### Rationales: The first sentence of the question says: "What does reckless driving  >>"leads>>" to on a person?" We can safely remove "to." When the sentence is restated as: "What does  >>"leads to a person>>  on reckless driving?" we can drop "reckless" because it's part of the sentence. So, the sentence can now be restated: "What does  driving to a person on a person?" We know the answer to this is B, fatigue.<n><n>#### B<n><n>Answer: B<n>

The first and third quadrants are positive numbers, the second and fourth quadrants are negative numbers, and the center of the graph is zero, where x=0. How many distinct negative numbers greater than -2 have an absolute value of 10?<n><n>### Response::: B: Because the center is zero. Any integer can be represented on the number line, so no other negative numbers besides -2 could be smaller than -2 and still have an absolute value of ten.<n>### This means we can solve for any of those 4 quadrant by multiplying a number that represents a certain direction on the y co-ordinate. In the x co-coordinate. To be very specific on the number line. We can multiply our y co-ordinate to -4 when it goes down because we want 10 absolute value and 4 is the size and we can multiply 2 to the other x co-ordinate when it goes down because it goes down by the number we want and we get absolute value of 1 and we can multiply 3 to the other x co co-ordinate so it goes up because it goes up in the other direction. That is the positive side and we can get a minus of our x co-ordinate. That leaves us with absolute value of negative 1. Then we have only a multiplier of 1 and we have already completed the problem.

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Rationales: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>#### 310<n>Answer: 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Rationales: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Rationales: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>#### 800<n>Answer: 800<n><n>### Input:What is a place where you usually store dishes but not books? Choices:  A: apartment B: pantry C: table D: living room E: shelf<n><n>### Response:		E<n><n>### Concept:<n>> Definition: A container, space, or area used to store something often in a systematic organized manner, e.g., in a library in the alphabetical order.<n>><n>> This is true because of all of the choices given in the question, "shelf" would be a more appropriate definition for this question, because each of the choices is not a place where you usually would store dishes but not book.<n><n>### Input<n>In a class, there are 40 students and all of the students take calculus. The student has 5 calculus teachers, with each teaching 5 classes a day. It can make 100 classes a day.<n><n>### Response<n><n>> The answer is 500, because there are 40 classes and 5 teachers. It was divided by 10 because there are 5 classes for each teacher.<n><n>### Analysis:<n>> The question states that there are 40 calculus teachers in the class.<n>The number of calculus teachers is equal to the number of classes in the class.<n>```<n>  40=500/1      (40/5)<n>```<n>> The question states 40 is divided by 5, so there is 40 classes. Since there 5 teachers, you can find the number of classes there are in each class.<n>```<n>      5/5  5      10<n>```<n>**Example**:<n><n>```<n>      Let <n>        n = Number of classes <n>        m = Number of the mathematics teachers.<n>        <n>        n=500/m<n>           500 = Number of classes,<n>               5 = Number of the mathematics' teachers<n>           5=m<n>        m=100<n>```<n><n>### Conclusion/Explanation<n>The conclusion and the explanation are that in a system a there are 500 classes. There are 5 classes in each class.Therefore, there are 5 classes.<n><n>This explains how to perform calculations. It tells what to do to make this problem easier.<n><n><n>### Questions?<n>If there are any questions, please contact me. I will be available on slack.

An incomplete pass is worth minus two points, a touchdown one point, a touchback three points, and a safety two points. The Green Bay Packers led the Baltimore Colts 21 to minus-3 by the end of one quarter, and 25 to 6 at halftime.  What was the score in the second half? <n><n>### Response - Rationale: The Packers lost a point for each completed play. They scored five touchdowns, and the other team scored once, therefore the Packers scored 5 points and the other team scored 2 points. They gave one point to the other team, therefore the final score for the game was 32 for the Packers and 4 for the other team (32=21+11)<n><n>### Input –  Question: What is the range, in degrees Celsius (0 to  100), of a temperature of 25 degrees Fahrenheit (77 degrees Farenheit)?<n><n>### Response — Rationale: If you consider that the range is going from 0-100 the answer would be going from 25 to 75.

However, (1)*6+(1)6+(1)*(11)-(2)*(24)6+(1)*24-(2)24 is 192.<n><n>### Comments:<n>6 * 15 - 12 * 12 / 2 * 12 - 4 * 24 = - 12.  Adding -12 to 6 * 15 is 6 * 16 = 96.  So 96 - 180 = - 84. Next, we have 180 - 12 = 168.  Next, we have 6 - 4 = 2. So 2 - 84 - 168 = - 204. But we still need the other factor, 2, so we have 204/2 + 96/2 = 202/2 + 48/2 = 101/2. 101/125 - 25 (which equals -3/8).

The winds should be low (10 knots), but the temperature will drop into the 10-20 range and climb back up into the 30s.<n><n>Each day of a five-day trek, the guide informs climbers, requires the equivalent of a rest day spent down at lower elevations.  Therefore, after two days of travel, with a planned campsite somewhere near the summit, the climber needs to choose one of the following two options: 1) rest in the campsite provided at the base of the mountain, or 2) return to the nearest trailhead to spend the night.<n><n>Which is the correct description of the forecast information given above?<n>RationalesThe temperatures are expected to rise on day three from low temperatures on day two into temperatures that are close to those experienced on day five.<n><n>Days two and three are supposed to be quite windy, and it is also quite unlikely that conditions will be as calm as expected at both campgrounds on those days.<n><n>During day two and day five, the conditions can be as calm as they are expected to be on day four.<n><n>Since the guide estimates that each day is the equivalent of a restful day, and the guide expects that each of days two, three, and five will be rather windy, it is logical to assume that either campground could be windy and uncomfortable

Ten employees chose to leave the company.  How many employees did the company have 5 years ago?<n><n>### Response A:<n>You will notice that the problem does not include the number of employees it started with. This means that it is not necessary to use a ratio.<n><n>In order to solve this, all they did in this situation was they took the difference between how many are left and how many were. Therefore, they took the difference of 70-10 = 60. Since we know that 10 are leaving, we know that the answer will be smaller.<n><n>#### 7<n><n>Answer: 60<n><n>###

This was bad.  He would be unable to hold his tools if he injured what? Choices:  A: hostility B: anger C: nose D: fists E: hands<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answers: B  Anonymous <n><n>Answer Comments: Punctuation marks can be placed after or before a sentence term or title, but the words are not capitalized (except for proper nouns). Here, 'Bonjour', the opening words of many French-language TV programs, is the title of the program. Other examples from the text include 'The End'. Except for proper nouns, sentence terms, or titles, there are no capital words. <n><n>The article, 'The' is capitalized in titles. For example, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, The Hobbit, The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, The Da Vinci Code, The Great Gatsby, The God of Small Things, The Color Purple, and The Great Gatsby to name a few are all books with stories, characters and names that are all "The" titles. <n><n>### Input:(The)Bonjour!<n>### Demon: <n>It's best to put the apostrophe before 'The', but I don't. (Grammatical rules are not my forte.)<n>Therefore, the question mark and semicolon belong before 'The'. Otherwise, if you reverse the order of 'The' and 'Bonjour!' the question mark would go after 'bonjour' and the semicolon would go after the first '!'.<n>However, some editors write like this. <n><n>## How It Works<n><n>![](../images/logo.png)<n><n>![](../media/icon.png)<n><n><n><n><n><n>### Get in Touch<n><n>####  Instructors<n><n>| Name   | Email |<n>| ------ | ----- |<n>| Anony  | Anony@gmail.com   |<n><n>##### Contact Details:<n><n>| Name            | Email                                   | Mobile No.             |<n>| --------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------- |<n>| Dr. Ketan        | ketankumarpatel634@gmail.com          |   9413424571           |<n>| Dr. Rushikesh    | rushikeshpatel101@gmail.com            |      9461360721        |<n>| Mr

It is important to learn how to do this and get familiar with it.<n><n>Input: What do you do when someone does not want to learn something new?<n><n>Answer: I do not ask them if they want to learn. It is not something that can be forced on someone and when they don’t want something it is not going to create success. I may ask them if they are okay with learning and if they are having difficulty. Sometimes people have trouble just accepting that they do not know certain things. That learning can be exciting and not painful or free. They can also change my perception of the learning process if I change it on them. They could get distracted or get dejected and just say they are not learning. If I change my perspective on them, not change them on me then I can help people focus and not lose interest by changing my attitude. If you don’t like how the learning process is going then it can feel like it is painful as well. In the end it is the responsibility of the person to learn to change their perception and see the learning process to be what it can be instead of what they think it is.<n><n>### Input Challenge<n><n>Challenge<n><n>This is not a challenge.<n><n>This is not an exercise in trying to force information upon a person that will make them want to learn any less.

How much will it cost him?<n>Rationales: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>#### 800<n>Answer: 800<n><n>### Input:A common saying, Sam thought, was to go forth, also this.

What's the best way to weigh both of them?<n><n>### Response<n>A<n><n>### InputA train departs a station traveling at 50 mph towards the train yard. The length of this train is 520  ft. with 100 trains in a string of trains in order to park all of them correctly in the train yard. The train yard needs to be 1 mile long  to hold all of the trains and the trains should be parked every 110 ft. apart.  When will the train be able to get onto the train yard?<n><n>### Demos : the train will take it's distance = 520/50 = <<520/55=10>>10 miles. The entire train is 10 miles. So in each 520 ft it travelled 520/10 = <<525>>525 ft. And so in 520ft it covered 520/2= <<520/2)=260>>260 ft.<n><n>### Rationales<n>This is a little odd, but the train is just traveling the distance between stations, and getting closer to the train yard, each time it makes a stop.<n><n>So it will arrive once it goes the long distance back and forth.<n><n>So since 130/55=<<130/50=2>>2 trips it will take, it will arrive at the train yard = 520*(50+2)=<<520*(55+2)=110>>110<n><n>So just the one station it will take 110/50 =<<110/55=4>>4 trips.<n><n>Or 260/50=<<26

Choice B: Newspaper would not be appropriate because it is not a letter, but it could have been delivered by a paperboy. Mail boxes would also have to have their keys returned to them upon entry to the property if they do have to open the main door. Choice A: Front door would not be appropriate if they were unable to return the key to the house as the owner would not be able to enter their residence while the delivery person is working.

This is the key to the answer when it states “open or locked”. The “or” does not discriminate between “front door” or “mailbox”. As for the “find”, when a person might “find” something this could be the front door was left open because of some reason to do so. It does not discriminate if they opened it or did not open it. Choice: Door Locked<n><n>The front door does not have to be open in order to use the mailbox. Choice: Mailbox<n><n>When a person might “find theirs open” the letter was probably not mailed to the home directly from the mail. It had to be mailed to somewhere else and if it said it was delivered to their front door it probably went to the box and they could

Larger villages tend to be more self sufficient because they can provide for the necessities of trade (Food, Warmth, Water, etc.) and for their people. Larger villages would thus be more likely to be located in the countryside.<n><n>### Input<n>You decide that you want to invest $200 to $210 in the stock market.<n><n>### Response<n>I would invest $200 in the stock market because that money would allow me to make a profit of $50-$60, depending if the stock goes down by around 7% or goes down by at least -18%. If the stock went down by 7%, the money value would be less since the stock went down, resulting in the profit being less as well. Since 200-50=$150 and 200-60=$140.<n><n>### Multiple Choice Question:<n>What will be the total value after a week on the market, assuming the stock always goes up a percentage of the purchase price, but never go down more than a percentage as well?<n><n>A) $788.84 B) $914.16 C) $803.48 D) $810.20<n><n>### Answer:<n>The value on the market of the stock is going to be somewhere between $788.4 and $810.8 after one week.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>This scenario can be viewed as a way to increase your financial portfolio, or increase your purchasing power in the market.<n><n>## Input:<n>The first week on the market, the stock will rise between a 6% - 7%<n>The following week on the market, it will rise another 6% - 9% (15% - 18%)<n><n>Increasing the percentage rate on the market every time the stock is on the market for a week might increase the value of the investment.<n><n>For example, after the second week (Week 2), it should be worth:<n><n>$200 + 15% of $200 = _________ = ________________   = $230<n><n>and a week

Is knowledge necessary? What role does curiosity play? If they are ignorant what does that mean? <n><n>### Rationale:<n>Ignorance is the state of being uneducated, unaware, or unknowledgeable.<n>Knowledge is defined as facts, information, and skills acquired through experiences and education.<n><n>Ignorance is not an excuse because ignorance does not mean naive or stupid. It means the inability to answer a question, explain something, or resolve a problem.<n>People can make a conscious decision not to know something. They could choose that they do not need to know, so they don’t act on their desire to know.<n><n>Curiosity is key to the progress of the human species, but ignorance is not bliss. As a society we are faced with ever more complex, interconnected problems to solve. We live in communities and rely on public-serving institutions like schools and healthcare. Ignorance creates a barrier for us to reach solutions for these challenges.<n><n>### Assumption:<n>While I can understand that people do feel bliss, ignorance does not mean happiness, and I will take some time to discuss the difference between ignorance and bliss.<n>Ignorance is knowledge of a problem with a choice to let the problem go and live in bliss. Bliss is an emotional state that is produced within the human body. <n><n>### Output:<n>Ignorance: Ignorance would be someone who did not know the answer to the question and was not even educated with the knowledge to find the answer. They do not know how to fix the problem and therefore the problem exists and could continue to exist.<n><n>Bliss: Bliss would be the state of not knowing that their is a problem and having no reason to know that there is a problem. Their body chemistry is producing happiness, which is a great state to be in.<n><n>While ignorance is a problem, bliss is not and does not mean it is not a problem. <n><n><n><n><n><!-- # Rationale: <n><n>There were 17 questions on the exam.

He goes to three different tailors and tries on each of three suit.  The first tailor shows a suit that has a collar that stands up six inches.  The second tailor shows a suit which has a collar that will rise six and one-half inches.  The third tailor shows a collar that will push up six and one-quarter inches.  The first man says that he likes the second (or the third) suit the best.  Which collar is taller?<n><n>Rationales:<n>First, the man wanted the top collar to have six inches then the man went to the next collar with six and one half inches so the height went up<n>Next, the man went to the third tailor and asked if the suit had a higher collar and this one had six and one quarter inches.  Since the previous collar in the previous tailor shop was six and one half inches we can deduce that the top collar from the previous tailor shop went up six and one half inches.  Since the second tailor had the biggest collar of all three tailors and the man said he liked it the best we know that he saw the top collar from this one the best so we can deduce that this collar went up six and one quarter inches to make the highest collar of all three.  In this situation 6.25 is greater than 6.5 so therefore the top collar from tailor three is the tallest collar.<n><n>#### 39<n>Answer: 6.25<n><n><n><n>RATIONAL 2<n><n>### Input/Output<n>Input: The total number of ounces in 2 pounds of flour is?<n>Rationales: There is 16 ounces per pound<n>2 times 16=<<2*16=32>>32 ounces of flour in 2 pounds<n><n>#### 72<n>Answer: 72<n><n>Input: How many weeks will be in six months?<n>Rationales<n>We know that there are 52 weeks in one year so we get 6/52=<<6/52=1/9>>1/9 of one year so there will be six months

Choices:  A: sit down B: make mistakes C: have sex D: reproduce E: excrete<n><n>### Response:		If they were using their legs to get somewhere else, we'd expect them to sit down, or if they don't have somewhere else to go they would make a mistake. Also, because humans can't excrete at will, they can't eliminate wastes. If their legs were tired from running they would either sit down, or would be forced to make mistakes. The question seems a bit vague, so we don't know whether or not the leg fatigue was caused from running or not. <n><n>### Input-How many times would you walk one day? <n><n>### Response-Human average walking speed is around 3 to 4.5 mph, according to experts (http://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/walking/features/walking-speed), which means a person with a short walk takes 2 to 2.5 hours to walk one-mile. A person who is not using a walker averages 1.2 miles/hour, and they take about one hour to walk one-mile, according to a US Census Bureau (http://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/datasets/2006-2010/summary_file/2010/2010_US/2010-05-04-2010-DRG-ZS832_001.xls). This means that if you walk 5,000 feet, you would walk for 4 to 5 hours in a day. I think that five hours of walking would be a normal amount but could be difficult if your legs are especially tired, because in general people tend to walk more if their legs are not tired.<n>

On Sunday morning, at 9 a.m., someone went to see if tickets were still on sale. They learned that all the seats were already sold and no new tickets were being sold. What time, in minutes, was it when they learned that there were no seats still available?<n><n>### Response<n>The problem states,"The theater is showing a $5 movie." So I know it is most likely a matinee because they state $5 dollars but if they're charging $5 dollars for the movie it would've sold out earlier like 20-30 minutes into the showing. So i'd say it would be about 6-7pm that they'd put that up (since 30 minutes in to your ticket price is about $1.75)<n>6-7:30pm<n>1:42pm-2:02pm<n><n>### Input2:<n>A man’s aunt sold 37 pairs of shoes last week at the mall. The selling price of each pair of shoes was $22 more than 3 times the price the shoe cost her to buy them. What was the price of the shoes she bought and how much profit did she make?<n><n>### Demostration<n>The cost is the initial price and how much you sell it for is the profit. I'm just going to give you some basic equations here. So $22 and 3 times the cost $22=3*c=$22=x=$$ 22 dollars.  You get the profit of 22 dollars<n><n>### Input3:<n>The cost of renting this room for three hours is $750 plus a $25/hour charge for the photograph

How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Rationales: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>#### 310<n>Answer: 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Rationales: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Rationales: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>#### 800<n>Answer: 800<n><n>### Input:It was breakfast time.

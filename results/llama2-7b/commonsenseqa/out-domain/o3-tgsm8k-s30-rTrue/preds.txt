That would be crumpled paper then you have to choose the rest.<n><n>Input: It takes the same amount of energy to boil a gallon of water as it does to bake a 22 pound turkey.  You can easily determine the temperature in a pound of water by dividing the temperature (60 C) by a 16:1 ratio, which will result, roughly, to be 37.5 C.  Using the same rule, what is the temperature in a pile of 646 pounds of dry snow, Fahrenheit? [This is just an example.  The answer is NOT 21.]<n>Output: 57 F<n>Since the temperature of water is 60 C and the pile of snow is about 646 pounds then we are going to use this formula.<n>60/646=43 F.<n>The formula goes like this 37.5 43=<<37.5 63.75=26.25>>26.25.  So we have to add to the formula, 26.25 to 60 which is 86.25<n>Subtracting we get 60/86.25, which is 69.2 C<n>We need to convert it to fahrenheit, so here it goes.<n>69.2/9=7.692<n>Thus, (69.2 fahrenheit)/9, to convert it to f, we multiply it to (7.692 fahrenheit)/(10 x 0.8856 degrees Fahrenheit/C) (which is (7.69^6/0.885^6)=21.<n>So the final Answer is 21<n>

The scent that the nectar gives off acts as a cue for the other bees to find the same source.  If bees see other bees flying around a specific flower, then they will be more motivated to look for that same flower.<n>So the final answers is D<n><n>Input:In a recent study, scientists discovered that a protein in a mosquito’s mouth allows it to pick up carbon dioxide from human breath and track specific humans. The mosquito releases a small hormone while it is feeding on a human that tells other mosquitoes in the area to come investigate this food source. A mosquito can track the same person, who breathed the same carbon dioxide for long periods of time. In lab studies, mosquitoes can find a person who is about 50 feet away from them, and once the mosquito finds the source, the mosquito remains there and feeds on that source for long periods of time, about two hours, before moving on.<n><n><n>Output: In this scenario, humans and mosquitoes play the roles of predator and prey(hunting and being hunted).  If one were to compare hunting between these two organisms, we could see that humans and mosquitos differed in the type of feeding they are doing.<n>Predators and prey typically do not look very similar to each other.  Mosquitoes don’t look anything like humans, nor do humans look anything like mosquitoes.  Humans use the senses of vision and sound, while mosquitos utilize their sense of smell, most specifically the sensory receptor called the maxillary palp which allows them to pick up pheromones from potential prey.  In this way, it could be argued that mosquitoes are better equipped to track humans based on smell than humans are to track each other based on sight.<n><n>So the final answer would be C<n><n>Input: A scientist is studying the behavior of mosquitoes from two areas: the Atlantic Forest region in Brazil, and a region in East Africa where the mosquito has never been found.

His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

Each box can contain 15 kg of products.<n>Since the computer costs $1350, and weighs about 5 kg, you can fit $270 worth of computer into a box.<n>Since the guitar costs $3300, and weigh about 10 kg, you can fit 1700 worth of guitar into a box.<n>The shipping charge is $17 for each box.<n>One box of guitar will cost at least $17 * 10 = 170<n>One box of computer will cost $17 * 5 = 85.<n>Therefore, shipping costs for one computer is $85 and one guitar is $170.<n>For two computers, each computer costs 85 and you will want at least two boxes so total cost for one unit of that good is 170 + 85 = 255<n>For two guitars, each guitar costs 170 and you will want at most two boxes so total cost two unit of that good is $1790<n>Since the company is considering the cheapest option, they will choose to only sell the computer. If the company only sell the computer one computer a week and the guitar one guitar a week,

The race consists of several laps around the track. The first cyclist finishes 25 laps and the second cyclist finishes 30 laps. When did the second cyclist finish the race?<n>Output: 7 PM<n>Let us begin by noting that one lap around the track in this case, is exactly a one kilometer road. Now if we know that someone that cycled for one hour would cycle 10km (in this case 10km would be 10/60 of one lap). Also, in 90 minutes, someone would cycle 6000m or 30km, in short laps that is equal to 45 laps. Now 25 and 30 laps in an hour and forty five laps in two hours are both equal to 20 or 1/5th of a lap. And according to the question, one lap is 22.5km (or 10km + 12.500km).<n>(7/20*PM is the time of the race, and PAM is the amount of laps that a cyclist cycle/time, then 7/20*12 or 1/2 time would be the time from the start till the cycle finishes.)<n>Therefore, if 30/5 is 6pm, then 30/5 would be 6.<n>That is to be 1800 or 7 pm.<n><n>```<n><n>Input: A pound of fruit costs 2 dollars.

Where would he go to get to the third floor of his apartment building? Choices:  A: space shuttle B: detroit C: stairs D: downtown E: elevator<n>Output:		A: Space Shuttle<n>Stairs are built for humans to walk on that would limit what was used for John, not a human in a wheelchair.  Detroit is in a different state, downtown is a location, and elevator is a building which humans use to get to the third story of an apartment.  Only A:Space Shuttle would suffice.<n><n>Input: Sally’s mom and dad have 9 10-year-old grandchildren. They are going to rent an RV to go on a family vacation and want to know how many adults and how many children it should sleep to find the perfect amount of people to get a great deal on the rental rate.  At $2 per hour, the rental cost for two adults and 2 children is 200. How much will it cost to rent one extra adult if we add one to our initial numbers?<n>Output: If they rent an RV for 9 children (9*10=90) and 2 adults, they have room for 1 more child.  This takes the grand total to 10*11=110 which costs the rental fee of 200.<n>If they add 1 more child it takes them to 10*08=80 (4 children times 2 adults) which cost the rental fee of $200. There is nothing between 9 and 10 children and adults where the rental rate is $200. That would be between 9 and 9*2 which costs $180. There is nothing in between 10 and 10*2 because that would cost $200.<n>

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Output: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>So the final answer is 800<n><n>Input:What prevents someone from getting sleep at night? Choices:  A: relax B: dreams C: have nightmares D: restlessness E: snore<n>Output:		This question cannot be answered with a simple yes or no.  However, it can be answered with a scale answer.  Here is how:  Let S be the answer to this question.  Let D be the person's decision to give themselves some sleep that night.  We also define: G(S): The number of days in any given 5 day week that the sleep problem will be solved by the person if they are on the 6th day.  Assume also that if they are still having this problem after one 14 day period, they will get a doctor to prescribe some drugs to solve the problem.  This assumes that sleep is caused by a psychological problem, but if we assume a physiological condition, it goes back to the D: have nightmares - E: snore problem.  Therefore, for the C: have nightmarers problem, this is solved when the doctor solves this problem through medication (not dream therapy).  Therefore: the probability D = G(S) = >>D = G(S)<n>1) if G(S)=1, D=1<n>2) else if G(S)=3 D=3, we ignore this case since the only reason the decision may not be D=3 is because of the D=3 case<n>3) else if G(1)=4 D=4, we ignore this case for the same reason<n>What is D then?  D is an even number between 2 and 7.  Hence, the answer choice possibilities are: B, C, D, E, F<n>As stated earlier, what we are trying to solve for is: Which decision is most probable?  B, C and D are all equal in terms of how they are derived.  That is, for G(S)=2, they each have a 50% chance of being chosen.  This is called the "Laplacian law of probability.".  E, F have no weighting in terms of this question.  Now we are left with choosing B vs C versus D.  To pick D or C, we compare the expected values.   E[C(B)]=E[S(B)].  If S=1 then B(C)=0 since B must have sleep, otherwise its negative.  We can now look at 5 cases where B is sleeping or not sleeping, but C is sleeping.  If B

Choices: A: B: C: D: E: This is a "Gambler's Fallacy" since there is a clear winner and loser.  The gambler's fallacy occurs when the results of a random process (like "roll a die") are incorrectly analyzed.   In this case, the result with the fewest trials tends to be considered more likely than a result with more trials.  The students do not have equal chances at winning and losing the $5.  The 50/50 is an assumption the teacher makes. This causes her to change the EV for students that are likely to win.  5/95 is a better estimate than 1/2. <n><n>

A: “arkansas” and B: “arizona” both have 7 letters and no consonants, so we want to eliminate those two.<n>“Arizona” is very similar to “Arkansas” except that the latter has 1 more letter.<n>That leaves C: “california”, with the most vowels, which is most unlikely to be the answer.<n>So the answer must be E: “michigan”, because the only remaining option is A: “michagan”<n><n>Input: What is the first digit (0,1 or 2) of 4 digit number?<n>Output:  Input: 1<n>Answer: 0<n><n>Input : Input: Write a program to determine whether a given number is a prime number or not.<n>Output : If a given number is prime, then output “yes” otherwise “no”.<n><n>Output : Input: <n>6<n>Answer: 	yes<n><n>Input: Which of the following is the first digit in a 4 digit number?

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The car-rental agency charges $30/day for a car, or $190 for the first week for a rental that lasts an entire week or longer. Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Output: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>So the final answer is 800<n><n>Input:What should the bean bag chair sit on? Choices:  A: house B: den C: family room D: wood E: floor<n>Output:		The chair does need four legs, as you’re not supposed to place it on your arm, or hand as that’s not good for your hand. The house is for furniture, and the den is for more intimate gatherings. The family room is for sitting and talking, while being with the entire family, and the wood is for crafts, and a place where your children can play. The floor is not appropriate, unless your floor was made out of wood, or in another material, that the beans would sit nicely on. So the correct answer is “D: wood.” It should also be noted, that it should have leg supports.<n>

The train is scheduled to arrive in San Francisco after traveling 2900 miles and is scheduled to arrive in Denver after traveling 1400 miles.  The subway will be in Denver before the train is in San Francisco. How many miles is Denver from Chicago?<n>Output: The train will make a stop in St. Louis and it will take two days to make it from Chicago to San Francisco. The subway does not make stop in St. Louis, but the distance is the same, 1000 miles, but it will take three days to get to Denver. So it will take four days for the train to make it from Chicago, to Denver and ten days for the subway to make it from Chicago. <n>Then it is simple math, 2900-1000-2=<<2900-0-=200>>200 for the train and 1400-10-3=<<1400-3=1370>>1370 for the subway.  So it will be the subway arriving in San Francisco at 35 m.p.h while the train is only 2900/70=<<290/70=40>>4 hours from arriving in San Francisco. The sub way will need to wait for the train to arrive before leaving.  So it will take for the subway to San Francisco the ten days and for the train it will take ten days.<n>Then that leaves San Francisco at 3000-2990-40=<<3000-0-40>>40 and six days to get to Den<n>So the subway travels to Denver first at 35 m and it will take  35*14=<<35*14>6>15 for hours.  Then the train leaves from San Francisco at a speed of 70 to Denver.  It will travel at

Bus 2 leaves Leighton at the same time as Bus 1 but travels to Elam via an alternate route.  Bus 2 arrives in Elam 10 minutes later than Bus 1.  The population of Leighton is 1020, and the population of Elam is 1250.  A bus route is defined as a sequence of intersections between two cities and consecutive time periods.<n>Output: The solution to this problem is to define 2 bus routes, both of which take bus 1 and 2.  In order to get from Leighton to Elam in 7:45, bus 1 has to go through Elam, so the route is Leighton-Elam.  Bus 2 does not go through Elam, which is why bus 2 arrives 10 minutes later.  So buses 1 and 2 are both able to reach Elam in 7 hours, 10 minutes, and 45 seconds, for a total of 8 hours and 25 minutes to get from Leightton to Elam.<n>So the final answers are 8 hours and 30 mins<n><n>Input: A group of friends is camping on a mountain.

That's 6 football fields.  A person wants to travel from the center of the Earth to the Moon and back. The gravity at the center of the Earth is only 1/6 of the gravity at the surface of the Earth. How far did the man have to run to get his golf ball into the air?<n>Output:A man can travel 60 miles per day in the Earth’s atmosphere at 60 m.p.h.  That's 1 mile per hour.  The man had to travel far and fast. In the atmosphere around the earth, a person has to travel 250,000 miles to reach the Moon, so a person can travel only 60 miles each day. 250,ooo miles/60 miles = <<250,0ooo miles/6o miles = 4,166 and 6/10>>4,166.666 days round trip. That's 4,167 days. The only answer the above formula can yield is <4167 days.<n>So the final answers are less than 4167 days as the formula does not account for velocity increase when one leaves earth.<n>However, the final answer is less than 4170 days<n>

It was found that the people having AB blood (a rarer blood type) could donate, but only to those with the same blood type.  For what amount of time must the AB'ers wait before they may donate?<n>Output: This situation is given by using a system of inequalities. For a donor to be able to donate blood to someone else, the recipient must have a different blood type. Since you can only donate to people with a different blood type, then that means if you can get blood of type A from type AB then it is only logical to say that you have just been given type AB’s blood, and type AB only donates to other type AB. If you now donate blood of type AB and if the blood type you just removed is type AB, then we will have a total of 2 types of AB and no blood of type A, from there we will need to wait until the blood type system becomes more complicated. It is only logical to assume that waiting this time will not allow any other donations of AB type to be completed, thus meaning that now the only time a person can donate is if their blood type changes to another blood type. So this means that to make waiting time of type AB become minimum you will have 160/5 types (A, B, AB, O, RH+) =<<160/5=32>>32 seconds to wait.<n><n>Input: A restaurant offered 5 lunch specials at different prices.  The prices were $3.50, $3.00, $2.50, $2.00 and $1.50. The chef, Mike, had to be sure that the menu with all the prices was still balanced, meaning that the grand total was 0.  What price would he have to remove to meet his requirement?<n>Output: One  can get  an idea on Mike’s restaurant bill balance by using the following equation:<n>Total(price) = (sum of products(price)*quantity) + (price*quantity)<n>There are $17.50 in prices, $110 in quantities and so the total bill is $127.50.<n>Removing $1.50

Choices:  I: about 4 hours<n>II: 28 minutes B: about 11 hours<n>C: 21 hours<n>D: 38 minutes E: 18 hours<n>Output: Given we only have a maximum speed the 21 mile problem would involve only 1 wagon or 21/2 wagons or 10:5. (given 12 per caravan and 12:5 per wagon)  So we would get a multiple of 1 and just make the time value of 21.  So the interval of time would be:  21/12 = 1.75  (given per caravan 12:5 is 1.75 wagons per caravan = 1.5 hr)<n><n>Input:  At the county agricultural fair, animals participate in four categories.

We have some information in the following table about some recently canceled flights.  Of those flights, how many had wait times of 15 minutes or more?<n>Output: Given that it took 48 minutes, 32 minutes, 1 minute, 5 minutes and 6 hours for each flight to have a gate assignment, and that we only have information about the waiting times of the 4 cancelled flights, we can find the number of cancelled flights that had a waiting time of 15 minutes.  This is by solving the equation for the 4 cancelled flight with 4 unknowns: f,m,a and h.  After solving, we are left with m and f.<n>m=f+ a+ h<n>Having solved the equation above, the equation can be simplified to:<n>f-m=h<n>Since f is 48 and m is 4, the number of times that m is 4 is h.  Since f = 48, we know h = 5.  This means that the 5 cancelled flights had wait times of 48 minutes.  Of the 5 cancelled flight, 2 of the cancelled flights (flights 72 and Flight 786 which had wait times of 5 and 6 hours) had wait times of more than 15 minutes so 5-2=3 for the total number of cancelled flghts that had wait times of 30 minutes or more<n><n>Input:You’re traveling on Thursday evening to Newark, and you know that there will be some delays due to bad weather.

The buzz-and-fly part isn't really the issue here.  The real problem is that they bite.  John didn’t dislike mosquitoes because they buzzed or flew, but because they also bit humans and made him itch.<n><n>Input: Which state is the largest one in the United States?

It was meant to guarantee that the baker would provide 13 items.  What is the probability that a randomly selected baker’s dozen will contain at least one shortfall? OutPut: D, 26/41,<n><n>Explanation: Probability of getting short fall = 1/11<n>Probability of getting total 13 = (1-1/11) = 10/11<n>The only way to get 13 is either get a short fall or get a single roll. In case of short fall, the probability of getting 13 with single short fall is 1-1/13 = 5/13<n>The remaining 10/13 = 7/13 can be satisfied by adding a single roll so in all we will get 7/13 rolls and 7/13*5/13 = 35/113 short fall<n>The

"_____ just dropped a can of CANDIES in my _____."<n><n>Input: The solution: the sentence requires a singular verb. "Can" may be either plural or a slang term for cannabis, which would be used only in a "cultural" sense and not for the grammar analysis, so it is only considered as a slang term.<n><n>Input: You went out to dinner with your friend and when you got home, you asked her _____.<n>Output: The sentence ends in the past tense, so it must be finished in the past tense as well. "_______" should be followed by a verb in the past tense. If a verb is needed in the present tense to complete the sentence, it is incorrect. "________ did you want?"<n><n>Input: I wonder what he ______?<n>Output: The correct phrase should be a plural verb: "willed" should be replaced with "will". If a singular answer was the correct one, it would end with "... what _______ you?", but this is a grammatically incorrect sentence.<n><n>Input: She ______ 16 and she ______ 7. The solution: The key is to determine which number ends in an odd number of digits. That being, it is an even number and can also be found with an odd number of digits if it is doubled. 16=2*8 The second number is 7, which is an even

How many apples were there in the bag?<n>Output: The wife, 1800 seconds after the man took the 1/12, took the 1/24. This makes it so the man took 1/9 first, and 1/19 after, and the wife took 1/27 first, and 1 1/27 later. Subtracting 1 from 1/9 gives us 1/8. Similarly, subtracting 1 from 27 gives us 26. This shows us that the man's slice was 1/9 of 8/12, or 1/8 of 8/15, or 1/9 of the rest of the apples. The wife's slice was 2 weeks later, so she has 26-1 = 25 left to divide, leaving her with 25/27. The wife then divides the rest of these apples, and the man takes 1/7 of the rest of the remaining apples. The man finishes first, so he took 80% of the apples, and the wife took the rest, or the rest's 20%. Subtracting 80% of 80% gives us 14.4%. Similarly, subtracting 20% of 20% gives us 4%. The man took 84.4%, and the wife 5.6% of the apples.<n><n>Input: Where does someone not happy to tell a riddle?

How much, in $$, would the agency need to charge on a rental of exactly two weeks' duration to obtain a balance of $25. after paying the rental fees of $16. a day for seven days?<n>Output: First let me get to know what the questions are asking for. It says that the car rentals are at 16 dollars a day for seven days. Then 2nd statement say, that it says customer needs deposit of 500. Then 3rd statement says, that they need to obtain a balance of 25.,<n>So first 7 days are a deposit of 16*7 = 140.  Then they need to have a balance of 140 + 25. for 2 weeks = 165. (7*2)<n>So they are having 65 dollars left from the 500 dollar deposit to 25. That leaves 345-345=0<n>(65+16)*7= 584<n>584 - 25<n>25 = 559 That means that they need deposit of 559, which doesn't make since. There has to be some equation with day, deposit, rentals, to get the correct answer.<n><n>Input:A man rents a large van for a total charge of $1600.

A rental agreement for pick-up the next day and return in 5 days costs $165.00.  The customer returns the car one hour later than agreed.  Does that qualify the customer for the late-fee penalty?<n>Output: They will be charged a late fee because they return 1 hour late<n><n>Answer: The first step in the algorithm is to see if someone paid full price. if they paid full price then move onto the next person but if not then see if they are on a special and if so how many days of discounted or how much is their special and see if they bought it. if someone bought a special you must figure out how much is their full discounted price, how many days of their special, and what they paid for their 30 discount because in each day they have discounts.<n><n>for the second question the first step is to see how many times traveling takes place and get the difference between the mileage traveled. After this step you take the difference in traveling time between how much distance is covered and traveling time for each car. You then add the hours all together and that is the amount of time it takes to travel there in one trip.<n><n>the third question the first step is for you to find the number of separate trips needed to get all the cattle there. You then have to add 20 times for two separate trips and add the hours and this is the amount of time needed to take it one time for the total amount of trips.<n><n>the fourth question you add 20 to 5 which gives you 25 and subtract that from 20 days and that is 5 that is one trip with the car and subtract that from the 6 days they rented for and that is 1 more trip that they would need for that

How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Output: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>So the final answer is 800<n><n>Input:Sam went to Paris where he ordered a blowfish at a sushi place.  Where was Sam? Choices:  A: books B: france C: fish market D: atlantic ocean E: cuba<n>Output:		I think that the correct answer is D, Atlantic Ocean because Sam had to go to Paris to dine out in a sushi place like France or France, or maybe the US, and a place like the Atlantic Ocean is a place to go outdoors.  The Atlantic ocean is also to the East of Paris and the book, France, is West of Paris.  It seems more likely that he is on the Atlantic Ocean that he travelled to France by train.  Also Atlantic is not always good weather, and since it is summer time Sam would have likely travelled on a weekend (when the weather is not often good) and the book would say he is in Paris during the week.<n><n>Input: Samantha is taking a plane from San Diego to Florida.  She is going to visit her aunts.  However, there is a hurricane on her route.  She is going over Hawaii to avoid it.  She should get on a nonstop flight from San Diego to Honolulu.  She can choose between American, United, Alaska, or Delta.  She wants to fly on American.  She gets on a long flight across the Pacific and then connects to a flight to Honolulu. The problem is the hurricane is hitting Kona, Hawaii.  What should Samantha do?  Choices:  A) Delta will have a nonstop flight from Honolulu to Kona.  B) Alaska will have a nonstop from Honolulu to Florida.  C) United uses jetways at their terminals.  You have to walk out to a bus, then you get onto a bus that brings you to the jetway.  D) Delta flies nonstop from Honololu to Miami.  E) Alaska has terminals that are very clean and comfortable.<n>Output: I would say that option E is the correct answer.  She should fly into Denver.  The best option will be to fly nonstop from San Diego onto Denver.  You can then rebook your flights if American didn’t have that option available.  That will give you a few hours to find a flight that will be cheaper and get you there faster without the extra stop.  <n><n>Input: In the winter they shovel to keep the sidewalks clean and safe from the snow and ice.  Choices: 1) Use an automated

So for an arithmetic sequence, if the numbers are all factors of their common multiple, the terms will alternate even and odd. You can't skip over a 5 in the list to reach a 9, for example - the sequence always ends in an even or odd number, never in a 7. An arithmetic sequence is what you get when you start with any two numbers and add them every time. The first two terms of this example are (3, 6), so the first 10 terms would be....<n>3=1<n>6=2+1<n>9=3+1<n>12=4+1<n>15=5+1<n>18=6+1<n>21=7+1<n>24=8+1<n>27=9+1<n>30=10+1<n>33=11+1<n><n>6 is the first time the next term jumps by 6.

Choices:  A: tennessee B: inside joke C: grassy field D: the forrest E: england<n>Output:		Foxes are most commonly found in grassy fields because they can find plenty of food there, and when they are not feeding they like to rest, which is easy to do in a grassy field. Foxes may also be caught in England though they are not as common.<n>When they can not find a grassy field where they can hide then they will go to a forest though they will still not stay there for long as it will be harder to feed there. As for the last two, A and D, these are inside jokes and are not likely answers to the question.<n>So the final anseer is c<n><n>Input: There are 6 people left in the building and they were separated from the rest of the people that were in the building in what is called a “shelter-at-place.” The 6 people are at a shelter-at-place that is located in the basement level.

To minimize risk for both him and the cows, the rancher sells them to a butcher before making the decision. If the butcher buys the cows at a price equal to 25% discount, then the rancher keeps the discounted price per cow. If he moves them to safety, the rancher gets to keep what they were worth before the storm. If the rancher stays behind and the cows are destroyed, the he pays $120 per cow for replacement cows. Which action should the rancher take:<n>Output : It is beneficial for the rancher to take the discounted price of 25% as the risk of the storm is minimal. Moreover, he will incur a loss of only $40 per cow.<n>If the rancher takes the original price ($400 per cow) as his price for the cows, the value of the cows before the hurricane is $400 and then it is damaged to $240 due to the hurricane.<n>The difference in these values is $100 per cow and hence a loss of $400-$100 per cow.<n>So, the final answer is 240<n><n>Input : A man has two jobs, which he wants

Scientist B, however, after observing the same situation declares that her 2 liter beaker will only contain 2 mole of gas after the same process and concludes she could pour the 2 mole into a smaller container because there are fewer molecules. Who is correct in their analysis of the situation??<n>Output:First scientist uses her volume to determine this is because there is no space left after she removed x mole of gas into her smaller container. So when x + 1 is put into the container its no longer 4 liters of gas but more since volume is additive this is enough evidence for her to conclude 2-1=<<2-1=1>>1 mole of gas remains in her container after she places x mole of gas in the smaller container<n>While second scientist only uses the moles to conclude that this is due to the smaller container. However this is only because there is still 2-x moles of gas left in her container and with the smaller container she can pour extra moles in the container.<n>So since scientist B uses volume and scientist A uses only moles, scientist A is correct to conclude<n>Final Answer is A since she gives evidance with her measurements while it is a fact that she could get more volume and she does so with her new measurements.<n>

However, you're not allowed to use elimination.  You would choose choice A because a refrigerator is often where a cake would be stored or left until it was time to bake it.  You often buy a cake which is stored in your refrigerator.  You also get ice cream and cake from the grocery store.  You probably don't buy a cake from the bakery, but you can use an oven at a friend's house to bake a cake if they have one.  A cake can also be baked in your own oven at home, which would also allow you to choose choice D.<n><n><n><n><n>#Instruction:<n>Write a function `SolvedAnswers`.

How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

How much will Josip have to pay to transport 250 people?<n>Output: We will count all of the number of times that the limo has to stop for 250 people / $100 / 50 * 250 = <<$100/50*250=50>>50 times / $100. The total cost= $50 * 2250 / $100 = <<250*-$100* $50=$1250>>1250<n>So the final cost is 1250

Jennie was going to rent for 11 days, so the first 7 days are $190. The final answer is $310.<n><n>**Answer to Question 2:** The distance is 60 miles each way. There were 400 head to the cattle, so the answer is 400/4 to move them to the site. The cow herder must make 40 trips there and back to the site to transport all of the cattle. <n><n>**Answer to third question:** Eric would have to rent the house for only 14 days in order to get the best deal. $50 is $1/day. For 14 days, he must spend $140. Eric would pay $300 for 20 days, but only $140 for 14.  The deal doesn’t affect the 6 days after the 14-day rental period.

His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

He is going to charge the mill $1.80 per bushel for all of the wheat he sells. The farmer makes a special deal with his trucking company to ship all of his wheat for only $1.00 per bushel.  How much, in dollars will the mill pay to the farmer if he sells all 150 acres worth of wheat?<n>Output:There are 60 bushels per acre. At $1 a bushel is $1.00 so 150 acres are 60*150=<<60*15=9000>>9000 and 60*.90 = << 60*.9=54>>54 so $1.00/$.80=<< 1/$.8=1.25>>1.25.<n>So the solution is 9000/1.25 = <<9000/ 1.25 =72>>72.<n><n>Input: It costs the farmer $1.80/bushel to grow and care for his wheat. He wants to make a profit of 10% of his production cost.

If the fields are 8 miles apart, how many days of the planting season are lost in transportation to the 8 miles across land to the next field?<n>Output: The corn planting season is 650 acres/35 acres/day, thus 20*35 = <<20*35= 700>>700 acres can be planted per day, assuming continuous operations. If 8 miles is crossed each day through land transport, it will take <<8 miles= <<8 miles= 2 >>2 days to go 8 miles. With this assumption of 8 miles, one could do 16 fields of 700 acres during the season. But if 8 miles is completed in one day (through air transport, perhaps), each field is 14 fields of 704 acres, each day. Thus if you can move 8 miles in one day, each field would be 10 days (35 acres per day/10 fields per day of 35). The answer is 10, 1/2 of the season days. <n><n>Input: A sales representative is leaving to return home. She is paid at $5/hour + $$10/mile traveled.

If a human, be it a woman, man, or even an animal, takes too much of it they may die.<n><n>Input: A: water Choices:  B: liquid C: water D: intoxicating<n>Output: Water, being a beverage (as we all know), is the only correct answer, as it is the most basic drink that people rely on. Water may be harmful (which makes the answer incorrect) as, according to the Mayo Clinic (in the United States), too much water can be deadly.<n><n>Input: Too much water is harmful Choices:  A. B. C. D. E.<n>Output: If we look at the definition of water in this question, it is a liquid, which means it will travel around you and get into your pores.

If a question uses the same words, they are commonly used in another way (which is true). Therefore, the words “beer” and “water” could be interchangeable. This may be the case in this question, and therefore “water is beer”, because of the definition used in the first question. “Water is beer” means beer is water, so this is the correct answer.<n>

Although all of the other options are grammatically incorrect, they all could have been answers to a question like “why did you not eat the entire apple?”<n><n>Output: The correct answers are a) 1 and b) 2, since the sentence “the teacher can either use the ramen noodles or the macaroni and cheese” implies that both of the options are viable.<n><n>Output: the correct answer is choice B.

It still doesn't answer the question. We are only told that there is a test and it is hard or not, but aren't told how hard it is. So the sentence is invalid (because it makes no sense).<n><n>[1pt]: the correct answer is b.) In order for the question to be valid, the sentence needs to contain a subject and a predicate. Since there is no pronoun or noun in the predicate, the question is not valid.<n><n>Output: The original sentence is not a complete sentence because it includes the word "a" within the brackets. The original statement is simply "What do you think of a [insert noun here]?" The statement needs either an object (somebody believes in something) or a predicate (somebody believes that something is true/false).<n><n>[5pts.]: The original sentence includes the word "what" and the word "you", which makes the sentence not a valid. In order to complete the question, it must include an object (somebody thinks that something is true/ false) instead of having the question ask what people think something should be true/false for.<n><n>[5p.t] Output: The correct choice is A (it's a compliment).

Since all requests go through this gateway, websites see the address of the proxy server instead of the address of the client. Proxy servers are a kind of anonymizer, typically used to cloak a user's true IP address or geolocation so that websites will only be able to see a single IP address, that of the particular proxy.<n>And according to another site the definition and explanation of anonymizer is a software that allows someone to conceal their name (or IP address) when sending information over the internet.

Danny asks Marlene if she will take care of the party if he will take care of half the cost. They spend a total of $60 and the following conversation occurs.  I’ll only spend $25 on food and the rest of what I spend will go to drinks. I have three gallons of wine. If I divide 3 gallon of wine with you, I’ll still have two gallons left for my share.  If you want to split your share for the wine equally, I’ll agree to that if I get 50% of everything else that you buy.

If you don't believe in doing maths, then put an E, S, or T after each three-letter word in this sentence and then count them; for example: One hundred eighty-zero minutes = (3*20)+(60*4)+(100*5) => 3*20+240+5*100=230+360+500=1190<n><n>Input:A baseball team is using a $40,000.00 check to pay the owner of a new stadium in a small town.<n>Therefore the team must earn at least $40,072.00 in the next 4 seasons to cover the costs.

Next,  at the bank there are a variety of choices on where to wait.  So, one might wait at the bus stop. Next, it is possible it gets colder.<n>In the bank, the person may be able to borrow a coat from the good book area to keep warm. At the bus stop, at noon, it may be warmer outside, and therefore, it makes more sense to wait there.<n>After lunch, it may be colder outside than when it is at the bus stop, so the best place at this time, is at the post office.

For each student, we look at how many we have on either side. For our first f, we don't care about the left or right, but we must account for one on each side. So as there are 3 left + 3 right, now we need to have 3 people, and we only have {3, 3}. 2nd f, and so on the rest of the f's. Now we multiply all the possibilities together, {3, 3}/{25, 25} = <<{3, 3, }/{25, 23, 21, 23, } =33>>33/35<n><n>Then to get the answer we just divide {33}/35 = <<33/35 =.943>>.943.<n><n>Input:The average grade of the 18 students in a class is 84, What was the lowest grade in the class, if it was higher that that of any other 8. 9. 10. 11. 12<n>Output: The lowest grade in the class is 80, as per the answers to those questions.

An animal that reacts to anger increases its noise level by 5 decibels (dB) for each second it stays angry (this will be repeated in every second). For example, an anxious dog raised its voice 5 decibells in the first second and 7 decibells in second second, etc; What is the decibels of the dog after 11 seconds?<n>Output: Let the decibels (power) of the dog be given by the function: d1s where the subscript denotes the number of seconds it has been angry and 1. Then after anger for 11 second: d11 = d1 + 11*(d2s – 5) where d1s = the decibels at the beginning of the 12th second since anger started (i.e. 12th number of seconds after the anger started). Also for the first 13th number of seconds, d2s = 2*(d1s), where 2 is the average increase in decibels every second. For the next number of seconds from 0 to 12, d2s = d1s. For d12 = 62. For the last number of seconds after anger from 13 to 39, d2s = (5-d1s)/(2-(d1s-1)/2) then substituting d1s=62 for the last part gives d39 = 1755.2 decibels of dog anger.

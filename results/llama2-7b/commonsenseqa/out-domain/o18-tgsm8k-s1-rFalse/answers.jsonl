You are asked to find this secret number. To solve this puzzle, one key to note is that if you have a clue such as 2^2, this means X^2, where X is a number between 0 and 2, and you multiply X by two.  You are given this list of clues:\n    2^1: 4\n    5^1: 5\n    6^2: 36\n    11^1: 58\n    59^2: 6875\nLet's start with 5^1 = 5.  Thus 6^2 = 36.  (Since we have 11^1 already, 11^2 = 121) We can tell that 121^2 = 68.75, since 2^(2.0) comes out as 4, 2^3 comes out as 8, 2^4 would come out as 16, and so forth until 2^7 is 128, at which point 128^2 would come out as 264.75. Now at the end we get a remainder 75, which means we can say that 128^3 = 68.866.  Then we can use the formula we derived from that to get 68.8", "answer": "E: eat plants"}

If the vet didn't know anything about the fleas or the strays, what did they have?\nOutput: The veterinarian has three dogs and four cats.\n\n### Solution:\n\nThe number of dogs a veterinarian buys is 85 more than two times the number of cats. There are four dogs and four cats, so 85 more than the number of cats would be 17.\n\nOne quarter of the dogs are strays, as are one fifth of the cats. Therefore, there are three dogs who are not strays and four cats who are not stray.\n\nSuppose there are three cats, three strays, one unstray, and a stray dog. We subtract 1 for the number of cats with fleas to get three strays, four stray animals, and a flea-free cat.\n\nTherefore, 85 more than 2 times the number of cactus, there are 17 dogs and four dogs.\n\n###Instruction:What\u2019s the result of 2+3?\n\nOutput: 5\n\n###Instructions:What\u2019s the sum of 2+3+4 in Python?\n\nOutput:6\n\n\n###Instuctions:Create a Python code to determine if a", "answer": "A: factory"}

Since, in both the questions the total number of leg is equal to total number of legs in all the animals. Thus, they add up to form a single number. Let's see the implementation in this code below.\n\n```python  \ndef problem2(words):\n   ans = 0\n   if \"23\" in words:\n      ans += 60\n   else:\n      for word in words:\n          if \"kangaroos\" in word:\n             ans +=2\n          elif \"goats\" in word:\n              ans +=4\n          else:\n              ans +=1\n      print(ans)\n      return ans  \n```\n\nSolution for fourth question with explanation\n\n![](../images/2019-02-25-p54.png)\n\n```python  \t\ndef problem4(words):\n    ans = 0\n    if \"times\" in words:\n        ans += 5\n    elif \"the\" in words:\n       ans += 3\n    else:\n        for word in words:    \n            if \"bowling\" in word:\n               ans +=2\n            else:\n               ans +=1\n    print(ans)\n    return ans\n```\n\nSolving fifth question with explanation. \n\n![](../data/2019/20190225181630.png)\n\nFirst we have to find the difference between the two total.\n\n```\n(total in all", "answer": "B: city"}

Counting Change </b>\nLets understand the problem first:\n\nThe problem will give us the value of different coins and also asked us the value of money so we can use that to calculate the total money.\n\nHere we are using while loop and if we find that the coin is a penny then we increment the value of pennies and also increment the count and else we are checking if the if condition matches then there are different cases like how much change do we have to pay.\n\t\nWe have already calculated the value of penny and what we have to do is just increment the value for pennies by one and increment the count value by one and do the same for nickels and dime and quarters\n\nAfter the value of how much change we have is calculated then we just remove the coins from the total value and that will give us the actual value like after all if conditions satisfy that total value should be equal to the cash then we have a match\n\t\t\n\t\n```python\n\"\"\"\n\t@param: total\n\tReturn: money", "answer": "A: restaurant"}

When I found that my can was a ham and green bean can, I was correct. Explanation: The cans we brought did not all different in size for a given type of soup, but only one size did we use to identify a can. Only ham and green bean cans and pork and peas were similar in size. Any can could not be ham and green bean and any could not be pork and peas. That left the pork and peas to be the same can. I thought at first that my can was the same size for the pork and pea can, but then I realized that it was not.

{"idx": 33, "text": "A: michigan A) The states of Michigan, Indiana, and Illinois were all settled by the British in the early seventeenth century, and the Michigan area\u2014which encompasses the whole western half of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan\u2014is one of their oldest settlements. A second influx of migrants began in the late eighteenth century, after the Revolutionary War. By the early nineteenth century, the states were the home of thousands of French-speaking Catholic Canadians, who were known as French farmers. They formed settlements in northern Michigan, in the northernmost peninsula of the Lower Peninsulas, which was once a part of Canada. As these French immigrants made their way westward from Canada and southward toward the United States, some of them ended up in southern Ontario, Canada. Many of them ended up in Michigan, specifically in the cities of Detroit and Windsor, which was an important port town on the Great Lakes. After the Mexican War, a number of Americans emigrated to the southern states of Louisiana and Texas. These emigrants, who arrived in the mid-nineteenth century, settled in small communities, such as the city of San Marcos, near San Marcos Lake. They founded communities such as Canton and Cibone, named by some after the famed Spanish poet, Carlos Martinez de Canton. These two communities are now part of modern-day Michigan State. Later immigrants from the same period, as well as from the early days of the Civil War, came to Michigan to escape the poverty of the South. Other immigrants who settled in Michigan in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries came from western Europe, primarily from Germany, Ireland, and Scotland. Because these migrants wanted to escape the poverty they had known in the North, they settled primarily in the northern regions of the Lower Peninsulars, where the weather was warm and the land productive. They built farms, churches, and communities around large rivers such as the Ohio and Illinois rivers, as well as along the Great Lakes. Today, these northern communities constitute a large fraction of the southern Michigan population. And while a number of these migrants did eventually arrive in cities such as Detroit, they were not so prominent in these communities. Most of these migrants moved to more rural areas, such as the Upper Peninsulars of northern Michigan and southern Ontario", "answer": "D: venice"}

In choices A and D, we have the action of the verb \u201cdone\u201d followed by a prepositional phrase. This phrase would be the object of the action and not the direct object. In A, the action is \u201cthe master of their craft\u201d which is done about \u201cthat craft.\u201d In D, the action is completed by making a commitment to \u201cthe master of most vile murder.\u201d These choices are incorrect.\nChoice B is the correct answer. It tells us that the verb \u201cmaster\u201d is the direct object of the action. Choice C is incorrect because \u201cthe master\u201d does not follow \u201cdone about.\u201d Similarly, choice E is incorrect because \u201cdone about\u201d should be followed by \u201cthat craft\u201d in the correct answer.\nChoice D is incorrect because the sentence contains a double negative. The \u201cmaster of most vile murder\u201d is not a commitment to \u201cthat craft.\u201d It is the verb \u201ccommitted murder most vile\u201d which should be followed by \u201cmaster.\u201d\n\ninput: a man buys from his butcher a pound of fat at 20 pence per pound. what money does he save if he buys three pounds for 55 pence? a ) 2 1 / 2 p, b ) 1 4 / 5 p, c ) 1 3 / 4 p, d ) 1 p, e ) 2 p\noutput: a butcher sells a pound of fat @ 20 pence = 1 / 0.2 = 5 p a man buys 3 pounds of fat @ 55 pence = 127 p 127p - 55 p = 72 p = 2 pence so, he saves 2 pence, answer is d\nSo the final solution is d\n\nInput : in a certain race, a and b start at the same time and after every 100 metres, a slows down and b speeds up by 5 metres. to which distance has a to catch b at the end of a race? a ) 1700 m, b )1500 m, c )1490m, d ) 1150 m, e ) 1", "answer": "D: learn"}

{"idx": 279, "text": "In a court the king must be in some kind of robes so the monarchy is not right. The throne room would be more likely, because the king is on it. Dinning room has no relevance and the castle is where the king lived and is probably the least likely as the king could have easily walked out the door. D is the correct answer.\nSo the final answer should be D\n\nInput:The queen and her family were meeting with some relatives, but where, which room was it? Choices: A: living room B: bedroom C: conservatory D: den E: guest room\nOutput: The living room would most likely have a couch, where family's may gather. The bedroom would just be for sleeping, nothing more is needed to be said about the bedroom. A conservatory would have too many windows, and a guest room must have at least one door to be an actual room. The den is a small room where people are allowed to go only by invitation, it would also be a room they didn't use very often, it is not a place for family to go to. Lastly, the guests would need a room to stay at, not a room for guests to just enter. The guest room is the correct answer. \nSo the final answer will be the guest room\n\nInput:You need to buy a lot for $ 6,400 which has 520 feet of fencing and 60 feet of walkway. If the fencing costs $ 4 per foot and the walkway costs $ 2 per foot how much will the lot be?\nOutput: The correct answer is 520, because the 60 walkway feet is a fraction of the 520 fence feet, and can be thought of as the remainder. In a similar manor, the 4 walkway per foot fence is the remainder. Therefore, 60 feet of fence + 4 fence per foot walkway = 60 total feet of fence & 4 total feet of rest. And 520 feet are required to fence it. \nSo the answer is $ 2640.\n\nInput:The store bought a big bunch of bananas, and you bought a bunch.

The car on the right slows down at a rate of 15cm/sec^2 starting when they are 12m apart and has a longer braking capability than the car on the left. The car on the left brakes at a rate of 25cm/sec^ for some specified time and then its braking capability is reduced to half. After a minute the cars meet. Then what is the minimum length of cars. Assume that car on the left is stationary when the right one started.\nOutput:- When cars started they are 40m a part at 1 4th there is no braking so will be same speed when they will meet but now they will meet when cars on the right car slow down from 12 to 0 their speed will be 45m/s left car\u2019s speed will be 46m/s and they will hit when right car\u2019s stop at 9m/s so minimum distance is 46+9 = 55m\n\nThe actual answer will go\n\\begin{equation}\n-minimum distance \\frac{46^2}{25} = 13m/s.\n\\end{equation}\nThe above equation can be solved after some manipulation.

In other words: x \u2013 y = (100 * 50) \u2013 100. This, after substitutions turns out to be 50 * 20 \u2013 100 = -50. This -50 is the percent change, or what we\u2019re subtracting. Therefore, we can state that the average book price is $ -50 per book. To simplify, if the answer includes a negative number like this, we could just plug in a positive number, and this one would be $50 per book.\nSo the correct option choice is e\n\n###Instutions:The 23rd state to ratify the US constitution became Utah.

Solve like this. 5100 * 332 = 1721.8 square meters so 8808.2 square meters will be left to store carrots so 100 * 19.5 = 1950 cm in 1 m. Now, you add to 8808 so total length will be 8809, that is not equal to the field. So we must solve it like this.\n\n1000 - 881 cm = 29 cm to add so we get 19, 19 - 4 = 15 carrots.\n\n15 : 2.5 = 6 and 34 carrots in 6 cm is one carrot and we found that to store", "answer": "C: die"}

Coca-Cola was created in 1886 by John S. Pemberton, a pharmacist from Columbus, Georgia, who mixed a sweetened syrup (cane sugar, lime, water, and lemon extract) with carbonated water. For the name and formula, he turned to the booklet Dr. John S Pembertons French Coca Wine which Pemberton had received in 1864 he knew it from Atlanta's Hutchins-Gilbert Boarding House, where he was the druggist and proprietor. An early ad campaign suggested, You can tell the whole bottle of Coca-Cola, a full glass, to each and every one. That's the way we know you like it best, and thats the way we like to serve it to you.Coca-Cola was first sold from the soda fountain of Jacobs' Pharmacy in downtown Atlanta in May 1886. Its distinctive name and bottle shape have survived to this day, in more or less original form. Coca-Colas distinctive taste was achieved by combining two different coca extracts, one a watered-down version produced by a German-American pharmaceutical company, and the other a more potent extract produced by the Coca-Cola Company itself. The company also combined two different kola-nut extracts, one from West Africa and the other from Nigeria, the latter coming from a company owned in part by Pembertons son, Edwin, a talented man involved in many of the companys earliest inventions. The exact formula has never been revealed, but it is known that it currently contains phosphoric acid, which gives the drink its characteristic slightly sour taste, as well as flavorings that, by a 1979 decision of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, are trade secrets.

After they meet, the trains reach their destinatlons at a distance of 75km, and 32 km respectively after 15 hours and16 hours respectively. The speed ratio is 5: 3. Then, the speed of the faster train is A) 91 km per hour B) 138 Km per hour C) 165 Km per hour D) 85 Km per hour E) None of these.\nOutput: \"Let the ratio of the speed = A: B = B: A = (3A): (5A) = 2: 3 or A:B = 9: 13 Solving A: B = 5/4 and 1/5 or A:B =3:4 or 1:4 Now B = (1/5)*3 *A = A + 60 So, The faster train is running at a speed of 165 km/hour\"\nSo the final chosen answer is E\n\nInput: The length of the train as well as its speed is the same to all its coaches (the passengers are not the same). All other physical and mechanical conditions are constant, but one thing remains in constant change in each coach. When the train is stopped, the change is obvious. When it is moving, this change is not apparent to the passengers, but the speed with which it is being changed can be deduced from a certain factor - the volume of a single coach. What is that factor? A) The area of the coach C) The cube root of the volume B) The circumference of the square D) The speed of the train E) The length of the train\nOutput: The volume of a single compartment = A * B * C Let the radius or the length of A = r, where r is the radius of the coach of circumference \u2018C\u2019 (in terms of speed of train v. Hence r = \u2018\u221a((v x C)\u00b2)(v x C x C) \u2013 (v x C)\u00b2\u2019 = \u2018\u221a()\u2019 Thus, the volume of the compartment = \u2018\u03c0r\u00b2 * r * H\u2019, where H denotes the", "answer": "D: engine"}

Each factor changes the temperature by 3 degrees. However, some parts of the oil can be cooled by a factor of 5, while other parts can be heated by a factor of 6. The engine temperature starts at 40 degrees and finishes at 75 degrees. During the 10 periods, it increases by 50 degrees, with periods 3, 5 and 7 being the only exceptions. For each period, a new, equal factor acts on the engine. Additionally, in periods 1, 2, 4 and 6, no cooling factor was used on the engine. The cooling factor affects the engine in periods 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 in increasing order of magnitude. When the engine is at the maximum temperature for a period (e.g. 2 and 5), no cooling factor is applied as the engine is not cooling itself. What is the maximum temperature the engine reaches during any one period?<n>Output: 90<n><n>Input: Diane drinks 9 cups of tea in a day and eats 1 ounce of cheese in a day.

Choices:  A: zoo B: museum C: hospital D: desk E: opera<n>Output:		A<n>(answer): A <n><n>### Solution:<n><n>Given $0.50, the price for each kilogram.<n><n>We can calculate our answer in two different ways.<n><n>Firstly, We can count the given digits. As there are 6 digits given, we would multiply these numbers by 6.<n><n>Secondly, we can count every digit in the question (given), add every 3 digits and subtract this sum by 0.<n><n>We are looking for the modulo of our answer. As we can see, when the value is greater than 10, it will return 1.<n><n>So, according to the question, if our answer is 1, it means that the purchase cost is $56.<n><n>The second question is counting the hours in total. We simply need to add every number in the question and get the sum. Then we can get the answer from dividing the first answer with 30.<n><n>The third question is a subtraction question. As there are only 3 elements given, to get the total sum of the two elements, we need to subtract 1.<n><n>Then we can count how many elements do we get from this operation and put the first answer in the place of the third element to answer the third question.<n><n>The fourth question says to multiply the elements and answer the question. The sum will contain 30 elements.<n><n>Each element will be repeated for 30 times, so the answer for the fourth question will be $560 (=4 × 0.25 × $3).<n><n>So, in total for the fourth question, we got $20.<n><n>We can do the same operation for the fifth question and apply the operation (modulo) on the first number and put it in the place of 4 to answer the fifth question.<n><n>According to the sixth question, we are looking for the answer of $18 (= 3 × 0.10 × $3).<n>Finally, the last question seems to be a sum question.<n><n>We can get the answer by doing 5 operations and get the answer by applying the operation for each element. So, the last operation is $450 and according to the question, we will get our answer by 12.<n><n>As we did already, we will put our first answer in the place to answer for the sixth

Each friend went to the gym for three hours the first year, four hours the second, six hours the third, and nine hours the forth. How many hours did each player spend on average playing basketball during the two years?<n>Solution: The player playing the 3 hours in first year avg = 3, in year 2 avg is 4.<n>In third year the avg is 6, and in fourth year the avg is = 9<n>Now in year 1, avg = 9/4<n>and in year 2, avg = 12/4<n>and in third avg =  4/9<n>and in fourth avg = 1/3<n><n>Let us substitute those values on a equation x + y = 11  <n>  <n>We get : x + y = 4x + y  => x + x+ y - 4x = 4x + 4x -2 x + y-4x=-2x so y = -2x + -4x = -6x<n>This yields  y = -3x <n>Now let us substitute those values on: (x+y)*2 = 5(x+y)  => 3x + 3y*2 -6x +12y  =>  x*2+ y*2 - 6x + 12y = 0 <n>and we get :  x+ y = 0<n>So we only substitute x on x = 0 and y on y = -2x <n>Substitute now on both sides to get:  x = -2x, and solving it on the right side: x = 0, and on the left side:  x = 1, thus the equation is x = -2x + 1 <n>Now we get: x = x, and can substitute it on (x = -2x +1). The equation now is: x+x = 3x, which means x=-2.<n><n>So we can also substitute the values in x=-2, and we get y=-3x = 2.  <n>Solution: (x + y)=18<n>x= 4, y = -14<n>4+

Let n be the number of nuts and d be the number of dried fruit bought. You know that 1 kg of nuts costs $9 and 1 kg of dried fruits cost $7. So 3 kg of nuts costs 9 * 3 = $27. 2.5 kg of dried fruit costs 7 * 2.5 so the cost of dried fruit is $17.5. The cost of the nuts and the dried fruit is $27 + 17.5 = $44.5.<n>

I got so deeply engrossed that I could not leave my desktop that night. It would stay engrossed even when I knew the answer to many of questions.<n>*  The best part is creating something and making your code work the way want it to. There were many times when I couldn't make anything work and I had to start coding from scratch just to try something out. For me starting an app is something that I think about everyday and when I finally got to do it, I felt like a weight was lifted off my shoulders.<n>*  I found Python to also be very interesting and I've never looked up at an error message in this way again. <n><n>I enjoyed reading and learning while using Python.<n><n><n>## Why are Python and React the best language choices?<n>### What excites you about the way Python and React do things that Java and Angular do not?<n><n>I used Javascript and React/Angular quite a lot in the last two years, and I know that there are some issues.<n><n>One of my first attempts to program resulted in a rather messy result, as I was not sure how to debug Python issues I ran into. I was a little overwhelmed at first, but then I felt it was great when I was able to write something that worked.  <n><n>I felt a sense of satisfaction once I was able to make something from scratch and this continues to be one of the most rewarding aspects of programming. <n><n>### A good programming language gives you a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment.<n>###

The time spent can be calculated using the time equation if we multiply the one hour by 3/4 then the answer will be time in minutes in the case I chose it is 180(3/4)(1) so the time in minutes = 180. To calculate the hours you can just divide 180 by 60 because an hour is 60 minutes. So the time in hours = 3<n><n>### Solution for part 4, 5, 6<n># Part 4 : we can use the time equation T = n/2. So 2*T = 2*5*80 = 2*400 + 4*100 = 880 + 400 = 1280<n>### Solution for Part 5 : 3000 = 200(15*9) = 75 * 250 * 200.

A n-digit number has n different digits 0, 1, 2,.... 9. Create a table using exactly 75 cells. There should be three rows of three cells in the first row, two rows of two cells in the next two rows, and so on. Each number must start at an even index and end at an odd index. Your table could look similar to this one: 000, 0000, 9999, <n>00009999,<n>0099900,<n>019999000, <n>0299990999,<n>........................................................................<n>..<n>....................................................................<n>..................................................................<n>....<n>9999990........<n>The only missing numbers are the two digit numbers from a base of 11.

The final piece of straw adds 1.5 to the piled straw, so the total is 2 + 2.5 = 4.5. In base 4, the decimal point is positioned to the right of the last digit. In base 4 position, the pile would be 4 + 4 + 4, which equals 12.  The base of this function is 1

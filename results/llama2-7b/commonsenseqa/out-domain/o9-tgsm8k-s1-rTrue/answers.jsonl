Two girls only go out for every guy, so we subtracted 2 for each girl after subtracting 2 for every guy.

In the following code, B is an abbreviation for base 6.  T(2) is the A# in music theory.  Which value of x is equivalent to T(2)?\nOutput: To answer this question, we are going to try to solve x = <<x=14>>1.\nThis is because we want to start from the smallest x, where T(2) is equal to x. Since T(2) = <<7>>7 and x = <<14>>14  T(2) - x = <<7-7>>3 is negative. This means T(2) must be larger than x.\nSo what we want is for T(2) to be larger while keeping x = <<14=7>>7, since T(2) - 7 = <<10-7>=3>>3.\nTo find this value, we need to plug x = <<14>=7>>7 into x = <<14-a>=b>>.\nSo a = <<14-7>=7>>4 which is 7\nb=<<14-7>=0>>13 as T(2) + 7 is equal to 3 which is less than x.

There are three cakes and only three customers are willing to buy each cake. How much money might Annie earn? Choices:  Annie earned $1 for each cake sold. The cakes sold evenly.  Annie earned $4 for each cake sold and two of the cakes were free. Two customers bought each type of cake.  Annie made one chocolate cake. If that was sold she would earn $5.  Annie made two chocolate cakes and one vanilla cake. If all the cakes sold she'd earn $3.\nOutput: Let's write out each scenario and try to count cakes. So Annie earns $1 for each cakes sold. Three customers want to buy each cake evenly, therefore it seems there are only 3 cakes as a whole. However, if the cakes sold evenly, there should be 9 cakes, and since there are only 3 customers, they've got to get in line and wait to pick out their cakes. So, three cakes will be taken and the rest will remain. Now in the second scenario, if there's a total of 9 cakes being sold, two of the remaining three will not be sold. And if two customers wanted to buy each type of cake, we could assume the second customer chose the chocolate cake, and all three customers can get one chocolate cakes. So in that case, how much money can Annie earn? Annie earned 4 for each sold cakes * 3 cakes = 12.\nSo Annie earns $4 for each cakes sold and two of the them were free. Two customers are willing to buy and Annie still have three cakes left, so Annie can't finish this order as only she can bake cakes.\nThus, in the third question, Annie made one cake so she doesn't have enough cakes for two customers.\nIn the last scenario, you get a $5 cake when you earn $5. Three such cakes are sold, so she had only 9", "answer": "A: hear crowd go mad"}

I am assuming that the original amount of salt is more than 0 and I don't know what the actual amount is so I will use Y to represent the original amount of salt instead of Y in this problem.\nIt sounds like you add salt + flour together to get the flatter flour.  It takes 50 ounzes of flour plus 1 ounce of flour to get 51 ounzes of fluff.\nSo if you add 50 + Y, you get 51 + Y which is fluff.

Each cookie requires 2 eggs and 1/2 cup of sugar, and each slice of pie requires 7 eggs and 2 cups of sugar. If she has 65 eggs for her bake sale, how many slabs of pie can she make?\nOutput:Let x be the number of eggs required.\nBecause each egg corresponds to a cookie, we can say that x * 2 = 65 * 2 = <<1-->40>>40 slices of pie.\nSince each pie requires 7 eggs from 40, we can say that 7 * 40 = 280 eggs are needed for the pie.\nHowever, we have already taken 280 eggs into account, which means that for each slab of pie, we should reduce the value of the eggs by 280 / 40 = <<280/40=6 and a half>>6.5\nSo, 40 - 6.5 = <<40-6.5=33.5>>33.5 slices of pie.

How much does a 20-by-24 inch pizza sell for?\nOutput: 250 pizza sales are necessary to break even. If the gain is $2, then the price is 250 * $2 = <<250*2=500>>500 dollars.\nAs the pizza size is 20-by=24 inch, selling at $500 per pizza, we can assume that an inch is approximately worth $0.0020 dollars.\nSo the inches per 24 inch pizzas are 24 / 0.002 = <<24/0.002=1200>>1200.\nFor every inch on pizza, there is a $0.0002 dollars.\nSo for the 1200 inch pizzas, the extra cost is $2.4=<<2.4=0.00191>>0.00169726836762543253125.\nThe total cost would be 500 + 2.4 = <<500+0.0017=500+24>>500 + 0.001 dollars.\nSo the final answers are 0.00006.\n\nInput: Diane's team won the playoff game.

{"text": "During the session there was a lot conversation\nConversation, as described in the question, is \u201cexchange of thoughts and ideas.\u201d The word gathering means \u201cto collect things\u201d and the opposite is scattering. In this case, talking refers to the act of conversation. This means, while the team was talking about an idea, they gathered all of the ideas that came to their mind, and they all contributed to the idea of which team member decided to bring a particular idea to the team. So the answer C (sharing information) is incorrect.\nAfter talking more with the team, some group members started using the word information incorrectly, and started to think that the word information refers to both facts and thoughts. But information refers only to facts. As you can see, the answer cannot be B.\nThat\u2019s because ideas refer to thoughts, opinions, or beliefs, and information refers to facts.\nWhatever the case, information that is being shared is facts, not ideas.\nThen, the answer cannot be E since the word idea refers to a thought or opinion that is in someone\u2019s mind and not necessarily a fact, although it could be one.\nFor the answer then, since the answer refers ideas, then it simply is D.

Give a new output if A < B.\n\nInput: Calculate the area of a rectangle whose sides are A and B. A > B\nOutput: A rectangle with sides of A (A > B) is 2A length by 1/2A width. So the area of that rectangle is 2A.\nThen add 1/2A + 1/2B to the formula to account for the additional rectangle, so the area of that rectangle becomes 2A + 1B/2.\nThe area of the larger rectangle is 2A + 2B/A + 1B = A + 2B/2.\nThen divide A + 2B / 2 by A and subtract 1 from B to find the area of the rectangles together.\nA is always larger than B, so subtract 2 and add 1 back, giving 26B/5.\nFor rectangles A and B with sides L and W, respectively, the formula for the area of the larger rectangle becomes:\nArea_of_larger_rectangle = 2L + 2W/2.\nFor example, a rectangle with A = 4 and B = 2 will have area_of_larger = 6 + 2/1 + 2 = 9.\nInput: A and B are the lengths of a rectangle, in centimeters, from its sides.

But before we solve the problem we have to read carefully the entire problem so we can find the relation of each part of the problem and solve easily. We have 5 x 20 = <<5 x 20=100>>100 gallons of gasoline and 3 x 5 = <<5 x 3=15>>15 gallons of gas sold and 215 - 13 = <<215-15=200>>200 dollars of profit made in total. \nThe problem says that \"All water was sold, but...\" which means the water is not the main product and the main product is gasoline and the $215 is gained because of the gasoline and not the water. So 200 x 5 /100 = <<200 x 3/100=6>>6\nSo we sold 6 gallons of gasoline. So, 6 x 5 = <<6 x5=30>>30 gallons of gas were needed to sell 200 x5 dollars. \nWe have already saw that it needed 6 gallons of water for $13 and it needs 30 gallons of water to sell $200, therefore we sell it twice for $200 which is 6 x 6 or 6 x 2 or 3 x 3. 6 x 2 = <<6 x2=12>>1\nSo we need to sell 30 - 12 = <<30-12=18>>18more gallons of water for 6 x $20 = <<6 x 20=50", "answer": "C: kitchen"}

The first step is to find all the blocks that share the same color.  Find blocks that share the same colors and leave each other.  Repeat that process over the entire cube and you will be left with only one color.  That color is the center of your cube.  It is the color that is not yet on any of the sides of the cube. Once you remove all the other colors from your cube, you can start working on the cross. Fill in the cross and then work on the last side.  That last side can be filled with any pattern.  The cross and the remaining side should have the same pattern.

Choices: <4.1>, <15.3>, <21.3>, <30.45>, <33.46>\nOutput: The question doesn't say whether he pays his entire rent or not, however, we know more than half of the rent for the entire year is paid in January.\nWe can also conclude that he didn't pay his entire rent for the entire year, because then he wouldn't owe more.\n\nThe way to solve this problem is the following: Square root the man's monthly rent,\n(this will give a number that is > 1)\nsquare root again, (in this case, take square root of 2 times the man's monthy rent, which will still be > 1).\n\nThe answer is <33.45>.\n\nSince the man only owes a fraction of his year's rent (it was determined earlier that the payment is > 1/2 of the total rent), we can conclude that we are looking at the amount of time after January. For instance, if the man, starting with his rent on the first of January, continued to make payments on the same day of each month for the next 12 months, his January payment would come up as the first payment for the next month.\nIf the man continues, throughout the year, to make payments on January 1 for the last month of the year he will still", "answer": "A: think"}

A second train leaves Birmingham at the same time but has intermediate stops. How long does the second train take to get to London?\nOutput: According to the instructions, the second train leaves Birmingham but has intermediate stops and is a non-stop train to London. This implies that it stops at the intermediate destination(s) but does not stop anywhere else. Since the stops will be at intermediate destinations, the train will not arrive in London at noon. The 11am train left Birmingham before the 9am train did. Therefore, from the time the 9am train got to Birmingham, the 11am train had arrived at Birmingham, stopped for the non-stop segment of the journey and would continue to London with the total travel time of 1 hour and 45 minutes to get from Birmingham to London. Therefore, the train from Birmingham to London would take 2 hours and 15 minutes with an intermediate stop.\n\nInput:In a store, a single watermelon had an even price but was divided into 9 different prices.

It will then become increasingly narrower as it comes up to the edge of the swimming pool. The fountain will end at the edge of the pool with a width of approximately 10 inches at height of 2 feet above the water at the pool edge.\nOutput:The fountain will increase in width starting from 140 ft to ending at 10 inches. That is, The base width is 140 ft width and height is 3.3 ft (3.3 ft is one foot divided by 10) and this increases inward. Let us call this width and height as h. At a height of 2 (say depth of 2 feet), the width becomes a 10 inch width h2. We can solve this as 173.3(2-2) as we increase inward, then divide by 173.\nNow at height of 14 (say depth of 14 feet) the width is h14 = h2. We can evaluate 173.2 (2-0.2) which is 140.06 in.\nSince h14 = h0, then h14 = h14 = 140.6 in. and this is a 6 in. width for 14 feet h (h0 for h0 and h14 for h14). So h0 = h14 = (140.6-140) =.6 in.\nWe now get 0.6 in * 22.4 = 13.48 in. of water. If we start with 14 ft, then 13.49 in. is ~ 360 gallons. At h = 18.68 ft, the width is 17.22 in. which is 17.5 * 17.5 = ~ 310 gallons.\nSo the fountain is about 660 gal. per height\n\nInput:A rectangular table is made out of a wooden board.

C is the only answer that makes sense.\n\nInput:Why did the light bulb get cold? Choices: A) He was tired B) He turned up the air conditioner C) It was a fluorescent light D) It was a LED E) It turned itself off\nOutput: C) It was a led: A light bulb has no way of getting cold.

He spends 64 coins to buy a shirt, 36 coins to buy a pair of pants, and 8 coins to buy a sweater.  He still has 20 coins left. How many pants did he buy?\nOutput: After spending 100 - (64+36+8)=<<100-70=30>> coins he has 30 coins left. Using the greedy algorithm we could say that he spent this amount to buy both the pants and the shirt. However, the pair of pants will have 60 coins, so we can also say that he spent 30 coins on the shirt and also 60 on the pair of pants. In any case, the number of pants he buys = 30 + 60 = <<90=90>>.\n\nInput: How many pancakes do you need to make 57 pancakes if each pancake needs 3 egg whites, 2 large eggs, 2 cups of flour, 1 cup milk, and 2 teaspoons of salt?\nOutput: The minimum amount of pancakes needed is 3 eggs * 2.5 cups + 2 cups * 2.5 eggs + 2 cups milk = <<2.53*3+2.5*2+2.5=25>>25\n\nInput: You bought a new shirt, and it has 4 pockets.

How much would she use from the loan if she bought all the fruits if her change was enough for the first fruit?\nOutput: Jane has to borrow 4\u20ac.\nWhen Jane came to buy apple, she needed 6\u20ac. If we subtract a 4\u20ac loan, 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2\u20ac left for the apple.\nLola didn't make her friend a loan before since the remaining change still cannot cover the bananas.\nShe must have done it immediately after the change didn't cover the fruit.\nWhen 2\u20ac left from her change, she bought her second apple, and the last apple she bought was needed 4\u20ac.\nSo, after she bought apples, she had 4\u20ac left.\nSince her total spend was 12\u20ac and her change left was 4\u20ac, Lola lended her 4\u20ac again, but Lola received a 6\u20ac as a favor.\nSo, Lola lended 2\u20ac and received 2\u20ac", "answer": "E: wave on"}

Then, using the equation x = y * z we can get x = 3z, so z is 3x/x.  Using the same equation we can find 3x = z * 7 and so 3x = 21, x = <<21/3=7>>7.\nWe know that 3/3 of a class is x.  We also know that x/x is 1, which tells us that x = 1.  So the first part of question is actually asking, \"What is one third of a class?\"\nThe class that has one third of the class would have << 3x/x = 3x/1=3x>>3x students.\nThe class with the one third of the original class are the << 3x/1x=1>>1 and the rest are << 100>>1 students.\nSo x = 1 implies there are 3 people in the class.\nSo the final statement is D: 3 people\n\nInput:In order to give the correct information for the 4th grade math division problem, the person should use which of the following numbers in the calculation?\nOutput:In order to get the correct answer to the question the person should use C because it is the answer to the problem and A is", "answer": "C: equal opportunity"}

Since every cleaning takes 5-15 minutes, for the total of 55 ear cleanings, they have a total of 110 minutes worth of ear cleanings, which is equal to 2+2+ 2+ 2 = <<2+2+2+2>>6 times the number of ear cleanings.  So they have 110 times 55 ear cleaning = <<110*55=6250>>6250 minutes worth of ear cleaner.\nOut of the 120 dogs, 45 take the exam at $10.  There are 75 dogs that do not take the exam making the total money from the 45 dog exam equal to 45*10 = 51-50=<<51>50>>50 dollars.\nSince there are 45 ear cleanings, the amount of money for ear cleanings is 50 + 110*50 = <<310>>310 dollars.\nThe total money the groomer makes is 310+50 = <<360>>360 dollars\nSo the final answer here is 360.\n\nInput:What are the three steps on the groomer\u2019s appointment calendar to complete services successfully?

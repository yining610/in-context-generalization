Not the zoo, not inside. So I chose to go with the great outdoors or the outdoors. I just want to make the connection there for the listeners. And then finally, why is the monkey so much more prominent in the rainforest than anywhere else? Again, I assume it's because there's a lot of trees and that's where they live in the trees.

If we are not sure about some variable, say 'x', then it is better to leave it blank instead of making wild guesses.\n\nAs we have one 'x' to match with all the given four variables, the minimum we can eliminate is two matches in an answer choice.\n\nIn case of this question, we can write 'x' as the denominator of the total fraction and obtain the required denominator by putting the value of 2/6 back into it.\n\nFor this we need to calculate,\n\n\\(\\frac {-2}{6}-1\\)\n\nThis value is close to 0 and therefore needs to be rounded off as 1/6 to make an equivalent denominator. Therefore, the answer choice 'c' will be helpful.\n\nFor the second question, the same strategy used in the first question can be used. The denominator of the second question is quite large and the total value (sum of the values in the numerator) for that denominator is 100.\n\nTherefore, it is safe to assume 100 as the total.\n\nNow the denominator can be obtained by subtracting the sum of the values in the denominator and each numerator will be represented by 6 /112", "answer": "B: appear beautiful"}

When you have a question that contains some variables and can be solved algebraically, go ahead.\n\n```\nExample: Question 2.\n```\n\nIn the given two equations, I found out that `a = b`\n\nand `a = 14`\n\nSince `f(x) = b` for even `x` and `f(x) + k` for odd `x`, I just used `f(x = 29)` formula for even `x` which is `b = 48`. \n\n\n#### ANSWR : \n\n\n```\nLet x = 27.7.\n\n14 x 10 = 277 and y = 7.5.\n277 y 10 = 755\n\nx = y 10\nx = 75.5.\n```\n\nThe given information shows that `c = 21` but if we check the value in our equation, it should be `14x`. We have `27.7x + 7.5x + 1 = 275.9`\n\nI didn't know how to check value `0` so I had to check `0` by adding the equation.\n\nThe given equations are `X = 35` and `75x + 135x + 775x - 1 = 75`\n\nWe are given both the X and the Y variables, so `5 = 12`.

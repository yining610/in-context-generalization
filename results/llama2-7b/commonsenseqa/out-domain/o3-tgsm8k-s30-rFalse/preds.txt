Suppose you have to figure out the average speed of two trains that pass one another.  You know that the train going south has an average speed of 60 miles per minute, meaning it covers a mile in six minutes.  The train going north going covers a mile in seven minutes.  The first train starts 8 minutes behind the second and is 5 miles longer, so how long did it take the two trains to pass one another?<n>Output:  The average speed of the southern train is 60. The average speed of the northern train is 67. The length of the southern train is twice that of the northern train when the two trains pass each other, this would mean that the two trains pass each in ten minutes and thirty seconds. Which makes the average distance the two trains pass with in the same day 310.55 miles (10x60 and 10x67).<n><n>Input: 2x+4; b+3,x-4; x+2; x-3; 6<n>Output:<n>6x <n><n>Input:  x=2

Each person will be dressed in a costume from an era. The eras are: PRE-PRE INDUSTRIAL AGE (10th century); INDUSTRIAL (the 19th century); MODERN AGE (1960’s and beyond); POST-INDUSTRIAL (2020). Write a loop which, for each of the 27 people attending the costume party, determines the number of the era in which they are  dressed. For example, if one of the guests is Pre-Industrial, the loop would print the number 10 on the terminal. If one of them is  Industrial Aged, the loop would print 2. If one of them  was dressed in 1960’S clothing the loop would print 7.

Choices:  A: body of water B: lake superior C: underwater D: toilet E: aquarium<n>Output:		toilet<n><n>#### Explanation:In the first question there isn't really enough information to tell what day she rented it but the answer is $190 because it's in whole dollars.In the second question if I think about how to divide the whole number by the rest of the number(which would be the denominator in math) I would get 25 and my answer would be 11.In the third question if I add all the costs of the $50.04 and the $549. 40 because 40+20 =60 then 60+20 = 80 and then 100+40=140.  Then 50+40+100 would be 190 which would be correct because she paid $190 for it.In the fourth question it would equal to the answer of how many dollars it would be.I picked E because that's the toilet,I couldn't really read the toilet section but fish don't spend a lot of their time in there.

It is reasonable to assume that the animals will start moving a short while after all the conditions of starting are met, whether that involves finding each other, deciding how far to walk today, organizing them into an orderly group, or simply getting each animal to get going.<n><n>Once the group is on the move, there are always two quantities of interest: the pace to which the animals are moving and the number of animals in this group.  Each animal moves independently, and their interactions are primarily governed by their need to avoid collisions and to walk at an appropriately consistent speed, so the main factor that is affecting the pacing of travel is the number animals.<n><n>There is one more thing that is important, and that is for each animal to maintain a healthy walking pace.  If an individual were to move so fast that they begin to tire quickly, they must start to walk more slowly. In this way, one could argue that a group of animals is pacing its travel to an average walking pace.<n><n>#### Task Details<n><n>Consider a group of animals.  A single animal walks a distance based on its physical condition, and its distance will depend only on its pace; that is, a laden cow will have a slower walking speed than an unladen cow.

The first part says that they charge $20/day plus the first week is $160. $20 * 11 = $220.  $190 - $220 = -$30. The answer should be -$50.

They have been given the following set of numbers associated with pet ownership: (12, 6, 16, 17).  They have asked you to create four charts to summarize the data.  They have asked you specifically to make sure that your charts are 1) complete enough to reveal any patterns that might exist, 2) visually appealing, and 3) make sense to other students who might view the charts.  What must you do to create the charts? (List out the steps explicitly.)<n><n>Output: You must draw a pie chart for the data you have. Draw a bar chart, line chart and a column chart for your data. Remember that when dealing with data your graph title or legend must be on the graph to assist others in comprehending what is going on.<n><n>Input: You're a teacher at a local elementary school, and the student body has been asked to contribute to a project for the children at a local orphanage for Christmas. You've put the names of several children who've recently been adopted on the classroom board, so students can start writing checks to give to their new "brother" or "sister."  You'd also like to graph data from a pretest you gave the students prior to the holiday, along with some basic data regarding the children's ages.  How can you ensure that each child receives one $10.00 donation while using as few resources as possible? (List out the explicit steps to take.)<n><n>Output: Use a frequency table rather than a column chart to graph the student data because each type of chart shows only one type of data at a time. A bar chart will give you the student ages as a total, and you will not be able to see the relationship between age and donation amount.<n><n>Input: Which of the following is the best example of a function?

Choices:  A: street B: soccer field C: soccer game D: central park E: pool table<n>Output:		A: A ball can be played in the street.<n><n>#### Explanation:<n>---<n>In the first problem, you will have the variable $f$ and the variable $30$.  Your job is to find the value of $f$ for $30$.  $f$ represents the price you need to pay for renting that car.  You can use any of the basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.<n><n>You can use this equation to create the answer 310.<n><n>The car has a $30$ price<n><n>You will be using it for $11$ days, the equation becomes:<n>![equation](./images/weekago.png)  <n>The number of price is multiplied by 11.<n><n>You can replace $f$ to $f*11$.<n><n>The answer after computing is 310.0.<n><n>In the second problem:<n>[![equation](./images](/images/bigger.png) ](./images/bigger.gif)<n><n>---<n><n>In the example above, assume the car can be transported at 60 miles/hour.<n><n>Divide the distance/miles by the time/hours.<n><n>The amount of time to travel in two different problems is  $7200\div 60 = 120$.<n><n>The answer to the first problem is $120$.  It is more than 100, but not more than 150.<n><n>In problem two, the answer turns out to be $72000\div 30$.<n><n>In this kind of question, the answer is $40$.<n><n>You can answer the question by calculating $40\div 6=6.667$.<n><n>For the third problem, if it’s $50$ days and $50$ price, then you use $50*(50)$ that is $100*$100.<n><n>You get $10000$.<n><n>Since the maximum can answer is $15000$, you cannot answer since $1000\div1500\neq 1$.<n>

Recall that an integer slope of \(m\) of any line is a slope of \({}\frac{y}{m}{}\). In Java, the m function computes the slope of a line given two points.<n><n>#### Instruction : Give brief description about your answer<n><n>The solution for this problem is to first determine whether the line with the given points is parallel to the line with the x and y points. If not, the slope is non-zero. Otherwise, if the points are parallel, the slope is the same (they are both zero). In either case, the slope is a function of x and of y. You need to find values of y for which the x's are the same. Since this is a linear function, the values are \(a{}\frac{y}{x}{}+ {}\frac{dy}{dx}{}\), and you need to solve for \(y\) to determine the integer slope.<n><n><n><n>

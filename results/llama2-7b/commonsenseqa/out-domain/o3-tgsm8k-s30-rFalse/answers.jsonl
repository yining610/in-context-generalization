It is reasonable to assume that the animals will start moving a short while after all the conditions of starting are met, whether that involves finding each other, deciding how far to walk today, organizing them into an orderly group, or simply getting each animal to get going.\n\nOnce the group is on the move, there are always two quantities of interest: the pace to which the animals are moving and the number of animals in this group.  Each animal moves independently, and their interactions are primarily governed by their need to avoid collisions and to walk at an appropriately consistent speed, so the main factor that is affecting the pacing of travel is the number animals.\n\nThere is one more thing that is important, and that is for each animal to maintain a healthy walking pace.  If an individual were to move so fast that they begin to tire quickly, they must start to walk more slowly. In this way, one could argue that a group of animals is pacing its travel to an average walking pace.\n\n#### Task Details\n\nConsider a group of animals.  A single animal walks a distance based on its physical condition, and its distance will depend only on its pace; that is, a laden cow will have a slower walking speed than an unladen cow.

For 1 <= x <= n, let s(x) be the sum of all the numbers ending in x; that is, for 1 <= x <= 10, s(x) = d(10x + 9) + d(10x+8) +... + d(10 x +2) +d(10 x +1) + d(19 x +9) + d(n-8) +... +d(n-2) + d(n -1).

The students will collect data on the types of pets children prefer and the number of pets that children have. They are interested in seeing what patterns, if any, emerge. They have been given the following set of numbers associated with pet ownership: (12, 6, 16, 17).  They have asked you to create four charts to summarize the data.  They have asked you specifically to make sure that your charts are 1) complete enough to reveal any patterns that might exist, 2) visually appealing, and 3) make sense to other students who might view the charts.  What must you do to create the charts? (List out the steps explicitly.)\n\nOutput: You must draw a pie chart for the data you have. Draw a bar chart, line chart and a column chart for your data. Remember that when dealing with data your graph title or legend must be on the graph to assist others in comprehending what is going on.\n\nInput: You're a teacher at a local elementary school, and the student body has been asked to contribute to a project for the children at a local orphanage for Christmas.

How can you ensure that each child receives one $10.00 donation while using as few resources as possible? (List out the explicit steps to take.)\n\nOutput: Use a frequency table rather than a column chart to graph the student data because each type of chart shows only one type of data at a time. A bar chart will give you the student ages as a total, and you will not be able to see the relationship between age and donation amount.\n\nInput: Which of the following is the best example of a function?

At midnight, the same city is blanketed in 3000 feet of fog.

For example, from a time with 1 mile of visibility at midnight to a time with 3000 foot of visibility, the change should be 2999.\n\nMy solution: I'll use an array and a counter to count the hours in-between.

The goal is to find out if there is a possible combination of two elements that will lead to a product of 0, and return the indices of the two elements.\nFor example, if there is a `[2,2,5]` array, the answer is either `[[0,1],[1,0]]`.\n\nWrite a function, `fibonacci`, that returns a list of the first 100 Fibonacci numbers.\n\nWrite a `reverse` function that reverses string and returns the new string.\n\nWrite a sortBy function that takes in a dictionary `x` and a string `k` and then returns an sorted `list` of strings based on `x[k]` keys of `x`'s values.\n\n### Part B: What goes in the main function?\n\nThe below code is a skeleton of a main function.

{"text": "A: A ball can be played in the street.\n\n#### Explanation:\n---\nIn the first problem, you will have the variable $f$ and the variable $30$.  Your job is to find the value of $f$ for $30$.  $f$ represents the price you need to pay for renting that car.  You can use any of the basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.\n\nYou can use this equation to create the answer 310.\n\nThe car has a $30$ price\n\nYou will be using it for $11$ days, the equation becomes:\n![equation](./images/weekago.png)  \nThe number of price is multiplied by 11.\n\nYou can replace $f$ to $f*11$.\n\nThe answer after computing is 310.0.\n\nIn the second problem:\n[![equation](./images](/images/bigger.png) ](./images/bigger.gif)\n\n---\n\nIn the example above, assume the car can be transported at 60 miles/hour.\n\nDivide the distance/miles by the time/hours.\n\nThe amount of time to travel in two different problems is  $7200\\div 60 = 120$.\n\nThe answer to the first problem is $120$.  It is more than 100, but not more than 150.\n\nIn problem two, the answer turns out to be $72000\\div 30$.\n\nIn this kind of question, the answer is $40$.\n\nYou can answer the question by calculating $40\\div 6=6.667$.\n\nFor the third problem, if it\u2019s $50$ days and $50$ price, then you use $50*(50)$ that is $100*$100.\n\nYou get $10000$.\n\nSince the maximum can answer is $15000$, you cannot answer since $1000\\div1500\\neq 1$.", "answer": "A: street"}

{"text": "B\n\nInstructions: \n\nThis is the start of a lesson on algorithms.  Your task of writing good \nalgorithms is very important, but not the main point of this lesson.\nRather than worrying about writing good algorithms (or if you're new to\nprogramming, about even having a computer program), focus on writing\ncorrect algorithms.\n\nIn the sections that follow, you'll be working on and writing multiple\nchoice problems about algorithms.  We use \"multiple choice\" because most\npeople expect computer programs to work like tests: there are answer\nchoices and the program chooses the one that is \"correct\".  In terms of\nhow the programs actually work, that is obviously an unfair analogy, but\nas a concept, it helps you think about the right approach to solving\nprogramming problems.\n\nIn this lesson, we're programming multiple-choice games.  There are many\nsimilarities between multiple choice games and tests:\n\n1. there are a limited number of possible answers;\n2. one answer is correct and the other answers are probably wrong;\n3. you expect there to be one (and only one) answer correct;\n4. there are questions and the answer to each question is either one\n    answer or the other (the answer is not in neither of these choices if it\n    comes to that).\n\nIn programming multiple-choice games, we want to let the user answer\nquestions and get feedback of the correctness of the answers.  To make\nthis work, a few things need to happen:\n\n1. There needs to be some way for the computer to know whether an answer\n    is correct or not.  The computer will then print the correct answer to\n    the question.\n\n2. The correct answer needs to be stored somewhere (otherwise how will\n    the computer know it's right?).\n\n    That storage needs to be outside the main code of the program, but\n    inside the program, so that the storage of correct answers can be \n    accessed by the game.\n\n3. The person playing the game needs to type their answers.\n\n    The computer can't just know what the correct answer is, because it\n    hasn't written it anywhere.\n\n    There are a variety of ways that users might type their answers,\n    and as you learn more about", "answer": "C: naked"}

Recall that an integer slope of \\(m\\) of any line is a slope of \\({}\\frac{y}{m}{}\\). In Java, the m function computes the slope of a line given two points.\n\n#### Instruction : Give brief description about your answer\n\nThe solution for this problem is to first determine whether the line with the given points is parallel to the line with the x and y points. If not, the slope is non-zero. Otherwise, if the points are parallel, the slope is the same (they are both zero). In either case, the slope is a function of x and of y. You need to find values of y for which the x's are the same. Since this is a linear function, the values are \\(a{}\\frac{y}{x}{}+ {}\\frac{dy}{dx}{}\\), and you need to solve for \\(y\\) to determine the integer slope.", "answer": "C: superior"}

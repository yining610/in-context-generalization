The grocery list items and their costs are given as a set of strings, each list item being a string of length 5. The first 4 characters in the string describe each item, and the last character determines the price of the item. A zero in the last character price represents free, while any other character represents a cost associated with that item. Lists of items can contain letters and numbers. For example, assuming that the second entry in our example input is the cost for 1 bottle, the third item costs a total of 1205. If the items are represented as a list of tuples, the first string, price and total are determined from the second-last string, the list index of tuples. The cost for the first item will always be zero (assuming it does not require other items). If an item requires other items, the total cost is calculated by multiplying the previous item cost by the previous total cost (the last character should have a non-zero value). For example, assume that the first item in our example input is a 1. Then, the third item would cost a total of 1 with the previous total cost being 0. Then the fourth item would cost a total price of 1.0 x 1.0 = 1.0 so the total cost for the 4 items would be 1.0 + 1.0 = <<1.0+1.0=2>>2. As an aside, this problem asks for  the solution to be performed in Python's builtin decimal library in Python 3.0.<n><n>## Examples:<n><n>### Input:<n>"apple,1,apple,0,apple,0,orange,1"<n>"""<n>Output:<n>The cost for the apple is 1 and it does not require any other items.  So the total is 1.<n>The cost for the orange is 1.0 since it requires one apple to get it.  The cost for the apple is also 1.<n>The total cost is

So the correct answer is "B"<n>Output: One option is to turn off the water completely. This is not safe and should never be done.<n>Output: One way to fix it is to flip the switch to turn on the pump <n>Output: One option would be to turn off the sprinkler system.  This is unconventional and probably not recommended.<n>Output: You can make it even hotter by turning on all the lights.  This is unnatural and dangerous.<n>Output: The correct output is "B: 24 hours" because this is the only solution that ensures a safe environment.<n>Output: You may not be able to turn on the lights without first fixing the sprinkler system, because it would still be off. <n>Or it would be dangerous to turn them on first while the sprinkler <n>system is still off because it would be a fire hazard. <n><n>Output: A safe alternative is "B: 18 hours" because this gives 18 hours in which to safely turn on the lights without having to first fix the sprinkler system<n>Output: You should go to a theater.  The reason is that it's more interesting than watching TV.<n>Output: One option for fixing the temperature problem is by "A: 40 miles" turning off the lights. This is the safest thing to do.<n>Output: 1. The temperature in the house is too high. In order to make it comfortable again as soon as possible we need to solve the overheating problem immediately to prevent the house from catching fire.<n> 2. The correct output is "C: Shut door" because it solves the problem immediately.<n>Output: Another alternative is to wait and see "C: 24 hours". This would result in the entire house still feeling hot for 24 hours.<n>Output: You will only go upstairs if "A: you have a cat"<n>Output: One safe alternative is "A: Turn off heater" that lowers the room's temperature rapidly. <n>

It was 3:in large flocks.<n>It also would help with this sort of stuff if there was a way to see the questions before giving an answer rather than having to go through the process of writing a 8 different answers to try and get the correct question.<n><n>Input : What makes airplanes fly? Choices : 1: Wings 2: propeller 3: Engine 4: Gravity 5: Wind 6: Weight  <n>Output : Propeller.  Even though the answer is 5 because of gravity in the air.  Since propeller and gravity are both correct then it must be propeller which can be 2 or 5.<n><n>

The project was designed to solve the problem of needing to determine the cost of a customer’s purcahses.  After looking at the questions given, it became clear that the program would need to be able to determine the total amount of cost for a purchase.  The project’s main features was to have the program to read the question and output the correct answer. <n><n>## What did i learn?<n><n>In this project, I was able to create a main class that is able to ask a user for three different questions and then return a response to user depending on the question asked.  The question I had the most difficulties with, was to get the program to output the correct decimal amount.  This project was one of the most important projects I've done throughout my Programming course because it showed me that there is so much to learn about programming and that it is better to learn how to ask questions than to learn programming language.

Choices:  A: get money B: pay money C: go shopping D: lose money E: save money<n>Output:		<n>Fake sales is common at stores to entice consumers.  They make buyers think that they're getting a deal by getting things on sale for less money. They do this by making you buy something that you don't need at a mark-up.<n>A: For all the things we buy, we pay for them with our hard-earned money. When we make purchases, we're giving money to the person that's selling us the thing. There's no deal getting made. What you get is what you pay for.<n>B: Pushing women to buy more by making them believe that they'll get a sale. If they buy an item that's full price, then they will get an equally full price item free. But, the catch is, they pay a certain amount more for the first piece than for the second. So in effect, they actually just spent more on the two items than if they only bought the first one. They may feel like they saved money, but actually gave money away.<n>C: Giving away money is the opposite of saving money. Women spend money on things that they don't need.<n><n><n>Input: Diana is a waitress who works 65 hours per week for $50k.

But I still think that it isn't a bad question. And the other problems have to do with the user experience. The second problem seems to be an intermediate question, so the user might not know the answer to this. And the last problems is a difficult one which takes a bit of a process of elimination. So I think that the questions are good, but could use a bit of refinement to make them more intuitive.

The first digit is odd, and the next one is multiple of 5 and can't be the same as the previous -1 digit. The last number is not even, and there exists a number smaller than it. It might be helpful if you saw what  all the previous numbers were.  The numbers are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25, 28, 29, 31, 32...  I'll explain when the first digit is odd and the last number is even, then the first digit is even and the last number is odd.<n>Output: If the first digit is odd  and the last number is equal to  2 we should round it to 2. This happens because the first digit (1) is odd and the last digit 2 is even, so the first digit has to be even  (2). This means the first digit was even. This is just a continuation of the last case.<n>If the first digit is odd   and the last number is Odd then we  should round it to 4 because the last digit (9) is odd so the first digit (10) has to be even(4) so 8 is the first digit.<n>If the first  digit is odd    the last number is even   then we round it to 8 because of the last digit it had to be even so we end with digit 8. The first digit is even  so the second digit can not be the previous digit. So it has to be 6 it was even so it has to be odd. The third digit has to be a number smaller to it we have 0<4<8<6. The  last digit we should take the biggest even number for it. So we end up with 48

The class averaged 68% in English and 54% in Math, which gave them a final average of 62%.  How many points was the essay worth?<n>Output: The teacher is saying there are 100 points in total. She's reducing 25% so the total is 100 - 25 = 75.  The English class average is 68%, so she's multiplying it by 68 and dividing it by 100 since we are looking for 10 points, giving us 51% of the points in English.  In Math, the average is 54%, so she multiplies by 54 and divides by 100, giving us 22% of the points that she's taken away, giving us a total of 33% being removed from the test.  Therefore, the final answer for the essay value of total points is 75 * 51% * 33%=<<75*51%*33%=23.025>>23.02<n><n>Input: A pile of 10 coins costs $0.15. I gave my 10 coins a week.

How long would the journey take without accounting for paddling energy? Assume that paddling the canoe is not free.<n>Output<n>So the total distance would be k miles, but that also includes 22 miles.  But the first half of the distance can be taken away.  So the answer is k*22/2=(<<k*22/2=11>) that is 11 hours.<n>If we take the first half of the two waterfalls away from the overall journey then that would be (<<10*8+12*1)=108+(12*1)=(<<108+(1*12)=138>><n>So the overall time of the journey without accounting for energy paddling is 11+138/(<<11+132/(2)=16.38>>26.38). = 16+132/2 = 16.38

But we are inconsistent because we rarely leave off 8 when "eight" or "eighty" starts the number.<n>Output: Because 1 is the least, it is most commonly used,<n>So most of us are used to leave off our last 1 when using "1" as a starting number<n>For this reason, we are more likely to use "131" than "133",<n>However, we leave off our last 8 when starting with "eighty" or "eight",<n>For this reason, "181" and "1808" is more likely to hear than "178"<n>The number "18" is also most likely to be used in the "one" position of our decimal point, such as "1.8", "18.9", and "189" is more likely to use than "1.18", "118.9",

How much money do you need to save by next November to buy your plane tickets?<n>Output: Let me break down the work this way:<n>1. You plan on going every other month. So 7 months = 7 * 2 = <<7*2=14>>14 trips<n>2. You plan on going each third month, this gives << 3*14>>3 extra trips<n>3. You plan on going the remainder each fourth month, which gives << 4*14>>4 extra trips<n>So the total you planned on going is << 14 + 3 + 4>>14+3+4=21<n>So 14+3+2=<<14+3+1=20>>21trips<n>4. Now it cost $1,000 to fly each way. So 14+3 = $<<14+3 = 17>>17 one way<n>5. So the total cost for flying is $17*21 = $<<17*21=387>>387 one ways<n>6. Now $387 divided by 120 days = <<387/120=3.25>>3.25 bucks per day<n><n>Input: You have three different types of meat.  You can buy a mix of meat from each type and receive a discount of $0.04 per pound.  All types of meat cost $2.58 per pounds, but each type of meat is on sale for these prices for the month:<n>* $0.45 off<n>* $1.25 off<n>* $2.44 off<n><n>Output: Let's break down this problem:<n>1. All the types of meat cost $0.45, $1.25, and $2.44 per pound<n>2. Let's choose different types of meat to make different mix.<n>3. Now we can create a chart showing how

Choices:  A: carpenter's shop B: video game C: garage D: total number E: building<n>Output:		A: building<n><n>### Solution: The correct answer to this question is A which describes building.This is because a building could have numerous stores and this is possible since building is not a single building. For example, supermarkets, shops, hospitals, shopping malls fall under building. But for other answers like carpenter's, video game and garage, they would all be considered a single building in real life as opposed to the example I gave of building which can contain many different buildings within it. Moreover, for building, the amount of levels does not matter as well because I think it is a mistake to choose C of having more than one level.

It happened that we finished buying things in almost exactly the same time.  However, to their surprise the store was not very far from where we were meeting. And the hotel was only a short walk away from it.  But to start our family member was late so we had to walk instead of driving to the hotel.  The hotel was a relatively long distance away so we took about 50 minutes to walk there.  After 15 minutes we saw the group.  Someone had been there before us we thought.

Choices:  A: wait for B: eat out C: entertain D: please parents E: paint<n>Output:		She's inviting everyone over and what we're going to do is we're choosing from a set of options. And if we use it, then we put the number 1 on the end.  And when we do that, let's say for example that, we had 7 out of 5 choices A, B and C, D, E and F.  So we put the one on the end, we go with the first number 1. Or let's say, for example, we had three options and we were choosing from E or G then we put that down somewhere. E is our first choice.  The second one would be G and the third one would be what?  So those would be our options.  And so on and so forth through our five choices.  So 7/2, so we've got five options. We need to pick two of those.  And when we're looking at this, we can also see that the number value has added up to 14, which might be a reasonable idea to use. So if we use that value to calculate some possible answers for us, let's see if all of our options might work there. And so, E and B could work. G and B could work. E and D could work, and so on. And if it happens that all our options work, let me just tell you what, let me just tell if each one of them works. So E and B would work since 7 to 2.  What about G and B? The two of them would not work. There are no three letter combinations where each letter is different. So we need to exclude E, G. Let's use D instead of G, and just use those two letters. Same thing with G and D. There are no two letter combinations where each letter's different. Let's use E B instead. And if we do that, we find out, we find out that our values are quite small and it doesn't look like anything else is going well. So that means that our answer is E and B.<n><n><n>

So she talked about the need for all objects to have a defined mass. That means when an object accelerates in some direction, its mass also moves in that new direction according to Newton’s first law. That means a force must be on an object in order for it to change in speed or direction. This force moves in the same direction as the mass. If a force increases the speed of an object, the object's mass also increases, resulting in a larger force on the object.<n>### Instruction:(Option1)<n>Input: What is the mass of this ball?<n>Answer: The force is on the ball! The ball does not have a mass!<n>### Instruction :(Option 2)<n>Input: What do you get by adding (mass of planet Earth) * (mass of moon)?<n>Answer: An empty room<n>### Instruction : Use your new knowledge to answer this question.<n>Input:A tree can be measured by its volume, which is the "amount of space it takes up".

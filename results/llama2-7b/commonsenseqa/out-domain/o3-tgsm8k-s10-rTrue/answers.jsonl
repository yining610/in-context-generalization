Write complete and thoughtful responses. Use proper grammar and spelling, capitalization, and punctuation.  Provide appropriate mathematical computations that are aligned to the multiple choice question or other instructions provided to you. Provide correct and adequate responses to all the parts of the instructions. If the instruction asked you to identify a certain number in a sentence, then you _should_ identify the correct number (in the sentence), even if that number _cannot_ be said to be 3, 2, or 5. This point is often missed.  If you are _asked_ or requested to find a _certain number_, you should only identify or compute or type that particular number (in the given sentence). Do not _guess at all_ or randomly select numbers in the sentence. If an instruction asks you to find certain things such as the _number of months_ or the _total cost_ in a sentence, then your answer should only include that _exact phrase_ (as in the number of months or the total cost).  Avoid randomly guessing just any number that you feel like typing. If you are not asked to type something that _can also be said to be 13, 32, 8,  and 12_, you are NOT requested to type _any one of_ 13, 12, 8 or 32. The assessment is not trying to see how many options you can think of. It is only trying to see how correctly you can identify or type what is asked in the sentence.  There are not any points that will be deducted for failing to type or identify any numbers that are NOT also 13, 25, 8, 12, or 20.\n\n## Parts of a Task\n\n> When the instructions start with a multiple choice question, you must respond by identifying (and typing) the correct multiple choice answer in the sentence.\n\n> When the task continues with either mathematical calculations (such as", "answer": "A: burlap sack"}

They tend to be very big or very small and they don\u2019t have a hilt on them. Anything with a hilt is E.\nA sword sheath is where you protect it from dirt and rust. The sword has a hilt, which is the handle that protects those fingers you use to grip the sword.  The shaft of the blade is called the blade, and it has a sharp pointy tip or edge at both ends, and it\u2019s what you use to cut and chop. The hilt can come in various shapes, but they're usually in a handle shape, like a hollow sphere, a cylinder, a leaf, or a cross section of a leaf.\n\n### Input for the second choice:\nWhat are some things we see in modern-day Japan?\n\nSome things you probably see are martial arts like karate. It\u2019s mainly used for protection and self-defense in everyday situations.\nIf you\u2019re thinking of food then sushi probably comes to mind for most people. It\u2019s another commonly known food from Japan for it\u2019s very unique taste. Nigiri and sashimi are the two main types of it. You may eat sushi from bamboo leaves to avoid a lot of rice from spilling out.\nIn fashion, some people think kimonos can be a sign of nationality, although they don\u2019t define it as \u201cnational dress.\u201d It is worn primarily, but not completely, by women. Geiko, who can be men or women, are more commonly associated with kimonos these days.\n\n#### Bonus:\n\nOne interesting thing I haven\u2019t mentioned yet is the traditional sword called katana. This is the actual traditional sword and it\u2019s made out of very strong tempered steel. They are used for various types of combat, but now they are used for show. However, they must be very sharp and be treated with resin to keep it strong.\n\nI hope this helps you understand the context better!\n\n### Input \nIf you're thinking about the future, how would you go back in time?

How much rocket fuel will I need?\n#### 88.464148 meters/3.6 cubic meters of helium\nAnswer: 88.4\nRationales:: The rocket will reach low earth orbit at a velocity of 5.86 * vf / 2 = 2.93252 kg * 9.81 meters/s^2 = 2.89 meters/s\nThe change in vertical velocity will be 2.89 - 0 = 2.8 meters because 2.89 is velocity and 0 is the initial vertical velocity.\nThat means the final vertical velocity will be 0 + 2.8 = 2.85.\nThe final vertical velocity times the mass of the rocket = final vertical velocity * mass = 2.8 * 60.429kg = 165.13 kilograms.\nThat is the amount of helium the rocket will need to reach low earth orbit.\n\n### Input3:\nI like to build rockets. I\u2019ve made multiple successful launches before. I launched one of my rocket last month. I decided to launch it to 600,000 meters, and it took place", "answer": "C: spinning wheel"}

{"text": "1. the correct answer is D because a wind with wave the wheat on a dry season.\n\n### \nThe wind is often called \"blowing wind\". Wind is a fast movement of air from one place to another. The wind carries moisture, dust, smoke, pollen, and other particles. If the wind comes from the sea, it picks up salt particles from the water, making the air salty.\n\nFor example, sea wind is salty.\nA salty sea wind is also called a \"salty wind\". \n\nThere are four kinds of winds.\n\nThe 4 kinds of winds are:\n- The warm wind has less pressure than the cold wind and so it blows faster.\n- The cold wind has higher pressure than the warm wind and so it blow faster.\n- Wind that blows from the sea toward the land is called a sea wind.\n- Wind that comes from the sea will bring moisture with it.\n- If you want to move things on water quickly, you can use the wind.\n\nThe wind speed is measured in meters. \n\nWind speed is the speed at which the wind is moving. \n\n### Demostraction:\nThe wind direction is a direction that is determined by the direction from which the wind blows.\n\nThe wind blows when you feel the pressure of the air.\n\nThe wind direction is the direction from which the air is blowing.\nThe wind speed is the speed of the air. \n\nThe wind speed changes depending on where you are.\n\nThe wind will blow from east or west. \n\nThe warm wind blows from the east or the west, and the cold wind blows from the north, the south, or the sea.\n\nThe cold wind blows from north, south, or sea.\n\nThe warm wind will blow from the ocean on days with a lot of cloudy weather.\nWhen it is sunny, there is no wind, so it is very hot. \n\nThe temperature will be high and the atmosphere will be dry. \n\n## Dry hair\nThe wind blows from the sea. \n\nThe salt air from the sea makes skin cells more vulnerable to sun damage than water alone, as salt water has less moisture than fresh water.  \n\nSea water is rich in salt", "answer": "C: blowing hard"}

{"text": "For class choice:Classroom has a ot of glued bottles.\n\n### Input and Response\nFor B: Police station\nFor C: Desk drawer\nFor D: School\nFor E: Classroom\n\n### Rationale: The police station has a building of glued bottles because when the police have their daily meeting, all of the police have discussions with one another. When they have meetings with one another, it's all good because police officers know everything in each other. They tell each other about the past, present and future, all the good stuff we did and all the bad stuff we did.\n\nThe desk drawer has a building of glues, because when the class teacher has a class, sometimes the students have assignments that include art. When the students do art, they often glue many things to a cardboard box and draw pictures. When they make their art and glue things it's important to let the artist put the glue on the box.\n\nThe school building also has a building of glue, because when the teacher takes the students to the desks, the students have papers that they have to copy down and the students also have many things to write about. When they have assignments, the students put glue on their worksheets and draw things. So when the staff takes the teachers and students up the stairs, they put a lot of glue on top of the desktops.\n\nThe class also has a lot of containers of glue. The desks had a lot of containers of art.  The art box was a cardboard box that was covered by paper, so I didn't see if the desks still had some of their art boxes. But when I look at the desks, they have some of those boxes on top of the desk. When the students use the desks, the teacher gives the teacher a box of paper and the students use the desktops as they usually do. The classroom doesn't have the art box, but the school has it. When a student uses a desk, they put some glue on the box to the desk and then write things on their desk. \n\n### A: Art room\nWhen school students use arts and crafts supplies at the art room, it looks like they'll use some of their arts supplies at the art supplies.

To answer the question input each choice and the corresponding rationales.\n\n> The following table shows the sales of an office supply store.  They sell $11,200 worth of file cases to lawyers each month, $9,000 worth of tape dispensers to engineers, $6,300 worth of folders to secretaries, $1,475 worth of writing paper to students, and $585 worth of white-out to retirees.  Write a ratio that is equivalent to the sum of the ratios of sales in each category.\n   Rationales: \nThere are two ways to do this. The first is to do division. \nTo find the total sales for each category, simply do the division of the whole sales by all the respective amounts of sales for each category.\nFor file cases, do ($11,20 \u00f7 9,000 = 1.25)\nFor tape dispensers, simply divide ($11,2 \u00f7 6,300 = 1)\nFor folders (11,20+6,300)/12,600 = 5.75\nFor white out (11,2 \u00b1 585)/12,685) = 1.585\nFor student use (11,2 + 1,475)/12,715 = 9.333\n\nThe second way of doing it is taking the sum of the rations for each category and find the equivalent ratio for that sum. This approach will result in the same answer. For this approach, we simply add up all the rations, multiply them by 100, and do division by 100. \nThe sum will equal $11,2 + $11,2 \u2248 $22,4\nThe 100 multiplied by the total sum will equal", "answer": "E: class room"}

{"text": "In this context bed, sleep, music, stretch, and stop-worrying mean the same thing, or could be considered synonymous. Therefore, the correct answer is bed.\n\n### Clarification:\nThe question asks what the passengers did and what a passenger did. The verb of the question is \"were\" which means the other passengers were doing what the question said, not what the passengers did. There is no \"were\" verb in the question, but it means the other passengers were going to stop worrying and then listen to music, instead of go to the bathroom or get food because they were too scared. The passengers are scared, not the music. There is an \"are\"- verb, but it is not used in this context, and we know the passengers were not actually doing what the passengers did.\n\n### Input A passenger stopped worrying. How? Choice a - got back on the bus.\nChoice b - ate some food c. got a drink d. listened to music e. tried not to think about the police.\n\n### Response A passenger got back on the bus, and listened to music. The other two options are not on the list, and the passenger is not worrying about other things. If they stopped worrying about the police, they would have gotten back on the bus or tried not to think about it. The verb in the question was \"were scared\", which refers to the passengers getting back on the bus, or listening to music. The passenger would not stop worrying, if they already listened to music, and stopped worrying about the passengers. Therefore, the correct answers are c and d.\n\n### Choice a. A: got on the bus. B: Ate some food. C. got a drink.  \nD. listened to music. E. tried not to think\n\n### Clarifications:\nGetting back on the bus, can be a response to getting off a bus, but it could also be getting back on the bus because the passengers are getting back on the bus to listen to music. Eating food would be when the passenger got off the bus and got food. A passenger would not get back on the same bus, eat food, and listen to music, or try not to think about the passengers. If the passenger listened while going back on the bus, then that would be an option. This would not mean, stop worry", "answer": "C: listen to music"}

Right, that means that you learned it in steps which is equivalent to the question \"how?\" since you are asking how you learned it and the answer to that question is how? which means in this case small parts. And what did you learn it with? For example, you have memorized a small part of the song and then after memorizing the small part you add another small part to it and then once you achieved that add on a third part to the end of it. Now that you have added on another part to the end then you add another small part from the begining in which you will add it to the end. And how do you know when you are done? Well, as you are doing this you ask yourself if you know at least 1500 words of the song right? 1500 is the size of the song to be in your head. After doing this for a moment or so and then you say that you know the song. And do you feel it? Yes, there is a chance it could be in your head, but maybe there is a small part that you don't know it all of yet or 100% which means you don't know the song completely.

The different levels are\n- The Edge\nThis level is simply when you do your best and the game will be as good as you make it.  That being said, the more time and effort you put into the game, the more it will mean to you.  It takes up time and has effects on you mind set.\n\n- Skills\n- Wanting to win\n- Friendships\n- Rivalry\nAll of these different levels will have different effects on you.

Friendship\n   \nExplanation:\n\nAs the question explains, people want different things out of competition. Most people want to win the games, which means they are competitive. Others may only want to develop skills or just participate in a hobby. Some players play for the fun or the friends only.\n\n### Coding:\n\nI first made an if statement that would have the program ask for the players initials (the first word) and their age (the second word) of the players name.

I used the switch and case statements so that no matter how many people are playing in an event, I could have multiple things for every switch statement.\n\n### Demo:\n\n- Here is the demo:\n- This is what the program will ask for to start.\n- First player has to enter their initials, then their age\n- Then it will ask for the second players things\n- Then third\n- And so on\n\n- When the program reaches a certain stage, like player 4, the program will start to check who won.  The checker will say it was the person to write the least code.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n- If we had a program that would make a baseball game without you doing any code, this is what it would be.", "answer": "A: edge"}

If you talk to a musician, then you can be certain to learn more about music.\nBook: It's like looking at a dictionary.  If you read a dictionary from front to back then you would know more words.\nPlaying piano: If you play a piano then you're likely using your piano ability more often, while still using the piano skill.  Also, you can learn to play piano if you never have.\nStudying engineering:  If you read an engineering book, you're likely to learn new things about engineering.  If you study an engineering book, then you are expected of greater retention of lessons, therefore using the concepts better.\n\nOutput: Types of engineers: It is logical that music engineers and industrial engineers wouldn't ever have to play piano.  Those types of engineers already have and use pianos for their work.  It's unlikely that a music engineer has to use piano, instead, using a computer to record music or sing.\nAlso it's unlikely that music engineer need to play piano, because they have work to do if they're listening to music and practicing songs.\nLikewise if you're an industrial engineer then it's unlikely that you'd have to play piano too.

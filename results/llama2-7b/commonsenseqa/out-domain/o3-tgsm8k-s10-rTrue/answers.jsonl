{"text": "The answer is B: mexico\n\n\n\n### Instruction:  Please use your best judgement to determine the correct order of the code, the correct number of iterations, and the optimal value to get the desired output.\n\n# Instruction:Write a program that computes the total cost for a grocery list of items based on the pricing structure. The grocery list items and their costs are given as a set of strings, each list item being a string of length 5. The first 4 characters in the string describe each item, and the last character determines the price of the item. A zero in the last character price represents free, while any other character represents a cost associated with that item. Lists of items can contain letters and numbers. For example, assuming that the second entry in our example input is the cost for 1 bottle, the third item costs a total of 1205. If the items are represented as a list of tuples, the first string, price and total are determined from the second-last string, the list index of tuples. The cost for the first item will always be zero (assuming it does not require other items). If an item requires other items, the total cost is calculated by multiplying the previous item cost by the previous total cost (the last character should have a non-zero value). For example, assume that the first item in our example input is a 1. Then, the third item would cost a total of 1 with the previous total cost being 0. Then the fourth item would cost a total price of 1.0 x 1.0 = 1.0 so the total cost for the 4 items would be 1.0 + 1.0 = <<1.0+1.0=2>>2. As an aside, this problem asks for  the solution to be performed in Python's builtin decimal library in Python 3.0.\n\n## Examples:\n\n### Input:\n\"apple,1,apple,0,apple,0,orange,1\"\n\"\"\"\nOutput:\nThe cost for the apple is 1 and it does not require any other items.  So the total is 1.\nThe cost for the orange is 1.0 since it requires one apple to get it.  The cost for the apple is also 1.\nThe total cost is", "answer": "D: atlas"}

The man started talking to the owner of the farm who said to him that the other cows were happy to be milked because the owner was treating them well.  Why would the man be worried?\nOutput: The man is worried because he thinks there is no point in treating one cow well and letting the other cows suffer. If the owner was doing this to make profit/keep all cows healthy then the man would not be worried\n\nOutput:  The man's concern is not about treating the cow well, but about making the cow produce more milk.", "answer": "B: hear sounds"}

Let's round every digit, starting from the right. The first digit is odd, and the next one is multiple of 5 and can't be the same as the previous -1 digit. The last number is not even, and there exists a number smaller than it. It might be helpful if you saw what  all the previous numbers were.  The numbers are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25, 28, 29, 31, 32...  I'll explain when the first digit is odd and the last number is even, then the first digit is even and the last number is odd.\nOutput: If the first digit is odd  and the last number is equal to  2 we should round it to 2. This happens because the first digit (1) is odd and the last digit 2 is even, so the first digit has to be even  (2). This means the first digit was even. This is just a continuation of the last case.\nIf the first digit is odd   and the last number is Odd then we  should round it to 4 because the last digit (9) is odd so the first digit (10) has to be even(4) so 8 is the first digit.\nIf the first  digit is odd    the last number is even   then we round it to 8 because of the last digit it had to be even so we end with digit 8. The first digit is even  so the second digit can not be the previous digit. So it has to be 6 it was even so it has to be odd. The third digit has to be a number smaller to it we have 0<4<8<6.

Find the profit for each box so the store reaches $150 more money.\nOutput: The total profit they need before breaking even is 150-3.99=$<<150-3=146>>146\nAnd each box of pencils costs 3.99\nSo each box they want to sell costs $<<3.99/150=<<26/150=1.73>>1.73\nSo they need to sell 20*1.73=$<<20*1.22=24.6>>24.6\nSo the final answer for this question is 24.6\n\nInput: Adam has the choice of going to a city hall or a park.

She's reducing 25% so the total is 100 - 25 = 75.  The English class average is 68%, so she's multiplying it by 68 and dividing it by 100 since we are looking for 10 points, giving us 51% of the points in English.  In Math, the average is 54%, so she multiplies by 54 and divides by 100, giving us 22% of the points that she's taken away, giving us a total of 33% being removed from the test.

Because the cashier must issue at least a whole dollar, he received a total of $1,088, which is made up of 4 $25's, 4 $10's and 2 $5's.\n\nInput:The number $x$ is divisible by 4 unless it begins with the digit 3.  Is the integer divisible by 30?\nOutput: The integer x is divisible by 3 if 4 is a factor of x.\nSo the answer is divisible by 7 because 30 can be expressed as 7*4\n\nInput:I think \"331\" sounds better than \"133\" because we tend to leave off our last digit when we use \"1\" as a prefix.  The reason is that \"1\" is the least and most common digit.  If \"1\" starts the number, we tend to leave it off when speaking.  So do we when calculating numbers in our heads.  But we are inconsistent because we rarely leave off 8 when \"eight\" or \"eighty\" starts the number.\nOutput: Because 1 is the least, it is most commonly used,\nSo most of us are used to leave off our last 1 when using \"1\" as a starting number\nFor this reason, we are more likely to use \"131\" than \"133\",\nHowever, we leave off our last 8 when starting with \"eighty\" or \"eight\",\nFor this reason, \"181\" and \"1808\" is more likely to hear than \"178\"\nThe number \"18\" is also most likely to be used in the \"one\" position of our decimal point, such as \"1.8\", \"18.9\", and \"189\" is more likely to use than \"1.18\", \"118.9\",", "answer": "A: appear suddenly"}

{"text": "Choice E is correct\n\n# Part Two: In this part, you need to give the exact solution for the multi-step problems.\n# Input: You are going to fly to the Dominican Republic in 7 months and 20 days.  You are planning on going every other month, every third month, and every fourth month.  How much money do you need to save by next November to buy your plane tickets?\nOutput: Let me break down the work this way:\n1. You plan on going every other month. So 7 months = 7 * 2 = <<7*2=14>>14 trips\n2. You plan on going each third month, this gives << 3*14>>3 extra trips\n3. You plan on going the remainder each fourth month, which gives << 4*14>>4 extra trips\nSo the total you planned on going is << 14 + 3 + 4>>14+3+4=21\nSo 14+3+2=<<14+3+1=20>>21trips\n4. Now it cost $1,000 to fly each way. So 14+3 = $<<14+3 = 17>>17 one way\n5. So the total cost for flying is $17*21 = $<<17*21=387>>387 one ways\n6. Now $387 divided by 120 days = <<387/120=3.25>>3.25 bucks per day\n\nInput: You have three different types of meat.

{"text": "She's inviting everyone over and what we're going to do is we're choosing from a set of options. And if we use it, then we put the number 1 on the end.  And when we do that, let's say for example that, we had 7 out of 5 choices A, B and C, D, E and F.  So we put the one on the end, we go with the first number 1. Or let's say, for example, we had three options and we were choosing from E or G then we put that down somewhere. E is our first choice.  The second one would be G and the third one would be what?  So those would be our options.  And so on and so forth through our five choices.  So 7/2, so we've got five options. We need to pick two of those.  And when we're looking at this, we can also see that the number value has added up to 14, which might be a reasonable idea to use. So if we use that value to calculate some possible answers for us, let's see if all of our options might work there. And so, E and B could work. G and B could work. E and D could work, and so on. And if it happens that all our options work, let me just tell you what, let me just tell if each one of them works. So E and B would work since 7 to 2.  What about G and B? The two of them would not work. There are no three letter combinations where each letter is different. So we need to exclude E, G. Let's use D instead of G, and just use those two letters. Same thing with G and D. There are no two letter combinations where each letter's different. Let's use E B instead. And if we do that, we find out, we find out that our values are quite small and it doesn't look like anything else is going well. So that means that our answer is E and B.", "answer": "C: entertain"}

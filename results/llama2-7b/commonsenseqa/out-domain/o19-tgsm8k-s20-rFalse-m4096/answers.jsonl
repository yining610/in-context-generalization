You do not need to read the files, just submit the expected outputs for the given questions. You will be evaluated based on your outputs only. The inputs, as long as they are valid, are given with each question.\n*If you are confused with the instruction about input formats for question 6, please read this instruction (from http://stackoverflow.com.

This means that if your script receives arguments, the arguments must be the same Python objects every time.

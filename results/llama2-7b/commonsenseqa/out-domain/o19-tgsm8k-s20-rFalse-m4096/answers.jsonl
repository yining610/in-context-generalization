You do not need to read the files, just submit the expected outputs for the given questions. You will be evaluated based on your outputs only. The inputs, as long as they are valid, are given with each question.\n*If you are confused with the instruction about input formats for question 6, please read this instruction (from http://stackoverflow.com.

This means that if your script receives arguments, the arguments must be the same Python objects every time.

There are a few options to store multiple inputs:\n\n1. As a single input separated in multiple lines or multiple lines (just as the program says).\n2. As a single input (separated by commas).\n3. As a single array (separate by semicolons).\nThese ways are the same, except the third one - because the user inputs are separated by semicolons, we need to keep the number to which the input refers in the first position, and then just store the input directly.\nAlso in the last question there is a trick - the input is already separated by commas, and the output depends on how many questions the solution has - if the user inputs 5+ questions, the answer will be 4, and so on.\n\nAs always there are some questions that have an obvious solution, but I thought it would be fun to give some more complicated examples with many steps or with some thinking required.\n\nAlso, the last few questions require a special treatment, because the user inputs are already separated by commas - so the most simple way is to extract the numbers with a simple number-to-number conversion.", "answer": "A: being understood"}

According to that he will call his dad for 45 minutes and his brother for 31 minutes, so total time to call will be 76mins. Local call charges 5 cents/min while international call charge 25 cents/min, Freddy will spend 3.8 cents (76 mins x 5 cents = 3.8 $) for local calls and 90 cents (76 min x 25 cent = 90 $) for international call. So 90 cents + 3.8 cnets = 93.8 cents. Freddy will spend 93.8 $ in total.\n\nInput:12 = (8 * 5.5) + (10 * 5) + (20 * 4.5)\n\nInput:Therefore, 76 = 2 * 24 + (3 * 20 + 2 * 10)\n\nThe final answer is 76 = 48 + (6 * 20) = 76\n\nInput:Final solution is 3 + 64 = 67\n\nInput:16 + (2 * 90) = 108 = 16+1 + 2 + (90)\n\nInput:We're going to use this formula to calculate 900 - 720:\n\n\\[\\sqrt{1629*2^{9}}\\]\n\nWhich is equal to \\(\\sqrt{3054604^{9}}\\)\n\nWe can notice that \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) is the nth power, and \\(\\sqrt{\"}\"^{X}\\) is the X power.

{"idx": 482, "text": "A\n\n### Instruction:\n\nThe solution to the instruction is to check if the number of candies is greater than 15. If it is, then this means that, you can subtract 24 from the number first and then subract 8 from the remaining number.\n  Let us call the number of candies N after we added or subtracted the values (24 and 8) above. We can see that the candies would be counted as (81-35) instead of (16-8).\n  The values added and subtracted should be in the range of 0 to 23 and 0 to 7. If it is out of range, then subtract it. If it is in range, subtract it.\n\n### Instructions:\n\nWe can see that Local calls do more in term of calling time than International calls does. If Freddy called 31 minutes in total (including International call), we can see that he spent a total of 3 times 5 cents = 15 cents in total. Where as if he just did local call, he would just paid 5 times 5 cents which is 25 cents in total in 45 minutes. This means he is more better using International which only pays 25 cents instead of local call which pays 3 x 5 cents = paying 15 cents for 45 mins. The total cost of calls should only be 45+15=60 which is total cost of call.\n\n###Instructions:\nWe can see that this is the sum that he needs to consider (5.5 + 5.5+ 5.5) which gives you the total average time spent per day. So, to answer the question, since the total working time is 24 hours, divide the total sum by 24 to get the average number of time.\n\n### Input:\nWe can see the statement says 'Larry had 800 books. Which means he has 40 books of each (800 / 20) on Monday, Tuesdays, Fridays. We can see that his total working time is 12 which means he spends 8 hours of Monday and Friday.

You do not need to read the files, just submit the expected outputs for the given questions. You will be evaluated based on your outputs only. The inputs, as long as they are valid, are given with each question.<n>*If you are confused with the instruction about input formats for question 6, please read this instruction (from http://stackoverflow.com. I think some of the content of this instruction is not relevant, and there are differences in the question and this instruction, but I think what is relevant here is clear):<n><n>"[Python] string (Unicode) objects are immutable, which means that they can't be modified. This means that if your script receives arguments, the arguments must be the same Python objects every time. However, the script is free to return different Python objects every time it is run.<n><n>This behavior can lead to some fairly weird consequences, particularly if you are trying to determine what a string is composed of.

On every return, the ball must also be returned.  However, the players are limited to return either one or two "sideward" hits.  That means, for example, if a player has the ball near the end of the court but wants to return it toward the centre of the court, she can only return it one time to the side instead of directly to the centre.  Whenever she makes two consecutive returns to the side, she is not permitted to return the ball to the centre.   How many different ways can each player keep returning the ball to the partner, and so scoring a point, each and every time the ball is returned to them?  Note that they need to keep doing this indefinitely if playing a tie-break.<n><n>

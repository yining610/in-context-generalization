When creating a computer program, you have a list of instructions and operations that are performed to achieve the desired result. If you are trying to achieve a 2-D drawing of a house, a graphing program would be appropriate. If you want to know if you won a trivia game, a trivia app would work. Each programming language is suited to achieve a set of tasks. In this case, Camp Half-Blood is the name of a fictional place. For example if I wanted to create a game simulating something like this in JavaScript, it would be an HTML game that would serve as a reference point for learning.<n><n>### Inputs: What will be the input and how is it used? Choose a specific program and what kind(s) of output it produces.<n><n>### Response 1:Computers have to be told what to do and what the outcome needs to be, so without a program that is written, there cannot be any output as the outcome is set to null on the computer itself. The process of creating a program to achieve the desired output comes with challenges. The hardest part is figuring out which data processing tools are necessary for accomplishing your goals.<n><n>### Outputs: If a computer cannot output anything, how might you expect the program to print?<n><n>### Response and Additional Outputs: 3 outputs: In a case like this one, if a computer is told that to program, it does not matter what input is given.<n><n>### Challenged: If there was no internet, would you use the same type(s) of input and output, or would you change your inputs and output?<n><n>### Input and Response: The internet is how we send and receive information. It's what we use to send information to the computer and receive information from the computer. As such, there would be no such thing as a programming program without it, but there could be

It is important to note that input data is never part of a program’s code. In fact, a programmer has almost no control over the type, quantity, or format of a program’s input data. A good rule is, “Write programs to be robust to invalid input.”<n><n>### Conclusion 1:<n>Input validation means that you write programs to verify the incoming input data and reject invalid input. This task gives you an opportunity to practice implementing your own system of input validation.<n><n>### Input 1:<n>Input: For example, you need to know how many sticks of butter to purchase. Choose the option that is closest to the price per pound of butter at your local grocery store.<n>Answer: 4<n><n>### Input<n><n>Input: The following code asks the user to specify the price per pound for butter.<n><n>`console.log("What is the price per pound ($) of butter at the store where you shop?")`<n><n>Answer: The price is $2.37 per pound<n><n>### Response<n><n>Input: You decide to write a program to compare the different prices per pound at stores around town. First, you must determine the price per pound at your local groceteria. To do this, ask the user how much a pound of butter costs, input that into a variable, and then display that information.<n><n>### Solution :<n>

If Betty has 2 orders to deliver and she completes each order in 5 minutes, how many orders can Betty deliver in an hour?<n><n>### Response- In order to make $180 in an hour, Betty needs to complete 180 transactions. That comes out to 30 orders in an hour.<n><n>### Explantion- Betty takes only 5 minutes to complete each order. To get money, Betty needs all the time she has to get 5 orders per hour. The solution is to get 30 orders per hour. This is because you have to make 180$ in an hour so multiply the 5 minutes it takes to complete each order by 30 orders per hours and 30 orders per 5 minutes, so the total time is 30x5 = 150 minutes or 2.5 hours.<n><n>### Answer: The solution is A the other answers are not possible because, temperature cannot be dropping further, nor increase. So A: drop to zero is the only answer that fits the scenario.<n><n>### Just like the sun, heat can be rising but not dropping.

Explain your answer. b) What are the first four terms of the sequence 143, 149, 151,...?<n><n>### Answer:<n><n>a) We can obtain the sum of the last 3 terms by simply adding the next three terms.<n>Since 3+5+7+ (n+1)=n(n+1), we need to find n, which is the sum of the sequences. The sum of the first three sequences is 17, so n=17.<n><n>The general formula to sum n(n+1) is 1/2 n(n+1).<n>If we subtract the next three terms, b/a. We need to know bn+3-a+3 = a, so a=128.<n><n>c) The first term is 143. The general formula to sum a sequence is (a+dn)/d, where n is the number of terms.<n>We want d=4, and a=143.<n>The sequence we want is 143,49,51,...<n><n>### Input Answer:<n>The first number of the sequence is 3: choose a) or b).

Choices:  A: air B: water C: earth D: space shuttle E: tunnel<n><n>### Response:		<n>Input: B<n><n>### Rationale:A:<n>The atmosphere is called air. Water: not enough oxygen is dissolved in water to sustain animal life. Earth: oxygen was present during Earth's formation. Space Shuttle: Oxygen is used for fires, lighting and explosives.<n><n>### Rational B:<n>It is most likely inside a tunnel. If you’re outside, you’d be breathing the surrounding air, not just the stuff being piped into the tunnel. It is most likely underground, as the air tends to go down more than up, which means less oxygen there. If you were aboveground, you’d have more oxygen just from the open air.<n>

Choices:  A: knife wounds B: buy a gun C: bleeding D: jail time E: law suit<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>### Input:"Mary is so hungry that she could eat ten large pizzas."   Mary is so hungry that all she can do is think about food. Her stomach has shrunk to the size of a gnat and now has a hunger meter on it.  How much the stomach needs to feed before it can digest a bit of food? Choice:1.23 pounds 240 calories<n>- A person with a medium stomach can eat a large pizza in one sitting. However, if they only eat a very small amount of it, the brain sends an SOS signal to the stomach. The stomach then gets out the scales and puts on a sieve, measuring the amount that was eaten.<n>- This is why a medium stomach eats large pizzas with a few bites. The brain tells the stomach to send the message that there is too much food. <n>In other words, if you take a big bite of pizza and then stop eating, your stomach will start to empty itself out and it will produce the signal.<n>### Response:"Medium stomach" can handle large pizza in one meal.<n><n>### 2. What happens when the brain receives the signal that says we need to eat something?<n>- It tells us that we need to have some food.<n>- When this happens, the brain shouts the message to the rest of the body.   But if it only says "Eat!", nothing will happen. The stomach wants to hear the "Mmm" from the lips. <n>- Why? The sound "mmm" is just like a meal for the stomach. It is like saying "Hey Stomach! Take a bite!"<n>### What was Mary's hunger meter on?<n>- Her level was low.  Her brain sent the signal and her body said:  "Take a little bit more."  So Mary's level of hunger increased to the level of a normal person.<n><n>### Input"Brian is in a dark, cold place. He turns on the light, which hurts his eyes and ears. He then hears the sound of ice cubes falling on the floor." What did he discover after those events?<n>- He discovered that his eyes were closed

Choices:  A: happen to people B: hurt people C: happen anytime D: happen often E: happen anywhere<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is:<n><n>> Answer: B) hurt people<n><n>### Exploration<n><n>> When I think of when accidents happen I can think of a car wreck, a fall down a flight of stairs, a trip and fall accident, or my favorite, being hit by a car in a crosswalk. I can’t help but wonder why this is such a prevalent thing?! What is it about the modern era that causes us to have such a high number of accidents, and/or a higher number of people being hurt by accidents? Is it because we all work long hours and the stress and lack of sleep we get due to that can contribute to our impaired judgments and poor decisions? Or is it because the stress increases when we are at work because there is always a deadline and those around you that always push you to work faster and work longer?

The method combines statistics, computer science, information retrieval, and artificial intelligence. The first phase of data mining is data collection and preparation.  Data mining focuses on the collection of relevant data and its cleansing to ensure data quality.  The data is then transferred from its original format into a specialized data form that will allow for data processing and analysis. Data mining can take place either on an offline system on a data source that is not connected to any other systems, or on an online system on a data source stored in a relational database management system (RDBMS).<n><n><n><n><n><n>

The result is the same when you multiply it by three. You can double it. What is it?<n>-Choices: A: 4 B: 5 C: 7 D: 8 E: 11<n><n>### Correct answer (A, B or A, C)<n><n>### Instructions:The question was, "Can you figure out the math?"<n><n>### Input:"You must figure out what math question is on the other half."<n>### Response:"What is 3 - 2 + 2?"<n><n>### Instuctions: What is the best solution to the problem: "Find an integer such that 0 < x < 5 and x can be divided by 2 and 4 without leaving a remainder with equal remainder."<n><n>### Input(Problem): Find the integer x such that 0 < 5 and x = 2y + 4 for some integer y.<n>### Solution: We know that x is an integer and is less than 5. So we know that x < 5.<n>We also know that the remainder when x is divided by 4 must be 0. Therefore the remainder when x is divisied by 2 is either 0 or 2. The equation then becomes x = 2y+4. The 2y component must be 0 or 2, since x is an integer. The total of 2y + 2y + 0 + 4 = 2y + y + 4. However, we know this can only be true when y = 0. Therefore the answer to the equation is x = 8.<n><n>### Input("How can you multiply 10 X 30 X 15?")<n><n>### Solution:The first way to go about this is to simply think about each factor and try doing each step separately; 10X30 will be 300, 10X15 will be 150 and then you multiple everything together which will be 15,000.<n><n>### The second way to go about it is to think about it this way; there are 12 numbers total that you are multiplying (10, 15, 20, 25 and 30

Choices:  A: fatigue B: relaxation C: tiredness D: muscle weakness E: losing weight<n><n>### Response:		<n>This is a classic case of multiple choice question, there are six possible answers but one stands out, because this question comes from a real-life situation, here are some ways you can tell this from the question:<n><n>First, This type of question shows a certain way of doing things, it asks a person to answer a question or in this case an instruction. Second, This type of question is a bit complicated, which means that it's a difficult question to answer.<n><n>### Analysis:<n>In the multiple choice format, often there are words that are more often used than others.  These words are often used in a sentence because they are part of a sentence and the sentence will not make sense if those words are not there.<n><n>What we need to watch out for is: a: What words are used that are different and often times the answer that is given to us is different? and b: Do we answer the question or the instruction that is given. Answering the question is not sufficient, you have to answer if the instruction is correct or not.<n><n>You can use [The Crafting Episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L7mH_l8mh8&t=4s), an analysis of the grammar to find out the answer.<n><n>## Question 1<n>First we need to look at the questions and what words are used more frequently in the question. The first word that is used in the question is: "answer" followed by "how much", "would you receive" and "are there". Then in the question itself the word used is: "money" and it's being used more frequently than other words. This word is part of the question because it's the question itself.<n><n>If the question is "how much money are there?", then the answer should have the word "are" in it, which is not used at all. Then it would make sense that "there" cannot be "money". The rest of the question makes sense, the question asked is: how much money Betty and Matthew receive if they pick 16 strawberrys and 30 kilograms of newspaper, then, from this example, you can tell which part of the question needs to be corrected or not.<n><n>The word that is often used is "money". The word "how much" is used a lot but not often in the example itself

I had to use the if statement quite often in order to give all scenarios the right answer, although it is a bit tedious, my instructor made us do it in order to help us to avoid mistakes.  The hardest part of this task was to use the if statement in order to have a variable equal one thing.  The easy part of this task was figuring out what should go in each section of the python code.  My coding for this task went fast, and I only had to look at my code once during the task.<n><n><n>### References:<n>[https://github.com/sahad/code/blob/master/practice.py][Link to Github]<n>

Choices:  A: kitchen B: child's hand C: street D: toy store E: soccer game<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>A: The safest place to get a ball would be the kitchen where the kids are playing with it.

The only way that a volleyball could get lost is dropping it on the floor.<n><n>### Counterargument:<n><n>Answer: My counterargument is that volleyballs are very expensive and they are hard to find.

Water balloons work great in summertime for playing and having fun at any event. A lot of people around use water balloons with their kids for fun in summertime.

Choices:  A: hatred B: surprised C: compliments D: dedication E: solutions<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>This is a tough one, but let's try anyway!<n><n>**A**<n><n>A lot of the time people get focused on something because they have something bigger that matters; either to them or someone/something in their life. In order to make that something better, they need a lot of  "hatred", but that's pretty close, and  "surprised" has some good qualities. The last 3 are hard, but I think what the person was trying to get at with  focus is  "solutions"!<n><n>**B**<n><n>It's hard to say, but you can't be dedicated to something without some good luck, so I suppose it's B? I think you need dedication to something, but that's not what the person is saying, they're saying that the person who has "hatred" is lucky. In the end, a lot of great people have a good combination of  "compliments", "dedication" and  "focus"!<n><n>**C**<n><n>Dedication to something is what is more rare here, and that would explain why you are more likely to  "have luck" when you are lucky and  "have something to hate." This one is really tough.<n><n>**D**<n><n>I can definitely say that this is correct. A person who is great at what he/she does must find the answer to all of life's questions, and that is having "solutions" and having them easily, so "dedication" to that is where you get lucky.<n><n>**E**<n><n>I guess it could fall into this one, but it's more obvious that luck is important too. A person needs "dedication" AND "solutions" and sometimes a person might be "complimented" for something, and they are able to find "focus" and it's the combination of those things, which is the  "luck."<n><n>### Input answer in bold:<n><n>John is a professional chess player.

The set of real numbers is, in fact, an infinite set (it has more members than any countable set).  When it comes to infinities, all numbers that are not rational numbers are considered to be irrational numbers.  Irrational is also the only characterization that the whole set of real numbers can have.  All other sets I have seen only have one or two properties.  (Can you think of an example of a set that has more than one property?  For example, the set of integers might have infinite divisibility and evenness.)  If it is true that numbers that are not rational are irrational, does that then mean that rational numbers are irrational numbers?<n>

The while loop loops through the first instance of the variable "number." <n> 2. The first "if" loop, checks if the variable "number," is equal to or greater than 80 and the second "if" checks if the variable "numbe" is less than or equal to 7.<n> 3. A single input is 49 in the "if" statement, but the variable is an integer and can only store whole numbers so that number cannot be stored. The integer variable becomes positive, so the program is not able to reach the first check<n> 4. The first "if", the variable "number," must be zero, so it is always false and the program jumps over to the "else" block and sets the variable "value" = number.<n> 5. A simple variable, "number," is created to store the user input. The number 1 must be an integer, because all integers must be whole numbers, and it must equal or greater than 8.<n> 6.

Once you start out with your command (in this course, it will probably be a computation or an expression) the command is repeated as many times as a variable specifies, usually x. For example, let’s repeat Hello, my name is... twice.<n><n><n>```<n>say (1 + 1) * Hello<n><n>greeting (1 + 1)*Hello<n>```<n><n>Note that the command starts with an exclamation mark. That means it is treated like a statement. A line that starts with something other than a letter or number (ex. "hi") is usually a statement because computer languages consider commands to be statements. It is a statement, because in this case it is the repetition of the expression (1 + 1).<n><n>## How could this task be accomplished without loops?<n><n>Just repeat your command over and over. The following example repeats the command six times.<n><n>```<n>say 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6<n>```<n><n>## TASK<n><n>### You can use this command to repeat a command six times.<n>```<n>say 4 + 5 * 5 + 5 * 4 + 5<n>```<n><n>## You can use this command when you know you are going to repeat a command more than five times.<n><n>### If you use this command, you can repeat your command any number of times you like.<n><n>### Now, try it out for yourself. Use say to write a line that repeats something six times.<n><n>## Example<n><n>### Using a variable<n><n>Now let’s try to repeat a command using two variables instead of one. If we do this, we have to say something different each time. Let’s write a line

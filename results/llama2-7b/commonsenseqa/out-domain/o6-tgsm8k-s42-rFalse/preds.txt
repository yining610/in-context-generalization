We want each one to have a choice so we must create another string that has each one as a string with 4 options, a,b,c,d,etc. Then we need to insert all options into our string so we create a new string that will hold the question and also we need to create a string name to be the variable we would call the user question.<n><n>## #Solver:<n>Our program starts it by loading the values from the input into a variable. The first value we find the second one is the questions variable name name. Then we insert a question into  the second variable. We want the second variable to accept the question and we add the choices into the question variable variable. We put a space in between each choice to make it easy to read the options, at the end of every option we want to place a point so the user won't make a question for a choice. When user enter question we will be looking for the question variable, if the question entered from user matches the variable than we put it in a list, later at the end of program when we need to print the list we can call print option and print list.<n><n>### Example:<n>```python<n>question = input("What is a grumpmat person likely to have?"<n>for choice in ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E" ]:<n><n>	question = option + " " + str(choice) <n>for choice in list() <n>print (" ", option+str(choice))<n>```<n>## Author:<n>Nasim Amini<n><n>## Contributors:<n>Ahmed Fazli<n>Daniel Arias Mori<n><n>## Contact for questions:<n>Amini_Nasim5@live.com

But a particular colony in Antartica is only 500. How many penguins in this colony?<n>> ><n>> > **Solution:** I’m thinking this is probably a big colony for a baby penguin. But let’s see what a giant mama penguin thinks. Every mama penguin in the colony is going to get a little egg and put it in a baby penguin’s hand for feeding, which is why they are 5 times the size of a human. So I am going to use 5 as a variable to represent the number of eggs in the colony. Therefore, the number of eggs is equal to 500, 000 x 5... **I have a hard time remembering how to add fractions and I am in high school what do I do?!** Well, add like regular numbers and then use it to solve the multiplication: 2500,  and now I multiply 2500 x 5 and see that it equals 12, 500. And I solved my problem!!!! This is what a variable is. I have decided that x is my number.<n>

It is small, dark and far from any other offices. You feel like you are in the mail room.<n>* You hate the furniture, which feels like you are in a library and is too small for your new office.<n>* You love commuting by bicycle, but now that you live farther away, you have to drive. This is also costly since you no longer get a free work place parking.<n><n>#### Is there anything else in the proposal that makes your new position acceptable? No, you will be spending the same amount of money every month.<n><n>### [Revision History](/Revision History)

Her plan was to make a pill that would make the person taking it feel like they were doing the exact same thing each time. For example, if you took the pill, you’d feel like the most normal thing for you to do would be eating cereal and milk, if you had the pill on you would feel like you should be reading a book, or if you had time for a hobby you would feel like your hobby would be baking something, or taking the pill would make singing in a chorus seem natural. There would be times when the feeling wouldn’t come automatically, and you would have to spend time thinking about what the pill was telling you to do. You would do all these things normally, as if to reassure yourself that there was no magic at play. If you didn’t do these things for long enough that the feeling came naturally, you’d start to feel confused, and you’d end up either doing one of these things or doing nothing at all.<n><n>### Question:<n>What was the feeling the scientist was going for with her pill?<n><n>### Response<n><n>### Instructon:Which of the following statements about the experiment are true?<n><n>### Story explanation:The scientist's experiment can be used in order to prove that her feelings were normal.<n>### Instruction<n>### Question:What was the one thing that always happened with the pill?<n><n>## Question<n><n>### Response The one thing that always happened:<n><n>### Instuction:Which of the statements above are true?<n><n><n>### Question<n><n>### Answer:<n>

Choices:  A: restaurant B: basement C: all buildings D: carpet E: synagogue<n><n>### Response:		Answer the following multiple answer question.<n><n># Solution:<n>In all these problems you will be dealing with various kinds of integers. They can consist of either positive or negative integers, or a combination of both. Positive integers are non-negative whole numbers, negative integers are integers that have had a minus sign placed in front of them. This will make these numbers all integers which will not be integers without the negative sign.<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>In the first problem we are given that for every 12 can you recycle you will recieve $0.50 and for every 5 kgs of newspapers you will recieve $1.50 if your family collected 100 cans and 30 cans of newspapers how much money would you have made. In this we can see that this would have totalled 144 can and 40 kgs of newspaper. $0.50 for every 12 cuns and $1.50 for every kgs of newspapers. We then have to work out the total of the amount we will get paid for all these amounts together.<n><n>This is all the amounts together in the sum, which is the total amount we will be rewarded for this job. This means that $0.50 100 times and $1.5 40 times. To get all these amounts together we would need to add 100 and 40. These are all our amounts individually that we will be rewarded from this job<n><n>### Solution<n>In the second problem we are given that Betty picked 16strawberries. Matthew then picks 20 more stawberries then Betty and 2 times the amount of Natalie. To make the jam the 3 of them used their strawberies that they picked to make the jam. One jar of jams uses 8 strawberries and jars that they sold each cost $4. How much will have made from the strawberrys they collected.<n><n>We have now made the 1st jar of jam and so we are able to see all the items we used to make this. We then notice the 4 of us only used 16 strawlerries. To make 1 jar we used 8strawberries. We then notice we have used 16strawberrye  so now we know that each jar

Use the products and sum to create two different equations, one of which will describe the difference between the 2 numbers and the two other equations will state  the relationship between the 2 numbers.  Use the number line to solve for these two equations.  Use the numbers 3 and 5 for your equations.The first equation: The sum of 3 and 5. The difference (3 - 5) will be the difference. The product of 3*5 will be the product. The difference (3-5) will be the sum. The product of 5*3 will be the Product.A second equation: The difference of 3 and 7. The product of (5-7) will the difference. The difference (3+5) will be the product.The third equation: The difference between 3.5 and 5.5.  The product (5*3) will be subtracted from 3.5 to get the difference. The difference 3.5+3*5 will be subtracted away. The product (3*8) will be added to 5.5 to get the change.The last equation:The sum of 3, 5, and 7.The difference (3-5-7) will be subtracted away from the sum.The product (3*7) will be multiplied against 5 to get the product.<n><n>### Input II<n>### Response II<n>Input:For these division problems you will be given the remainder.  The divisor, or number that is divisible, will be the difference between 1 and 9.  This remainder will be the difference between the divisor and itself. This remainder will be the remainder for these problems.The first problem: The remainder will be subtracted from the difference between 6 and 10 to give you a number that the divisor is subtracted from.The second problem: Subtract the remainder and the divisor from the difference between 5 and 10 and you will obtain the answer.The third problem: Use the difference between 7 and 3 to reduce the remainder to the divisor and then subtract this remainder from the difference.<n><n>### Your Task<n>Write a function that will

Choices:  A: employment B: frustration C: stress D: working hard E: love<n><n>### Response:		<n>### **Your code**<n><n>### **Expected Output**<n><n>### Important information <n><n>In this task, you'll need to:<n><n>- Create a loop to iterate the desired number of times<n>- Print a string, including a for/while/do statement and a while statement or statement in a for loop<n>- Include two user prompts<n>- Display a menu for selecting an item<n>- Calculate and display a result<n>- If a user requests an increase in the number of repetitions, calculate and display the increase<n>- If a user wants to exit the loop, terminate it<n>- Include an “Exit” option in the menu to quit the program<n>- Print an announcement that the program is ending<n><n>### How to complete the task<n><n>- This task is a simple way to get students used to the idea of a loop. There's not a whole lot of instructions, so you can assume they'll start with the prompts. The prompts ask for the number of times each option should repeat. They'll first repeat that number and then increase the number of repetitions every time. They'll end it once a user decides to quit.<n>- They'll probably print each command line prompt (“How many times should each command repeat?”) using the `print()` command.<n>- Then, they'll print each of the menu options (“Please make your choice. What would you like to do?”), using the `print()` and `echo()` commnds (the `echo` command is the same, but the `print()` command sends to the console).<n>- If they get a valid response, such as 3 or 4, they'll execute the corresponding prompt command (with `for` commands or the `repeat` keyword, respectively). The `repeat` keyword simply restores the loop to its original state after it's done iterating.<n>- After the loop is restored back to its original state, they can determine the next action (which will depend on which menu item was selected).<n>- They'll find the end value of each repeat command by either subtracting the number previously printed, or by adding the number printed after `repeat` in other cases.<n><n>### Example<n><n>To see an example of the task, see the [example](examples.md).<n>

Choices:  A: train station B: house C: cupboard D: cricket stadium E: surface of earth<n><n>### Response:		<n>There are many places air can be found that has been breathed only by a few people recently. An easy to breathe example of a place that has been breathed in by many people recently is the public bathroom because it is often open to most people. Another way to figure out if a place is recently breathed by very few people is to look at the calendar on a wall or in the newspaper. There are more than just a few places where air has been breathed by many people recently. A train station would be a good example of a place that was not too long ago breathed by only a very few people because you can often see a lot of people walking through train stations frequently. If there are a lot of people in a house then it is likely that air in that room has recently been breathed by many more people than in a cupboard because it is used by the people in that house all the time. Even though cricket stadiums aren’t used all the time by many people, because cricket is a widely popular game, the air in that stadium has most likely breathed by a lot of people who attended a cricket game or used the stadium in the past. Likewise, Earth is the perfect place to breathe because people all over the world breathe.<n><n>### Input:(7 + 35 + 19 × 1) / 12 =<n>### Response:The answer to this problem is 18. This problem is best explained with variables. Let ____ stand for “(7 + 35... + 19 ×...);” and ____ stand for “/ 12 =.” First, we will set ____ equal to something, like 25 and then let _____ stand for the answer to the same problem (with ____ equal to 26). So, ____ =25. The question asks to plug in the variable ____ into _____. Because ____ = 25, we add in 25, which is 50. We then take away 50 from the first part of the equation which would leave the number 0. Then we take away the fraction 12 from the second part of the equation which leaves the number 3, which is the answer. We can simplify this equation by using “/” as one variable and using it as either the divisor or the dividend. This is because we do

Choose the statement or statement pair that does not describe a scientific process.  1. Evolution is a scientific process. A group of scientists in New England are using the scientific process to study how beavers modify the ecosystem around them. The beavers are making new beaver dams in order to establish new habitats on the river. The scientists are using cameras to observe the beavers. After watching, they can then predict which dams the beavers would be unlikely to build based on past observations. This is a good example of 2.  Biologists in Texas have used a genetic process to identify a particular type of fruit fly.  Since it only flies indoors, this type of fruit fly is only known to live in apartment buildings, and thus is fairly unique. Scientists have been using the scientific process to see which buildings the fruit flies are likely to live in. This has given them a large amount of data on what type of pest they are dealing with.  When a scientist applies the scientific process, there are many opportunities to make errors. In the experiment to track beavers, the scientists are likely to 3.  make error.  In the experiment tracking biologists, the biologists 4.  make use of both evolution and genetics to analyze the data.<n><n>### Response:(SAT question) The following statements present two different views on which approach to studying science is better. They are NOT all equally valid - choose the statement that is most convincing. 1. Evolution is based on random changes caused by natural selection. Biological science requires a great deal of careful observation and analysis. 2. Evolution theory has no evidence to support it. The scientific method requires careful observations in order to test scientific theories. 3.  Some biological organisms must be studied as complex living systems in order to develop a comprehensive theory of evolutionary biology. A biologist who believes evolution is wrong is not doing science. 4.  If someone is looking into the behavior of humans, they cannot consider that they have free will.

It’s been a year since we signed the papers, after a grueling couple of weeks on the hunt and a trip to the closing attorney. You’re glad the day has finally arrived, but have some questions. Why is the check made out to “banker?” What can you do if there’s a problem with the amount? What happens to the money after you’ve paid it? After reading about the payment process below, you’re a pro.<n><n>### Response<n><n>The banker is the actual human being at the bank where you go to deposit and withdraw money. The paper checks that are written out by the banker can have special instructions added to them that may indicate they can only be accepted by the “banker” and not the teller. The check is then mailed to the appropriate branch to be recorded and deposited in the appropriate account. If there is a problem with the amount, then it will need to be resolved with the bank or a professional bank examiner such as those that work with the FDIC and other regulatory agencies. The money that is placed in the account after the payment is made is actually the debt on the house and does not stay at the bank. This money is either used to pay down the debt owed to the bank or paid to the borrower to reduce any accrued interest on the loan.<n>### Question:<n>Which item doesn't work in the sentence: "the money that is placed in your account after the payment is _____?

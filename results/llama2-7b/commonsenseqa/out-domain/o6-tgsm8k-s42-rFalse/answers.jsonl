We want each one to have a choice so we must create another string that has each one as a string with 4 options, a,b,c,d,etc. Then we need to insert all options into our string so we create a new string that will hold the question and also we need to create a string name to be the variable we would call the user question.\n\n## #Solver:\nOur program starts it by loading the values from the input into a variable. The first value we find the second one is the questions variable name name. Then we insert a question into  the second variable. We want the second variable to accept the question and we add the choices into the question variable variable. We put a space in between each choice to make it easy to read the options, at the end of every option we want to place a point so the user won't make a question for a choice. When user enter question we will be looking for the question variable, if the question entered from user matches the variable than we put it in a list, later at the end of program when we need to print the list we can call print option and print list.\n\n### Example:\n```python\nquestion = input(\"What is a grumpmat person likely to have?\"\nfor choice in [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\" ]:\n\n\tquestion = option + \" \" + str(choice) \nfor choice in list() \nprint (\" \", option+str(choice))\n```\n## Author:\nNasim Amini\n\n## Contributors:\nAhmed Fazli\nDaniel Arias Mori\n\n## Contact for questions:\nAmini_Nasim5@live.com", "answer": "A: headache"}

First, we substitute 12 for every place that `v` appears in the expression. Next, we substitute 20 for every place that `k` appears in the expression and recognize that there is a variable that represents all of the letters that come after \"m\", since every place that `k\u00b4 appears the variable appears too.

Yes, your salary is now almost $6,000 higher and will increase in the future. (In the future it will become more expensive to commute by living farther from work.) In addition, the new job description requires less responsibility and allows you more free time since your old job was very demanding.\n\n#### What problems does your new position give you?\n* Your new work space doesn\u2019t feel right. It is small, dark and far from any other offices. You feel like you are in the mail room.\n* You hate the furniture, which feels like you are in a library and is too small for your new office.\n* You love commuting by bicycle, but now that you live farther away, you have to drive. This is also costly since you no longer get a free work place parking.\n\n#### Is there anything else in the proposal that makes your new position acceptable? No, you will be spending the same amount of money every month.\n\n### [Revision History](/Revision History)", "answer": "C: happiness"}

{"text": "Answer the following multiple answer question.\n\n# Solution:\nIn all these problems you will be dealing with various kinds of integers. They can consist of either positive or negative integers, or a combination of both. Positive integers are non-negative whole numbers, negative integers are integers that have had a minus sign placed in front of them. This will make these numbers all integers which will not be integers without the negative sign.\n\n### Solution:\n\nIn the first problem we are given that for every 12 can you recycle you will recieve $0.50 and for every 5 kgs of newspapers you will recieve $1.50 if your family collected 100 cans and 30 cans of newspapers how much money would you have made. In this we can see that this would have totalled 144 can and 40 kgs of newspaper. $0.50 for every 12 cuns and $1.50 for every kgs of newspapers. We then have to work out the total of the amount we will get paid for all these amounts together.\n\nThis is all the amounts together in the sum, which is the total amount we will be rewarded for this job. This means that $0.50 100 times and $1.5 40 times. To get all these amounts together we would need to add 100 and 40. These are all our amounts individually that we will be rewarded from this job\n\n### Solution\nIn the second problem we are given that Betty picked 16strawberries. Matthew then picks 20 more stawberries then Betty and 2 times the amount of Natalie. To make the jam the 3 of them used their strawberies that they picked to make the jam. One jar of jams uses 8 strawberries and jars that they sold each cost $4. How much will have made from the strawberrys they collected.\n\nWe have now made the 1st jar of jam and so we are able to see all the items we used to make this. We then notice the 4 of us only used 16 strawlerries. To make 1 jar we used 8strawberries. We then notice we have used 16strawberrye  so now we know that each jar", "answer": "E: synagogue"}

{"text": "### **Your code**\n\n### **Expected Output**\n\n### Important information \n\nIn this task, you'll need to:\n\n- Create a loop to iterate the desired number of times\n- Print a string, including a for/while/do statement and a while statement or statement in a for loop\n- Include two user prompts\n- Display a menu for selecting an item\n- Calculate and display a result\n- If a user requests an increase in the number of repetitions, calculate and display the increase\n- If a user wants to exit the loop, terminate it\n- Include an \u201cExit\u201d option in the menu to quit the program\n- Print an announcement that the program is ending\n\n### How to complete the task\n\n- This task is a simple way to get students used to the idea of a loop. There's not a whole lot of instructions, so you can assume they'll start with the prompts. The prompts ask for the number of times each option should repeat. They'll first repeat that number and then increase the number of repetitions every time. They'll end it once a user decides to quit.\n- They'll probably print each command line prompt (\u201cHow many times should each command repeat?\u201d) using the `print()` command.\n- Then, they'll print each of the menu options (\u201cPlease make your choice. What would you like to do?\u201d), using the `print()` and `echo()` commnds (the `echo` command is the same, but the `print()` command sends to the console).\n- If they get a valid response, such as 3 or 4, they'll execute the corresponding prompt command (with `for` commands or the `repeat` keyword, respectively). The `repeat` keyword simply restores the loop to its original state after it's done iterating.\n- After the loop is restored back to its original state, they can determine the next action (which will depend on which menu item was selected).\n- They'll find the end value of each repeat command by either subtracting the number previously printed, or by adding the number printed after `repeat` in other cases.\n\n### Example\n\nTo see an example of the task, see the [example](examples.md).", "answer": "B: frustration"}

{"text": "There are many places air can be found that has been breathed only by a few people recently. An easy to breathe example of a place that has been breathed in by many people recently is the public bathroom because it is often open to most people. Another way to figure out if a place is recently breathed by very few people is to look at the calendar on a wall or in the newspaper. There are more than just a few places where air has been breathed by many people recently. A train station would be a good example of a place that was not too long ago breathed by only a very few people because you can often see a lot of people walking through train stations frequently. If there are a lot of people in a house then it is likely that air in that room has recently been breathed by many more people than in a cupboard because it is used by the people in that house all the time. Even though cricket stadiums aren\u2019t used all the time by many people, because cricket is a widely popular game, the air in that stadium has most likely breathed by a lot of people who attended a cricket game or used the stadium in the past.

So, ____ =25. The question asks to plug in the variable ____ into _____. Because ____ = 25, we add in 25, which is 50. We then take away 50 from the first part of the equation which would leave the number 0. Then we take away the fraction 12 from the second part of the equation which leaves the number 3, which is the answer.

In this program you will be inputting both strings and numbers into variables. **You will not be using for loops, while loops, or if statements in this program.** \n\n### To use:\nFirst, create a class by extending the __str__ method from the Python programming language. You need to get the user input and print it out. Your job will be to ask for an integer and then print both the integer and a message that says how much we multiplied by.\n\n### Challenge:\nOnce you are finished building the class, you need to make sure your program prompts the user for a string. Your program will be responsible for taking both a string and an integer and calculating how much of the string a specific number of characters long the number of times. You will need to test your program and be able to write some meaningful print statements to test your work and make sure everything is working.\n\n### Additional challenge\nWrite your own version of the __str__ method.\n\n### Note:\nThe following methods will be used in this exercise:__str__, integer, and string.\n\n### HINT:\nIf you don't know how to extend __str__ and the other methods, you can visit [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python).\n\n### Solution:\n```python\nclass MyObject:\n\n    def __init__(self, my_string: str):\n        self.__objString = my_string\n\n    def __str__(self) -> str:\n        return self.__objString\n\n    def multiplication(self) -> str,float:\n        multiple = input(\"type in the number of times the object should be multiplied: \")\n        \n        if multiple <= 1:\n            return \"\"\n        \n        if not multiple < 1:\n            print(\"wrong input\")\n            \n        object = MyObject(multiple)\n        \n        print(object)\n        print(str(object))\n        multiply = int(object)\n        \n        multiple_", "answer": "E: rocks"}

This might not always be the word 'first', however, so it might be better to say that a key question in each has is 'which has never happened before?'\n\nFor the rest of the questions, it's worth noting that each word in the question, has two words before and after it, so you can use this to help identify the key word.\n\nFor the first question, 15(2 + 6) + 3(3) + 2(2) = 12\n\nThe next question is a bit trickier!

{"text": "B\n\n### Input:(SAT question) Two of the following statements describe scientific processes. Choose the statement or statement pair that does not describe a scientific process.  1. Evolution is a scientific process. A group of scientists in New England are using the scientific process to study how beavers modify the ecosystem around them. The beavers are making new beaver dams in order to establish new habitats on the river. The scientists are using cameras to observe the beavers. After watching, they can then predict which dams the beavers would be unlikely to build based on past observations. This is a good example of 2.  Biologists in Texas have used a genetic process to identify a particular type of fruit fly.  Since it only flies indoors, this type of fruit fly is only known to live in apartment buildings, and thus is fairly unique. Scientists have been using the scientific process to see which buildings the fruit flies are likely to live in. This has given them a large amount of data on what type of pest they are dealing with.  When a scientist applies the scientific process, there are many opportunities to make errors. In the experiment to track beavers, the scientists are likely to 3.  make error.  In the experiment tracking biologists, the biologists 4.  make use of both evolution and genetics to analyze the data.\n\n### Response:(SAT question) The following statements present two different views on which approach to studying science is better. They are NOT all equally valid - choose the statement that is most convincing. 1. Evolution is based on random changes caused by natural selection. Biological science requires a great deal of careful observation and analysis. 2. Evolution theory has no evidence to support it. The scientific method requires careful observations in order to test scientific theories. 3.  Some biological organisms must be studied as complex living systems in order to develop a comprehensive theory of evolutionary biology. A biologist who believes evolution is wrong is not doing science. 4.  If someone is looking into the behavior of humans, they cannot consider that they have free will.

My name is Amelia and I'm trying my hand at blogging. I've been writing for quite some time, but I've never actually put my writing out into the world.\n\nWhen I decided to start blogging, I looked into what my competition (if there is even going to be any) was writing about. Some articles were very bland, but some were actually quite interesting.\n\nI decided to focus my blog posts on one of my favorite hobbies; writing. I'll be posting reviews about books, movies, tv shows, and more. I think I'll also incorporate a little personal life sprinkled in there as well.\n\nHopefully you find something you enjoy here \ud83d\ude09\n\n# Blog Posts\n## [What is creative writing and why do you need it?](https://www.blogpost.com/creative-writing-need-it/)\n\n# About\nHello world!

{"text": "Choice D\n\n### Input\n\nIt\u2019s time to make the first payment on the house! It\u2019s been a year since we signed the papers, after a grueling couple of weeks on the hunt and a trip to the closing attorney. You\u2019re glad the day has finally arrived, but have some questions. Why is the check made out to \u201cbanker?\u201d What can you do if there\u2019s a problem with the amount? What happens to the money after you\u2019ve paid it? After reading about the payment process below, you\u2019re a pro.\n\n### Response\n\nThe banker is the actual human being at the bank where you go to deposit and withdraw money. The paper checks that are written out by the banker can have special instructions added to them that may indicate they can only be accepted by the \u201cbanker\u201d and not the teller. The check is then mailed to the appropriate branch to be recorded and deposited in the appropriate account. If there is a problem with the amount, then it will need to be resolved with the bank or a professional bank examiner such as those that work with the FDIC and other regulatory agencies. The money that is placed in the account after the payment is made is actually the debt on the house and does not stay at the bank. This money is either used to pay down the debt owed to the bank or paid to the borrower to reduce any accrued interest on the loan.\n### Question:\nWhich item doesn't work in the sentence: \"the money that is placed in your account after the payment is _____?

{"text": "C\n\n### Instructions: The following tasks demonstrate programming and are based on information you already know. Each task will use basic vocabulary of computer science and will ask you to use an existing function and provide an example usage.\n\n### Task 1: If \"Camp Half-Blood\" was a program, what kind of program would it be?\n\n### Demostrations:\nComputers don't do anything without a program. When creating a computer program, you have a list of instructions and operations that are performed to achieve the desired result. If you are trying to achieve a 2-D drawing of a house, a graphing program would be appropriate. If you want to know if you won a trivia game, a trivia app would work. Each programming language is suited to achieve a set of tasks. In this case, Camp Half-Blood is the name of a fictional place. For example if I wanted to create a game simulating something like this in JavaScript, it would be an HTML game that would serve as a reference point for learning.\n\n### Inputs: What will be the input and how is it used? Choose a specific program and what kind(s) of output it produces.\n\n### Response 1:Computers have to be told what to do and what the outcome needs to be, so without a program that is written, there cannot be any output as the outcome is set to null on the computer itself. The process of creating a program to achieve the desired output comes with challenges. The hardest part is figuring out which data processing tools are necessary for accomplishing your goals.\n\n### Outputs: If a computer cannot output anything, how might you expect the program to print?\n\n### Response and Additional Outputs: 3 outputs: In a case like this one, if a computer is told that to program, it does not matter what input is given.\n\n### Challenged: If there was no internet, would you use the same type(s) of input and output, or would you change your inputs and output?\n\n### Input and Response: The internet is how we send and receive information. It's what we use to send information to the computer and receive information from the computer. As such, there would be no such thing as a programming program without it, but there could be", "answer": "B: getting cold"}

That comes out to 30 orders in an hour.\n\n### Explantion- Betty takes only 5 minutes to complete each order. To get money, Betty needs all the time she has to get 5 orders per hour. The solution is to get 30 orders per hour. This is because you have to make 180$ in an hour so multiply the 5 minutes it takes to complete each order by 30 orders per hours and 30 orders per 5 minutes, so the total time is 30x5 = 150 minutes or 2.5 hours.\n\n### Answer: The solution is A the other answers are not possible because, temperature cannot be dropping further, nor increase.

Her stomach has shrunk to the size of a gnat and now has a hunger meter on it.  How much the stomach needs to feed before it can digest a bit of food? Choice:1.23 pounds 240 calories\n- A person with a medium stomach can eat a large pizza in one sitting. However, if they only eat a very small amount of it, the brain sends an SOS signal to the stomach. The stomach then gets out the scales and puts on a sieve, measuring the amount that was eaten.\n- This is why a medium stomach eats large pizzas with a few bites. The brain tells the stomach to send the message that there is too much food. \nIn other words, if you take a big bite of pizza and then stop eating, your stomach will start to empty itself out and it will produce the signal.\n### Response:\"Medium stomach\" can handle large pizza in one meal.\n\n### 2. What happens when the brain receives the signal that says we need to eat something?\n- It tells us that we need to have some food.\n- When this happens, the brain shouts the message to the rest of the body.   But if it only says \"Eat!\", nothing will happen. The stomach wants to hear the \"Mmm\" from the lips. \n- Why? The sound \"mmm\" is just like a meal for the stomach. It is like saying \"Hey Stomach! Take a bite!\"\n### What was Mary's hunger meter on?\n- Her level was low.  Her brain sent the signal and her body said:  \"Take a little bit more.\"  So Mary's level of hunger increased to the level of a normal person.\n\n### Input\"Brian is in a dark, cold place.

So we know that x < 5.\nWe also know that the remainder when x is divided by 4 must be 0. Therefore the remainder when x is divisied by 2 is either 0 or 2. The equation then becomes x = 2y+4. The 2y component must be 0 or 2, since x is an integer. The total of 2y + 2y + 0 + 4 = 2y + y + 4. However, we know this can only be true when y = 0.

{"text": "This is a classic case of multiple choice question, there are six possible answers but one stands out, because this question comes from a real-life situation, here are some ways you can tell this from the question:\n\nFirst, This type of question shows a certain way of doing things, it asks a person to answer a question or in this case an instruction. Second, This type of question is a bit complicated, which means that it's a difficult question to answer.\n\n### Analysis:\nIn the multiple choice format, often there are words that are more often used than others.  These words are often used in a sentence because they are part of a sentence and the sentence will not make sense if those words are not there.\n\nWhat we need to watch out for is: a: What words are used that are different and often times the answer that is given to us is different? and b: Do we answer the question or the instruction that is given. Answering the question is not sufficient, you have to answer if the instruction is correct or not.\n\nYou can use [The Crafting Episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L7mH_l8mh8&t=4s), an analysis of the grammar to find out the answer.\n\n## Question 1\nFirst we need to look at the questions and what words are used more frequently in the question. The first word that is used in the question is: \"answer\" followed by \"how much\", \"would you receive\" and \"are there\". Then in the question itself the word used is: \"money\" and it's being used more frequently than other words. This word is part of the question because it's the question itself.\n\nIf the question is \"how much money are there?\", then the answer should have the word \"are\" in it, which is not used at all. Then it would make sense that \"there\" cannot be \"money\". The rest of the question makes sense, the question asked is: how much money Betty and Matthew receive if they pick 16 strawberrys and 30 kilograms of newspaper, then, from this example, you can tell which part of the question needs to be corrected or not.\n\nThe word that is often used is \"money\".

Therefore, different countries have different currency exchange rates and the Kenya has one of the worst exchange rates. Kenya\u2019s currency is KES and in the US dollars is KES 96.52 which translates to $1 equal to 96.552 KES. If you have 50.5 US dollars, then in Kenya, you will get KES 4.8763 (50.5/96.55).\nInput: You have $155 in US dollars. The last time I went to Kenya, one US dollar equaled how many Kenya shillings?\nAnswer: 96.43\n\n### Input 2:\nYou have $83.0250.

{"text": "This is a tough one, but let's try anyway!\n\n**A**\n\nA lot of the time people get focused on something because they have something bigger that matters; either to them or someone/something in their life.

The last 3 are hard, but I think what the person was trying to get at with  focus is  \"solutions\"!\n\n**B**\n\nIt's hard to say, but you can't be dedicated to something without some good luck, so I suppose it's B? I think you need dedication to something, but that's not what the person is saying, they're saying that the person who has \"hatred\" is lucky. In the end, a lot of great people have a good combination of  \"compliments\", \"dedication\" and  \"focus\"!\n\n**C**\n\nDedication to something is what is more rare here, and that would explain why you are more likely to  \"have luck\" when you are lucky and  \"have something to hate.\" This one is really tough.\n\n**D**\n\nI can definitely say that this is correct. A person who is great at what he/she does must find the answer to all of life's questions, and that is having \"solutions\" and having them easily, so \"dedication\" to that is where you get lucky.\n\n**E**\n\nI guess it could fall into this one, but it's more obvious that luck is important too. A person needs \"dedication\" AND \"solutions\" and sometimes a person might be \"complimented\" for something, and they are able to find \"focus\" and it's the combination of those things, which is the  \"luck.\"\n\n### Input answer in bold:\n\nJohn is a professional chess player.

The while loop loops through the first instance of the variable \"number.\" \n 2. The first \"if\" loop, checks if the variable \"number,\" is equal to or greater than 80 and the second \"if\" checks if the variable \"numbe\" is less than or equal to 7.\n 3. A single input is 49 in the \"if\" statement, but the variable is an integer and can only store whole numbers so that number cannot be stored. The integer variable becomes positive, so the program is not able to reach the first check\n 4. The first \"if\", the variable \"number,\" must be zero, so it is always false and the program jumps over to the \"else\" block and sets the variable \"value\" = number.\n 5. A simple variable, \"number,\" is created to store the user input. The number 1 must be an integer, because all integers must be whole numbers, and it must equal or greater than 8.\n 6.

Once you start out with your command (in this course, it will probably be a computation or an expression) the command is repeated as many times as a variable specifies, usually x. For example, let\u2019s repeat Hello, my name is... twice.\n\n\n```\nsay (1 + 1) * Hello\n\ngreeting (1 + 1)*Hello\n```\n\nNote that the command starts with an exclamation mark. That means it is treated like a statement. A line that starts with something other than a letter or number (ex. \"hi\") is usually a statement because computer languages consider commands to be statements. It is a statement, because in this case it is the repetition of the expression (1 + 1).\n\n## How could this task be accomplished without loops?\n\nJust repeat your command over and over. The following example repeats the command six times.\n\n```\nsay 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6\n```\n\n## TASK\n\n### You can use this command to repeat a command six times.\n```\nsay 4 + 5 * 5 + 5 * 4 + 5\n```\n\n## You can use this command when you know you are going to repeat a command more than five times.\n\n### If you use this command, you can repeat your command any number of times you like.\n\n### Now, try it out for yourself. Use say to write a line that repeats something six times.\n\n## Example\n\n### Using a variable\n\nNow let\u2019s try to repeat a command using two variables instead of one.

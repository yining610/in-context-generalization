Then, it should ask the user if the input is a local call or an international call. If the user inputs L, then it should increment the total dollars by 5. If the user inputs I, then it should increment of the totalDollars by 25. The program should repeat this until it prompts the user if they are done calling, when the input equals D. If this is the case, the program should add the totalCost, which is the value of totalDollars, to the totalCost.<n>```<n><n># Instruction:<n>> Input : Pete had $1,000 saved up for the party. His friend offered to let him buy him a $30 drink as his contribution to the party budget, and Pete also bought a $15 drink. The party host let everyone pay for their drinks with a single beverage costing $60. How much money did Pete save?<n><n>Expected Output: Pete saved $600 <n><n>### Answer<n>```<n>The total money saved is $600. The program should first get the amount that the user wants to input, which is the amount saved by Pete. Then it should increase that amount with $15, because this $15 is what Pete spent on the beverage. Afterward, the program should decrease that amount by $30, because this is what his friend contributed and this $30 is what Pete spent. Finally, the program should subtract $600, which is the amount of beverages that the party hosted by Pete.<n>```<n># Instruction:16 = (20 ÷ 3) + 7, but why is it false？<n><n>### Answer(Expected):<n>```<n>16 = (21 ÷

Choices: 	A: playing in the bubbles 	B: singing 	C: eating hamburgers 	D: jumping in puddles 	E: going on the swings  <n>Output: D : Jumping in puddle<n>#### Part 2<n>The first input is the length of the string L.<n>The first statement in the print function will print the value of L.<n>The second statement in the print function uses the value L to calculate the sum of odd numbers in L. For example, if L = "12613214" there are three odd numbers between zero and 49 (1+3+5). This value is then printed (after adding a newline character).<n>The third statement in the print function prints the remainder when a value in L is divided by three. For example, 121/3, 45/3 and 14/3 are all values returned from the first statement (which should be a value in L) and these values are the indices of the values above them in the string.<n>The final statement simply prints the length of the string.<n>The first line of input to the second print function will be the second line of input for the first print function.<n>The second line of input to the print function will be the result of the remainder of the first input, as stated above.<n>The value of L is then used as with the first print function. The only difference is the third statement in that it uses the value of L instead. Otherwise, the code is exactly the same as the code in Part 1. However, the code in Part 2 has been simplified. For example, for L = "123456787" there are two values between zero and 7 that are even numbers. Therefore, the function will simply output, by printing, the numbers 1

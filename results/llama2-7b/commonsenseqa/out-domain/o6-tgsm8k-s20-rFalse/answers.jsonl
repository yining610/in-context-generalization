If the user inputs I, then it should increment of the totalDollars by 25. The program should repeat this until it prompts the user if they are done calling, when the input equals D.

For example, if L = \"12613214\" there are three odd numbers between zero and 49 (1+3+5). This value is then printed (after adding a newline character).\nThe third statement in the print function prints the remainder when a value in L is divided by three. For example, 121/3, 45/3 and 14/3 are all values returned from the first statement (which should be a value in L) and these values are the indices of the values above them in the string.\nThe final statement simply prints the length of the string.\nThe first line of input to the second print function will be the second line of input for the first print function.\nThe second line of input to the print function will be the result of the remainder of the first input, as stated above.\nThe value of L is then used as with the first print function. The only difference is the third statement in that it uses the value of L instead. Otherwise, the code is exactly the same as the code in Part 1. However, the code in Part 2 has been simplified. For example, for L = \"123456787\" there are two values between zero and 7 that are even numbers.

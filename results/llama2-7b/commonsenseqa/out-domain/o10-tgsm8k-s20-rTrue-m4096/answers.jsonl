The question is, \"How much toll is there if 3 hours and forty seven minutes was half the time it took?\"\nThe total time it took is 3 hours and forty-seven minutes, or (3 +.25) = (3. 25) = <<3+.25=1.50>>1.50. The question is asking us to solve for x, which equals 1.5/2 = <<1.5/2=3>>3\nThree times the number of hours is 3/2 or 1.5/0.5 = <<1.5*0.5=3>>3. We can write that as either one and a half hours total or a rate of three hour for every half an hour spent going to the airport. The toll costs three bucks per half hour, or $<<3*1.5=4.5>>4.5. Half the time is 1.5/4 = <<1.5/.04=37.5>>37.5, so 3 bucks goes to the toll every 37.5 minutes, or a total of eighty-two and a half dollars.

You must have a pack of season tickets, so you must take the number of packs of season tickets. Since 2x equals season tickets, you can take one from each side to solve for x:\n(Season Tickets) / (Season Tickers + Single Tickets)]\n(Season Ticket Buyers) / 2\nSeason Ticket Buyer = (Season Ticketer + Single Ticket Price) / 2\nInput: There is a contest.

If it was a 7 compartment box there would be two boxes with quarters in them, and they are both on the far left.\nFrom there you would just go to the right and choose the other middle box.\nSince 3 boxes have only one answer, the final answer is 0\n\nInput2: There is a box which has 8 compartments and every compartment is either empty, or contains one coin: 0.10$, 0.02$, 5\u00a2, 10\u00a2, 5\u00a2, 5\u00a2. There is a lock on the box, which is in a closed state. You can open the lock and examine only one compartment. If the coin it contains matches your secret coin of the same type (or is the same amount of money, if you don't know which type it is), then you gain your secret coin. You keep making lock / examine cycles until you either (1) open the box, in which case you earn 100 0,02$ and gain your secret coin back, or (2) open the box, realize that it's not the right box, and the lock is now unlocked for you to check the next compartment.

In ten days, Bob and Cynthia each walked a combined total of 62 miles.  If there were three more of Cynthia and one more of Bob, how many more miles would Cynthia and Bob have walked?\nOutput: For Cynthia to be given 1 point, she had to have walked 62/10 or 6.2 miles.\nSince there were 62 points of combined total after these ten days, 3 points were given to Cynthia and 1 point given to Bob. This means that Cynthia had to walk 3 times more than Bob, and 16.4 miles.\nSo the final result is to subtract 16.4 from 62 to get 45.6 miles added to the combined total of 6.2 to get the combined total to be 62+45.6 or 107.6 miles.\n\nInput: A bird species lives in three kinds of forests.

We also need that each bag can have at most 4 marbles, otherwise with the last bag, he cannot fill it.\nIf each session is 6 hours, we have:\n1) 20/4 = 1+5*6/2 = <<1+5*6=21>>2\n2) 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>1 time the boy can put a bag with 2 marbles\n3) 1*4 = <<1*4=4>>1 time the boy has only 4 bags and cannot more\n4) 15*6/4 = <<15*6/2=25>>25 bags, since each bag can only be filled to a maximum 4, the boy will only need a total of 25 different bags.\nAfter the 3rd session, when the boys will have played all the games with all the friends.\nSo the final answe is 3\n\nInput:A man owned three hens.

How much was their average expenses on gas, food and other expenses for the 2 weeks?\nOutput: They went up in food as we can see when food = 1.5*$45 = <<1.5*$42.5=63.75>>63.75. They stayed somewhat the same on gas which we know from the equation gas = 1.5*30 = <<1.5*32.5=48.75>>48.75. Finally, the other expenses went down by almost half. It costs about 1/2 as much to enjoy the little things in life, as when you eat out for dinner daily. \nSo the final answer was $63.75 + 48.75 + $23.25 = <<63.75+48.75+23.25>>136.75\n\nInput: A 2 liter bottle of soda was $2.50.

If 11,415 took the class we know that 4,427 did not take the class\n\nSo the final answer must be 4,426\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\nInput: There are a total of 361 students in the entire school. 160 take band and 206 take choir. 34 out of the band students play the flute.  70 out of the choir students have a soprano voice.  If 15 flute and 12 soprano students are chosen to audition for a solo,  how many students will be chosen?\nOutput: There are 360 students not counting the 34 band students and the 70 choir students. \nWe can do this in a number of ways. First we have to work backwards:\n\nThe total number of students are 360.\n360 - (((15/160)*360", "answer": "A: break easily"}

As compared to B, C contains fewer cities since B is a subset of C.\nC has a strict population requirement, which means that a city has to contain more than 1 million people to be included in the list.\nSince each Chinese city is not necessarily listed in C, A contains more cities than C.\n\nInput: Which of the below options is the greater number: 1014 or 1115\nOutput: 1015.

This is given by finding factors of each number and multiplying the common factors to obtain a product.  Thus, the largest factor of 3,2584556 is 4 and 884,436. The remaining number of 489 has only one biggest factor which is 889.  Thus, GCF(3,845,889) = 4.  This result will also be a result of calculations that can be performed further.\nAs a result of the finding GCF, 4,325,838 is a divisor of both numbers.\nNow we can perform the division problem.  Since 4,321,838 is 1 less than 4,006,304, we can apply remainder operation to further obtain the answer, 4,274, 848.

So in the first basket there was 677. He then put 1/3 of 677 in the first basket. He added 1/3 to 67 then doubled it to get 679.\nSo the amount on the first basket is now 679. If he puts in 1/3 of that number he takes away a third of 679 to get 4/3 * 679 - which equals 5/3 * 687.5. He then doubles the 5/3 *687.5 (remember 679 was 3/3) to get 10.5 * 5/3 = 27.5.

What is the minimum number of people that must enter the room in order to get 3 people on each door?\nOutput: People need to go into the room (A,B or C) to leave people on opposite doors\nIf a person was to enter and exit room A they would have to leave 7 people on room 2 or 1 in 7 (the 2nd number is the room you want, 1in7 is the room you don't want)\nNow suppose there are 10 people and the rooms have 3 people so there is 7 extra people in the room.  This could happen since we have a 14 number total and there are 4 doors and we still have 1 door open from the start. If both A and B were already occupied then they would be alone and we can keep the people in the room equal. This will not happen with 3 people on a door so there must be an unequal number and the only way it could happen is if the 3 people on A and B left or entered because a person entered room C so the 3 people on either A or B will leave those doors and enter so we can have 3 people on either door\nSo the minimum number of people is 2", "answer": "B: city"}

At what time must I leave to ensure I will meet my sister at 6:05 PM?\nOutput: I must take the train. The travel time for the bus is 15 minutes - which is less than half of the time between the train and the bus and thus is not likely. Then the travel time from the bus station to the train station would be 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = <<1/4+1/2+1/4= 3/4>>3/4 of an hour. Then the total travel time is 3/4 hours + 1/2 = <<3/4+1/12=15/12>>15/4 of an hour or simply 3 hours and 15 minutes.

But after you get Day 61 right, you have 59 days right. If this pattern goes on and every day you know to get each day correct, then you will have 60 days right.\nThe other choices (61-1, 60) are subtracted from the problem, and they will subtract from the end goal and make you get the problem wrong.\n\nInput: On a trip to Alaska, you visit the Kenai Fjords National Park, where you take a boat tour of a few glaciers.

The 2nd glacier is only 2 meters long.   What does this mean?  In this picture, the horizontal axis is glacier length, and the horizontal axis is ice sample length.\nOutput: The second glacier was 2 meters long and the second sample was 1 centimeter long and that is why it is at a much smaller vertical scale.   It would mean nothing to compare the two unless you compare the vertical scale of the picture with each other.\n\nInput: Annie has $30.", "answer": "E: farmer's market"}

The sum of the natural numbers greater than 1 is 2+3+...=13. There are 13 even numbers, 2 even numbers are 2 & 4, so the sum of even numbers greater than 11 is 2+4 = 6. There are 4 odd numbers so the sum of odd numbers greater than 13 is 8+11+13. The sum of all the naturaals greater than 95 is 2+3...+99. Since 100 is an even number, it is not considered to be a natural number, so the sum of the naturals greater than n = (n+2)+2n+n+4+6+16+...\nSolution: First, let the natural number be denoted by x.

If there are 12 people in the group, how many pieces of cake does each person get?\nOutput: The group buys 1/4 of one type, 1/6 another type, and 1/4 of a third type. To divide three numbers into the same quantity equally (e.g. three parts in an equal amount) you start out by having everything lined up in front of you and you find the largest common multiple (LCM) of the three numbers. The LCM of 1, 2, and 3 equals 6. If 1/4 of cake, 1 of vanilla cake, or 1/2 of apple cake all equaled 6 pieces of cake in total, then we could all take two pieces of each cake. (6 * 2 = 12)\n(LCM(3, 2, 1) = 6) Multiply the numerator and denominator of the fraction by 2:\n2/3\n2/6\n2/12\nDivide 12 by the LCM:\n6 \u00f7 6 = 1\nDividing the cake evenly by person is impossible.\nSo the final outcome is impossible\n\nInput: There were 26 passengers on the plane.

In total, he can make two balls per minute, six balls per ten minutes, 13 balls total per hour, and 25 balls per hour. He also has 100 white ball, 50 yellow balls, and 10 green balls. If he only has 30 seconds and he wants to have 60 balls, how many balls can he make?\nOutput: If Mr. Lee has 30 seconds left, each minute is 1/60th of a second.  There are 100 white and green balls, 50 yellow and green balls, and 60 green balls total.  Therefore, he would need to make 60 white and green balls.  There are 60 minutes left in the activity. Since there are 60 minutes and 60 objects, he can make one ball per minute. Since 13 = 6*2/3, he can make six blue balls per ten minutes, which is 1/10 of one ball every ten seconds.  The total he can make (including green balls) in 30 seconds is:\n\n1/10 green ball (10 seconds) + 1 green ball (10/10 seconds) + (1 white ball + 1 green ball) (10/60 seconds) + 50 yellow and greens balls (10/6 minutes) + 60 green balls (60/60 minutes) = 10 + 1 + (50/2 + 1) - 5 \nIf he only makes white and green balls, he must make white and green balls until he makes six balls, which would take exactly 60 seconds.  Therefore, he must make white balls, green balls, and then white balls again. Altogether, he is able to make exactly 30 balls in 30 seconds.\nSo the final Answer is 30\n\nInput: A biker must get to the town in 24 hours or die of thirst.

Since the percentage of death of police officers is a percentage of 84,000 (10000.02), and there's a 10% percentage increase, the police department will need 1000 fewer people (5000*.84), so they will need to make 50000 - 5000 - 1000 dollars less\nSo the final answer will be 136000 - (50000+5000-50000)= 18000\n\n### Instruction:Answer a multi-part math word problem.\n\nInput: A bag contains 18 cookies. 7 of these are ch", "answer": "B: big house"}

How much will the family pay if they buy one pair of shoes back for discount?\nOutput:ABC is the first pair, and they are purchased for $12.\nThey are given a discount, and since they are only allowed to purchase one pair, they no longer have this option, so they have to pay $12 for the shoes, which is $12.\nDEF is the second pair, and they are sold for $14.\nThey are now not allowed to purchase two pairs of shoes at a time, so they must pay $14 to be given a similar discount. So they will pay for $14 as well.\nGHI is the third pair, and they are being sold for $5.\nThis pair, however, is being sold for less than $10, so the owner must give a $10 discount for it, and since it can only be bought once, they are left with $5.\nSo they will pay $12 + $14 + $5 = <<12+14+5=31>>31 in total.\nAs this is not an arithmetic problem, 31 is the correct answer.", "answer": "D: wash dishes"}

There are only three answers:\n\nA: cupboard - The word \"cupboard\" refers to a piece of furniture where one keeps various items: dishes, clothes, and food. It does not refer to storing or setting one device inside of another. Thus, the teakettle would not go in a cupboard, rather it would be found in a kitchen cabinet. This is inaccurate.\nB: countertop - This answer is incorrect because the word \"countertop\" refers to the top of a counter or desk where one sets appliances. The teakettle would be placed underneath the counter or drawer.\nC: water - C is referring to a water container. It may be used by a ship, it may be used in an aquarium, it may be used by fish in a fish tank, but in no part does the question refer to placing a tea pot in a water reservoir. This answer is incorrect.\n\nD: hardware - This answer is also incorrect because it refers to all things that belong in a hardware store. There is no reason to store things in a hardware store; you only go to a hardware store to purchase objects. If you are looking for a teakettle, you will not find it there.\n\nAnswer: E.

Since they would only be able to use one eye in each eye socket the same information that their other eye was getting they couldn't see two different perspectives from each eye at the same time because they would only see blurry images.

One friend is the captain of the team and is not playing. The captain selects either her left- or right-handed friend to play on her team (the chosen friend is referred to as a friend\u2019).

How many games must be played if there are five friends and they are captain at the same time on 5 different teams?\nOutput: A: The last question should have been: \"The winning team also depends on the final checker move (either a winning move or not a winning move): If the losing team\u2019s checker makes a winning move on their final turn (the losing team would have been captain if they won), they are simply the Captain\u2019s Team and there is no Captain.\"\nI agree with user1712312 here: \"the winning team is determined *only* based on the final move(s) made after the players have run out of options.\" However, it doesn't mention that the Captain's Captain friend is not playing so all the final winning positions are covered.\nB: There are several games that can be drawn but it appears to only count the winning team that is the winning captain (captain and friend are both playing so the captain is captain still in this situation).

The total number of dogs is 1 less than 2 less than the total cats.  How many dogs and cats are in this shelter?\nOutput: To figure out the total number of dogs just subtract 7 from a number so that 7=<<7=3>>3.\nTo figure out the total number for cats add a number to the result so 3=<<3=6>>6. (Add 3 to itself and continue to carry the value over to each addition value.)\nOnce you have the total number of cats, subtract 7 - 7 and that gives you the total number of dogs which is 3 - 7 = <<3-7=(-4)>>(-4).\nNow to find the total of all of the cats and dogs you add the totals. 6 + (-4) = <<6+(-4)=-2>>-2\nThere is a minus sign before the 2 because when you subtract you subtract from 0 so that 7 - 7 which yields 0 and it must go back to negative.\nSo the total is equal to -2.

In your new problem, if you give a different baker a different set of tasks, you could find a place to make bread. If 4 workers would take 50 minutes total, you could use 2 people to bake bread. Since you would also need ingredients, you could bake bread at home if you had enough ingredients, but there wouldn't be too many ingredients.\nWe can find one at home by baking in the oven for an hour. We need 30 minutes to shape the dots, 15 minutes to bake and cool and 15 minutes for ingredients. 30+15+15 = <<30+15%2B15=50>>5. If you need 50 minutes to bake, you need 2 people, and if you need 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 minutes to bake, and if you need two to equal an hour a total of 50/2=<<50/2= 25>>25 ingredients if you need to bake, and ingredients are needed to bake, then that is at home with many ingredients, but you still need two people to bake the bread.\nSo the final for this exercise is at home in an oven\n\nAnswer the following question with 123 points.\n\nInput: John wants to get his car tires checked.

How many oranges were left for 5 oranges and 7 people?\nOutput: At first we know that there was 12 people who had 10 oranges to share between them. Then we know that the 7 oranges were split up across 6 different people. This means that the 6 people received 7 oranges each, so we need to subtract oranges from the 7 to get the amount each person got. So it would be 7 - 7 = 0. Now we know that we do not have 5 oranges and half the population. Therefore, we know that there is 5 oranges and the other half of the original population. So we need to multiply the 0 oranges by 5 and divide the amount by 6 people. That will allow us to answer the question and get 0 x 5 / 6 = 2\nSo the final answer was 2\n\nInput : You eat breakfast at a restaurant. You need to place your order to get food on your plate.

The store sells ice cream cones for $3 but if you buy two ice cream cones, you are charged an additional 25 cents. If you buy one ice cream cone you are charged an additional $1.\nSo what is the cheapest price if one ice cream is bought?\nOutput: If each cone costs $3 and a single cone is marked up by 25, then the charge for a single cone is $3+25=<<3+25=28>>28 cents. And a single charge for an ice cream cone is 35 cents.\nIf an ice cream cone costs $2 and two ice cream coned are bought, each will be marked up an additional 25cents/2. Adding a $1 mark up to the total of the price, the cost of two ice cream coners is $2.25+1= <<2.25+5.25%2B1=44.25>>44.25 cents. So in total each ice cream cone costs 44.25+$22.5= $<<44.25+22.5=66.75>>66.75 cents. Since the largest amount of the charge is 66.75, ice cream cones cost that much.\nSo the final price is 66.5\n\nInput: I bought 1/10th of a pizza. That's a $2.50 investment.

A 2-room party rental costs $500. What is the per-room cost of a single room, 10-person party rental?\nOutput: Since the cost of a single-room party rental is $400 when booked 2-weeks in advance but is only $350 when booked 1-week in advance, the per-room cost is $350 divided by 2 or $175 per room\nThen the per-room rate for a 2-room party is $500 divided by 2 for $250 per room\nSince a 10-person single-room party costs $400 when it is booked 2 weeks before the party, the per-person cost is $400/10 = <<400/11=30>>$30\nSimilarly, a 10-people 2-room party costs $500 when it is rented 2 weeks before the event, so the room costs $500/10 or $50 per room\nAdd the person cost and the room cost for the single-room party and we can see that the cost is $30 + $50 = <<30+50=80>>$80 per party\nAdd the person cost to the room cost of the 2-room party and we find that the cost is $50 + $250 = <<350/10=35>>$35 person per room + $50 room per room\nSince it costs $80 person cost + $35 room rent, the per room cost for a 10-persons is $80 + $35 = <<80+35=115>>$115\nAdd the person cost of the two 1-room parties together to see that we have totaled $80+1", "answer": "B: shower"}

This leaves us with choice E, human body.\nSo the final is the human body\n\nInput: How many ways can you arrange 12 distinct letters to make up 3 words?\nOutput: Well first of all let's make sure we're clear on what exactly a 'distinct' letter is for purposes of this question.  For example, the letter 'R' in this context is considered 'distinct' from a 'T' to mean that it can't be replaced by a 'T' in each word.  That way, we know that: \"RTTTTTRWY\" is actually still one word and \"RTLWRW\" would not be.\nSo now knowing that, you can split one of the letters and start the first word with four letters.  You can use the other ones to make the second word.  So for the first word, you can use these four: R T T T.  For the second word, you can use the remaining seven: W Y R T T T.\nSo far that leaves you with eight words, which now you just have to combine together to make three words.\nFor three words, you can start with either a R, T, or W for the first word and put any other letter (Y, R, T, or T for this example) in the last spot, or vice versa.  Then take the other eight letters and start with T, W, or R for the second word, leaving the final spot open for them to use the remaining letter.  You can then use the the other six letters to use the other one to use for the third word, again leaving the final spot open.\nThis leaves you ten choices, because you've already used the four letters at the beginning of the first word, and the choice to use Y or just R in the third word.\nSo the final result is: 10\n\n# Solution: \nTo make the dictionary there had to be some sort of organization system for the words.

Choices: 94,000.54 94,024.25 94,014.15\nOutput: Since the Packers are now in the SuperBowl, their salaries should probably not be released until after the team has won, but if you do have access to them, you can calculate the salary by taking the total amount of players on the roster and multiplying the salary by 2.34, then adding in the bonus of 4%, which is 2.34 * number of players * 102 +.04*(100+number of players).\nThe question asks for players on the team on December 26th, 2007. There are 45 on the team. We multiply 102*45 which equals 4570 then add.04(45070) and we get 4691.04, or rounded to the nearest hundredth, 4691\nInput: what is the lowest grade on a 2", "answer": "B: wet ground"}

To get a total of TWO cups Mary would add two cups, her entire recipe book, and use the whole recipe for baking\nTo get a total of ONLY THREE cups,  Mary would add THREE cups, one cup from Sarah and use the whole recipes\nTo get a total OF SIX CUPS, Mary would add SIX cups, two cups from Sarah's and Sarah's entire recipe\nAnswer A:  To get a total OF NINE CUPS,  Mary would add NINE cups, two cupes from Sarah and Sarah's entire cookbook.  Since each book has a half recipe, each person will not be over the recipes half recipe rules\nAnswer B:  Since there is a FULL INGREDENT RECIPE in one book and a half recipe in the other book, each person only has ONE TWENTIETH of the recipe\n\nInput: There was a 2003 model car accident that took place and was found by a news reporter.

If a box of candy canes weighs 2 pounds, how many pounds (1 pound= 16 ounces) will you be sending all around the school?\nOutput: Since there are 26 students there must be 26 boxes of candy canes. Each box of candy cane weighs 2 lbs so 26*2 = <<26*2=52>> 52 lbs\nEach pound of candy cane consists of 16 ounes so: 52/16 = <<52/16=3>>3 pounds per box\nSo in total there are 3 lbs/(box * box number)\nIn total there are 3*52/(1*(box number) (52/(1*(4/4))) = <<3*(52/(1*(52)))>>352 lb\nSo the final answer must be: 352 lb of candy canes\nSo the final answer will be 352 lb.\nSolution:\nSince there is a box of 16 candy cane and it weighs 26 lb we know that each box is 1(lb)/16(candy canes)\nSo we need the fraction to be 1/16 then: 1/16 = <<1/16)=1\nSo we need to find which fraction is 1\nSo we do 1", "answer": "E: office building"}

Each time water goes into it, there is more dirt. Water never goes in the urn, so there is no clean water.\nBy option C, the urn starts off with water in it, so there is no dirt and then at the end, the clean water is still clean water with no dirt.\nSo the urn should start off with a full container of clean water.\nSo the final decision is C.

After adding 1, she added a number of cups. Then she subtracted one from the second number and added one to the first number. What is the equation for the second number after adding the first number?\nOutput: The equation is\n(1 + s) = first number + s cups\nThen\n(s+1) = first number + (s-1) cups\nSince we've found the equation for the n number, now we have to get the equation for n+1 number.\n\n(s+1+1) = (s+1)-1 = ((s-1)+1) + 1 = ((s-2) +1) + 2 = ((s-3) + 2) + 3 =...\n(s+1 + n + 1) = ((s-n) + (n+1)) + (2x+3) is the equation for n+2 number which is the second number in case of sienna\nSo the final answer for n+2 number is ((s-n) - 2 * n+5 + 3) + 5\n\nInput:: A bus can transport 50 passengers.

One person can cook 10 foods for 30 people, and the second can cook 5 foods for 15 people. However, if you have the second cook cook 2 foods with the first cook, will you need to buy more?\nOutput: The first caterer can make 10 foods and serve a meal for 30 people. The second caterer can make five different foods and serve a whopping 15 meals. Together, I think people can serve 5 people meals if all 10 or 5 foods are given the first caterer or the second caterer, respectively. However, if the first and the second caterer serve meals, I need another 5 foods. This is because all the original 5 foods can serve less than 10 people. If someone who can serve 10 gets their food with someone who can serve 2 foods, it takes 8 foods to feed 10 people. However, if we give both the first and the second person 5 foods among them, we have enough to give 5 people 2 meals.\n\n* * * * *\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\nx=$1\ny=$2\noutput=$3\n\nif [[ \"$output\" -eq \"-1\" ]]\nthen\necho $1\necho $2\n#echo \"inputs are: $1 & $2\"\n(( $x + $y ))\n(( y/$x ))\n(( x - y ))\n(( x + y ))\n(( (x=$(-z)) ))\n(( (y=$(-z)) ) ))\n(( $y + $x ))\n(( $x - $y ))\n\nelse\necho \"wrong input...\"\nfi", "answer": "A: health club"}

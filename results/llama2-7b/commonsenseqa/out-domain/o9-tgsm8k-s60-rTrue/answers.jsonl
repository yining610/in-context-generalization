Choices:  I: rising II: setting III: at its highest IV: close to the horizon  \nV: far from the horizon\n\n### Rationales:  The moon is at its highest when it is far from the horizon and at its lowest when it is close to the horizon. The moon rises in the east and set in the west when it is close to being at its highest or lowest. The moon rises over the horizon towards its highest point. The moon sets in the west, opposite of where it rose over the horizon, towards its lowest point.\n\n### Response answer: The moon is close to the horizon\n\n## \n### Input A fruit seller has 3 kilograms of grapes. He gives away 2 kilograms to his friend. He sells 2 1/4 kilograms to a customer. How many kilograms of gaps does he have now? Choices: II 2 1/3 kilograms of III 3 3/4 kilograms of IV 3/4 kilogram \n\n### Rats: He has a few options that he can do with grapes. He can either share some with his friend or to sell to a customer. He will not share any more than what he can hold in his hands or less than \u00bd the amount of the grapes he has. He will sell no more than 1/4 less than the amount he originally has. So, the sum of these options is 3 x 1/2 + 2 1/2 x 1/4 - 2 1/ 4.\n\n### Final answer: 3.0", "answer": "D: rose garden"}

She does not need as much time to walk back from school since it is half as far away. The total time it takes them to walk to school is 30 minutes. How much longer does Pete's sister take to walk than Pete to walk?\n\n### Rationals: The answer is 40 minutes, because his sister takes 30 minutes to walk to school, so the time it takes her to walk to school is (30 - 15). She walks to school half of the time Pete does, because she walks twice as fast. They both walk 15 to school so the total time they take to walk is 15, because they walk to school together (30 - 30 minutes, which is 0 minutes, so they walk to school together). Pete's sister walks to school one half as far as Pete. So, she walks to school an extra 15 minutes. Thus, 30 - 18 = 12, Pete's sister takes 2 extra minutes to walk to school. Since Pete's sister has been walking 15 minutes, so she takes 13 extra minutes to walk back, it is 40 minutes.\n#### 40\nAnswer: Pete's sister starts walking to school 1 minute earlier.

Pauline pays 1200yen for apples and chocolate bars and 11000yen for bananas. They all have 1510yen.

{"text": "Answer choice E is the correct answer. When you throw a rock into a river, it creates the biggest splash at the surface of the water or the ground. The earth provides friction, so the rock will land on it and create a splash.\n\nThe mountains countryside, the bridge, and the mountain range only have an impact on the surface of the earth.\n\nThe choice can be determined by the reasoning above which states that when you throw a rock on rock or some solid item (such as a bridge), the effect on the surface will be minimized and it lands on the rock or object making the sound or vibration smaller.\n\nTherefore, answer choice E is the correct response.\n\n#### E\nAnswer: E\n\n### Input. Pete's dad has a collection of rocks as he travels, and he has five types of rocks: 1. Smooth. 2. Worn. 3. Odd-shaped. 4. Colorful. 5. Large. Pete has two of each rock type in his collection. All of Pete's rocks have been labeled with the type of rock they are and the number of that type of rock in his collection. Which type of rock does Pete have 5 of?\n\n### Response. Answer choice E is the correct choice.\n\nThe number of \"Odd-shaped\" rocks that Pete has is \"5 * 4 * 3\" according to the problem. Since odd shapes can never be counted as even in any amount, the number could not be two unless one was a duplicate. Additionally, since Pete's rocks are each labeled, there can be no odd shaped one by accident. The answer could not possibly be \"Odd-shapped\".\n\nThe number of smooth rocks Pete has is also \"5 * 3\", and according to the rules Pete would not have more than 2 smooth rocks. Therefore, he could not have 2 \"Smooth\" rocks.\n\nThe number \"1\" indicates the number of \"Worn\" rocks Pete has, and the number \"5\" indicates the number of colorful rocks Pete has. The problem states that \"1\" and \"5\" cannot go in the same slot, so \"1\" must be wrong, and therefore, the answer is \"4\"\n\n#### 4\nAnswer:", "answer": "C: bridge"}

Let us subtract 26 from 24: 24-26 is 2.\nNow let us substract 2 from 31, to get 29. Since we have the same problem, we might have more or less cars (with a different number of cars). We cannot proceed without finding the smallest number of cars, but we are not looking for the largest number of cars.\n\n#### 2\nAnswer: 2\n\n# Problem Solving-Categorical Statements\nIn order to find an unknown value ( x ), a", "answer": "C: desk"}

You spend most of your time in the park until last month when you began training for the local marathon on May Day. You will spend some of your time training at the park, at the train station, at the marathon, and at the market. How many hours do you spend at the park?\nRationales::  In the park, we subtracted 5 since the park is 5 hours.  But since you used to live in the park and you just moved to the city center, you will still have to live in the city center. So you took off 2 since that is the city center, the same way you subtracted 5 for the park. So you subtracted 5 + 2 = <<5+2=7>>7 from 20.  So your hours spend in the park are only 20 - 7 = <<20-7=13>>13 hours. \n\nInput: Answer the following multiple choice question with your own letter.

The second number cannot have a negative value greater than its positive value. \n\nWe know that the larger is at least equal to 9 such that it cannot have negative and positive value for the both numbers. Therefore, the total is less than or equal to (9+9) = 18.\n\nLet the larger be X, and the smaller one be Y.\nThe larger cannot be less than 9, so X > 9\n\nThen:\n\nX  \u2013 Y = 9\n\nX = Y + 9\n\nX > Y, so the two numbers are distinct.\n\nSo the total is less than (26) = 13.\n\nIf the larger is less than 9:\n\nX\u2013Y=\u20139\n\nX =Y + 9\n\nThe two numbers are distinct.

If I think my sibling has a number that ends in 4 and I have a 3 digit number that ends in 345, my guess would be 950. My answer is that I know I am correct if I subtract my number from my sibling's. If it is equal or less, my guess would be correct.\n\n### Response. Guess guess guess guess guess\n\n### Question. If you found that you guessed correctly, your sibling has guessed what your number is and wants you to guess his or hers. He or she wants you to use the clue they gave you as one of the options when guessing. Write your answer to your sibling's question. Ex. If you guessed correctly then your sibling would guess that your number is 650. Then you ask your sibling if he /she knows the number of the digits. If you are correct, write the full number. If you are incorrect, write the clue and what you guessed. \n\n### Response A: Your guess was correct so your sibling guessed 650. If the clue was digits and you guessed 8, you know that your guess was slightly off, but the digits were the right ones. If the clue was a number that ends in four, 650 would be the closest number that ends in four and your guess was not far off.\n\n### If you are incorrect, then you know you are wrong if you add your number to your sibling' s and don't get a number between 600 to 650.

When more and more money is chasing after the same quantity of goods, it drives prices up which causes inflation(Webster's Dictionary). \n\n### Which Of The Choices Provides An Answer That Supports It?\nAnswer B does support and explain the question.

It was 40% chance she will throw 2 heads. What was the probability she threw only 1 head?\n\n### Response\nWe cannot figure out the probability that she threw the 2 heads, since 2 heads means she threw the 3 coins 1 time. Therefore, the probability that she threw only 1 heads is 100%-probability (40% * 3 = 120%), which is 100-120=<<100-106=4%>>4%.\n\n### Input 2\nTwo girls were discussing math problems together. The first girl could get one problem right more than half the time. The second girl could get twice as many problems right as the first girl. The first girl said with 99% certainty that for any combination of their answers one of the girls would be right most of the time. Is this statement true? Explain.\n\n### Response 2\nThe probability of getting one correct is (1/2)^x*x = <<1/2>>\nand the probability of getting two correct is 2*(2/3) which is 2*<<1/3>> which gives me 4*(2/3) = 4(<<2/3>>) which gives me (4*(2/3)) x (2/3) = (4 x 2/3) x (2/3).\n4(2/3) = <<4>>\nSo the probability that one of the girls is right and is >0. \nThe probability that one of the girl is right is equal to 2*0.5 ~ 2/3.\nThe probability that two of the girl is correct is equal to 2*(2/7) ~ 2/7 which is less than half.\nTherefore, the second girl can have twice as many correct as the first girl, and not vice-versa.\n\n### Reasoning\nRationalization: The probability of getting two correct in the second girl is 2*(21/20) which means that 20% of the time the girl will get 2 correct", "answer": "D: were very tired"}

{"text": "### Demostration:\nInput: The car had 8/5 as many seats as truck. The truck has 9 seats. By what number are the seats in the car more than the seats in the truck?\nRationales:: The car has 8/5 =<<8/5=1.6>>1.6 more seats than truck.\n#### 1.6\nAnswer: 1.6\n\nInput: The sum of two 9-digit numbers is 40,272, and the difference of these numbers is 79,423. The greater number is 64 times a greater number. The smaller number is 41 percent of the greater number, and 20 times the smaller number is 15 times the sum. What are the two original 9-digit numbers?\nRationales : Since the greater number is 6 x 41%, we can write as 6 x <<(41/100)>>[41/10 ].\nThus, 6 x 40272 = 241528\nSmaller number is also 41% of the greater number. So,\n40272/41=<<40272/(41)>>[40272//(1//10)]=<<402 72/(41/10)/>= 9953 8/901 > 10000 Hence the smaller number must be less than 10002\nSince, 99538/10 = 9953.8/10 = <<9953. 8/(10/10)>>7441.8/10\nSo, << 99.538/1>>74.42 is less than 10.\nSo, 99 x 41=3979\nSmaller number is 41% of greater number. So greater = 41 x 41 x 3979 = 669939\nSmaller number = 669/41 = 1622/10 = 162.2/10\nSo greater = 6", "answer": "D: feel happy"}

What type of animal did I find at home?\n\n### Response2:\n\nHey, I have a 470 dollar dress that I am wearing now.\n\n### Notes:\n#### Input1: The animal can cost $25, it doesn't specify the type of animal. In the input sentence, \"animal\" can be replaced with a specific animal such as \"elephant, turtle, crocodile, bear, kangaroo and rabbit\". However, we are only suppose to answer what animal family has an average price of $25 on average. (Not species)\n\n#### Input2: We know that the animal was valued at $450. We have to guess at the type of animal that this person probably found. The animal could have been rare and valued, but it wasn't likely considering that it was found. Hence, we probably found something average or common. When we search for \"average cost of an animal\", this sentence is probably talking about monetary cost and not weight/size/color, etc. Since the dressing room is used by people who are going to wear something, this would be the appropriate description of what animal could be worn by the person. However, the person did say that they are going to leave the dressing room soon... meaning that the animal was found a while ago and they probably found it at home before making it to the dressing room.

How many customers are in the service area?\n\n#### 25,090\nAnswer: 25,040\n\n### Question: Is the given answer correct and justified?\n\n#### 1. Correct: The answer needs to be in the context of the problem. The answer should have to do with the 25,050 customers who came to the service area using the restaurant's vehicles. The taxis might have carried a small amount of people to their destinations and therefore, we would not count them among the total number of people that came to the service area.\n\n#### 2. No, since the total number of customers is 18 bus stops * 25,020 people.\n\nThe answer should take each stop into account.

The answer includes the customers who came to a bus stop and ate there, but not to a bus stop that had a restaurant.\n\n#### 4. Incorrect. The service area only includes the 25,500 people in the neighborhood and does not include those who came from other locations using the taxis.\n\nThe context of the question limits the answers to only the 25,200 people who used the buses.\n\n### Questions (Questions 34 - 45)\n\n#### 34.

It could be left on a table, but it's not likely.

For this case, B is also an appropriate answer.\nAs for the rest of the options, I guess D is the best place for leaving a notice that a house occupant would likely see after leaving the house. This is because it isn't going to be left on a table in the main house with people coming and going to it all the time. It's also not going to be left on the front door.

{"text": "The answer is \"table\". First, start the question from a perspective of a student. In my school and classroom, there is a collection of table where the student can put down any books or materials that will be needed in class or the library. Therefore, I would put my dictionaries on the table. Next, for the other choices, I wouldn't put it in my bedroom because it will take too much space. Also, I wouldn't place it in my closet because it would be hard to find. Furthermore, I wouldn't bring it to the library because there are books and many others items that need to be organized. So in the library, they have a special section for dictionaries. Lastly, I wouldn't do it in the study area because I might miss any important items to write down and have space in my desk. In the study area, I would only put my notebook and other things that I need to do the assigned task.\n\n### Output:An example of the correct answer is given.\n\n### Correct Answer: Answer A. If I am the student, the best place for me to put my dictionary is on the table. Table is where I will place anything that involves my use in class like my notebook, assignment, materials and others. So I would place my dictionary on the table. The other choices are not a good choice. For instance, library has a collection of many items and books for the general use.

Choices: 0.6 m3 1.2 m3 1.8 m3 2.4 m3\n\n### Response\n\n36 square metres are needed to fill the pool.\nRationales:(The pool has a perimeter of 14 and an area of 4^2 + x^2 = ((4)^2 + x^2) = 4 x (4 x 4) = 16 + (x^2).\nTherefore, 16 + x^2 = 36, so x = 9 x 9 = 81. So m^3 = (L x W)^2 / 1000 = x x x / 25 = 51 x x x, where 51 is the density of water, x is the depth in m, and the swimming pool has a volume of 4 x 4 x 2 x 2 = 16 x x x x. Thus, the volume is x x x x / 16, which is 81x x x / 13524 = 81x / 100 = 46618 m^3.\n\n### Answer\n\n1 m^3 = 1 cubic metre, or 1000 litres.

How much older is Sarah's 2nd cousin?\n\n### Explanation\nHad Sarah's mom passed on a 6 year old daughter instead of a 6 year old son, Sarah's cousin would be 68 years old, not 70 years old.\n#### 36\nAnswer: C\nThe correct answer is 36 because Sarah's 22 year old nephew must be 22 + 2 times 9 = <<(2+2*9=22)>>22.\nTherefore his age is 11 x 2 = <<11*2=22>>22.\nSince he is 34 years older than Sarah his age must be 34 - 22 = <<(34-22)>>12\n\n### Demostration\n```jsx\nfunction randomNumber(max, min) {\n  const rand = Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min)) + min; //Randomly generates a number between the set min and max\n  return rand;\n}\nrandomNumber(100, 20);\n```\n### Question\nWhat number does a 6 year old know is double a 3 year old's age?\n\n### Solution\nCho", "answer": "E: bus stop"}

The smallest pebble heap has 50 - 2 = <<5-2>>3 pebbles. So 50 - 3 = <<5-3>>2 less than (n) 50 is the smallest heap.\n\nThe biggest heap takes (n) 52 pebbles to add to the smallest heap.

{"text": "Dear Ms. Morgul:Thank you for contacting me. My son, Samir, is often in the process of lying. After hearing the sound of him snickering and getting ridiculous, we tried asking him if he had been lying. In case of a guilty conscience, sometimes it turns out to be the right thing to do. However, I do not think this works for all children.\n\nOne way is to ask questions that require them to keep lying. A person who is lying feels guilty when he is asked questions and answers them honestly, if not, he may be lying. As long as you are not in touch with the person with whom the lie was said, an example here was my uncle who lied to an official, but the official did not believe him.\n\nI find that you can also look for an immediate response or even a response of denial and that will be considered a common sign of lies, but these signs could also be shown by a simple lie or even an innocent answer, so I do not recommend this tactic. It also has to be combined with good common sense and good instinct, I admit that I have a very strong sense of this but for others, it will be very difficult.\n\nThe second thing I found is a lie detector which is used by the CIA, in which there are two fingers that are put together with this one in the middle. If the fingers are clenched and the middle is cold and wet then this person is telling the truth. If it is a heat and a wet, then this person is lying to us. However, this tactic is very risky since it has to be done face to face.\n\nThere are other signs that are often associated with the lie detector, like people who tend to smile a lot, that's because they are anxious not to get caught. There are other signs like nervous gestures, for example, if you touch your ear, when you are talking about it you are lying to this person.\n\nIf you see people trying to speak quickly but not finishing their words, try to stop talking and listen carefully to what you could say, because if they try to talk quickly they are lying.\n\nHowever, many people have learned to hide these signs, like people who have to lie on a daily basis to get what they want to do.\n\n### The answer:\nB\n\n### Input - Question:", "answer": "B: avoid eye contact"}

Every week he buys 25 pencils at the rate of 100 pesos per pencil. He needs 14 new leads for his pencils. How much money will he need to buy the leads if he sells 1500 pencils?\n\n### Rationale:\nEvery week, he sells 100 pcs of pencils, thus in a month, he had sold 400 pcs of which he has spent 25 pesos. That means he has 375 pcs of pencil in stock.\n\nHe needs 14 new lead which is 14/100 and he will get 14 leads at 14X 14 pesos that is 14*14 X 100.\nHis total money spent in a month is\n$400 - 14X 66.7 = $<<400-66.7=340>>340.\n\n### Response\nHe will need to buy 14 leads if he needs to have a total of $340.

{"text": "The correct answer is:\nB\n\n### Explanation:\nAfter taking a run, you can feel some body changes, such as your heart beats quicker, your body sweats, or your muscles become tired. These things can result from sweating, which causes changes in your body weight.\n\n- A: \"Satisfaction\" is when you think what you have done is good enough or better than other things. In this case, it is not the correct one.\n- B: \"Flying\" is when you think you are high or moving quickly in the air. \"Flying\" and \"falling down\" are used when you are climbing mountains, but they do not refer to the feelings about exercise or running.\n- D: \"Falling down\" is not for what you feel after taking a run.\n\n### Input 2:Choices:  A: Satisfaction B: Fitness C: Flexibility D: Strength\n\n### Response\nC\n\n### Rationale:\nFitness, flexibility and strength are all three kinds of body changes or fitness that you can feel after running.\n\n#### Explanation:\n1. \"Satisfaction\" cannot be answered because it talks about thinking what you have done is best. If you feel satisfied, it cannot also be said that you have made new body changes.\n2. \"Fitness\" is when you feel your body is fit for exercise or movement. Running can also improve your fitness levels but it can also produce other body changes such as flexibility and strength.\n \n3. \"Flexibility\" is to be able to do something more easily through practice. After running, you can feel that you are more flexible, which means more flexible muscles.\n4. \"Strength\" is your ability to move or do things by using your muscles. If you strengthen your muscles through sports such as running, you can lift objects heavier and it can also help you become stronger.\n\n### Inference:\nAfter running, you can choose to feel satisfied, fit, flexible, or strong.\n\n### Exercise:\nThe correct answers are satisfaction, flexibility, and strength.\n\nFlexibility changes, and it increases your ability to do movements easily.\n\nStrength, on the other hand, is a state when you have more power", "answer": "A: satisfaction"}

{"text": "E) Anxiety\n\n#### Reasoning: I chose E because, the question asked \"loved by\" and the given options seem more of being associated with, or liked by, and not loved.\n\n### Input : A person was found to be either guilty or innocent. If the person was found guilty, then it would be said that the person got what he deserves or got what he asked for. The person would also not be innocent under those conditions.  If he was found innocent, then he did not get what he deserves. If the person was not innocent, then he would be guilty no matter what the outcome was.\n\n### Reasoning: The person's outcome from the beginning is that he already is not guilty. It would not matter if he was innocent or guilty, he is already not guilty. The last point says, if the person was innocent and not guilty then he would also already not get what he deservers. This can be the answer choice because it seems like it has 0 to do with innocence or guilt, therefore it says nothing about those two.\n\n#### Answer choice E: Innocent got what he did not deserve\n\n### Input:\"How much did Tom owe Dad at the end of the week?\"\n### Reason: \"If Tom had $8.50, he would lose $1.50 and would only have $7 left\".\n### Answer: \"$6.50\"\n\n### Instrucion \"How much did Tom oow Dad at the end oft he week?\"\n### Demonstation:Tom oweesDad $8.50\n### Reason\":If tom had $8.5 he oeo's a $1.5 for tot 8.0$8.5=7.0$7.0.0\n```\n#1) A\n```\n\n### Reasion:\n\n```\n  a. 0.0\n\n\"if Tom lost $1.5 he would have $6.50\" 1.5*0.1633\n```\n\n## If you lose $1, you have $9.90 left.\nWhat you started with is irrelevant since you lost $1.\n\n## If you start with $1, you would have $10.9", "answer": "C: butterflies"}

The question was talking about a person who wants to buy a radio. It was never talking about a whole family deciding to buy a radio, so the answer could not be every. I also eliminated choices A and D because I did not see the words \u201chouse\u201d or \u201ccar.\u201d I could not have eliminated choice E because the question never talked about a bedroom. The words \u201cevery\u201d and \u201cevery\u201d only made sense with the choices of every and house. Choice B made the least amount of sense out of all the choices.\n\n### Answer 1:\nChoice A: station\n\n### Rationale 1:\nChoices A and D are the least likely answers because it was never talking about the house or car. Choice A was also talking about a radio station, not a place to buy a radio. Therefore, the answer was choice E: every. The person does not say they are walking into a store to see if they can buy one. The person says they want to buy a radio, not a television.

{"text": "A, the answer is \"A Air is a renewable resource, and it comes to us directly from the atmosphere, as the oxygen that's breathed out by living people. Air becomes polluted when people in huge numbers breathe it, and it can take years for that pollution to be removed. We'll go into how each of these different options for improving air quality is possible later in this lesson.\n\\\nIn general, the pollution in an area goes down quickly once people stop polluting it. You might also see signs and postings that say things like \"This is a smoke-free zone.\" That often means that you should not smoke tobacco, as well as cigars or hookah. Most of the time, though, this kind of warning means you should not burn anything that can pollute the air. (For more about pollution and smoke, see \"Toxic Pollution.\")\n\\\nIn the US, the Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA and other agencies are working to improve air quality. For example, the EPA mandates that certain things not be emitted, such as chlorofluorocarbons or CFC, some ozone-depleting agents, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). That way, pollution can be prevented before it becomes an issue. Air conditioning, heating, and home-cleaning products could not be made until the EPA had ensured that CFC emissions were to a minimum. You could also call the EPA or contact your state government through something like FindEPAHelp.com.\n\\\nToday, cars, trucks, and other vehicles make most of the harmful air pollutants. You can find more information about vehicle emissions regulations at the EPA's website.  For more information about how to keep air clean, visit the Air Pollution page.\n\n### Output:  A\n\n### Feedback: \nThere are many polluted places on Earth that were once clean but are now quite unhealthy due to air pollution caused by humans. Air pollution happens when small particles or gases like car exhaust are breathed in. When this air goes through a lung, the small particle becomes stuck in a tiny air sac that becomes inflamed. This inflammation damages the air sacs", "answer": "D: train station"}

{"text": "### Rationale:\nAn airplane needs lots of energy to continue flying, so it burns down fuel. The cabin has life-support systems that require lots of energy. C and D have been ruled out because they require less energy to get an aircraft flying. We can rule out C because fuel conservation is not the cabin's purpose. So for fuel conservation, a plane's cabin is used as a crash pad. There are other things in an airplane's cabin, but fuel conservation is one of their purposes. We can rule out B because an airplane cabin is used to slow down the plane, not to help it fly. \n\n### Input 2:Which has more pages: a children's book or a novella? Choices:  Book A: adult book B: a novel C: children's book D: history book E: novel\n\n### Response to Input 2:\n\n### Answer Input 2:\n#### Book B\n\n### Rationales 2:\n\nAn adult book will have more pages than an adult book. The definition of Book B from choice B states that it is more books that are targeted at adults or books with a literary theme. There are two different categories of books that fall under Books B. The novella can fall under the first type because it is a literary-themed book that is targeted at adults. Therefore, Book B has more pages than Book A, which means that the second choice in Book B is the correct.

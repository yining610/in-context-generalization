Cotton does not grow in either North or South Carolina, so he should look for cotton in North Carolina or Georgia.(C)\n\nInput: A man is walking in the woods after work. He is going home, and he knows his wife is waiting for him. He is thinking to himself: \u201cI know it\u2019s a long way home, but I will give Martha one kiss when I come home\u201d. Every time he passes one house, he gives himself another kiss, and for every five houses, he gives his wife one more kiss. But how far does he have to walk until he has given Martha 99 kisses?\nOutput: He can walk 50 blocks and give his wife 99 kisses.\n\nInput: This is a difficult one.\nThe solution to this problem should be fairly straightforward. The number of houses he has so far passed must be equal to the number of \"five-houses-to-one-kiss points\" he has passed. You can solve the equation for that distance, but the answer only gets slightly better with a computer's memory.\n\nYou can only pass between:\n\n0 to 24 houses per point if you pass between 0 to 3 points.\n0 to 6 houses per point if you passed between 3 to 8 points.\nAnd similarly, 0 to 2 houses per point if you have passed 8 to 10 points.\n\nYou can't pass between 10 to 15 points in a single batch, because you would give your wife 9 more kisses than she asked for.\n\nSo I will divide the distances into three parts. For the first part, 0, you have to pass 0 to 50 houses. For the second part, you need to pass 50+ houses, and from that point on, you only pass 2 houses per point, so you can't give your wife any more and she'll be happy.\n\nExample:\n\nIf you need to give your wife 99 kiss, You need to pass 581 to 582 houses(or 580 to 581, or 582 to 583) so you can't pass from 551 to 581 houses, otherwise you won", "answer": "E: medicine cabinet"}

{"text": "When you can't talk to a friend in person, a conversation on the phone is the next best thing. People who have phones usually have a phone plan that offers a set amount of minutes each month for calling. Then they can call as much as they want without paying a long distance or nighttime call fee. Calls to other countries add to the cost. For a low rate, long distance (also called international or intercontinental) calls can be connected using a device called an access code. A person can get an access code from the telephone company and punch buttons on their phones accordingly so that long-distance calls don't cost. Most new phones that let you make calls using a computer are known as Voice over Internet Protocol (Voip) phones. If someone is on a tight budget, he can choose a pay-as-you-go phone, and only pay for the minutes used or the service requested. Cell phones or mobile phones, as they are sometimes called, are the most popular phone type. Mobile phones don't always use a landline. They can call from cell towers located all over the United States and in many other countries such as Australia Japan, and Canada. People who need to call from their homes can get home telephone service, also called a landline. These phones use traditional copper wire called a cable. A wireless home phone is another option, and it uses radio signals that travel through space rather than copper wire. These signals are known as radio waves.

The book, in teaching the basics of linear algebra, had used the following examples, along with appropriate problems to solve: \"The 1,820,153-person city of Los Angeles has one male to every 1.01 woman.\" \"New York's metropolitan area is home to 13.8 million people (9.1 million women and 4.7 million women).\" \"In 1987, 15.1 million women and only 9.7 million men had a college degree.\" This prompted UCLA professor Marilyn A. Michelucci to write in the Chronicle of Higher Education that she was \"stunned - and insulted.\" She complained that the illustrations showed \"an obvious disparity of power\" and \"couched their solutions in gender-biased rhetoric,\" as well as \"treat[ing] women, and often whites, as if they were in some sense inferior to men and other groups.\" The textbook company has promised to amend its future texts, and has given away copies of the current book to UCLA students. Do you think the problem was intentional? Explain your answer.\nOutput: The book is an unquestionable example of a textbook containing bias towards gender. A male to one female is a wrong representation of gender equality. 15.1 out of 13.8 are women who have college degrees which shows the book biased as well. As the book states that the solution to the problem is that there are 4.7 million men who do not have a college degree; implying that they are not as smart or clever as the female college graduates.

{"text": "The correct answer is E. School together. In schools of fish (not all schools, but a few specific types), the fish will sometimes form a line with a dominant fish leading the line.\nThe fish will stay in this formation even when threatened, and do all kinds of crazy maneuvers in groups like swimming on their sides, s-curving, breaking into smaller groups, and much more. The dominant fish is known as the leader, but has no special strength - it simply is the first one in line. The other fish follow the leader and use its movements to navigate and to form an even tighter line.\nThe school has other benefits beyond just following the leader and maintaining line formations. When threatened, schools will form a long line, squeeze together, and swim in patterns meant to confuse/hide/evade threats. Other benefits include the ability to hunt more effectively, as a group, as well as help each other out when a fish gets tired or needs help to avoid a threat.\nMany, but not all, schools of fish look for a single dominant fish, but there are also some species of fish where the fish are grouped into the dominant fish (like a group of dolphins, the leader will take it seriously while others may not bother much). The schools I found were among the most intelligent of fish, and the schools in fact were known to attempt to learn new behaviors - for example, to change colors so as not to make them easy to find by predators or to follow a new leader by swimming sideways. They were extremely intelligent to the point of being a scientific curiosity, in fact. The schools I found out about were the \"super schools\" (the ones with many other schools within it).\nSo the final answer for this is E\n\nInput: It\u2019s Saturday and you want to go out.

If the average speed of you and the driver in front is 80, then you will increase your speed by 3 mph because of this. What is your new average speed?\nOutput: If average speed of you is 80 and car behind is 83 then average speed of you with car behind will be 81. You will then increase your speed to 84, which makes it 82. Final Average Speed = 82\nThis does not work for 1st or 5th scenario.\n\n\nExplanation of 2nd scenario:\n\nYou are driving 80 mph and the driver in front of you is also driving 80 mps, and you're both driving in the same direction. You want to increase your speed by 2 mph, so if you keep driving in the same direction (same speed), you'll go from 80 mph to 82 mph.\n\nExplanations for 3rd scenario:\n\nYou're driving 10 mph behind a stationary car. Now you want to speed up from 5 mph to 8 mph. You can do that just by moving forward at 15 mph.\n\n4th scenario:\nThis scenario requires little bit of algebra.\n\nYou're initially driving at 80 mph.

I struggled when I was at the beginning of learning the language and at some point I did not want to continue. However, after some time I realized that learning is never easy at first, you just have to dedicate yourself in order to learn anything. I was also confused in the beginning because I did not know how to get started with the language and what exercises to do. After reading some articles and searching around, I realized that people say the easiest language to get started with is javascript and I have tried it with this tutorial website I found from the internet: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_intro.asp\nAccording to the article on there, this programming language helps build a webpage and interact with it. The programming language was easy but not challenging for me to learn. The most challenging part of it was when I was solving the exercises, which I think is in my nature, I usually like to go to extreme when trying anything.\nThe exercises I completed were given in the website above and there was a part where I had to solve some easy and challenging exercises. I found that in my opinion that most programming languages were very hard if you did not have any knowledge or experience in it. I decided to take a break and try the exercises again after some time. I was able to solve the difficult part of it and I thought to myself the more I tried, the more I got to solve it. My favorite part of it was the coding of the exercises because it was challenging and it was fun too. There were many exercises to solve but what they do not realize sometimes is that people learn better when they are having fun instead of learning something", "answer": "C: snoring"}

Instruction:Answer the follow multiple choice question:\n## Answer: Choice (A) for the following:\n1. What is the least common multiple of 9, 24, and 36?\n```\nOutput: In this exercise, the question refers to the least common multiple as per the provided information. If we were to multiply 9 and 24 to find their LCM which will be the product will be 272. Then we will use division to get the value of 36 to 272. We will get that the LCM of 272 = 9 \u00d7 24 \u00d7 (36/272). The minimum value for the division 36/274 which will be 2 times 9, 4 times 24 and 3 times 36. So, the LCM in this exercise is 9 \u00d7 272.\n```\n2. If three consecutive integers are all even, then they are all.\n```\nOutput: The 2, 2x, and 2y for a sequence of consecutive even integers where the value is even. So the answer is true.\n```\n3. If x > 5/y and y < -x/5, which of the following expressions will be true?\n```\nOutput:`x > 5/y` means x > 5, so `5/5 < x < 5/` as the value of `x` is not equal to 5. So `y < -x/5` also means `y < -10/5`as the `y` is also less than -10 /5 (the value of x). Then we can say that `y < -1`\nSo, we will be able to write `x < 5` and `y > -1` which means the following expression will be valid\n\n4. If b > 1 and b is divisible by a, then b > a.\n```\nOutput:`b > 1` means b is greater than 1. So b will be greater than any of the even number. If b > 4 for example, then it will not be divisible by any whole value.\n```\n5.", "answer": "B: map"}

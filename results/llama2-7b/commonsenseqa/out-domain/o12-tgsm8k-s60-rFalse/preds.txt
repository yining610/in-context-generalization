Did you mean "question"?<n><n>Comment: Yes. I meant question. Sorry for that.<n><n>Answer: `if __name__ =='main':` isn't how you invoke/execute a program. `sys.executable` will do that. Python is a REPL (read-eval-print-loop) language, so running a program from a file isn't actually the normal usage. In the normal mode, you're usually just reading/writing from the REPL.<n><n>But if what you're doing is a script without interactive prompts, what you want are \strong{input/output functions}, which is a different set of functions and syntax from REPL ones. You do that by calling `IO`, a module, with the file to read from and the list of output functions to run, and the whole thing gets executed. (It runs the functions on the files as they are read.) Here's some example code: (This doesn't do the input right - it can't take input from a running program's terminal on the CPython environment, it's not set up to do

Choices are Examine things, Go somewhere, Knitting book, Read a book, Look at specific program  <n>To come to a conclusion we can use a basic rule to compare each choice which is "We should divide two options and see which comes below".<n><n>So here we have A, B, C, D, E. Here we will start from A to E and if option can be divided or not so we can check whether it came below or in range or not.<n><n>Here we are dividing our 2 options (book, program) by 1 (time)<n>$$(3/1) = 3 \in range$$<n>Since it is in the range it means it is not subtraction.<n><n>Here we can see that it is in the left side.<n><n>So we can see that A is not in scope.<n><n>Here we have to select the option which is lesser than 2, but is not less than 1.<n><n>Here we see that option B is lesser than 0 (less than range) and is lesser than 4 (examine thing(3) > Knitting book (1)  > Go somewhere (2)). So option B is answer. <n>

Jenny's collection is 21 CDs. What is the biggest possible difference?<n>Output: 4<n><n># ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<n># Solutions<n># <n>## Instruction:Answer the question and explain.<n><n>```<n>In 1860, Abraham Lincoln's salary as President of the United States was $25,000 per year. Using this information, write a function for the salary of the U.S. President (in dollars)<n>f(x) = 25,00(1 + 2x)<n>The reason for this function is that $25,012 is roughly the salary of the president every year after 2 increments (in January). This function is accurate if the President's salary is below $25,050. For above that, he gets a $0.50 raise, since the increase is every January when the President delivers the State of the Union address.<n><n>```<n><n>## Instruction: Write a function with 2 arguments such that, for any positive integer n, the 2nth root of 13 lies between the first and the second parameter.<n><n>This is a good problem because the answer is not obvious. You need to dig in to the idea of nth roots. I would write a function<n><n>```<n>f(x, y) = 911^((x-1)/N) < y < 9911^((y+1)/N)<n>This could be refactored to<n>f(x,y) = ((911^((1+x))*(y+1))/100)/((911^((-x))*(1+y))/100)<n>```<n><n>## Fit it!:Write a recursive description of the following function, where x and c are real numbers.<n><n>```<n>fib(x,c

If we take the number, for example 14, all the digits added up to be greater than 9, so we remove the 1 and add up the remaining digits 4. We remove the 1 and keep the 4. What we do once we've done all of these operations, is we take every digit on the right side of the CAR 8. So the eight ones added up to be greater then 9, so we take the 8 and add it together, we have our number of CARS. We can repeat this process over and over until every number is a CARS. How many times would we have to stop, if a number was a CARS?<n>Output: 42<n><n>Input: The sum of all the digits of the largest 5-digit number is 27 less than the sum of the digits of the smallest 4-digit number.

Choices:  A: grocery store B: nightstand C: armpits D: own bathroom E: medicine chest<n>Output:		Choice: C - E is incorrect as the wife has already told that the spouse has looked in the bathroom already. A is definitely wrong too and it's not where he can reach for the armpits. This means that the wife can't afford to buy him deodorant in either case. He could be lying there for all we know. What we do know is that his wife is a saint. B makes total sense only if he had a partner or if one of the two children are sick, which he does not have, not that he'd lie about it. D is the obvious choice and if the lady was at all interested in helping (or rather not humiliating) her husband at all, she'd have offered to help or even asked him where else he'd looked. C is my preferred answer.<n><n>Input: A sales person for the new phone service told a customer in the store that the new service has no contract and will cost the customer double the monthly rate that the current service costs.

It's impossible to lie in such a situation except if you're lying to yourself after the situation. However, I just want to point out that the customer never signed up for service. So how is the company trying to charge him for it? Are they robbing a blind man? It doesn't make sense to me.

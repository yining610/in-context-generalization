In the normal mode, you're usually just reading/writing from the REPL.\n\nBut if what you're doing is a script without interactive prompts, what you want are \\strong{input/output functions}, which is a different set of functions and syntax from REPL ones. You do that by calling `IO`, a module, with the file to read from and the list of output functions to run, and the whole thing gets executed. (It runs the functions on the files as they are read.)

Using this information, write a function for the salary of the U.S. President (in dollars)\nf(x) = 25,00(1 + 2x)\nThe reason for this function is that $25,012 is roughly the salary of the president every year after 2 increments (in January). This function is accurate if the President's salary is below $25,050. For above that, he gets a $0.50 raise, since the increase is every January when the President delivers the State of the Union address.\n\n```\n\n## Instruction: Write a function with 2 arguments such that, for any positive integer n, the 2nth root of 13 lies between the first and the second parameter.\n\nThis is a good problem because the answer is not obvious. You need to dig in to the idea of nth roots. I would write a function\n\n```\nf(x, y) = 911^((x-1)/N) < y < 9911^((y+1)/N)\nThis could be refactored to\nf(x,y) = ((911^((1+x))*(y+1))/100)/((911^((-x))*(1+y))/100)\n```\n\n## Fit it!:Write a recursive description of the following function, where x and c are real numbers.\n\n```\nfib(x,c", "answer": "C: jar"}

If we take the number, for example 14, all the digits added up to be greater than 9, so we remove the 1 and add up the remaining digits 4. We remove the 1 and keep the 4. What we do once we've done all of these operations, is we take every digit on the right side of the CAR 8. So the eight ones added up to be greater then 9, so we take the 8 and add it together, we have our number of CARS. We can repeat this process over and over until every number is a CARS.

But,\nboth answer will be the same so here we need to use sum() or concat()\nto add 2 numbers.\n\nTo add 2 numbers, we must first make sure the result is an integer, so we would first add the 2 numbers\n\nSo we have two ways: using sum() function to make the result integer and using concat() function to make the\nresult integer. I chose concat() function because it does not require parentheses, so we will add the numbers\n\nsum() function needs parenthesis but you can ignore this for now.\n\nLet's see in code\n\n```\n    answer1 = int(str(28) + \"28\")\n    answer2 = str(30) + \"30\"\n    \n    answer3 = sum(answer1, answer2)\n    \n    print(answer3)\n\n```\n\nSo we add 2 numbers now let's look at the second question what this means\nThis", "answer": "D: headache"}

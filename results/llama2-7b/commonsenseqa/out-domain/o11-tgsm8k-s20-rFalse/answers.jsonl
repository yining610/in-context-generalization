{"text": "1. The following are valid options that could apply B, E, A, C, or D, and the choice between them is dependent on the definition of words that would be understood by a person reading the question. A synagogue is a building which hosts Jewish meetings and ceremonies, and a church is a building in which Christians meet for worship services and religious teachings, while a confession is a private meeting in which the sins of one is admitted to a priest.\n\n2. The same choices can apply. A synagogue and church may both be large enough spaces for hosting religious meetings, and a synagogue may be thought of as having its own separate building within a bigger structure, in which case a church may serve as that building. A confession is a statement which admits to sinning, such as one would make to a priest in a confession, and a church is where Christians hold services.\n\n3. The same options apply. A synagog is a building which is associated with a larger space, while a church is a building which is larger. A confession is also associated with a religious meeting, such as a church service.\n\n4. The same choices can also be made. The answer to the question is the office of the school. A place where many people would be sitting is in an office. A synagogue contains a place where people may worship together, such as a church. A church building contains many confessions, as defined by the people who worship there.\n\n5. Synagogues are located in rooms, and churches are also located in rooms which contain atriums which may or may not require entry. There are many types of churches which may have many areas within them, making them large-scale buildings. Churches also have many services or meetings, such as attendee meetings, confession and absolution meetings, and large group services, all of which may have people sitting in chairs and listening to religious speech.\n\n[Link](https://github.com/kate-donnery/Kate-Donnery-Blog/blob/master/Instructions_and_Answers/input.md)", "answer": "C: synagogue"}

{"text": "The correct answer is: A: grill\n\n### Input&Output:The cost of three ounces of gold is more expensive than the cost of two ounces of gold. The cost of one ounce of copper is less expensive than the cost of one ounce  of gold. The cost for a single ounce of gold is three times the cost of a single ounce of copper.  The cost of a single ounces of copper is less than the cost of a half ounce of gold.  The cost for a half ounce of copper has a price equal to the cost of a quarter ounce of gold. How much is (one ounce  of gold?\n\n#### Input\n1/2 ounce Copper = < 1/4 oz Gold\n1/4 oz gold = 3/4 times 1/2 oz Copper\n1/2 oz gold = < 3/4 oz Gold < 1 Oz gold\n\n#### Output\n1 oz gold < 1.5 oz Gold < 2 oz Gold < 3 oz Gold\nCost of oz gold=$12. Cost of oz copper = $3.\n\n#### Example 1\n1/2 ozt GOLD < 0.5 ozt GOLD = 0.333 ozt GOLD\n\nSo $12 < 0.33*$4 = $1.32\n\n#### Example 2\n1/4 ozt GOLD > 0.25 ozt GOLDE = 0.75 ozt GOLDB\nSo $12 > 0.24*$4 = 1.2\n\n#### Example: 1 oz gold = < $1.5 oz gold + 0.25* $4 + 2.82 ozt gold = $5.82\n\nSo $1.32+$5.82+$12 = $20\n\n### Input & Output\nOne hour before the start of class, a student is 1 hour late to school because he is 2 miles from the school.

You conclude that \u201cspelling\u201d fits with the definition; it is, in fact, an interesting word (definition 1), and it is in the right place (it isn\u2019t, in other words, in the wrong place). B: \tIn the second question, you\u2019re asked about an unusual but inappropriate word. The word \u201csacrifice,\u201d in the description, isn\u2019t surprising, because this type of word is unusual. The correct answer is therefore \u201csacrifice.\u201d \u201cExperience,\u201d in the examples, is neither unusual nor inappropriate; it is in fact one of the most common words in the English language.  In other words, you know it\u2019s not unusual or inappropriate because it\u2019s the correct answer.\n\nC: \tIn the third question, inappropriate is the exact reverse of usual. A word is only inappropriate if it isn\u2019t unusual: if it is usual, it\u2019s not inappropriate; only unusual words can be inappropriate. \u201cDirections,\u201d in the example, doesn\u2019t seem to be unusual, so it isn\u2019t inappropriate.\n\n#### Question : Describe a word that is unusual. Choices: A. \tInappropriate B", "answer": "B: basement"}

These will be represented as x+1 for addition, x-8 for subtraction. Write a program to read these directions as a sequence and perform the operations the sequence indicates to return the result. Your program must consist of only ten lines of code, including the name of the program, the title, your name and the semester. Any line containing only a number should not be counted against the ten lines limit, but you are allowed to use additional blank lines to make your code more readable.\n\nExample: Suppose that the sequence of directions for the program were as follows:\n\n4 x -3 5\n\n5 9 -2 8 +6\n\nThe sequence of directions indicates a four-step sequence to be carried out. The first step would be to add 4 and 5, which would give a total of 9. The next step would be to subtract 15 from 15, which would give 0. The next step would then be to add 10 + 7, which would equal 17. The final step would be to subtract this amount from 25, which would give the value of 7. Thus, the result of the program would be 7.\n\nThe sequence in this example is called a series of program orders. It is important for two reasons. First, the only order is followed by the sequence of the numbers and mathematical operators. The only orders that can be performed are those listed (which are \"4\" and its various mathematical operators).

Making more money at work would help someone live off of it better, but getting the raise or promotion to another position wouldn't immediately help with day-to-day expenses.\n\nSaving money is the only thing that directly helps one in all these aspects.", "answer": "B: better job"}

{"text": "In 1950s America, the main options for entertaining one\u2019s guests were a formal, sit-down dinner or a buffet dinner. The rules for either event were the same. But the two styles of dinner parties led to two very different experiences\nThere were two very common styles of dinner parties at the time \u2013 formal, sit down dinner and buffet dinner. But although both were held in the same space, formal sit down dinners were much more common than buffet dinners. The formal dinner had an etiquette of etiquette and a certain protocol that guests were expected to follow. It was most often held in a dining room, with at least two courses, and expected to be eaten rather quickly. The main idea was to be served with everything on the table at the same time. The \u201cwaiter\u201d in each place setting for guests is not just someone who brought the food. They may just be offering the dish. The next course was often being prepared while the guests still sat down. There was no time for leisurely dining, in fact, the host would be furious if it took so long that the guests had to wait to be serviced with the next course.\n\nBuffet on the other hand was more often than not held in a backyard or back verandah or balcony. Since the meal was prepared with large quantities of food buffet-style dinners often included a whole bunch of unlimited side dishes. While the guests wait at a picnic table, they are able to get food as much as they want. In the 1950\u2019s this was actually the most common eating practice because a buffet takes less time to prepare than a dish that is served one bowl at a time.\n\nThings get complicated when it\u2019s the first time you\u2019re ever setting up or decorating for a buffet. The first step is to make sure to have a back-up plan just in case. Things such as having more food than you think will be eaten, are a good idea. Also consider the height of your table(s) as well as the height of the counters you\u2019re using.\n\nThis is an example of decorating a buffet line for a formal, sit-up dinner:\nIf you use real flowers you can create a table runner that will enhance the overall color scheme and can also be reused", "answer": "E: house"}

For example, if a mature tree were to fall, a fire would likely spread across the entire forest floor and burn everything around. That area would no longer grow trees. The forest animals and insects would either starve or perish in the fire. This ecosystem is healthier overall than one without fire.\n\nHowever, forest fires are often caused by accidents, such as a spark from a lighter igniting nearby dead grass. This type of fire often spreads and is not easily controlled. The smoke can cause lung disease and irritate eyes. Firefighters are often called in and risk their lives to fight these blazes. They use special equipment that helps them, but there are still many wildfires each year. A forest fire may burn for days or even a month.\n\nParagraph 2:\nIt is best to be prepared if you think a wildfire might hit your area. If you are a homeowner, gather any important documents (like passports and birth certificates) together and store them somewhere that a fire wouldn't touch.\n\nYou will also want to keep a first aid kit handy just in case, and maybe an emergency preparedness kit.

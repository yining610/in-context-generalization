CAPITALIZATION RULE: When a name is used without further description it is capitalized.\n\nII. WORDS AS WORDS: In the sentence: He did not make the correct choice. \"correct\" is acting as an adverb to modifer the verb \"make.\" In the correct sentence the correct could be replaced with: accurately.\n\nIII.

If 164 students and 2071 adults were from Texas and Kansas, then how many students were from Kansas?\" The answer would be 2336. 164 is the difference between 164 and 207. 164 - 207 = -43. Which is -43 of the 2000. The answer then is 2000 - -43 = 2057. 2336 is the total of the 2071 in Kansas and 273 in Texas. 2071 + 273 = 2344. 2344 - 2000 = 344.", "answer": "A: kitchen"}

The first problem set (Question 1) is in the first line, then the second problem set (Question 2) is  on the second line. You will use the `for` loop in Python. Start with the for loop and make it iterates over every question, in order. Printing is optional, but if you make a mistake, printing or making some sort of error output can really help.\n\nWhenever a question is completed, it should be added to the bottom of the input for the next iteration. The way the problems work is that at the beginning of the program, the user (you in the terminal) is shown the line that contains the problem title and you are prompted to enter an answer for the problem for the next line. Then you continue.\n\nYou will use the `input` function, which will display a prompt, ask for input then display the answer. You then will print the number of questions completed, and if the program exits, the user should be prompted to press enter to quit the program.\n\n### Input Format\n\nThe Python program will be passed a single line containing question titles.", "answer": "E: larger house"}

Next to the main room is a smaller room, which we will assume as a second room. The main room and secondary room are connected with a door that we will assume to have a width of 1 meter. A person can pass through the doorway if there is enough personal space left between her/himself and the doorway. The table in the main room is too wide for the doorway to pass through if it is in place (hypotenuse of hypotenusa, not hypotenuses). The person standing in the main room can make room for the width of the doorway to pass as long as the table is not in place. If the table is in place the person in the main room can open one of the small windows to make room for the width to go through the doorway. There is no point in using the window as it is small as long as there is room to open the doorway to pass. There is two possibilities of having enough room: the table can be moved to the smaller room or it can be tiled up on two of it\u2019s four side to make the width of the table thinner to make it fit into the doorway of the main room.

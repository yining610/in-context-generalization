Choices:  A: auditorium B: office C: synagogue D: confession E: church<n><n>### Response:		<n>1. The following are valid options that could apply B, E, A, C, or D, and the choice between them is dependent on the definition of words that would be understood by a person reading the question. A synagogue is a building which hosts Jewish meetings and ceremonies, and a church is a building in which Christians meet for worship services and religious teachings, while a confession is a private meeting in which the sins of one is admitted to a priest.<n><n>2. The same choices can apply. A synagogue and church may both be large enough spaces for hosting religious meetings, and a synagogue may be thought of as having its own separate building within a bigger structure, in which case a church may serve as that building. A confession is a statement which admits to sinning, such as one would make to a priest in a confession, and a church is where Christians hold services.<n><n>3. The same options apply. A synagog is a building which is associated with a larger space, while a church is a building which is larger. A confession is also associated with a religious meeting, such as a church service.<n><n>4. The same choices can also be made. The answer to the question is the office of the school. A place where many people would be sitting is in an office. A synagogue contains a place where people may worship together, such as a church. A church building contains many confessions, as defined by the people who worship there.<n><n>5. Synagogues are located in rooms, and churches are also located in rooms which contain atriums which may or may not require entry. There are many types of churches which may have many areas within them, making them large-scale buildings. Churches also have many services or meetings, such as attendee meetings, confession and absolution meetings, and large group services, all of which may have people sitting in chairs and listening to religious speech.<n><n>[Link](https://github.com/kate-donnery/Kate-Donnery-Blog/blob/master/Instructions_and_Answers/input.md)

Choices:  A: see work B: shocked C: humor D: startled E: funny<n><n>### Response:		Answer: D<n><n>When he touched the exposed (electric) wire he shouldn't be finding it strange that he got what?<n><n>Answer: funny<n><n>#### Explanation:<n>The text says, "He shouldn't have found what?" which can be replaced by what he shouldn't have. This will give us to choose only one option. "He shouldn't find the unexpected electricity" or "He shouldn't be finding" will match the sentence. Since the question mentions "humor" we can discard the other choices. Thus, we are down to three options. We can also discard option D and rule out option C as we know that he didn't find electricity in a funny way. That leaves only two choices. We decide that he shouldn't be (find) the unexpected electricity.

Write a response that describes the requested type of word.<n><n>#### Demonstration: A: 	In the example, you want to know if “spelling” fits the description. “Stars,” the description says, are “very interesting, but in the wrong place.” “Spelling,” being words, is clearly not in the wrong place: it’s in alphabetical order according to definition 1 in Webster’s second definition on the first page of its second edition: “That which is spelled.”  In other words, “spelling” is in the right place; it’s not in the wrong place. You conclude that “spelling” fits with the definition; it is, in fact, an interesting word (definition 1), and it is in the right place (it isn’t, in other words, in the wrong place). B: 	In the second question, you’re asked about an unusual but inappropriate word. The word “sacrifice,” in the description, isn’t surprising, because this type of word is unusual. The correct answer is therefore “sacrifice.” “Experience,” in the examples, is neither unusual nor inappropriate; it is in fact one of the most common words in the English language.  In other words, you know it’s not unusual or inappropriate because it’s the correct answer.<n><n>C: 	In the third question, inappropriate is the exact reverse of usual. A word is only inappropriate if it isn’t unusual: if it is usual, it’s not inappropriate; only unusual words can be inappropriate. “Directions,” in the example, doesn’t seem to be unusual, so it isn’t inappropriate.<n><n>#### Question : Describe a word that is unusual. Choices: A. 	Inappropriate B

The age method should return the number of years the dog has lived so far. The age should be returned to the calling method after computing the difference between the dog's age at the start of the program and the ending age value.<n>### Let's look at our first example to see this in action.<n>Input: Your Dog, which is named Fido, is 5 years old.<n>Answer: 64<n><n>Input: Your Dog is 20 years old.<n>Answer 200<n><n>### The key pieces of information are the number of years the pet has lived and the current age of the pet. From that information, we subtract the current age from the beginning age to find the number of years since that age.<n><n>### Here's one more exercise that we can use to see these pieces in action.<n>Input 1: The current age of your dog is 3.

If the meal is supermarket food, we can also add a flavoring agent like salt, so it would need to have either pepper or salt. If the meal in doubt is grocery store food, it could be bland due to lack of additives. As such, either salt or pepper could be used to improve its taste. If we are questioning the cellar where we get our meals, we can add salt and pepper as it is possible that the food may be bland because of the place where it is kept, as different places can bring different flavors and tastes to food.<n><n>### Input:"Taking 2000 and adding 6 to it results in what remains?"<n><n>### Response:"6000"<n><n>### Input "Taking 843256 and adding 64 to it results in what is left?"<n><n>### Respons"e: 769770"<n>

In a multiple choice test you would just identify what the wrong answer is, then if there was a note at the bottom it could even be the correct answer.<n><n>### Acknowledgements: To:Jennifer<n><n>### Note:<n>* The main thing that you have to think about is which choice is something that you would or would not normally do that way.<n><n>That way if you choose it, you are not going to get something wrong, because it would not be incorrect. This could also help with making sure you are not choosing something that no one would do.<n>

These will be represented as x+1 for addition, x-8 for subtraction. Write a program to read these directions as a sequence and perform the operations the sequence indicates to return the result. Your program must consist of only ten lines of code, including the name of the program, the title, your name and the semester. Any line containing only a number should not be counted against the ten lines limit, but you are allowed to use additional blank lines to make your code more readable.<n><n>Example: Suppose that the sequence of directions for the program were as follows:<n><n>4 x -3 5<n><n>5 9 -2 8 +6<n><n>The sequence of directions indicates a four-step sequence to be carried out. The first step would be to add 4 and 5, which would give a total of 9. The next step would be to subtract 15 from 15, which would give 0. The next step would then be to add 10 + 7, which would equal 17. The final step would be to subtract this amount from 25, which would give the value of 7. Thus, the result of the program would be 7.<n><n>The sequence in this example is called a series of program orders. It is important for two reasons. First, the only order is followed by the sequence of the numbers and mathematical operators. The only orders that can be performed are those listed (which are "4" and its various mathematical operators). Addition is performed before subtraction when the only orders are to be performed before adding numbers or subst

Choices:  A: cafeteria B: arranging papers C: in the park D: formal dining room E: house<n><n>### Response:		<n>In 1950s America, the main options for entertaining one’s guests were a formal, sit-down dinner or a buffet dinner. The rules for either event were the same. But the two styles of dinner parties led to two very different experiences<n>There were two very common styles of dinner parties at the time – formal, sit down dinner and buffet dinner. But although both were held in the same space, formal sit down dinners were much more common than buffet dinners. The formal dinner had an etiquette of etiquette and a certain protocol that guests were expected to follow. It was most often held in a dining room, with at least two courses, and expected to be eaten rather quickly. The main idea was to be served with everything on the table at the same time. The “waiter” in each place setting for guests is not just someone who brought the food. They may just be offering the dish. The next course was often being prepared while the guests still sat down. There was no time for leisurely dining, in fact, the host would be furious if it took so long that the guests had to wait to be serviced with the next course.<n><n>Buffet on the other hand was more often than not held in a backyard or back verandah or balcony. Since the meal was prepared with large quantities of food buffet-style dinners often included a whole bunch of unlimited side dishes. While the guests wait at a picnic table, they are able to get food as much as they want. In the 1950’s this was actually the most common eating practice because a buffet takes less time to prepare than a dish that is served one bowl at a time.<n><n>Things get complicated when it’s the first time you’re ever setting up or decorating for a buffet. The first step is to make sure to have a back-up plan just in case. Things such as having more food than you think will be eaten, are a good idea. Also consider the height of your table(s) as well as the height of the counters you’re using.<n><n>This is an example of decorating a buffet line for a formal, sit-up dinner:<n>If you use real flowers you can create a table runner that will enhance the overall color scheme and can also be reused

The answer may be the number of other animals left.<n><n>### Answer:<n>--- <n>Blood isn' t usually spilled during soccer games. Each animal counts more than each person in this question. That's because each of a player's teammates counts more than their opponents. If they don't fight to get the ball, then no one will do a lot of harm to other animals. It might also mean that players protect them selves when the ball doesn't go where they expected. By doing that, soccer players are also protecting their animals.

For example, if a mature tree were to fall, a fire would likely spread across the entire forest floor and burn everything around. That area would no longer grow trees. The forest animals and insects would either starve or perish in the fire. This ecosystem is healthier overall than one without fire.<n><n>However, forest fires are often caused by accidents, such as a spark from a lighter igniting nearby dead grass. This type of fire often spreads and is not easily controlled. The smoke can cause lung disease and irritate eyes. Firefighters are often called in and risk their lives to fight these blazes. They use special equipment that helps them, but there are still many wildfires each year. A forest fire may burn for days or even a month.<n><n>Paragraph 2:<n>It is best to be prepared if you think a wildfire might hit your area. If you are a homeowner, gather any important documents (like passports and birth certificates) together and store them somewhere that a fire wouldn't touch.<n><n>You will also want to keep a first aid kit handy just in case, and maybe an emergency preparedness kit. For more information, search online or in your local library for disaster preparedness kit checklists.<n><n>### Author name, school name and class date are all below

Choices:  A: nebraska B: new york C: mexico D: home E: utah<n><n>### Response:		C<n><n>### Rationale:<n>Answer choice D indicates a place in the United States. Nebraska is not where you can find a steakhouse. New York would indicate a steakhouse in a large city, but corn farms are found on the East Coast. Mexico has corn, but it’s not a place to eat steak. Option E indicates Utah, which is not a steakhouse but a steak.<n><n>### Input<n><n>A: Is Mexico City dangerous, or at least not safe to roam alone? B: No, people are friendly and the police are good. C: Yes, I got kidnapped and then the police let me go. D: I don't know, but at least there are cheap restaurants. E: Yes, you should stay away.<n><n>### Response<n><n>D<n><n>### Rationalization:<n>Choices A and E are both good answers to this question. Mexico City and the police are discussed in B. The cheap restaurants are brought up in C, and D is what you would know the most about. The best choice to pick would be either A or E.<n><n>### Task:Answer the following multiple-choice question with "Yes" or "No".<n><n>### Inputs:<n>No, I was born in Hawaii. Yes, I was born on Maui. No, I have lived with my grandmother since I was born.<n><n>### Output:<n>Maui<n><n>### Reason:<n>The choices all have to be true to equal "Yes" to this question. Even if the first two choice were "Yes" the third question would still be "No", because only by living with your grandmother would you know where you were born, so the third question is irrelevant if the previous questions are each true.<n><n>### Answer<n><n>Maui<n>

Then I would use the inverse operation and simplify the whole problem down as much as possible until there was no possible way that it could be simplified.  The number one way would be to divide these fractions into equal fractions.  For example, dividing 8x + 7 x 42 by 20x + 32 gives the result of 40.  It would be 40x + 30 which is the same thing divided by itself and it would only have 2 of the 4 10s which would be a perfect square.<n><n>

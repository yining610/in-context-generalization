CAPITALIZATION RULE: When a name is used without further description it is capitalized.<n><n>II. WORDS AS WORDS: In the sentence: He did not make the correct choice. "correct" is acting as an adverb to modifer the verb "make." In the correct sentence the correct could be replaced with: accurately.<n><n>III. WORDS AS NUMBERS: Every dollar is a number. If it becomes a "numeral" it goes in quotes.<n><n>IV. NUMERICAL VALUES OF WORDS: "82" is 82 in all caps. The numbers "2" and "5" are not written in numerical fashion (822 or 825). "3-14' is not written in a numerical fashion. <n><n>### Hint: In questions where the answer is either TRUE or FALSE.<n><n>The "T" answer is always True.<n><n>### HINT: When solving word problems it helps to simplify and reduce your answer to a single word. You then can convert your single word answer into the appropriate unit of measure and answer the question. (Ex: If you had a problem "There were 2000 students and 4375 adults at the school. If 164 students and 2071 adults were from Texas and Kansas, then how many students were from Kansas?" The answer would be 2336. 164 is the difference between 164 and 207. 164 - 207 = -43. Which is -43 of the 2000. The answer then is 2000 - -43 = 2057. 2336 is the total of the 2071 in Kansas and 273 in Texas. 2071 + 273 = 2344. 2344 - 2000 = 344.

So the first year it generates 2 billion, the second year it generates 1.8 billion, and every year after that it generates 2 billion less. Therefore the 1 cent tax increase will no longer add as much income to the government as time goes on. Therefore the amount generated will decrease as time goes on, so the answer is none of the above.<n><n>Input:Here is the link to the problem if you want to look at it and think about it.<n>Output:  http://blog.practicect.com/maths-questions-with-answers-3/<n><n>Input:I will try to explain why the question was hard, and why I have problems with these questions.<n>Output:  This type of question is the hardest, because it asks you a question about some sort of pattern, and no answer you come up with would actually be the answer based on what the question asks. For example, I could've come up with anything for the last question, because if my choice were true they would've already taken that option away from the list. Every option must be logical based on the question asked, but no other question is asking you about logic/patterns.<n><n>Input:Okay here's another one I got stuck on.<n>Output:  Every time one of the answers is always wrong, you will also come up with something always wrong too. So you have to come up with something that's not always wrong.<n><n>Input:I did this problem for the last question.

The first problem set (Question 1) is in the first line, then the second problem set (Question 2) is  on the second line. You will use the `for` loop in Python. Start with the for loop and make it iterates over every question, in order. Printing is optional, but if you make a mistake, printing or making some sort of error output can really help.<n><n>Whenever a question is completed, it should be added to the bottom of the input for the next iteration. The way the problems work is that at the beginning of the program, the user (you in the terminal) is shown the line that contains the problem title and you are prompted to enter an answer for the problem for the next line. Then you continue.<n><n>You will use the `input` function, which will display a prompt, ask for input then display the answer. You then will print the number of questions completed, and if the program exits, the user should be prompted to press enter to quit the program.<n><n>### Input Format<n><n>The Python program will be passed a single line containing question titles.

The best way is not necessarily the fastest way and will depend on the information provided and the tools at your disposal. For example, for a question where you need to calculate the square root of 309, you will have to convert that to a fraction, which is pretty easy, and then you can just use a calculator to calculate the square root. For a question where you need the 4th term of a geometric progression series, you would use your calculator to solve it. For this specific question, I would recommend using a spreadsheet to help out. <n>

Next to the main room is a smaller room, which we will assume as a second room. The main room and secondary room are connected with a door that we will assume to have a width of 1 meter. A person can pass through the doorway if there is enough personal space left between her/himself and the doorway. The table in the main room is too wide for the doorway to pass through if it is in place (hypotenuse of hypotenusa, not hypotenuses). The person standing in the main room can make room for the width of the doorway to pass as long as the table is not in place. If the table is in place the person in the main room can open one of the small windows to make room for the width to go through the doorway. There is no point in using the window as it is small as long as there is room to open the doorway to pass. There is two possibilities of having enough room: the table can be moved to the smaller room or it can be tiled up on two of it’s four side to make the width of the table thinner to make it fit into the doorway of the main room. The table can only be tiled on two sides. Is this possible?<n>Output: B<n><n>Input: There was a magic mushroom competition in the country where they grow magic mushrooms.

The next Monday morning you return the book to them but you find that you lost it while washing your hands at the gym. The book was so interesting that you couldn't just let it go; instead you go looking for a better copy online! You can decide to go to either a library or to a bookstore. If you go to a library, you find that they don't have the book but they have an identical copy. You can either keep the free book or return it to the library and receive a refund for the money you paid when you bought it online. Instead of going to a library, you decide it would be better to go to a bookstore which doesn't have the book. You decide to buy the same book, and in the end you find out that you don't have enough money to pay for the book! Instead of just giving up, you run a marathon in a few days so that you can have enough money to buy the book. After 36 hours of rest, you run the marathon! The marathon takes 6 hours to finish, after which you have only just enough money to buy a new book and receive your previous book in good condition too. After everything, you spend the book in the library, because it was cheaper.  Now you want to know why you made all those decisions and if you were rational. What is the biggest factor in your decisions? Choices: 1. the desire for a new copy of a book.  2. the cost of the book in a bookstore after running a marathon.  3. the cost of the replacement after running a marathon for 6 hours after being at the gym for 36 hours. 4. the desire to be cheaper by using the library rather than the bookstore. 5. the time you spent running a marathon. 6. the time wasted at the gym<n>Output: 4<n>```<n><n>Input: Input the number 9.

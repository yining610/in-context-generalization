{"text": "Since these have different levels or difficulty I will use different levels of difficulty for the questions. I will use the fruit market and the grapes in this one. \nThe grocery cart is a metaphor for the mouth, so it is logical to assume that grapes will go into the mouth. \nHowever they are being checked out, which is when they leave the grocery cart. So they are leaving the mouth, and going into the fruit market. \nThe supermarket is where you buy your fruits, you usually don't see the fruit market anymore. Fruit market is a term I made up for my own personal reference for places where fruit is usually sold, it does not necessarily translate to other languages. \nThe fruit at market is a supermarket, a term I made up personally, which is where you get your fruits from. \nFruit basket is a term used to describe the fruit, so they go in it. I don't know if they are checked out from or in the fruit basket, however. (I think the fruit are already checked out from the fruit market and are in the fruit basket by the time the grapes are checked out of the mouth though...) \nThe check out is where you pay the fruit market, which is where you pay for your fruits. \n\nSo the correct answer for where to put grapes just before you check out is the fruit basket. \n\n Input: Where do you put your groceries if you were to buy 1 apple, 2 oranges, and 3 bananas? Choices: A: basket B: box C: fruit market D: fruit stand E: fruit shopping \nOutput: The bananas 1/4/6 and oranges 2: will fit on top of each other, bananas are bigger than oranges. \nThe apple and banana are both long so they will fit in the box. \nThere is a fruit stand in every fruit market, so the fruit stand is in the fruit market. Therefore bananas are checked out at the fruit market, or fruit stand with the apple and bananas. Then the box is checked out of the fruit market with the apples and bananas. Then there are two fruits. \nThis question is based on the assumption that fruit is already checked-out of the fruit market in the fruit stand.

{"text": "The rock needs to get from the point of origin at the surface of the earth through the water. The only paths available are: along the ground and through the river.\nThe most efficient way to travel from the surface of the earth to the ground is to jump (assumed gravitational force constant). There are (ground height / jump height) = <<7/2=3>>3 different ways to do that.\nThe ground surface can be covered in 1 second. Average speed of water in the river is 6 km/s. The rock will hit the water from a point approximately 30.9 m above the surface of the water.\nSince the rock falls to the bottom at a certain speed, the rock will hit the water in 1.41 seconds.\nThe distance the rock travels up the river is 30.9 meters downriver from the surface of the water where it first hits. The time it takes it to go back up = 1.41 sec / 15 m/sec = 9.19 sec. If a river is 700 meters long, the return journey will only travel 690 - 310.9 m = 379 m. That's 379 / 9.19 = <<378+99>16>>16 meters of distance per 1.41 second.\nThe path is covered by the river at 30.9 * (15/6) = <<30.9*(15/6)=5.14>>5.14 meters per second.\nThe average speed of a rock on the river is 5.14 / 1.41 = <<5.14/1.41=3.59>>3.59 meters per sec.\nTherefore, the rock goes a total of (379 + 379) * 3.59 = <<379+379*3.59=1363>>1363 meters up and down the river.\nSo the final question is 1,363\n\nInput:A train traveling at 73 kph passes through a signal that warns the driver to slow down.

They can be found in 1 of 4 places. Where is Alice most likely to find her keys? Choices: Left pocket Right pocket Bedroom Bathroom Kitchen\nOutput: If Alice leaves her house keys in the same place every time, her keys would be most likely found in the same place every night.\nOption A, Bedroom \u2013 Bedrooms are usually quiet and relaxing, which is where most people rest. So, if Alice always leaves her house keys in her bedroom, this would be her likeliest place to find it.\nOption B, Bathroom \u2013 Bathrooms are also usually quiet and relaxing to many people but if her house is like a friend of mine, then her bathroom is the place she usually gets phone calls.\nOption C, Kitchen \u2013 Kitchens are usually the busiest rooms of our houses, aside from the bathroom. If Alice uses her kitchen as a catch-all, then this would be her most likely place to find it. It\u2019s always better to know where you\u2019re most likely to find things before they go missing because it might prevent something bigger from happening.\nOption D, Right Pocket \u2013 We all have our favorite right places. It\u2019s probably the last place Alice looks for her keys\nOption E, Left Pocket \u2013 I don\u2019t have a left pocket because I\u2019m lefty. For the right pocket though we all have our favorite place inside because it\u2019s where we usually leave our keys to keep them safe and prevent them from getting lost.\nSince I put my house keys in my left front pocket, I think they would be most likely found there.\nSo the final question to answer is Option E: Left Pocket\n\nInput: The following data shows how many students were at various schools on Tuesday. 0 students 3 students 4 students 2 students 1 student 1 student 4 students Which school has the largest number of students?\nOutput: The answers are in two sets:", "answer": "E: elevator"}

Thus, the equation becomes xy + 1, or 6 + 1 =5.\nSo x^2 +y = 2 means that (x+y)^2 = 1+1+2+2 = 6. Since x and y are both 2, we get y^2 = 2^2 = 4. since y does not have to be a natural number, y in our problem is 2 + 2 = 4 and if we subtract 1 from it, x^2 +y will become 2^2-1. Finally, 2^2 - 1 = x^2 + y ( x^2 + y-1 ) and 2^2 -1 can be simplified to x^2 + 1.\nSo 6 = (x^2 + y)^2 + 1.\nSo the final answe is E\n\ninput:In this math question", "answer": "B: basement"}

If she made $11 more after she bought the additional tickets, how much did she make selling the tickets she originally had?\nOutput: It is possible to calculate the answer without the use of formulas.\nSuppose she sold tickets for $1. If she bought tickets for $1 * 1.5 = <<1*1.5=1.5>>1.5, she sold $1.5, made $$.11 profit, and her total revenue is $1.1. Thus her original price for tickets was $1.1.*\nThe girl sold three quarters of the tickets she had, for a total of 3 * 3/4 = <<3*3/4=3>>3 tickets.\nThe girl now has $1.5 + $3 + $$1.1 = <<1.5+3+1.1=6>>6 tickets.\nThe total is 3/4ths of $6 = <<3/4*{6}=$$1.5>>1\nTherefore, her original revenue is $1*3/4 = <<1*3/4=$.75>>$.75.\nSo the final result is $$.75\n\nInput: Why don\u2019t elephants go to the hospital?

However, color TV was not widely available until the 1960s. For example, you might not know that in the 1890s people enjoyed going to Nickelodeons and Penny Arcades where there were often movies. Many of the movies at these places were very short but some lasted up to 20 minutes. In 1947, color movies came into wide use and now the movies that are shown today last an average of 2 hours. How long were the early movies at the Nickelodeons and in Penny Arcades?  \n\nOutput: Longer movies started coming out about 1932 since that was when the first color television was introduced. These movies last 2 hours. Before that, the movies lasted from 1~20 minutes in the beginning years. From 20~1950s, the movies last from 21~60 minutes. So, movies before 2020 are longer, while movies after 1950s are shorter.

What day will the festival end in a week if it doesn't rain on Saturday or Sunday?\nOutput: The festival starts on Monday and ends on Sunday, but it doesn't rain. So if the festival continues then Saturday and Sunday are the 6th and 7th day of the festival. If we say Tuesday is day 1, then we have these days between: day 1 to day 6, day 3 to day 5, day 2 to day 4, day 6 to day 6, and day 5 to day 7 of the festival. So if Saturday or Sunday will not rain, they will be day 6 or day 7 of the 8 day festival.\n\nSo the following 3 days will be rain-free days: Sat|sun|Sun so that means the day before the rain, which is Wednesday will be a rain day.\n\nSo the total number minus 7 is 1 day before Wednesday is Tuesday, so Wednesday to the following Tuesday is the festival.\n\nSo we will have 6 days of rain on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and 2 days of rain free (sat|sun|Sun) will be on Saturday, and Sunday so the day before of rain free days would end on Friday, and the next day is Monday. So the day of the festival end was on Monday.\n\nAnd since the last day of festival is on Monday, but doesn't say that the rains on Monday, so the last day of festival wouldn't necessarily be on Monday.\n\nSo day 1 to day of festival end is Monday to Sunday so Monday to Sunday.\n\nSo the last day of festival would be on Sunday, because it doesn", "answer": "A: hair salon"}

{"text": "A\nC\nAnswer: There is a very obvious right way to answer this question. It's best that the students figure out the answer themselves.\n\n### Instruction:Answer multiple choice questions.\n\nInput: The 40 students who use a computer room had a total of 122 users. Since, they all use 16-gigabyte flash drives, and they all use these flash drives every day and re-download games, they have a total of 154 flash drives.\nSo the question is, what else can these 40 students use their flash drives for besides downloading the games? The answer is to have extra space for the photos they take. There are 40 students who don't use their flash drives, and then for each day those students used the 4 gigabyte computers in the computer room, they take one thousand pictures each. This means that even if a student doesn\u2019t use them every day, it's still 40 students total who have a computer room and they take 1000 pictures a day.

We need to account for that. So\n(7 + 2) / 7 = (7 + 2) - (7+1) = <<7+2-7-1>>(1) slice more than usual\n(8 + 2) /  8 = (8 + 2) -  (7+1)  = <<(8+2)-(7+1)>>(1) slice\nand so on\n(13 + 2) / (13+1) = (13 + 2)-(13+1)  =    <<(13+2)-(13-1)>> 2 slices more.\n(14 + 2) /14 = (14 +2) - (13+1)=     <<(15+2)-(14+1)>> 2 more\n(14 +3) / (14+1) = (37+3) - (14+1)=  <<(37+3)-(15-1)>> 3 more\nSo the answer is 8\n\nInput: A pack of cookies has 30 cookies.

The value of the first letter is now 1 character and the value of the fourth letter is now 4 characters.\nE is the last letter of the existing words, so the letter value must be 0 chars. For question A, since the sum of length is greater than 5, the letter value must be either 3 chars or 4 chars or more.

Thus, the letter value is 1, 4, 3, 3 for the letter A, E, C, D, respectively.\nFor question E, the sum of length is zero, so the letter value can only be one letter or less.

{"text": "Fire - When the Romans first built their own houses around 500 CE, they heated their houses using a method called hypocaust: a system of flues under the floors that would channel the heat of a fire in an external oven. As more and more Romans moved to the cities, the need for hypocaust heating grew. Hypocaust was also common in most civilizations on the Eastern Mediterranean, as well as China during the Han-dynasty. Nowadays, we rely more on electrical heating methods\nSolar energy - A great deal of the heat that enters the earth's atmosphere comes from the sun. This is not the only source of heat on earth and it is not constant over time.\nSun - The sun is a massive star-like object found in the center of the solar system. It provides energy to the Earth in the form of electromagnetic radiation, specifically visible light and heat. Because of the sun, life on earth is possible. Sunlight is not always present, but when it is, the sun is at least partially visible in the sky and the weather is fair.\nCoal or wood - Coal and wood are the oldest types of fuels that humans have used to generate energy. Fossil fuels were formed millions of years in the past from decaying plant and animal material, and coal is the most recent of the two fuels, formed after dinosaurs. Coal is used mainly today as an electrical energy source.\nHouse - Solar heat is a form of alternative energy or \"green\" energy harnessed by converting that energy from the sun into usable power for heat, water heating and electric appliances.\nSo the final answers are A, S, sun, and house\n\nInput: There were 10 girls competing to be the first one to solve a math problem.

How might you tell a machine that when calculating a sum, it should add the terms without counting the ways they differ and thus come up with the incorrect sum?\nOutput: For our examples the first thing we need to tell the computer is that the different pairs it considers are going to be 1, e.g. a pair of 5 and 10. To do this we need to make an expression of 1 as 10 - 9. So our first piece of information should be 1 - 10 - 10 because we want to tell the computer the following pieces. Our first expression should be 1 - e, where e = 10 - 4. So our expression should also be 1 - e = 5.\nIn terms of the second pair of numbers, 4 and 7, we know that our difference is going to be 3 so our expression should look like: 1 - e + 3.\nAfter making our first two expressions we have: 1 - e - e + 3 = 5+3 = 8.\nTo make the third expression of 50 and 5, we need to use our difference that is 5, in which case we get: 1 - e =, 50+50 - e + 5 = 51 + 5 = 4 + e.\nTo make our fourth expression of 7 and 11, we need to use -3 as the difference. In this case we get: 7 - e - 3 = 7 - 3 = 4\nThe fifth expression is 7 and 10 where the difference is going to be -3. 7 - 10 -e - 3 = 14.\nOur final piece of information is going to be: 1 -e (since our final two expressions are already done). 1 -e = 0.\nTherefore, 1 -e + 3 = 7\nOur complete expression is therefore 1", "answer": "E: air out"}

A square could be a rectangle, a rectangle could be a triangle, and so on so on. Many of the shapes that are combined together to create one shape can go on so on.\nB : A Triangle is a three dimensional shape that is made up out of all shapes that exist. The only 3 shapes that exist are; square, rectangle, and circle. Thus, triangles are made up out of any of these shapes. Therefore, all triangles are made up of many shapes.\nC : The most common shape used in windows in most buildings is the square. This is because the square has many sides and the corners can also be very pointy so that it is the most convenient to cut that shape out and form it into. The rectangle is commonly used in the windows because they are two dimensional shapes and they allow light to enter better than the other shapes.\nD : 2 squares fit together to form a rectangle. 4 rectangles fit together too make a square. 8 rectangles make a cube. 36 rectangles make a pyramid. 120 rectangles make a cuboctahedron.\nE : A pentagon is most common but it is not the only way to make a window so it isn't the most common. The rectangle is the most common because it is the shape with the most sides and there are a lot of buildings that use them.\nF : A cube is made from rectangles.\nSo the final answers is D\n\nInput:The number one soccer player needs to buy 3 bags of crisps.

So how many jellyfish will be there in the pool?\nOutput: First, there are sharks + piranhas + jellyfish = 4.\nWe know that jellyfish is surrounded by piranhas, so jellyfish is not surrounded by sharks.\nThis means that there is 1 less shark in the pool, which turns the equation to: sharks + piranhs + 1 jellyfish = 3.\nThere are two possibilities: sharks + piranha + jellyfish is smaller than 3, or sharks + piranha > 3.\nIf sharks + piranha is less than 3, there will only be 2 jellyfish in the pool.\nIf sharks and piranha are greater than 3, we will need 5 jellyfish.\nSo sharks + piranha = 3 and therefore there will not be any jellyfish in the sea.\nThe answer is \"none\".\n\nInput: A certain group at school were trying to decide which color is the easiest to work with.

The one minute fast clock is one minute ahead of schedule.\nWe start the fast clock one minute fast. When the fast clock reads 1, we turn it to 0. So it is still one minute ahead of schedule, but now the fast clock reads 0.\nWe turn the fast clock around and turn it to 1. When 1 minutes have passed, it reads 2. We turn it into 0. It is now four minutes behind schedule. When it reads 4, we turn it back to 1.\nFrom this point, we subtract the number of minutes from 1. When the clock is zero minutes behind schedule, it is 1 minute fast. When the clock is 2 hours behind schedule, we subtract 2 hours from 360 and get zero.\nSo the final minimum is 2\n\nInput:The water in the fountain is leaking.

{"text": "Answer: B. The word resentment has two meanings: (1) feeling annoyed or disappointed that someone has something good, and (2) feeling hurt because someone does not treat us as well as they should.\n\nThe sentence means both players lose to the other if they are matched evenly against each other.\nFans don't want to see them lose. Instead, the fans want to see the players perform at the highest level--and thus prefer a one-winner instead of two: resentment means that the spectators want one winner and not two.\n\nInput: If a player's point average decreases with each play, then we can say that the player got worse as the game went on.\nOutput: The word as has more than one meaning in this sentence. This sentence is talking about the player's performance getting worse--as is used in the phrase: get worse.\nThe second meaning of as is that the player had lost a point on each play.\nSo the sentence is saying that as the player gets better, the player gets worse, which means that he got better at getting worse!\nThe player did, in fact, get worse as his game went on.\n\nInput: When they were at school, Tom was a quiet boy who didn't give a lot of trouble.\nOutput: Answer: Choice A\nThe meaning of the phrase is that Tom used to be a quiet boy, but now he is not a quiet boy.\nThis is a phrase of unchanging state, so we need to find the time when he was a quiet boy.\n\nAs the meaning is unchanging state, this phrase is a past state, which means that we use the past form for the verb.\n\"Who doesn't give a lot\" means that \"who was\" and not \"who is.\"\n\nInput: What percentage of the class did not pass the exam?\nOutput: Answer: C.\nThe sentence is trying to figure out the percentage of the class that the exam was intended for.\nThe rest of the sentence uses the word class as people.\nBut class is a noun, so we don't say \"what percentage of me the exam was intended for\" to say, who did not pass.\nThe rest of this sentence says, \"out of...\" so we should start by multiplying the numerator times 100, which means converting it to a percentage", "answer": "C: winning or losing"}

All dandelion flowers turn to fluff after drying. Dandelions are unique since they have three stems and four petals on every flower. Each stem grows out of the flower and is attached to the flowers petals. They grow in a triangle formation and have a fuzzy looking head at the top of the stems. Another unique characteristic of dandelions is that they are also able to grow their roots down through rocks. If a dandelion is in a field with many other plants, like in the garden, it will have a hard time surviving. But if they are by themselves, they will be more likely to live longer.\nOutput: A dandelion has white petals on it.\nA dandelion has a triangular shape with three stems in the middle.\nA dandleione has two stems that extend outside of it. The flower will eventually fall apart and will blow away in the wind.\nDandelions grow white fluff after they dry.

D is sitting next to C such that he is at southeast of B in a counterclockwise direction to B. Who is sitting at north-east of C?\nOutput: Since A is sitting facing north, the other 4 sitters must be facing counterclockwise. In that case A and B is the counterclockwise direction, so B is facing north.\nC is to the south of B, so D is to the southwest of C and faces counterclockwise.\nD is also to the southeast of B, so he faces counterclockwise. So he and C are both facing counterclockwise at the same direction, which means C and D are facing together.\nSince C is facing CW direction and D is facing CCW direction to CB (from C to B), D and C are facing in opposite direction, thus D and C is facing the opposite direction. And therefore D and C are facing north-east direction compared to each other.\nSo the final direction will be BNW", "answer": "B: feel good"}

Every living thing has a life cycle. It means living things grow, then make lots of babies, and then die! If you look at almost any living thing, you will see similar stages to any life cycle.\nThe stages include one or more of the following:\ngrowth (replication).

For example \"the egg-to-adult life cycle\" means that the organism starts from an egg, grows an adult, and then dies (senescence), or simply \"the life cycle of the elephant\". \"All life cycles have common characteristics that are also found in artificial chemical cycles\".\nIn entomology, the life cycle is the process wherein insects develop from egg to adult.\nThis can be divided into a number of phases, but these phases can overlap. The \"egg-to-adult\" phase is also known as development. The adult body is then often referred to as the imago stage.\nThere are two general ways of categorizing life cycles, which can be called complete and incomplete life cycles. In both these schemes the common characteristic is that the individuals reach sexual maturity through a series of distinct phases.\nAn incomplete life cycle is one that has a life stage where development is arrested at adult stage.

Bread 1 cookie 1 can of diced tomatoes 1 potato 1 apple 5 cans of coke 2 plastic containers of milk 3 eggs 1 small bag of chips 1 lemon 3 small bags of candy 5 small bags of peanuts 3 oranges 4 small glasses of water\nOutput: First, determine the amount of food. We use our knowledge about food, that we see in the image. This helps us determine the total amount by looking at how much each container contains. First find out the total for eggs. They each take up 1/2 of a basket. Secondly, look at the size of an apple, it is approximately half of a can. Thirdly, a cookie or small bag of candy weighs approximately three items, each item weighing the same. Fourthly, milk is 1-2 cups of milk, each cup holding 8 ounces of milk. Finally, find the amount to drink in an average of 8oz. We find that 8 is 432 cups (one cup of water equals 8oz).

Now, determine the difference between the time I wish to spend on fairgrounds and the time I will really spend: 16+7= <<16+5=40>>40 hours\nSince I can only spend 8 hours at the fairgrounds each day, I will have 40-8 = <<40-8=32>>38 free hours.

His brother who is on the other side of world(international call) costs him 25 cents for a minute. Hence the total cost by including international call is 310 cents.\nAdd up both the costs: 220 c + 420 c= 640 cents.\nMultiply the total cost by 10 to get the money Freddy lost. 640\u00d710= 6400 dollars", "answer": "A: few people"}

When the wing tips move through the air, it creates pressure causing a thrust. But when the wing is not moving, it creates nothing.  Why doesn't it generate lift?\nOutput: A plane's wings create lift mainly by air moving around the wing's shape (there is slight resistance, but not enough to cause an aerodynamic force). The higher the speed, the more air will flow, creating more of an aerodynamic force (lift).\nThe plane is making the wings move by moving the controls. Since the wing will not create lift when it is not moving, we can conclude the plane has nothing to do with generating lift when the wing is stationary.\nSo the final questions are A & B\n\nInput: What is a prime number?

The number of males in this town is 441. The ratio of men to women is 3 to 4. However, 60 families moved to the city after new jobs appeared. Of the 60 families, 48 are women while the remaining are men. How many men and women now live in the town in total?\nOutput: With the information above we begin by calculating the number of men, then we can calculate the number of women. We start by understanding we have 441 men so we have (441 + 60) in total. Now that we have this, we have to take half of the total. So, 441 + 2 x 60 = [441 + 120] = <<441+120=561>>561.\nWe now realize we have to take half once again, so 561/2 = 561/1 = <<561/1=561>>285.5\nThe ratio of men to women in the town is 3 to 1 so, let's take the ratio and add it to the numbers above. [561/1] -3 + 441 = {561/(1 -3)} -3 + (441) = {(561 \u00f7 (1 -3)) -3 + (416)} \u2248 {[(561 \u00f7 0-3) * 3 ]-3}+441 \u2248 {561-1 \u00d75 3 -294+441} \u2248 {562-294+437} \u2248 {096+137} \u2248 233.5\nSo the final answer after rounding to the nearest whole number is 233.\n\nInput: The sum of the digits of a five-digit number is 26.

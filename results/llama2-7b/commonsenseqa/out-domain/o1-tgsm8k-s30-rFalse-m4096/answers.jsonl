How to implement:\n1. The first step is to sort the board row by row\n2. The next step is to traverse each row by row in each iteration. It should record the position that can reach. When entering a position that can reach, the method can check the position recorded in rows before and after. If the position can be reached, then it checks the position for each iteration, finally prints out the correct answer, otherwise it will be recorded as an unreachable position, the next iteration will return to the previous position. Finally, it traverses all rows\n\n### Tips:\n\n1. If the first player makes a mistake, the program should return to the initial state.\n\n2. The correct checkmate state is to check the position of all 4 rows.\n\n\n\n### Related:\n\n1. GameofChess: 8\u5957\u4ee3\u7801\u9898\n\n2. Checkmate:2\n\n\n\n\n\n## 28.

{"idx": 749, "text": "actions\n\n## How to solve these questions\n\n# 1. First, create one array to store the data\n\nIn this example, we create a new array called `week_price_car_rental` first. We will store the price in this array if the rental is more than a week.\n\n```\nweek_price_car = new int[11].\n```\n\nThen we use `for` loop with `start` and `end` index to iterate and save each date's price.\n\n1. Initialise `week_price_rental` and fill `1` in the array index from `0` to `7`\n    ```\n    for (int i = 0; i < week_price_rental.Length; i++) {\n      week_price_rentable[i] = 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n2. For each iteration, if `i == 0` and `i == 4` then replace the value at `i-1 and i-3` respectively by the value at `i`, which will be `30`.\n    ```\n      for (int i = week_price_rentables.Length - 1; i > week_price_rentals.Length || i == 0; i--) {\n        if (i == 4) {\n          week_price_rentel[i-3] = week_price_car_rental;\n        } else {\n          week_rate_rental[i-1] = week_rental;\n        }\n      }\n    ```\n3. For the remaining `i == 1 to 5`, sum the value into the variable.\n    ```\n    Week_Price_Car_Rental = Week_Price_Car + Week_Price\n    ```\n\nIn that way, you can input multiple data and sum it at `end index`.\n\n# 2. For the second code, the trick is sum the value and use loop to search for the min/max value\n\n```\nif(i == 0) {\n   Mininum = startIndex + 1;\n   MininumPrice = week[mininum];\n} else if (i == 11) {\n   Maximum = startIndex;\n   MaximumPrice = week[Maximum", "answer": "C: authentic"}

At times this may work but I found it to be slow and less efficient\n1. Try to figure out what are the different cases and try to make use of the ones required to reach the solution.\n15. If you are stuck try and solve the smaller problem. The chances are that there is a way to solve the larger problem faster.\n16.

Also, assign the return value of input, which will be the text passed in, as the global variable of text.\n\ndef input(text):\n\tprint(text)\n\treturn text\n\n##### 2. Define a function called print_text which accepts a variable as its argument. The function will simply pass that as its argument to output and simply print it, afterward.\n\ndef print_text(text):\n\toutput(text)\n\tprint(text, '\\n')\n\n\n##### 3. Define a function called is_str which accepts two other variables as its arguments. This function should tell us whether or not the passed-in argument is a string.  If it is a string, it will return True. If it is not a string, it will simply return False.\n\ndef is_str(value):\n\treturn type(value) is str\n\n##### 4. In order to pass on information to another function, there is a function called the call built into python. The call takes two variables to be passed through to the subroutine. The first variable is the variable to be output to another function and the second one is the call itself. So for example, call(myvar,print_text) will call the printed_text function with the myvar variable as its argument.\n\nprint_text(mystr) # prints out myvar\n\n##### 5.

Which stations would the passenger need to change trains?\nOutput: If the passenger can get on at Station X in time to take the next available train from Station X to Y (where it will be stopped for five minutes), the passenger must get there immediately by telephone call to station or to get to an important meeting and not let the person who will be arriving at the station after him or her be aware of the change. The passenger will have to change at Z to catch another train that would be stopped for 75 minutes at Station Z. The passenger would be left at N for twenty minutes at a station with a restaurant in that time because you can't have a wait at a restaurant or store where you can't take your luggage inside until the train comes to the station where the passenger would be met by the person who brought him or her to station Z and taken to the place he or she would like to arrive at. If the passenger would be meeting someone who brought the passenger from Z to N, they would need to be met. If the person who brought the passenger from N to X was a person who had met the passenger from N to Z, the passenger wouldn't need to meet that person because a passenger who just got off the train at Z will know where to expect a passenger to arrive at X unless the driver's license was lost or stolen or there was an accident, a bomb threat, or a terrorist act.\nThis is a train that you couldn't catch without running if you stayed where it stopped.\n\n\nInput:How do you know the height of a tall building?\nOutput: Look at the nearest hill and then subtract the floor number from the number on top.

Then, a few years later, the fish returns and asks the programmer \"What's your greatest fear?\" The programmer says \"I fear a large number that is odd as it is prime\" The fish tells her to go down river 100 ft and she will find a nice house. She is amazed and walks over to a house, knocks on the door, and they invite her in. She explains the situation and the family invites her to stay as long as she wants.

You may already be familiar with some ways to represent numbers. I recommend you start with learning decimal (base10) number.\n\nSo now, the question is how do we translate numbers to languages (instructions) that can be understood.\n\nConsider a set of 10 digits as a base to begin working with. This gives us a total of 10 digits or ten base (in this case 10) units. We number or label the digits 0 through 9 which are called decimal numbers because they are based on 10 or 10 base units. The base, or number of possible digits in a number is called the number of base or the base of a number. \n\n## Instruction (continued)\n\nWe do not always have 10 digits to represent a number in our base; sometimes we use fewer than 10 digits. Take another look at binary notation:\n\n1001010\n\nIn a binary representation, we use \"bits\". Each bit can be labelled a zero or a one (0 or 1). In case of 10010001 it is 0 or 1 or both. One more digit of 100011 will only be a binary of 0s and 1s.\n\n## Input\n\nThe question asks to  convert a number to binary and then a question asks to use the binary number as instruction. The last question asks a binary of a week number (8 digit number in binary). \n\n## Input (continued) \n\n\n## Output\n## Instruction:Write a program that reads a character from the keyboard (press enter/return to input a whitespace), and adds it to a string to the end of the string.\n## Output:Write a string onto the screen that is the addition of all the items stored in the string.\n\n## Instruction:Use a character reader on a computer to read every character on screen to the string. \n## Instruction:When the program detects any characters in the string that appear more than once in a  row, print those characters to the screen.\n\n## Output:\nIf the characters are repeated", "answer": "A: seaside town"}

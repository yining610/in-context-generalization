You are the captain of a space ship. You can fire either one or two laser beams at a time. You also have a shield that will absorb 5 laser beams before it breaks. However, the shield regenerates 1 beam every 3 seconds. How many beams can you fire before your shield breaks, Choices:  A. 1, 4, 4 B. 0, 2, 3 C. 6, 6, 5 D. 4, 7 or more E. 0, 7 or more\n\n### Response. I can answer this question. The amount of laser energy that goes through the shield is 5 + 5 + 5 in 3 seconds. So, it is 11 laser beams in 1 minute, and 11 in 60 seconds = 650 beams. Therefore, the shield breaks at 650 beats = 650/60 = <<650/6=10.83>>10.83 beams per minute.

What state has the fewest residents?\nRationales:'The fewest residents' means the state with the fewest residents.\n\nThe total possible passengers is 500.\nSince the passenger from Illinois is 19 and the passenger from Texas is 54 = <<500*19=9900>>9900, the passenger from Illinois is not taken into account.\nTherefore, the passenger from Texas is not taken into account, and we are left with 54 + 14 = <<54+14=68>>68.\nBut we subtract a traveler from Illinois to get its total travelers. 14 - 19 = <<14-19=8>>8.

{"text": "The community garden was demolished to make room for a wasteland instead of a desert or a parking lot.\n\n### Rationale:Parking lots do not typically take the place of community gardens. However, a parking lot does replace the desert. The city demolished the community garden to make room for a new wasteland instead of the city's beach. The ocean or a flower garden would not have made good replacements because they would not have been able to fit within the designated space. Therefore, the correct answer is wasteland.\n#### C\nAnswer: A\n\n### Inputs:Two cues have a common denominator. They have different numerators. Answers choices:  i,iii, iv, v\n\n### Rationales:\n* i) 19 is divisible by 5. Because of this, 19 is the common denominator. Therefore, 20 is divisible by 20, which is the same as 1.\n* ii) 29 is divisible by both 7 and 12. They both share a common denominator. Therefore both 29/12 and 29/7 are equivalent. Since they are equivalent, 1/12 is equivalent to 7/29, which is 7/79.\n* iii) Both 9 and 18 are divisible by 9. Therefore, the first term of the ratio is divisible by the third term, which is the same. The only requirement is that the numerator of 22/16 be less than eight. Therefore, 13/36 is equivalent to 22/10.\n* iv) 10/30 is equivalent to 10/10.\n\n* v) 36 is divisible by six. Therefore, they are equivalent.\n\n\n#### v\nAnswer: B\n\n### Rating 3:How many bikes can ride along in a bike lane 1 cm wider than a bike?\nAnswer: B", "answer": "D: parking lot"}

{"text": "B\n\n### Explanation:A bus stop indicates it is a place where you board a bus.A street corner is a meeting place where people may linger, but it is not a place where people line up.A roadblock may be located next to a street, but it is a place where traffic is being stopped. A fast food drive thru may have someone standing near the entrance telling drivers where to go, but it is not the appropriate place to have a sign with some people next to it. A city is made up of people. A sign with people on it might be in a city, but it would be more likely to be found in a park or other public place.\n\n### Difficulty:Medium\n\n### Strategies:\n* If a sign refers to people, you are likely not looking for a street, a bus, or part of the roadway.\n* A sign can be with people.\n\n### Example 5\n\n### What can you infer from a picture of a large group of people?\n\n**I can infer that the group probably contains a lot of men or lots of children, because men and children are seen more frequently in public areas, because they don't go to work as much as women, who appear to be in a smaller group.**\n\n**Infer:Men are more likely to be seen in public,**\n**because they don't work as much as women.**\n**This means that a large group probably contains many men.**\n**Infer:Children are more likely to be out on summer vacation or school holidays,**\n**and their classes are probably smaller than the one where teachers of adults are working.**\n**Many children are on summer vacation, where they may spend more time in a playground,**\n**than the children in a classroom during the school year.**\n**In conclusion:The group may contain many men and many children.**\n\n### Key Points\n\n* Knowledge of general information about population differences\n\n### Strategy\nInferring meaning from a picture\n\n**Strategies:**\n1. **Take note of important details in a picture and describe them.** When you are viewing an image of people, take note of their age differences and their relationships or friendships.\n1. **Ask why a particular group is gathered", "answer": "A: bus stop"}

So he would have a total of 48 miles (45\u00b0 + 35\u00b0 = 80\u00b0, 80\u00b0 = 48\u00b0).\nIf Bill was in marshes of the Everglades, he might reasonably be in Florida.\n#### A\nAnswer: A\n\n\n### Instructions: Answer the following multiple choice question by matching the proper letter to each numbered answer choice.\n\n##### 1.

There are six ways you can add whole numbers.\n\nThe first way to add two whole numbers is by counting starting at a given number. The second way is by counting backward starting from an unknown number. Another method is to count by starting from an actual base 10 value. In the third method, you count by a starting a point and writing the first number. You can also count forward starting from the end and keeping track of the second number on a piece of paper or a calculator. These four ways can help you add two whole numbers more easily. In the end, the math operation is the same no matter which one you use, but the method you use is different.\n\n#### Addition Formula:\nThe second way to add two whole number is by the addition formula called the long addition formula\n\nAddition Formula : The sum of n(n+1) + n(n+2) +..", "answer": "E: desk"}

The students added all of the numbers in the equation and then divided that total by the number of students. The equation stated, \"Let J be 86 more than S. Z is 21 less than J. Q is 2 less than Z. T is 4 times R. R is twice Q. W is 3 times T. A is 3 less than W. N is half T. N is half A. N + A = 45. F is 5 less than N. J \u2013 F = 23. What is the value of R?\"\nRationales: For 45, J - F = 23, so the sum is 23 +3 = <<23+3=26>>26.\nSince there are 26/2 = <<26/2=13>>13 students, the total value is R \u00d7 13 = <<R*13=169>>169 so R = <<R=17>>17.\nTherefore, the values of R for the two conditions are R = <<R=27>>2 and R = <<R=78>>84 respectively and since 2 \u00d7 78 = <<2*78=156>>156 = 2 \u00d7 79 = <<2*79=158>>158 and 84 + 158 = <<84+158=242>>242 that the values are 27 and 78.\n\n\n### Output: Output 1\n#### 169\n#### 27\n\n### Output 2: Output 1\n\n### 313\n### 25\n###\n\n### Input\n\nHow many baskets of fruit did Danny sell in all?

A: 2 boys B: 3 boys C: 4 boys D: 5 boys\n\nReason: The numerator of the first fraction expresses the number of girls in the group: 6/5.\nThe denominator is the number of girls in a population chosen randomly: 1/5.\n\nThis works out to 120 \u00f7 5, which is 24.

The denominator for the second fraction is 1/8, which is 8 girls.\nWe take 3/8 of girls, which is 4.\n\nSo if 4 out of 8 girls are in the chessen club, the fraction represents the number of boys in that club. In order to compare it with the first fraction, we need to multiply 4 by 14 because we divide the fraction: 1/14.\n\nThat is 56.

This experience could change one\u2019s views about the beauty of the Earth, as well as the environmental concerns.\n\nIf not for the scientific research, the humanity today could not be so prosperous. It is the scientific knowledge and discoveries that have advanced civilization. The scientific knowledge increased the humanity's understanding of the Earth and the universe, as well as their understanding of the nature. The scientific research is the foundation for the knowledge in the entire scientific fields, such as medicine, engineering, business, sociology, biology, etc. \n\nThe humanity is continuously advancing because of the scientific research. When people discover something new through scientific research, they are filled with a sense of new understanding. This leads to the development of new inventions and discoveries. For example, the advancement of technology led to the creation of such things as the Internet, satellite, and smartphone. These inventions allow us to communicate with people we have never met, as well as allowing people from around the globe who are not able to meet each other to connect or cooperate via the computer.\n\nThe increased", "answer": "E: see things differently"}

Every spring, these trees release new sprouts from their roots, and after several weeks the roots become more and more shallow and eventually die. When the scientists left the island a few years after their experiments started, the pepper trees were all dead. Scientists then tested the idea on another island and found the plants died the same way, despite a different climate. But scientists thought this type of growth wouldn\u2019t work on another island. In 1996, scientists began studying the way in which pepper trees grow in another, very different island.

There is no way this is a math problem.\n\nIt is also not gravity since the problem does not explain any type of gravity or laws so it does not fit the description.\n\n### Input: Write a sentence explaining how to divide 90 by a tenth.\n\n### Response:\"Divide the number 90 by 10\"\n\n### Input\"120 and 393 are prime numbers.

However, learning can still take place without proper or even any amount of sleep. This suggests that one is not required to nap if they want to learn. Therefore, B is incorrect since a nap is not known to directly help with learning.\n\n#### Naps are not know to directly help learning so it is not necessary to naps, hence, Kenny is incorrect. Choice D, Learning taking place without sleep is true (and it is implied that learning also can take place with sleep by Kenny's comment as well as Julie's playing many hours, however sleep is not explicitly stated and thus this choice is still true.)\n\nInput: How far is the drive from the capitol building to the state penitentiary?

The sum of the numbers which are in the table is: 3 + 4 + 8 + 10 + 14 + 9 + 10 = 56. The sum of the first half of the table is: 9 + 3 + 4 = 16. The sum of each set in the table is:  9 + 3 +  4 + 10 +   8 + 14 +  10 + 9 + 4 + 12 + 3 = 73  16+(56-13)=112  6+56-13=79  45+56-17=98 The sum of the sixth row is 25 which means the last line is the 25th one from the last one.\n\n#### 25\nAnswer: 25\n\n### Instructoin: What other 2-digit numbers will produce 25 when each number from 1 to 50 is added to it?\n\n### Demostration: Start from 10.

We used to have no interpersonal relations. People did their work but did not communicate or cooperate with others unless they were asked specifically.\n>\n> We met and tried to find ways to resolve our problems, and we decided that we should work together to make more sales. One of our customers was from Texas, and each office had their sales department that would contact the client from their office. When the customer asked where his goods were, the person in the office closest to that person would go get them, even though it wasn\u2019t their job to do so. This happened most of the time, and after a while, each office started to make more business with that customer and other new customers, too. And then all of the offices started to act more cooperatively. We are a lot more successful now that we all work together in a friendly environment and we help each other out a lot", "answer": "C: corner"}

Since this option is referring to what one could refer to another person, it is most correct for the answer to be C.\nFor example,\nA man who owns a cupboard may choose the answer and say \"This means me.\" or he may choose the meaning of the cupboard.

{"text": "In the context of this task, the students are supposed to recognize that the correct option is E.\nIn the sentence \u201c\u2026 if clothes have developed a sm\u2026,\u201d the students should guess which word should be replaced by an appropriate alternative, based on the context. In order to do so, they must remember that they should add contextual information to a word in order to understand it.\nTo \u201chang in closet\u201d means to put a person, animal, place, or object in a position where the person, animal, or place remains standing. So this option is not the best one since clothes are not objects like people.\nTo \u201csniff\u201d means to smell intensely. So, this option is not the correct one since smelling clothes is not common since they do not have a nose like a person.\nTo \u201cget dirty\u201d means to become unclean. So, this option also is not appropriate since dirty clothes are clothes that lose their original clean color and become unclean. The correct option is E meaning \u201cto air out.\u201d In this case, the students should understand that to air out clothes means to let them stay in the air, usually outside, on a windy day.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. Clothes are not objects like people but are clothes.\n- Therefore, the correct option is E (air out).\n\n2. To smell strongly with one\u2019s nose is possible only for living objects that have noses like humans.\n- So, the option A (get dirty) is not appropriate because humans cannot smell clothes.\n\n3. The color of clothes is not alive like the noses of humans.\n- So option B (sniff) is not appropriate.\n\n4. Clothes cannot stay out in the wind (unless they are tied) like people and animals.\n- Therefore, option C (hang in closet) is not appropriate. \n\n5. Clothes have no body where wind blows on them and they cannot become unclean like humans and animals. Instead, they lose their original clean color.\n- So, option D (made soiled) is not appropriate. They must be replaced.  \n\n### Input  : What is the first step to take to make cheesecake?\n\n### Response  :\nThe first step to making cheesecake is to make a batter.

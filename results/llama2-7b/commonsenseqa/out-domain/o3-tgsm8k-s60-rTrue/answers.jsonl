They were not economically organized or advanced.\n\nOutput:\nThere were differences:\n(A) Population: Although the population of some of the British North American colonies decreased significantly as a result of Native American diseases after 1660, the overall population grew as a result of immigration.\n(B) A military presence: A military presence in the British North American colonization also did not change much in the 35-year period. However, England had started making alliances with Native American tribes in 1667, making the colonies safer by providing protection from hostile tribes.\n(C) Politics: There were no large changes in colonial governance before and after 1665. At that time the only colonies controlled by the Crown were Newfoundland, New England, and East Jersey. It was not until 1666, when the British government imposed the Dominion of New York and the Dominion of New England, that there was a significant increase in the number of colonies ruled by the Crown.\n(D) The economic development: The most significant change during the 18th century was that the production of foodstuffs, trade, and industry declined in America.

Tom starts at the starting point 9 kilometers behind and runs a marathon. After the marathon, how far does John run and when is he 9 kilometers behind Tom?\nOutput:John and Tom's paths are similar, so both their paths' lengths are 20 kilometers.\nIf that is the case, John and Tom both start at the starting point at the same time.\nThe time John takes is 11/20 = <<11/20=0.55>>0.55, and the time Tom takes is 18/20 = << 18/2=0.9>>0.9\nSo the time when John is 6 kilometers behind Tom is when the starting point is 6/20 = <<6/20=00.3>>00.3 away from the finish line.\nSo the time when they are 6 kilometers and 00.3 away is 11/0.1 = <<11/0.30.1>>10.3 = <<10.3>>10.3 kilometers.\nTherefore, the time John spends running a marathon is 11 - 10.3 = <11-10.3=0.7>>0.7 kilmeters.\nJohn ends the marathon at 00.7 seconds after 00.3 and Tom ends his marathon at 0.3 seconds later after 00.7 and 00.1 at the same time after 0.3 seconds of running.\nSo John runs a marathon in 00 hours and 00 minutes = <<00: 00>>00:00\n\nInput:If an ant runs 35 km in 1 minute and 1 ant is equal to 38 ants when the rest of ants are 2 times larger than it, how many ants are in its colony?\nOutput:'C'\n\nInput:If there are as much as 100 fish in a pond, how much fish do we need to catch 50% of them?\nOutput:'B'", "answer": "C: castle"}

How far from the station are both buses?\nOutput: 3.5 miles apart.\nSolution: The first bus went 5 miles and the second 2 miles, so they are 5 miles apart. Since there were 900 people on both buses, divide 900/2 = <<900/2=450>>450 by 5 = <<900d/2=455>>455 since both buses split from the same station. So, 455/2 = <<455/2=227>>227 people got off their bus at the first stop and 227 + 450 = <<227+450=677>>677 had to wait. 677 passengers divided by 2 = <<677/2=338>>338 got on the bus on the next stop, and 338 \u00d7 5 = <<338*5=1690>>1690 remain at the bus station or on the bus. 1690 - 900 = <<1690-900=790>>790 people made the trip overall, so they will continue to travel for 790/2 = <<790/2=395>>395 more miles until they reach their destination, where they will have to unload 790 + 395 = <<790+395=1185>>1185 people.", "answer": "A: train station"}

Choices: A: And B: But C: Or D: Since E: If \nOutput:If you start a sentence with 'And' or 'But', it will sound quite awkward.  In this case, you have to choose the following solution....\nConjunctions can be used at the beginning of a sentence as well as in the middle and at the end of the sentence. However, it is preferable to use them at the end of the sentences to join the contrasting or opposing elements within sentences, especially in case of a compound sentence.\nThe simple sentences are started by the punctuation marks, such as \u2018comma\u2019, \u2018semicolon\u2019, \u2018colon\u2019, \u2018hyphen\u2019, and \u2018dash\u2019.

The distance cannot be measure because it will change every day and the ruler cannot be owned different people. Therefore, there are no multiple ruler that different by people in the distance.\nI picked answer D because the word ruler in ruler in answer D is possessive pronoun, it means we already talked about ruling which is the other name of ruler in the previous answer.

What is the distance between New York and Chicago?\nOutput: Since the bus trip takes < 38 hours, that's how many hours it travels every hour. But they can't travel from 12 AM to 1 AM at the same time every hour.\nIn order to make sure that they move the same distance every hour, they need to have enough rest to make sure that they can start at the same time for the next trip.\nIf the bus travels 38 hours, it means that it has enough time to stay in both states for one hour.\n\nThat way, if the bus starts at noon in New York, it can get to Chicago at 1 PM, so to make sure that the bus gets to Chicago at 1, it needs one hour in New York and one hour in Chicago, so a total of 2 hours of rest.  If it leaves New York at noon, then it takes more than one hour, so it makes sense for it to travel 10 hours at the most.\nBut that doesn't account for any time it travels while it's in one of the states.\nSo it still takes 2 hours to go from New York to Chicago.\n\nIf you take 2 more hours in Chicago, and use 10 hours in New York, all of it adds up.\nThat means that we can't have <12,22,32,42,52,62,72> as the answer, so if you have other ideas about time zones in the US, it won't work out for this problem because those time zones don't line up together.\n\nInstruction:Write a program to answer the following problems.\nInput: Janet was at her grandma's house one week, but then flew to Florida the next week.

{"text": "A) It can be either A and B only.\n\nDuring sleep, we have a natural tendency to breathe slower and with a lower volume of air. As a result, this process may cause us to snore, making sounds during sleep. In the next paragraph, we will explain the most common causes of snoring and what we can do to stop it.\nAs a result, if it occurs while sleeping, it is usually a symptom of sleep apnea. This is because this can cause some of your body parts to move and affect your breathing. When this happens, your mouth may open because you fall asleep or wake up suddenly. Because of this, snoring occurs because the air is pushed.\n\nDue to a blockage of your upper airway passages, sleep apnea is caused by snoring. This is referred to as sleep apnea. When air in the throat is obstructed from reaching the lungs, the process is called snoring. An individual with this type of apnea can snore loudly, yet never stop breathing. This is why sleep apnea can cause serious medical issues such as high blood pressure and increased risk of stroke.\nIt is often believed that snoring is associated with a person falling asleep.

Well the median of any set of 6 numbers should be even, that leaves 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, right? The second one is not even, therefore I would call it the mode, but that is not the case always, because in some sets, there is no second median, so 4 can be the first and 5 is the second, but if you do not see the median or it is 4 or 5, then it would be 4(or 5)\n\nInput: If there is a stale odor coming from the kitchen what should one check for and source of the odor.

After flying 60 miles, it doubled its speed and continued flying until it reached its destination. If its destination was 220 miles from its starting point, how long did it take it to get there?<n>Output: It is never flying in a straight path.<n>Therefore, after increasing its speed, it makes 60 x 2 = <<60*2=120>>120 miles in the same time period that it would take it on its original path with only 60 miles.<n>Then, at 120 miles, it doubles its speed. Then the bird is able to travel another 30 miles, adding 30 to its total.<n>Therefore, the total distance taken to get to its final destination was 30 + 120 = <<30+120=150>>150 miles.<n>So, the bird traveled 150 miles in 150/2 = << 150/3-6-6 = 138 >> 138 minutes.<n>So, the total time it took was 90/3 - 6 - 6

Choices:  A: remember B: help C: count D: winning E: dealing<n>Output:		When you play cards at a Las Vegas casino, you can't remember the cards that you have played in the past. This is because you can't count them. If you cheat by getting the next player to do the counting, you could get your cards seized and you could pay the casino an amount of money if you lose, so you can't do any of those either. You can't win or help since you can't tell if your partner wants extra help or a little more luck.<n><n>Input:In a game of chance, how could you reduce the amount of luck in the outcome? Choose the best answer. A: use more decks.<n>B: use less decks. C: use multiple rounds. D: increase the odds of winning.<n>Output:You can improve the odds of winning by betting low on the outcome such as betting on red, getting 21 from the fist roll of the die, picking white dice when there are 2 black, etc.<n>Also, you can use more decks. However, increasing the number of decks will increase your odds of losing. So, when you put more than one deck of cards out, the total number of possible combinations has grown into many more outcomes since it is now equal to the number of cards in each deck, rather than the number of decks, so the odds of winning would go down.<n><n><n><n>Input:The number of seconds in a day, in the USA, is not always the same.

And F is the answer<n>Therefore, the final answer is  love<n><n>### Detailed explanation:<n>#### A. Necessity<n>Necessity means that something cannot or must be done, and nothing can replace it.<n>So I think "A" cannot be the answer since talking and communicating can be alternative activities to replace chatting in class.  Talking and communicating can be also classified as talking.<n>We can remove "B" and "C" from our list. <n><n>#### B. Answers<n>The answer choices are irrelevant. <n>All the answers are "answers".<n>I'm confused how B can be an answer choice. <n>In our classroom, we just sit and listen to the lectures.  We will not engage in answering questions.<n>So I remove "C" from a choice list.<n><n>#### C. Inspiration<n>What is the inspiration? Inspiration can be an idea, feelings, and other things.<n>"C" cannot be the answer because in our classroom we engage in chatting not chattering. <n><n>#### D. Love<n>I choose this one.<n>Love means that you do favors or something of that nature because you can't live without it.<n>If you don't chat with friends in class, you are not loved. <n>So the best answer is "Love".<n><n>### Question 5.<n>#### E. Fun<n>I choose this one because "B" means that you have to answer or something of that nature when the teacher asks the questions, but we are not answering any questions. <n>The question says class and teacher, so we are not talking with friends in class.  <n><n>#### F. Nothing<n>"F" is the correct answer. <n>According to the definition, it means that you are doing something you like. Since we engage in chating with friends in class, which we like, we are doing a thing we wanted to do.  <n><n>

If both sides are divisible by 3 and the difference between them is equivalent to A modulus 9, then 7(modulus 9) ≡ A ( mod). The difference between the two sides of the equation is 3 and as we all know 3 ≡ 1 mod 9, then the value of A is 4, so our answer is 4<n><n>Input

For instance, if you have a mirror image and you put your eye in the middle, they would be crossed. Then if you have a mirror you'll see both eyes are crossed together. This is not crossed up and what we can see through the mirror is like, one eye is closed and the other one is wide open. This is not correct because the eye that is closed and the eye that is opened is different. In choice (b), what we can see through our imaginary mirror we have one eye closed and the other one that is wide open. This, we can see, both eyes are open. This is a correct mirror reflection.<n><n>#Answer for this question<n><n>The correct option is option C.

Choices:  A: wasteland B: ocean C: desert D: parking lot E: flowers<n>Output:		The options that are valid are  A, C, and D.<n>It is said that the community garden was demolished  for the what for another, (since  A, C, D,<n>B are irrelevant). For options D, it is not said that that the community garden was<n>dismantled (to another what?), It is said that that for another, to another what, was<n>demolished, this implies is that dismantled for another the what is demolished.  It,<n>then, must have been previously demolished, for the city for its  another what? Since<n>it was demolished for the demolished, and for another, what, it had not been already <n>demolished. Therefore the correct option is option B  B. It is not said that it was<n>dismantling for another what?  therefore that, it was demolished not for dismantling.<n>So the final word is D.  A. A wasteland.<n>A wasteland implies to unused land. When land is not used, it is useless.  It's<n>either productive land, or unproductive land. It does not make sense as a dismatled<n>garden will not continue to be a wasteland.<n>C. A desert land. The only relevant information that is known is that 22000<n>houses were destroyed, (and another 40000 will be destroyed), and that a desert was<n>in the area. Deserts are unproductive lands and it doesn't make any sense.<n>D. A. Community garden. The final  is demolished of a garden that was<n>demolished. But a garden is definitely productive land  and also desert is<n>unproductive land.<n>Gardens can produce  vegetables, which will eat, can be sold, or planted.<n>So D is the correct answer  D. Another community garden was demolished.<n><n>Output: There were five men on the boat, and there were twice as many men in the canoe.

John runs 11 kilometers and goes in the water to cool himself then continue running. Tom starts at the starting point 9 kilometers behind and runs a marathon. After the marathon, how far does John run and when is he 9 kilometers behind Tom?<n>Output:John and Tom's paths are similar, so both their paths' lengths are 20 kilometers.<n>If that is the case, John and Tom both start at the starting point at the same time.<n>The time John takes is 11/20 = <<11/20=0.55>>0.55, and the time Tom takes is 18/20 = << 18/2=0.9>>0.9<n>So the time when John is 6 kilometers behind Tom is when the starting point is 6/20 = <<6/20=00.3>>00.3 away from the finish line.<n>So the time when they are 6 kilometers and 00.3 away is 11/0.1 = <<11/0.30.1>>10.3 = <<10.3>>10.3 kilometers.<n>Therefore, the time John spends running a marathon is 11 - 10.3 = <11-10.3=0.7>>0.7 kilmeters.<n>John ends the marathon at 00.7 seconds after 00.3 and Tom ends his marathon at 0.3 seconds later after 00.7 and 00.1 at the same time after 0.3 seconds of running.<n>So John runs a marathon in 00 hours and 00 minutes = <<00: 00>>00:00<n><n>Input:If an ant runs 35 km in 1 minute and 1 ant is equal to 38 ants when the rest of ants are 2 times larger than it, how many ants are in its colony?<n>Output:'C'<n><n>Input:If there are as much as 100 fish in a pond, how much fish do we need to catch 50% of them?<n>Output:'B'<n><n>

A second bus carrying 400 people leaves the same station and travels 2 miles. How far from the station are both buses?<n>Output: 3.5 miles apart.<n>Solution: The first bus went 5 miles and the second 2 miles, so they are 5 miles apart. Since there were 900 people on both buses, divide 900/2 = <<900/2=450>>450 by 5 = <<900d/2=455>>455 since both buses split from the same station. So, 455/2 = <<455/2=227>>227 people got off their bus at the first stop and 227 + 450 = <<227+450=677>>677 had to wait. 677 passengers divided by 2 = <<677/2=338>>338 got on the bus on the next stop, and 338 × 5 = <<338*5=1690>>1690 remain at the bus station or on the bus. 1690 - 900 = <<1690-900=790>>790 people made the trip overall, so they will continue to travel for 790/2 = <<790/2=395>>395 more miles until they reach their destination, where they will have to unload 790 + 395 = <<790+395=1185>>1185 people.

Choices:  A: roof B: room C: floor D: apartment E: neighbor's house<n>Output:		The number that corresponds to the statement "put furniture on top of the building" is letter `E`.<n>Following is the explanation. We are asked to choose furniture item for the question, which means item in one of the categories given in options. Given options will be roof, room, floor and apartment (it is possible that they live in apartment). We can consider that the floor is part of room hence floor is a subcategory of room and we can eliminate roof when we are asked to put furniture on a part of building. Since we have eliminated roof in choice(B) and (E) we can eliminate (C). So the only options which remain are (A) and (E). Since the question was about top of building, we can assume (E) as the only option. So the final answer is (E)<n><n>Input: What do you usually see in a doctor’s office? Choices: A. Door B. Patient C. Pillow D. Nurse E. X-ray machine F. Drug<n>Output: Options (A) and (F) include patient and nurse, so any doctor will have one. We can easily eliminate (C) and (E). (B) and (D) show that someone who is hurt goes to the doctor; we can eliminate (D) and move on to (B). (B) shows the doctor checking a patient and getting a prescription: this takes a few minutes, so we can eliminate (A). We are left with (B) and (F). (B) shows that the doctor checks a patient and decides that further medical advice is needed from a specialist. Since (F) is the name of one of those specialists, the doctor should prescribe a different specialist and move on to (F). We need to be careful, though; a doctor might refer a patient to a specialist who is not one of (F), so we can’t eliminate (F) until the patient actually comes to believe that the problem is in a different area of the body, and goes a specialist that treats that area. However, once the patient goes to a specialist it can’t come to the doctor again, so we can eliminate all options other than (F). The conclusion is that every doctor should prescribe a specialist. (F) is an option that includes the specialist, so all specialists should appear on this list

So we can eliminate B,E,D,C.<n>A: does that mean doing something to hurt someone causes you do to feel sorry? No, it can't mean that. That would give rise to an infinite loop. So, A can't be the correct answer.<n>B: if you feel sorry for hurting the other person, does that mean you don't trust God? No, since if you trust God for everything, then that makes you feel guilty. So, it can't be an answer either.<n>D: riding a bike is just an act to cross the road and it doesn't have a feeling of the person who is hurt/hurts. So it can't be right.<n>C: This is also not true. Trusting God means we completely let God be responsible for things. So again it can't be the right answer.<n>So, if the correct answer is A and B can't be the answer. The correct answer is lend money.<n>So, the answer is lend money<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question<n>1. Pete ran 2 blocks. Then he climbed the ladder 4 more than the number of blocks he ran.

Choices:  A: measure distance B: england C: office D: drawer E: desk<n>Output:		C<n>You cannot find multiple ruler that owned by different people in any other places except office, desk and drawer.<n>I picked answer A because I think that it is possible to find multiple ruler that different people own in drawer like the teacher at school. So my answer is incorrect.<n>I picked answer B because  I think it is impossible to find a multiple ruler that owned different people in measure distance. The distance cannot be measure because it will change every day and the ruler cannot be owned different people. Therefore, there are no multiple ruler that different by people in the distance.<n>I picked answer D because the word ruler in ruler in answer D is possessive pronoun, it means we already talked about ruling which is the other name of ruler in the previous answer. I picked answer A because there is a ruler in drawer but the ruler only can be used by that particular person. If there are multiple ruler then we will lose the meaning of drawer. This is the explanation why my answer is incorrect<n>I picked answer C because it is impossible to find multiple ruler in measure distance<n>I picked answer E because the word ruler cannot be owned by other people, there are only one ruler in question. We cannot talk about ruler when we are talking about ruling which means to measure or judge. If there is multiple ruler and it is owned by different people then we cannot find the multiple ruler in the drawer because then we cannot judge anything except that the ruler is owned by different people. This is the explanation of why I picked wrong answer. This explanation is the only correct answer for question A<n>I picked answer B which is England because it can help us find multiple ruler that belong to different people. The word england can be translated as king or a country which I think can make a multiple ruler which belong to different people or a different king or a different country. The word England can be translated this way because it is a plural word England contains two i's and its plural but there is only one t and only one r. This is how to find out how the answer B becomes C.<n><n>Input: The number of girls in a classroom is 3/100 of the number of boys in the same classroom.

What is the distance between New York and Chicago?<n>Output: Since the bus trip takes < 38 hours, that's how many hours it travels every hour. But they can't travel from 12 AM to 1 AM at the same time every hour.<n>In order to make sure that they move the same distance every hour, they need to have enough rest to make sure that they can start at the same time for the next trip.<n>If the bus travels 38 hours, it means that it has enough time to stay in both states for one hour.<n><n>That way, if the bus starts at noon in New York, it can get to Chicago at 1 PM, so to make sure that the bus gets to Chicago at 1, it needs one hour in New York and one hour in Chicago, so a total of 2 hours of rest.  If it leaves New York at noon, then it takes more than one hour, so it makes sense for it to travel 10 hours at the most.<n>But that doesn't account for any time it travels while it's in one of the states.<n>So it still takes 2 hours to go from New York to Chicago.<n><n>If you take 2 more hours in Chicago, and use 10 hours in New York, all of it adds up.<n>That means that we can't have <12,22,32,42,52,62,72> as the answer, so if you have other ideas about time zones in the US, it won't work out for this problem because those time zones don't line up together.<n><n>Instruction:Write a program to answer the following problems.<n>Input: Janet was at her grandma's house one week, but then flew to Florida the next week.

Since we cannot have two phone book names in the same person, we can exclude the people who have three names and more, so the answer is 365 less, or <<365-3> 362.<n>Therefore, 362 people have more than one phone book name.<n>So the final count is 362<n><n>Input: In three consecutive even-numbered years, the per capita consumption of pizza in Florida is 18, 19, and 20 pieces per person. In the fourth year, the consumption increased by 6%. How many pieces of pizza does the average person consume in four consecutive years?<n>Output: In the first year when the consumption is 18, when the number of people is divided by the consumption the number of people for each consuming 18 piece is 0.18 = <<0.18=9>>9, meaning that there were 9 people consuming 18 pieces in that year. Similarly, in the second year, with consumption increased by 6% to 19, divided by 18 to know the number dividing with 19 means there are 9.2 or 10 people consuming 19 piece pizza.<n>In the third year, since consumption increased by 6%, the number of people dividing by 20 (and we already know that 20 piece of pizza/person consuming) is 0.06 is 10 so there were 10 people consuminng 20 piece pizza. All in all we have: <<

Choices:  A: snoring B: talking C: get cold D: nothing E: might dream<n>Output:		A) It can be either A and B only.<n><n>During sleep, we have a natural tendency to breathe slower and with a lower volume of air. As a result, this process may cause us to snore, making sounds during sleep. In the next paragraph, we will explain the most common causes of snoring and what we can do to stop it.<n>As a result, if it occurs while sleeping, it is usually a symptom of sleep apnea. This is because this can cause some of your body parts to move and affect your breathing. When this happens, your mouth may open because you fall asleep or wake up suddenly. Because of this, snoring occurs because the air is pushed.<n><n>Due to a blockage of your upper airway passages, sleep apnea is caused by snoring. This is referred to as sleep apnea. When air in the throat is obstructed from reaching the lungs, the process is called snoring. An individual with this type of apnea can snore loudly, yet never stop breathing. This is why sleep apnea can cause serious medical issues such as high blood pressure and increased risk of stroke.<n>It is often believed that snoring is associated with a person falling asleep. While this may be true in some cases, snoring occurs when we are actually awake. Thus, this could be a sign that you are sleeping.<n>When we breathe out air through a narrowed space, snoring occurs.<n>The most common cause of snoring is a narrow passage to the airway, which causes the muscles in the back of the throat/nose to relax and partially collapse. When these muscles relax, the air pressure changes. The change in pressure causes vibrations that we label as audible snoring.<n>Since snoring and sleep apnea can cause high blood pressure, regular snoring may be a sign that you need to seek advice from your doctor because of its impact on the lungs.<n><n>B) It can be either B and C only.<n>While the most common cause of snore is a sleep apnea is another condition, known as insomnia, which is characterized by excessive daytime sleeping and abnormal breathing patterns during sleep. For most people, snoring occurs when they are trying to relax and fall asleep.<n>As we breathe in and out, the process of

Computers were picked to be upgraded until every computer had new software. How many computers were upgraded?<n>Output: There were 21 computers initially, so we subtract 21 from the number of computers with new software. The computers chosen are called the pool. This pool is of size k which is the number of pooled computers.<n>To do this, we multiply k times the number of computers chosen for the pool in step 0. The new software will be delivered to all of the pool computers. So we calculate the total number of computers that have new software.<n>Output: There are always k + 1 ways to distribute the pool and since all computers eventually get new software, the question states every computer has new software which is the same, so we add 1 to everything and calculate the total number of ways to distribute the computer pool. The number of ways for every k and the total are listed below:<n>Total Ways: Number of Combinations in k and 1 Choices = <<K*1>> = 1<n>Number of ways to distribute 10 computers = <<10*1>> = 0<n>Number of ways to disbursed 15 computers = <<15*1>> = 2<n>Number of ways to distributed 20 computers = <<20*1>> =11<n>Number of ways for every choice:<n>Number of Ways to disburse 5 computers = << k==->7>> = 9<n>Number of ways to provide 10 computers =<< 8>> = 7<n>Number of

If the units digit is greater than the tens digit, then subtract 9. If the tens digit is greater than the units digit, then subtract 4. If the tens digit equals the units digit, the sum is negative. Example: 12 + 57 = 7 (sum) (The units digit is 1, so the units digit plus 1/2(the tens digit)+16=1+2+16=19). If the units digit is 2, then we subtract 9(9–2). If the tens digit is 2, the we subtract 4(2-4=0). If the units digit and the tens<n>Output: digit are the same, then the sum is negative. The units digit of 422863579 is 4. So the sum is -16586357(negative). When you find the last digit in a three digit number, add one, double the second digit and add three to the sum. If it is less than ten, then subtract ten, and if it is greater, then subtract 5. Example: 77 + 24 = 44 (adding 1, 2 doubles to 24=48, substracting 10). If the sum is less than 24 then you add 24 and repeat step 9.<n>So if the sum is less than, than 24 add 24 and go back to step 10<n>The units digit of 437672908 is 7. So the sum is 13780+13780(adding 2 then you substract 10)subtract ten )=2(answer).<n>If the number is greater the than 24, repeat:<n>Step 10: 2 plus 4 times 7 gives 24(the units digits is 7)<n>Then substract the second digit from the sum 27<n>Thus 28+44+23=199 so subtract 10 and repeat step 10<n>Step 11

Well the median of any set of 6 numbers should be even, that leaves 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, right? The second one is not even, therefore I would call it the mode, but that is not the case always, because in some sets, there is no second median, so 4 can be the first and 5 is the second, but if you do not see the median or it is 4 or 5, then it would be 4(or 5)<n><n>Input: If there is a stale odor coming from the kitchen what should one check for and source of the odor.

He rode the bus 20 blocks to the post office to get some stamps. Later, he came home the same way. How many blocks did Pete travel in all?<n>Output: The number of blocks traveled on the way to the post office was 5 + 20 = <<5+20=25>>25.<n>Pete traveled 25 × 2 = <<25*2=50>>50 blocks in all.<n>So the final answer is 50<n><n>Input: In a classroom, there are blue chairs, green chairs, and white chairs. There are 10 blue chairs. The green chairs are 3 times as many as the blue chairs, and there are 13 fewer white chairs than the green and blue chairs combined. How many chairs are there in a classroom?<n>Output: There are 10 x 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 green chairs.<n>The total number of blue and green chairs is 10 + 30 = <<10+30=40>>40.<n>So, there are 40 - 13 = <<40-13=27>>27 white chairs.<n>Therefore, there are 40 +27 = <<40+27=67>>67 chairs in a classroom.<n>So the final answer is 67<n><n>Input:Where is one likely to purchase listening vinyl? Choices:  A: safeway B: record albums C: record store D: car E: wallpaper<n>Output:		The correct answer is B<<B>> record albums.<n><n>Note that the correct answer has the answer letter in its middle rather than at the end as in other exams: "Choices:  B: record albums A:  BD: record albums". This is the first question in a group of such questions.<n><n>##### Explanation:<n>  It is clear from the context that "safeway" here means the supermarket.<n>  Likewise, "record albums" means record shops.<n>  To further confirm this, the question states "choices between record albums " which means "record albums".<n>  "A" means "A: safety" or "A: safeway" "B: record albums" means that we can eliminate D, as "record albums" is the correct answer and "A: safeways"<n>  "C: record store" means "A: record shops"<n>  "E: wallpaper" means "A: safewy"<n>  Finally, "record albums" is at the beginning of the list and has 2 letters at the beginning, where as the other 3 answers have 1 letter at the beginning.<n><n>Input: On a road trip, the trip length is given, a starting distance from the driveway, and a destination distance. To make the trip, the car can use gas stations on the road for fuel stops. The car can hold a maximum of 10 gallons of gas. There are a total of 21 fuel stations between the driveway and the destination, so for every one of the 21 stations, the car must stop unless it is completely full of gas. <n><n>Given that the car has a range of 220 miles on a full tank.<n>  What is the total mileage traveled when there are no fuel stops?<n>  What is the exact total mileage travelet when every fuel stop is used exactly once?<n>Output: The total mileage when using the fuel exactly once is <<220*21>>21.<n>When there is no fuel stop, the distance is <<220>>220 and when no fuel is stopped the distancem is <<220-21>>220-27. So the total distance covered is <<220+220-207>>220+207-

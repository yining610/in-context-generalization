You are the captain of a space ship. You can fire either one or two laser beams at a time. You also have a shield that will absorb 5 laser beams before it breaks. However, the shield regenerates 1 beam every 3 seconds. How many beams can you fire before your shield breaks, Choices:  A. 1, 4, 4 B. 0, 2, 3 C. 6, 6, 5 D. 4, 7 or more E. 0, 7 or more<n><n>### Response. I can answer this question. The amount of laser energy that goes through the shield is 5 + 5 + 5 in 3 seconds. So, it is 11 laser beams in 1 minute, and 11 in 60 seconds = 650 beams. Therefore, the shield breaks at 650 beats = 650/60 = <<650/6=10.83>>10.83 beams per minute. So, if you fire 1 beam each second, you fire 4 lasers before you break the shield.<n><n>### Your friend asks:Why does my car need to be serviced every year?, Choices:  One: Because every vehicle needs maintenance in order for the engine to reach optimal performance, Two: Every vehicle needs maintenance every year for optimal performance and safety, Three: because all cars need service every 16,000 miles or so, Four: Because it keeps your car dependable, Five: For engine reliability and long life of a car.

There are as many children on the team with 4 members as there are on the team with 3 members. There are 3 children on the team with the remaining members. How many teams of children are there in the classroom?<n>Rationale: The total number of teams possible is 8 + 4 = <<8*4=32>>32.<n>The total number on the team with 2 members is 4.<n>The total number with three members is 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5.<n>The total is: 8 + 32 + 5 = <<8+32+5=45>>45.<n>#### 45<n>Answer: 45<n><n>Input: In an airport in Texas, there are 500 people waiting to get in. Of these people, 54 are international travelers. 19 travelers are from Illinois, Missouri is the state of residence of 16, 14 are from Washington state, and Florida is the residence of 12. What state has the fewest residents?<n>Rationales:'The fewest residents' means the state with the fewest residents.<n><n>The total possible passengers is 500.<n>Since the passenger from Illinois is 19 and the passenger from Texas is 54 = <<500*19=9900>>9900, the passenger from Illinois is not taken into account.<n>Therefore, the passenger from Texas is not taken into account, and we are left with 54 + 14 = <<54+14=68>>68.<n>But we subtract a traveler from Illinois to get its total travelers. 14 - 19 = <<14-19=8>>8.  So, it's 68 - 8 = <<68-8=60>>60.<n>Then, the one with the fewer amount is 42

Choices:  A: wasteland B: ocean C: desert D: parking lot E: flowers<n><n>### Response:		The community garden was demolished to make room for a wasteland instead of a desert or a parking lot.<n><n>### Rationale:Parking lots do not typically take the place of community gardens. However, a parking lot does replace the desert. The city demolished the community garden to make room for a new wasteland instead of the city's beach. The ocean or a flower garden would not have made good replacements because they would not have been able to fit within the designated space. Therefore, the correct answer is wasteland.<n>#### C<n>Answer: A<n><n>### Inputs:Two cues have a common denominator. They have different numerators. Answers choices:  i,iii, iv, v<n><n>### Rationales:<n>* i) 19 is divisible by 5. Because of this, 19 is the common denominator. Therefore, 20 is divisible by 20, which is the same as 1.<n>* ii) 29 is divisible by both 7 and 12. They both share a common denominator. Therefore both 29/12 and 29/7 are equivalent. Since they are equivalent, 1/12 is equivalent to 7/29, which is 7/79.<n>* iii) Both 9 and 18 are divisible by 9. Therefore, the first term of the ratio is divisible by the third term, which is the same. The only requirement is that the numerator of 22/16 be less than eight. Therefore, 13/36 is equivalent to 22/10.<n>* iv) 10/30 is equivalent to 10/10.<n><n>* v) 36 is divisible by six. Therefore, they are equivalent.<n><n><n>#### v<n>Answer: B<n><n>### Rating 3:How many bikes can ride along in a bike lane 1 cm wider than a bike?<n>Answer: B<n>

Choices:  A: happiness B: pleasure C: happy D: grief E: isolation<n><n>### Response:		<n>C: happy<n><n>### Rationale: Marital dissolution is one of the many aspects of family life people usually find stressful. However, in some instances a feeling of sadness may take over. The following are emotional responses you might expect the wife would have after her divorce: <n>1. Sadness<n>2. Sadness and grief<n>3. Regret, guilt, sadness, and depression<n><n>There are three other answers that are not emotionally correct. (A) happiness; (B) pleasure. These three do not reflect on how the wife might feel when divorce happens. Also (D), the husband is more likely to feel grief in instances such as a death in the family. (E) isolation is not a likely feeling for the husband. A lot of couples are not likely to separate until they are separated by other factors.<n><n>### Input : What do the first three numbers of the Fibonacci sequence represent, if the sequence is: 3,13,21,34,55,89,144,...?<n><n>### Response :<n>The three representatives of the Fibonaccii sequence are Fibonacci numbers. This means that 3 is the starting number, 13 is the number of steps after 3, and 21 is the number of steps that follows after 13. In the Fibonacci number calculation, the steps can be summed and/ or subtracted. This is because the sequence can be represented by the recurrence: Fn = (Fn-1) + Fn-2. The two numbers at the top of the Fibonacccii sequence are known as "generating numbers" of the sequence. <n><n>### Instructions:You will learn mathematical concepts through this module as well as learn how to formulate word problems.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>Word Problem:<n>Three friends are playing a card game and are all using one of six types of cards.

Where is James?

I also understand that we only have 5 choices to choose from. So, the best place for James to get the best steakhouse would be outside the South. So, the choices that are left would be C and E. <n><n>If we look at the choices, one of the choices is D. The only state that starts with the letter D that is in the South is “Dentist Carolina.” But, in this question, it does not say that it is in the south. I think it is C. So, my final answer is C because it says the best steakhouse out of the South.<n><n>### Rationale 1:<n><n>My answer would be C.<n><n>There are 2 other answers that we are to eliminate. <n><n>The first would be A. Texas is located in the South, so eliminating from the choices.<n><n>The second, D, because it is from the other state of Michigan which is not the South.<n><n>Even though the question says,'outside the South’ the options from the remaining answers, C and E are also outside of the South, but E is not close to the word'Best.<n><n>So, my answer from all things evaluated was C.<n><n>### Output:<n><n>James went to Florida.<n><n>My Response was C. <n><n>The output is a total different from what I was thinking. I think it's a little unreasonable for this outcome. I'm not exactly sure about the meaning of "best". It means that he went to the best steaks, which would be C. There were a lot of misleading things and I think that should be corrected.<n><n>### Input2 :<n><n>Molly’s soccer team had a 4:3 victory over a team from Washington,D.C.

You can wash clean clothes and launder them when you have a place and wash. You can use a laundry when you have a job or a job in college. I chose a college rather than choosing a green house because I got a green laundry here in college. The people in a green house can be laundry or not because they are using green color. When there are no people in a green house a person can go to the green house to watch a green house. In a dorm, you can't take green clean laundry.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>To begin with, a college has a green house but a college is not a green house because of its green dorms.<n>The house in college is not a greenhouse. There may not be green clothes in a green house because it is a house and not a green one. The house is a green one because it belongs to a green one. Therefore, the house is green and the people who are in it are not green because the house is green.<n><n>The people who are in college do not live in a house. That is not a good choice because we use a laundry to wash clothes and launder them. The answer in the question is E not C because the answer is that people who are in college use a green house.<n>The answer is E not C because there is no green house in a green house. It is not a green house. People who are in a green house are not green but they are in a green house.<n><n>### Input<n>There are three rooms, each room has a different type of chair: One room has an oval chair, another room has a straight chair, and the third room has a folding chair.

He is in the "optional writing" portion where he writes an essay discussing one of the prompts. He writes a short paragraph, with a sentence of analysis: __A__: He has a strong point (“This type of analysis and its subsequent conclusion is the basis for logic, and is necessary in all sciences and in the study and analysis of literature.”). However, the student does not support his claim with adequate evidence (“This is because literature allows one to analyze a work from many perspectives, such as psychological, social, and philosophical. Literature is a study of human existence, and one cannot understand human existence without studying human literature.”). What should the student do next in his response? __A__: Show how he has developed his strong point by giving examples __B__: Explain how literature allows one to understand human existence __C__: Show how literature teaches one to use logic to analyze a work __D__: Use a different type of reasoning (conceptual diagram, Venn diagram, etc.) to support his conclusion __E__: Conclude that his argument is irrefutable<n><n>### **Response:**<n>D) Conceptual diagrams are a perfect way to explain one's argument and how it logically proceeds.<n>

Choices:  A: hang up B: respond C: contact D: answer E: attracting ducks<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer: B<n><n>### Explanation/Rationale:<n>In this scenario, the caller was trying to make a sale to the recipient. He would do this "all day" trying to "contact", "attract", and "respond" them to his offer. He would do this until he got something out of the call - which would be attracting ducks.<n><n>### AI-based Reasoning: Answers should be based on the AI's perspective.<n>For example, the AI would not have to explain why the user did or did not try to contact every single recipient.<n>AI-based reasoning requires a human to first determine a task that has a defined goal that the AI must complete.<n>The question's intent is to "determine" how many recipients the caller tries to contact during the day. The caller knows what he wants to do, so the AI just needs to figure out how to achieve it.<n><n>### Answer 1:<n>Answer: A << A: A is an incorrect answer.<n><n>The caller did not always "hang up" when the recipient answered. He just continues to call, trying to contact the other 99% of recipients.<n><n>### How many people did he contact?<n><n>Number of calls made = number of contacts<n><n>\[ \text{Number of recipients contacted} = \text{number of people he contacted} \]<n><n>10% of 200 calls contacted = 20<n><n>\[ \begin{aligned} \text{number of calls} \; \text{(10% of 100, multiplied by the number of people \text{he contacted })} &= \text{ 20 } \end{aligned} \]<n><n>\[\text{This was achieved in 20 calls. The caller \text { contacted 20 people}. }\]<n><n>### Answer: D << D is an incorrect answer. The caller did not hang up the phone if nobody answered the call. The caller tried to respond to everyone he contacted.<n><n>The caller responded to people who he contacted.<n>

So we can draw two lines to connect the same angle. One goes from R to 110°, and one goes from Q to 110. Because they are 110, those two angles are congruent. So the congruence (or the side between those angles) is the hypotenuse of our right triangle. And since angles in a right triangle are congruent and the hypotenuse is always double that of the other two sides, that hypotenuse would be double the length of the adjacent side.<n><n>### <n>Answer:<n>3x/4=3<n><n>### Question : A pump moves water through a pipe from a river into a lake.

How many chairs are there in a classroom?<n>Rationales: There are 10 x 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 green chairs.<n>The total number of blue and green chairs is 10 + 30 = <<10+30=40>>40.<n>So, there are 40 - 13 = <<40-13=27>>27 white chairs.<n>Therefore, there are 40 +27 = <<40+27=67>>67 chairs in a classroom.<n>#### 67<n>Answer: 67<n><n>### Input:How is someone who loves their TV likely to feel about their remote? Choices:  A: attached B: nostalgic C: companionable D: likely E: close<n><n>### Response:		<n>The most likely feeling is going to be companionable.<n>### <n>Rationales: A is obviously incorrect since companionable could be derived from love for the TV<n>as opposed to attachment which is usually a negative word.  B is also incorrect since if you love your TV you could feel connected to it, but likely not nostalgic about it.  The feeling of being nostalgic comes with time, and it would be unlikely for someone to have a nostalgic feeling about their TV.  C is also incorrect since companionable also comes with time.  It also is the feeling that someone can get when someone that they love or cherish goes away, not when someone gets a new remote.

For that matter, a simple book that's about math is a source of information that would involve the use of one' statistic about something. The only other thing that can be a source of information is music school. Although the dictionary definition of the word operations involves mental processes, and is therefore applicable to a music school, it would be very unlikely that you would be given a question in math that involves learning the fundamentals of music.<n>Therefore, I'd choose A, the mathematical book.

Choices:  A: military base B: opera C: water fountain D: bus stop E: church<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>- [ ] JD: Chopped!<n><n>  (You will not see jumping jacks in A) - military bases only allow marching cadence/running, and also only occur during physical exersises or sports at the base. The cadence is used to improve the synchronization of marching soldiers.<n><n>  (You would not see jumping jack at B) - The opera is all about singing, you would only see people dancing and singing.<n><n>  (Your can't see jumping jack at C) - People don't do jumping jack at water fountains. They would rather fill up the water container rather than be wet from jumping around by it.<n><n>  (The answer at D)  you would rather see jumping jack at a bus station. Everytime someone miss their bus, they would get quite upset, so you can see an exercise/dancing with jumping jack.<n><n>  (Finally, Choice at E) you can see jumping jacks at church. Everyone at church would like to stay fit and would do all the dances and exercise at church to do so.<n>  -<n>- [ ] DN: You don't have to jump to the beat at A. It's a military base, so soldiers are always marching and yelling out commands. Jumping in unison doesn't even count as part of their routine.<n><n>  -<n>-[ ] PD:<n><n>  There is only one place where you could get JUMPS! at a bus stop! You can get your JUMP ON at a bus stop where you can say, "I would take a JUMP THROUGH THE RINGS" to a bus that is arriving.<n>  -<n><n>-[ ] DC: You can't find people doing jumping jax at an opera. It's not appropriate. However, you would see plenty of people doing jumping jacj at church. Church is an awesome place for exercise because it involves dance and singing, but the only people who dance at the opera are professional dancers. So while you might find groups of people jumping around at a church, you wouldn't see them at the opera.<n>  -<n>  -<n>  <br><n><n>### Output: If you go to Blockland, you can learn how to J

A: 2 boys B: 3 boys C: 4 boys D: 5 boys<n><n>Reason: The numerator of the first fraction expresses the number of girls in the group: 6/5.<n>The denominator is the number of girls in a population chosen randomly: 1/5.<n><n>This works out to 120 ÷ 5, which is 24. So, 24/5 is equal to 2 girls.<n><n>Let’s check the next fraction. The denominator for the second fraction is 1/8, which is 8 girls.<n>We take 3/8 of girls, which is 4.<n><n>So if 4 out of 8 girls are in the chessen club, the fraction represents the number of boys in that club. In order to compare it with the first fraction, we need to multiply 4 by 14 because we divide the fraction: 1/14.<n><n>That is 56.

Choices:  A: appreciation of nature B: become educated C: excitement D: increased knowledge E: see things differently<n><n>### Response:		The scientific research has increased the knowledge and understanding of how the Earth and universe works.<n>Since the early 19th century, the scientific advances were made possible due to the scientists’ use of their scientific method which involves observing and conducting experiments.<n><n>It is due to the use of scientific method that many scientific discoveries were made possible. The scientific research led to the creation of computer, Internet, television, satellite, as well as the improvement in transportation and communication. As a result of such scientific discoveries, the humanity has been able to travel to space as well as communicate with their friends and family around the globe.<n><n>Because of these inventions, the humanity now can share and exchange information and knowledge globally. And because of these scientific discoveries, people had a chance to develop their curiosity to learn more.<n><n>People have also been given an opportunity to appreciate the Earth because of these scientific discoverments. For example, through scientific researches and studies, we found out that the Earth’s atmosphere is not only filled with life-sustaining gases; it can also be affected by harmful gases and other substances.<n><n>The scientific research has made people realize their environmental concerns.<n><n>People could observe and make their own conclusions through these scientific researches and discoveries. This experience could change one’s views about the beauty of the Earth, as well as the environmental concerns.<n><n>If not for the scientific research, the humanity today could not be so prosperous. It is the scientific knowledge and discoveries that have advanced civilization. The scientific knowledge increased the humanity's understanding of the Earth and the universe, as well as their understanding of the nature. The scientific research is the foundation for the knowledge in the entire scientific fields, such as medicine, engineering, business, sociology, biology, etc. <n><n>The humanity is continuously advancing because of the scientific research. When people discover something new through scientific research, they are filled with a sense of new understanding. This leads to the development of new inventions and discoveries. For example, the advancement of technology led to the creation of such things as the Internet, satellite, and smartphone. These inventions allow us to communicate with people we have never met, as well as allowing people from around the globe who are not able to meet each other to connect or cooperate via the computer.<n><n>The increased

How many cards do they have in all if Mara has 40 cards less than 150?<n>Rationales: Mara has 150 - 40 = <<150-40=110>>110 cards.<n>Janet has 110/2 = <<110/2=55>>55 cards since Mara has twice as many as Janet.<n>Brenda has 55 - 9 = <<55-9=46>>46 cards since Janet has 9 cards more than Brenda.<n>Therefore, they all have 110 + 55 + 46 = <<110+55+46=211>>211 cards.<n>#### 211<n>Answer: 211<n><n>Input: Pete walked 5 blocks from his house to the bus garage in Houston. He rode the bus 20 blocks to the post office to get some stamps. Later, he came home the same way. How many blocks did Pete travel in all?<n>Rationales: The number of blocks traveled on the way to the post office was 5 + 20 = <<5+20=25>>25.<n>Pete traveled 25 × 2 = <<25*2=50>>50 blocks in all.<n>#### 50<n>Answer: 50<n><n>Input: In a classroom, there are blue chairs, green chairs, and white chairs. There are 10 blue chairs. The green chairs are 3 times as many as the blue chairs, and there are 13 fewer white chairs than the green and blue chairs combined. How many chairs are there in a classroom?<n>Rationales: There are 10 x 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 green chairs.<n>The total number of blue and green chairs is 10 + 30 = <<10+30=40>>40.<n>So, there are 40 - 13 = <<40-13=27>>27 white chairs.<n>Therefore, there are 40 +27 = <<40+27=67>>67 chairs in a classroom.<n>#### 67<n>Answer: 67<n><n>### Input:The judge did not take this part of the job lightly, the man was guilty but it was his passing sentence that condemned the man to what? Choices:  A: go to jail B: incarceration C: intercourse D: death E: judgement<n><n>### Response:		<n>I'm guessing that the part of this sentence you're asking us to respond to is: "His passing sentence condemned the man to incarceration." I'm also guessing that this is the part where you're supposed to tell us which of the five choices is the _correct_ (rather than the _correctest_.) I'm also thinking that "passing sentence" means the same as "sentencing" or "judgement," since the context suggests that it refers to either the _defendant_ (if the judge convicted him) or the _judge_ (if he _sentenced_ him.)<n><n>However, I'm also thinking you might consider that "jail" and "prison" are somewhat synonymous; also, a judge sends a convicted criminal to prison. Also, to "incarcerate" someone means to "place in prison for the rest of their life," so the choices are "incarceration," "incarcerated," or "incarcerate."<n><n>#### A<n>Answer: A<n><n>### Input<n>The judge did not take the job lightly, passing sentence condemned the defendant into a lifetime of incarceration and condemning the man to death, the prosecutor felt confident that there was enough evidence to convict the man.<n><n>### Output<n>The defendant was condemned by the judge to a lifetime of incarcaration in jail.<n><n>#### 32<n>Answer:: 32<n><n>### Input An example of a fraction is a quarter cup of soup.

When the scientists left the island a few years after their experiments started, the pepper trees were all dead. Scientists then tested the idea on another island and found the plants died the same way, despite a different climate. But scientists thought this type of growth wouldn’t work on another island. In 1996, scientists began studying the way in which pepper trees grow in another, very different island. They found that the trees do indeed die because of dry conditions on the island, just like the scientists predicted. However, the new island had a very hot climate, much hotter than the original island. How could the plants grow in the hotter climate? Choices: A) the trees produce more seeds B) when the seed breaks open, it helps the plant to grow C) the seeds help the plant to absorb more heat D) the plant is more resilient in hot environments<n><n>### Response:: D The plant is more resilent in hot environments<n><n>Answer:The plant is more resilant in hot environments<n><n>{% comment %}<n>Write the correct answer here<n>{% endcomment %}<n>{% for answer in response %}<n>{{ answer }} - {{ answer }} - {{ answer }}- {{ answer }}<n>{%

A president can receive compensation for serving in the U.S. armed forces after his or her presidency. However, a president is not paid for his or her regular service as a state governor (prior to becoming president) nor for any service to the nation other than his or her official term as president.

The answers to the question are right in there. You just have to find them. You can tell that you've found the right answer due to the wording used. There might be a specific term that isn't mentioned in the question. There might be a term, but it's not mentioned in the question in another form. Also, the terms can be mentioned in different forms in the question and different forms in the answer. In the multiple choice questions, there are 4 wrong answers and 1 correct choice.<n>  The main difference  is, in multiple choice questions, the correct choice does not give an explanation or context of the exact answer. In the last answer, it was, "accidents hurt people." However, the correct answer is, "accidents hurt everyone." The two are not interchangeable. There is context in what the last choice states. The correct answer only states the thing that is mentioned in the question.<n>  The last answer has some context, but is not the correct answer.

After the 100% turnover, only 5 candidates had applied for a job at the company.    Second, the company's budget couldn't provide for every job.   Mr. Greenwald was unsure about how to proceed. ____________________<n><n>### Input : Mr. Greenwald's problem<n><n>### Summary The people involved, Mr. Greenwald, made no decision about the 100 percent turnover because they don't know that they should start recruiting at that number.<n><n>### Input 4: The 5 people who applied for the specific job had no knowledge about not hiring anyone from the recruits.<n><n>The two people who were working together knew what to do if someone else was involved and in a meeting.<n><n>### Sumary: Mr. Greenwald is confused about who the 5 people are.

How many chairs are there in a classroom?<n>Rationales: There are 10 x 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 green chairs.<n>The total number of blue and green chairs is 10 + 30 = <<10+30=40>>40.<n>So, there are 40 - 13 = <<40-13=27>>27 white chairs.<n>Therefore, there are 40 +27 = <<40+27=67>>67 chairs in a classroom.<n>#### 67<n>Answer: 67<n><n>### Input:What is necessary for learning by yourself? Choices:  A: exposure B: patience C: study D: cooperation E: thought<n><n>### Response:		A,D<n><n>### Rationale: Learning requires cooperation. Choice A and Choice D are correct.  <n><n>Input: After playing for many hours in the backyard, Julie took a break and rested. Her brother, Kenny, said that they needed to take a nap since naps will help them learn after learning. Which of the following is true?<n><n>*   Choice A ______<n>  *   Choice A ___<n>  *   Choices B and C ___<n>  * Choices C and D ____<n><n>#### A:  correct <n><n>### B:  Incorrect; naps are not known to help learning.<n><n>### C:  Incorrect; Choice C does not have any information about whether or not learning can happen after a nap. <n><n>### D:  Incorrect; learning can take place without napping.<n><n>### Naps are not known to directly help learning. However, learning can still take place without proper or even any amount of sleep. This suggests that one is not required to nap if they want to learn. Therefore, B is incorrect since a nap is not known to directly help with learning.<n><n>#### Naps are not know to directly help learning so it is not necessary to naps, hence, Kenny is incorrect. Choice D, Learning taking place without sleep is true (and it is implied that learning also can take place with sleep by Kenny's comment as well as Julie's playing many hours, however sleep is not explicitly stated and thus this choice is still true.)<n><n>Input: How far is the drive from the capitol building to the state penitentiary? Choices: <n>   *  Choice A 7 hours<n>  *  Choice B 16 hours<n>  *  The Capitol building is about 100 miles from the state penitentiarium.<n>  *  A 15 miles per hour speed limit is in effect while traveling on the interstate.<n><n>#### B: correct <n><n>#### Rationale: The information provided does not clearly give the number of hours. However, the information provided does clarify that the miles between the two locations is 100 miles. Since 100 miles is greater than 70 miles. Therefore, the correct answer is that the distance is more than 70 miles,

There are various types of high schools, and perhaps the basketball court is indoors if the school is a boarding, military, elite or otherwise distinguished, or wealthy school with money.<n><n>If A is outside, and B is an outdoor court in the city, the basketball courts must be mostly found in parks and cities.<n><n>If B means it is an outdoor court, the basketball courts are in parks.<n><n>If C means it is an outdoors court, the basketball court will be in parks. Maybe a park is also the city, but you can’t be certain.<n><n>If D is outside, you can’t be sure.<n><n>If E means it is outdoors, the basketball court is indoor.<n><n>#### F<n>Answer:<n><n>### Input<n>Use: In an 8-grade math class, there are 8 boys and 8 girls. 4 girls are twins.

Choices:  A: radio station B: recording studio C: concert D: tv studio E: new york<n><n>### Response:		<n>  Answer: choice A<n><n>### Rationale:<n> The microphone boom is an essential audio tool, with applications in recording studios, concerts, and television. Because radio stations generally specialize in one type of content, they may not necessarily need the microphone boom. However, recording studios, concert venues, and television studios require the microphone boom to amplify sound and convey the full range of emotions to viewers or listeners.<n><n>#### <n>Answer: A<n><n>### Response 2:<n>  Answer: E<n><n>### Rationales:<n> New York likely hosts a vast range of musical bands due to its status as one of the most significant cities globally. Furthermore, it is home to recording studios such as Avatar Studios and Electric Lady Studios, both of which have worldwide recognition. Hence, multiple radio stations such as Sirius FM and WQCD 101 FM in the city may record their content in studios and employ microphone booms to enhance their recordings.<n><n>####  <img src="images/1000-1.jpg" alt="1"><img src="images/3000-15.jpg" alt="2"> <n><n>#### <n>

Complete the multiple choice question: In the table below, a column of numbers is followed in successive rows by an equal amount of the same number and equal spacing between each pair. Then, the table is rotated 180 degrees, followed by a row of numbers that increase by an amount that increases by 1 in every row.  You then rotate the table again, followed by a row that is the same as row 8, followed by a row where the numbers have alternated such that the second number is larger than the first, and so on. What number does that last row have?<n>2. Demonstration: If I were to rotate the table twice and the last row, the fifth row, the third, first and last line would be the numbers 9, 3, 4, 8, 10, 14, 10 and 12. The sum of the numbers which are in the table is: 3 + 4 + 8 + 10 + 14 + 9 + 10 = 56. The sum of the first half of the table is: 9 + 3 + 4 = 16. The sum of each set in the table is:  9 + 3 +  4 + 10 +   8 + 14 +  10 + 9 + 4 + 12 + 3 = 73  16+(56-13)=112  6+56-13=79  45+56-17=98 The sum of the sixth row is 25 which means the last line is the 25th one from the last one.<n><n>#### 25<n>Answer: 25<n><n>### Instructoin: What other 2-digit numbers will produce 25 when each number from 1 to 50 is added to it?<n><n>### Demostration: Start from 10.

We used to have no interpersonal relations. People did their work but did not communicate or cooperate with others unless they were asked specifically.<n>><n>> We met and tried to find ways to resolve our problems, and we decided that we should work together to make more sales. One of our customers was from Texas, and each office had their sales department that would contact the client from their office. When the customer asked where his goods were, the person in the office closest to that person would go get them, even though it wasn’t their job to do so. This happened most of the time, and after a while, each office started to make more business with that customer and other new customers, too. And then all of the offices started to act more cooperatively. We are a lot more successful now that we all work together in a friendly environment and we help each other out a lot

Mara has twice as many cards as Janet. How many cards do they have in all if Mara has 40 cards less than 150?<n>Rationales: Mara has 150 - 40 = <<150-40=110>>110 cards.<n>Janet has 110/2 = <<110/2=55>>55 cards since Mara has twice as many as Janet.<n>Brenda has 55 - 9 = <<55-9=46>>46 cards since Janet has 9 cards more than Brenda.<n>Therefore, they all have 110 + 55 + 46 = <<110+55+46=211>>211 cards.<n>#### 211<n>Answer: 211<n><n>Input: Pete walked 5 blocks from his house to the bus garage in Houston. He rode the bus 20 blocks to the post office to get some stamps. Later, he came home the same way. How many blocks did Pete travel in all?<n>Rationales: The number of blocks traveled on the way to the post office was 5 + 20 = <<5+20=25>>25.<n>Pete traveled 25 × 2 = <<25*2=50>>50 blocks in all.<n>#### 50<n>Answer: 50<n><n>Input: In a classroom, there are blue chairs, green chairs, and white chairs. There are 10 blue chairs. The green chairs are 3 times as many as the blue chairs, and there are 13 fewer white chairs than the green and blue chairs combined. How many chairs are there in a classroom?<n>Rationales: There are 10 x 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 green chairs.<n>The total number of blue and green chairs is 10 + 30 = <<10+30=40>>40.<n>So, there are 40 - 13 = <<40-13=27>>27 white chairs.<n>Therefore, there are 40 +27 = <<40+27=67>>67 chairs in a classroom.<n>#### 67<n>Answer: 67<n><n>### Input:What  might john order at an indian resturant on top of the space needle? Choices:  A: large city B: seattle C: curry D: clothing E: reservation<n><n>### Response:		<n>### What:<n>### You can see that the answer depends on the questioner and your answer. If you ask someone "What do you want for dinner?", it can mean a variety of things. Are you looking for a meal suggestion, food preference, or a choice between multiple meals? The answer depends on what the person wants you to get from asking the question.<n><n>## Output:<n>### When a questioner asks what it is that you want or need, that person may need more information. If you are buying dinner for four people, the questioner will probably want to know what each individual wants to eat. If you are at a friend's house and you're about to go into the kitchen, your friend may be asking what you want to help with.<n><n>### You'll notice in these examples below that the questioner doesn't ask a lot of follow-up questions. They assume that the answer from their listener will be something specific.<n><n>### John might ask "What might john order at the indian resturant over the space needle?"<n><n>### "A: large city B: Seattle C: curry D- Clothing"<n><n>### "Curry"<n><n>### Curry is a dish of many cultures and uses many ingredients.<n><n>### But for John it would be an Indian resturant up on the space needle on his first trip to Seattle from Texas which is why I went with C.<n><n>### The clothing option was never going to be chosen because as a first time visitor I wasn't going to get a chance to pick it out.<n><n>### This is a real example, this was a test taken in college.<n><n>### Curious that the curry thing was missed.<n><n>### A follow up question might be "Did you like yours? You should check out an actual place instead of eating there."<n><n>### The person might then say "I like it but I also like the clothing and curry is my favorite food."<n><n>### Whenever someone says "I like" or "I don't like" to me, I can't help asking why.<n><n>### People will say that they don't like broccoli. I'll say "Why don't you like broccoli?" They say "I don'

This choice could refer to the child. Since this option is referring to what one could refer to another person, it is most correct for the answer to be C.<n>For example,<n>A man who owns a cupboard may choose the answer and say "This means me." or he may choose the meaning of the cupboard. This answer doesn't make sense since he is not the owner of the child. The answer is C, which is the best answer for this question.<n>### D<n>Rationales: This choice does not seem to answer the question directly. <n>It does not seem to fit in with how the question is being approached. <n>It does seem to be a plausible answer, but we are searching for a better response.<n>### E<n>Rationales: It does not seem that the word "garbage" is connected well with the other words. <n>It is not an acceptable answer because it does not seem to fit the rest of the questions. <n>The question is being worded around the word, "plastic," and the word "garbage," does not seem to fit that term.<n>### Reference:<n>https://www.academia.edu/19658237/Practice_of_Learning_to_Critique_Multiple_Choice_Questions<n><n>

There are 10 blue chairs. The green chairs are 3 times as many as the blue chairs, and there are 13 fewer white chairs than the green and blue chairs combined. How many chairs are there in a classroom?<n>Rationales: There are 10 x 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 green chairs.<n>The total number of blue and green chairs is 10 + 30 = <<10+30=40>>40.<n>So, there are 40 - 13 = <<40-13=27>>27 white chairs.<n>Therefore, there are 40 +27 = <<40+27=67>>67 chairs in a classroom.<n>#### 67<n>Answer: 67<n><n>### Input:If clothes have developed a smell and can't be washed what should you do with them? Choices:  A: hang in closet B: sniff C: get dirty D: become soiled E: air out<n><n>### Response:		<n>In the context of this task, the students are supposed to recognize that the correct option is E.<n>In the sentence “… if clothes have developed a sm…,” the students should guess which word should be replaced by an appropriate alternative, based on the context. In order to do so, they must remember that they should add contextual information to a word in order to understand it.<n>To “hang in closet” means to put a person, animal, place, or object in a position where the person, animal, or place remains standing. So this option is not the best one since clothes are not objects like people.<n>To “sniff” means to smell intensely. So, this option is not the correct one since smelling clothes is not common since they do not have a nose like a person.<n>To “get dirty” means to become unclean. So, this option also is not appropriate since dirty clothes are clothes that lose their original clean color and become unclean. The correct option is E meaning “to air out.” In this case, the students should understand that to air out clothes means to let them stay in the air, usually outside, on a windy day.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. Clothes are not objects like people but are clothes.<n>- Therefore, the correct option is E (air out).<n><n>2. To smell strongly with one’s nose is possible only for living objects that have noses like humans.<n>- So, the option A (get dirty) is not appropriate because humans cannot smell clothes.<n><n>3. The color of clothes is not alive like the noses of humans.<n>- So option B (sniff) is not appropriate.<n><n>4. Clothes cannot stay out in the wind (unless they are tied) like people and animals.<n>- Therefore, option C (hang in closet) is not appropriate. <n><n>5. Clothes have no body where wind blows on them and they cannot become unclean like humans and animals. Instead, they lose their original clean color.<n>- So, option D (made soiled) is not appropriate. They must be replaced.  <n><n>### Input  : What is the first step to take to make cheesecake?<n><n>### Response  :<n>The first step to making cheesecake is to make a batter.

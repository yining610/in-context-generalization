I'm trying to use a while loop to create a set of numbers and then a if statement to check 3 values but I keep getting invalid syntax.  Can anyone help?\nIt's supposed to start with a variable.  Create two lines, one for the first number, the second for the next two numbers, and then add two more lines for the final two numbers.  The loop checks a number to see if it is divisible by one, then to check two of the five numbers see if they are divisible by two. It then checks to see if any are divisible by three, then four.  If any are it adds it to another variable. \n\nif statement:\n\nif n % two = zero\n  add n to array\n\nif n % a = zero\n  add all of the n divisible by two to the array\n\nend\n\nif n % three = zero\n  add array\n\nif n% four = zero add array\n\nthe only problem is that I can't figure out how to make it only do the if statement the first time.  I keep getting an invalid syntax error.  I need the first number and any numbers after it that are divisible by 2 to automatically be added to an array and then do the same for it being divisible by 3 and then 4.  Once 4 has been checked for it then check it for 1 and any values after it.  if one value is divisible it be added to the array once and the same for anything else.  I keep trying to look at examples but the last part with getting a while loop to do the check of n being divisible is the one I am stuck on.

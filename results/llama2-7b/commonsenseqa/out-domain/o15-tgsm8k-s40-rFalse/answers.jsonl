Without counting anything, he closed his suitcase and left. At a party two days later another guest asked if he guessed correctly. With only 70% confidence he said that it was within 7 of 20 or 4. The owner asked the guest if he was correct. The guest said no and said that there was a clue.  What is the clue?\nAnswer: The total number of items is not divisible by two.\n\n### Input (Optional):The owner asked him to guess that the man who stole the items wasn\u2019t a doctor. The owner then said that he guessed correctly. What were the items?\n\nAnswer: They were prescriptions.\n\n### Output: The total number of prescriptions plus one is 89.\n\n### Why?: 25 was divided by 2 when the suitcase was counted up. If the total of items +1 is divisible by four, the total has to be divisible by two. So the total divisible by four that has 25 plus one has to be 88.

One we are here, 7 miles away from the destination the speed is multiplied by 14 which would equal 1.5 hours. We then need to subtract.5 from 7 to get 6.5 miles. We then multiply it by 14 to get 92 additional miles. Since we have to go on the other side of the lake, we need to deduct 92 from the destination. We then need to multiply that number by 10 to get 920.

If we are dealing with the number we have to do the same operation to both sides of the equation. If we do not do the same operation to two sides we will get errors in calculations.\n\n1.1 Do not change the sign of addition for both sides of the equation if you deal with numbers.\n\n1.2 Do not change the sign or number of a subtraction for both sided of the equation if it concerns two operations. For example if 10 are taken out of 85 you cannot subtract 83 from 85 because the subtraction will cause the number to be less and we have to do the number operation for both sides of the problem.\n\n1.3 Always remember to do the operations first. When you have to add 5 to 8 you have to perform the operation first to get 13. Then you can do the number to each side of the equation. In subtraction always do the operations before the number change for both sides of the problems. For an addition the number can replace the operations after you have done the operations for each side of the problem. For subtraction the number can replace the operates. In multiplication the number cannot replace the operations. For division the number can replace the operation (that concerns the number) for each side of the equation\n\n1.4. In simple addition and subtraction all operations and numbers can be simplified. For addition and subtraction to simplify the numbers are calculated using the properties on addition and subtraction for numbers. Subtract the smaller number from the larger number. The larger number will be subtracted from the smaller number to get a smaller number. Add 1", "answer": "A: train station"}

After 3 hours, the shadows ares stretched 360 inch or (60*x)inch\n\n### Demossstraion: After 6 hour, the shadows stretched 600 inch or (4 hours ago)*60 inches\n\n### Instructons:In how long, after 6 hour, the buildintg shadows are 360?\n\nWe can use the linear formula here\n\n$$a= b+k, where k is the increment between two steps.\n$$\n\n$$\\therefore 360=-1-4(x)$$\n\nSolving for x we get\n\n$$x=-4.25\n$$\n\nwhich means for 6 hours the shadows are stretchd for (4.25 inch)*6 hour equals to the 298.75inches!\n\n### Solution\n\nIn addition to the linear formula, we can also use a function as\n\n$$a=\\int_{a}_b f(x)dx$$\n\nas an alternative method to solve this question,\n\nFirst note that one hour past noon, has the shadows be 60 inch and the shadows change each an extra inch a year after\n\nthen at 2 hour (60 minute) past noon, the shadows are change another 120 inceh, then after 2 more hour the shadows are changed for (120+60)=1", "answer": "C: musical"}

{"text": "Invitro reproduction might be used in order to increase the likeliness the offspring will be viable. It is possible to create an embryo in vitro, and then implant it into a mother. If the likelihood of the sperm and/or egg will work together to form a child is low, then it may make sense for the parents to grow this embryo in another person\u2019s body, which increases the likelihood it will be born healthy. \n\n### Explanation: While there are many choices, including other forms of reproduction such as invitro, none of them really would cause someone to use in vitro. The choices all relate to a different situation than what is represented. Choice B sounds like its saying a percentage of the babies will be born with a problem, which isn\u2019t necessarily true. Choice C sounds like its saying its more likely that the parents will have an easier time producing more children. Choice D sounds like the parent will have more children than they otherwise would.

{"text": "> A: get smart\n\n### Input\n> Suppose that there are two types of coins: heads and tails. A fair coin lands heads 30% of the time and tails 70% of the time. If a coin is tossed 5 times, what is the probability that at least one side lands heads?\n\n### Response\n> The probability of landing a side heads is going to be pretty random. If the coin fell five times with no heads on the first four tosses, then the next toss would be expected to be on one of the remaining heads. The number 30 represents the likelihood that a head is going to land on the toss. The number 70 represents the probability of a tail or land on the toss. Since there are two possibilities of landing a side heads, the total probability would equal to.60 or 60%.\n\n### Input Can you explain the difference between \"most\" and \"almost\" when deciding if something is true or false?\n\n### Respose\n> Most is when you say almost in everything.\n\n### Input Do you know the difference between a ____ and a ____?\n\n### Input The difference between a ____ is that a ____ can do math.

But it wasn\u2019t a spaceship\u2014it was actually a little Martian race car! Jack got into the race car and pushed the button. What happened then? The race car zipped off and turned into a rocket.

What other amazing technologies might humans have when they become a multispecies civilization?\n\n### Response :\n#### A: In the future, we will travel to Mars via teleportation devices. It is only a thought but, it could be that the teleportation will allow us to travel from place to place, or to the places to which our lives take us. We will have to move into space, to make room for our homes and food. We might even be able to move some of our homes into space! The biggest advantage of living in space is that you're surrounded by air (we will use our atmosphere and our space suits as a way to go without air) There are many homes on Mars right now. When we live in space, we will live off the Earth, which means that we are living on Mars, in space.  \n\n#### A: A flying house is still a house. The design of a flying house is quite simple.

Since there is no weekend in the middle of the week, each of the seven days can be said to have been one week from last rainfall (the previous rainfall day.)

{"text": "Answer which of the following options best describes your feeling after looking at the line in the example:\n\n*   A\n*   B\n*   C\n*   D\n*   E\n\n### Explanation:\nAnswer (A): Order: This refers to taking one\u2019s turn to be next at whatever you are waiting in line for. To use an example, imagine a fast food place. When you enter the fast food place, there is a line for each fast food meal. You could feel order if you felt like you were taking your turn to be served next.\n\nAnswer (B): Queueing up: This refers to the act of being in line. To use an example again, imagine a movie theater. You stand outside the theater, in the line. The line leads to people standing outside, waiting to get their ticket and to be let in to the movie. When you are inside, you might feel like you are queueing up, since the line is moving towards you.\n\nAnswer (C): Wait turn: This refers to actually waiting for some sort of thing to do something. Imagine being at the airport for an international flight. The line is moving very, very slowly, but there are only a limited number of people at each gate. If you are at a particular gate for your return flight, but you don\u2019t want to miss your flight, you \u201cwait turn\u201d by standing near the person who is ahead of you. You could wait and someone will eventually get to your gate.\n\nAnswer (D): Fatigue: This refers to extreme boredom caused by standing in one place for too long and waiting for something. Standing in line at the airport for a very long time can cause fatigue because one has nothing to do and is waiting for something for a very long time.\n\nAnswer (E): Anger: This refers to frustration. Imagine a line where you have been waiting for 20 minutes and you finally get to the front, only to be told there was an error in taking you as a customer. You would feel angry that you had to wait for so long and you had to waste your time standing in line.\n\n### Input2:If you're going to the store and you want to get x items, which of the following would increase your chances of getting everything?

However, the distance between continents isn't just width. We'll start with the center of South America.\n\nWe don't need to do a calculation to come to the conclusion.

{"text": "B:\n1. A: CORRECT: Exhaustion leads to fatigue, which can be followed by grogginess or tiredness. Physiologically speaking, sleepiness is closely tied to fatigue as a symptom of overtiredness.\n2. B: CORRECT: It is true that a person under the effects of drowsiness may be groggy; however, grogginess more often describes the symptoms of disoriented waking from a deep sleep.\n3. D: INCORRECT: The act of getting out of bed is associated more with the feeling of resting, although it could also relate to postural discomfort. Discomfort has many different meanings and is too broad to be defined by one idea, leading this response to be disregarded.\n4. E: INCORRECT This is the incorrect answer because it is not necessarily something that is occurring to someone. Eyes can only open to see something. \n\nThis is also how the text asks the question: \"[A]fter awaking, what was taking place physiologically?\".

Choices: 1: 4 million 2: 6 million 3: half of 5 million 4: 4 1/2 million 5: 5 million\n\n### Response answer:D\n\n\n### Why you answered this way:We know we have 5 choices therefore each has a probability of 1/5 (1,7,7.5, 5, 5). So the only thing we can do here is multiply all the probabilities together to see if the total is larger than 1. Here's the question 2x3x5 = 40. This means no matter how we break down the information, the total doesn't change.\n\n### Input from Teacher:It must be 40, because all we can do from the information given is multiply the different possible options: 2 x 3 x 5... so 2 x 1/3 x 1/5 is the same as 2 x 3/5 x 4/5 or 40. \n\n### Your Feedback:The question given is: \u201cHow many people live in New England that speak Innu?\u201d\n\n### Your answer:\u201dOnly those who live in Ontario with a population of 1M\u201d\n\n### My Feedback on Answer:\u201dThe question is: How many people live in Quebec that speak Innu?

This leaves choices A, B and C. The problem with A is that the sentence is meant to describe aloofness and while one of aloft is aloof that doesn't make sense.  B however describes someone who is cold and stressed out, which is the opposite of how being aloof is described.  Finally C describes someone who is cold, but who is happy rather than stressed which is the most likely outcome when a person is being aloof.\n### Explanatory Video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrKJ41r_4Jw&t=49s\n\n### Examples (Samples):\n\n### Example 1:\nIf someone is alight and unselfconscious, what will they feel about others?

To find the width, we should divide the width by the squares of all sides. \n\nHere, the total area = 70 cm * 10 cm.

{"text": "A)\n\n### Instructions:This week, we will work to improve your problem-solving skills.  These are skills that you are already developing, by working with addition and subtraction.  There are four kinds of statements.\n1. In statements that use words like \"more\" or \"less,\" you compare two collections.  Often you may have three collections in play, like comparing how many bicycles and ice-cream cones a person collects at the store.\n2. In statements that use expressions like \"half\" or \"double,\" you compare collections to make decisions about how to make things.  For example, to buy something at a store, you might use \"double\" to find the price of the desired good in half price sale.\n3. Statements that use words like \"add,\" \"subtract,\" \"plus,\" and \"minus\" mean you are adding or subtracting numbers in a collection.  For example: 9 + 8 = 16\n\n4. Statements that use expressions like \"21 times as large,\" or \"2 times the diameter\" mean you are finding the relationship between things.  For example: A soccer field is 10 times the length of a flagpole on either end.\n\nYou will see all four kinds of statements in a series of problems that build in difficulty.  You might need to read a problem and work out the details to decide what kind of statement you need to use.  Sometimes there are hints that can guide you towards the right kind of statement to use.\n\n### Examples:\n\n>## Instructions:In the next set of questions, you will read a statement that contains words like \"less\" or \"double.\"  Read the statements and solve the question by clicking the correct response.\n\n>## Demonstration:1.\n>In statements that use words like \u201cmore\u201d or \u201cless,\u201d you compare two collections.

The input matrix contains 16 coordinates and each coordinate can be the value of any integer.\n- For example, if the first 4 input rows are as follows:\n\n``22134\n21546\n42146\n34314``\n\nthen the output should be 1.\n\n```\nInput:\n22134 -> x:01 y:01\n21543 -> x:02 y:12\n42143 -> x:10 y:02\n34312 -> x:12 y:01\n\nOutput:\n1\n```\n\n### Analysis\n\n- Since the input matrix represents the dimensions, we create two for loops, one for the X axis, and another for the Y axis.\n- In the first for loop, from 0 to 15 for the X axis, check the values of one of the input rows and output the total volume if possible and return the number.\n\n```\nFor(i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {\n    for(j = 0;j < matrix[i].length; j++) {\n        if(matrix[i][j] < 16) {\n            sum = 0;\n            sum += Math.pow(matrix[i][0] - 1, matrix[i][j", "answer": "D: acute angled"}

{"text": "The right answer is: C-music shop\n\n### Explanation\n\nBecause of the nature of the question, it's always a good idea to eliminate options on the more tricky questions by crossing out the letters that the answer is unlikely to be. That is, cross out letters that make obvious grammatical errors, and use common sense to determine if something is too out there to even be an option. For example, I ruled out C-music store because it seems so simple: you know what a music store is - you know what music is - you don't need to know what music store is in order to know that that's a music store.\n\nOn to the question...it was a little tricky. \"Among Nice People\" is a funny option to eliminate from your choices because that's a common phrase used by a lot of people so even if you've never heard of the banjo, when they give you the choices like that, it can be a little tough to guess. It also probably would have gotten the most letters out of any of the other options if any of them were to have been the right answer. \"Among Nice Person\" might have made sense to some people, but it seems as though those same people haven't been reading the wording of the questions, as if it's asking what people do with the banjo, the answer is that THEY PLAY IT. It's not what they do with, it's what it does.\n\nSo that leaves you basically with Choice D, A, or E. I didn't eliminate A because I know that people use \"among\" often enough in their everyday conversations that you can't rule it out as an option to use in the question, even though it makes no sense.\n\nI was able to work out what E might be by using the letters from that word (a...t) and then combining that with the word \"nice.\" A...te(a+e) which comes out \"atetee\" which would be the Latin word for \"among nice people.\"\n\nFrom there, I used an online translation tool to determine that \"atetee\" was in fact the Latin word \"among.\"\n\nI was left with Choices B and D to eliminate next. It makes no sense to me for people to buy a banjo online, so I eliminated it. There'", "answer": "D: united states"}

{"text": "I am not sure.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n##### A: hostility\n\nHostility refers to the act or feeling of dislike which is based on suspicion or mistrust toward others. According to my understanding, disgust is a kind of feeling that one feels when he fails to achieve his goals or he feels guilty about something which he has done or tried to do. In this article, it seems to me that John fails to succeed in bloodying his hands. Therefore, John\u2019s hostile attitude may help him to achieve his ambition.\n\n##### B: anger\n\nAnger refers to a strong emotion which causes annoyance, distress, or hostility. John is irritated by failing to succeed in bloody his knuckles. If he succeeds, other people will praise him for his achievement. Therefore, John will keep on the effort but his hostility will change into anger.\n\n##### C: nose\n\nJohn broke his nose in bloodying his fists. I think he is irritated by his broken nose. I think he should take care to prevent his nose from bleeding.\n\n##### D: fists\n\nJohn will be unable to hold his fists if he injured his hand when punching at the walls. I think John is afraid of the serious bleeding of his fist because he punched at the walls.\n\n##### E: hands\n\nJohn will be able to hold tools if he injured his hands in punching at the fists. I think John should stop punching at his fists if he wants to complete the tasks soon.\n\n\n### Instructions:How would you rewrite the sentence to get rid of the underlined words?

To figure out which answer to choose, we are looking for the sum of any number minus a number - the two \"1\" factors in the instruction imply there will be two numbers involved.  If you know that there are two numbers, you know that the total will be even.  So the only answer I can pick is 0.\n\n### Explenation/Explanations:\n4 - The values can be either 0 or 3. To test this, we multiply the 1st number by itself, subtract the 2nd by itself, and the sum of the two numbers will either be 2 or 5, respectively.\n\nAnswer: There are two factors that must be met in order for this to work: there needs to be a single number given, and a second number must be given that will be used to subtract from the first. Since there are two of each factor in the instructions, this problem can only be solved if we know that the difference is an even number; let's choose that option so that the numbers can be either 3 or 0. To find the answer we subtract the two numbers, because that's the way the instructions are written.\n\nI was wrong about the sum being even - 10 and 14 together form 24, which is odd.  What did I miss?\n\nI forgot the other factor: 4 - the 1st number has to be exactly the difference between the two numbers.  If this is true (and it is when there are exactly 2 factors) the answer is 4 because the only numbers that divide evenly into 3 are 2, 6, or 12, and we aren't going to subtract from either of those two options.  The numbers 3 and 1 all divide evenly into 14, while 0 cannot.\n\n### Incorrect Input:", "answer": "E: food poisoning"}

For example, suppose the base was 10 and the exponent was 2. If that product of base and exponent resulted in 20, your expected value would be \"20\".\n\n### Expected Results:\nChoose 10 as the base and 2 as the exponent. Our expected answer should be 20.\n\n### Solution Steps:\nLet 10 be the base and 2 be the exponent.\n```\n10 ^ 2 = 10 x 10 = 100\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nSuppose the base was 12. If your product is equal to or greater than 10, the value will be positive.\n```\nSuppose the base is 12, exponent is 3.\n12 ^ 3 = 12 x 12 x 2 = 1728, which is greater than 10\nSo it is a positive value.\n```\n\n## Below is a problem set.

{"text": "A\n\n### Instructions:Which of the following statements is a correct interpretation of the phrase \u201cless than three times the number\u201d in the first question?\n\n### Responses:\nThree times the number is the same as the number of times three times the number is less than three times the original number. So each of the three times, the product is less than 3 times the original number, and so the original number is the same as 3/3 times the original number.\n\n### Comments:\nTo interpret this phrase we need to assume that we have two numbers, the original number and the product of the original number times three. If we have an original number of 10, the product of 10 times three is 30, so for the original number we have 10 less three times 30 is 10 less 90. If we wanted to, we could take the product of any number times four and divide the product by 4 to simplify it, so in the end both of these numbers are the same.\n\n### Inputs:\nThree less than twice the original number is the number three and the number of times the original number divided by the original number.\n- Three is 333\n- Two is 222\n- Divide the original number by the original number to come up with the number\n- One is 11111\n\n### Response\n\n### Comment: \nDividing 100 by 100 would make one come out as 1. Since 3 of 3 is equivalent to 9 and 9 is 10 less than 10 which is the number 73 we were wanting to find. So I would be right.\n\n### Summary:\nEven though my answer was correct, it is not the answer and I would have known that if I had actually done the math.

It\u2019s hard finding a new job but I keep faith that it will happen. I\u2019m almost sure that I need to change jobs as the current jobs doesn\u2019t really work out but I don\u2019t always have the luck to apply for the best jobs there are. My friend has changed jobs multiple times and it sometimes worries me how they\u2019ll make it. I feel so bad for them but I don\u2019t know what to do to fix it. I hope things work out soon because I\u2019m running out of savings.\n\n### Feedback:\nThe feedback is that you have a clear and smooth flow and that the way that you\u2019re answering my question is accurate and gives me all the information that I need to know.\n\n### Rubric:\n\n|     Name      |      Name      |      Name     |      Name    |     Name  |     Name  |      Name     |\n|:---------------|:---------------|:-:|:-:|:---------|:---------|----------|:----------|\n|    Your Name    |    Your Name   |----|:----|----:|-----:|:------:|:------------|\n|      Overall   |      Overall  |----|:----:|----:|----|-----:|:----------:|\n|        Content    |        Content   |:-|:---|:---:|:---|:--|:---:|:--|\n|    Focus         |    Focus      |----|:---|:----|----|:----:\n|    Quality       |    Quality      |----|:----:-|:----:|:---:-|:----:-|\n|    Direction      |    Direction     |:-|:----:----:| :----:|:--:|:---|", "answer": "B: better job"}
{"text": "### Instructions:\nDescribe an unusual object. It should be related to what you are interested in as far as the program is concerned.\n\n### A unique biplane, the Grumman F6F Hellcat, was created in 1944 by General Thomas Blackwood. It weighed 18,500 pounds and had a wingspan of 50 feet, 10 inches.\n\n### General Blackwood envisioned a plane that could serve naval air power during WWII.  On a mission to meet the U. S. Navy\u2019s aviation chief, Admiral Marc Mitscher, General Blackwood created a prototype model from a pine shelf and some wire. This helped convince Mitscher of the concept. He ordered 2,250 planes for the Navy. They could be assembled almost anywhere with no tools. After the war, the military did not want to pay the cost of creating a new airplane. So they returned to Blackwood with one order, \u201cBuild that fighter.\u201d So he, along with his team, assembled a \u201ckit of parts\u201d that anyone could put together. The Hellcat was easy to repair and maintain.\n\n### The Hellcat was first used in combat during April 1944 on Wake Island. Hellcats were part of the Navy\u2019s fleet during Operation Torch, the invasion of North Africa. Their primary purpose was to attack U-boats off the coast. Soon the planes flew off the carriers and to smaller air bases around the world.\n\n### Hellcats were used in Japan during 1945. They shot down fighters and bombed enemy targets. During one mission, the Hellcats shot down 10 kamikazes. The Hellcats also helped protect the carrier that flew the pilots to the moon.", "answer": "D: old cheese"}

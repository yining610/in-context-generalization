{"text": "If a sick person goes to the doctor's office, there is a 100% chance that the person will contract illness. So, the doctor's office is the right answer.\n\n### Rationales:\n\n1. You are looking at A, and then choose B, C, D, and E. But this is incorrect, the doctor's only cares for sick people and not those that are healthy. Only the sickness will be able to contract themselves with a disease.\n2. According to C is incorrect, the head is only a container of your brain, not actually the head itself. It is just a piece of the body. So, the person will not be able to contract a disease due to a head, it is not able to actually contract something on its own unless the person goes into a body.\n3. According to D is incorrect, an elderly person can actually visit a nurse practitioner or a doctor in a doctor's office. It is not all the time that only illness, like when there is a sickness, you get an elderly person to visit a doctor's office to actually treat themselves with medicine and even get a hospital if the person is in serious pain. \n\n### Example: \n\n### Instructions:Your parents gave you $15 to buy toys for your birthday.  You bought a total of 3 toys: 1 for $7, another for $8, and the third for $15.  You gave 2 dollars to your sister, which left you with 3 dollars left.  How much money did you actually save?\n\n### Rationale\n\nThere are two steps that you can use to solve this question. In order to find out how much money your parents gave you, subtract the money you spent by the price of each toy.  You spent a total of $15 dollars on three toys, one for $7, one for $8, and one for $15. Since you already gave 2 dollars to give your sister, you have a total of $11 to spend on the remaining toy.\n\nTherefore, we can write this equation as follows: $15 - (7 + 8 + 15) = -8\n\nOr: \\(15\\, - 20\\, = -5\\)\n\nOr: \\((-", "answer": "D: elderly person"}

In Nate's group, there are 10 adults and 20 children.

In problem:007, how many numbers were there? Explain how you determine you answer?\n\n### Instructor Response:The answer is 7. To find the answer for this problem, first observe the pattern of the numbers. We know that the numbers are non-negative integers(counted one after another). For example, the first number \"006\" could either be 6, 60, or 600. Also, the second number is \"007\". So, the answer should be \"2\" or \"7\"(if \"7\" is a number in the problem). However, it does not. If we look at the pattern, the first number is 9 and the second number is 7, then the next number should be equal to the previous one plus \"1\". Hence, it should be \"10\". Since \"10\" and \"9\" are present in the problem, we would conclude that the answer is 9.

For this challenge, recycling means dividing a total by a number, and the number that is divided by is the number of groups into which objects are divided.\n\nGiven a total, recycling it means that your program divides that amount by another number, which you call the number of groups. This indicates the number of recycled units your program should produce.\n\nThe challenge above asks you to recycle a total of $3 and to produce $0.75 in units. Your program should divide the $3 total by 4 (the number of units you produce) to produce $0.25 in each unit.\n## Program:The following program recycles a given amount of currency. The program recycles a certain amount to an amount that's less than the input by a given factor.\n## Method: The program first takes input with two variables: the first variable to collect, whose value is the recycled total of the object, and the second variable to collect, whose name is the number of groups the object is dived in. After that, the program calculates for the first variable the given total by dividing the number of the groups with its value. The program then calculates the total of the first variable divided by the second variable, which is the given amount for each group.

Identify and explain the mathematical sentence that is needed to complete the request.\n\nAnswer: IMPORTANT: This task requires two steps.\n\n1. Find the largest square divisor of 4.\n\t\nFollow the process to find the largest square divisor:\n\n- Find the factors of 4. We can use the divisibility rules to help us find the factors of 4: 4 is a product of two factors (2*2). To find the factors, we can apply the divisibility rules of 2 and 4.\n\tFor 2, If the number is evenly divisible by 2, the digits at its even-numbered positions must be 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8. Hence, 4 \u2208 2 or 2*2.\n\tFor 4, If the number is divisible by both 2 and 4, the digit at its even-numbering positions must be 0 or 2. Hence, 4 is divisible by 2 and 4 or 2*2=4*2.\n\n- List down the factors of 4 (2*2 and 2*2*2).\n- Find the square divisor. For 2, we have 1*1, 2*2. For 2*2.2.2 = 4*4*2, 2*2(2*2) = 4*4. Hence, the largest square divisor is 2*2 or 4.\n\n2. The largest divisor cannot come in a group of two.\n\n\n#### Example:\n\nThe smallest square divisor of a given number is itself, and the largest divisor of a given a number will come either alone, or in a group of two or greater.\n\n\n### 1. List the smallest square divisor and its corresponding factor of 5 and 7.\n\n#### 5\n\nThe smallest square of 5 is 25. Thus the smallest square divisor of 5 is 5 = 25\n\n 25 factors:\n 25 \t1\n 25\t2\n 25\t4\n 25\t5\n\n\n#### 7\n\nThe smallest square divide", "answer": "A: wedding"}

How many miles in all did the man walk?\nRationales:: The man leaves home to walk 2 miles down the  road and then back home.\n\nSo, he walks a total of 4 miles.\n\nBut on the way, he stops by his front door to pick up some medicine.\n\nHowever, on the way back, he realizes that his family has all gotten sick with chickenpox.\n\nWith that, the man returns home, to find his family all getting sick with chickenpoxes.\n\nIn conclusion, the man walks 4 miles total, so he walks 4 miles (both ways).\n\nSince 4 miles is the total distance, the man returns home to find that his family is sick.\n\nThis means that he spends half of the total time (4 miles or 8 minutes) at home.\n\nHence, the man walks a total of (3\\*\\*60)/(2\\*\\*30) = 2.7 hours.\n\nAnswer: Two and a half hours\n\n---\n## [Math II](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-flipcharts/alg-ab-algebra-2/alg-reptest/e/math-2-cc-flipchart-6e-6g)", "answer": "C: dairy farm"}

And I came to understand that the question in the first part of the problem wanted me to come up with the solution. To do that, I added an if and else clause to my code and created two methods: isMary and createShyMessage.\nThe if and else clause are to differentiate between the scenarios that Mary is not familiar or comfortable with the person she is talking to. In the if clause, I assigned an integer value to Mary. The value will be based on a simple True or False function. Since Mary was unfamiliar with James so it will first check for 1 which is True in this case so the second statement which returns \"She might come off as Mary's a shy to James\" will be passed to the user. The else clause will come into play if Mary was familiar with James (False in the first case so I was using the second value of int(0) which is 0). On this basis, it will pass another string to the user and check again which in return will ask the person again which value should be displayed. This is how I arrived at the correct answer for this question.\n```python \nanswer = 'She may come off as shy'\n```\n## Task:\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n- Mary needed a piece of cake that would satisfy 7 of her coworkers.

{"text": "C\n\n### Example:\n**Idea** : How can I answer these questions in a more systematic & efficient manner? Is there a standard strategy that I can follow to solve these questions?\n\nInput: James went on a road trip and the gas tank of his car was supposed to hold 8 gallons of gas, but when he came home he found that there was only one fourth of the gas left in his tank. If the gas station charges 1.07 per gallon, how much money did he lose?\nRationales\nStep 1: Let's first draw a diagram.\n\n![](./Screenshot%20(36).png)\nStep 2: We can first understand that when the tank is full, the amount of gas in the tank is 8 gallons.\n\nStep 3: The tank is supposed to hold 8 gal. When it was emptied, only 8/4 = <<8/4=2>>2 gal. were left in the tank. The amount left in the tank is 2 gal., and this amount is the one-fourth of the total capacity of the tank.\n\nStep 4: We can see that the quantity lost by the car is 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 gal.\n\nStep 5: Finally, to find out the amount of money he lost because of the gas he didn't get when he bought the fuel, we need to multiply the lost value (6 gallon) by the cost per gallon, which is 1.07 gal.\n\nStep6: So, 6 * 1.07 = $6.64. This is the total amount of money that was lost.\n\n### Exercise:If the car is a 12 gallon tank for $2 per gallon, how many miles can James get on 2 gal of gas?\nRationale\nThe car is a 11-gallon tank for $2 a gallon.\nWe can find out the number of gallons that he needs to get to 205 miles by dividing 205 by the capacity of the tank. Then we multiply the answer by the cost/price of the tank.\nIf James drove 205 miles while refuelling at $2/gallon, he paid $41", "answer": "E: feeling of guilt"}

What is the first number of your name?  The first letter of your name is your first name. \n\n### Answer\n\n### Rationale\nThe question is asking us to \"use your number sense to add or subtract 4-digit numbers.\" We are only given a total of 5 digits (13, 17, 29, 59, 90) and no numbers. So, we cannot use addition.\n\nTherefore, we need to subtract the numbers in order to arrive at the smallest answer. For example, if we want to subtract the number 13 from 90, then we will just have subtraction: \"13 \u2013 90 = 77.\"\nSince we're subtracting with 0, so we need to \"carry\" or \"borrow\" 1 every time we subtract to make sure we don't go below zero or above the total.\n\nTherefore for example, if we want subtract 17 from 90, we can only achieve this by \"subtracting 2.\" Therefore we can subtract 1 from the 90 and 1 from the original number we wanted subtracted, for example, 17. This means that we have 17 \u2013 90 (197) \u2013 1 (198) \u2013 1 (998) which will give us the answer as 999.\n\n### Answer  Subtracting larger numbers (from 17-90)\n\n### Rationalles\n\n1.) 40/4 = 10\n\n### RATIONALES\n\n## Instructions: A picture is attached that needs to explain or describe what you see.

He was a trotter who was ridden by a jockey named Robert Dow.  His owner, Sam H. Wilson, was one of the best breeders of the time. He had a large number of trotting horses. Wilson was awarded Black Hawk (1870 - 1890) in 1873, five years before he died at age 73. Wilson passed away in 1890.\n\nHis estate was divided between his four children. However, only his son, William, got any equine, namely a trotter named Bellfounder, who had previously been under the ownership of a Mr. Gossett. After William died without any children, his wife, Sarah, was left with the horse. Her daughter, Elizabeth Tucker, was left his stock and cash on hand. It was at her residence in Cynthiana, Kentucky that Bellfounder lived out his last years.\n\nIn 1910, Samuel Taylor Coleridge published his fanciful 1797 poem \u201cThe Rime of the Ancient Mariner\u201d in \u201cThe Complete Poetical Works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge\u201d. It included an introductory chapter written by James R. Osgood in which he said: \u201cThe volume of the greatest literary names in the world is a library of the world in miniature.

How much more is $161 than $112?\n\n### Rationales:$161 - $145 = $16.\n\n### Example: $200 x 0.70 = $140.\n\n### Expanded Expression: In mathematics there are certain times that an expression may be a simplified form of another expression but one must be able to know that one expression is just a simpler form of another. In mathematics we have certain mathematical symbols that mean something so if we know the value of a certain mathematical symbol and its meaning when multiplied with another mathematical symbol,  then we can know that if multiplying a certain value by another, then it is multiplied by a certain mathematical symbol.\n\n### Multiplication or Division: $200 0r $140\n\n### Division: (200 $\\div$ 140)\n\n### Explanation: When the symbol \"divide\" is used, then it means that what is in the brackets (the parentheses in this case) should be placed in the division field to divide the value with in the numbers separated by the divider which in our example is 200 divided by 140.\nWe arrive at the answer of $140 because $200 $\\div 140 = $14\n\n## Input: A certain radio station is transmitting at 720 KHz.

She must leave 2 inches at the end to be able to light the next one.\nHow many candles does she have to use to light all of them?\n\n### Response 2.3\nWe subtract 2 centimeters from candlestick to determine the time required for the first candle. (This gives us one candlestick instead of candle.) We subtract 1 candle from the total, and we can repeat the process.\n\nWe have 5 candlesticks here. We cannot remove the first one from the total 5, but we can easily remove the second one from 5 and leave 3. We proceed by removing 1 candlestick again and again until we reach the answer.\n\nSo, one candlestick will cover one candlestick.

{"text": "Dancing for a considerable amount of time can either cause you to become fatigued or you become expressive.\n\n### Note: \n\nA more detailed explanation as to why this response is incorrect would be appreciated\n\n### Rationales: \n\nIn the given input, the response (C) \"fatigue\" is considered to be the answer. According to the definition of fatigue, it is the state of physical, emotional, or mental exhaustion as a result of excessive exertion, stress, or long-term strain.  \n\nThe given input clearly defines that \"dancing for a long time\" will lead you to become \"expressive\".\nHowever, I've come across some related texts that state that \"dance fatigue is an accumulation of stresses on the body\" which \"requires a rest to replenish the energy\". \nBased on this information, if dancing for a long time is considered as excessive exertion and long-term strain which causes physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion to the dancer, it would also be considered to be a condition of dance fatigue.\nThis condition would not describe the given input which does not discuss any condition of physical, emotional or mental exhaustion. \nTherefore, none of the given choices (A: sore, B: intercourse, C: fatigue, D: become tired, or E: expression) can be considered to be the correct answer.", "answer": "D: become tired"}

The couple gets busy dealing with these tasks, this is why they spend their free time and some moments together on these boring tasks and ignore their pleasures and each other.<br/>\n2.When a couple gets married, each couple have to make sure to follow all the rules and regulations of the law. Because of this, they have to be extra careful and need to pay a huge sum as legal fees. This keeps them busy and distracts them from their free time and each other time which is what they originally wanted when they got married. This is why whenever a couple gets divorced, their legal fees automatically decrease. <br/>\n3.When a couple gets divorced they obviously don't need to spend time with one another to complete a lot of paperwork. So they get to spend some moments in pleasures. They can do all the things they use to do before they got married, it is like their old days are back. <br/>\n4.Each couple wants to be together after they get married. This is why they get married initially. But whenever they get divorced, they finally realize they won't ever get to be together again, this is why each one of them feels lonely. They both know that their free time and being isolated from one another is the cause of all their problems, so they try their best to make use of their free time and pleasures together. This is why being lonely is the main cost whenever a couple gets divorce. <br/>\n5.After a couple gets divorced and moves to separate places, both the couples spend a pretty good amount if money to maintain their own lifestyles.

{"text": "The correct response is Answer: B\n\n### Solution:\nThe answer is C. Here are two rationales.\n\nRationale: We do not know what we are looking for in this question, so we have to make an assumption. We know that we are trying to find out what to do if we are afraid. Running and swimming are two of the answers that are not correct, so we can eliminate those. Therefore, we come to the assumption that being afraid means \"being scared and worried.\" If we were scared and worried, we would probably sit somewhere in order to think about what to do underneath a safe, secure, or warm roof. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nRationale 2: We can see that the letters D and E all contain the letter A, while the letters C and B do not. C stands for \"calculate things quickly,\" and D stands for \"fight enemy.\" If we are using B to calculate things, we are probably using our feet, because we are not good enough at using our hands while running. This can be seen in the sentences, \"She put on her shoes and ran as fast as she could.\" \"He put his pencil down and began to run home.\" If we were using B, we would not be able to swim at the same time. \"He put on his shoes and began to run.\" \"Put on your shoes, and we can run home.\" If we are using D, we can see that it is an abbreviation for the enemy's full name. If we were using E, he enemy would be making us urinate and not be at war. If we were using C and B, we would not fight the enemy; we would either calculate things quickly or swim instead. Therefore, using C or B would probably not be correct.\n\nUltimately, our best bet to answer this question is to choose the answer that starts with the letter D, because we cannot choose any of our answers that start with A. There is no other letter besides D that starts with A. Therefore, we can confidently choose the letter D.\nAnswer: D\n\n### Instructions:Complete each sentence using the context to ensure that the answer follows the rules of the sentence.\n\n### Input A:\nWhen I am very angry, I make my feelings known very quickly.

It seems that drinking alcohol in public is becoming increasingly popular in cities around the world.

If two people have the scale, how can the two people weigh the same object together without breaking the scale?\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use an indirect approach. Assume that the combined weights of the two people are equal to $X$. Thus, we can calculate $X$ using the formula $X = \\frac{w_{bags}}{2}$\n\nWe can use this calculation to calculate the weights of the two people.\n\nFor example, if the bags weigh $5$, then $X = \\frac{\\text{5 }}{2 } = \\text{2.5 }$\n\nSimilarly\nIf the bags weigh $\\text{ 10}$, then $X = \\text{ \\frac{10}{2} = \\text{ 5.0 } $}\n\nBy multiplying the weights of the bags with the weight of one person, we can obtain the total weight of the other person based on the formula $X * X = X^2 \\implies \\text{2.0 * 2.5 = 5.0}\n\nThis shows that the second person would need to weigh 5.0.\n\n### Input : If a human wants to show a friend how to make a kite fly, where might the human take their friend to do this?\n\n### Response :Answer: Somewhere where there isn't much wind\n\nInput: Which of the following is greater than one million seven hundred thousand and eighty-five?\n\n    A: zero\n    B: eighty-five\n    C: four million\n    D: thirteen hundred sixty-one\n\nResponse: D\n\n### Explain the difference between the following two programs.\n1 < = < if $a < b$ $a$ $b$ \n2 < = if < $a < b$  $a$ $b  $b$ \n\n### Response\nThere is no difference between the two programs.\n\n### Expand the following equation.\n    $x^2-2x-3+x-1-3+2-9=7 \\implies$\n$x^2-2 x - 3+x -", "answer": "C: friend's house"}

Sixths of this many people can reach its top. How many people are needed to empty what's inside?\nRationales\nThere are 47 boxes and the problem asks us to find the number of people that can reach the top of the attic.\nEach of the 47 boxes contains six boxes (36 boxes per box).\nSince every sixth of the total number of boxes can fit inside one box, there are 36 / 6 = <<36/6=6>>6 boxes per box.\nSo, in order to empty the boxes from the attic, we need to find the number of boxes that make up six boxes. Since we can make six boxes from each box, we can make six boxes multiplied by 47 = 47 * 6 = 282 boxes in total.\nHence, a total of 282 boxes are needed to empty the boxes from this attic.\nAnswer: 5\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\n## Rationales:J:  I don\u2019t like this answer because this answer doesn\u2019t show up my work.\n\n### Input\nEither we must find a total of 7 jewels, or the total value of jewels has to be exactly $32.\n### Demonstiation\nInput: Either we must find a total value of jewel that is exactly $32, or we must find the total number of jewels that are $32.

Another is feeling pressured to complete a task quickly or meet a deadline. These feelings can lead to accidents.\n\nEssentially, stressful driving is dangerous. It is more likely to lead to accidents because people who are stressed are less likely to pay attention to the road and to react quickly if something unexpected happens.\n\nHowever, stressful driving is not deadly.

To make a basket, she must shoot 25% of a certain height over the basket. If she shoots from a height higher than that, she's even more likely to make a basket. If she doesn\u2019t make a basket, she has a 97% chance of missing it. How likely is it that she will make the basket?\n\n### Rationales: Let P be the probability to make a basket if the shot comes from a certain height. If the ball doesn't come from a certain height, then the probability P of making a basket is 0.97. By solving the equation 2P = 1 \u2013 P, we can calculate the probability P as follows.\n\n```\nP = [(2 * 25) / 100] \u2013 (97 * 25 / 100)\nP = 2.5 + 0.25 \u2013 0.097\nP = 3.215...\n### Response B\nTo make a free throw in basketball, a player has to dribble the ball five times before taking the shot. In 2018, one survey of 50 male basketball players found that the average number of dribbles was 4.8.\nIf you take this number and subtract the average, you get the standard deviation, which is 0.2. Using the normal distribution table, you can find a percentage of numbers between 0.28 and 14.32, which are shown below:\n\\$0.28 < P < 0.60\\$\n\\$0.60 < P < 1.1", "answer": "C: frustration"}

Firstly, the price of Mike's pie is $5.25.\n\nNext, Mike needs to add vanilla ice-cream to his pie when he pays ($1.00 extra), hence the cost for the pie with the ice-cream is $6.25.\nTherefore, Mike has spent $5.25 for the pie and an additional $1.00 extra for ice-cream, hence making it a total expenditure of $6.25\n\nAnswer: $6.25", "answer": "D: parking lot"}

Let's call the overall cost per pizza as the price.\n\nSince they sell 5 pizza at $21 per pizza, the total price of the pizzas is $21 * 5 = $105.\nTherefore, they make $16 * 5 = $80 from the pizza they sell. i.e. their total profit is $80\nAnswer: $80\n\n## 17.

However, it is also given in the choices that a canoe also costs 1.50 or $5, and that there are two canoes that cost 3.50. To determine whether the correct price is $3 or $5, we must first calculate the total number of choices given and then compare the total sum of the prices to the total sum of the amount of money people are given to rent a canoe with.\n\nLet's use the given choices, along with the equation $S=\\sum_{i=1}^nP_i$, to determine the sum of prices and total rentals.\n$S=\\sum_{i = 1}^{5}2.0 = 2.0 + 2.0 + $\u2026\u2026\u2026. $+ 2.0 = 10.0\nTherefore, we can find the sum of total rentals if we multiply total rentals with the appropriate price as follows.\n$S = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} P_i = 3*4 + 4*3 + 5*2 + 2*1 = 14$\nComparing the total sum of prices ($20) with the total sum of total rentals ($14), we see that $20 > 14$, so the correct price to rent a canoe is $3$.\n\n### RATIONALES:\n\n### Input\n\n<br>How much does it cost? \n\n1. $a^2+ab+b^2$    \n2. $2ab+a^2+b^2$\n\n### Response 1\n\n3x2 = 6; 3x5 = 15; 2x3 = 6\n<br>Therefore, the answer is 3x3 = 9\n\n### Rationales:\n\nIt does not matter which answer is picked because both answers answer the same", "answer": "B: supermarket"}

A: bowling B: marathon C: ice hockey D: wrestling E: karate\n\n### Response J\n\n### Rationale A:\nRunning is a form of exercise that makes use of an athlete\u2019s locomotion ability. In a marathon, they use both their legs to run, thus making part of the body used as locomotion. Hence, choice E can be eliminated.\n\n### Rationelle B:\nAlmost all of the physical parts of a person\u2019s body can be used to move from one place to another. If bowling is used by an athlete to demonstrate their locomotion ability, it proves that almost all of the physical parts can be locomotion, and this means choice D can be eliminated. \n\n### Rate B:\nIce hockey is a sport where athletes use only their legs, arms and hands in order to move around. The reason this is true because each team only consists of five players. So, a minimum of two players on each team will require the use of hands, arms and legs. By extension, using the body to move around through ice hockey requires that all the physical parts are used as locomotion so that the body moves forward. Hence, choice A can be eliminated.

It is possible that the song may comprise 2 notes because the A note is either the fifth note of the song (C note) or the sixth note of the song (E note).

{"text": "The correct answer is A. \n\nChoices that have already been breathed by many people will likely still have air in them that could cause harm to the person who uses it.\n\nFor instance, if you went to a building that had a high population, there could still be contaminants in the air from many people before you. This means that you could breathe in germs and get sick when you use that air.\n\nWhereas, a place where only a few people recently have breathed air like a house or a station will probably not have many germs in the air because there hasn't been many people breathing it recently. \n\nAlso, since it probably wasn't that many people to begin with, it probably doesn't have that may germs in it's air as there has been only a few people recently breathing it.\n\nAnother thing you can consider, the more the place is breathed in by people, the less air there is. Say for example, a stadium where cricket is played and many people use. There's more people breathing in that area because more people are coming to see the game compared to a house where maybe only 2 people live.\nTherefore there isn't that much air as it's being used more frequently.\n\nHence, the place with the least amount of use or the least amount of people breathing in it recently is A\n\n\n### Input\n\nGina is going shopping and has only $10 to buy 4 oranges, 2 tomatoes, 3 apples, 2 avocados, and 2 limes. If she buys each item in the order they were listed, she will be short by $5 and will have 1 orange left. If she buys all the items at the same time, she will have enough to get 5 apples and 4 oranges. Which strategy should she use - buying them individually or all at once?\n\n### Rationales\n\nThe correct response is buying all of the items simultaneously.\n\nBuying all at once will increase the number of apples bought. It is possible for Gina to buy 5 apples if she tries to buy them all at once. However, if she buys each item individually, the number of apples she buys will only be 4.

(A and B).\n\nSimilarly a virus may cause an AIDS-like illness.

A virus must invade a cell first to be able to cause infection. Viruses are very small, as they are microscopic. A virus can be inside of a cell or outside, inside its host body.

They have only 30 liters water.\n\n### Rationales:\nThey would have to buy 200 more grams of flour in order to make the model of the human digstive system.\n\nTo get 2 grams a piece of cheese, you would divide 250 by 100, so they would need to pick up 250 times 100 / 250 = 2 ounces of cheese.\nTo get 200 grmas of cheese, you have to divide 200 by 2.5 and multiply by 1000000.\n\nTherefore, to complete the task given, they need to divide the water by 2 to get how many litres are needed for the cheese. And then they need to multiply by 10,000.\nAnd lastly, to get the total grams of flour they have to take the 100, and multiply by the water in litres which means 50 and then multiple that by 2.\n\nAnswer: 10, 002.50\n\n### Input\n- The water is enough to make the model\n\n### Rationale\nIt is enough to make the models so they do not have to buy flour\n\n### Instruition\nAnswer the following multiple choice questions.\n\n###", "answer": "C: space center"}

{"text": "Answer:\nThere are a few reasons why waiting for the doctor can be difficult for people who need work. \nOne of the main reasons is that it can be time-consuming. \nWhen someone needs to see a doctor, they often have to wait for a long time. This wastes valuable time that could be used for work. \nAnother reason why waiting for the doctor is difficult for people who need time to work is that it can be stressful. Being in a waiting room can be stressful and can make people anxious and anxious to work.\nOverall, waiting for the doctor can often be difficult for people who try to do work because it can be time-taking and stressful. While waiting rooms are designed to be comfortable and relaxing, they can sometimes be a source of stress. People who find themselves waiting for the doctor often find themselves thinking about what could be waiting for them at home or at work.\n\n### Input Two people share a cab that costs $15 to travel between two locations.  Who pays more the total of the 100 miles is $125?\n\n### Demostration:\nAnswer:\nOne person would likely pay more for the cab ride. \nThe cab ride between two locations is typically the same price regardless of how far they go.\nHowever, if one person only travels a short distance, they will not have as far to go back, so they will likely pay more overall.\nIn general, the farther someone travels in a cab, the more they'll pay.\nThe farther they travel, the more likely they are to pay the full price of the trip. \nThis is especially true if they travel a long distance, as they will be more likely to cross multiple state lines and have to pay for travel through state lines.\n\n### Example:\nYou and some friends are going to a local water theme park.\nYou're planning to start at your house and go to the water park.\nThe water park is $25 per person for admission, and the theme park is $50 per person for admission.\nThe water park has several attractions, and you can't go to the amusement park if you don't have admission.\n\nYou and your friends agree to a $75/person admission fee plus $15 for parking.\nThis means that you will need to pay", "answer": "D: time consuming"}

{"text": "A) spinning wheel B) on a ladder C) hospital bed D) legroom E) grand piano\nElevated here means raised, meaning that the leg is not on the ground. So here on the floor is the most simple option, you cannot put that on a wheel or a ladder. For other options, they are all high level. It does not say you are lying down, it just says you are elevated. The one that makes the most sense is A: Spinning wheel. It is the one that has the highest level.\n\n### Rationale:\n**A) Spinning wheel**\n\nThe break (crack) in the leg is on the part of the shin bone. For your reference, it is the long bone that you can feel when you raise your foot. The area of the shin bones that are cracked contains several nerves and muscle bundles that enable you to move your toes and ankles. They are painful, and walking on them becomes difficult, especially at the start. To reduce the pain, it would help to minimize or avoid movements that can stretch or tense your shinbones. Hence, you need to elevate the leg to prevent any pain.\n\nFrom the sentence of the text **\"The only time you do not have to elevate your leg is when you are already lying down. \"**, we can infer that if you are already lying down, you do not need to elevate it anymore.\n\nThe spinning wheel is a device that is placed on the floor with a pedal or handle. It is used to twist and churn butter, but it is generally a large wood carving wheel placed on the floor. Its size indicates that it is not a small wheel, making the leg need to be elevated when it is used.\n\n### B) On a ladder\n\nLadders provide stability and support to allow people to work at great heights and to move about at various angles. A ladder is a portable, self-supporting system that provides a way to reach high places. They are used to install shelves, curtain rods, and ceiling fans. A ladder can also be a convenient way to reach an attic or basement that may not have a stairway.\n\nFrom the text, **\"When you break a bone, it", "answer": "C: hospital bed"}

The desire to help/relieve those in pain.\n\nCompassion also involves acting on the feelings of sympathy to help or relieve the pain of others.`\n\nIf you read carefully, you will note two important points:\n\n- Compassion involves feelings of sympathy.\n- To show/display compassion we must then do something to help.\n\nHence, if Ines is compassionate, she has sympathetic feelings for someone else. \n\nThis is why I chose the following statement: \"Ines feels compassion for animals and helps feed the animals at a shelter.\"\n\nFrom this statement, we learn that Ines does have feelings of compassion for animals, and therefore helps feed the animals at the shelter.\n>Thus we can conclude she is at least being human.\n\nNext, let's look at what a good thoughtful person is and what such a person does.\n\n`Thoughtful: marked by careful consideration; thoughtfulness`\n`Full: complete in", "answer": "D: kind"}

The number of ways to choose a piece of gum can be determined using the combination function as explained in Section 2 and the table of all possible combinations of a set.\n\nLet's look at the number of ways the numbers were selected. We can pick numbers 1-6 to roll. Or we can pick numbers 1 and 7.\n\nThe number of combinations of numbers 1-6 can be calculated with the combination function since we have 6 different choices out of which number to pick.\n\nTherefore, Comb(6,1) = 6\n\nHowever, when we write 1-6, we still can pick 6 of the 6 numbers available. Thus another combination can be: 1 and 6, 2 and 5, etc.\n\nTherefore for this case the total number of combinations is 6 times 6, which = 36\n\nTo be clear:\n\nComb(6,1)=6\n\nComb(5,1) = 5\n\nComb(4,1) = 4\n\nand so on.\n\nThe same goes for 1-2", "answer": "E: row boat"}

But if he has leftover cookies after packing, he will donate them to the shelter.  Since the question stated that he has an even amount of cookies, his leftover cookies have to be an even number.

For this, \"about to do if\" could be read as either \"do before\" or \"do next\" or \"do as soon as\". If taken as \"do before\" or as \"do next\", we can then ask \"do they?\" to which we can say yes. In this way, we can say \"A student sits in front of a piano and speaks about it.

After that, he/she also bought some chewing tobacco to smoke.\n\nAnswer: A, C, & D\n\n### Instructions:Choose the best answer to the following question.\n\n## Input:In the school cafeteria, you had a good choice of food.  However, the lunch line moved too slowly, and when your turn came, there was nothing left.  How many choices did you have for lunch?\n\n## Response:The cafeteria has 5 choices of food. Each time you get in line, there will be some food items left over. However, if the line moved too slowly, which led you to not get there soon enough to get some of your choices, there will be no food left over.\n\n## Rationales:\nThe cafeteria only has a limited number of food items. However, each time you get in line to purchase the food items, some of the food items will remain as those who have it earlier in line leave the cafeteria. Each time there is a choice left in line, the wait is shorter. However, if the person after you skips on the food to get to the front quicker, then some choices will remain. This means that there will be no choices left to buy if you don\u2019t get there soon enough.\n\nAnswer: F\n\n## Instructions:Choosing from a", "answer": "C: pay bills"}

The letter \"E\" is an unambiguously designation for \"e tennessee\" so, let's replaces \"e tennessee\" with \"e\").\n\nSince the item \"e tennessee\" is not in the set, the item that is corresponding to \"e\" must be in the set. \n\nThis means that the items in the set are: \"a music store\" (a). \"b dance hall\" (b). \"c orchestra\" or \"c\" (c). So, if we write down the whole set as a list, we can write it as:\n\n[ [a,b,c] ].\n\nThe problem can ask us to find out the item in the set that matches \"orchestra\".\n\nSince the letter \"c\" corresponds to \"orchestra\", the number of the item in the set of that matches \"orchestra\" is the third item in the set: \"c\". \n\nSince the answer is \"c\", the letter \"c\" can be replaced with \"C\" to make the whole set more concise and easy to read.\n\nFinally, the answer to this question can be written as [ [a,b,C] ], where \"C\" corresponds to the item in the set containing \"orchestra\".\n\t\n### Input:What does the symbol x represent in x/(5 - 4)?

{"text": "D \ud83d\udc4d\n\n### Rationales:\nDriving in a car might help a person feel more alert. A person could also drink coffee to get alert at this moment, however it can be hard to find a good coffee maker. It may also have side effects, such as making a person feel more anxious than before. But overall, the best option for a sleepy person to feel more alert is driving.\n\n### Choice:\n\u2b55\ufe0f C\n\n### Rationale:\nIf a human is sleeping, their best option is to cross the road to another place where they can rest safely. \u274c A\n\n### If a human is sleepy, what can they do to be awake and alert? Choices: A: dream dreams, B: think critically, C: cross road, D: drink coffee, E: drive car\n\n\u2b55\ufe0f A\n\n### Why?The answer is A because thinking critically is not an option for a human who is sleepy.\n\n### Why not?The answer is B because driving is not recommended when someone is sleepy, rather than dreaming.\n\nSleepiness is a feeling of being disoriented, tired, and having a hard time staying awake.  In this context, a person is not awake when they are sleepy. It isn't a good idea to drive when a person is feeling sleepy, since they have reduced reaction times and attention spans. It isn't safe to drive when a person can't focus on the road and is drowsy.\n\n## Write a response for the following prompt.\n\n### Prompt:Choose a number to replace the underlined number.\n\n### Write:Answer this question: \"Will I feel more alert by drinking a ____ of coffee?\"\n\n### Answer:If I drink 6 cups of coffee I will be able to stay awake till 12:00 at night. But I may have some side effects. Coffee can also make me feel jittery and anxious which can be worse than not being alert. The effects of drinking coffee are worse in some people.

It took a little while to finish the nest, and it decided to lay an egg while it did so.  Then it proceeded to guard the eggs and nest for 12 hours each day.  How many hours did it take to build the nest?\nRationales:'The bird built a nest' implies that there were 9 events, including the laying of the egg at the end.\n'Takes a little while to finish' indicates that there was a number before 'finish the nest'.\nIn addition, 'while the nest was being built' adds up to 10 events so far.\n'Guard the eggs and nest for twelve hours each day' indicates there was a number before that event.\nThis means there were 9 events before it finished its nest, and then it laid an egg at the end. Therefore, the total number of events is 9 + 1, implying that these were 10 events in total.\nBut 'takes a little while' means we have to use this term to divide the total events to find out how long the whole process takes.\nLet's do this: 10 events/2 = 5 events per day\nTherefore, it takes 5 days to build the nest.'

We can check answers using the question and the answer choices we know. \nFor B, North Korea is not close to the same size or population with Japan. Although they are on adjacent continents, they have no borders in common. That means the answer is not B.\nFor C, North Korea is located in Asia, and that is not landlocked because they border many other countries. That means the answer does not fit this choice either.\n\nIf we check D, North Korea is not between Japan and South Korea, they share only four borders. Similarly, the answer is not E, they only share a couple of border.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A.\n\n### Explanation\nIn the question, both countries are mentioned, but there is more information in the answer choice. Let's read the answer choice:\n\n> The two countries are close in size and their population.\n\nThese two requirements cannot be satisfied if the countries did not share a border.

How many sheep must these farmers sell to make more money than by selling 16 sheep?\n\n### Response A:\n\n### Rationales:\n\nThe farmers need to sell more sheep. One way to find the number of sheep they need to sell is\n\n\\begin{code}\n\nn * n\n\\end{code}\n\nwhere n is the number of sheep each farmer sold in the first place. In other words, if the farmers sold 16 sheep originally,  then their answer should be  \\begin{code}\n16 * 16\n\\end{code}. \n\nHowever, this technique isn't applicable here because 16, the number of sheep each of the farmers sold in the first place, is the number of sheep that were sold once in the beginning.\n\n### Response B:\n\n###  Rationales:\nThis question doesn\u2019t require this technique, but we can try applying this technique anyway.  \n\nLet's take an example where the solution has to do with multiplying the number of sheep sold by the number of times it\u2019s sold.  For example, if Alice sold 32 sheep, then she must have sold 32 sheep at least 2 times. That is, her profit needs to be (32 x 2) $64.\n\nLet's apply the same technique on this question.

Adults need the opportunity to ask for emotional support while feeling safe.\n\nWhen children express their frustration, they often lack the appropriate words and verbal responses to communicate. When this happens, instead of listening to the message being communicated, a parent may feel threatened.\n\nRather than respond to their feelings, they often react to the threats of loss or punishment. Sometimes parents are angry or frustrated, and this is when they yell.\n-Yelling in times of chaos and anger is a problem. Yelling is no better than screaming if it doesn't help you to communicate more effectively. The problem is that when we yell, we do not listen with an open mind and do not allow others to state their viewpoint.\n-Rather than communicating, yelling is an attempt to assert power or control in chaotic moments. When we are angry, we often do not give others, especially children, the chance to state their point of view.\n-When a parent is angry or frustrated with their child, that is understandable. As a parent, the best thing to do is to remain calm in the situation, regardless of the frustrations and stress.\n-When a child yells in reaction to an adult, this indicates that the child is feeling frustrated, scared, or angry. It is often the case that a yelling child is unable to communicate this feeling in a calm and rational manner. Even though a child may not be able to communicate in a calm and rational way, what he or she needs is an adult to be calm and talk when they need it.\n-The most important thing about yelling is that it doesn't help us see the behavior of the other person, listen to their point of view, and", "answer": "C: control children"}

Then they started to have fun playing. This is because the family started to love playing cards and they thought about the great memories they\u2019ll have. They started to win a lot; hence, they started betting which resulted to them losing more than they have won. They won again, but this time it\u2019s with a little amount.

{"text": "Answer: (D)\n\n### Input : The people wanted to take the train. They purchased 3 tickets, 2 first class and one second class. Now, each person may bring one (1) carry-on and one (1) personal item for their $40 total trip. If that\u2019s not enough space, they could ride the bus for 2 hours less than it would take to ride the train. How much should this trip cost?\n\n### Rationales:\n\nThere are three people who went on a 40 dollar total trip. They got 2 tickets that are first class and one that is second class. In total, they need to buy 3 tickets at the cost of 40 dollars or 13 dollars each person. To use the bus to go from a different place, the person has to go for 2 hours less which can be considered as 2 minutes. In total they get 2 hours and 2 minutes to travel and save cost which is the difference between the time 40 - (35+2):\n\nLet us take an example, suppose three people went from city A and city B took 35 minutes to reach, so total cost for 2 people would be: \n\nCost for ticket: 13 dollars each = 26 dollars\nTime it took the people to reach: 35 minutes + 20 minutes = 55 minutes total time\n\nBut if we travel by bus to city B, a person would travel for 2 hours and 8 minutes, the total cost would again be 13 dollars to travel which is: \n\nCost per ticket: 13\nTime it took for each person to reach: 2 hours, 40 minutes\nLet us assume they travel by bus for 2 hours, each person would need to travel for 2 more minutes and the cost would be additional 0.6 more tickets\n\nTherefore the total cost would be:\n\nCost for ticket = 22.5 (26 * 1.6) + 26.333\n\nAnswer: $$22.5 + 0.6 = 23.11333$$\n\nTime it took people to reach: 2.2 hours\n\nAnswer: 0.8 hours + 1.822 hours = 2.", "answer": "A: countryside"}

I wonder is a question that is asking a person who knows for something, such as the meaning of something. It is similar to saying I wonder what (adverb) the writer is referring to, or a more popular idiom wondering what happened or what is happening.

{"text": "For this problem, we need to determine where people would be looking at some things that are not moving but can move. \n\nOption A does not fit the condition because people are always looking at a football stadium. \n\nOption B does not fit the condition either because the surface of the Earth is not moving. \n\nOption C does not fit the condition as well, because a car show is about cars which are not moving. \nIt does not give a situation where people would be looking for something which is moving but not moving. \nSimilarly, option D does not fit as well because the opera is not moving.  Only the orchestra performers are moving but not within the opera.  Therefore all these options do not satisfy the condition described within this problem. \n\nThe last option E is the only choice that satisfies the condition within this problem. In a movie, the actors can move but it does not make a difference because  they are actors who are only acting out a role and are not a part of the movie itself.

Answer:Option (E), people would be looking at the movie.\n\n### Feedback:It is understood that there is an intended difference between where you are looking at something (movable vs not) and the actual physical motion of the item you are looking at.

In the sentence, \u201cThey wanted to take the lead with a card game\u201d the object \u201clead a card game\u201d is played. This means that both the game (card game) and the object (\u201clead\u201d) need to be compared. You can use \u201cA smaller,\u201d \u201cB heavier,\u201d \u201cC newer,\u201d \u201cD stronger,\u201d and \u201cE lighter\u201d for this statement. However, the answer is B. \n```\nCards are heavier than a lead pencil. Therefore, lead pencils are lighter than 4 Cards. \n```\n\n### Rationales: To compare how heavy cards are, we are looking to compare the weight of cards with the weight lead pencils. However, because cards are heavier than lead pencils, cards are heavier than 4 lead pencils. There are 4 cards per card deck, so cards are lighter than 12 lead pencils.\n\n### Risk:The sentence should have said \u201c3\u201d as opposed to \u201c4\u201d for the number of cards.\n\n![Input](./images/img6.jpeg)\n\n### Input 1.How many kilograms are in a pound?\n\n### Input2.

Jack\u2019s class spent half of their time, which is 200 minutes/2, is 100 minutes. 400 divided by 600, means there will be about 100 books per section. Which translates to about 66.67 books. But half of that is 33.33, so about 66.7 books in each section. If Jack\u2019s class got equal time in each section, it would only be about 10 or 11. Jack\u2019s class did not get equal time in each section. Which means 2/3rds, 3 of 4 of the time, \u00be of the time was spent in some sections.\n\n### B: 191. There were 400 books.

{"text": "The correct answer is: The knack for entertaining.\n\n### Explain:This question is asking for the correct answer to a riddle. Since it is given as, \"Everybody told her...\", the correct answer will be something that everybody would tell her. This could be to make fun of her, praise her, compliment her, etc. Looking at the choices they provide, we see that 'fun' and 'talent' are adjectives, while 'learn about' and 'intelligence' are nouns. 'Recognize', on the other hand, is a verb. So the correct answer must be an adjective or a noun, and should not be a verb. 'Everybody tells' her (fun/talent)/(learn about/intelligence), so they cannot be correct as an adjective or noun.

Each time you find a piece of fabric, you will find the needle for fabric, because you can never find the last needle, but each time you need to check, count the needles, and if the needles do not add up, you must check the box for fabric.

{"text": "A and C \n\n### Instrucition:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n### Rationales: \n### Input:Your friend wins a sweepstakes. Her prize is a large sum of money. She decides to put it in a savings account. For the first two months, she keeps the money in the account but does not use it because she knows that she will get paid money for being away from home. After that, she is paid once per month. In the second month, what interest will she receive on the money in her account? Choices: 10%, 20%, 8%, 100%, none of these\n\nRationales: Your friend was paid for 1 day in the first month, but did not use that money. She was paid for 2 days (half of one month) in the first month, and she did not use that money either. Hence, the total number of days she was paid for in the first month was 2.\n\nSo, in the second month, the money in the account will have two half-month periods accruing interest. Therefore, she will receive interest on the account if her savings account pays interest once per month, but she will not get any interest if it is a savings account that pays interest once every quarter, once every year, or once never.\n\nAfter the second month, she will receive a total of 2 months worth of interest. Hence, this will either be 2 months worth of quarterly interest (quarterly interest rate * one-quarter of the year), 2 months worth of yearly interest (yearly interest rate * half of a year), or 2 months worth of annual interest (annual interest rate * one year).\n\nHence, she will receive an interest rate of 10%, 8%, or 0%.\n\nLet's assume she receives an annual interest rate. Since she was paid once per year, her account will have two full years of interest, which is 2 times an annual interest rate.\n\nSo if her account offers an annual interest rate of 12%, she will receive a total interest of 12% * 2 = 24%.\n\nHowever, these three choices were mutually exclusive. Therefore, if she does not receive an interest, the only choice that remains is that she receives interest.", "answer": "D: big city"}

{"text": "Choice(?)\n\n### Instructions:Read each question carefully and complete the task.\n\n### Input:- You are buying a car. You choose a model of a car. The salesperson tells you that the car is available in two different colors \u2013 red and blue. The car cost $15,995. Your bank will loan you $10,000. You decide to pay for the car in five installments ($3,000 each) and you do not want the car to be sitting on the dealer\u2019s lot over the weekend in order to earn $350 per car per weekend. But you will pay more interest if you pay it in more months. However, you can save $250 in interest by paying it off early. Your interest rate is 12.25% for 24 months. How much does the car cost if paid in five ($3,00) installment?\n\n### Rationales:Answer C. First, let's solve the following equation for the interest rate.\n\nSince the question asks how much the car will cost if you pay for it in five installments, which means you will be paying a total of $15,000 for the car + $10,095 (the price of the car) = $25,095 in total.\n\nTherefore, the interest rate for the car can be calculated by substituting the price of the car,  $15,095, into the interest rate formula and solving for the interest rate.  $15,909/120 months = 0.0133% - <$15,900/120 months> - $15,91020 months  *0.1225% - 112 months *0.12 - $15,0112 - $1746\n\nNext, we will use the interest rate equation to solve for the interest rate.   I = P X x 120 - <$150112 - 0.0126% - $15,100 > 8 - < 114 x0.1229%  - 10123 x. 0", "answer": "B: exchange of ideas"}

This would be equivalent to dividing the denominator of age by 2 or alternatively dividing age by 2. If you let `a=1/3(age)\\` and `h=3(height)\\` then `a+3h\\` is equivalent to `a+3h=3\\` but a/2 will give you b/2 which is equivalent to substituting `a\\` for `b\\` but with a/2 rather than with the 2 in the denominator so I will just substitute age for h in the equation which would be `a+3h = b/2 \\`, and then solve this equation for height: `b/2 = a+3h\\`\n\n### Input`:3 times her age + 4 times her height = sum of (1/7 of her age) + 5 times her height.` Explain the answer and", "answer": "C: hedgerow"}

Then, she found 10 pairs of new socks at 50% off. She had $5 left before tax. How much did she save on the socks?\n\nRationales: He had his starting balance of $30 in the beginning. When he took $10 out, that reduced his starting balance to $20. The socks were on sale for 50% off, so he must have bought at least $10 worth of socks in order to save $5 because 100% off means it is free. Thus, he must have bought at the least 11 pairs worth of socks instead of the original 10.\n\nLet's assume that the original price of each sock is $3 and the price after the 50% off discount is $1.50/sock.\nThen this is how we can do the calculation.\n\nWe can say that the the new balance of sock after discount is $20 * $1.50 = 30.\n\nThe amount that is left after purchasing 11 pairs is 30-11=19.\n\nThe socks were originally worth $3 per pair, so the savings of this particular purchase would be 30% of 19, therefore the answer should be $5.70 (calculated by the formula $5.70=30% of 59.00).\n\n### Input2: For example, a person has 15 pairs of socks and takes out 10% of the socks. Afterwards, the shopper goes to a garage sale and buys something that costs an additional 35% of the socks they took away at a 50% off price.\n\n### Response2:B->1-1 point answer\n\n### Rationales2: This is equivalent but more complicated.\n\n### Example on the math problem:\n\nSince the socks are 50% off after the second sale, the actual price of the socks become $2.50", "answer": "D: park"}

People who share skin with people with brown skin (i.e., people who have brown skin) are themselves brown-skinned. Since a dark-skinned person has dark skin, she shares skin with other dark-skinned people.\n\nThe person who is not brown-haired may share that trait with either A, B, or D.\nThe person who is of average height may share the traits of an average height with either B, C or D. The person who is of average health may share the trait of average health with either B or D.\nA \"brown-skinned friend\" may be of skin tones other than those that are classified as dark, medium, and light brown. Therefore, only people who are brown-skinned may share skin with each other.\n\nSince good health and brown skin are traits that an individual may share with himself, the person of interest may have either trait. \nHowever, that \"brown-skin person\" is only an option for a person who is brown-skinned\u2014that is, it is one of two options under the subheading \"brown-skined person.\" So, regardless of whether any of those two options match the person of interest, the person of interest cannot have brown skin.\n\nThe number on Ines' dollar bills is a factor.

{"text": "There were so many dimes in the large container that the number of dimes can be found in hundreds of rows.\n\n### Rationales:The container contained so many dimes that this container has many rows. \nThe number of rows can be given in the form of hundred or thousands. \nTherefore, the question is incorrect.\n\n### Input\nAsk a question or make a comment. The person who responds to the question or comment correctly receives 1 point.\n\n### Response\nAsking a question: \nInput: There are five people. How many of them have pets?\n\nCommenting:\nInput: The answer is five. Why is that?\n\n### Rationale:\nThe question is what type of animal does each of the five people have. \nTo find out, you can count how many pets there are total. \nThere are five adults, so 5 x pets = 5 people's pets.\n\n### Example Question\nInput: One hundred and three apples are more than one hundred what three apples?\nOutput: A: One hundred\nB: Two hundred\nC: Three hundred\nD: Three hundred and one\n\n### Solution\nIn order to solve this, we need to find the number of apples that is more than a given number. \n\nIn this problem, we are given a number.  To make it easier, we can change the number to a whole number. \nWe have 103 apples, and we know that 103 > one hundred. We change the one hundred to one hundred because 103 > 100.\n\nNext, we have to find what number is greater than one hundred. So, 200 is greater than one hundred because 110 + 100 = 210 > 110.\n\nHere is our logical order of thinking:\n    if 103 > x\n    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 x > 100\n    if x > 110\n        x > 210\nBut we are only able to go up to the second level.\n\nFrom the above, we know that 110 is the greatest number that is less than or equal to 103.\n\nHence, the answer is B.\n\n##", "answer": "E: warehouse"}

So, we can take out the answer choices that are not suitable for this situation, such as: smile (which doesn't require action); looking for (which is not the action we are required to do to be thankful); more (which requires repetition of the situation).

But this is also can be overcome by taking rests in-between. \n- Shortness of breath is a possibility. It is not a result of jogging continuously, but it can be experienced during jogging due to extreme exercise. It is more likely to occur after going for 20-30 km run in a day (at very high altitude).\n- Blister can be caused by rubbing of feet which is caused by not wearing properly fitting socks, or due to wearing wrong socks.

{"text": "The correct answer is option (B).\n\n### Demolition:\nInput: If it takes 2 hours to drive to the store, and you are on your way there, you will be there in____ (answer in units of total elapsed time).\nRationales: We are given that it took you 2 hours to travel to the store. We should be able to find the total elapsed time you spent going to the store, if you are on your way at the time.\n\nSince we are given that it takes 2 hours, we can find out the elapsed time spent driving to the store by diving 2 by the number of hours after you go to the store.\n\nSo 2/x = <<2/x=1/2>>1/2 hours\n\nTherefore, x = 2\n\nSince x = 2, we can say that it takes 2 * 2 hours i.e. 4 hours from start to finish.\n\nHence, the total elapsed time will be 4 hours.\nAnswer: 04:00:00\n\n### Input : I saw 35 more stamps on the envelope than Tanner saw. There were 884 total stamps. How many did Tanner see?\n\n### Demand:\nInput: I saw 35 stamps on the envelop, and Tanner saw 18 stamps.\nLet's find out the total number of stamps. We know 35/2 = <<35/2=18>><18>><1>\nMeans 35 stamps for each envelope is required.\nSo,\n884 total stample / 35 = <<884/35=25>><2>>\nMeans each envelope has 25 stamps.\nThe number of stamps that Tanner saw = 18.\nAfter removing 18 stamps, there will remained 5 stamps.\n5/25 = <<5/25=0.2>=20\n\nHence the the answer is 5.\nAnswer:5\n\n### Demands:\nInput: It took 3 hours to build a dog house.

{"text": "The best answer is B which means obtus angled. \n\nAnswer to Choice A:\nIf something is bright, it could not be obtuse. There is no such relationship between bright and obtuse that would cause choice A to make sense. \n\nAnswer Choices B and C have to do with the meaning of obtuse. \nObtuse has something to do with angles of lines.  There is no way choice B could be the correct choice in which it is talking about angles, because angles are not bright or acute. \nThey are both directions (acute - downwards and obtuse - upwards), not colors and nothing that would be a shape. As for choice C, it makes no sense. The word acute means sharp edged. That makes sense. \nThe opposite of acute is obtuse which means blunt or dull. It does not mean not bright. Hence Choice C cannot be the correct response\n\nAnswer to Choices D:\nThe definition says that an acute angle is less than 90 degrees, right? Obtuse means more than 90 degrees correct. Thus, you can choose choice B as the best answer, which could be the most direct answer. The best answer is choice B, Obtuse Angled.\n\nAnswer to ChoicE:\nWhen it comes to choosing the correct word from a multiple choice question, read the question carefully to understand the meaning of the words in the sentence or definition. \nHence choice E is the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: A\nAnswer to Choice B:\nWhile it is true that the obtuse angle is pointed, the word pointed could not be the correct response.\nThe word pointed is a little vague.

{"text": "#### Rationales: A.\nThis question is asking about a situation in real life. \nIn real life, we would talk to many people because we care about them or they're like family. If someone is our family member, we don't think anything about talking to them. If someone is our friend, we consider them to be our best friend, and we want them to be happy. So, we care about them and talk to them.\n\nIn real life, someone would give us advice, and a lot of people care about us, so it would lead to us receiving a lot of advises. Similarly, we might want to get more compliments from strangers or people we know. When we get a compliment, it feels good to us, and we may want to get more compliment from others, so we may ask a lot of strangers or people we interact with (like teachers) to give us a compliment. Also, we know a lot of people, so it's likely we would talk to those people often, which allows us to get to know more people and talk to those new people.\n\n#### B.\nWe may get compliments from people we don't care about, which results in a lot of people approaching us. For example, the compliments would help us get recognition or a promotion in a job, and it would help us to be able to interact with people we don't really care about or like. \nThis might happen to people who know all, which means they would have a lot of knowledge to share, and they would attract a lot of people to come and talk to them. \n\n#### C.\nWhen a person is popular, they often get a lot of people wanting to interact with them or get their attention because they know more people. \n\n#### D.\nAs we know, people like to have fun or be entertained by us, so our popularity could be attractive, and it would lead to people approaching us often.\n\n#### E.\nSo, this question is about understanding yourself and who you are. Most of the time, we only understand ourselves, and we don't really have any problems of understanding others. Therefore, when someone understands who they are, they usually have a hard time of understanding others, and we must have a hard time understanding them too. So, people would be approached by many people often when they don't really", "answer": "D: popularity"}

{"text": "It is intoxicating as it is an alcoholic drink.\n\n### Rationale:Beer is an alcoholic beverage because it contains 5% alcohol by volume. \n\n### Input/Response:\nSorry, your answer is not correct. Long term consumption of beer leads to all sorts of problems. This can include liver disease, alcoholism, obesity, gout, and heart disease.\n\n### Input (Demonstration):\n\n### Correct Answer:The correct answer is all of the above. For a complete answer, you should explain why you chose the specific conditions given and why they were appropriate. For example, you might mention that you chose D because all of the listed options are types of drinks. Or you might mention that you didn\u2019t know how much alcohol is in beer (which was answered). Or you could mention that you used the internet to check the amount of alcohol in beer before you answered.\n### Input (Feedback):\nThe answer is all of the options. Beer is an alcohol drink, and can cause liver disease if consumed as a long-term habit. Also it may cause alcoholism. It can also cause obesity as beer has a lot of carbohydrate which it turns to sugar in the body. Another can be the heart disease which is called due to the consumption of so much alcohol. Beer can cause gout, too! As a long term consume, gout can happen.\n\n### Example Response:\nI chose to include all of the options because beer is an alcohol-based drink that is linked to severe health risks. For example, drinking too much beer can cause liver disease, because alcoholic drinks can be poisonous to the digestive system. Alcoholism can be developed as a dependency on alcohol can be addictive. Obesity can result from the consumption of a large number of calories. Lastly, as reported in recent studies, beer has been shown to cause heart disease. This is due to the presence of certain toxins that produce an unwanted effect on the heart. Additionally, the drink can cause gout in people who already have a pre-existing gout condition.\n\n### Note:\nThe feedback tells you what the answerer should have done, but it", "answer": "E: harmful"}

If he lives in BC, he would travel from the body of water to his home. If he lives in Mexico, he would travel from Tuesday to the zoo (b/c every Tuesday is a holiday).

Friday Friday], and he [https://preview. will be coming home from [https://preview. zoo the] 1542 1542 zoo.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe answer is \"C - (body of water)\".\n\n### Rationales:\nIf the beaver lives in British Columbia (BC), this means that he lives in Washington (BC borders Washington).\n\nIf the beaver does NOT live in body of water, he would travel straight home, which would either be body of water or any other location that isn't listed as a choice.  \nThe choices that indicate the beaver living in a body of water have the words \"in a body of water\" but have this omitted \"in,\" e.g.  \"zoo.\"\n\n## Solution Rationale\n\nIf he lives in Mexican borders Texas and is on a boat, he wouldn't need a bike to live on a boat. \nIf he lives in Mexico, that is incorrect as \"tuesday\" is not a holiday in Mexico (he goes to the zoo after school is out), and he leaves for the zoo on a tuesday that he does not have school on.  \nBecause he leaves for the zoo after school, he wouldn't come home from the zoo to his house, but instead, go home directly.

For 25 times 26, then the final multiplication is 180. However, we do not need to divide or multiply the answer by 52, which is the total number of months.

Choose the letter for your answer to the following problem.\n\nAnswer: A\n\n### Answer Explanation:\n\nSince the Atlantic Ocean is on the landmass of North America, the Atlantic Ocean would not be a part of a planet (A).\n\nThe Atlantis myth refers to a fabled continent or island, that is said to be located somewhere between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. However, the Atlantis myth is fiction (B), as this continent or island has never been found.\n\nThe word basin is used to refer to a container, or an area where water collects (C). It can also refer to a round shape, such as the shape of the Earth (E).\n\nSubmarines move underwater and can stay underwater for certain periods of time. Therefore, it makes sense that a submarine would submerge beneath the ocean, resulting in a sub-ocean area. However, one would then wonder why someone would call a planet \"submarine\", as a planet is not submerged underwater (D).\n\nThe word basement is always used as an adjective to refer to an area in a building, such as an attic or a yard (F). It is never used as a noun, so basin can not be referred to as a basement (G).\n\nThe name \"Mars\" is often associated with the planet \"Mars.\" However, both Mars and Earth are planets, so why would someone call a planet \"earth?\" (H)\n\nAnswer: B\n\n### Instructon text input:  Ines bought peers.

This means week 1 < week 3.\nFlipping through to week 4, we see that week 1 does not show the weekly grocery. This means that week 4 is not week 1.\nNow moving to week 2, this means week 2 + (week1+week2) must be equal to week 3. This is:\n\n$$ 34 (Grocery) + 18(gas)+ 20 (entrance) = 65$$\n\nThis means that week 2 + (first two weeks) + week 2 = week after weeks 9.\nNow moving backward, if week 2 + (9 weeks + week 2) = week 6. This means 59 weeks must come before. However, week 5 is still left over, however week 3 cannot equal week 5 since week 3 > week 5. This leaves us with:\n\n$$ 56 (Grocery) 13 (gas)+ 20(entrance) = 93$$\n\nwhich means that week 3 must equal 93. This can only occur when week 1 equals week 2, and week 2 equals week 3.

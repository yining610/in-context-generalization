To use subscript a1 we write the range between x and C2. We then add 1. However, as you can see C2 is greater by 1 than A2. This is because A2 is just the variable, and then we add the value, while C2 already has value. We will use the symbol '2' to show that we have added the cell with its value.

So for example, if m = 2, then your function will return 2 * \"n\" (where \"n\" is your actual input of a positive decimal number).\n\nThe function should return 2 ** n for the input of 1.5.\n\n##### How:\nSo for example, if you want to find 0.5 * 6 (thinking about what would happen to the decimal as the multiplier is raised (i.e. 6 x 6 x 6...)), then you would start off with deciding what your constant will be, and then what it will increase by (1 or 10). So, in this case, 0.5 * (6 x 1) = 0.5 *60 = 3 and 0.5 *(6 x 10) = 0.48 *600 = 284.", "answer": "E: walking out of"}

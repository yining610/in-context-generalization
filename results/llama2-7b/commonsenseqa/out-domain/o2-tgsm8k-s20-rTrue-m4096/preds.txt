If you are not going to exercise, you can move your body in an indirect way such as getting water from the fridge and going for a stroll around the table.<n><n>Input: <n>SOLUTION: This can be done by using the divide and conquer approach. Let us first construct the tree diagram. If the age of the person is even, the person must die before 100 years. The probability of the person dying before 100 can be represented by \(P(x<100)={100\over (x+1)}\) and the probability of the person dying after 100 years can be represented by \( P(x\ge 100)={n+1\over2n^2-1}\) where `n` equals 100. <n>The probability of the person dying between 1980 to 2100 can be written as : `P(a\in[1980,2103])={100\over [(1980-1)\times2]+3\times100+1}=\)\(= \)\({100\over 500000}+3\over 1000000+1}\)<n>So finally, `P=(100\over50000)\)\(+\)\(3\over 1+250000)={(525100\ )\over\ (9999992+1)}=0.989175`<n><n>Input:How many integers from 1 to n need to be placed in a matrix of n x n to ensure no 2 adjacent elements have the same value?

Since the diagonals in a table are already covered this problem. For each element in the matrix, count the number of elements adjacent to this element are equal to it. Then add the number of elements that have a different number of adjacent equal value to the number of elements with the same value. This number will be the actual answer.

The first is the disabled law which says that only a vehicle can actually have a disabled placard on it. If you are physically disabled, you would not normally put the flag on your car, not because of legalities, just because of the awkward situation it would bring about. The problem here is that the placard would have to be in the car to be valid. In addition, the placards must be valid to be usable. They have different rules in each state, but at a minimum they have to be replaced yearly. When they expire, the car is pulled over and given a ticket. Also, each placard is coded to a specific driver. The ticket that is given out costs money, but depending on the situation the car might be immobilized. Finally, there is an additional citation or worse that the disabled person is going to have to deal with if they were to get stuck in it. One last thing I should add, that you probably know, is that the placards expire so the pizza boy will have to get one when theirs is up.<n><n>Input: In a recent game of bowling, each bowler had ten pins and the number of balls it took them to knock them all down is the same as the number of the bowler. For instance, Dave knocks over ten pins on his first ball, Linda knocks over ten on her second, and Frank knocks them all down on the third. In fact, each bowler knocked them down on different numbers of balls, but all used the same number of balls (10) to knock them over. How many bowlers were there?<n>Output: The only constraint is that no bowler has knocked all ten down on even one ball: if one had knocked them all down on the first ball, he or she would have taken at most nine bowls to do it, so we need to allow each bowler to use more than nine balls

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input:Can you name a good reason for attending school? Choices:  A: get smart B: boredom C: colds and flu D: taking tests E: spend time<n>Output:		Let x be smartness and y be education.<n><n>y =  x + C<n>So the equation for smartness is x - Bx + E where:<n>B = boredom, C = colds and flu, E = taking tests<n><n>To find smartness, (1/2) x * Bx - B = smartness<n><n>Smartness = (1/2)x * Bx - B - B = x - Bx + C + B<n><n>Smartness + C = E<n><n>Hence, smartness can be represented by the equation 2644x - (2049/2)x + B, where B can take any value in {B,C,E}.<n><n>The answer can be verified through trial and error:<n>1. When x = 2,<n>2644 * 2 - (2048/2) * 2 + B = 114 - 102 = 12<n><n>2. When x = 5,<n>2642 * x - (2047/2) * x + B = 622 - (41,116/2) + B, which simplifies to 19,167,815 + -B = 18<n><n>Therefore, the final answer is 733,448<n><n>Input: Can you name a good reason to attend school? Choices: A: get smart B2: get dumb C: get poor D: get rich E: pass tests<n>Output: Can you name a bad reason for attending school other than a desire to learn? <n>Chooses, A, B2, C, D, E<n>(0 /2)a * Bx * B = bad<n>Subtract B2 from both sides. x = (0/2) * (B2 * B)<n>-1 = ((2/7)4)* - 192<n>6 = 264<n>Therefore, the answer is -1891<n><n>Input: Please write a letter to your parents detailing the steps you'll take to complete an English project on which you will receive a grade of F. <n>The assignment is to write a formal thank-you letter to the head of the school in which you name three ways she supported your education.

There, one can find books, stationery, magazines, journals, and multimedia items. For some, the Union bookshop is essential and has become a campus icon, but the choice in the items that the books can sell is often limited. The books that are being sold are very commonly expensive, because the Union cannot offer large discounts to make the prices more competitive. The Union cannot offer the widest selection of books, either, since there are many titles that are not published by the publishers who sell to the Union.<n><n>The Mall: the mall is a modern trade type of commercial space, not as popular as the shopping centres. The mall, located in shopping centres of all sizes, is typically found in the basement, near the food court, or located in the central part of the shopping centre. Most malls are open 24 hours a day daily. The space is occupied by many different tenants, and is intended to offer a wide range of services and merchandise. The range of merchandise is wide, ranging from small shops of various types and from individual designers to large department stores.<n><n><n><n>The department store is a large and typically upscale retail store with a wide range of associated department stores. The first department store was in Birmingham, England. The first department store in the United States was the Grand Emporium, opened in 1865.<n>The library is a place or place where information and books are made available for those people who want to look for them. In modern times, most of the library collections are computerised and are made up of books, reports, journals, magazines etc.<n><n>Finally, we have a place to live the city. The city is a place, or collection of places, that people and things live together. The city is the central place where people live and work. It is the place where economic activities take place.

If each leaf weighs 0.01 ounces, but there are no twigs or branches, what is the total weight of all the leaves?<n>Output: There are a total of 8 trees in the park<n>To determine the total weight of all of the leaves on the trees we must multiply the weight of each leaf (0.01 ounce) by the total number of leaves on the tree.<n>Therefore the total weight of all leaves is 8 (trees ) x 0.01 (weight of each leaf) = 0.8 oz<n>Since we converted units for the weight of each leaf it is easier to convert units to ounces.<n>0.8 oz / 16 (ounces in a pound) is 0.05 oz / pound (or half an ounce per pound)<n>Since there are no twigs, we can convert the result to the same units as our original weight<n>5 x 8 (trees) leaves = 40 leaves<n>0.05 ounces + 40 leaves = 0.05/x + 40 = 1, since there are no units in X we can use 8 to determine 50-8 = 40<n>Since each tree represents 0.05 + ½ of a pound<n>The final answer is 40 pound (or 40 lb)<n><n>Input: A and B have 35 apples, B has one more apple than A.

Choices:  A: pub B: plane C: beer D: store E: fraternity house<n>Output:		Let D be the Greek restaurant that offers fried foods as well as an assortment of beers.<n>D has 4 letters, just like pub.<n>To convert the letters to numbers, each letter gets converted to its position in the alphabet, so A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, and D = 4.<n>As a result, pub = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4= 7, so pub = A.<n>Since beer is a drink and pub is a food, we can say B is the restaurant that serves fried foods.<n>Since pub is A but beer is B, beer = pub ^ -1.<n>Substituting 7 in the formula for pub, pub = 7.<n>Using the formula for beer, beer = pub^-1 = 7^-1 = <<7^-1=0.08>>0.08, so beer = B.<n>However, fried food requires alcohol, so this answer is incomplete.<n>To find the appropriate food with alcohol, it is necessary to choose a number on the same list as pub and invert it, which is not possible if pub was the first (least significant) digit.<n>However, corey is the first (least special) digit, so we can invert corey in order to find the answer.<n>corey^-1 = <<corey^-1=0.46>>0.46<n>This means that corey is the restaurant with alcoholic drinks.<n>Since B is beer and corey is the restaurant that provides alcohol and serves fried foods, pub is the restaurant that serves non-fried foods.<n>Since the pub is A, it is a pub with a single number in the name.<n>Since there is only one number in a pub, we can substitute pub for its number 7.<n>From above, the restaurant with fried food and alcohol in the same restaurant is a pub, and a pub is called A.<n>So the restaurant with fried and alcoholic food is A, but pub means anything that has fried food and drink.<n>So A is the restaurant with alcohols and fried food.<n>Now, because of the inverse of the alphabet, there is only one pub whose initial letter is an a, and that is called A.<n>Consequently, all the letters

Choices:  A: feel cold B: feel pressure C: feel bumpy D: itches E: feel clammy<n>Output:		Let's assume D is correct. Then let x equal the length of skin pinched.<n>According to E, the length of x should be <<2x=2>>2x = 2 and should be <x=2>>x = 2. Dividing each side by two, we get <1/2x=1/2>>1/2x = 1/2, so x = <<1/2=0.5>>0.5 and should be <<2x/2=0.25>>2x/2 = 0.25<n>Dividing both to sides by x <2x/2=x>>2x/2= x, we get the final answer as <<x=0.25, x>>x = 0.22<n><n>Input:There is 139 grams in 572 milligrams. (Hint: 139 gr/572 mg)<n>Output:There is 100 grams in 139 gr/.139 gr = 100 gr<n>So the final answer as 139/100 = <<0.139=13.9>>13.9<n>

She thought that there was more string on the spool, but it slipped out of her fingers when she reached the what?. Choices:  A: child's hand B: the last straw C: hobby shop D: end of line E: toy store<n>Output:		There is probably some special circumstance that led Sally to lose the kite.<n>If she was near a child's hand, she may have yanked the string too hard while the child was holding the kite. If she was near a hobby shop, she might have yanked the kite when someone was near her, causing the kite to slip out of her hands. We don't know the exact circumstances without additional information.<n>However, the most probable answer is that Sally lost the kite because she was not careful, and her reaching the end of the string was just bad luck.<n>So the answer is D, but this answer is not definitive<n><n>

Choices:  A: playground B: mexico C: town D: outside E: world cup<n>Output:		Because a soccer field is not contained in a physical building, it must be outside. Choice A represents a playground, however the soccer field is not on a playground, but outside. Option B represents Mexico, but a physical soccer field is not a country so Mexico cannot be a choice for the soccer field. Option C represents the United States of American which is not a country and as such not a reasonable choice, unless if the soccer field was in the United States, which it is not. Choice D represents the "outside", however as stated above this does not work because the soccer field is outdoors, not out of doors, and as such a physical soccer field has to be outside. Choice E represents the world cup which does not answer the question since no physical soccer fields are contained in the world cup.<n>So the correct answer is option D: outside<n><n>Input: If a circle of radius 40 inches passes through the three coordinates (18, 23), (82, 34), and (61, 48), which location is the closest to the center of the circle?<n>Output: We can tell that the 3rd coordinate, (61, 68) is the closest to the circle.  If the circle is passing through (18, 68), then the side of the line from 18- 61 would be a square with width of 29. Now, to make the circle pass through (61,68), the circumference from 61 would be 2*perimeter, or 2*36 = 72. But since the circle is the circumference of a circle, the radius is half of the circumference. So we get pi*radius = diameter. Pi*61 is 22.5, and 61 is about 2 of the diameter. So since 22.5 is bigger than 2, the radius of the circle is about 22.5. So the answer is 61.

Sam didn't like company.  He prefered what? Choices:  A: you B: abbreviation C: solitude D: loneliness E: alone<n>Output:		 Let the words John came to see Sam and John came to see Sam be written as:   John + See+ Sam.  And let the words what John came to see Sam not be written as:  what John came to see. So the original message is John + See+ Sam ≠ what John came to see. Now consider the second half of the message. You notice that John came to see is the only thing John came to see. You consider the meaning of John and conclude that it is a person. Since we do not know much about John. You must now consider all the other words in the message. You notice Sam, see, what, and equal. Since you know that it is not John came to see equals what. Sam and See are not part of it so you discard them. What and equal are not familiar words. You can guess that what is a question or an object since one asks what or you see something "what is this" or you touch something "I touched that" So you can guess that what is actually the object is or what the person is doing or how and why or the context of what, like when, where. So what is a question, and equal must be a statement, like "John sees Sam". So it is not what John came to see = that John came to see. Therefore the second part of the message contains a positive statement on John's part that "John did come to Sam". The first half message could only be Sam did not like company or the state of the subject in the sentence is being expressed by a negative verb. This makes the first half only a negative. So you can guess equal to equal. Now consider the first half of the sentence again. And you guess that equals also means equal, since in math it is the equivalent of "is". Now you can finally guess the correct answer: Sam liked company and John did that.<n><n>So the answer is E: A:Sam liked company and B:John did that<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the next two problems below.<n><n>Input:John comes to see Sam.  Sam has 8 pencils, 6 red pencils, and 2 green pencils.

Choices:  A: injury B: death C: playing uno D: coma E: falling down<n>Output:		There are at least two ways to answer this question.<n>Option A: Injuries are much more common while death is a bit less likely, so the probability of getting badly injured is higher than the probability of death. The conditional probability of death given injury is very close to 1, because you will probably survive if you have sustained one or more serious injuries. However, not dying after being injured doesn't happen often.<n>Option B: The probability of death is very high initially but then it drops to practically zero when a person survives the fall. However, the probability of death after injury is nearly 1.<n>Option C: The probability of death after an injury is nearly 1, but then it drops almost to zero after a successful fall (death).<n>Option D: Comas are almost as unlikely as a death, but the probability of a death with any injury is practically 1.<n>Option E: The probability of death remains almost 1 after an injury, but it doesn't fall below a certain value.

Let y be the total years Michele has been alive.<n>Michele wants to multiply the two variables x and y to get the amount of days Michele has been around.<n>The multiplication of these two variables results in the quantity x*y as follows:<n>x and y together represent Michele's lifetime. Michele does not have any days in her last year of being alive by definition. The last day of her life is the last day of her final year. <n>So, x*y will result in a 0.<n>The number of days in a year is 365. Let N equal the number of years Michele has lived<n>Multiplying by N will give us the total number of days in her lifetime.<n>Combining x*y and N*N, we get x*y-2*x * N + x^2 * N^2 + 2*N<n>x^2 * N^3 + N * N^3 + 2*N * N^3 - 2*x * N * N<n>x^2 + 2 * (x+N) *N^2<n>x^2 + (2x+2N)*N^3 + N*N^3 - 2x*N^4<n>x^2 + N*N^4 + 2*N^5<n>If the final answer is x, we get (x^2 + N^4 + 2 * N^5) * (1/x) to account for the fraction of the days in her life.<n>(x^2 + N ^4 + 2* N^5)  * (1/x), which is 1/x* (x^2 + 1/x) + (1/x) * (N^4 + N^5)<n>Since 0 <= /x <= 1, the result is x^2 + x + 0 + x^2 + x<n>=> x^2 + 2x + 2x<n>or x^2 + 4x<n>We know 4

Choices:  A: insubstantial B: massless C: dwarf D: inconsequential E: good<n>Output:		<<substantial>>substantial<n><<massive>>massive<n>A and B are examples of adjectives that can modify only nouns, so <<insubstantial>>insubstantial is incorrect (unless <<insubstantinal>>insubstantinal is meant to be a different kind of adjective, and that's quite possible; however, let's stick to what we know right now).<n><<massless>>massless is incorrect because massless things can't be called massive. Likewise, <<dwarf>>dwarf is incorrect because dwarfs are quite substantial. <<Dwarf>>Dwarf is also incorrect because it's a name of a person, and not a massiveness of the building. Likewise, <<inconsequential>>inconsequential is incorrect because a building shouldn't be inconsequential for anything.<n>This leaves <<substantial>>massive as the only correct answer.<n><n>Input: The only one who can hear the sound is my sister.

Choices:  A: michigan B: map C: american city D: rest stops E: country<n>Output:		A traffic jam means that a road or highway is crowded with several vehicles which are being delayed by slow traffic in front. The cars in front keep moving, but too slowly for the cars behind to make any real progress.<n>Since the traffic is getting worse the closer you get, and traffic is on a 4 lane highway, we can look at the lane graph.<n>The graph of a general linear function that takes the values: 1,2,3,4 are of the form<n>(x0) + (kx+l) = n where n is a positive real constant, x is an unknown real variable, and 0=0 k= 4, and l = -1<n>Therefore, the traffic is on a highway that has 4 lanes, with speed increases of 2, 4, 6, & 8 in each direction.<n>Therefore, the general graph is a polynomial with degree 4 and the 4 lane highway is 2x2 + x2 + 2x4 + x4 = 16x4 + 16x2 + 2x2 =x6 to x4 and then with a constant difference that represents the speed and the function.<n>So, because the traffic is getting worse as you get closer, the constant that represents the closer the traffic is the faster it is going to get, is greater.<n>If we say x = the distance from the origin to you, then x = the distance to the rest stops.<n>So, we know: -4 < x < x = 0 < x = 20 < x = 49 where x > 0 indicates that we have moved along the horizontal axis, and that there is more than one rest stop, indicating that there is more than 1 rest stop.<n>Because x = 25, x is at its maximum and has no other rest stops to move through, the graph moves from the y = 8 to the y = 17. Thus, this indicates that the traffic starts getting worse from that moment, but when x = 25 we have one rest stop to make a complete rest stop, therefore, the time increases as the distance moves from zero to the first rest stop to the second rest stop.<n>In other words, this means  that x < 25 is where this is not your nearest rest stop, so you are in the traffic jam, but x > 25

Therefore, the answer<n>is not choice B.<n><n>Choice C:<n>There is no suicide in bye and goodby, as in the word suicide. There is also no insulting person in the word suicide to make suicidal an anagram for bye.<n>Therefore, the answer is not choice C.<n><n>Choice D:<n>There are also no gods or gods at all in the word goodbye. Therefore, the answeris not choice D.<n><n>Choice E:<n>As we can see, in the word byebye,<n>bye is in goodbye and by is in the bye.

To find a good deal, you'll need to use the formula p = p1 + p2. P stands for pajamas, while p1 stands for pajamase you and p2 stands for pajamases you think your son will wear. However, the total cost of the pajamas to you is c = t1 + t2. C stands for cost and t1 stands for the total cost you will pay for your pajamas, and t2 stands for the total cost your son will pay when he buys his pajamas. So in total, you will pay  c = t1 +t2.<n>To buy the pajamas you need, you need to find t1 + t2, solve for t2 = 2(t1 / 2). Your shopping trip will be paid for with a $100 gift card. Together you and your son will spend $15 on new pajamases. Then pj2 will be (pj1 - pj2). What is the total cost for both pajamas?<n>Output:We know that p = 5 + 5<n>C = c1 + c2<n><n>Solve for c2, so c2 = 2 * c1 / 2 = c1 / 4<n>Total cost when you and your son are buying pajamas together = C = (c1 + c2) = (15 + 2 * c1/4)<n><n>Total cost when you are buying pajama for you and your son = (15 + c1 / 4)<n>So the final total = c1/4 + c1 = 625<n><n>

Choices:  A: bowl of soup B: serving dish C: table setting D: placemat E: glass of iced tea<n>Output:		A spoon rests on a plate's surface. In the same way, a spoon goes on a plate's _surface_. Because a spoon is shaped as flat, it is designed to lie horizontally on a horizontal surface, such as the surface of a plate or bowl.<n>During this, let's look at each part of the riddle to fully understand the word play.<n>The question uses the word _side_. In this phrase, the term "side" is a prefix meaning "beside." The answer in part (C), "table setting," is the adverbial phrase that shows place. The spoon is placed beside the soup bowl, in another term _beside the bowl_. A spoon is put beside the bowl or beside the table, so when the spoon is placed beside something, it is in the same location as the other object. Because the table setting doesn't include a spoon, the spoon is placed on the plate's surface.

Choices:  A: misfortune B: fearful C: criticism D: make mistakes E: promotion appraisal<n>Output:		Let x be the amount we would receive if we had a "poor job". If we chose for instance A, then C = A - D. If we chose C, then D = C - A. Since D = C - A, we can substitute C for D and eliminate A and D. We get an equation for the amount of money received by an underperforming employee:<n><n>So, if the amount we would receive is less than <<0>>0 then our boss will fire us and if the amount received is exactly 0 our boss will promote us. The "value" of our job is thus negative as it will have a positive x-value when we are fired and a negative x-value when we receive a promotion<n><n>Input: What are the only four days of the year in which December has more than three days?<n>Output: December 31st, February 28th, November 30th and May 31st<n><n><n>Input: There are 365 days in a year.<n>If a year contains 53 weeks, how many days are in a week?<n>Output: There are 7 days in a week.<n><n>Input: How many times do you cross a country border in the shortest road trip from the Pacific coast to Niagara Falls?

Thus far, no information about this new equation is given.<n>We are given that C is an integer (not a real), and that C exists in the range of negative numbers (-5,0)) to an unspecified positive number (all positive positive numbers from <100). Now we can simplify (50 + 2 C) in both cases to only those numbers, and we obtain: 50 + 40 (1,99,99,9100) + 2 C (0 = C1 < 2 C1 < 1001).<n>The second equation (50 c1 + 40C22) should give an equation for the total number (C) of all chairs in both buildings.<n>Once we know the total number of chairs (>5) in both buildings, we can solve (2C1 - C2) for C2, leaving only the second building to be solved as an integer-only problem.<n>This should give us the number of chairs for the second building, so we can solve for C and get the new equation given by (C - 5) (>

The choices are birth, presents, propagation and fun. We see that all of the options except birth are a reference to the process of reproducing, and birth is not a result of this process but an event that can happen, therefore we choose birth.<n><n>Input: There's a lot to giving birth, but it begins and ends with something very special. Choices:  A : overpopulation B : birth C : presents D : propagation E : fun<n>Output: The purpose of birth, then, should begin and end with what. The only choice that is not referring to a product of reproduction is beginning and end? The choices are fun, propagaation, birth, presents and overpopulation. We know that every option except for propagaation is a result of reproducing, so the choice must be propagaation.<n><n>Input: It's all over the place, which direction is it going in?

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input:Where would you get a contraceptive if you do not have one? Choices:  A: health center B: vagina C: emergency room D: drawer E: medicine cabinet<n>Output:		A: Choice A (health center) is incorrect because a contraceptive means that a person is protected from becoming pregnant or causing a pregnancy. A contraceptive only prevents against pregnancy, and therefore, it cannot be in your vagina.<n>B: Choice B (vagina) is incorrect because vagina does not hold condoms or other forms of contraceptives. It is an organ on the inside of a female human’s body.<n>C: Choice C (emergency room) is incorrect because emergency rooms do not store contraceptives, unless they are necessary to help women in the ER.<n>D: Choice D (drawer) is incorrect because there is no place in a drawer that stores contraceptive measures. Dressers and drawers hold clothing.<n>E: Choice E (medicine cabinet) is false because although the medicine cabinet does hold medicines, it also holds other important medical supplies, as well as a mirror, and personal care products. Contraceptives are not needed, nor stored on medicine cabinets.<n>So the final answers is E: emergency room<n><n>Input: If you have one apple, and you divide it equally between three people, how many apples will each person get? Choices: A: one apple divided evenly between three people yields one apple each. B: the ratio of 1:1:1:1 does not represent even division.<n>Output: In choice A, you state that that each person gets one apple when you have one apple and divide it equally between three other people. The answer is incorrect because that would mean each person gets 1/3rd of an apple.<n>In choice B: since the number 1:1:2 appears unequal, you assume it means that 1=1 and 2=2. That makes no sense, and it is therefore incorrect.<n>The correct choice is A: one apple divided equally between three other people yields one apple each<n>So the final answer should be A: one apple divided equaly between 3 other people yields one apple for each<n><n>Input:Alice has 38 friends at school, and 28 go to UCI. 17 of those students are sophomores. 12 of the 17 sophomores are first name Mike, 7 of which go to UCI.

It could vary from person to person, however, it depends on one's perspective and circumstances.<n>Some individuals may see suicide as a solution to their problems, particularly when they see no other alternative.<n>They may believe they are no longer able to cope with their problems, rather than face the reality of the situation, and rather than be able to change their situation, they decide to end the pain they are experiencing.<n>Others might view suicide as the right selection if their circumstances are such that the only other alternative to end their suffering is to continue in an unhealthy relationship.<n>If they can't get support from a loved one or support group, they might consider suicide as an option to leave an unhealthy situation.<n>While there is no right answer, I think the man could have done it for many reasons, just because the reason that he was lonely didn't help much. He could not do it for his mental health and he could do it for many people who are unable to live, not for mental health alone can do suicide.<n><n>### Explanation of solution:<n><n>### 1) Tapanga and Core, How many candies have<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the Tapanga and Core.

If my problem is bored, I will probably lose interest in playing chess quickly. Crossword puzzles take relatively little concentration and can keep me occupied even if I do not feel like playing chess. Art shows require a great deal of observation, and therefore are not a good choice if I am bored. Grocery shopping requires me to be paying attention and following rules about what to buy, which makes grocery shopping unsuitable for someone who is bored.<n>So the final choice is C<n><n>Input: How many students are in Mr. Johnson's class?<n>If there are 12 students in Mrs. Davenport's class, what is 1.7 * 12 rounded to 2 decimal places?<n>Output: The number 1.7 is between 1.8 and 1.6<n>Rounding, there are 1.6 and 1.8 decimals, so I get 1.7<n>So the final choice in 1.7<n>

Choices:  A: pet the dog B: hear sounds C: have sex D: reproduce E: drive cars<n>Output:		Let's think of each choice in terms of stimulating dogs to breed. When given A, the dog gets a good scratching, so it's pleased but not stimulated to breed. Thus, when exposed to A, the dog does not reproduce.<n>When given B, the dog is given noises to hear sounds. So the dog isn't as pleased as when it receives A, yet it's still pleased enough to begin reproducing. However, when the dog hears lots of noise, it quickly becomes overstimulated. Hence, the dog reproduces less when exposed to B.<n><n>Finally, when given C, the dog hears sounds and has sex, so it is perfectly pleased to reproduce. As such C is the optimum choice for dogs, so it is the most likely choice they will actually make.<n><n>Since each human has a dog, and each dog will reproduce when exposed to C, humans will also reproduce.<n>So the final choice is C<n><n>Input: 21 people play a game where each player places a coin on the table and bets on a coin toss.

A grocery store wouldn't serve as a way to carry out potatoes because you might put them on the shelves, then take them home with you to eat with the other foods in your refrigerator.<n>B) A grocery bag is a way to carry a lot of potatoes home from a grocery store. A grocery bag makes sense because you can store them and you don't have to put them on display at the store.<n>C) A restaurant is a place that cooks food for you, like at a fast food restaurant such as McDonald's. You carry potatoes to a restaurant to eat them there.<n>D) A farmer's market is a place where you can buy locally grown fruits and vegetables. A farmer's might not serve as a way to take potatoes away because in it's a market where farmers sell the potatoes that they grew.<n>E) A bushel basket could be carried in the store to carry potatoes, but it wouldn't make sense to keep the potatoes in the store because that means you have to make the potatoes yourself and keep them to yourself.<n><n><n><n>

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input:Where are you likely to find a paper program? Choices:  A: theater B: computer C: opera D: television E: concert<n>Output:		According to Google, a "program" is "a series of acts or performances forming part of an entertainment or entertainments". Therefore, an "opera" is a performance. Since this question asks "where you are likely to find a paper," a program at the opera is the most likely to be on paper, while the program for a concert is more likely to be on a computer, since programs for concerts are often not posted to give advance notice of which artists will be performing.<n>The answer is therefore E.<n><n>Input:The first line contains a single integer n, the dimension of the cube.<n>The next 2n lines describe the cube.<n>For each line, the two integers v x y correspond to a vertex in the cube marked with vertex signs v and x, and y (the edge connecting them).<n>Output:  You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices 1...n and n(2n-1)/2 edges. If we are traversing the graph in increasing order of the vertex number, starting with the smallest numbered vertex, then every edge we encounter corresponds with one of the n lines in the input (the line we read immediately preceding the encounter). Because the input contains no duplicate edges, each corresponding edge has a unique identifier.<n>The identifier for each edge is given by the line containing the edge. Note that 1...n appear only once as the identifier of the edge corresponding with each line.<n>The identifier for the first edge is therefore 1, and for the final edge of the graph, the last line of our input, we have the identifier n.<n>If we consider the identifier to be the name of an edge, this representation allows us to treat the graph as an adjacency matrix rather than a directed graph, since each position indicates whether there is an edge between adjacent numbers, and each value in a position indicates the number of such edges.<n><n><n>The first input line gives the number n, corresponding to the number of edges. The second line gives the dimensions of the two-dimensional lattice corresponding to this graph. The third line gives coordinates for <n><n>Input:We are given two integer arrays "A" and "B" both of size N.<n>For each element of "A", if it appears in the "B", then it is incremented by 1, otherwise zero is placed.<n>Output: We can use brute force to check all the elements of the A[] to see if they appear

Choices:  A: airport B: gotham city C: london D: city E: gas stations<n>Output:		Let x be the number of people who take a telephone booth while traveling by plane to london for business.<n>Since all business travelers call from the airport, x = 100% of Business travelers calling from the airport.<n>However, we don't know the percentage of gas station/london travelers, only that their is a gas station somewhere on the way there.<n>This means that x + 0.4 = 100%, so the number of people calling from the gas station is <<x+0.4=100%>>100%<n>Let y be the number of people traveling across the bridge between new york and new-jersey.<n>Since only 5% of new york travelers can reach the telephone booth without driving 20km, y + 0.05 = 100%.<n>This means that y = 1000 - 20 = <<10-0.05=100%> >100%. Also, y > <-1000/2=125%>125 percent.<n>Subtracting the number of air travelers from the number of total people traveling, we find that x - y = <<100-1000=0>>0.<n>So the final number of people calling from London with a telephone booth is x = <<100=2>>2<n><n><n><n>Input: John is working on his computer and accidentally breaks it.

At first, the temperature is T = <<10=10>> degrees. Five minutes later, the temperature of the chocolate cake has decreased by 2 degrees. At this time, the temperature of the cake is T = <<5=25>> degrees. Three more minutes later, the temperature decreases by 1 more degree. After a total of 20 minutes, the cake has cooled down to T = <<20=43>> degrees. Find the rate at which the temperature is decreasing starting at 10 degrees.<n>Output:We have the information we need to solve this problem without any math. First, we can find the rate of change of the temperature of the c<n>ake. The difference between any two temperatures of the cake is 2 degrees, which is equal to the cusp. The cusp is always equal to the total temperature divided by the total time. The total time in this problem is 20 minutes, which also equals to the total cake temperature, which is divided by 2, giving us 11. The cusp for the first temperature is, for example, 2 (T<n>= <<10=1>>). The second temperature is 2(T=<<5=25>>). By repeating the process, we can also find out where the cake cusped between 10 degrees and 20 degrees.<n><n>Input: The population of a city is 400,000.

He loved the idea of going to mars, and reads books about it all the time.   He dreams of being on what? Choices:  A: love B: zoo C: school D: space shuttle E: library<n>Output:		Let x be the number of times James thinks about Mars each day.<n>0 ≤ x ≤ <<∞>>0 ≤ x ≥ ∞<n>He reads books about Mars 85% of the time he thinks about Mars, so the fraction of the time James thinks about Mars that's not wasted is (1 - (1.00-00/x)) * x, which works out to 1.0x. So let y be the fraction of his thoughts about Mars that isn't wasted. Since james reads 85% of his thoughts, we want x to be 1.05, and since y must be less than x, 0.85 < x ≤ 1.00, so we want <0.9x=1-0.05x>x ≤ 1.9<n>Combining these inequalities gives 2x ≤ 4/9<n>As x = (infinity − 2)/9, x ≥ 16⁄9<n>Since the fraction isn't wasted isn't part of the total number of thoughts about Mars, we can simply let y = x.<n><n><n>1 ≤ x ≤ 16⁄9.<n>Since 45 + 41 = <<45+41=86>>86, the fraction of each thought not wasted is (86/9)−1, which is 0.15<n>So the final answer should be 15%<n>

Because of this, john is very careful about the places he goes.  Where might he avoid going? Choices:  A: pet store B: parking lot C: woodland D: north america E: park<n>Output:		John may be afraid of a pet store because he is fearful of an abused animal.  John might also be afraid of the parking lot because there is a chance he might see an animal get hit by a vehicle. John might also be afraid to go into the woodlands again because he heard there was a serial animal killer  in the area.  Maybe John will go to a park only because there are a lot of people there and he will be less likely to see an animal get hurt.  The last choice might be the most likely place for John to be afraid to go.<n>So the final choice might be park.<n><n>Input:What is the total number of candles in a package of 9 birthday candles.<n>Output: Let x be the total number of birthday candles in a package. x = 9 is the total number of birthdays in a package.<n>We want x to equal the total number of candels, which is x + 9.<n>By dividing both sides by 9, we should find the answer in the form 2* 5 = 10.<n>So x = <<2*10=10>>20<n>So there are 10 birthday candels in a package.<n><n>Input:The equation to find the total cost is to add up the cost of the first meal plus whatever you pay per meal thereafter. What is the total cost of buying nine meals ($1.50 per meal) from the same food place?<n>Output:The total cost of buying 9 meals ($1.45 per meal) from that same food place = <<145>>1.45. The total number of the food place's meals = 9. The formula for the equation to find the total amount of money that you will buy is 1.50 + x = 0.45. Once you find the total amount of meals, you can find the total amount of dollars equal to the formula of the total amount + x. The formula for total cost of buying meals x times 1.50 is the total cost of meals x * 1.50. For example, to find the price of 2 meals, you would add the cost of a total meal plus the cost for 1.5 meal times the cost of a meal. By doing this you

He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input:Some might say that if you want to do something that results in changing society then you need to start from within, to do this what would you be doing? Choices:  A: riots B: vote C: change yourself D: social activism E: change clothes<n>Output:		Riots, social activism, and change yourself are all ways to attempt to change society. However, voting is not.<n>So the answer is Riots, Social Activism, and Change Yourself<n><n>Input: This game is really hard. Maybe there is an easier game like: Guess a number between 1 and 1 000. You try by choosing a random number, if the number matches the answer to be the highest. Your first try is free. If not you pay 0,01 dollar. The game continues like this until your account has no money left. That would be very annoying. I can see there are at least 370 ways to win this game so what is the probability to win it with exactly 370 tries?<n>Output:We can model this game by the random variables N1, N2,...., N1000 which represent the number you guess that is too low, the number you guess that matches, and the number you guess that you guess too high, respectively. Our event of interest is the event that occurs (N3 > 370). We need to use the conditional probability distribution and our tree diagram in order to calculate for this event.<n><n>Input: We are trying to identify the age of our friends.

The only way for her to meet Jake or Charlie is to go to New Hampshire, but that will not be in Texas or in the farm.<n>Because of that, the only correct answer left is farm<n><n>Input:You can only write in capitals.You can put in numbers but there is a rule. When you add a number to another number, you have to make it an odd number. If you are in a situation where you have a number you can't add to, you have to find 49. If someone gives you a number from 1 to 196, you can't write the number and you have to subtract 49  you can only subtract 49 one time to get the answer. Choices: D: ANSWER<n>Output: The rule is when you get any number under 50, you have to reduce it by 49. When you get a number under 50 that is not 1 to 10, you have to put the number and subtract 49. To get 0, you only have to subtract 48 2 times. Any other solution will not work the next way you get to 0, let's say you get -1, then add 50 then subtract and you can't get to 0 anymore. <n>Because the only way to get to 0 is by subtracting

Marcelin published it at **_the very beginning_** of a journey by ship from the city of **Madrid****,** Spain, **_to his homeland_** **F***e** France, where he would die of a** _disease_** **. His book is called** _* The Complete Mathematician *_**_ **. The Complete Mathematician is an essay with which to teach** _* math*_ **to someone who** knows **very little of it.** **He writes that he has made two assumptions about his reader: that **he has never studied math** and that he wants to know only the necessary elements to be an educated person. He** **_thinks_** **that **to be able to do arithmetic is more than enough for people to live comfortable lives**. He then proceeds to give the reader **_some essential arithmetic_**.<n><n>What is a sentence in which something is described as being like something else<n><n>Output:<n>An **essential arithmetic** is a **sentence** in which something is described **as being **like **something else.

They had come to the reception too.  After talking to her friends for a bit, Sophie decided it was time to see the art.  Sophie joined the people who were looking at the paintings, which were hung and placed neatly on the walls.  Sophie began to look at some of the paintings. One of Sophie’s friends came up to her and said “Hey, Sophie, I love painting, my mom is an artist you should check out this painting.  The painting was not even hung up on the wall, it was leaning against a pillar.  Sophie went over to the pillar to see the painting. As she approached the painter showed her the painting. Sophie loved the painting, she wanted to take it with her, so she asked her friend about buying it.  Her friend told Sophie that they couldn’t buy it, and she explained why.

Sophie wanted to know more about the pricing of the art gallery so she asked her friend how the gallery determined the price.  Her friend explained that it takes the artist, the materials, the work put in, the time it took to make the piece of art, the market, and many other factors into consideration when they determine the price to put on a piece of art

However, we also are aware that we must not get overly confident about our feeling, and so we have to take the possibility of being B (= tired), C (all day), or D (very tired) as all three being possibilities. However, this means that we are not allowed to make a choice (therefore B(Tired), C (all day) and D (very tired) could all be eliminated), which would mean that we must not be able to feel better (therefore E (feel worse) could be eliminated), which means that we either must be B (= tired) or C (= all day).<n>The final answer is B (tired)<n>

Choices:  A: drinkable B: junk food C: medicine D: antidote E: nutrient<n>Output:		A, B and D are choices for substances. Choosing junk food is wrong because Sarah does not eat junk food. The poison was not an antidote since it killed her. Choosing E is wrong since nutrients make you heal. The correct answer is C since the poison was a toxin. A is wrong because it was not drinkable. B is wrong because it was medicine. D is wrong because the poison killed her. E is wrong because the poison was not a nutrient. Sarah believed the substance to be poison but she did not know if it was a poison, toxin, poisonous substance or poison. Sarah believed that it was an antidote because antidotes make you stay alive but it killed her and made her dead. Choosing all of the other answers is incorrect because Sarah did not eat them or drink them but she was deceived into thinking that it was a drink, junk food, medicine and a nutrient before she died.<n>Sarah did not ingest the poison before she died but before. It is important to know if your substance is harmful or not.

The students take turns picking two numbers. Player 1 picks a pair of numbers for team A. If the sum of the pair of numbers is less than 10, one point is awarded to A. Player 2 can then pick a pair of numbers. The game continues, so that each player picks two numbers until both teams have no pair of numbers left on the board. Team A's point total is the total number of pairs of numbers that they were able to pick in a turn. Team B's point total is one point less than each of team A's points. However, if team B's points are smaller than team A, team B receives one additional point and its score is the same as team A. If both players picked a pair of numbers that summed to 10 or less, then the teams receive 1 point.<n>Output: For this task, let P be the sum of the first pair of numbers,<n>let Q be the sum of the second pair of numbers.<n>If P<10 and Q<10, Team A's score = 1 + the sum of the first two numbers<n>If Q<10, then Team B's score = (10 + Q).<n>If Q>10, then Team A's score is the sum of Q.<n>If P>10, then P-Q is Team B's score.<n>If P=Q, then the Pair's score = 0.<n>If P<Q, then the Pairs' score is the difference: If P<Q,<n>then P-Q is Team A's score<n>The sum of the two numbers can only be 10 or less.  So Team B only gets one additional point if Team A

Choices:  A: pharmacy B: person C: drugstore D: bedroom E: mcdonalds<n>Output:		A choice: a: This would depend on where you are and what state/city you are located in. In general, a woman in the United States can access birth control without a prescription from an advanced health care practitioner, like a nurse or a physician's assistant. (ref: https://www.womenshealth.gov/healthy-living/birth-control/birth-control-methods-overview/other-birth-control-barrier-methods)<n>b: For most birth control devices (condoms, vaginal rings, spermicide) are available without a prescription or doctor visit. The only exception to this is birth control like the birth control patch and the NuvaRing which must be prescribed by a doctor.<n>c: No one can sell birth control devices in their pharmacies without a prescription. Birth control in drugstores is controlled by the FDA. For women who can get a prescription, their doctor can give them prescription forms that they can fill out at the local drugstore. The drugstore can give them the birth control then. A woman who does not have a doctor can get a birth control prescription at the drug store but cannot get it filled because they do not have a prescription. A woman must fill out her own birth control prescription and then take it to a pharmaciest who will fill it and charge her a co-pay.<n>d: Birth control that cannot be purchased over the counter can be accessed through online mail order (e.g., buying pills online) as well as through medical doctors if she have health insurance.<n>e: Birth control devices, including pills and other hormonal methods, are not sold in McDonald's. McDonald's sells hamburgers and fast food. Birth control cannot be found in a restaurant.<n>So the final answers are A, c, and e<n>

Choices:  A: residential neighborhood B: community C: building D: prague E: every city<n>Output:		<n>A school is most likely not located in a residential neighborhood, because residential neighborhoods are not where schools are likely to be found.<n>A residential neighborhood contains mostly houses, and is usually close to a community. A prague is part of the community, so a prague is not the most likely spot for a school to be found either.<n>However, a community is part of a bigger neighborhood, so a community could be located in many places. For example, it could be located in a prague. Another spot for a school would be a building.<n>In the city of Chicago, there are over thousands of buildings. There are over 900 pragues, and over 200 community buildings/centers. <n>There are 4 city neighborhoods: Loop, Bridgeport, West Garfield Park, and Near West Side. The first 3 contain thousands of buildings, and each has a community center neighborhood. However, the near west side is not residential, and doesn't have a community center to call itself the fourth neighborhood.<n>Loop is a very busy business district, while the bridgeport is a small, mostly poor blue collar.<n>Both are located within the main city, and have lots of other neighborhoods within them.

Choices:  A: airplane B: ship's hold C: boat D: truck E: train<n>Output:		The fastest method for moving cargo is by ship's hold. The ship takes 5 days to travel from Mexico to Canada. For comparison, in a plane, a flight from Mexico to Canada takes 6 days. Trucking would not be very advantageous, as a truck can only travel as far as the boat would be able to within 5 days (about 100 km or 100,000 m). Boats can carry way more cargo per unit weight than trucks and planes. The cargo of a boat is also less expensive than the cargo of plane or truck due to having to maintain the equipment. For example, the cargo of a plane is considerably heavier due to the fuel it burns (around 34,000 lbs per flight), and the ship carries all of its cargo on its sides and underwater, which requires that they be secured more than cargo being carried by a plane.

Choices:  A: determination B: upper hand C: superior D: higher position E: skill<n>Output:		The solution is E.<n><n>Input: A: Let n=the number of letters. For each letter, there is 1 word that has the letter as its first letter. We'll call that letter 'index one'. For each letter, 1 word has the letter as second letter. We'll write that as index 2, and so on. So there are n letters. There are n words, because each of the n letters is the first letter of 1 word, and that is included in the word, of course. The word with n letters is index n itself. So we have n words.<n>B: Let n=number of letters. For each word, there is 1 letter that appears as the first letter. We're interested in finding that letter. So we'll divide the n words into n groups, each containing one word, where the word in group i has the letter as index i. It's a bit more intuitive when we draw it: <n><n>C: Let n=number. There are 26 letters. For each letter in the alphabet, divide letters n times into groups. Each group contains one letter.<n>D: I think A or B are more correct but I'll say D to be on the safe side.<n><n>Input:12 and 48 are factors of each of the three numbers: 24, 28, and 32. The only way to determine<n>whether 24, 32, and 28 have one and the same number of factors in common is to<n>(1) perform that procedure for 24 and 32, and<n>(2) calculate the ratio of the number of factors they have in common to the product of<n>their greatest common divisor and their least common multiple. Is that solution<n>correct?<n><n>Output:I am guessing the solution to this question is no. The only way to check that number is wrong is to go through the process of dividing the number you are given by each of the number you are given. According to the solution, 12, 48, and 80 have the same number of factors. It is possible to find factor pairs but I have found it impossible to do so in less than three iterations.<n><n>Input: I think you are supposed to start by dividing the original number 2348 by the number you are<n>consulting,

If the total number of children were twice that of infant boys and girls, how many children were there?<n>Output: A. The total number of children is twice that of infant boys & girls. This implies that the remaining children must not be infants (otherwise there would be infinite children).<n>Therefore, there are 1 + Infant Boys + Infant Girls = 2^2 * Children. <n>Additionally, the total (adult women - adult men) = Infants Boys + Infants Girls. So Adult Women + Adult Men = Infants Boys + 2^2 * Infant Girls + Adult Women + Advert Men - Infants Boys - Infant Girls = 350.<n>Therefore, you have 350 + Infants Boys + Infant Girls + 2^2* Children.<n>Hence Children = (351 - Infants Boys - 2^2 *Infant Girls)<n>Children = (351-78)<n>Children = 273.<n>So answer is 273<n>

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes.

Choices:  A: conference B: theater C: building D: floor E: church<n>Output:		The answer is choice letter: Building<n>Explanation:Conference or theater are also in a building so it is not really an option.Building is the answer because if you go to a conference or a theater you are sitting next to people but if you go to a building the chairs are separated and you are facing the same direction, so it's not true that building means the chairs are in every side of the room.<n><n>Input:How many times more does one cup weigh than a teaspoon? Choices: 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 times<n>Output:In this case the answer should be more number of cups than teaspons.<n>Explanation:1 time is the smallest choice, so the answer should be bigger than 1 time(one time for a cup and two times for a teaspoon) and we can see that three times is larger than two times. If it was one more choice larger we could say two more times, three times bigger than one time would be two times of three. And we can say the answer is more than three times(three more times) but we have two times more than one time(the same for teaspoon) that's why the answer is more than two times.<n><n>Input:Choose which sentence has a spelling mistake that you can fix.

Therefore y has not yet left its position or yet entered its position. So if x = y, it may be that at least one of them is not a thing in a place. This gives us the following:<n>If x = y, then<n>1) x is not an object, in a place.<n>2) y is not an object, but does not equal x<n>Therefore we can replace x = y in the original equation by x = ( not x) which tells us that y = (not x) which may very well be true<n>We can conclude that y may very well be sitting in a bowl of water for extended periods<n>Therefore: "C" is the correct answer<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the multiple choice questions.<n><n>If the only digits in the given number are 0, 1, 2, and 5, then what is 2530490?<n><n>A. 25<n>B. 250<n>C. 2500<n>D. 25

So, the next is 4 cups, but 4 cups are not a "no cup", so the statement "he wants to get" is incorrect, once again. So, we get two cups, which the answer is a correct representation of "he wants to get."<n><n>Input: How much do i give this guy?

Choices:  A: drawer B: back to its owner C: police station D: crime scene E: holster<n>Output:		The witness was a criminal who is in jail where he won`t come to testify about this.<n>Therefore, the investigator can send the gun information to police station.<n>The correct choice is A<n><n>Input: A group of 6 friends at a restaurant paid $61 in bill. The price for each friend is as follows: Mary paid $36, John and Jane paid $20, and the rest paid $15. The total from the bill is the same as the sum of the prices except for $5.<n>Output: Here, we want to determine the value of the hidden 5. So, we add the total of the prices except for 5, and the result is $136. So, add $5 to each payment except $36, and the result will be $141.<n>Now, if we subtract the values $141 from $136, we will conclude that the difference is $5. Thus, $141-$142 = -1 <== -1==> 5. So we answer that the difference to the total is 5.<n><n>Input: The first step to solve this question is to create a table that shows four different prices and four different items by adding up all the prices and items.<n><n>Output: First, we can see there are 4 items in the table, because all the columns are added. However, we also see there are 4 prices, because all the rows are added.<n><n>Now, since we know that there are exactly four different items, and exactly four different prices, we can see that there could only be three different numbers in the total items, and there could be only three different numbers in the prices, as well.<n><n>So, we subtract three from the number of total items, and the result is 1.<n><n>We also subtract three from the number in column 'price', and the result is 0.<n><n>Next, we do the same again for the number of items and the price, except this time we subtract three again. In column 'item', we subtract three from the price, and we subtract 6 from the item, and the resulting difference is 3. In column 'price', we subtract three from 'item', and we subtract 9 from 'price', and the resulting difference is -6.<n><n>Therefore, 3-6 = -3 <== -3==

What tool should I use to fix this? Choices:  A: humidifier B: surface of earth C: skating rink D: ice cube E: burn it to the ground<n>Output:		I could use a humidifier to add water vapor into the air, if I want to increase the amount of water vapor that is in the surrounding area. However, I have other options. A surface of the earth is composed mainly of rock, which is water-resistant and does not contain much water. Surfaces of the earth are not recommended because they can't absorb water from the atmosphere. A skating rink is a shallow area of water, which has a small surface-to-area ratio and a small surface-to water ratio. It is not an effective way to fix a dry house because it just doesn't contain enough water to fix my house. Burning the house to the ground may work if the fire is small enough and in a contained area (but not much else). An ice cube, on the other hand, is not enough to give me all the water I want. Because it is just a small area of water, I will have to buy more ice cubes and make multiple ice cubes to make enough water to fix my dry house. So the final answer is C<n><n>Input: There is a 2 inch square hole in the center of a 9 inch circle.

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input:If there is a stale smell in the air coming from the kitchen, what should one check for the source of the smell? Choices:  A: bathroom B: house C: cupboard D: space shuttle E: surface of earth<n>Output:		If there is a stale odor in the air from the kitchen, then this is the same as a stale odor from an open space. The space we are in (the kitchen) is open. So what is causing the odor is what the open space has in it. Most likely, this odor is coming from an open bin of rotting food. However, the house, bathroom, cupboard and surface of earth are all closed spaces. As a result, they cannot let odors out.<n><n>Input: If you have 5 apples, and you want to take only 2 apples without wasting any, how many different ways can you do it:<n>A: 3 apples (3 = 3! = 3 x 2 x 1 = 6 Ways)<n><n>B: 12 apples (6! = 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 = 720 Ways)<n><n>C: 9 apples (4! = 4 x 3 = 6 Ways, 3 = 3 Ways)<n><n>D: 25 apples (6! / 4! = 720 / 6 = 120 Ways) Choose 6!

A plane must make an abrupt stop, which is the purpose of a crash.<n>Hence, options A, C, and D are ruled out. We have to choose between B and E.<n>I will choose B first (Living). There are various reasons given. B stands for airplanes so airplanes can only carry living things, not passengers.<n>If the living include animals, that is not possible either. In this case, animals are usually carried by shipping. This option can be eliminated.

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input:The man tried to run, but he could not. He could that he could only move by doing what? Choices:  A: stand B: go quickly C: walking D: stand still E: walk slowly<n>Output:		Option A) A single man could not run, but he could try to walk quickly or stand.<n>Option B) Only a group of men could stand.<n>Option C) The man cannot walk slowly and walk quickly at the same time.<n>Option D) A single man cannot walk quickly.<n>Option E) A single man cannot stop running at a time.<n>So the final anwser is C<n><n>Input: You need to do some exercises on the beach next summer. The beach is made up of 1000 meters and 1 square meter of beach can hold one person. How many times that many people will fit onto the beach if everyone stands side by side?<n>Output: We know that a meter is equal to 100 centimeters, a thousand is equal to 1,000, and a square is equal to 1 x 1. You can think of the problem in terms of meters.<n>We know that the total area of beach is given by 1000, which can be seen as 1000 centimeters.<n>We want to calculate how much area the beach can fit so we can determine how many square meters it can fit.<n>Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we note that if each person is 100 centimeter tall, then each person is 1 square meter.<n>We want to find how many people can fit on the beach.<n>Therefore, we can use the area formula. We can multiply the width by the length to find out how many square meters can be fit.<n>Since each person is 1 meter long we can find the area by taking the width. Since the width is equal to 1 square meter, we get 1 x 1 = <<1 x 1=1>>1<n><n>Input: Two friends walked on the grass on a beach. The beach is 100.4 centimeters in width. Each person uses 1 square centimeter. How many total squares of grass were there on the beach?<n>Output: To first solve this problem, we need to divide the width of the beach by the area of the grass that each person uses to find the total number of grass that each person uses.<n>Divide the 100.34 centimeters in the width by 1 centimeter to find the number of people that can use 1 centimeter on the beach in 100 cent

Choices:  A: fridge B: limejuice C: square D: gym E: refrigerator<n>Output:		To answer this question, we need to eliminate the other options, starting from A. Since A = fridge does not describe a place at which you can drink at a juicebar, we eliminate A. We then must decide whether B, C, D, or E = juicebar. B and E = juicebar do not describe a place where you can get in shape, so these must be eliminated. Now we must answer whether C, D, or B describe a place where we can get in shape. If B = gym, then it does not describe a place where we drink(we do not know if gyms have bars or not) so we eliminate B. We also cannot answer D = square, because that does not describe a place that serves juice. Therefore, we are left with the only non-eliminated option: C = limejuice. Therefore, the only place you can get in shape and drink juice is at a limejuice bar.<n>So the final option is "C" - Limejuice<n><n>Input: How should you greet a friend in person if you have met several times before?  Choices:  A. Hello  B. Hey  C. Hello again  D. Hey there <n>Output: First, eliminate the choices that do not correspond to a greeting.<n>C = Hello again cannot match a choice because it is a description of a greeting.<n>D = Hey there cannot match a choice because the choices are all greetings, but Hey There is not a greeting.<n>Having eliminated choices D and C, the other choices are all greeting choices. Now, answer whether choice B = hey contains a greeting. We know that hey is used in greetings, but it does not contain a greeting if it is not capitalized. We see that hey is capitalized, so we know choice B = hey does not contain a greating.<n>Finally we are left with A and B. If A = hello does not match B = hey, then A and B must be of different types in order to get a match. We are given:<n>A = Hello<n>B = Hello<n>Choice A represents a greeting while choice B represents a general description of a person. Therefore, the final answer is "B" - "Hey"<n><n>Input: What are the only two months in which both the 2

During these six games, a player must win by having two more game points than the other player. What is the highest number of points in a match?<n>Output: A set in tennis is made up of 6 games. So in a set, a player wins by winning by 2 more points than the other player (e.g., 3-1).<n>In a match, there can be more than one set. Each set is played to 6 games, so the total number of points in a single match is the number of points in a set multiplied by the number of sets played in the match.<n>The highest number of points is ((6) * ((6) = <<6*(6)=36>>36. Since tennis sets are usually played to 6, the higher number is to say at least 36.<n>So the final number is 36<n><n><n>

C's are hotels, but B's are motels, so motel is not what you wait for. B is what you wait in a motel, but not a reception area, so motel is the wrong answer. E is an office, and that is what you wait in for a meeting. D is a law firm, and that is what a lawyer waits in for a meeting. So the answer is office<n>* <n>Input: A number has a value of 248. What is the name of the number? Choices: A: two hundred forty eight B: two hundred forty eight C: twenty four eighty D: twenty four eighty E: two four eighty<n>Output: Let's first think through what the number has to be. A four is a 4, an eight is a 8, so four and eight added together is 12, which is not 248. So it is neither two hundred forty eight nor two hundred forty eight. Next we'll look at two four eighty. Let's add the two and four and the eight and zero, leaving a one. It is indeed four plus eight, but the 4 comes after the 8, which is why this is wrong. So the number can't be either two four or four eight.<n>That was two hundred forty eight, which means it is neither two hundred fourty nor four eighty.<n>Four thousand eighty is not either two hundred and forty or four eighty. Instead, it is four and eighty.<n>Twenty-four hundred and eighty is not either twenty-four hundred and forty or twenty-four hundred and eight. It combines the parts of two hundred and forty and eight hundred and eight into the same order as in four thousand eight hundred. So twenty-four hundred and twenty-four eighty is the only way to spell it. Now we have to be more picky.<n>So what number is twenty four hundred and eighty? It can be two four hundred and eighty or four- eighty eight. It isn't four thousand eight hundred and twenty-four because that is five digits in length. So what would we do if we were asked "What is the name of the four-eighty eight?<n>Let's look at four. It isn

Choices:  A: guilty conscience B: fear C: go free D: problems E: find god<n>Output:		If one person confesses to committing murders, it makes sense that that person would have a guilty conscience. Fear of punishment and/or guilt are generally good reasons to confess one's sins. Similarly, it makes sense that a person who gets caught committing a crime would have a guilty conscience, too.<n>It does not, however, make sense that a person who was falsely accused of committing murder would confess to the actual murderer. To confess to murdering someone else, one must have the intent to murder. Thus, innocent people cannot murder for the sake of finding out the truth. Since they already know they are innocent, confessing to someone whom they know to be murder would be illogical.<n><n>### Code-along<n><n>#### Part 1: <n>#### First, create a text file named "corey.txt" in your folder with the following:<n>```<n>I have 29 candies<n>```<n>### Code (using the `reedsolomon_utils.py` to do some work):<n>```python<n>candies = 0<n>data = []<n>with open(sys.argv[2], 'r') as f:  <n>        data = f.read()<n><n># first two bytes are the number of candies<n>candies = data[0:2]<n><n>candies_int = int(candies)<n><n>data = data[2:]<n><n># split over spaces<n>strsplit = data.split()<n>    <n>for i in range(len(strsplit)):<n>    if (i >=5):<n>            candies = candies-8<n>            candies_int = int (candies_int-t<n>            strsplit[i])<n>    else:<n>            candies_2 = candies_int+strsplit[i]<n>            candies = str(candies_2)<n><n>with open("candies.txt", "w") as newfile:<n>    newfile.write(str(candies))<n>``` <n><n>#### Part 2: <n><n>```python<n><n># local calls<n><n><n># local calls cost 5 c/minute<n># remote call s cost 25 c/minute <n><n>total_cost_remote = 25 * 2<n><n>a,

Choices:  A: kept at accountant B: purse C: desk drawer D: bank E: keeping track of expenses<n>Output:		We know that since you are leaving, and you don't need to bring the account book with you, you would put it in one of two places: you would either put it in the bank, so you could easily access your records later, or you would keep it in your purse for accessibility.<n><n>In the bank, we would put the book in a safe place, where it would be kept securely. One way that we could access this place would be to use a bank vault. This vault would store the book in a private area of the bank, where only bank employees that have security clearance could enter. Since the bank is a large institution, we could keep the book in one vault, but there are thousands of vaults all over the world. The book could also be stored in a very large strong-box in the bank, called a safe. A good solution here is to place the safe in an area of the bank that would be inaccessible to potential robbers, such as inside the manager's office, and keep valuable resources on the staff behind closed doors.<n>In the private place of the bank, we would use security guards to make sure that anyone who tries to access the safe is qualified or has legitimate business. This way, it could be said we would keep in a lock-box of sorts.<n><n>In the purse, we would keep in in a special place in the purse, not to keep it safe, but in order of convenience.<n><n>In the desk drawer, we have something different. We put the book in the desk drawer because we don't want to keep it there for long, and we don't want the book to be very hard to find. This is because it would always be in the same place. We wouldn't keep the account book in the desk drawers at all if it was something like a notebook that we wanted to keep permanently.<n>The reason that we wouldn't put it in the bank of the purse is because it doesn't make sense to keep it in a purse that is on the floor.<n><n>So what to put in the desk drawers, we would put the desk drawers in the bank (inside the building) and the desk drawers would be kept inside the building. The reason that we would put it in the bank would be because we could not keep it there. There are

If the customer gives her a $50 deposit, how many dollars does Sandy have in her account after she subtracts $50?<n><n>Input:The answer is 45 dollars.<n><n>Answer: The answer is $50 - $50 = 0. Subtract the deposit of $50 then add it back to the account balance to get 45 dollars. This will be the correct answer.<n><n>Input:This question is worded to look like there is more than one possible answer. Because there is only one dollar in the account, the answer is $12 dollars.<n>Answer: Sandy still has $10 in her account after she purchases the tent, binoculars, and sleeping bag. The correct answer is $10 + $1 + $2 and the answer key says $12. Although the question asks for the "total" expenses, it doesn't say Sandy's total expenses. The question only asks for the total expenses that come off the customer's deposit. Since the customer deposited $50, then Sandy only spent $40. The correct answer choice is $12 because she had $10 in her bank before the deposit and after purchasing the items for $40, there is still only $10 left in her account.<n><n>input: this question is a counting problem where you have to count "bottles".<n><n>Based on the diagram:<n>"bottles" means "cups"

What is the key?<n>Output:This problem may be considered a combination of binary and modulus arithmetic.<n>The key is found by doing mod n, where n is the key for which this particular cipher was made.<n>Since n=56 bits, it could be a 56 length bit long key or a binary string of 64 length bits. Assuming the first type, we have that the key is 76543210.<n>The binary form of a given decimal number is obtained by repeating the string of 0's where the position is the decimal value in the number.<n>For example if the value in decimal is 2, the binary form is 00000010. To make this more clear, here is a table:<n><n>Decimal | Hex | Binary<n>:-------:|:-----:|:-------:<n>1       | 01  | 00001<n>2       | 010 | 00010<n>3       | 011 | 000…<n>4       | 100 | 00100<n>5       | 101 | 001…<n>6       | 110 | 01000<n>         |010…<n>7       | 111 | 01111<n><n>It can easily be found that if the decimal of m = bd, where b is the binary form and d is the decimal, then in binary 0d has to be 0b and bd has to end on 1.<n>This is obtained by looking at decimals and converting them into binary.<n>For example taking the decimal 2:<n>2 = 010<n>010 = 0010<n>2 = 100<n><n>However in binary, 010 cannot be converted to 0010 because the next decimal digit is 0, so 010 is converted to 110, the hex 72.

Choices:  A: eyes B: biology laboratory C: shower stall D: old cheese E: decaying matter<n>Output:		Let's start with a biology laboratory. What kind of fungus can we find there?<n>1. If there are petri dishes that contain agar, we can find fungal growth on them.<n>2. If there are any live or preserved specimen samples in the laboratory, these can also have fungal growth on them, especially molds.<n>3. If there is a fungus, it is not necessarily mycotoxic, which means that it can cause poisoning or illness in humans or animals.<n>4. Some scientists have used the words "agar culture" and "agar slant" to refer to a culture in which a specific fungal species is growing on a medium such as agar or tissue.<n>5. Another kind of fungal growth typically found in a biology laboratory is mold, which is also a fungus.<n>6. Although the spores produced by some kinds of mold and algae are known to make their way into the eyes, which leads to an infection of the eye, this occurs rarely.<n>7. As opposed to some animals and some types of bacteria, fungi can be found in environments that are rich in nitrogen and other nutrients.<n>8. The first step in any culture experiment is to inoculate a medium with the fungus of interest.<n>9. The spores of both pathogenic and nonpathogenic fungi can be found on the skin and hair of humans and other animals.<n>10. Fungal infections can be caused by fungi that can be found on the body, in soils, on plants, on foods, and on other surfaces in the environment.<n>11. Fungal allergies occur when a person inhales spores or other debris from fungi.<n>12. The most common of these kinds of diseases is allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis, which is a form of fungal infection in the lungs.<n>13. If there is fungal growth in a shower stall, it most likely means that there is a waterproof material in the stall that is not easily cleaned with soap and water.<n>14. Soap is one of the most common products that can be used to get rid of mold, mildew, and fungus on a surface.<n>15.

Let's look at the choices.<n><n>A)   Tenacity - The man does not have, or possess, tenacity. The definition of tenacity is persistence, and the man does not have it.<n><n>B)   Hands - The man may have hands, but he lacks the skill required to use them to steady a cup on a table top.<n><n>C)   Coaster - This answer would suggest the cup is in need of support, so the man has a coaster on his table.<n><n>D)   Skill - The man may want to learn skills to give to him the power to set things on a surface, but that's just what people say. If he lacked the skill, he would have learned a skill without the need for the person to say it over and over.<n><n>E)   Breaking - The man has a cup on his table, but that doesn't necessarily mean the cup is fragile. The man can't break the cup, but he did not know that because he lacks a skill or tenacity.<n><n>The man's lack of possession of the skill and tenacity of being able to set things on a table means that he is stuck needing a coaster to put things on a tabletop.

Therefore, we must choose the remaining option (E), the only option left with which option Brad actually did choose to "order".<n><n>So the final answer should be B.<n><n>Input: Two teens named Zainab and Nusrat are making dinner. They have a pancake mix, bananas, and eggs. They also have a pan that holds 3/4 of a cup. What is the fewest amount of eggs that Zainab and Nushrat must take turns cracking in the pan to have full pancakes? Choices: A: 1, because their pan can only hold 3/4 of the egg B: 2, because their pan can hold 2/3 of an egg C: 3, because their pan can't hold 3/4 eggs D: 4, because their pan can always hold exactly 3/4 of an egg E: 6, because their pan can never hold 3/4 an egg<n>Output: There are two options with the fewest amount of total eggs: Option A and Option B). Zainab cracked 1 egg (one whole egg ), and Nusrat cracked 1 whole egg for a total of 2 eggs. Option B) requires two eggs total, one whole egg split in half.  But there are 2 eggs that satisfy the requirements of each option. If we flip the eggs (by changing A into B, and vice versa) and subtract the number of total eggs cracked by the number of whole eggs cracked (10 - 5 = 5 ) for Option B) and do the same thing for Option A) (10 - 4 = 6 )  we find that Option B) has a total of 5 cracks, and Option A) has a total of only 6.
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input:You might head to the locker room after getting a green drink here. Choices:  A: health club B: jocks C: fitness centre D: stadium E: gymnasium<n>Output:		Let us solve this using the "IF-THEN-ELSE" structure.<n>If a = A, then b = B, c = C, d = D and e = E<n>In other words, if a = A, then we are in the health club<n>if a = B, then we are at the jocks gym<n>if a = C, then we are in fitness centre<n>if a = D, then we are at stadium<n>if a = E, then we are at gymnasium<n>For more information regarding this see <a href="http://edurev.in">http://edurev/in</a>.<n>

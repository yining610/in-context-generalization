So Janet's has 40 more than Brenda, but how many balls does Janet have?\nSo Brenda has 110, but how many do Mara and Janet have all together? Well I think 110+85 would be, let's see...\n\nSo we have 195, but how many cards are they going to have all together?\nWell how did Janet get 40 more than brenda? She got 40 more so brenda has 115!

Let's just say 55 is half of 115 like there's my answer!\n\n#### Problem 2\n\nI have to use the Pythagorean theorem, so A plus C squared equals B squared.\n\nThen it's A = B minus C, B squared minus C squared = A squared\n\nAnd I solved for A, A = (B minus C) squared, A = (50 - 25) squared\n\nA = (25) squared = 625!

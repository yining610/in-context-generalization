All of these numbers are called arabic numbers. Then there are some other systems to write numbers where we can speak about the position of the digits. Those systems are called aboriginal numbers. In this exercise, you will be given an arabic number and its aboriginal representation and we ask you to convert them into the other.<n><n>Q2: The expression 3 to the power 2 has a different way of writing and can mean either the square of 3 which is 9. Also, the same number can mean the multiplication of 2 to 3 which is 8.<n><n>Q3: The expressions (5x – 4)2 and 5x +x+ 4 are the exponent of 2 on 5x -4 is 4 and then exponent of 1 on x+ x+ 4 is 1. We can write it as (5x – 2x)2 to make it more shorter but also more complicated. There are two times when we use the square root of a number on top of each other to multiply them, these two times is 9 and 4. The number is an even number since in the second square root there is no minus.<n><n>```<n><n>Q4: In mathematics, a fraction, also called a rational number, is a number that can be written in the form of a ratio, for example 7/15. A fraction is a number that can only be expressed as a quotient (see division

Choices:  A: get tired B: have legs C: skip D: not fat E: look first<n>Output:		A<n>  <n>### Solution:<n>#### Problem 1<n><n>Let's say Janet has $150. So Janet's has 40 more than Brenda, but how many balls does Janet have?<n>So Brenda has 110, but how many do Mara and Janet have all together? Well I think 110+85 would be, let's see...<n><n>So we have 195, but how many cards are they going to have all together?<n>Well how did Janet get 40 more than brenda? She got 40 more so brenda has 115! So how does mara get to have half as many then janet?<n>Okay, so mara has 115 - 150. Let's just say 55 is half of 115 like there's my answer!<n><n>#### Problem 2<n><n>I have to use the Pythagorean theorem, so A plus C squared equals B squared.<n><n>Then it's A = B minus C, B squared minus C squared = A squared<n><n>And I solved for A, A = (B minus C) squared, A = (50 - 25) squared<n><n>A = (25) squared = 625! So we have a lot of blocks!<n><n>### Problem 3<n><n>First is the cards question, okay we have 40, 3x40 + 13 + 40.<n><n>Okay it's 272 cards<n><n>### Problems 4,5,6,7<n><n>8,10,16,20,25,30,40,50,60,1,3,3.3,12<n><n>I forgot about the first question, so let's try this:<n><n>If we have 30 and we add 7 berries, 8, we have 37, and we divide 37 by 2 and we have 18.5, now 18.5 rounds right up to 19, so I'll say 19 berries.

There was a sales person from a tool company there who had made a video explaining the procedure. After watching the video I bought all the tools I need to fix my car key so I should have it fixed by next week. I don't know if I am having it fixed professionally. I have two other cars so if I can fix this one it will save me money to get one of my other cars fixed.<n><n>### The Solution and Explanation:<n>I should have been able to figure out the directions to the auto show on my own or on the internet so I will not be coming back for demonstration. I would have used the video for the demonstration the sales person was giving out to fix my car but I was not aware I could have had them all. I should have bought the tools in the demonstration to fix my car.

Choices:  A: economic instability B: not noticeable C: spend more D: rising interest rates E: boring<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>##### Detailed:<n>Economic instability<n><n>Sometimes fighting inflation, and that can be because it is so negligeable, in some cases it can actually be a good thing, it could also be a bad thing, but sometimes you could probably benefit more from having it than not having it.<n><n>In fact, there's this whole thing in economics of fighting inflation because it is very important. You can't have this type of currency flowing around in your economy if it is actually a problem in the economy.<n><n>Economic Instability is the condition where a major proportion of the world's economy is experiencing or is expected to experience a negative economic growth rate.<n><n><n><n>##### Summary:<n><n>I'll break this down into different sections and I'll discuss each part. First, I'll talk about what economic instability means. Then I'll talk about the causes of it.<n><n>Then I'll talk about how we can prevent or cure inflation. And I'll discuss it in a little more depth as well.<n><n>First things first, let's talk about what inflation is. I'll talk about it in more depth later, but let's just say it's a negative rate in an overall economy of inflation. It's a condition where business, which is negative, is worse, worse than the normal growth rate.<n><n>Okay. Let's go over to the second paragraph in the sentence there. And what does it say? It says that economic stability has become an overused term but let's think about what an over used thing really means, like when somebody says that you know, you've heard someone say a word a lot and it's really overused.<n><n>Is this actually true? Well, I don't think it's an overused term so it's true. What would it mean if it were true that it was overused? So if everyone is just always talking about it and they're always talking about, how important is economic stability? How are we going to make sure that we have economic stability and so on and so forth, it would just be too much of it for us to be able to cope with and we couldn't handle it. The second last sentence, we talked about what it was, kind of. And we talked a little bit about what the causes

But as instructor guided me, I can do this lesson but need more practice and I think this was a good lesson to learn the math again.<n>

Choices:  A: go to church B: appear in court C: watch soap operas D: paying attention E: go into court<n><n>### Response:		What you will do if you hear testimony of how your spirituality changes? When we go to church, attend meetings, or listen to someone's testimony, we learn about other people's journeys and the good or bad experiences they went through, and why they went through it with their faith in the LORD Jesus Christ. We also learn about the principles of the gospel of the LORD through the testimony of the Bible and from books, talks, and seminars.<n>Church attendance isn't just an activity we do on Sunday, but rather a way to draw closer to God. The Bible tells  us to "not forsake assembling together" because it is a time where we can be fed spiritually. We are reminded that "the LORD is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward; not willing that any man should perish, but that all should come to repentance." It is a time where we hear the good news of our Savior, and it is also a time where we feel the need to repent and humble ourselves to a LORD who we may have been disobeying.<n>In attendance to a temple or a church, we are more than likely going to hear the doctrine or teaching of the gospel of our Lord, Jesus Christ. As a youth of the LORD, we should make the best effort to continue our weekly attendance to church, because it will bring us closer to the word of the LORD, in order for our testimonies to grow stronger and ultimately for us to follow the pathway that Christ leads us down on.<n><n>### Input:"The Church is built upon the gospel of Jesus Christ." Choices: A: yes B: no C: maybe<n><n>### Response:"The Church is a body of curel men and women where everyone has the desire to build up the body by following the example of Jesus Christ according to the Gospel."<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n><n>## Question 2.

Choices:  A: food B: cargo ship C: refrigerator D: closet garage E: port<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The best choice of container to use when keeping things safe would be a container that does not need to be opened much. A food container would not be a safe container, since it needs to be opened and reopened quite frequently. A refrigerator would be good, because it does not much need to be reopened. You could choose a cargo container, but you would open it whenever deliveries are needed. The container you would need with fewer openings would most likely be a closet, or a garage. Since the answer choices all have different meanings, and different situations you need each case for it would be ideal to have each one of these.<n><n>### Input :The largest number I know of is 24. A number x greater than the number 24 is 42 greater than 38. What is the greatest number?<n><n>### Response :<n>The first thing you would need to do in this question is to determine the number that is greater than 24 (or whatever number you were given.) To find this, subtract 24 from 42 in order to get your number below 42. When you do this, you get 18. Now you need to add 18 with 38 in order to get your final number. When you do this you get 56.

If a park was built near the bus terminal, you would have one less place to drive.<n><n>### Arguments against:The improvement of the city is important, however, there is another more reasonable option. Adding more parks around the city is much more effective than having just one more park to a bus terminal. The cost of adding just one more park is higher than the expenses of adding many other parks. The parks are designed and intended to be in the neighborhood.<n><n>### Input :<n>You are planning a hike. Your destination is 62 miles away. Your start point is 5 miles from your home.

Choices:  A: jail B: internet cafe C: blacksmith's shop D: building E: bar<n><n>### Response:		If the two places are the same, the answer is A, but if they are different, you may choose any of the other options that best fit the situation. If they are both the same, please explain why you chose the answer that you did.<n>Answers:<n>Blacksmith's shop<n>Jail<n>Internet cafe<n>Bar<n>Building<n>Staircase<n>Inside house<n>Inside car<n><n>The blacksmith's place was built using logs. These are logs at their building and what happens when you put logs together, they create a house.<n><n>Another place that is built with this type of material is Jail.<n><n>This is what happens in the jail, they are made in a wooden way, but they are not as fancy, because they are made for people that are behind bars, or going to jail. They also have some stairs, but there are very few places to go inside the jail, because they are made so that not many things happen in the jail.<n><n>The internet cafe is known for its staircase, this is very important because if there was no stairs, things would be more difficult for each one who goes to the internet room.<n><n>The bar, it has more or less the same material as the other places mentioned above, but it is made differently, it is also not as big, and they don't usually build houses either.<n><n>Inside the building, they also use this material, and in most places, this building is built using wood to save money.<n><n>Now to explain why I did not take one of the other options as the correct answer, in every other place where a building is built, they use a lot of wood, but in this case it is very unusual, because they are usually made with other materials such as stones, bricks or cement.<n><n>### Input 2: A building is 500 feet high.

But here's the problem, if you see a 9-foot tall person standing next to a 7-foot-tall person, you will know who will win

Choices:  A: football stadium B: surface of earth C: car show D: opera E: movie<n><n>### Response:		<n>Choice A: football stadium - The moving parts in the football stadium are the players on the field. On the surface of the Earth, there tends to be much less motion at a football game because things aren't moving like in the stadium. In a car show, vehicles are moving. At an opera, there are instruments and singing that makes the performance moving. At a movie, there are actors that are moving on screen. - The only one that is really "not moving" is the stadium but there is motion from people moving.<n><n>Choice B: surface of earth - The surface of the Earth is the main area that things are moving: earthquakes, tectonic plates, tornadoes, weather, etc. That is not to say there isn't motion underground or under the ocean, and there is certainly motion inside man-made machines. - This seems to be the right answer.<n><n>### Input 14: How would you write a statement to indicate the addition of 5, 7, and 2?<n>Answer: There are a lot of ways to do this.

The product of the lengths of two sides is 34. There is only one way to solve this equation.<n><n>### Response- I can use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve this equation. I multiply the first two sides of the equation since there is only one side. The sides I multiply can be called X and Y. The X and Y sides are 90 degrees each because they are the sides of a parallegram. The squares of the X and Y sides are then 81 and 5. 52 =25 and 81 squared = 6881. 25*81=2025. Add 1 to 2025. That equals to 2026, 2026 squared is 414,976. The formula for the length of the diagonal is the square root of (base) squared + (height squared). So I have to take the square root of 414976. I can solve that with a calculator. It is 66.302<n><n>### Insturctions :<n>Input: There are five students in a classroom. 35% of their combined homework grade is 80 or greater.

She lived an ordinary life with her family. She liked to read books, go to church, hang out with her friends and play video games with her sister. She felt that everything was going fine and that she had a great life, but she got a surprise when she went to play a very scary video game in the evening.<n><n>In the dark room, Tanya started playing the game. It was a scary game where you take control of a monster and scare people. Tanya got to play as the monster. She went out and found a man on a bench and scared him. Tanya jumped in a bush and peeked out to see if she scared the man enough. Tanya noticed the man had something in his hand. He was holding a cross and holding it close to his chest. That made Tanya very angry. She ran at the man and bit him on the neck. That made Tanya laugh, because she saw the man collapse and die instantly.<n><n>Tanya laughed with joy and started to do a happy dance. She suddenly realized she had been laughing so hard she forgot she needed to sleep. It was late, and she had nothing to eat. If she didn’t eat now, she wouldn’t have enough energy to wake up the next day.<n><n>Tanya had a hamburger and walked over to her bed. She felt tired. As she slept, her sister walked up to her room on the third floor and went in to see if Tanya was awake. Her sister found her body on the floor in the living room. Tanya’s family cried because Tanya died that night.<n><n>### Output:<n>Write a response or explanation using your own words, explaining the output.<n><n>### Analysis:<n>### Tips:<n>### Notes:<n>### Explanation:<n>

In fact, few "blank" don't even make it to the top-of-the-best-sellers list even though their book content is more fascinating than chick-lit novels.<n><n>### Note the following:There will be no spaces after punctuation marks unless needed.<n><n>### The above example demonstrates that the words "that's" and "list" are placed on either side of the sentence's only blank.<n><n>### Explanation of the process:<n>When a sentence has a blank where only one word belongs, the blank needs to be separated from the rest of the sentence with the word "that's" or "with" or "without." It's not so much about picking a word to go in the blank as it is about picking a word that appropriately identifies the type of sentence.<n><n>For other blanks in the sentence, it may actually help you to eliminate the word as a candidate. If the word doesn't go in a blank, you might not even notice that it wasn't the right choice.<n>

As society becomes increasingly connected, universities of all types are forced to create security measures to prevent the leaking of sensitive information. For example, at many universities students are required to use their campus credentials to log in to their laptops. The university's security team monitors the data generated by those laptops and alerts students to possible security threats. Another common security measure is the two-factor authentication, which requires the users to provide not only their password but also something they know: like the answers to security questions, or a one-time PIN number.<n><n>### Output 2<n><n>#### University security:<n><n>```sql<n>CREATE TABLE user (id INT, pwd VARCHAR(30), email VARCHAR(50));<n>INSERT INTO user (id, pwd, email) VALUES (1, "12345", "user1@u.edu");<n>INSERT INTO user (pwd, email) VALUES ("cat", "cat@u.edu"); //password must be 6+ chars<n>INSERT INTO user (email, pwd) VALUES ("dog", "dog@u.edu"); <---- password incorrect<n>SELECT * from student where id=@row_id;<n>```<n><n>### Output:<n><n>```sql=<n>SELECT * FROM user where [email]='dog@u.edu' and pwd='dog@gmail.com'<n>```

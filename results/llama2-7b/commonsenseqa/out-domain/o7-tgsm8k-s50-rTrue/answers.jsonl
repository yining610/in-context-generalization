The initial input is just an integer value, but after that I have to take the user input and use it to determine the answer.\n\n# Solution\n- After having an error when using the while loop, I decided to add the print statements. This was to see whether there were any errors in the while loop code. Through these print statements, I realized that my if statement was not true.\n- The initial if statement was not correctly written. The code was set-up to show the conditional statement, which was if 48!= 48. I would change the code to if 47!= 48. However, I changed the user input to 47, the conditional statement should still say 47 == 47.\n- I added another print statement that used 'if user input == 48:', and this resulted in an error: `ValueError: invalid literal for float(): 'C'`. The 'C' was from the 'else' part of my code.  The 'else' part of the code was: else: print(\"\\nThe combined ages will be 49 years, 14 days old.\\n\\n\")\nTo fix this, I removed 'C' from the if statement; and the second part was: elif: print(\"\\nTheir combined ages forty two years from now will be <<<<>>>> years.\")\n```python\n# If statements for the first case:\nif user_input==48:\n    print(\"\\nThe combined age will be 49, 14, years old\\n\\n\")\nelif user_input==0:\n    print(\"\\npablo didn't buy anything: $0", "answer": "B: pantry"}

B and E can both be D, so D and E are both correct answers to this question.\nThe answer to this question is D and E\n\nInput: You are at a party, and you just ate some food.  Your friend thinks that your stomach just expanded a lot, and now it can take up to 3 times as much space as it originally could.  This is an accurate reflection of the space in your stomach because the space in your stumach is a fixed amount divided into 3 times the size. \nTo find the space that your stomach can take up, ask the question \"how big can a square be that has the same dimensions as a triangle?\"  To answer, subtract the size of the triangle from the size of the square.  How big is the new space that you can take up?\nOutput: We are trying to find the size (space) of something, so we use the definition that space is the length, width, and height of an object.  We can figure out these dimensions this way: for width we can find the ratio of length to height as 3/2 (triangles have height longer than length).  For length we can figure this out because we know that if we divide the square by 3 we get back what the square started out with.  We can figure our height the same way, making 2x3x3x1 = 8x3 the dimensions of the square.  Now we can see that our dimensions are width is 6/4, length is 24/3, and height is 2x3.  Finally, when we subtract the triangle from the square (that has been reduced by 1/3 because the triangle only takes 1/3 of the space since it is only 1/3 as big), we have a 2", "answer": "C: shop"}

The first sister received two more items than the second, while the second received two items less than the first. Each sister then received $10 to reimburse herself for the items. How much did each sister make?\nOutput: When items are $10 each, and two more items are bought than sold, then the two sisters each received 10*2 = $<<10*2=20>>20 items.\nIt would take 20*$800 = $<<800*(20)=16000>>16000 to buy $800 worth of items, each sister would now have to shell out the same.

Choices: A: 138 B: 143 C: 179 D: 232 E: 247\nOutput: First, use the percentage formula to determine Sarah's age. 100% of 15 is 15. And 100% - 20% is 100%-20%=80%. 80% of 16 is 12. Therefore, 15 is 20%  (80%) of 16. (Use 3 \u2264 (%\u2212%)(n) < 20)\nSince Sarah's age is 20% of 14 (16 - (20% x 14)), we can say that 20% of her age is 3. Now, the question is to find Sarah's age.\nIf Sarah is 15-3= <<15-3=12>>1\nIf Sarah is 75+5= <<75+5=80>>80 years old, then we get the following equations:\n50-12 = 50-12= <<50-12=-38>>-38\n38-75 = 38-75= <<38-75=-37>>-37\n50-38 = 50-38= <<50-38=-12>>-12\n75-38 = 75-38= <<75-38=-37>>-29.\nThe ages 75, 80, and 12 all add up to 120.  Thus, we can combine them into a single equation to get Sarah's age. We get 120=50+37-12, which simplifies to 120-50=70-12. This simplifies further into 50-39=11, which is Sarah's age.

You have $270 dollars altogether.\u201d\nTherefore, we can solve this problem by saying \u201cFind two consecutive positive integers where the difference between them is 270.\u201d\n### Step 2\nNow that we know we want to solve consecutive integers with the difference of 270, we will simply solve for x = y + 1. We will solve for y = x \u2013 1.\n### Step 3\nNow that we found x = y + 2 and y = x \u2013 2, we will subtract to get 1 = y \u2013 1. ( y \u2013 1 < 2)\nThat means y -1 < 2.\nNow, if we want to subtract 1 from y, we know y - 1 is smaller than 2, as shown by our assumption y \u2013 1 <2. So if we subtract 1 from y \u2013 1, we can have our desired answer, as shown by y \u2013 (y \u2013 1) = y.\n### Step4\n\nThis question is a matter of subtraction of consecutive integers.

If x+1 is the smallest than x+2 is the second smallest. So we keep doing that until x+3 is the second smallest, and then x+4 has been the second smallest from all the options, which tells us that 14 is the smallest.

If Ruth made two 25th anniversary cakes for both her mother and grandmother, how many 25th anniversaries cakes did Ruth make altogether?\nOutput:In this one, we start by trying to figure out how much time each cake took, so we divide the total time by the total number of cakes to figure out how many minutes it took to create each cake: (180 pieces x 4) / (180 cakes + 2) = <<180*4/182>>0.02\nSince, her 25th anniverary cakes took 1/20 of that amount, we can say that the 25th annivery cakes take 1/5th the time of other cakes. So, each 25th anniversey cake takes (180 *.02) / (1/5) = <<18/5>>3.6 minutes\nOnce we know how much time it takes to make a 25th Anniversery Cake, we can multiply that by the number that Ruth makes. 180*3.6 = <<180 * 3.6 = 648>>6", "answer": "B: own cars"}

This is 1.41421356237309504880.... Dividing the series by the square root of 1 gives you the difference between each number.  This is the same as asking for the remainder when you divide by the square root of one.\nFor example, if you divided 1 by the square root of two or (1.414...)^2/2, what would the remainder be? It would be 1, which is the next number in our sequence.\nThe numbers of our sequence start at 1, then the next number is 1/1.41...4 or 1/[(1.41...)*1].\nThe next number in our sequence is 8/[[1.41...)^2]] or 8/1.42.\nIf you keep following this pattern, you will get 22/1.424, 15/1.428, then 22/15.\nFor the next number, you need to take the difference of [(1.41...^7) * 1]/ 89.

How much was paid toward interest for the year?\nOutput: A payment of $4,00 can be used to make interest and principal. Payment = (($4,000 - i/100)*100) The payment you made equals the total amount. We do not have to put principal (P) or interest (i/100). So, $4,00 = ((P - i/10)t) / 100 Where i/100 simply means that \"100\" is the denominator.\nHere's a formula for this: P = $4,00 - (i/10)t We found, (i/10)(100) = Total paid This makes $36,000. i =.04 The payment is $4000-36,00 = $400 - 36,00 / 100 = 0.4 The interest rate is $36,020/12 = $3,00.

The charity was having a fundraiser, and she chose to donate $2 per cat. There were so many cats that she didn\u2019t know the exact amount donated to the charity. But she knew at the end she had donated over triple what she intended. How many more cats did she adopt than she expected as a result of donating double?\nOutput: We know that she donated $40, but she didn't know how many cats $2 could buy, so we will assume that $2 per cat bought 1 cat.\nWe know that the number of cats that she adopted exceeds what she planned by 3, so we will assume:\n1. She donated $2 * 1 cat = $2\n2. The number of cats is 2 + 1, which we will assume is 3\n3. So to find what she spent beyond what she thought, we will subtract 2 $2 cats + $2 = $<<2*2+2=6>>6 from the 3 cats she intended to adopt.\nSubtracting this amount still leaves 1 cat:\n$6 - 3, resulting in $6 left.\nSo she donated $6 over the amount she thought she would donate.\n3cats - 6 = <<3cats-6=3>>3 cats left\nShe adopted 3 cats and donated $6 extra, so the final answer is 2: B.\n\nInput: At lunch, Amanda, Adele, and Arianna each ate a sandwich, an appetizer, a fruit, and a beverage (all at the same price) for a total cost of $42.24.

Two balls are chosen at random from the box. What are the chances that neither ball is red?\nOutput: Since there are 5 red balls, it is easier to calculate the probability of picking one red ball than 1 ball being red and the other being the opposite color. There are 4 blue balls, therefore there is a 1/6 chance of that ball. And there are 3 orange balls, so there is a 1 in 8 chance of that ball. Therefore, there would be a 1/6 + 1/8 = <<1/6+1/8=5/40>>5/40 chance of picking two blue balls, 1/6 +1/8 + 1/4 = <<1/6++1/8++1/4=> = 5/8 chance of picking two orange balls, 1/5 + 1/2 = <<1/5++1/2=11/10>>11/10 = the chance of picking 2 white balls, but there is no chance of picking 4 balls of the same color because one ball is already picked before the two balls are chosen.

The company has limited resources and must sell all of the tires for a given amount of money. If the company can only sell x tires per day at a cost of y dollars per tire sold, then which of the following statements is false?\nOutput:The answer is A. According to the question, all these are correct. If the company has limited resources, and costs y dollars/unit then the number of units sold in a day is proportional to the y. If it has limited resources, then x and y are the costs per unit. If it can only sell y tires per day, the cost, y, is a constant. That means the tires sold in a day is also dependent on a fixed constant. In the solution, the output is greater than 1000, so obviously, it isn't a constant. And the other choice was more than 1, which means that it wasn't even 1 tire sold a day; hence it isn't a limitation in resources.\n\n\n\nInput:If the output of a factory is 24 tires per minute, that means?\nOutput:The right choice is B.

The rabbit is able to run 20x faster than the turtle. How many feet will the rabbit be ahead?\n\nOutput: Since the rabbit and turtle start at same place and run at same speed, we can state that the rabbit runs 1 unit for turtle runs 1 unit, and so on till the rabbit runs 20x times and then the turtle runs 20x, and then the turtles stops after running 1 unit. Thus total distance run by both is 20x. If you want the rabbit to reach destination, you need to know how fast it wants to run in the first place. Hence, we need to check how long it takes turtle to reach the destination. It takes turtle 20 times to reach destination, so if rabbit starts running at 10th place, it will cover a distance of 10 * 20 = <<10*20=200>>-200 unit, as he wants to overtake turtle only, it does not start after 10th place and continues till turtle stops, but ends before it does, so in order to overtake turtles distance covered is -200 unit + 20(20 + turtle runs in total)=>>-200+20*22>20*22<<20*22=4400>>4400", "answer": "E: wet"}

When one man died, another was merely chosen to take his place. Thus, the idea of succession,  and the passing on of power from one person to another  did not exist. Instead, power was the sole domain of the Pharaoh. All people were under Pharaoh\u2019s rule, and served him as servants. All people feared the Pharaoh, and had no authority but what the Pharaoh gave them.\nWhich of the following would BEST clarify that the Pharaoh was a person of great power BEFORE THE EXISTENCE OF SUCCESSION, AND THE PASSING ON OF POWER?\nOutput: By saying it came down to earth, the Pharaoh was actually human, which implied that he was not divine or a god.\nFrom being immortal, it would follow that the Pharaoh cannot be human because humans are mortal.\nIf Pharaoh feared no authority above his, which means he had the power to decide all things, it would follow that he was not the servant.\nFrom this point of view, it can be concluded that pharaoh's supremacy is based on humanity, instead of divine, which is contrary to historical thinking\nSo the final answer should be human\n\nInput: Mr Jones is having a huge party today.

The sum of the negative points plus the sum of the positive points can be averaged.\n\nFor example, if the first assignment is -7 and 19, their difference is 26. Then, if there is a 21-point difference in the second assignment, then their difference is 21.\nIn the average of the first assignment, 26 + 19 - 26 = 16.

If there are 50 girls in their class, how many boys are in the class?\nOutput: This is a tricky question because you need to be creative with your answer.\nSo, if the girl to boy ratio is 1:2, but there's 50 girls, then there's 25 girls with a remaining 25 boys. However, according to the question, no one has mentioned this ratio, so we're trying to solve it without that ratio in mind.\nNow, if 25 boys are the last ten boys in the class then there must be 35 boys in the class. That number must be further divided by the other 35 students in the class, which are 50.\nThat means there is 2 boys per each girl in the class, because only 50 girls were mentioned.\nSo the formula here is\n(25/50) = (25/50), which would be:\n((25/50)/(25/51)) = ((25/50)-1)/((25/51)-1)\nSo the formula here would be (24/51), which is equal to 0.48.\nThen multiply by 50 to make your answer 24\nSo the final answer would be 24\n\nInput:Alice is 39 years old, and her aunt is 4 years older than her daughter.

Otherwise, it will loop back through the calculations from the beginning with the larger amount (32oz in this case).\nIf it costs the same, the program would need multiply the cost of the current 3lb bag, the cost of the previous (2 lb) bag, and then divide by 3.\nTo get the value for the smaller bag, it would need to subtract the cost of the larger bag from the total. (For the first time, it will be 0 as the 24oz bag costs $1.50 in this example)\nIt then divides by 2, subtracts the previous total which in this case would be $1.50 / 2 = $<<1.50/2=0.75>>0.75\nFor the final answer, the program multiplies the final amount it found by 2. Because we started with the total of 2 of the larger 7 lb bags, the larger total will still end in 0.75 (0.75).\nSo it then divides the total by 3 which would get the price for the smaller 2lb 24oz bag.\nSo the final program would look for a string in 0.72018, where 2018 is a remainder of 3 after the last division\nSo the program will need to check if 0", "answer": "A: candy store"}

How much did the buyer save per car while buying these three cars?\nOutput: The buyer saved $500 per each car minus the cars he has bought. This amounted to $500 / 3 $<<500/3=167>> and $500 /4 $<<500/(4)=121>>. So the buyer has saved a total of $167-$121 = $<<167-121=46>>46.\nSo the final result is 46\n\nInput: The cost of a package including 30 bars of soap and 60 bottles of lotion is $170. If 10% of the lotion is defective, then 5% of the soap is also defective. What is the total profit if 50 cases were sold?\nOutput: The cost is $170 which also contains profit. 10% defective lotions gives 5% defective soap.\n5% = 50% = 5/10 of a bar of soap and 10% = 10/100 of a bottle of lotion.\n50% = 1/2 a bar of soap. So we subtract 1/2 from 5/10 giving us -1/10 bar of soap.\nThis equals 9/10 of a box.\n\nSimilarly, 60 = 6 / 10. This equals 3 / 10 which gives you 1/10 of a bottle.\n\n(9/10) bars of soap + (1/10) bars with defects = 49/10 bars of soap\n\n(3/10) bottles of lotion + (1/12) bottles of lotions with defects = 8 out of 10 bottles of lotions\n\nProfit for 50 boxes = (10/10 + 1/10) = 110%\n\nSo the final answer to the problem", "answer": "E: errors"}

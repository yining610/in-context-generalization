Write a rational behind your answer for your next submission.\n\n### Input :  The difference in ages between two friends is 6. If 3 years from now one friend is 36 years old, how old is the other?\n\n### Solution: The ratio between two ages will be 6:1. Since the ration is 6:1, so their ratio will be 36/6 = $<<36/6=6>>6 and the ratio between difference in two age + age of one of them = 6 so other friend is 6-1 = 5.\n\n### Rationale : I know this is correct because, if you add two equal ratios, you will get the total of ratios, so if our ratio is 6:1 after you add 6 plus 1, then you will get the answer which is 7. Similarly, when 6 is multiplied by 1, you will get 6, so both 5 and 6 will divide into 6 equally. \n\n#### 5\n### Answer:\n5\n### Instruction : \nInput : The difference in ages between a father and son is 47.

In what way is college different than a traditional high school education?\n\nIn a typical high school, a student graduates with a grade point average(GPA), on average between 2.7 and 2.9. The employment field is very rigorous and competitive and employers expect an employee's level of proficiency to match their stated degree. What does that mean? It means employers don't want to hire someone who just graduated with a 'D' average. In 2011, for instance, a person with a 'D' or below was unemployed for 51.4 weeks. The unemployment rate for college graduates was only 3% and the unemployment rate for those with lower degree's was 5%.\n\nCollege is a highly structured course of study in a highly structured environment. In a high school setting, you might walk into a class and then it's up to the teacher to decide exactly what the material is. The same holds true for your job. In other words, you don't know exactly what's going to be on the test for you.  Or, when you go into a meeting at your company, you don't even know what your boss is going to be talking about. In the same way, no two college courses are completely structuralized to teach the same material in the same order. However, a typical course in a college is structured around a textbook and the material the student needs to learn. In addition, a college course is typically taught by someone who specializes in a specific field, and that person is there to make sure that you learn the material he or she wants you to learn. The professors in a college are there to be able to answer any questions you might have. Even", "answer": "A: learning"}

Substitute and solve for x to be 5.  x = 87 = $<<138=87>>87, so she bought 87 beans and grew 88 beans.\n\n87 + 88 = <<87+88=175>>175\n\n### Answer\n\n$175\n\nRationale:\n$ 138 - 5 x 88 is 5 beans + 470 beans = 505 beans.  We added 470 beas to the 88 beans that Cind grew and the 5 beans she bought to get 505 beas.  $138 is the 37% in the equation $505=<<505=138>>138\nSo $138 = <<$138=94>>94 - $87 x <<$138=-47>>47.

{"text": "Because the height of the object that the athlete had to lift was unknown,  but the object had a weight of 42 pounds and was lifted with an arm extended at a 121\u00b0 angle, a formula can be created.  121\u00b0 is what the arm is pointed at 42 pounds is the weight of the object in which it needs to lifted 139.079924 feet is the final height the object is dropped \n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple guess questions.\n\n### Questions:\n1. What is the maximum amount of height that the object can drop?\n2. Who won the competition?\n\n### Rationales:\n#### Question 1\nRationales: Since the object will be holding onto the athlete's arm, it can be used to create the distance the object went down. From the 42 pounds of weight it had, the object was lifted up 121\u00b0. Therefore, that means the athlete will be extended at a 98\u00b0 angle in what was left to go down the length. The only time the athlete extended their arm 98\u00b0, but the object had to be at a 125\u00b0 angle: 98+125 = <<98+120=223>>223. So the object went down 223 feet.\n\nNow, from 222.0463563, the athlete's hand will be extended.  Divide that by 12 inches to be left at the bottom: 222/12 = <<222/10=22>>22\n\nNow, when they added 22 inches to the object's height, it will come to 522 feet high.\nSince the sum of the object height and the athlete's height was 640 feet, that means the object went down 627 feet or the maximum distance.\n\nThe amount of time the athlete took was 3 seconds.\n```math\n((height+height)/2)+height = (object+arm) 3 seconds\n(object+arm)/2(3) = (object+arm+object+arm) / 6 seconds of height\n((object+arm+object)+arm)/6 = (", "answer": "A: holding"}

{"text": "Choice E\n\n### Rationale:\n1. A grand casino is not a proper place for a reception, as those are not well suited for small informal events with lots of guests at the table. It is best to have guests at the same table.\n2. A large room can work well for a reception, but not as well as a restaurant. This is because restaurants are designed for serving food to multiple tables at the same time. However, a large room is not a good place to hold a reception, since it may be difficult to see everyone at once.\n3. A country club is not ideal for a reception, because it is difficult to have a gathering for such a small number of guests. However, large restaurants work well for receptions, because multiple tables are designed to serve the food together.\n4. A lobby is not a suitable place for a reception, because the space would be too small and awkward to gather all guests. Restaurants are ideal for receptions, because it is easier to socialize with people at a table instead of a room.\n\n### Task:\n\nBased on the scenario and a couple of important clues you learned in the last question, determine what type of gathering this is going to be.\n\n### Response - Question 1\n\nAfter the instructions have been received but before a response is made, you may use the context clues and the prior knowledge gained to develop an appropriate response. After these initial responses, continue reading the instructions closely, asking yourself what the question is, what is being asked, and what the information being given is about.\n\n### Sample Scenario:\n\n#### Instruction:\nDuane, your brother, and several other people are going on a trip overseas.

They need to pack light, so Duane wants to put a change of clothes in their carry-on bags.\n\n#### Your task:\n\nSince Javier and Duane are traveling, what is the best place to pack their clothes?\n\n#### Rationales:\n\nThis scenario could be Duane or his friend Javier. In either case, they will need to pack their clothes with them, so the best place to keep their clothes is a carry-on bag.\n\n### Rationales for Sample Scenario 2:\n\nDuane,", "answer": "B: large room"}

The rest of the chairs are yellow. \n\n### Demand - What is the total of all of the colours?\n\n### Response - 1/2 of the chairs are colored, and 1/2 of those are blue. If there are 20 chairs, that means you account for 10 blue chairs plus 10 colored ones. So 1/4 of 20 are red because 1/4 of what is not blue. The total of all of the colors would be 10+(1/4) since 1/4 is smaller than 1/5. There are 5 green chairs (1/8) and 3 yellow chairs (1/4). For a total of 16.\n\n### Answer - There are 52 blue chairs in a classroom (1/4 * 22 since 22 is much less than 20). There are 19 red chairs (1/5 * (18)), 17 green chairs (1 over 6 *(16)), and 19 yellow chairs (1 over (8) * 4)). 52+19+17+19 = 127.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis is a good learning experience for me because it improved my reading skills and taught me to be more mindful.

Choices:  A. $5.10 B. $5.30 C. $5.40 D. $5.20 Answer A. $5.2\n\n### Response\nGarth paid for the snack and now he has $95 in his account, but the account he bought the snack from only costs $50.20, and his account is short by 44.80. He could now borrow from family or friends, but to keep that $95 from going negative, he could save the money he spent on the snack and add that amount to the 44.8 he saved. It is best to say that \"he earned $5.20\", not paid. $$||5.20 <5.2|| + $44.80 + $5.20 = $50.2$$\n\n### Answer\nGarth paid the snack, and when he took it out of his account, he found that he had $50.2 left.

{"text": "The London has more telephone booth.\n\n### Rationale:The response is $<<The London has more telephones.>>1)London is a city in England, and there are more cities in the country than there are gas stations. The number of gas stations can be calculated by dividing the population of England by six, and multiplying that number by the average number of gas stations in England. One way to think about this is that the number of people in a gas station is 1 person : 6 cars (the station has 6 bays to fill up for each customer).\n\nA gas station may have an additional two pay-at-the-pump machines (one for each lane leading to the pumps).  Let's round off to 1 person : 5 vehicles.\n\nThe average car in England uses 48.4 gallons of gas per year.\n\nNumber of gallons per car per year : $<<48.4 gallon/5=9.66>>9.66\n\nNumber of cars : $<<car per year times total number of number =48.4 * 5>>242\n\nSo a gas station in England would be expected to sell about 242 gallons of gas to customers each year. Let's multiply that number by the number of vehicles in England.\n\nVehicles per person in England : $<<54 vehicles/6 people>> \n\nNumber of total vehicles in England : 351 cars (divide by 6) * 1 person : 7 cars\n\nSo the number of gallons consumed by vehicles in England is: $<<243 * 351>>...45282 (the number of gallons can be calculated by diving the number of total vehicles by the expected number of gallons per car, then multiplying that number by 242, the expected number of gallones sold each year per gas station (remember, there are 6 gas stations to be filled by each customer))\n\nSo the number divided by 3 to make the answer more readable is 150,606 :\n\nThere are 150,000(1/3) gas stations in England, at which 600 gallons are sold each year.\n\nSo the total number of gallons of", "answer": "B: city"}

{"text": "A\n### Instruction\nAnswer the following multiple choice questions. Demonstration If two car accidents happen in a week, how many more likely is it for you to get car accident if you have been in a car accident before?\nRationales The number of car crashes over the course of a year by state, the overall number of car crashes per year was 6,961,000. Using information like total number of crashes nationally and the number of people injured or killed in a crash each year, the car accident rate that year was 969 / 100,000. The total number for all states would be given by finding the product of the number of people in that state and that state's car accident rate, which is 969 /100000.\nFor the first accident, there is a 25% chance. Since the second car accident would give a 25% probability, then the third would be 37.5%, and the fourth would be 50% and so forth.\nIf two car accidents happen, this would give 6961 / 85 - 695, which equals 50, or every 79.9 years on average. If two people have been in car accidents before, they are 50 / 37.5 *100, which is 135% more likely!\n\n#### 135\nAnswer: 1135", "answer": "D: getting tired"}

You decided to weigh in on the conversation. Which letter do you think represents your stance better? The app, which you have never heard of before, is designed to keep track of a child's growth from birth until the child turns five. The purpose of the app is to help parents make sure their child is growing at the average, or on track with their growth. A: The app should not be used because there are studies that show it can increase anxiety B: The app should be used as soon as possible because it makes it easy for parents to keep track of their child's growth C: The app can be used, but parents need more information before using it to truly determine if their child is on track D: The app should never be used because it is a bad way to determine growth E: There are so many factors to consider outside of the app that can determine a child's growth\n\n### Response\nIn my opinion, the app shouldn't be used to keep track of a kids growth because it will make the parents more anxious about what could happen to their child.

After a quality assurance check, 4% of the widgets cannot be resold to consumers. However, only 6% of the defective widgets have visible defects. What is the fraction of widgets that can be sold to customers?\n\n#### Question Solution:\n\nTo solve for the fraction of widgets, which we will call _sold in a widget_, that can be sold to consumers we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find how many defective widgets cannot be resell. We know that only 4% of the defective cannot be resold to customers.\n    1. This will be 4% of widgets that passed the quality assurance check which is 4% * 3,5010% * 3,4521,7130,010%.\n    2. However, only 4% were defective, so we will subtract 4% from the previous step.\n        1. Therefore: 3,509% * 3,108% * 2,917%\n        2. We know that 4% = 29 so we can rearrange the equation 3,504% * 349% * 310.\n2. Now that we have the widgets that cannot be sold to consumers, we need to subtract from the total.  We have 3500 *.4 = 1 x 3500 = 3500. Since 6% of defective widgets do not have visible defects and since 4% have visible defects we know that 4%.4% = and since their sum is 3500.6", "answer": "C: make love"}

{"text": "B\n1. If an artist were to commemorate a horse by painting it, they would need a canvas.\n2. A canvas is rectangular in shape, and typically it has a frame.\n3. The frame is made of a type of wood, sometimes two different kinds of wood.\n4. The painting is done on the top part of the canvas, and sometimes the artist stretches the canvas to make the painting even larger than it was originally.\n5. Stretching canvas by hand requires a lot of strength.\n6. Stretching canvas is very hard to get right.\n7. Painting isn't the only way to commemorate a living being.\n\n### Rationales\n\n1. Canvas is used to paint horses, so the way to commemorate it is by stretching the canvas.\n2. Canvas is rectangular, that\u2019s why it has a frame. A frame is made using two different kinds of wood, if artists want to make the frame for their painting they need one type of wood to make the sides and one type of wood to use for the back of the frame.\n3. If the canvas is stretched, the frame gets stretched.\n4. To stretch canvas, you need to pull on it with a lot of force.\n5. If you pull too hard you may warp the canvas, if you pull it to lightly the canvas will tear, but if you pull it just right then it will create a small wrinkle in the canvas and stretch it out.\n6. This is only the case if you\u2019re trying to stretch out your canvas as close to the desired shape as possible.\n7.

Routine and sophisticated can be synonyms but in this sentence, routine is not synonym to sophisticated.Routine is defined in the dictionary as  - \"noun: a fixed or mechanical procedure such as a series of actions or steps customarily followed for a particular purpose.\"Arcane and routine can be synonyms because routine is usually for something or someone that people have heard of or is well-known. Imprevist is not synonym to routine because it means that something that happened suddenly or without warning.Heavenly is also not synonym to routine. I would assume that Heavenly is related to something that is spiritual or relational to some sort of deity.

They either need to be stored in a A: large city, B: strip mall, C: building, D: shopping m\u2026\n\\end{code}\n\nComment: please dont reply just saying correct\n\nAnswer: It's hard to give a comprehensive answer if we don't know what tool you are using but since you tagged this question as [python](/questions/tagged/python), I'll assume you're using Python 2.\n\n\\section{General}\n\nWhen working with Python, you often see many small `for` loops in a single line. As long as no other operations are performed inside the loop, these lines can be written on a single line. However, when you call a function/method inside this type of `for` loop, a newline will be inserted.\n\nTo avoid the insertion of these newlines, you can add a `continue` statement in front of the function call. This will make Python jump to the next iteration of the loop and thus make the `for` loop continue from the same line where it was last executed.\n\n\\section{`continue` and `break` Statements}\n\nWhenever the `for` loop is iterating over a range of values, it will do `iteration.value =...` and then proceed to the next step of the loop.\n\nSo what are `continue` and `break`?\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item `continue` will immediately jump to the next loop in the iteration.\n\\item `break` will break the entire `for` loop and `iteration.value` will never be executed.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nYou use these statements while iterating through lists, dictionaries etc. While `break` is very useful in this case, most of the time you will use the `continue`.\n\nFor example: If we were iterating through all the countries of a region and were to check if the name of each country contains the letters US (or just America), we will use a `for` loop and a `continue` statement. If the `countriesDict` is our `iteration`, then we will use `countriesDict.has_key('name')` to iterate and set the `value` in `iteration.", "answer": "C: building"}

Usually, I would look at the last 2 answers. Then I would take the left question and put it at the end. Then I would have the rest of the question and the new answers at the start. Then, I just tried and guessed the correct answer. Fortunatly, my guess was really close. It was off by one character and in the correct spot.\n\nLastly, it was the 8th problem. The question asked: \"If you were on a roller coaster, and you lost your cellphone. How many teeth would there be on the rollercoaster?\" My brain automatically thought teeth and it went down in the wrong direction.

The two groups have similar appetites and each chose a main course. Both friends\u2019 lunches cost $5. After splitting the bill for each group, the amount each person in the groups has to pay is determined by how each person has chosen a dish. Group A has 5 members, while group B has only 3. How much does each person in each group have to pay?\n\n### Rationales: Group A has the advantage of having more people. After each group splits the bill, each person in group A has to contribute an amount which is the total cost of the main courses from both groups multiplied by the number of people in group A. So if the total cost of the meal is $30, then each group member will contribute $30/5 = $ <<30/5=$6>>6 dollars to the bill.\nIf group B has 3 members, each person in group B will contribute an amount that is the total cost of their meal divided by the number of people, or $15/3 = $ <<15/3=$5>>5 dollars each.\n#### Answer: Group B\n\n### Input (multiple choice questions):What is the difference between 1/4 + 7/12 + 9/20 and 5/6 - 1/12 + 1/5?\n\n### Response (multiple choice question):1/4 + 1/5\n\n### Why (multiple choice questions):The answer is C because it describes when to go from improper fractions to mixed numbers and it's an expression of the sum and difference.\n\n### Response to Instruction:Write your own multiple choice question for your classmates to answer.\n\n### Why to response:Write multiple choice questions which require the use a variety of math skills for your classmates.

If one number is reused, say 4249, and we are going to use it a second time, then we have 9 different numbers. If one number can be used more than once, say we are using 3.

Each number can be chosen once or twice.\n\n## Answer:\n9\n\n### Instructions:What is the greatest number using at least two digits that will satisfy all four conditions?\n\n### Rationale\n\nFirst of all, the greatest number to satisfy all 4 conditions must be a composite number\n\nFor the divisibility rule, the number must be divisible by 7.\nFor the remainder rule, it must remain the same mod 3. For example, if an unknown integer is divided by 2, then the remainder is 1. If the unknown number to be checked is 1937, then the remainder is also 1.\n\nFor the divisibilty rule, the number must also be divisible by 4.\nFor the remainder rules, it must change mod 4. For example, if the unknown is divided by 2 and the remainder is 2 than the remainder is 2. If 1937 is divided by 2 then the remainder is 5.\n\nSo in order to satisfy the divisibility rule of 4 and the remainder rule of 3, 1937 doesn't work.\n\nTo satisfy the divisibility rule for 4, the number must evenly divide 2, and in the remainder rule 2 must remain the same modulo 2.\n\nNumber 2004 works (it is divisible by 4) and 1991 works (it is even and 2 remains the same modulo 4)\n\nNumber 1992 works too.\n\n(1639 + 1795) /7 = 2004 \n\n(1628 + 1804) / 3= 1991 \n\n(968 + 1232)", "answer": "C: die"}

C. 52 passengers. D. 1 passenger Choose 1\n\n### Response\n\nAfter the city hires 1 driver to drive 11 buses, there are 201 bus drivers. 49.5 buses per each bus driver. So if 11 passengers go on a bus, 4.5 passengers per driver. So the city needs to give 9.5 bus drivers per passenger.\n\n### Rationales\n\nThe city hires 1 bus driver to drive 1 bus, then every bus driver can drive more than 1 buses, so we can calculate: $$$$1 Bus$$$-$$$ $11$ passengers$$$$=$$$ $$$111111*1$$=14$$.\n\nAs the city hires more drivers, every bus driver can drive $11$ passengers, then the number of the bus goes up to $11*1.4=15.4$\n\nWe can use this method to increase the number of passenger of one bus.\n\nThe city hired a bus for $1.2$ passengers, this means that the city will employ $<<1.2=14>>14 drivers to drive $11$ bus at the very beginning.\n\nWe can solve this equation as follows:\n$$$$1 Bus$^{\\dagger}$$$$-$$$ $<<1>>$ passengers$$$$=1$$$\n\n$$$So$$$ the city needs to employ $14$ more drivers.\n\nWe can get a similar result when we multiply by $11$:\n\n$$$$1 Bus$(11)$$$-$$$14$ passengers$$$$=0$$", "answer": "C: body of water"}

Therefore we need to subtract the starting number from the ending number. To do so, we need to use the two points A and B. A=20, and B=-1, the difference is 20-(-1) = 21.\n\n### Rationas (B): To get to C, we first use A and B and subtract their difference. In this case, we subtract 25 from 21.\n25-21=4\n### Rationals: When we subtract 21 from 25, there is a remainder of 4 \n\n#### Answer:B\n\n### Input:-700, B: -148, C: -264, D: -360, E: -540\n\n### Ratians (A): To find the answer, we have to subtract the line, that has to be crossed (242) and the difference between each line. The first difference is, as A and B are the starting and ending point, and we subtract the starting point from the ending point. The amount that B has to move before it hits C is minus 242.\n\n###Ratians(B): B is the answer to this question, because B has to move to where it meets (-264), from this we subtracted the line 242, minus the line we already subtracted is 28.  The remaining 28 needs to be multiplied by a coefficient and the coefficient is 4. (28 X 4=112) So, the answer will lie somewhere on this line.", "answer": "C: garage"}

For each year that the car is used, the book value decreases. For every year that the car is insured, the book value remains the same (it never goes down).\nToday, the car has 12,200 miles. If the book value is 7,520, how many _____s has the car been insured?\n\n### Rationales:\nThe book value starts out at 7,52 to start. You then subtract 1, then 2 until it gets down to zero\nThe car started out with 7,52 and then it was insured 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 for a total of 12 each year.\nThe car was insured for 12 each year, and each year the book value was decreased by 12,000 so the car was being insured for 13,200 each year.\nWhen the car had 36,000 miles, it was worth zero because the book value is zero the first time it is insured, so there is only 8 years worth of mileage and insurance.\n\n### Answer:\n12\n\n### Instructin:\nJames bought a new car and plans to sell it a year later.

Round to the nearest hundred. \n\n### Rationale:\n\nThe total cost is $24,000 (18,00*3=54,000, take off 18,0)\n\nEach year he loses, 20% $4,800 each year \n\nIn 3 months he loses $14,000 ($24,00-48,000-4800=24,0(0.", "answer": "E: hand written"}

If one is 4 years older then her, and 2 are 2 years older, how old are the two older sisters? \n\n\n**Input:**  The girl has 4 sister, but you know that 1 is 4 years older than her, 2 are 2 year older than her, and that she is the youngest in her family.  \n\n#### Rationales:  Her youngest sister has to be the fourth and youngest. When you add the age of one of the older sister to 4, you get the total age of the four sisters. The older sisters that are 4 and 2 years old are the two oldest.\n\n#### Answer:  The two oldest are two and four years older then the youngest. The two oldest are 6 years older then the young one of the family.\n\n\n#### Demonstrations: A boy is twice as old as his grandfather. If his grandfather's age is 5x+1, how old is the boy? \n\n#### Rational:  The boy is twice as old is his grand father. First we need to find the grand fathers age, he is 5x+2, we need to divide the grand father's age by two then we find that his grandfather's is 5x+6\n\n#### Answer: The grand father's age divided two is 2.5, and 2.5 x+6 his grand father's age is 6.5. 2.5 x +6 + 6(age of youngest boy) gives the age of the young boy. The young boy has to be older and 6.5 x is 41.  The young boy's age 41 x 2 is 82.\n\n\n#### Instruction: Find the number of coins  the piggy bank has. \n\n\nThe coin is worth.01 or more\n\nIf at each transaction the total has to be > the amount of coins and the total has too be < the amount \n\nthen:\n\n\nIf the bank has.33 coins, the total is 5.\n\n\n\n```\n\nIf piggy has", "answer": "C: throne room"}

{"text": "A is deceptive because by harming others you are not being honest with yourself or them.\n\n### Input 2:  A student in a school is trying to find the sum of a group of students\u2019 ages. The average age of those students is 29 years. It has been correctly stated that one student has had 1/2 of the age sum for 102 years and was born after the birth of three other students, adding up to 102 years. Based on the information above, how old is the student?\n\n### Input explanation and rationales:\nYou are given that the sum of the students' ages is 102 years old. The average age of the students is also 29 years. This means that 14 students have an average age of 29 years. And the 1/2 of 102 is 51-29=22. Then subtract 22 from 102. This leaves 7-22=27. The student was likely born after these events, and was born after the sum of the age of the third set of three students, which is 77 years. These students must be 30,31,32 years old. Subracting 30 from 102, then subtracting 31 from 102 then subtracting 32 from 103 gives 62-61-60=1. So the student was born after these events. The student was born 11 years after the sum of the ages of the previous three students. This would be the 4th set of three students. And each of these three students were 18 years old, 19 years old, and 20 years old. Therefore the age sum of the fourth set of three students is 57, so the student was born 57 years after the sum of five previous student's ages. This equals 11+57=68 years.\n\n### Answer:\nThe question asks for the 1/2 (51) of 102 years in the 102 year time span and gives the 57 year time span until the 57th student is added. The new 57th student was 51 years old and the student was born after being added. This means that", "answer": "D: cruel"}

One second would add to her suffering. \nWhat was Rebecca doing in the elevator?\"\n\n### Response:\"Rebecca was probably stuck in an elevator.\"\n\n### Rationales: The elevator travels 30 miles per hour. That makes the elevator traveling for 30 hours, traveling 30 x 30 x3600= 111,140 feet. So she spent 111,200 feet in the elevator. It's 111,000 feet x 90 minutes, divided by 100 = 6071 feet. 6071 minutes in 30 hours = 29 hours and 33 minutes.

The answers are provided below.\n\n![](/images/solution1.PNG)\n\n## A longer math-based question\nConsider the following function\n\\[f(x)=\\begin{cases}\n  \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x-1}} & x>1 \\\\\n  0 & x=1 \\\\\n  x-1 & x<1\n\\end{cases}\\]\nDraw a graph of \\(f\\) and identify a vertical line \\(y=1\\) crossing \\(f(x)\\). The graph appears to be symmetric about this line, so you could conclude \\(f(x)=f(-x)\\) by symmetry.\n\nHowever, there is a problem with this reasoning\u2026\n\nTo check if the implied \\(f(x)=-f(-x)\\) is actually true, you need to compute \\(f(x)\\) and \\(-f(-x)\\).\n\n![](/images/(output-135).jpg)\n\n### Solution\nThe solution is shown below:\n\n* Calculate \\(f(x)\\)\n\n\\[f(1) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-1}} = 1\\]\n\n* Calculate \\(\\displaystyle-f(-x)\\), that is, \\(f(k-i)=-f(-(k-i))\\)\n\n\\[f(-1) = \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{-1-(1-1)}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{-2(1-1)+2(1-1)}}\\implies f(-1)=\\frac{2(1-1)}{(-2(1-1))-2(1-1)}=\\frac{(6-2)}{4-2}=3\\]\n\n* The last step shows that \\(f(x)=3\\) does not equal \\(-f(-x)=3\\). Note also that \\(\\displaystyle f(1)=\\displaystyle -f(-1)=\\displaystyle -(1)=\\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{1-(1-1)}}\\) is different from \\(f(1)=1\\).\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe reason why you can conclude \\(f(x)\\ne-f(-x)\\) from the graph alone is that the vertical line drawn at \\(y=1\\) does not cross \\(f(", "answer": "E: formal garden"}

Mechanical tools are used by craftsmen such as carpenters and blacksmiths, woodworkers and metalworkers. This usage was also applied to many of the tools or machines that a \"carpenter\" operated in the shipyards or factories where they worked.\n\nIn the United States, the term carpenter or master carpenter (or even master) was applied as a title for a person who owns a company or workshop which manufactured furniture or related wooden products in relatively large quantities.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the term carpentry referred to the construction of structures such as ships and buildings, but also to small household items created by a single craftsman or \"carpenter\" (cf. carver), such as tools for the kitchen, writing or music.\n\nThe name of the trade (English: carpenter, German: Zimmerer) is derived from the Latin term carpinarius (Greek: Keras, German: \"carpenter\"), which in turn would have come from the Gaesatae Carinae of ancient Egypt, mentioned in a Greek inscription. They are described as a craftsman who works with wood and stone.\n\n### Input 2\n\nThe word \"cruise\" is not of Latin derivation, and has nothing to do with the carpenters who would later be called cruise builders, although one of the possible origin theories of its name is the word crux, which means \"cross\" in Latin.", "answer": "A: drill"}

If Samantha spent $40 to buy food for her cat and the class had total $49.29, who, if anybody, spent over $48?\n\nRationales: We will first solve what each student has to buy.

They decide to split their trip. Skyler wants to ride 43% of the way there and Kory wants to ride 116 miles to complete his half. How far did Skyler need to ride?\n\n### Initial answer\nSkyler needed to ride 43/5*(116)/5, where 43/5 is the percentage you want and 116/5 is the total number of miles divided by 2.  So Skyler needs to bike [(43/5)(116)/5]. Now I plugged that into the calculator and it comes out to 72.12.\n\n### Input 2\n\nI know how answer can be derived. I just want to know how to come through this thinking.\n\nAnswer: Skyler wanted to ride 50% of the remaining miles while Kory wanted to ride the entire distance; this will be 50% of 26, making it 13. In other words, Skyler should ride 49% of the trip and Kory should ride the remaining 50%. If the two ride 99.99 miles, then Skyler must bike 49997.45 miles, equal to 72.5 miles. Similarly, Kory must bike 9999977.5 miles, which equals 8000 miles.\n\n####72\n\n### Answer:\n\nThe circus monkeys were singing in their cage until the clown yelled \"piano!\" What was the monkey's reaction?

If this happens, the highway will be packed to the breaking point once again and a new highway will need to be put in place to allow for any more expansion.\n\nIf the population of the country is growing, it is possible that the country will begin to spread out and more space for people or businesses will be built. If population growth continues to grow, then the population will begin to spread out farther and farther. The population will eventually spread out so far that some places will only have one or a few people in one place and may even be completely empty.

The fourth step is rolling away the eggs. How many eggs can the Easter bunnie roll away in a minute?\n\n### Response\nThe first three steps take place in a house, so it does not matter the time. The fourth step is where the time comes in, because he can be in a cave (and get to the next step) in 1 minute.\n\n### Input A: The ratio of dogs to cats adopted at a shelter last month was 9:4. At the same shelter, the ratio of the number of cats to the number of dogs that were dropped off by the owners to the shelter that same month was 7:3.  The ratio of the number of dogs to the number of cats that were given away that same month was 8:3.  If 10% of the dogs and cats that were dropped off by owners remained at the shelter, did the shelter have more dogs or cats dropped off by owners? Choices: A: more dogs B: more cats C: equally D: no way to tell\nRationale: When you first look at the situation, you might think that the shelter got more cats than dogs, because if 10% of dogs are rehomed, and the other 90% are given away, this means more than half of the dogs are taken in. However, if you think of this in terms of ratios, the original ratio of dogs to carts at the shelter was 9:4, which is equal to 9/4 = <<9/4=2>>2\nThe next ratio is 9/4 + 4/4 = 13/4 = <<13/4=3>>3 dogs to cats given to owners. However, when the cats and dogs are rehomed or given away, these two percentages cancel out. Therefore, this ration will be 5:3 = <<5/3=1>>1 dogs to 1 cat\nBecause 10% of one number was left at the shelter, each ratio has this 10% removed equally from each. Therefore, the answer will be equally divided between", "answer": "B: pennsylvania"}

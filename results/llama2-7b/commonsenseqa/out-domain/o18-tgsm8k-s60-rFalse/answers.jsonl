I then use the index to be able to access the number of letters (the letter) each user has.\n\nFor the first question, we add the total of each dictionary index to get the total number of letters each user has. Then, we add all the dictionary entries together, and then take the total divided by the first index to get how many letters they have in all (the answer would be the same as taking each total entry multiplied by the first index).\n\nTo solve the second, we start by declaring an index, and an amount equal to the question. We then take each value between the two to find the difference.\n\nFor the third, we create two variables and assign a value to the first, which contains the number of letters taken from the dictionary for this user. We then use that value and calculate how many letters the user has left, based on their dictionary key. For the last user (with index 3), our sum is 26, but we take 100 from that, to get our index as 199, which we use to find the number of letters remaining for this user. We follow the same process for all the users with a different variable name.\n\nFor the fourth, we set our first index to 100, which we multiply by half for 1, and then add half a letter (5) times 2, and add it with a different index (101). Our sum is 1, so we add 1 to 101, and get back to 102. We use 15 times 102 and end up with 1525.", "answer": "A: good health"}

What were the numbers?\nOutput: \n5 & 31\n\n# Exploration\n\nAs stated before, the solution to these problems was to just add them up together, which we call addition. So we are curious to know how addition can help us throughout the problems given.\n\nHere we can visually see the sum of the number pairs:\n\n<center>\n![](pictures/add.png)\n</center>\n\nNow if we can just add all pairs of values together, we can solve each of the problems, which is the goal we set ourselves to!  \n\nIn the beginning when we were given a picture like the one above, we thought that adding each number would produce much longer numbers, and that we could use these long numbers to help solve the problems.  \n\n<center> \n<img src = \"pictures/addingnumbers.png\"></img>\n</center>\n \nHowever, we soon found it is much easier and shorter, to just use addition to solve the problems rather than using the values in that way. This is because there are many ways to add the same value together, and by doing this the problems will not be as hard. I think this is why this works because addition just does the same thing over and over, and the more times it is repeated the easier it is to do. It was also helpful when we used the substraction method because it helped to reduce the same number of times it is used to simplify the problem. We also found that to get the same answer it isn't important in what order you do add them together, but rather by using the easiest method to reach that same simple answer at the end!  \n\n  One thing I learned when using the addition method that could help everyone else, is that rather than trying to use a number that would be easier to remember to store the value, maybe just write down the numbers. Although it is true that for some people it is easier to remember the numbers that they see as they look at the problem, other people have a problem in trying to remember these so if they can store the values, they could then use the other numbers in the other answers to find out what the answer is to solve the other problems. This would make the problems 10 times easier for people like", "answer": "C: college"}

What is the registration fee for a car that holds at least 15, but no more than 20 gallon?\nOutput: $65\n\n### Explanation\n#### Examples 1-6\nSince this is a simple problem, I didn't spend much time on it, but there is one way to determine the total, which is as follows:\n\n```py\ndef one_problem():\n    '''This will give the user the total.'''\n    answer = int(input(\"Input: Janet has n cards more than Brenda, where n = \"))\n    if answer % 2 == 0:\n        final_answer = int(brenda[answer // 2-1])\n    else:\n        final_ answer = int(brenda[(answer // 2)-1])\n    return answer\n\ndef one_problem_and_output():\n    brenda,janet  = input(\"brenda is : \", \"input the value of brenda \");input(\"janet   is   : \", \"input the value of janet \");\n    answer = one_problem()\n    return \"the total is \" + str(answer)\n\n```\n\n#### Example 7\nThe only difference between input \"9\" and \"11\" in this problem is the number of blue chairs. If I simply changed \"9\" to, for example \"4\", it would have solved. However, since blue chairs has nothing to do with the solution, I took a time to figure out that blue chairs should be equal to the difference between the quantity of green chair and white chair. \n\n```py\n\ndef seven_problem_and_solution(input):\n    quantity_of_blue = int(input[1]) - input[0]\n    quantity_of green = sum(input[:-1])", "answer": "E: inaccurate"}

Which value from below shows the percentage change in the average rainfall?\nOutput: (A) 50%\n\n##### Sample Answer\n\n(A) (50%)\n\nThe question asks for the percentage of change in average rainfall.\n\nTo determine the percentage of change, you have to first find the difference between the original value and the subsequent value. Then, you get the difference divided by the original value and multiply by 100. In this case, the original value is 5.2 in inches. Below is the math used:\n\n$$\\frac{\\frac{5.42 - 3.67}{5.42}*100}{\\%}$$\n$$\\frac{5.44-3.67}{100}$$\n$$1.77$$\n\nSince the value above is positive, it increases by 1.77. \n\nSo, the percentage increase in average rainfall is (50%) or 50%", "answer": "C: city"}

(Hint: Think about what might be inside a plane!)\n\n### Solution:\nThe plane is made for people who dont want to spend money on a car and it has its own engine.\n\n### Instruction:A plane takes off and stays in the air only because of air pressure beneath it. There are 4 main forces acting on an airplane: gravity, lift, thrust and drag. Each force exerts different kinds of forces on an airplane. Drag force keeps the aircraft from moving forward, making it hard to take off. Thrust force keeps a plane in the air. Gravity tries to pull an object back into its original position, which is the ground for a plane. Lift force pushes an airplane forward. Thrust is what moves a plane; it is not caused by gravity. Drag is created by wind, which slows down a plane at high speeds. What is the sum of all forces?\n\nOutput: Lift force\n\n### Instrument: A bird's skeleton is not made of bones, but something stronger. Bird skeletons are light and strong bones and a hollow cavity called a sinus, which makes the skeleton even stronger. Birds need strong bones to fly, and if you're not flying at very high speeds you don't need much weight, just enough to keep your skeleton strong and light. You might think that a bird will need to use its muscles to push the bones out of the way, but a bird can use a more efficient way to fly.\n1. A bird creates lift by flapping its wings in a certain way, like this:\n      1. The air flows on both sides of the wing, creating lift.\n      2. The faster the bird flaps its wings, the more lift it can get.\n      3. Birds do this automatically, so the only time a bird's muscles are used is when it runs or walks.\n      4. The stronger the skeleton, the more lift a bird can create.\n\n###  Instruction:The word \"wheels\" represents what?\n\nOutput: A set of solid parts attached to a vehicle, which turns in all four directions\n\n\n### 46.1814%\n\n##", "answer": "B: aircraft carrier"}

It can be solved using a combination of logical thinking and simple arithmetic.\n\nLogical Thinking\n\nThe first step in solving this problem is to use logic to approach it. Since each person has a different number of cards, we can assume that the combined total of all the cards is some number N. And since we don't know how many cards the people have, we can assume that each card has a value less than N.\n\nUsing this information, we can start to narrow down the possibilities. Suppose that X is an unknown positive integer, then X must be less than N because cards can not exceed the total number of cards by more than one. Suppose that Y is an unknown negative integer, then Y must be at least 0 because a negative card is the same as a positive card.\n\nThus, there are several possible number pairs: (N,0), (N+1,1), (N-1,1),... We can think about each pair and use rules of arithmetic to narrow our possibilities and start deducing the final answer.\n\nArithmetic\n\nUsing the information that Pete walked 20 blocks from his house to get to the bus garage, we know that if a block is 5 blocks then the walk from the house to the bus garade is 50 blocks.\n\nFrom this we can also infer that a block is equal to a city block. If the entire walk is 50 blocks, this means that the number of blocks in a city is n blocks, where 50 = n * 5. We can use this information to help us solve other equations.\n\nSimilarly, using the information that there are 1/3 times fewer white chairs than blue and greed chairs combined,", "answer": "B: piggy bank"}

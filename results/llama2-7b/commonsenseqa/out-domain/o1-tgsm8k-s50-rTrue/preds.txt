The programmability aspects became difficult to follow, and I had trouble grasping how programming was actually going to solve the problems and how it was different from a calculator. Though, the hard coding was a learning experience and by the following day's programming, I was able to better program some of the new things I had learned in the first few days. It was helpful to learn the different programs used to solve the problems and I feel I am becoming more versed in coding. My coding experience this week was not a success. The programs I typed did not work at all, but the following lesson did help me grasp the logic behind the coding I was doing.<n>

If the number of letters in my input matches the length of the string in the array, the if statement is true and I say that the input is valid but otherwise the if statement it false and I say that the array is wrong. I did this by putting the number of letters in one variable, that is how long my input is, and putting the length of each string in the corresponding index in the array in this variable called 'lengthArray'.

Choices:  A: train station B: house C: cupboard D: cricket stadium E: surface of earth<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer:A - Train Station<n><n>Explanation:<n><n>Air is made from a mixture of Gases that take some time to mix. So any time you open a bottle of CO2. or a can of C02, or even something like spray bottle of water, the air in that bottle or can has been breathed by people all over the country recently. This is why air pollution is a thing. This is also why we all try to keep germs out of our kitchen and bathrooms. So we know it's not only the air in a house or a car when it's confined, but rather the air in every building we step into. This also answers why it is so hard to go on long flights. You are not only breathing confined air, but you are likely to be on a plane full of people with their own germs, flu, and bacteria. This is all going into your lungs.<n><n>#### A<n><n>Answer:A - train station

How many years were there between when Hurley was born and when Richard retired? First calculate the age difference between Hurley and Richard, then we will subtract that by Richard's age when he retired. For instance, Richard's age was 20 when Hurley was born. It will be 40 years from when Richard retired. So, Richard's age when Hurley was born = 40 - 20 = 20. There were 20 years from the time Richard retired to when Hurley was born, and now there are 20 more years from Hurley's retirement to when Richard passed away. The total age difference between Hurley's retirements and Richard's death: 40 - 40 - 5 years before Hurley was born + 18 years between Hurley retiring and

Choices:  A: football stadium B: apartment C: surface of earth D: car show E: house<n><n>### Response:		<n>The above statement cannot be true for any of the choices. If they lived in a football stadium, they could not all fit in there at once! That's silly, right? If they lived in a car show, they could not all live in the same car. It's not possible for everyone to live in a car. So, the only thing that answers the question, that is not silly, is that they all live on the surface of earth.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>The only thing that answers the statement "Where do almost all people (live)" is the second part of the statement "almost all people (live)". The very literal meaning of where people live is on earth.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>### Input:One might find theirs open, with the letters that had been delivered stolen. Choices:  A: front door B: newspaper C: post office D: package E: mail box<n><n>### Response:		C<n><n>### Description:<n>The "front door" is the mailbox, or location where the mail is delivered.<n><n>The "post office" is located across the street from the "office" of a postman (as it is in the UK), but the post is not delivered by a postman.<n><n>"Newspaper" is not at all close to a "mailbox", even though some editions might be.<n>"Package" would be a shipment (deliverable only by an "office"), not related to the post office.<n><n>But in each case, the letters that have been delivered are stolen from the mailbox.<n><n>The post office is a place for "postmen" (in the United States), or "postmen" (abbreviated to "posties") (in the United Kingdom) and, therefore, that option would better be spelled as the letter E (the UK spelling), rather than as F.<n><n><n>### Rationale 1:<n>The question describes a situation in which one might find their "mailbox open," that is, if an attacker gained access to an individual's mail. The attacker would be likely to have stolen the letters that had been previously delivered, since the attacker would then be in possession of them. <n><n>The word "their" refers to an individual and specifies that the attacker gained access to that individual's mail.<n><n>#### 0<n><n>Answer: Answer: None<n><n>## Problem:<n><n>### Input The best of four<n><n>### Response A<n><n>### Description<n>Two men are playing games and must alternate turns. Choicings: A: Rock<n><n>### Rationales for an answer:<n>They each must alternate turns and each move is designated to be a rock or a sling.<n><n>A= rock.<n>B= sling.<n><n>## Solution:<n><n>### The best of four<n>In this case, it is very clear that answer B is the best option. The description of gameplay is as follows: Two men are playing games and they must alternate turns. The men must decide on which of the 4 available moves to use, each on their turn.<n><n>Each move must begin with a letter, so A, B, C, and D are available.<n><n>Rock would be A.<n><n>Sling would be B

What I do know is that the difference between the answers the three answers with is 8 and the answers that are 88 and 93 add the same number of numbers together.<n><n>Answer: By adding the correct answers you can get 93 but the correct answer is not 98 or 80. As for 88 and 83, the difference is 5 so the answer may be 98<n><n>#### 98<n>Answer: 93+4=98<n><n>### Conclusion<n><n>The answers are:<n><n>Because that is where a lot offices are.<n><n>Grocery stores don’t have offices.<n><n>### Conclusions:<n>Conclusion: <n>I believe the answer is A: school building B. Where are offices located and where a lot of offices could be found is in a school building that also have offices on it. <n><n>Both A: skyscraper and B: business both are incorrect options because offices are located in schools.<n>B: Grocery <n>

Choices:  A: airplane B: ship's hold C: boat D: truck E: train<n><n>### Response:		<n>A: A airplane<n><n>### Dem: Airplanes can fly fast. But the price of a ticket for an airplane is expensive. This is the definition of answer that is a fast but expensive<n><n>### Diverg:If your answer is train, you probably thought that a train is fast, but I don't think the cost is expensive.<n><n>### E: If you thought the boat is fast, you should know that a ship has hold. This does not mean anything. The ship's hold is a dark place at the bottom of a ship, where the ship can put something. If a small cargo is in this dark place, the cargo cannot quickly go to anywhere. The boat is also expensive, because usually a ship takes many tones of cargo at first, and takes a few times for a ship to go to another port. You probably thought the truck is fast because it is an inmediate way. But the truck is the opposite of fast, because I think most of the time the car is stopped for waiting the trafic light or a crosswalk.<n><n>### F: The train has only few possibilities to be fast. I think that the train can only go to fast if it is a high speed train.<n>

The rules for spelling words are that they either have an apostrophe s or an apostrophe (s) to make them possessive (like hers).<n><n>### Other Options:<n>Yes: Because I thought the word "theirs" was spelled "their's".<n>No: Because I cannot write numbers with apostrophes.<n><n>### Examples:<n>#### You answer "Yes" because you remembered the rules for writing words.<n><n>#### You answer "No" because of the number seven.<n><n>There are two rules for making the number "7" possessive.<n><n>Option 1.<n>If the number is part of a larger set, it should not have any type of apostrophe.<n><n>**7 out of 12 people**<n><n>Option 2.<n>If the number comes at the end, it should have the letter "s".<n><n>**Seven (7) people**<n><n>### Output: The difference in ages of two people is their ages together. What is the difference in ages of two adults if they are 18 + 7 years apart?<n><n>### Response 1:<n>Hm?<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>### Answer Option:<n>18 and 7<n><n>### Rationale:<n>I have not been paying attention. If one of the adults is 18 and the other is 7, then those do not add up to 18.

Besides a low fire risk, it is also explosive in powder form, flammable in a 30% solution and can only be burned after it boils. Since it does not dissolves in air, it can only be evaporated. The alcohol must be stored in a well-ventilated place, in dark brown glass bottles, with caps or in plastic containers.

The first thing is the girl that likes to be sad. Why would a movie portray a girl that likes to get depressed, it doesn't portray a good thing, in fact it portrays the negative effects of someone that doesn't take care of themselves. The second thing is the stupid friend that is trying to get better, when he's already dead, and the third is when they were trying to give up hope, then start crying.<n><n>### Rationales: The first thing is, the girl is portraying someone that is sad, because they are actually sad then yes this does come out badly, but if a girl is portrayed as being sad, why would anyone want to see that, unless someone wants to learn more about sad people, this is not a movie, that is supposed to encourage other girls that are sad, this movie will show girls that being sad is okay, so its not fair to say that the girl is portrays something bad,<n>It also shows girls that when a girl is sad, that no one really cares, so is it right to say that its bad? It seems like an excuse, and one could say, that any girl that watches this movie, would see this too, and would want to be sad, or see sadness, in other people, because if a sad girl watches this movie, then she could say that I'm only sad, when the world is in danger, because the world only looks at the negative things, but this sad girl could also use this to her advantage, and then she would be even more sad, and feel even more sad

Choices:  A: music store B: dance hall C: orchestra D: symphony E: tennessee<n><n>### Response:		The fiddle cannot be found playing in a tennessee.<n><n>### Rationales: A fiddle is a violin. 100 years ago tennessee did not exist as a name of a state in the Unites States. It was in the Union of the United States in 1830 and it began by having 8 counties: Davidson, Robertson, Rutherford, Sumner, Wilson, Bedford, Lincoln and Smith. These counties were split into many smaller counties through time: Cheatham, Clay, Dickson, Giles, Houston, Loudon, Macon, Moore, Obion, St. Clair, Warren, and Fentress<n>But a fiddle can be found in musical store, dancehall (tap dance), orchestras, and in symphonies.<n><n>### Input:"I'm going to the book store to buy a grammar book. What else do you need? Choices: A: a pen B: a book C: a dictionary D: a chair E: a pencil<n><n><n>### Response:"A book would be more beneficial to you since a pen is a writing instrument. To improve your writing, a book about grammar could help."<n><n>### Rationale: A good thing about taking the pencil and the pen could be that one you write a letter to your mother and the other, you can make a list of things. But a better tool to improve grammar could be a book about grammar, than a pencil which is only used for writing notes. A pen is an item for writing, a dictionary is an item for grammar, and a chair would not be helpful in any way at the book store, and that's why a book is the best choice.<n><n>### 2<n><n># **2.

Choice a and  choice d <n>is a correct answer for the task.<n><n>#### Ex.6 The teacher gave  homework to her student.The student need to bring in 15 math  problems completed  to make up  for the unfinished homework. <n><n>### Rationale: Since the student must bring in 15 completed math problem, it must be 15 problems  in total. Therefore, he must bring 15/15=1  completed math problem. Since his problem should be  in total, he must complete all problems given.<n><n>#### Ex2.A man is walking to work at 9:00 in the morning.  However, he is slow.  If it takes him 10 minutes to walk 4 miles  each way at exactly the same time, how long will it take him to walk from his home to work 3 times a day?<n><n>### Racionales:<n>The task given say that he walks 10 minutes to reach his destination. It means that the man walks 4/(4+10) = 1/5 of mile in 10 minutes. It implies that if the man walks from his home to work in 10 minutes one time, he will reach his destination at the end of 5 minutes (of a mile  walked).<n>Since the man walks from home to work 3 time in a day, he need to walk for 3 times to reach his destination. Therefore, it will take him <n>3x3=9 minutes to walk from his home  to his work. <n><n>## Questions<n>### 1.

For example: For the average age of 27, and for 3 days, you divide the 27 by 3, you get 9 and multiply by 7 to get 63 for the sleep time of the week.<n><n>Solution 2: First step is to take Richard and Hurley's age, subtract that by 10, and divide that by 2 to get the average of the two differences. Second step is to take the average and subtract 10 to get the actual age difference you would have had for 10 years. We can now see why Richard is 5 years older than Hurley.<n><n>#### 27<n><n>Answer: 27<n>

Table, floor mat, and rug are possible choices for objects used/found at tables. No object other than a table can be found under all of these choices. The floor mat and rug are on the floor. If there is a table, it is on it. Floor mat and rug are placed on tables. They cannot be used or found under the table as a choice. The floor mat can be used on a table, so it’s not a floor mat that’s used or found under a table. The rug can be used on a floor, so the rug can be used or found under a floor, so it’s neither a table or a floor.<n><n>#### Tablecloth (1): <n><n>### Rationale:A napkin is used, but a napkin is not a table. A table doesn't lay flat, so a tablecloth isn't a tablecloth if it's folded into thirds so it's flat. If it's not on a table, it's called a tablecloth. If there was a napkin with its third fold still on it, it's called it's still on it's napkin ring, it's a napkin.<n><n>#### Table (1):<n><n>### Ratios:When something is said to be on top of a thing, it's a table.<n><n>#### Table:<n><n>### Rations:The definition for a table is not the same for every object.<n><n>### Response:(what is this?)

But the air has not been breathed lately.<n>Air on the surface of the earth has many bacteria. Therefore it is not recommended to touch the air on the surface of the Earth.<n>Likewise you would be unlikely to breathe in air while riding a train. <n>Therefore your best bet would be to inhale air in a house or car, which have not been recently breathed in. <n>#### 1<n>Answer: B<n><n>### Input<n>How many days of the week do you have available to you for use during a two week long vacation?<n><n>### Response option: <n>If you do not have as many days as you need to vacation during two weeks, you will have to take two weekends off of work. Therefore your best bet to take two weeks off of work would be by taking two Friday's off of work and two Monday's off of work (not Saturday's).<n><n>### However, you do have the option of taking three days a week off of work, so in my response I will choose option 3 days off of work using Monday through Wednesday.<n><n>### One last thing to realize is that if you take Monday off of work and then a Friday off of work, you will be off of work for 3 days total.<n><n>```<n>If the Monday you take off of work is also the Monday of your vacation, you will be out of the office for four days.<n>```<n>As I have already made this decision, I will only be considering taking two days of Monday's off of of work.<n><n>### I will also assume we are going to work with 5 day work weeks<n><n>### If we take into account the four and three day vacation scenarios, we could in fact only take two days off of work (Friday and Monday).<n><n>### With the correct combination of days each week, we can take 10 weeks off of work within two weeks.<n><n>### The remaining number of days to take off of work over two weeks is 60 minus 10 = 50 days.<n><n>### However we need 12 days off

You can't put food into the oven, but you can make food, if you have the ingredients and a stove and a dishwasher. You will also need people to clean the food when you make it. It might be a good idea to buy it from a restaurant or use some left over food from other meals which is already cleaned, or you can hire someone to clean it for you (I think that's called dishwashing).<n><n>### Response1<n>I guess I could clean my stove and then spray the food with water on it, but I'm worried that someone might be eating when I burn the food. I hope the problem gets taken care of soon, but it sounds like he isn't doing a very good job of taking care of it.<n><n>#### Answer: 16<n>I guess I could use the food like he does, but it doesn't sound safe<n><n>#### Answer:13<n>I agree, it sounds like it's getting better and that the problem will be taken care of soon, the man is doing a good job, but that's not the answer to my question.

Choices:  A: sitting down B: excitement C: tiredness D: progress E: procrastination<n><n>### Response:		What do you think they mean by sitting down? Maybe they mean sitting with your pencil and paper, legs uncrossed and relaxed and maybe sitting at your desk. We also often procrastinate when we sit around doing nothing, get bored and go do something else, not because we have difficulty beginning work, but because we have difficulty doing work. So if that is what you are having difficulty with, I would say you are suffering from procrastination, but if you have difficulty staying focused and on track, maybe you are suffering from a lack of excitement which will keep you motivated to get your work done.<n><n>### Solution:<n>C: tiredness<n>

Choices:  A: fraternity house B: bank C: big town D: big city E: building<n><n>### Response:		E<n><n>### Explanation:<n>The billionaire donated money to his former college, and with that money they were able to construct a new building. A fraternity is a smaller building within a big college, so that does not count as a valid answer. A big town is a big city, so that does not qualify as an answer. A bank is a building, but it is not a building that a college can make. A bank is built by a bank, and it is not a building the college will be able to maintain. The correct answer is a building. It did allow the college to construct something, so the money was spent on a building. This is not a building that is smaller like a frat house, but a big building that is made of many small buildings put together. This is a building that can sustain a college, and it is a building that the college owns.<n><n>### Input Choices Choices:  A big town B: a big city C: a building<n><n>### Answer Choices A: a fraternity D: a billion.<n><n>### Exact Explanations:<n>The options can get a little confusing because the terms they are giving you for answers are big. A big town is essentially the same thing as a big city, and the big is supposed to indicate that there is a lot to either. Both terms are referencing the same location of which the college can construct either a building or a town. Both are a large location that is much more than merely a building. The billionaire donated money and that money was spent to build something. <n><n>### Choice:<n>The college donated one time a large amount of money which is why we can say it is a single sum. They are being asked for the name of the building, so we can call it a bank. The billionaire donates money, therefore, we can say the sum of money is a billionaire.<n><n>### Name:<n>Hugo Banks<n><n>### Input<n>1 + 3 = 4<n><n>### Expected Output:<n>4<n><n>### Answer:<n>4<n><n>

Thus, 100/4 = <<100/4=25.<n><n>Its total sales per day will be ((100)*$4000/<<$40000 = <<40000*100/40 = 10,000 = $16.66/<<$16.66 = 1000/<<1000/=$1,666.66/1000 = 1,666 = $1666.67))<n><n>If I have 10 waiters and 10 chefs.

Choices:  A: new york B: concert C: tv studio D: gig E: recording studio<n><n>### Response:		D<n><n>### Explanation:<n>A microphone boom is used to cover a loudspeaker from a specific direction.<n>A boom is used in a concert to focus the volume of sound from a microphone to one location, which creates the live sound from concert events.<n>A microphone booms are also used in TV studios (where they are sometimes called a boom operator or a stand-in) to focus and pick up the sound from a microphone.<n>Microphones in a recording studio are most commonly covered by a boom during recording a piece of music that needs the volume to be covered from one specific direction.<n><n>### Additional Information:<n>A microphone, also called a mic, electret mic or mic pickup, is a transducer that converts acoustic energy into an electronic signal.<n>Microphonic feedback occurs when the sound of a microphone entering a feedback loop is audible.<n>The term is occasionally misapplied to describe loudness. Loudness is a perceived quality, not a measure of the signal being received by the microphone itself.<n>It is not a property of the microphone so there is no such thing as microphonic feedback. Any microphonic feedback in a loudspeaker system is caused by an unwanted direct signal coupling into the amplifier from another loudspeaker via an electromagnetic effect called electromagnetic coupling.<n>A loudspeaker is a transducer which takes an electronic signal and in doing so creates an acoustic wave which can be heard by a human microphone.<n>Electrical noise is a random variation of an electronic signal having a frequency that is greater than that of the electronic signal, which is caused by electrical devices operating nearby or nearby electrical wiring. This also covers acoustic noise, which is caused by other people talking.<n><n>### Questions:<n><n>### 1. What is a vocal booth?<n><n>### 2.

Suppose you want to get one character to the right of a substring. One step in the Python substring solution is to first use slice notation, i.e. a character and then an index and then a character. Therefore, given a positive integer, n, which of the following functions might you use to get n-1 characters to the right of the substring starting with a: a[n:](a[0:n], a[-1:]) a[-(n-1):](a[0:-(n-1)], a[1:-(n-1)]),<n>- 2.: How could you use the same a[] substring, without using slices, to obtain a slice where the first (a) element is the same as the substring but the last (a) element is all of the characters to the right of a?<n><n>#### 1)A[n:][1:-(n-2)] :<n><n>\[a[n:][1:(-n-1)]...\]<n>\[ <n>a   b<n>c   d<n>\]<n><n>#### 2)I can only use slices to get to the end of the string or if it is empty. However, I can use the Python built-in function, len, to get the lengths of all the elements. It is much more efficient to use len because I don’t have to keep track of the index. len() is a built-in function that can be used by a for loop to get the length of any string in Python. Whenever we run the code inside the for loop, the i variable will increase by i+1 and we’ll need to keep track of that value.<n><n>```<n>for i in range(len(a))<n>print(i)<n>```<n><n>After writing the above for loop, whenever we change the len(a) value in the statement, the i value changes. Therefore, we'll have to store the variable for future reference. So we have to declare the i variable into a variable and to be able to increment it by 1. We'll try

You want to convince your reader that whatever you ask him/her to do or choose is the best option. To do this, you usually start with an attention grabbing statement that draws the reader in enough to read on. Next, you include evidence to convince the reader that what you state in your premise is true. For example, if you ask or convince the reader to recycle and include evidence that supports your statement, you will convince the reader to support recycling. Your evidence can include stating that recycling is healthy for the environment. Then, in your conclusion, you include a restatement of the premise and restate the desired action along with any reasons why your reader should perform the desired action.<n><n>#### 124 219 (Answer)<n><n>### Instructions:Write the letter of explanation for the following situation.<n><n>#### Situation: In the video you watched, the woman in the back of the line did not pay her check to the bank.

A: 2.45 B: 1.56 C: 2.56 D: 3.56 E: 4.56<n><n><n>### Rationale<n>The correct option is the second one from the bottom, number 2.45.<n>The number after 2 is 2.56 since any number lies 1 whole unit after it. The number between 2.5 and 4 is 2.45, thus 2.56 < 4 < 2.65. Thus, number 2.56 is between 2 and 3. The correct option is 2.46. 1.55 is also correct since 3.56 lies after 3.6 so 1.56 lies between 2 and the first number after 3. Hence 1.56 <n><n>### Response <n>Choices: 1(A): 2.45 2(B): 1.56  3(C): 2.56 4(D): 3.56 5(E): 4.56 Answer: 2.46<n><n>### Your input: What animal produces milk? Cho

To be distressed, you do not even have to learn.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>The inability to learn can cause a lot of different outcomes. You can lose intelligence, education, or even effectiveness. You can also not be able to learn how to do something properly, which means the person will be distressed.<n><n>The inability to be able to learn will not cause the "A stupid" outcome because distress can only come along if you can not learn anything properly, you do not need to be able to learn anything in that case for distress to occur.<n><n>### Input:(1) A single computer can be used as a personal computer, a workstation computer, a computer that is used to connect printers.

There are many ways that computers can be used. However, a single computer can only fit into one of these categories. A single computer can not be used for multiple purposes. A personal computer has one user. Thus, can not be used as a workstation. A single workstation computer can also only be used as a computer that connects printers.<n>### Input: Is the given equation correct? 51 = 5893% 5<n><n>### Response:-<n>The given equation is correct. To find how many percent, 5893/5 = 1178 ==41.7557142857143%, so we can see that this is the correct equation. If you divide 51 by 5893 (41.75) and you will get 99.948%, which is more than 10 % so this is not a correct equation.

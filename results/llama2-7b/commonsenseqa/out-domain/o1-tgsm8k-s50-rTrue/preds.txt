Choices: 1. African rainforests  2. Siberian Mountains 3. Ecuadorian deserts  4. The Sahara Desert 5. The jungles of Thailand<n>Output: It has been assumed, for the most part, that elephants live in the regions of the tropical rainforest. Africa, in particular, is inhabited by most of the worlds' elephants. The elephants that inhabit the rainforests are believed to migrate between wet and dry regions for the purpose of gathering food in the dry portions of the rainforest.<n>This is the reason for their presence in the rainforest and also their presence in the drier Sahara Desert, where they can gather food from natural sources. It is also suspected that the elephant who is found in the tropical regions of the equator could be hunted for its ivory, which is also known as elephant tusks.<n>There are also some elephants, though, who are found in the Ecuadorian deserts and others who are found in Ecuador, where it is believed that the animals could hunt for their own food in the deserts.<n>The jungles of Thai are occupied by elephants who will migrate between the jungles and jungles of other countries, where they are able to gather food. In many instances, however, it is believed that the herd can be harmed by human interference. While the elephants may migrate between the jewels, there are concerns that human contact could cause their loss of habitat. So, it is essential that we do our part to protect the elephants habitats wherever we find them and not disturb the animals by disturbing their homes or by disturbing them. There are many reasons why there are elephants in the rainy, dry and other

There is 7L of water in the tub to start (and the bathwater is lost at a steady rate).<n>Output: The answer will be 6.5 hours if the 2L/hr rate is correct. The reason this is the case is that the bathtub begins with 1L remaining. This initial value is lost in the 1st 30 minutes of the bath. When 2L enters the bathtub in 1 hour, this gives us 2L + the initial 1L for a total of 3L. The bathtub is ¾ full. If the 2L/hour rate is correct then the tub will be full in ¾ ÷ 2 = 4/1 x 60 (total minutes in an hour) = 24 more minutes. So 24 + 30 for the first 30 minutes = 54 more minutes left. The 2L/hr is correct because the bathtub never overflows if the drain is plugged but 60*2L is less than the tub’s initial level of 6, the water begins to pool in the tub if there is too little water. So the number of hours until the bath overflows will be the difference in how many is in

(B)If the total is not a whole number, add 0 to the last digit so that the total number is a whole number between 5,001,000 and under 4999,900. (C)Store the array in a string variable called final_students with the content of the array. (D)Print out the content in final_students<n>####################################################################<n><n>### Question:(1)Write a method called studentsElapsedTimeToFindHomeRange. The number passed as an argument is the length of the line of code that your student is currently on. If your student has no lines of code yet, the number would be 0 and if your student has no lines left in the program, the number would be -1. Use a nested for loop to write a loop structure that will stop when your student reaches home base (line 0 of the program). The loop should only print out the line code that the student is standing in if the line the student is on is positive. If that line of code is greater than 0, print the code where the student is currently located. (2)Write a program called FindHomeRange that will use the FindHomeRange method in the class Student with one argument: a Student object that contains all of the data that is necessary to find the home range of a student's position. Note: Make sure to understand how to print out the contents of an object before you create any code for finding the home range of each student.<n>############################################################################<n><n>##############################################################<n>### Question:Answer the following 4 multi-part questions.<n>### Question-1:<n>### Instructions:Write a method and class called Student.

If you have your plant inside the home, it may be susceptible to drafts from the windows and the air conditioner. <n>Thus, it is necessary that you know your plant’s characteristics. You will need to learn what kinds of drafts to avoid and what kinds of drafts it tolerates (if any). It may sound daunting, but you will learn to become a good houseplant parent when you know how to nurture your plant and when to put it away for the season.<n><n>Plants need certain temperature to grow, and if the temperature in your home is too extreme, it will cause some or your plants to die. For instance, <n>most plants can tolerate a daytime temperature of around 70°F to 90°F.

For example, in the C language, you can declare a variable like this: int counter = 7; When you declare a variable, it reserves some memory (some amount of RAM) for the type of variable you have declared. For example, if you declare an int variable, that variable will reserve 4 bytes of RAM for storage.<n>For some types of variables, there is an upper limit on how much memory can be reserved. For example, there can only be 2 billion int variables of size 4 bytes, because an int variable is a signed integer, and can thus address 231 values. In any language that allows multiple ways of declaring variables of the same type, the default ways of declaring variables are typically the most flexible, in that they allow for the greatest amount of memory to be used.<n>In other languages, the only way to declare certain variable types is by using the keywords or values for those type, such as x = 7 for an int variable. For example, if someone wanted to declare a float variable, they would have

Choices:  A: downtown area B: urban area C: new york city D: shopping mall E: military base<n>Output:		D<n>C. A shopping mall is a large shopping center where various stores are congregated together.It usually has its own parking lot and is situated outside of the city.<n>In contrast with an urban area, which is a large residential area contained in a city, shopping malls usually have a wide variety of stores selling to people living in the suburbs.<n>Also, a downtown area is a large populated area in a city in proximity to major points of interest.<n>Since a downtown area contains many businesses, it is often a tourist area.<n>A military base is a large enclosed military compound generally located in an undeveloped part of the country.<n>It may act as a residence for the military personnel stationed there, and there may be open areas on the base for sport and recreational activities(like fishing or hunting),and other open areas to store and maintain military equipment and vehicles.<n>A theater is a large building with staged entertainment(plays,musicals,concerts,etc.) and movies. Theaters may be part of a shopping mall, or they may be built separately.<n>This means that a plaza contains other businesses and a theater.<n>It has a parking lot and is a residential area outside of the city in a suburb.<n>Since a plaza is a large open square in a city, the shopping mall is not contained in the city's downtown area, but outside of the city in the suburbs on a large open square.<n>Hence, the correct answer according to this definition is D. Plazas are often located in cities along with a shopping mall and a theater(these stores also don't typically contain any military bases or business centers).<n><n><n>### Instruction:Implement a function called "get_data" that takes n as an argument.

In order to solve it we had to analyze all the inputs to see if there was a unique answer or several similar solutions.<n>  - For this problem, there was only one solution: 12<n>    - Since the result of the addition must be 12+12 = <<12+12=24>>24, the answer to the problem is the 24<n>    - The solution is _A: 12_<n>    <n>- The next two problems were more about what the programmer wants to do, since I don't know how they solved it.<n>  - For both problems we could use a dictionary to store the answers, if a condition is not met an error can be thrown, and if a condition is met the values stored in the dictionary can be retrieved so we can print them.<n>  <n>- Finally, this last program, to me, looks like a way to check if a value is within a certain range, if not print the error message, in order to prevent from entering a wrong answer, because there wouldn't be a next prompt.

Choices have been provided for some  the questions. Select the best answer choice for each question.<n>> This text is an example of text classification where the classification task is to  classify the text with respect to the predefined categories. This task is the classification  problem defined when we have a set of attributes for each class, and this task  belongs to the supervised learning tasks and we have examples, examples of the set attributes that are used to train the classifier.<n>> In supervised learning tasks, the output labels are either class labels or probability score. In text classification problems, we usually provide class labels for  each example, while in the text classification problem, the output could have two outcomes: one is  class label, and the other one could be the probability prediction of the class labels. It could be given as the probability score, the sum of the probabilities, or as the maximum probability.<n>> Most often, class labels are given in the binary format, either 0 or 1 but can be more than two categories, as well, which are called Multi-label classification in the text classification problems. Text classification is the problem of predicting class labels for natural language texts. Natural language texts are the documents like the texts written in languages, such as English, Chinese, French, etc. We can predict different types of labels for these texts like sentiment analysis or news categorization, news categorization like the classification of news into news categories like the sports, environment, culture, etc.<n>output: The text is giving the examples of text classification, and it shows the problems associated with text classification. This text is an example classifier giving examples with respect to their categories.

Choices:  A: expect to die B: believe in god C: stay in D: watch movies E: eat corn<n>Output:		When the options are:  A: Expect to die B: Believe in god C: Stay in D: Watch movies E: Eat Corn The options, when taken as a group are: Expect to die Believe in god Stay in Watch movies Eat Corn<n>For example, we can express as A, which is expect to die and as D, which is stay in<n>We can now look at the first character of each letter  :  E D<n>Now, we can express E, which is eat corn as E. We can also express the full expression as E.<n>Now we do the same operation for D, which is stay  in.<n>Finally, we do two operations on A. the first operation is inversions followed by  taking the last charcter out of each string, so, for example when we invers e we get is ae and when we we take the last character from it we get is A.<n>Therefore our final answer is: "ae D "<n>Input: The 4 characters are:  A B C D  Choices:  A B C T.D E C E<n>Output: The order of the strings in the order they appear. Our output is A B C D E C E A B C T.<n>If we invert a, we get b a and if we take the last charcter, we get b  For any charcter a ct as a b, the answer is "a b c d e c."<n>Input: The 5 characters are : Z C A T R G  Choices:  Z C A T R D G<n>Output: The string "Z C A T R D"<n>Since when we take the original string, as an input, we get the alphabet string, "Z C A T", that means we now have to remove the remaining 3 characters we have and to end up with the alphabet string we have to remove all of them starting from the last. For example G is the most recent character to be removed in the alphabet of "Z C A T" and to figure it out, we have to figure out the letter that follows it in the list<n>In this case, G is the 5th character, which is D. Therefore the alphabet string is, "Z C A R  " We now have to determine the letter that follows the alphabet string, which is D and we can find that using the last remaining character

Choices:  A: guide children B: understand children C: control children D: care for children E: vent anger<n>Output:		Parents often yell because they want to control their children.<n>## Explanation:<n>There are four basic parenting styles. The parenting style is often reflected by the parent's own emotional state. When parents get angry their voice will rise to make it more believable and the tone gets harsher and harsher. The loud tone will not let the child talk back with the same tone of voice.<n><n>They always want to hear what their children want to say to them.They will always encourage their children to speak up and speak their heart.<n>There are also many times when parents are stressed, parents become angry because of all the tension and chaos. Parents shout and yell to vent their own temper and anger. They often yell to control/guide/understand/care/ etc. Their children.<n>The child is a creature whom parents most love but also most fear, so they often get angry and raise their voice to control their children's temper. Sometimes when they get angry, they shout.<n><n>## Solution:<n><n>My solution is to define four basic parental styles and combine them with different childhood to determine whether they scream. <n><n>### Solution 1:<n><n>my first solution is to use a for cycle to find the children using the different parenting method, compare the different parenting methods and then decide whether the parent screamed.<n><n>My second solution is: I use the four most basic ways of parenting, then I can get the parents in the different parenting categories.I can combine with the children and then get the answer.<n><n>## Solution 2:<n><n># My code in the questionnaire:<n><n>```python<n>    children = raw_input('Which child do you think was most likely to be screamed?

Choices:  A: suface of moon B: building C: bridge D: ground E: bright light<n>Output:		The shadow appears only on the ground or in the dark<n>Finding the shadow:You can see the shadow of a building, tree branch, mountain, or any object when light hits that object (tree branch, mountain, etc.).<n>The shadow is projected on the ground or at the location of the light. The shadow is formed at night or during the day when the sun is up. You can see the shadow on the ground when the sun appears behind the object.<n>But that is not the case for the Shadow of Earth Moon. When the moon eclipse, the shadow of the Moon is not seen on the ground.<n>The moonlight is reflected by the Sunlight, which is invisible to our eyes from the Earth. But when the light of the sun hits the earth directly<n>, we get its shadow. This is the reason that we don't see the shadow of the moon on the earth. <n><n>Input: Which of the following contains a common error:? A: An apple a day keeps the doctor away.

The bike will probably get derailed or fall down and it may also damage the brakes of the bike.<n>The person who asked this question probably never thought of this situation. He probably will get a bike accident because it may be possible to ride a bikey on a 15-degree hill but not really possible.

Cells that aren't moving toward the center get lost in the immature cell matrix. The tendency of a cell to move toward gravity is much stronger than the magnetic attractor of the nucleus and is what keeps the nucleus together at the center of every cell.<n>2) Cells are attracted by the magnetic field of the cell body. They pass through the membrane into the surrounding cytoplasm. However when they are inside the cytoplasm, they are repelled. Cells have to use the cytoskeleton to push them towards the nucleus in order to achieve their goal.<n>3) Cells navigate by using magnets. Their nucleus is the source of their magnetic properties and its magnetic forces pull the cells towards it. The cell is pulled by the force toward the nucleus by the cell’s cytoskeleton.<n>4) Cells follow their DNA to their nucleus. Their GPS system navigates the path they may travel on in the cell matrix

Germs get onto food when people do not wash their hands after touching a surface that has already been touched by the germs that cause disease.<n>When people eat before washing their hands, germs are transferred from the dirty hands to the mouth, digestive tract, and other body parts.<n><n>These germs have been referred to as "spreading disease" although disease does not physically spread on its own. Disease always requires a germ for transmission to occur.<n><n>Food is an important tool to help us live long and healthy lives. It is a powerful tool, it can bring us healing strength and comfort and it can bring us pain through disease spreading bacteria to our bodies.<n><n>Human mouths are a unique system of germ-free and germ-dwelling microorganisms. When foods are eaten, bacteria are transferred to the mouth by the hand after we place food into the mouth. The bacteria then attach to surfaces within the mouth that are known as microbiomes.<n><n>The bacteria that cause disease cannot spread on their own.

However, the highest year that the game of baseball existed cannot be the problem, because it could be as recent as 1977<n><n>### Explain your program.<n>The way I created this problem is by using some simple math.

I then found the maximum of <<20 in 2021, because, as I said, the year 2020 didn't have a World Series and 1976 was the last year that a World Series was played before the pandemic>> 1977, because the year 1976 had no World Series either. Finally, I subtracted the two numbers and found [[2020 in 21, because the year 2019 didn't have a world series due to the world series during the normal year<<2020, so 2018-2021=the first year it was played in 1890, which is the year baseball started, so 2020-

If Hurley is four years old, how old are Richard and Hurley 10 years from now? <n>Output:If the difference in the two ages is 7, and Hurley is four years, then Hurley, for a seven year old, should have a difference (7-4) = <<(7-4)=3>>3 more years until he is seventeen years old.<n>Richards age should be 7+3=<<7+3=10>>10, so to get their combined ages we add both numbers together = 10+10<n>Output:If the combined ages are 20, what is the difference in their ages?<n>Answer: Hurley is 8 years old, and Richard is 12 years old. <n>Input: John is 5 times as old as Emily. In 3 years John<n>will be twice as old as Emily is now. What is Emily’s age?<n>Output:If John is 5 times (5x) Emily's age, and John is 3 more years older, by the end of John's 3rd year John will be 2 (2) years older than the 3 years he had added to their age. John will be >>6>>6 years older than Emily, so in a mathematical equation 2 is divided by 6; therefore 3 years plus 6 years gives you the answer - 9 years old.<n>

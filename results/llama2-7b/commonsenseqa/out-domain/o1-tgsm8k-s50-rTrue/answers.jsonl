It is often called \"free fall\" - which means \"falling fast\".\n\nThe only way you can rush yourself to death, is if you are falling from the moon, or from a spacecraft.\n\n#### D: Explode\n\nThis is definitely the wrong answer.\n\nWhen you fall, you don't explode.

The programmability aspects became difficult to follow, and I had trouble grasping how programming was actually going to solve the problems and how it was different from a calculator. Though, the hard coding was a learning experience and by the following day's programming, I was able to better program some of the new things I had learned in the first few days. It was helpful to learn the different programs used to solve the problems and I feel I am becoming more versed in coding. My coding experience this week was not a success. The programs I typed did not work at all, but the following lesson did help me grasp the logic behind the coding I was doing.", "answer": "C: walking"}

It seems like an excuse, and one could say, that any girl that watches this movie, would see this too, and would want to be sad, or see sadness, in other people, because if a sad girl watches this movie, then she could say that I'm only sad, when the world is in danger, because the world only looks at the negative things, but this sad girl could also use this to her advantage, and then she would be even more sad, and feel even more sad", "answer": "C: hock"}

{"text": "B\n\n### Rationale:\nYou could likely find air that has been recently breathed in a house or inside a car.\nA space shuttle is often filled with air pumped into it. But the air has not been breathed lately.\nAir on the surface of the earth has many bacteria. Therefore it is not recommended to touch the air on the surface of the Earth.\nLikewise you would be unlikely to breathe in air while riding a train. \nTherefore your best bet would be to inhale air in a house or car, which have not been recently breathed in. \n#### 1\nAnswer: B\n\n### Input\nHow many days of the week do you have available to you for use during a two week long vacation?\n\n### Response option: \nIf you do not have as many days as you need to vacation during two weeks, you will have to take two weekends off of work. Therefore your best bet to take two weeks off of work would be by taking two Friday's off of work and two Monday's off of work (not Saturday's).\n\n### However, you do have the option of taking three days a week off of work, so in my response I will choose option 3 days off of work using Monday through Wednesday.\n\n### One last thing to realize is that if you take Monday off of work and then a Friday off of work, you will be off of work for 3 days total.\n\n```\nIf the Monday you take off of work is also the Monday of your vacation, you will be out of the office for four days.\n```\nAs I have already made this decision, I will only be considering taking two days of Monday's off of of work.\n\n### I will also assume we are going to work with 5 day work weeks\n\n### If we take into account the four and three day vacation scenarios, we could in fact only take two days off of work (Friday and Monday).\n\n### With the correct combination of days each week, we can take 10 weeks off of work within two weeks.\n\n### The remaining number of days to take off of work over two weeks is 60 minus 10 = 50 days.\n\n### However we need 12 days off", "answer": "D: train station"}

A fraternity is a smaller building within a big college, so that does not count as a valid answer. A big town is a big city, so that does not qualify as an answer. A bank is a building, but it is not a building that a college can make. A bank is built by a bank, and it is not a building the college will be able to maintain. The correct answer is a building. It did allow the college to construct something, so the money was spent on a building. This is not a building that is smaller like a frat house, but a big building that is made of many small buildings put together. This is a building that can sustain a college, and it is a building that the college owns.\n\n### Input Choices Choices:  A big town B: a big city C: a building\n\n### Answer Choices A: a fraternity D: a billion.\n\n### Exact Explanations:\nThe options can get a little confusing because the terms they are giving you for answers are big. A big town is essentially the same thing as a big city, and the big is supposed to indicate that there is a lot to either. Both terms are referencing the same location of which the college can construct either a building or a town. Both are a large location that is much more than merely a building. The billionaire donated money and that money was spent to build something. \n\n### Choice:\nThe college donated one time a large amount of money which is why we can say it is a single sum. They are being asked for the name of the building, so we can call it a bank. The billionaire donates money, therefore, we can say the sum of money is a billionaire.\n\n### Name:\nHugo Banks\n\n### Input\n1 + 3 = 4\n\n### Expected Output:\n4\n\n### Answer:\n4", "answer": "E: building"}

Loudness is a perceived quality, not a measure of the signal being received by the microphone itself.\nIt is not a property of the microphone so there is no such thing as microphonic feedback. Any microphonic feedback in a loudspeaker system is caused by an unwanted direct signal coupling into the amplifier from another loudspeaker via an electromagnetic effect called electromagnetic coupling.\nA loudspeaker is a transducer which takes an electronic signal and in doing so creates an acoustic wave which can be heard by a human microphone.\nElectrical noise is a random variation of an electronic signal having a frequency that is greater than that of the electronic signal, which is caused by electrical devices operating nearby or nearby electrical wiring. This also covers acoustic noise, which is caused by other people talking.\n\n### Questions:\n\n### 1. What is a vocal booth?\n\n### 2.

Suppose you want to get one character to the right of a substring. One step in the Python substring solution is to first use slice notation, i.e. a character and then an index and then a character. Therefore, given a positive integer, n, which of the following functions might you use to get n-1 characters to the right of the substring starting with a: a[n:](a[0:n], a[-1:]) a[-(n-1):](a[0:-(n-1)], a[1:-(n-1)]),\n- 2.: How could you use the same a[] substring, without using slices, to obtain a slice where the first (a) element is the same as the substring but the last (a) element is all of the characters to the right of a?\n\n#### 1)A[n:][1:-(n-2)] :\n\n\\[a[n:][1:(-n-1)]...\\]\n\\[ \na   b\nc   d\n\\]\n\n#### 2)I can only use slices to get to the end of the string or if it is empty. However, I can use the Python built-in function, len, to get the lengths of all the elements. It is much more efficient to use len because I don\u2019t have to keep track of the index. len() is a built-in function that can be used by a for loop to get the length of any string in Python. Whenever we run the code inside the for loop, the i variable will increase by i+1 and we\u2019ll need to keep track of that value.\n\n```\nfor i in range(len(a))\nprint(i)\n```\n\nAfter writing the above for loop, whenever we change the len(a) value in the statement, the i value changes. Therefore, we'll have to store the variable for future reference. So we have to declare the i variable into a variable and to be able to increment it by 1. We'll try", "answer": "B: dangerous"}

(The opposite of a brother of Z is a sister of Z.)\n- The students are happy.\n- He enjoys reading.\n- She is the wife of her husband.\n- I am not a liar.\n- They are wealthy.\n- Your brother's neighbor is my sister.\n\n### Explanation:\nThe original sentences in bold in their original form means we enjoy reading or we like reading.\nThe opposite would be that we do not enjoy the reading or we do not like reading. This would mean that we are sad or we are unhappy.\n\nYou cannot be the daughter of your father, so if I replace \"I am the daughter of my father\" means that I am also the mother of my father.\n\nThe other cases can be done by replacing it like the example above. This can only be used for a sentence of the form \"S is a B of X\" that is replaced by \"X is a B of S\".\n\nRemember if you are not the brother of your sisters then you must to be the brother of your brother.\nThis can be done with using the sentence \"S is the daughter of X\" that is re-phrased by \"X is the father of S\".

A: 2.45 B: 1.56 C: 2.56 D: 3.56 E: 4.56\n\n\n### Rationale\nThe correct option is the second one from the bottom, number 2.45.\nThe number after 2 is 2.56 since any number lies 1 whole unit after it. The number between 2.5 and 4 is 2.45, thus 2.56 < 4 < 2.65. Thus, number 2.56 is between 2 and 3. The correct option is 2.46. 1.55 is also correct since 3.56 lies after 3.6 so 1.56 lies between 2 and the first number after 3. Hence 1.56 \n\n### Response \nChoices: 1(A): 2.45 2(B): 1.56  3(C): 2.56 4(D): 3.56 5(E): 4.56 Answer: 2.46\n\n### Your input: What animal produces milk? Cho", "answer": "C: cow"}

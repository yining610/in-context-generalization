So he only has 2.70 - 1.25 = 1.45 that he can spend on anything else, including the cheapest option, which is 0.75.\nSo Alex will most likely spend all of his money on the most expensive option, because he can't fit in an extra $0.75 in his budget.\nTherefore, we can get an estimate that he will spend 1.45 / 7.5 = 0.19 on the cheaper option, and 2.70 * 0.19 = 51 cent on the most expensive option.\n\nInput: The owner of a coffee shop decides to raise prices.

He has 5 pounds of bagged dog food and needs to fill a dog feeding station to the brim. If George weighs the bag of dog food, what is the maximum amount of dog food that can be added to the feeding station to the top without adding any water to the feeding station?\nRationales:: George's maximum total amount of dog food amount needed for the feeding station is 5 pounds because five is his only bagged dog food.\nGeorge needs to fill the feeding station to a brim:\nFill an empty jar that is filled to the brim plus overflowing (the full jar). \nFirst, we need to determine the volume of his feeding station. We can do this:\nWe know the diameter of the feeding station and how full it needs to be.\nThe diameter is divided by 2 to make half the diameter of the feed station. \nThe half diameter can also be divided by 2, and the result after dividing is the radius of the feeding station.\nThus, the volume is equal to (3 \u00d7 \u03c0 \u00d7 radius2) = (3 \u00d7 \u03c0) \u00d7 radius(radius) = (3 \u00d7 (3.14) \u00d7 radius2) = radius3 \u00d7 3.14\nSo, radius3 \u00d7 3,14 is equal to 47 cubic inches.\nThen, we multiply the max amount of dog food by the feeding station's volume to calculate how much dog food can be added to the dog food station.\n\n$0", "answer": "B: welcome change"}

They sold tickets for $5 each, and the total cost was $1597, which was raised entirely through ticket sales. How many tickets did they actually sell, if 67% of the tickets were sold?\nRationales There are two ways to approach this task.\n\nThe first approach is to first identify the percentage of tickets that were sold. Since 67% of tickets were sold, 67% of $5 is 3.35. So to get the number of tickets sold, multiply the total cost by 100 and divide by the price. In this case, 1597 / 3.35 = 478 tickets sold.\n\nBecause a ticket cost $5, the money gained from ticket sales is then multiplied by the total amount of tickets sold", "answer": "E: expensive"}

The rent for her two-bedroom apartment is $550.  She pays her rent every two months which works out to $1100 per year, but she earns 10% of her net income each month.  She has $1200 in her bank account.  How much will she need to deposit into her account two weeks from today to pay her rent?\nRationales\nFirst and foremost, the question explicitly states that her rent is $550 every month, which totals to 6000 a year.  Each of these 6 amounts can be found by adding up the month numbers starting from 1 and ending on 6, which is 1+2+3+4+5+6, or 21.\n\nThere are then two other statements in the question which provide a key piece of information.  One of them being how much she pays her rent each month, and the second one stating that she pays her rent every two weeks (which is the same as every two months).\n\nTherefore, Jill pays her rent each month twice per year (2 months out of 12, or every 6 months).  And since it specifies that she pays every two weeks, every six months is comprised of two months out of six (two months being equal to four every two weeks, or 8", "answer": "C: table setting"}

Many people couldn't afford to feed themselves or their families.  One of the ways that you could make money was to trade in animal fur; raccoons or beavers would usually be traded as pelts.  If you got a good quantity of pelts, you can sell them for much more money than you could afford to buy them for.  Some people got very rich trading in pelts.  How much money would you have made if you had one raccoon and one beaver, and you traded them in?\nRationales The value of raccoons was lower than that of beavers. Therefore, if we start with one raccoon and one bear, trading the raccoon for $4 and the bear for $8, we'll end up with $5 plus $6 plus $6 (because we start with one bear and end with two bears).\nAnswer: 17\n\nInput", "answer": "C: castle"}

In the first stop, he will buy gas for an amount of 25% of his gas tank\u2019s capacity, and, in the second stop, he will buy an amount of gas that is 30% of his gas tank's capacity.\nSince John goes 330 miles a day he will need to refill twice, which means he will refill 25% of whatever is left in his gas tank.\nWe can calculate the maximum amount he can buy in the first stop and the second stop by multiplying 25% of the gas he has already bought to get his total max for the first stop and by multiplying 30% of how much gas he already owns and then added to how much gas he can buy and by adding the total max amount he can buy in both stops divided by two to get the total amount he can buy in one stop.

The jetliner refills its depleted fuel tank using a pump. To refill an empty tank, the pump only requires 10 hours of work. After fueling, the jetliner has 24 hours of flight time remaining. The jetliner is flying through airspace that forces the jetliner to fly at 455 miles per hour.  While flying at its required minimimum, the jetliner consumes 100 gallons of fuel per hour. How many hours will it be until it is next refueled?\nRationales It typically takes 2 hours to refuel a tank. Therefore the time taken to refuel one tank equals 2. Refuelling takes 23 hours, so this is how long it takes to refuel 13 tanks.\n13 tanks can then be divided by the amount of time it takes to refuel one tank, which is 2. This gives 13 divided by 2, or 6.5. Therefore, it takes 6.5 hours to refuel one tank. 1 tank can then be divided by 6.5, which gives a result of 1.5. Therefore, 12 tanks require 18 hours to fill to capacity.\nWhen accounting for refuelling, there are 23-13 remaining tanks to fill. Dividing the number of tanks remaining by the amount of time that it takes to refuel a tank, we get 10. So the amount of time needed to refuel the remaining tanks is approximately 10 hours.\nThe aircraft is flying at an average speed of 455 miles an hour.

We can conclude the statement that, if the quantity is \"uninfinite\", having an unlimited quantity of bananas would then necessarily mean having the quantity of bananas with the value of \"infinity\". That is, no matter how many bananas are thrown in the given scenario, there would also still remain more to throw in because the number will never stop increasing and will never run out (since it is unlimited). \n\nFurthermore, according to the question, the scenario given is of the amount of bananas being unlimited, meaning that having an \"unlimited number\" of bananas would mean having any quantity as possible, even infinite. Therefore, there would be no such quantity as \"zero bananas\". Furthermore, for the question itself, it implies that the quantity of bananas that one has must be a positive integer since, otherwise, it shall be considered as 0, which would be considered as \"zero\", which is unlimited.\n\nLet's see a possible scenario.

What is the total number of objects in the box? \nRationales: First, we need determine how many boxes have less than 21 objects. For each box with n objects, we will subtract 1 from each box, because each box contains at least one object. Therefore, if there are n objects, then the total number of objects is n-1. We then add this value to the total of all boxes. \nSo for Box 1, 3-1 = 2 (Note that the original number of objects in box 1 is 3). Box 2, 6-1 = 5. Box 3, 7-1 = 6. After adding the value 2, 5 and 6, we get the total of all boxes: 2+5+6 = 13. The total number of objects is therefore 13. Therefore, the total is 13.\nAnswer: \n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe first box contains 3 items. The first box subtracts 1 from all items, so the number of items in the first box would be 2. Next, the second box contains 6 items. The second box subtracts 1, so the number ofitems in the second box is 5. Finally, the third box contains 7 items. The third box subtracts 1 again, so the number of itemsthe third box has is 6.\nThen, we add 2+5+3. The total is 10.

They charge an additional $50 for each square foot of home to cover the cost of padding, and to cover their time installing the carpet. How many square feet of carpeting must be purchased in order to save the $40000 flat fee?\nRationales:$40000 is the flat rate of installation. There is a $50 charge per square foot, which is charged to cover the cost of the padding and to cover the labor cost. Carpeting companies make enough to cover these costs after every job they make. This is because not every project costs exactly $50 per square foot of carpet. As a result, the company gains extra profit.\nTherefore, in order to completely cover the costs for a job, the carpeting company will charge their customer $50/squarefoot per square foot that there is carpet flooring to cover.\nFor a job with 30000 square feet carpeting, there is a charge of $50 per squarefoot because the cost of the padding is always the same and the amount of carpeting is always the same.\nThis will result in a charge of $150000 in padding. The labor cost is also constant as long as the cost of the padding stays the same. This will result in a labor charge of $300500. Then, the total cost will be $450500.\nTo obtain the answer, we will subtract the flat rate of $4000 from the total cost of $4", "answer": "A: cupboard"}

If each side of a square has 60 degrees of angle, then the length of its side would be 28.28 feet. What would be the area of that square?\nRationales You can find the area of a square (A) by using the formula: A = s*s. Where s is the length of a side. You can find the length of a side (s) by using the formula (2r*sin(theta)) because (s = 2r*sin(the)). You can find the length (r) by using the formula r = sqrt(l/(2)) because (r = sqrt(l/2) because half of the length of the side would be length of that side. Because we want to find the area of that square which is 900 sq. ft, so theta would be 30 degrees (900/9) because since the angle would be 60 degree each, so we will use the value half of 60 degrees. So the length, r = ((sqrt(900/(2)) * sin 30) = 28.2 feet.\n\nInput: Nina has been working as a receptionist in a hospital for 20 years. Each year, she is", "answer": "E: south pacific ocean"}

He works for ten and half hours the next day, but he gets paid for fifteen hours on Saturday. How much money did he make?\nRationales:(1) John makes $12 per hour.\nJohn works for five hours on a Friday, so he makes $12 per [5 x 2 hours], which totals to $60.\nOn the next day, John works for ten and half (10.5) hours, so he makes $60 multiplied by 10.5 = $630.\nOn the Saturday, John works for 15 hours, but gets paid for a total of fifteen hours, so his time value is 20. \nTherefore his salary for the Saturday is $60 x 20 = $12 x 20 = 240. \n\nSo John earned an overall salary of 60 + 630 + 240 = 1,470.

If there are more people at the party, how many slices of cake do each person get?\nRationales (Explanation): The total number of people at the party is represented by $n$, and if $n$ people receive each $k$ slices of cake, that would mean that they divide the slices amongst themselves. When the $k$ is different, the total number slices of cake that these $n$ people get is $k$ times the total number of people $n$ at the party. In case of an odd number of $n$ people, the leftover number of slices of cake would be allocated to each $n$, and then divided evenly between the $n$ people present, in order to make the $k$ slices equal between them.\n\nFor example, if there are 8 people at the party, then each person would receive $1$ slice of cake.

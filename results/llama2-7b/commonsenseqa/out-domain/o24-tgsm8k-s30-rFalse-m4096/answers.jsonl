How many more nuts than whole nuts did Javier have, in total?\nOutput: ~7.1125\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe answer can be derived by rearranging the fraction of nuts by doing the following steps:\n\n1. Start from the first row (2/2=1) and find the corresponding number (96/96=1) on the right hand side: \n\n![](instructions_02.png)\n\n2. Proceed one step to another row (2/4=1/2). Find the corresponding number (99/99=1) on the left hand side and the number on the right hand side is 1.\n\n3. Proceed to the next row (2/8=1/4) and find corresponding number on the left and right hand side: 98/98=1/4 and 1. Continue this process until the end.\n\n4. The last value should be 1 (the same as 2/2) and the sum of each number is 9.0125\n\n![](instructs_4.png)\n\nThe total value is 9.025; a quarter of a nut more than total number.\nThere are other ways to solve this challenge:\n\n1. Divide 3 to four groups: \n\n![img](instructions_3.png)\n\nIf we group the numbers (4+3+4+4), we are required to have a sum of 15, but we can find that sum easily. The sum of each group is equal to a whole number. It is 62% of whole in total.\n\n2. The sum of each number in one row is 1. Divide the number of nuts into the number of rows and we get half of the nuts in each row.

Since this problem does not involve a clear process (which can be observed, followed and repeated) in order to get the desired output, it is not easy to tell if an approach will be successful or not (otherwise, it would have been attempted). Therefore, my main approach was, based on what the interviewer presented, to write programs to solve some of the simpler parts of what I thought it was going to be the problem, and compare the results to the expected ones. Using this as a reference point and based on the interviewer's confirmation of the approach being successful or not, I would build the program from scratch, testing the approach on the rest of the data as I made some progress.

{"idx": 628, "text": "D\n\n### Partial Solutions\n\nIn the first input, the number of days is not stated, so that makes the problem pretty trivial. We can multiply the entire problem by 7 to get 730 as the answer. We could have also assumed 7 days, 11 and 11 * 7 or 77 for the answer.\n\nThe second problem is simple enough. The time is in hours, so the only thing we would need to do is just the time * constant * 60: 40 miles * (60 / 60) / 60 = 40. \n\nThe third problem is pretty tough so I had to skip this one.\n\nThe fourth problem is simple enough too. 16 slices * 7 = 112 slices.\n\nThe fifth problem can be solved fairly easily by doing (3 * 6) - (7 * (1 / 6)) which simplifies to (18 * 6) - 7 = 21 * 6 - 7 = 138 - 7 = 484 (after rounding to 4 digits).\n\nThe sixth can also be simplified by putting the fractions in the denominator for easier math. 30 / (8/11) = 4. Multiplying 4 * 60 gives you 240. \nOr 375 / 24 = 15.75. The sum of the decimal values (1 + 5/12) times 24 =48\n\nThe seventh problem was pretty easy. The number of weeks is 54 and the days is 216. Simple enough.\n\nThe eighth problem can be easily simplified to 10 / 12 * 80 equals 160. \n\nBill spends most of the time sleeping, and so: 4 days * 6hours * 7hours * 7 = 96 hours or 4 days * 24 hours = 96\n\nThis problem could have easily been reduced to: 24 / 12 = 3 * 2 / 3 = 2\n\nLydia's answer is 46 (40 + 6) and Donna's answer is 3", "answer": "E: show appreciation"}

The sum of all elements of the subsequence that contains K or fewer as its least elements is called a K-subset. For example, the K-subset of given sequence contains elements with the least index between 5 and 6, therefore, it contains 5 since 5 is the first element with the least index between K elements.\n\nThe sequence S=1,3,4,5,7,10\nThe possible subsequences are following:\nS3(4+):3 5 10 (this subset contains only four elements so it's a 4-subsequence)\nS3(5+):4 10 (this substring contains exactly five elements so it is 5-subsequence)\n\nThe number of elements 4- and 5- sequence can be calculated from this formula (if I'm not mistaken):\n(n \u2013 3)*n\n\nThen, we gotta calculate the number of elements of sequence where k-sequence has the least number of elements.\n\nExample of k-sequence:\nS1(2+):3\nS3(2+):3 5 (the last number should be one greater than the number of K-subsequence. Here it's the number three)\nS3(3+):3 5\nS3(4+) :5\n\nAfter you get a k-sequence calculate the number of elements from the k-sequence where k+1 element is in the middle of the sequence.

{"text": "student union\n\n#### Explanation: You need to find out how many pages you have left after removing the stickers from the front page and six other pages.\n\nTo find the number of stickers remaining, add 3 large stickers and 7 stickers. This would give you 10 stickers which is equal to 26 pages left.\n\nA simple solution would be to create 2 separate loops and keep on checking how many are remaining. In each loop, we take out all the pages except the front page and the 6 other pages where the stickers were placed. Once there are no pages left, we go to the initial page and add one more time to the count to the remaining pages.\n\n#### Explanations: When Zach has $65 and he only has one way to earn, that could either be through getting paid or by earning himself. We can't multiply 6 by 10 to solve the question that way.\n\nHowever, we just have one variable and can do it this way. \n\n$10 = weekly allowance for Zach\n$65 = money Zach already has \n$100 = cost per bike\n$7 = amount mowed by Zach per hour\n$5 = amount in allowance every week\n$6 = money Zach saved up\n\nSo, Zach needs to get paid $100 - 65 to be able to buy the bike. We multiply $10 * h + $5 in order to fill in 6 and the whole answer. Once we've filled in the $10 h, we get\n\n6 is a constant\n$10 * (65/10) = 6 times a constant of 6 is 6 times 65, which is 390. So Zach made $390\n\nThis question can be solved by the recursive method of counting from the biggest number to the smallest.\n\nMark has total legs by dividing them into kangaroo leg and goat's leg.\nMark has 23 kangoaroos and 3 times that for goat legs.\nSo, the total legs by the kangaroo legs are 23 * 2 = 46.

We will begin at the bottom of the page and work our way up. \n\n- The program must check if the answer is 26. If the answer is 25, then write the string \"Correct\".\n- If the answer is correct in line 1, then continue on with the string \"Good work!\" and make the next line blank.\n- If the answer in line 1 is not correct, then write the string 'Try again!\" and make the next lines \"input\", \"prompt\", \"int\", and a blank line.\n\n#### Instruces to solve exercise 4:\n\n- The program starts at line 2. Read line 2. Check the input against the value in line 1. If the value in line 2 matches the value in line 3, then print the number of dollars into a line. If the integer input in line 2 is lesser than the integer value in line 3 then print the string \"too less\". Else if it is greater than that, but lesser than the value in line 4, then print the string \"try again\". Else if it is not lesser than or greater than the value in 3 and in line 4,  print the string \"to much\". Else, print nothing. If the input is a string instead of an integer, print the string \"must be an integer\".If the input is not a string or an integer, print the number of $5 bills the input is lesser than.\n\n#### Instuctions to solve exercise 5:\n\n- The first line should be \"if/else\".

Define a function named `play_game` that takes in a `basketball_game_parameters`. The parameter should define both teams (with the players assigned), which team gets the ball, and if the game is a home game or away game.\n2. The method should return a boolean that indicates the winner of the game by either calling the function `is_win_for_team` with the winner's team as the parameter or by returning a score and using the built-in `is_higher` function from the `math` module. If the game is a home or away game, the `HOME` keyword should be used instead of the winner's team name.\n3. This function should only be used to call one game per call to `play_game` even if several games are called.\n4. Define a `def is_win_for_teamm()`. This should return the winner of the given game.\n5. If the two teams are playing at home, return the player (name) that is being called from the `play_game()` method. If the teams are playing an away game, return `HOME` instead of the name of the team that is at home. This should be a call to one of the built-in `math` modules' `choose()` function.\n\n#### Part 2:\n1. Define the function play_two_games_part1. This method takes in a dictionary parameter and should call out to play_game twice. Once with each item from the dictionary. The method should return an array list of the names of the winning team members from each game if any, or an error message if there is a problem calling the `play_game` method.\n\n2.

{"text": "A\n\n\n### Problem Description\nWrite a method called sumDigits that accepts an integer and sums up all the digits in the number.\nFor example: sumDigits(593) should return 18.\n\n### Notes\nThis problem was inspired by this [example](https://www.codechef.com/JUN20B/problems/CHEFREV). The example solution uses a nested loop but we want to use a more elegant solution, such as one that uses recursion.\n\nFor instance, let's say we have a method called sumDig(number) that takes an integer as a parameter, and returns a list with the length of that integer multiplied by each digit in that number.\n\n### Detailed explanation\nLet's say the number 593, and we know that we need to get each digit of 593 and multiply it by its respective position. In our example, 593 is 593, so we need 5 * 9 * 3. If we do this recursively, we can use the length of the number as the base case:\n\n```cpp\nint sumDigits(int n) {\n    return sumDigits(n, 0)\n}\nint sumDigits (int n, int i) {\n    if (i == n.length()) {\n        return i * n.digit(i);\n    }\n    return sumDigit(n, i + 1);\n}\n```\nIn our example, if we have two variables, `x` (number to be summed) and `y` (the summed integer), the first 3 lines would be:\n\n```\nx = 5   y = sumDigits (5) = 5 * 1 = 5\nx = 9   y = 5 * 9 = sumDigits (14) = 5 * (9 + 1)\n  y = 65\n    sumDigits (20) = 65 * 2 = 130\n    sumDigits = 130 * 3 = 390\n```\nThe final return statement would be `390`:\n\n### Code\n``` cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n#define int float", "answer": "A: fast food restaurant"}

If you know how to do factorial and you want to see if you're remembering the answer to this question, then watch the course, but don't watch the next video.\nTo get this question, you use Stuff, Then Things, and then more stuff.\nIf we call x mary's stickers that we know she used, then the total number is x * 89.\nTo get x from the text, take the words that you know and do stuff with them.  In this case, since we already know that x is the number of stickers x must be an integer.  We count the words that we know and then we do things with each word.  We know Mary, so Stuff her, which is Mary.  We know got 89 and used 3 large sticky stuff, then we use Then Things to get the stuff that we can't do, then multiply those things.  \n\nThe number of people doesn't matter, you'll want to keep it as easy to read and simple as possible.\nWe're counting the words, but the parent part of Zach's name doesn't factor in.  It may be more useful to consider Zach the same as Zach's, for the sake of keeping the text concise while still providing all of the info.\nThis is the key to factoring out variables.  When you put Stuff in your equation, just put the variable in the Stuff spot of the equation.  We have a question about the number of legs.  We already know the variables, so we'll put Stuff first until the question asked for legs, then put Then Things after we have legs.\nTo get rid of the money, you Stuff it.

(Things get even more confusing when you learn that Sara's brother's friend's name is also Sam, and the same goofy guy at the party is named Sammy. And if that wasn\u2019t odd enough, there\u2019s a neighbor boy named Samson and his babysitter\u2019s name is Sondra.) In case all of those S names weren\u2019t confusing enough, I\u2019ll add one more. My next-door neighbor\u2019s name is Sandra. Her mom\u2019s name is Mary, but she goes by her middle name, Ann. So, I\u2019ll call her \u201cMom-An-N\u201d. My step-sister\u2019s sister is named Anna, but we call her \u201cAnnie-Ann\u201d. It makes things really messy. This makes my head hurt. Fortunately, our teachers help out by keeping lists of everyone's names. (This is their job because we\u2019re all too young to remember them all.) In fact, my list of those crazy names is still in my backpack from last year. My mom will let me take it out and use it to find her name. (My mom\u2019s name is Jan-Marie.)

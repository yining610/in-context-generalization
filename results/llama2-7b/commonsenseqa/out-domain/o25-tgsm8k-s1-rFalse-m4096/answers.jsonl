For example, if Grey says that the % he is of Red is 40% what does his answer mean?\nOutput: There are two variables going on here.  One is calculating the grey's % of Red.  The other is calculating the other dogs percent.  You'll need to use both variables to calculate his answer.  % of Red:  = 40/3 + 35/2/100 + 40/3/110   = 49.4%  % of the other dog:  = 100/35 + 2/9/100 + (100/252/113)   = 30.3%   So 49% grey is 30% of the blue and he is 49% blue is 49% of red.\n\nInput: There is a group of 12 people trying to solve a problem.

First, you can multiply the length times the width. Second, you can multiply the area times the square.\n\nOutput: B: First, you have to find the length and width of the room. Length is how many feet wide or long it is. Width is the measure horizontally and vertically. For length and width, you just square each number. After you square the length and width, multiply them to get the area. If the measurements are in centimeters, you can use the equivalent of meters.\n\nOutput: C: To figure out a room\u2019s area, start by adding the length and width. Let\u2019s pretend that the room measures eight feet long by six feet wide (8\u20196). Next, determine the square of each number, which is a number multiplied by itself. In this case, we\u2019re multiplying eights and sevens, which is 56, and multiplying sixes and fours, which is 24. Together, that means you\u2019d multiply 56 by 24. To finish, you just multiply the two numbers to get an answer: 1,328.\n\nOutput: D: To figure out an area, you\u2019re going to want to first find the length of the shape. Once it has a length, take the width of the shape and multiply it by the length. For example, if you know a house measures 20 feet by 20 feet, you\u2019d multiply 20 by 20 to equal 400 square feet.\n\nOutput: E: If you are told a room\u2019s dimensions without the unit, you can easily convert the information into a unit you want to measure by using conversion factors. For example, if a room is given in feet, you can convert the measurement to inches and meters by using the equation 1 ft = 12 in, and 1 ft = 30.4 cm (the conversion factor for centimeters to feet) to find the area (in ft 2) or the square meter. First, you need to find the square feet of the room. In this case, the room is 12 feet \u00d7 8 feet, which equals 96 square feet.", "answer": "A: strain"}

{"idx": 191, "text": "A\n\nInput:Alice, Brad, Caroline, and David played a game called \"A, B, C, and D\". The game is a memory game. Each person thinks of 1 letter. Everyone tries to use those letters to spell his or her name. If spelling is successful, that person puts an \"X\" and the number of that person's last letter in the alphabet as a score. So for \"Alice\", it would read \"A X 6\". To put an \"X\", the person must be the first to guess the letter that person just said. For example: Alice is the first to guess Brad's D, so the score will be \"6 X 5\" meaning that Brad gets a \"7\" (or 7th letter in the alphabet). If a person can spell their name using 3 of their own letters, they get 3 points instead. For example, Carolinne could say \"C X\" and receive \"X X\". She could also make up a name to spell \"L L B\", receiving \"9 X 1\", since the letter \"L\" is the 9th letter. As can be seen below, the more common letters were used more: Alice, 10 Brad, 9 Caroline, 10 David, 7 David's score: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 11 12 13 14 A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z Alice's score: 3 6 9 6 5 4 4 2 5 9 2 5 5 5 6 David's score: K K L L M M T T M W W S S I I B B O O Y Y U U C C G G V V D D J J B B A A G G X X 9 9 9 7 9 2 7 6 6 1 7 1 1 1 8 4 2 2 2 5 1 1 3 3 9 1 The winner was Brad, with 9 points.

Can you help him/her to use the more formal mathematical description for this problem and show in detail how to solve this problem?\nOutput: In the second year, the students from the first year can be the teachers of some of the first year students. If we define the new batch of students as 1st Year, second year students as 2nd Year, third year students and above as 3rd Year, then the students from the first and second year could be 2^1 as their grade level and their number could be n1. The students from the second and third year could be n2 = n1 * 2^1, and so on. When we use these expressions for the students\u2019 number in the third year = 244 and the student's number in the fourth year = 248, their relation in terms of differentiation are given by 2^1 = x.\nThe new batch of students (3rd Year) could be denoted by n3 in terms of the total number of students in (2nd Year), i.e. n3 = n1*2^1. Similarly, the new batch of students (4th Year) could be denoted as n4 in terms of both the second and third year, i.e. n4 = n3+n2. Since the first year students do not change, after some rearrangement of the problem, n4 can be written as follows:\n      n4 = n1*20 + n3 +  n2\n     \n      10(n3 + n2) + 54 = 20*n1\n      10(244 + 122) + 55 = 54*20\n      10 = 20*(4+6)\n     10 = 80\n    \nThe solution can be written as follows,\n     10 + 244 + 54 + 12  = 120\n    In this solution, since each year comprises 40 students the total number of students for this solution is obtained to be as follows:\n                   244 + 248 + 256 + 260\n    \n     = 1540", "answer": "B: getting full"}

Add the second 2s place digit to 77 and you get 82 (7+7+5+2=19). Now add this value to the 2s place digit of the first number, 72 (0+9=9) to get your 2s place digit and add it to the 3s place digit to get 82. This is not the correct answer.<n>If 222 = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, make 3+digit = 77, then 4+digit = 82, so the answer = 82.<n><n>Input: I want a pen that can write about 800 sheets of paper.

The chef prepared it especially for dinner tonight. I know it's the best I have ever had. So please go for the pizza if you find yourself hungry here. The next day I was still thinking of that special pizza from the Italian restaurant in town. They told me, "We have two new items that were so popular on our menu. And we're going to offer them for a week for only $10 or $15 respectively." So I came and gave it a try. This day was the day I found a special item on the menu. The service was a little slow but I think the food was pretty good. There were only three tables for this location. So I guess they just didn't want to expand that quickly. They wanted to spend all the time they can prepare great food now. Anyway I'm telling you this to say that this place is unique and special for you.

We can use the value of y = 45 cm to find out that room has a height of: 800 cm<n>Let number of people =x.<n>We have an equation that looks like this:<n>x * 800 =45. <n>Dividing both the sides by x, we get 800 = <<45/x>>45/x, and we know that x is a number of how many people.<n>So x= 800/45 = <<800/48>>800/44.<n>We know at least that the number of people cannot be less than 2.<n>Using a number line, we see that any number that is greater than 2 must be greater than the size of the T.V., and any number that is less than 2 must be less than the size of the room.<n>Since x is a factor of 2, both the minimum and maximum values of x is 2 cm.<n>As a result, there must be at least two people, and at most 800/2 = 400 people.<n>So

When the right value doesn’t fit in the length of the previous value, it wraps around. However, if you were to add more than one digit value, such as 825+825+840, you would end up wrapping to the left before eventually adding up to its right side. But what if we only add a certain number? For example, say you were to add 825+375+460, it would go like this: 825+ 375= 1500 460+1500= 300 1500+180=3990 825+960=1845 1845+1500 =3993.<n>This is because 3 digit numbers always end up adding 3 digit numbers, leaving a 0, which ends up at the third number. But what if we add 2 digit and 1 digit numbers? Now the 3 digit number is a starting number, and when it ends, it is also an ending number. So I figured you can start from that ending number, and move further right by one digit at a

Choices:  A: new jersey B: eastern united states C: good repair D: connecticut E: arizona<n>Output:		The question asks for the name of a state. State is represented by the letter S. By writing S=E+N+W, we can represent the name of a state as the name of a number. For Connecticut, S=1+8 which is 9. For Arizona, S=1+2+9 which is 12. Thus, we can represent the number (and the state) by the letters of the states themselves.<n>The answer to A (1+2+4+7) = <<1+2+4*7=28>>28 is Connecticut, the answer to B (9+2) = <<9+2=11>>New Jersey and C (2+8) = <<2+8=10>>Eastern United States are the answers E, and the answer to D (1+3+2+9) = <<1+3+2*9=19>>19 is Arizona<n>So the final answer are Connecticut, New Jersey, Eastern United States, 9, Arizona.<n><n>Input: How much is 200 feet in inches? Choices: A: 24, B: 25, C: 27, D: 29<n>Output: This can be solved as follows: For any number 4 feet, then the answer in inches is always 16 (1*16). For any number of feet between 5 and 7, the answer increases by 9 (1+8*2). In other words, for any number between 4 and 11, the answer is 2^x * 16 = <<2*x*16=32>>32.<n>The answer B (24) and A (16) are correct for 4 (e.g. 24 x 16 = 384) and 5 (e.g. (24 x 15) + (16 x 16) = 384). The answer D (29) is correct for 7 (e.g. [25 + 20*16=386](25+(20*16))).<n>So the answers are 16, 24, 32, 25, 29<n>So the final answer A, B, C, D, A<n><n>Input:

Choices:  A: stress B: nervousness C: smile D: being bored E: making new friends<n>Output:		If someone is aloof:<n>1. Stress (<<A>>) can be defined as the state of mental or emotional strain, as by feelings of worry or anxiety.2. Nervousness (<<B>>), is caused by a sudden fearful excitement. We feel nervous when we are under the pressure to meet our deadline.3. Smiles (<<C>>) are always welcome, it means that we are at ease and have no apprehension.4. Being bored (<<D>>), means that we are bored of the person, a signal that you are not liked by that person. 5. Making new friends(<<E>>), means that that person is enthusiastic and interested in you!<n>So, in this case, someone who is aloof would not feel relaxed at meeting new people. They expect stress (<<A>>), nervousness (<<B> >), boredom (<<D> >) or even be alienated (<<E> >).<n>If a person is self-important, when meeting people:1. They expect to receive a lot of compliment (<<A>>), due to the conceitedness or self-admiration, the ego of a person is enhanced.2. They feel a little stressed, because when we are proud or arrogant to meet new people, it often lead to be a little nervous (<<B> >).3. They can be bored, since a conceited person always feels superior than others and arrogant enough to neglect others. Thus, they have no interest in meeting people.4. They experience being alienated (<<D> >), it is because they always feel like they are better than others without caring and giving something back from their own side<n>So, in this scenario:<n>If someone is aloft, there is a low probability (<<B> >) on them feeling relaxed because they tend to be self-centered and lack of humanity. Their experience of meeting people will definitely be stressful. The probability (<<A> >) that they feel anxious because they expect the worst scenario of their meeting. The probability (<<D> > ) for their being bored is high, because they tend not to care and concern on others. Also, they tend to be selfish, so it can be explained by the probability (<<E> >

Choices:  A: ocean B: symphony C: band D: music store E: music shop<n>Output:		We need to answer whether a musician in the ocean will play a cello. The only instruments we can think of that are played in the ocean are the drum and the kazoo. If a musician in a symphony plays the kazoo, we can assume that we are not in a symphony. Similarly if there is a musician in a band, we can assume that they are not playing in a band. So the only one that we can be sure is in a band is the person playing the cello. If we were to choose the music store or music shop, we would be choosing between the saxophone, kazoo, trombone, tuba, drum, triangle, fiddle and the clarinet. Some of them are played in different places, and we can assume that none of them would be played in a band.<n>So the only answer group that will include someone playing the kazoo is D. So the final answer is D<n><n>Input: In this class there is a person playing the kazoo. What instrument would you like to play? Choices: A: ukulele B: kazoo C: flute D: triangle E: trombone F: violin.<n>Output: Here we need to answer the person playing the kazouwould be, if there is a person playing a kazoo. The most likely instruments, based on the answer group are the trombone and the violin. If there were someone playing a ukelele, then we have to assume that there was a kazoo, and the kazoo player does not play in a symphony, or a band. So the most likely answer would be the trombone. However, there are other answers that we can assume are not true. The person could be playing the drums. However, there is no logical link to the person playing a kazoowho would be playing in the water, unless the drums were in the water with him. So the person playing the kzakoo is playing in water which would exclude the option of A. If you chose music store, E, then there was a person playing a kakoo playing in a shop, which does not make sense. So the logical answer is to choose D. So the final answers is D<n><n>Input：There is a person playing an alto saxophone, which is a musical instrument. It uses vibrating metal reeds, and a player blows air on

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday.

Choices:  A: dog's mouth B: floor C: garage D: trouble E: nature<n>Output:		Answer:<n>Cats can have a habit of getting themselves into trouble. By saying that cats get into things when they are ripping apart things, it leaves room for the possibility of things being things which may be potentially harmful for the cat.<n>So, for the 1st part of the answer, we can say that cat's get into dog's mouth by saying "the cat gets into the dog's mouth", thereby choosing choice (C).<n>The 2nd part of the answer has the answer being "nature" as "garages" are not necessarily a nature thing. The same is also the case for answers "garage" and "trouble". Finally, "floor" is most definitely not a nature thing to say, but a "nature" thing is an "eating stuff", which is not necessarily a thing that happens when a cat is ripping apart things. Therefore, only "nature" will be the answer (choice (E)).<n>The 3rd part of the answer is simple, as the person would either be putting the other things in their mouth or their garage as well. Therefore, as the 3rd part is "nature", it means they won't be putting the things into their mouth, which automatically makes it "garage" (Choice (B)).<n>So the final answer will be Choice (C) - Garage.<n><n>Output:Today, I'm going to the zoo.<n>What am I going to do there? Choices: A: Have some cheese B: Have some fun C: See some cats

Choices:  A: person B: species C: artichoke D: all mammals E: live animal<n>Output:		To answer this question, we should consider each of the choices.<n>A) a person could be a caring individual, but we could also consider each of the other choices, a species, a caring mammal or an artichoke.<n>From the choices, Artichoke doesn't have a heart, or the ability to feel, which makes it impossible for it to be a caring heart. We are left with person and mammal.<n>Though mammal is a type of animal, the definition of that particular type of animal is the one cares of the animal. Hence it's impossible to exclude an animal.<n>The question's conclusion is a live animal. Though it has both a heart and caring, it needs a caring heart.<n>So the final conclusion is that person is the likely caring heart.<n><n>Input: The value of x = <<math> =9>>9 to the nearest place.<n>Output: The place value of 9 is 9. There is no digit before 9. Multiplying or reducing 9 by any digit, the number doesn’t change it’s value.<n>So the final value of x after changing the place value of the number 9 is 9<n>

Choices:  A: feel cold B: feel pressure C: feel bumpy D: itches E: feel clammy<n>Output:		Let's assume D is correct. Then let x equal the length of skin pinched in something.<n>x feels bumpy.<n>Pressure = P = Pressure / 1 ft/min and pressure = P = P / 1 ft/sec<n>P(inches) = <<P(inches)=(P/1ft/min)/1ft/sec>>1ft/minft/sec)<n>P / 2 = <<P/2 = P/1ft/min>>1ft/min<n>P / 2 ft = <<P/2 ft=P/1ft/sec>> 1ft/sec)<n>We're looking to find how long it will take the feeling to start. This means we're looking for:  Pressure / 2 in ft.<n>Pressure / 2 in  = <<Pressure/2 in  = (Pressure/1ft/min)(1ft/sec)/(2ft)(1ft/sec)>> (1ft/min) / (2ft)<n>Pressure / 1 in = <<Pressure/1 in=P/1ft>> Pft<n>So this means the skin pinched in something will start feeling pressure in 1in about D, which is about 16 seconds.<n>To check this we go back to the question for more information:<n>Pressure = P<n>P = 0.2 ft/sec (The average feel of bumps in people's skin)<n>16 seconds * 1 = 16s.<n>So this means there is a 25% chance x will feel bumpy in less than 16s. <n>So after a second, the probability of bumpy increases from 0 to 0.25. After 20 seconds, we've reached a probability of 0.7142857. That is, 71.4% of the feeling is still bumpier. We can check to make sure we're not wrong. At 0, there would be a probability of zero, which means there is a 97.8028372% probability that it won't be bumpy on the left arm. At 1, a probability of 0 is reached, which mean there can be a 100.0% chance the feeling will be bumpy in 1

However, gravity might not be pulling the apples down evenly or even fast enough to result in 10 - (X = <<10-X=0>>0 apples in the original context.  Gravity may still be able to be a factor in this problem, if you assume that it is proportional to how far off the branch the apple is.<n>In this context, it's more like there are 10 app on the tree and 3 are now falling from different heights, and we don't know exactly how far they will fall, nor how quickly.

The difference between the digits of of the number is 15-10. The tens digit of the number 15 is 15 minus 15-1. The ones digit is 5. We know we want to change 5 to 2 so we multiply 5 to 2/5 but if 5 did not become 2 it just would become 10 so we just would add one to 5 and that way 15 would not have changed so we can just add 1 to one. After we do that the difference between the original number and the new one is 9 because we add 1 the new one is 101 so they are 9 apart. This makes the original number's one digit 5 because since we have 9 we can just subtract 9 by 2 because 1-9(the ones digit) or so we did substract the ones digit to the original number and we get 2. This happens because if we wanted to make 56 we would have to make the tens digit = 5 and the ones =6 or we would add 1 because if we add 2 they would be a four and not just 56 this would happen because we did not want to make a number less but just make it double and since we added 1 to make it a five we add the number to the left and the number on the right and when we add them this will be 71 and that is our final answer.<n>

A rectangle is not a square, as it has four sides, not 4 corners. A circle is not a square (because it has 1 continuous line along the edge), and a triangle does not have four sides. The only thing left is a trapezoid, so B is the correct answer.<n><n>Input:The car has 4 wheels. Choices: a: the bike has 4 wheels as well b: the car has 8 wheels c: the bike has more wheels<n>Output: Here, you have to use some logic. A bike has two wheels, while a car has four. Since there are fewer bikes than cars, the car has fewer wheels than bikes. Therefore, if the car has 4 wheeles, the bike must have either 2,3 or 4 wheels. However, if the car has wheels, so must the bike. Since it has less wheels, the bike can not have two wheels, three wheels nor four wheels. Therefore, if the bike

To know science, first we need to know what science is. When scientists do their studies they work with things on earth like plants, animals, rocks, or water. They also work with things in space too like planets, stars, the sun, moon, and the universe. Things on earth and things in space are called natural things. Science is the study of how natural things work. But do you think science is something for scientists only? No, it's for everyone. The scientists tell us things from space and give us information about the world around us. These are facts learned from science. We learn about science in school. We learn the basics at a young age, like math, reading, and writing. But we should know how to use science in our daily lives to make good choices. We make choices about how to take care of our planet, how to keep ourselves healthy, and how much to eat.

He wanted to spend more time there, so that he could study the exhibits more.   He was a very academic person and loved doing what? Choices:  A: tired feet B: gaining knowledge C: back pain D: being bored E: pondering<n>Output:		After observing and understanding what each option is, the only one out of the choices that accurately satisfies John's purpose to spend more time at the museum is E: pondering. A: tired feet would most likely be a byproduct of John being at the museum too long, as he would be on his feet a lot for study,  B: gaining knowledge would be a result of John thinking about what he has gone through, so it would not make sense for him to be physically tired.  C: back pain is not an option as John would probably be sitting most of the time studying, although tired feet might come into play.  D: being bored might not be satisfied as John being at the museum for too long could give that option.  So the final answer is E: ponder.<n><n>Input:  A 75 foot ladder is placed so that  that it  touches the two buildings   directly  across from each  other.  The end  of the ladder rests on the top step of   the two leftmost buildings,  and the  top of the ladder touches the top   of the two buildings directly   across from each other. The last step the ladder touches has  number 323 on it.  How many steps are on the ladder?<n>Output: Given the options, we  see that 323 was on  the last of 75  steps. Using our understanding of the statement, we find that  the distance between the two buildings is 14.   Since we also know that 14 is a multiple of 5, we  see that there would also be 5  rungs on each side of the ladder.  Thus, there are a total of 5 rungs on the  ladder.  So the final answers is 5<n>

Choices:  A: notoriety B: emotional distress C: riot D: bad dreams E: annoyance<n>Output:		The correct answer is D.  Embarrassing situations, such as public embarrassment, are almost always followed by the feeling of annoyance. An individual feels compelled to tell others about the embarrassing situation because such an act will alleviate some of the emotional distress that the  individual is experiencing. As we all know, however, individuals do not like to admit mistakes, and such an admission may lead to an emotional distress. A. notoriety is a term related to having a prominent role in the mass media, and that is often used to refer to celebrities. B. emotional distress is the feeling of being overwhelmed and depressed. The feeling of being depressed is likely to grow, since there are only two ways to alleviate the embarrassing situation: admit your mistake (which may lead to emotional distress) and make it a joke (which may lead to notoriety). C. riot is  an uncontrolled violent disturbance that leads to damage to private and public properties. Riot is an extreme form of vandalization of public and private properties, and individuals, especially those in leadership positions, are often held accountable for riots. D. bad dreams are those dreams which cause individuals to experience emotional distress, which is similar to the situation of being embarrassed. <n>So the final answer to the Input is D

Also, the verb form must fit the subject of the question.  The subject is a person, so the answer must be a verb that is appropriate for a human being (such as 'achieve', 'discuss', etc.).<n><n>Input: A dog named Tyson has 7 puppies.

I suggest you explain the output thoroughly in the problem, then the reader understands what is given and why. e.g.<n>We look first for the total of books that were sold.<n>\item Your first example is a bit confusing. I am not sure if `Tapanga` and `Corey` in the problem title are suppose to represent people or what. I'm not sure what the relationship between them and the number of candies Corea has is. You might want to give a brief introduction between them in the problem text before you get to the math.<n>\item The second example is quite long. I suggest you make the problem a bit of smaller, then a longer statement will go better with the idea.<n>\item Your third example is quite simple, but you might want to explain in-depth what the original problem is first.

Choices:  A: attached B: nostalgic C: companionable D: likely E: close<n>Output:		A: This answer choice would be a great description for someone who likes their remote, since both of those words imply attachment to something (for example, attachment/nostalgia or companionable/close). However, this is the wrong answer since the question does not mention a remote at all.<n>B: Although this word is in the question prompt, the answer choice incorrectly assumes that the "someone" cares for the remote, so it cannot be the right answer.<n>C: The word "companionable" is a possible option, but it must be combined with "close" to have the same meaning as "close (to somebody)." Also, the correct answer does not mention the use of a remote, so "companionable (to somebody)" does not fit.<n>D: This is the right word since it refers to being close (or attached) to someone. However, the question never mentions how that person feels about their TV or remote.<n>E: This word also refers to being attached, but the question never indicates how the person feels about either their TV or remote.

Choices:  A: training B: satisfaction C: injury D: beauty E: late<n>Output:		If this was a spelling sentence, I would just change the 'Pet's' to 'Pet' and be done. If this was a grammar sentence, the preposition 'Pet's', when trying to apply it to the rest of the sentence is not acceptable. 'Grooming pet's nails' is incorrect because of the plural noun 'pet' and as well as the plural noun, 'nails'.<n>This sentence is not grammatically correct so I'll try to explain why... <n>Sentences, especially those of the simple variety, are a way to represent complete thought and an important part of the English Language to communicate. Sentences do not need to be long, though they should be grammatically correct. The first part of correct grammar is, of course, correct spelling. Let's move on from there:<n><n>1. A sentence begins with a capital letter and ends with a period, exclamation point (!) or question mark (?).<n><n>2. Words are separated with a space.<n><n>3. Each part of speech has it's own way of being expressed in a sentence - nouns, adjectives, adverbs, verbs, prepositions, conjunctions and interjections all require certain phrases, sentence structure and placement in a sentence.<n><n>Sentence 1 - nouns, proper nouns begin with a capital letter.<n>If I gave you two choices: 'Eat the food' and 'Eat f food', then no one would really want to eat the food.<n><n>Sentences 2, 3 - pronouns and prepositions show an association between nouns. They are short, but often necessary to convey your idea.<n><n>Sentense 5 - noun, pronoun, verb, preposition combine to create a well formed, complete sentence.<n>Sentances 6 - 7 - adjective, verb, adverb, pronoun show a close association. The pronoun (or name of subject) precedes the verb, preposition and noun.<n>Sentence 8 - a subordinate clause that does not convey complete thought is a relative or adverbial clause.<n><n>Sentances 9 - 11 - noun, preposition.<n>Sentences 12 - 14 - more noun, preposition combinations

Let w denote the cost of a hotel room. Let s denote the speed of a plane. Let time denote the travel time between the home and the destination.  p*s*w/(time^2)  = <<p*s*w/(ime^2)=>> time * p * s * w, where p*s*w represents the cost to the person and time*p*s*w represents to cost to the companies.<n>So to arrive at the final answer we substitute the correct coefficients and solve. We get 51,597 = <<51,598=7902>>7902, so p*s*w = <<51,392=7902>>(time*p*s*s)*w. So the total cost does not equal w, but rather, = 2w.<n>So the final conclusion is that the total cost to the person is 2w.<n>

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday.

You can eat one sausage every 5 days for the next 25 years. How many eggs and sausages can you eat? Choice: A: 42<n>B: 216<n>C: 341<n>Output: If you can eat up to one sausage a week for 25 years, you can eat either: 191 sausages or 208 sausages, of which 18 would be eaten during the first 5 years.<n>So with 208 sausage eaten in the early years, you will have 119 sausages left to eat after 25 years.<n>However many eggs you can eat is simply this number, minus 25 eggs (since you can't eat too many eggs in a week, I've decided to simply round down to 216). Adding to the earlier calculation, you can eat 216 eggs and 119 sausage over the 25 years.  Thus, the answer is 341.<n><n>Input: There is 3 bananas, 2 apples, 1 orange & 5 pears in the fruit basket.

Which coins can you use? Choices:  a: 1 quarter and 1 dime b: 1 quarter and a nickel c: 1 quarter, 1 nickel and a dime d: 1 nickel and 1 dime e: no coins<n>Output: The answer choices do not include any combination of quarter and nickel because 1 quarter is equal to 25 cents and 1 nickel is equal to 5 cents, so 1 quarter and a quarter would be 29 cents and 29 - 25 = 4 cents. The quarters and nickels do not add up correctly because of this. 1 quarter + 1 nickel = 25 + 5 = 30 cents.  We can eliminate B because that does not add up.  We can also eliminate C, because 25 + 10 = 35, which is not correct. To eliminate E, we add up all the possible coins and the total is 29 + 4 + 10 =33  cents which also does not add up.

He sold 60 on Monday, 10 on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday, 44 on Thursday and 66 on Friday. How many books were not sold?<n>Output: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>So the final answer is 600<n><n>Input:i like to examine different things,why do books the chapters on the back Choices:  A: examine thing B: go somewhere C: knit D: read book E: see particular program<n>Output:		Answer: Examine things.<n>I is the first letter in Examine things, and E is the last letter.<n>To examine things, we like to go somewhere, so Examine things → Go to somewhere.<n>To examine things to knit a book, we need to go somewhere, so the first letter of knit is K, which stands for KEep EExamining.<n>Therefore, Examine things → Keep Examining → go KEep EExaminig.<n>To examine things by reading a book, we need first to go to somewhere and then come back, so the full sentence is<n>Examine things → read book → go somewhere → read book → go back somewhere → read book → finish reading book.<n>The book has to be read in order, so let each read operation have n operations.<n>Knitting is only done in the bookstore, so the examining of books is done outside the book store.<n>So if t is the time spent in the book store, f(t) is the time spent examining the books outside of the book store, and n is the number of ways, we find that<n>t = f(t) + n * t<n>So there are at least 6 books to do the activity, so we set a bound of n at least 6, so<n>t = f(4) + 6 * t = (4*6 + 4) + 6*t<n>Which simplifies to<n>t = (24 + 56) + 6* t<n>The full sentence is the one where the "examining" is on the front and the "going" is on the back, so if c does mean front and b does mean back, then a and b are swapped, so the formula now becomes<n>t = (56 + 24) + \t<n>Which can now be simplified to<n>t = 80 + \t<n>The full sentence can now be found by the following steps:<n>1. Examine Books: Go KEep EExAmining, ExAMine go KEep EexAmining, go to somewhere, go KEep Examining, go Kep E exAmining, go K E ex A m I n I n G, go to somewhere, go to somewhere.<n>2.

An action or performance that is done or carried out as part of the formal or structured movements: a ballerina's flawless dancing.<n>The definition of 'getting drunk' is to consume alcoholic beverages or liquor to a degree of intoxication.  Drunk literally means 'incapable of reason, being afflicted with drunkenness', or 'inebriated'. A person's actions under the influence of alcohol often indicate intoxication; such actions typically include slurred speech and lack of coordination, though the effects of alcohol will differ from person to person depending in part on their health, how much food they have consumed, whether or not they are female, how dehydrated they are, their weight, and how long they have been drinking.<n>The definition of `meet new people` is for a person to meet a new person. So meeting new people shouldn't be confused with partying or having fun with old friends.<n>The definition of "having fun" is to enjoy ourselves.  So having fun should include dancing, getting drunk and meeting new people.<n>So the correct answer would be a group of people that enjoys themselves, including enjoying each other, drinks, and parties.<n>So the final answers are A or E because a person's party should be fun, it should be enjoyable!<n><n>Input: The total price of a pizza is $12.99.

"Middle ages" suggests the knight is from Medieval times. The word "castle" suggests some sort of home for the knight. We can use information from each word group to answer this question. "Chess board" is most closely linked to "Medieval" because it speaks of a medieval knight figure. "Middle ages" includes the "castle" information, telling us that the knight figure probably lives in a castle. "Doll house" gives us a picture of a knight in a small house. "Chess board," however, gives us a knight in a figure. The correct answer is therefore E, which suggests that the knight is on a chess board.

Choices:  A: big house B: nursery school C: preschool D: building E: retirement home<n>Output:		A house may contain many rooms, but a nursery school, preschool, or building can also have many rooms. So nursery schools and preschools are not correct. Similarly, retirement homes would also have many rooms (since many people live there and many people in a retirement home can have many rooms, too). So the answer is big house.<n><n>Input: John always goes to bed the same time each night and wakes up three hours later. How early can he sleep?<n>Output: To determine when John goes to bed, note that he goes to bed three hours later than he wakes up. So he wakes up 3 hours after going to bed and 3 hours after his alarm clock wakes him up. To figure out when he goes to bed, subtract his wake up time and alarm-clock-wake-up time from 3 hours. Let:<n>x=his wake up time<n>y=his alarm clock wake up time.<n>So his alarm clock wakes up 3+x+y=x+y+3 hours after his bedtime. Subtracting this from 3 hours, we have 3-x-y=x-y+3 hours. Solving for x, we find x = 12.<n><n>Input:The baby was very restless and woke up crying. What caused it?

The parents wanted to teach their children to learn “teamwork” which we can interpret as being helpful to other people. Throwing things is an individual activity, as is chess. Playing sports requires teamwork (but in a competitive way, not cooperative). Only playing ball requires teamwork because all players have to work together to move the ball.<n>So the answer is A.<n><n>Input: I need to change my mind. Choices:  A. take a nap B. take a shower C. stay awake D. take a short walk E. take a long walk F. go for a swim G. go to the movies<n>Output: Choose the letter of the option that is an antonym of “change my mind”, and then match the correct option to the letter. C, D and F are options that mean to stop thinking about something. They are all a direct antonym to “change my mind” so none of them are the correct choice. B, E, G and H all mean to go in the opposite direction of “change my mind” as changing your mind means taking a turn in a different direction. This makes B, E and H correct options for taking a nap, going for a swim, or going to the movies, respectively.<n>So the answer choices for “I need to change my mind.” are B, E and H.<n>

The first case can be ignored as it can hold only one cup of water. Furthermore, the question only asks to find the volume of the cup as the unit for the volume is not defined. This is another way of saying that we can replace the cup's volume by volume. The question becomes: If 22 and 7/9 were added to a cup of water, then the cup' s volume would become?<n>The two cases become thus respectively: volume of 22 + volume of 7/9 = <22+78over9=30739>>30739 and volume of 22 * volume of 7/8 = <22*78over8=2018>>2018.<n>Since the volumes of these cases represent the same answer of 3018 cups, the final answer for both cases would thus be 3018<n><n># Output<n><n>Input: A man sells 45 oranges for the price of 25 dollars.

How many tons is an elephant?<n>Output: The elephant is twice the height of the camel, which means that the circumference of the circle inscribed in the elephant's body is twice the circumference of the camel's body.<n>The area of that circle is then $$2 \pi \times r$$ where r is the radius of the circle.<n>We have the formula for the volume of a cube which tells us that: $$volume = \frac{length \times width \times depth}{12} = cubic \textrm{ unites}$$ (The volume has units of $$length \times width\times depth$$ so we can just divide by 12). An elephant is a 3D shape. Therefore, we can say that the volume of an elephant (and its weight) is three times the volume of a cube. Its weight = 3 * volume. So $$3 \times volume$$.<n>Elephants weigh more than 20 tons so we need to take the volume of that shape and multiply it by 20 ($$$3 \times volume \times 20$$$).<n>The elephant weighs 5 tons more than any camel, so $$3 \times volume \ \times 20 \ \times 5$$<n>But the volume is equal to $$2 \pi r$$<n>But we know that the radius is half of the height.

This means that only door 'C' could be correct: doors 'A,' 'D,' and 'E' all require heat in the form of fire/heat/heat source (which John's door could never have had).  So the final answer is John's door is cold<n><n>Input: Choose the answer that fits each group of numbers: Choices: 1. 1/4, 1/5, 1/2, 1/3 2. 1/2,1/4, 3/5, 1 3. 1/7, 1/7,1,1/6  <n>Output: Answer B Choices:   1: 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/2 + 1/3  = 2/13 2: 1/2 +3/5 = 4/10 3: 1/7 + 1/7 +1 + 1/6 = 7/42<n><n>Input:A dog can eat as many bones as it has teeth.

In 40/4, the 40th number has to be one of the ages. Since A is not correct, the youngest is not 8. The two oldest are 4 years apart. Let us say, the 1st child is 10 years old and the 2nd is 14 years old. We know that: 14 - 10 = 4 (4 years). We want to know then what is the 4th? Let us say that the 4th is 18 years old. We know then that the youngest is 16. The sum of the two smallest ones is 16 = 8 + 8<n>Therefore, the sum of the ages is only 36.

Choices:  A: attack B: suck blood C: stay D: lay eggs E: jump<n>Output:		Let the first letter for A, Attack, and the last letter for E, Jump, be Z. Because they are the first and last letters, we know that they must be the same. Let the second letter be H for Attack. The first letter was already Z, so the second one must be A. Now, let the third letter be G for Attack. The second letter was A for Attack. The third letter must be G. But G is the same as the third letter in E, Jump. Therefore, G stands for E, so the third letter is E. Now, the fourth letter has to be I for Attack, because I is the next letter after Z that is not already used. This works for all letter pairs. So the letter combinations are Attack, AZEGI for Z+H+G+E+I. Jump, AZEZI for Z+H+(G,E,I) for G+E+I. So the answers are A and E<n><n>Input:The number of cats and bats are given below.

A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H. Each person has a hand of two playing cards. When one player has placed all 5 cards, the remaining cards are taken to a pile. The player then takes one new card. If he takes a red card, then the player gets to choose anyone in the table to give a slap to on the wrist. If the player chooses A, then A gets two slaps. But if he chooses F, F does not get any slaps. The pile is taken to the right of the person. Flipping of the card is done before the person starts taking his turn. H, the last player in the table is the first to start the game, then the position switches to the right. The cycle goes in a clockwise direction. The game ends once one of three conditions happen: (a) all cards are used (b) A gets given two slaps (c) G gets to choose to take a slap and gets 5 slaps If the game has ended without having any of the three conditions, then G has to choose for himself to take a slap or one other player. In case of (a, b, c) the game ends, the person who gives the player is considered as the winner. H gives the person 2 slaps every time he has the card (reds and white cards). If he does not get a red card, then he is the loser. If F gets the card, he chooses a player as his opponent. The rules are the same as above. G gives a player 1 slap each time he has the card. If he does not get the card, he is the loser and gives

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input: Ali had a stock of 800 books in his Room. He sold 60 on Monday, 10 on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday, 44 on Thursday and 66 on Friday. How many books were not sold?<n>Output: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>So the final answer is 600<n><n>Input:A gentleman is very wealthy and flaunts it, where does he likely live? Choices:  A: europe B: big house C: tuxedo D: palace E: men's room<n>Output:		Europe is the world's second smallest continent after Asia.It's rich with history and diverse culture.<n>Big houses in europe are not as lavish as those in the US.<n>The "men'sroom" is used by women.<n>The tuxedo is a type of formal wear for men.<n>So the correct answer is Europe<n><n>Input:A baker has 2 loaves of bread and a bagel. She mixes them together to make a sandwich, leaving her with 0 bread, 1 bagel, and 1 sandwich. How many bagels does she start with?<n>Output: Bagels have 3 holes, and a sandwich has 1.<n>She mixes a bagel and a loaf of bread to make 1 sandwich. Since one bagel is made with 3 parts of bread, and 1 sandiwch is made with 1 part, then bagels must have 1/3 of 1 bagel = 1/3 of a bagel.<n>Thus, the bagels must have 3/3 = <<3/3=1>>1 bagel<n>So the final answer if one bagel<n><n>Input: What is 21 + 22?<n>Output: 21 + 33<n>21 and 22 each have a '2' as the second digit; when combined to make 21 + 63, these two digits cancel out. The sum of the rest of the digits in 21, 1, and 33, 93, is just the sum of the rest of digits in 22, 1, and, 31<n>So the final answer to 21 + 44 is 33<n><n>Input: What's 82 + 97?<n>Output: 48 + 100<n>82 and 97 both have two digits where the value is at least 10, so we can immediately simplify by subtracting, which leaves us with 82 - 97, which is -17<n>Adding 82 - 17 to 97 + 17, we get 69, since the same digit added to itself doesn't change. Since 69 is even and both 97 and 82 are odd numbers, 69 cancels out, leaving

Choices:  A: in cinema B: at the park C: martorell D: jeep E: airplane<n>Output:		First, the sentence is parsed to find all words, the question is made to be a single word instead. Secondly, it gets the word'seat' and puts it on its own. Thirdly the sentence is parsed again but this time, the question word will only get the next word (e.g. cinema in answer A, instead of only getting it itself). The answer is the second word, in this case, cinemas since park is not an option (e.g. cinemas in answer B, instead of only getting cinema itself).<n>Finally, we add the answer (cinemas in our example)to the sentences (e.g. at theatre, instead of only getting theatre itself).<n><n>Input: The answer was at jeep, the sentence was cinema.<n>Output: Add A (seat in cinema at martorell) to the original sentence (e.g.at theatre)<n>Solution: at theatre adds A (seat in cinemas at martorell)<n>so (at theatre) and A (seat in martorell cinemas) = at theatre in cinema in jeep<n>Output: the result is 'at theatre in cinema in jeeps', which is the intended answer<n><n>Input: It was an afternoon class.

For example, if x stands for E, then:<n>1 * E = <<1*7=7>> hours, (using cross-multiplication)<n>10 * E = <<10*7=7>>00 hours, (using cross multiplication again)<n>Thus, 1 * E = <<2/7, 1/7>>2/7 hours, 10 * E = >>3/7, 3/7>>3/7 hours.<n>Now we use some more mathematical techniques. Subtract 7 from 3 / 7, since 7 is divisible by both 7 and 3, so it cancels:<n>So 2/7 + 3/7 = 2/7 > 2 / 3 = <<"2/7", 2/7="2/7">> 2 / 3<n>In other words, 2 + 3 = <<2+3=5>> are equal to 2 / 3.<n>Now, we add 2/3 to 5/7, because the former is a bit less.<n>5 + 2/3 = <<5+2+3=10>>1/7 hours, which is the closest possible total remaining.<n>So the final result is 10

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input: Ali had a stock of 800 books in his Room. He sold 60 on Monday, 10 on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday, 44 on Thursday and 66 on Friday. How many books were not sold?<n>Output: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>So the final answer is 600<n><n>Input:If you're betting with a shark, where are you likely playing? Choices:  A: aquarium B: mediterranean sea C: south pacific D: pool hall E: pacific ocean<n>Output:		Let me reword this problem: If you are traveling between the A and B choices, which one are you likely to have a much higher chance of picking?<n>Let x = the odds that you're playing Meditarranean Sea.<n>x + 10 = the odds that your playing South Pacific<n>Since 10 * 10 = <<10*10=100>>10 is significantly larger than 1 (10 * 1 >= <<10*1==1>>1), the odds that you are playing South Pacific, is significantly higher than the odds that you playing Meditarranean or Pacific Ocean. So you're likely to play South Pacific.<n>Since Meditarranean Sea and Pacific Ocean are both located in the South West (SW) of our map, you're still likely to play Pacific Ocean with a 10:2 ratio. But by traveling directly from one side of the map to the other, and with the South West and South Pacific both being so similar in distance, it's likely that you are going to spend most of your time playing at the South Pacific.<n>So the final answers are South Pacific and Pacific Ocean<n><n>Input: Aaron and Brianna both play guitar. Aaron's guitar has 25 strings; 4 in red, 5 in orange, 4 in yellow, 4 in green, and 8 in purple. Brianna just got a new guitar. Its strings are arranged in the colors violet, red, blue, yellow, green, orange, pink. Who has the most purple strings?<n>Output: Let us denote the number of strings as "n".<n>n is the number of strings in the guitar, which is given (<<n=25>>25)<n>Since the number of strings in purple is equal to the number of strings in orange, which is 4 (<<n=4>>4)<n>Since violet also has 4 strings, then we have 4 + 4 = <<4+4=8>>8 for the number of strings which is in violet. This number is larger than or equal to the number of purple strings in both Aaron's and Brianna's guitar, which is given by 8 – 2 = 6 (<<6=6>>6)<n>So the final answer to who has the most

The grandmother is equal to the difference between Sally's age and her sister's age, which can be calculated with the equation: Grandmother = Sally's age – <Sally's age=14> Sally's sister's age <Sally's sister'm age=11>. So Grandmother = 14 – 11 = 3 years old. We see that since Grandmother is older than Sally, Sally's grandmother is 3 years older and less than 4 years old or 4 years old.

How many books were not sold?<n>Output: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>So the final answer is 600<n><n>Input:A musician is most likely to perform a concerto for clarinet with what type of group? Choices:  A: music store B: orchestra C: jazz band D: rock band E: music studio<n>Output:		A person would likely perform a concerto on clarinet with members of an orchestra<n><n>We know that one of the 5 choices is correct, because one choice is for an orchestra:<n>1) An orchestra performs concertos  --> False. This choice is for a group, so this would make performance unlikely.<n>2) A jazz band performs concertos -> True. This choice would make performance possible.<n>3) A music store perform concertos --> We know from 1 above that this is not possible, so this is true.<n>4) A music studio perform concertos --> We learned from 2 above that this is possible, as ia jazz band, so this is also true.<n>5) A rock band performs concertos --> We learned in 3 that this is not a possible music store, but we haven't learned enough yet to know whether this is possible for an orchestra, so this is also false.<n>It may be that two choices are both true, but then what's the problem? Since either choice is for a group of instruments, and they both perform concertos, this still makes performance of a concerto for the clarinet likely with an orchestra
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input: Ali had a stock of 800 books in his Room. He sold 60 on Monday, 10 on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday, 44 on Thursday and 66 on Friday. How many books were not sold?<n>Output: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>So the final answer is 600<n><n>Input:When a newborn's eyes open for the first time it will be the first time the ever? Choices:  A: tear up B: see light C: fill with tears D: be happy E: glass over<n>Output:		A and B are wrong answers because being the first time ever to experience something can't involve tears. Hence, D is eliminated. C doesn't hold up because the eye can't be filled with tears unless they are opened first, so E is eliminated. A and B don't hold because the first time is the first time, no matter what you do with your eyes. Therefore the answer is D.<n><n>Input: A: Is this question? B: Who answered this question. C: Who's this question for. D: Did the question answer itself. E: Does this question exist.<n>Output: E is definitely the wrong answer because the question clearly exists and the other answers do not answer itself. C doesn't really answer the question, because the question is asking who the question is directed to and the answer doesn't provide an individual. That leaves A, D, B, and E. You can eliminate B and D because the answer isn't for anyone in particular. So it gets down to A and E. E seems too absurd that the question can ever answer itself, but A could be reasonable. But look what A is saying: "Is this question?" If the question was asking about who had answered it, it wouldn't say "Is this question" but either "Who answered this question?", or "Whose this question for?". Therefore the answer is E.<n>So the right answer is: E, C and A.<n><n>Input: What is your dream job? Choices: Answer: none of the above because it's not a job which gives you experience and then allows you to advance as you need experience 62% is one of the answers because it gives you experience and then you can advance and it also gives you experience and advancement 53% gives you experience and it can advance to 60% depending on how hard you work to prove yourself 46% gives you experience but does not offer advancement with experience 47% is similar to 46% in that it allows experience but not advancement<n>Answer:<n>The correct answer is none of the above because<n><n>74% gives you experience which can allow you the option to advance<n>39% gives you experience and is also similar<n>46% gives you an option for advancement<n>47% gives you experience but if you don't gain more experience while working you can't advance<n>62

How much distance did she cover?<n>Output: We first determine the number of minutes that she walked. Let x = the number of minutes that Jane walked.<n>Then x + 2 + 14 = 14 + 2 + 6 = <<14+2+6=22>>22<n>Solve for x: 22 = <<22=11>> 11<n>22/11 = <<22/11=2>> 2<n>Subtracting two from both sides: x – 2 = <<x-2=9>>9<n>dividing both sides by nine: x = <<x/9=1>> 1<n>From here, we can conclude that Jane walked 1 minute.<n>Then we determine the number of minutes Jane ran. Let x = the total minutes Jane ran.<n>Then x + x + 12 = 12 + 2 + 24 = <<12+2+24=38>>38<n>Divide both sides by 38:x/38 = <<x/38=1>> 1 to find x = <<x/39=1/38>> 1/38<n>Subtract 1/38 to both sides: x – (1/38) = <<x-(1/38)=1/37>> 1/37<n>Dividing by 37: x = <<x/(37)=1>> 1<n><n>So Jane ran for 1 minute, walked for 1 minute, and ran at a very fast pace for 12 minutes. <n>Adding 1 + 1 + 12 together, we get 15 minutes.<n>Also, the number of miles is 15/2 = <<15/2=7.5>> 7.5<n>So the final answer answer is 7.5<n><n>Input: An apple costs $0.15 at a grocery store.

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input: Ali had a stock of 800 books in his Room.

But I had a crippling fear of going where? Choices:  A: outside B: vacation C: idle D: apartment E: neighborhood<n>Output:		I was comfortable, which means I was probably at home.  However, being afraid of "going" somewhere else makes me suspect that I also wanted to, or that otherwise I would have found some comfort in going elsewhere.  Since "outside" is a physical location rather than an emotion state, I would assume that I do not fear that kind of location, and so that it must have something to do with emotional states; e.g., an apartment, a neighborhood or an idiot.  Choice A sounds most fitting.<n><n>Input: My coworker just said he'll never leave his boss a voicemail.  I asked him why not, but I don't really think he has to do it.<n>Output: While I think my coworker is overthinking his situation, this statement suggests that he has some type of bad relationship with his manager.  I agree that this situation is difficult to evaluate since there can be many reasons for lacking voicemail, but it's a good bet he's not happy with his boss.  Choice C<n><n>Input: Do you want your coffee black?<n>Output: Not just no, but f*** no.  This is pretty obvious from the context and word choice.<n><n>Input: I'd like to buy a new computer but I don't want to spend too much money.<n>Output: This seems positive.  Choices:  A. I'd like to and I don't want;  B. I like and I like;  C. I'd like and I don't like;  D. I don't want and I don't know.<n><n>Input: What do you like to drink?  There are so many choices!<n>Output: This statement indicates this character wants to say they want to drink, but isn't sure what to choose.  Choices: A. I like the drink choices; B. I like drinks; C. I like alcohol.<n><n>Input: You see that girl over there?<n>Output:  Yes, I do.  Choices:<n><n>Input: My parents are paying for my college tuition, but I'd rather they'd give me their pills instead.<n>Output: To me, this sounds like the speaker is not genuine about wanting to pay for their own education.

He had a long-term problem that needed care.  It was best if he could be checked over by a medical professional, but for now he could take this quiz to figure out how to feel better.  <n>Choices A and B are the problems that David experiences in his life.  They are not the problem causing him to be in the hospital.  David is not fatigued and does not feel relaxed.  Therefore, answers A and B are eliminated.<n>Choices C, D and E are all problems that affect the human body in a negative way.  David is fatigued and needs food.  However, that does not mean David is addicted to anything.  Answer C and E can be eliminated.<n>In the question, it said David was "in pain."  Answer D cannot be eliminated.  Headaches do affect the human body in different ways, but they are certainly painful.  Therefore, answer D can be eliminated.  If David is experiencing headaches, this would be an immediate solution that could be addressed first.<n>Choices A and D mean completely opposite things.  Choice A would make David want drugs for a long time, while choice D would cause him to not want to eat.  Choice A is what would occur if David was an alcoholic, and it is not the best choice.  If David has addictive tendencies, the hospital could treat him for them.  Choice A can be eliminated. Then only answers B, D and E are left.<n>The final answer is Answer D.  David is experiencing a headache, and a headache can be treated on the spot.  Once it is treated, David will have more energy and be able to better deal with his addiction.<n><n>Input: In a recent report, the president of SUNY, John Jay, says that “Nationwide, we need to make four-year and two-year degrees accessible and affordable to all students,” because “many students don't know where to turn to find financial aid for school.”<n><n>What the president means is that...<n><n>(i) students who have access to financial aid, will receive a two-year degree.<n>(ii) students who have a two-year degree, may have lower education costs.<n>(iii

How many monkeys will go to each sanctuary?<n>Output: First we know that 12 monkeys is divided by 3 sanctuaries.<n>12/3 = <<12/3=4>>4 monkeys will go to the first sanctuary.<n>4+4 = <<4+4=8>>8<n>So 8 will go to the second sanctuary.<n>8/3 = <<8/3=2.67>>2.67 monkeys will go to another sanctuary.<n>2.67+2.67 = <<2.67+4.67=7.34>>7.34 monkeys will go there.<n>7.34/3 = <<7.34/4=1.83>>1.83 monkeys will go to this sanctuary.<n>1.83+1.83+3 = <<1.83+4.83=6.66>>6.66<n>So all the monkeys are divided among the three sanctuaries, and each sanctuary will hold 2.67+6.66 = <<2.6+7.6=10>>1<n>We can use any of these 10 monkeys to represent the three sanctuaries.<n>So the final selection is this option: A. All monkeys will go to these three sanctuaries.

C;the shelves and boxes were all used. D; none of the choices matched. E; the objects had to be arranged in the storage unit using 57 boxes.<n>Output: Let x be the number of objects that were to go on each shelf. Because, x + x + x + x = 57, we know that each unit must contain at least one object that will be greater than the limit of 50 that each shelf can hold.<n>Therefore, A, B and E are not possible.<n>Also, note that each shelf has room for at least four objects. This is because 4 * 4 = 16 20 * (x + 1) <= (x + 4) * (x + 4).<n>Thus, D is not possible.<n>Therefore only C is possible.<n>So the final answere is C, the shelves and boxes are all used<n><n>Input: What is greater: 5% of 120, or 5% of 2048 Choices:  A. <<5% of 1920>>5% of 24 Choices 5% of 600<n>B <<5% of 56>>5% of 32.<n>C <<5% of 48>>5% of 16.<n>D <<5% of 96>>5% of<< 19/1000>>8<n>E <<5% of 31>>5% of<<33/1000 >>9<n><n>Output:  I think this is just an easy one, so A and D are not possible.<n>B is impossible because: 5% of <<56>>56 = 0.5

What does this make him feel? Choices:  A: then have B: headaches C: stoic D: being happy E: wanting more<n>Output:		John said <<Headaches>>B and is thus said to be a <<stoic>>B.<n><n>Input: There are 20 boys. Four of them are named James. One of those is 19 years old and one is 18 years old. What is the ages of the other 17?<n>Output: Since there are 20 boys, we can subtract 1 from 20 to find two times which we can subtract to find half the boys: 20 - 1 = <<20-1=19>>19 boys.<n>Then we can subtract half the boys and get 9; we can then subtract 9 from the original number of boys: 19 - <<9=10>>1.<n>Fifth, we can multiply the two numbers to find what they have in common: 20*19 - 10 = <<20*19=24>>16.<n>So one can say that the other 17 boys are 16 + 1 = <<16+1=17>>17 years old.<n>So the final anser is 17<n><n>Input: A family of eight people is traveling.

The next month, he sowed the maturing crop with wheat. How many acres were sown with wheat? Choices: 1) 7 acres, 2) 8 acres, 3) 10 acres, 4) 11 acres, 5) 12 acres.<n>Output:The answer depends on the month in which the crop was sowed.

Similarly, if it is sowed in May, then 1 was sowed with mung beans and 11 with wheat. In March or April, every acre will be sowed with mung until that month. So the answer is 8 acres.<n><n>Input:A man in the desert finds a bottle in which there is water, a map of the desert, and a message.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input: Ali had a stock of 800 books in his Room. He sold 60 on Monday, 10 on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday, 44 on Thursday and 66 on Friday.

Because the <<‹6*1=6>​ <<6>>6 high school crowd is not on the left side of the Venn diagram, Jan cannot be the <<<<8*1=2>>1 crowd. <<<<2*1 =2>>2The <<<<2*1= 2>>2audience is not included on the left side, so Jan cannot be in the <<<<2*1=>2theater>>theater. Jan cannot be a <<2*1 = 1 >>2city dwellers because that segment leaves out the speakers. The <<6*1=6the crowd is not on the right side of the Venn Diagram because it covers the <<2*1 =2​>>2 speech, and the <<2*1 == 2​>​<<2*1=speeches 2>>2 speakers.<<1*1=1the crowd must be in the <<<<< 5*1=5 5-side, and Jan must be the <<<<<2*1>>2<<2*1>>2student who goes elsewhere. So the final answer is B.<n><n>Input: What is the sum of the digits of the number 175?<n>Output: One plus seven plus five = 13.<n>One plus three = 4<n>So in total, the sum of the digits is 13.<n>The final answer is 13<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the mathematical statement.<n><n>Input: Two hours and 50 minutes plus three miles.<n>Output: 2h 50m + 3m = 2h 53m<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following yes-no question.<n><n>Input:"Was it fun?"Output:Yes<n><n>Input:"Were we

When Bill is in the room, there are at least two people present. How many people are in the room when Bill is there?<n>Output: Here's a quick solution using common knowledge<n>If Bill is there, and there are at least two in the room, that means<n>1: there are at least 2 people in the room,<n>and 2: there is at least one other person in the room besides himself.<n>We are choosing the third of these choices. So there is at least one extra person in the room besides Bill.<n>This solution does not satisfy the criteria as stated though, because Bill is present, but the room has exactly 2 people in it (besides himself).<n><n>A more correct version of this problem might involve the fact that when there are three people in the room, only one of them must be Bill, because "When Bill is in the room" is already defined. We get that when there are three in the room, it must be Joe, hence Bill is not in the room, since there are exactly three people. The above solution may work however, if one understands, that the above solution has no contradiction in it.<n>A way to understand the above is to realise that the fact that there may be more than 3 people in the given room at any one time, is true even after the room has 2 people in it, because there is no contradiction there. So no contradiction exists when Joe is the only person in the room, because that is exactly what the problem says is the case.<n><n>The reason why this doesn't work as stated on our assignment<n>is because of the extra info given, i.e. when there are exactly three people, Bill is the one and only person present.<n>Also note: if Bill was not in the room, and there were exactly two people in the room instead,<n>then Joe would be inevitably in the room as well, because the premise of this problem is that Bill is present.<n>So in the first version, a contradiction would result if Bill is still present when there are exactly 3 people.<n>We do not know the number of

There are sometime called stem cells.  The difference between them and adult stem cells that are not in the embryonic state. In which they were created using embryos, that could mean they were created through in-vitro-fertilization (IVF) for the purpose of stem cell research. But don't confuse somatic-related-cells which are body cells; these can be called stem-like cells. They can be stem cells because they all contain DNA. However, only embryonic stem cells are totipotent stem cells, which means that they can turn into almost any cell in the human body. They are the ones that can reproduce. The only reason that scientists get embryonic stem cells rather than other kinds of stem cells is that scientists need to use the stem cells for their own purposes, which is why they use embryos. So they are using the embryo and making the embryo into something different. If you take the embryo, and use those properties to help someone, it would be called the process of reproductive cloning? There are some of the things that you should know when you decide to take biology as your major. There are five basic levels of living things, they are archaea, bacteria, protists, fungi, and animals. The first and most basic level is archaea. These have a single cell that is eukaryote, and has a membrane-bound nucleus. They also make up the genetic code. Archaea have been on Earth longer than any other organism, and are said to be the most ancient organisms. They can live in almost any environment. Another ancient organism under archaea are bacteria. They are eubacteria, prokaryotes, and eukaryotes. They are found in many different environments, living as single-celled organisms or in multi-cellular structures. They have a single circular chromosome. Bacteria are also known to multiply rapidly, but don't necessarily all live on other living things. When taking your core class in high school, you should have taken either biology and chemistry. Both of these can teach you about the basic principles of

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday.

Choices:  A: inspiration B: much work C: boredom D: graduate E: degree<n>Output:		Let n denote the number of years a person attended school.<n>A student graduated from school if and only if A ≠ B<n>C has two options: either the school was not too exciting, in which case the student was bored, or the school was too exciting, in this case, the student was inspired.<n>Because it is always better to be inspired than bored, we have bored ≠ inspired, but inspired ≥ bored, i.e. inspired > bored.<n>D is a synonym of E, and so the result is a non-empty equivalence class of the two options. Therefore, by de Morgan's law:<n>A ≠ B ∨ bored ≥ inspired<n>For the sake of simplicity we write: A ≠ B or inspired ≥ bored.<n>So, after twelve years any of the following is true.<n>A: The student is inspired.<n>B: The school was boring.<n>C: The student was bored.<n>A bored individual would not graduate, and so the statement: A: graduate is false.<n>This leaves two possibilities:<n>B: The school is boring and the student is inspired<n>C: The school is so inspiring that the student graduated.<n>So it turns out that exactly one of these possibilities is true: inspired > bored.

Choices: A: nothing B: it drives normally C: it drives sideways on two wheels D: it drives fast<n>Output: If a car has two different sized tires on a single wheel, then it is impossible for the car to drive normally (with the exception of the rear axle). This is because the left tire and the right tire will not have the same radius, and there are no other tires (at least, not on this wheel) to support the body of the car. This also means that the car can not go sideways. This leaves turning the wheels clockwise and turning them counter-clockwise. Since each side requires the same radius (for each sized tire is different from the other), the car must turn sideways on two wheeled, which means the car is actually moving in a circle

Not even a flashlight can blink this fast!<n>If there are blinking lights in the distant night sky, it's very unlikely that the lights are caused by someone turning their head at night - not even the most obnoxious person can blink that fast!<n>There's no way those could be a blinking bum - penguins don't have bums, but even if penguins did, they wouldn't have any way to bend and blink their bums at night.

(429 words)<n>In order to sell books, we have to have them first and then we have to look in the market for them. Once we have found a book, we have to buy it. We will then give it to customers or we will have to throw it away. Since we are working with limited resources, once we have the list with books we want to buy, it would be good to stop buying books with that list.<n>The book which will be bought and the book we will throw away are:<n>1.

Choices:  A: drop to zero B: increase C: cool down D: dropping quickly E: heat up<n>Output:		Choices:  A, B, D  Choice: B  The correct answer is (D).  We can interpret "It was really beginning" as a way of saying that it was changing very quickly - in other words, it was dropping quickly.  Since we know that the temperature was changing (i.e. it was not fixed at zero), we can see that it was in fact dropping quickly - so the temperature was "dropping quickly".  By changing "the temperature changing rapidly" to "the temperature changing quickly", we have already eliminated A. That leaves us with either B or D.  But "It was really beginning to cool down" is the most natural way of saying that the temperature was changing - so we pick D.<n>So the final "choices" A and D both contain no errors.<n><n>Input: Which of the following is an example of an imperative instruction?

He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input: Ali had a stock of 800 books in his Room. He sold 60 on Monday, 10 on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday, 44 on Thursday and 66 on Friday. How many books were not sold?<n>Output: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>So the final answer is 600<n><n>Input:George ruined the surprise.  How did he do so? Choices:  A: hiding B: accidentally C: expectation D: knowingly E: planned<n>Output:		By doing so, he ruined everyone's surprise.<n>It was an impromptu birthday party. The guests were all waiting for the birthday girl to come.<n>Everyone was wondering what she was going to look like when she came out. <n>Then, suddenly the guests were informed that George ruined the surprise.<n>And everyone knew that their birthday party was no longer a surprise.<n>So the final choice is D<n><n>Input:The new CEO is not going to fire his secretary because he thinks he needs someone to open his mail.<n>How many people is the CEO going to fire if everyone opens his mail?<n>Output: If the new CEO opens his mail himself, he'll only need to fire one person.<n>If the president fires the CEO, he'll also open his mail, and only needs to fire one person. But if the new CEO replaces the secretary, he'll need to fire 2 people.<n>So we get an equation of 2 + 1 = x + 1 <n>x = x – 1, so x = x – 1 – 1 = <<x-1-1=1>>1 person.<n>So we get our final answer: 1 person<n><n>Input:It costs 90 cents for a bus ride, and 50 cents for a subway ride.<n>How much does it cost to ride a bus and subway together?<n>Output: If we ride the bus, this is 90 cents.<n>Then, if we ride the subway, this is 50 cents.<n>We add these together to get 90 + 50 = <<90+50=140>>140 cents.<n>So, if we ride both at the same time, we pay 140 cents<n>So the final answer could be 140<n><n>Input:I'm feeling the love. How do I know this?<n>1. I feel really good. <n>2. I have a warm and fuzzy feeling. <n>Output: There are 2 feelings we get from the question.<n>1. I really hope you're feeling the love.<n>2.

How much pancake batter did 9 boxes of cereal make?<n>Output:Let n = the number of boxes of cereal.<n>16 oz * n = 64 oz<n>Multiplying both sides by n: 16*n = 64<n>Dividing both sidees by 16: n = <<16/16=1>>1<n>So 9 * 1 = <<9*1=9>>9 boxes of cereals make 9 oz of pancaake batter.<n>Also, 9 boxes of cerea makes 36 oz of pancakee batter, so 9 boxes of ceree make 27 oz of pancaee batter<n>So the final answer of both are 27<n><n>Input:A pizza has 11 slices of cheese, 8 of pepperoni, and 4 of olives. How many of each ingredient appears on pizza?<n>Output:11 cheese<n>8 pepperoni<n>4 olives<n>For the number of pepperoni or olives, we don't need to add them up. Each can have more than one piece in it. Cheese can only have one "piece". So 11/1 = <<11/1=11>>1 cheese and 8/1 = <<8/1=8>>8 pepperoni<n>So pepperoni appears 8 times and 4 olives means there are 4 olives<n>So the final answer<n><n>Input:Is 3 greater than 1? Yes or No?<n>Output:3 is greater than 1, so the answer is yes<n>

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday.

Choices:  A: pocket B: office supply store C: friend's house D: desk drawer E: city hall<n>Output:		If the answer is "a", write "a" and stop. If the answer is "b", you would stop at a, write "b", and start over. If the answer is C, you would stop at b, write "c", and start over.<n>Continue until you eventually write "e" and stop.<n>Then count the letters and the number of choices to get the number of steps you took.<n>Input: Write down the first two digits of 664,032. <n>Output: If the first two digits are 99, continue to take the cube root of 99. If the first two digits aren’t 99, keep writing down the sum of the previous digits with the new number, and the next two digits with 99.<n>For instance, if the first two digits are not 99, then we have 664. After the 99, we get 66 + 113 = <<66+113=179>>179 + 032 = <<179+032=179>><n>Since numbers with an even number of digits have an even number of places, and numbers with an odd number of digits have an odd number of places, this would be the last answer you enter. <n><n>Input: Tetris is a classic game that is played by a computer. In every normal Tetris game, a line is cleared when it cannot be filled by falling blocks, and the line clears when all falling blocks reach bottom of the screen. The player's score is the number of lines cleared. How many lines get cleared if the game never has to show the message "Game over"?<n>Output: 2 (a.k.a. "win")<n>(Note: 1 is a loss):<n>It is impossible for the score to get to 1 because if there are more lines cleared as a result of falling a block, then Tetris must have occurred.<n>If it is not a gameover (not to be confused with Game Over from the Tetris Movie), there'll never be a line cleared but the score will not go to 1.<n><n>Input: There are four bicycles sitting by a tree.

If 10 of each 20 employees who lived in New York resigned, how many people remained at the company?<n>Output: Let X equal the number of X who live in New York.<n>94 = X + 10<n>So 101 = X<n>Subtracting X from both sides of the equation, we get 94 – X = 101 – X<n>Subtract 101 from both sides of the last equation, we get the equation we need to solve for X, which is: 94 – X ≠ 101 – (X)<n>Adding X to both sides of the last expression, we get: 94 + X = 102<n>Dividing both numerator and denominator by 2, we find the final answer is 45<n><n>Input: 12 people went to the zoo. The first 8 came by car, and the last 4 came on a bus.<n>What fraction of the group came by bus?<n>Output: Let the number of people who came by car and the number of people who rode the bus be x and y, where x<sup>2</sup>y = <<12*(8)>>812 people who came by car.<n>12 – 8 = <<12-8=4>>4 people who rode on the bus<n>So we'll let x = 4 and y = 8 to solve this problem. The fraction who rode on the bus is therefore x/y = 4/8, or 1/2.<n>Since there was no way to ask for the number of people who walked, since 12 (8) = 2 * 812, x = 2, so 2/3 of the group came by car, 2/3 of 12 = 8, so 8 of 12 came by the car.<n>So the final answers are

Derek refused to discuss his feelings with his friends or relatives, and instead spent his time working as a computer programmer for his company. He spent almost all of his free time playing chess or reading computer manuals. He also drank too much and gained weight. After eight months of this behavior, he finally agreed to consult a psychologist.<n><n>During the first few sessions, Derek insisted that anything was better than being in a miserable marriage. Then, he reluctantly agreed to discuss some of his problems and grievances with his wife.

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>So the final answer is 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Output: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>So the final answer is 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Output: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>So the final answer is 5<n><n>Input: Ali had a stock of 800 books in his Room.

It was overkill.  What did he shoot at? Choices:  A: body armor B: ungulate C: bomber D: kill people E: animal<n>Output:		The choices for this problem will be:<n>A,B,E<n>The first three options are all animals, and all living creatures need to eat to survive. Since James was seeking to eat during this activity, it can be assumed that he wasn't trying to kill people. He may have been shooting at animals, but it is much more likely that he was shooting at something more edible, like bears. The final option is that he was specifically shooting at an animal that is not dangerous to attackers, such as livestock.<n>So the final chosen answer is B<n>

So company A does not need to use the process of going public in order to reveal information. Similarly, having issues would not generally lead to the company "going public." The stock may be in need of more funding, but so may many companies that are not selling stock to the world. Only a company in need of more fundings and being in trouble would need to "go public." So company B is false. A company that is going public may also be in trouble and in need of more funders. Thus, we know that company C is false, but company D is also false. Hence, the correct choice is C.<n>So the final answers are D and E.<n><n>Input: Why do people go to the gym?

Choices:  A: edge B: desire to win C: friendship D: rivalry E: skill<n>Output:		An edge is a physical, monetary, or mental benefit that leads to success against another competitor. One can think of an edge as the reason for one's success. A desire to win may be a general goal of anyone competing, but it may not lead to a successful endeavor without specific skills. Friendship is common for team sports, but it will not create the edge necessary for success in a solo sport. Friendship is perhaps what helps someone become competitive, but that person likely already has an edge as an individual. The friend might compete on a different level, but someone with an edge will compete at any level.<n>Choose your answers to the questions and click 'Next' to see the next set of questions.<n><n>

How many points did the other team have?<n>Output:In order to determine the number of points, we have two variables to calculate. First let us assume that each variable has a value that is 3 units less than the number of points that it has. This means that <<1-3= -2>>-2. When applying the PEMDAS rules, this means we should add 3 to 2, which means <<3+2=5>>. Thus the first variable is <<5-3=2>>2 points. To summarize, 2 points was the final score. The second variable is also 3 units less than its final score. Assuming that the final score for this second variable is 6, applying the PEMDOS rules would mean <<6-3=3>>3. Putting everything together, the other team had <<2+3=5>>5 points.<n>So the final points to the other team is 5<n><n><n>Input:<n>Three teams with 6 members played at total matches. <n>The total points of team A were 76, team B totaled 102, and team C had 77.

If you only buy (and the shop still will sell to you) 33% you will have to buy (and the shop will then sell to you) 188*9/17 more melons. And if you buy 64% you will be required to buy 216*9/17 (and the shop still sells to you). It should be easier to see this if the shop has to sell 560 items at a total of 760 USD to you.<n>Here is a bit of math: ((33%*560) + 560) * 159/17 = 760 US Dollars<n>(64%*560 ) * 7/17 = 381 US Dollars<n>So, if the kiosk purchased on Friday is 216*8/17, it would be correct.<n><n>Input: You

Choices:  A: watch film B: play cards C: play chess D: read news papers E: surf net<n>Output:		 A: watch films = <<A=watch filme>> watch films. We cannot surf the net because the internet requires a computer and does not involve television. Neither of the other two choices involve chess, so they do not involve boredom. Reading an actual paper, instead of surfing the net, would also be boring if we are really that bored.<n><n>**Note:** The above choices have been ordered from least to most boring in terms of what you can do if you feel bored.<n><n>Input: How many children were invited to go to the party?<n>Output: 5, 5, 5 and 5, since children are not included in the number of parents going to the party.<n><n>Input: Write the number, 8756, in words.<n>Output: We see that there are two different ways the number, 8 + 7 + 5 + 6 = <<8+7+5+6=24>>2, can be split into different sequences of digits. There is no restriction, so we can choose any sequence. Here are all the possibilities:<n><<8756>><n><<875+6>><n><<8+(7)+5+(6)>><n>Since we can choose any sequence, we choose any sequence out of these four possibilities. We can choose any pair of digits to be next to each other (e.g. we could choose to arrange the numbers 8 and 4, or 6 and 8, etc.), and no two numbers may be adjacent to each other (we cannot arrange it so that 8 and 5 are next to each other, etc.). Since there are 4 different ways the numbers can be ordered, 4.<n><n>Input: In the USA, each state is divided into counties. There are 3065 counties in the USA.

Choices:  A: grocery store B: refrigerator C: freezer D: plate E: supermarket<n>Output:		Let the initial temperature be T, where T is less than the maximum human body temperature (36,95°C). If we put the cabbage in an environment with ambient temperature more than T, its temperature rises (its temperature is greater than T and we say that it is heated).<n>The cabbage goes into the fridge. A fridge keeps the temperature cold enough for cabbage because of the constant evaporative cooling processes.<n>The cabbage is now in the fridge, an environment where the temperature is T. The temperature that is inside the fridge is lower than this (because the evaporation process cools down the fridge as well as the food in it), which means that the temperature inside the fridge is less than T.<n>The temperature inside the fridge rises up to T, and stops because the air inside gets too hot. The temperature inside the fridge stops rising, and remains constant.<n>Thus, putting this type of cabbage into a fridge will maintain the temperature less than T forever, as long as T is less than the normal human body temperature.<n>So the final answeer is A, which says "frigde"<n><n>Input: The difference of the numbers is divisible by 2, meaning that the difference is even, which means the smaller number is one more than the larger number.<n>For example 3 and 1 = 2.

How many books were not sold?<n>Output: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>So the final answer is 600<n><n>Input:Where might a human sit for extended periods over a bowl of water? Choices:  A: bathroom B: solar system C: coffee shop D: space shuttle E: airport<n>Output:		The answer is "D." We know that the human's position over the water will be the same as his position over his house from the question before. Since "a" stands for "bathroom," we can conclude that the human "A" is not the answer. Similarly, "B" stands for "solar system," so this human is not the answer.<n>Since "C" stands for "coffee shop," we can conclude that "coffee shop Joe" has not yet returned from the bathroom. So "coffee shop" is not the answer either.<n>"Space shuttle" stands for the human named Steve. Since "E" means that Steve has not yet landed at the airport, Steve's position cannot be the same as his house. So the human named Steve is also not the answer.<n>The remaining potential answer is "D." So the final answer is "D."<n><n>Input: A large pile of laundry can be picked up by 2 mice if 2 mice have no arms. Why? Choices: A: The pile of laundy was never picked up before, so 2 arms were not necessary. B: The pile of clothes and the pile of arms are the same size. C: The pile of arms can only fit in their mouse holes. D: The pile of clothing is pink and the pile of mice is brown.<n>Output:  We assume that "C" is "The pile of arms can fit in mouse holes." We know that the pile of arms must be the same size as the pile of clothes, otherwise the pile would be picked up by 3 mice and, since mice have no arms, would not be picked up at all. However, the pile of arms is nevertheless the same size as the clothing, so this is not what the answer is.<n>"A" means "pile of laundry was never picked up before" and, since a pile of laundiry was never picked up before this means there was no pile at all, so 2 mice do not have to have arms.<n>"B" stands for "pile of clothes and the clothing pile can only fit in mouse holes." Note that if a pile of clothes can only pile into a mouse hole, it is no pile at all. So this

The rest include "book robber" which involves the crime of stealing books, "to book" or "the booking of a prisoner"; "believe guilt" which means they suspect the guilty, "to belittle" means to make small so that it sounds smaller than reality, "to direct traffic" which is a person who directs traffic (makes sure that people go the right way when going), and "wave on" which means to permit something or someone to move forward. Option E which is to "wave on", is the proper answer because he is waving the flares as a traffic sign to direct traffic.<n>So the final answers are 8063893<n>input:<n>The problem asks:<n>How many bats can fit into a tennis court if there are 30 bats in total and if every bat has to have a ball with at least one less ball than its neighbour?<n>We will first look at the number of bats that fit into a tennis court. This can be calculated by dividing the number of balls by the number of bats. As a ball cannot be in a basket with the same ball as the ball in the next basket, we cannot fit 30 balls into the basket. 30 / 30 = <<30/30=1>>1 bats fit into the basket. Now we can see that 1 ball is placed on the 1 bat, so all of the other bats have one less ball than the bat next to them. We still have 3 bats left, so we place 9 balls on these bats. This makes 2, 1, 1, 9 and 25. Then from 25 we take 1 ball, which makes 26. We can then place 2 bats on 1 ball making 2, 6, 2 and 6. Repeating this on smaller amounts makes 2, 3, 2, 2, 1.<n>So one bat needs a ball and the bat next to it needs a ball with one less to make a total of 1.<n>Therefore the answer is 2, 31/2, 2,2/3,2,1

Choices: 1: Turkey 2: Sweet potato 3: Pumpkin 4: Corn <n>Output: A turkey is part of a flock, so one would need a farmer to raise (and slaughter) the bird.<n>Corn and sweet potatoes are produced on corn farms, and pumpkins are produced on pumpkin patches. So people visit farms or patches to buy sweet potatoes and pumpkins. Because of this, one cannot just buy sweet potatoes or pumpkins at the grocery store.<n>However, Americans can buy groceries at grocery stores or go to grocery stores for Thanksgiving dinner. One can also buy turkeys at farms, corn at corn farms, and so on – even though we don’t eat the farmer.<n>So most Americans usually buy turkeys in grocery stores. However, other people just buy pumpkins and sweet potatoes from farmers or sweet potatoes from their garden.<n>A farmer may sell sweet potatoes, potatoes, corn, turkeys, and chickens to several different people at once. But one would only buy turkey from one farmer.<n>So the farmers have no incentive to get the turkeys on the market because the groceries don't have a competitive advantage of selling.<n>One often hears the refrain "turkey, potatoes, and sweet potatoes for you and one for me."<n>Giving an answer as to the food that the Americans eat on Thanksgiving is tricky. But it is possible.<n>So the final answe is 1<n>

The value could be a number, a percentage, or any other kind of value. It is up to you to figure out the nature of the value using the information provided by each of the statements, and then answer what the value is by choosing one of the options given.<n><n>In the first statement, we are told that the value is odd, which it is since there are an even number of items mentioned (1 through 6).<n><n>In the second statement, we are told it is more than 4 and not between 2 and 7, which rules out 1, 3, 5, and 6.<n><n>In the third statement, we are told a 9 is one third of the total, which can only be possible if 9 < total, and by rule of inclusion we can exclude 2 & 7, which leaves 1, 3 and 5 as options.<n><n>In the 4th statement, the words "of" and 4 give us the clue that we need to find 4% of some quantity, so from the answer choices we can rule out 1, 2 and 3 which are not equal to 1/10th of some quantity.<n><n>In the last statement, we are told the value equals the total minus twice the median, which can only be true if the total is > 4, because if the total is 4, then it is an even value and not > 4. Ruling out 2 and 4 leaves 1 and 3.<n><n>So the total set of values is 1, 3 & 5 which make up 3 possible choices, and 1, 3 which makes up the total number of unique values and 5, which is the sum.<n><n>

Since the 3rd digit can't be zero. So one=356. Then 100*100*choice. Since 100*the 2 digit choice = 100*35+100*6 = 100*(40+6) = 10080 = 408 =8. Since one can't be 8, so we subtract one from its choices. Then 9 = 8-1, so 408 = 8-1. 100*8-1 = 8, so 40 will be 1 less than choices. Then 477. So the final answer is 477.<n><n>Input:You and your friends want to buy a new 3D printer.The printer comes in 2 different shapes-square-top and rectangular-based. What

Choices:  A: atom B: anything C: air D: feet E: hands<n>Output:		Atoms and molecules are too small to be held by hands. Instead, hands can only be used to hold everything that makes up everything you CAN'T hold in your hands. Thus, molecules are what you can't hold in your hands. The correct answer is C.<n><n>Input:A train carries 181 passengers, but 35 more passengers than the train engineer expects.<n>Output:Here, we can express that in the equation for the total number passengers as T*X = 181<n>We need to know the number of passengers the Engineer expected. To solve this equation for X, we simply subtract the equation and get 2X - 181 = 35<n>Therefore, X = 146.<n>So the final number of passengers above the estimated count is 146.

Choices:  A: airplane B: construction site C: shops D: engine E: broken bone<n>Output:		Let's go through the choices one at a time.<n>A: Choice A is airplane. An airplane has three types of metal rods: a metal strip (see the wing), a metal tube (see the engine cylinder), and a metal rod (see the metal bar that connects the wings to the body of the plane). Out of the three metal rods, it would be possible to find one metal rod on any of these three components on an airplane.<n>B: Choice B is building site. While not as likely to find a metal rod, it is more likely than A. A metal rod is needed for construction to build a foundation for a house or a building, or to construct a bridge. A person building the bridge is likely to have a metal rod, as that is how they would hold the foundation to build the bridge. Other metals not specified include nails and screws, that are both used in construction, as well as a bolt, which is used to connect a metal base to the upper part of the foundation.<n>C: Choice C is store. While it's not likely to find a metal bar there, it's likely you find something that is made out of metal. For instance, a metal container. Metal cans, such as those made by Heinz, can contain beans, sauces, juices, and many other foods. Also, metal baskets, such as those used in the produce section of grocery stores, are a place where you could find metal bars.<n>D: Choice D is engine. Engines need parts made out of metal. A metal bar is a part of the engine that is in direct contact with the piston and the cylinder that the piston is sitting in.<n>E: Choice E is a broken bone. The most likely time for a person to have a broken bone is when they twist unexpectedly or are pushed into something hard. This causes the bone to break, causing a fracture along the bone. This would cause the broken bone in your arm to hold it up, or hold up your leg in your case.<n><n>So the correct answer is D: engine<n><n>**#6**<n><n>Input: A plane can hold two engines, one at each side. Which picture would you most likely see in the cockpit when there are no faults. Choices:  A

Choices:  A: health club B: jocks C: fitness centre D: stadium E: gymnasium<n>Output:		(E)<n><n>Input: The number 83 is an even number because it is the sum of 2 natural numbers, 2 and 41. When we square these numbers, we get, (2 * 2) = 4 and (41 * 41) = 1641. To find the total number of natural numbers <=83 that would result in an even number, we subtract both 4 and 1641 to get 0.<n>Here is the sequence of steps to do this: (i)  Start from 1, and check if the number is <= 83 (ii)  If the number is <= 6 (the number of digits for 83) then go to (iv), otherwise, go to (iii)<n>(iii) If the number of digits of the current number is < 3, then add 4 to the current number, increment 4 and repeat the process.<n>(iii) If not, increase 1 by 4 and keep incrementing 4 (and add 4 to the number) until the current number has more than 3 digits.<n><n>Once you find a number that is <= 83 and has the same number of digits as 83 (in this case, it is 9900 or 10 * 100), subtract 4, the sum of all other natural numbers <=83 from both 4 and 9900 to get -319 (= -9900 - 4).<n>(iv) Increment 4 a couple more times (so 9999 = 4 + 4 + 4), and find the sum of all these numbers. The sum gives you the total number of even numbers <=83. So in this case, 319 + 9999 + 1 = 11219.<n>(v) Now, you subtract this number from 83 to get the number of even numbers <= 83 that are odd numbers. So in this case 11218.<n>So the final Answer is 11217<n><n>Input:<n>Your friend has a birthday on September 17th, which is 10 weeks after your birthday. How long is a week in days?<n>Output: Each week is 7 days long, so subtract 10 from

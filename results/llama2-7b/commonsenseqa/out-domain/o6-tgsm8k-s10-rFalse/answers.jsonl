What does the instruction mean?\n2.  Which question type is the instruction?\n3.  How to answer the questions?\n4.  Practice.\n\n#### Step 1\nThe first step is to understand what the instruction means.  \nIn most cases, the question will come with a statement and number of inputs.  \n\nIt may sound simple. But for some questions, like a lottery game, the statement will not make sense.  \n\nBut if you read the questions with your eyes and brain,  \nit makes sense in 100% the time.  \nThis problem has nothing to do with brain power.  \nBut as the saying goes: \"How many brains does it take to screw in a light bulb?  It depends on whether it's a smart bulb.\"  \nSo when reading statements and instructions, read every sentence.  \nSome sentences have subtle information and the way to answer the question correctly.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 2\nThe second step is to understand what question type the instruction is.  \nTo help with this step, I've created a question type hierarchy and the questions are classified into different question types.  \n\n![Question-type-hierarchy](https://static.xu1000.com//b9006e512c8249c9e20e2846476285f4.png \"Question-type-hiearchy\")\n\nIn the figure, the rightmost column shows the question type", "answer": "B: get laid"}

There is only 1 time, and it should be used equally, that is why he is splitting the 4 total hours equally among different exercises. We would need to have two equations to solve for values of these variables. The first one is total time, as we can see from this equation, the total time will be equal to 2(4) when it is split among different activities. That means we have first equation = total time = 2(4) = 8 hours. Second equation is duration of activities, we know that time is split equally among them, so 4 duration = 4. This equation is now solvable with the second equation we just derived, as one of the variable must be equal to the other, this would give us the answer.\n\n### Instructions: Answer the following multiple choice question\n\nInput: The price of a large popcorn at the movies is \\$3.

He invests every penny that isn't spent on something else. How many years until he first retires?\nOutput: B\n\n### Caveats and Comments\n\nIn our example of the man who saves $2 for every years of his life, the answer is indeed B. However, this problem appears to be a bit misleading. First of all, this person has an income of $24. If we ignore that, then we should ask \"How many years does he wait until he has $24 in his savings account?\" That leads to the solution B, not the one C (where man waits for 89 years, rather than 88).\n\nAlso, the question \"How many years until he first goes to the dentist?\" doesn't make sense on several levels. First of all, that person has no income in those years -- so, there's no savings and zero money to pay the dentist. Secondly, the solution is incorrect -- you are supposed to answer what year he first retires (aka goes to the dentist).", "answer": "B: filing cabinet"}

Thus the sum would be equal to (n choose 2 - 1) + (n choose -1 - 1) = [((n - 3)/2 choose 2) + ((n - 3)/3 choose 3)] + [((n - 1)/ 2 choose 2) - (n-2)/2 choose 1]\n\nInput: What is the value of the following expression? 1/((25/445)/(3/2))\nOutput: 37\n\nInput: Each day 7/25ths of the adult population in country R is absent from work due to illness.

Less than or equal to (<=)\n4. Not at the expense of (not one variable has to be greater than 1/x)\n5. Less than 1\nWhen the objective function is at a maximum the above constraints can be used to convert the variables into the constraints.  To get the decision vector D, you can take the sum of the products of the row vector x and the constraint coeff (C), subtracted by the products of the row x and the solution vector (S) and multiplied by the product of S and x.  If this does not give you a solution you should instead use the product between the constrained vector and the unconstricted vector that is less than 1 / the constraint.  If you cannot find a solution with this step, you have not found an optimal solution.\nWhat is the decision vector D in this case?\nOutput: [-3,3,1]\n\nInput: The objective function is: \u2211 125x^5 + 88x4 - 133x3 - 75x2 + 24 2 The maximum objective function value was: 4474 The constraint matrix (A) is: 93 52 53 2 6 7 8 9 104 359 -149 62 -138 80 -55 31", "answer": "C: being found out"}

One player selects a random number between 1 and double digits and the second player\nattempts to guess the number. Both players win if they guess it on the first attempt. If a player gives up or incorrectly guessed, the\ngame continues with the second player starting. If a player wins, the next round begins with the guessing player.\n\n### The rule\n\nThe number chosen by the guessing player is the minimum and maximum value of the guesses. A player begins by guessing a\nnumber of between 1 and the maximum number. The guessing player guesses the sum of the number chosen by the guessing\nplayer and the original number in the minimum to maximum range. The guessing player then reduces this number to the\nminimum and the original number to the maximum. If he wins, the guessing player takes his turn and the original number is\nreturned to the minimum value, otherwise his turn is over.\n\n### Example:\n\nGuess the game: The first player chooses the number.  \n\nThe game continues with the following steps:  \n\n* The guessing player guesses a number between 1 and 2\n* You guessed 1 + 2 = 3 and 2 + 2 = 4  \n* You guessed from 1 - 2 to 3 + 3 to 4  \n* The guessing number is 4  \n* Your turn ends.  \n\nThe player who correctly guessed the number wins the game.\n\n### Your Challenge\n\nWrite your own version of the \"Guess the Game\" program.

That sentence describes a purchase of a certain item from an arbitrary shop  For example, the sentence John goes to the gym says he goes to gym each day.  The sentence has two words separated by a comma. The first word is the name and the last word is the shop.  \nExample: The first day of the game John went to gym A.\n\nThe second line gives three integers(n, d, w) separated by a comma and space.  The integers represent the time John spends in his work and each value is an hour. n(nights) is a total of time John spends in the gym for several days before the game begins. n is the number of days and w(weeks) is the number of weeks of work. That is, John works and gyms every hour of every single day of the n days before the game begins and there are total n weeks worth of work. The first line represents day w in the nth week.\nFor example,\nThe first day of the game, John went to gym for two hours which is his total work time in the day.\nThe second line contains the number of total hours John spent over the whole week and number of total weeks in that week, for example, the game began at the 7th week of the game and in this week John spent 48 hours.\n\nFor example, the first day of the game was at w=2,7th week the game began and John had an hour break, meaning total hours worked in the day were 4 instead of 6. \n\nAnswers can be found by bruteforcing the possible choices for each variable in the first line.  For example, n=3, then w=2 and n=6, w=3, each of a total of 4 possible combinations for w and n.

In this blog, you'll learn how to take only photos and apply filters, and you'll adjust the lighting on other photos created by an earlier task you'll perform.\n \nLet's begin by reading the question. For this problem, you are allowed to store images in buffers, which act as if they're files. Buffers are not persisted outside the program. Your program should have a single method named `do`. Your task is to call this method at the end of your program, which calls this method again to take photos and apply filters to them.\n![instagram-1](img/instagram/instagram-1.png)\n\n![instagram2](img/in-post2/instagram/in-instagram-1.jpg)\n\n### Step2: Read the sample solution\nYou can read the sample solution by clicking [here](https://github.com/nataliya-koliadynets/Instagram/blob/0.0.1/Instagram.java)\n\n###Step 3: Analytical thinking: Before reading the solution, try to guess what will the solution look like (in your program)  \n**Step 1: Your program should create a method, let say `do()` to accept a picture. You will call this method from within your program so you store one more picture in a buffer/store image. \n**Step 2: Your program should use the `do()` method you created in step 1 to apply the filter to the image. One of the filters is Blur, and one filter could be no filter.**\n\n###Step4: Read the code!\nThis is where the real work happens. Let's read it line by line:\n\n```java\npublic class Instagram\n{\n    public static void main(String[] args)\n    {\n        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\n        Buffer storeImage = new Buffer();\n        Buffer photo = new", "answer": "B: shout at"}

{"text": "A\n\n#### Explanation:\nInput: Adam bought nuts and fruits for $36\n\nThe question is asking for total cost of his purchases.\nThere are two cases.\n\n1. The first one is just nuts. That would mean Adam bought 12 nuts and 25 nuts.\nSo, with $12 for 12 nuts, it would cost: \\$12*12 = 144 \\$\n\nTotal price of nuts, by itself would be $144, and the total for only nuts would be $36\n\n2. The second case is that of only fruits. That would mean Adam buying 260 fruits and 0 nuts.\nWe know that cost for one fruit would be \\$8 because at the store, Adam bought 260 fruots.\n\nSo, \\$1120\\$ would be the total for fruit, because we know there were 1120 of them, and the total 36, so the total cost is \\$1156\\$ \n\nThen, the two are added together, since the first question did not distinguish about fruit.\nSo, total cost would be  $144 +  $1156 =$1300\n\nInput: Johna has spent $480 in weightlifting time\n\nSince he has spent more than 4 hours in weightlifting, the total time is $480/4.

The problem type `Q1.txt`, or `1.txt`, and the solution type `solution_1.txt`, should be concatenated, and this concatenated file should be passed in as an `open` to `solutions`. The file type in this instance is a superset of regular `.py`. You must place the first line of an input `n`, which represents the number of problems, in the input. The answer must be printed as a newline followed by the concatenation of the solution file.<n><n>### Example:<n><n>`python main.py 7` will create `n` problems, one at a time. I recommend printing the output using<n><n>```python<n>out = textwrap.fill(out_file.getvalue(), width=100)<n>fout.write(out + '\n')<n>```<n>so you can watch the number of open files increase throughout the run. `python main.py` should do one of the following:<n>```<n># Print number

There are two types of food items: nuts & dried fruits. We would simply add the cost of both and solve for the final equation.<n><n>$$12n + 8d = 108$$<n>$$1000 = 2(12n + 12d)$$<n>$$625 = 12n + 24d$$<n><n>$$127.5 = n + d$$<n><n>The answer is 62.5.<n><n>### Expected Time Taken: 5 Minutes<n><n>### Explenation on Problem 1:<n><n>**Problem:** We have two variables: duration spent on activities and amount of time in total. There is only 1 time, and it should be used equally, that is why he is splitting the 4 total hours equally among different exercises. We would need to have two equations to solve for values of these variables. The first one is total time, as we can see from this equation, the total time will be equal to 2(4) when it is split among different activities. That means we have first equation = total time = 2(4) = 8 hours. Second equation is duration of activities, we know that time is split equally among them, so 4 duration = 4. This equation is now solvable with the second equation we just derived, as one of the variable must be equal to the other, this would give us the answer.<n><n>### Instructions: Answer the following multiple choice question<n><n>Input: The price of a large popcorn at the movies is \$3.

An X-ray machine has a maximum capacity of 50 patients per day. He runs his business from Monday – Saturday and has scheduled appointments for a total of 565 hours per week. On Sunday he gets no appointments. The machine requires maintenance every 15 hours of operation, so Mr Dillman must schedule maintenance from time to time. A technician is available for maintenance for two days of the week, costing him $10 per hour, and for the other three days has to pay a professional at 3x the rate of the dental technician, for a total of $30 per hour. Mr Dillman has decided to run the same numbers over a period of 24 months to see if the money saved from owning the X-ray machine outweighs the cost of maintaining the machine. If, over two days, the machine was operated for a total of 100 hours, it would require maintenance immediately and no other maintenance for the rest of the period. If the machine lasts the entire 24 months, it would cost an additional $340 to maintain. Additionally, if the machine breaks down at some given point, it would cost another $ 465 to repair it.<n>Output: $246<n><n>

Choices:  A: make B: raise C: entice D: build E: fix<n>Output:		 D: build<n><n>### Hints:<n><n>#### Instruction:<n><n>First check what is the maximum weight Adam can buy. The cost of the item is $x for 1 unit and $12x for 3 unit, so the maximum weight he can buy is $12x. If he buy $12x kilogram, $12x * 3 = total cost = 36x. Subtact 24k = 12x which is his total spend.<n><n>#### Instruction 2: <n><n>Solution: If we can use the function to solve problem, we can just calculate number of minutes by 30.<n><n>#### Instructions:<n><n>Solution: Since John goes 3 times a week, so 3*4 = 12 hours for him. For extra tank, multiply current tank. We must get $200 * 4 = 800. If fuel rise by 20% so $480 - $320. We get extra $160.<n><n>####Instructions:<n><n>If we assume that sum of goal scored by different two players in two matches account for 20% then total sum of goals they scored are 600. Since they score equal goals we get 150*(20%/100) = 30.<n>#### Instructions 2:<n>#####Answer:<n><n>If Tom drinks 5C + 64w = 70. Since w can fill in the remaining 300 oz.<n><n>### Hint:<n><n>To calculate the time it took to fill the barn up use nested nested for loops, calculate the total hours one by only, then iterate over the second loop adding in each one of the person's time spent, finally add it to the sum.<n><n># Hints:<n>```python<n>import sys, time<n>sys.stdout = open(sys.argv[1], 'w')<n>def sum(i):<n>    c = -1<n>    if i == 0:<n>        return 0<n>    elif i == 3:<n>        return c<n>    else:<n>        print('i:{}, c:{}, '.format( i, c))<n>        c = c + sum(i - 1)<n>        print('c:{}

He invests every penny that isn't spent on something else. How many years until he first retires?<n>Output: B<n><n>### Caveats and Comments<n><n>In our example of the man who saves $2 for every years of his life, the answer is indeed B. However, this problem appears to be a bit misleading. First of all, this person has an income of $24. If we ignore that, then we should ask "How many years does he wait until he has $24 in his savings account?" That leads to the solution B, not the one C (where man waits for 89 years, rather than 88).<n><n>Also, the question "How many years until he first goes to the dentist?" doesn't make sense on several levels. First of all, that person has no income in those years -- so, there's no savings and zero money to pay the dentist. Secondly, the solution is incorrect -- you are supposed to answer what year he first retires (aka goes to the dentist).<n>

The result is surprisingly large. However, for four or more people the result is a finite number that does not depend on the particular number of people. What is the formula for the number of ways that four people can arrange themselves to prevent an odd number of legs from touching each other?<n>Output: For any number of people n, we can calculate the number of possible arrangements by taking a sum of the number of ways to arrange the people so they stand in only 2s or 3s, which is just (n choose 2) + (n choose 3), and subtracting these two terms (with appropriate changes to n) because the people with the same number of legs must stand the same way. Thus the sum would be equal to (n choose 2 - 1) + (n choose -1 - 1) = [((n - 3)/2 choose 2) + ((n - 3)/3 choose 3)] + [((n - 1)/ 2 choose 2) - (n-2)/2 choose 1]<n><n>Input: What is the value of the following expression? 1/((25/445)/(3/2))<n>Output: 37<n><n>Input: Each day 7/25ths of the adult population in country R is absent from work due to illness.

Less than or equal to (<=)<n>4. Not at the expense of (not one variable has to be greater than 1/x)<n>5. Less than 1<n>When the objective function is at a maximum the above constraints can be used to convert the variables into the constraints.  To get the decision vector D, you can take the sum of the products of the row vector x and the constraint coeff (C), subtracted by the products of the row x and the solution vector (S) and multiplied by the product of S and x.  If this does not give you a solution you should instead use the product between the constrained vector and the unconstricted vector that is less than 1 / the constraint.  If you cannot find a solution with this step, you have not found an optimal solution.<n>What is the decision vector D in this case?<n>Output: [-3,3,1]<n><n>Input: The objective function is: ∑ 125x^5 + 88x4 - 133x3 - 75x2 + 24 2 The maximum objective function value was: 4474 The constraint matrix (A) is: 93 52 53 2 6 7 8 9 104 359 -149 62 -138 80 -55 31

One player selects a random number between 1 and double digits and the second player<n>attempts to guess the number. Both players win if they guess it on the first attempt. If a player gives up or incorrectly guessed, the<n>game continues with the second player starting. If a player wins, the next round begins with the guessing player.<n><n>### The rule<n><n>The number chosen by the guessing player is the minimum and maximum value of the guesses. A player begins by guessing a<n>number of between 1 and the maximum number. The guessing player guesses the sum of the number chosen by the guessing<n>player and the original number in the minimum to maximum range. The guessing player then reduces this number to the<n>minimum and the original number to the maximum. If he wins, the guessing player takes his turn and the original number is<n>returned to the minimum value, otherwise his turn is over.<n><n>### Example:<n><n>Guess the game: The first player chooses the number.  <n><n>The game continues with the following steps:  <n><n>* The guessing player guesses a number between 1 and 2<n>* You guessed 1 + 2 = 3 and 2 + 2 = 4  <n>* You guessed from 1 - 2 to 3 + 3 to 4  <n>* The guessing number is 4  <n>* Your turn ends.  <n><n>The player who correctly guessed the number wins the game.<n><n>### Your Challenge<n><n>Write your own version of the "Guess the Game" program.

That sentence describes a purchase of a certain item from an arbitrary shop  For example, the sentence John goes to the gym says he goes to gym each day.  The sentence has two words separated by a comma. The first word is the name and the last word is the shop.  <n>Example: The first day of the game John went to gym A.<n><n>The second line gives three integers(n, d, w) separated by a comma and space.  The integers represent the time John spends in his work and each value is an hour. n(nights) is a total of time John spends in the gym for several days before the game begins. n is the number of days and w(weeks) is the number of weeks of work. That is, John works and gyms every hour of every single day of the n days before the game begins and there are total n weeks worth of work. The first line represents day w in the nth week.<n>For example,<n>The first day of the game, John went to gym for two hours which is his total work time in the day.<n>The second line contains the number of total hours John spent over the whole week and number of total weeks in that week, for example, the game began at the 7th week of the game and in this week John spent 48 hours.<n><n>For example, the first day of the game was at w=2,7th week the game began and John had an hour break, meaning total hours worked in the day were 4 instead of 6. <n><n>Answers can be found by bruteforcing the possible choices for each variable in the first line.  For example, n=3, then w=2 and n=6, w=3, each of a total of 4 possible combinations for w and n. Then for every possible combination of 4 answers, that gives you the number of total possible answers.<n><n>In the end your output is the word START in the first day of the nth week of the game.

In this blog, you'll learn how to take only photos and apply filters, and you'll adjust the lighting on other photos created by an earlier task you'll perform.<n> <n>Let's begin by reading the question. For this problem, you are allowed to store images in buffers, which act as if they're files. Buffers are not persisted outside the program. Your program should have a single method named `do`. Your task is to call this method at the end of your program, which calls this method again to take photos and apply filters to them.<n>![instagram-1](img/instagram/instagram-1.png)<n><n>![instagram2](img/in-post2/instagram/in-instagram-1.jpg)<n><n>### Step2: Read the sample solution<n>You can read the sample solution by clicking [here](https://github.com/nataliya-koliadynets/Instagram/blob/0.0.1/Instagram.java)<n><n>###Step 3: Analytical thinking: Before reading the solution, try to guess what will the solution look like (in your program)  <n>**Step 1: Your program should create a method, let say `do()` to accept a picture. You will call this method from within your program so you store one more picture in a buffer/store image. <n>**Step 2: Your program should use the `do()` method you created in step 1 to apply the filter to the image. One of the filters is Blur, and one filter could be no filter.**<n><n>###Step4: Read the code!<n>This is where the real work happens. Let's read it line by line:<n><n>```java<n>public class Instagram<n>{<n>    public static void main(String[] args)<n>    {<n>        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);<n>        Buffer storeImage = new Buffer();<n>        Buffer photo = new

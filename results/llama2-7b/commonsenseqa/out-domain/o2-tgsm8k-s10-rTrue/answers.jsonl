The peak had not yet been reached, as 11 had been rescued by the end of the journey.  How many remained of the 15?\nOutput: From 1 to 12 is an even number\n\nBecause if we had 11 already that means that we would have to add 10 and then when we add 10 we get an even number (it goes right to 20)\nAnd since there is no 20 we should add 1 again and once again this is an even number.\n\nSo the answer is 2\n\nInput: A company, making baked items,  purchased 150 pounds of wheat in one month. Another company purchased the same amount of wheat in 2 months.  Which company purchased how many pounds of wheat in the fewer months? How many pounds of wheat did the companies purchase in all?\nOutput: Total = 1500, monthly = 300\nAnother company purchased 150 in 2 months, so in 3 months they would only have 300 pounds left of wheat.\nThey would only have enough wheat to last them 3 months.\n\nIf we were looking at the first company their wheat had to last them 1 month.\nSo the second company had to buy more wheat to last them longer as they bought less wheat in 1 month than the first company did in 1 month, even though they had the same amount of wheaten to last them in 2 months.\n\n\nSo for the first company we would divide the 150 by 2 and multiply it by 12.\nThen get 150 x 12/2=600\nThe other company would do 150 x (12/3) = 150 x ((12/3)) = 400\nSo firstly we have 600 + 400 (600 + 300) = 900 pounds", "answer": "B: refrigerator"}

Choices A: speak freely B c: Happiness of a child D: school E: control children\n\nOutput: A c\n\nInput: A car can travel for 10 hours if it has 15 gallons of gas, and can go for 15 hours if it has 5 gallons of gas. Given that the car takes on the same amount of fuel in each filling, for approximately how much is the car capable of traveling?\n\nOutput: Because both gas fills were 3 gallons it would take 15 hours/3 and 10 hours/3 so it would take approximately 5 hours\n\nInput: The amount of gas a train uses on an average day is 5 times the amount a train uses in an hour on the same day. If the train uses 62 gallons on an average day and takes 6 hours, what is the number of hours it takes for the train to travel 312 miles?\n\nOutput: The distance the train travels each hour is 62/5 miles. So the train travels 312/62=<<312/60=5>> miles a day. Then divide by 5, which is the time interval it takes before each train stops for 5 hours. So the answer is 64/5, or 12.92, which rounds to 13\n\nInput: Which function is more equal to the function of y = 3x + 44?

So, option A, represents the sheath which is the thing that actually holds the sword. Option B is the place where a sword is stored when it isn't being wielded at anyone.

{"text": "Since fishing requires the fisherman to cast their line and reel it in, this rod would be best categorized as a sporting good to a fisherman.  This makes sense because hardware stores sell tools.  Engine stores sell cars.  Hardware stores were historically run by a blacksmith and hardware can be used to fix hardware. Therefore, a hardware store is run by a blacksmither (a crafter of tools). But furniture, gym equipment, and camping equipment are typically sold at home goods stores.

The hardware store would not be able to sell a \"sporting good,\" rather it sells tools.  While the engine may be able to fix the rod, it would not be a hardware store (tools, not motor vehicles). The furniture store and hardware store are not appropriate since they sell other goods than that the fishing rod.

The algorithmic language that is spoken by the programmer is Lingo. It consists of two types of words: A \u201cregular\u201d word and an \u201cidiomatic\u201d word. The regular word corresponds to a value in the algorithmic language and can be compared with \u201coperators\u201d. The first two idiomatic words were \u201cand\u201d and \u201cor\u201d which were later on extended to other functions.\n\nPrograms are written by \u201cprogrammers.\u201d When a programmer writes a program he specifies how the program shall evaluate. The programmer specifies \u201cwhat the program does\u201d in a list containing the \u201cactions\u201d of the program. When a program is finished it usually contains a total of 100 to 500 actions. The programming language has been extended with programming functions in order to make the programming easy for the programmers.\n\nThe idiomatic word can be a function. Some of the functions that can be used are:  and, or, for, not, and while.\n\nThese functions can work in combination. That means when using for example and, not, the not part, or the for part may be changed such that \u201cor\u201d is added to", "answer": "B: fast food restaurant"}

{"text": "There can be many atoms in the same space, but there can only be one atom per space, therefore only one atom per molecule. So you can have something with many atoms but only one molecule.\nSo the final ans is D: hands\n\nInput:A is the square root of -1. What is A squared?\nOutput: A squared can be thought of as \"the square root squared.\" This is impossible to express, at least in conventional algebra and arithmetic, because the square root is always negative (recall that the square root of 4 is -2). Hence, \"a squared\" is undefined in those terms. But consider the complex plane. If A is a complex number, then A^2 is a complex number as well (it can be thought of as A raised to the 2nd order or power). The complex plane is the plane of numbers where i = sqrt(-1), so a complex number with real part A and imaginary part B is of the form a + bi where a and b are real and A = ai and B = bi.\nThe real part of the square of A is A^2, which is (ai)^2 = ai^2 + bi^2, = ai^2 + b^2 + 2 ai bi. The imaginary part of the square of a complex number is bi^2. So a^2 = (ai)^2 = [ai x bi]^2 = a^2 + b^^2 =a^2 + b^x b^2.\nNow b^2 = -b^x, because b^x must have the same real part as b, and the same real part as -1.\n[ai x bi]^x = ai^2 + (bi)^2\n[ai x bi ]^x = ai^x x (bi)^x.\nTherefore, A^2 = a^x x (bi^x)^y, where a^x is written a/sqrt(x) and (bi)^x is written b/(sqrt(x)).\n\n\nTo find out the final answer:\n\nIn the above line a^x is written as a/sqrt(x). So the real part of a is sqrt(x) [a^x]. Similarly bi^x is written as b/sqrt(x). Therefore the real part of the final answer is (sqrt(x)[a", "answer": "E: hands"}

Output: A) B) C) D) E) F) G)\n\nInput:  \nSometimes you see a number and are asked, \"Is this a prime number?\", and sometimes you see a number and you are asked \"is this a composite number?\".  A quick way to figure out if a number \"a\" is prime or composite is to write \"a\" in its factor form (you might divide \"a\" by its factors to get those numbers, but that's not necessary): if any of those numbers from a is prime then a is also prime; and if any of those numbers are composite, then a is also composite.  For composite numbers, there is a rule of thumb that if \"a\" is the smallest prime number that divides \"a\", then \"a\" is a composite number.  Prime number is the opposite extreme: if any number except \"a\" divides \"a\", \"a\" is a prime number.  In a composite there are factors besides 1 and the number itself that multiply to give the number (e.g. 21, with factors 3 and 7, and itself); in a prime there are only factors 1 and the number (e. g 23 has factors only 1 and 23).\n\nInput: 21 as number to check\nOutput::  B Composite Number\n\nInput:24 as number to check\nInput:242 as number to check\n\nOutput: A Prime Number\n\nInput: 51 as number to check - 51 is odd number since 51/2 is 25.5\nOutput::  A Prime Number\n\nAnswer: Prime = 1\n\nComposite = any numbers that are not 1.\n\nSo when you're asked \"prime\" or \"composite\" what are you really thinking about is, Is it a perfect number (1), is it a Mersenne prime (0), or is it Fermat prim (1), or is it Fibonacci (0)?\n\nWe also have things like Goldbach's Conjecture that tells us that any number > 2 (and of an odd parity) has a Goldbach divisor.", "answer": "C: solitude"}

Positive change is towards the right whereas negative change lies in the direction towards the left.\n\u0394t is the Change in Time.\n\nUsing the above equation:\n\nVelocity = (15miles) / (30-seconds)=180 mph\n\nDue to the brakes that are applied it brings the velocity down to 0 mph.\n\nNow we know that it's velocity in the beginning was 90 mph which means now it has gone down to 0 mpe.\n\nWe need to minus the negative quantity from the zero which will give us 90 mph.", "answer": "A: sights"}

The dog will lose a maximum of 3/2 health or 1.5 health per day. If that day the temperature is 10*C or lower, the dog will be ok. If that day is above 10*C then no amount of health will make the dog ok.  If the temperature will be above 10*0, then the dog will lose 3/2+1=1.5 health that day OR if the temperature will be below 10*0 then the dog will lose an average of 1.5 health that week OR the dog will lose just that 1.5 health.  So if that day the temperature is above 10 the dog loses 1.5 health and if that day is below 10 the dog will lose no health.  We will assume that temperature will always increase and that there will not be days where the temperature will suddenly go away. So for the question:  How many days did dog stay outside when it is 5*C?  There are 3 possibilities  (0, 1 or 2 or more)\nThe answer to this question is 2\n\nInput: This is the answer to the last problem! How many days did the animal stay outside when it is -1*C?  The answer is 0!  \n\nIf we subtract we get 1.5 - 0 = 1.5 Health is subtracted.  \nIf we add we get 0 + 1.5 = 1.5  Health is added.  \n\nThis means that we can subtract -1.5 from any other numbers to get the health that we want.  You probably realize that at least 8*C is too hot and 0*C is too cold.  (At least as long as we assume that the temperature is increasing)  \nTherefore we need to subtract -1.5.  (We'll let 2 days represent 1*C)\nIf the temperature is 9*C", "answer": "C: frustration"}

Every member of the Chessy team contributed at different times in the day.  How many days did they work on Chessy?\nOutput: They worked on Chessy for 6 days. How? Well...  You can easily find a solution to this puzzle by diving into how long each of the members works everyday.  (Computer Vision: 9 hours per day, AI: 7 hours, etc.)  Now that we know that member A works 9 hours per day on average, he works for 198/9=61 days.  (rounded to the next integer)\nNow that we have a solution, to make it complete we must find the total days worked.  It's simply addition: 61/9, 151/9, etc.  Which can be written as: 150/9, which reduces to 16/9, which is 1/3 or 1 day.\n\nSo the final answer for this is 61 + 1 = 62 (which is a rounded number)\n\nInput: A dog has $100 in cash, and the owner wishes for the dog to get a dog bone when he spends $75 or more.

If they do not come then it will be the king or one of his children, or their family.\nThe most obvious answer here is A: the king, since he has the last name.\nIf another option, like B: the new king is picked then the family will have two last names, which is not possible.\nBut the answer here is actually B: The new king.\nIf you notice that this will result to 33 children of the king and their families.\nIf you want to have the king and his children all gathered, then one needs to subtract 33.\n14 kids plus their families means 33.\nIf the invitation is ignored then it will just result to 33.\nWithout counting it as a family or a name, or the king in itself, then subtracting 33 is what's needed to have all gathered.\nThe answer here is B: The new king\n\nInput:What is the highest number?  399\nOutput: 999\nSo the correct answer is 999\n\n#### 0.

{"text": "Grooming: nail polish, clothing, makeup (hair, nails), etc is often considered a way to showcase yourself and look attractive. However, many teenagers may feel self-conscious over grooming habits that are not deemed socially normal. Teenage self-consciousness over grooming may lead to selfishness and mistakes during your first job and throughout the rest of your life. These mistakes can be as large as not keeping a workplace clean on a large scale or a minor offense of using an over-the-counter deodorant that the boss may deem unnecessary and unacceptable. Finally, if a teen is self-conscious over their grooming habits, they begin to feel dissatisfaction with not being accepted as they are.\nThis is because, at a younger age, people are much more likely to make mistakes, because they are not quite as sharp and knowledgeable as people that are older, just because they are young, and a teen is in a way young, but not as a literal human, young as they are much more in tune with the outside world around them and they see the world for what it is and the truth of the matter is not very pretty at all, not that there is an underlying issue, it is because of ignorance and prejudice, like always being bullied and called names.", "answer": "D: cleanliness"}

{"text": "A\n\n### Rationale: The correct options are: A, E\n\n### Note: The options should not include a period.\n\n### Input \n\nInput: One way to think about how our world has changed is to explore the differences between two periods (e.g. 1945 and 2015, the 1990s and the present, and the 1960s and the present).\nRationales:\nTo do so, one can  use the calendar as a \"time machine\" to see the changes. \n\nIn that way, we can see that science has significantly changed the way we live.  As an example, a 1945 calendar shows one day is dedicated to a \"work\" holiday and another to a \"fun\" holiday, with many days allotted for religious services, \nBut in a 2015 calendar it shows only two of those \"holidays\" are still celebrated.\nA 1945 family would spend much of the day at home and do not have the luxury to go out for dinner \nIn a 2019 calendar, one finds that it almost impossible to meet friends in person, unless you eat in restaurants.\n\n### Output:The correct answer is A.\n\n### Rationales: The answer does not include a period. The answer is \"appreciation of nature\".\n\n### Input\nInput: How many weeks are in a year? Choices: A: 52 B: 52\n\nRationales: To answer this question, we can use the calendar as a \u201c\ntime machine\u201d to see the past.\n\nAccording to the traditional calendar, we can see that every 7 days, there is the \u201cstart of the week\u201d and every 7 days the \u201cend of the week\u201d, as well\nas every 181 years or 129000 weeks there is the start of a new century. \nIn addition, according to the traditional Chinese calendar, there is a special day called \"Gengzi\" day every 78 years, as well as every 10 years a day 10 named and every 60 years, a 20 -day period is also named by a special name.

{"text": "D\n\n### Instructions:This task asks you to use logic to solve multiple choice questions.\n\n### Task input:A man has to get home from work. He rides a bus that takes him halfway to his work then walking the rest of the way. However, he walks faster than the bus takes him home. If he has enough time, he also walks to work, even though it's further than the bus ride home. How many minutes does he get home?\n\n### Answer:30 or 60\n\n### Explain:The bus ride is exactly half the distance to work in 40 minutes if he takes it to the end of the road. The first half of the bus ride is 20 minutes to the end of the bus journey home. It can take someone walking to get there, so they walk the halfway home in the first half their bus journey. So the amount of the bus journey to the same bus stop they got off the bus at. So the distance of 20 minutes back plus 20 minutes to get to where he got off at is 40 minutes. So the answer is either 20 or 40 minutes if they get home in the halfway to the stop.\n\n#### 60\n\n\n\n### Input :A person wants to get from the United States to the country of Jamaica, which is further west.

He paid a total of $4 for $14 bottles of water.  How much money did he save or spend?\n\n### Response\n\nThe problem can be rephrased as:\n\n\\**How much did he spent if it is $14 per 2-ltr. bottle**\n\n\\- If we know \\*total_cost\\*  = $4, which is equal to \\*total_product*.\n\nSo, the question must be:\n\nHow much did he bought in 1 liters and 2 liters.  We already know that:\n\n\\*total_product = x + y =>x = \\*total_product*-y\n\nI will assume that the total number of liters bought = (1l + 2l)/2 =.5l\n\nSo, the answer must be: \\*5l-2l\\* = 3l\n\n### Rationales\nTotal cost is equal to the sum of the prices multiplied by the number of products.\nIf we are given that there are 14 liters of water, the total cost is equal to:\n\n$4*(14/2) = $14 - $4*(14/10) = $14 // because there are 10 liters in a 2-liter\n\nThe formula in rationales is for when if Ian bought one liter bottles at a store the total price of that water will be\n\n\\$4*$5 = $20\n\nWe need to find out how many liters is \\$4*20 = \\$80\n\n\nAnswer choices are:\nA.

{"text": "What is love when everyone has a different experience of feeling it?\n\n#### 2\nRationales:  Love could be contagious, but feelings change because feelings come from inside oneself. Sometimes these feelings are pleasant ones, and sometimes they are unpleasant ones as in the case of painful feelings. As such, love would be contagious since it is an experience, but love could not be love without the person having experienced it.\n\n### Input1:  The student's professor was talking in their math class about the speed of light. He said that if light moves at a certain speed which is 300,000 km/sec, then what is the distance from Earth to the Sun?\n\n### Response1:\n3 times 10^3 light years.\n\n### Rationale:\n#### 15\nAnswer: Light takes 8 minutes to reach Earth, so the distance from Earth to Sun is roughly 8 * 60 * 60 *10***-3 miles = 3 million miles\nThe closest planet to the sun is Mercury since it is only 4 to 7.5 times 10^9 kilometers away.

We are happier! :) :) :)\n\n#### 1\nRationales: Happiness is a perception of contentment. Some people think that the key to happiness is to achieve a goal. However, many people do not pursue goals and thus do just as well as if they had pursued their goals. As such, happiness is more a product of one's state of mind than anything else.", "answer": "A: contagious"}

{"text": "A) A helm is a lever attached to a steering mechanism that controls the rudder on a ship at sea. It is not worn on the top of your head as shown in the textbook definition.\n\n### Input\nThe helm is not somthing that you wear on your head but rather is used to control the steering mechanism on a large sailing ship at sea. How much does it cost you to get there?\n\n### Response\n\nThis response will require a step by step approach since you are asked how much a helm cost.\nWe know that the helms are for ships that have rigging/riggs and sail a sea at sea. Let start by finding out an approximate price range and then from there find the precise price for the helm.\nLet use the internet to answer this question, we assume that the internet is correct and that the information is not skewed.\n\nSo we assume the cost of the helm to be between 10-$600( this is just a range, not an exact price range)\nSo let us find a specific price range for a specific helm\nThere are a few companies that make helms. Now the question would be what one of these companies/manufacturer\u2019s is the cheaper one.\n\nLet's us pretend that there are two companies that make helms, the helm company and the second helm company. The Helm manufacturer are the cheaper ones compared to the second helm.\n\nBut lets pretend that the price range is $600-$50 and the helm is the helm manufacture which means its the cheaper one. The reason for using the helm as an example is that it has better specifications than the second helm company and second hand helms are usually priced at 5% of the initial price so if I did 10% of the first helm price which would be $5 a helm I would have $99/4=<<99/4=$25.00>>25.00 which is exactly 1/2 of the 2 helm companies prices\n\nSo for 2 helm i would spend 50+80=$<<50+80=>>130.00\nBut for the helm company I would spend 25.00 + 50=<<", "answer": "A: sailing vessel"}

So since you need to make 12 dishes of 22 that means:  <<1/2 =0.5>>0.5 to be a multiple of 2 since 22 is dividable by 2, since the answer will be a multiple of 5 since 22 is a multiple of 5\n\n#### 0.5\nAnswer: 0.5", "answer": "D: contaminated"}

The problem asked about what happened to the y-coordinate of point \"a\" after the given transformation is made. The choices were a) y increases by -0.5 b) y increases by 0.5 c) y stays the same d) y decreases by 0.5 e) y decreases by -0,5. The right answer was e) (y decreases by -0.5). The rationales of why the answer was \"e\" was that the y values were only ever increasing or decreasing by an even value, meaning it would've been odd number. The point \"A\" would always have a value of -3 if it stayed the same or increased or decreased by an even number, so the only other even number would be 0, and the y value for the point \"A\" would change to a negative by 0.5. The rationales for why the answer was \"d\" (which should be 0.5 not -0.5 if y increased by 1, was that the point \"A\" also has to stay within the y axis values. If the y axis goes from -9 to 8, then if A changed y values from -3 to -2, then the original point A would have to change y values from 3 to 2. It is not possible to go down to a negative -0.5, so it would have to be a positive 0.5\n\n### Response\n-I don't really understand\n\n### Input : An archaeologist has just excavated an artefact, which they believe to be from the Bronze Age.

As for the second one, i assumed that \u201c3\u201d should be in the 10 and 7 should be in the 2, this makes the first one 4 and the second one 5. As for the last, i assumed that \u201c4\u201d should be in the first one and the \u201c7\u201d in the second. This makes the first expression to be 5, the second one 7, and the last one 12.

{"text": "#### 3\nAnswer: 3\n\n### Instructions:\nA team leader and a team member go to the airport from opposite directions. The leader gets off at two stations earlier from the end of the subway line, and the other one gets off at one station earlier than the leader but after the leader's station. Who catches up with whom first, and how long does it take for the team member to catch up with the team leader?\n\n### Rationales:\nSo the question asks both the team leader and team member to get off the subway. The team leader gets off 1 station earlier than the team member. Since the question starts with 2 stations before the end of the line, the team leader has to get off at two stations into the line. That means the team member would have to get off at three stations earlier that the leader, so he needs to get off two stops earlier than the leader on the first station after the leader\u2019s stop.\n\nHe catches up with the leader when the leader moves from a red light after getting off the subway. Once the leader moves from a light, the team member will have to use a train to catch up with him. Since it took the team member two stops between his stop and the team leaders, two stops for the train, and then another two stops to catch up, total it takes six stops for the team member to get to the same stop on the line as the team leader. Since the team leader stopped on the second station when it was a red light, the 6 stops to the team member\u2019s is 6-2 = <<6-2=4>>4 stops more to the team member than to the team leader.\n\n#### 4\n#### 3\n#### 4\n\n####4 4 and 4 3 are the correct answers.\n\n### Input ChoicesA: Laymen C: Specialists\n\n#### Answer:\n4 B\n\n### Input B:Laymen\n\n### Answer:C\n\n#### 4 and 3", "answer": "C: study"}

His grandfather is 62 and a retired soldier. He knows the boy is growing up and that one day the boy will need to fight for his country, so he decides to teach him to hunt to prepare.\nIn a year, he is 6 years old, and he has grown strong. His grandfather takes him to the forest, where he hunts his first bird using a bow and arrow. The old man taught the boy how to tie the bow. The boy is now 7 years old \n\nRationales:The following year, the boy is 8 and his grandfather teaches him how to use a knife. The grandson, now 9, can make basic spears. The next year, he is 10, and can make spears with two sharp spikes to hunt larger animals.

{"text": "I think the answer is E, which is woman's hair. A human hair should weigh about a gram.\n\n### Rationale: You might think, at first, that the best answer is B. This might seem true for many people, since a person typically cuts their hair at a barber shop. However, it should be clear to you now that women typically also go to the hair salon, and do not necessarily visit only the barber shop. Also, women may prefer to cut their own hair, or may have cut it themselves before visiting the hair salon. Lastly, a person may cut their hair without visiting a professional hair salon.\n\n#### Hair is composed primarily of protein.  This is because hair is made primarily of a protein called keratin. Keratin is the main part of a hair shaft, which is the part of a hair that protrudes from the root. Some hairs have keratin in both the shaft and the root, while others have keratin in the shaft and not the base. The protein fibers that make up a typical hair are much lighter than the water that it normally holds. However, these proteins are less dense than oils, which is why dry, coated hair can be weighed.\nIn general, hair has the lowest density of material among the organic elements of the human body. The densities of organic tissue in the human body (in units of dkg/cm\u00b3) are:\n\nIn terms of mass, the average human hair has a mass of 2.2mg, and the hair on the head has a mass of 65 mg. The density of hair is roughly 1 mg/cm\u00b3, but these estimates are based on the human body, and thus cannot be used to compare the density of different hair samples.\n\n#### The hair's weight varies according to factors such as climate. It depends on how often a person cuts his/her hair and the degree of stress.\n\n#### When a person cuts their hair, they will notice that a significant amount of hair is shed. They may also notice that the hair on their head appears to have a lower density than other types of hair. The density of a human scalp is about 2.3 mg/cm\u00b3. Since human scalp hair tends to have a very low density, the density of other hairs tends to", "answer": "A: hair salon"}

For instance, the jump would occur if you started with 49 people in the theater with the movie length of 8.3 or 10 people in the theater and having the movie length of 2.2.\nThere is a possibility that the movie length would change due to the number of people.\n(3)\nWhen you start with 10 people in a theater, as long as there are more than 30 people in a the theater, the movie duration would change.\n#### 51 to 100\nAnswer: 51 to 79\n\n#### 51\nAnswer: 50\n\n### Input 1:  A: small knight B: small elephant C: large elephant D: small giraffe E: small tiger\n\n### Response", "answer": "D: chess board"}

The microphone boom is used to prevent the microphone from hitting any other objects near it. \n\n#### B\n\n### rationaleses: \n  When you attend concerts, it is the performers who are singing and dancing on stage that catch your attention as the best-looking, and sometimes best-performing, part of the event. However, there is another critical aspect of a concert; a microphone boom. The performance won't be well recorded if the performers are moving around and sometimes not in the best position. If the microphone is being shaky, that will also affect the audio quality. Therefore, the microphone is mounted on the stage where it can track all movements of the performers. \n\n#### C\n\n### rationalesis:\n  Microphone booms are often built into your entertainment centers and can be seen as large antennas on the top of your devices. You can also find them on live television studio broadcasts as well as on concert stages. The microphone booms on your TV help to track the movement of the performers on stage for the camera's best view. \n\n#### D\n\n### rationalisis:\nThe microphone boom may seem like a simple device but it plays a critical roll of keeping the audio clear, and helping maintain the audio level for the performer to deliver the vocals to the audience. Live events in general use microphone booms whether they are at a stadium for a sports event or in an auditorium for a stage performance..\n\n#### E\n\n### rationalis:\nThe microphone in a recording studio has to be able to move easily to capture all the tones from the vocalist as well as the bass and drums. When the microphone has to be at a different height or angle over a performance, the microphone needs to be able to move, hence the microphone boom.\n\n### Output:\n\n| Output Name       |  Output Type |  \n| :-----------------:  | :----------  :  |", "answer": "A: new york"}

Damage is harm that a fire causes. We see a fire burning a wooden house. If a person starts a fire at a wooden house and then damages the house to a point where he or she might have to be taken to jail, then the damage is the word that best explains what has happened. \n\nB: The word that best explains where the person will be taken when he or she is hurt as a result of the fire is going to jail. Going to jail is the most likely sentence for most serious fire damage. The fire burning down a house is enough damage to land the offender in jail. Hence, going to jail is the best word to explain what is likely to happen.\n\nC: A fire could injure someone or even kill the person. However, the injury that results from a fire burns. As such, the only burns that might result from a fire are the burns.  If there are burns, then the person is expected to visit a doctor to ensure he or she is medically fit before returning to school. As such, the word best explains what happens to someone who is hurt in a fire. Hence, burns is a fitting word to use in this case.\n\nD: The word best explains what happens when you cause harm to someone or to their property. The harm is destruction. As such, the harm to the home after a fire caused by setting a house could result in the offender getting sent to jail. However, in such a case, the fire damage would lead to the destruction of the house due to the fire. \n\nE: Destruction causes harm. Harm happens with fire. We see that a fire causes harm to the people whose houses are destroyed. So, a fire could cause", "answer": "B: going to jail"}

It is good to contact relatives so they can be there for you when you and your family is in need.\n* In D, self medication or just doing what you want won't give you a solution, or give a better result to be honest.

{"text": "The correct answer is E\n\n### Justification: Breakfast at home involves eating with a large family which leads to piles of dirty dishes that need to be wash by someone.  When I go grocery shopping, I try to buy less in the morning, lunch and breakfast food which can be reheated, but dinner needs to be cooked completely, and this tends to create the worst dirty dish piles, but it's not as bad as having a bunch of kids under age 10.  I also wash dishes after cooking every meal, while I don't do that I work as much because it's hard to keep up with grocery shopping for our family with two kids and two of us working, but it is always important to me that I cook every meal with love for them.  I don't really care about what breakfast will taste like because my stomach will make it's own judgment unless I eat too many of specific foods, but one of the kids will always have something bad to say about breakfast, and this will lead to the entire breakfast being scrapped so we can start over so we all have a better day while having better breath (though eating toxic foods in the morning would be a turn-off from better breath), which in the kitchen would create a pile of dirty dishes.\n\n### Input/Response: Which of the following is NOT a step in making a list?

I do know that I can make the list in the notebook and it will last until school closes, but if that's the case the 2 list item shouldn't be in the list, but instead in a different part of the notebook that I plan to use for something else.\n\n### Task 2\nYou are going", "answer": "E: dirty dishes"}

The peak had not yet been reached, as 11 had been rescued by the end of the journey.  How many remained of the 15?<n>Output: From 1 to 12 is an even number<n><n>Because if we had 11 already that means that we would have to add 10 and then when we add 10 we get an even number (it goes right to 20)<n>And since there is no 20 we should add 1 again and once again this is an even number.<n><n>So the answer is 2<n><n>Input: A company, making baked items,  purchased 150 pounds of wheat in one month. Another company purchased the same amount of wheat in 2 months.  Which company purchased how many pounds of wheat in the fewer months? How many pounds of wheat did the companies purchase in all?<n>Output: Total = 1500, monthly = 300<n>Another company purchased 150 in 2 months, so in 3 months they would only have 300 pounds left of wheat.<n>They would only have enough wheat to last them 3 months.<n><n>If we were looking at the first company their wheat had to last them 1 month.<n>So the second company had to buy more wheat to last them longer as they bought less wheat in 1 month than the first company did in 1 month, even though they had the same amount of wheaten to last them in 2 months.<n><n><n>So for the first company we would divide the 150 by 2 and multiply it by 12.<n>Then get 150 x 12/2=600<n>The other company would do 150 x (12/3) = 150 x ((12/3)) = 400<n>So firstly we have 600 + 400 (600 + 300) = 900 pounds<n><n>

Choices:  A: botanic garden B: flower garden C: backyard D: supermarket E: outdoors<n>Output:		Answers: A: botanic garden, B: flower garden, D: supermarket, E: outdoors So the correct answer is A: botanic garden<n><n>Input: You have 250 coins available: 92 pennies, 66 nickels, 25 dimes, 12 quarters, and 8 half-dollars. What is the least amount of money you can make? Input: For each penny: p=.01, for each nickel: n=$.05, for each dime: d=$.10, for each quarter: q=.25, for each half dollars: h=.5<n>Output:$1.05 for three coins. Output:$2.75 for four coins. Output:5.28 for 5 coins Output: 16.60 for 4 coins. OutPut: 4.64 for one coin. So the outPut is $1.05, $2.75, $5.28, $16.60, and 4.64. So the answer is that the first answer is correct.<n><n>Output: It is not even that difficult to get 100. If for 60 you get 22 and 38, then for 100 you should simply get 50+50. Input: For each peninsula in a jigsaw puzzle, it has to be divided further into four parts. It takes 60% of time to divide any peninsula into four and it takes 40% of the remaining time to put all pieces together. However, every 60 units of time spent divided in the first way will result in only 120 units of time spent put together. How many days does it take to complete the puzzle using the strategy.<n>Output: The output is that for for dividing the pieces, you should not divide them in two equal parts. But you must divide them in two and two, that is, in twos. That is 60% for dividing it to two and 40% from dividing it by half. But note that it takes six fourth in an hour. So if it takes you the whole hour divide it in half which means you divide 60 in 2 = 30 minutes and divide 6

Choices:  A: furniture store B: fishing camp C: hardware store D: sporting goods store E: engine<n>Output:		Since fishing requires the fisherman to cast their line and reel it in, this rod would be best categorized as a sporting good to a fisherman.  This makes sense because hardware stores sell tools.  Engine stores sell cars.  Hardware stores were historically run by a blacksmith and hardware can be used to fix hardware. Therefore, a hardware store is run by a blacksmither (a crafter of tools). But furniture, gym equipment, and camping equipment are typically sold at home goods stores. Sporting goods is the only category to fit this criteria. Thus, sporting goods is the correct answer.<n><n>Input: A student walks to the library, the lab, and the dining hall in 1, 5, and 15 minutes respectively.

The hardware store would not be able to sell a "sporting good," rather it sells tools.  While the engine may be able to fix the rod, it would not be a hardware store (tools, not motor vehicles). The furniture store and hardware store are not appropriate since they sell other goods than that the fishing rod.

When playing the computer is controlled by a program. Programs are usually written in programming languages based on the algorithmic language. The algorithmic language that is spoken by the programmer is Lingo. It consists of two types of words: A “regular” word and an “idiomatic” word. The regular word corresponds to a value in the algorithmic language and can be compared with “operators”. The first two idiomatic words were “and” and “or” which were later on extended to other functions.<n><n>Programs are written by “programmers.” When a programmer writes a program he specifies how the program shall evaluate. The programmer specifies “what the program does” in a list containing the “actions” of the program. When a program is finished it usually contains a total of 100 to 500 actions. The programming language has been extended with programming functions in order to make the programming easy for the programmers.<n><n>The idiomatic word can be a function. Some of the functions that can be used are:  and, or, for, not, and while.<n><n>These functions can work in combination. That means when using for example and, not, the not part, or the for part may be changed such that “or” is added to

Choices:  A: atom B: anything C: air D: feet E: hands<n>Output:		There can be many atoms in the same space, but there can only be one atom per space, therefore only one atom per molecule. So you can have something with many atoms but only one molecule.<n>So the final ans is D: hands<n><n>Input:A is the square root of -1. What is A squared?<n>Output: A squared can be thought of as "the square root squared." This is impossible to express, at least in conventional algebra and arithmetic, because the square root is always negative (recall that the square root of 4 is -2). Hence, "a squared" is undefined in those terms. But consider the complex plane. If A is a complex number, then A^2 is a complex number as well (it can be thought of as A raised to the 2nd order or power). The complex plane is the plane of numbers where i = sqrt(-1), so a complex number with real part A and imaginary part B is of the form a + bi where a and b are real and A = ai and B = bi.<n>The real part of the square of A is A^2, which is (ai)^2 = ai^2 + bi^2, = ai^2 + b^2 + 2 ai bi. The imaginary part of the square of a complex number is bi^2. So a^2 = (ai)^2 = [ai x bi]^2 = a^2 + b^^2 =a^2 + b^x b^2.<n>Now b^2 = -b^x, because b^x must have the same real part as b, and the same real part as -1.<n>[ai x bi]^x = ai^2 + (bi)^2<n>[ai x bi ]^x = ai^x x (bi)^x.<n>Therefore, A^2 = a^x x (bi^x)^y, where a^x is written a/sqrt(x) and (bi)^x is written b/(sqrt(x)).<n><n><n>To find out the final answer:<n><n>In the above line a^x is written as a/sqrt(x). So the real part of a is sqrt(x) [a^x]. Similarly bi^x is written as b/sqrt(x). Therefore the real part of the final answer is (sqrt(x)[a

Output: A) B) C) D) E) F) G)<n><n>Input:  <n>Sometimes you see a number and are asked, "Is this a prime number?", and sometimes you see a number and you are asked "is this a composite number?".  A quick way to figure out if a number "a" is prime or composite is to write "a" in its factor form (you might divide "a" by its factors to get those numbers, but that's not necessary): if any of those numbers from a is prime then a is also prime; and if any of those numbers are composite, then a is also composite.  For composite numbers, there is a rule of thumb that if "a" is the smallest prime number that divides "a", then "a" is a composite number.  Prime number is the opposite extreme: if any number except "a" divides "a", "a" is a prime number.  In a composite there are factors besides 1 and the number itself that multiply to give the number (e.g. 21, with factors 3 and 7, and itself); in a prime there are only factors 1 and the number (e. g 23 has factors only 1 and 23).<n><n>Input: 21 as number to check<n>Output::  B Composite Number<n><n>Input:24 as number to check<n>Input:242 as number to check<n><n>Output: A Prime Number<n><n>Input: 51 as number to check - 51 is odd number since 51/2 is 25.5<n>Output::  A Prime Number<n><n>Answer: Prime = 1<n><n>Composite = any numbers that are not 1.<n><n>So when you're asked "prime" or "composite" what are you really thinking about is, Is it a perfect number (1), is it a Mersenne prime (0), or is it Fermat prim (1), or is it Fibonacci (0)?<n><n>We also have things like Goldbach's Conjecture that tells us that any number > 2 (and of an odd parity) has a Goldbach divisor.<n><n>

Therefore, it will not show a reflection.  Carved wood, while it may have fine line work that would show a reflection,  it will not be able to show the entire surface area in one piece. Thus the answer for Burned or Carved is D.  However, Composted or Nailed wood would show a reflection as it is not burned or carved.  Since it is not burned, it will not leave fine line work that will hinder reflection. And it not carved, a reflection will be able be seen as the entire surface area will not be disturbed.

How many pancake can Alice make everyday if she only wants to make no more than 95 pancakes?<n>Output: Alice needs at least 80 and at most 95 pancake orders in a day of work.  Because we are doing this problem in a computer programming environment, we are not dealing with real pancakes here.  So, instead we are dealing with positive whole numbers.<n>Hence, all integers between 80 and 95 can be expressed as a sum of integer multiples of 400 and 50 using different combinations of multiplies of 50 and multiples of 4.<n>Therefore, if 400  mod 80=<<<400 mod 80=0>>0, then Alice can at least make that order.  However, she can only make a total of 95 pancakess in a given day if 4

One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Output: For the nuts Adam paid 3 * $12 = $<<3*12=36>>36.<n>And for dried fruits Adam paid 2.5 * $8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20.<n>So in total for his purchases Adam paid $36 + $20 = $<<36+20=56>>56.<n>So the final answer is 56<n><n>Input: Johns goes to the gym 3 times a week.  He spends 1 hour each day lifting weight. Additionally, he also spends a third of his weightlifting time warming up and doing cardio each day.  How many hours does he spend at the gym a week?<n>Output: He spends 60/3=<<60/3=20>>20 minutes warming up<n>So he spends 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes at the gym per day<n>That means he spends 80*3=<<80*3=240>>240 minutes at the gym<n>So he spends 240/60=<<240/60=4>>4 hours at the gym a week<n>So the final answer is 4<n><n>Input:What is the opposite of foolhardy? Choices:  A: thoughtful B: discreet C: calculated D: cautious E: careful<n>Output:		The opposite of foolhardy is thoughtful.<n>So the final output is A<n>I think there is an error in the question. Shouldn't it be "calculated" not "calculatedly"? I mean a better explanation is given above but I don't think that it is an opposite of an adjective foolhardy.<n><n>##### I think the input here is bad. I think the first statement has a missing phrase? I can't think of what could come next. But here is what I can think of. Couldn't it be something like:<n><n>Input:Mary has a 70% chance of winning the competition and has a 28% chance of finishing first in the prelims. What is Mary's probability of winning the competition? Choices: A: <<70/70=0>>0 percent B: <<70/67=4.8%>>4.8 percent C: <<70/53=13.2%>>13.2 percent D: <<70/37=19.2%>>19.2 percent E: <<70/25=28%>>28%<n><n>Output: I think the final answer should be C<n><n>I think the question is a little confusing.  I know D can be eliminated, but E is confusing too because it contradicts both the first and second premises right?  So I think what the question is trying to say is that the probability of finishing first in the competition is 0.13 and 0.28 respectively so the final answer would actually be D in this case because the 0.28 could be the result of her finishing first in the competition or it could not.<n><n><n>Input: Mary has 14 days of vacation and she wants to visit 9 countries. For each country we can budget at least 2 days and at most 5 days. Each flight costs $1,000. How many days can we afford? Choices: <<1>>1 A: A: We spend 9/11 = <<9/11= 0.81818182>> 0.81 days for each country B: B: We spend 9 * 1 =<<9*1= 9>> 9 days for each country.<n>Output: We spend

The dog will lose a maximum of 3/2 health or 1.5 health per day. If that day the temperature is 10*C or lower, the dog will be ok. If that day is above 10*C then no amount of health will make the dog ok.  If the temperature will be above 10*0, then the dog will lose 3/2+1=1.5 health that day OR if the temperature will be below 10*0 then the dog will lose an average of 1.5 health that week OR the dog will lose just that 1.5 health.  So if that day the temperature is above 10 the dog loses 1.5 health and if that day is below 10 the dog will lose no health.  We will assume that temperature will always increase and that there will not be days where the temperature will suddenly go away. So for the question:  How many days did dog stay outside when it is 5*C?  There are 3 possibilities  (0, 1 or 2 or more)<n>The answer to this question is 2<n><n>Input: This is the answer to the last problem! How many days did the animal stay outside when it is -1*C?  The answer is 0!  <n><n>If we subtract we get 1.5 - 0 = 1.5 Health is subtracted.  <n>If we add we get 0 + 1.5 = 1.5  Health is added.  <n><n>This means that we can subtract -1.5 from any other numbers to get the health that we want.  You probably realize that at least 8*C is too hot and 0*C is too cold.  (At least as long as we assume that the temperature is increasing)  <n>Therefore we need to subtract -1.5.  (We'll let 2 days represent 1*C)<n>If the temperature is 9*C

He was tasked with the daunting task of creating a program so powerful that it could even beat the human brain in chess for the next year. The employee named his program "Chessy" and created a team, each of which with different specialty in chess (ie: computer vision, AI, etc). Every member of the Chessy team contributed at different times in the day.  How many days did they work on Chessy?<n>Output: They worked on Chessy for 6 days. How? Well...  You can easily find a solution to this puzzle by diving into how long each of the members works everyday.  (Computer Vision: 9 hours per day, AI: 7 hours, etc.)  Now that we know that member A works 9 hours per day on average, he works for 198/9=61 days.  (rounded to the next integer)<n>Now that we have a solution, to make it complete we must find the total days worked.  It's simply addition: 61/9, 151/9, etc.  Which can be written as: 150/9, which reduces to 16/9, which is 1/3 or 1 day.<n><n>So the final answer for this is 61 + 1 = 62 (which is a rounded number)<n><n>Input: A dog has $100 in cash, and the owner wishes for the dog to get a dog bone when he spends $75 or more.

Choices:  A: towed B: accidents C: driving D: getting tired E: ticket<n>Output:		If you get a ticket your money does not stop going.  They take money from you every single day. If you did not move your car during the required amount of time it is likely that you would get a ticket.  Additionally, If you park your car in the same place for too long the car gets hot and also will begin to smell, and it is not safe.  To park you car legally you either can move it every 3 to 7 days depending on where you live or you can pay to park your car.  Parking costs typically range from $0.75-15 an hour and parking for 1 day typically costs about $20-30.  Paying for parking or getting a ticket is about parking legally, but also it will get your car towed.  If your car is towed you will be charged more money.  You will be charged a towing fee, and you will have to pay to get your car un-towened.  Additionally, towing a car will also cost more to you at about $10,000.  You can avoid all of these cost by moving your car.  The choice that works best for you depends on your specific situation.<n>So the final decision should be that park your car legally because it will avoid you from the ticket<n>

However, many teenagers may feel self-conscious over grooming habits that are not deemed socially normal. Teenage self-consciousness over grooming may lead to selfishness and mistakes during your first job and throughout the rest of your life. These mistakes can be as large as not keeping a workplace clean on a large scale or a minor offense of using an over-the-counter deodorant that the boss may deem unnecessary and unacceptable. Finally, if a teen is self-conscious over their grooming habits, they begin to feel dissatisfaction with not being accepted as they are.<n>This is because, at a younger age, people are much more likely to make mistakes, because they are not quite as sharp and knowledgeable as people that are older, just because they are young, and a teen is in a way young, but not as a literal human, young as they are much more in tune with the outside world around them and they see the world for what it is and the truth of the matter is not very pretty at all, not that there is an underlying issue, it is because of ignorance and prejudice, like always being bullied and called names.

Choices:  A: appreciation of nature B: become educated C: excitement D: increased knowledge E: see things differently<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>### Rationale: The correct options are: A, E<n><n>### Note: The options should not include a period.<n><n>### Input <n><n>Input: One way to think about how our world has changed is to explore the differences between two periods (e.g. 1945 and 2015, the 1990s and the present, and the 1960s and the present).<n>Rationales:<n>To do so, one can  use the calendar as a "time machine" to see the changes. <n><n>In that way, we can see that science has significantly changed the way we live.  As an example, a 1945 calendar shows one day is dedicated to a "work" holiday and another to a "fun" holiday, with many days allotted for religious services, <n>But in a 2015 calendar it shows only two of those "holidays" are still celebrated.<n>A 1945 family would spend much of the day at home and do not have the luxury to go out for dinner <n>In a 2019 calendar, one finds that it almost impossible to meet friends in person, unless you eat in restaurants.<n><n>### Output:The correct answer is A.<n><n>### Rationales: The answer does not include a period. The answer is "appreciation of nature".<n><n>### Input<n>Input: How many weeks are in a year? Choices: A: 52 B: 52<n><n>Rationales: To answer this question, we can use the calendar as a “<n>time machine” to see the past.<n><n>According to the traditional calendar, we can see that every 7 days, there is the “start of the week” and every 7 days the “end of the week”, as well<n>as every 181 years or 129000 weeks there is the start of a new century. <n>In addition, according to the traditional Chinese calendar, there is a special day called "Gengzi" day every 78 years, as well as every 10 years a day 10 named and every 60 years, a 20 -day period is also named by a special name.

Choices:  A: michigan B: map C: american city D: rest stops E: country<n><n>### Response:		D<n><n>### Instructions:This task asks you to use logic to solve multiple choice questions.<n><n>### Task input:A man has to get home from work. He rides a bus that takes him halfway to his work then walking the rest of the way. However, he walks faster than the bus takes him home. If he has enough time, he also walks to work, even though it's further than the bus ride home. How many minutes does he get home?<n><n>### Answer:30 or 60<n><n>### Explain:The bus ride is exactly half the distance to work in 40 minutes if he takes it to the end of the road. The first half of the bus ride is 20 minutes to the end of the bus journey home. It can take someone walking to get there, so they walk the halfway home in the first half their bus journey. So the amount of the bus journey to the same bus stop they got off the bus at. So the distance of 20 minutes back plus 20 minutes to get to where he got off at is 40 minutes. So the answer is either 20 or 40 minutes if they get home in the halfway to the stop.<n><n>#### 60<n><n><n><n>### Input :A person wants to get from the United States to the country of Jamaica, which is further west.

He spends 1 hour each day lifting weight. Additionally, he also spends a third of his weightlifting time warming up and doing cardio each day.  How many hours does he spend at the gym a week?<n>Rationales: He spends 60/3=<<60/3=20>>20 minutes warming up<n>So he spends 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes at the gym per day<n>That means he spends 80*3=<<80*3=240>>240 minutes at the gym<n>So he spends 240/60=<<240/60=4>>4 hours at the gym a week<n>#### 4<n>Answer: 4<n><n>### Input:What is love when everyone keeps feeling it? Choices:  A: contagious B: wrong C: last forever D: painful E: blind<n><n>### Response:		<n>What is love when everyone has a different experience of feeling it?<n><n>#### 2<n>Rationales:  Love could be contagious, but feelings change because feelings come from inside oneself. Sometimes these feelings are pleasant ones, and sometimes they are unpleasant ones as in the case of painful feelings. As such, love would be contagious since it is an experience, but love could not be love without the person having experienced it.<n><n>### Input1:  The student's professor was talking in their math class about the speed of light. He said that if light moves at a certain speed which is 300,000 km/sec, then what is the distance from Earth to the Sun?<n><n>### Response1:<n>3 times 10^3 light years.<n><n>### Rationale:<n>#### 15<n>Answer: Light takes 8 minutes to reach Earth, so the distance from Earth to Sun is roughly 8 * 60 * 60 *10***-3 miles = 3 million miles<n>The closest planet to the sun is Mercury since it is only 4 to 7.5 times 10^9 kilometers away. So:<n>3 million/4 = <<3 million/4= 750,000>>750,0<n>000 ≈ 7.5 times ten to the 9 km<n>1<n><n>### Input2:  We can be happy. In fact, we're happier now than we were a year ago. Choices:  A) yes B) no<n><n>### D:<n>We now understand our happiness as a social phenomenon, rather than as a measure of our own contentment.<n><n>### I:<n>Yes! We were happier. We are happier! :) :) :)<n><n>#### 1<n>Rationales: Happiness is a perception of contentment. Some people think that the key to happiness is to achieve a goal. However, many people do not pursue goals and thus do just as well as if they had pursued their goals. As such, happiness is more a product of one's state of mind than anything else.<n>

The toy box is also unlikely because you would see it when the kids bring out their toys.  Park could be a good answer, but that is unlikely too. It's always a mess in the playroom, so they would most likely be there. (A lot of times, you don't know which one they are.

A is the most likely place to meet a ferret<n><n>### Response Rationale: Let us review the options for the correct answer, there are five possible choices.  The five places we could find a ferret are (A) The Trouser Leg, (B) The Sick Bay, (C) Own Home, (D) The Petting Zoo, (E) Mothers Hair.  Of these, the first (A) has (attention) in it, and (Mother's Hair) does not.  So it can safely be eliminated.  Next we can eliminate (E) because of (attention).  Next (D) because of (Mother) in it.  Now (B) can be eliminated since (attention) is not contained in it's name.  Of what is left, we know (A, C) are both correct.

It is not worn on the top of your head as shown in the textbook definition.<n><n>### Input<n>The helm is not somthing that you wear on your head but rather is used to control the steering mechanism on a large sailing ship at sea. How much does it cost you to get there?<n><n>### Response<n><n>This response will require a step by step approach since you are asked how much a helm cost.<n>We know that the helms are for ships that have rigging/riggs and sail a sea at sea. Let start by finding out an approximate price range and then from there find the precise price for the helm.<n>Let use the internet to answer this question, we assume that the internet is correct and that the information is not skewed.<n><n>So we assume the cost of the helm to be between 10-$600( this is just a range, not an exact price range)<n>So let us find a specific price range for a specific helm<n>There are a few companies that make helms. Now the question would be what one of these companies/manufacturer’s is the cheaper one.<n><n>Let's us pretend that there are two companies that make helms, the helm company and the second helm company. The Helm manufacturer are the cheaper ones compared to the second helm.<n><n>But lets pretend that the price range is $600-$50 and the helm is the helm manufacture which means its the cheaper one. The reason for using the helm as an example is that it has better specifications than the second helm company and second hand helms are usually priced at 5% of the initial price so if I did 10% of the first helm price which would be $5 a helm I would have $99/4=<<99/4=$25.00>>25.00 which is exactly 1/2 of the 2 helm companies prices<n><n>So for 2 helm i would spend 50+80=$<<50+80=>>130.00<n>But for the helm company I would spend 25.00 + 50=<<

(2) Rita is going to buy some pencil to write down things in this week.<n>### Student Rationale<n>Even though (1) states that Rita might have more than 5 hours left to practice the clarinet, the sentence itself lacks information to justify that she actually has more than 5 hrs to spend on clarinet practice. We know she has some practice time but do not know how much she actually has. (2) is more precise about what Rita is going to do and so is more informative.<n><n>### Student Answer<n>Statement (2) is preferred as it explains more clearly that Rita is prepared to spend the week making notes for her research.

And as a student, I can’t decide if I should spend the money first for an essay or buy food first. So I am very indecisiveness now but not sadness.<n><n>### Input What’s the ratio of 1.250 and 12/5 <n><n>### Demstration:<n>Let 1.25 = x<n>Then 12/5 = <12/5=2>>2<n>So the ratio of 12/5 and 1.25 is <<12/5=0.2=2>>2<n>#### 2<n>Answer: 2<n><n>### Demostration:<n>Rates are used to make comparisons, calculate change, compare, and measure differences. I want students to be able to choose a rate in order to make the comparison and understand the concept. The purpose of the lesson is to help us know how to choose rates and why it is important. By making students to work on finding out the rates, it will help our students to build a solid foundation for understanding the concept of rate as well as to give more examples. This strategy was helpful to my students because they were able to show their problem-solving ability which is the goal of this lesson.<n>

How does she know she is dying? Well, for example, Janet can feel change in herself. She knows because she can feel change taking place. Change takes place when things alter. She feels like her body is dying or getting warmer or getting colder. She feels like she is dying because her body is being torn apart, she feels different about herself and her body is losing it's shape. She feels cold and has no energy and no motivation. She had stopped breathing and felt like she had no oxygen, and her body was deteriorating. She knew she was dying because she stopped responding to anything. I think that's all she can feel.

You started with 1 box of macaornoi.  12 dishes from 1 box of macornio means:  <<12 dishes from one box of macarni=0>>0 dishes left from 1 box of makeanio.  So since you need to make 12 dishes of 22 that means:  <<1/2 =0.5>>0.5 to be a multiple of 2 since 22 is dividable by 2, since the answer will be a multiple of 5 since 22 is a multiple of 5<n><n>#### 0.5<n>Answer: 0.5<n>

The main problem I have with this question is that it doesn't make it apparent for the reader/user. I don't want to just pick something that other users randomly picked. I would like to be able to use my own interpretation but I don't think this system allows you to be truly creative with your answers. Just picking a random answer (of which I have done and seen other users do as well) is kind of frustrating. I have seen plenty of cases on here where if you put in the same answer as another user, it shows up as 5 (accepted) regardless if you are correct or not. So I think it would be best if you allowed me to choose 1 correct answer from within the group. I may choose different answers depending on the question since different poetry may have different themes, moods, and meanings.<n><n>### Group 1:<n><n>### Group:<n>

One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?<n>Rationales: For the nuts Adam paid 3 * $12 = $<<3*12=36>>36.<n>And for dried fruits Adam paid 2.5 * $8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20.<n>So in total for his purchases Adam paid $36 + $20 = $<<36+20=56>>56.<n>#### 56<n>Answer: 56<n><n>Input: Johns goes to the gym 3 times a week.  He spends 1 hour each day lifting weight. Additionally, he also spends a third of his weightlifting time warming up and doing cardio each day.  How many hours does he spend at the gym a week?<n>Rationales: He spends 60/3=<<60/3=20>>20 minutes warming up<n>So he spends 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes at the gym per day<n>That means he spends 80*3=<<80*3=240>>240 minutes at the gym<n>So he spends 240/60=<<240/60=4>>4 hours at the gym a week<n>#### 4<n>Answer: 4<n><n>### Input:The man was playfully wrestling with a woman he was enamored with, what was the physiological result? Choices:  A: competition B: blood C: wins D: medals E: erections<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>>I believe the correct answer is A. The two choices that are most relevant to a physiological response are B and E. B because if he had “blood” in his eyes, then it might mean the man was angry and it wouldn’t be so fun as to be wrestling lightly with her. E because it doesn’t say he has an erection. Also in this situation the answer is either A or B because neither have an erection at the moment.<n><n>### Input : The woman was about to give a speech to a sold-out crowd of 5,350 audience members. After a few minutes from the start of her speech, she was 1,800 more  audience members. How many was she speaking to at the start of the speech?<n><n>### Response :<n><n>> I believe the correct answer is D. First is if it was D the number would have decreased with the time she spent speaking. Second is if it was B then her speech will decrease in length throughout the time her speech takes place.<n><n><n>### Input The two bags of nuts were 4 and 5 kilograms, respectively.<n><n>### Response<n><n>> The correct answer is D. If you have A and B, then the two bags must weigh different amounts. I would assume that the two bags each have enough nuts to make a full kilogram. <n><n>### Instructions:<n><n>### Input<n><n>> If nuts were 88 pounds in total, what is the weight of 1 of the bags?<n><n>### Reponse<n><n>> If you put all the nuts and their weights together, you would add them up together. The answer is F. That way you can have the same weight for each one.<n><n><n><n>----<n>###### Hints<n><n>### A: 1,288 pounds<n><n>### B: 1,388 pounds<n><n>---<n><n>### ANSWERS EXPLANATIONS<n><n>### A<n><n>A.  A.

Excautions should also never take place at buildings unless the excavation is in a basement or another enclosed space in the building.<n><n>Excautions should never take pace in a building, cemetary or construction site at all and should take place in a field.<n><n>#### <n>Answer: E<n><n>### Input<n>> In this math problem, there were two lines drawn from point "A" down to negative 3 and to 1 at a slope of 3/2. The problem asked about what happened to the y-coordinate of point "a" after the given transformation is made. The choices were a) y increases by -0.5 b) y increases by 0.5 c) y stays the same d) y decreases by 0.5 e) y decreases by -0,5. The right answer was e) (y decreases by -0.5). The rationales of why the answer was "e" was that the y values were only ever increasing or decreasing by an even value, meaning it would've been odd number. The point "A" would always have a value of -3 if it stayed the same or increased or decreased by an even number, so the only other even number would be 0, and the y value for the point "A" would change to a negative by 0.5. The rationales for why the answer was "d" (which should be 0.5 not -0.5 if y increased by 1, was that the point "A" also has to stay within the y axis values. If the y axis goes from -9 to 8, then if A changed y values from -3 to -2, then the original point A would have to change y values from 3 to 2. It is not possible to go down to a negative -0.5, so it would have to be a positive 0.5<n><n>### Response<n>-I don't really understand<n><n>### Input : An archaeologist has just excavated an artefact, which they believe to be from the Bronze Age.

Choices:  A: pets B: fills the pond C: attempt to fly D: school together E: breath in water<n><n>### Response:		C<n><n>### Response to the Demonstration:How do you know?<n>I got this from the answer choices and by thinking logically. A and B are false: they're not descriptors of fishes, and pets in particular can't breathe underwater. C is also false, as fishes don't have the ability to fly, or soar through air, and they don't usually do that collectively.  Schooling is true if the fish is in a group of the same species in a single location, and the definition states they can be together. It fits best into the answer choice.<n><n>### Explanation<n><n>The definition stated "a group of fish in a single location".<n><n>### Your Input:<n>A: pets B: ponds C: fly together D: school<n><n>### Your Responses:<n><n>Your response is incorrect in all ways; however, this is mainly due to the fact your response was formatted poorly. <n>Your answer should have been:<br><n>They don't get any grades or sit at a desk. In place of your 'descriptors of fishes', think specifically about the answer choices as descriptors of fishes. As stated above, schools are only formed when various fishes within the exact same species congregate at a single location. <br><n>They don’t breathe in water.  This is simply not the case, as all fish live in water, it seems logical that they must breathe in water, does it not?<br><n>This is also not a descriptor of fishes, again, because it is not specific enough.  So I recommend to answer this question by thinking carefully about the answer choices and which one best describes a'school'. <n><n>### Source:<n>Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_(biology) (see the second paragraph under "Definitions")<n>

Choices:  A: detroit B: australia C: michigan park D: cafe E: retail store<n><n>### Response:		The first step to decide where to buy some barbecue sauce, is to read what each place represents. Then we can use the information to identify the best place to shop. From the above questions, we know that A is from Detroit. In addition, there is another rule that the place from each letter should contain the same quantity of each letter. C does not have the quantity of place of Michigan as there is no mention of Michigan park in this question. Thus, A is best for barbecue sauces.<n><n>We can also apply another step to solve this question. We can find out the minimum quantity of each letter and we can choose the place that meet the minimum quantity of each place. For example, retail store have the minimum letter of the place.<n><n>Since retail store has the minimum letters, it should be chosen.<n>

Choices:  A: classroom B: toy store C: school D: soccer game E: dinner<n><n>### Response:		<n>In my opinion C is not an interesting place for children as compared to A, B, D and E. This means that for children C is the least  interesting  place whereas C is the last choice to be made from four different choices.This is because that in my opinion children usually love to visit their school because of the fun they are sure to get in school.I cannot see any situation in which children would be in love with school unlike A (the classroom) which children love to visit on a weekly basis for educational purposes.I would also choose option D( the soccer game) because it helps the players to develop the ability to run and walk on an unsteady ground without falling.The option A(classroom) is my second option.<n><n>### Input :  What subject is most likely to be taught at University?  Choices:1. Economics 2. Finance 3. Mathematics 4. Accounting.<n><n>### Solution<n><n>In my opinion choice C (the university) is not the right choice as compared to the other three choices because university is usually where you study after getting the basic education. In other words, university comes right after the secondary school or the high school where you study the basic education. This information is evident from the following diagram.<n><n>The diagram shows that from secondary high school, you proceed onto the university to further your education.<n><n>![](diagram3.jpg)<n><n>As such it is difficult to imagine the scenario in which the university is considered first among the four choices because the university is where you study after having completed your basic education.<n><n>The option C( the university) will be my second choice as compared to choices A (economics) B (Finance), and D (Accounting) because according to our constitution, higher education including universities is one of the key sectors of focus in the Tanzanian economy. Therefore it is my second selection as compared to the other options.<n><n><n>### Input<n>What is the least interesting city?<n><n>### Answer<n>The least interesting city is London as compared to other three cities because  the other most interesting cities to visit for a tourist are places which are associated with beautiful weather like Spain,Italy,Florida among others.

He spent the money because he felt _______.<n>Rationales: <n>#### 1<n>John felt bankruptcy since his testicle became bigger. So he decided to  buy products for it because he wanted to make it smaller. <n>He ____ a lot of money on the products because he really wanted his testicles less bigger. But he ended up with bankruptcy. <n>#### 3<n>John spent too much on buying products for ______. He spent that ______ because he felt ______.<n>Rationales: $Based off of the 3rd example answer I decided to change too because it's a verb. Instead, I went with buying products because that is something that is owned. I changed too much because it does not make sense and it isn't how he really felt. I knew that he felt bankrupt so I used so because I don't know the exact amount that he spent so I am not going to be specific with it, so I put so. For example John spent so much money on products for his testicles bankruptcy hit him.<n>#### 2<n>I ___ a lot of money on products for my testicles... But because I did that I caused my bankruptcy...<n>Rationales: I bought the products because I wanted my testicles to be less big (they got pretty big) and the thought that came to my head that I bought the products I did was too much money.<n>#### 4<n>I _____ a lot of money on testicle products... Because I did that...<n>Rationales  I bought the wrong products because I wanted them to be less big than how they were. I bought lots of lotions and other things for my testicles,  I ____ a lot of cash for those pills.<n>

Choices:  A: exposure B: patience C: study D: cooperation E: thought<n><n>### Response:		<n>#### 3<n>Answer: 3<n><n>### Instructions:<n>A team leader and a team member go to the airport from opposite directions. The leader gets off at two stations earlier from the end of the subway line, and the other one gets off at one station earlier than the leader but after the leader's station. Who catches up with whom first, and how long does it take for the team member to catch up with the team leader?<n><n>### Rationales:<n>So the question asks both the team leader and team member to get off the subway. The team leader gets off 1 station earlier than the team member. Since the question starts with 2 stations before the end of the line, the team leader has to get off at two stations into the line. That means the team member would have to get off at three stations earlier that the leader, so he needs to get off two stops earlier than the leader on the first station after the leader’s stop.<n><n>He catches up with the leader when the leader moves from a red light after getting off the subway. Once the leader moves from a light, the team member will have to use a train to catch up with him. Since it took the team member two stops between his stop and the team leaders, two stops for the train, and then another two stops to catch up, total it takes six stops for the team member to get to the same stop on the line as the team leader. Since the team leader stopped on the second station when it was a red light, the 6 stops to the team member’s is 6-2 = <<6-2=4>>4 stops more to the team member than to the team leader.<n><n>#### 4<n>#### 3<n>#### 4<n><n>####4 4 and 4 3 are the correct answers.<n><n>### Input ChoicesA: Laymen C: Specialists<n><n>#### Answer:<n>4 B<n><n>### Input B:Laymen<n><n>### Answer:C<n><n>#### 4 and 3<n>

Choices:  A: hair salon B: hair of woman C: barber shop D: pincushion E: woman's hair<n><n>### Response:		I think the answer is E, which is woman's hair. A human hair should weigh about a gram.<n><n>### Rationale: You might think, at first, that the best answer is B. This might seem true for many people, since a person typically cuts their hair at a barber shop. However, it should be clear to you now that women typically also go to the hair salon, and do not necessarily visit only the barber shop. Also, women may prefer to cut their own hair, or may have cut it themselves before visiting the hair salon. Lastly, a person may cut their hair without visiting a professional hair salon.<n><n>#### Hair is composed primarily of protein.  This is because hair is made primarily of a protein called keratin. Keratin is the main part of a hair shaft, which is the part of a hair that protrudes from the root. Some hairs have keratin in both the shaft and the root, while others have keratin in the shaft and not the base. The protein fibers that make up a typical hair are much lighter than the water that it normally holds. However, these proteins are less dense than oils, which is why dry, coated hair can be weighed.<n>In general, hair has the lowest density of material among the organic elements of the human body. The densities of organic tissue in the human body (in units of dkg/cm³) are:<n><n>In terms of mass, the average human hair has a mass of 2.2mg, and the hair on the head has a mass of 65 mg. The density of hair is roughly 1 mg/cm³, but these estimates are based on the human body, and thus cannot be used to compare the density of different hair samples.<n><n>#### The hair's weight varies according to factors such as climate. It depends on how often a person cuts his/her hair and the degree of stress.<n><n>#### When a person cuts their hair, they will notice that a significant amount of hair is shed. They may also notice that the hair on their head appears to have a lower density than other types of hair. The density of a human scalp is about 2.3 mg/cm³. Since human scalp hair tends to have a very low density, the density of other hairs tends to

Choices:  A: new york B: concert C: tv studio D: gig E: recording studio<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>#### A<n><n>### rationales:<n>  We know that microphones are very delicate instruments, and therefore they are covered with many layers of protection to protect it from the impact of any outside force or sudden movements. That’s why most microphone booms are found at any live events, especially any stage performances or television studio events. The microphone boom is used to prevent the microphone from hitting any other objects near it. <n><n>#### B<n><n>### rationaleses: <n>  When you attend concerts, it is the performers who are singing and dancing on stage that catch your attention as the best-looking, and sometimes best-performing, part of the event. However, there is another critical aspect of a concert; a microphone boom. The performance won't be well recorded if the performers are moving around and sometimes not in the best position. If the microphone is being shaky, that will also affect the audio quality. Therefore, the microphone is mounted on the stage where it can track all movements of the performers. <n><n>#### C<n><n>### rationalesis:<n>  Microphone booms are often built into your entertainment centers and can be seen as large antennas on the top of your devices. You can also find them on live television studio broadcasts as well as on concert stages. The microphone booms on your TV help to track the movement of the performers on stage for the camera's best view. <n><n>#### D<n><n>### rationalisis:<n>The microphone boom may seem like a simple device but it plays a critical roll of keeping the audio clear, and helping maintain the audio level for the performer to deliver the vocals to the audience. Live events in general use microphone booms whether they are at a stadium for a sports event or in an auditorium for a stage performance..<n><n>#### E<n><n>### rationalis:<n>The microphone in a recording studio has to be able to move easily to capture all the tones from the vocalist as well as the bass and drums. When the microphone has to be at a different height or angle over a performance, the microphone needs to be able to move, hence the microphone boom.<n><n>### Output:<n><n>| Output Name       |  Output Type |  <n>| :-----------------:  | :----------  :  |

Damage is harm that a fire causes. We see a fire burning a wooden house. If a person starts a fire at a wooden house and then damages the house to a point where he or she might have to be taken to jail, then the damage is the word that best explains what has happened. <n><n>B: The word that best explains where the person will be taken when he or she is hurt as a result of the fire is going to jail. Going to jail is the most likely sentence for most serious fire damage. The fire burning down a house is enough damage to land the offender in jail. Hence, going to jail is the best word to explain what is likely to happen.<n><n>C: A fire could injure someone or even kill the person. However, the injury that results from a fire burns. As such, the only burns that might result from a fire are the burns.  If there are burns, then the person is expected to visit a doctor to ensure he or she is medically fit before returning to school. As such, the word best explains what happens to someone who is hurt in a fire. Hence, burns is a fitting word to use in this case.<n><n>D: The word best explains what happens when you cause harm to someone or to their property. The harm is destruction. As such, the harm to the home after a fire caused by setting a house could result in the offender getting sent to jail. However, in such a case, the fire damage would lead to the destruction of the house due to the fire. <n><n>E: Destruction causes harm. Harm happens with fire. We see that a fire causes harm to the people whose houses are destroyed. So, a fire could cause

It is good to contact relatives so they can be there for you when you and your family is in need.<n>* In D, self medication or just doing what you want won't give you a solution, or give a better result to be honest. The patient needs to have their wound tended to properly so it will not deterriere.

Choices:  A: fullness B: underwear C: bad breath D: better day E: dirty dishes<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is E<n><n>### Justification: Breakfast at home involves eating with a large family which leads to piles of dirty dishes that need to be wash by someone.  When I go grocery shopping, I try to buy less in the morning, lunch and breakfast food which can be reheated, but dinner needs to be cooked completely, and this tends to create the worst dirty dish piles, but it's not as bad as having a bunch of kids under age 10.  I also wash dishes after cooking every meal, while I don't do that I work as much because it's hard to keep up with grocery shopping for our family with two kids and two of us working, but it is always important to me that I cook every meal with love for them.  I don't really care about what breakfast will taste like because my stomach will make it's own judgment unless I eat too many of specific foods, but one of the kids will always have something bad to say about breakfast, and this will lead to the entire breakfast being scrapped so we can start over so we all have a better day while having better breath (though eating toxic foods in the morning would be a turn-off from better breath), which in the kitchen would create a pile of dirty dishes.<n><n>### Input/Response: Which of the following is NOT a step in making a list? Choices: A: writing every product you need in a notebook B: finding the products in the store C: finding the store D: counting the products required by the list<n><n>### Response/Justification: The correct answer is D<n><n>### Justifications: I don't think that the question is referring to a list that we make specifically for shopping or errands, but instead if I make a list to buy for school and I can't get 2 of something because the store closes at night so I have to buy 2 more days from now.  I do know that I can make the list in the notebook and it will last until school closes, but if that's the case the 2 list item shouldn't be in the list, but instead in a different part of the notebook that I plan to use for something else.<n><n>### Task 2<n>You are going

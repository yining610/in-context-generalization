The elements of the list are:\n\na string representation of one of the following numbers (integers) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 or 9\n      any positive number < 10 that you want to sum and convert to  a string\n      a negative number (i.e. negative 10) < 0\n      a string that you want to convert to a number\n\nThe list can have all sorts of different elements, such as negative 100 and string representations of one of the numbers above.\n  When the list contains a numerical element, you must use a double to convert the elements. \n  When the list does not contain any numerical elements, you must convert the list to a string.\n  You need to determine which type of data is contained within the list and convert it to the proper type of data, before you do the math and then convert the answer to a string.\n\n```\n\n### Solution\nFirst I will go with the basic approach. I defined an array with size 4, it contains variables\n```\nvar s =[\u201c9\u201d, \u201c-10\u201d,\u201d1\u201d, \u201c10\u201d ]\n```\nNext I will iterate with `for` loop and check with the below condition whether it is a string or integer. if it is a string, return the value of a and b. if else part is to convert the value to string.\n\nNext I will iterate if it is string in my array. here I take the string values and convert them into `valueOf`. and do the sum.\n```\nif(s[i] == null){\n\tfor(j=0; j<s.length; j++){\n\t sString += s[i] +'';\n\t }\n} else {\n\tsString += s[i].valueOf();\n}\n```\n\n##", "answer": "D: relaxation"}

When they were having breakfast at a local coffeehouse, he was doing what he always does when he has breakfast: playing a game with his pencil that involved connecting a set of dots. Ryan and his friends were sitting at a table and there were five other tables in the coffeehouse. All but two of the five other tables in the house did not have people at them other than the employees serving coffee and food to people who were actually seated at the tables and playing with their pencils. Ryan connected every dot in his game without making an error, while not drawing an iota of attention to himself, other than when other people started to make eye contact with him, Ryan quickly broke into another part of his pencil game. Of the five other tables in that part of the coffeehouse, one had a man and a woman seated there, with their pencils and games.  One had a man, who was playing his Pencil Dot Game but was making plenty of mistakes.  Two more tables had men sitting at them, looking for the occasional glance at a woman who was seated at the table.  Those tables did not have games going. One table had nothing other than coffee and food items. At that point, the game started to get interesting, since it is the only table in the coffeeshop that had not seen a pencil game before.  The people at the table were eating and talking and the wife was texting on her cell phone, making it obvious that the husband of the woman on the cell was inattentive at best and not in the same room with her even though she was right in his seat at the side of the table.

But the basic way of connecting to the Internet from one computer to another is through the Internet service provider (provider name) using computer packets.\nA network connection is a two-way connection between two or more computers. The computers must be turned on and connected via either a wired or wireless connection in order to share information. A computer can have multiple network connections.\nWhen you need to send a large amount of data from one computer to another, you transfer a file by using what is known as a file transfer protocol. A typical home connection type is a file transfer protocol (FTP), which uses what is know as a server to transfer your data files or files from other computers.\nA computer network can be composed of two or more computers that can communicate with each other either in real time or at predetermined times. A network transfer, also called a file transfer, is a mechanism for transferring data from a source computer to an end computer, or from one computer to some other computer on the same network.\nComputer networks were used long before the Internet, where it was possible to send or transfer data between one client (e.g., computer user) and another over what is called a dial-in connection. In this case, dial-in (i.e. telephone) is a connection where you have a dial-up Internet service. The user accesses the Internet through their dial-up phone connection and their Internet Service Provider (ISP).\nComputer networks are now capable of transmitting data over long distances; however, with the advent of the Internet, computer networks as we know them today are now being used to transmit data between computers over short distances.\nIn the most basic sense, a computer network is a group of more than one computer that can communicate with each of the other computers in the group. This can be done over a telephone connection", "answer": "D: computer network"}

Each house that is built will have approximately 500 square feet of land. The city plans to sell the land to the developer under a  \u201cscenic easement\u201d  that will require that each lot be restricted to one house only.  The lot will be sold for $100 and will cost $25,000 to install street lights, pave and widen the two access roads, dig a nearby small pond and stream, and put up fences.  A family needs a house and buys the land.  In addition to the sale price, the lot has a $500 deed maintenance fee.  The family pays $16,275 for the property.  In return for the city\u2019s improvements, the developer must pay the city a sum of money that is equal to the improvement costs plus twice the lot sale price. (Since two people each own a lot and each lot costs $100, the city receives $100 from each buyer for a total of $200.  The cost of improvements are $25,025 so $100 was the city's  profit of $5,000 x 2 = $10,000.)\n\nOutput: $1\n\nInput: The company paid employees a 3% bonus based on base wages.

The output of the first question is 310 as we use 'input 1' given in the question for calculating the tax.\n\nExplanation:\n\nJennie rented a car  for 11 days; hence, she pays $190 for an entire week or longer, which is $190 + $60 = $250 for 11 days for Rental and $30 for a day. Then we calculate the total tax charged by the company:  $190 + 250 + 30 = 290+30=380.  Hence, total sum due is $380.\n\nAns. Total driving time = total distance of the trip / total time needed to travel 60 miles / hour. total driving time will = 400 / 60 / 2 = 40.\n\nAjn. Total sum due = price * number of days = 500*14 = 7000.\n\nTotal hours = 500/24 = (1/24)500 hours per day 72 in 365 days.\n\nAns: Total sum due = $190/3 + $30/2 = $190+60=$250.\n\nA total sum due = boys/boys + girls = 5/7 + 7/5*3900/ (5*180) = 5300.\n\n\n\n\n# Questions:\n \n\n \n ### Instruction:Answer these question in short sentences\n \n ### Instuction:\n Answer these question in 100+ words\n\n ### Solution:\n\n \n### Instruction:Answer these questions in short sentences.\n### Solution:\n\n## Solutions to Code For India Problems\n## Problem 1:\n\n## Ankush:\n`#!/bin/python3`\n\n`import operator`\n\n`total = 0`\n\n`while c in operator.add: #c is the character we are going to find if given as input`\n\n`", "answer": "C: blacksmith's shop"}

You are instead billed in terms of flat rates from a minimum charge for your plan and on a per minute basis depending on how high your usage is. For example, AT&T in the United States has a plan for $30/month where, for the first 200 minutes you call, you only pay for the first minute of the call then for the next 201 minutes, the call costs another 15 cents per minute you are on. So it costs you 15 cents/minute to be on for 200 minutes, 15 cents for the first minute when you are on, then 15 cents more for every minute until 200 minutes after that 15 cents has run out. So the rate for this plan goes from 15 cents a minute to 16.5 cents a minute for every minute, starting at 200 minutes. Now, if you go over the 200 minutes and call another time, it is 15 cents again for the first minute of that call and then 15 cen\nOutput: A \n\nInput: Which word in the first sentence is the adverb?

The first line of input contains an integer n (0 \u2264 n \u2264 5000) representing the number of people.  Assume that all people are healthy at the start of the epidemic.\n2. The next n lines each contain a single integer indicating the number of people who get sick on that day. In each line, there may be multiple non-negative integers but they are all less than or equal to 50.\n\nOutput:The number of people who died from the epidemic. \n\nInput: \nThe flu swept through a college campus this weekend.  The epidemic started with 25 people becoming ill. In fact, of the 44 people who remained healthy at the start, 17 people died from the epidemics after falling ill.  Given the above data, what\u2019s the probability that at least 5 people died from the epodemic?\nOutput: 0.48\n\n#### Case:Instrucction\n\nWe have 44 healthy people, from the start. of those 44 people 17 are infected, and 5 die, so the probability they die equals: \n5/38*100(1-17/44), so the probability that 5 or more people die from the epodemic is 75.29%\n\n\n#### Instruction\n\n\n1. The input contains a single integer, indicating the initial number of people.\n2. Each of the next n lines contains a single integer, denoting the number of people who will recover from the epidemic in that day. The total number of positive integers in the input lines does not exceed 50.\n3. The output can be at most 50, the number of initial people that did not die. The output can be either 0 or a positive number.\n\nInput: 50 people begin an epide", "answer": "C: bite"}

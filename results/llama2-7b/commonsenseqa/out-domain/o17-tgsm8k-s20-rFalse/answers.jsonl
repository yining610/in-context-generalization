(Hint: What is the difference between the two amounts, and what percent is it of the second amount?)\n\n### Reasons: In order to build a table, use 10 ft. of wood and 3 in. of nails, and when using 9 ft. of wood and five in. of nails build another table then the first table.\n\n### Rational: Use 10 ft. * 3 in. (30 in.), and the second use 9ft.* 5 in. (45in.).\n\n### Solution :\n10 feet * 3 in. = 30 in. - one half of 30in. * 10 / 9 = 3.71\nIf he needs 10 ft. for a table, he needs for another table 40in. - 1.3 * 10 = 45in.

{"text": "Drug store\n\n### Demoscene history\n\nBefore the 1980s, most computing was done within one department in an organization. One type of programmer, the systems programmer, handled the systems themselves; another type, the applications programmer, wrote programs for the systems. \n\nPrograms in the applications area were expected to be portable to the type of computer they were running on, so that a program written for one type of computer would function correctly on all types of similar machines that were made by the same company. \n\nIn the 1983 film WarGames, Matthew Broderick's character asks Dabney Coleman whether, if he were to travel to France, France's computers would understand him. Dabney Coleman's character replies, \"Why? Doesn't America get enough?\" \n\nAs early as 1924, when programming was still considered an experimental area, a committee of the American Mathematical Society made it clear that software should be modular and well-documented to facilitate reuse and change, and that the language should be standardized to promote portability. \n\nFrom this early work, the concept matured during the 1950s and 1960s in the fields of software engineering and computer science. \n\nIn 1943 Claude Shannon published A Mathematical Theory of Communication, in which he identified the properties of a mathematical model of communication that can be described as \"syntactically correct\". \n\nIn his book Datamatics (1950) John W. Mauchly called for the development of \"computer languages\" which would allow one computer to communicate with another. He defined a computer language as follows: \"A language consisting of a set of characters, rules, or symbols that can be manipulated according to a set of rules, producing a new set of characters, rules or symbols, with some specified interpretation.\" \n\nBy 1955 Shannon had come up with a simple way to express his theory mathematically, and to express the notion of a syntax for a set of communications that can be sent and received reliably. This work forms the basis for modern \"object oriented\" programming languages. \n\nThe first attempts at programming languages began in the late 1940s with what came to be known as \"assembler\"", "answer": "C: drug store"}

You may write your explanation. Write it on the answer sheet for your evaluation.\n\n### Explanation:\nThis is difficult for me because the question makes a mistake and it cannot possibly ask if something was laughing too much. The answer to the question would be to laugh louder, not that the person will get injured. Maybe someone could feel they will get injured but that is different from feeling like they were. This is something that is easy to not understand. Laughter has nothing to do at all with this.\n\n1. Choiced A cannot be correct because laughter cannot get you hurt.\n2. Choiced B cannot be correct because someone can laugh at a joke but they do not get hurt. They may find something to be funny or they like the jokes. They will never find them to be aggressive so if the answer is incorrect here it is because it cannot be that they are laughing.\n3. Choiced C cannot be correct because aggressive plays can have people who are playing that way. It could be people who are not being mean but they are just aggressive and that could be true of them. But the question is about laughter, not about being aggressive. That is also not being injured.\n\n### Final Verdict:\nThe answers are correct because they are not about injuries, which is not something that could happen from laughing. That is the only thing that could happen from laughter. The person would not be injured after they laugh. If they were injured, that would not be from laughter. So it is better to know these things for understanding.", "answer": "C: injury"}

What do they use to meet that requirement?\n\n### Explanation:A service-level agreement (SLAs) is a contract between a consumer and a service provider that lays out the quality of the service. An example of this is a cellular company guaranteeing a certain number of calls each month, or a broadband provider guaranteeing a certain minimum bandwidth per day. \n\n### An Example:\n\nIf your internet service provider (ISP) is having trouble resolving an outstanding customer complain, it may decide to start prioritising customers on a first-come-first-served basis. This will mean that the first customer to call the helpline will be put through before other customers, and that the last customer to call is less likely to get connected. It probably won't be because they are a slow or obnoxious customer, but rather due to the way traffic is processed on the system.\n\n### Internet Traffic:  \nIf a company that is providing video-on-demad (VoD) services to a country wants to ensure that their traffic flow is going in the right direction of internet, they can use Network Address Translation (NAT) to ensure that internet traffic is always", "answer": "C: do work"}

This would be a \"false\" choice because airports will always have an airport as one of the choices when we are asked to describe the location of a particular item. The other choice, D, is also false because we would not make the decision to ride an escalator with nowhere to go (the airport terminal). The fourth choice, E, refers to an entire airport.

We are given:  It takes 1 hour to come to room temperature, 15 to shape, 2 hours to proof, 30 to bake,  bake 15 minutes to proof, and the bakery can operate at 6:05. If there are two bakers, they can work 12.5 hours a day, or 75 hours a week. That is 10 (12.5) weeks which is 125 days. They would need to work overtime for two weeks a year. As 10 minutes times 2 weeks is not greater than 60 minutes so 10 minus 60 is 50, it would be possible for both bakers to set up the equipment, start, and fill one rack with dough by 6:50.\n\n### Input and Output Explanation: C)\n\n### Inputs: Tapanga and Kyle are both in a class of 65 students.

Make the script appropriate for the input you gave.\n\n\n## Instructions\nWriting the scripts for `Intervention`s (that is, the scripts for turning the `Demands` into\n`Replies`) is quite different than just composing `Reply`s for them.\n\nBecause `Reply`s may or may not be appropriate, you have to come up with a set of constraints\nfor what kinds of `Replies` are _allowed_, and we will generate random `Replies` that\nsatisfy those constraints.\n\nFor example, the example `Intervention` says that the carnies never ask twice for the same thing,\nand that they have to ask for something, so this `Intervention` generates a `Reply` that says\nthe carnie can only ask for something else.\n\nThis `Intervention` also says that the carnie will never say something that is the same as the last\nthing they said, so we won't generate `Replies` that say the same thing all the time.\n\nThe `Phrases` that were given make it possible for two `Demands` and their `Intervention`s to fit\ntogether to make a reasonable `Conversation`. If you write it this way, you can just write an\n`Intervention` for each pair.\n\nBecause we don't want the `Replies` to be overly repetitive, there may be some pairs that have two\n`Intervention`s. The pairs that correspond to each other will generate `Replies` like that!\n\nThe following two `Phrases` should be included in the `Intervention`s for each pair:\n\n```typescript\nask for something else.\nreply \"No.\" twice.\n```\n\n### Example:\nEach pair of Demands/Interventions/Replies can be represented by a 3-tuple:\n\n```types2cript\n(dem", "answer": "E: motel"}

{"text": "A\n\n### Input and Output:The time was displayed on a clock for 5 hours in which the hour hand was turned a quarter time. The time was displayed for 5 more hours in which the minute hand was turned a quarter of its length. What is the time displayed on the clock in minutes?\n\n### Input Choices:  A) 1 B) 2 C) 25 D) 12.5 E) 28.75\n\n### Choices:\nIn order for you to be able to solve the problem, you need to know these facts: the unit interval of clock time is 60 seconds; 1 hour = 60 minutes (multiplication) and 1 minute = 60 seconds (division).\n\nThe first problem statement gives us that we need to find the time on the clock. The answer to that is 55 minutes. Then, it gives us that the hour hand has been turned \u00bc of its length which is 15 degrees. Then, it gives that the hour hand has turned for another 55 minutes - which means 30 minutes for each quarter turn.\n\nSo, we know the hour hand is now a third of its length, which means one of three things:\n- The hand is at the quarter position and has just turned 15 degrees.\n- The hand has turned a little less than 1/4 of its length (15 + 15 * 0.5 = 18.75 degrees, and the answer given 15 = 12 and 18.7 = 25.\n- The hand is one of two things: halfway between the position of the hand when it started turning and the \u00bc of its maximum travel. Or, the hand is in the quarter position, just has started to turn, and has already turned for 30 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the time displayed on the time is 12:28.5 (25)\n\nIf the hour hand is at the quarter of its maximum position of its length, it has turned for 30*2 minutes(60)*30 minutes = 2700 seconds. That is not possible, so the answer must be wrong.\n### Task:Solve the following problem. There are 24 students in a classroom. They are arranged in 3", "answer": "E: wet"}

{"text": "C\n\n### Demostration:\n\nIf the answer is a group playing classical music, then it will be either B or C. The reason for this is there are multiple instrumentalists in a band playing classic music and multiple instruments in a symphony orchestra playing classical music. Therefore, if the choice is a group playing classical, then the answer could be C.\n\nAlso, the answer shouldn\u2019t be A or D.  A is incorrect because a music store does not carry an instrument that is more suited for a large ensemble, like a symphony orchestra. Therefore, it isn\u2019t included in a cello\u2019s answer choices. D will include any music store that has a cello, but the question makes it clear that it isn\u2019t a music store. It wants to specify that it\u2019s a store that sells musical instruments and they are not selling cellos, so A cannot be the correct answer and D can\u2019t be the correct answer because the question specifies that the music store only sells musical instruments with no mention of the cello. Therefore, the answer cannot possibly be D.\n\n\n### Hint 1: Think about what instruments can be found in a cello, and which instrument might play the cello in a musical piece.\n\n### HINT 2: The answer choices are: a(band) b(symphony) c(orchestral), d(string ensemble). String instruments, which have strings to pluck, include the cello. Symphony is an ensemble of many instruments. The string ensemble has a cello.\n\n### Demo of how I came up with the correct answer\n\nIt was initially hard figuring out how to solve this. I thought of the instruments and tried to imagine that the group would include every instrument I was able to think of. I had a large group of instruments in my head until I stumbled upon a string ensemble and remembered that symphonies are ensembles of many instruments with a cello. Cello players in symphonies are not exclusive to symphonies. They are also found in other genres. If the group was playing classical, then there are multiple options for how to solve the problem. Symphony or orchestral are choices along with a band. If the answer was a string ensemble orchestra, then the answer would be a symphony or orchestra because the cello is found in both groups.", "answer": "B: symphony"}

What's the easiest way to measure how much to add and what are some options?\n\n### Response. Measuring dry ingredients in dry ingredients by spoons with your hands can be difficult and messy when making larger recipes. When making larger recipes, you should use a dry measuring cup to ensure your ingredients are measured accurately. They range from teaspoon sizes all the way up to many cup sizes. They are often different colors so that you can distinguish that you are using a teaspoon from a tablespoon or a pint from a \u00bd pint. They can be made of plastic or glass, depending on what you are using them for. Measuring cups are also used to measure water, so when using a measuring cup, you use the same measurement as using a spoon with your hands.\n\n### Input : I want to go to a bar, but I also need to stay on a budget. What's one way I can save money on drinks?\n\n### Answer : One easy way to save money when going to the bar is to drink water instead of alcohol. This helps you to stay on budget and get the hangover less severe. When drinking water it doesn't cause as much of a stomach ache. Another tip is to ask the bartender to pour your drink weaker. Having the bartender not pour the booze as much saves you money by allowing you to drink the same amount of booze without pouring as much alcohol. This keeps you from feeling dizzy or buzzed.\n\n### Problem: There are 4 bags of mulch total, labeled A, B, C and D.

What is his total cost for bucking all of these vegetables?\n```\nC: $120\n```\nWe need to determine which one type is cheaper than the other, so we divide the values.\n```\n$280 / $280*30% = Cheaper vegetable will be $0.08 less per $1\n```\n```\n$0.08 / $0.92 = 0.09\n```\n```\nIf the price of cheeper vegetable type is $2.80, then the cost of the other type will be 2.88\n```\n```\nThen the total cost of vegetables = 2.88 * 7 + 2.80 * 5 \n= 120 + 140\n```\n```\n= $260\n```\n\n### Example for answer:\n```\nA", "answer": "A: prison"}

In both cases, there were panic selling and bank failures, which caused economic collapse and a decrease in overall business. People hoarded gold and sold the items of low value first. In turn, other companies had to shut down because there weren\u2019t nearly enough consumers to use or sell the products that they had. At one point, the economy had hit such a low that prices of staple goods, like bread and milk, plummeted to almost nothing. People went to an extreme which wasn\u2019t even necessary, in order to just provide themselves with necessities. In order to help fix a situation that the economy has found itself in, they took the exact opposite approach of the last depression: instead of panic selling, people bought more products than ever before in order to help stimulate the economy.\n\n### Input2-3:\n1. The first Great Depression lasted from 1921 until 1929. A second Great Depression occurred in the 1930\u2019s when the U.S. economy went into the worst depression in modern history.\n\n2. In 1929, the American economy started to fall, as Americans began selling their homes and businesses quickly in an effort to avoid financial devastation of the depression.\n\n3. In 1933 Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected president. In response to the crisis, when Roosevelt took office he made two of the main programs of New Deal: the National Recovery Administration and the Tennessee Valley Authority. The TVA program was an effort to get people to buy stock in these programs in order to provide income for the government. It became one of the fastest-growing energy utilities in the world.

He is in 4th grade, and has a few questions about the profession itself. Explain each question to Brian, and help him decide if being a Chef is right for him.\n\n### 1. How do I know if being a chef is the right job for me?\nChefs go to high school, and then go to special culinary arts colleges. There they learn how to prepare fresh food and serve it to people. While they're in college, they also go to work in restaurants as cooks. After they complete their study programs, they can get jobs as head chefs in restaurants. They also may teach cooking in schools where there\u2019s no chef.\n\n### What does a chef do on the job?\nA chef does a lot of things. He or she orders food. Then the cooks he or she hires prepare the food, and serve it to customers. They also clean up when the food is eaten. Chefs often manage big kitchens, supervising the work of their kitchen staff. They sometimes travel to supervise other chefs in different cities, to teach classes at cooking schools, and to go to culinary conventions. This is sometimes difficult. The hours can be long and the work is sometimes stressful.\n\n### How much money will I make?\nIf you go to culinary arts college, and then get a job as a cook, you may start out with a low income. But, if you get a good job and work hard, you will probably earn a good salary.\n\n### Answer Question 2\nExplain each question to Brian; Once you have finished you can submit your response to your teacher.\n**Question", "answer": "C: going to court"}

Which variable is the dependent variable in the given equation of a line?\n\n**A)** Y\n\n2. `y = +- (a-b)x + c` is an equation of the line in the given fixed equation of a line where a, c, and d are the constants while - - are the given variables. But the given fixed equation of the line is `3x - 3y = 4`. It can be substituted by the mentioned equation. But the value obtained by a variable is the result of adding two values of two variables.\n\nSo, the equation will be: `3x - 6y = 4`. Which is correct. \n\n3. The given fixed equation of a linear equation is `y = 2x - 10`.\n\nNow, let's see the difference between the line that passes through the point `(12,- 23)` and passes through the point `(6,- 32)` by drawing them.\n\n### Explanation:If the line passes through the point `(x1,y1)` and `(x2,y2)` respectively, the `y` coordinate of a point can be given as `Y = m*(X-x1) + y1`, where `m` is the coefficient of the line. \n\nSo, `y = 3*(4-1) + 4 = 7`\n\n### Input:\"Near the lake, a frog hides in its natural environment.\"\n\nThe word \"hide\" is a verb which has the following five forms: \n\n- base form (hide)\n- simple past (hidded)\n- past participle (hid)\n- present participle (hiding)\n- 3rd form (hiding)", "answer": "B: populated area"}

{"text": "A\n\n### Instructions:In the following activity, you will create a program that converts a string into a Roman numeral.\n\nThe first step is to convert the string into a number. To convert a string representing a date or a timestamp to an equivalent numeric value, use the Unix epoch format:\n\"yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss\" The first year of the Unix epoch is 1970.\n\nThe following example demonstrates the format string to be used for converting a string to a Unix timestamp. \n\n```js\nconst getYear = str => {\n  const parts = str.split(\"-\");\n  return Number(parts[2]) + Number(parts[1]) * 100 + Number(parts[0]) * 10 * 1000;\n};\n\nconst getMonths = (i) => Math.ceil(i / 10) * 10;\n\nconst getDays = (i) => i % 10;\n```\n\nCreate a function, convertStringToUnixTimestamp, that takes as a parameter a string representing the given dates. The string must be in the format described in getYear. \n\nThe function must convert the given date into a Unix timestamp, then return the value as a string.\n\n```js\nconvertStringToUnixTimestamp(\"2020-03-24 00:00:55\");\n```\nOutput:\n1584884265\n\nThe Roman numeral system is an ancient, number naming system for counting. The Romans invented the Hindu-Arabic numeral system as well as other numbering systems, including the Roman numeral system.\n\nThe following is an example of how numbers in a Roman numeral system are written:\n\n```\nI=1 M=10 V=5 X=10 L=50 XL=50\n```\n\nAs seen above, a Roman Numeral can be written using the single letters from 1 to 50 or using the combinations of these letters.\n\nThe following function, romanNumeral, is defined to transform a Roman numeral into a number or a combination of Roman numerals. The two input parameters are a Roman numeral and a given Roman numeral value. Inputs", "answer": "D: doors and windows"}

{"text": "The correct response is Crockpot as it is cooking slowly, using the same ingredients. It can be cooked indoors or outdoors which is the same. However restaurant and barbeque are incorrect and they imply different items are being cooked unlike the other 2 choices.\n\n### Input and Response Explanation:\nWhat we are doing here is called a conditional statement.  It is simply one if, else statement with an if/else statement that is in an if/else if statement. The way these conditional statements work are by using logical statements; the most basic of which is that an if statement is true, only then should we execute the statement that follows it.  This statement is called an if statement.  There will always be another statement that is not selected, which is called a else statement.\n\nThis is a if statement. What you do is simply select one of the 5 choices. I have written three statements. The first is for 'A', the second is for 'B', and the last is for 'C'.  If you select 'A', it will execute the first statement,  The third statement is the else statement where none of the above conditions are met so nothing happens.\n\nThis is an if/else if. I have written two statements with the same conditional checker as mentioned before. The first statement, like before, selects one choice among 5.  The second statement in this else if is if none of the choices we picked in the first else if statement were true, it will select A as the choice. It will then execute the only statement we have here to be executed.\n\nAfter the else if is a else statement similar to before. If none of the before statements were executed, we will end up in here, the last place where we can run some statements. \n\n### Inputs:Write 20 math problems in which you can answer the question with two or more numbers and then find their product or quotient, such as 3 * 5 = 15, 2/3 = 1/2.\n\n### Explanation:\nIn my response, I have 2 methods where I found a product.

He sold 572 chips. Ali had to give $3 of the profit from the chips to a local fundraiser. How much profit did the chocolates give Ali?\n\n### Response\nAli made $1111.60 ($16 x $8 + $116 x $10 - $3)\n\n### Rationale:\nIf Ali had an extra 16 chocolates, he would have 15 chocolates, which would've been enough to cover all the profits from the chips. So what he's doing is paying $1111 with his $8 per bar profit and his $3 from the fundraiser.\n\n### Example:\n\nBecause there are 8 chocolate bars per $8 profit, and 12 chips per $10 profit, Ali has a profit of $8 per bar and $10 per chips. If Ali is left with $3 profit from his chips, it means he'll lose $3 from his $16 profit from his chocolates. Therefore, he has $13.44 left.\n\n#### Rework Example\nBecause now, there are 16 chocobars per $8 profit. This means that he has to sell 572 chocobars.

She needs to find out if you call a container that holds the sword'scabbard' or do you call the container that holds the sword itself'scabbard'. Her friend suggests she should ask her Aunt Betty and her Uncle Jack, who know something about swords. But when she asks, she learns that they both have heard the term'scabbard' before. Betty should ask her friend Jenny next, who knows a lot about swords. Unfortunately, Jenny has also heard of the term'scabbards' and does not know the answer. Next, Betty asks her best friend Lisa about the term. Lisa tells Betty that she knows nothing about'scabbards' like her Aunt and Uncle Betty, and only knows that sometimes people call the container'scabbard.' Betty is feeling pretty frustrated at this point, but then she thinks to herself 'this must be a word that swords people use.' Next she asks her dad, who is somewhat familiar with the term'scabbord', but he does not know the answer either. Betty gets frustrated and then her mom says that she may have heard of a sword closet before and that is what they are actually called. Betty knows that her mother, despite knowing some other interesting things, has no clue about the sword related items in her home. Betty is disappointed and feels like she has reached rock bottom. Her mom tries to comfort her by saying that it's ok, there are many things about swords that she will never understand. Betty is left wanting to be anywhere else, but home.

He decided to present a fun challenge instead that might change their minds.  He then walked to the front of the classroom and started teaching problem solving in front of them.  He first presented 2 equations that had a common denominator.  After that he taught them how to work out a fraction.  He then asked, \u201cIf a car is going the speed of 60 miles per hour and accelerates at 3 miles per hour every hour.  How far will it travel over a time period of 4 hours?\u201d  Everyone was quiet.  What is the answer?\n\n### Demostration: The car is going at 60 MPH, then in every hour increases by 3 MPH.

If there are any more marbles in the box, you can't put them in box 3. If you can put more marbles in the 3 box (if they are 2s and 3s), then you can put more marble in the box 2 with 3 or 3, which will give you a 3 if you have 2 and 5 if you have 3 with n+2.

And using the fact that the range is in the right places, I have 0 possibilities and no real median. If I have 0.5-0.4 = 0.1 possibilities (1/10) in the first simulation and 0.4-0.3 = 0.1 (1/10), I get a median that isn't real numbers (0.1 or 0.9). The only way to get a real median using real numbers is to multiply it by integer so (integer (0.1))(integer (0.9)) = 0.09 or use decimals.

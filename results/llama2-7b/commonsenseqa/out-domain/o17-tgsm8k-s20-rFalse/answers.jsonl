The country currently produces 54400 bananas and the current price for a banana is $3. How many pears and apples can be made at the current price given that each pear is produced with $1.68 worth of resources? If each apple is produced with $0.66 worth of resources, how many apples and pears can be made with the current price?\n\nSolution. First, we solve 0.66*current_apples + 1.68*current_pears = country's_fruit_production \n\nNext, we substitute $3 to get the current production_of_banana = current_apples + current_pears \n\nThen, we substitute the second equation in the first equation to get current_apples =(current_fruit_production - $3)/1.68 \n\nFinally, we substitute $3 in the second equation to get current_pears = current_fruit_production- current_apples/0.66 \n\nOutput : 38, 22792, 57500\n\n##### Input 3\n\n<pre>70\n</pre> \n\n<pre>-2\n</pre>\nInput.

Choices: 1: 2.55 cents 2: A 3.10 cents 3: B 3.35 cents 4: C 3.40 cents 5: D 2.50 cents\nOutput: C\n\n### Solution:\n\nThe first question requires us to find out how many candies Corey has by working from the given condition:\n$$ 66 = Tapanga \u2013 8 $$\n$$ 66 - 8 = Tapanga $$\n\nSo, we can say Tapanga has 58 candies (or 29 candies more than Corey).\n\nThe second question asks us to calculate the total amount of dollars spent to call family members on New Year's eve. We can calculate the total amount by firstly working out the local call cost and then the international call cost. Therefore the formula would be like so: 5 cents x number of local calls + 25 cents x 31 minutes x number of international calls x number of international calls. We can rewrite the formula as: $1.25 x Number of local calls + $ 7.75  x Number of minutes x 31  = Dollars Spent. Therefore our answer would be $6.50 - $13.50 = $1.\n\nThe third question requires we use subtraction to take away the smaller amount from the larger amount to find how many hours would be if the total was the same.\n$$ Number of local and international calls \\space \\space \\space  \\text{(600 hrs)} $$\nTherefore we can find how many hourly local times we have. To do this we can use $$ x \u2013 60 = local time + 60 $$ and $$ 6 \u2013 x = Total hours + 60 $$\nSince we know that local time is 600, the final answer is found using x=626 (so 626-60= local time, 626-24=total hours)\n\nThe fourth question asks us to find out how much money we would get from Boris after", "answer": "B: cash in"}

In this problem, if there are 5, 10, 15 or 20 cars coming in, you know that you're going to need to use them all but they don't have to fit exactly, they can use all the available space. To calculate your answer, first figure out the total available space (100) minus how many units are being used for other vehicles (10-15) you then figure out which part you want to use (left, right, or center).\n\nFor example,\n\nLeft: 75 - 16 = 59 spaces available\nRight: 20 - 25 = -5 spaces available\nCenter: 65 - 16 - 25 = 24 spaces available\n\nOnce you've figured out how much space you have to use per car, simply take the available amount and divide it by the total number of cars.

So 28 + 32 = 60.\nThen, to find how many candies Corey has, we subtract 28 from 60.\nHence Corey will receive (29 - 28) number of candies, which is 1.\n-This question is based on telephone call rates.\nI believe the way you would solve this question is to first compare the number of calls per dollar.\nIt is clear that the international call is 25 cents per minute and the local call is 5 cents per minute.\nBut is 25 cts cheaper than 5 cts?\nThe answer is yes.\nSo local call costs are 2.5 times cheaper than international call per minute.\nBy multiplying 31 minutes with this rate, we get $7.75.\nHowever, calling to an international number for 31 minutes is charged $16.25.\nHence the total local call is charged $16 minus $7.75 = $8.25.\nThus we get the answer as $8.25, the difference betweend the two local call expenses.\n-This is based on a clock.\nLet us look at the numbers displayed by the clock.\nTime displayed by clock = (45 + 5) minutes = 50 minutes\nWhen we remove 50 minutes from 60 minutes we get 10 minutes.\nThus, 60-10 = 50, the time T in which the time spent, is equal to 50 (10 min is subtracted from 60 min)\n-This is based upon money.\nAns: 10 dollars.\nLet 'M' be the money spent for the call.\n'M' = 10", "answer": "E: small case"}

We can determine the order of the day of these meals based on the position of these meals on the refrigerator. Here is how the order is determined: If two dishes are on top of each other, it means the one on top is prepared first (for example, the sandwiches from the refrigerator) If one dish is at the top and one is at the bottom, the bottom one is prepared after.  For example, the bread is cooked first if it is on the bottom (first).  If one dish is in the middle, then the other two must be in the front of it and not the back.  The meal cooked last (the one on the bottom side) is the one on the right. Then, the meal on the next to the right is cooked. Then, the meals are cooked until they are reached by the left, which is a total of nine meals.

He went shopping twice, but only the first time did he go alone. How much did he spend if the first time he went shopping he bought things for his wife and sons, but the second time he only bought things for himself?\nOutput: Dino went shopping for the first time at the store two days ago. In his first visit, he bought things for his sons but also his wife,  so he spent $8 on them.\nDino also went shopping a day ago, but did not bring anyone with him. He therefore only spent $7 on himself.\nTherefore, Dino has spent a total of $8 + $3 = <<8+3=11>>11 dollars shopping.\nThat means, in total, Dino has spent 11 dollars shopping for a total of 2 trips\nSo the final answer $11\n\nInput: A year has 52 weeks. On the first six months of the year, I spent $1,000 a week. On the last twelve months of the year, however, the price of everything doubled.

(The first six months of the first year were just 6 instances of $1,00 a week for a total of $6,000. The last twelve months of the second year with the doubled prices was $12,000.) The answer is the average $8500/12=$708.33 per month for a total of $8500 for a total of 12 months.\nSo the final value per month is $708.30\nSo the final value is 708.3\n\nInput: How many days has it now been since May 18, 1796, and until May 19, 1797?\nOutput: 365 days (this", "answer": "C: bitterness"}

How old is the youngest person in the group?\nOutput: We first find the average. The average of 15 people is 15/6= <<15/6=2.5>>2.5\nSince we found the original group has 15/6 people, then the group needs 4 more people to fill up 6 people, so there would be 19 people in all. \nFrom this, we know the smallest group needs to be 4 people. We can choose one of them and replace it with another person. The new group still has 15/5 people in all. 15+15/5= <<15+15*5/5=20>>2\nThus, 19+19= <<19+19>48 >>.48 is the number which we can replace to make smaller group. The original group needs 4 people to be smaller than the new group and the new group also needs 4 people to make equal in size, so the final new group has 16 people.\nThus our new original group is 16 people. The youngest person needs to be 1 fewer than the average person, which means they have to be 16-15= <<16-15>=1>>1 year old.\nSo the final group is 1*1+=1 >>1.\nSo, the final answer is 1\n\nInput: A company makes $120,000 a year in profit. 20% of its revenue is profit. 25% of profits are saved for future growth. 5% is given back to investors. 20% is spent on research.

{"text": "The word \u201cdocument\u201d is the subject of this question. \u201cIf it is not obtuse,\u201d makes this question a conditional question, requiring the use of \u201cthen\u201d.

The \u201cwhile\u201d part means it is called a \u201cwhile loop\u201d. \u201cwhile loop\u201d is the correct answer.\nThe \u201cdo\u201d part, as the very next instruction, would indicate \u201cdo something\u201d.\nSo while is a special kind of do loop (called a \u201cwhile loop\u201d).\nSo the final answer should be true.\n\nInput: \u201cWhat value does a variable that is set without assigning it a value take?\u201d Choices:  garbage variable uninitialized variable undefined variable undefined value\nOutput: A variable that is not assigned a value has no value, because a variable only has a value if it is defined.\nThe phrase \u201cundefined value\u201d is incorrect, because that is used for variables that are assigned to have a value different from zero. Additionally, the phrase also suggests that initializing a variable with \u201c1\u201d is a common thing people do.\nThe phrase \u201cuninitialized variable\u201d also suggests initializing the variable with a different value, but actually doesn\u2019t specify that the default value is zero.\nSo the phrase \u201cundefined variable\u201d is an accurate description.\nThe word \u201cgarbage\u201d is incorrect because garbage has no value at all, and is not a valid description for variable that has not been given a value.\nAnd the phrase \u201cempty variable\u201d is also incorrect because it is", "answer": "D: clear"}

He wants to get to his destination as quickly as possible. How many buses would he have to take to get there from downtown?\nOutput: The distance from downtown to his destination is 20 units. There must be a bus that goes downtown to downtown, since that's in the question, since it's his only direct form of transportation.

The sum of two odd numbers is even\nOutput:\nIf two odd numbers are multiplied by 2, their sum will also be odd.\nIt is also true that if two odd numbers are evenly divided by 2, their difference will now be even.\nFor example, if two odd numbers are 11 and 9, their difference is 2.\nThat means that if 11 and 2 are multiplied by 1/2, the result is 1.\nThat means that the new difference from the previous calculation is 1.\nSay the difference of two odd numbers 11 and 52 is 41.\nBecause 41 is even, the two numbers are not odd.\nTwo even numbers have the same sum if they are different.\nFor example, 45 and 6 have the same sum but are not odd.\nAnother way to say what the question is asking is that:\nif an odd number and an even number were multiplied by 1, would their difference be even?\nIf they multiply them by 3, would their sum be even?\nIf we add them together, can we obtain odd or even?\nIs there something between the numbers that makes them different, like a common", "answer": "E: heat up"}

Plato and Aristotle never met each other, and Socrates never met Plato, although the latter was a student of the former. Socrates and Plato were both executed, and both Socrates and Aristotle had students who became philosophers themselves (Aristotle\u2019s pupils include Alexander the Great). If you travelled back in time to Ancient Greece (and then returned to the present), how many living philosophers could you interview?\nOutput: Let\u2019s say you are on a time machine. If you travelled back to a pre-historic age, which you cannot enter because the time machine will not work on certain ages, you could travel back to Alexander the Great\u2019s time when Aristotle was still alive and interview him. But since you\u2019re travelling back in time to this age, there will be no time machine to use to return from the age you were in. So you cannot bring the philosophy you have received from Aristotle to the future. Therefore, you cannot interview him.\nBut if you were able to bring him from that age to the present (because of time machine capabilities), then he will be a philosopher in the present and you can interview him. But then again you cannot come back to the future with him.\nThen if you travelled to the future then you cannot be able to interview him because he would already be dead. So in this case you cannot interview him. \nIf Plato was not yet to be born then travelling from his time would do nothing as you\u2019ve already travelled through him. Similarly, you cannot interview him in his lifetime since the time machine cannot travel to such time and age.\nBecause there are so many philosophers you are able to interview from your time machine only Socrates, Aristotle and Plato.\nSo a total of three philosophers could be interviewed by you.\nSo the final question is Plato, Aristotle and Socrates.\n\nInput: Your favorite", "answer": "B: singing"}

The original cost was determined by a price list of the different components of the trip, which included airplane tickets that cost an average of about $400, hotel rooms that cost an average of $700, and rental vehicles that cost on average $45 a day.\nOutput: The price of the trip ended up being the amount of the original price of the trip that is 120/10% above the price of a one-way plane ticket.\nSo take the price of the trip to be the amount of the original total price of the trip that's 120/2*110%=<<120/2*(110/100)/100=14>>14%.  This is equal to the original total price of airplane tickets.\nThen multiply the original price of airplane tickers by 14 to give you the original total price of a single airplane ticket, which is the price of the trip.\n\n\nInput The number of students in Mr. Vaughan's class is between 25 and 50  inclusive.\nGiven: The number of students in the class is a multiple of 4  and\nGiven: The average value is less than 40.\nOutput: The average value must be smaller than 30.\n\nSolution: The average value is the sum of a list of values divided by the total number of values in the list. \nTake the total number of values to be the total number of students in the school, which is less than or equal to 100 students. \nTo sum together a list of values, divide the total number of values by the length of the list, which is the number of values in the range.\nSince the range of values is between two numbers, the total number of values is necessarily less than equal to the greater of the two numbers.\n\nInput: If a number is equal to 1% of 45,", "answer": "A: reach tentative agreement"}

Each thread runs forever, but they may block at times waiting for an event (mutex). Event handling is performed in a lock-step manner, as each event causes one of the threads to pause for a long time (usually between 7-12 seconds). If you have a 2-core processor and the tasks each take 1 second to run, how many maximum tasks can you run on a CPU? What is the expected time to run the 20 tasks?\nOutput: You can run a max of two tasks at any given time. \nThe time for each task is 1s, \nand the processing time from one task to another for the lock is 7-12s\n\nTo figure out the first question, we can simply plug in the number of threads to be able to run and see the time taken. \n\nSo the time taken to run the 15th task is: 15 * (1s + 12s) = <<15*(1s+12s)=8.75>>8.75s\n\nTo time how long to run 20 tasks we would have to figure out all the numbers above and use them to do another calculation\n\nSo it takes 2 * (7s + (15*12) = <<2*(7s+(15*12)=204.25>>204.2333\u2026.s\n\nThe second question, what is the expected time to get 20 tasks done.

So, round 60,57% for 20% and round 60,0% for 102, because then you will have 60,6% (0.606). Since the question reads 8%, you could subtract 0.072, which is 72 * 0,08. You can subtract this because you know 102 is less than 100%, and since it is stated in the question that you need a minimum of 20 vote for \u201cno\u201d, there will be less. Since there is difference between 4-8, and 12-13, it will be 72 votes, rounded down to 72, and then subtract from 102, resulting in 21 votes.

In this question, the person probably doesn't know what it is trying to understand. I will simplify it in two parts.\nThe person asks: How much liquid does one cup contains?

{"text": "Viruses reproduce, which is why they are also sometimes referred to as'replication machines.'\nA virus typically infects your body and stays there. The virus can replicate itself, meaning that when the original virus is gone, the virus has now made several new ones to go and infect other cells as well.  But in order to do that, the viruses need a host. A virus can replicate on its own, but it can't replicate unless it's been replicated to a new host.\nViruses work by taking over your DNA so that when your DNA is replicated, the virus is also replicated. If your body cannot destroy a virus or your body can't kill an infected cell, then the virus can keep replicating and using your body as a host for its existence. They're similar to bacteria in how they replicate, although viruses are much smaller.\nEven though viruses can replicate and multiply, viruses are small and are not made of living tissue. Viruses are made of genetic material, such as DNA or RNA, and they can enter into a living host by breaking open an infected cell.\nSo the final choices is 'B'\n\nInput: In a survey, 2.6% of people who ate the food reported they had felt unwell, and 25.5% reported that they found it was too spicy.

Adam bought 3 kilogram of nuts that cost $12 per kilogram and 2.5  kilograms of dries fruits that cost $8 per  kilogram. So that means the total cost of food for adam is:\n$$3*12=< 3*12=46>>46$$\nAnd $$2.5*8 = <2.5*8==22>>22$$\nSo that means the total cost for food for adam is $46+22=<46+22==68>>68$. For John, he bought 354  grams of chocolates at $0.72 per gram and 319  grams of candy at the same cost. So that means the cost for food for John is: $$354*0.72 = <354*0,72==301>>301$$\nAnd $$319*0,72 = <319*0.72==255>>255$$\nSo that means he bought $301+255=<301+265==566>>466$ worth of food. So the total cost for food bought by both the boys is $200+$566=$<200+566==766>>666$.\nThat means the total weight of food bought by the two boys is $2056/666~2.3 times as large as the weight of food by john and adam combined.\nThe total time of gym session by James, is as follows:\nThe total time spent by him warming up is $60*20=<60*20==1200>=1200$ minutes, as the cost of gym is $200*(1200/365)% =<200*1200/7>>1200%.

{"text": "This is a logic question.\nThe question tells me that people \"often\" go see movies at the theater.\nIf they wanted to watch it at home, they would not go spend the money for it.\nAlso, if they wanted a more privite experience, they would not go see it at the theater. \nIf they wanted to see it on a small screen, they wouldn't go to the theater.  I know to look for the answer that is the only option that isn't one of those.\nThe train station does not fit any of these criteria.  In order to find the best answer, we eliminate the other answers and we do this by asking \"how can this be false\". For the train station, \"at the theater\" in the question is a synonym for the movie theater.  This means that we ask if it could be false based on the other answers given.  Since the only other answer given is \"bathroom\", we can ask how can \"the theater\" be a bathroom.  We know that the answer cannot be true because the theater and the bathroom are completely different places. The same reasoning can be applied to all the other answers.  They are all answers which \"often\" make people go to theaters, but are not the same as \"the theater\".\nSo the final answer has to be \"theater\".\n\nInput: Aaron's house is 10 miles away from the train station and 15 miles away from the bathroom. The train leaves once every hour and the bathroom is near the train station. He plans to take the train to the bathroom and walk to his house from there but he won't be able to complete the entire journey by 9:30. How many minutes past 9:30 should he leave his house in order for him to show up at the bathroom by 9:35.\nOutput: The train leaves at 30 minute intervals (every hour).\nStarting at 9:15, there is enough time to reach the bathroom (15 - 10) at the next train stop before 9:30 (10 miles). Starting ten minutes before 9:35 would be at 9:25 and with some traffic or other unpredicted complications that is just enough time to avoid being late.\nSo the final solution", "answer": "D: theater"}

But the den is like an extra room for when you need to go in there or do any stuff. And i don't think that you want to have more furniture in there than what you need to. Like if the den serves as a home office, i dont think it would be that good to put a chair and a desk in there with a computer. Aside from all that a family room is where i would put it.\nSo it should be : Family room\nThat is because for a den there are other activities there.

Like a room for a home office, a room for storing things, a place to do some other activity. Those extra rooms that are kinda small.\nSo all that should go in the den area.

The only difference is that the number you choose is divided by an 1, and all the odd factors of that number will not appear as common factors because 1 is odd, so you will be left with an even number of factors, and that will be the largest common factor of your numbers.\nFor instance, the largest common factor of numbers 1557281 and 2385935 can be calculated by listing the divisor of all the prime numbers larger than the product: <<15572...81>1;2;3;5;7;11;13;17;19;29;41;...67;89;>>155721*23859...31 is 67, so the largest common factor is 67.\nSo the final answers for the number of common factors is 3 and for the largest common factor is also 3\n\nInput: \u200bFamous movie producers George Lucas and Steve Spielberg produced these three movies:\u200b \"Star Wars\", \"E.T.\",\u200b and \"Jurassic Park\".

The train leaves the city of A and must reach the city of B within 6 hours. Another train is also expected to arrive within the same time. The second train will take 1 hour to arrive in B, but it carries 40 passengers. How many passengers can the first train carry to reach B on time with this second train?\nOutput: The first train with its full capacity of 26 passengers can be loaded in 20*10 = <<20*10=200>>*200 minutes\nThe second train can be loaded in 1*10 = <<1*10=10>>10 minutes.\nAs long as there are 360 minutes (6 hours) remaining, the first train can take 266 loads (266*40/20 = <<40*20/266=15>>5 passengers per load)\nTherefore, the first train can carry a maximum of 15 + 266 = <<15+266=281>>281 passengers\nSo the final answer 281\n\nInput: At the end of the summer  Tom's father was 5 yards away from Jim.

A car that has 40 miles-per-gallon on the highway uses 5 gallons for every 50 miles on the highway. On average, how far can you drive after filling up your car if you have 40 gallons of gas?\nOutput: Using an average temperature of 70 and only needing to use 40 miles to drive, you can drive 40*40 = <<40*40=1600>>1600 miles.\nIf you do not count the 1 day out of every 5 that your car might breakdown from driving in the rain\nand need 5 gallons of gas during that drive, you can drive\n5*50 = <<5*50=250>>250 miles\nWith 250 miles on your car after 50 miles of running, it would take 250/40 = <<25*2>>5 days of driving for you to empty your 40 gallons.\nThat means you can go 1600-5 = <<1600-20>>1590 miles on a tank of gas.\nSo to answer the question, it would take you\n159/10 * 7 = <<59/10*7=79>>79 days to use up your complete tank of gas.\nOn average it would take you\n7+5/10 = <<7+5/19>>116 days per tank of gas for you to drive for about a season.\nSo to answer \nHow far can you drive every day you fill your tank\nif you have 40 miles per gallon?\nThe answer is 40 miles every day for every tank filled.\nSo the final is\n1600/40 = #\n\n\n\nInstruction:Answer the following questions.\n\n# Write a program that reads the number of days in a given number and returns how many months it takes to go from the specified number of days to the first day of the month.\n\nInput: An input of 75 days", "answer": "A: winners and losers"}

It is situated on a 1 meter wide, flat platform. The edge of the platform has a sharp 45 degree inclined border. There is a rectangular piece of land near the border where the statue stands that is also 1 meters wide. The whole platform is surrounded 30 meters wide by water. In the water, there is a lump of rocks that are as tall as the water itself. (Note: in other words, the lump is 30 meters high.) You are standing on the platform. If you jump off the platform, in what direction should you jump to not land on the lump of rocks?\nOutput: In the middle of a city, there are three different possibilities that someone would jump off a high platform into the water:\n\nThe jump that is most common is a normal jump with feet first. After impact with the water, the feet may stay or travel beneath the surface, depending on water temperature. (Requires the assumption that the two sides of the platform are symmetrical)\n\nJump in to one of the two water-sides in the two available ways: forward or backward. The two ways are dependent on whether the platform is flat.\n\nWhen a person jumps on to one of the two sides with the assumption that the platform is flat, a fall may be expected, depending on the height.\n\nA forward jump from a platform to a waterfront (one that is not flat) may result in a foot traveling forward beneath the surface.\n\nA backward jump from a platform to the waterfront (one that isn't flat) may result in feet traveling backwards or forward beneath the surface. (A forward travel may also happen here)\n\nA sideways jump from a platform to one of the two waterside may result in either feet landing at or before the waterside or after.\n\n\nInput: John", "answer": "B: bedroom"}

Which height of a box should the piece of wood have to fill the entire box?\nOutput: For an empty toolbox, the volume of the box is V=12*3*6 = <<6*3*6=21>>21 cubic inches.\nThe height of the box is H = <<2*(23-13)>>31 cubic inches. (It is a range, but we can ignore the lower 6 inches, so 2*(23-7)) \nThe volume of the box is <volume of the toolbox>. To fill the entire box, the height of the piece of wood must equal the volume of the box.\nThe volume of the wood = length * width * thickness = 21*2*1 = [[44]] in cubic inches.\nChoose the height closest to 44 inches. This height will fill the entire box.\nSo the final chosen answer is 44\n### Part B\n\nInput: If a person has to spend a certain amount of money for some products or services, he would first find the most efficient way to purchase the product and save maximum amount of money.

How many like watching TV?\nOutput:There are 30 students, meaning 1/3 * 30=<<30*1/3=10>>>10 students will like reading fiction, and 2/5 * 30= 18 students will like watching TV.\nSo, at least <<30*1/5=>>15 students don\u2019t like watching.\n\nAnswer in comments: There will be 10 + 15 = <<15+10>>25 students who will NOT like watching or reading fiction. So there will be 45 students who will NOT dislike either TV or fiction. A maximum of 10/5 of the students can dislike both (10/5 * 35 = <<10/5*35=7>>7 students).

{"text": "Choice E might be a good answer :)\n\n#### **Output:**\n\nThe old time doctor might have tried to let blood using a leech.\n\n#### **Explanation:**\n\nFrom the information given, it can be said that a leech is probably a parasite. An old time doctor might have used a leech to \"let blood\", as leeches can be used to \"suck blood\". An old time doctor might use leeches \"to distance himself\".\nThe given choices are as follows:  A: heart trnasplant, B: distance himself, C: perform surgery, D: study medicine and E: let blood.\nFrom the information provided, we can infer that there would be no need to perform any kind of heart transplant, as he probably wouldn't have the tools or knowledge to perform such a complex operation. Also, as the old time doctor was probably not a distance himself. The old time doctor probably didn't need to study medicine as he didn't have the tools and knowledge of present day medicine. An old time doctor probably wouldn't perform surgery as he might have needed the tools and knowledge (and might need a proper surgical instrument) to perform surgery.\nThis leaves us with two choices: C and E. It is possible that the old time doctor might have chosen E: let blood. This makes the most sense of the choices available, as he could've used leeches to relieve blood pressure, or even to \"draw blood\", as it was used to do in olden times.\n\nWe can also conclude that A: heart transplant is incorrect, as the given choice does not indicate why the old time doctor might use a leech. B: distance himself sounds logical, but the lack of information indicates that we cannot tell if it is true or not.\n\n#### **Input:**\n\nLet A = [1,1], B = [1,2]\nLet \u03c0(A) = 1 and \u03c0(B) = 0\nThen C = {p(A),p(B)} = {1,0}\n\u03c0(C) = -1\n\n#### **Exercise:**\n\n#### **Expected output:**\n\nA = [8,6]\nB = [4,2]\n\n#### **Solution:**\n\nA solution would be to find the smallest", "answer": "E: let blood"}

There are a total of three opponents: animals 2, 3, and 4.\nThere is a 75% chance that Pete will win.\nWith a 75% winning percentage, there is a 75/3 * 75% = <<75/3*75%=56.875>>56.87% chance that Pete is the winner of that fight.\nThere is a remaining 25/3 * 25% = <<25/3*25%=7.875>>7.875% chance that one of the other two animals will win.\nSo there is a 84.75/3 = <<84.75%*3==28.187>>28.18% chance that he will get into a fight.\nSo the final probability that Pete will win is 75/3 = <<<75%/3=25%>>25%, and there\u2019s a 28.18+25 = <<28.18=53.18>>53.18% chance for Pete to get into a fight. That\u2019s a 53.18/2 = <<53.18/%>2=26.59% chance that Pete doesn\\t win the fight.\nSo the answer is 26.59%.\n\nInput: James wants to buy a used 2019 Honda Accord.

This is equal to 64 * (\u2153 of 400) = 48. The density of owls is 48/3. = 16 owls.\nAsked: Alice and Jack go to the forest on the same day.\nAlice saw 1 owl, 800 birds, and Jack saw 40 owls and 16 deers.\nSo, both saw 16 owls, so the density of owls = (48+40)/[(1", "answer": "E: south pacific ocean"}

John is working on a new meal plan that includes $2.50 sandwiches. If he had a $3 per hour job, his paycheck is $1600. How long would it take to have John quit his job and eat all sandwiches on the new plan?\nOutput: Assuming a normal number of working days for a year, it would take three months.\nIf he had a $3/hour job, his paycheck would be 3 hours x $3 hr x $1600 = <<1600*3:3000>>$5,000. In order to have John quit his $3/hour job without eating sandwiches, he needs to have 5 * $2.50 = <<5*2.50=12.5>>12.5 sandwiches per day. But even if John ate every sandwich, he would have had to purchased 4*365 = 1,460 sandwiches ($14,600) if he had bought the sandwiches. So, John would not have enough money at the end of the one year if he had tried to purchase all sandwiches. Now, if John eats only 4.5*365/5 = <<5:365>>134.5 sandwiches a year, he can afford to eat $1600 worth of sandwiches with $5,000 left over from his regular check.\nSo he quits his job, and eats 134.5 per year, taking three months to eat the $1600 left over.\nSo the final  answer is three months\n\nInput: The city population is 167,000, and there are 25 city employees who eat 12 meals from a local pizza restaurant each day.

{"text": "You dont have a conductor. There are other choices to think about though.\n\n### Input and Response\n\n### Demand explanation:\nInput: John has to refuel his airplane. It used to\ncost him $200 to refresh the tank. He\u2019s got an\nextra tank, so he can double the fuel capacity.\nFuel prices went up by 25%. When do you think\nJohn bought his extra tank?\n\n#### Answers\nThe cost to fill a tank is based on multiplying\nthe unit of fuel times the price of fuel. Since the\nprice of fuel went up and the capacity doubled,\nJohn is going to spend more to fill the tank.\nBased on what we know, we know the price increased\nand we know John has an extra tank so we can\nfigure out the number of units and the cost per\nunit, both of which will increase the cost of refueling. So\nthe total number of units is 200 + 2(extra tank) * 25% increase = 80 * 2 = 160.\nWe could also think about this a different way. John goes to fill up and is\ncharged the total cost. If the cost increased by 200% and the tank capacity\ndoubled, then the new cost to fill up is going to be more than the cost\nto fill up with his old tank. The new cost is the original cost + 200%\nincrease. Then we convert that back to units by dividing the new cost by\nthe new cost per unit. The new units is the number that we get, and\nthat will be the number of units that John used in the new tank. We\nthus get 2000 + ((200 + 400)/2) and we get 200 * 5 = 1000. So, the new\ncost is 160 * 5 = $800. This is more expensive than the old way of doing\nit was $800 * 80 * 500 = $400.\n\n### Response\nJohn bought the extra tank after the price of fuel went up\n25% and he went to refuel and was charged by the cost plus\nthe 25% increase.

But the truth is there are many possible places, as the plastic things might be stored in a cabinet somewhere else in the house, or they might simply be thrown into a garbage dump outside the house (see diagram below).\n\n### Instructions:Write your response on the lines below.\n\n### Expected Solution\n\nThe answer is E. Garbage Dump. A person with children might have kids toys in a garbage dump if the child or children did not like the toy or if it broke.  The toys might also get thrown away if the kids outgrew it or do not play with it anymore. If the garbage dump got filled with old toys they might be thrown away or recycled.\n\n#### \n\n### Rationale:\nThe answer is E Garbage Dump\nA person with children (i.e. an adult is likely to have children's toys) might have kids toy in a garbage dump if they outgrew it, if they got bored of it and if it was broken.  They might also be thrown away if the kidds dont play with it anymore or if they are too small.\nIf the children play with the toy still it is likely to be in a cupboard or it might be thrown out if the family moved and would take the toy with them.  If there still hasnt been any use of the toy in the family the family might throw it out in the garbage dump to not collect dust and clutter.  This would be a common scenario in houses and apartments and it is unlikely that toys wouldnt be placed in any of the rooms which the child is likely to be in or around.  It is also likely that they would be placed in the kitchen and living room area where the family would usually gather.\nThis is why the options given are incorrect and the answer is likely to not be in any of these places which are mentioned (see picture below)\n\n### A:Cupboard\n\n#### \n#### \n\n#### \nA: Cupboard answer is incorrect.

Then, at age 11 my parents divorced and moved out to the country to be closer to my father who worked for the government building the road network in our area. With my dad and brother I moved in with my grandparents. 7 years later I started college in a city near the coast.

(2) In large cities throughout the world, many people often commute to their workplaces via mass transit; therefore, there may be a large number of people that transit through the station at any given moment. (3) The station's ventilation system is designed to disperse fumes generated by the public's combustion of fossil fuels within the train that they are riding to get to their destination. (4) There is no guarantee that an individual's respiratory system will clear air that has been in contact with other many people's respiratory systems. (5) Therefore, one could find air within a mass-transit train station that may have been breathed by other people.\n\n\n### Input (1):In what place could you not find air that has been recently breathed by only a small few people? Choices: A: house B: school C: bedroom D: gym E: office\n\n### Response (1):B: school\n\n### Input(2): In most schools, the ventilation system is designed around providing fresh, clean air into the classrooms. Thus, the fresh incoming air may have been recently inhaled by children within the classroom or hallway area. (3) Furthermore, many schools in developed countries have installed an air filtering system, which captures microbes and other airborne particles and releases recycled air back into the classroom. (4) As the ventilation system is programmed to only expel filtered air into every classroom, one may conclude that the air breathed by students during a school day cannot be as polluted as the air in other areas.

{"text": "The best choice is answer B: newspaper.  The mail carrier leaves the newspaper on the doorstep because it usually rains during morning hours.  Additionally, the newspapers are placed in large paper boxes, making them easier to spot and pick up than regular letter envelopes.  The answer choice E: mailbox is incorrect because although most people place their mail straight in the mailbox, the carrier still opens the box each time to ensure nothing is misplaced.  The answer choice A: front door is incorrect since the carrier only delivers to the front door of the house.  Lastly, the carrier does not go into the house, so the answer choice C: post office is not the answer.\n\n#### The correct answer is D: package.\nAn explanation of this answer choice is that packages are usually delivered to the front of the house but not left on the doorstep.\nAnd the packages are placed in something called a \u2018porch box\u2019 or sometimes a mailbox if the delivery is right in front of the porch box.\nAnd that would make the best choice answer C: Post office unlikely because mail carriers don\u2019t usually open front door delivery mail boxes to deliver and collect packages.\n\n#### The incorrect answer choice is A: front door.\nIf a postman delivers to the front of a particular house it\u2019d be very unlikely for them to leave something on that house\u2019s doorstep. They\u2019d more likely put it in a porch box or mailbox.\nAnd that\u2019d be an instance where it might rain or sleet and there would still be an envelope in a mailbox that had been left for that house.\n\n\n#### The incorrect and irrelevant answer choice is B: newspaper.\nThe fact that somebody might find the newspaper in the doorstep would NOT be enough to justify choosing B: Newspaper since there are a lot of other factors that come into play.\n\n\n#### Incorrect and irrelevant answer choice C: Post office.\nPost offices are open 24/7, meaning that it\u2019s likely for someone to find their letterbox opened at night.

This means that the total difficulty rating for the tasks in this task set is 1 less than the sum of the difficulties for every pair of tasks in this task set. So, for example, if a participant completes 1 task using 1 minute and rates the difficulty of that task with difficulty rating 200, then the difficulty rating of every other task set should be 201.\n\n#### Task Set #2:This task set contains only 1 task. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the difficulty rating of that task, and the sum of the individual task difficulty ratings should then be 1 higher than the difficulty rating of the task set.\n\n#### Task 1:The task difficulty rating is 5000.\n\n#### Tasks #2:The task difficulty ratings are 5200 and 5000, meaning that when aggregated, the difficulty of this task set is 5200 + 5000 - 1 = 10201.\n#### Task #3:The task difficulty rating of each is 4750, meaning that when both task difficulty ratings are aggregated, the difficulty rating of this task set is (4750 + 4750 - 1) = 9501.\n##### 5\nAnswer: 5\n\n```{=<\n\n```\n\n#### Tasks 4, 5, and 6:The difficulty rating of each of these tasks is 500, a total difficulty rating of 0 when aggregated.\n##### 0\nAnswer: 0\n```{=</\n\n```\n\n### Outputs: The outputs section contains any specific formatting that should be put into the output document, i.e., font type, font size, color, etc.\n\n### Example Output:\n```\n\n```\n\n| Inst", "answer": "D: soup"}

In the step 2, I started by converting 15 to 7.5, then 2+7.5, 9+7.5, and 10+7.5 and because one of the addends was higher than 9, I added the two until I got the 20. Also I know it works because this is what I ended up with every time I tried to find other possible answers.\n\n- I know that this is right and it", "answer": "D: agony"}

{"text": "The keys that were attached to the piano are black and white.\n\n### Rationales: If they were white, a purse would have to have a chain. If they were black, a chain would have to be attached to a purse. That means that they either were black and white or white and black. We are given that they were either black or white so that means the only combination they could be is black and white, so they were attached to a piano.\n\n### Answer choices: Black and white  B: cabinet, Purse D: chain, Piano \n\n### Test case:Input black purse with purse with keychain\n\n### Response  : A cabinet Piano\n\n### Rationale: The keychain has to be attached to the purse so the cabinet, purse, and piano all have to be used even just to find that the cabinet is not the place to attach the keychain to. Also, there is no other choice that fits the criteria because the cabinet says it is black and the purse says it is white so the only option that leaves the option of attaching the keychain to a purse is attaching it to the piano which is the only place to attach the key to. \n\n### Answer D  D:Chain piano \n\n### Input  : Black purse with backpack\n\n#### Testcase 1 :Input 1: Front pocket backpack    Testcase 2 :Input 1: Cabinet  \n\n### In the first test case the first letter is white because the purse is white so the keychain has to start from the purse, and from the cabinet the keychain can not go anywhere else since it says it is black, so the black purse with Backpack is the answer.\n\n### In  the second test case the first letter would be black because of the black purse which means the keychain has to be from the cabinet to piano which is the answer.\n### Testcase3:Input 1: Back pocket with purse with key chain  \n\n### Rationale Testcase3 is similar to Testcase1 but with the keychain being attached to the backpack instead\n\n### Testcase4:Input 1: Purse with cabient Testcase5:Input 1: cabinet with purse \n\n### Ratoinales:  Testcase4", "answer": "E: piano"}

Lets say each bicycle shop has a minimum of 5 employees, so the number of employees is 10,895. So, 2,17,0 shops have less or equal than 25 employees. Albuquerque has only 321,6000 workers.

{"text": "I think that they did not make the odd choice for the koalas display as they are Australian marsupials, which are endemic/native to Australia so there is no need for them to visit any other country to see other animals and the stuffed Koala has no idea about pandas and would never ever come and visit China. Moreover, they already know about pandas from their childhood books so they had no excuse to come and visit pandas in the wild in China. Also, the koala's diet does not consist of bamboo as pandas, and they only eat eucalyptus leaves. Lastly, the Australia is located in the other part of the world, so it's not in the other part of their continent but in the different part of planet, so visiting them would be a long trip and it would not be easy for them to get there. And then the koala would not experience anything new, they already know everything about pandas so no use in seeing them in real life. So none of the choices made sense because koalas are already familiar/familiarized with pandas or any other animals like bears from their childhood book/books which is more likely they had/have their own copies and they can read the story any time by themselves rather then having to get a real panda in a real zoo/museum. I personally think they made a stupid choice and they should not even call their museum zoo as it is not a proper zoo which has real wild animals in wild captivity, they just placed some fake animals in a museum. Therefore, my response is it doesn't make any sense for koalas to be at pandas' area so my answer is A.\n\n### Output:Your response is incorrect.", "answer": "B: bamboo grove"}

{"text": "C\n\n### Reason:B,C\n\n### Output:Milk is a living source full of nutrients and fat. If it is left undisturbed for a while, it goes through a process called fermentation, which creates a substance referred to as yogurt. Milk goes through this process because of the good bacteria that grows in it. If it is left to ferment again, mold will begin growing which also creates a substances called cheese. Because both of these substances are food products, it makes sense that fungi could grow and thrive in them. That is why people find fungus growing on cheese or yogurt.\n#### Fungi cannot grow on these milky products because they only grow in decaying matter.  Milk has no nutrition due to the fact it is still alive and is able to live on its own.  Fungi grow in decaying matter and need nutrients in order to thrive.  Without the decaying matter, Fungi will not be able to exist.\n#### Fungus cannot grow in a biology laboratory because all the samples are dead and cannot live off of themselves.  Fungus will need something to live off of and won't be able to thrive in the laboratory in its current state.  Even if the biology laboratory was to somehow keep their samples alive, Fungus can still not thrive in their environment.\n\n### Input : Eight friends have a party.

A 15 x 50 lot costing $80,000 will be located next to it, and another 12 x 50 lot will be built next to that. The cost to build the road to the subdivision is $14 per lineal foot. The final road width will be four feet wide. What is the cost of land in the subdivision and the cost to build the final road for the subdivision?\n\n### Demopreation\n####\nLet the cost of land be Pounds, and let the cost of construction of the road be Pounds.\nThe cost of a road 10 meters long is $14*10 = <<14*10=140>>140. The total cost of the road per a house is 140 / 4 = <<140/4=35>> 35. The final road width is 4 feet wide. Therefore, the cost of a house land including the cost of 100 feet of the road is $70000 + 35 = <<35+70000=70350>>70350\n\n#### Output:Land cost = $7000 = 70000", "answer": "B: mall"}

What should the average height of a woman wearing large shoes be?\n\n### Demystify:\nIn order to come up with a formula that will calculate the average height of a girl wearing large shoes, we need to consider: \n\n*  a girl's height before shoes\n*  shoes that come in numbers\n*  average height of a girl (in feet and inches) wearing large shoes\n\n#### 1. What girl's height is before she puts on shoes?\nConsidering a girl wearing large shoe size is 7.5-13. And according to the data on the web, \nthe average shoes size is 8 in the United States. We assume the average shoes size is between 8 and 9. \n```python\nimport psutil\nps = psutil.Process()\ncurrent_cpu_total_percentage = ps.cpu_percent() \n```\n  Let:\n\n*  h1 be the height (in inches) of a girl before putting on large shoes\nand\n\n*  s be the average shoe size between 8 to 9\n\nThen:\n\n```\nh1 = s * (ps.cpu_percentage / 100)\n```\nIt means that the greater the CPU usage on a computer, the greater the height of a girl we can think of that wears large shoes. \n\nHowever, when CPU percentage is less than or equal to 100 (the \naverage percentage), the formula is simplified as follows: \n```\nh1 is equal to s by default.\n```\nThe result is that if a CPU usage of 25% and a shoe size of 9 is used, the girl's height before putting on shoes is 1", "answer": "C: engine"}

The soap costs $6 each. How much did Adam pay for his liquid soap?\n\n\n\nRationales: To answer the question, you must find the amount of money that Adam spent on his liquid soap. We will use the method of the 10% error and use the $ sign to eliminate two incorrect answers.\n\nTo eliminate the first choice, you can compare it to the amount of money that was spent on all three containers combined. The amount of money that was spend on all three containers was 186 dollars. Since this amount of money is less, you can eliminate 61 which is not the amount of money that he spent on the liquid soap.\n\nTo eliminate 66, you must compare it to a 10% error. You can also eliminate 76, you can do this by making a 10% change to 66+66+66. If you make a 10% increase to 66+ 66 + 66, you can eliminate 80 dollars, because it is over the money that was spent on the liquid soap, which was 66 dollars not 80 dollars. Another option would be to compare 80 with 66, 66 dollars was spend on the liquid soap. Then, you would have 53 dollars left over.\n\nTo eliminate all incorrect answers, you must eliminate 73. You can eliminate it by comparing it with 10% error or you can eliminate it by eliminating all the incorrect answers that you can see for yourself.\n\n\n\nOutput: Correct Answer \n\n#### 66\n\nInput: James goes to the gym four days a week and lifts weights on three of those days.

To find how many units there are to the left, you can subtract K-2 from 1, since K = K - 5, and 2-2 = 0.\n2-2 = 4 means 2-4 = 0.\n#### 4\n\n### Rationales:\nWhen K = K - 6, J = K - 5 and K = K - 4, J = K - K. From these equations, we know that K - (K - 4) = J\nSince we know that K = 1, we can solve the equation to get K-7 = J, and since we know that J = J - 3, J = J - 4. We then know that K-7 = K - 4. Since we know that K = J, we know that K-7 is the same thing as J+7. We can solve the equation from here to get 8 = J + 7.

{"text": "D (fatigue)\n### Question:\nInput: I'm sure that for the longest time I've been spelling \"definitely\" and \"defiantly\" incorrectly. For ages I've been spoon-feeding students the correct spelling in class, and yet I've never checked to see if I was actually doing that right for myself. But it's definitely a defiant situation! (Incidentally, that's my first post!)\nRationales:\n1. In this example, the word \"defiantly\" is misspelled, and \"definitely\" is spelled correctly.  The correct spelling is in the middle of the line and is different than the misspelled word \"defiantly\".\n2. In this example, \"definitely\" is misspelled.  The correct spellings are in the line above and below \"definitely\".\n3. In this example, it is possible to be both right and wrong at the same time.  The word \"thought\" is used twice.  There are different definitions of \"definite\":\n     1. Something that exists or is thought to exist in reality\n     2. Firm, especially in opinion or belief <was definite in her answers> <guns are not yet definite as to purpose>\n     3. Having or showing firmness of opinion or belief; certain\n     4. Conclusive; absolute <a definite answer>\n     5. Free from doubt or question; positive <a definite decision>\nWhile the word \"definitely\" is properly spelled in the example above, if you substitute \"definite\" where it is in the example above, you will see that its intended definition is different than the 4th definition, which is where the example is using it.\n\n### Answer: definitely", "answer": "E: anger"}

Give your answer in a decimal.\n\n### Answer : x represents the years in school for each student.\n\nA total of 56 students passed the exams in the two years they were in primary school. This represents the number in the second column, 31 students.\nFor the two years they were at secondary school, 75 students passed. This represents the value in column 3, 46.\nWhen a student passes exams in secondary school, it is possible for them to continue their education. The table shows the number of students who continued with their education for five years.  Of these, 44 students passed. This represents 1.8 students for each year of secondary school that the student spent, the value in column 1. When you multiply the number of years the student spent in secondary school by 1.8, you get the number 83.2 for the sum of those numbers.\nSo the sum of the years each student spent studying at primary and secondary school is 83.2.\n\n### Part C :\n\n### Question : How many students spent only two years in primary school and did not continue in secondary school?\n\n### Answer: Only 54 students spent only two years of primary school and did not go to secondary school for at least one year.

{"text": "The correct response for the question is (A) go shopping.\n\n### Rationale: The rationale is that (A) go shopper is the correct response because if the person is known to buy gifts most likely they have a lot of extra money that they are spending on others, not to mention they are buying more than one gift and that takes some work, so they are often found in stores. In addition to this, people generally shop around, and a person shopping frequently would more than likely be found in stores, so (A) go shoeper\n\n### Input\nA: go shopper B: generous C D E: gift buyer F: money maker\n\n###  Rationale\nThe rationale is that (F) money maker is the correct response because gift buyer is a person who buys gifts, but generous is not necessarily a person who spends, but rather a person who is more than willing to spend money to help others, and gift buyer in this question is not just generous but is specifically a person who is willing to spend their money on gifts. It is also important to notate that the question specifically describes someone who buys presents for others, so (F) is better than (D) since (F) is referring to present buyer.\n\n### Input \nA: go shoppen B: generous C F D E: gift buyen G: money maker\n        \n### \nRationale: \n\n### Response :\nGo Buyer\n### Rationale :\nIf the buyer is known to buy presents for other,  which has shown that he is generous, he/she would be called a gift buyer \nIf the buyer has an extra money , he/she  would be called a money maker\n\n        \n### Input  A: go purchaser B C F D E:  gift buyer G: money maker H:  generous  I: Presents  buyer\n\nAnswer :\n\n### Rationales\nIf the buyer in the question is generous, he or she  would buy presents for other person\nIf has extra money, he or she would be called a money earner.\n\n### Response \nD: the gift buyer has an extra and more money than the H: shopper.", "answer": "B: generous"}

The number of visitors is growing: if it continues increasing at this rate, when was the first year in which more than 100000 visitors came to the park?\nRationales for a demo: You can calculate the year when the visitors numbers reached 1000 in the following way:\n\nyear_with_1000: 1000+average_rainfall/10 = <<1000+82/10=820>>820\n\nTherefore, it took more than 820 years for the park to break 100,000 visitors. To find the year the park broke 100, 000 visitors, this year + 820: 820+<<820+10000=1820>>1820\n\nIf this is how I came to my answer, the year would be:\nyear_with_more_than_10000_visitors: 1820+average_rainfall/10 = <<820+averaging_rainfall/124=65>>65\n```\n**Input and demo of final answer:**\nInput: The average rainfall in California park is 101.

At the start of the race, she was so nervous that she could hardly eat a square of chocolate. At the finish of the race her nerves were completely gone.\n\n## Analysis: To solve this short answer question, we first need to understand what the question is asking:\n\n### 1) What do we know after the question?\n\n### 2) How do we know what we know?\n\nAlice is very nervous at the start of the race and she is not very nervous at the end.\n\n### 3) Write a detailed explanation of your thinking process:\n\n- She is nervous because she has never run a half-marathon before. She knows that to run the half-marathon, she would need to push her physical limit physiologically and she starts to get nervous when she realizes she is pushing that limit.\n- At the finish of the half-marathon which she has never done before, her nerves are gone (no longer nervous).\n\n### 4) What is true and right in your explanation (R):\n\n- R: Alice was only nervous at the beginning of the half-marathom, because she had never done it before and had no idea what it took to push her to her limit. As such, she did not know what needed to be pushing and to what level the limit it was. It is also why she could not eat a square of chockolate. She was too nervous.\n\n\n#### Question Mark:\n\nRationale:\nC: She is not bored anymore because all that stress is no more, her body is used to the pushing and thus her body is no longer nervous.

What was the winning percentage of Elijha?\nOutput: 75%\n\n### Demotion:\nThis statement is correct since the probability to occur an event is equal to 1 / chance of this event to happen. So 6 matches / 8 matches probability to get a victory is equal to 75%.\n\n### Example:\nOutput: 70% (Since 6 matches / 9 matches) probability to get a victory.\n\n### Note:\nThe answer for Elijha is different because the probabilities of both events occurring is equal. Example, If there were another 4 games, Elijha won 4 matches he won 50% of the time.\nSo the win of 6 matches out of 8 matches is equal to 70%.\n\n### Revision:\n\n### Example\nOutput: 65% (Since 8 matches / 12 match) probability to get a win.\nSince we are told 6 matches / 12 matches, it will be: 6/(8+12). So 6 / ((8+12)/2) = 6/9 = 60/18 = 3/6 = 2+1 = 3.

Now the number of people in the band is 60% of the number of people who came. How many people came to the music festival?\"\n### Answers: A. 104424\n### Explanation:The original population can be represented by the letter n and the total group after the large group leaves can be represented by b. 1892 * n = 11820 and 180 * b = 9. So, b = 9 and n = 117320.\n### Then we take the number of bands and multiply by 60% to get a band that is 60% smaller. This gives us 90% of 117330 = 107040. So, 60% of 107038 = 64.28, and so the number of people who left the band was 64.\n### Subtracting all of that equals 106876 which is 104404, the answer in the question.\n\n## Input: He had to cut five pieces each four feet in length and one piece eight feet in length to make a desk.

Choices: A: see work.  \n\n### Demystification:\nDemystification, in mathematics, is one of the three general techniques used to solve linear systems of differential equations in physics. In demystification, the dependent variables are set equal to each other, which gives the equation to solve for the independent variables (usually time). After solving for the unknown variables in a system of equations, an extra constant of integration is added to the equation of motion. However, for the case of solving ordinary differential equations, another method of solving a system of differential equations is to choose one equation and substitute it into each of the other equations, so as to solve all three for the same constant.  The solutions then can be algebraically transformed into the original form.  This method was proposed by John C.

On the left was a room whose number is 235.

I have no idea how to do this.\n\n### Rationales : Let's try for 80 feet corridor and find out floor 5 to walk about 1048 ft. That is the total path. We know the distance from floor 5 to the gym room and another one to pass the gym room and the distance between the gym room and last room. So, let me just say 235 is the final room. \nThe total distance from floor 5 is 8+4+4*2=72. That's just about the half because we know there's something about 80*0.5=40 ft. But we have 1048 + 72 + 12*2 = 1286 in the problem.\nFYI we can use 1200 ft so that the math is easier. I got the result with the following math:\n1286 + 8*2 = F + 80 = 1200 + 80 =1280\n1280/2 = F = 640\n640/2 = 8*2 = 16 ft of floor 5 walk\nThat is almost exact in the problem and it's hard to tell but that can be enough.\n\n#### 616\nAnswer:", "answer": "C: injury"}

Unfortunately, the criminal justice system as a whole does not operate as smoothly as it could and should. For example, in many cases, police officers do not give enough information to lawyers, so lawyers cannot provide much in the way of defense.\n\nCriminals often do not have enough money to hire lawyers who will fight for them. This is one reason why so many criminals plead guilty, even if they are innocent.

If 48.5 of the shirts had buttons and the average buttons on those 48.5 shirts weighed 0.4 grams, how much weight did the buttons on those 44.5 shirts without buttons weigh?\n\nResponse: We need to figure out the weight of the buttons with out figuring out the shirts with out buttons.\n\nSo we know the total for the shirts that had buttons the weights were 48.5 * 0.4 = <<48.5 *0.4=19.6>>19.6 grams\nSince the total for shirts with buttons were 19.6 + 48.5 = <<19.6+48.5=70>>70.\nWe want to figure out the weight for the shirts with without buttons.\nSince we know theirs is a total of 245.5 shirts the average is 245.25/245.5 = <<245.2==238>>238\n\nSo the total weight for the buttons is 70 * 238 = <<70*238=16,660>>16,66 grams.", "answer": "B: sporting event"}

Some of the worst accidents are reported to happen on icy roads and often the accidents result in fatalities. According to the Minnesota State Patrol (MN-SP), in the past, the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) is the only authority responding to any car crashes. However, MnDOT also cannot offer the level of assistance other agencies would provide. Some of the emergency response agencies would assist in other emergencies that occur on the same road. The MN-SP had to direct a car accident to another agency that already provides emergency care and other assistance if the victims were injured.

But the answer is DELIMITER which means to mark off a boundary. What's the mistake? How can the word DELIMITATION be removed?\n\n### Rationales and Answer:\nThe word DILIMITATION has no space between D and I.  I, though, think it should have one.\nHow to Fix this:\n* Take the 'I' out of DILIMITATION.\n* Add space between the 'I' and the first 'L'.  Also, add space after the first 'L'.\n* Write a letter that is similar to the letter 'I' which means the next character is 'L'.  I think you will discover what I meant.\n\nAnswer: DELIMITATION is incorrect because there is no space between the 'I', the letter the word ends in.\nTo fix this: Write 'DILIMITATION' without a space between the I and all the letters after it.\nThis word also sounds very close to 'DELIMITER'. So the two words may have gotten mixed up.\nCorrect the word: 'DILIMITATION'.\n\n###Input:  Tom is at work and wants to know something about the work day. Tom decides to find the average temperature in the office. Every hour, Tom puts 17 degrees of Fahrenheit in a cup. Tom thinks there must be a simple way to calculate the average.  Do you know how Tom should calculate the average temperature?\n\n### Answer:  I think Tom should put each number in a cup, but each separate cup should hold more than one.  I would say, that each cup should hold 17 degrees * the number of total times that 17 degrees is being put in and out of the cups.  That should be 17/hours. For example, if the work day is 8 hours, each cup would need to hold 17/8 so each cup needs to hold 2.125 * 17 degrees F for a total of 35.25 degrees in each cup.  Add up all the temperatures and divide 35.24 by 8 cups = 4.", "answer": "A: few people"}

One ream of paper is usually less the or equal the cost of 512 sheets of paper and a ream of paper is 500 sheets.  So the number of sheets are 512. The price of a pound of scrap was 5 cents per pound. 154 can of paint at 3.25 each is 486.17.\n\n(512+486.15-19.9) / 154 = 0.216\nThe difference is to make the number of 154 can paint after subtracting the cost of goods.\n\n### Output:  0.216 cans of oil paint", "answer": "E: solar system"}

Only when they are on a different, separate duty will they actually be out and about.\n\n#### D: college\n\nCollege campuses tend to have a higher level of security than regular high school campuses.

{"text": "Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\n## Description of Input:\nThis is a set of nested arrays like\n\n### Instructions:\nAnswer the following multiple choice\n\n### Rationale:\nThe answer below is my thought process for solving this task. Please feel free to critique and correct me.\n\nIn the input, there is a list of arrays, each containing 5 integers. In one of the arrays is the number 103. Let\u2019s take the time series of integers and create another time series of the number of integers that contains 103. Now, in every one of the arrays, we know where 103 takes place. Let\u2019s call this index the number of the array where 103 occurs. From this array, we can just take the indices directly before and after it and insert the index of the array where 62 occurred. This is the same logic we used to find the first 103 in the list. The same logic could be used to find 105. Let\u2019s say 103 occurs 12 times, then 105 will occur another 201 times. After creating a list of these numbers and putting it in chronological order, a new list of numbers will be created. Each element could be the number of integers on the list that contain 103. The numbers for each array can then be combined into one list. Let\u2019s say there are 13 arrays. If each array has numbers that are at chronological order, then an easy formula we can use to create the list of numbers is (((Total# integers-0)*(Total#arrays-1)/100)/11). Let\u2019s just call this (T*A)-0/11. For example, if one of the arrays has 10 integers and another array has 100 integers, the formula for this array would be (10*(100-1)-0)/11). If each array is only 5 integers, the formula for the array with 62 in the middle would be (100*49-0)/11. I haven\u2019t figured out how to create these formulas in Python. At every iteration, we take the formulas and multiply it with the number in every position of the array. Then, we just take the sum. I have not been able to solve", "answer": "D: frequent"}

{"text": "E\n\nAnswer: \n\n### Instructions:Answer each of the following questions.\n\n### Input\n\n```\nInput: A scientist conducts an experiment where she changes the direction of the flow of a river. After the change, no water flows downstream. In the direction the flow changes, water flows. Calculate the direction and amount of flow for the river.\nRationales\nWe have to figure out how to change the direction the river flows. Remember, no water flows down stream so the flow has to go somewhere. So it has to turn and go up stream. After we figure that out,\nThe flow of the river goes up the other river after it is changed from down to up.\nIf any direction of the flow is 25% then the rate will be 0.25 * 0.5 = <<25*0.5=12.5>>12.5.\nThe rate after the change is 30/3 = <<30/3=10>>10.\nSo there is a %0.375 change in rate of the flow.\nWe can calculate how much will come down and how much will go up.\nIf you put 400/325 = <<400/35=0.117>>0.117 gallons per minute down stream and how many gallons go up the stream we get the answer of 118*0.117=<<12*0.11=1.35>>1.35 gallons per minute.\nSo the rate of flow is how much gallons go down the stream in a minute.\nThe rate is 1.35/1 = <<1.35/0.70-70=0.1-0.01325>>0.11325 rate.\nSo after figuring out the rate we should just plug in 0.1135 into the 27500 gallon per minute formula to get the answer.\nThat is 0.11 x 275 = <<275*0.1=27.5>>27,5 gallons per minute\n\n\n```\n\n### Instuction:There might be time gaps in-between the question set.

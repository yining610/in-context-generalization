We first take away A. So to eliminate A:\n\nTherefore, A is not the correct answer, because we know from the question that **\"Sam was against Allison\u2019s decision\"**.\n\nWe then check the other choices to see which one isn't the opposite.\n\n**\"Opposite\" means we don't see Allison's decision as the same as Sam's decision. We see Allison's as different.\n\n**Combination** means:\n\n\"Sam was Allison's decision\" (or was combined with Allison).  \n  Sam was **not** Allison's decision\n\nThe next part to this problem is just as important as the part that tells us to eliminate A. This helps us understand the answer choices.\n\n#### How we interpret B:\n\n**B:** \"being for\" _and_ \"away from\" does not seem like the answer. We need to see Joe's decision as opposite to Allison's before we can conclude that he is \"for\". This is because this question is asking about Joe's opinion towards the decision. Therefore, we need to see if what Joe's decision is.\n\n#### How to eliminate options that aren't for:\n(We can take away any that are the same)\n\n\"For the decision\", \"not for the decision\", \"doesn't know\". These don't work because Joe could be \"for it\", \"for it, but against\". (for it is good, but opposed). They can't be eliminated as false.\n\n#### More about B:\n\nSince B is \"being for Allison's decision\", in order for it to be true, Allison's decision would have to be the same as Joe's (or be combined with Joe's).\n\n#### How we get rid of B:\n\nJust to summarize. We see that the question is specifically asking us if Joe is \"for the decision\", and that we need to eliminate the options that aren't. We need to eliminate any that aren't for the decision, which means eliminating the option that the person \"for the decision", "answer": "A: being for"}

For example, estimate the number of steps that need to be added to your deck outside to the amount of time it will take to paint these steps to get a ballpark figure.\n#### Example:\nThere are 426 steps needed to be painted.\nLet's estimate 5 steps/minute to get 426/5 = <<426/5=85>>85 minutes to finish this project.\n#### Example 2:\nI would estimate the amount of people at the party to be around 200 since most are coming. This would lead me to estimate it would take at least 8 minutes to pick out someone for every group round of the game.\n#### Example 3:\nUsing estimation, we can estimate 70% of the population have the measles and I can get it from 7/10 of the population who have it to get the ball park number of 14/100 or 14/1,000. I can estimate about half of these have the mumps and use the estimates to get 700/150 = 800/100, or about 800 mumps in total in this outbreak.\n#### Example 4:\nEstimating would help me decide whether it will be a good idea to pick up my friends in Florida because I am coming home today after 3 months. So if 1/10 of people who go to Florida come home with Covid-19, that's about 1/10 * 12,000 people, or about 1,200 Covid-19 cases this year due to Florida travelers.\n#### Example 5:\nI can estimate how many hours of homework I will get this month.\nI know it will be at least 3 hours of homework per week, so 3/52 = 3/12 = 1/4 or a little more than 1 hour of homework 4 weeks per month.\nSo", "answer": "C: large city"}

How many books does the classroom math teacher have?\n\n### Rationales:If the library has 13 books more than the classroom math teacher, the library has 73 books. The classroom math teacher has 60 books more than the school library. The library doesn's have twice as many books, so the library has 75 books. In the classroom math teacher classroom, students are 2 times as many as in the school library classroom. The students in the library classroom don't have as many books as the students in the classroom math teacher's classroom. Therefore, the students in the library don't have twice as manny books as the students in classroom math teacher' classroom. The book-to-student ratio in the classroom math is 4 books for each student.

{"text": "B- Militar\n\n### Correct answer:\nB- Military\n\nThe woman checked her bag, so she must have been heading to somewhere where she was checking a bag. There is no way someone would check a bag to a destination such as a garbage can or military or garage. Furthermore, she would not check a bag to a military, considering we are at an airport, an airport in a place where a military usually stays, such as airports. And if we consider airport rules and regulations, checking a bag to a military wouldn't make sense. Thus, the correct answer is D; the woman was headed to the military.\n\nYou need to understand, though, that the woman would not be headed outside of the airport and still check a bag at the same time. The bag was checked at the counter where tickets are bought. That makes sense for a checked bag because checked bags are placed on a conveyor belt to be loaded on the airplane and then dropped at an airport on the other side. We will call it the baggage claim. The baggage claim for the airport is a large hall, usually located on the left side of the main terminal. Once you buy a ticket online/ by phone, the airline will email you to a confirmation of the flight. Usually, there is an airport close to the hotel, so you can get back to your hotel, but if there is no airport close to, then it's probably better to book a transfer to the airport, as there may be a large distance between the hotel and airport, and it might cost you twice more than transferring to the airport. Another option is that taxis can bring you to an airport, and then you can take a bus or a train to get to another destination. However, if you are planning to stay longer, it's recommended that you take a bus or bus; it's cheaper.", "answer": "E: airport"}

This result can be answered using the following conditions:\n\nIf a garage had four cars, the answer would not be likely since only two cars are considered.\nIf a garage is one in which the only car is a van, then the answer would likely be yes, since the van can have more than one seat in the back.\nThe answer is likely because the garage has two cars and the car has more than one seat.\nIt's likely that garages have more than one bed.\nIf the garage had only one seat, the answer would be unlikely.

Choices back and B back and forward mean the same thing, and choice E \"not to go\" does not make sense.

One day, her nephew came over to visit her. He was surprised that she was begging as the eldest member of the village. He decided to take her to his wife's hut to live with them. His wife was sympathetic to the old lady. However, his children and his wife's parents did not like the idea of the old lady coming to their house. They said the old lady would remind them of their parents. One evening, when they were fast asleep, the children's mother entered their mother's room. She woke her up and said, \"I was unable to sleep earlier because of your grandparents' wailing. We had never seen such tears from our parents for years. I did not like to hear that cacophony of wails. What was your grandmother doing here? In that case, tell your father that this should be the last time my parents come over.\" On hearing the words, her husband, the old lady's nephew, called out to her before she had left her mother's room. He asked his wife to come out of her mother's room immediately. His wife came out and said, \"I know your mother came to meet me. I knew she would come to meet me. But who is this old woman here?

It shows that one has a plan, knows what one has to do, and executes. As for the person who is great at succeeding at being hateful is also not that different in his/her thinking. It shows the hatred they feel for others who try to stop them. To be great at something you need to be dedicated to it at all cost and if you're hateful or hurt by the people who don't support you, then hatred for them is what makes you keep trying harder and reach your goals.\n\\\n\n### Solutions to instruction\n\nThere are three steps for solving this:\n1 - In order for luck to play a big role, every step of the way has to be in your favor.

{"text": "B\n\n### Input A\nInput: The first 100 largest numbers are positive. The next 20 largest numbers are negative. You want to know the 300 largest number. What can you do?\n\n### Response\nWrite a function that accepts as an argument an integer representing the desired largest number. Return an integer.\nYour function should have the form ```longest_number(x)``` where `x` is the number. It should return the 300th largest number (or, in other words, the positive number that is 100 larger than 200).\n\n### Demostration\nYour function should accept the largest possible number, so the function should be defined like this:\n```\nlongest_number(Longest Num)\n```\n\nWith this format, your function should also return a positive number. With these concepts in mind, your function should look something like this:\n```java\npublic static int longest_number(int x)\n    {\n        if(input is too large to evaluate)\n            {\n            return -21;\n            }\n\n    if(x <= 300)\n        {\n        return x;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n        for (int i = 300; i < x; i++)\n        {\n        if(i > 200)\n            return i;\n        i++;\n        }\n        return -21;  \n        }\n    }\n```\nThe loop should loop through the numbers starting at 300. If the number has a value greater than 200 than it should return that number. Otherwise, the loop should continue and the function should return -21. However, if you get an integer error when running the program with a number greater than 201, you can simply add an if statement to check for ```if(x >200)  ``` and ```if(x > 300)  ```.\n\n### Demos:\nAnswers are in **bold** text.\n\n- Create a function that returns the most recent date.

If team d took the longest, and Team B took almost the same time, what team's time was nearly the same as Team B's?\n### Response --Team C\n\n### Response -- Team C\n\n### RATIONALE -- The correct answer is Team D. The clue to the next question indicates to multiply the 22 miles by 10 teams.  So if team d ran 10 miles, they ran one sixth of the total. Similarly, team a ran 6 miles, which was 1/6th the total of 22 miles.\n\n### This is the same as the same as 22 miles, except each team ran 1/6 of the total, respectively.\n\n### For team c, (2/3) (2/15) is the reciprocal, so 2 * reciprocal is (2/3) * 15. Team c traveled 7.5 miles. This equals only about 9 miles traveled, or 3/6.  This is still less than the mile traveled by Team B\n\n### So, the correct answer is Team D\n\n### Input : John and Mark shared a box of Oreos.

{"text": "Choice: A\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\n## Example:\nInput: A family buys a large cake for a birthday party. They cut the cake into 8 equal slices and gave each slice to his guests. But, the family did not have enough cake left for the last slice. What fraction of the cake was left?\n**Rationales:** The family cut the cake into ___ slices. Fractions are divided into two groups: the numerator is the top number like the denominator. The numerators for these fractions are 8/8, 7/8, 6/8, 5/8, 4/8, 3/8, 2/8, and 1/8 respectively.\nThe denominators are the bottom number, like the numerators. The denominators for these fractions were 8. The denominators for the above fractions are 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1, respectively. The bottom number is less than the bottom number.\nThe last fraction (1/8) will be the bottom number because ___ slices have been cut off the top of the cake and only ___ slices remain. Since 35/43 divided by 8 gave 1/(8 * 43) then 1/(8 *43) \uff1d 1/(8 *35). Thus, 1/1=(1 *1)=1 and thus, the answer is 1.\n#### 1\nAnswer: 1\n\n### Output:2.5 gallons of fruit punch was distributed at the school party. Marlee drank 5/6 of the punch.

A fire alarm is a sound that warns people when there is a fire. The narrator is lucky because there was a false alarm. So it should not have bothered him. The reason why the narrator is not able to get out of the house could be because the door is stuck, since the fire alarm is too much to handle for him, but there is a chance that he is stuck because the door could be face the south that way people would be able to get into the house even if he is at home, so it is probably that he would be in trouble and scared of losing his house, he would be so frightened that he would just let himself fall, and then he could just have to stay at home.\n\n### Input 1: Samantha was 17 at her birthday party.

Maya is the same age as Samantha, which means that Maya is older 2 years than Ava.\n\n### Response2: Input 2: Sparky weighed: 48 + 2 = 50 pounds Buttons weighed:26 + 2 = 28 pounds Total weight of their pets: 74 + 74 = 148 pounds Sparky", "answer": "C: winter storm"}

What can you do to make the best of things?\nRationales:(A): Disparagement implies bad-mouthing or putting down someone. Disparagement is not always bad, though. It can refer to a teacher disparaging a student's assignment. In most instances in academic situations, however, disparagement is an example of poor or indiscrete behavior.\n\n(B): Ignoring someone or some behaviour is not always bad either. Ignoring might refer to ignoring a person on the street for whatever reason.\n\n(C): Contumely and disparagement are the two words most closely related to the idea of disparagement. Contumely is a formal word for contempt or scorn. It can also refer to the feelings of another person with regard to you. This word is best left to Shakespearean literature or legal writings, however.\n\n(D): Contumely is the closest synonymous choice to both the \"ignoring\" and \"disparagement\" response. What if someone ignored or bad-mouthed you, but it didn't affect your self-esteem?

The total area of Alaska is 665,380 sq miles. Alaska is larger than Rhode Island 583,741 sq miles. The capital of Alaska is Juneau, which is smaller than Providence in Rhode Island.\nRationales: Rhode Island is 784 sq. km smaller than Alaska\nThe states area (in sq miles) = 1589 sq. miles + 665380 sq. miles + 784 - 583740 miles = Alaska's total area\nRhode Island has 1589 - 1589/Rhode Island's total area = <<1589 -1589/9> =61 sq. miles\nSo Rhode Island's total population is 1589 + 61 = <<1587>>61 sq. miles.\nThe capital of Alaska is in the largest city in Alaska.\nJuneau is 719 square miles.

{"text": "The correct item is a spinning wheel. The definition of spinning wheel is a large, heavy machine with two legs made of iron (or steel) that a person uses to turn wool into thread or yarn.\n\n### Justification:The definition of what is a large, heavy (machinery item that is used to do any of various heavy or dangerous tasks or services). A spinning wheel is a heavy machine and it is used to spin yarn and has two legs. Therefore, it is a spinning wheel (machine).\n\n### Input I: The number of 8\u2019\u2019 tires on a tractor is 12. How many tires, with both front and back wheels, does the tractor have?\n\n### Rationales: The number 12 means that the whole of 12 is divided by two. This means that the number is 16 and that it can be divided into 8 and 8 since 16 divided 8 or 8 divided 8.\n\n### Input II: Fourteen people entered the restaurant for dinner. There were 3 times as many people in the restaurant as served at each dinne. How many people were in each group that ate at the restaurant?\n\n### Dem: The number 3 means that 3x equals 1. Therefore, 2 x 14 = 28.\n\n## Answer 4\n### Rational:In question 1, I am given the information that 12 people were in the restaurant and 3 people were served at each dinner. Therefore, if 3 times is 1, then 1/3 is 1. Therefore, the number of people in the restaurant is 16. The number of guests in the restaurant is 3/4 of 16. This is calculated by multiplying 3/4 times 12 which equals 12 because when multiplying a fraction by a whole number, you multiply the numerator by the denominator and simplify.\n\n### Rationale 2: A number line is defined as a line that ranges from a negative number to positive infinity with intervals divided by zero.

I measured 21 centimeters, and since a circle is 360 degrees-that's how many degrees makes a whole cirlce-that makes one degree equal to 1.8 centimeters. So, 21=21/1.8.

{"text": "* C. dreamworker\n\n### Rationales:When we are awake and when we are asleep, we construct and comprehend our experiences. However, when we are asleep in our dreams, we don't control or comprehend our experiences in the same way as when we are awake. There are no dream workers available then that can help us understand what is going on since we are the only ones who can do so.\n\n### A. Reality\nWe are not in control of constructing our experiences in the same manner when we dream. For us, reality is our objective sensory experience (the way we experience the world with our senses).\nThere are no dream workers who can help us comprehend and control our experiences such as when we are conscious. We construct the experiences of what is occurring in our lives while we are asleep. We comprehend the experiences we had in dreams or when we are awake by interpreting what occurred in our interactions/interpretations with other people and in our environment as well as our knowledge of various fields.\n\n### B. Imagination\nThe consciousness with which we interpret the occurrences is called \"imagination\". A human's mind's creative process, as well as cognitive ability and thinking, are all part of imagination.\nIn order to construct, comprehend, and control our experiences, we make use of the capacity of the imagination.\nThe experiences you have during your dreams or when you are awake can be comprehended and controlled by using imagination.\n\n### D. Nightmare\nWhen we are awake, we are in our waking state of consciousness.\nEven while we are in our dreams or sleeping, we are still not completely unaware of what is happening around us.\nWe simply don't control our experiences in this state of awareness. When we are asleep, it is called \"sleeping\". It is a state of semi-consciousness.\nWe can only comprehend and control our waking state of experience.\nTherefore, dream workers (dreams) are not accessible in a sleep state.\n\n### E. Awake\nOne of the four stages of life is awake. We are not in a state of suspended consciousness as when we are in our dream, but rather we are fully conscious like how we normally experience life when", "answer": "A: reality"}

You have five minutes to complete the task.\n\nQuestion 1. A. If my daughter and I are the same height, how much shorter than I am is my daughter? B. If my dog is twice my height and my daughter is the same length as my dog, how tall is my daughter? Explanation: I am twice my daughter's height and my dog is my height. My daughter must be twice my height and twice my dog's height.\n\nAnswer: A. My daughter is x/0.5 ft + 0-x ft tall, and I am 0.5 ft - x ft tall. Therefore I am 0.75 ft tall and my daughter is -x/0.5 ft - 0.75/2 tall, which simplifies down to 0.85/.25 ft tall, which simplifies to 0.34/0.25 ft. I am taller by x/0.25 feet, or x/0.2 - x/0.2, which simplifies to -x. If x is 0.34 feet, then my daughter is 34/0.5 of my height, which is 6.8 feet +/-, meaning my daughter is shorter than I am by less than 0.5 feet. This confirms my answer from beforehand: my daughter is x/0 + 0-x, which simplifies to x/0 + 34/0, which simplifies to just 34 +/- 0. Which means my daughter is shorter than me by 34/2 +/- 0, or about 17/4 +/- 0, which simplifies again to just 17 +/- 0, so my daughter is xt shorter than me by less than 0 feet.\n\nQuestion 2. A.

{"text": "Where was the paper notice likely to be found on a house? Answer: C: classroom\n\n### Explanation: Paper notice could be left on the front door, conference, classroom, refrigerator, and suitcase of the house.\n\n### Expected answer: C\n\n### Rationale: In our everyday lives, we are often asked to complete a complex set of instructions. This task gives us an example of how we can break down a task into steps in order to complete it.\n\nIn this task, we are asked \u201cWhere is a paper notice that was likely to be left on the house?\u201d This question is worded in ways that are difficult to respond to effectively. However, we can approach this task by breaking it down into small steps. What are the different contexts for leaving or finding a paper notice? The contexts are:\n- front door\n- conference\n- classroom\n- refrigerator\n- suitcase\n\nWhich of these would be the most likely context or place to put a notice? After breaking down the question, we can answer this task more effectively.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the \u201cclassroom\u201d. This choice is because of the \u201crecently read books\u201d and a \u201chomework sheet\u201d are found at the \u201cclassroom\u201d.\n\n#### C\nAnswer: Classroom\n\n### Input\nWhat is the temperature of Earth\u2019s surface at the equator in degrees Fahrenheit?

Answer: B: 101 degrees Fahrenheit\n\n### Explantion\nThis is because of the equator is where the sun is the closest to the surface.\nEarth has a total temperature of 288 degrees fahrenheit; however, the temperature decreases with latitude and the temperature at the poles is approximately minus 80. Degrees Fahrenheit are the temperature of the equator on Earth.\n\n### Response Expected Answer:\nB\n\n### Expectation:\nThis question is for asking about the general information of a person.\n\n### Rationales:\n1.

(in a line) Then, take out each of the extra words that are not needed (would, need, and the). The only reason left is the need a coat if is cold which is grammatically incorrect because the word \"if\" only belongs in questions.

But Freddy did not call his family on New Year Eve with 31 minutes, so the answer is less than a dollar.\n\n###Question3:\n\nThe answer is the average days.We know that a day is more than 600, so a week has more than 60 days. So we can just subtract 5 with the question. We know that a week includes seven days and so there is more than six days left.\n\n###quesstion4:\n\nWe can simply see that the sales he could have are 5 because there is three groups of 3 and one group of 2. So the answer is 5.\n\n\n### Question5:\n\nIn total,the answer is 64 because to divide 14 to 3 for a box we get 6,2 for a big library of 24 books,2 for Cameron and 3 for Boris.So the answer is 6.\n\n###Quesstion6:\n\nIf there is about 4 ounces less,then there would be 22 ounces in a box,so 14-22 gives 7.Because the first box has 14, and the second box has 20 ounces less than that, then the third box includes only 14 ouncs.So the answer is about 14.\n\n###question7:\n\nWe can use D and E because we are going to read the local news and we are using the TV, so we only watch TV.So the answer is D and E", "answer": "D: web page"}

{"text": "A\nAnswer the following multiple choice questions. Input: Tapanga and... Input: Frederick is calling his family on... Input: Lawrence worked 8... Input:... Input: Ali had a stock... Input: Michael... Input: The question asks... Input: Nalani had... Input: Boris has... Input: There are... \n\n### Explanation of Answer\n\nThe question asks \"how many candies does Corei have?\" Therefore, 29 is the correct answer.\n\nThe question asks how much did Freddy spend on long distance calls. It does not specify what type of call this is, but we can assume that it is a local call. This is because it is referred to as a \"local\" call. \n\nWe have the equation 5c + 25c = x dollars. We have x - 5c = x - 25c. Because local = 5c and long distance = 25c. So we can solve for x. x = 30. This answer is correct because the problem states Freddy spent $10 dollars on his call. \n\nThe question asks when he is working, \"how many hours will he work each day if he works the same number of hours?\" This gives us the number of hours he worked on monday, which is 8, then subtracting that by the hours in the question which is 5, we get 3. Therefore, the answer is 3.\n\nThe question states that A and B represent the number of books sold. C refers to A - B or the number of books that where not sold. Therefore, the answer would be 600. \n\nThis answer is correct because this statement states, \"how much money did he make this week?\" This is not specified to be a week with 5 days. Therefore, the answer, 97, is correct. \n\nThe number of puppies would be the total amount of money earned from selling the puppies. From this question, we know that 10 puppys are sold. Since the puppys are priced at $200 each, the amount of money earned would be $2000. Therefore, the answer 3000 is correct.\n\nThe question refers to boris and cameron not having more than one item, which is why we can assume this is a", "answer": "B: subdivision"}

This is because an array list is much more efficient as it makes use of arrays that help store data in an efficient manner. \n\n#### What do you think is difficult to learn in OOPS? \n\n#### Answer: I think that the most difficult part is to understand how to use `Arraylist` to store data because it is different from simple Arrays and not many programmers know about it. \n\n#### How do you think can we make our codes more efficient and fast? \n\n#### A: Use of array\n\n#### B: Recursion\n\n#### C: Inheritance\n\n#### D: Encapsulation\n\n#### Answer: All of these concepts would work because they are the core concepts to learning OOPS and they make our program more efficient and fast.\n#### Can you provide an example to prove your answer? \nExample 1: if we need to read a number from console and store it in an array with the help of `arraylist` then we can write a program with such code in which we use a `for-loop` with an if statement to check whether the entered number is above 0 or not.\n#### Example 2: if we need to find nth element from the last then we can also use this approach where we can simply store the element in an array and then use `arraylist.get()`.", "answer": "C: listen carefully"}

For example, 2,646 is more than 10.1 hours, therefore they would drive less than (10+) hours.\n* Divide by 60 to convert to minutes.

{"text": "A or B\n\n### Instruction:Answer the question after reading and analyzing the passage\n\nIt was not surprising to anyone in the class when Mary, one of our shyest students, raised her hand to ask a question in her teacher\u2019s English class. When the teacher called on her, Mary had an incredulous look on her face. Without thinking, the teacher replied by asking, \u201cWell, Mary, what question do you have for me?\u201d Without hesitation, Mary responded to the \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d question with \u201cI \u2026 want nothing.\u201d This bizarre incident, which was so strange to most people that they remembered it after nearly a half century, has been on my mind and in my heart for all these years.\n\nIronically, by the time she was two years old, Mary knew all her numbers. Mary was born three months prematurely and it was the doctor\u2019s prediction that she would be blind, deaf, and mentally retarded. She did have some developmental problems, but not to such an extreme degree. After a year of intensive therapy, Mary\u2019s parents brought her to Montana, where they felt she would be more likely to receive the adequate special help she needed.\nIt was in school that Mary experienced the initial rejection that she would encounter throughout her life. She and her two siblings were brought to school each day via the school bus, so as not to inhibit Mary\u2019s learning process. In second grade, Mary\u2019s teacher told her that she would try to find a way to include her in the classroom. By the end of the year, Mary could not function in her classroom. She was taken out of class each day and sent to another school room.\n\nWhen I met Mary on the campus of Montana State University, in the early 1970s, Mary was working a full-time job, earning an Associate\u2019s Degree for her job on the production line of a large dairy corporation, and raising a teenage son on her own. For all her physical health issues\u2014Mary used a wheelchair due to spinal problems and could not use her left arm beyond a few minutes at a time because of severe arthritis\u2014she possessed a great sense of humor and a loving heart. Mary was a person who was as kind and humble as can be, never seeking attention", "answer": "C: pantry"}

This game uses the following rules:\n - Each player moves their piece according to the rules of the Chance and Community Chests (these cards are included with the game).\n - When the player lands on one of the properties, the player must pay the owner the amount of rent. The amount of rent is determined by the number on that property.\n - When a player lands on Free Parking or Go, the player must move to Jail.\n - If you receive a $20 or less fine from Chance or Community Chest, you pay the amount listed. If the fine is more than $20, you must move to Jail unless you have at least $20 in your wallet.

When the chance card tells you to \"pass Go\" and collect $200, you can do so.\n - If there are more than three properties owned by one player, the land tax is calculated on a ratio so that the land tax burden is shared equally among the owners of the three properties.

But Freddy did not call his family on New Year Eve with 31 minutes, so the answer is less than a dollar.<n><n>###Question3:<n><n>The answer is the average days.We know that a day is more than 600, so a week has more than 60 days. So we can just subtract 5 with the question. We know that a week includes seven days and so there is more than six days left.<n><n>###quesstion4:<n><n>We can simply see that the sales he could have are 5 because there is three groups of 3 and one group of 2. So the answer is 5.<n><n><n>### Question5:<n><n>In total,the answer is 64 because to divide 14 to 3 for a box we get 6,2 for a big library of 24 books,2 for Cameron and 3 for Boris.So the answer is 6.<n><n>###Quesstion6:<n><n>If there is about 4 ounces less,then there would be 22 ounces in a box,so 14-22 gives 7.Because the first box has 14, and the second box has 20 ounces less than that, then the third box includes only 14 ouncs.So the answer is about 14.<n><n>###question7:<n><n>We can use D and E because we are going to read the local news and we are using the TV, so we only watch TV.So the answer is D and E

Input: Lawrence worked 8... Input:... Input: Ali had a stock... Input: Michael... Input: The question asks... Input: Nalani had... Input: Boris has... Input: There are... <n><n>### Explanation of Answer<n><n>The question asks "how many candies does Corei have?" Therefore, 29 is the correct answer.<n><n>The question asks how much did Freddy spend on long distance calls. It does not specify what type of call this is, but we can assume that it is a local call. This is because it is referred to as a "local" call. <n><n>We have the equation 5c + 25c = x dollars. We have x - 5c = x - 25c. Because local = 5c and long distance = 25c. So we can solve for x. x = 30. This answer is correct because the problem states Freddy spent $10 dollars on his call. <n><n>The question asks when he is working, "how many hours will he work each day if he works the same number of hours?" This gives us the number of hours he worked on monday, which is 8, then subtracting that by the hours in the question which is 5, we get 3. Therefore, the answer is 3.<n><n>The question states that A and B represent the number of books sold. C refers to A - B or the number of books that where not sold. Therefore, the answer would be 600. <n><n>This answer is correct because this statement states, "how much money did he make this week?" This is not specified to be a week with 5 days. Therefore, the answer, 97, is correct. <n><n>The number of puppies would be the total amount of money earned from selling the puppies. From this question, we know that 10 puppys are sold. Since the puppys are priced at $200 each, the amount of money earned would be $2000. Therefore, the answer 3000 is correct.<n><n>The question refers to boris and cameron not having more than one item, which is why we can assume this is a

This is because an array list is much more efficient as it makes use of arrays that help store data in an efficient manner. <n><n>#### What do you think is difficult to learn in OOPS? <n><n>#### Answer: I think that the most difficult part is to understand how to use `Arraylist` to store data because it is different from simple Arrays and not many programmers know about it. <n><n>#### How do you think can we make our codes more efficient and fast? <n><n>#### A: Use of array<n><n>#### B: Recursion<n><n>#### C: Inheritance<n><n>#### D: Encapsulation<n><n>#### Answer: All of these concepts would work because they are the core concepts to learning OOPS and they make our program more efficient and fast.<n>#### Can you provide an example to prove your answer? <n>Example 1: if we need to read a number from console and store it in an array with the help of `arraylist` then we can write a program with such code in which we use a `for-loop` with an if statement to check whether the entered number is above 0 or not.<n>#### Example 2: if we need to find nth element from the last then we can also use this approach where we can simply store the element in an array and then use `arraylist.get()`.<n><n>

So, divide 2,645 (the total distance), with the number of miles per hour, to get an estimate of how long it would take to drive that distance. For example, 2,646 is more than 10.1 hours, therefore they would drive less than (10+) hours.<n>* Divide by 60 to convert to minutes. Convert min to hrs by multiplying by 60 then divide by 60 again (which was the way we converted at first 20).<n>```<n>* 80 miles an hour is what they used to get to California.<n>```<n>* It is a question of figuring a number out. The time is a function of the distance.<n>* Convert the miles into miles per hour for each route then round (if possible) to the nearest multiple of 10.<n><n>* Input: Alice and Benny decide to drive to California, splitting the trip into two days. What is the shortest route that they should take?<n><n><n>```<n>Output: <n>```<n><n>* We multiply the miles at which they had decided to take a break with the 55.5 miles an hour each car could travel in an hour then divide each fraction of the distance by the other driver's speed. If the first fraction that they arrive at is larger than the second fraction, that is the car's number. If the first fraction is not larger or smaller than the second fraction, they share it.<n><n>### DIVISION<n>* Input:

Tapanga and Core<n><n>Answer: We would need to figure out how many candies do each one have. We would multiply that by each person in the amount given by us.  <n><n>So in Corey would multiply that by 29.<n><n>This would be 29 * 66 + 29C = 30 * 66 +29C <n>So the answer would be 755. <n><n>We can check the answer by the equation given to us, 66x1+45 or 66x2+45 and 46x1+31x2+45,35<n><n>For what Tapanga has 75, 68 and then for what Corey has 75, so we could check it but we could just check the equation and this would go along with it.<n><n>### 2. How many dollars did freddy spend calling his family<n>This is a multi step equation. Let's look at the first step and see if we can find the next step. Then to check our answer. <n><n>We would look and see if any of the values would be repeated in our equation and we can replace it with one <n><n>So we can replace 80 with one by subtracting 80 to get 0 and 45 with one by subtracting it 0 as well. <n><n>Now we would add these together and get the cost for one call. <n><n>So if the answer was 10 we could check it through the equation. <n>This would be 8 *.5 + 5 + 5. <n>This isn't the correct answer but it could be an error.<n><n>The real answer would be: 10<n>So the steps to take from this would be: 8+8+8<n><n>### 3. How many hours would he work if he worked the same amount hours each day<n><n>To figure out how many hours each day he would work.<n>So let's go to the number we were given and multiply and divide by 6 so it would be like this: 5/0.668<n>So the answer to this would be 7.545<n><n>We can check this in a step equation by <n><n>

When the teacher called on her, Mary had an incredulous look on her face. Without thinking, the teacher replied by asking, “Well, Mary, what question do you have for me?” Without hesitation, Mary responded to the “What do you want?” question with “I … want nothing.” This bizarre incident, which was so strange to most people that they remembered it after nearly a half century, has been on my mind and in my heart for all these years.<n><n>Ironically, by the time she was two years old, Mary knew all her numbers. Mary was born three months prematurely and it was the doctor’s prediction that she would be blind, deaf, and mentally retarded. She did have some developmental problems, but not to such an extreme degree. After a year of intensive therapy, Mary’s parents brought her to Montana, where they felt she would be more likely to receive the adequate special help she needed.<n>It was in school that Mary experienced the initial rejection that she would encounter throughout her life. She and her two siblings were brought to school each day via the school bus, so as not to inhibit Mary’s learning process. In second grade, Mary’s teacher told her that she would try to find a way to include her in the classroom. By the end of the year, Mary could not function in her classroom. She was taken out of class each day and sent to another school room.<n><n>When I met Mary on the campus of Montana State University, in the early 1970s, Mary was working a full-time job, earning an Associate’s Degree for her job on the production line of a large dairy corporation, and raising a teenage son on her own. For all her physical health issues—Mary used a wheelchair due to spinal problems and could not use her left arm beyond a few minutes at a time because of severe arthritis—she possessed a great sense of humor and a loving heart. Mary was a person who was as kind and humble as can be, never seeking attention

The amount of rent is determined by the number on that property.<n> - When a player lands on Free Parking or Go, the player must move to Jail.<n> - If you receive a $20 or less fine from Chance or Community Chest, you pay the amount listed. If the fine is more than $20, you must move to Jail unless you have at least $20 in your wallet.

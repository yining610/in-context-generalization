They should read for 50 minutes each day.<n><n>### Input<n>There are two groups of thirty students. Group A is doing math and group B is reading. Each group spends 20% of their lesson time working on math and another 70% working on reading. If the two groups are combined, how many minutes do they spend on math every day?<n><n>### Input Solution<n>You should be able to solve this problem without any other information<n>### Response: The two groups of thirty students together are spending a total of 56 minutes on math every day<n><n>### Input <n>You want you and your friend to each take a turn driving for an hour until one of you feels tired. When you get in the car, what is a fair arrangement so both of you are getting enough time to drive?<n><n>### Solution<n>Since you want your friend to be able to drive each for an hour without taking a turn, that would take fifteen (1hr 15mins) minutes per person. So, you should make an arrangement so every hour, you and your friend take turns driving for 1 1/2 hours.<n><n><n>## # Solve<n>

When you enter an Expectation value it will calculate a value within a given range of numbers entered into the variable. We need to write a function call before we can run the given code to have it execute into the Expectation function.<n><n>```<n>For example: Expectation("Ali")<n>```<n><n>Will return Ali's average grade.<n><n>### Examples:Enter the name of the variables below to calculate the expected value.<n><n>### Function Name<n>The function name is Expectation() and expectancts the 3 variables entered to calculate the average grade of the subject: Expectation("Lupe") will return 82.1510826923266<n>Expectation("Pearls") will return 67.9664258105508.<n>Expectation("Amy") will return 74.0254210487266.<n><n>Expectation("Angel") will return 81.76176214207621.<n><n>### Note:<n>The Expectation() function is calculated by using a for-loop that iterates through the name of an assignment then returning to the for-loop while going through the other inputs that are expected.<n><n>### Example Goal<n>```<n>Goal: to find out if the name entered (Amy) is within the range of the Expected value.<n><n><n><n>### Input<n>Enter the name of the variable expected (in our case, Amy).<n><n><n><n>## #Expected Value #Results<n><n>### Examine the following Result to evaluate how the given code performed through the use of the functions.<n><n>### Amy(74) is within the expected range as shown here.

So, the animals will travel a distance of 12+12*3=18=6 meters<n><n>### Note3: Once you have the displacement, then solve for the amount of time that the dog and cat were actually traveling.<n><n>### Note4: Displacement is not the same as distance. Displacement shows the change in location.<n><n>### Example:<n>Let us define the cat and dog as A (cat) and B (dog), and the x direction as the left side of the plane and y direction as the downward side of the plane. They start at the point A=12+3A, i.e. at the point 12 meters from the origin in the plane, and B=0, that is, at the origin. They are walking in the same direction because the arrow from A to 12 does not change directions.<n><n>### Output: A is walking and B is walking with the same starting point at a rate of 12 cm/s and 3m/s respectively.<n><n>### Step 1: A is 12 units from the origin, so we place the point at 12,0.<n><n>### The next step is to define the speed of both animals in the plane.

Choices:  A: happen to people B: hurt people C: happen anytime D: happen often E: happen anywhere<n><n>### Response:		The answer is none of the above. Accidents are not caused just by humans, but can happen naturally to animals, to objects, & even nature itself, so it is incorrect to claim that _accidents_ what _hurt people_. Accidents, in other words, do _not happen to people_, they simply occur to things, whether they are people or not, but are _caused to happen to people_. As an aside, it is also important to note that because accidents can happen naturally, they do occur _anytime_, _everywhere_, & _freakin frequently_ just like anything else, so it is also incorrect to state that accidents occur _only anytime_.<n><n>### Instructions: You will type a statement, and then indicate what type of statement it is.<n><n>### Types of Statements<n>Statements have a purpose and an accuracy of what is being said.

She cried with joy. <n>* Complete sentence: <n>  A declaratory sentence that contains a subject, verb, and an object. Also referred to as grammatically complete sentences and sentences that convey complete information.<n>### Examples of Simple Statements<n>  - The fish was fried.<n>  - The sun is shining out.<n>  - The train is moving in the direction of the suburbs. <n>  - Ali was smiling at us in delight.<n>  - Ali was dancing in the streets.<n><n>### Examples Of Complexes Statements<n>  - I did not enjoy the movie.<n>  - The clown has been making people laugh. <n>  - The cats were playing with the toys all day.<n>  - The fish is moving around on the plate.<n>### Expectations for Complexes Statements<n>After the above examples of complex sentences, I expect you to write a complex sentence and then answer the question regarding its complexity, accuracy, and purpose in your paragraph and/or essay.<n><n>### Include your solution below:<n>```<n>The answer is the lady was getting worked up - <n>```<n><n>### Feedback<n>```<n>Correct

The top of the fences are 6 feet apart and the bottom of the fences are10 feet apart.3. There are 9 sheep in the pasture, but they are not evenly distributed. The leftmost sheep is 8 feet away from the corner and the rightmost sheep is 7 feet away. How many feet does the leftmost sheep have to travel to reach the rightmost sheep.<n><n>### Response 1:If the sheep stay on the fence they have to move 90 feet. But if they walk in a straight line they only have to move 50 feet, so they move 40 feet.<n>### Response 2:There are 28 feet between the sheep and there are 16 feet between the fences, so there are 44 feet between the sheep and the corner.

Since there are five pennies in each dollar, then take 16 dollars and subtract 5 each to get a total of 1495 pennies. To answer the question, the answer choice is: D <n><n>### Input (Telephone Problem)<n><n>Two dogs, Dylan and Toby, live at the same residence. They answer the phone after the third ring. On Wednesday, 1 dog answers the phone after 3 rings. On Thursday, the other dog answers the phone after the same or less number of rings. How many rings will it take to answer the phone each day?<n><n>### Response (Telephone Solution)<n><n>This question asks about rings. Rings are sounds that go from the telephone, through the receiver, and then the doorbell or the phone in general. It then tells us 2 dog ownes the phone. The key, in this question, is to understand how many rings it takes to get someone on the phone. If one dog picks up the phone on the 3rd ring, it takes less than 3 rings for Dylan to answer the phone. So on Thursday, Dylan answers the phone on the first ring. However, Toby answers the phone on the 2nd ring, and he answers the phone the same amount of rings every day. The correct answer is A. <n><n>**Note**<n><n>If you have no dogs, only answer the phone after the first ring or you will never go to bed. Otherwise, you will have to pick them up after 24 hours, give the 24 hours they have their rabies shots, and then put the dogs back together. If you have less than 2 dogs, you will have to answer the phone after the dog that picks up the phone does, and put the dog back on the hook and answer it after the same number of rings as the dog that answered it.<n>

Choices:  A: dissipate B: flown C: disintegrate D: fall apart E: penultimate<n><n>### Response:		B<n><n>### Response explanation:<n>A is not the answer; dissipate refers to the action of spreading out more widely(spreading into smaller particles by natural chemical processes for example), rather than it simply disappearing, B is not the answer; flown refers to the past tense. Therefore, the question is referring to a present tense answer and flown is in the past tense. Choices C, D and E are not the answer. C does not make sense as the word disintegrate refers to the process or state of breaking up or losing the cohesion of a whole. D and E are also not the answer.

Choices:  A: free time B: pleasure C: get divorced D: legal fees E: being lonely<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>This question in fact is a complex one. First of all, it is important to know the difference between “lawyer” and “attorney”. According to Black’s Law Dictionary, a “lawyer” refers to anyone who has the license to practice law, and an “attorney” refers to a person who has been trained to provide services to clients on behalf of the law. In my research, I have collected relevant information that would be helpful for the question. It turns out there is more than one type of a lawyer. For instance, the first question was answered with the help of divorce lawyers. The others, however, dealt with general legal practitioners such as tax, corporate and other specialized attorneys. Generally speaking, most divorce lawyers require very little of their time away from their practice and family, and they would spend more time with their wife than with a client. The legal fees associated with divorce are quite large. Therefore, the divorce is a costly task for many people (both partners). After the divorce, the former couple may not enjoy one another’s company. At any rate, what I have learned here is that the divorce cost money and caused the couple to lose their pleasure and fun.<n><n>### Input:[Which of the following is not a function of the liver? Choices:  I: excrete hormones and digestive juices II: control blood sugar levels III: filter toxins IV: create vitamin D]<n><n>### Response<n><n>This question is not a complicated one. It is important to determine the “not” in a given sentence. I find the use of semicolon, “not a function”, and “of” effective in asking a multiple-choice question. According to Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary of English Usage, the word ‘of’ is a preposition but it takes the form of ‘has’ or ‘have’ in this question.<n><n>We know that the liver creates vitamin D. However, it is not among the options. This explains that the options are “(I) excrete hormones”, “(II) control blood sugar levels”, “(III) filter toxins”, and “(IV) create vitamin D”. Thus, it is not necessary to continue answering the question.<n>

This was not difficult as I believe that it would be a success and that I would even exceed my goals.<n><n>Response: My sales manager may have been a little too aggressive in her forecast for the product. I believe that this product will not be able to earn $160,

Choices:  A: drop out of school B: ask questions C: enter school D: wash dishes E: read book<n><n>### Response:		In this task, I found a way to solve the problem:<n><n>The instructions tell us that there are 66 candies altogether. This means that Tapanga has more than Corey, since they have the same amount, but if Tapanga has more, that means that Corey has less.<n>```<n>Tapanga has 44 more than Corey,<n>8 more than Tapanga,<n>29 more than Corey<n>```<n>In the first case, Corey has 29, and in the last case it is the same to subtract 29, so the answer is 44.<n><n>The second set of instructions tells us that Freddy spends a total of 10 dollars. This means, that each call costs 0.50 and 1 min of call can be calculated by dividing the numbers. This means 10/0.5 = 20, so each call costs 20 cents<n>```<n>The first call costed 5 cents because the first call was local.<n>The second call costed 25 because it was an international call.<n>The solution is 20+20+8=48 which was the total of Freddy's cost.<n>```<n>The third set of instructions tells us to do the same amount of hours each day. If we do so, we will obtain the solution of 5 hours.<n><n>The fourth set of instructions tells us how many books were left in the Room. It means that 600 books were still not sold. This is the answer.<n><n>The fifth set of instructions tells us the amount of money that Michael makes. It states that 100 dollars were spent on the large birdhouses but the medium and the small birdhouses sold each for a dollar more so he received the equivalent of 97 dollars. This is the correct answer.<n>The sixth set of instructions gives us information about how much each of the dogs should receive. The number to the right is the multiplier, which is in this case the percentage, because the 4 would mean that there were 4 dogs. So, Cameron and Boris get 100% and 25% respectively, to receive 38 dogs in total.<n><n>The seventh set of instructions tells us  the amount of cereal in the 3 boxes. For the first box, the amount is

The sum of \(x\) and \(v\) is 24. Let us write it as \(x+v\). We can say that the sum of two whole numbers \(x_+\) must be equal to 24. Therefore, \(x+4=24\). This means that \(x+4\)-4 must also be 24. We know that \(x+4\) is equal to 24, therefore \(x+4-4\) must also be equal to 20. Putting the two equations together, \(x+4-3=24-4\). Therefore, \(x=12\) and \(y=12\)<n>### Input : There are two numbers. The sum of those two numbers is 14, and one of the two numbers is 7.

Choices:  A: fresh water B: gulf of mexico C: open ocean D: television program E: coral reef<n><n>### Response:		<n>A.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>The shark was migrate between two continents. So, the shark is not fresh water. Sharks normally swim more than 10 kilometers (6.2 mi) a day; this is one of the reasons why the fish have evolved their shape to be as streamlined and fast as possible. This statement doesn't specify what medium the shark is migrating between, but if the answer choices aren't an ocean, and it's not on TV, then we must assume it migrated in the open ocean. Since this answer is not listed as one of the options, the option that is listed is A, which says " Open Ocean", and is not a choice. Therefor, the answer is A.<n><n><n><n>Acknowledgement:<n>- [Drexel CodeRiders 2015](http://codegolf.drexel.edu/2015/04/10/introduction-to-programming/)<n>- [DreX CodeRiders TA Notes, Introduction to Programming](https://sites.google.com/site/drexcoderiders/home)<n>- [Dreex CodeRiders TA Note, Intro to programming](https://drex-coderiders-2015.github.io/intro-programming/intro-programming.html#multiple_choice)

Choices:  A: sit down B: make mistakes C: have sex D: reproduce E: excrete<n><n>### Response:		<n>If C, which is excrete, is chosen, the function could be written `excretes = excrete`. The reason for the `=` is so that we know excretes is a function that accepts a quantity and spits out a number telling us what humans do when they legs are tired. `excretes(1)` would give 44. We don't know how `excretes` works, because we will get this error upon inputting it at the REPL. >`excretes(1) Traceback (most recent call last):   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>   File "<stdin>", line 1, in excretes TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument '1'`<n><n><n>### Instructions: Use the function `excretes(i)` to find the 8th value in `excretes()`.<n><n>### Instructio: What would be the value of `excretes(3)` or `excretes(4)` or `excreates(5)`?<n><n>### Response 1:<n>```<n>>>> excretes(4)<n>44<n>>>> excreates(5)<n>77<n>> What does it mean to make a mistake, what does it mean that the legs are tired?<n>> What is a string?

In programming to get a result we can add function arguments.

It is unclean because it comes into contact with the food we ate. Butter, grease, and oil from our hands can mix with the detergent. And this was not good for our silverware. We use water, soap, and detergent to clean metal and plastic. But after silverware has been used they must be placed into the cupboard. Or they must be washed and sterilized to clean them. We clean our cutlery in the kitchen or sink. Butter and grease, are unclean substances that are not suitable for us to eat. If you want to prevent your dishes and cutlery from getting dirty always use different utensils for different foods. And, do not put your dishes and silverware on the floor and make sure they are thoroughly washed before they are put in the dishwasher. For silverware, use a soft cloth to wipe them dry."<n>```<n>

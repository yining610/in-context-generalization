This number gets rounded up to 20.  Therefore 19.4 + 19.4 = 38.8.  After five years you multiply the two by five to come up with 190. Therefore 190 + 38.8 = 228.8.

How much does her account earn in 30 days?\n\n## Rationale: Diana does indeed earn 3% interest daily.  Therefore she earns 15% compounded daily.  Now, what does that mean? It means that she loses 85% of her investment on a daily basis.  Since she loses 20% for every day, she loses 2 *.002 every day, which is 2% compound.

{"text": "E\n\n### Response(s) Explanation:\nThe note has a specific musical pitch, denoted as the letter A, to show that the location is associated with a melody. As it is usually located in a music classroom, the option 'B' would have been selected.\n\n### Input and Instruction:\nA certain class consists of 6 boys and 6 girls, and the class teacher makes up a math competition.  There are 8 different questions. The teacher has one question that one group of 3 boys and two  girls can answer and one question that another group of 5 girls and one boy can answer.  If each group is chosen for every question, how many different groups are there for the competition?\n\n### Incorrect Answer:\n12 groups\n\n### Rationales:\nThe only 2 groups that can be chosen for each question is the group of 3 boys plus 2 girls.\nAnd the group of 5 girls plus 1 boy.\nSo both groups can be chosen for each and every question, we need to take the number of possible questions x the number of different possible groups, which is 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16.\n\n### Correction:\n\n### Rationale:\nEvery question has two groups for each question. And every group is selected for one question at a time. That means 8 * 2 = <<8+2=10>>10 sets of two groups are chosen per question and this means the total number of groups will be equal to 10 * 8 = <<10*8=80>>8 groups. This is different from the initial inaccurate answer where the 8 groups from one question's 2 groups were used 8 times, and thus the answer 8 groups instead of 80 had been used. \n\n### Rationals:\nThe teacher can ask any question to any group. The only question a group won't be able to provide an answer for is when a question has been asked to a group that is not suited for that particular question.\nExample 1: The group of 5+1 girl and the group 3+2 boys will be chosen together for the problem, but the group of 5+2 girls will not be chosen since the answer cannot be given by that.\nExample", "answer": "E: sheet music"}

You go to the store and it costs 2 cents less per slice.  You pay at the register, then walk to your car.  Option B: The price of bread was increasing lately.  But by this week it dropped by two cents per slice.  So now the same loaf of bread costs 1 cent less than it used to.  Do you buy the bread at the store?  If so how would you get to your car?\n\n### Rationales:Option A: The initial price of 2 cents more cost was not a better bargain than Option B.  If the bread was the same price it normally is and you bought it, then you had to get it at the store.  Which was costing you more each week because you had to travel to the store to get it.  This is how Option B was better since you would save the trip to the store.\n\n### Rationales: Option B: The bread dropping 2 cents per loaf of bread cost was much better.  As it would mean you would save money each time on the bread.\n\n### Answer: Option B: Buy the bread at the store.\n\nAnswer: Option B: The price dropped by 2 cents per slice, so you can get the same loaves of bread for less.

It costs $50 annually to drive on weekends.  It costs $15 to fix the front tire.  It costs $75 to fill up the gas tank enough for two weeks.  How much does it cost to drive around during the week, with renewal?\n\nRationale: Weekday and weekend cost can be summed up as the $50 for the weekend + ($35*2)= $385 for the year\nThe driving cost is dependent on three factors: tank fuel, cost per gallon, and time spent.  Since the tank is 6 gallons, and the cost per gallon is $0.5/gallon, then $3 per gallon is spent to fill the tank\nNow, if the fill-up is a weekly drive to work, then the tank would be full at most twice.  So, if there is a round-trip of 200 miles, then the tank will get one-tenth of a gallon per mile, or 0.555 gallons used\nNow, we have the two parameters: weekend use, and weekdays use\nWeekend total cost for the year: $35 = $35.00\nWeekday total cost for the year\n$3", "answer": "D: acute angled"}

{"text": "We will determine what she does by analyzing the choices for why she sings.\n\n#### Option 1: Choice A: insane\n\nThis is only a possibility if she enjoys singing and gets annoyed with others because they don't like it.\n\n#### Option B: Choice B: annoy people\n\nIf this is a possibility, we know she sings either a lot or it annoys people, but not both. If she sings often and it annoys people, that makes her insane.\n\n#### Option C: Choice C: enjoy\n\nIf enjoy is a possibility, then she does not annoy people.\n\n#### Option D: Choice D: inhale\n\nTo inhale something means to breathe it in. If she simply breathes out while singing, this isn't the right answer.\n\n#### Option E: Choice E: had good voice \n\nIf she had a good voice, this means she has a good singer, but doesn't sing a lot, because she may be too well known from having a good voice.\n\n#### Now we know that sing is the reason, and enjoy is the opposite. so the best option is the Choice A or C: because if she had only one reason to sing, either she wouldn't be annoying most of the time or she is too well known to sing often.\n\n### Option B\n\n### Rationales:\n\nSay that you have to go to an interview. You would go dressed in formal attire, since it is a job interview and you could expect your future employer to be dressed appropriately as well. So, you'd want to wear your best shirt, your best pants, and shoes. This is a little extreme and somewhat unlikely, but it sets the precedent that we will dress for a more formal occasion based on the setting in some cases (more like business casual).\n\n### Answer Option:\n\n#### I'd wear business casual.\n\n### Explain why it is the correct answer: \n\nYou would want to wear your best pants, your best shirt, and shoes. Business casual is often better because you may get confused with formal business wear that a person may wear for a business attire dinner.

{"text": "B A rug does not need to go under a table.\n\n### Input and Output:\nInput: A. John runs 200 meters every day for his workouts. B. He ran the 800 meter race and was clocked at 2 1/2 minute\nper kilometer that he competed. How many kilometers did he run in that race? The answer, according to the choices in the game, is\n4 km.  Which of the four answers is NOT the correct answer?\n\n### Answer:\nA (Answer 3), for two reasons. First, the perimeter (800) is twice as large as 200, not twice as small. Second, the 2 1/5th minutes per kilometer in the question are in reverse comparison to the 200 meters (per kilometer). John would need to run 1,600 meters per kilometer (2,000 over three kilometers) to complete at 2 1/.5 kilometers per minute.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. 200 = <<200=1600>>1600 (per kilometer)\n2. 1600  = <<1600==112500>>11250  (per 3 km)\n3. 2 11250 /5 = <<11250/5=22500>>22500 (per minute)\n4. 22500 = <<22500==115>>115 (per 3/4 mile)\n5. ___ = <<_4/3=*>> = 100 (per 500 meters)\n\n### Input (3.25 minutes), answer (4), and rationales:\nC: 5 minutes per kilometer x 2 kilometers = <<2*5=10>>10\n10 minutes x 2.25/5 = <<2.25/2/5=4.5>>4.5 minutes\n4.5 minutes * 6 = <<4.5*6=27>>27 kilometers.\nC.

And a height of 20 feet. \n- Since the tightrope is 24 inches in width, and the acrobat is suspended 20 ft from the surface, the space between each inch of the tightrope and the acrobat's body will be equal to the number of inches on top of the ground.\n- The acrobats height must be the number of inches between each inch of her body and the ground(the starting inch mark of the tightrope).\nIn this case 20 x 24 = <<20*30=600>>600 is equal to the total inches in her height and 1 is her body width.\n- This means that in total, the acrobats height is 600 + 1 = <<600+1=601>>601.\nInput: Three tanks can each hold 23 gallons of water and are filled up to the brim.

It means, \"Do not hold a promise for tomorrow as a good security. Do whatever you have to do to obtain it\". Idioms are different from idiomatic expressions. These are often used to express the same sentiments with words of different origins. They are called idiomatic because they have a certain special or \"strange\" connotation which makes the expression unusually difficult to understand. In some cases, it may even seem to have a meaning contrary to its words.\n\n#### A bird in the hand is an idiom, whereas A bird in your hand is idiomatic.\nAnswer: A bird on the bush is not idiomatic, whereas A bird in the hand and A bird on the hand are idioms.\n\n###Input:If you're going to eat chocolate, it's time to start.

{"text": "Answer B which states that a bay is always found in the location of Manhattan Island.\n\n### Explanation: A bay is a partly enclosed body of water connected to an ocean or larger sea. A body of water is partially in enclosed by land that is not a coastline. Therefore, a bay can not be found in the location of a coastline. The location of coastline is in the ocean or the bigger seas.\n\n### Input:[I've heard a rumour...]Choices: A: The president of the republic has a secret plan underway.

E: It is already 6 pm and I haven't done the homework yet.\n\n### Response:[I've heard...]\n\n### Examplration: A 'rumour' is the general public of an idea. 'A rumour has got around that...' is used to introduce a statement which has been reported as true by lots of people. For example, the 'president of [the] republic' is the head of government of [the] republic. Therefore, a rumour that 'the president of [the] republic has a secret plan [underway at the] moment'  would be true because there is many people who have reported that the president has a secret plan [going on at] the moment.\n\n### [Someone I know got a raise for...]: Choices:[...] being hard working.\nAnswer: [... being] hardworking\n\n### Rationale: The sentence 'Someone I know got [a raise] for...' is a sentence for the type of information. This type of sentence is not used to state someone is more hardworking, but to state that someone has received [a raise] for something/somebody. For example, the sentence 'She was awarded [a prize] for performing brilliantly' is used to praise someone's performance. However, the sentence could not be used to state that'she worked hard' or'she studied hard'. To say that someone works hard, you should use 'She is known for being [hard working]'.\n\n### [He will lose the...] Choices: A: Election for mayor of the city.", "answer": "D: coastal area"}

{"text": "The correct choice is: 'A : YARD'\n\n### Justification:\nRationales:\nThe question asked us to choose the room that is always the favorite, and is the room where the aromas draw us back. \nWe can infer from that that the aromas of this room must be strong enough for us to choose them over the others.\nWe know that the word choice is room, which is narrowed down to be either the garden, living room, kitchen, basement, or a yard.\nWe can rule out the options basement, since it doesn't have aromas that make us draw to it. The living rooms smells generally only come from candles or plants, which wouldn't be enough to draw people in.\nThe same can be said for the kitchen, since the main aromas there come from spices and food, which can only draw in people who are working or cooking.\nThe garden, on the other hand, does have quite a few scents of its own that come from vegetables and flowers.

So the number he worked last week is equal to 2 * (Number of Days worked now + 1). Since we have only 7 days in a week, (Number of Days worked + 1) can take maximum value of 8 and cannot be more than 8. So it will be 8 * 2 = 16.\nSince the word used in the question is \"twice\", it may only be possible to divide both numbers. So, (number of days worked last week)/ number of days worked this week is equal to 16/7.\nSo 16/7, or 16 x 7/16.\n#### 1", "answer": "E: getting good grades"}

What is the most important thing they need to consider when writing the law?  Why?\n\nAnswer: They need to consider the age limit of adopting an abandoned puppy because it would protect the puppy from being abused by an unstable human. The age limit would restrict an old couple for example from adopting a puppy, because they may be unable to treat the pet with care and respect. Thus, people below the age limit can adopt these puppies because they are more likely to provide love and care to these abandoned animals, rather then neglect them like old couple. Accordingly, it is important to set the age limit when writing the new law.\n\n## Instructions:Answer the following sentence completion.\n\nA person could be an animal, but a person is not an object.

If we follow the path we'll go to the 10th number in the sequence. In the 10th position, the number is going to be 10. The next number to add will be 11. Thus we'll go: 11 - 10 = 1. And we go 10 - 1 = 9, which will make the number 9. Then we add 10 - 9 = 1. That way we get to 19. Thus, to add the number for the 20th position, we'd add 10 -19 = 1 and finally 20 - 1 =19.

{"text": "It's a rock, not a bush, a dessert, or a book. The rattlesnake is native to western North America, ranging from southern Canada to much of Mexico. This reptile is famous for riddable venomous bites. It is considered a very dangerous, aggressive snake that will attack and is highly defensive if threatened. Rattlesnake bites are common in areas where rattlesnakes are found. There are approximately 20 species, most of which have venom glands, and rattles are found in different species. While they are venomous, they are rarely deadly. A rattle consists of segments (vertebrae) at the end of the tail. Each segment is slightly lighter and separated by a bone called the squeaking (rattling) element. Their bite tends to leave deep cuts that cause tissue, bone, and blood loss from the area that was bitten. Lizards are cold-blooded reptiles that require warmth from the sun or another source, like a heat lamp. They spend a lot of time basking in the sun or near heat lamps or other sources of heat to stay warm. Cold-blooded animals have a hard time generating as much heat by converting food energy to body heat, which is why you do not usually see lizards in cold places. \n### Answer:E:Rocks\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following question about a sequence of figures.\n\n### Question:How many squares have a black top?

So, we need choose A.\n\n### Rationales:\nPaper files need a filing cabinet to store the paper files. Computers are used for file access and storage. Hence, paper files will not fit computers and desks.\n\nThe two options for \u201cfiling cabinet\u201d refer to the same case, so we can eliminate the first option since it is not a likely choice.\n\nAlso, the last choice refers to two possibilities, so we can eliminate that option.\n\nIn the end, we are left with one option, so we select the choice that is least likely to be the correct one.\n\n### 663\n\n### 2.5\n\n### Answers:\n\n663\n2.5", "answer": "B: filing cabinet"}

On the Seattle to Austin route there is one layover in Minneapolis-St. Paul. A layover is the time it takes for the passengers to get off the plane and then disembark on another plane. During the layover the passengers are in the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, but not on a plane. The Dallas-Fort Woth/Minneapolis-St.Paul flights takes between 4 and 7 hours. The layover is the same length for the departing flight whether the journey to DFW is 4 or 7 hours. If 5 people were flying from Seattle to Austin on the plane, how long would an average person have to wait between flights? A: $45 B: $6.25 C: $10.58 D: $26.25 E: $300\n\n### Response The cost of the ticket from Seattle to Austin is 125 dollars. The total cost of flights from Seattle to Dallas is then 125 (Seattle)- 125 (Austin) plus the layover cost.\n\n### This is the equation: 125 - 125 - x\n\n### This reduces to: 0 = -x or x = 0\n\n### Since x=0 it means that no layover is required so the total cost is 0 dollars.\n\n### 0 divided by 5 is 0\n\n## Input: If the population is less than 100 000 then round down.

Their price is 30% more than each box of cookies.  Their price is $200 higher than that of donuts and coffee.  For what many dollars is each box of brownies?\n\n### Response::The correct answer is C, 20.  This can be reached by doing the following steps:\n 1. The price of brownies is $5 more than the donuts and coffee. This means that in the formula of brownies' price, c = $5. \n   2. The price formula of donuts and coffee is $c = $15, so d = $10. \n 3. The price formula of coffee is $c = 15, so d=10. \n     4. The formula of donuts and brownies' prices is $45 = $15 + $30 and if you subtract the former from the latter, you get $5 = $15 - $10, which are two different formulas for the prices of brownies, but both have the variable $5, which indicates that each box of brownies costs $5.\n\n###Input:Alice bought a new computer monitor that costs $280.  Which of the following sums is closest to her total purchase?\n\n###Response:The correct answer is A: $300.\n\n###Rationale: Alice spent one hundred and ten dollars more on the monitor than the monitor's cost. Since she spent $110 more than she spent on the monitor, she spent that $110 elsewhere and so her total purchases are $390, the $280 she spent on the monitor plus the $110 extra she has.

This is not what he means by inertial. An inertial coordinate system is not attached to any one particle, but is considered to be moving with any particle with a constant velocity. What is needed in the relativistic theory of special relativity is also a frame that can be considered inertial in the way described, but in addition every frame of reference (including inertial ones) must be considered to have an equal right to the description of the events that occur within it.\n\n# 1.2 Multiple choice question\n\n### Instructions:Analyze the statements below and evaluate the validity of the arguments, given that your answer is the number of the statement.\n\n### Statements:\n\n1.

{"text": "What do you think?\n\n### Input-Based Rules\n\n### Write a function called `getTickets(priceInDollars, nTickets)` that accepts an input of `priceInDollars` and the number of tickets your client is purchasing.  Then, return an array of ticket prices, where `\"TicketPrice\"` is a string that includes the dollar amount.\n### Output-Based Rules:\n\n### In this test, you will run a function called `getAllTickets()` on 3 different objects of this type.  The function gets its input from the console.  The function must output all the ticket prices, as if they were printed on a separate line.  For example, if `getAllTickers()` was called, and there were 20 tickets, it would output:\n```python\n\"TicketPrice-1: 4\"\n\"TicketPrice2: 3\"\n\"Ticket3Price: 6\"\n```\n\n### You will test your solution on the following code:\n\n\\begin{code}\nvar theatre = { ticket1: 19.95, ticket2: 24.95, ticket3: 2.95 };\nconsole.log(getAllPrices(theatre));\n\\end{code}\n\n### Below is some helper code that you will use to help you test your solution:\n\n```javascript\nconst Theatre = { ticket1: '19.95', ticket2: '24.95', ticket3: '2.95' };\nfunction getAllPrices(theater) {\n    let prices = [];\n    for (let ticketNo = 1; ticketNo <= Number(theater.ticket3); ticket) {\n        prices.push('TicketPrice-' + ticketNo);\n        console.log(theater.ticker1, Theater.ticker1, getAllPrices(Theate));\n    }\n}\n```\n### Get the input for your code using readline.

A fraction is numerator/denominator, or the top number/the bottom number. If you look at the fraction, and see a slash, and two numbers in two separate boxes like that, that's what a fraction is. Example, if I would write 1/2, which would literally be one divided by two, if we have the denominator/the bottom number as two we know that this fraction is equal to 1 divided by 2. But if we have 1/5 of that, or if we would like to express 1 divided by 5 as one fifth, if we divide 1, we end up with 1 fifths, or 1 over 5, or 1/5.\n\n##### Example \n\n### Input Fraction\n\n#### Example 1\n\n##### Rationales\nIf we have 1 over 2 and 2/5 it means that if I would add the numerator, 1 + 2 = 3. And the denominator, 2 +5 = 7. So, 3/7 is equivalent to 2/5. And it means that 3 divided by 7 = 2 divided by 5, or 3/7 is equal to 2/5 just like a 2/5.\n\nExample:\n\n- If I would write 1 over 3/5, it means 1/3, 1 over 4 is equivalent to 4/5, and 1 over 5/8 is equivalent to 8/5. \n\n### Response 5\n\nThe sum of two fractions is an expression for the sum of 2", "answer": "B: polished"}

Rationales:You need to make sure you have a full 100. So, the first way you can afford to spend on a soda is going to be 90/100 = <<90/10=9>>9 cans. You can only afford 8 cans because 10 minus 9 is 1 which doesnt fit into a whole number. The next amount you can afford to buy is 99/100 = 10 which means you can afford 1 can of soda because 10 minus the 9 you cannot afford (10-9 =1) is 1 which is equal to 1 can of seltzer.\nThe last way you can spend your money on a soda is to buy a maximum of 2 cans.

{"text": "In order to correctly answer this question you must first distinguish between the actual meanings of the words and understand their logical applications. The question asks, \"where can you eat fruit on _ _ _ bridge\". The bridge is known as the Golden Gate Bridge which is located in San Francisco, California. San Fransico is also the name of a tree which comes from southern and central America and goes by the scientific name of Pipa. The San Fransico is often called the \"fruit tree\" as it bears orange orange colored fruit. It is possible, and in some instances probable, that you could eat fruit on the San Fransico bridge as it is possible to find San Franso's being used and grown in the USA. In the case mentioned above the answer to this question would be E. The San Fransco bridge and the tree both start with an S which could help lead to the incorrect answer of choice A.

This would be a logical alternative. Other choices would not be possible due to the limited amount of fruits present on the choices provided. If one were to consider the answer of choice D one would need to ask, where you can eat fruit on a market?

Be as detailed as needed.\n\n\n### Passage:The morning was a busy one at the office. I was about to walk into the canteen when I noticed someone in a wheelchair coming towards me. He approached until we were just a few feet from one another. Without skipping a beat, the man began his lament.\nHe was complaining that the world owed him and other wheelchair users a \"perfect society.\" He said that people who were in wheelchairs should not be expected to do the same things that people who could walk did each day. He explained that people who could walk were simply too lazy to think in terms of \"accommodation.\" But things would change, the man thought. And when they did, he said, society would be \"profoundly different.\"\nI was astounded by his speech. First, I thought, the man was making a lot of assumptions. For example, he seemed to think that the world owed people with disabilities some special privilege. But this was the type of thinking people like me were supposed to be stamping out: the type of thinking that said, \"We're different, and we're owed something special.\" It was the thinking that had once led to racial discrimination, and it was the thinking that was leading now to class and gender discrimination.\nBut there was more wrong with the man's thinking: as a person with a physical disability, he was making it easy for the people without disabilities to turn a deaf ear to my complaints. When you complained about your accommodation needs, they could simply say, \"Well, what about those who can't walk?\" Their comments would mean two things: one, that they had failed to understand my case because they had not taken the time to ask; two, that they were willing to let inaccessibility slide, because they felt they had made the sacrifice of going out of their way already for me.\n#### 5\nAnswer:C\n\n### Instrumentation:Rationales: She did not want to", "answer": "B: feel more comfortable"}

These were each worth $9 each.  How much did Adam pay for the nuts and the fruits?\nWe have to find the costs and not the products. For this, we'll use the formula, _Cost_ = _Price * Quantity\nFirst, we multiply the price of the nuts by their quantity. That gives us $144.\nThen we multiply that number by 3/2 to find the cost of the 2 whole nuts.\nSubtract this cost from $144 and we find $3.\nLikewise, we find the cost of the fruits\nWe can calculate the cost of the whole nuts and the cost of fruits together.\n\n$3 + $39 + $54 = 96\n\n### Input : Johns goes to the Gym 3 times a day. 60 minutes each day. 50 minutes warming up each day. 20 mins each day for cardio.

That is where you would go to buy the bandages anyway. As to the hair brush, you can buy it from the drug store. In the bedroom _all_ of the things necessary to create a hairstyle are present.

A coffee shop has limited seating space, and there aren't many places to move to if you need to get away from other people. A solar system would be perfect for this experiment, as all the planets would provide a lot of space to explore, but would be impractical for one person to travel to.

What is the probability that a randomly selected plane will fly more than 35,000 more air miles before it breaks?\n\n### Response 16.\n\nIn this case, since we want more than 35000. we have to subtract from the distribution.\n\nSo P < 0.437 for less than 35040\n\n#### 0.432\nAnswer: 0.43\n\n### Input17:Johnny\u2019s family lives in New Orleans, Louisiana. There is a 95% chance that Johnny will need to evacuate from his home. Which is the best representation of this probabliy?\n\n### Rationales:Let the probability of evacuation be P.\nSo 0.95 = P/(1-P)\nIf we are to find the probability of evacuating, we substitute 1 by 100 to ensure that it won't become infnitesimal.\n\nSo 100% = P/(100-P)\n\nThis can be further transformed, which is equal to\n100% = 100(1-P)/(1-P)\n100% + 0.05 = 95%(1-P)/95(1-P) -----\n\nSince the coefficient needs to be simplified, we will be subtracting 95% from both sides.\n\n95%+0.05 = (1-P)/(95+0.05) ---\n\nFrom here, we multiply the both side by P.\n\n1 = (1-P)(P)/(95-P+0.05 * P)\n\nRearranging the term a bit gives us -1 = 0.17 * P\nThus, P = 5.9(1/17)\n#### 5.9\nAnswer: 5.9", "answer": "B: solar energy"}

How many hours did I sleep that week? (Remember the answer is NOT one, as you can't have a fraction of anything greater than 1.)\n\n### Response :\nWhen I went to sleep this past week, I slept exactly 100% for each day, that means 100% / 7 = 14.3. Let's assume that sleep time = time. Then, 100% of 7 days = 700% of 1 day, the difference between 60% and 100% will be 40%. That means 100*60/100 = 4/5 =<<4/5=2>>2 of one day. Thus, the answer would be \"2\" in terms of fraction 2/5.\n\n#### Input :When I went to sleep, I slept for one hour, an additional hour, and three hours.

Try to figure out what the question is asking you to do. In the example question, you need to figure out which number is the midpoint of the numbers.  You can use division and fractions as well as addition and subtraction to solve the math problem.  For example: you can use 2 \u00f7 5 = 0.4 to find the first fraction, then 3 \u00f7 0.4 = 7.5 to find the second fraction, then 7.5 + 9 = 16.5 or 16.5 \u2013 2 = 14.5.

What is the average marked price of these sweaters?\n   Rationales: We first need to calculate the mark-up. Remember, mark-up is the price of the retailer, or a cost plus the retailer's profit.\n      We know that the green sweater has the mark-up. So, the price of the green sweaters is the cost price of the green sweat plus the mark-up.\n      So, the cost price or the mark price is $160.\n      Thus, the mark-up = $160 \u2013 x = $10.\n\n      Next we need to work out the average mark-up.

We call water a \"natural resource\" because we believe that it is impossible to make fresh water from the air.

{"text": "The correct answer is \"D\"\n\n### Justification: Rationales: The choices are: opening one up, more rice, own house, warm coat, light up, and read book. Let us eliminate the answer that is not a relaxing action: read book. Thus, left with the choice to either take someone else's open container, get more (open) rice, buy their own house, get a warm coat, light up (a cigarettes), or something else. Since this is a \n> relaxing action, the answer must either be getting their own house (which would be very relaxing) or a warm coat. A couch is not an option - that's not relaxing. Neither is lighting up a cigarette (again relaxing, and would require either smoking or getting a light). Thus, either getting a warm coat or a house it is. \n\n#### Warm coat\n\nRationales: Here there is a choice: take a container from someone else, or get your own coat.\n> Taking a container is not relaxing.\n> Getting a warm coat is relaxing.\n\n#### House\n\nRationales. Choices A: take container, B: more rice, C: own house, D: light up, E: read book \n\nFirst, consider choice A: Take container: It certainly is not relaxing, so it can be eliminated. \n\nChoices B, C: Take container or get a warm coat. Either is possible for relaxing, but taking a container is not relaxingly.\nChoices D, E: either light up or getting a warm coat. Either way would satisfy the relax, and so both are not correct choices.\n\nSo that leaves only getting your own house or getting a warm coat as relaxing.", "answer": "E: read book"}

So each week they produced 49 pancakes less than they were able to use in that week.\nSince last week they were able to produce 79 instead of the 59 that they were able to use, that means that this week they were able to make 29 less than they were able use, which is 49-29=<<49-29>=20>>20 more pancakes.

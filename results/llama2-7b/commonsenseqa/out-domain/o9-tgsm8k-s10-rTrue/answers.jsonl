The SUV is in the middle. How fast are they traveling when they pass each other?\nOutput: In order to determine this, we need to compare the speed of the car as well as the SUV towards the 1020kg car as well as compare the speed of the 102kg car towards them.\nFirst, we will determine the speed of the 2200kg SUV in regards to the 102 kg car since we need to determine the speeds the SUV and the 102 car have towards each other.\nSince the SUV is in the the middle of the other 2 cars, it is therefore 70% of the way between the 102 and 1850 cars.\nTherefore, it is 2200km/h -(70%*1850) = <<2200-(70%*1540)=-380>>-380km/h in the opposite direction of the 1000kg car.\n\nNext, we determine the speed of the car in regards to the SUV and the way it is moving. The car is 30m away from the SUV so it must be travelling at 30m/s to keep up with the speed of the SUV.\nThe car is 3/4 of the way to the 100 m/s car so it is 3000m/150 = <<3000/150=20>>2365,000 m/h moving away from the SUV in terms of velocity.\nTherefore, the car is 100m/s -2365, 000 = <<100-236500=1365>>1365km/h away from the SUV.\n\nFinally, we determine the speed at which the SUV was when it past", "answer": "D: louisiana"}

If he has enough space and wants to make a living room with the two, what is the best size of the living room in square meters? \nOutput: The answer for the dimensions of the living room is 3m x 2m.\nThe original area of the bedding, or the total area of sheets, blankets, and pillows is 18m2.\nMultiply that by the area of curtains (1,9m2) to get the initial area of the room: 18m2 * 1,9 = 35,2m2\nNow, subtract the curtain area (1,9m) from the bedding area (18m2) to get a net living room size. This number is 33,1m.\nDivide that number (33,1) by 2 to get the size of each window in the room: 33,1 / 2 = 16,55\nTake the number one more time and multiply by 2 for the width and length of a square meter: 2 x 16,57 = 33,14\nFinal answer will be 33,1 + 16,5 = 19,61 square metres.\n\nInput: There was a big party at Joe's house.

At her department store, gift items cost $X. Dana has to spend at least $5.00 and no more than $9.00. If she buys a gift, what are the possible values of X?\nOutput: Let's say Dana bought a gift for $39.80 (because she bought a lot of gifts) and for each gift she had to spend at least $4.25 and no more than $5.0. Then, for the final gift she had to spend: 500 - (39.8/2) = $<<500-(39.8/5)=209>>209.0\nSo in the first $209 dollars she bought gifts and then she had to spend at most $5.0 on the final gift, which is less than 209 dollars, which means any value of X is valid for the problem.\nSo the final answers are all of them\n\nInput: The cost of each shovel purchased from the manufacturer is about $5.00 more per shovel than the cost of any shovel used since a shortage of shovels exists.

This means $y$ has to be a multiple of 6, so the range of $y$ is $0 \\leq y \\leq 6$.\nIf I then subtract $x$ from $y$ from both sides, I'll be left with 0 as $y$ and $y-x$ as the number of bales not covered.\nBecause the problem asks for at least 1 cow, the cows in the pen have a range of 0 to 6.\n\nGiven that the probability $x \\geq 1$ is also true, the answer can be simplified down to $x \\times 5$.\nProbability of at least one cows is $0.25$.\n\nInput: The square root of $\\\\$375$ is\n\nOutput: I cannot compute a square root in a number with an exclamation mark in it.

If the answer to the previous question is B, then the answers to 5 and 6 must be sorrow, as money will cause both sorrow and paying bills. This logic allows us to determine that the answer to question 7 must be \"E.\"\n4. Answering choice \"A\" to question 5 leads us to an infinite loop in which we always start at a state in which you are sad, and that state is never satisfied, such that you will never reach your goal.\n5. If the answer to choice \"B\" of question 6 is a, it will mean that you are both happy and doing bills, which is not a valid state.\n6. Finally, the answer to choice \"D\" of question 6 must be A, sorrow, because if the answer is \"B\", the result of answering \"A\" to the question will be sorrow again, therefore the answer to \"C\" is \"A\" if \"B\" is not answered.\nSimilar logic can be applied to other possible combinations (e.g. if the answer to question 3 is \"E\") as it leads to an infinite loop which ends either with \"E\" or \"A\", \"D\", \"C\", \"B\", \"A\" depending on the initial choice.\nThere are multiple ways to think of this puzzle.

Choices: 1. Evenly. 2. By skill! 3. By experience. 4. Whatever is fairest. 5. 12.3.4. All five choices are equally correct.\nOutput: There are exactly 5240 different ways.\nTo divide $20 by 1, 2 or 3 gives the same output (20/1 \u2192 20/2 \u2192...)\nEach input division must start and end with a 0 (0/1 \u2192 0/3 \u2192...)\nTo find the number of ways 5 can be divided by 2, we first find out the last possible value of the dividend - in this case 0.\nNow to divide the two 0's by 3, we have to take into account that there are two options:\n`[[0, 0], [0, 3]]` or `[[3, 0], [3, 3]]` (the only difference is on the right)\nWhen dividing a second 0 by 3, the two options are:\n`[[000, 3], [030, 3]] or [[033, 3], [333, 3]]`.\nWhen dividing 3 by 2 for the third time, there are two options: `[[,2], [,]] or [[2, ], [,]]`.\nThere are ways in which three different outputs can be put together (3!). To each of the 5 output combinations (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) there is a unique way of putting the divisors together. That gives us the final result of 5240.\nIf there is a division error, it's because there are not enough valid divisors.\nSo the final output: 5240\n\nInput: In the above input, you should subtract, rather than divide, $180 by $14.\nOutput: Since $180 minus $14 is $166, subtracting $14 and not dividing by", "answer": "E: garden"}

Using those figures, how many customers are expected a day?\nOutput: How many customers will they have? Aaron and Emily know the total number of people that come to the farm each day. They also know what percentage of people are expected to stop at the bistro.\nLet's let P be the total number of people who come to the farm.\nThen 10% of customers visit the bistro - this number is 10% of P - 10% of 2500 is 250.\nHence, the number of customers that can be expected to visit the bistro in one day is 250 or 25.\nAt the end of the day, they expect to make at least $8 per customer so 25*8 = $<<25*8=260>>260.\nTo ensure they are able to cover their food costs for the week, Aaron and Emily want to make $8,000. To achieve this, they need to bring in $320,000 (=8000/25) per day.\nLet's replace $n with the number of customers they expect in a day.

It has a slightly different amount of work (3 and 2.5). The first part is just like the second (answer #2). The second part (answer #3) is where the difference comes from.\nFirst we're going to find the amount of work it took to fill up 6000 blocks which is $6000*250/6000 blocks filled. $60*250= The two people together are trying to fill up the truck with $6000 blocks and only have 2000 left.

But with this arrangement, there is one specific ordering with that total. \nSo if k is the number of balls in the first row, \nand if m is the number of balls you have in the other rows,  then you have  k + (k + 1) + (k + 2) + \\ldots + (k + m - 1) equations, and that is a system of m + 1 equations and m + 1 unknowns.  You can solve this system of equations by  Gaussian elimination. \nGaussian elimination is a method of solving systems of linear equations.  A system of linear equations is a collection of m linear equations in n unknowns.  If you have m equations and n unknowns, then you can use Gaussian elimination to find the solution of your system of linear equations. \nInput: The maximum height an NBA player can jump with one hand is 32 feet and 11 inches.

{"text": "The correct answer is C.\nD: violin case\n\nDennis is preparing to move into his new house and is wondering where he can best store his dozens of violins. Dennis owns hundreds of violins, but only fourteen of them are his \"trophies\" which he had made for winning the violin competition in the state of Ohio. Dennis doesn't know where he can best store those. He doesn't want them to get damaged or harmed, but his trophy violins are all the most important ones. They are the best. So his friend, Ben, suggests a violin case that can be stored on the wall in any room - the one that doesn't go with anything in the house. If Dennis has more than fourteen trophy violins, how many spaces can he put them in?\nOutput: If Dennis has n trophy violins with n > 4, Dennis can put his violins in an n-part violin case that can store 3n+2 violins where n > 2.\nFirst, let's calculate how many violin cases Dennis can put up. A single violin case can hold up to 3 trophy violins. If Dennis has n > 2 trophy violins, Dennis would be able to put him up as many 3n+1 violin cases. This becomes a mathematical equation:\n3n+1 = n\n3 = 2\n2n+1 = n+1\nn = 0\nn = -1\nn = -1 - 2 = -3\nn = -4 - 2 = -6\nn = -7 - 2 = -9\nn = -10 - 2 = -12\nTherefore, Dennis must store 3n+1 trophy violins in one single violin case. This means Dennis can put 4 violins in each one. If Dennis has more violins than 4, he will need to get up more violin cases. This means Dennis will be able to store up to 124 violins in each wall. With no extra wall space, he would be able to store only up to 539 violins in each wall by storing one. He'd save 539 violin cases if he gets 539 extra wall space.\nNow, Dennis will want to have one violin per n", "answer": "A: tennessee"}

On a 80-mile round trip, he drives 7.5 miles over the speed limit to get a flat tire that needed immediate service.  If he is paid for a total of 11 days including the flat tire day he was paid for, calculate how much he makes for the 11 day period.\nOutput: Total money paid (taking both car expense and payment) is $<<3200>>3200\nDustin is paid $100 + $1.70/mi = $<<100+1.70/1=181>>181 for every mile he drives. That includes his flat tire day.\nOn a 80-mi round trip, a total of 1.2 mi extra driven = <<1.2/80=1.5>>1.5 miles extra driven is spent.\nHence, after adding all his extra miles, it becomes $181 * (80+1.2) = <<181*80+1.5=1475>>1475\nNow, we need to subtract the flat tire days cost to get a regular 11 day trip (forgetting the flat tire day).\nFor 11 days, he was paid $1810 = <<$1810=1810>>1810.\nFor the 11", "answer": "B: dangerous"}

The final price of the trip is the result of 120% of a 10% markup.  The original cost was determined by a price list of the different components of the trip, which included airplane tickets that cost an average of about $400, hotel rooms that cost an average of $700, and rental vehicles that cost on average $45 a day.  Based on their price quotations, what is the total price of the trip for one person?\nOutput:  Let us first look at the discount. We know that discount = 100/90 = 1.11\nNow the discount reduces the original price to 120*111*111 = <<120*1.11*1.11=133>>133\nNow for the markup, 120% = 1.2 * 1.2 *1.2 = <<1.2*1*1.2=2.4>>2.4\nSo, the final price is 1.2*2.4 = <<1.25*2.4=31>>31, for the entire trip.\nSo, the total charge to be paid for a person on a vacation to Orlando, Florida is 31.\n\nInput: The following is a list of ages for three people who are 20 years younger than their respective spouses.

She uses an algorithm in which she works out how many fifth-grade students are in a school, uses that number to assign a value to each school, and then sums those values across all five schools. How much money will Alice earn from the performances combined if the cost for Alice is assumed to be a flat cost of $50 per performance?\nOutput: Alice will earn $5 per student * ((13/18) + (13/14) + 1/5) = $<<5*(13/18+13/14+1/5)=20>>20 dollars.\n\nAnswer:\n\nB\n\nExplanation: \"D\" is incorrect, because it claims Alice needs to give a flat payment of $25, but that would result in a disadvantage to elementary school students because they would be paid the same as middle school students, even though they perform the more-difficult dance. \"C\" is incorrect, because Alice does not claim that her cost is a flat cost of $100 per performance. The description of her method of calculation includes \"If she works in 5 schools, she should take (5*5 = 25) of the 60, since there are no fifth-graders.\" But this means Alice does not work in all 5 schools, so that claim does not work.

I got the idea for this after reading a map listing the countries of the world.  For example, in the case of N America, I know that in some places it is called Ameriga, and in the context of this question it is called North America.  But in the same document, the other continent, South America, is also listed.  It struck me that sometimes there aren't really good names available for something, and I was wondering if I could come up with a more appropriate (better?) name for these places than the ones we're using now.  Can I think of a new name for Africa and Antartica that better fits the definition of each?\nOutput: When looking at the list of continents, N and S America, Asia,Africa and Europe are all listed with a specific part.  However,  the ones left unspecified or omitted are Africa and Antartica.  This is because Africa and Antartica cannot be specified, they are the unspecified place name.  Therefore, neither Africa or Antartica can be named better.\nSo the final choice is there are no additional better names that can be used for either of these two continents.\n\nInput:I am looking at a list of countries and their capitals.  Can I think up names for some of them that sound more appropriate, in my opinion than the names they're using now?  For example, I know that for Europe there are some countries that are referred to by their specific part (ie, in English, it's Scotland, France and so forth).  But what about, say, Russia or Spain or Germany?  Can I come up with a name for those countries that might make sense in the same fashion \u2014 say by referring to the part of the country (in this case, Russia, Spain and Germany) that would be the capital?

When she was 7 years old, Emily's mother told Emily to draw the line segments between all the numbers from 1 to  4 so Emily would be able to play this game with her father. How many lines did she draw?\nOutput: Let's go through all the cases one by one. So one possible case would be where Emily picked two numbers of 1 to 4 and her father didn't pick any of the numbers. So the answer would be two line segments. Next let's assume, all her parent picked numbers that were 1 to 4, then let Emily be the third, then the answer would be two plus one plus three or six. Lastly if Emily's father picked four numbers, then there is no one left to pick, so the answer is one. Taking away the one case where she didn't pick any numbers, the only possible cases for Emily left are\n2, 1, 2, where her father didn't choose any of the numbers\n2, 1 + 2 + 3, where her mother chose two, Emily chose 1 and her father chose 2 + 3\nWe conclude that there are four possible cases to consider, and so we arrive at the answer of four.\n\nInput: A group of children are playing a game where they stand on a square tesselation to be drawn by their teacher.

Now we know that the revenue is 550 and the amount that the company receives as tax is 750, let's solve the remaining equation.\nThe equation of Revenue - Tax = Employee Revenue + Cost of Revenue is <<Revenue-Tax=EmployeeRevenue+CostofRevenue>> in order to solve the equation, we must first divide through the equation by 2 (as there are 2 \"x\" terms). We will know that the 250 from earlier is true from the equation of Tax = Tax - (Employee Revenue + Cost of revenue), as from before, we know Tax = 750.\nNow, as the variable for tax is still \"Tax\" at the end of the equation, we can simplify the equation and write that Tax = 75. From this we will know that the equation now becomes Cost of Revenue = (Revenue - 75).\nAddition + subtraction = 0, so multiplying both sides of the equation by -1 = -<Revenue+7", "answer": "B: look attractive"}

What are the ages of three of the men?\nOutput: Let us denote the average of five women as A and the average of ten men as B.\n\nFrom what we know, B-A<10; B-A>12. For this to be true, two of the women will be younger than 48 while three others will be older than 50.\n\nWe first remove the three oldest men from the group of ten and label them as W1, W2, and W3.\nThese three men are assumed to be the oldest men in the group.\n\nNow, of the eight men left, let us denote their average as B'. Therefore, B' > B.\nWe then re-subtract W3 from B' to get (B' - W3). This result will be the average of the two oldest men in the group of eight. This gives us two candidates for W1.\n\nFor W2, consider that the middle man of the ten will be older than the new five-person average and thus younger than B'. Conversely, consider that the middle woman of the five will be younger than the new five-woman average.\nNow that we have W1 and W2, we take W2 out of the group of ten, keeping the average constant. If there was no loss in the average, B' would be lower than B. Since B' <= B, this means that there is a loss in average as a result of the removal of W2. This loss of average is represented by the remaining average of the nine men as B'.\n\nWith the five men left, we consider the average in the group of nine. For our purposes, let us denote this group's average as B'. Since B' < B, there is now a gain in average as a result.\n\nIf we now keep removing men from this group until only the ten oldest men remain, one of the man removed out of the group of nine will be chosen as W3. This man is assumed to be the oldest of what is now the ten-person group.\n\nWith two of the three oldest men added back in, we assume we are now in the condition of nine men + the ten-person group average", "answer": "B: healthier"}

Tom takes the last flight home every evening at midnight. If Joe and Tom have to work on Wednesday and the plane that Joe takes is delayed, what time will Tom get home?\nOutput: Joe takes the first flight home each day at 6pm.  If Joe takes the first flight, he reaches home at 6pm.\nSo if Joe's flight is delayed by an hour, he reaches home at midnight.\nIt would mean that Tom has to work one extra hour.\nSo for that he can take a different route to work that is a total of 1 mile shorter.\nSo the total number of miles Tom takes to reach home would be 60 - 1 = 59 miles\nNow Tom takes the last flight each day at midnight.  So he has to cover a total of 59 miles.\nThat means he covers 14 miles per hour.\nSo the total time it would take him to reach home would be (59/14)=<<59/14=4>>4 hours.\nSo the total answer would be 15 hours that day.\nSo the final answers that's correct is B) 4\n\nInput:\"If you take one quarter of three quarters, then the remainder is a quarter.\" Which of the four answers is true?

This means that they will be sued. This is why you can sue someone in court.\n\nThe court of action is a type of legal proceeding whereby a group of people or entity sues another entity for money.\n\nIn the event that both parties are unable to come to a mutual agreement as to the damages sustained, then it is at that point that the trial can begin.\n\nBefore any legal action is taken, the court may ask for an investigation to be made into possible offences, should there be any suspicion that it was not an accident.\n\nThe purpose of civil action is to hold those people responsible accountable for their actions so that they do not repeat the same mistakes. This prevents crime from occurring in the future.\n\nIn addition, civil actions are often followed by financial compensation for loss/damage, which helps to restore some balance in society.\n\nFor example: Civil Action (2003 Film)\nThis is a story about a man who starts a civil action against one of the most well-known corporations in America, Monsanto, and wins, due to their harmful use of pesticides.\n\n### Solution:\n##### Multiple Choice:\n- [300](https://github.com/DenisLazukin/Python-Interview-Questions-Solutions/blob/main/Chapter10/Instruction%20and%20solution%20pics/300.png).png\n- [30](https://githubcom/DenisLazzkin_Python-Interview- Questions-Solutions/blobs/main/Chapter%208/Instructions%20and% 20solution%5CPics/30.png).png \n- [15230](https://g herithubcom/DenisLlazkinpython_interview_questions_\nsolutionsmainChapter6sol 3.png).png", "answer": "C: anger"}

Also if you buy 120 pair you will save more than that\nSo the final answer Is\n2 pair\n\nInput:How much would you need to pay for two bus tickets if the first one costs $3 and the second costs $6?\nOutput: $3 + $6 = $<<3+6=9>>9\nSo the final answer\n9\n\nInput:How many 8 inch square pizzas can be fit on an 18 inch pizza pan?\nOutput: The square can contain the area of 4*8 = <<4*8=32>>32 on an 18 x 18 inch pan.\nIt would fit a total of 18*18 = <<18*18=324>>324 pizzas in an 18 x18 pan\nIt would be the same ratio as using 6 square 9 inches pan.\nArea of a 9 inch pan: 1 square inch = 9 square Inches\nArea of 18 x 9 square inch pan: 9*18 = 162 square Inches\nArea for all of the pizzas: 162*324 = 52816 square Inches \nSo the final answer 5281\n\nInput:You bought a new suit and paid $50 for it.

What is the price of the one-way ticket if the roundtrip ticket costs a total of $700?\nOutput: The roundtrip airline ticket costs $7*2 = $<<7*2=14>>14 roundtrip tickets.

The price of a single-way airline ticket is 1/7 = <<1/7=0.14>>0.14 of the price (about 6% of the price) of a roundtrip. Since the price of the oneway ticket is 6/70 of the price of the round-trip ticket (7/70), the price of the one way ticket is: (7/70)*(700/4) = <<7/70*(700/4)=73>>73 one-way tickets.

When it\u2019s happy, the cow sleeps. This cow\u2019s a real night owl. When the cows are happy, they eat 3 apples. When the cows sleep, they eat 1 apple each. When they're angry, they eat 2 bananas. How many apples will they eat tomorrow?\nOutput: The cows will eat 15 apples tomorrow. \nIn a happy state with 3 bananas eaten, each cow will eat 3 apples, which gives it 6 apples. A happy cow + 2 bananas eaten gives it 1 additional apple, so the total apples it will eat after eating 3 bananas is 9 apples. Since a happy cow is eating 2 bananas per state, it needs 1 apple and 1 banana to become neutral. So it needs a total of 2 bananas and 1 apple to become neutral.\nFor neutral cows, only apples are eaten, and 2 apples eaten gives the cow a total of 6 apples. \nAlso, the cows sleep when they eat only apples, so when there is no banana to eat, each cow sleeps. Sleeping cows eat 1 apple.\nSo 2 neutral cows eat 2*1 + 2 apples, and 1 neutral cow eats 1 apple. After the neutral cows have eaten 3 apples, they will eat bananas, and since they eat 2 banana per state, they need 3 apples.\nSo after 2 neutral cows have eating 2*1 +2 apples, and the neutral cow eats 3 apples, each neutral cow will eat a total", "answer": "E: office supply store"}

However, a large 2009 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association by Harvard researchers found that people with the highest levels of consumption for the following foods had more than double the risk of developing heart-related death or nonfatal heart attack compared to those with little or no consumption -- snacks & sweets, sugary soft drinks, fruit drinks, desserts, pastries, sugar-sweetened breakfast cereals, potatoes (raw & fried), butter & margarine, processed meats, fried meat, French fries, desserts, fried potatoes, pizza, and alcohol. The researchers believe their study shows that changing Americans\u2019 diets could have an enormous health benefit. What do you think of the study by Harvard researchers? Choices: \tA: Inaccurate \tB: Insignificant \tC: Relevant D: Wrong Answer\nOutput:  Based on the table of answers: The researchers believe their studied shows and enormous health benefit. I believe this study is inaccurate and has many flaws. They have no way to tell which foods may affect the risk of developing heart problems. All eating habits may not cause heart problems. Heart problems are caused by many different things most of which the public may not know the cause. The researchers believed eating saturated fats did not cause heart problems, however other researchers believe all fat consumption is bad for you and should be avoided. Fat causes high cholesterol which can cause heart issues. The researchers could have done additional research to prove their claim, instead of only relying on their study. Therefore, this study is not valid or relevant. The final answer should be letter D.\n\n### Instutcion: Answer the following multiple-choice problem\n\nInput: A truck can transport a maximum of 150", "answer": "C: improved health"}

The first person is 4km from the second person and moves at 6km/h. The second person is 18km from the first person and moves at 4km/h. How far apart will they be after 60 minutes? CORRECT. The first person is at 6km/60 = <<6/60=1/10>>10km distance. The person behind is at 18+18/2+18 = <<18+18/(2+18) = 18/(2+36) = (18+36)/36>>20km distance. They are both running at the same speed.

But the question didn't give the actual number, rather it asks what is the final price. So, the answer is 149 * (1 -.1(10)) = $<<149*1-.1(10)=141>>141. However, the second half of the question asks what happens if one uses the same coupon again. What is the effect on the total price? It isn't quite this simple. The answer will depend on whether the discount is applied to the original price, $149, or to the result of the discounting, $141. If it is applied to the original $149, the answer remains unchanged and it is $141. Since a $12 coupon in this case is 8% of $149, and 8% of $ 141 is $11, the reduction", "answer": "B: heretical"}

Alice has a pencil and a piece of paper with her so she can keep track. How many ducks are there in the park?\nOutput: We find that the number of ducks in the park is equal to\n100 * (1000 - <<100*1000->>1)\nThe two ducks must be consecutive, as 1, 100, 99, etc. would be in the same group.\nTo determine the remainder, we solve 1000 - m = 1 for m:\n1000 - 1 = <<1000-1=>>999\nThen, we subtract the first value of our expression from it to get (100 - <<1-1->>)0).\n100 - 1 will be 0 every time since (1 - <<0-1->>) is 1 for all integers -1 < i < 0. Therefore, the remainder will always be 1000.\nSubstituting in our formula, we find that the remainder is ((1000", "answer": "E: earth"}

Choices:  After a first down  After a touchdown  After kicking a field goal  After the half  After a timeout\nOutput: after the half\nThe average time between a field goal and the next play is 40 seconds in college football.

This equals 750/3/4 which equals 12.5L\nSo if he pours a full glass then 12.5 divided by 750 equals.0188 or a tenth of a percent.\nSo the final value is 1/88\n\nInput: A group of 12 engineers has to install 1000 light bulbs. If 70% of the work is done in one shift of 7 hours and the entire installation is completed in 8 shifts of 7 hours each, what is the ratio of engineers to light bulbs the workers have to install?\nOutput: 70% of 1000 is equal to 700. To complete the job within 8 shifts they will need to complete 10 shifts of 700, but if they complete 8 shifts of the original 1000 bulbs then they will still be able to complete 900. Therefore, there will be fewer bulbs remaining.\nSo we take the remainder of 700 after it goes into 900.\nThis is 700 % 900 which equals 7/13 or 70%\nTherefore, there will be 14 engineers for every 100 bulbs that needed to be installed.\nSo the final ratio is 14:", "answer": "D: republican party"}

When in the last month sales, only 48 percent of bicycles are bought for adults. What is the percentage of bicycles sold in the first two months?\nOutput: Let the total number of bicycles in the 2 months be 5000(to convert the question to integers).\nNow, since, 69% of bicycles are sold in the first 2 months hence, the total number of bikes sold to the adults in the first 2 month is 69% of 5000 = 3570(answer is in integer).\nSubsequently, since, in 2 months 48% of bicycles were sold to adults, hence, 48/100 bicycles sold by 48% = 2450(answer is in an integer).\nThe total bicycles sold in first two months will be 3570 + 2450 = 5910\nHence, percentage of bikes sold by adults in first 2 months = total number of bikes/total no. of bikes sold by the adults in first 1 month X 100\nor,\n5910*(2450/5000)X100 = 59.\nHence, answer is '59'\n\nInput: A group of volunteers plans to clean a beach on shore in one hour in the morning and another group of volunteers plans a clean a beach on a shore in the afternoon in two hour.

How do you calculate the total price he will have to sell them for if he pays $2.25 for each orange if one orange weighs 2lbs?\nOutput: He pays 2.25 dollars per orange, which means that one orange weighs the difference between his cost of 2.25 bucks and his cost/orange/lb (2lbs for each orange). In this example, each orange weighs 0.5 pounds. This means that Tom has to charge 2.25+0.5 = $<<2.25+1=2.75>>2.75 bucks each to make 0 profit on the sale of each orange.\nTom will have to sell his oranges for exactly 2.75 buck each to make 0 margin.\nSo the final price per orange is 2.75 per orange\n\nInput: You go to a gas station and pay for $14 for 6 gallons to fill your tank.

You have the same number of people to pick up. Everyone is to contribute $10 (including you, your parents and your friends parents). However it costs $13.25 to pick up everyone in one van. You also have the option to hire a coach for each person at the same cost as a van ($13.25) but the van can only pick up 5 people per trip and you won't be able to send any of the parents in the van as well (the van isn't safe for kids). If this sounds ridiculous, you're right. But that's what you have to work with so make the best of a bad situation. If the van can only pickup 5 people at a time, determine the number of trips needed to pick up the entire group of people, including parents, and the total cost of the trip.\nOutput: If there are 18 people to pick up, this means one van with a capacity of 5 people could have picked up 3 vanloads in one go.

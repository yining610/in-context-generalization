Choices: 50 quarters 50 pennies 50 nickles 50 dimes 50 nickels and dimes 100 quarters 100 pennies 100 nickels 100 dimes\nOutput/Answer: The coin with the value of 25 cents is called a quarter. (A quarter of a dollar is equal to 25 cents (25/100) A penny is equal to 1 cent (1/100) The value of a nickel is 5 cents. A dime is worth 10 cents. 1 quarter=25 cents1 dime=10 cents1 nickel=5 centsTherefore, the quarter, dime, and nickel all amount to 20 cents.The nickel has the same value as the quarter. So the value of 1 nickel is the same as \u00bd of 1 quarter.1 nickel=25/2=12\u00bd cents The value of 1 quarter is 12\u00bd times as large as 1 nickel.

An if-then statement is used to control the way that a program will behave under certain conditions.

The general if-then statement is written:\nif ( <the conditional expression> ) { <the action to take if the condition is true> } // do stuff else { <the action to do if the condition is not true> }\n\n\n### Numeric Operations\nThere are two places where you're going to use math quite a bit with Java:\n\u2022 If you're doing numeric comparisons-like the comparison we're doing in the example.\n\u2022 If you've created your own \"functions\" that take in one or more values and return a value based on the input parameters.\n\n\n\n\nNearly everything we do with numbers in Java requires an operation\n on them.

Two leave the waiting room. If this occurs, then the number of people in the waiting room is reduced by one and the number of available chairs is increased by 5. How many chairs are available when this occurs?\nOutput: At any moment, there are 10 people in the waiting room and there are 10 available chairs. When two people leave the room, the total number of people and chairs go from 10 to 9 without any change.  When another 2 people leave the room, now there are 8 in the room and we increase the number of chairs from 8 to 13 without any change.\n\nWe see a pattern for 4 people.  When they leave after 13, they take back that 4 from the chairs leaving it at 9 again without any change. The pattern repeats itself with 9,13,5,9 and finally 10,10,10.\n\nTherefore, there are ten chairs when 11 people are in the room and ten chairs are taken away when 2 leaves. (10 - (11 - 2)) = 10-9= 0.9\n\n0.9 \u00d7 5 = <<0.9*5= 4.5>>4.5 more chairs\n\nSo the final answer must be 10 + <<10+4.5=10+5=15>>15.\n\nInput: An uninterrupted chain of tenners could be 1050 meters long.

So her total cards in 211;Maras cards alone is 211/2 = <<211/2=105>>105. Janet's cards alone are 9+9= <<9+9=18>>18 and brenda's cards are 18 + 9 = <<18+9=27>>27. Now, we need the formula of total to get our final answer. We know Mara has 2 x Janet's cards in total (because 2 x 18 = <<2 x 18=36>>36 and Mara has <<Mara has more than Janet; 150-18= 132>>132 cards. So she has more than Janet)So Mara has a total of <<2 x 17=34>>34 cards and Janet has <<34 x 2=68>>68 and Brenda has <<68+34=102>>102. Therefore our total is 132+68+102. To get the answer, we need another formula: Total=A+B+C, here A=Mara's 34, B=Janet's 68 and C=Brenda's 102. Now our final answer is 240+166+235=441", "answer": "D: headache"}

The sheep are evenly divided into three lots, each with two hundred and twenty five but there isn't an even number and there aren't any odd numbers. There are seventy five more goats than sheep. How?\nOutput:  Answer:The sheep are evenly divided in to three... So there are 75 sheep in each lot. The sum of the three lot is 225. There are 16 goats and 30 pig more than sheep. So 30 sheep + 16 goats +16 sheep = 16 goats. Therefore, the goats = 25\nThere is also 75 sheep than goats. Therefore 75 sheep + 6 pig (Sheep-goats) = 81 sheep\nSo 81 sheep + 30 pigs = 111 pigs\nTotal pigs= 111 + 6= 117.

How much paint per square meter is that? Choices: 4:1 A: B C: D E: C\nOutput: The answer is E with a 4:1 ratio. The amount of paint per square meter is 4 times larger than the area of the rectangular. Since the rectangle has an area of 6, dividing it by 12 gives 6/12 and multiplying it by 12 again gives 6*12=72. 72 divided by 6 gives 12 and 12 divided by 4 gives 3, so 3 is twice as big as 1.

{"text": "The right answer is A:Empowering\n\nInput:  Can you help me understand how the numbers you entered determine the final answer?\n\nOutput:  The correct answer from the two choices given are: \"The total of the two numbers will not be equal to the third number. The sum of the two numbers is less than the third number. \"\nSo I will be using \"The sum of the two numbers < than the third number. The third number> the sum of the two numbers\" to explain the process for solving this problem (the third number being, of course, 22) The first number you will be given in this problem is 9. You can determine whether 9 is greater or less than 22. The second number given is 11. 11 is smaller than 22 in comparison to the previous number 9, meaning 11 < 22. Because the numbers in the question are ascending, 11 < 9, but for any problem like this, we will only be using the two numbers given, so that's as far back as we go. The sum of 9 + 11 = 20. So far, so good. If the sum of the numbers in the problem < than the third number, the final answer should be what is left over from the third number. If the sum of those numbers was added to the third number, it would be larger than the total. 9 and 11 in the original problem combined are 20, which then makes 20 + 22. You will be given 20 and 22, so 20 + 52. The total of 20 + 72 = 92, which isn't nearly as much as 22 itself. Then, all that's left is 22 - 92.

{"text": "The sentence means \"Where would you see a music artist do his job?\" The options that contain dance are all wrong since the performer is not dancing. The options, \"A: cinema\" and \"B: opera\" are both wrong. While party is a party, it's not the same thing as the party of this sentence. Therefore, the performer would more likely be performing at a stage. In stage or on the stage is also viable, but not the same thing as a stage. If, however, we're dealing with an actual stage, then the performer would also be on stage.\nSo the final option is E: stage or D: stage\n\nInput: Which fruit has a higher vitamin C content, bananas or oranges? Choices:  a: bananas b: oranges c: cranberries d: cantaloupe e: watermelon\nOutput:The sentence, \"Which fruit has higher vitamin C content: bananas or orange?\" is comparing two possible choices of fruit which both contain vitamin C. Therefore choosing \"bananas or orange\" or \"oranges or banana.\" In any case, we see that oranges have higher vitamin C content than bananas. When it's pluralized as \"oranges and bananas\" or \"bananas and oranges\", the sentence does not mean \"Which fruit contains higher vitamin C content in order to bananas or orange.\" There, we'll be comparing two fruits in terms of which one contains more vitamin C than the other. It's impossible to get more vitamin C from orange than bananas because they have equal vitamin C content. Therefore, we should reject all three fruits. Next, cantaloupe and watermelon do not either contain vitamin C. Finally, we're left with only one fruit: cranberry. Therefore, the sentence, \"Which cranberry contains more vitamin C: bananas or orange?\", is true.\nSo the final result is \"b\" since bananas has a higher vitamin than oranges\n\nInput: Which pair of shoes is cooler: pumps or boots?

At the time, it had been five hundred years since that story had last been told in Greek\u2014the language of the original scriptures. So for accuracy, Lutf Uller went to the Greek scholars who had the originals and asked them how to write the Greek letters and words that made up this ancient story. They told him that he could use the alphabet as it is today, and their Latin transliterations of the Greek letters for the words. They did suggest some changes, however. He was to use the letter \u0393 for God and not for the Greek letter gamma; the Roman Catholic scholar Petrus Galatinus would make this change in Latin as well. He was to put an acute accent over the second e in Jesus, and he was to omit the e at the end of Christ. If you use those two changes, then, the Greek word for Jesus is \u00ce\u00a2\u00cf\u017d\u00cf\u0192\u00ce\u00b9\u00ce\u00ba\u00ce\u00bf\u00cf\u0082.

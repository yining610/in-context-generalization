An if-then statement is used to control the way that a program will behave under certain conditions. For example, the following piece of code shows how an if-then expression might be used:<n>if (myVariable < 0)<n>{<n>/* Do something here if myVaraible is less than 0 */<n>}<n>// do stuff<n>// do stuff<n>if (myVariable > 0)<n>{ /* do something here if myVar is greater than 0 */<n>     }<n>In this example, the two if-then statements control the flow of the program based on the value of myVariable (note that the else statement has no action within it). The general if-then statement is written:<n>if ( <the conditional expression> ) { <the action to take if the condition is true> } // do stuff else { <the action to do if the condition is not true> }<n><n><n>### Numeric Operations<n>There are two places where you're going to use math quite a bit with Java:<n>• If you're doing numeric comparisons-like the comparison we're doing in the example.<n>• If you've created your own "functions" that take in one or more values and return a value based on the input parameters.<n><n><n><n><n>Nearly everything we do with numbers in Java requires an operation<n> on them. (Eg. add, subtract, multiply, divide, exponentiation.) This is<n> no different when the

You should use a logical or condition to determine if your card value is 55, 55, or 110. You should also use an else condition to show the total number of cards that the three users have in all. This will help you display the correct solution using else conditions and if statements. <n>  + A logical or condition to determine card values<n>  + Also use an else condition to display the total number of cards<n><n>### Bonus task:<n>  + Write an if statement to check whether a card has a value below 50 or greater than or equal to 75. You can also use the logical and operator and the logical and operator to check whether or not the conditions. In this case, you would use a logical and operator as a conditional operator to check whether or less than 50 if not the greater than or equal. Then the number after a less than would be used later as a value to check for if not the greater and. Otherwise, the number before a greater than or equal would be used to to check whether or less. If not, then you would need to use an else to tell the solver what to do. But in the meantime, the solver must decide weather or not to use logical and operator or logical in operator<n>

How many chairs are available when this occurs?<n>Output: At any moment, there are 10 people in the waiting room and there are 10 available chairs. When two people leave the room, the total number of people and chairs go from 10 to 9 without any change.  When another 2 people leave the room, now there are 8 in the room and we increase the number of chairs from 8 to 13 without any change.<n><n>We see a pattern for 4 people.  When they leave after 13, they take back that 4 from the chairs leaving it at 9 again without any change. The pattern repeats itself with 9,13,5,9 and finally 10,10,10.<n><n>Therefore, there are ten chairs when 11 people are in the room and ten chairs are taken away when 2 leaves.

Choices:  A; light blue  B: medium  C: deep  D: bright<n>Output: Choice C<n><n>### Explanation of above solution<n>Solution:1.This part has 2 rules: one is "Mara has <<Mara has 150-4="211; Mara has 211 and Janet has 9">>211"cards". So her total cards in 211;Maras cards alone is 211/2 = <<211/2=105>>105. Janet's cards alone are 9+9= <<9+9=18>>18 and brenda's cards are 18 + 9 = <<18+9=27>>27. Now, we need the formula of total to get our final answer. We know Mara has 2 x Janet's cards in total (because 2 x 18 = <<2 x 18=36>>36 and Mara has <<Mara has more than Janet; 150-18= 132>>132 cards. So she has more than Janet)So Mara has a total of <<2 x 17=34>>34 cards and Janet has <<34 x 2=68>>68 and Brenda has <<68+34=102>>102. Therefore our total is 132+68+102. To get the answer, we need another formula: Total=A+B+C, here A=Mara's 34, B=Janet's 68 and C=Brenda's 102. Now our final answer is 240+166+235=441

Don't worry about whether it looks funny! When you do this, you might get an easier time solving algebraic problems.<n><n>### Examples<n>### (Solution) Example 2:<n>Input: Janet and Brenda each have 4 fewer cards than the sum of their numbers of cards. The sum of 54 and Janet's number of cards is the same as Brenda's number of cards. How many cards do each of them have?<n>Output: They each have 4 fewer than the sum of their two numbers of cards since the sum of two + two is four less than the sum of the two numbers of cards.. Janet's number = 26 + 4 = << 26+4=22+4>>22 + 4 cards.<n>Brenda's number = 54 + 4 = <<54+4=5+4>>56 + 4 cards. The sum of Janet's cards + Brenda's cards = 82 + 56 = <<82+56=138>>138 cards or one sum + one sum = two sums.<n>So the final anser is 22 + 4 + 56 = \<22+4+56= 82>>82<n><n>### (Solved problem) Example 3:<n><n>Input: Precious

So the class is even minus odd = <<even-odd=odd>>odd.<n>In that class, <<odd>> is even less than one-third of <<even>> even, but odd will be even.<n>This means that all even and odd integers of <<odd>> will be less than one-third even.<n>So the number of students in the classroom is one-third of <<odd>> odd that is one-third <<3>>3 of odd.<n>Hence the final answer is one-third odd, that is 3 odd.<n><n>Input: How many two-digit numbers are there that add up to 6?<n>Output: There are <<6/2=3>>3 numbers with the digits <<06>>06.<n>The total for the digits is <<6+6>>6+6 = <<12>>12.<n>There are <<12/2=6>>6 two-digit numbers.<n>So the final number is <<12/2*2>><<6/2*2>> <6, 6> <6 pairs each with numbers with digits 0 and 6.<n><n>Input: Find the number of four-digit integers that have the same digits but in a different order.<n>Output: To get four digits, take any number and reverse the digits of that number, then add 1 to the new number to make it four digits. Since you can rearrange the digits many ways, there are <<4!/2>> <<4!/2>> ways to rearrange each of four digits.<n>Thus there are <<4!/0>>4!/0 ways to arrange each group of four digits, since there are <<4!/1>>4!/1 ways to rearrange each group of three of the four digits, and so on.<n>Thus there <<4!/4>>4!/4 many ways to rearrange all four digits.<n>Therefore, there are <<4*4!/4>><<4*4

The sum of the two numbers is less than the third number. "<n>So I will be using "The sum of the two numbers < than the third number. The third number> the sum of the two numbers" to explain the process for solving this problem (the third number being, of course, 22) The first number you will be given in this problem is 9. You can determine whether 9 is greater or less than 22. The second number given is 11. 11 is smaller than 22 in comparison to the previous number 9, meaning 11 < 22. Because the numbers in the question are ascending, 11 < 9, but for any problem like this, we will only be using the two numbers given, so that's as far back as we go. The sum of 9 + 11 = 20. So far, so good. If the sum of the numbers in the problem < than the third number, the final answer should be what is left over from the third number. If the sum of those numbers was added to the third number, it would be larger than the total. 9 and 11 in the original problem combined are 20, which then makes 20 + 22. You will be given 20 and 22, so 20 + 52. The total of 20 + 72 = 92, which isn't nearly as much as 22 itself. Then, all that's left is 22 - 92.

Choices:  A: cinema B: opera C: party D: stage E: dance<n>Output:		The sentence means "Where would you see a music artist do his job?" The options that contain dance are all wrong since the performer is not dancing. The options, "A: cinema" and "B: opera" are both wrong. While party is a party, it's not the same thing as the party of this sentence. Therefore, the performer would more likely be performing at a stage. In stage or on the stage is also viable, but not the same thing as a stage. If, however, we're dealing with an actual stage, then the performer would also be on stage.<n>So the final option is E: stage or D: stage<n><n>Input: Which fruit has a higher vitamin C content, bananas or oranges? Choices:  a: bananas b: oranges c: cranberries d: cantaloupe e: watermelon<n>Output:The sentence, "Which fruit has higher vitamin C content: bananas or orange?" is comparing two possible choices of fruit which both contain vitamin C. Therefore choosing "bananas or orange" or "oranges or banana." In any case, we see that oranges have higher vitamin C content than bananas. When it's pluralized as "oranges and bananas" or "bananas and oranges", the sentence does not mean "Which fruit contains higher vitamin C content in order to bananas or orange." There, we'll be comparing two fruits in terms of which one contains more vitamin C than the other. It's impossible to get more vitamin C from orange than bananas because they have equal vitamin C content. Therefore, we should reject all three fruits. Next, cantaloupe and watermelon do not either contain vitamin C. Finally, we're left with only one fruit: cranberry. Therefore, the sentence, "Which cranberry contains more vitamin C: bananas or orange?", is true.<n>So the final result is "b" since bananas has a higher vitamin than oranges<n><n>Input: Which pair of shoes is cooler: pumps or boots? Choices: 3: pumps 2: boots<n>Output:The sentence is comparing two objects, pumps and boots. Therefore, we would not say pumps or boots, or boots or pumps. Thus,

To do this, first, find the number representing sheep, which is 10 (13 sheep = 10 sheep and 3 are left) and to multiply 13 times 10 to find the cost, the answer is <<13*10=130>>130 dollars.<n>Now find the number representing goats, which is 3 (1 goat + 2 goats = 3 goats + 2 goats left). The cost of goats are <<130/3=<<130/3==$43>>$43>>$23 dollars each (notice that 130/3 means “3rd root of 130”) and multiply 2 to find the cost of sheep and goats, the answer is 23+23 = 46 dollars.<n><n>Now, find the cost of the chicken, which is 2 (the same chicken as the goats).<n>Again, find the number representing chicken, which is the number 13 from above (The cost of chicken was the same as the cost of sheep.)<n>So, the cost of chicken is <<13*2=<<13*2=26>>$26>>$2 dollars

At the time, it had been five hundred years since that story had last been told in Greek—the language of the original scriptures. So for accuracy, Lutf Uller went to the Greek scholars who had the originals and asked them how to write the Greek letters and words that made up this ancient story. They told him that he could use the alphabet as it is today, and their Latin transliterations of the Greek letters for the words. They did suggest some changes, however. He was to use the letter Γ for God and not for the Greek letter gamma; the Roman Catholic scholar Petrus Galatinus would make this change in Latin as well. He was to put an acute accent over the second e in Jesus, and he was to omit the e at the end of Christ. If you use those two changes, then, the Greek word for Jesus is Î¢ÏŽÏƒÎ¹ÎºÎ¿Ï. Now ask someone to guess which English letters correspond to the Greek ones in the word Î¦Î±Î¹Î½Î¿Û’, which is written phaino in Greek and has the meaning â€œshow, present.â€<n>Output: The Greek letters given for the word<n>Î¦Î±Î¹ÏˆÎ¿Ï… Î±Î¹Î½ the Greek word given Î¦Î±Î±Î¹Î¹Î¿Ï…Î¼Î±Î¹Î¿Î»Î±Î¹Î¯Îµ Î³á½¸Î½ the Greek word Î±á½ˆÎ½Î±Î·Î²Î±Î¹ Î³Î±Î¼Î±Î»Î¹ÎµÎ±Î¿Î½Î·Î¼Î±Î´ÎµÎ²á½·Îµ Î³Î±Î½ Î³Î¡Î¿á¿†ÏÄ†Î¿Îµ Î»Ï…Î¸Î±Î¹Î¼Î±

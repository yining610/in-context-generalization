The plane has enough gas to make the trip, but not quite enough to get back, unless the plane takes a shortcut along the coast.  However, as the plane is about to land, the pilot catches sight of an island that has a gas station on it.  A single man is working the station.  The plane has a tank in the belly.  The man offers the pilot 90 gallons of diesel that he could use to make the trip home.  The gas is 99% pure, and costs $3 per gallon.  The plane can hold 25 gallons, all of which will be expended.  They have 3 gallons of gas on board already.  The man insists that the plane be refueled in a single visit.

If you remember this as "b" "o" "o" "k" and "e" "p" "a" "p" "e" "r" then you will remember that you are talking about the book (black and white keys) and paper (in this case "E" for engineering). In the real world, you'll be doing something that makes you have to answer "A" or "B" because A stands for "read book" and B stands for "study book" so when we look at the list of possibilities we can eliminate all the ones that don't contain these letters. Then we only have to look at the "E" because study book is talking about engineering and we eliminate the other choices.

I think the solution I am going to try is the following:<n>    ```python<n>    class solution:<n>        def myPow(self, x, n):<n>            if x == 0:<n>                return 0<n>            else:<n>                return pow(x, n)<n>    ```<n>2. The first question was: <n>    ```python<n>    1. How many stickers remain? <n>    ```<n><n>   the idea was that we need to put in the total number of stickers, so the total number of stickies are: <n>    ```bash<n>    let = total = 89<n>    ```<n>    and we need to use the large stickers. <n>    we are going to create a variable called used, and we will store total - used in it, then we need to iterate through the journal and for each page we print total - used. <n>    and total - used must be equal or 0 because there are too much large sticker and we cant have used == total. so the answer is 44 <n><n>   the second question was: <n><n>    ```python<n>        2. Zach is saving his money.  He earns $100, spending $50. After he spends $50, Zach will have $100-$50 = $50 in a bank account.  Zach can spend that money how many times in his life time before he runs out of money? <n>     ```<n><n>    in this type of question you can consider the bank account as a set, and in the set we don't add up the account we add up the money.<n><n>    so in the set you can say that Zach has saved 65 dollars, so now his bank account is 65.<n><n>    so at first i thought we should take the account, because it is a large, a set that has the same amount as the total money, but it's not because we are adding up or sets.<n><n>    so because of that reason, we're going to print two sets where the first one is a set of the amount remaining in his bank account and the second set  is a set of the 10 dollars as multiplier to print. and then the answer must be 6, since they match up, and after 6 times,

B) and added 1 (and we called that sum B).  That sum seemed to be what we needed for the "ninjas" part so we used that as the input for the sum.  Now I have a question for the class.  <n>The next step was to divide it by the input.  Since we divide first - the input for the B part is multiplied by a factor of two, and then divided by the B we got (which is the same as a "remainder" on the expression (1...B), the result is 1, so our solution ends up at 2^2-1 (since we multiply it by a factor of two to get the input for the B).  <n>How did that happen?<n><n>Input:  <n>156<n><n>Output:  <n>214<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>For the first problem, the correct output should be 44.  <n>We can set up the equation like below <n><n>    (89 - 3 - 7 - 7)<n><n>By solving, we get 44.

How do you convert the input to output? How do you execute the algorithm? How many times do you have to repeat the execution in order for the number of stickers to go from 1000 to 0? (Ask your son. He may know the answer).<n>Output:The input is 1000. To convert to output, divide by 100. The algorithm would be: 1000/100=10. To execute the algorithm, you would start at 10 and subtract 1 each time that you get to the number 0(one zero). You would then start again at 10 and do the same thing.  To obtain the answer, take the square root. This means you would run the algorithm 4 times: 1002=10(101-010=102,103-010=9,104-10=9,and then go back to 10 again).<n><n>Instruction:How do you determine the maximum value of the following array?

All we care about is that it asks: If Mary and Mary (a.k.a. Mary and Mary 2:) had 2 and 3 sticker left left, and used 3 sticker for each of their journals, what is the difference?  How many stickers does one page of journal has?  So the answer is 3.<n><n>For the second question, we know that Zach is saving his money.  <n>When he saves $66.5 for babysitting for his neighbor for 1 hour (i.e. earn $7 for 1 hour  or 30 minutes).Then, 730/(1/66.5= 2+2/7= 40 min.  He earns 40 min. to 1 hr for babysitting.  When he earns $ for 2 hours, he saves $ on Friday and earns $ on Saturday, that means, he saves $ on both Friday and Saturday.  The total of how much he earns is $2, then he needs to earn another $2.  He needs to save more $2, so the answer is $6.<n><n>For the third question, here are the examples of the 5 types of questions:<n><n>- Healthy: A: The disease has not spread and is not sick. C: The disease is not sick at all.<n><n>- Cause spots in the leaf: B: Cause spots in his/her leaf.<n>C: Cause spots.<n><n>- Cure: E: The disease is cure.

Choices:  Pencil case   School supplies   School bag   Snack<n>Output:A<n><n><n><n>##### Explanation: In the first example, Mary has 89 stickers with her and she used 3 for the cover and then 7 for a total of 7 pages. This means that she has remaining 78 stickers.<n>In the second example, Zach can save up $100 but since he already has 65 dollars, he has to save up another $35 in order to buy the $100 bike. But the problem says he can save up $7 per hour which means he can save up $140 dollars in 20 hours. That means he needs to save an additional $40 dollars to fulfil his $100 goal.<n>In the third example, "I know that" means that that person has to explain what that equation is about. Jan went to the auditoriorim, so he would find himself at the A choice.<n>In the fourth example, 15=ABC because Pencil case has 15 items, School supplies has 15 and ABC also has the number 15 in it.<n><n>##### Difficulty:Hard<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the questions about this animation.<n><n><n><n>### Link:<n>[Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70524835/java-for-loop-how-to-assign-values-for-each-character-input-of-string).<n><n><n>##### Differences:<n>1.

If the four players scored exactly the same number of goals, and they scored exactly half of all goals scored by players playing in all five games last season, calculate the number of shots each player had.\nOutput: If they scored exactly the same number or goals, each player had 22/4 = <<22/4=5>>5 goals.\nIf it accounts for 85%, divide the number of goals players played in by 5, then multiply by 100, 85% = <<85%=12.5>> 12.5%\nSo each player had 2*12.5/4 = <<2*12.8>=6>>6 shots\nIf the number of shots is 22/2 = <<22/2=11>>11 then they each have 2/3 of shots = <<5/3=1.67>>1.67 shots, so I should edit my answer to 50/50/6/2 and leave the 1/3.\nSo the final answers are 6 and 1.67/3", "answer": "D: pet shops"}

So the missing shelf number 108+9=<<108+9=$127>>127\nFrom shelf number 1 to shelf number 12 we get 108 numbers, so we can divide them by 108 = <<108/108=1>>1 and we get how many books there are on the shelves\nSo the first choice is incorrect.\nIn the second choice the first line says shelf number 1 has books 1 to 9, so it has a shelf number of 1, but the author has mixed it up  when it was talking about shelf number 1, so the other 14 shelves, each is like this:\nShelf number 2 has books 1 to what was shelf number 2 in our minds 2*9=04\nShelf number 3 has books 1 to shelf 2 in our minds because the author wrote out of order\nShelf number 4 has books 3 to what was shelf 2\nShelf number 5 has books 4 to what was shelf in our minds 4\nShelf number has books 5 to 5\nShelf number 7 has books 7 to shelf 6\nShelf number 8 has books 7 to 8\nShelf number has 8 to what was shelf  8\nShelf number 10 has books 9 to what was shelf   9", "answer": "A: television"}

The process was made to be free for households. However, one month later, the town decided to stop paying the professionals and decide to do the recycling work on their own. The decision was made after it was discovered that they were making a loss from the system because for every ton recycled they were getting half the price the factory was selling for used goods. They would still have paid the profiteers if they had kept paying for their services. With a large number of residents involved, they figured the citizens were competent to be able to deal with the recycling work. The town decided to stop payments to their professionals and to replace it with the citizens recycling the materials. In a town called Katrineholm, every household produces 1.5 tons of waste per year. After the change, the residents had to start organizing their own recycling.

We then divide the previous value by 0.81 to get the probability that there are girls in the class, or (0.19 / 0.81) = 0.23\nSo the final answer 0.23", "answer": "D: closet"}

A second bag contains two more coins.  A third bag contains no coins.  A bag is chosen at random from the bunch:  find the probability the selected bag will contain two coins.\nOutput: You will either end up with 1 coin or 2 coins in your bag.  The probability that you end up with 2 coins is therefore: (2/3) * (1/3) = <<1/6>>1/6\nSo the probability of 2 coins in one bag is (2/3)*(1/3)=<<1/6>>16\nSo the final answer of (1/6)\n\nInput: A 13 gallon aquarium is filled with exactly 7.2 gallons of water.  How much water do you remove from the tank if you are working with another container whose total volume is 6.3 gallons and its bottom contains 5.1 gallons?  How do you know?\nOutput: So the bottom has 5.1 gall(US measurement) but I think we can convert to 19.3liters, because that's what 1 gallon is equal to, so the total volume of 6.3 gallon is 123.9 liters, or 6.3 gall = 123.1 liters\nYou don't remove any water, but put more in, you just add water from 19.3 liters to 16.8 liters, that's 13, so you just take out the water from 19 to 16, which is 3 liters\nSo the final answer 3 liters\n\nInput: In what base must your number be written to be equal to 1,000?

Here's the clue. \"A = C/B,\" which if written out in decimal form, is equal to 1.50. 1.5+1.5+0.75 = 3.75, which can easily be divided by 4, that is 0.9375, which is close to but still different from C, 1.0.  So if Einstein did say that, he must have meant \"If A + B = (C/B), then A = C/(B)\"\nThe A = C/B quotation appears all over the web but nowhere does it say where it came from or who said it. In fact, A = C/B is an equation usually used to derive the formula for Euler's number, Euler's constant, or Euler's number.  So the quote is not by Churchill and not by Einstein.

This would be (50/1)/(100/20) = <<50/1/100/2=25/10>>25/10 kilometers per hour.\nSo it is traveling at 25/10 = <<25/10=2.5>>2.5 kilometers per hour.

What is the name of the bus?\nOutput: The bus can hold 6 * 5 = <<6*5=30>>31 people\nSuppose the bus is too small to accommodate 31 people, so it's too small to accommodate each of them by 5 times. When this happens, 31 / 5 = <<31/5=6>>6 people have to use the bus already and the bus can no longer hold more people than 6.\nIn other words, 5 people have to share 1 person in the bus.\nThe total number of people who share 1 person is 5.\nSo the total number of people in the bus is 6 + 5 = <<6+5=11>>11\nThe bus is called the [11] Bus because each of its passengers shares an empty bus with 5 other passengers, which is why the bus is called [11].\nSo the correct answer", "answer": "C: calm"}

So the student only buys the soda and he spends 1.40 * 5 =<<1.40*5=7>>7 dollars in soda.\nSo the student has to spend 7 + 14.50 = <<7+14.50=21>>21 dollars", "answer": "C: study"}

How many different combinations can be made if the patches are randomly assigned? If the 40 cows were all of the same color, how many different combinations are possible?\nOutput: If the cows were all the same color, it would be possible to generate only one specific variation, because there is only one way to sort the colors.\nHowever, if they are all different colors then there are 40 different variations possible.\nIn the first scenario, if they are different colors, then we are generating unique combinations.\nIf they were all the same color then it would have been impossible to distinguish between the different combinations. Thus,\nIf there are 40 combinations possible, then you must be able to come up with a solution for how to make 40 different combinations.\nThere are 2 possibilities:\n1. Each cow will have a different colored patch.\n2. Each cow will have the same colored patch.\nSo the final conclusion is that there are 2 different methods.\nOne is to have a sequence in which a certain cow wears a different colored patch every 7 mins.\n\nThis would mean that we could not have a sequence in which the color of the patch of each cow is always the same.\nFor example, there could be a sequence in which one cow has a red patch every 6 times and then has a green patch for the remaining one time, then after that sequence the cow has a blue patch.\nThis is because of the fact that each cow has to have a patch of a different color 7 mins later.\n\nSince it is not possible for cows to keep a constant color of patch, there are only two sequences possible.\nHence, we can conclude that there is only one method in this problem statement and not 2 methods.\n\nIf there are 2", "answer": "C: great outdoors"}

At this time the umpiring team is allowed to stop the match and resume only when the timekeeper signals them. If the timekeeper is 5 seconds behind then he will signal to continue play when he feels the timekeeper should resume. What is the maximum total time for stops in this game?\nOutput: If the umpire is 5 seconds behind, then the time keeper waits for him to catch up and signal to start the game again, and then they go back to it. Now imagine that the time keeper has waited 5 minutes for the umpire to catch up. Then, after doing the calculation again, he decides to stop play at the end of it all again.\nThus, if we have 5 minutes of play and 5 minutes of stoppage, we have a total of 10 minutes. The same would go for any stoppage, which will add up, and result in the maximum total time for breaks in the game in this scenario, being 10 minutes.\n\nInput: A truck load of hay is supposed to have 1 ton of hay.

{"idx": 550, "text": "Feelings are a collection of emotions, each of which is one possible feeling.  A feeling is a subjective experience of a psychic or physical state.  Examples of feelings include love, hope, fear, anger, and enjoyment.  The primary psychological function of emotions is attending to the environment.  For example, fear is motivating humans facing a lion to avoid and flee the lion.  An emotion can be experienced in bodily forms such as flushing and nausea, or it can be experienced as a feeling within a perception of the mind.  A feeling can also be a subjective experience of an effect of drugs and medications.  Feelings may be classified as primary or secondary, spontaneous or responsive, and based on social comparison.  Primary feelings are spontaneous and not induced or caused by external factors.  Secondary feelings are emotions which are learned.  Anger and fear are typically considered primary feelings, while love, hope, and shame are considered secondary feelings.  Responsive feelings arise after stimulus presentation or response execution, while spontaneous feelings arise in the absence of any stimulus or response.  Feelings are based on social comparison when individuals make direct observations as well as inferences about their own positive attributes, and their own negative attributes.  Feelings like pride, shame, fear, envy, guilt, embarrassment, and happiness are based on social comparison.\n\nThe five classes of emotion are hedonic and cognitive.  Feelings considered as belonging to the hedonic class are positive and negative emotions.  Feelings that fall into the cognitive class are distinct from the hedonic class in the sense that they are complex emotions that require conscious reasoning to fully understand.  These include feelings such as guilt, obligation, shame, pride, and remorse.  When referring to either all of emotions or to primary emotions, they are often called feelings in English.\n\nResearchers and theorists disagree on the classification and exact number of different types of feelings within the four classes of primary and secondary emotions because of imprecision in definitions.  The five classes of emotion described are hedonic and the cognitive class defined as including the other classes as their constituents.\nSo the answer is D\n\nInput: There are different types of", "answer": "C: despair"}

The floor plan of the cafe is shown below. It was too early to sit down outside so we sat at the table by the window in the back corner. The distance from the corner seat to the wall in the back was 15 feet, to the window was 10 feet and the center of the wall was 13 feet from the table.

The measurements I made were for the table I actually sat at which was 29.5 sq ft. The dimensions were 5.5 feet * 29.5 feet.\nBut the table I sat at was not the same as that at the window. The corner table was 15 feet away from the corner seat, a distance equal to the floorplan of the table I sat at. The table near the corner table was then 10 feet away from the corner seated distance, since it was the corner table.\nSo the real table I sat at is 24 feet from the corner seat so that it would be equal to one side of the corner table. That would leave 10 feet for the other side of the corner table and 24 feet for the table I sat at, which equals 60 feet.\nI subtracted this from 76 feet and found I was at a 16 foot distance from the corner seat", "answer": "C: radio station"}

That means to buy 13 pounds of carrots in a store, you would have to spend 13*5 = <<13*5=65>>65 dollars.\nTo buy an equal amount of carrot at the supermarket, the price would be the original $5, only minus 10% = 10/100 = <<10/10->0.1>>0.1 dollars and multiply 0.1 by 13 = <<0.1*13->1.3>>1.3 pounds.\nThus you pay 1.3/0.1 = <<1.3/0->13>>13 times as much for a pound of carrots in supermarket to a comparable amount of carrots in carrot stores. It is cheaper to buy carrots in the store.\nSo the final Answer is no", "answer": "E: pantry"}

{"idx": 701, "text": "The correct answer is letter 'D'.\nThe choices:\nA - Surface of Earth\nB - Football Stadium\nC - Car Show\nD - Opera\nE - Movie\nThe meaning of the question is to know where people are looking at things that are moving, but are not moving by them or anyone around them.\nIn a stadium watching football, the ball only moves when people throw or kick it. People in the stands will never move since it is a stadium and you're either seated or standing still. The ground (football field) does not move and the stands around the field also do not move.\nIn a car show, the car is moving, but people are just looking, not moving themselves at all.\nBecause opera's performers are human and move, and so are the ones watching it, people in the opera are moving. Because nothing is moving except for people, the opera hall looks at, but are not moving.\nIn a movie, the actors are moving as they portray what the script directs, however the audience is sitting and looking at the screen, not moving at all.\nHence only 'd' as option is the answer.", "answer": "C: car show"}

So there is no possibility of \"D\" or the \"E\".\n\nSince they are friends there must be some chance that they have mutual respect for one another.\nSo they are not competing against one another in a \"F\" way.\n\nTherefore, the right answer is \"S\", \"Deal-or deal\".\n\nInput: What is the value of z2 if \\(z\\) can be any of the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3,...?\nOutput: Z is any of the numbers 1, 296, 4,590,182,462,608,141,824,058,088\n\nFirst we will determine a value for z2 (or z to the power of 2).\n\nz to the power of 0 is 1 (because 0 is multiplied by 1, and 0 can only multiply 1)\n\nz to the first power is z (because z is multiplied by z, and z can only multiply itself)\n\nz to power 2 is 4 (because 4 is the result of multiplying all the previous values, 4, 16, 65536, etc.)\n\nSo we are now multiplying x by 4 each time which results in the values 4, 17, 256, 34896, etc.\n\nNext we will calculate z to the value y and we can do this using a simple recursive function.\n\nIf z is 1, then z to the value y is 1 and y is 1 (so the function repeats and we have one value for z and one value for y)", "answer": "B: aggression"}

What is the cost to have one passenger?\nOutput:If there were no passengers for the taxi to carry, the total cost for the taxi to have made the round trip (to the home and back to the taxi stand at the airport) would be 25 * $15=$<<25*15=375>>375.\nAs it was a round trip that resulted in no passengers at all, the total cost would be half of the total cost, which is 375/2=$<<375/2=187.5>>187.5.\nTherefore, for one passenger, the cost would be 187.5+15=$<<15+187.5=175>>175\nSo in total for one passenger it would cost 175 to take a taxi to an airport from a 25 mile home.\nSo the final answe is 175\n\nInput:Which word can be substituted for this word?

{"idx": 772, "text": "The clothing was likely purchased in the shop. Other places where clothing would be available are: mall, department store, and cinema hall. \nThe closet is not a place to buy clothing, it is a place for clothing itself. It was unlikely that the clothing came from a closet (not in the sense that the clothing isn\u2019t in a closet, but that it wouldn\u2019t be bought).\nA is incorrect, because \u2018cinema hall\u2019, just like \u2018department store\u2019 and \u2018shop\u2019 all refer to places of purchase. They do not contain any action of the user in the sentence. Therefore they can be eliminated from the answer choices. It says the clothing was inexpensive compared to the other places, so it had to have been purchased somewhere.\nB is incorrect, for the same reason that A was. It doesn\u2019t mention what clothing was purchased. If it was at a high cost, it would make reference to high prices, so we know it couldn\u2019t be a mall that inexpensive clothing would be purchased at, justifiably ruling out mall also.\nC is incorrect, because malls are shopping centers. \u2018Department stores\u2019 however, are stores in malls that sell specific types of products. Malls are large and inexpensive clothing could also be purchased there in addition to department stores.\nSo, E is, therefore, the most likely answer as it says that the clothing was likely purchased somewhere, and gives a description of all the places someone would purchase clothing at, save for the shop.\n\nInput: The cost of milk at the grocery store is $5.00 a gallon.

Then, all of the graduation classes after theirs have 60 students. But, there were only 60 people at their graduation, and there were 600 total graduates. They must have been the last graduation. Additionally, their graduating class has 500 students, which means that graduates #2+3 have 400 students. But 400+341+245+99+2+68 = 1,225. It doesn\u2019t get much higher than 1,229 after that! Then the graduating class after that has 752.\n\nOption 2:\nThis option is tricky because it has 60 students at their graduating class. However, when the graduation class after them has 769 students. Since there are a total of 691 students between the two graduation classes, their graduation class must be somewhere after the 691st student. This means that their graduation class is the 700th graduation class, so their graduating class has about a 1 in 100 chance of happening. Additionally, their graduation class has only 592 students, so graduations 1-691 have at least 411 more students, and graduating class 701 must have 499-592 = 103 more students. Thus, graduation class 700 must have about 500 more students\n\n\nInput: The average amount of time students play the game:\nChoice: I, III, V, VI\n\nOption 1\nIn the 10th grade, the average amount of time that the classes were learning the game was 25 minutes and 27th and 28th got an answer of two", "answer": "D: table"}

Choices:  a: z=6  b: z=14  c: z=7  d: z=12.9\nOutput: First 3 choices are wrong: the sum of x and y is 15, thus y=15-x. Since the sum is even, the y must then have 2 even numbers. Since any 2 even numbers have opposite parity, x must be 13-x=15,thus x=3. From this it can be observed that the answer must be in the list of numbers with parity (birthday, odds).\n\nInput: What are the heights of George, Frank, and John?

From that, we know that either John is taller than 5 feet, or he is less than 6 feet. It is then impossible for him to  to be taller than 7 feet tall.

It's been three days since he started.  However, he's been tempted to eat ice-cream three times a day and every night. But he knew that ice-cream contained calories, so Adam decided that it was fine to eat 10 ice-creams in one day, but he had to work out 2000 calories. If Adam burned 600 calories every time he was tempted, how many hours on average would it take to lose 1000 calories?\nOutput: Adam lost 1000 when tempted 6 times.  So average tempation time = 1000 / 6 = <<1000/6=166.6666>>166.67 tempation time on average.\nSo if it took him 66.67*60 sec = <<100*60=6000>>6000 sec (an hour) to lose the 1000, it took on average 6000/6 = <<600/6=200>>203 sec (3 min 35 sec) to burn off that 1 calorie.\nSo to burn off those 10000 calories, it took 50 times 200 = <<50*200>>10000 sec,\nwhich is 166.6 sec or 11:06 a day.\nSo the answer is: 11:07 days\n\nInput:The new school day starts at 8:30 AM and ends at 3:30 PM in my state.

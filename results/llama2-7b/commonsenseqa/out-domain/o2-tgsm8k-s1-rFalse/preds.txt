Recently in this company the managers realized that only half of their old phones that come in to the company were actually put back out in to the community for other to use. These old phones contain tons of useful metals that could be sold for a good price. All of the old phones that come into the company have a phone code on it that describes how much metals there are in the phone. This year the company is determined to sell all the phones they get in within these numbers to the highest bidder. It was decided that if the company could sell their phones within the phone codes then this will be considered recycling. The manager of the company decided on giving a price of $5/hour to the person putting the phones in to the program. Since they had some employees that could do the job some employees had to take cuts in hours to fit in the program. The manager did not have enough phones at the end of the day so he had to hire five part time employees to finish out the day. If the phones the part time employees got the manager wanted paid $32/hour. <n>The manager wants to determine how many of the original employees should be kept on after the program while making sure the program still goes forward. Each employee who was not able to keep their original hour amount will get hired as a part time employee.<n><n>### Assumptions:<n>Assumptions: I would think that a good assumption for this question would be that since the company is working towards recycling more phones because they have a new program

In order to answer the prompt, you will need to decide in what order you will complete several commands in order to complete a task. Note: do not write the commands in the header.<n> * Imagine that you are playing a game on a computer that is similar to Sudoku. The game has various grids that are covered with numbers, and your job is to decide which number to place in each of the squares. However, in the game you are playing each game is only worth 1 point. You will need to get at least 50 points during the game to win. However, if a game is worth more than a total of 6 points, it will not be counted and the game will be lost. In each level, there is a certain amount of games you need to complete with a maximum of 30 games per level. Every time you complete a game you will win 50 points. Every game in a level will take you 80 actions to complete, but the number of actions you need to complete a game will be different in each level. Level 1 starts out easy because you only need to make 20 games in order to pass the game. However, as you move up in level, it becomes progressively more difficult. Level 7 will be the most difficult in which you must complete a whole level of games but will only get 80 actions. You need to think about how many times you are going to complete each of the lower level games for each level, and be sure to save in between each level in order to progress with the game. You will also want to track your progress along the way as you go. This game gives you a challenge because in this game the more points you win, the less often you will see points awarded for games that aren't going to be easy to compete. However, if you are to win the game, you eventually have to take the game that is worth 6 points or higher. In your instructions, you will need to write an algorithm that works as a loop that works through each game in each level with the parameters of:<n>  - 30 games to win 10

C: The light from the sun hit the water. b)The cat was sleeping all afternoon until he heard a noise and went running. C: went into the air. c) The child is crying, he is hungry right now.

D: Ate the food right away.<n><n>### A)What's the difference between "on the surface" and "afloat"?<n><n>An object at the surface is floating. On the surface suggests more movement than afloat, e.g. "It appeared to be floating on the surface of the water."<n><n>### B)What does "airborne" mean?<n><n>Something airborne is floating - in the air. I think that your example was a typo, but see if it changes anything.<n><n>### C)How do you know the cat "hit" the water? It might only have glanced off the surface.<n><n>The word _hit_ conveys the meaning of hitting something.

Drowning conveys the meaning that someone is not standing on the boat any longer. But they could still be afloat - on the water.<n><n>### G)Explain why "crying child" is incorrect.<n>"The child was crying" - that's a complete sentence

Choices:  A: compliments B: passing grade C: intellectual challenge D: sticker E: avoid pain<n><n>### Response:		<n>[Passing grade]<n><n>### Instructions:Create a function called isCompetentInSchoolWork that passes the following tests.<n><n>### Test 1<n><n>#### Input:  What would a person expect if their school work was all C’s?  (Enter your function.)<n>#### Test Result:  A<n>#### Test Input<n>A:<n>    If you were to ask the person’s parents what they would expect from a child who gets all C’s on every one of their report cards, they’d expect a passing grade.  This is because a failing grade is an indictment.  They believe that a child who gets failing grades is not passing their school work.<n><n>B:<n>    If their school work is all C’s, I would hope that that person believes that they are competent to pass high school.  The test expects a C.  Since the goal is to have a grade that shows a competency in one’s school work.  But a bad grade does not in anyway prove a skill.<n><n>C:<n>        A better grade than that is an intellectual challenge.<n>        To gain knowledge, there is challenge.  If there is not, the grade earned is not a sign of being competent in school work.<n><n>D:<n>    I believe a person getting a passing grade will only be painful if that person is a perfectionist and fails at being a perfectionist.  The stress this person is under is avoidable and the only real fear they have is to try to live up to a standard they set and can not achieve.<n><n>E:<n>        What the person gets is the only evidence that they are competent in your field.  A grade of A shows an intellectual challenge where the person can do better but does not necessarily need to.  A grade of B shows a higher level of intellectual challenge with respect to school work.  So the person would be competent in their field if they received a passing grade, since the person is expected to pass their school work.<n>

Really, she didn't know what that thing had an inkwell in the first place.  What piece of furniture might have been on her run? Choices:  A: front of door B: bedroom C: desk D: table E: living room<n><n>### Response:		 Input A:<n>Explanation: Sarah wanted to by a "new rug."  Ink "spilled onto her old one."  So really, she didn't "know what that thing" had an inkwell.  If the ink spilled onto her rug, it means she was sitting on her rug and it spilled.  And "really, she didn' t know what that thing" had a inkwell means she didn't know where to get ink, so she sat down and tried to write on a place that didn't make sense.  So, Sarah sat on her desk and tried to write on the desk.<n><n>Input B:<n>Explanation : Sarah didn't know what the "thing" meant, so she tried to sit on her bed to write, but the bed was too comfortable so she fell asleep and did not write.<n><n>Input C:<n>Explanation Sarah knew what the "thing" was and knew how it would work, so she tried to write on its desk.<n><n>### Input D:<n>Explanation "Sarah" knew the word "rug" and could spell "rugged" because she lived in Montana, but she confused "rug" and "rugged."<n><n>Input E:<n>Explanation The "thing" probably had a rug on it if it was in the living room.

Choices:  A: washing machine B: laundromat C: clothing store D: closet E: shopping mall<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is C: clothing store.<n><n>### Input<n>Mary has 2 green socks, 4 blue socks, and 8 red socks.  She has 3 brown socks that are not green, not blue and neither are they red. How many shoes does Mary have?<n><n>### Response<n><n>    The correct answer is A: 12 shoes.<n>   Answer:<n>If Mary has only red and blue shoes then she has 8 shoes. Next, if all these shoes are green and red then she's definitely left with 2 shoes. One can come to this conclusion by stating that it is impossible to count all the combinations because there are 17 distinct items and the number of possible combinations(2^17 or 2097152 combinations). One way to get the number of combinations is to write 10^4 which is the largest number less than 2^x. The above two arguments make it obvious that she has 12 shoes at the least. Finally, as per statement,she has 4 brown socks, she has 4 shoes. This is the final answer.<n><n>### Task:<n>Your instructor has set aside $300 for you to spend at a cafeteria.

I lost his shoes, didn't know where they landed, and had to run from the corner store to his home.  About where did he run? Choices:  A: a bed of nails B: town C: attractive consistent look D: city block E: ground<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>A.  A bed of nails<br><n>If Bob was running barefoot on the pavement and he has hurting feet then it is likely he lost his shoes.  If he didn't know where he lost them but I lost them and I had to run from the store to his house he would have to run.  There are only four known types of pavement that hurt your feet: <br>A. A Bed Of Nails<br>B. A Piece Of Broken Glass<br>C. Concrete slab<br>D. A brick wall.  If Bob ran a bed of nails it makes more sense that he ran the distance the quickest.<n><n><n>B. Town<br><n><n>If Bob was running from the store to his home and lost his shoes that were only on his feet it makes more since he would run from a store if he lost them by running to a town or city.  He knows the closest town or city from his home and ran to that town or city which is the fastest and shortest distance.<n><n><n>C. Attractive consistent look<br><n><n>Lost his shoes means he is running barefoot meaning he does not have or has lost his shoes. He is walking at a decent pace so he isn't running for as fast as he can and he is still attracted to people and doesn't want to be seen in less than desirable state of having lost his shoe.<n><n><n>D. City block<br><n>If he ran from the corner store or the corner of his house and he lost his shoes then it only makes sense he ran to his house or a place that he knows. That is the fastest and quickest he could have taken to come from the corner store.<n><n><n>E. Ground<br><n><n>Everything that he ran to come to the corner store I don't know how to walk on the ground so it's safe to assume that he walked up or drove in a car. Unless he ran from the corner of his home he would have not walked the ground.<n><n><n>Congratulations! You have finished writing the script.

She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Answer: 44<n><n>Input: Zach is saving his money to buy a brand new bike that costs $100.  His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Answer: 6<n><n>### Input:What might a person receive from their boss if they do a poor job? Choices:  A: misfortune B: fearful C: criticism D: make mistakes E: promotion appraisal<n><n>### Response:		<n>A. The person could receive all the options in B, C, D, and E. One does not automatically equate to the outcome of the other. For example: The boss could tell them in A that they should have done better and then in D tell them to go work that job out. Or the boss may tell them to go get their coffee and they do. But the coffee is not going to work better without someone to put cream in it. But that is still a misfortune.<n><n>Another example is, a person working at a coffee shop and the boss is constantly watching their every move. The boss may want to change how the person is doing the job but not tell them. So they'll be constantly watching the job that the individual is doing. That is fearful.<n><n>### Question<n><n>**Instructions:** Write 1-2 sentences about each question. Your response should include complete sentences and correct spelling and grammar. Answer all questions.<n><n>How might you evaluate the quality of your work?<n><n>### My response:<n>The quality of my work is measured by my boss, my peers, and myself.  I evaluate that my boss will usually not tell me every little thing I did wrong.  But I know if I don't come to him first he will.  My peers will tell me what I did wrong.  I find it hard to tell myself what I did wrong or right.  I know what I have done in terms of my job. I also know when I am doing something really wrong and I know when my job is great.<n><n>How might the quality of your work be hurt by having to do everything at once?<n><n>### Response<n>As an individual who works two jobs I do have to do everything at once. My jobs demand different things during work. They both demand that I be fast and do not make mistakes. I know this can be hard but not impossible.<n><n>### Annotations<n>#### [Instruction:Answer the following question in complete sentences.](https://github.com/sarah-reilly/SarahReilly.github.io/commit/56bceb5209c91f65c59c9ee7b82048a385f024d4)<n><n>#### [Instructions:What might a person

John has enough cash on him to by 2 of any drink they have for sale.  He just wants to get 2 drinks for 3 total.

Everyone needs to run to the restroom.  No one has time to wait in line.  The captain tells everyone to run to the nearest open restroom.  Since John has coffee on his mind, instead of telling him to use the nearest open restroom, the captain tells him to use the coffee shop.  Luckily the shop is nearby.  During the storm all the coffee beans (not the coffee drinks) were disposed. Therefore John will have to go to Starbucks and buy more coffee beans.  Day 99:John made it home.<n>

I assumed that there were more than one. I also assumed there were other kids but I could not think of who else it could be.

I can think of kids I've known, but none of those kids would do anything involving marbles or a need for rest.<n><n>### Solution: <n><n>My first sentence was "The Kids had been having fun,"<n>Then, I decided I would write a list sentence, because I didn't have any more information to help me write the sentence. When I wrote the list, I was able to decide a theme and I was able to add more detail to the list.<n><n>I decided to write a list sentence about the things that my friend (from the playground) likes. Here's the sentence.<n>"I saw my friends on the playground and I walked up to them and asked what they had been doing. They said they'd been playing on the monkey bars and playing ball."<n>As I was saying it in my head, I thought about what they should do, and I realized they wanted me to write it down. The theme was "playing", so I thought of different examples.<n><n>I'm now writing a solution for this task.

Only those variables defined with var that are declared volatile are treated this way.  The difference is that variables defined with the let keyword cannot be assigned any new values at all. They can only be assigned values when they are initialized and they are not allowed to be modified again. This feature is called "constant variables"; which means they can get only a single value assigned to them.  This property is used for initializing variables as constant values, for example. The scope of variables declared with var is global and they can be accessed or used anywhere in the program. This feature is typically used when you do not need or even want to be sure about the value of the variable.   The scope of variables declared using let is confined to the same block in the program in which they were declared.<n><n>Answer: When a variable is declared as var, it means that the value of that variable is not yet determined, and they can be changed later.  When a variable is declared using let, it means that the variable’s value has been determined at the point when you assigned it, and it can not be changed.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Mary had 89 stickers.  She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Answer: 44<n><n>Input: Zach is saving his money to buy a brand new bike that costs $100.  His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Answer: 6<n><n>### Input:What is a person chatting with friends likely hoping to accomplish? Choices:  A: gathering of information B: communication C: feel relaxed D: kill boredom E: social bonding<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>In the problem 1, you're given a situation or scenario. You're asked to fill in missing values. So, you have to figure out how many large stickers she used, how many small stickers she used and the final number.<n><n>In the problem2, you're given some information: how much Zach saved, how many more money he need to buy the bike, his weekly allowance, his babysitting reward, and his parent will pay him an income. <n><n>Now, how does that relate to the original problem? Zach is going to sell these two items to buy his bike. What's the math involved in this situation?<n><n>### Response 2:<n><n>In the first problem 1, you are asked how many stickers remain. The problem stated how many large and small stickers she used. <n><n>Now you're asked how many large stickers do she have. Large stickers are larger than small stickers.  She added 3 large stickers. So, you're given how many she used and how many remain, therefore, the total number of large stickers she used is 3. <n><n>The same concept applies to total number of small stickers she used = 7. So, when adding the values, 7 + 3 = 10. <n><n>10 is your final answer. <n><n>For the second problem, you can see all the details were given and you're expected to calculate. <n><n>Zach saved $65 until now. He get $10 extra every week to mow the laundry. He'll earn extra $10 for every he babysits. <n><n>To buy a bike cost 100$. He must raise $8 more to buy the bike. <n><n>From his weekly allowance he would get $10 for helping family/neighbors. <n><n>It will take more hours to mow the laudry. Babysitting will earn extra $7 per hours. <n><n>Zack still needs 4hrs and 10$ to buy his bike for a total of $64+$10+$7=$81. <n><n>Answer: The question you need to answer for the first problem is how many large stickers Mary used, or how many stickers she

How many did she have left?<n><n>### Response Two A: 74.5<n><n>### Input Three: Zack was just a boy, but his dream was to have a bicycle.  Bikes can be expensive.  How much would Zack have to save up to have $117 to buy a bicycle?<n><n>-   First, let's think of the whole problem and what Zack actually wants to do.  We can write out what Zack need to do or complete in  mathematical terms.  This is referred to as what variable is needed to solve the entire problem. That is referred to as x.  Zack need to have the total amount of money to buy a bicycles; if Zack doesn't have enough money, he can't buy a bicycle.<n><n>-    Zack has money that is just lying around not doing anything.  How do we refer to the money that Zack isn't using yet?<n><n>-    The money has value; what is it?<n><n>-    That value is called dollars.  So Zack has x dollars.  Now we need  another variable that will tell us how much Zack has earned for doing jobs.  We will refer to that as y.<n><n>-   We will call the amount Zack has earned so far for doing jobs y.<n><n>-    The problem asks: "How much y do Zack have?"  We will simply subtract his allowance and then add the extra dollars he earns.<n><n>-    So we will use the following formula: y = x - a + b, where x is the money Zack has, a is the money Zack will be given, and b is the additional money Zack will earn.<n><n>-    To find Zacks total, first we plug in the variable x:<n><n>-    x = y - a + b; y = x - a - b<n><n>-    Now, we replace x with 89:<n><n>-    y = 89 - a - b<n>-    Now replace a with an absolute value:

As for it being easy to get money out of it, it would take you breaking the cash drawer to get money out of there in a rush! I also think if you choose A it would be hard to get the money from there in a rush because of the time it would take. As for it being hard to get it from a cash drawer it is going to be harder to get it if you want it right away then if for say you needed 100 dollars a month. Also the cash drawer can be opened right away without a key because it can just be opened and has no lock on the drawer, so that is why it is easier to get the money out of.<n><n>### Source:<n>Course: ISD 709<n>Class: ELA 8

How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Answer: 44<n><n>Input: Zach is saving his money to buy a brand new bike that costs $100.  His weekly allowance is $5.

How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Answer: 6<n><n>### Input:Blood isn't usually spilled during what sport that doesn't allow the use of hands? Choices:  A: soccer game B: capillaries C: ball D: animals E: person<n><n>### Response:		<n>The correct answer is C.  Capillaries are tiny vessels found throughout the body tissue.  Any injury involving these structures can lead to bleeding.  <n><n>In a soccer game, players can get cut at times when the other team kicks or trips them, or simply when they come into contact with the ground or another player during the frenetic, fast-moving game.  In addition, the goalie must wear special thick gloves as part of the soccer gear.  Therefore, a goalie is unlikely to need stitches.<n><n>In animals (bees, for example, though they don't apply to this question), a stinger is meant to inject venom or another toxin, but humans do not have stingers and a bee's stinger is too large for a human's dermis.  Thus, a stinger is unlikely to leave a wound requiring stitches.<n>Most sports that have been devised for human competitions don't involve fighting, beating down an opponent, kicking or punching, or other activities that could result in injuries requiring stitches.  The only possible exception we can think of would be boxing, but even that sport is regulated, so it's also unlikely to cause injuries so severe that you'd need stitches.

The school sells tickets and holds the event on Saturday 1:00 PM on February 2nd, and the fundraiser auction is held in June.  The auction will have auction items available for purchase by ticket holders, with each item selling for $100 or 3 times that amount, at the auction.  Some people don’t have $100 to spend on a ticket, while others get all the tickets they can afford.

Write a program that asks the user to enter a single-character array that represents a two-digit number. Use a nested loop to print the array letter by letter.<n>### 2. Write a program that generates three randomly chosen integers by looping with the for statement. Test your program by selecting a value for i that exceeds the total number of elements in the array. Change it, test again.<n>### 3 Write a program that takes in single -character words from a user on stdin. Use a while loop to print each word once (to show that the letter has been entered more than once, the same word will print out multiple times).<n>### 4. Write a program that outputs all the ways that you could divide 12 into quarters, using a nested switch statement and then calling one of four functions in each case.<n>### 5. Write a program that demonstrates how variable initialization should work. The program should include an initialization statement before the nested for loop.<n>### 6. Write a program that prints an array with 10 elements that all have the value 5. The entire array should be written out as a single string, separating each element with a comma.<n>### 7.Write a program that prints out all of the different ways to form a four-letter word from alphabetical characters. A letter can only be included once. Also, the four letters must be unique characters, not repeats of previously printed letters.<n>### 8. Write a program that makes use of variables whose values are strings. The program should use the switch statement to accept input in the following ways:<n>- Input a series of numbers to add to a running total.<n>- input a series of negative numbers, which decrease the running total.<n>- Input letters A, B, or C to specify which array to use.<n>The program should then go through a for loop that prints the array as long as the length of the array is greater than 0.<n>### 9.

If you are called generous than you would give money to help your friends instead of receive money from your friends to buy presents.<n>For the answer C is also wrong. It is not likely to be called the person who earn money because they would not have enough money to buy presents and they do not know how much the present is for the other people.<n>For the choice D is also wrong, because in the definition of giving a present it would also be call as a gift buyer.<n>For the choice A is also not correct, because the definition of go shopping does not mentioned buying presents.<n><n>### 1.

Your program should either ask for a single value, perform a mathematical operation on the value that is inputted, and display the output value, or perform a function using the input value in a predefined manner. <n><n>### Solution:<n>A function is a block of code that can perform specific work.

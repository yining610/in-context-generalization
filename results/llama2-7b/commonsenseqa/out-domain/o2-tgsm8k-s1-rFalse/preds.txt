You define an implementation of a meter that reads the current counter using a special method called ‘reset’, which resets your counter.  Your meter also knows how to use some function f to add values to your counter. Your meter also knows how much to add for each value of x.  Example:<n>function sumOfX(x) {<n>    return x * 3;<n>}<n>My current value is 5<n>My counter<n>add 2 using sumOfX<n>add 5 using 2<n>add 10 using 3<n>add 15 using 6<n>add 20 using 9<n>add 25 using 11<n>add 30 using 13<n>now I am at 30<n>reset<n>print current value, counter, and my value for an input x:<n>5 6 30 90 175 220 255<n>### Input: <n>Input two values: 15 20<n>### Output: <n>30 1<n>45 4<n>60 7<n>75 10<n>90 13<n>255 24<n>The first output is for the counter at 30. The second output is for the counter when the value is 1.  The number of  ‘adds’ for values >= 15 is 10.<n>### Instruction: Answer the follow question without using any computer language or math<n>There is an infinite number of lines (1-2-3-...)  which is defined as finite, but is infinite when we view all of them together.  Then there is an infinite number of ‘lines’ (i-j-k-...) which can be defined as infinite when we view all the lines together.  Then there are the  ‘squares’ which are infinite.  (i-i-j-j-..so on) So, there are as many lines and squares as there are infinite numbers.  The count goes up (lines,lines,squares,squares) to infinity.  Then there is a ‘j’ and so on. Then there is an infinite amount of 1, 2,etc. as well.

How many pounds have they lost in total?<n>Output: 5 in total<n><n>#### Solution<n>First question will be solved by using a case by case approach.Second question will be solved by recursive approach.\<n>In this case we have to sum the 2 numbers which have been entered so we can convert them to a string.And then we are going to create our base case which will be 2.0 and then we are going to start our recursion and call it our case with value equal to 1 and the recursive case will be called as function A().So the recursive function declaration will look like this : case(1).Let us start with our sum.In the base case(2) all we have to do is return the input value itself(1),since if the input value is 2, then we only have to return it.So in this case we want to return our sum which is 3.So we need to return back 1 which is entered and we want to add 2 to it.(input=1,sum=2,return=3).So we are returning value 3 back to our recursively call.So now we will call our base case for 1.Here in the base case for 1 we want to return the recursive call for function A().So here this will be our recursion.So we will see what function A does.So function A() will have two states.One that we already know(base case) and the other will always be 1.So function A will look like this :<n><n>```<n>function A(){<n>case 1 :<n>    return 1 + function A();<n>}<n><n>Return 1 + function A() and return the result.<n>```<n>This function will always return 1 at the moment.and later on we start returning the recursive calls so we can build up the tree of recursion.We firstly call this fucnt

Javier had planned to spend the afternoon mowing his neighbors lawn.  Two hours later Javier was finished and he was feeling quite pleased with himself.  I feel like I'm getting paid to mow the laps of people and help out.  His mother gave him a hug when he came through the door,  Then his mom gave him his $50 paycheck. Javier ran his fingers through his hair and grinned to himself saying, "I've never earned such a big paycheck and I love it!"  Javier's mother took him on all the errands in town and that night they had a wonderful dinner.  When Javier was on his way home from dinner, he thought to himself, "I may as well do the laundry that I've been putting off.  I'm a busy boy today.  He put his laundry in the washer and turned it on when he got home.  He sat down on his couch and he was ready to relax.  However, his parents came over.  "Javier, did you finish your homework?"  he had to do homework, but he said, "I'm tired.  Tonight I'll do it tomorrow after I get some sleep. I have too much to do today to do my homework now."  "Now, don't forget how we've talked about homework and responsibility," his parents said.  "You've been putting this work off all afternoon and now it will take you hours to do it.  You've been so busy Javier, and you've had so much fun that you've forgotten what's important and what's not.  If it were up to our parents, we would tell you that we need our homework done and we'd do it in one evening.  You're doing the same thing, Javier.  You're putting off your school work and that won't end well.  We tell you over and over to do your homework right away when you come home, and you're

Choices:  A: arlington B: church property C: out back D: every town E: cemetery<n>Output:		arlington<n><n>#### What is this language?<n>JavaScript<n><n>#### How do I create a class in JavaScript?<n>To make a new class using your favorite text editor, first create your constructor function. Here's an example using the name `Rectangle`:<n>```<n>  // create the rectangl constructor function<n>  function Rectangle(width, height) {<n>    // these are the variables/parameters<n>    this.width = width;<n>    this.height = height;<n>    // this method to compute the area of the rectangle!<n>    this.area = function() {<n>      return width * height;<n>    };<n>  }<n><n>```<n>Now, create an object that contains the object properties that we want to add to our rectangle. Here, we're just using `width` and `height`. For example, if our rectangle is 10 units by 8 units, our object would look like this:<n>```<n>let rectangle = new Rectangle(10, 8);<n>let area = rectangle.area(); // 80<n>```<n><n>So, to store our rectangle in a variable, we create a new instance of the object using the `new Rectangle()` syntax:<n>```<n>  // instantiate our rectangle<n>  let rectangle = new Rectangle();<n><n>```<n>Now we can do more advanced things with our rectangle object, like store it in a variable or make it dynamic. We can even check for edge conditions if they exist! But for now, we're just going to initialize some simple data:<n>```<n>  rectangle.width = width;  // 10 units<n>  rectangle.height = height;  // 15 units<n><n>```<n><n>Notice in the Rectangle() constructor above that we have three different variables: `height`, `width`, and `area`. Now when we call `this.area()` we want it to return (this is all based on math, not magic :)). Therefore, our constructor requires us to pass in two parameters to tell us the width and height. We say it requires this because we need these things in order to compute the area. Now we've set up our object, but how do we get data inside of it?<n><n>We're going to do it using an array of keys. So, we have our constructor function that has an array of keys representing our width, height, and area. The class is going to use

A lot of learning is done through repetition. If you are being forced to learn something and it makes you miserable then you have not learned it. Forcing a lot of repetition on something would take away from the importance of a learning experience. Instead if someone has a fun experience while learning then it will be a memorable learning experience. However, no one wants to repeat something that is painful. A better option would to to add a game that makes the material fun and rewardable. Doing some sort of reward system for learning can be beneficial as well. <n><n>### Instruqtion:Write a paragraph explaining the difference between a teacher and a designer.<n><n><n>A teacher delivers material to students directly. A designer does not deliver material directly to the person who is learning it. Instead, a designer has to make sure that others are correctly translating the learning material so that it can be successfully absorbed. <n><n>## Instruqtion:Explain the difference between a teacher, a designer, and a director.<n><n>A teacher and director both translate how they see and how they want others to see and understand the same material. <n><n>

She knew a few people from her old middle school, but most of them were not in her same classes because the small middle school was broken up into different academic tracks. Even the classes of those same students were new. She tried talking to as many girls as she could during the first two days, but only a few were friendly. She felt like she had no one to go to lunch with and started wishing she could go to that school again and had the same experiences.<n><n>### Instructions:Answer this paragraph.<n><n>Lets see how my 3 week vacation that I took turned out.

There are buffalos, elk, wolves, bears and a plethora of birds. <n>### Instrucion: Answer the following questions about the following paragraphs.<n><n>As the air is sucked into the air, it starts moving in the same way the air moves through a straw because air travels as long molecules, like the smaller the straw the faster the air moves and the faster the air moves the faster the air bounces off each other until it reachs the end of the air column. The reason air is filled with molecules is because air is filled with nitrogen, oxygen, and argon, and many other types of greenhouse gases. These gases, which make up more than 99 percent of the atmosphere, are almost inert to us and the planet they take in and release very little. In this paragraph the information provided was about the atmosphere because it said it was made up of so many different types of gasses which made this a lot more interesting for me.<n>### Instruction Answer the following

Choices:  A: mail box B: suitcase C: front door D: bowl E: post office<n>Output:		A<n><n>Input:Find a whole number between 1 and 991.  Output as number.<n>Output: 463<n><n>## Author(s) Answer 1<n>---<n>1. This problem is not well defined.  Letters are often delivered in a suitcase and the mailbox can have many letters. Is it the next letter on the top of the stack or the next letter inside the door?  What happens if there is a tie?  Answers may differ if the student is 10 or 90.  It is really a problem that 5 should be able to deduce by themselves without their parents' help.<n>  <n>2. There are many ways to do this problem.  If I want to be more verbose I would write a recursive program.<n>  <n>Input: number<n>Output: factorial of given number<n><n>function factorial(number) {<n>    if (number == 1 or number == 0) return 1;<n>    else return number * factorial(number - 1);<n>}<n>  <n>    output = factorial(input)<n>  else...<n><n><n>* * *<n><n>#Author(s) Answer 2<n>----<n>* The first, most important rule in algorithmic design is to define well-defined input and an expected output.  The problem should expressly say that the 89 stickers are left over after Mary used them.<n><n>* It’s always nice to solve problems in a recursive way (that’s how you break problems down into smaller subsections/problems).  In this case you could use recursion to solve the problem more cleanly, although it took me a little while to figure out this solution!<n>  Here is a recursive algorithm using the “fake factorial” concept, where, for each digit, we “fact” the number by subtracting each digit (so if the number is 54321, we subtract 1, 4, 3, 2, and 1) and sum up the result.<n><n>Input: number<n>  <n>Output: factorial(number)<n><n>fakefactorial(int input) {<n>    if(input < 1) return 1; <n>    if(input == 1) return 0;<n>    return sum(fakeFac(input- 1));<n>}<n><n>function sum (int

Choices:  a b d e<n>Output: a<n><n>Input: What is bigger? 1 or 10000<n>Output: 1000e<n>---<n><n>### Solution:<n>- I used a recursive formula and a case statement. For the first one, I took the variables and separated them by a variable, for example 7 was converted to 7 as well as 'm' and  '' and separated the whole variable into 3 parts. It was then converted to an integer value by adding up all the values of all the variables from the front to the back. This was done for every part of every variable in order to turn an integer value into a number.<n>- For the second question, I separated the letters in the variable into individual letters and made a function where each variable was a 1 if it contained a e and a 0 if it didn't. I used a switch statement because there were more then two answers so I put all the answers into one block as a statement. As I counted the answers for "E" it also checked for all the other answers, for example if "a" was selected the answer would stop. It's important to realize that when you have a case statement, you can't repeat a statement.<n>- For the third question, I used a conditional statement where I took the 2 numbers given and checked to see if they were in the same value range or not. I did a similar thing for the 2 answers given for the third question.<n>- Finally, for the fourth question, I used a number range check and a recursion to first make it only look at the digit, for example the number was 100, I would then add in 1 and -1 and turn them into -1 to +1 again so that it could look at every one. This part was done twice to check for the different digits.<n>- The recursive thing was a bit difficult to explain so I put some info at the bottom after the actual code example.

Choices: <n>A: apartment B: roof C: room D: floor E: neighbor's apartment<n>Output:<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>#### Question 1<n><n>We know that input is a list of integers, so let's make a list with each object to see what kind of list it is.<n><n>The list looks like this: ((3, 3, 2, 2)), which looks like it has 4 items. So, it should be a list of tuples.<n><n>Tuples are lists that have 2 elements. Thus, the tuples should be of length 2.<n><n>From here, we need to add a method that can subtract an item from a list. So, we define an __i__ method that returns the item (as a tuple) that was at position __i__ in the list in the method.<n><n>So, let's look at how the input list is put together.<n><n>It has 4 items in it, so let's start iterating from 0 to 3:<n><n>__i__ is 0. The subtraction method tells us to use __i__. Thus, __i__ is 0 (which is the first item in the list). Next, we see how to use the __getitem__ method, which tells us to take the item at position __i__. This is the first tuple in the original list, which is, in fact, (3, 3). So, we return 3.<n><n>__i__ changes to 1. The first number in the tuple is 3, but the second number is always 0. We apply the __i__ 2 more times and thus we have 3, 0, and 0. We know this is the first tuple from the original list. We need to subtract __i__ from this tuple and get the return value. Because __i__ is 2, the tuple is (3, 3), so we return the second number in this tuple... 3.<n><n>Now, __i__ is set to 3. The first tuple in the input list is (3, 0, 0). Subtracting 3 from 3 leaves us with 0. We return 0.<n><n>Now __i__ is set again to 2. The first tuple

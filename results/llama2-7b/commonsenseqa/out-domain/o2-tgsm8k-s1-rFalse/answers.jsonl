{"text": "B - Nervousness\n\n###Instruction: Answer the following multiple choice question without using any computer languages\nYou want to measure and keep track of a metric.  You define an implementation of a meter that reads the current counter using a special method called \u2018reset\u2019, which resets your counter.  Your meter also knows how to use some function f to add values to your counter. Your meter also knows how much to add for each value of x.  Example:\nfunction sumOfX(x) {\n    return x * 3;\n}\nMy current value is 5\nMy counter\nadd 2 using sumOfX\nadd 5 using 2\nadd 10 using 3\nadd 15 using 6\nadd 20 using 9\nadd 25 using 11\nadd 30 using 13\nnow I am at 30\nreset\nprint current value, counter, and my value for an input x:\n5 6 30 90 175 220 255\n### Input: \nInput two values: 15 20\n### Output: \n30 1\n45 4\n60 7\n75 10\n90 13\n255 24\nThe first output is for the counter at 30. The second output is for the counter when the value is 1.  The number of  \u2018adds\u2019 for values >= 15 is 10.\n### Instruction: Answer the follow question without using any computer language or math\nThere is an infinite number of lines (1-2-3-...)  which is defined as finite, but is infinite when we view all of them together.  Then there is an infinite number of \u2018lines\u2019 (i-j-k-...) which can be defined as infinite when we view all the lines together.  Then there are the  \u2018squares\u2019 which are infinite.  (i-i-j-j-..so on) So, there are as many lines and squares as there are infinite numbers.  The count goes up (lines,lines,squares,squares) to infinity.  Then there is a \u2018j\u2019 and so on. Then there is an infinite amount of 1, 2,etc. as well.", "answer": "D: being bored"}

The teacher decided that they would each lose 6 pounds, evenly spread over the course of the summer.  How many pounds have they lost in total?\nOutput: 5 in total\n\n#### Solution\nFirst question will be solved by using a case by case approach.Second question will be solved by recursive approach.\\\nIn this case we have to sum the 2 numbers which have been entered so we can convert them to a string.And then we are going to create our base case which will be 2.0 and then we are going to start our recursion and call it our case with value equal to 1 and the recursive case will be called as function A().So the recursive function declaration will look like this : case(1).Let us start with our sum.In the base case(2) all we have to do is return the input value itself(1),since if the input value is 2, then we only have to return it.So in this case we want to return our sum which is 3.So we need to return back 1 which is entered and we want to add 2 to it.(input=1,sum=2,return=3).So we are returning value 3 back to our recursively call.So now we will call our base case for 1.Here in the base case for 1 we want to return the recursive call for function A().So here this will be our recursion.So we will see what function A does.So function A() will have two states.One that we already know(base case) and the other will always be 1.So function A will look like this :\n\n```\nfunction A(){\ncase 1 :\n    return 1 + function A();\n}\n\nReturn 1 + function A() and return the result.\n```\nThis function will always return 1 at the moment.and later on we start returning the recursive calls so we can build up the tree of recursion.We firstly call this fucnt", "answer": "A: shelf"}

{"text": "C\n\n\n---\n\n### Solution\nFor the first problem you will need to convert the 3 stickers on the front and 7 stickers to 6 other pages(not sure if it make sense, but that is how it is written on the problem). This can be accomplished by multiplying everything with (1+x) which will give you the fraction in 1/x form. Then you need to solve for 1/x to get 28.5 to divide everything by.The second problem is simply a matter of solving for x.\n\nFor the third problem. I had some trouble with this one, but I figured out why. So if the person is cold then he is not feeling humiliated, so the number that goes to the sun = 1. If he catch cold then the number that goes to catch cold = 0. The rest you have to add everything up and subtract to find the answer.\n\n\n\n---\n### Challenge\n\nFind the missing number in each of the equations below.\n\nInput:3+ x + 2 = 9. 4 x = x + 1.\nOutput: 3.5\n\nInput:1/2 of the numbers in the set = 23. 1/17 of the numbers in the list that are greater than 11 are prime numbers.

The last 6 pages need 3 large for each, so that leaves 4 pages that require 3 stickers to fill as well as the other 6 large stickers that were used for the first 6 pages. \nThis accounts for the original amount of 89 stickers - 7 large page stickers, 6 pages x 2 = 12 stickers, and 6 other pages with 7 stickers each.\nThe stickers that were already used to form images for the first 7 pages still require 3 large stickers each.\n\n### Code:\n```\ndef solve(inputString){\n    result2 = {\"stickers\":0, \"total\":inputString[0]}\n\n    if(inputString[1] == \"\") return(result2) \n\n    n1 = inputString[1].split(\",\")\n    n2 = inputString[2].split(\",\")\n\n    sticker_count = n1.pop(0)\n    print(\"\\nSticker count: \", sticker_count)\n\n    last_page  = (n1[-1] + 1).abs() \n    print(\" Last Page: \", last_page)\n\n    print(\"\\nFirst half of 6 pages =\", inputString[1]) \n\n\n    print(\"\\nafter first 6 pages =\", n1) \n\n    print(\"Second half of 6 pages:\", inputString[2])\n    print(\"Third half of 6 pages + last two pages:\", n2)\n\n    last 6", "answer": "B: think"}

{"text": "arlington\n\n#### What is this language?\nJavaScript\n\n#### How do I create a class in JavaScript?\nTo make a new class using your favorite text editor, first create your constructor function. Here's an example using the name `Rectangle`:\n```\n  // create the rectangl constructor function\n  function Rectangle(width, height) {\n    // these are the variables/parameters\n    this.width = width;\n    this.height = height;\n    // this method to compute the area of the rectangle!\n    this.area = function() {\n      return width * height;\n    };\n  }\n\n```\nNow, create an object that contains the object properties that we want to add to our rectangle. Here, we're just using `width` and `height`. For example, if our rectangle is 10 units by 8 units, our object would look like this:\n```\nlet rectangle = new Rectangle(10, 8);\nlet area = rectangle.area(); // 80\n```\n\nSo, to store our rectangle in a variable, we create a new instance of the object using the `new Rectangle()` syntax:\n```\n  // instantiate our rectangle\n  let rectangle = new Rectangle();\n\n```\nNow we can do more advanced things with our rectangle object, like store it in a variable or make it dynamic. We can even check for edge conditions if they exist! But for now, we're just going to initialize some simple data:\n```\n  rectangle.width = width;  // 10 units\n  rectangle.height = height;  // 15 units\n\n```\n\nNotice in the Rectangle() constructor above that we have three different variables: `height`, `width`, and `area`. Now when we call `this.area()` we want it to return (this is all based on math, not magic :)). Therefore, our constructor requires us to pass in two parameters to tell us the width and height. We say it requires this because we need these things in order to compute the area. Now we've set up our object, but how do we get data inside of it?\n\nWe're going to do it using an array of keys.

The reason air is filled with molecules is because air is filled with nitrogen, oxygen, and argon, and many other types of greenhouse gases. These gases, which make up more than 99 percent of the atmosphere, are almost inert to us and the planet they take in and release very little.

In this form, the number is 6134, 3125, and so on.\nWe can easily recognize that even if it is not in the form of 2-2-2. \nThe rule 6-4 is that no matter how we represent numbers, it cannot change no matter what.\nOutput: D\n\nInput: A new password system for a company is being considered which requires users to provide three separate pieces of information  for each login attempt, such as their birth date, employee ID, and a secret phrase, where 10 combinations are possible, and it is desirable for the system to be as secure as possible without users having to write down and memorize multiple passwords!\n\nDesign two algorithms (and pseudocode) for the system.  Your user input should be a string representing each option, in the format of three sets of three comma-separated values,  and the last piece of input should always be the chosen password string.  Your program should accept all possible choices and display which two pieces would be the best to use, in order of preference:\n\nFirst Pass\nA system that requires this many pieces might not be practical or useful, however for the sake of this problem, assume that users can remember these choices.

He has already saved 65 dollars.  His parents will give him $10 extra and have babysit for two hours this saturday.  His neighbor will give him $7 per hour.  How much more will he need to earn to buy the bike?  \n\n1. His parents will give an extra $10, he earned 65 + 10 = $75. \n\n2. He will babysit two hours, he will be paid $7 * (2): = $14. \n\nSo, the total amount he needs to have = his parents' extra amount + his babysitting amount = 10 + 14 = $24. \n\n3. So, the total amount he will need to have = 65 + 24 = $89.00\n\n\n4. so, there would be need to have $89.01 to get the bike and so the answer to the question would be 90 dollars and one cent.\n\nSolution to 3rd question:\nThe given", "answer": "A: disorientation"}

Choices:  a b d e\nOutput: a\n\nInput: What is bigger? 1 or 10000\nOutput: 1000e\n---\n\n### Solution:\n- I used a recursive formula and a case statement. For the first one, I took the variables and separated them by a variable, for example 7 was converted to 7 as well as 'm' and  '' and separated the whole variable into 3 parts. It was then converted to an integer value by adding up all the values of all the variables from the front to the back. This was done for every part of every variable in order to turn an integer value into a number.\n- For the second question, I separated the letters in the variable into individual letters and made a function where each variable was a 1 if it contained a e and a 0 if it didn't. I used a switch statement because there were more then two answers so I put all the answers into one block as a statement. As I counted the answers for \"E\" it also checked for all the other answers, for example if \"a\" was selected the answer would stop. It's important to realize that when you have a case statement, you can't repeat a statement.\n- For the third question, I used a conditional statement where I took the 2 numbers given and checked to see if they were in the same value range or not. I did a similar thing for the 2 answers given for the third question.\n- Finally, for the fourth question, I used a number range check and a recursion to first make it only look at the digit, for example the number was 100, I would then add in 1 and -1 and turn them into -1 to +1 again so that it could look at every one. This part was done twice to check for the different digits.\n- The recursive thing was a bit difficult to explain so I put some info at the bottom after the actual code example.", "answer": "C: big city"}

{"text": "Input: What would you put furniture in? Choices: \nA: apartment B: roof C: room D: floor E: neighbor's apartment\nOutput:\n\n### Solution:\n\n#### Question 1\n\nWe know that input is a list of integers, so let's make a list with each object to see what kind of list it is.\n\nThe list looks like this: ((3, 3, 2, 2)), which looks like it has 4 items. So, it should be a list of tuples.\n\nTuples are lists that have 2 elements. Thus, the tuples should be of length 2.\n\nFrom here, we need to add a method that can subtract an item from a list. So, we define an __i__ method that returns the item (as a tuple) that was at position __i__ in the list in the method.\n\nSo, let's look at how the input list is put together.\n\nIt has 4 items in it, so let's start iterating from 0 to 3:\n\n__i__ is 0. The subtraction method tells us to use __i__. Thus, __i__ is 0 (which is the first item in the list). Next, we see how to use the __getitem__ method, which tells us to take the item at position __i__. This is the first tuple in the original list, which is, in fact, (3, 3). So, we return 3.\n\n__i__ changes to 1. The first number in the tuple is 3, but the second number is always 0. We apply the __i__ 2 more times and thus we have 3, 0, and 0. We know this is the first tuple from the original list. We need to subtract __i__ from this tuple and get the return value. Because __i__ is 2, the tuple is (3, 3), so we return the second number in this tuple... 3.\n\nNow, __i__ is set to 3. The first tuple in the input list is (3, 0, 0). Subtracting 3 from 3 leaves us with 0. We return 0.\n\nNow __i__ is set again to 2. The first tuple", "answer": "C: floor"}

A witch cast a curse on the good-looking brother which made him 7 feet 2 inches tall and hairy everywhere. The other brother cast a spell upon her which shrank her to 1/7th of her normal size.\nThe witch, in an attempt to save face, decided to grant them each a wish. The brothers decided to exchange spells. The curse on the tall brother became so intense that in a few days each of his muscles grew 2 inches long and became coated with hair.

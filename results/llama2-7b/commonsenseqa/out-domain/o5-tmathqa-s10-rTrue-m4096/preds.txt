So far he has amassed??? in assets.<n>Output: 'The goal' is replaced by 'fortune'. So the sentence is 'He has only ever had the fortune to gain riches'. Wealthy means "possessing great wealth or making a great deal of money." Wealth is a great fortune. So we combine the two, and get "He has only ever had a great fortune to gain riches". So if we replace "gain riches" by "wealth" we have "He has only ever great a fortune to gain wealth." But the question asks for the answer to be assets. So we remove "only ever." That means, "He has always had a fortune to gain wealth.<n>So the final answer was wealthy.<n><n>Input: As it was getting dark, he took down a large branch of a tree to stop the thief's progress and as the thief ran by, he dropped the sack of stolen money.

As he took a large branch, he came down to the edge of the forest.<n>D. As it was getting dark the man took a large branch.<n>Output: "He took down the large branch"- a passive voice and "The man came to the edge of bush"- active voice. Also, man is not doing anything in both the sentences, so man can only follow the last one which is a "was getting dark".<n>So the final answer, He took down the large brad just as he came to edge of bush.<n><n>Input: He took down the large tree, and as he came to the bush edge he dropped the stolen sack of money.

Aircraft carrier is a type of water vehicle used by the US Navy for taking off and landing aircrafts. The launching platform also serves to launch large ships into the water. Explanation: The correct answer should be "F". Aircraft carrier (often referred to as "CV", for "aircraft carrier") is a type of warship that serves as a "floating airbase" for aircraft operations. They are equipped with a full-length flight deck and hangar for fixed-wing aircraft (although if they are equipped with helicopters, some smaller ships might be classed as aircraft carriers).Aircraft carriers are generally used as part of aircraft carrier battle groups. The term "heavy aircraft carrier" is used to describe the US Nautilus-class which are the largest aircraft carriers ever built and were designed exclusively for use as attack aircraft carriers. Their displacements were more than 50% larger than Essex-class aircraft carriers.<n><n>Input: An object has 4 times the mass of a golf ball. What is the ratio of its weight to a golf ball's weight?

We can divide 8 into 80 and it will leave a remainder of 32. Therefore, 8 is not divisible by 5. This can be true for other set of numbers. Example: 9. We can divide 46 into 9, and it will leave a remain of 1. Therefore, 46 is divisible by 9. The same technique can be applied to other sets of numbers. The first number is 8. The second number is 2.8. The first digit is 8 and the second digit is 8. Therefore, 48 is also not divided by 5. This concept of digit can be applied to other numbers also. The first digit is one, the second digit is 2 and the third digit is 8. Then, 28 is divisible by 5 because the last digit is 8. 48 is not because the first digit is 8. The largest number is 48. But, if we break 48 into its components, they are 4 and 8. This can't be divides into 5 because there is the digit 0. Let us consider the lowest amount of 5 which is 1. We can not break it because there is a value for 5 in 4 is 4 so that we can not break the number. When we break any large number into its components the total of these number should be 5 or less than the value of 1. Example: The first digit is 2. The second digit is 2. Then, the answer is 20. The answer fits. The first

The function value of a function at x c exists and is a real number. The function value of a real function at an imaginary number can be any complex number. The function value at x c does not exist. All of the above are true of the function value. None of the above statements are true of the function<n>Output: All of the above are TRUE.<n>So the final answer for d, is TRUE.<n><n>Important Notes :<n><n>1. Explanation : "In any real functions, the function value is the "y" in the real life formula y = x * y, where x is real. For any rea l number, this will be a single point and then the "y" in this formula will have a single value and is known as the function value of the function at the real number x for which we want to calculate the function value ( a real number x, for which we want the function value ). for this y = f(x) where x is a number and ( x ) refers to the value at which we want the function at that particular number or point."<n><n>This is why the question is set in such a way that we are given choices like "remember" and then we are asked to choose which is correct one from them and not like "if it is illegal to remember then it is not". So it is clear that the answer to this is "remember" but if I have any other choice like "help" or anything else the answer would be none of these. And that is why it is necessary to consider and provide choices like this in such question.<n><n>2. Explanation : The "none of these" choice is chosen in the question, when this kind of doubt arises. This might seem like an outrageous choice which does not fit anywhere, but in maths this is the best kind of choice and the most accurate one. In this case the choice is "None of These" and hence the answer should be "True".<n>

Select one word that does not belong with each group of words in the following text. 2. The three-step trick to getting a perfect score on this GRE question!<n><n>Explanation: The phrase that describes a feeling of extreme fear is “petronela”. It does not belong with the words “elegiaco” and “agudo”. This is a good example of a type of trap that is found on a GRE sentence equivalence question. Be careful to look at the entire sentence before choosing which word is incorrect.<n><n>Answer: Select one word that does does not belong with eachgroup of words in the followingtext. The three-step tricketo getting aperfect score on this GREQuestion!<n><n>Answer : Petronela <n><n>Step 1: Petronela is not the most accurate translation of the Spanish word “petronela”, which is used to describe a “dramatic” or “melodramatic” feeling of love or fear. The most direct translation would be “petrified”. So, although it is grammatically correct to insert the word “petronela” in this sentence, it doesn’t quite suit the context.<n><n>Step 2: However, because the author of the sentence is looking for a “petronela”-like word or phrase, it’s possible that you could get away with answering “elegiac” instead. Although the author does not clearly state it, it is possible that they are referring to a feeling of extreme fear. In this context, it is possible that a “petronela-like” feeling can be described as “agudo” (sharp) or “aguda” (sharp). Since there is no clearly correct answer, it is best to select one of the choices that most closely matches the word or phrase described, rather than choosing the one that best suits the context.<n><n>Input: The car's speed is faster than the truck and the bus.

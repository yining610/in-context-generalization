{"idx": 717, "text": "\"D\"\n\n### Instruction:Answer the multiple choice question using a short text answer.\n\nThe city\u2019s Department of Transit has decided to add more trains for the busy morning rush hour. To accomplish this, they decided to add six more cars to each of their ten trains.  Each train has ten carriages; four of which are reserved for people with wheelchairs, and the other six are for normal passengers.  They must also buy six more train carriages.  The cost for a train carriage is $140 and because they are buying six more, they each will cost $840, giving a total cost of $5440.  In total, they will pay $6414 to bring on more cars.  The Department of Transit would like to avoid paying this extra $6414 if possible.  They figured out that if each car on one train had an empty car in front or behind it, then there would be space for an extra person without using an additional carriage.  This would reduce the amount that the department would pay, but how much?\n### Your answer:\n### The answer is option number: A.\n### The solution\nThe cost of adding six additional cars is $6414.  However, if the six cars are added together in one long queue, then there are places for another 56 to stand and get on or off.

When it runs it should be pretty fast. But if it's not fast enough we are more worried about the algorithm than how fast things run.\n2. Make sure you test on Python 3\n3. You should be able to submit it as you are, as its open and people will be interested in what you have done. Keep your code on a platform you are familiar with so you don't struggle.\n4. Write a one line summary describing your code.\n5. If something fails, check it against similar open problems.\n6. Make your code efficient, it will save you a lot of time.\n7. Use a range() function for easier programming instead of hardcoding\n8. You can use comments such as #Import and #Code to help you and others in following your code.\n9. Use clean indentation and avoid excessive white spaces. If your problem has many conditions, use If, Else If and Else instead of else statements.\n10. To pass the problem you don't need to use any third-party modules, but if you do you need to explain your code as well as your choice of the modules you used. The more you can use Python, the faster your program will run.\n11. Make it as Pythonic as possible with the way you write functions.\n1", "answer": "A: candy store"}

There are no options that answer the question.\n#3. The first three equations are easy to solve, but the fourth one should include the addition of all the different time traves and the final time should be divided by the number of cattle moved. The last equation needs to be reworded in a way that it tells the students to take into account the driving time, not multiply the driving time by the number of cattle move. \n#4. To get the number of days, we need to multiply the number of days by 14. To get the final answer, we need to multiply by $50. The total amount they paid is $1100.\n#5. First we need to multiply the original number of cattle by the ratio because we do not want to include the factor of $50.0.\n#6. We use the total number of children (180) to figure out the amount of money to divide between the boys $5000.0 + $2900.0. Using the ratio again we need to multiply it with the amount of money we have divided. The remaining balance is $60 for a total of $5666.0.\n#7. To get the answer 39 in the answer book, it is multiplied by itself to have to two sets of carrots, half of the first and one-quarter of the second to come to an average of 78. Then multiply by two.\n#8. There are no options for the question. The answer is 23 people.\n#9. We subtract the amount the original price to the discount we give to equal the new price. The $500 is multiplied by the %10 for taxes to figure out how much we will take from the $480\n#10. First group includes 12, because 4 is 1", "answer": "C: pay bills"}

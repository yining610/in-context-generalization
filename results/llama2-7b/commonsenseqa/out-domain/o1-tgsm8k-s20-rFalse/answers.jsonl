We do not want to use recursion for two reasons. The first reason is performance. Recursion is really bad in performance. And the second reason is that this is an assignment that is actually pretty simple even if it is a little time consuming at first to make. You start by iterating over the input binary tree. If this is an input with one node, then you should output 0. However if this is an input binary tree with no nodes, it should still output 0. Now comes to the fun part! You should find out a list of nodes and then print them out. The easiest way to find the path is by iterating over each node and finding out its children, and then, for each child, its children, etc. We will find out how we perform recursive searches using two nested loops. For each iteration, we start by iterating over all the nodes, and then we will iterate over each one of its children to find out if it is a leaf on our input tree. This is done by using a function to check if there is a node which is not a leaf. If the nodes is a leaf, then we have our answer. If not, then we call the function within each of its children.\n\n### Instructios:\nWrite a program to find the path from root to terminal nodes in a binary tree in the shortast time possible, and display the output.\nInput: 4\nOutput(s): 1\nInput: 4 6 5 1\nOutput(s):\n\n### Instucutions:\nWrite a recursive program that determines the minimum path length to", "answer": "D: ground"}

Here, 'index_of_list' is a temporary variable that needs to be updated to store the index of the first number found to be equal to 'expected_value'.\n\n\n```python\n        def two_sum_iter(sorted_list, index_of_list, expected_number):\n\t\t\tif index_of_list > len(sorted_list)-1:\n\t\t\t\tindex_of_list = -1\n\t\t\telse:\n\t\t\t  for i in range(index_of_list+1,len(sorted_list)):\n\t\t\t\t\tif sorted_list[i] == expected_number:\n\t\t\t           index_of_list = i\n\t\t\t```\n\n- **Step 3** : If the expected_value is found in `index_of_list`, then return `index_of_array - 1`\n\nIf a list is passed as the argument it will print the indices of the value in the list\n- **Step4** : Modify the function to take an argument which is NOT the 0\n\n```python\nif index_of_array == 0:\n    return None\n```\n\n\n```python \n\ndef two_sum_iter_2(sorted", "answer": "C: aircraft carrier"}

The first time is when he is looking for it and he gets lost it the large building. The 2nd time is when he finds the right room and he is finally happy or satisfied after a hard or hard time which \"hard' is an antonym for \"easy\" so we see that \"towards happy/satisfied\" was the answer to the question.", "answer": "A: school"}

{"text": "A\n\n### Solution:\n\n1. In order to calculate the sum or difference of two numbers in a list, use the + or - operator. You can create a new list using the list comprehension and concat. The append makes the element the same as a new list. \n```python\n>>> mylist = [2,8,100,25]\n>>> [x + y for x, y in zip(mylist, mylist[1:])]\n[2, 8, 100, 25]\n```\n\n2. You can use the % operator to divide a number by an integer in a list, for example, `[2,3,4] % 2`. The % operator is the modulo operator and the % 2 is equivalent to the remainder of the division with two. For example: 4 % 2 is 0, 44 % 2 is -2, and 66 % 2 is 2.\n\n3. The len(x) function provides the length of the iterable x and the len(y) is equivalent to the len(x-y).\n\n    ```python\n    >>> l4 = [4]\n    >>> len(l4)\n    1\n    >>> len(x)\n    ```\n    > This is how the remainder operation works: if it is 0, it equals the size of the divisor minus the size of the size of the divisors minus the size of the list. That is, the rest of the numbers minus zero. \n    > > [3] % 2 - (2) - (0) = (0)\n\n4. To determine if a number is divisible by 3, use:\n\n    ```python[x] % 3 == 0```\n\n5. To determine if a list is empty:\n\n    ```[len(x)] == 0```", "answer": "A: sum"}

A is 1, B is 2, C is 3, and D is 4.\n\n2. Tapanga has 66, so 66 mod 4 = 3, since modulus is the remainder after division.\n\n3. Tapanga also has 8 more candy than Corey. So 66 + 8 = 74 mod 4 = 1.\n\n4. Tapanga also divided by B. So 74 mod 2 = 2. \n\n5. Add Tapanga's candies from step 3 and 4: 74 = 2 + (2 + 3) mod 4 = 2\n\nTapanga has 2 candies.\n\n#### Problem 2\n\nThe logic: \n\n1. The number was input as 12.\n2. Then a choice was selected and subtracted from the original number until it was either 0, less than 0, or the same as 25.\n\n3. 12 - 25 = - 13\n4. 12 - (-13) = 27\n5. 27 + 3 = 30\n6. 30 - 25 = 5, so the final answer is 5.", "answer": "D: getting tired"}

Since we are told that 3 of only 5 are right handed we need to assume that being right handed is 60% so we can say that 40% of the people are left handed.\n\n\nSince we were told that there is only one boy we can assume that we have a 66% chance that the boy is right handed or 33% that the boy is left handed.\n\nSo we need to multiply all of the probabilities together to form the probability that the boy is in the room.\n`[1/2][1/4][0.66][1/2]`\n\n$$P(boy) = 0.3333...$$\n\nThis means that we have a 33% chance that the boy will be selected.\n\nIt was a \"Countryside\"\n\nThere are 3 girls in the room and 69 people.\n\nFirst of all, we need to eliminate girls that don't meet the criteria of right handedness.\n\nThis can be done by using the binomial distribution.\n$$N = 68$$\nWe know that 3 of the persons are girls and 3 are boys so\n$$k=1$$\nTherefore\n$$\\displaystyle P=\\binom{n}{m}p^m(1-p)^{67-m}\\space\\space\\space", "answer": "B: anthology"}

The input is two arrays and the function checks if the length of the array on the left is greater than the length of the array to the right. Return true if the length of the left array is greater than the right array and false otherwise.\n\n### Instructions:The below script has errors and/or warnings. Explain the error(s)and how to fix them.\n\n#### Problems #####\n1. No line return after return statement.\n\n2. The function `isMore` doesn't compare length of two arrays, its only compare left array with the first element of the right array.\n\n3. The variable hasMore is the name of the `if` statement, we can use just `if` or `if (hasMore)`.\n\n4. When declaring function `isMore`, we have `isMore(arr1, arr2)` we dont need to declare `var` when its function, we can do `var isMore = (arr1) > arr2`.\n\n5. In `isMore` function instead of  `hasMore === true` we should write `hasMore > 0`.\n6. For example in function `isMore`, `else if` can only be used if the condition is met within `arr1` only, we can then do `if` within `else if` to achieve the behaviour.\n\t\n7. Function `arrayHelper` only compare first element, we need to also write the following statement for other elements in left array and right array to achieve the desired behaviour. `else if(arrayHelper(left, r.shift()) === left.length)`\n\n8. When adding element to the array, instead of `left.push`, we can use `arr.push` or `left.add` or `arr.push(e)`.\n\n9. Its better not to use short hand notation for variable `return` instead use `return variableName`.\n\n10. In `arrayHelper` instead of `if(v)` we can use `if(v < 0)`.\n\n### Your Solution #####\n```javascript\n```\n\n### Instructon:Write a function called `hasMore` that takes two parameters, the `length` of the array and the array.

You may use my code or any other resource for help. This challenge will have two parts. To demonstrate you mastery, you will need to provide three separate solutions. The first solution will be the solution you came up with using the method I taught you. Solution 2 will be a solution you came up with after you reviewed the course material and solved the coding challenge questions in your book. Solution 3 will be a solution you found from a website that is not a repository of other people's code or solutions to this challenge. Use these solutions to show three different ways of solving the coding challenge. I will use blackboard to track how many students submit their code. I will check Blackboard a few times each week. I will be looking for multiple submissions of the coding challenge so I can see that you have tried more than one solution. Make sure that you save your code after it does not display on Blackboard. The file name must contain your full name. You will also be required to post the link to the code you used on Blackboard at least 12 hours before the due date and time.\n  \n### Code: \n \n```\n     \n// This file is part of the \"C++\" chapter of the \"CppCon\" book.\n// It has been released under the CC_BY-SA license and is available at\n// \"https://github.com/FabioAK/CppCon-3e\"\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\nusing namespace std;\n \n\n\nint main()\n{\n\tint candies;\n\t\n\t \n\tcin >> candies;\n\tint candyTotal = ceil ( candies / 2.0 );\n\tint corey = candies - candyTotal;\n\t \n\t\tcout << corey;\n\t \n\n\treturn 0;\n}\n \n\n```", "answer": "E: urinate"}

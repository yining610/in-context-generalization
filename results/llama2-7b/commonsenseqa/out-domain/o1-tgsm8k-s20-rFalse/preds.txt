Why has Dijkstra taken so long to figure out that the answer to the first question is 29?<n><n>He needs to know that 29 more is 45, and then from there work backwards.<n><n>#### 3. What’s the purpose of the third question and what is the best explanation for why the answer is Nine?<n><n>The purpose is to provide another example to show that you’re not guessing and that you’re trying to think logically and use what’s given to you in the question. The best explanation: Use the question to determine what each book is, and then multiply 2 and 1 and substract that from 10 to get nine.<n><n>#### 4. What would you have to think about to get the answer to the fourth question?<n><n>That the question is asking for an average, and to think about how many days would the person be eating soup in a year. 10 x 365 = 3,650, so the answer would be B.<n><n>#### 5. Which of the five questions does Dijkstra do the worst?<n><n>The first question. He did not take a logical approach, and just tried to guess an answer, which in this case led to him being wrong. However, at least he recognized that he thought it was 39 and then used reasoning to arrive to 29 (which is pretty awesome). The method he used to arrive at 29 was the right step 1 in my problem solving process.<n><n>#### 6. If he spent 20 minutes on each problem, how many more times did he spend guessing at the correct answer than he did using logic?<n><n>4.75

The first line of code is the input<n>  2. The second line of code is part of the if condition<n>      3. 'a=56-7' means 56 subtract 8 equals to how much Corey has<n>  4. And if the answer is not negative print  the answer then stop and quit   <n>  5. So what I did was first i separated the line, then I had to put it into an if and if the condition was negative I would add 1  and keep multiplying <n>    until the answer get's to a negative then stop which means Tapanga has less candys than Corey but the answer should still be the same.<n>  6.

It would have made sense if the question specified that the brothers were twins, but this isnt the case. There are 3 possibilities as stated. <n><n>In question four, we do not know if Corey and Tapanga have the same number of candies, if one has more candies than the other, or if there is 54 candies in total. <n>

We do not want to use recursion for two reasons. The first reason is performance. Recursion is really bad in performance. And the second reason is that this is an assignment that is actually pretty simple even if it is a little time consuming at first to make. You start by iterating over the input binary tree. If this is an input with one node, then you should output 0. However if this is an input binary tree with no nodes, it should still output 0. Now comes to the fun part! You should find out a list of nodes and then print them out. The easiest way to find the path is by iterating over each node and finding out its children, and then, for each child, its children, etc. We will find out how we perform recursive searches using two nested loops. For each iteration, we start by iterating over all the nodes, and then we will iterate over each one of its children to find out if it is a leaf on our input tree. This is done by using a function to check if there is a node which is not a leaf. If the nodes is a leaf, then we have our answer. If not, then we call the function within each of its children.<n><n>### Instructios:<n>Write a program to find the path from root to terminal nodes in a binary tree in the shortast time possible, and display the output.<n>Input: 4<n>Output(s): 1<n>Input: 4 6 5 1<n>Output(s):<n><n>### Instucutions:<n>Write a recursive program that determines the minimum path length to

Choices:  A: school B: office building C: house D: hotel E: centre<n>Output:		 School<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>The method of 2 ways we solve this. If there are 66 candies combined and Corey only has 29 how many candies does Tanga have. Therefore, she has 37 candies. If there are 37 candies and she has 8 more then she would have the rest of the candies.<n>Also, if we were to look at how many times the word "towards" occurs when Corey looks for the room, it will be twice or 2 times. The first time is when he is looking for it and he gets lost it the large building. The 2nd time is when he finds the right room and he is finally happy or satisfied after a hard or hard time which "hard' is an antonym for "easy" so we see that "towards happy/satisfied" was the answer to the question. <n>

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Output: 29<n><n>Input:What will all the differences equal? Choices:  A: sum B: likeness C: alike D: sameness E: similarity<n>Output:		A<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>1. In order to calculate the sum or difference of two numbers in a list, use the + or - operator. You can create a new list using the list comprehension and concat. The append makes the element the same as a new list. <n>```python<n>>>> mylist = [2,8,100,25]<n>>>> [x + y for x, y in zip(mylist, mylist[1:])]<n>[2, 8, 100, 25]<n>```<n><n>2. You can use the % operator to divide a number by an integer in a list, for example, `[2,3,4] % 2`. The % operator is the modulo operator and the % 2 is equivalent to the remainder of the division with two. For example: 4 % 2 is 0, 44 % 2 is -2, and 66 % 2 is 2.<n><n>3. The len(x) function provides the length of the iterable x and the len(y) is equivalent to the len(x-y).<n><n>    ```python<n>    >>> l4 = [4]<n>    >>> len(l4)<n>    1<n>    >>> len(x)<n>    ```<n>    > This is how the remainder operation works: if it is 0, it equals the size of the divisor minus the size of the size of the divisors minus the size of the list. That is, the rest of the numbers minus zero. <n>    > > [3] % 2 - (2) - (0) = (0)<n><n>4. To determine if a number is divisible by 3, use:<n><n>    ```python[x] % 3 == 0```<n><n>5. To determine if a list is empty:<n><n>    ```[len(x)] == 0```<n>

A is 1, B is 2, C is 3, and D is 4.<n><n>2. Tapanga has 66, so 66 mod 4 = 3, since modulus is the remainder after division.<n><n>3. Tapanga also has 8 more candy than Corey. So 66 + 8 = 74 mod 4 = 1.<n><n>4. Tapanga also divided by B. So 74 mod 2 = 2. <n><n>5. Add Tapanga's candies from step 3 and 4: 74 = 2 + (2 + 3) mod 4 = 2<n><n>Tapanga has 2 candies.<n><n>#### Problem 2<n><n>The logic: <n><n>1. The number was input as 12.<n>2. Then a choice was selected and subtracted from the original number until it was either 0, less than 0, or the same as 25.<n><n>3. 12 - 25 = - 13<n>4. 12 - (-13) = 27<n>5. 27 + 3 = 30<n>6. 30 - 25 = 5, so the final answer is 5.<n><n><n><n>

The words to check must obey these requirements: * The words must be all lowercase letters. * There are no hyphen or apostrophe marks in the words. * The first number mark must be followed by a space character (no other characters can be located next to the number). * This is not a sentence, but rather a sentence fragment. * The number of digits after the first number marks is unrestricted (e.g. all one digit, one or more two digit numbers, and/or one or more three digit numbers). * Each number mark is the same (same digit) number, not different numbers. The word that this program is trying to identify is the first number mark immediately followed by space character. If an identified word is part of another word, the preceding number mark will NOT be replaced with a space character. Write code that reads a file containing words of the above requirements and displays the following statistics:<n><n>1. The total number of found punctuation words and a separate total number of each type of punctuation word found (that is, exclamation point, question mark, comma, colon, semicolon, period, quotation mark start and end) that was used at least once.<n><n>2. The total number of words found without the punctuation word.<n><n>3. The punctuation word that was the most frequent, as well as any additional information about that word. For example, “The word most likely to be a question mark is ‘who’.”<n><n>4. Which punctuation word was seen the most frequently or with which word. For example, if the most frequently occurring word was after the punctuation word, “We were having a bite to eat”; then, your answer could be:<n>*The word most often after a comma is ‘ate’.<n><n>Instructors will provide their own testing data.

The input is two arrays and the function checks if the length of the array on the left is greater than the length of the array to the right. Return true if the length of the left array is greater than the right array and false otherwise.<n><n>### Instructions:The below script has errors and/or warnings. Explain the error(s)and how to fix them.<n><n>#### Problems #####<n>1. No line return after return statement.<n><n>2. The function `isMore` doesn't compare length of two arrays, its only compare left array with the first element of the right array.<n><n>3. The variable hasMore is the name of the `if` statement, we can use just `if` or `if (hasMore)`.<n><n>4. When declaring function `isMore`, we have `isMore(arr1, arr2)` we dont need to declare `var` when its function, we can do `var isMore = (arr1) > arr2`.<n><n>5. In `isMore` function instead of  `hasMore === true` we should write `hasMore > 0`.<n>6. For example in function `isMore`, `else if` can only be used if the condition is met within `arr1` only, we can then do `if` within `else if` to achieve the behaviour.<n>	<n>7. Function `arrayHelper` only compare first element, we need to also write the following statement for other elements in left array and right array to achieve the desired behaviour. `else if(arrayHelper(left, r.shift()) === left.length)`<n><n>8. When adding element to the array, instead of `left.push`, we can use `arr.push` or `left.add` or `arr.push(e)`.<n><n>9. Its better not to use short hand notation for variable `return` instead use `return variableName`.<n><n>10. In `arrayHelper` instead of `if(v)` we can use `if(v < 0)`.<n><n>### Your Solution #####<n>```javascript<n>```<n><n>### Instructon:Write a function called `hasMore` that takes two parameters, the `length` of the array and the array. The function should

This assignment is a coding challenge, meaning that I will not hand in code that solves the problem for you. You may use my code or any other resource for help. This challenge will have two parts. To demonstrate you mastery, you will need to provide three separate solutions. The first solution will be the solution you came up with using the method I taught you. Solution 2 will be a solution you came up with after you reviewed the course material and solved the coding challenge questions in your book. Solution 3 will be a solution you found from a website that is not a repository of other people's code or solutions to this challenge. Use these solutions to show three different ways of solving the coding challenge. I will use blackboard to track how many students submit their code. I will check Blackboard a few times each week. I will be looking for multiple submissions of the coding challenge so I can see that you have tried more than one solution. Make sure that you save your code after it does not display on Blackboard. The file name must contain your full name. You will also be required to post the link to the code you used on Blackboard at least 12 hours before the due date and time.<n>  <n>### Code: <n> <n>```<n>     <n>// This file is part of the "C++" chapter of the "CppCon" book.<n>// It has been released under the CC_BY-SA license and is available at<n>// "https://github.com/FabioAK/CppCon-3e"<n>#include <iostream><n>#include <string><n>using namespace std;<n> <n><n><n>int main()<n>{<n>	int candies;<n>	<n>	 <n>	cin >> candies;<n>	int candyTotal = ceil ( candies / 2.0 );<n>	int corey = candies - candyTotal;<n>	 <n>		cout << corey;<n>	 <n><n>	return 0;<n>}<n> <n><n>```<n><n><n><n><n>

Since 3 times a week multiplied by 3 hours of lifting and another 1/3 of time of warm up and cardio make a total of 9 hours in a week.  9 hours x 50% = 4.5.

How did slavery become a way of life in the Southern United States?\n\nMany factors contributed to the institution of slavery in American society. The main ones were the following:\n\n- The need for labor\n\n- The economic climate of the time\n\n- The religious beliefs of those involved\n\n- The inability to change course\n\nSlavery was common throughout the world and most of the New World. Most of the Northern States in the United States practiced slavery.  However, those states and areas that didn\u2019t include most of the South.\n\nFor the original 13 colonies, slavery was allowed (along with its own set of laws) in only nine. The first slavery laws, the Negro Act of 1662, allowed slaves to be sent to other American colonies against their will and without their consent. This policy was to get more slaves for the American South. This law only lasted 10 years.\n\nThe South began to grow substantial crops, such as rice and tobacco, during the 1600s. The American colonies were built under British imperial rule. The British had their own slaves and sent them to the United States during the slave trade.\n\nAt the same time, the American economy was growing because of the Industrial Revolution. To get that economy started required large amounts of cheap labor. The Southern plantation owners began to import slaves from West Africa to work.\n\nSlaves on a plantation became slaves for other reasons than the ability to work hard. They were often kidnapped in West Africa or other parts of the world. Some were indentured servants, which means they agreed to work in exchange for freedom. Even in the 19th and 20th centuries slaves were sold to pay off gambling and drunken debts by their owners.\n\nThe United State\u2019s slave trade took place from 1619 to 1807, but it was abolished in 1863. Slaves in the South who could not or did not want to flee to the North often were held in forced labor camps. They were allowed to", "answer": "E: plantation"}

What's the difference between 30% off and 40% off anyways? 30% off is 70% of the original cost so subtracting that from your original cost gets you a 40% discount off of the original item.

{"idx": 409, "text": "A\n\n- **Instructions**:Enter your answer as a number, not a word. Do not include units. For example, if the answer is 1 meter, just type 1. (Do not type 1 meters.)The unit of the measurement (if it is non-zero) must appear at the end of your answer. You may enter the measurement unit in either imperial or metric units. Examples include m^2 (for 1 square meter), km (for 1 kilometer), cm (for 2 centimeters), oz (for 1 ounce), lb (for 1 pound), yd (for 1 yard), ft (for 1 foot). Your answer must be in the correct type of units for that unit. Note that you should include units only if the answer is not trivially zero: 1 cm is not substantially smaller than 1 m, and if your answer is 3 m then don't type \"m2\" (you know \"m\" comes after the 3, and if the answer is 0.37 in then don't type in \"+/-7 decimal places\"). If your answer is zero (e.g., 0 m), then do not include any units. Do not simply add the letters \"g\" and \"cm3\" to the end of your answer and call it a unit. Instead, just type the word \"g\". Do not type a mixture of letters and numbers: for example, do not type \"g32cm\". Do not spell out words like \"feet\" or \"pounds\". You may enter mixed units. In such case, you should enter a space after the last numerical term (exactly as you see on the quiz). (For example, if your answer is 1/2 km, then type 1/ 2 km.)For example, you may enter 12 ft 10.355 in (to express 5 feet 10 9/16 inches)As a special case, if you enter an answer of \"-3x^2+4x+y\", then you should do not include any space. Also, if you enter multiple lines of input then you must include a newline character at the end. (That means pressing [Enter] on your keyboard.)For example, if you entered \"-3x^2\\n4x\\n+y\", that would be valid input.", "answer": "A: blisters"}

{"idx": 425, "text": "E\n\n### Solution:The idea is to work out the number of hours they are working during each set time, and then use that information to solve the question.  It is similar to this question, but the time in those ones is not given as a constant, so it is harder to figure out\n\n### Solution for part a:\n\nLet p be the value of nuts and d be the value of dried fruits.  So 4*12*0.5 = p * 4*8 = $30.\n\nso we do $30 * 3 = $90\n\n### Solution fo part b:\n\nThey are working for 4 hours and have 6 extra people that work 2 hours at a time.  So the total number of hours they are going to work is 4 + 12 = 16.\n\n4*16 + 6*2 = 64\n\nBecause they are paying at the same rate, 200 divided by 14 gives 14.28, whereas before it was 12.5, so the new total cost is $480.\n\n### Solution For part c\n\nThe answer is 160 because (2*25 + 3*35) * 3 = 300.  The part that has 245 + 300 is the 2 * 25 days (because he drinks 4 each of the two drinks) and the 3 * 30 for the 3 added people.  So that means it is 300.\n\n## Solution for part d\n\nEach carton has an area of 4*4*5 = 200 square inches.  So a carton has 200 square in.  So we can calculate the number of cartons per box and then multiply it by 200.  16 cartons fit in a box and the box is 200 square, so the total cartons is (square of 16-square of 13) / (square of 20-square of 16) = 3*3 = 9.

However, as time goes by, with more and more pressure from the public, Queen Elizabeth decided it's time to relieve some of the pressure by allowing royalty to pay for goods and services. She decided to tax royalty on goods as well, in order to better regulate royal expenditure. The tax is set at 20% of the price of an item. In order to avoid the tax, royalty and citizens decide to sell an item at the price of x minus the tax, the same way normal people do. This time however, because some royalty are not sure if they would pay the tax or not, they are holding off on buying any items until they decide on what to do. This, in turn, led to a 50% drop in the price of items. The king has been receiving many messages regarding this, thus he issued an order that as of next month, a set item will be purchased with the intention of taxing it. To make things easier for the royal buyer, the king has decided that they will buy an item worth \u00a310,000. However, the tax was also implemented to avoid abuse. The royal will be taxed the amount of the item. All this has led to a lot of confusion among royalty concerning buying items. In this case, in order to avoid taxes, you and your fellow member of royalty have decided to buy things in different stores, so that it'll be hard to keep track of your spending. Therefore, a Royal Buyer has to visit six different stores and buy an item worth \u00a3850.  Every shop charges a slightly different tax rate (see the table below).  Given the amount of your monthly salary, how much tax will you have to pay this month?\"\nOutput: 27\n\nInput: A 9 year old boy is riding his bicycle on the street.

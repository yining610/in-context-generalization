They found a number of artifacts. They are in the process of cataloging their finds. The archaeologists record each artifact in a two part number. The lower part of the two part number represents the item's rank. The rankings start with the artifact found at the highest point on the site and continue consecutively from that point to the point where the artifact was found. The ranks are not associated with the artifacts. For example, it is possible that artifacts 35 and 37 have the same rank. The upper part of the number is the artifact's identifier. The identifiers, beginning with 1, are created so that any combination of artifact identifiers uniquely identifies one artifact. For example, if each artifact had a 2 in its upper part, 1, 2, 3,... would represent all of the items in consecutive order. There was a fire in the museum and part of the catalog.

The total number of points from the first 9 rouds is 287*9=2583 points so we need to subtract 2583 points to get (2583- the league record in points/round)+ 2583 = 48, that is the minimum average they will need for bowling in the final round to be equivalent to the league record.

In this problem, you are asked to build a rectangular pool with a base of 42 meters and a height of 3.6 meters. You are also asked to find the work.<n>We begin by representing the problem using an equation. We begin with the formula for finding the area of an equation, a = Length x Width. For our problem it will be 42 x 3.6 = 156.04 square meters. We can then add the height to the formula to receive area 42 x 15.604 = 635.44 square meters.<n>Because we already solved for the area, we know we now have a rectangle of dimension

Unfortunately, the island is so old and it needs some reparation. Jack's flashlight is getting fucked up and it is running out of battery. The reparation of the island is so expensive that nobody is able to buy the new batteries. But on the other side of the island, they use the electricity of an old oil factory instead of batteries. There is also a river near the island. Luckily, it is really peaceful on the other side and it doesn't have any current. Everyone will come to the island at 14:00 with boats and they will see the river as a big lake. Every boat will stay on the edge of the river and will wait for the other boats. As they will see that they all are waiting for the others, they will leave the boats and will try to find ways to the beach themselves. The river will be really peaceful because of no current and it won't be so hard to swim to the beach. The first boat that is left waiting for the others will leave at 16:00. One of the people on the boats is so nice who gives jack some information about the island. Jack has to make some decisions and has to avoid some difficulties.<n>Output: Jack must use his flashlight

Choices:  A: eternal B: religious C: unpredictable D: holy E: monastic<n>Output:		eternal<n><n>Input: In an old manor mansion, there is a very large room at one end of a foyer. From that very large room, there are two doors and a very large window to the right, and then there are two other large doors to the left. There are 15 small rooms of the mansion which you can go through. You can choose to go to any of these 25 rooms, except the small rooms in between the doors of the big room, and the small room at the end of the foyer. You can also choose not to go through any door at all. You can only walk through one doorway at a time, and then you have no choice until you have returned to the big room.  In each room, your choices will be represented by a letter, and on each doorway, there will be a different letter. When you enter a room, the letter that represents the entrance is removed. The idea is that by the end of the day, you have managed to get out of all these rooms except one.  However, there is a catch: if you go through the doorway that represents the letter you use, you will magically time-travel to a moment about to happen in the future, wherein, you will see how the day has been happening. But in the end, you will return back to the place you are, right now. For example, if in the past, the future is, and the letter "A" is used, you will see the doors change when you come out. So if the "A" represents a door, that door will be an empty space and no doorway there. As a warning to you, there is some danger involved in this, when we take a moment to explain. When you enter a building, when you enter a room, when you enter a doorway to another room that has the same letter as you will use, you will see what happens in the future. It is possible to die in these events. If you do die, you immediately go back to the moment where you entered the building, room, or doorway that you were just in. You have no choice but to live your life over and over as many times as necessary until you make it out of the maze.  You also see future events. You only see future events if you were to go through that doorway in the maze, and it is not always the case that you could possibly die

Counting Sort (Divide and Conquer)<n>### Instruction:This question asks to use Divide and Conquer to solve.<n><n>[input image](images/input.jpg)<n><n>### Description<n><n>The counting sort algorithm sorts a collection of integers based on their frequencies. For a collection of integers (m), the element with the highest frequency is first sorted into its own bucket, which has buckets for each unique value that could be found in our collection of m integers (we have m-1 buckets). After the element is stored into its own bucket, we move onto sorting all other elements of the collection that are less frequent. Each element is first divided equally into two buckets. The bucket with the larger amount is removed, and the amount of elements in the bucket with the lesser amount is incremented by that amount. When we reach the point in which no bucket has any elements in it, we have successfully completed the sort; this solution works in both asc

The following is a code-switching question involving the use of "to" (don't forget to add other rules for this type of questions).<n><n>Code:   In 1982, a group of Japanese researchers observed a large number of penguins in the Antarctic. But they noticed that some of the penguins could swim farther than others. After a three-year investigation they identified some peculiar birds that they thought were capable of crossing from one side of the island to the other. The researchers put out some fish that the birds wanted to eat, and they also put out some large rocks. Which words did the penguins use most often with the rocks to express the distances they swam:   - many kilometers and many miles?  - several kilometers and several miles?    - a long way and a great distance?    <n>Input: They should look at a map and then answer.  <n><n>Tips: Answer is the first one.<n><n>1. They should look at a simple map.<n><n>-  ( )<n><n>2. The island is a small one and the penguins are not on a regular route to swim to the mainland every day. They can swim to the other side of the island only a few times a week in a good weather. So they didn't swim very often and the words they used in their conversations with this rocks were usually words of length, not words of distance. So the distances they swam couldn't be expressed in miles or kilometers.<n><n>- <n>3.  To cross from one side of the Antarctic island to the other, some penguins swim for 500 meters and some swim for 1500 meters.<n><n>-  But 1000 meters and 1500 miles are not equivalent in meaning in the penguin's minds.<n><n>-  These penguins live in Antarctica. There are no regular routes from one side of the ocean to the other. These penguins can swim to the main continent only a few times a year in good weather. So the distances or length of swims they had to do would have seemed very long.<n><n>-  For these penguins, 400 and 800 kilometers are not equivalent.<n><n>4. So the

She uses 3 large stickers each on the front page of their journals and 7 stickers per page to 6 other pages. How many stickers remain?  <n>- I first looked at the number of how many sticker pages were left after using 19 stickers.  The answer 46 and therefore the question would be why is Mary using those stickers on the front pages of their journals.  The answer then would be the sticker page would then be 0 or 1 page because the answer is 46 after the 80 minus 3 plus 7 is 46.  Since this is not correct, I have to then think about how many stickers are in total in any given journal given she has 80 stickers in all.  This is because she used 3 for the front page of their journal and 7 for each page of their journal leaving them with 46 left stickers and 4 pages of their journal.  If you have 46 total and 4 pages on each journal this would then be 11.5 average stickers per journal page.  The answer would then be 82 on each journal for 20 stickers or 82-20=62 stickers left.<n><n>### Input Zach is saving his money for a brand new bike. He is getting paid $5 a week.

The pair of them takes turns asking a question and answering it. This continues until someone makes a complete sentence. For example, "Mom, does Dad like hockey?" Answer Dad is a really big hockey fan." If the game continues this way, the father always ends up winning. This is proven by the following statement: "Either the daughter asks her father a question, or her father, if he is in fact a winner of this game, asks her a question containing a sentence fragment. The only exceptions are when the pair of them have finished the game, or when neither of them can ask a question anymore." Is the father a winner of the game?<n>Output: True<n><n>Input: A tire dealership recently started selling tires that had a 2-year guarantee. They wanted to make sure that customers could get their money back even if the tire did not work in an amount of time equivalent to the length of the guarantee.  There were a number of problems with this program that needed to be worked out, such as the number and types of tires that would be sold. The first problem was to determine the number of tires that had to be sold so that the dealership had the maximum likely payout at any point in the first two years. Consider the first year of sales, when tires had the $300 guarantee.  Tires are sold on a sliding scale, with the price per tire decreasing by $0.25 per each of the first six months. After that, there is no price for the rest of the year. The price per tire in the second year increases by $100 if the number of tires sold last year exceeded the first year total. In the second year, tires sold have a $0 guarantee, while tires sold in the first year are guaranteed for $300. Find the price of the tires if the price must remain constant for the entire duration of the two-year sales period.  The price for the tires at the beginning of the second year must be at least the minimum price that can be achieved for the first year, minus any costs incurred by selling the tires. The minimum price for the first year will be 55 + (66-50)2 = 4

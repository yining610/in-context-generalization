The 10% of the people who need to replace soles on a regular basis tend to buy from you 90% of the time and keep coming back.  They pay $75 per sole.  They replace soles about once every three months.  Every time a customer buys your shoes an order of three comes in.  How much money do you make a month on average?<n>Output:<n>Each sole has three possibilities of being sold, therefore a month there are 90 opportunities to sell a sole  out of which you will be sold 30 times.  When you have a sole that you are able to sell, it makes $75 worth of money.  By looking at these two factors you can deduce that the average amount of money that you make in a month is:<n>$75*30*3*90=<<$75*3*90>>$2700.<n>

Choices: 4, 5, 6, 12, 0<n>Output: Since 60 = <<60=temperature>>temperature, patients temperature must have been around 100F. When a person’s temperature is <105 or 104, they start to become fatigued, when <99 they become hyper and when <95 they start to become cold intolerant (cannot handle cold). That means that the patients temperature must have been <=95F or <=94F or <=93F. Since < 96F or <=96F is 5 degrees cooler than 99F or <=99F, the patient only had 0 hours left of life since that is a 0 degree change.<n>So the answer is 0<n><n>Input: 7+x=13<n>Output: 20<n><n>Input: x=6 x>5 x<6<n>Output: True<n><n><n><n><n><n>

They don't list 2y as a variable, so to solve 2y, you must take the square root of that value, since 4a is a given value in the question. Since you can't take the square root of a negative number, I'm going to use a substitution instead of solving for 2y. Also, b > 1, so I can substitute x+2y for 4a. 3 (x+2y)<= 4a, which is equivalent to 9a <= 12x So I can substitute a and x for 9a and 12x respectively. I can cancel terms, so I have 12x <= 12a. I can simply solve for x by subtracting from 12a. Solving, I got x<= 9a/3 and since I can't multiply by a negative number, I am done.<n><n>Input: If 25 women and 10 men have 320 pieces of fruit.

If he goes fast each day, then he can work less and be more flexible.  On the other hand, because he works less time each day, his day is more stressful and he gets tired faster.  He has decided that he wants to be more flexible (doing the same work 80%) but not be very tired (doing the same thing for 90% of the time). Let’s say that each hour of work costs Mike 100 energy (for example, lifting 100 pounds might cost 1 unit of energy for Mike).  Then the workload in terms of time is described by the function:<n>f(x) = 0.8x + 100<n>How fast can Mike be to meet both goals?<n>Output: The equation Mike has to go is: 0.8x+100<n>If 0.8*100=<<0.8*12=96>>96, then Mike should go: 0.8*0.9 * 12=<<0.8*.09*12=108>>108.<n>So the final solution is 108.

Choices:  A: learning B: painful memories C: thinking D: awe inspiring E: pleasure<n>Output:		The only answer choice that uses the word "painful" is D.   There are other options to answer what this question is really asking.  In particular, D is a correct answer choice, as well as C (which uses the word "pains".)  The first answer choice, A, does not at all have the word "pain" or "painful" in it.<n>It's unclear how much thinking you need to do to determine whether you had a pleasant experience, or whether you need to determine this while experiencing the memory itself.<n>An other option could be B, since memories are often remembered in painful detail.  Or, C, since you sometimes think back on the joy you felt when you experienced the event, although the wording of the question doesn't allow for this.<n>Either of these other ways to answer this question are not incorrect ways for it to be answered (although maybe not the best.)<n><n>Input: There are 50 people at the company meeting.

The lower part is filled and the top part is empty. The liquid has flowed from the top of the hourglass to the bottom, at a constant rate. If the rate at which the liquid fell each second is proportional to the volume of liquid left in the top half of the hourglass, how long does it take for the hourglass to empty? If the time is x seconds the solution is 1/6<<<1/6<0>>0.<n>Output: This is a lot more complicated then it sounds at first, so before you answer it try to map it out graphically.    You actually do want to write it out in terms of x seconds because the answer you get will be equivalent to a function in terms of x.<n><n>You're looking for a solution in terms of x, but x is not the only variable that you are allowed to play with. You are allowed to work with the variables as an equation and take partial derivatives.<n>So the simplest thing to do is set x=1 and then solve from there.<n>The question asks about an hourglass, so a good first approximation would be that the slope of the graph would be a constant.<n>So the answer is that the function should be f(x)= x/6.<n>Also keep in mind that the slope is a derivative.<n>So  x/6=f'(x)=0.<n>Also, notice that a derivative at a point is equal to the slope of the tangent line at that point.<n>So f'(1)=0, f'(-1/6)=0, and f'(1+1/6)=0 because 1, -1/6, and 1+1/6 are all equivalent to 1.<n><n><n>Input: 4 and 5 is divided by 5 and result is 0.<n>Output:      This is a classic integer division<n><n>Input:   2/2 = 1 3/3 = 1<n>Output:      4 divded by 2 is 2 4 divided by 3 is 1.6667

Choices:  A: sun B: sky C: candle D: house E: lamp<n>Output:		There are lots of options that could be referred to as "light," but generally when I hear people talking about "light" they are referring to something like a sun or the sky. A sun or the sun is the most prominent source of light, so we can eliminate A(Sun), which has a more of a negative connotation than a positive one. Sky can be positive or negative, but sun definitely could not. Candle is most likely a negative connotation and thus not chosen, house is too specific, and lamp has multiple meanings. So then, we are left with this question. (C) What about the 1930's? Were they a candle, a house, the sky, the sun, or a lamp? The most likely answer is (C) the sky for 2 reasons. 1.) I can think of no other time when "sky" would not be a generally accepted answer. 2.) Of the 5 options, 4 are negative connotations, so out of those 4 we are left with "skies" as the most likely answer.<n><n>Input:Matt is not tall.<n>Output:  Matt has never been shorter than 6'6". <<SORRY TWO MISTAKES, FIXING>>

If a new sport, golf is introduced that includes eating, sleeping, and sports, which one of the three activities does he not like?<n>Output: We can use three or more lines of code or data in a program to provide the answer.<n>The first thing we need to do is get the activities.  We can do this by assigning them to variables.  We do this by typing Activity 1='eating' , Activity 2 ='sleeping' And Activity 3 ='sports'.  We are going to check to see if sport is John's favorite, or whether he likes sports or not.  if sport is John' choice, we will not let him do any sports, so we can just return the sports number or sport itself.  We can use either of these two options to do this.<n>#The first option we check is the sport variable which we set to nothing, if sport==N/A or sport!=John's sport, or if the sport itself is not valid.  Another way to check this, or the only way to check this for multiple values, we can use a for loop and the length of the list.  We have to add the 'else' section so our output contains only the valid sports.  This will take some thinking, but check it out, you can get by now.  All these activities can be done with 3 or more lines in a program.  We can use three or four lines in a program to do this.<n>Input:What is the value of number (3 ** 4) + number (5 ^3) - number (7 ** 1) + number (0 ** 0)?<n>Output: This is a question that was on my test.

His mom tried to find other waitressing jobs but eventually had to get a temp gig at a fast food restaurant.  His job didn't end up paying too much and they had to relocate to an even more remote area of the province.  <n><n>That area was a lot more rural than her area so Aaron's school bus only came only once a week.  Most of the time he had to walk but sometimes on days where it was very cold -30c°C° - that day the walk would be canceled.  So she just had to get up earlier and wake him up to walk over so late but that put them both under stress.  He would have to rush to catch his bus or try and hitch a ride with a good samaritan.   He got his own bike at the age of 6 but then found out there was a new road to this rural area and they would have an even longer walk to school just because the road was built.<n><n>This school bus situation affected his health as well.  He often went hungry.  He started bringing a peanut butter sandwich to school so he could eat that. The problem with that was that school had rules about bring peanut butter because it was associated with asthma.  He got a

And goggles are worn to see clearly under water.<n><n>Input: Bob goes to the movies every Tuesday. On a Tuesday that is not an election day, it costs 12 dollars to see two movies, and the total price is a few cents less than that. On an election day, it is 5 dollars to see one movie. On any other day, it is 18 dollars to see two moviess, and the total price will be a few cents more than that. What are the total prices Bob pays on an election day, and not an election day?<n>Output: Non-election-day price goes up 12-T, where T is the cost to see two movies. Election-day price goes down 12-T to 5.<n>So on a non-election day, Bob sees two movies and pays 26-T. On an election day he sees one movie and pays $<<5>>5.<n><n>The final answer is 26-T minus $5.$<<26-T - 5>><n><n>Input: James is taking photos.

These must be answered to be considered as correct answers. In order to answer this, we must first read the question and get a complete image of the question. There are two ways to read an embedded question:<n>*The first way is to look the question in terms of its context which also means you have to look in terms of its prepositions. Usually, the question is placed before an object in a question but since this is interjected, then you must look for the question in terms of context. Like for example here's the question in terms of prepositions.<n>"If you are known to buy presents for other often, you would be called what." Since you are known to buy gifts for others in a frequent way, you would be called a "gift buyer".<n><n>*The second way to read an embedded question is by removing special characters like? and then read the sentence by removing all the question marks and the sentence looks like If you are known to buy present for other often you would be called? We can see in this way that embedded question is If you are known to?  and then an embedded adverb is to buy presents for others?<n><n><n># Implementation<n><n>#!/bin/python3<n><n>import shutil, subprocess, sys, time<n>import json<n><n>def input_output_parser(data,path):<n>    #get data and convert the data into string array for checking whether the data is valid<n>    input_line = []<n>    for data in data:<n>        input_line.append(data)<n>    string_input = '\n\n'.join(input_line)<n><n>    temp_dir = "output_dir"<n><n>    #check whether the output path exists, if not, create the output path<n>    try:<n>        os.stat(path)<n>    except FileNotFoundError:<n>        os.makedirs(path)<n>    temp_output_file = os.path.join(path,string_input)<n>    if temp_output_file!= shutil.make_archive(path, extension="json") and int(time.time()) - int(time.time(os.path.getsize(temp_output_file)))>15:<n>        shutil

Which option should you choose if you don't mind wasting some money?<n>Output: If you spend 80cents to get all the shrimp and you go with option B, you have to get the shrimp. If you only have to get $23 worth, you won’t have to do this.  You will spend 10/2 =<<10/2=5>>5 cents for every shrimp.  In summary, get the whole set for a price of 80 cents, or get $23 worth for a price of ten cents<n><n>Input:There is only one way to order 23 and get a free shrimp for one cent. How much will you pay for that?<n>Output: You will have to order 24 shrimp to get the one free shrimp. The price for each shrimp is 1/2, which equals 0.5 in decimal.

He spends 1 hour each day lifting weight. Additionally, he also spends a third of his weightlifting time warming up and doing cardio each day.  How many hours does he spend at the gym a week?<n>Output: He spends 60/3=<<60/3=20>>20 minutes warming up<n>So he spends 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes at the gym per day<n>That means he spends 80*3=<<80*3=240>>240 minutes at the gym<n>So he spends 240/60=<<240/60=4>>4 hours at the gym a week<n>So the final answer is 4<n><n>Input: James has to refuel his plane.

How much does he pay now for fuel?<n>Output: The cost to fill a tank went up 200*.2=$<<200*.2=40>>40<n>So it cost 200+40=$<<200+40=240>>240 to fill the tank<n>That means he now pays 240*2=$<<240*2=480>>480<n>So the final answer is 480<n><n>Input:The keys were black and white, what were they attached to? Choices:  A: front pocket B: cabinet C: purse D: chain E: piano<n>Output:		A: The answer must be the front pocket. Only keys do have pockets. For cabinets, it's false for cabinet-colored keys.<n>For purse, it's false even if it's black. But the 1-dimensional array of keys can't possibly be associated with a purse. And a piano does have a front-door!<n>Similarly we can eliminate piano. For any choice other than front pocket, the array of keys are not the correct representation (but in theory an array can represent an array, which is a n-1 dimensional array with different color coding, or even a function).<n>So the final answer must be A<n><n>Input: When did they do the interview?  Yesterday Choices: A: 1st of Feb B: 2nd of Feb C: 3rd of Feb D: 4th of Feb<n>Output: The answer must be D(YD)  The interviewer could have said 'yesterday', but they would not say 1st of February, 3rd of February or etc. Because the interviewer does not know the day of the month, the probability of guessing the correct day is a constant.<n>So the probability of guessing it as D is 1/7(i.e. 1/40). The constant can be factored to (1/7)*(1/21) = (1/49)*(1/7) = 1/350.<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n><n>Input : Adam bought 3 kilos of nuts and 1 kilo of dried-fruits at a store ; one kilo of nuts cost $12 and one kili of dried-fruit cost $8.<n>How much did his purchases costs<n>Answer : <<<<<<3*12=$36>>>>>><n>And<<<<<<2.5*7=$20>>>>>><n>So in total for purchases Adam pays $36+20=$56>>>>><n>So the answer is 56 <n><n>###Instructions: Answer the following multiple-choice questions.<n><n>Input :John goes to the gym atleast 3 times a week<n>He spends 1 hour per day lifting weights ;  Additionally he spends 1/3 of

Choices:  A: ungulate B: bomber C: body armor D: tank E: hat<n>Output:		A: ungulate - When a cannonball flies through air it creates a shockwave that can hurt people. Cannons are more accurate (likely to hit someone/thing) when aiming at people and animals (ungulates) because they get the shockwave to their bodies.<n>B: bomber - A bomber plane is a special plane that is designed to fly really fast and really high and drop bombs on groups of enemies or enemy cities. It's made of heavy steel that protects it from cannonballs.<n>C: body armor - Cannonballs are metal, and since the armor protects your body it would work to protect you from both bullets (which are also made of metal) and cannonballs (since body armor is made for that exact thing). [Cannons don't shoot cannonballs, they shoot cannibals. The ball is made of lead or some other toxic metal.]<n>D: tank - Tanks have thick shells (armor) to protect them from bullet fire. It's likely that a tank wouldn't be harmed by a cannonball because cannonballs are made out of heavy metal and won't break through the tanks shells or armor<n>E: hat In 1763 John Adams invented the first military hat, and in 1764 he invented the first military helmet. Hats are made to protect people from harsh forces of nature and people are made to protect us from harsh forces and nature like bullets and cannonballs. [What does a hat protect you from? Bullets from war-torn battlefields and cannonballs from Civil War-era cannons. What does your body protech you from? People like the bad guys.]<n><n><n>### Instruction:Answer the followeing multiple choice problems using loops.<n><n>The input for each problem is a string of numbers - if the string is even, it is the weight of the dog.

Given the sample<n>input: A: You want to buy a car in a hurry. B: That is expensive, you should take a walk.<n>The only incorrect answer for choice B is: C: You are looking at the wrong way.

Choices:  A: tenacity B: hands C: coaster D: skill E: breaking<n>Output:		3 and 4 make sense, so they both don't matter.   And since there's a lot of options for a coaster, he could buy one or two if he wanted but there's no need to put the cup down unless he has to get something underneath, or he has to pick the cup up.  And skill is too specific for someone who's picking up a cup to put down.   So B hands or E breaking are the only reasonable and valid answers.<n><n>Input: He tried to jump up but he was too heavy, so that’s why they didn’t go on the roller coaster.<n>Output: A:  There's plenty of time once they get to the airport, and once they get there. B:  He might not have asked because he's embarrassed since it's something he can't do, and C:  He might not be embarrassed to ask to go on the rollercoaster, he should have still asked.<n><n>Input: I spent 455$ to buy 500$ worth of food.<n>Output: 37$ is the answer because buying food costs less than the food costs.<n><n>Input: The man set the cup on table. It didn't matter because there were no other options to do with the cup.  The man didn't want to put it on anything besides the table and he didn't have any option for a balance because he wasn't creative enough to figure out a way to balance it.<n><n>Output: No because it would take away from how he feels about himself in the future.<n><n>Input: You set the cup on the ground and went to the store.  You didn't care where you place the cup because it didn't matter once you go to your destination.<n><n>Output: I am not satisfied because we were taught to give up.

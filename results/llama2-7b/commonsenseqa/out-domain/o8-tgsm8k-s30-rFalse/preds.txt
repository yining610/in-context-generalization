Choices:  A: backpack B: bookcase C: office supply store D: office E: class room<n>Output:		A<n><n>#### Explanations:<n>* The answer is $190<n><n>* This question is asking us how many hours it takes to make each trip that Jason drives to the town.<n><n>* For 1 day = 1 day/$50 = ($50 * 1 = $50).So 14 trips = 14 * $50 = $700. For 20 trips 20 * $50 = 1000. So it's 1400 + 1000 = $2400 per year<n><n>* Because the number of boys in that family is 5 and that's 3/4 of the total. So the total number of children in that family is 18/5 = 3.6 and each boy receive 3900/3.6 = 1076.5 for boys.<n><n>* It is asking us to find the number x which satisfies 5/x = 7/7+2x. <n><n>* Because the total number of children is 101+78+55 = 234, Kelly has found 6+7+12 = 25 carrots weighing 1 pound at total weight of 25*6 = 150 pounds.<n><n>* Iris' family is including her mother, three uncles and aunts. She has one brother and four aunts. Each aunt has one son and one daughter. Iris has one uncle and one uncle. Her brother has no relations. So the total count would be 5 + 5 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 18<n><n>#### 7112<n><n>### <n><n>#### Questions

In this problem, it is clear that it is asked as a part of a larger picture. A person can rent a car for a whole week, or the whole month. It also says that the rental fee for the length of a week is $190, and it also offers a discount that when someone rents it for the length of more than a whole week the discount price is a total of $30 per day. If a person rents it for 11 days then he could save around $70. This is how the question is supposed to be answered.<n><n>In the second question, the question asks about the travel time that would be needed to move all the cattle down to the higher ground. The answer is the total of driving time per hour can be calculated by multiplying the quantity of head and the speed of the car which is 60 miles per hours. In this question it is very clear that the answer to the question is going to be 20 because the truck can only hold a maximum of 25 head of cattle, and so the maximum of cattle the truck can move is going to be an integer less than the total amount of the amount of head of cattle there are.<n><n>Input: Mel…<n><n>The third problem is again a multiple choice problem, and it ask about the question of time of driving a car that she is using to go back and forth to the town to buy supplies.

What is the average total value of the ice cream cones?<n>Output: 60.40<n><n><n>### Solution:<n>In instructions <n>	-1: You just multiply 30 by 11 = 330<n>	<n>	-2: To answer this question there are two variables to take into account: The driving time between the destination and the house, and the transporting rate of the truck.<n>	Lets write them as driving time and transporting rate respectively.<n>	To work out driving time we need the number of cattle (let call it N) and the number of days (let call it O), and then we divide their product ( N*O) by the transporting rate to get the product of the ratio. For this instance N is 400 and O is 60, so 24000 is the product of the ratio (400*.60). Because we are trying to calculate the whole driving time, we have to multiply that with the transporting rate (2*60=120), then add the other times taken when going back to take in account the return. So the driving time to take care of all the cattle is twice the transporting rate divided by the product of the ratio, which is finally: 120/24000<n>	To work out the transportation rate, first work out the number of cattle that will be transported in each trip and dividing them by the transportation rate we get the product of the  rate. So to travel with the cattle we need a truck and not a car, so then its the inverse of 1 20 *1 is 20. so N_p/N = p, now N is 40 and the p is the transportation rate.<n>	<n>So transporting rate=20/400. Then we multiply transporting rate by the amount of trips we have to go back and forth to take the cattle to the new place and finally we

Justify your suggestion.<n><n>Instructions: You have been hired as the head chef of a Chinese restaurant. You have been informed that the restaurant was experiencing a major challenge with food loss in its kitchen. Provide at least three suggestions that you would make to prevent unnecessary food loss/waste. Justify your suggestion giving examples of your suggestions.<n><n>### Example response<n><n>Instrument: My Suggestions/Advice<n><n>I would advise a restaurant’s owner to have an inventory of fresh food ingredients. This is because food ingredients usually turn stale and are disposed of resulting in losses. In my experience, restaurant owners should be aware of whether ingredients are stale before using them for cooking purposes. However, this can be determined from their inventory. By keeping a fresh supply of stock, the restaurant does not incur unnecessary losses and can still offer a variety of food choices to their customers.<n><n>Another suggestion is to avoid preparation for the day to day operations. In my experience, restaurateurs should consider their customers’ needs in scheduling their cooking activities. They should only schedule food preparation for when it is needed. This means that when the restaurant does not have many customers, they are not preparing ingredients that will be wasted when they do not sell. Thereby, the restaurant reduces its food loss/waste since only what is needed is cooked and serves its purpose.<n><n>Finally, an inventory of ingredients may help the restaurant avoid food spoilage.

For example, there is a common word in English that has two different spellings.  (It is a good idea to learn these words so they are not confusing.)

Chinese: "naireg" (the pinyin spelling of the Chinese character). Brazilian Portuguese: "laranja" ("orange" pronounced as /aw-RAHN-zu/ in Brazilian Portuguese, as opposed to the British pronunciation of "aw-RAN-z", which is not used in Brazil).  French: "orangé" and Dutch: "oranje"/In English, "orange" does not sound like any of those words and means "a yellow color".  How do these words sound?<n>Output: A<n>

It goes something like this. “I asked a waiter why he was eating a burger with so many pickles on it. He said it was because he preferred the bun. I said, ‘Would you like a pickle bun then?’” Now I wish I had written down the real punchline. How would you figure it out?<n>Output: I would probably guess that “pickle bun” is supposed to sound funny to English-speaking listeners.  If, when you ask a waiter why he eats so many pickles on a burger, he tells you that he prefers the bun, a good punchline would be to ask if you can buy a pickle bun.  Because the waiter (presumably) does not enjoy the sight of pickles on everything he eats, he will not be excited about a pickle bun--that is, the burger bun with so many pickles will not have become a pickle bun, with the extra pickles being inedible to the waiter.<n>A:  The punchline is: What should you order at a fast food restaurant when given the choice between 'Double-Double animal style' and 'Double-Double with veggie on toasted bread'?<n>B:  The punch line is: What should you give someone who says they want a burger with lots of pickles on it?<n>C

Also  the sum of all numbers, minus (arrival at the remainder), will be multiplied by the original n and print that as well. <n><n>## Examine:<n><n>### Instruction:<n>-Create a function called “sumremainder”. The return value for this function will print the location of the remainder starting index until the end of the array of numbers are reached.<n><n>-Create a function, called “sumsubtract”. The return value for the main function, is the values of the sum of all the elements minus the sum of all the array of numbers plus the remainder sum value and the remainder.<n><n>-Create two more functions, “printn” and “printremainder”. For both of these you need to add a parameter for the number of entered values. These functions will print out each number and the remainder, respectively. <n><n><n>### Remarks:<n>- The remainder is created by getting the sum, subtracting it from 23 and subtracting it by dividing it by 22.  The remainder is then multiplied by 23 and 22, but only 22, because there will be no remainder in the second to last index. Afterwards only the indexes that have a remainder value less then the remainder value are printed. <n><n>-The first index is not in the array of numbers because it does not include -1.<n><n>-If the remainder is set to 0, then there will not be any numbers printed after it. The remainder will also be displayed with the sum of 23. This happens because of a division by zero error.<n><n>-An odd number may be in the array of numbers, but we are only looking for the even indexes to be used in the sum equation and will ignore the odd indexes.<n> <n>-The sum of each array of numbers minus the array index where remainder is

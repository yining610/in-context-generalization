{"text": "A\n\n#### Explanations:\n* The answer is $190\n\n* This question is asking us how many hours it takes to make each trip that Jason drives to the town.\n\n* For 1 day = 1 day/$50 = ($50 * 1 = $50).So 14 trips = 14 * $50 = $700. For 20 trips 20 * $50 = 1000. So it's 1400 + 1000 = $2400 per year\n\n* Because the number of boys in that family is 5 and that's 3/4 of the total. So the total number of children in that family is 18/5 = 3.6 and each boy receive 3900/3.6 = 1076.5 for boys.\n\n* It is asking us to find the number x which satisfies 5/x = 7/7+2x. \n\n* Because the total number of children is 101+78+55 = 234, Kelly has found 6+7+12 = 25 carrots weighing 1 pound at total weight of 25*6 = 150 pounds.\n\n* Iris' family is including her mother, three uncles and aunts. She has one brother and four aunts. Each aunt has one son and one daughter. Iris has one uncle and one uncle. Her brother has no relations. So the total count would be 5 + 5 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 18\n\n#### 7112\n\n### \n\n#### Questions", "answer": "E: class room"}

For this instance N is 400 and O is 60, so 24000 is the product of the ratio (400*.60). Because we are trying to calculate the whole driving time, we have to multiply that with the transporting rate (2*60=120), then add the other times taken when going back to take in account the return. So the driving time to take care of all the cattle is twice the transporting rate divided by the product of the ratio, which is finally: 120/24000\n\tTo work out the transportation rate, first work out the number of cattle that will be transported in each trip and dividing them by the transportation rate we get the product of the  rate. So to travel with the cattle we need a truck and not a car, so then its the inverse of 1 20 *1 is 20. so N_p/N = p, now N is 40 and the p is the transportation rate.\n\t\nSo transporting rate=20/400. Then we multiply transporting rate by the amount of trips we have to go back and forth to take the cattle to the new place and finally we", "answer": "A: zoo"}

You have been informed that the restaurant was experiencing a major challenge with food loss in its kitchen. Provide at least three suggestions that you would make to prevent unnecessary food loss/waste. Justify your suggestion giving examples of your suggestions.\n\n### Example response\n\nInstrument: My Suggestions/Advice\n\nI would advise a restaurant\u2019s owner to have an inventory of fresh food ingredients. This is because food ingredients usually turn stale and are disposed of resulting in losses. In my experience, restaurant owners should be aware of whether ingredients are stale before using them for cooking purposes. However, this can be determined from their inventory. By keeping a fresh supply of stock, the restaurant does not incur unnecessary losses and can still offer a variety of food choices to their customers.\n\nAnother suggestion is to avoid preparation for the day to day operations. In my experience, restaurateurs should consider their customers\u2019 needs in scheduling their cooking activities. They should only schedule food preparation for when it is needed. This means that when the restaurant does not have many customers, they are not preparing ingredients that will be wasted when they do not sell. Thereby, the restaurant reduces its food loss/waste since only what is needed is cooked and serves its purpose.\n\nFinally, an inventory of ingredients may help the restaurant avoid food spoilage.", "answer": "A: insubstantial"}

It goes something like this. \u201cI asked a waiter why he was eating a burger with so many pickles on it. He said it was because he preferred the bun. I said, \u2018Would you like a pickle bun then?\u2019\u201d Now I wish I had written down the real punchline. How would you figure it out?\nOutput: I would probably guess that \u201cpickle bun\u201d is supposed to sound funny to English-speaking listeners.  If, when you ask a waiter why he eats so many pickles on a burger, he tells you that he prefers the bun, a good punchline would be to ask if you can buy a pickle bun.  Because the waiter (presumably) does not enjoy the sight of pickles on everything he eats, he will not be excited about a pickle bun--that is, the burger bun with so many pickles will not have become a pickle bun, with the extra pickles being inedible to the waiter.\nA:  The punchline is: What should you order at a fast food restaurant when given the choice between 'Double-Double animal style' and 'Double-Double with veggie on toasted bread'?\nB:  The punch line is: What should you give someone who says they want a burger with lots of pickles on it?\nC", "answer": "A: relax"}

Then subtract the sum of the array from 23, to find the remainder.\n\nThe output will print the index where the remainder starts and will stop at as it reaches the end of the array. Also  the sum of all numbers, minus (arrival at the remainder), will be multiplied by the original n and print that as well. \n\n## Examine:\n\n### Instruction:\n-Create a function called \u201csumremainder\u201d. The return value for this function will print the location of the remainder starting index until the end of the array of numbers are reached.\n\n-Create a function, called \u201csumsubtract\u201d. The return value for the main function, is the values of the sum of all the elements minus the sum of all the array of numbers plus the remainder sum value and the remainder.\n\n-Create two more functions, \u201cprintn\u201d and \u201cprintremainder\u201d. For both of these you need to add a parameter for the number of entered values. These functions will print out each number and the remainder, respectively. \n\n\n### Remarks:\n- The remainder is created by getting the sum, subtracting it from 23 and subtracting it by dividing it by 22.  The remainder is then multiplied by 23 and 22, but only 22, because there will be no remainder in the second to last index. Afterwards only the indexes that have a remainder value less then the remainder value are printed. \n\n-The first index is not in the array of numbers because it does not include -1.\n\n-If the remainder is set to 0, then there will not be any numbers printed after it. The remainder will also be displayed with the sum of 23. This happens because of a division by zero error.\n\n-An odd number may be in the array of numbers, but we are only looking for the even indexes to be used in the sum equation and will ignore the odd indexes.\n \n-The sum of each array of numbers minus the array index where remainder is", "answer": "D: field of flowers"}

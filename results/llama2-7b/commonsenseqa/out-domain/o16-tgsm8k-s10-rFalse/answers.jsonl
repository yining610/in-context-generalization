The percent increase was 20%, so 1 * 20% will be.2, which we put on our calculator and multiply the numbers by to get the new price.\n\nThe number of times we need to multiply the item price is just found by multiplying the original quantity by the new quantity, or number of items you purchased.

The system uses a stack to store the first character, second character, and so on.\n\nTo add characters, we push the new character onto the stack.\n\nWhen we need to add a new character to the sequence, we will pop the first character from the stack, and add the new character in its place. We need to add each new character exactly once, which requires a while loop counting from `0`.\n\nThe first line of the input contains the total length of the string. The subsequent lines contain the string.\n\nAfter completing the processing, we print the string.\n\n**Problem-Suitable?**\n\nFor this problem, we could simply sort the string and remove the first element, or we can use the stack data structure and process each character one by one. With the stack data structure, we can avoid repeated characters, and can easily process different types of strings.\n\n\n```python\n# Python program to accept string and print its reverse\n\nn = int(input().strip())\ns = input()\ns = list(s)\nprint(s[::-1])\n```\n\n\n\n```python2\n# Python Program to Convert Roman number to Arabic number\n\n# Function to find out the\n# difference between digit of two number\ndef diff(a, b):\n    if a < b: return a - b\n    return b - a\n\n\ndef roman_to_number(roman):\n    roman_str = list(roman)\n    output_num = 0\n    output_num_list = ['Zero', 'One', 'Two', 'Three', 'Four', 'Five', 'Six', 'Seven', 'Eight', 'Nine']\n    i = 0\n\n    while i < len(roman_str):\n        num = roman_str[i]", "answer": "C: computer science"}

The amount of fuel you used will be determined by your launch from its launch point. For instance, if you are launching from earth to Mars and you use half the fuel you launch with, then when you return, your carrot weighs twice as much and you will need to use twice as much fuel to continue its journey. If you do not have sufficient fuel, then you will be unable to continue its journey and will need to land back on earth. The amount of fuel required to return to earth from Mars is the sum of all fuel requirements of all journeys from Mars to wherever, with the cost for each journey being equal to the fuel required for that journey.\n\nThe input consists of a series of space-separated, non-negative integer pairs representing earth-mars distance and rocket length.\n\nThe output consists of three space-separated floating-point numbers representing the cost of the trip from earth to mars and two round trip times from earth to venus and back and from venus to mars and back.\n\nExample Input: 125 200\n\nExample Output: 0.000000 625.0000 0.009245 3482.0000\n\n### Instructions:Answer the coding exercise.\n\nThere are two coins.

I can assume this is true for the entire program and thus we assume there are two input statements and an output statement.\n\n- As to explain step1, the input (line 1-19) is not clear. However by using line 14, where a price of 500 is added. This is the desired output.\n\n- Same as line 5, as 800 is added to input line 24, this is the goal.\n\n- line 9 to 10 have an error, because the equation that should be used after step1 was multiplier * value * 0.1 * (10), a sum would be needed to add all inputs.

{"text": "The spoon is never on the placemat.  So the only remaining choices are B, C and D.\nThe spoon is never in the bowl of soup because it's too tall and is always put upright to drink.  The spoon is never in a glass of Iced Tea because the  table setting is served on the side of the glass.  The spoon only appears to be on the glass of iced tea because the plate and glass are facing downward.  The spoon never appears on the table setting because it's on a plate and must never touch a flat surface.  Therefore the spoon must be on the placemat or the serving dish, with the placemat being the only place with flat surface.\nThe spoon goes on the plate when it is done serving.  When it is done serving it is put on the placemat but it must never touch a table and so is moved to the serving dish.\nSince only one object can be on top of another without touching, the placemat wins because the plate will never be completely on top of the placemat.\n\nInput:A pond is circular with a radius of 7 miles. A bridge is to be constructed so that it reaches all the way around the pond. How much more bridge is required to make the circle an ellipse?\nOutput: If an ellipse were constructed then the  x-coordinate for all points on the ellipse would be different.  A point along the original radius for an ellipse would be x = r cos theta /  r with sin theta.   The sin theta for one point along the original radius is equal to 0 and the others are >0 and < 1.  The ellipse is constructed such that it is centered on the original radius so that r = 7* (r cos (theta)) /  (r sin  theta).  The area outside the ellipse would have to be subtracted from the original circle.   This is 4*pi*r*r = 288.  That is 288/ 7*(7* (r cos theta))/ (r sin theta).  Note that only one factor varies, not both r and r sin theta.  The result should be much more than 1.2.\n\nInput:Which of the following types of transport", "answer": "C: table setting"}

{"text": "A: gy mnasiu  m\nB: motel room\nC: seashore\nD: bath room\nE: locker room\n\nExplanation:  motel is derived from the words  mo (in) telo (inn) and  motel=mo(in) telo(inn)el so  motel=mo  telo el\n\nInput:Gymnassia\nOutput:gy mnasiu\n(The letters m and n are pronounced in the same way.  \"Gy\" represents letters pronounced with a hard G sound.  Greek spellings are quite complicated, and if we wanted this to also work in Spanish, we'd have to deal with \"x\", \"j\" and \"ch\")\n\nInput: The letters in the word  moist are m, o, i, and s. So if we \"spell out\" the letters in the word mop, it is M=6 O=15 P=16 and so on.  If we had wanted to spell out the whole words we could have started with M=600 and O=1000. The word moist has 17 letters (m and o have been removed).\nWe can figure the number of letters in the word by doing M = 600 * (17-6) / 15 and getting 1307.\nThe total number of letters in the  whole sentence is 6 letters.  Because the first word in the sentence had four letters and the rest of the  words are of one syllable each, the first word is the only word consisting of four letters.  Therefore, the number of syllables per word  is always (500 - the number of letters in one of the five one-syllable words).  So  if we divide 570 (the 500 - the 3 one-syllable letters of the word moist) by 15,  we come up with 38 which is the number of letters  the first word contains.\n\nSolution:The number of syllables in this type of sentence is the number of letters minus the number if letters in the first word. As this is \nthe only word with more than 3 letters, this is true. Divide 600 by 15 to get the number of letters", "answer": "B: motel room"}

If the employee earns 1.50 per 1 hour, the employee gets paid 1.50 each time he/she works. If the worker works 50 hours, the worker has made 50*1.50=<<50*1.20=75>>75$ so, the worker has earned 75$. After earning this much money, the worker must rest. Let rest=n.\n\nAfter waking up, he/she can use this money to continue his/her job. So earning = 75$ and working 50 hours = Let\u2019 time=n, then time = 75/50 = 1.5\n\n\n# This code is currently stuck on test 17 \n# Please complete this code\n# and submit it to the class", "answer": "E: row boat"}

At the time of construction he can use only two kinds of wood: Hickory and Fir. To get to work, he moves from point A on a road to his work site by using a bus which, in turn, travels for 1 hour along a mountain highway from point A to the outskirts of town. After finishing his construction work, he rides the bus back to point A. Unfortunately, the bus leaves only once a day.  Determine the minimum number of construction days it will take him to complete the house.\nOutput: Given the man's work site is at location H, he must travel at 150 mph from location A to the house construction site. From the bus station, he travels at 40 mph on the bus to construction site H. Thus, construction will take 150-40=<<150-4=110>>110 days.\nThe man travels at 150mph from H back to A.\nThus, the man goes back and forth between his construction site and A in 110 days.

The bounty hunter arrives and is able to track their quarry to where he is hiding.  There are two ways for one to reach Blow\u2019s hide-out, but they are both inefficient.  The first way would be to take his car (1 hour), drive it to the rail station (2 hours in transit), and then take a train to  the railway station nearest his brother\u2019s house (2 hours).  The other way, would be to take the car, drive to the nearest railway station (4 hours), and then take the train to his brother\u2019s house.  Aside from the distance that is covered, both paths are of the same length (10 hours). If the bounty hunter wants to return to headquarters immediately after the mission, which choice would he prefer, if any? Explain.\n\nOutput: The two paths are both 10 hours in length.  Since one is going to have to get into the car, there is the additional cost of leaving the car for an hour at either location.  So either way, the combined time plus an additional hour for getting from vehicle to rail station would be 11 hours.\nThe bounty hunter would prefer not to take the train if he had any choice at all.\nSo the only path he would prefer is the one where he drives the car to its destination.\n\nInput: Which is the most dangerous airborne substance to breathe?  \nA: Sulfur dioxide    B: Sulfuric acid    C: Sulfur    D: Sulfur\n\nOutput: Air has different properties due to altitude. \nEvidence of aerosols and gasses in the atmosphere has been found to reach much further than just ground level.

She'll be stuck.  Start with all the balls, since it's a no-brainer that you can put as many balls as you like.  Choosing the first ball, and placing it in the box, she has no blocks (since it is not a ball-to-block pair), and she has no more balls (since she's already placed as many as she can).   She can choose a block - any block, since any choice will give her no more balls to place, and a block-to-ball pair (since it has to go by balls, and the first ball is placed).  If it's not the last ball to come into the box, the second ball, she can place it into a blank spot on right side of the box, using another block-to-ball-pair as the base.  Repeat with any block.

The number \"17\" is not prime due to the fact that it can be divided equally by the whole as 17/1=<<17/1=1>>1 and 2.  The number \"97\" is also not prime due to the same reason.  Thus, we can eliminate these two values.

If we choose 4 tires which have the same chance to be repaired, 1 out of 4 have the chance to get repaired. We will choose the ones which have the highest rate to repaire and put 3 tires to repaire. And they have 90% rate to get repaired, which is the highest rate. Thus, our expectation will be repaired since we repaired 3 times more than the rate, which is 3/1. Since 4/3 doesn't matter to choose them to repair or not, we will choose 4/3 and have 9/13 in total, the expected rate of getting repaired will be 9/13.\nThis 9/13 will be the probability that the repair station is repaired, we will use it for the probability to choose 1 tire to be repaired and the other 3 to have the highest chance.\n\nWe will chose 4 out of 16=<<4 out of 15=11>>11, which will have the 9/13 chance of getting repaired.

Choice A : Decreasing B : Increasing.\nOutput: Correct answer is option C. Non-smooth\n\nInput: If a function is smooth all of its derivatives are continuous and differentiable at all points. This is true even when the the derivative is a non-linear function of two or more variables. Choice A: True. B: False. C: We know nothing about smoothness of a function of more than one variable.\nOutput: Choice A is correct since\nSmooth: Smoothness requires that the function has to be continuous and differentiable on the entire domain.\n\nInput: A function has a derivative does not neccesarily have to be a smooth function. A function will only be smooth exactly on its domain. Smoothness requires that there is differentiability on the entire domain. It can be defined locally with respect to an arbitrary closed interval, so long as the function has a positive lower and upper bound on this interval. Choice A: Both statements can be true. B: The statement on the right can be interpreted in two ways. One is that the funtion can be defined on a closed interval so long as the function is differntiable on that interval. The second is that the function can be defined on a open interval so long as the funtion is continuous on that interval.\nOutput: It is a function not a domain and so the statement in bold in the choice B is the correct statement, but it is still not correct.\n\nInput:  Consider the function: f(x,y,z) = x, where x, y and z represent variable that can be either reals or complex numbers.

Choices: A) 30 minutes B) 7 hours C) 5 hours D) 80 minutes E) 5 hours F) 18 hours G) 10 hours\nOutput: The correct response given the provided choices is \u201cF\u201d: 180 minutes. First we note that none of the choices are \u201cmore than\u201d the given set; thus 180 is not the smallest possible number in the set we are provided.  Next we note that all other choices are \u201cless than\u201d 180; thus, 180 is the largest possible number in the set. In this case, choosing 180 solves all of the provided conditions (180 \u2265 30, 180 \u2265  7, 180 < 5, 180 > 80, 18 > 10).\n\nInput: 65 divided by 10\nOutput: The value 65 is an integer and is not an even number.

Therefore there isn\u2019t an integer-based division, thus the answer for 65 divided by ten is 0.65.\n\nInput: In 2005, Google stock (GOOG) traded at $85, rising more than $15 per share with each passing week during that year.

After the hiring a 25-year-old assistant manager complained to him about the choice because in the past the 35-year old had had major surgery on a knee that was very valuable to his pitching abilities.\nWhich best describes the reasoning by the 25-year old assistant?\nChoices: A:The manager's logic was faulty because although the 35- year-old had recovered fully from the knee surgery at the present time, the present age of the pitcher is 35 and the manager was looking for a 25- year-old.\n\nB:The manager's reasoning was faulty because in the past, the older pitcher had a valuable knee that provided substantial help to his performance in the game and it was logical to suppose that the same was not true now.\n\nC:The manager's choice was faulty because of ageism.\n\nD: The manager's choice appears to be correct because based on one past event, it may be reasonable to come to the conclusion that the same will hold true for the present as well.\n\nE: None of the above\nOutput:The correct answer could be choice \"B\" or the correct answer could be an argument based on the principle of \"scientific induction\".  Scientific induction is the basis for much scientific reasoning.\nThe basis is that \"in the past we found that when we did 'x' we got 'y' (the relationship is established by observation).

If we cannot recognize a significant difference, it is not wise to draw this conclusion.\nA manager's reasoning would seem to rest on the foundation of scientific induction.\n\nInput: How much", "answer": "E: erections"}

The walls of the container are made of tissue paper, which is 0.0003 inch thick at its thickest point. One of the balloons is inflated with air, and the other is inflated by 0.14 times atmospheric pressure in absolute terms. If the air pressure has been measured by the scientists to be 103 kPa, the difference in pressure between the balloon without the pressure applied internally and the air pressure outside the container is approximately 2368 Pa (at constant temperature). Estimate the volume of one of the balls.\nOutput: The volume of an object in a rectangular container is the product of the depth of the container and the width and the height of the object. The height of the balloon is equal to the depth of the container, because there is an air pressure equal to the atmospheric pressure on the outside walls of the container. The volume of the balloon, then, is equal to the container's width and height times the atmospheric pressure. 2368=<<2368=2368>>2368Pa.\nSo the balloon is 0.0615 in^3, and the volume of the other volume is equal to 0.06-1/2.

It is the \"ones\" place.\nThe 10s place is two to the power of 2 or 1*1 or 1 and so 10 is 2^2 or 2*0*2 or 2*1*2.\n\nThe 100s place is three to the power of 3 or 1*1*1*1 or 4.\nThe 1,000s place is four to the power of 4 or 1*10^0 (which is 1*1.)\nSo the 1000s place has a 4.\n\nThe 0100s place has 5 digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 in sequence, each with a value of 5*5*4*4*4/65536 which is 0.43536 = 43.536 (rounded)\nThe 000000s place will have 4 more digits 0, 0, 0.", "answer": "E: plantation"}

How would you get a copy on time for the police?\nOutput:\nIf he gets a copy on time for police, he must get information from arrival hall because he doesn't know the departure airport and doesn't know where departure hall is. The problem is he has to get information from the airport where he had just got off the plane. It's impossible to transfer his information from his departure airport to his arrival airport.\n\nInput:Three boxes contain weights:1,2,3kg.

She's paid $80 by a family she's helping that evening, but they've got 4 kids with a total age of 33...how much more, in terms of dollars, did she charge the family? Explain your answer.\nOutput: Since the babysitter charges for each year of the child's age, 33*2.5=<<33*2.0=83>>83 dollars are added to the price of the child.\nShe is paid $80 for 3 children.\nAdding 83 to 80, we get $80+$83=<<80+$83>=163>>163.\n163 is less than 80.\nSo the family paid the babysitter $80.\n\nInput: In order to complete a crossword puzzle, it takes you 80 minutes and 14 cigarettes.

{"text": "The correct answer is A. Eating breakfast in bed can lead to feeling like throwing up when you drop food everywhere in the sheets.\nThe only correct answer is not D because it is not pleasurable to eat breakfast at all.\nBreakfast in bed, or sitting up in bed, will only lead you to vomit.\nYou can not feel contentment or happiness if you were eating in bed, and you will certainly not be feeling any contentment or happiness or eating whatever you have broken (unless it is a donut or some other edible mess-making food item).\nA donut can cause you to vomit which will lead you to feel like vomiting.

This is because if you remove the leaping day, you will leave 12 months, rather than 13, and 06 is divisible by 4, rather than divisible by 7.\nAnd if you are concerned about having that day fall on a specific month, March has a one in six chance of landing with a leaping day, and October has a one in seven and September has a one in eight chance of a leaping day. So September is the least likely of these months to contain a leaping day.", "answer": "D: contentment"}

I will explain how this works:\nThe correct answer to solving this question is Choice 4.  However, the correct answer should not be what the clock is actually detecting but the reason for the clocks failure.\nThe clock is detecting the fact that the power came on suddenly because as we know the circuit requires a signal/clock to run.

The landlocked southern states are: A: louisiana and arkansas, B: Kentucky and Tennessee,and C: West Virginian and Pennsylvania D: Maine and New Hampshire,\nSo the final answer should be C because it covers two states.\n\nInput: In December of 1996 the temperature in Winnipeg, Canada, ranged from a low of -41.6 \ufffdC (-42.88 \ufffdF) on the 1st day to a high of +1.1 \ufffdC (33.98 \ufffdF) three weeks later on the 23rd.  On an average of 73% of all possible days, what is the average temperature for all of those days, in \ufffdF? (The conversion is 1 \ufffdC=32.0 \ufffdF.)\nOutput: The average of a range of values is a value that is in the middle of a range of values.  Therefore the simple way to calculate this is to first determine the midpoint of the range (1.1 - 33.98)/2 = -22.43 \ufffdC / -22.44 \ufffdF.\nThen, the average of a set of numbers that is equal to 73 percent of all possible results is (22.44 - 1.1)/ 1/1 = 21.80 \ufffdF.\nThe average temperature for all of the days in that month ranged from 0.545 \ufffdC/ 32.76 \ufffdF on the 1st to -50.3 \ufffdC/-58.5 \ufffdF on the midpoint to 5.1 \ufffdC/ 41.2 \ufffdF on the final day.\n\nInput: A soccer ball is in play in the penalty area, and the penalty kick is being taken (and it has been completed).

{"text": "The plain is an example of a plainland or a plain. When a deep and wide opening like a hole or a gorge occurs in a plainland, that opening is called a gorge.\n\nInput:When a pebble and a rock are resting on a plain tabletop, the rock is heavier and will stay on the table, but the pebble will be moved off. Thus, heavier things are said to \"outweigh\" lighter things on scales of weight. This is because greater weight \"weighs\" more in comparison. What name is given to the greater weight of something in comparison to something lighter?\nOutput: When the scales are of unequal weight, the heavier weight is able to balance the lighter weight and they will come to a standstill when they balance. A balance (from the Latin, bilanx) is a scale on which one weighs something. A balance beam is a scale for very accurate measurements of weights.

{"text": "After going for a run you have what I call a \u2018runner\u2019s high\u2019.\n\n<div>'Runner\u2018s high' is the euphoric sensation associated with running that researchers at the University of Michigan have linked to the release of natural opioids and other endorphins by the body.\n\nThe opioids have an analgesic (pain-killing) effect, and researchers think the release of endorphins leads to a feeling of pleasure in the exercise. Endorphins are neurotransmitters (chemicals that transmit messages from one nerve cell to another or to the brain). They are released in response to stress, injury and exercise (including high-intensity exercise) and may help block pain.\n\nIn an article published in the September/October 1994 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), the University of Michigan study found that after marathon runners had exercised, their blood contained four to six times normal concentrations of these substances.\n\nThere's also anecdotal evidence that a good workout raises production of beta-endorphins, which increase mood by activating pleasure centers in the limbic areas of the brain. In one recent double-blind study of 98 depressed patients, a majority of those who had been administered a drug that stimulated beta-endorphins showed a measurable improvement in mood after only three weeks.\n\nStudies have shown that regular running can lower blood pressure, protect against coronary heart disease and stroke, improve the function of the body's immune system and reduce the incidence of certain cancers. These and other benefits are likely a result of the increased production of beta-endogenous substance by the body. If you\u2018ve ever had a pleasant workout and felt \u201ccharged up,\u201d \u201cfeel good\u201d or \u201ca sense of well-being\u201d afterward, that may be a sign of beta-endorphin production.\n\nA good workout can also give you a heightened sense of alertness. Just the opposite might be true if you\u2018ve had a workout during which you experienced stiffness, discomfort or injury. These symptoms could indicate increased production of catecholamines, which are responsible for the stress, pain and anxiety responses. That said, \u201c", "answer": "A: satisfaction"}

If you know the outdoor humidity is currently 72%, and you know the dew-point will be - 12\u00b0 Celcius if it rains, what is the likelihood of rain?\nOutput: The dew point is a measure of the current humidity. Since the humidity is 72%, the dew-point must be equal to 72\u00b0 Celcius or greater.\nFor this range of dew-points (72\u00b0 or greater), the following table shows the relative probabilities of precipitation:\n72\u00b0 and greater \nThere is no rain.\n71\u00b0-66\u00b0  \nP(Rain) = 0.25 \n65\u00b0-54\u00b0 \nP(Rain)=0.50 \n53\u00b0 -48\u00b0 \nP(rain)=0.75 \n47\u00b0-15\u00b0 \nP(raing)=1 \n\nTherefore, the probability of rain is 0 for each temperature above 66\u00b0, 0.25 for every one below 66\u00b0 and equals one for every temperature below 48\u00b0.\nSince the humidity is currently at 72\u00b0, there is a 0% probability of rain, a 0.25% probability of rain, and a 99.75% probability of rain.", "answer": "B: cash in"}

Suppose the batter-pitcher pair is chosen at random, each pair having a constant overall hit probability of 35\\%. Explain whether being hit by the pitch is a risk worth taking.\nOutput: The baseball player needs to be hit by the pitch exactly 35/100=<<35/10=3>>3 times for the average game to result in him being hit exactly 3 times.\nConsider the time it takes to play a single game to be T1, and the games a player will play all season to be T2.  Thus, to be hit exactly 3 times in exactly 1 season there must be exactly 3 games in which he is hit.\nIn other words, he must play exactly 3*T1/T2=<<3*T1/102/>>3*1/35 games in which he is at least hit once.\nNote that 35/5=<<35/5=7>>7 games during which he is not hit are 25/5=<<25/5=5>>5 games where he will fail (24/5=<<24/5=5>>4 games in which he *is* hit).\nSuppose he gets hit T times.\nThus, he has 35 games in which his hitting probability is not 35/125=<<35\n/125=5/8>>5/8 of his attempts.\nThis means he has 125-125/25=<<125-1/4>>1/4 of each game's playing time with a 3/4 chance to succeed while he fails half the time.\nThis would be a risk most batters would not want to take.", "answer": "E: let blood"}

{"text": "This one's a tough tough one. But it is very similar to the car-rental agement problem and the final answer should be \"C\" a garage. We must first remember that in the Car-Rental problem choice (1) was incorrect: A) We can't take our car on a river, it will sink. We can't take it on a river because it will get wet, and it is not built for water. \n\nSimilarly, it will be a waste to take a car to the Parking lot. Parking garage can be defined as a parking space in a building, for example a skyscraper, or beneath a multistory building or complex, for use by tenants, the general public, visitors etc. Since it is a garage, cars should be parked in there. So \"E\" cannot be an option, although it sounds similar.\n\nSecondly, Choice (B) a \"city\" may in fact be a good place to go for a drive, but only if we are planning on getting lost. The answer in this case is C, the garage.", "answer": "C: repair shop"}

A book costs $3.25, so you know that the book costs 5 times that of a pen, which makes the book $1.60. So the price of the first book is $1.60+$3.25=$5.25. Multiply $5.25 by the number of pens in the total which is 5, and you get $26.25. Then subtract that from the total cost which is $30/$33.75=$0.265...446644664/25=0.185...551 for the missing cent and you get $0.005...446544654/25, which is $.02 for each pen.

What animal went the longest distance that day?  Choices:  A, dog  B, cat C, horse  D, donkey  E, llama\nOutput: The cat went in and out because he lived at the house.  That means he went a total of 200 feet that day. The dog went 200 feet too.  Llamas are a bit on the big side, so they wouldn't make good pizza deliverers.  How many feet did the horse go?

A donkey is smaller so he goes about about 1/3 the speed of the horse so 1/3 of 120 equals 40 miles.  Finally, a dog walks pretty quickly, about 1/2 as fast as the horse, so 1/2 of 40 is 20 miles.

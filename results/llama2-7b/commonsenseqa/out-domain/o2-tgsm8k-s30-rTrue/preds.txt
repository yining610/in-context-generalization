Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input:If I had a jar which was likely to spoil if left out, where would I want to put it? Choices:  A: kitchen cupboard B: pantry C: grocery store D: pantry E: refrigerator<n>Output:		It must be in a location, which stores it properly.

No one uses the cupboard on the stove anymore.  It has become the junk drawer. (unless they're one of those old-man kitchens with cabinets all the way down to the floor. Then I don't know what they used for, maybe they kept a chicken or two in there???)<n><n>C is wrong. I cannot throw my food away every week to spend time shopping in a grocery store every week.  I would be eating out every night!<n><n>D is wrong. Who stocks their pantry with food that needs refrigeration?<n><n>I am left with only 2 possibilities: E and P<n><n>So the answer is E and P<n><n>Input: This math exam is worth 50 points. The questions are multiple choice, and each question is worth 5 points.<n><n>Output:<n>50 points/5=<<50 points/5==10>>10<n>So the final answer 10<n><n>Input : A pizza costs $5.48 where it is sold. A tip is 15% of the order amount. How much is 4.1% on a $104.09 pizza?<n>Output: The order amount is 104.04, so I need x4.1% *104.05=<<x4.1% * 104. 0==104.03>>104.02=380.18 pennies (dollar is approx. 100 cents)<n>So the final answer in pennies is 380.17<n><n>Input: A car-rental ag

Choices:  A: bowl of soup B: serving dish C: table setting D: placemat E: glass of iced tea<n>Output:		The spoon is never on the placemat.  So the only remaining choices are B, C and D.<n>The spoon is never in the bowl of soup because it's too tall and is always put upright to drink.  The spoon is never in a glass of Iced Tea because the  table setting is served on the side of the glass.  The spoon only appears to be on the glass of iced tea because the plate and glass are facing downward.  The spoon never appears on the table setting because it's on a plate and must never touch a flat surface.  Therefore the spoon must be on the placemat or the serving dish, with the placemat being the only place with flat surface.<n>The spoon goes on the plate when it is done serving.  When it is done serving it is put on the placemat but it must never touch a table and so is moved to the serving dish.<n>Since only one object can be on top of another without touching, the placemat wins because the plate will never be completely on top of the placemat.<n><n>Input:A pond is circular with a radius of 7 miles. A bridge is to be constructed so that it reaches all the way around the pond. How much more bridge is required to make the circle an ellipse?<n>Output: If an ellipse were constructed then the  x-coordinate for all points on the ellipse would be different.  A point along the original radius for an ellipse would be x = r cos theta /  r with sin theta.   The sin theta for one point along the original radius is equal to 0 and the others are >0 and < 1.  The ellipse is constructed such that it is centered on the original radius so that r = 7* (r cos (theta)) /  (r sin  theta).  The area outside the ellipse would have to be subtracted from the original circle.   This is 4*pi*r*r = 288.  That is 288/ 7*(7* (r cos theta))/ (r sin theta).  Note that only one factor varies, not both r and r sin theta.  The result should be much more than 1.2.<n><n>Input:Which of the following types of transport

So if we "spell out" the letters in the word mop, it is M=6 O=15 P=16 and so on.  If we had wanted to spell out the whole words we could have started with M=600 and O=1000. The word moist has 17 letters (m and o have been removed).<n>We can figure the number of letters in the word by doing M = 600 * (17-6) / 15 and getting 1307.<n>The total number of letters in the  whole sentence is 6 letters.  Because the first word in the sentence had four letters and the rest of the  words are of one syllable each, the first word is the only word consisting of four letters.  Therefore, the number of syllables per word  is always (500 - the number of letters in one of the five one-syllable words).  So  if we divide 570 (the 500 - the 3 one-syllable letters of the word moist) by 15,  we come up with 38 which is the number of letters  the first word contains.<n><n>Solution:The number of syllables in this type of sentence is the number of letters minus the number if letters in the first word. As this is <n>the only word with more than 3 letters, this is true. Divide 600 by 15 to get the number of letters

How many orphans can he fit in his truck, in round numbers?<n>Output: A truck is a semi-truck and it can carry 16 tons.<n>A ton is 2,000 lays. To equal 1 ton, the orphans should each weigh about 125 lbs.<n>He has 3600 orphers and 16 x 3600.<n>So he can fit exactly 600 orphanes in one trip. If he has to drive in three trips it would take less time then driving them all in one trip.<n>

Because the two loads travel each way, there will have to be two loaded-empty round trip crossings.<n>Thus, the time required will be (1.2)(0.6)=<<1.2*(0.6)=7.2>>7.2 minutes.<n>So the final round trip would be in total of 7.2 minutes.

At the time of construction he can use only two kinds of wood: Hickory and Fir. To get to work, he moves from point A on a road to his work site by using a bus which, in turn, travels for 1 hour along a mountain highway from point A to the outskirts of town. After finishing his construction work, he rides the bus back to point A. Unfortunately, the bus leaves only once a day.  Determine the minimum number of construction days it will take him to complete the house.<n>Output: Given the man's work site is at location H, he must travel at 150 mph from location A to the house construction site. From the bus station, he travels at 40 mph on the bus to construction site H. Thus, construction will take 150-40=<<150-4=110>>110 days.<n>The man travels at 150mph from H back to A.<n>Thus, the man goes back and forth between his construction site and A in 110 days.

Choices:  A: candy store B: butcher shop C: kitchen D: auto repair shop E: post office<n>Output:		A post office would be the only place where one could buy treats for kiddos over a counter. <n><n>Input: You are a bounty hunter who is hired to locate and arrest the criminal known as Joe Blow.  His crime is possession of unregistered assault weaponry.  Blow has been found hiding out at 1365 Mt. Auburn Dr.<n><n>Blow’s brother, Jim, calls the police to turn Blow in, and gives the police the precise location of their brother’s hide-out.  The bounty hunter arrives and is able to track their quarry to where he is hiding.  There are two ways for one to reach Blow’s hide-out, but they are both inefficient.  The first way would be to take his car (1 hour), drive it to the rail station (2 hours in transit), and then take a train to  the railway station nearest his brother’s house (2 hours).  The other way, would be to take the car, drive to the nearest railway station (4 hours), and then take the train to his brother’s house.  Aside from the distance that is covered, both paths are of the same length (10 hours). If the bounty hunter wants to return to headquarters immediately after the mission, which choice would he prefer, if any? Explain.<n><n>Output: The two paths are both 10 hours in length.  Since one is going to have to get into the car, there is the additional cost of leaving the car for an hour at either location.  So either way, the combined time plus an additional hour for getting from vehicle to rail station would be 11 hours.<n>The bounty hunter would prefer not to take the train if he had any choice at all.<n>So the only path he would prefer is the one where he drives the car to its destination.<n><n>Input: Which is the most dangerous airborne substance to breathe?  <n>A: Sulfur dioxide    B: Sulfuric acid    C: Sulfur    D: Sulfur<n><n>Output: Air has different properties due to altitude. <n>Evidence of aerosols and gasses in the atmosphere has been found to reach much further than just ground level.

Which can she fill first to make this possible? A: blocks first B: blocks second C: balls first D: balls second E: no can be done<n>Output: A can't fill blocks first...there are none available. She'll be stuck.  Start with all the balls, since it's a no-brainer that you can put as many balls as you like.  Choosing the first ball, and placing it in the box, she has no blocks (since it is not a ball-to-block pair), and she has no more balls (since she's already placed as many as she can).   She can choose a block - any block, since any choice will give her no more balls to place, and a block-to-ball pair (since it has to go by balls, and the first ball is placed).  If it's not the last ball to come into the box, the second ball, she can place it into a blank spot on right side of the box, using another block-to-ball-pair as the base.  Repeat with any block.   Finally, she will have to place the last ball as just any ball to a free spot, to finish the box.  Since either of the sides is possible, choose whichever you like (it will make no difference)<n><n>Input: How many months is 1924 divided by 12?<n>Output: 1924/12 = <<1924/24=80>>80<n>Since rounding each time, you divide by 12, and then round:<n>divide by 12 = <<12/12>> 1<n>Round = <<round=0>> 0<n>divide by 24 =<<24/24>>8<n>Round = <<6>>1<n>divide by 36 =<<36/36>>2<n>Round = <<3>>-<n>1<n><n>Input: Given 8 men and 5 girls.

The van can travel 400 miles a day on a good paved road. However, when it travels on an unimproved road (such as a forest road that is very rutted or rocky), the van can travel 2 miles per hour.  The family is planning on driving 400 miles from their home to a vacation site that they have not yet reached.<n>What is the minimum number of days necessary for the trip?<n><n>Output: The family is going from start to end, so only one way is needed, which is 400/3=<<400/(2)^3==>400/2=200>> 200 miles (rounded to the nearest mile). We also know the travel conditions (paved and unimproved/ rough) and the total distance of 400 miles.<n><n>1.

If we choose 4 tires which have the same chance to be repaired, 1 out of 4 have the chance to get repaired. We will choose the ones which have the highest rate to repaire and put 3 tires to repaire. And they have 90% rate to get repaired, which is the highest rate. Thus, our expectation will be repaired since we repaired 3 times more than the rate, which is 3/1. Since 4/3 doesn't matter to choose them to repair or not, we will choose 4/3 and have 9/13 in total, the expected rate of getting repaired will be 9/13.<n>This 9/13 will be the probability that the repair station is repaired, we will use it for the probability to choose 1 tire to be repaired and the other 3 to have the highest chance.<n><n>We will chose 4 out of 16=<<4 out of 15=11>>11, which will have the 9/13 chance of getting repaired. Which will give the 9/11 in total rate to get repaied.<n><n>So we will get 4 out of 9 getting repaired. <n><n>

Choices:  A: mouth B: can C: human D: snake E: kentucky fried chicken<n>Output:		The correct answer is “A”: mouth. The given set of choices excludes “human” and “snake.” We see that “human” is correctly excluded since if the answer to the question were “human,” then the question would specify a living thing, a human does not eat (not with their mouth), and so it wouldn’t make sense to ask for a “living thing with a mouth.” Further, since we see that “human” can’t be the answer, we see that “snake” can’t be either.<n><n>Input: 1-6: The average person sleeps from one-half to one-third of his or her entire life. So, the question asks how much sleep a person gets each night on average? Choices: A) 30 minutes B) 7 hours C) 5 hours D) 80 minutes E) 5 hours F) 18 hours G) 10 hours<n>Output: The correct response given the provided choices is “F”: 180 minutes. First we note that none of the choices are “more than” the given set; thus 180 is not the smallest possible number in the set we are provided.  Next we note that all other choices are “less than” 180; thus, 180 is the largest possible number in the set. In this case, choosing 180 solves all of the provided conditions (180 ≥ 30, 180 ≥  7, 180 < 5, 180 > 80, 18 > 10).<n><n>Input: 65 divided by 10<n>Output: The value 65 is an integer and is not an even number. If we divide 65 by 10, the answer will be 6.5. 65 is evenly divisible by 2, but 65 is not evenly divisible by ten.  6.5 is not an integer. Therefore there isn’t an integer-based division, thus the answer for 65 divided by ten is 0.65.<n><n>Input: In 2005, Google stock (GOOG) traded at $85, rising more than $15 per share with each passing week during that year.

What is the probability that if you randomly pick one ball from the box that it is red?<n>Output: The probability of picking the red ball to a power of x is x^(probability that the event happened to red). The probability of red ball is the probability that I pick the red ball plus the probability that I pick one of the other balls and choose red again as the color. The probability that the event happened is 1; the power is x. So, x^(probability that event happened), and probability that event happened is 1.<n>And x=1, so 1^(x)=1 to the power of x.  X is the power and the probability that event happened to red is 1/3; so x=1 and x^x= x, (1*1)=1.<n>And the probability is 3/5.<n><n>Input: I am looking for a new car, I am open to all makes and models.

If the current situation is similar, we expect to continue to get 'y'."<n>The most extreme form of scientific induction is the law of large numbers which makes the assumption that if we toss a million heads or tails, in the long run we would expect to find no difference in the results.<n>A key in evaluating scientific induction is the following:  If we can determine how similar, or different, the current situation is from the established relationship (historical) we can determine if induction can provide us with strong evidence. If we cannot recognize a significant difference, it is not wise to draw this conclusion.<n>A manager's reasoning would seem to rest on the foundation of scientific induction.<n><n>Input: How much

The walls of the container are made of tissue paper, which is 0.0003 inch thick at its thickest point. One of the balloons is inflated with air, and the other is inflated by 0.14 times atmospheric pressure in absolute terms. If the air pressure has been measured by the scientists to be 103 kPa, the difference in pressure between the balloon without the pressure applied internally and the air pressure outside the container is approximately 2368 Pa (at constant temperature). Estimate the volume of one of the balls.<n>Output: The volume of an object in a rectangular container is the product of the depth of the container and the width and the height of the object. The height of the balloon is equal to the depth of the container, because there is an air pressure equal to the atmospheric pressure on the outside walls of the container. The volume of the balloon, then, is equal to the container's width and height times the atmospheric pressure. 2368=<<2368=2368>>2368Pa.<n>So the balloon is 0.0615 in^3, and the volume of the other volume is equal to 0.06-1/2.  It will be 0.0625 in^3.<n><n>![Image](04_MultipleChoiceQuestions/Images/pic_12.png)<n><n>Input: A 5 kg object has an inward force acting on it of 25 N.

I regularly attended quarterly conference calls and company functions.<n>While I did read about the company's legal obligations and knew what the company's legal counsel advised was in the best interests of the company, I wasn't sure what all the legal protections did for me.<n>So one day during an executive breakfast buffet session, I went to my legal department supervisor and asked her to explain some of the things I was required to sign and why.<n>She said, "Your contract is for the protection of the company, not you.<n>Think of your contract as protecting the company from you."<n>"It is to protect the company from you as well as other people from you. <n>That is why we want you to sign it."<n>I said, "How does my contract protect the company?"<n>It turned out my legal protections as an employee were quite extensive. But as a contract negotiator and former insurance salesman, I felt that contracting required two parties to find mutual benefit from an agreement.<n><n>So I asked my supervisor why didn't all employees who signed contracts share the benefits of their legal protections?<n>She said, "Because we protect you.  We cannot protect everyone."<n>I guess this is another reason why we read the fine print in agreements and contracts before we sign them.<n>

How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input:The person turned the oven on and put a pizza in, what happened one hour later?

You take a percentage of it and double it, to make a quarter.  Divide your money by the quarter, and see whether the remainder (the extra money, the "leftovers") is a number that's divisable by 1/4. Now the other way around: You have a certain amount of leftover money that's divisable 4 times. To make a quarter, triple the amount that comes with the remainder (the "leftovers"). Multiply this number by 402%. Now divide this new amount by the number of days you're working per week, and you've made out your first week's pay.<n><n><n>```gist<n>	import random<n>	from math import sqrt, floor<n>	from string import split, join<n>```<n><n>### Instruction: Write four small functions - each one that has the appropriate return type - in the space below.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The car-rental agency charges $30/day for a car, or $190 for the first week for a rental that lasts an entire week or longer. Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input:If done correctly grooming pet's nails generally does not cause this? Choices:  A: training B: satisfaction C: injury D: beauty E: late<n>Output:		The correct answer to this multiple choice question is D, "Beauty". <n>Grooming pets is considered to be a chore or a duty (B).  Patience during training, and relief from boredom (C) are possible. Grooming is not an unpleasant activity and it does not cause injury (A).  It can make your pet look very nice (D).<n><n>Input: A babysitter charges $15/hour plus $2.50 for each year of age of the child she's caring for.  She's paid $80 by a family she's helping that evening, but they've got 4 kids with a total age of 33...how much more, in terms of dollars, did she charge the family? Explain your answer.<n>Output: Since the babysitter charges for each year of the child's age, 33*2.5=<<33*2.0=83>>83 dollars are added to the price of the child.<n>She is paid $80 for 3 children.<n>Adding 83 to 80, we get $80+$83=<<80+$83>=163>>163.<n>163 is less than 80.<n>So the family paid the babysitter $80.<n><n>Input: In order to complete a crossword puzzle, it takes you 80 minutes and 14 cigarettes.

Choices:  A: vomiting B: pleasure C: happiness D: contentment E: mess<n>Output:		The correct answer is A. Eating breakfast in bed can lead to feeling like throwing up when you drop food everywhere in the sheets.<n>The only correct answer is not D because it is not pleasurable to eat breakfast at all.<n>Breakfast in bed, or sitting up in bed, will only lead you to vomit.<n>You can not feel contentment or happiness if you were eating in bed, and you will certainly not be feeling any contentment or happiness or eating whatever you have broken (unless it is a donut or some other edible mess-making food item).<n>A donut can cause you to vomit which will lead you to feel like vomiting. So the only correct answer is A.<n><n>Input:Which of these is the LEAST likely day to occur in the year 2700 AD?<n>Output:The odds of a leap year falling on 09/17/2063 are one in two-trillion (the same odds as a single year having 59 Fridays)<n>The chances of any single day coming around only once within a two-thousand year time period (let us say until the year 7999 AD) are quite slim.<n>However, if you are concerned about the least likely year to contain a certain date during this two thousand year period, 2063 AD is the least likely in the year 2000 AD.<n>This is because, the odds of a leaping day on 07/20/2063 is one in four. This is because if you remove the leaping day, you will leave 12 months, rather than 13, and 06 is divisible by 4, rather than divisible by 7.<n>And if you are concerned about having that day fall on a specific month, March has a one in six chance of landing with a leaping day, and October has a one in seven and September has a one in eight chance of a leaping day. So September is the least likely of these months to contain a leaping day.<n>

Thus, 6.25 feet + 0.25=<<6.25 feet+0.25=6.5 feet>>6.5 feet<n>A better answer would be the integer 6 since you round the remainder of 0.25 to 0. <n><n>Input:A hobbyist wanted to build a customized clock that could be programmed with a set of instructions and would run indefinitely.  All that is needed for the clock to function is the electricity to power this circuit diagram.  She made the mistake of providing the electricity without the instructions needed for the clock to work... The clock did not run very long. What was the cause? Choices:  Choice 1: The clock started but stopped too quickly for the circuit to detect a signal.  Choice 2: The electricity was too short for the clock to run.  Choice 3: Incorrect power source was used.  Choice 4: The circuit failed to detect any signal from the clock and so stopped operating.<n>Output: Choice 1: Incorrect power source. I will explain how this works:<n>The correct answer to solving this question is Choice 4.  However, the correct answer should not be what the clock is actually detecting but the reason for the clocks failure.<n>The clock is detecting the fact that the power came on suddenly because as we know the circuit requires a signal/clock to run. Thus, it can only run while receiving power from a power source.<n>However, since the electricity that was given had a short amount of power, when it stopped it stopped abruptly meaning the battery died and could no

Choices:  A: satisfaction B: flying C: sweating D: falling down E: trip<n>Output:		After going for a run you have what I call a ‘runner’s high’.<n><n><div>'Runner‘s high' is the euphoric sensation associated with running that researchers at the University of Michigan have linked to the release of natural opioids and other endorphins by the body.<n><n>The opioids have an analgesic (pain-killing) effect, and researchers think the release of endorphins leads to a feeling of pleasure in the exercise. Endorphins are neurotransmitters (chemicals that transmit messages from one nerve cell to another or to the brain). They are released in response to stress, injury and exercise (including high-intensity exercise) and may help block pain.<n><n>In an article published in the September/October 1994 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), the University of Michigan study found that after marathon runners had exercised, their blood contained four to six times normal concentrations of these substances.<n><n>There's also anecdotal evidence that a good workout raises production of beta-endorphins, which increase mood by activating pleasure centers in the limbic areas of the brain. In one recent double-blind study of 98 depressed patients, a majority of those who had been administered a drug that stimulated beta-endorphins showed a measurable improvement in mood after only three weeks.<n><n>Studies have shown that regular running can lower blood pressure, protect against coronary heart disease and stroke, improve the function of the body's immune system and reduce the incidence of certain cancers. These and other benefits are likely a result of the increased production of beta-endogenous substance by the body. If you‘ve ever had a pleasant workout and felt “charged up,” “feel good” or “a sense of well-being” afterward, that may be a sign of beta-endorphin production.<n><n>A good workout can also give you a heightened sense of alertness. Just the opposite might be true if you‘ve had a workout during which you experienced stiffness, discomfort or injury. These symptoms could indicate increased production of catecholamines, which are responsible for the stress, pain and anxiety responses. That said, “

If you know the outdoor humidity is currently 72%, and you know the dew-point will be - 12° Celcius if it rains, what is the likelihood of rain?<n>Output: The dew point is a measure of the current humidity. Since the humidity is 72%, the dew-point must be equal to 72° Celcius or greater.<n>For this range of dew-points (72° or greater), the following table shows the relative probabilities of precipitation:<n>72° and greater <n>There is no rain.<n>71°-66°  <n>P(Rain) = 0.25 <n>65°-54° <n>P(Rain)=0.50 <n>53° -48° <n>P(rain)=0.75 <n>47°-15° <n>P(raing)=1 <n><n>Therefore, the probability of rain is 0 for each temperature above 66°, 0.25 for every one below 66° and equals one for every temperature below 48°.<n>Since the humidity is currently at 72°, there is a 0% probability of rain, a 0.25% probability of rain, and a 99.75% probability of rain. <n><n><n><n>

Suppose the batter-pitcher pair is chosen at random, each pair having a constant overall hit probability of 35\%. Explain whether being hit by the pitch is a risk worth taking.<n>Output: The baseball player needs to be hit by the pitch exactly 35/100=<<35/10=3>>3 times for the average game to result in him being hit exactly 3 times.<n>Consider the time it takes to play a single game to be T1, and the games a player will play all season to be T2.  Thus, to be hit exactly 3 times in exactly 1 season there must be exactly 3 games in which he is hit.<n>In other words, he must play exactly 3*T1/T2=<<3*T1/102/>>3*1/35 games in which he is at least hit once.<n>Note that 35/5=<<35/5=7>>7 games during which he is not hit are 25/5=<<25/5=5>>5 games where he will fail (24/5=<<24/5=5>>4 games in which he *is* hit).<n>Suppose he gets hit T times.<n>Thus, he has 35 games in which his hitting probability is not 35/125=<<35<n>/125=5/8>>5/8 of his attempts.<n>This means he has 125-125/25=<<125-1/4>>1/4 of each game's playing time with a 3/4 chance to succeed while he fails half the time.<n>This would be a risk most batters would not want to take.<n><n><n><n><n>

Their eyes are located on the sides of their heads, and they can see almost three-sixty degrees behind them. With their incredible hearing ability, they can hear the flap of a bat's wing from up to a mile away. To ensure their young can develop properly, horses rely on the 'herd effect.' This is the physical presence of other horses as well as the leadership and protection of the stallion. Because of their tendency to form herd behavior, horses are also used as a way to describe the tendency for groups to react in a similar manner. For example, if the stock market plummets, it is usually safe to assume that many other economies will be impacted. It is because of this tendency for many animals, including humans, to seek safety and protection as a group that horses are frequently used to represent a large population of individuals.<n><n>How are horses used today to represent the actions taken by many people throughout history?<n>Choices: The answer A: Herd effect B: Leadership C: The stallion D: Three-sixty degrees E: Stock market"<n>Output: Herd effect<n><n>instruction: Write a Python program that checks if a string is palindrome.

Where would he look? Choices:  A: fish market B: hawaiian waters C: gulf of mexico D: tropical sea E: south pacific ocean<n>Output:		I assume that his goal was to acquire live blowfish.<n>If he was looking to buy blowfish as a food,<n>his best bet would be a gulf coast fish market, where blowfish are known to be plentiful.<<Blowfish are not actually blowfish but toadfish. They are commonly mistaken for blowfish because they resemble them.>><n><<15 most common blowfish, known as puffers; they may not live in a temperate water environment.>><n>Blowfish are a suborder of the order Perciformes, which means that the members inhabit tropical or subtropical waters.<n>The temperate waters of the Gulf of Mexico do not qualify. The Pacific ocean also doesn't qualify in that respect, for the same reason (not being temperate).<n>If he were to just eat the damn fish instead of wanting to keep them alive to eat in the future,<n>I suppose that a live blowfish could be bought from a Gulf of Mexico market. I doubt that you could get it any cheaper there, but I suppose there are other reasons that a gulf fish market could be the solution.<n>The next most reasonably priced option would be to fly into Hawaii; I imagine there are lots of fishermen there who have caught blowfish in Hawaii as well.<<That is not my interpretation of the question, because I assume that 'near America' means 'nearer to America than Hawaii,' and I further assume that Hawaii is farther from America than the South Pacific ocean, and I also assume that the blowfish is living in the water near Hawaii, which means that Johnny should look at Hawaii first.>> The tropical sea is also an option.<<Again, assuming that the blowfish are living in the water,>><n>I would guess that living in a tropical water environment makes it harder to find or acquire; and therefore blowfish living in a tropical sea is not readily available, so you couldn't buy it from one.<n>Also, if he were a fisherman, fishing in a tropical sea wouldn't actually be a bad idea; I see no clear reason to think that being temperate or tropical impacts the location of the fish.<<Well, I can see at least three bad reasons: the ones I mentioned previously, but there are probably even more. It is a really obscure question anyway, so perhaps they meant you to

His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input:If I take my heifer out East, where's a place we might end up?

When all the goats were in the pen, their combined height was 85in. The first goat weighed 45 lbs., and the second weighed 30 pounds. For instance, if they were all standing on a level ground, when they were in a group how much taller was the bigger goat than the smaller goat?<n>Output: Using the above information, you will need to answer a question about this goat pair.<n>Ask the student in class to choose (or write) an answer for a situation involving the goats.<n>Give the student an answer key showing the correct answer and the reasoning.<n>For example, the first question to the student could be: "If the 1st and 2nd goats have the same height, what is the combined weight of the goats (who weigh exactly the same) in pounds?"<n>The correct answer is provided and the reasoning is, "It is not possible to have exactly the same height and exactly the same weight, so the two goats can't have the same weight. In addition, if the goats had the same height (85in), they must have had the same weight. Therefore, the goats must have exactly the same height." Then repeat the process for the other examples from the lesson.<n><n>Input:If the cows jump from the truck bed directly onto the ground without first entering the cattle tank and stand motionless for the 2 hours, what is the density, in ounces, of the liquid in the truck that would come into contact with the cows' skin?<n>Output: Assuming you know the cows are dairy cattle, you may also consider the following information.<n>The milk production capacity of dairy cows can vary significantly, based on age, breed, and other factors. <n>According to information from the website USDA, the total U.S. production of dairy cow milk and milk equivalent for 2005 was 166 billion pounds, so the density, in ounce, at which a volume of 1 million pounds comes into contact with the hides of a million cows

There is a limit of 20 on how many soft drinks they can buy at one time. The price of a 2-liter glass is $0.25 less than they can charge in the store, so they can charge any price from $0.25 to $3.25, depending on how many 2-liter soft-drinks they decide to sell at any moment.  For example, if they just want to be able to sell one glass per customer, then the smallest price they should charge (since $3 per liter is too expensive) should be $2.75. If they want to sell 50 glasses, then they should charge as little as $3.25 (since they have 50 glasses and, if only one customer buys a glass, the glass is $1.75). Find the lowest amount that they should charge customers.<n>Output:Answer: The lowest amount that you will charge customers is $$0.25+0.25\times 20=$$0.25+[0.25\]\*10=$$0.75$$0.75<n>Input:The store sells 2-liter soft drnink bottles for a nickel. When they open in the morning, and they have 1000 bottles they can sell a certain number of bottles depending on how many have not been drank. For example, if they only want to sell about 200, then they should wait to sell any bottles they may not want to sell. Then, if 200 bottles have not been sold, they may sell the remaining 800. So for this question, we will call the number of bottles sold "bottles_sold" and the amount of bottles remaining available "remaining_amount". If the amount of bottles sold is above $200$200, we should

But it is very similar to the car-rental agement problem and the final answer should be "C" a garage. We must first remember that in the Car-Rental problem choice (1) was incorrect: A) We can't take our car on a river, it will sink. We can't take it on a river because it will get wet, and it is not built for water. <n><n>Similarly, it will be a waste to take a car to the Parking lot. Parking garage can be defined as a parking space in a building, for example a skyscraper, or beneath a multistory building or complex, for use by tenants, the general public, visitors etc. Since it is a garage, cars should be parked in there. So "E" cannot be an option, although it sounds similar.<n><n>Secondly, Choice (B) a "city" may in fact be a good place to go for a drive, but only if we are planning on getting lost. The answer in this case is C, the garage.<n><n>

The numbers of lions and animals are approximately inversely proportional, meaning when the numbers of both increase the numbers of animals kill decreases; when the numbers of both decrease the number of animals killed increases. A) If about 100,000 animals are killed by lion’s each year and the total number of lions is about 1000. How many lions can be directly responsible for killing the 100, 000 animals each year? B) If about 2 million animals are killed by lino’s each year and there are about 20 lions, how many animals can be directly responsible for causing these deaths?<n>Output: The number of animals killed 100, lions each year, is 100,<<100,0,0,1>>0/<<100>>1=<<.%69=0>>0.  The total numbers of animals killed in Africa by lions is then 2,000,<<49,0,0,2>>0/<<2,000>>2=<<.%61=0>>0.<n>The rate of animal death per lion is 1/<<100.%69=1/50,000>>1/50,<<1020=1>>0/<<.%61/61%>_10,000=1/25,000>>0/<<1/25,<<11050,0025,001>>0, so for each lion to kill 2,00 animals, it would take a population of about 0 lions to be able to indirectly kill these 2,00,0,2,<<10,10,00,090

His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input:Which entrance would you use if you do not want to use the back entrance?

It's one of the things I'm not sure about in math, since it's the only part of it I've never been truly comfortable with.<n>The problem I have with that is that time can't be a discrete, discrete, because it's continuously related to things that are, in fact, continually growing.  That's sort of like saying, everything is, simultaneously, a continuous, continuous or a discrete, discrete.<n>The "discrete" time we use, (and which computers use), is, actually, more a matter of convenience than anything else.<n><n>I'm sure there is a lot of math I don't know of, and math can't be limited or defined by its physical universe, so I guess the concept of "time as a direction" isn't too surprising.<n>I'm happy to say, we all use it.<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the three questions following.<n><n>Question:What are the different types of symmetry for a triangles? <n>       <n>Answer:<n><n>The number of lines of symmetry of a

For example {2, 5, 7, 8, 12} only contains a 6 but not a 7.<n>Output: This seems to be true.  I guess it is only if you use the set {2, 4, 3, 5, 1}, where 2 and 5 are not distinct.  This is true for {2, 4}, {2, 3}, {4, 3}, {2, 5}, {2, 4} and {4, 5} (all repeated numbers)  and {2, 3} (which is only two numbers)<n><n>Input: The sum (total price) of the three items purchased equals 0.41.<n>Output: the sum (total price) is $15.00 = $12.00+$

Choices:  A: air B: water C: earth D: space shuttle E: tunnel<n>Output:		We start with 2100 liters of Oxygen in the station.  On day 1, some of the oxygen is turned into water.<n>(Note: A cubic meter is 1000 liters. Thus, 2100 cubic meters is just 21001000 litres)<n>Because 2100/10 = 2100 in the following calculation, the value of the subtraction is 2099, not 2100, and that causes the oxygen meter to display 2099<n><n>On Day 2, the same thing happens.<n>Because 2099/10 = 1999, the value of the oxygen meter is 1999 minus (their original value).  (Oxygen has declined from 2100 to 1999 in two days. The water they created turned the oxygen into hydro-sylvirs (which I'm making up, and which is the scientific term for water). So they are very low on O2...they need to get more oxygen, or get rid of the other stuff.)<n><n>Because 1999/10 is 199, the oxygen meter indicates 199.  That's still short.<n>Because 10/10 =1, there is only one more day that they have the oxygen.  On day 3, the rest of the oxygen is converted into water, and their oxygen meter is set to zero.<n><n><n>

A book costs $3.25, so you know that the book costs 5 times that of a pen, which makes the book $1.60. So the price of the first book is $1.60+$3.25=$5.25. Multiply $5.25 by the number of pens in the total which is 5, and you get $26.25. Then subtract that from the total cost which is $30/$33.75=$0.265...446644664/25=0.185...551 for the missing cent and you get $0.005...446544654/25, which is $.02 for each pen. So 5 times $.02 is $.10 and you need to add $.10 to $.15 to get your answer. So the price of a pen is $.15.<n><n>Input:A group of friends are discussing how they all want to travel together

What animal went the longest distance that day?  Choices:  A, dog  B, cat C, horse  D, donkey  E, llama<n>Output: The cat went in and out because he lived at the house.  That means he went a total of 200 feet that day. The dog went 200 feet too.  Llamas are a bit on the big side, so they wouldn't make good pizza deliverers.  How many feet did the horse go?  A horse goes 5 miles in an hour so 5 miles times 24 hours is 120 miles.  Since a horse has 4 legs, each leg went about 30 miles.  A donkey is smaller so he goes about about 1/3 the speed of the horse so 1/3 of 120 equals 40 miles.  Finally, a dog walks pretty quickly, about 1/2 as fast as the horse, so 1/2 of 40 is 20 miles.  The cat went 200/0.6 = <<200/06=333>>333.3 miles  The dog went 238.3 miles.  The donkey went 39.9 miles.   The llama didn't go anywhere, he didn't feel comfortable enough, nor was he fast enough.<n><n>Input: A local park has a snack bar, the snack bar has two registers, one for cash and one for checking cards.

It is either they listen to a radio or they don't. I don't think so, people say it all the time. For this program, you just have to follow suit on whatever the person you just spoke with says. If the person you have just finished speak with wants to listen to a radio and ask for a letter to be written, the radio will be written at the same time. If the person you just spoke to want to have a radio, then say radio. B, C, D will be considered negative so it will not be allowed.

He would not have any evidence at his home, because then he would have known all of the results from the evidence. He would not need any evidence from the police station or the coroner's office, because of the same reason. Thus, the only possible location where he could have the evidence is at his hotel room.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question according to the following conditions:<n><n>```c++<n>//question1.cpp<n><n>#include <iostream><n>#include <string><n><n>using namespace std;<n>int main(){<n>    int n;<n>    cin >> n;    //10<n>    char result[20];<n>    for(int i=0; i<n; i++){<n>        string ch;<n>        getline(cin, ch);<n>        result[i] = ch[n];<n>    }<n>    cout << result << endl;    //gift<n><n>    getline(cin, result);<n>    cout << result[n] << endl;    //love <n><n>    getline (cin, result[n]);<n>    cout << result [n] << endl;  //cry<n>}<n>```<n>

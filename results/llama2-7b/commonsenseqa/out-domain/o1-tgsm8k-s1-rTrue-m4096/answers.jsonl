{"idx": 9, "text": "When writing with a fountain pen, ink can get on fingers and clothes. Inkwells are made of wet sand. They provide extra ink when fingers need it, but the wet sand absorbs some of the ink. When the inkwell gets dry the paper can be ruined if the ink is too blotchy. The paper needs to be kept wet by filling the inkwell with fresh wet ink. To avoid having wet ink on calligrapher' hands, a blotter is placed on the desk. One side of the blotter is damped to absorb ink. This provides extra ink when fingers reach for it, but still prevents ink from blotching the paper. The blotter is made of clean, dry cotton.  The cotton blotter absorbs extra ink from the fingers when needed. The wet side of the blotting paper is kept wet at all times by dipping the blotting paper, holding it, and pressing it to the top of the inkwell, where the page meets the tabletop. The page needs to stay wet to avoid blotchy ink.\nIn the morning, the page underneath the inkwell needs to stay wet too. So, the blotter needs to be damped.

Choices:  A* B* C x D +E  A  B  C \nOutput: Whenever you read such a negative sentence, the person who is expressing his/her opinion on the person is trying to say that he/she thinks the person is dumber than the one they are talking about.\nLet's consider the sentence, \"You're so dumb\". The word \"dumb\" is an adjective, and a lot of people think of dumb as a negative adjective. It has nothing to do with whether or not we think about being smart.  In fact, it can be considered that both \"C\" and \"E\" are good for their personalities, such as \"A\" or \"B\".\nLet's also consider another sentence. \"You're so stupid\" has nothing to do with \"stupidity\", and it means that you have good personalities even if you are stupid.\nTherefore, if \"A\" has nothing to do as a personality, \"B\" has nothing to do and is a negative personality, and \"C\" has a neutral personality. So both the \"B\" and \"C\" are used to express personalities, and \"E\" has nothing to do. And \"D\" doesn't mean stupidity, but means that the person can be dumber than A and B are.\n\nInput: A caravan is a group of people, and people have a caravan when they are walking, right?

How to distinguish them? \n\nTo distinguish one another\u2019s accents from a place and from a time, you can add another word to the first syllable (\u201cgirl\u201d).\n\nIn London, the first syllable would be \u201cgirl\u201d for \u201cy\u2019all\u201d whereas the other place could be \u201cgir\u201d.  \n\nThis can be applied to any other word where the first syllable has multiple ways to pronounce it.\n\nFor instance, \u201cboy\u201d (where the first y could be for \u201cyall\u201d and the second y is for \u201cyou all\u201d).\n\nIn old English, the first two letters of \u201cheh\u201d were pronounced \u201cih\u201d. For example, the word \u201chi\u201d was pronounced \u201cih-yay\u201d.\n\nInput:\n1. In old English text, people could indicate a question by adding an exclamation mark at the end of a sentence. How can we interpret it? \n   2. In the sentence \u201cCan we meet at 7pm?\u201d, the punctuation would not make any distinguish from the phrase \u201cCan we meet at seven on?\u201d\n   3. However, the punctuation indicates the tone of the speaker as she is asking whether or not they can/should go. \n\nInput:\n\u201cThis is a good deal\u201d. Where do the extra comma belong?\n\nFor all questions above, the answer is \u201coption B\u201d, \u201coption C\u201d or \u201coption D\u201d\n\n### Instructions: Write code that answers all of the prompts.\n\n### Part A\n\nInput: 1. \u201cThe carrot is orange.\u201d \nHow to modify this sentence while maintaining the grammatical structure of the original sentence?", "answer": "C: street corner"}

{"idx": 228, "text": "The correct answer is D (own home).\n\nAn attic is typically found in older houses because of the increased difficulty of construction.\nIn fact, the term \u2018attic\u2019 can be traced back to the Ancient Greeks, where it means a storage space for items from the home\u2019s upper levels.\nThis was most likely an attic since the Romans, due to technical issues, had ceilings that remained lower on homes.\n\nIn the United States, attics were most notably used in the early years as a living space.\nMigrants who wanted the American dream and moved out to the West from the East coast used attics in their newly constructed homes to provide them with a place to sleep. These attics were typically heated and sometimes furnished. Many of these migrants later became very wealthy and began to build mansions, using an attic as their historical room for historical items.\nThe term \u2018attic\u2019 is not commonly used for this purpose anymore. The reason for this change is most likely because homes were built to be smaller in these early years.\nEven though Victorian homes also had attic rooms, it is not likely that their attics contained any historical items.\nFinally, attics are only found in larger houses since it will be harder to climb stairs that are a bit steeper.\nSo the best answer is D (own homes with attic rooms for historical items)\n\nInput: A 30 story building was hit by a hurricane with winds of about 72 miles per hour, and fell onto a 60 foot tall tree in front of it.

The pumpkins come in two different shapes: large pumpkins and small pumpkins. All pumpkins have numbers written on them, but if the pumpkin is large the number is two digits, and if it\u2019s small the number is a single digit. Large pumpkins that have single digit numbers are always even, and large pumpkins that have two digit numbers are always odd. Small pumpkins always have an even number.\n\nOutput:\n\nChoice: The answer is 39. Choices D and E are incorrect because C and D are both less than 39. E is less than option C. C is less than 39 because 292 < 39 * (1 pumpkin per square pumpkin. 1 square pumpkin = 2 x 2 = 4 pumpkins or 1 row).\n\nAnswer: The total number of large pumpkins is (odd) (86*). This number equals (odd) (98) which equals (159). Now all we have to do is multiply by the number of small pumpkins, which is (1).\n\nOutput:\n```\nD: Pumpkins:\nPumpkins are all large and they are labeled with an even number.\nThe number of large pumpkin are 35:\nNumber of small pumpkin:\nThe answer is 133.\n```\nThe number of large, 35, is odd, so odd (86) must be added to it to find the total number of pumpkins on the field.

She used these stickers to make note taking easier.\n\nExplanation: A large sticker used to indicate that a note was important, and a small sticker indicated not important. When the papers were connected together in a journal, one could quickly flip through the journal to find a note when needed. When there were 8 pages of regular sized pages of a journal, it became too cumbersome to locate important notes. Therefore, using large stickers, one can quickly locate important notes from the front page of the journal.\n\nInput: The farmer can take 1 horse and 1 goat.

For example, it would be incorrect to enter \"1, 2, 3, 4, 5\" for the input, but it would be okay to enter \"11, 12, 13, 14, 15\" \n  \n### Output : The first time we encounter a number in the input, we write the corresponding name of that number in the output (so that when we encounter that number a second time, we'll know what to do with it). Here's an example: the input \"11, 5, 2\" would yield the output \"eleven=20, five=40, two= 20\".\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Input: The first time we encounter 1, which is the number eleven, we should write it's number name (11) in the output.\n2. Input:  After that, we know 1 should equal 20.\n3. Input: Same rules apply for number 2, which is the number five.\n4. Input:  Same rules apply for number three, which is the number zero.\n5. Input: We do the same for any repeating number the same way that we did with number one and number two, until it is encountered for the last time in the input file.", "answer": "B: unbreakable"}

What number are 'y' and 5y?\"\nThere is a relationship between the two questions and can answer them simultaneously. So, they are the same question.\n\n### Solution\nGiven a + 1.00 = 1.84, a \u2013 1 = 1.76, 1.84 + 1.76 = 3.60 and a \u2013 1.76 \u2264 3.60 = 1.74.\nThe difference between the two is 3.60 \u2013 1.74 = <<3.60-1.74=1.86>>1.86.\nWe know that 1.74 \u2013 1.7 = <<1.74-1.7=0.04>>0.04 and therefore, 1.74 > 1.7.\nThe only conclusion is this: in order to get 1.86 for a, we have to add 1.74, which would be b = 0.12.\nSo, if a = 1.62, the answer is 1.62 + 0.12 = <<1.62+0.12=1.74>>1.74.", "answer": "A: blisters"}

Sometimes the question has only one instruction then you have to implement that instruction and then compare your answer with the expected output and sometimes it has more than one instruction then try to find your way and do it using multiple instructions. \n\n### How to read the question?\nIn this subsection, we will discuss how to read the problem statement in a programming quiz.\n\n1) **Read the question only once** : Some questions in the programming quiz don't have any instructions but they are quite tricky. \n\n2) **Understand the structure of the question** : Questions are not limited to having only one sentence instruction. Sometimes there may be more than one instruction depending upon the structure of the problem and difficulty of the question. In such cases, you need to understand the context of different instructions in a question in order to effectively solve them. For example, if there is a question 'What is the total in the car?', it is more likely to have only one instruction and you will have to do one operation on a value. However, if the question is 'What is the most valuable in a set of 7 cars?', it is quite possible to have more than one instructions (e.g. find the value of the car and then compare it with another value).\n\n3) **Understand the instruction(s)** : When there are multiple instructions in the question, read instructions carefully and try to analyse them. \n\n4) **Focus on the question :** Try to understand the question instead of focussing on how you are going to solve the question. While this might make it easier to find the solution, a good practice is to try to solve the question first because it will help you to focus on the problem statement.\n\n5) **Knowledge of instructions** : If", "answer": "C: city"}

Because:\n\nA: the company bought more than it soldB: the company sold a large quantity of inventoryC: there is a receivable that is uncollectedD: there is a loan or borrowingE: there is a bank loan owed\n\nOutput: The answer will be B: the company sold a greater quantity of its inventory than it bought in the period.This is because the total sales exceed the total opening inventory + the total purchases. Therefore, the accountant will need to adjust the ending inventory for the difference to balance the account. This difference should not occur except for abnormal transactions (e.g., sales discounts given, abnormal returns where the sales return and the cost of goods sold have not yet been recorded)", "answer": "B: map"}

Choices: a: 3  b: 6  c: 9  d: 27 e: 105  f: 91 \nOutput: It is known that the square root of 7000 (a square number) is 90. This is because \u201c(90)^2 = 72600 = 7000\u201d.  The square root of 9500 is 37 so the square root of 10000 is \u201c(37)^2\u201d so the square root of \u201c(10000)^2\u201d = 9825.

I found Glitch which allowed me to create an easy site where I could display the program without anything glitching it so I just added the questions, instructions, and score keeping. The only two things I didn\u2019t like about the program were that the user doesn\u2019t get any explanation right away when they get an answer wrong, and also that there wasn\u2019t a correct answer to what the user had to get right. I figured if my friend was taking a quiz, she might want to know where she went wrong, so I added that into the program so she can know how many questions she got wrong.

There are only 9 players, so there are 9 numbers from which to choose. The most popular number is 30, which is the number closest to 51. If that number comes up early in the game, everyone else is forced to draw.

I don't know how she does everything at the same time. At least, she always finds time  to be with her husband and her children.\nMy friend also cooks fantastic meals and cleans her house all the time. I don't do those things at all, however I find time to go to a class to learn a new language. We could learn together. Her husband works as a teacher at school, she wants to give his children a better education and she has time to study. I was surprised she could do all these things, because I am busy when I am at home. Maybe I should learn how to manage my time so that I could free up some time and I could devote more time to learn this language.\nMy friend will get along very well here in this country. She enjoys learning new things, I am amazed that she finds the time for new things and her family at the same time. Maybe I should learn more than this language, what do you think?\n\nOutput:This text is called a \"diary entry\", because it is written as", "answer": "B: complete sentence"}

However, when you create a child, you've accomplished the ultimate goal which means you've achieved success.\n\n\n###Instruction:\nHow can I make a human? Can I build one with a bunch of random numbers and a lot of time? The answer should be yes! First, we need a human's gender. There are two options; male and female. We'll take the number 3 and divide it by 2. Let's call this the probability of male. When we divide all even numbers by 2, it is 2/2 = 1 so the probability of male is 3/2 = 1.5. Then choose a random number between 0 and 1 (the probability of 0 is 0, probability of 1 is 1). There is at least a 0.5 chance of male, so we put male as our choice. Next we need a body. We need two arms, two legs, and a head. There are eight possible numbers (0 to 7) for these choices so we will try 6 of them. After a random number is chosen for the body, the rest of the human is determined using that chance of the body being male and that chance of the number (0-7). If it's 3, then it is male and has a head of 6 (higher chance), two arms, and one leg. If it is 4, it is female and has a head of six and two legs. If it is 5, it's female and has two arms and one leg. If its 6 or 7, it's male and has one leg and one arm. If it is 0 or 1(2 possibilities), neither. But then there is no human. There is still 1/2 chance of the next choice.\n\nSo now that we have a human, we can choose what the human will be called. There are an infinite amount of names since any sequence of letters can be chosen, but let's put a few together that are likely. We'll start by taking the probability of the rest of the human (18 out of 40) and add it to the probability of the number assigned randomly. So, the first human that could have been chosen, we say, \"Let's take Adam and name him Adam.\" If", "answer": "E: reproduce"}

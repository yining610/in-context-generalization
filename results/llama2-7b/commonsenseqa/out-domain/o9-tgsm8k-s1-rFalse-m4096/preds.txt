So, you do not need to convert each digit to another representation as well like a string, int, or array. You can use the inbuilt `Math` class to do this. Below is a code to show you what I mean.<n><n>```java<n>    String m1 = "John has 89 stickers";<n>                        String m2 = "Zach is saving his money to but a brand new bike (it cost$100)";<n>                        String a,b, c;<n>                        c = a + b;<n>System.out.println(c == "14");<n>```<n><n>I also have the code on Runner 20. Just copy-paste this one and send in as your code.

Try to answer it before reading this line.<n><n>Answer: There are 1000 numbers that are divisible by 15 and divisible by 2.  The number will be divisible by 2 if all or only the two digits are even.  The only way to get an "even" 4-digit number is to replace one of its digits with a zero.  So to get a number divisible by 2, you can take any 5-digit number and change only the last digit to a 0.  Once you have done that to the number, it needs to be divided by 5 and it becomes a 4-digit number.<n><n>So the total number of 4-digit numbers divisible by 2 is 500, the first 500 numbers on the 1-1000 number list.<n><n>There are 120 such numbers that are also divisible by 5.  To achieve this, a 4-digit divisible-by-5 number can use any of the digits that are not divisible by 2 because two of those digits must appear in the number.  So if the number ends in 8, you can add the letter d at the end.  Since letters are not divisible by two, the number is then divisible by 5, and the 5-digit number becomes 4-digit.   <n><n>So the total is (120 * 1000) + (500 * 50) = 60,000.<n><n>

Choices:  A: rural area B: big city C: suburbs D: ohio E: countryside<n>Output:		B<n><n>### Solution:<n>To solve this problem I first made note of any terms I didn't know, and used my notes to make assumptions about the answer. For Question 1, we do not know the specific number of stickers remaining, but if we subtract this from 89 which is the original number, we can determine this and then subtract the 89 that we started with and then we have the initial number of stickers. Then for Q3, we do know the exact number of stickers we have left and how much we can save, so we would just find how much it is going to take and how much is in the bank already? For Q4, the first thing I did was to get the answer 3, 2, 4, in that order because that would result in a total of 3 legs on the problem. Next, I used my notes to get me started with Q5. I multiplied 10,450-1283=8,967. 8,967/480=19. Because we are trying to take the average of 287, then we would want to divide this 19 I found to our average for that is the correct answer. For Q6, we know that every subject took us a particular amount of time, so we can use that information to figure out how much in total it took us to do math homework. Next, I multiplied the answer from Q7 to see what we had and it is 40. I then multiplied 40 by the grams left in the fridge to solve the question. Next I multiplied all of the amounts of money owed by each person and divided that by 120 to find out what needed to be paid by each person. For Q9 I know that our total is 67 and I know each person has one coupons. Now, I simply need to multiply 67 by 4 to find out how much each person is paying for the meal. For Q10, I know that now since Tom's brother is the same age as Tom, Tom's dog is going to be two years old.<n>#### Instructions<n>Answer the following multiple choice questions.<n>Input: Mary had `89 stickers`.

To win, players race to make as many matches of stone and symbol as possible.Players take a symbol out of their stone hand, then make a match by placing it onto one of the matching 10 stones in front of them. Each stone has two sides and each side can have one of 30 symbols displayed next to it. Players can pick any of the three symbols in the stone, but players can pick the same symbol only if they are on the same side.If you make a match with a stone, you can keep it. But if instead you make three matches of stones and symbols with any of the three symbols on the stones, the symbols stay on the stone and you can continue playing. For example, if a player puts three matches of stones and symbol in one turn, the symbols might all go on one stone, or one stone might be turned over and show three sets of symbols, or you might have two sets of matches with three stones each and so on. You may stack symbols on top of a stone to make a match.The game ends when a player runs out of stones. The player with the most matches wins.<n>Output: A<n><n>Input:  There are 30 cute puppy photos in this book.

Because Mary had 89, and now we subtract 89 from 99 and get 10, and then we subtract 10 from 88 and get 88-10=78, and 78 is less than or equal to 89 so the answer is True.<n><n>Step 1:  (If the logic structure is True)  (Repeat the process)<n>If Mary had 89- stickers then we know that the answer is True. So we repeat the process and ask if Mary had 49 stickers.<n><n>IF the answer to any question is True, we move onto the next question<n><n>Output = 85, because 49+89=138 and 138-49=99, because 89-49=40 and we know that 99-40=59, which is equal to 85 because 85-40=45<n>```<n>```<n>Input: Zach...<n>Step 0:IF the answer is True, we look for the answer in the next statement.<n>Step 1: (if IF statement is True we move onto the next one)<n>Step 2: (If the answer is True then we run the same process with the next question).<n><n>Input: Mark...<n>Step 0 (IF the answer is True we go to the next one):<n>If Mark is given the total number of legs his animals, and he multiplies the total number of legs by three we should obtain 11, which would equate him to the number 11.

After that the weight will increase at a constant rate, 4 lb a day, so after 5 days 13.4 will be 4 lb 10 lb. After that, new weight = 10 lb 10 lb 4 lb = 10 pounds. So originally the watermelon weights 14 lb and it has increased to 10 lb.\"\nSo the final solution was C\n\nInput:\"The number of students in a grade consists of 28 boys and an odd number of girls.

The other two players (i.e., shepherds), each of them draw a card from a separate deck.  If the number of cards from the wolf's deck is less than that of the shepherd whose card has a smaller number, that shepherd becomes the new wolf.  If their number is the same, neither becomes the wolf.  If the wolf's number is more than that of the sheep whose card has the smaller number, the wolf keeps the original number, and it is a tie.  If the player who is a wolf during the final round becomes the wolf again after the final round, the wolf wins.  The wolf does not need to be a wolf continuously.  If any player becomes the wolf three rounds in a row, he or she would probably be called the \"king of the sheep\" (i.e., a wolf).  If such a king of the sheep would win the game, none of the shepherds would be able to win.  The wolves and the sheep take turns in becoming the wolf and the shepherd, respectively.

By definition, copying is not a concept as it does not exist, but a mental condition, a reaction, a behaviour.\nWhen you have a lot of knowledge or experience of a subject, it can be easier to remember and understand new concepts in the field. This is also useful for learning from the real world experience of others.\nCopied concepts can be more difficult to learn and to apply in new situations due to not having a deeper understanding of the underlying theory, principles, techniques, etc.\nThe more you know about a concept, the better the performance will be. So knowing more information can provide you with better performance but not necessarily faster learning or easier learning.\n\nCopying (or memorizing) information can provide the basis for learning faster as it makes the mind more sensitive to learning new information.\nAn empowering mindset can benefit you in learning hard things. It is true that a person with a negative mindset will have a much harder time learning hard things.\n\nSo the final answer should be B\n\nInput:What is the minimum number of times you can add 5 and get the same sum as adding 8 and 5?

{"idx": 342, "text": "\"Oxygen exists in two forms. It is soluble and it exists in its gaseous form. The gaseous state exists at 1 atmosphere of pressure, at a temperature of ~25C (not much different than the temperature in which we live).  When a given mass of oxygen is at this state, it takes up 0.3 liters/gram, or 20% of its volume. The solubility of oxygen is about 0.03 liters/gram (at 25 degrees C) so it takes up 3% of the volume of the gas (not much more, since we are at 1 atmosphere). So, for every 1,000 grams of the volume of oxygen, there will be 30 gms of 0.03 and 20gms of the oxygen it can absorb. Now there are about 1,200 liters of oxygen in the atmosphere.  So in 0.21 (I use 1/5 for simplicity) liters of oxygen, it would be (20/1000)g and (0.03/0.21). So 5.8 mL of oxygen. (That's only a liter smaller, so why not?) Above, you will see that I said 5.8 ml of oxygen in a liter of air. What if there was more? Or less  Well, if there was less, no one would be breathing (since the volume would be less than the volume of oxygen). This is also true if there is more than 438 liters.

So, A: Air is a bit confusing if you're thinking volume. There are two volumes of oxygen: the volume of the gas and the volume of the soluble material: 20% of the volume and 3% of the gas volume.

{"idx": 426, "text": "D\nSo the final answer was D\n\nInput: \"One of the most frequent causes of air travel delays in the past two decades has been thunderstorms. During the evening, when clouds have formed over populated areas, people often turn on their air conditioners or heating units. In many homes, the air conditioning unit actually exhausts into the outside air instead of pulling it from inside the house into the unit. Heating units do not expel outside air. During the summer months, some homes use the air conditioner almost constantly so that the air flowing out is hot. In the evening, when many residents turn on their units, a rush of hot outside air into the surrounding area can alter the temperature, causing the onset of a local thunderstorm. This is a relatively new problem that affects fewer than 10 percent of all weather delay cases, but it is becoming more common as more houses and businesses use air conditioning units during the early evening. The problem may be reduced by using exhaust air conditioners (those that exhaust air back inside), by installing \"air conditioner exhaust\" valves so that hot exhaust air cannot be released into the surrounding neighborhood, and by installing air conditioning units in homes with vents that draw air from the outside.\nWeather delay information is supplied by the FAA's Air Traffic Control System Command Center that gathers and processes weather information from national weather satellites and the ground stations of airports, weather stations and air traffic control towers. All aircraft must abide by weather minima (lowest practical visibility) that are based on conditions at a nearby airport. Delays occur both at airports and along weather delimitation routes (between airports). Weather information not only includes a report of visibility and ceiling height but whether turbulence is encountered in the vicinity. These weather delay factors may cause planes on landing approaches to abort their attempts and return to the gate. To further complicate things, visibility may not decrease suddenly to the point that aircraft cannot land when a new patch of clouds moves over an airport. Instead, the air may slowly decrease until the aircraft is unable to continue flying through the clouds. Under these conditions, the airliner may descend because of loss of visibility and attempt to land on another runway. There is usually sufficient advance notice so that the plane is turned around for a return trip to the airport of origin or a nearby departure", "answer": "E: fatigue"}

A single die has the same probability of landing on each face, so we can calculate P ( X = 1 ), P ( X = 2 ), P ( X = n ) by rolling X times, and multiplying each result by the same probability of rolling a 6 on an individual roll. In binomial distribution, if the total number of trials are fixed, the expected probability of X, the sample space is constant with N, the number of trials.\n\n## 7.

Here's a short list of things to think about that will help you achieve higher grades in Mathematics.\n\n<ul width=\"100%\" style=\"display: list-style-type: square\"><li>\n<p>(i) The main principle in Mathematics is that any mathematical expression can be expressed in terms of addition and subtraction, the four number operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division), \nthe four processes (adding up, subtracting down, multiplying out and dividing in) of the mathematical operations, and the four operators (+, -, *, /) over and again and again. This principle is not taught in schools. \nIt should be taught from a very young age. It is the principle by which higher grades, without any effort, are automatically achieved just by teaching the principles clearly.</p>\n\n<p>(ii) Mathematics includes the branch of logic, which can be used to explain all mathematics and also in other branches of science, as well as philosophy and ethics. To achieve a high grade in Mathematics, a good understanding of logical concepts is necessary. This principle is not widely taught nowadays. It has only been introduced by the World Heritage Curricula & Teaching, which is available on the website of The TM Forum.</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\n(iii) Mathematics includes the concept of 'number theory'. For example, every integer can be written in the form of a'multiple of one less than a known number'.

Examples of \u201cbasic\u201d sweeteners are sugar and honey..Candies are often categorized by type, such as chocolate, non-chocolate, chewing gum, lollies, or lollipops. Cut-out cookies or crackers, known as biscuits in the United Kingdom and Australia, are candy which has a special type of cookie or cracker dough stamped or otherwise modified to resemble an image on one or both sides.

How many gallons will be required for a 125-mile trip? Choices: A: 93 gallons B: 207 gallons C: 243 gallons D: 93,000 gallons E: 0\nOutput: \"There is a 25% markup of the difference in distance, so a 93 mile journey requires 25% more than the number of miles 93. If you make a 125 mile journey than you only would require the number of miles + 25% which will be equal to 125mile/2(1-25%)= 129.75 miles. 93+25% of 93 is 117. Which is also the number of gallons we need for 125 miles. Choice \"D\" is the only choice of options which is inaccurate. A 93 mile trip requires a certain number.

Playing is a way to use up excess energy, rather than store it or burn it off.Eating grass does not store or convert energy for immediate use.

Or one could choose A and B, and B and C, in a 1-2-1-1 formation.\nSo the final answer A.\n\n## Problem 6\nGiven a statement, you\u2019re asked to choose whether that statement is a citation, a definition, a question, a fragment, a quote, or another type of sentence. To choose a specific answer, you\u2019ll be shown a text box next to the statement with multiple choice buttons in it. A \u201c?\u201d will be in the box as well, letting you choose that this text is a question or statement.\n\nInput : Which of the following is art? A: a painting B: a performance C: a photograph D: none of these\nOutput: You can see that I'm quite a crazed individual, but that's okay :) I don't have a formal definition of art. Choose either c or d.\nI'm a big Botticelli fan, though, so I'm kind of tempted by A, which is what I wrote.\n\n## Problems 7 and 8\nGiven a question, you\u2019ll be asked to choose one of many possible answers on the next page. Choose carefully if all answers could fit.\n\nInput : A painting, a photograph, and music are examples of what? A: aural art B: oral art C: visual art D: aural-oral art F: oral-visual art E: aural-visual-oral art G: aural-visual art H: oral-visual-oral art\nOutput: Okay, this one is easy:\nIf you think that oral art is the right choice, you should think twice,", "answer": "A: relax"}

The policy is to install cameras that identify every car\u2019s license plate and associate it with data on the driver, including past accident records, and then to issue warnings to drivers who are likely to cause car accidents. The government agency that oversees this program believes that incentivizing drivers to change their behavior can reduce the numbers of accidents by at least one-third over a fiveyear period.\nThe agency does not want to spend too heavily on this program, however, because some drivers may never change their driving behavior and therefore should not be paid a dime. The government agency would like to design a policy to optimize payments to drivers that are calculated to maximize social utility, such as the expected number of future accidents that will be avoided. Using these assumptions and others, what is the maximum amount that the agency can set as a minimum payout per driver that still maximizes the expected future accident rate? A) $11.38 B) $25.08 C) $65.72 D) $2,575.61 E) $931.43\nOutput: A. $11.45 is the absolute maximum; the only answer where the driver could receive nothing. So it is the optimum.

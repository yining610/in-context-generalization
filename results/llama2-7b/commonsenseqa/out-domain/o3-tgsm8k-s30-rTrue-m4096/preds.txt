How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.

Choices:  A: new jersey B: eastern united states C: good repair D: connecticut E: arizona<n>Output:		A<n>This one was pretty simple I just had to eliminate each answer as I found it to be false.<n>I checked B) Eastern United States to see if we had any toll roads. We do not. Same goes for New Jersey. I checked C) Good Repair to see if the John Davis Lodge is on a very well maintained highway. Then I checked D) Connecticut & Arizona. We do not have any toll roads in Arizona. If both answer choices were false I would simply eliminate C) Good repair from my options and move on to check for each one. I started with A) New Jersey since it was the only place I had ruled out earlier that had toll roads. I would then move on to check each one and keep moving back and forth.<n>Once I knew the final answer I just put what I needed to know into the question and answered it like so: The John Davis Lodge is in the new jersey and it is a toll road. So the  final answer would be A and New Jersey.<n><n>Input: A toll road in the east is called the John Davis Lodge. The John Davis Lodge costs $20 to enter and requires another payment of $10 to exit. The John Davis Lode has 12 entrances and 12 exits. Each entrance and exit costs the same. What is the total amount of money that drivers of cars pay to drive the John Davis Lodge, in dollars?<n>Output: A driver of a car that enters and exits a single time will pay 20+10 = <<20+10=30>>30.<n>Two drivers of cars paying 30 times between them will cost 2*(20+10)+2*(30+10) = <<2*(20+20)=40>>40.<n>Two drivers paying three times will cost 2*(30+20)+2*3(20+10) or 40+40+6 = <<40+40=80>>80 because there are six exits and entrances.<n>So the final answser is 80 because the question asks for the total amount of money the drivers paid. It does not specify the total number of drivers. This last question I just wanted to point out how important it was to read the question as exactly as it is written to

You want to use a for loop to make a string, which will then be sorted and concatenated to create the array.  Note that if you use int array[5][5], you can index it like a 2-dimentional array but the number of ways will not be the same because your first dimension is a number not a character array as the strings are placed into the array.<n>Output: You are required to use a two dimensional array of size 2x2 to determine the number of permutations.  You will create a temporary string wherein the user enters the rows and columns (5 and 5, respectively, in the example above). Then, you would create an array to hold these digits.  Next, you would utilize the string’s inbuilt concatenation operator @ to append each column to the string of rows.<n>In conclusion, your output will be an array that is created with the number of strings as entries, which holds each string of digits and the corresponding numbers in the original array.

A pantry also doesn’t have to worry about opening and closing your door multiple times as you do with a kitchen cupboard or a refrigerator.  Pantries are more consistent because you’re less likely to be opening the door to get out some food than you’d be to get out food from your freezer.<n>*Darkness Pantries are often designed for dark spaces to further reduce the chance of food spoiling.  A good rule of thumb is that the darker and drier a space the better your food will last.<n>*Less exposure than other places:  Because pantry’s are often located away from the center of your home, they have less exposure.  For example a kitchen counter and a refrigerator are constantly exposed to a lot of different things in a house.  Pantries can have a few items in their without the worry of having something fall in there which could spoil your food.<n><n>Input: How can you make $100?<n><n>Output:  Start with 4 quarters in pocket.  <n>Quarters have 50% silver content. <n>$100 is equal to 25 quarters <n><n>Input: What’s a factor of -4?<n><n>Output: All the factors of -4 are: -4,-1,-2,-3<n><n>Input: What is the median yearly income for the following list of incomes?<n><n>a.) 12 10 14 14 11 12 16 <n>b.) $12 99 92 97 95 42 72 <n>c.) -12 5 7 8 12 2 11 7<n><n>Output: Median income is equal to the middle value of the list.

Choices:  A: brown hair B: names C: two eyes D: will E: brains<n>Output:		The first thing that jumps to my mind is a surname or family name.<n>The definition of surname means a term (such as Smith or Gonzales) used to indicate, identify, or classify a person, family, or other group.<n><n>As a person marries and has children their spouses last name is almost always used as the family last name to identify their children for official records, such as Social security cards.<n>So, a family is defined as a persons extended relationship. An extended family often includes the persons siblings, inlaws, and children. Even if you have a small family or nuclear family, it is likely that the spouses last name will be the family surname. Another thing families share are names, both given and surnames, for official records.

I thought to myself what other things did families share? They shared the same blood, however if they were siblings they would not share the same blood anymore after puberty. Also, I would assume for a family that lived in the same place or in very close proximity would share resources like the same food, drink, and air to breathe. However, I did not have any facts to back up these assumptions.<n><n>Input: In a grocery store sells bags of flour for $3.99 apiece. It charges $2.49 for one egg. Which is the better bargain?

Whole wheat flour has more vitamins and minerals than any other type of flour available commercially. When you first see whole wheat flour on the shelf it may have the same price as other flours. However, when you look at the nutrition label, it has more protein and is lower in sugar and sodium. You might be thinking why the whole wheat flour is cheaper and for me my first thoughts were the same. So I looked up the nutrient content of whole wheat flour and I learned that this flour has a high amount of beta-endorphins. Beta-endorphins occur naturally, and are

What is the average of the bills of all customers?  Solution: The first thought that I had was to add together every customer's bill, average all of the bills and repeat until I found the average bill. Since this would take way to long I decided to go a different route of doing it. In order to find the answer quickly I needed to know how to add 1060 bills. To do this you need to know the number of whole dollars in 1060 and then subtract the cents. In this case, there are 5240/100=<<5240/46=115>>115 cents missing so I added those 115 cents to both my average and the bills of each customer because those cents could not be the average dollars, so they needed to be thrown it. I then took the average of all the bills and rounded it off to keep the answer. The final answer is $12.376<n><n><n>### Instruction:The function random(100) takes 100 inputs; the function print(random(100)) is another function which takes these 100 inputs from the first and prints them out according to a probabilistic schedule.

Choices:  A: soccer game B: capillaries C: ball D: animals E: person<n>Output:		The correct answer is capillaries.<n>Capillaries are the smallest vessels of the circulatory system. Since the blood runs through capillaries, it is not spilled during the sport due to the structure of capillaries. Blood is spilt during the sport of soccer (or football), where there is frequent kicking and hitting causing lots of blood leakage from the players' tissues. Blood is spilled during the sport of basketball where it gets spilled during shots, dives, and physical contact. Since the blood runs into a pool after a person dies (or is euthanized), it is spilled due to death. Therefore, the blood is not spilled during this sport. Blood is NOT spilled during the sport during a ball, since there are no fights or physical contact, hence no blood spilled.<n>

A bonsai is grown and trained so the tree can have the illusion of being many times the actual size of the tree itself.  Bonsai are very difficult to keep up, you must water, fertilize and prune this tree daily.<n>1.

If floors are kept clean for holy purposes, why are there  floors? The floors in a basement are not clean so this must not be an option. The floors of all buildings cannot work as most buildings have multiple floors. The only thing that fits is the synagogue because only there floors are kept clean and holy. The carpet and restaurant make the most sense as if floors are kept clean, they cannot be on carpets.<n><n>Instruction:Answer the following. Make up a reason justifying your answer.<n>I believe that the correct answer is E. It says holy and not sacred<n>Sacred means holy and that is what I would choose.<n>Instruction:<n>Input: A company is currently charging customers $100 for a product which they have been selling for more than 50 years for their standard packaging.

Choices:  A: allergic reaction B: gain weight C: have fun D: heartburn E: food poisoning<n>Output:		The answer is B.Allergic reaction because all you need to do is get some information about how your body reacts. Also, do not eat food from a place that you do not know is safe to eat if you have food hypersensitivity, you might as well not eat that all all because it might kill you. What is the most important aspect of food that you eat is the labeling of what is on and inside that food.

The only thing a decimal and a percentage have in common is its use for measuring.<n>A percentage can be expressed as a decimal as 40100 = 4.01% or it can be expressed as a fraction, 4010.<n>The answer is A. If you want to answer this question you need to know some facts about decimals and percentages. Here is a short explanation about percentages: The whole is 100% of a percentage, the quesnt part is what the percentage represents. So 40101/100x100 = 1.5%. This would mean that the percentage answer 40.1% and the decimal is 0.152439...and on and on. You can use this type of reasoning to get the answer to this question. Here are some things to remember<n>x = 1.5<n>1.5 = (numerator) / (denominator)<n>1.718 = 1.5 over 1<n>1.524 = 1.5 * 1<n>1.719 = 1.5 or 0.3<n>So you see for one to get to one-point-something, it is necessary to multiply by 1.5 a lot of times. If you look at it from x = 1. Then if x = 2, then 2 = (1) * 1.5 and so on. This means to get the correct answer to this question you would have to multiply by 1 point five times and so forth

When you breathe, your inhale (inhalation) forces oxygen into your lungs. Then, when you exhale (exhalation), carbon dioxide is pushed out of your lungs and back into the environment. Inhalation and exhalation is the process of breathing. How breathing happens and why it is important for good health is determined by your nervous system. Through your nervous system the signals to breathe are generated in your brain stem, which receives data from several other areas of your body.<n>

It takes 60 minutes for the winds to diminish.  At the end of the 60 minutes, the herds are moved to the structures where they can stay for 24 hours after a tornado before going outside again.  The tornadoes that form in Kansas and Oklahoma have winds of more than 300 MPH.  How long does it take to move all of the animals from the pens in the pasture—where they normally stay—to the barns?<n>Output: The problem can be formulated in terms of moving the animals to the shelters in advance of the storm.<n>For a single storm, the number of hours it takes to move X animals from the field to the barn is<n>x1/2+x hours<n>The herd must return at the end of 120 minutes.  Thus, x1/2+x-120+x=0<n>For a herd of X animals, this becomes<n>120x+X(x/2+x)-120=0<n>120x/X-x+120-x=0<n>X*120-X(-120)+120=0 x=120,000<n>So the answer is x = 120,031<n><n>   <n>      <n><n>Input:When a carousel rotates, the riders experience g-forces.

She can only keep track of the days between Monday and Sunday.  During the course of the week, she might sell several pairs of socks on different days.  She is paid a base salary of $7,000.12 per week, which is constant over a week.  On her salary, how much would she earn after selling 7 pairs of socks (at $2.50/pp) in two weeks when discounting is in effect?<n>Output: 7*2 = <<7*2=14>>14 sox sold in less than two weeks.<n>In order to sell 14 sox she has to make 14 pairs so she would need to sell 7 pairs on one week and the other 7 on the second week.  In order to sell 7 pairs in two weeks, she would have to sell 3.5 pairs per day.<n>14 sox sold divided by 3.5 = <<14 sox sold/3.5 = 4>>4 days.<n>This means she would need to sell around 4 days worth of sox in each week to meet her requirement.<n>Her weekly pay = 7000/7 = <<7000/1/7=1000>>1000 per week.<n>1000 x 4 = <<1000 x4=4000>>4000<n>Then subtract the weekly pay = 4000-7000.14 = <<4000-2500=1500>>1500.<n>The final answer is 1500<n> Input:A salesman wants the average amount of money that he makes in a week.

As an emergency response precaution, everyone is expected to stock pile an adequate supply of emergency preparedness supplies.  The emergency manager has determined that one gallon of water per day is needed for each person for three days.  Therefore, in order to be properly stockpiled for 14 days, the following is required:<n>1:	Number of people<n>2:	Adequate supply of water<n>3:	Amount of time necessary to fully stockpile<n>Output:<n>The answer to this question is 2 (since 2 is half of 4). If every person is expected to have 1 gallon of water per person for 3 days, then each person will need 1/3 of 1 gallon per day, or 1/4 gallon per day. If there are 4 people in a family, each person will therefore need 3/4 of a gallon of water per 3 days, or 1/3 of a gallon per day. 1/3 of the gallon water per day, will need to be multiplied by the number of people in the family. 2/4 of a gallons per day per family is required to adequately stockpile 14 days of water for 4 people. 2/4 is equivalent to 2/4 of 1 gallon equals 1/2 gallon (the half of 1 gallon required per day for 3

He's planning on plowing 5 acres of land and is going to need a plow.  The plow he has for his plow needs a minimum of 2 animals to pull it.  How can he best use his animals to complete his work?<n>Output: The problem is that he doesn't have a sufficient number of hybrids to complete his work.  He can do it if he has 2 cows and 3 mules, but he would still need a plow for only 2 acres.  So he'll have to do it using any combination of animals until he has the right number of animals and then he can just let the mule and cow hybrids do the rest. The 3rd solution will produce the correct answer.<n><n>Input: A farmer has a hog pen and a sheep pen.  All of the sheep have 6 legs.  All of the hogs have 4 legs.

If at any time after the installation of the new system she decides she isn’t satisfied with the performance of the system and wants to replace it, she will pay an additional cost of $2500.0  If at any time after installation she wants to re-install the same model system she had in the prior 3 years, the replacement cost will be $1000.0.  She wants to find a way to determine whether the replacement of the security system is preferable to just upgrading the existing system.<n>  If she chooses to just upgrade the system, what is the total cost of doing so for the 1st year?<n>  If she choices to replace the system, how much will it cost each year (a) to replace the system? (b) to install a new system?<n>  If she decides to replace the system, for how many consecutive years would the replacement costs exceed the cost of upgrading?<n>Output:  If she chooses a new security system (instead of upgrading the system), in the first year, it will replace the current system on cost for $5000, and re-install the old system for $1000, for a total cost of $6000 the first year.<n><n>  If she choes replacement, the initial cost to replace the security system is $2500, the additional cost to re-install the system is $1000 each successive year for 3 years.<n><n>  If it is decided to replace the system it will be replaced for 3 years. If she chooses an upgrade it will be upgraded for 3 years. The cost for the replacement is greater in the first 3 years.<n>

If they commit an infraction, they are suspended for a period of time. (A)  This punishment prevents them from competing. <n>There are different reasons why professional athletes can’t compete.  The most common reason is that they get suspended for causing harm to other people by performing an illegal move.[6]  Another reason they sometimes can’t compete is when there are weather problems (E).  Snow can cause bad conditions for sledding, and heavy rain can create a mudslide on a snowy field.[7]  Additionally, professional athletes could be in pain (B)  or they could have a medical restriction that prevents them from participating (C).  The last reason for not being able to play is because a person is injured while playing (D). <n>Even though the suspension is a punishment, and not a reward (the athletes were doing something that warranted it), the suspension time still prevents them from completing and receiving a reward for competing during that season, or during the event; they lose out on a season because of it.  By being unable to compete in the regular seasons, they lose money.[6]  One year, former NBA star Kobe Bryant missed an entire season, which cost him tens of millions of dollars in performance bonuses alone. <n>So the final answer the (E)<n><n>Input: Choices:  A) to go B) on to  C) go  D) to  E) go C) The woman would like to visit the beach and the museum and so we decided to go to the beach first and visit the museum later.<n><n>Output:The woman wants to go to the beach and then the museum.<n>So the final option is (C)<n><n>Input:In what month of a two-month tour would an airline save the most money (by charging only a “penalty”, if the passenger is a no-show and cancels with under $50 penalty)?

Choices:  A: next to the house B: keeping things in C: backyard D: farm yard E: ranch<n>Output:		Shed could very well be at any location within the given options. If so, the only possible answers are C, D and E. If we choose option A: next to the House then Shed can be of any size it wants. But shed can’t have enough space that it blocks the neighboring house to get light or any other source that the house needs.  If Shed is in option B, keeping things in, then Shed couldn’t be that wide unless its a small 1 story building. If shed is in option D, a farm yard, you can have a building that would be of any size, because there isn’t a neighbor house that needs it’s own space (unlike option A, next to the house). But if we choose option E- a ranch, the building we are building doesn’t have to fit perfectly by itself, it can have it’s own space as to not block the ranch house. But shed could also have a smaller size then the other options. This means that we don’t need all those options of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, options are simply A, B, D or E<n>So the final answer  is E a ranch for shed<n><n>Input:A house is for sale.

He would get up in the morning, and then put them in what state again? Choices:  A: upside down B: in motion C: active D: wakefulness E: resthold<n>Output:		B. When a ball is thrown, it is in a state of motion.  We could say that this is a change in the ball's state, from still to in motion.  The ball now has energy due to the kinetic motion of the ball, which is conserved.<n>Motion always results in a change in an object's state.[1]<n>When bernoulli said that an airplane wing will move faster than 400mph at it is not being disturbed, what was the 1st part of his statement?

However, it also has a lot of differences. For instance, poetry is created by an author and does not involve any other people. Poetry is also not done in the same way as art.

His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

There is no way 2 people and 7 chicken can kill each other.<n><n>Input: A large group of people decided to play a game in which they tossed a coin and gave it to the person with the head showing.  After that person had the coin in his or her possession for less than 10 seconds, he or she turned so that only 1 side was turning up (say the reverse of what it was before).  As the person turned, he tossed it straight up;  the player then had 10 seconds to catch the coin.  If the player failed, then another player (not the one who tossed it) was given the opportunity to toss it.  This went on, changing players, until one toss failed.<n>  The question was to determine how many players would actually fail to catch the coin, considering only players who tossed successfully.  If they tossed and then missed, they did not count as having tried to catch the coin.<n>Output: 2<n><n>Input: What is 164 divided by 16?<n>Output: 10<n>

You do not buy the first item because it cost less. So you spend $35

Let's say our section length is n feet long.  That leaves us with 3n sections for that length (since it is n times itself).  When n gets big the difference in between the value of n does not get that much bigger, but since we have only 99999 to work with, we can still figure this out ourselves.  n becomes equal to 99 and 3*99 = 297.<n>99/297 (is that how it would be worded?)  is very close to 33 but 99% is 0.000099 so it is close but not accurate.

Choices:  A: city B: michigan C: three feet D: subdivision E: three arm span<n>Output:		C<n>A yard is simply an amount of area contained by something.  Michigan is too specific.  "three feet" is too specific.  'The size of three arm spans' leaves it an open interpretation as to whether it is the distance between the ends of an arm, or the length of an arm itself.  'Subdivision' does NOT answer the question in a way that we interpret as an answer to the question.<n>A good example to use here is "Subdivision" which is essentially an area that is sectioned off.  A football field is in it's own subdivision, as well as every area in front of each goal line.  However, this subdivision of an area cannot be used, as it in itself is not the area itself.<n>It could also be possible that 'City is in the incorrect format as all others are made as singular nouns, whereas city is of course plural.<n>Thus it is the correct answer C.<n><n><n>'''============================================================================================'''<n>'''Multiple choice question:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n><n><n>Input: Choices:    -13     A: 6   B: 5   C: 0   D: 10   E: -5   Answer: D<n><n>Output: D<n>First and second numbers both positive, third and fourth all negative.

How far will the ship travel downstream before it arrives?<n>Output: A right triangle has 18-((1+(2/5))9ft legs, with legs a and b and hypotenuse c=(2/5)*18ft. The ship must travel downstream to the point where c is equal to a+b, then across the remainder of the river to the port. c = 18-((6/10)-((1+(2/20)))-((1+(2)/10) = (((6/10))+(1+(2/2

How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Output: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>So the final answer is 800<n><n>Input:Where above your kitchen sink could you store canned food? Choices:  A: cupboard B: oven C: grocery store D: pantry E: cellar<n>Output:		A, cupboard<n>Choice E is out because a cellar isn’t located above your kitchen sink.<n>Choices B, C, and D involve a longer round-trip to get the canned food back and are thus more expensive than placing the canned food in a cupboard.<n>Choices A, B, C, and E involve making a trip to the grocery store during the busy times of the day, and thus are more expensive and less convenient than placing the food in a cupboard<n>The option to place your canned food in a grocery store is the most expensive<n>The option to place the canned food in your cellar is the least expensive<n>Therefore, you should buy grocery store food in E, and keep that food in grocery store B. Then you should get food in your other stores (which is cheap at option A because the store doesn’t make extra trips) and put that food in your cupboards, which are also cheap. This way, your food is always stocked and ready — and you never need to move more than a few feet to get it.<n>

Choices: 75 yards 120 yards 50 yards 0 yards<n>Output: 50 yards.<n>75 yards is 100 times as long as 50 yards.  And 120 yards is 1.5 times as long as 75 yards.<n>0 yards is zero.<n>So, 1.50 = <<1.50=3>>3 is equal to 1, and 3 times 50 yards gives you 150 yards.<n>Which is 120 more than 50, so 75 yards is 210 yards long.<n><n>If you take an object ten thousand times as long as you (a football field) and walk ten thousand times as far, or 10,000,000m, then back to your starting point, that represents a one way trip of 10,020 m, or about 20.2 km or a little over 12 miles.<n><n>The longest football field in the world is in Bremen, Germany.  It's three thousand meters long.  That means a 600m penalty corner would take 2/3 of the length of the field, or roughly 2,000m.<n>Football field width: 36+2yds = 164 feet.<n><n>So a penalty corner in the middle of the field should take you ~7 minutes going against the wind/current.  However, the time required to go 100 yards, to catch up with the other team, could depend on the players speed.<n>For example, if you're running at 10 m/s, then it is going to take you 10/10 = <<10/10=2>>2 hundredths, or 2 tenths, or 2 seconds to go 10 yards (9.144 meters) If somebody was running 15 m/s, then they would go 10yards/15 = <<10yards/3=3.333>>3.333 seconds, so it would take them 3-3rds or roughly 2.5 seconds to go

How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Output: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>So the final answer is 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

Choices:  A: trunk B: drawer C: suitcase D: book shelf E: washing machine<n>Output:		Clothing is typically found in a trunk unless you have a very unusual washing machine or someone has a very strange book shelf.  It also takes quite a bit of extra effort to find clothing in the drawer or suitcase, as these are typically used to store personal or family items.<n>So you can eliminate suitcases and drawers.  If we go with trunk then let's assume that this is a metal trunk because it will hold more items than a wooden trunk.  <n>But if the trunk is filled with non-clothing items, then you will need to take the clothes out of it in order to put them on.  So we also need to discount wooden trunks.  You may also have a very large wooden trunk or metal trunk that you use to store family items,  which is the only remaining explanation for where  you would find old clothes.  <n>You could find clothes in a book shelf, and in this case I assume it is one of the newer open shelving type designs that is used for family photos, rather than traditional wooden book shelves, which would not be used to store clothing.  <n>So if you put these together the answers could be E: washing machine, A: trunk, B: drawer and C: suitcase<n>So you need to eliminate C, B and D.

His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.

Also, if the theater holds 200 people<n>and you rent out the whole theater, there might be some extra seats in another theater nearby.<n>Also, if you rent a building, there might be extra empty floor space in a nearby other building.<n>If you rent a floor, there might be extra rooms in that big tower building near you.<n>Also the theater seats might be more like a boat, so they will only take 200 people, whereas<n>there might be an extra 80 chairs in the nearby empty theater. <n><n>#### Hint on HINT8: If you were to rent a floor in a big skyscraper and then rent out several rooms for a conference, you might only want to rent out the rooms on the floor so that everyone would be on the same floor. You would probably rent out only 4 rooms and not the entire floor. The same would be true for a conference room in a theater. You don't rent out the entire theater if the theater doesn't go to the second-story.<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n><n><n><n><n>

Therefore if you are standing on the kth out of n steps, where k ≥ 1 is known, it is possible that you are the n-1st person standing there, but then it is also possible that you are the (n-1)-th, and of course that you are either the (n-2)-th or some other. Therefore, if k is known, the kth person out of n can be anywhere between the (n-n-k+1)-th and the k-th step out of n, and it’s easy to see that the total number of ways that person could end up that far from the last step is exactly (n-n-1-k+1). Therefore, from that you can conclude immediately that if you know the (n-1)th person to be exactly k steps out of n, you can immediately determine, based on just a simple computation, the steps that (n-n-2)-th person is standing and the steps that (n/2)+1st person stands on, and if you were to take both of those steps, then you would arrive right at the (n-1)(n-1)-th person

Choices:  A: redemption B: isolation C: absolution D: great relief E: feel better<n>Output:		Answer choices to A) redemption and B) absolution are incorrect because of the "forgiving" that precedes them.<n>The word "forgiving" is a predicate adjective which is either subjective, objective, or complement.<n><n>Subjective:<n>For example:<n>"John is a forgiving person."<n><n>Having the attribute "forgiving" describes John alone.<n>The subject is usually a pronoun and is always placed before the predicate adjective.<n><n>Objective:<n>For example:"The teacher of the students was forgiving."<n>Having the attribute describes the class of people that include the noun students.<n>The noun is usually in a prepositional phrase ("of the students") and is always placed after the predicatadjective.<n><n>Complement:<n>For example: "Some people believe X and others believe Y."<n>Sometimes an adjective will precede (preceding) the subjective or objective attribute:<n>"Some believe Y and others believe X."<n><n>The phrase "believe Y" has the sense of 'Yers' and 'be X-ers' simultaneously.<n>In a subjective statement, the adjective, and object complement can only be a noun, pronoun, or predicate noun.<n><n>In an objective statement, both predicates (adjectives) are predicates because the subject can be replaced by an article or possessive noun, pronoun or predicate noun. For example:<n>"Mary is a forgiving person" is the same as:<n>"She is a person."<n>Whether the subject is a pronoun or a noun, the complement predicates are the same:<n>"She is forgiving."<n><n>"She is a forgiving person.The sentence above has the complement structure with the adjective 'forgiving' as a predicate adjective.<n>Therefore, the correct answer is A: redemption because the sentence is objective.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question below in a sentence or two.<n><n>What is the difference between the subjective and objective form of an adjective and how would you use each form in a sentence?<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n><n>Input 1:The car-rental agencycharges $3/day for a car.

There are many arrangements for different price ranges and she wants to buy the cheapest arrangement possible without going lower than the 12 stems.  What is the smallest number of stems she can buy?<n>Output: She can only buy 12 stems because that is the lowest price.  There will never be 11 stems<n><n>Input: A woman is looking at buying appliances to cook with, she needs a stove.  The first one she looks at is a $200 electric stove. The second one she looks at costs $300 and is gas, a fuel that is more expense then electricity. The woman is looking to spend no more than $250 on her total appliance purchase. What is the maximum price for the gas stove if she is looking to buy the electric stove?<n>Output: Since the gas stove is more expensive than the electric stove she can only spend $250 on the gas stove if the electric is $200.  Therefore that would leave $50 for the gas stove.  So the max price would be $300 for the gas stoves since anything more than that would make her go over the budget.<n><n>Input: You can buy the first three of a new kind of cellphone for 35 euros each, the next three for 30 euros each, and the remaining three for 20 euros each.

Choices:  A: make noise B: band C: museum D: concert hall E: rubber band<n>Output:		Correct Answer: All of the above! [source](http://wilkinsonschool.com/wisdom/2018/10/31/12971/)<br><n>For those who don't know what a harpsichord is [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpsichord):<br>"A harpsichord is an early keyboard musical instrument in which the strings are set into vibration by a quill or plectrum picked up by a plectrum mechanism as the keyboard is pressed. A harpsichord typically has a two-manual keyboard with a clavichord-style mechanism for the manuals and a independent set of keyboard mechanisms for the pedalboard, with the mechanism to the lowest octave being the louder and thus deeper. As well as a keyboard, most harpsichords since the late Baroque era have had a nut placed over one end of the strings allowing the player to damp the string as they played allowing for dynamics. Although more expensive than the traditional "struck" harpsichords, modern harpsichords are easier to tune and maintain, and may have improved acoustic effects. The more traditional type, a struck harpsichord, produces sound when a tiny padded hammer strikes a steel string. The modern variety is known as a "piano-harpsichord" because it has hammers (but not sustainers) similar to those on a piano."<br><n>Besides that, this question is one of the top questions from one of the best quiz masters on Kahoot so it is likely that it will be asked there since this is the best way to prepare quizzes for students.<n><n>

This sentence is a paradox. In a paradox, the statement is both true and not true at the same time, or even contradictory. The paradox is what the statement is saying in the sentence. An example of a paradox is this: “I can’t believe how expensive these shoes are. They are way too expensive, but I still can’t stop trying to buy them.” In the sentence above, I can’t believe how these shoes are expensive and I still want to buy them. This is an example of a paradoxy.<n><n>Output: The statement “If you put the Blue in the Bucket and Poured it in a bucket the water will be dirty” Does not make logical sense. In order for the water to be Dirty you would need to add water to the bucket of water that is already in it, this would not increase or make the water dirty. So to make the statement valid, we would need to include an add on statement. An example: “If you put the color blue in the bucket and poured it you would get an empty bucket” or “You would get blue colored water”<n>```<n>

Choices:  A: company B: airport C: wall D: computer network E: love<n>Output:		He was delayed to where his connection was so to a computer network<n>Given he was delayed, he must've had a connection.  But what made him have a connection?  Clearly it is through either C or D.  This doesn't answer the entire problem so I will make an educated guess through C due to the fact that he was delayed so he must have had a connection to a computer network.<n>Given that his connection was C, then that means that C=A and E is his connection.<n>So the final choice is a computer network.

Choices:  A: atom B: anything C: air D: feet E: hands<n>Output:		The correct answer is Molecules.<n>We’re working with the units of atoms per molecule, while the question is asking about the objects themselves. The question is the same word as the unit of measurement, which tells us that molecules are the answer unit.<n>For example, when the unit of measurement is atoms per molecule (the answer) you want to count the number of atoms in a molecule. In contrast, when the units are something per something else, you want to find some number that when multiplied by the first unit leaves the second unit unchanged – you’re counting things with as your unit, and want to determine what you have, not what is in each unit.<n>And when the units are everything per everything else, you have to go outside the question – in the example there can be anything in any part of the question.<n>For the second example, you can use the formula:<n>(1/4) / 4 = 1 / 1 = 1<n>Thus, to find out what the answer is, you can just multiply both sides by 4.<n>So, in this case 1/4 is the answer: answer choice C is correct.

How many countries border that country?<n>Output: The length of the west-coast-to-east-coast distance is 9k.<n>When it goes down 130, we know that’s a 400-ft difference. So it goes down 400 and stays in the range of an even multiple of 10K.<n>So we know, after the 400-foot difference, that east coast is at position 73 of 9K.<n><n>When the north-south-distances is at decreased by the same 130 the following day, then it’s at position 3 of that range (2K).<n>So in order to add that to the previous range (130) we know that there’s 301 feet from east-coast-to north-coast then it goes to 311 feet from mid-coast to north-coast.<n><n>Between mid-coast to south-coast and to mid-coast is 7 1/2 inch.<n><n>So from west-coast to east-coast the difference is 400 feet and from mid-coast-to west coast the difference is 7.5 inches.

His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Output: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>So the final answer is 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.

Choices:  A: water fountain B: military base C: apartment D: fire house E: bus stop<n>Output:		The correct answer is fire house<n>Explanation: In a fire house, they have to respond to calls on short notice where they arrive quick. For example, they have to arrive quick to get to the station so firefighters are close and close is good. Also they are more likely to have a full tank of gas close because the tank is full and also they don't need to fill their tanks like some gas stations. Additionally, they are most likely to have warm water on hand for the firefighters to wash up. Therefore, standing on a line near the station could help them.<n><n>Input: What is a word that begins and ends with the letter A?<n>Output: The answer is A.<n>Explanation: You can't think of a word that begins and end with the letter A but still have A in the middle.<n>You can see that this is a "reversible" word.<n>It can be "reversed" so that "AA" becomes "A".<n><n>Input: A baseball team goes from city A to city B.

Choices:  A: jungle B: bamboo grove C: australian outback D: china E: child's book<n>Output:		Choice A is the correct answer.<n>Given that the museum wanted to put a koala bear display where they'd usually find a Panda, Choices A, B, and C would not make sense because while a koala could live in jungle-type environments this wouldn't be a great fit, because koalas are Australian marsupials and a koala can't "grow up" in bamboo forest and also pandariffic because a koala can'ts climb high enough like a panda can. So Choices B and C would not make any sense.<n>Choice D is false because this is a joke!  They made a display of a koala bear, which can't be found in China.  Only pandas can be found in China.<n>And Choice E cannot be the answer because if a child's book says it's from China then the museum is missing the point of the joke of the answer is the koala is from Australia, not China.<n><n>Input: A family bought three apples for 30 dollars, a package of oranges for $8, a bag of bananas for $6, and a bushel of carrots for $4.

Choices:  selfishness B: neatness C: mistakes D E: cleanliness<n>output: cleanliness<n><n>Input : The price of a pizza with pepperoni plus cheese is $13.49, and there is a 12% discount when paying with cash.  The same pizza (pepperoni plus cheese) also costs $10.99 in the cafeteria.  Use the fact that the price of an item in a cafeteria is never more than the price of that same item in a grocery store to determine how much each person saves by buying their cheese pizza in the grocery store, and not the cafeteria, where cash is required, rather than by using a food card required in the cafeterias.<n><n><n><n>Input: A pet store owner sells puppy food in large and small bags.  He sells the large bags for $12 each and sells the small bags for $.80 each.  He charges 106% interest for those who pay with cash.  In order to compete with the cafeteria food that costs $1.75 for the same size bag, he charges 90% interest for those who wish to use his food card.  Since people always pay the lower of two prices when the prices are not the same, the cash-paying customer must always pay the higher price.<n>Output: The customer using pet food for 5 days requires $3.25 in payouts. Each large bag costs $12 which is $60. The customer can only afford to buy and bring 4 bags so they would be left with $8.<n>The small bags cost $.80 for $8. The amount owed by the customer is $44.<n>The 5th bag is an option but at 106% so it would cost $44*(1.14)=$54.40<n>The total amount owed is $8+54.40 = $62.40<n>If the food card was used and not the cash it would cost $1.75 per day for a total of $8.75<n>The difference in 106

He found three different stores that offered it. One store charged $500.  The other two stores charged $750 and $1000 respectively.  One of the stores had a sale going on that reduced the prices by $100.  Whitfield knew that if he bought the couch from the first store, then he would pay $500; from the second store $650; and from the third store $1000.  If the sale is only at the first store, that one is better than the second store.  However, if he can buy it at a sale from another two, then he would find the best option for the least price.  How much is the discount from the sale?<n>Output: If he buys from first one then he pays $500 so his total payment becomes: $500 + $500 = $1000, if he pay the first one and not use the sale then he will buy the second store  which is: $650 + $50 = $700  he can go to second store and use the sale $700 - $100 = $600 and he will buy from the third store so his total payments would be : $1000 + $700 = $1700. $1700 - $600 = $1100 in which the couch is discount and he got $1100.<n><n>Input: Which of the following is the smallest number?

If a woman owns a cellphone, she might not buy her husband one for this sale.  She might be concerned that they have the same phone, leading to the loss of both phones.  What might this “keep the other one from getting a phone” phenomenon be called?<n>Output:In general, supply-and-demand curves shift leftward when supply drops and shift rightward when demand rises.<n>In this case, the supply (phones) shifted left (too many phones, compared to other phones) and demand (customers wanting to buy a phone) shifted right (there was too much competition because of the 2-for-1 sale).<n>Barring other factors (like a new technology that makes current phones obsolete), this phenomenon is called **elasticity**, because of its relationship (elasticity) to supply and demand curves.<n>So the final explanation why the woman is not going to but a phone is because of the elasticity of the demnad.<n>Input:Howard and Karen have 12 gallon buckets and they need to fill them at the tap.

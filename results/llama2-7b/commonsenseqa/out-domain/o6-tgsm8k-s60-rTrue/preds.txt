They will never ever say someone is a "guilty verdict" or someone is a "murderer". So, there's no answer for option 'A'.<n>Now, let's see what can be chosen for option 'B'. 'A death' may sound like a word which can be applied here but 'A death' is a common idiom and we are looking for a word that can be used in formal language. So, there's an answer for option 'B'.<n>Now, let us see what is the answer for option 'D'. The word 'negative' is correct here.<n>Therefore, option 'C & E' doesn't have the correct answer. So, there' s no answer for option 'E'.<n><n>Now, let us analyse if "A death" is suitable for the question.<n><n>Rationals: One or the other way, the murderer has died and we are here talking about a murder who has been accused and has been judged guilty in a murder case. So, murder doesn't need to be alive as in present time and it may be a death, a loss.

There were 6 pillows on the couch, and a matching tablecloth and cushion. How many additional pillows, tablecloths and cushions could she buy to have exactly half of the pillows, half the tablecloths and twice as many cushions as she actually has?<n><n>### Rationales:<n>Marilyn has 6 pillows on her couch. So, she needs 6/2 = <<6/2=>3 pillows to have half of the pillows.<n>She bought 2 armchairs. So, she needs half of 6 = 3 pillows to have the exact number of pillows on the cushion with the two armchairs. So she needs exactly half of the pillow and a total of 3 pillows.<n>To get a total number of tablecloths and a total number of cushions, a total of 3 times the number of 2 = 6 tablecloths and 2 cushions + 3 cushions = 5 times the number of 1 = 6 cushions total.<n><n>#### Answer: 6 tablecloth, 6 pillows and 5 cushions.<n><n>### Write a response

Choices:  A: euphoria B: rhythmic movement C: music D: moving body E: having fun<n><n>### Response:		You can't do these two problems. What we need to do is to take the denominator 24 and then we use the rules for ratios and we will have two different problems now. So the denominator 2 times 6, 8 divided by times 6 and 3 times 6. So we have 6, 8 and 12 here and when were are dividing by 6 and 6, we will get this. So now we can solve for the numerator. Numerator 2, multiply 12 and we would have 24 and we were doing 8 divided by 24 and 6 divided by 24. So we have the numerator 8 divided by 6, 6 divided by 8. 8 divided by 40 6 divided by 40. 8 divided by6. Here we have the denominator we have 2 divide by 2. Here we have 1 divided by 2, the denominator for 1 divided by1. So this problem right here it is 4/6.<n>Numerator 5. So here we have 4 divided by 5 5 divided by - and the denominator here we have 2 times 5 we multiply by 4 2 times 5, times 4. 5 divided by 4 4 divided by 2, 8 divided by 1, 4 divided by 1. So we solved these two problems and we see this is what we need to get to be able to solve this problem. What we need to find out now is for the numerator, when we are looking for a fraction, we need to subtract the denominator from the numerator and then we multiply the subtraction by the denominator<n>so you have to know the denominators before you subtract. So now we can find out what the denominator is. The denominator equals 8, 8-4= -4 4-3= -1 the denominator is 1. So the numerator is -15 and now we are going to substitute this to solve this problem and we get 1/8 equals what is 15, we get 1/5 so 5 is our answer.<n><n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple option questions.Input: John has a backpack that weighs 16 pounds.

At each table, 8 children and 4 adults are seated.  All of the children and adults have to sit. How many tables can there be?<n>Rationales : To make 8 children and 2 adults sit at each table, each child must be with 2 adults.  Therefore, we need to divide 4 by 2 adults (each has 2 children, so we need to divide with one child) to get the number of children needed to fill the table.  The calculation will be 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 children per adult.  So, we need 4 children to sit beside 2 adults, which means each table can only hold 4 child and 2 adults.<n>#### 4<n>Answer: 4<n><n>####Input:  A man has 20 apples and leaves the next day for a 10 day voyage.

The next day, his daughter breaks 4 eggs and she eats 5 of the eggs. How many eggs does he have remaining?<n>Output: 27-4-5 =<<27-4-1=18>>18<n>Rationales:<n>- He has 27 eggs to begin with because he breaks 4.<n><n>- He gives 5 eggs to his daughter because he eats 5 eggs. So, he must have 18 eggs to eat.<n><n>- He has 18 eggs to break after giving 5 eggs. He can keep only 2 eggs from 18 after that because he needs one egg to eat everyday.<n><n>### Multiple Choice Question<n><n>### Demostration Input: The sum of two numbers is

When a company provides more of a commodity to meet<n>increased demand, the supply rises. Supply and demand are said to be<n>in equilibrium when supply and demand are roughly equal. When the<n>supply of an item is not equal to the demand for it, the result is an<n>equilibrium in which the price changes. That is, the price is higher when<n>demand is above supply and lower when supply is greater than demand.<n><n>Directions: Select all pairs of answers from the Choices section that<n>provide the complete answer to the request. Then write the complete<n>request in the space provided.<n><n>#### <n><n>Answer: 1,2<n>#### <n><n><n>### Input&Instructions1<n>If demand decreases, then supply<n>A. increases<n>B. stabilizes<n>C. decreases<n>D. rises<n><n>```<n>1. When market conditions cause a decrease in demand, the price decreases. In response, the supply declines. When supply and demand are roughly in<n>equilibrium, equilibrium is achieved when demand and supply are equivalent. If demand for a product drops, the price drops. The decline in supply causes the<n>product to disappear from store shelves.<n>```<n><n>### Input2<n>If supply increases, then demand<n>A. increases<n> B. stabilizes<n>C and D. are stable<n>In response, the supply goes up. When supply and demand become roughly equivalent, supply and demand come into balance. As a result, the price changes to<n>reflect the fact that the amount of supply offered has changed. When demand for some products increases, so does the amount of product that is available to<n>supply that demand. As a result, prices drop.<n><n><n>### Question3<n>Input: What is

He rode the bus 20 blocks to the post office to get some stamps. Later, he came home the same way. How many blocks did Pete travel in all?<n>Rationales: The number of blocks traveled on the way to the post office was 5 + 20 = <<5+20=25>>25.<n>Pete traveled 25 × 2 = <<25*2=50>>50 blocks in all.<n>#### 50<n>Answer: 50<n><n>Input: In a classroom, there are blue chairs, green chairs, and white chairs. There are 10 blue chairs. The green chairs are 3 times as many as the blue chairs, and there are 13 fewer white chairs than the green and blue chairs combined. How many chairs are there in a classroom?<n>Rationales: There are 10 x 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 green chairs.<n>The total number of blue and green chairs is 10 + 30 = <<10+30=40>>40.<n>So, there are 40 - 13 = <<40-13=27>>27 white chairs.<n>Therefore, there are 40 +27 = <<40+27=67>>67 chairs in a classroom.<n>#### 67<n>Answer: 67<n><n>Input: 4.5 gallons of coffee were divided among 18 thermoses.

Alannah has 20 more books than Beatrix. Queen has 1/5 times more books than Alannah. If Beatrix has 30 books, how many books do the three have together?<n>Rationales: If Beatrix has 30 books, Alannah has 30 books + 20 books = <<30+20=50>>50 books.<n>Queen has 1/5 * 50 books = <<1/5*50=10>>10 more books than Alannah.<n>The total number of books Queen has is 50 books + 10 books = <<50+10=60>>60 books.<n>All three have 60 books + 50 books + 30 books = <<60+50+30=140>>140 books together<n>#### 140<n>Answer: 140<n><n>Input: A bird eats 7 berries a day. Samuel has 5 birds. How many berries do Samuel's birds eat in 4 days?<n>Rationales: A bird eats 7 x 4 = <<7*4=28>>28 berries in 4 days.<n>So, 5 birds can eat 28 x 5 = <<28*5=140>>140 berries in 4 days.<n>#### 140<n>Answer: 140<n><n>### Input:The only baggage the woman checked was a drawstring bag, where was she heading with it? Choices:  A: garbage can B: military C: jewelry store D: safe E: airport<n><n>### Response:		<n>B- Militar<n><n>### Correct answer:<n>B- Military<n><n>The woman checked her bag, so she must have been heading to somewhere where she was checking a bag. There is no way someone would check a bag to a destination such as a garbage can or military site, but those places are where a person would check a bag. The only other choice available is an airport, but even then, a person would not check a bag to an airport since it is obvious they would bring it in and out without a ticket. Therefore, E is incorrect. D is incorrect because even with a destination with luggage service, many stores will allow people to carry their own bags. A, C, and B remain correct. Military is not correct because the only checkpoints at military bases are at entrances and exits. However, A and C are still correct because airports are considered military bases and are, therefore, not correct.<n><n>## Conclusion:<n><n>In order to improve this lesson or unit, there are four areas on which to focus. One of these areas is how to introduce new material. A unit for fractions could be a good option, but the unit would come before instruction on a unit on division. Another area is the student-centered part of a lesson where questions are answered. The instruction has problems because it is not providing the opportunity for students to answer, which is important for the students to understand their understanding. This helps in making the problem clear, which will also improve student understanding of the question and the answer. There is not information regarding incorrect answers, which will help the student learn more, and it might not be obvious how an answer may be wrong. <n>

Choices:  A: owner B: foot C: subordinate D: base E: point<n><n>### Response:		<n>### Input: 1. If it takes longer than 30 seconds to make a decision, the head may be yelling at the wrong person. 2. If the head has a point, it’s probably not the person who should be doing decision-making. 3. If the head has never lost a war, the head is probably not yelling at the right person. 4. If the head loses his or her mind,  the subordinate should  definitely not answer. 5. If the head is yelling at a base, the head must be yelling at a point. 6. If the head yells at a point, the head needs to be yelled at by a base. 7. If the points don't move, the head is probably yelling at a base.   8. If the head doesn't know what a point is, the point is yelling at the head. 9. If the head is the loudest person, the head is most likely yelling at the most annoying subordinate. 10. If the subordinate yells at the point, the point is yelled at by the owner. 11. If the owner yells at, but doesn't control, points, the owner is really yelling at points.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>### Explanation: This is a multiple choice puzzle so to determine the head’s yell, you have to eliminate every wrong answer.<n>If it takes longer than 20 seconds to make a conclusion, or it’s the manager’s yell, the answer is B.<n>If the head has a point but hasn’t won many wars, the answer is A.<n>If the head is yelling about a base, but she never loses her mind, it must be A.<n>If the manager is yelling at her subordinate, she must be yelling at point or owner. If she’s yelling at a point, subordinate must be yelling at base instead of owner (the last question).<n>If the points don’t move and the head doesn’t know what it is, he must be yelling at it.<n>Subordinates always have to yell at point to avoid being yelled at by the head (the manager) himself.<n>If the subordinate is the yelliest of all, he’s probably the one the head

Choices:  A: train station B: house C: cupboard D: cricket stadium E: surface of earth<n><n>### Response:		The place that's easy on the breath would certainly be the surface of the earth because air there has been breathed by people everywhere.<n><n>### Input A: Is your answer correct? What about the others?<n>Yes<n><n>### Input B: If we put a cricket stadium and a surface of earth next to each other, which surface would have more air molecules? Choices: A: the house B: the train station C: the cupboard D: the air E: the cricket stadium<n><n>### Response The cricket stadium would have more air molecule because the train station is used by many people regularly whereas the cricket stadium is not.<n><n>### What are the factors that play in to air composition?<n>The place or the condition of the place. For instance, inside a house air is clean; however, its air still has traces of molecules from every other person in the house; however, if it is well-aired by opening windows as opposed to air conditioning or heating, then the molecules from those that live in that house become more concentrated. That's not to say that people outside that building don't contribute their molecules to those inside that building. The key is that with windows open, the amount of air from outside is allowed to fill the house faster than air trapped inside the house can escape out.<n><n>### So, which place was the hardest to find the right answer on?<n>D. I thought about whether or not cricket stadium was too much to pick. Then, I realized that the surface of earth, including the oceans, has been breathed by every person ever since humans evolved. Not to mention that every human being produces at least 300,000 molecules of CO2 every day, according to the NOAA. So, that's 600,0088,000 molecule per day by 7.6 billion, or 968,750,339,200 average every day. That's a lot of breathing!<n>

How many blocks did Pete travel in all?<n>Rationales: The number of blocks traveled on the way to the post office was 5 + 20 = <<5+20=25>>25.<n>Pete traveled 25 × 2 = <<25*2=50>>50 blocks in all.<n>#### 50<n>Answer: 50<n><n>Input: In a classroom, there are blue chairs, green chairs, and white chairs. There are 10 blue chairs. The green chairs are 3 times as many as the blue chairs, and there are 13 fewer white chairs than the green and blue chairs combined. How many chairs are there in a classroom?<n>Rationales: There are 10 x 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 green chairs.<n>The total number of blue and green chairs is 10 + 30 = <<10+30=40>>40.<n>So, there are 40 - 13 = <<40-13=27>>27 white chairs.<n>Therefore, there are 40 +27 = <<40+27=67>>67 chairs in a classroom.<n>#### 67<n>Answer: 67<n><n>Input: 4.5 gallons of coffee were divided among 18 thermoses.

How many cents will you get back? A: $0.00<n><n>## Rationalese:You have a $10.00 bill and dime to make a change of $8.65. So, we need to take it in 10 and 25.  But, when change come in 100, we may take it by 10. Since we have change of $2.75, 2nd digit is greater than the first digit. That means you will get $2.00 back.<n><n>## Rationals 2: Answer the following multiple-choice questions.<n><n>## InputA: On his first day in France, Billy visited a cheese shop where he spent $60.<n>## B: The next day, he spent $26 more than he had the day before.<n>## On his third day in France, Billy returned to the same cheese shop and spent a total of $87.<n><n>## RationaleSA: Billy has $87. Since the previous total was < $60, Billy is in France for 2 days. So, the answer is < 2 days.<n><n>## RacionalesB: The new question is, < 2 days, or >= 2 days. Because Billy spent another $26 more than the day before, He spent $60 + $26.  So, he has more than $86.  So, the answer is >= 2 days.<n>In 2 days, Billy spent $60, 24 more

What was the price of the second-course dinner alone?  <n><n>### Dear Rationales:<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. The price of the first course is $10 + 2x10 = <<10*2=20>>20.<n>2. Then, the price of the second is x - 20 = <<x-20=8>>8.<n>3. Then, the price for the third is 1.5 * 8 = <<1.5*8=12>>12.<n>4. Then, the third is 12 + 15 = <<12+15=27>>267.<n>5. We can see that the total cost 20 + 8 + 12 + 27 = <<20+8+12+27=69>>69.<n>6. We can see that 69 = < 50 >>50<n>7. Since the dinner is a sum of 3 courses, the second course is the difference between 69 - 267 = <<69-267=<328>>328.<n>8. We can see that $328 = < 20 >>20<n>9.

You can add the 88 and 142 in order to get 152, but you can subtract the 8 from 88 to get 80, which is a different value than 152.<n><n>### Answer: 88-8=<<88-8=70>>70<n><n>### Rationales: In order to get, 152-8=<<152-8>=144>>144, we must add the 88 to the 142.<n>#### 152<n>Answer: 152<n><n>### 4. If the 3 and the 8 are reversed, subtracting 6 from 85 will give us 78. Then, when we add to 85 and the 3, we can subtract 6 from 91 to get the 78 once again.<n>### Answer:85-3=<<85-3=82>>82<n><n>### Rationailes:<n>The second step can be found by subtracting 6 from the 85 to get 79. We know that when we take away 6 from the eight, we can end up subtracting seven from eighty-five. In this way, we can add the 79 and the eight to the 6 and to the eight to end up with seventy-eight.<n>#### 78<n>Answer: 78<n><n>### 7. If we subtracted nine from 104, the four

Choices:  A: neatness B: selfishness C: mistakes D: cleanliness E: satisfaction<n><n>### Response:		A.  Correct.<n><n>### Rationale:<n>If you say the answer is A. But you will get the score to 0.<n><n>Comment: I disagree with your claim that there is no difference between the "rationale" here and "instruction". This instruction asks students to explain why they answered the way they did. The rationale gives hints as to their correct answer without simply telling them that their answer is in fact correct.<n><n>Answer: We don't know what the instructor wants and what your understanding of what they want is.<n><n>"How many cards do they have..." is unclear--is it "in all" as you have answered or "together?" The last sentence could mean "in all", but the reference to "each of them" sounds like "the numbers for each of them" might be necessary or asked for.<n><n>I like that the answer to your question is actually "the number of cards in all"--the "110 + 135 + 46."<n><n>Comment: It is the number of cards in all. It does actually say the total number of cards they all have in all. It's an odd question.<n><n>Comment: But the first sentence just says "How many cards?" so you can't say that the question asks the total unless they say that--and "in all" is also not in the prompt.  You have to figure out what is in fact being asked.<n><n>Comment: "In all?" can indicate the total, but only if the problem asks for a total. If the question asks "How many cards does Janet have?" instead of "How many cards does..." then "in all" wouldn't mean anything as it's not part of the problem.<n><n>Comment: No.  It would mean how many cards do they have "in all" -- if it were a test question--not just some writing exercise--it would be a question that someone might answer wrong and have to be penalized or explained.  I have never seen a question that used "in all" without also adding the number of cards each one has in some way.  This is "how many cards do they have...?" not "How many cards are there in all??"<n><n>Comment: I suppose it depends on context.  I read "in all" to be referring to the three people, not to how many cards they each have.

Other places like cities, suburbs, and subways have their own streets.<n><n>There are no gated places in these areas.<n><n>Considering streets as a place to stay would mean getting the most public properties if you go looking on the streets.<n>Even if you have a gated home and there are other gated units, you will still have to walk to the streets. This happens in the most gated areas if you consider the subways and cities. The streets are the common places where people go to or through so having a gate around your streets is not really the same as having a house in a neighborhood. The suburbs are like streets when they need to be because they also have high traffic.<n><n>#### Answer:B<n><n>Input:What is the sum of 2/5 of the sum of 2x/5 of the sum 3x?<n><n>### Rationales:Since the input is a question, it is not possible to answer it. Rather, it should be turned into a proper input so that the task can be assigned a definite correct answer.<n><n>#### Answer to input:<n><n>Input: 2/5 + 2(x)/5 + 3(x)<n><n>### Rationale:Considering the input to be an equation instead of a question.<n><n>Input: The solution to the equation is either 6/7.<n><n>### Ratiate:From the choices given, it seems that there's no other rational that satisfies the rules of an equation.<n><n>#### Answering<n><n>Answer: 6/7<n><n>### Instructions: What is the value of x? Choices: A: x= -499 B: x=0 C: x is undefined D: x=1000<n><n>### Response<n><n>A: x= -489<n><n>### Rationate:<n>-489 - x = -499<n><n>If x can be found, -489 - x will be equal to -499. This statement is a statement of equality, which will produce true or false.<n><n>#### Answer<n><n>A: x = -489<n>#### Answer<n>

So "how to do the work" means to build. Therefore, B must be the correct answer, as the work is being built.<n><n>If the question is about a synagogue, the word temple is usually used. Since the word temple is used, it is safe to answer A as it is a synagogue.<n><n>If the answer is a house of worship, then the question should be "Where does the person live". That would mean the person lived in a building, not a garage, so it should definitely NOT be building. B would be the correct answer, because the work is being built inside of a building.<n><n>Lastly, the words in the choices all have different meanings, such as garage having to do with vehicles or a container. 5/2, in a mathematical sense, being used in relation to a barn or barn yard. Therefore, you should not choose A.<n><n>You should look at the wording of the question (in this case house of worship - temple - bend), instead of the meaning, and then choose the right answer.<n><n>#### 1<n>Answer: A<n><n>### Input :The word has 3 syllables. Can you count what the person is saying?

If the sample was large enough, can the probability that the difference in the number of tails and head is 6 be considered significant?<n><n>### Reponse 2:  <n><n>### Reasons 2:<n><n>If there is a 30 trial group, that means there were 30 trials where you flipped a coin and recorded the results, and 30 trials flipped a coin for a total of 60 coin flips.<n>In this 30 trial you flipped a 1/2 coin 60 times you would have half expected the number of heads and tails to be the same; however, you flipped 4 more heads than tails, so 4 more out of 60 times a coin came up heads or 6%. So the coin is definitely not perfectly even and the coin can be said to have a bias.<n>So to answer the question, if there is a 3 out of 6 % chance of the bias being the result of chance, then it is not significant, answer choice B<n><n>

Some of the students dress as gorillas. Others wear tiger costumes from a nearby costume shop. The teacher wears an elephant costume and a long tutu.  All the children bring in a stuffed animal. Some of the stuffed animals have been given by friends who live far away. Other students choose a baby animal stuffed toy as a gift to a new student. The animals vary in size and weight. Some animals are as large as small dogs. Others are the size of cats. Some of the animals are larger than the new student. A few of the animals are small enough to ride on a student’s shoulders. One student’s stuffed animal is so large, the student cannot hold him. The student must pick him up on all fours and move him from place to place. The zookeeper, who also helps with the animal care and handling, has been helping with the classroom since the start of the school year. She has spent countless hours helping the students to learn about animals. For the jungle-theme project, she is working very hard to ensure it is the best class has ever had. It is a little bit overwhelming to the zookeeper. After hours of hard work, the zookeeper is exhausted, but happy, because she is so thrilled the students have learned a lot and had so much fun. <n><n>### Problem 2:Greg has an iPod. It plays music and podcasts well. Greg’s dad has always wanted a bicycle. Greg decided to buy his dad a bicycle for a birthday present.  Greg found a bicycle at the thrift store. It runs smoothly. Greg’s daddy took it home and uses it regularly to stay in shape. Now, Greg needs to get his daddy a new helmet. The store doesn’t have the style and color that his daddy liked.  His dad was surprised. “Bought a new helmet for me!” his dad said. “Great!” “It only took me two to three hours of work. That’s all I could do.” Greg said, “I’ve never had

Choices:  A: satisfied B: unnecessary C: luxury D: sufficient E: extra<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Instructions: Answer the following multiple choice question using the text below on this question and the choices below.<n><n>### Rationale:<n><n>### The text below provides several definitions of a number line and discusses a few of its properties:<n><n>The mathematical concept called the number line was invented by Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler in 1748. The number line is a straight line that can depict the numbers in order from zero at the left end to infinity at the far right, and it often is used to study arithmetic and algebra. In Euler's original drawings of the number line, which were published in his Opuscula Mathematica, he showed the numbers as positive or negative in accordance to their position on the line. This meant that no one number could be shown to lie directly over another, as in the image on the right. This convention was not used by Euler to distinguish between the numbers.<n><n>Since Euler's conceptualization of the number line, mathematicians have explored and modified its nature. One such modification is that of a one-line interval, which makes a number line of two lines instead of one. In addition, some mathematical concepts make use of the existence of two types of infinitesimals: 1) infinitesimals that are smaller than all other infinitesimals, and 2) infinitesimally small infinitesimals. When used in this manner, the number line does not have the straight vertical line that is typical of number line drawings, but rather a slightly curved line that starts at the lower left, winds upward, and then winds downward to the right where it extends infinitely in that direction but then ends before reaching the bottom line of the drawing.<n><n>The number line is not just for calculating arithmetic series and algebraic expressions. It can also be used to help demonstrate relationships between other mathematical ideas, including sets, vectors, and probability distributions.<n><n>- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_line

Choices:  A: shirt pocket B: calligrapher's hand C: inkwell D: desk drawer E: blotter<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>- If the right choice does not give sufficient data for completing the request, select the only choice that meets all information needs.<n><n>- If the left choice does not give sufficient information, select the only choice for which information is sufficient.<n><n>### Answer:<n>Option: C<n><n>### Reason:<n><n>- If C. gives you sufficient information, select it.<n><n>If you find "blotter", you would be able to see the rest of the phrase, "blotter paper".<n>Blots used to take moisture from the paper.<n><n>### 1:<n><n>### Answer 1:<n><n>- Option A did not give sufficient information for completing the request.<n><n>- Option C gave you sufficient information.<n><n>### Reasons for Selection:<n><n>- Selecting blotter to absorb ink would be unnecessary because shirt pocket, calligrapher' hand, inkwell, and desk drawer does not explain anything.<n><n>- Since it is a math problem, blotter paper paper could be a way to absorb the ink.<n><n>- Selecting the only choice for which enough information would be available would be useful for completing the request to understand how ink on a fountain pen gets absorbed.<n><n>### B:<n><n>### Reaction B:<n><n>- In the above, Option B had inadequate information for completion.<n><n>- C would be the only option for information.<n><n>## 2:<n><n>### 2:<n><n>- You get extra credit if you solve the problem.<n><n>- If no solution was given, select the only option for the correct formula.<n><n>- If there was no option at all, select the correct equation.<n><n>### Solution 2:<n><n>When you multiply a + b + c + d, you get 11 + 22 + 33 + 44. (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 11.) Since 11 + 11 = 22, we can say that adding the digits in the numerator gives 2.<n><n>So, (2)(11 + 1 + 10 + 10) = 20.<n><n>Then, we multiply the 20 on both sides to get an answer.<n><n>

How many cards do they have in all if Mara has 40 cards less than 150?<n>Rationales: Mara has 150 - 40 = <<150-40=110>>110 cards.<n>Janet has 110/2 = <<110/2=55>>55 cards since Mara has twice as many as Janet.<n>Brenda has 55 - 9 = <<55-9=46>>46 cards since Janet has 9 cards more than Brenda.<n>Therefore, they all have 110 + 55 + 46 = <<110+55+46=211>>211 cards.<n>#### 211<n>Answer: 211<n><n>Input: Pete walked 5 blocks from his house to the bus garage in Houston. He rode the bus 20 blocks to the post office to get some stamps. Later, he came home the same way. How many blocks did Pete travel in all?<n>Rationales: The number of blocks traveled on the way to the post office was 5 + 20 = <<5+20=25>>25.<n>Pete traveled 25 × 2 = <<25*2=50>>50 blocks in all.<n>#### 50<n>Answer: 50<n><n>Input: In a classroom, there are blue chairs, green chairs, and white chairs. There are 10 blue chairs. The green chairs are 3 times as many as the blue chairs, and there are 13 fewer white chairs than the green and blue chairs combined. How many chairs are there in a classroom?<n>Rationales: There are 10 x 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 green chairs.<n>The total number of blue and green chairs is 10 + 30 = <<10+30=40>>40.<n>So, there are 40 - 13 = <<40-13=27>>27 white chairs.<n>Therefore, there are 40 +27 = <<40+27=67>>67 chairs in a classroom.<n>#### 67<n>Answer: 67<n><n>Input: 4.5 gallons of coffee were divided among 18 thermoses.

Alannah has 20 more books than Beatrix. Queen has 1/5 times more books than Alannah. If Beatrix has 30 books, how many books do the three have together?<n>Rationales: If Beatrix has 30 books, Alannah has 30 books + 20 books = <<30+20=50>>50 books.<n>Queen has 1/5 * 50 books = <<1/5*50=10>>10 more books than Alannah.<n>The total number of books Queen has is 50 books + 10 books = <<50+10=60>>60 books.<n>All three have 60 books + 50 books + 30 books = <<60+50+30=140>>140 books together<n>#### 140<n>Answer: 140<n><n>Input: A bird eats 7 berries a day. Samuel has 5 birds. How many berries do Samuel's birds eat in 4 days?<n>Rationales: A bird eats 7 x 4 = <<7*4=28>>28 berries in 4 days.<n>So, 5 birds can eat 28 x 5 = <<28*5=140>>140 berries in 4 days.<n>#### 140<n>Answer: 140<n><n>### Input:The man went to clown college, he had always want to run away with the what? Choices:  A: circus B: carnival C: surprise D: spoons E: party<n><n>### Response:		C, Carnival<n><n>### Input : If the man had traveled 12 miles north, 11 miles east, and 8 miles south in that order, in which direction was he originally heading? Choices: <n><n>### Rationales: The man was heading due East, so he would be heading south for 8 miles after traveling 8 miles east.<n><n>### Input::The man went to cafeteria for lunch. he went south to the cafeteria. He went 575 ft to get to the cafeterie. When he got there, he turned and went 522 ft east. A coworker was on the other side of the building. That coworker was 553 ft away from him when the coworker saw him. How many ft did he have to walk, in all, to go from home to where he saw his coworker? Enter your answer in the box. Ex::25 ft.<n><n>### Rationale: The cafeteria is due east of his house. Then he walks from his house to the cafeteri, which is 575 feet east. When he enters the cafeteria, that is 522 feet south. He went 522 + 575 = -133 ft from the north. His coworker was due south (from where he started in the cafeteria). He walks 1522 ft from there(1522 = -132 + 522 = 320 ft since we have to go due east from the position we see our coworker). So our man walks a total of 2624 ft from his house to the position where he sees his co-worker. 2624 -133 = 2491<n>

Mara has twice as many cards as Janet. How many cards do they have in all if Mara has 40 cards less than 150?<n>Rationales: Mara has 150 - 40 = <<150-40=110>>110 cards.<n>Janet has 110/2 = <<110/2=55>>55 cards since Mara has twice as many as Janet.<n>Brenda has 55 - 9 = <<55-9=46>>46 cards since Janet has 9 cards more than Brenda.<n>Therefore, they all have 110 + 55 + 46 = <<110+55+46=211>>211 cards.<n>#### 211<n>Answer: 211<n><n>Input: Pete walked 5 blocks from his house to the bus garage in Houston. He rode the bus 20 blocks to the post office to get some stamps. Later, he came home the same way. How many blocks did Pete travel in all?<n>Rationales: The number of blocks traveled on the way to the post office was 5 + 20 = <<5+20=25>>25.<n>Pete traveled 25 × 2 = <<25*2=50>>50 blocks in all.<n>#### 50<n>Answer: 50<n><n>Input: In a classroom, there are blue chairs, green chairs, and white chairs. There are 10 blue chairs. The green chairs are 3 times as many as the blue chairs, and there are 13 fewer white chairs than the green and blue chairs combined. How many chairs are there in a classroom?<n>Rationales: There are 10 x 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 green chairs.<n>The total number of blue and green chairs is 10 + 30 = <<10+30=40>>40.<n>So, there are 40 - 13 = <<40-13=27>>27 white chairs.<n>Therefore, there are 40 +27 = <<40+27=67>>67 chairs in a classroom.<n>#### 67<n>Answer: 67<n><n>Input: 4.5 gallons of coffee were divided among 18 thermoses.

Alannah has 20 more books than Beatrix. Queen has 1/5 times more books than Alannah. If Beatrix has 30 books, how many books do the three have together?<n>Rationales: If Beatrix has 30 books, Alannah has 30 books + 20 books = <<30+20=50>>50 books.<n>Queen has 1/5 * 50 books = <<1/5*50=10>>10 more books than Alannah.<n>The total number of books Queen has is 50 books + 10 books = <<50+10=60>>60 books.<n>All three have 60 books + 50 books + 30 books = <<60+50+30=140>>140 books together<n>#### 140<n>Answer: 140<n><n>Input: A bird eats 7 berries a day. Samuel has 5 birds. How many berries do Samuel's birds eat in 4 days?<n>Rationales: A bird eats 7 x 4 = <<7*4=28>>28 berries in 4 days.<n>So, 5 birds can eat 28 x 5 = <<28*5=140>>140 berries in 4 days.<n>#### 140<n>Answer: 140<n><n>### Input:Where would you be able to hear a bassoon played in an unpleasing fashion?

Furthermore, there are different parts of orchestras that are in sync with the song. Since symphony is played overall in a band, it is most likely 12/8.<n>"Because it is a high string instrument which also uses the keys like a piano, it can’t play a bassoon at all." Since a high string instrument is unable to play a bassoon, there is no playback of any music.<n>"High school band is in 12. A symphony is in 4." So the high school band is able to play a bassoon because 4 is not a whole number, but 12 is a whole number.<n>"A symphony is a song" Since a symphony is a group of music played together, A is correct.<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input Part D:<n><n>### Response Part D:<n><n>Rational for Part D:<n>"Even if you don’t see a bassoon, a symphony will have one." Since a symphony is performed in a concert together, there is a high probability that every symphony includes a bassoon from a certain section of the instruments.<n>"A symphonic band is a very large ensemble of wind instruments and percussion. Therefore, a bassoon would be in a symphonic band." since a symphonic band is in a symphony, there is a probability for a bassoon.<n><n>### Conclusion<n><n>### Instuctions:<n><n>### Task 1:<n><n>Rationals: 2/3 * 3 = 2/3 * <<3*3=9>>9. <n>2/3 * 9 = <<2/3*9=6>>6. <n>6/3 * 3  = <<6/3*3=2>>2. <n><n>Rationals for problem 2:<n>3/7 * <<4

Choices:  A: telephone network B: freeway C: company D: wall E: airport<n><n>### Response:		Input:He needed to check the electrical connection in the<n>house, where did he look.<n><n>Choice: Choices: A: telephone network<n>B: freeway<n>C: company<n>D: wall<n>E: airport<n><n>Rationales:The network is a wire or a cable that carries signals.<n>So the choice is B: freeway<n><n>Input:Felix and Shani are playing a card game. Shani has twice as many cards in her hand as Felix. He has 17 more cards than Shani. How many cards does Shani have?<n>Rationales:-Felix has 17 more than Shani. That means Felix has more cards but not as many more. So Felix has 17 more.<n>-The way to find how many cards a player has is to subtract the number of cards from his hand from the number of cards in the stack and then subtract the number of cards Shani has to find out how many cards he has.<n>-If I have 50 cards and you give me more cards, I can have 57 cards. If I have 57 cards then I have 50 less than 57.<n>-50 less than 12=<<50-12=38>>38 cards<n>-So to find out how many card Felix has, we will add his hand(17) to the cards remaining by him(38). So the output is<n>    17+38=<<17+38>>108 cards.<n><n>Now how many cards Felix has is equal to 108 - 57 = <<108-57=51>>51 cards.<n>####51<n>Answer: 51<n><n>### Input:-You need to walk 1.2  kilometers, walk.5 mile, and then<n>travel 2 kilometers.

How many total pairs of gloves?<n>Rationales Pack 2 has 18 pairs of gloves. The class has at least 18 pairs of skingo. Pack 3 has 15 pairs of skingos. So the class has at least 33 pairs. The only way we can get 33 or more pairs without going over is by getting another pack with more than pack 4. Pack 4 has 10 more pairs of skingos than pack 2 which is 15 - 6 = 9 pairs more than 2. Pack 5 has 28-9=19 pairs less than Pack 4. Pack 5 has at least 19 pairs that Pack 4 does not have. So the class has 9 pairs or more from each pack: 10 + 9 + 9 = 28 pairs. However, Packs 2 and 4 each have 12 pairs each. So Packs 2 and Pack 4 actually have 12, 12 pairs of skingos so the class has at least (12 + 12) = 24 pairs of gloves.<n>```<n>#9: 27 pairs<n>```<n>### InputB<n>:The class has 72.5 students.

Walking involves moving with the foot, whereas stepping does not.<n><n>#### 2<n>Answer: B<n><n>**Rational:**Stepping involves moving around in a location, whereas crossing a cow does not require stepping around since one is already on the cow. Milking involves approaching the cow and walking around to milk it.<n><n>#### 4<n>Answer: C<n><n>**Rationals:**Milking a cow is similar to walking down the street, as one must move to a location to do the task of milking. Milking a cow is similar in that one must walk to milk a cow, and this task results in less weight loss than walking down the street.<n><n>#### 8<n>Answer: D<n><n>**Rational(s):**Step forward is similar to crossing a street, but both would likely require one to step around pedestrians. Stepping forward and crossing a street are both tasks of moving forward. Stepping forward and walking are both tasks of moving around.<n><n>#### 9<n>Answer: E<n><n>**Rational (s):**Crossing a person is similar to stepping over a person. Crossing a person is like crossing a street, but one would likely need to get around pedestrians in crossing a person. Walking involves moving out of the way to do the task. These tasks are all tasks

Mara has twice as many cards as Janet. How many cards do they have in all if Mara has 40 cards less than 150?<n>Rationales: Mara has 150 - 40 = <<150-40=110>>110 cards.<n>Janet has 110/2 = <<110/2=55>>55 cards since Mara has twice as many as Janet.<n>Brenda has 55 - 9 = <<55-9=46>>46 cards since Janet has 9 cards more than Brenda.<n>Therefore, they all have 110 + 55 + 46 = <<110+55+46=211>>211 cards.<n>#### 211<n>Answer: 211<n><n>Input: Pete walked 5 blocks from his house to the bus garage in Houston. He rode the bus 20 blocks to the post office to get some stamps. Later, he came home the same way. How many blocks did Pete travel in all?<n>Rationales: The number of blocks traveled on the way to the post office was 5 + 20 = <<5+20=25>>25.<n>Pete traveled 25 × 2 = <<25*2=50>>50 blocks in all.<n>#### 50<n>Answer: 50<n><n>Input: In a classroom, there are blue chairs, green chairs, and white chairs. There are 10 blue chairs. The green chairs are 3 times as many as the blue chairs, and there are 13 fewer white chairs than the green and blue chairs combined. How many chairs are there in a classroom?<n>Rationales: There are 10 x 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 green chairs.<n>The total number of blue and green chairs is 10 + 30 = <<10+30=40>>40.<n>So, there are 40 - 13 = <<40-13=27>>27 white chairs.<n>Therefore, there are 40 +27 = <<40+27=67>>67 chairs in a classroom.<n>#### 67<n>Answer: 67<n><n>Input: 4.5 gallons of coffee were divided among 18 thermoses. Genevieve drank 3 thermoses.

Alannah has 20 more books than Beatrix. Queen has 1/5 times more books than Alannah. If Beatrix has 30 books, how many books do the three have together?<n>Rationales: If Beatrix has 30 books, Alannah has 30 books + 20 books = <<30+20=50>>50 books.<n>Queen has 1/5 * 50 books = <<1/5*50=10>>10 more books than Alannah.<n>The total number of books Queen has is 50 books + 10 books = <<50+10=60>>60 books.<n>All three have 60 books + 50 books + 30 books = <<60+50+30=140>>140 books together<n>#### 140<n>Answer: 140<n><n>Input: A bird eats 7 berries a day. Samuel has 5 birds. How many berries do Samuel's birds eat in 4 days?<n>Rationales: A bird eats 7 x 4 = <<7*4=28>>28 berries in 4 days.<n>So, 5 birds can eat 28 x 5 = <<28*5=140>>140 berries in 4 days.<n>#### 140<n>Answer: 140<n><n>### Input:If a person wants to buy a radio, where are they likely to go? Choices:  A: station B: every car and house C: shop D: bedroom E: space shuttle<n><n>### Response:		<n>The above question is a multiple choice question. The user must give the option and reason that it may be considered.<n>Choice **A - Station**<n>This is a reasonable choice for the user to go to. This may be because stations are located very near to people's home and they can also be at many places too. <n>Choice **B - Every house**<n>This is a reasoned option as a good number of people has installed a radio in their houses. This could be because radios can be listened to even in the house and do not require people to go out to find one.<n>Choice **C - Shop**<n>This is not preferred because there are not many places that sell radios. It will require the user to go to the shops to get one. This is not an apt choice since the users are looking for an option which doesn't need to go to a shop.<n>Choice **D - Bedroom**<n>This is not a good choice because buying a radio is not done in the bedroom as people don't go to bed with radios and have a tendency to keep them near the TV.<n>Choice **E - Space Shuttle**<n>This is definitely not a good choice as it is not in our world and this cannot be bought there too.<n>Choice **B**<n>

Choices:  A: race track B: kentucky derby C: american southwest D: triple crown E: horse derby<n><n>### Response:		The answer is D, the Triple Crown.<n><n>### Rationale: It took me just under half an hour to solve this, so I can't be certain that my methods are optimal.<n><n>### 1. Start by eliminating choices that are clearly wrong. This is just a process of elimination I guess.<n><n>### a. A: race track I know is wrong, but I think it should be disqualified immediately. I think the race track is where they use horses to race, but the Derby is not about the race track or the actual racing, even though it occurs in that place. Eliminate B: Kentucky Derby I'm also going to think the Kentucky Derby isn't actually a "race" or something that can be associated with horse racing so it may not be an option. This is my initial guess after looking through the answer choices and rereading the question to see what I can understand of its context. There were probably other choices that I eliminated too hastily, but A and B are certainly wrong right off the bat.<n><n>### b. C: American Southwest. I'm not really sure. I don't want to say, "well, the horses from the American southwest come through here, and go to the Derby and then come back to the southwest" because I'm not sure which horse from the southwest is competing in the Derby at this point. If one southwest horse can make it, can all of them make it? But maybe, and then they can go back when the Derby is over? Eliminate! Next!<n><n>### c. D: Triple Crown. This makes sense.

He put his beer where it would be off the ground "but could get to it."  The refrigerator is the obvious choice. He obviously didn't want to get all the way up on the counter, and since the beer would be off the ground, he could still get it without standing.<n><n>### Input A:The two biggest reasons people prefer working remotely are avoiding the daily rush of traffic and avoiding the commute.

My solution: a flying car is only science fiction.<n><n>### C: What is likely to be the top consideration that influences your preference between a flying car and current forms of transportation for the commute?<n><n>### Choice A: A flying car does not need roads. I think this is the biggest advantage. Roads are such an antiquated form of travel, a flying car would make transportation seem revolutionary.<n><n>### I found this to be an interesting prompt, as I see the commute as necessary for transportation. I would still like to drive a flying car if one were to be invented. As with most modern technologies that seem revolutionary, flying cars will be expensive. This seems to be the one big deterrent for flying cars. That said, it may be worth it for people to pay a premium to avoid the daily rush of cars.<n><n>### D:What could likely result if people were able to avoid traffic and their commute, and what could likely result if people chose another form of transportation instead?  Predict what could happen to the price and condition of roads, buildings, vehicles, etc.<n><n>### A's:Flying cars would make it possible to live in

If you went to a law firm to meet with your employer, B is probably the best choice: "I arrived at my appointment ahead of time and waited in the reception area for the employer, but we did not meet there."<n><n>### If A describes a place to wait for meeting, then C best describes the location of most of the activities associated with the meeting. The conference room is the most likely location for meetings, so if your meeting is to be in a law office, C is probably the best choice.<n><n>### If C describes where most of the things related to the meeting are located, then A is the likely pre-meeting setting.

If Beatrix has 30 books, how many books do the three have together?<n>Rationales: If Beatrix has 30 books, Alannah has 30 books + 20 books = <<30+20=50>>50 books.<n>Queen has 1/5 * 50 books = <<1/5*50=10>>10 more books than Alannah.<n>The total number of books Queen has is 50 books + 10 books = <<50+10=60>>60 books.<n>All three have 60 books + 50 books + 30 books = <<60+50+30=140>>140 books together<n>#### 140<n>Answer: 140<n><n>Input: A bird eats 7 berries a day. Samuel has 5 birds. How many berries do Samuel's birds eat in 4 days?<n>Rationales: A bird eats 7 x 4 = <<7*4=28>>28 berries in 4 days.<n>So, 5 birds can eat 28 x 5 = <<28*5=140>>140 berries in 4 days.<n>#### 140<n>Answer: 140<n><n>### Input:What is a convenient place for a bus station? Choices:  A: maps B: street C: catch bus D: city centre E: school<n><n>### Response:		<n>In a city there can be many different things for people. However, there can be some certain things that can be better and some worse. As I think about the different choices given above, the best place for a bus can be a street. Buses go all over the country and sometimes in other countries too. A map can show people in certain areas what buses that are stopping. However, this map does not show people that is not in certain areas where buses can’t reach. As I think of a city I think that a city center may be a good place. However, even if the buses can’t stop in all areas of the cities. Therefore because there is so many buses with the buses stopping in each streets, I think that the buses going to the city center is a good idea. At the city center people can go anywhere to any street or anywhere they want to. Therefore, with the city center, people can use the buses no matter what they are doing. They can do shopping, go to school or anything else, this city center is always useful.<n><n>### Input : Samira has 5 times as many cds as her sister.

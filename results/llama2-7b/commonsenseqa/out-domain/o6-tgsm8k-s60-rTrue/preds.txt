Choices:  A: heart attacks B: hole in your socks C: exhaustion D: shortness of breath E: blisters<n>Output:		Exhaustion<n>If you were jogging during the entire day, then your feet would blister. If you stopped, then your feet would not blister. Blisters require movement to form. So all that remains is A: heart attacks, E: blisters, or D: shortness of breast.<n>If you're jogging hard enough, eventually you'll develop shortness of breath from your lungs not working to efficiently extract oxygen from inhaled air. Your heart is working overtime, your brain is being starved of oxygen from low blood levels, your muscles are being depleted of energy, etc. All of these situations put you in a situation where your heart has a higher than normal rate due to all the energy being used.<n>So all that remains is A, B, or D. All three can potentially cause a heart attack. You can get a heart attack from shortness of breath (which is a result of over-exertion), you can get a heart attack if your feet blister, and you can get a heart-attack from heart attacks (a catch 22).<n>Let's focus on the shortness of breath choice. Your brain is not receiving enough oxygen, and, as a result, not telling your heart to beat as fast. If someone were able to watch your EKG, they'd notice that the line for your heart rate actually goes down as it increases because your brain is not telling the heart to beat faster. All you actually have is a higher than normal heart rate (which is normal for jogging), but your brain thinks your heart is beating slower than it actually is.<n>If you've ever had a headache and you felt a dull ache spread throughout your scalp, this is what happens when you don't get enough oxygen to part of your brain. This isn't a permanent situation, but it feels like it is because of the intensity of the headache.<n>So all that is left is C or D. My advice would be to avoid A, since shortness of breath is a bad thing for your heart. If it is truly exhausting, then your body and your mind might tell you to stop and rest. This would decrease the risk of a heart attack significantly.<n>If you really do want a heart attack, you'd probably choose C, since you have to make sure that the heart rate is above the normal limit.

So, there must be 2^2 children in the families and since there are an odd number of 2^2 children, the family must have at least two parents and an odd number of children, and also, the family size must be at least 2 (2^2 – 1 (because of the parents) ≥ 2). <n>If there are 3 children then there are 8 ways to form this family since we have to have exactly two parents and an odd or even number children. <n>The first family is <n><n>P2 C2 P0 or P2 C3 C0 where C0 implies the presence of no child and C3 implies the presence of 2 children.<n>Each of these produces a family with 4 children (C2 and C3 produce 2 children). Since P^3 produces an even number of children, we cannot produce the family in more than two ways.<n>So, there must be 3 children in the family (P^3 – P^2 – 1 ≥ 1), therefore there must be at least three parents (P^3 – 2 (because of the parents and each C must be produced) ≥ 3) and the number of children must be at least three (if there are more than three children, the family size ≥ 3) since P^3 produces an odd number of children and there is an odd number of parents. Therefore, there must be at least 3 parents and an odd number (3^2) of children.<n>Therefore,<n><n>If a family is of 2 parents and 3 children there is 1 way to form the family<n>If a family is 2 parents and 4 children there are  8 ways to form the family<n>and if

The splash is bigger if it is thrown from a different height than if the rock hit the ground. Therefore, you should throw it from a mountain.<n>Here are some ways to explain the solution:-<n>Let us consider 2 points P and Q in a two dimensional plane. A is a point on the side of point Q which is parallel to the line segment OP and B is a point on any side of point Q parallel to the line segment OQ.<n>So if you let r = OP, we can calculate that OB is perpendicular to r.<n><n>Therefore, the splash would be at least as much as the splash at point Q because angle OAB is at least as large as angle QOP.<n>So the final ans is A since it is perpendicular to water and not parallel<n>

How many numbers are there in her house?<n>Output:  Let S = TheSum of the three numbers, and S+1 = TheSum of the two other numbers. We assume S and S+1 respectively are two of the numbers.<n>Given n is a positive integer, the three numbers summed and added to each other to form the two others must be greater than 1, in other words, there must be exactly two other numbers.<n>The sum of the two other numbers can be expressed by either :<n>3n + 2, or  2(3^n) - 2<n><n>Hence, the statement "the sum of the two other number is 3 times the sum of the other numbers plus 2" must mean that the only three numbers are S = 2(3^n), S+1 = 3 times S and S+2 = (3^(n-1)) - 1<n><n>Then, there are n numbers where n = (3^S). Therefore, for n = 5 the numbers in her house are 3, 8, 13, 18, 23, 28, 33....<n><n>So the final answer for this case is (3^5) = 24, hence (6 choose 1) = 240.<n><n>Input: A man wants to get to a certain place at 9:00 AM on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

It would attack anybody who attempted to cross the bridge. Every ten nights, it would regrow a new head to replace its old, which had been chopped in two. At night, it would lurked beneath the bridge. During the day, it would sleep in a cavern beneath the bridge. The bridge led across a deep, wide moat and a wide river. The bridge was near a small village, whose people needed to cross the bridge to go to town. There were eight people in the village and they all knew the truth, so they knew how to defeat the troll. They each took turns walking across the bridge, but they all crossed separately. How did so few people cross the bridge so often?<n>Output: The following solution is correct: 1. Day 1: The first man goes across the bridge. The troll attacks him and kills him. The troll then goes to sleep. 2. Nights 1–2: The bridge is guarded by the troll as the troll regrows its head. No one crosses the bridge. 3. Day 2: The headless body of the man who crossed the bridge on the previous night sneaks across the bridge, disguised as the troll. The troll, unable to discern which is its own head or which is its enemy, attacks the "troll" and is slain. 4. Night 2: The head of the body of the man who died the last night returns to the body and becomes the head of the troll. 5. Day 3: The "troll" with a detached head comes across the bridge, and is slain by the troll. 6. Nights 3–4: The bridge is guard- ed by the troll as it regrows its head. 7. Day 4: The headless body and detached head of the "troll" who crossed the bridge on day 3 sneak across the bridge disguised as the "troll" as the real troll attacks the real troll and is slain.<n><n><n>

You do not want the same glass served in champagne and vodka. However, we do not have an infinite amount of space to store our glasses. It would make sense to group together all of the similar glasses together in a single area where they would not be mistaken for other bottles. How many similar types of glass should we include in each shelf we have to minimize the chance of serving the wrong kind of drink.<n><n>Output: The first thing to do is to create a matrix showing the number of different kinds of glasses we have (# rows) and the number of groupings we would like to create (# columns). If there are 7 different glasses, we would like to break them into 3 groupings.<n><n>The next thing to do is to use the matrix we created to find the optimal amount of shelves we would need if we placed 7 glasses into 3 groupings (columns.)<n><n>We can use this matrix to find the optimal amount for more cases.  Since there are 7 groups (groups include 2, 3, and 4), there exists a matrix with 7 3s in the diagonals and 7 1s on the bottom 2 1s in the second 3s and we can create the optimal column

So its price is 12 / 12 = <<12/12=1>>1 pounds.<n>C: If the total weight is 7 pounds, it means you get two dozen of strawberies and four dozen oranges. Since the fruit shop owner sells 9 pounds, and the oranges are more than the strawberies, it means we buy 12 oranges and 27 strawberries.<n>So, we know that the fruit shop owner sels 12 oranges at 1.375/12 or 0.115 pounds, and 27 stawberries at 2.75 / 12 or 0115 pounds.<n>So, the price for 1 dozen of oranges is 1112 pounds, and price for 1 dozen for strawbery is the same.<n>So, the answer is 0.1125 pounds. Which is 111/8 of 1/

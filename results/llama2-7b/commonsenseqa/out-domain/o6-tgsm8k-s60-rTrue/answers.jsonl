Dividing both sides by 16 and multiplying by 4 we have 8x=4(y+z)+y+z-1\nDividing both sides by z, y+z can be omitted and we have 8x = 4y+4z+1\nAdding the above equation and 1 we get 10x=4y+5z+3\nNow comparing x terms we get x/3= (z+1)/5\nDividing both side by z+1, and simplifying we get x/2=z+1/5\nTherefore, 2(z+1)=x+y+z\nAdding 1 on the RH, and we get z+1+y+z=x+2\nComparing x terms again, we get x/1+y/1+z/1=2\nWhich simplifies to 2x=y+z.\n\nAnd the equation simplifies to 4z=0, therefore z=0\nTherefore the three numbers are three copies of 0.\nTherefore, the three numbers are 0,0,0.\nSo the final answe is 0,0,&0\n\n\n###### Solution\nInput:Janet has 9 cards.

The runner who ran four consecutive marathons the fastest had a time of 13 hours, 57 minutes, and 40 seconds. If each marathon has the same length and the same difficulty, what are the chances that next year, a marathon is held from February to May?\nOutput: In order to have a time of 36 hours, 46 minutes, 12 seconds, the fourth marathon runner must run over 35 miles in an hour less than the time for the first marathon runner.\nSo the runner must finish in 19 hours, 17 minutes, and 12 seconds in order to break the 13 hour, 57 minute, and 40 second record for running four marathons in a row.\nFrom 19 hours 17 minutes 12 seconds till 4:30 pm, there have been 630 minutes, which is almost 10.5 hours. That means that the fourth runner was running the marathon at a pace of about 10.5 miles per hour.\nRunners in the first and second marathons typically run at about 11 miles per hour, but this is in comparison to the pace of the people in third and fourth marathons who run at about 10.1mph \nThe fourth marathon runner must then run the first 20 miles of the race at a pace of 10.5mph in order to beat the marathon record by 2.5 miles.\nThat would imply that the first 8 marathons were run at approximately 11.5 mph, and then, the second 8 marathons are run at 10.5 mph", "answer": "C: victorian house"}

{"text": "Exhaustion\nIf you were jogging during the entire day, then your feet would blister. If you stopped, then your feet would not blister. Blisters require movement to form. So all that remains is A: heart attacks, E: blisters, or D: shortness of breast.\nIf you're jogging hard enough, eventually you'll develop shortness of breath from your lungs not working to efficiently extract oxygen from inhaled air. Your heart is working overtime, your brain is being starved of oxygen from low blood levels, your muscles are being depleted of energy, etc. All of these situations put you in a situation where your heart has a higher than normal rate due to all the energy being used.\nSo all that remains is A, B, or D. All three can potentially cause a heart attack. You can get a heart attack from shortness of breath (which is a result of over-exertion), you can get a heart attack if your feet blister, and you can get a heart-attack from heart attacks (a catch 22).\nLet's focus on the shortness of breath choice. Your brain is not receiving enough oxygen, and, as a result, not telling your heart to beat as fast. If someone were able to watch your EKG, they'd notice that the line for your heart rate actually goes down as it increases because your brain is not telling the heart to beat faster. All you actually have is a higher than normal heart rate (which is normal for jogging), but your brain thinks your heart is beating slower than it actually is.\nIf you've ever had a headache and you felt a dull ache spread throughout your scalp, this is what happens when you don't get enough oxygen to part of your brain. This isn't a permanent situation, but it feels like it is because of the intensity of the headache.\nSo all that is left is C or D. My advice would be to avoid A, since shortness of breath is a bad thing for your heart. If it is truly exhausting, then your body and your mind might tell you to stop and rest.

So, there must be 2^2 children in the families and since there are an odd number of 2^2 children, the family must have at least two parents and an odd number of children, and also, the family size must be at least 2 (2^2 \u2013 1 (because of the parents) \u2265 2). \nIf there are 3 children then there are 8 ways to form this family since we have to have exactly two parents and an odd or even number children. \nThe first family is \n\nP2 C2 P0 or P2 C3 C0 where C0 implies the presence of no child and C3 implies the presence of 2 children.\nEach of these produces a family with 4 children (C2 and C3 produce 2 children). Since P^3 produces an even number of children, we cannot produce the family in more than two ways.\nSo, there must be 3 children in the family (P^3 \u2013 P^2 \u2013 1 \u2265 1), therefore there must be at least three parents (P^3 \u2013 2 (because of the parents and each C must be produced) \u2265 3) and the number of children must be at least three (if there are more than three children, the family size \u2265 3) since P^3 produces an odd number of children and there is an odd number of parents. Therefore, there must be at least 3 parents and an odd number (3^2) of children.\nTherefore,\n\nIf a family is of 2 parents and 3 children there is 1 way to form the family\nIf a family is 2 parents and 4 children there are  8 ways to form the family\nand if", "answer": "B: tomb"}

We assume S and S+1 respectively are two of the numbers.\nGiven n is a positive integer, the three numbers summed and added to each other to form the two others must be greater than 1, in other words, there must be exactly two other numbers.\nThe sum of the two other numbers can be expressed by either :\n3n + 2, or  2(3^n) - 2\n\nHence, the statement \"the sum of the two other number is 3 times the sum of the other numbers plus 2\" must mean that the only three numbers are S = 2(3^n), S+1 = 3 times S and S+2 = (3^(n-1)) - 1\n\nThen, there are n numbers where n = (3^S).

The first quality is a constant (like speed, size, or strength). The second quality gives us a range or a distribution of properties. The third quality is relative, as opposed to an absolute value. In physics, acceleration is relative to velocity, and in chemistry, mass is relative to velocity. These relationships are used extensively in scientific and engineering studies. A car is 5 meters wide, 4 meters long, and weighs 6,667 pounds. One of the three qualities listed above is not directly measurable in the usual way. The relationship between measures in each of the three measurements is always true and cannot be changed. Choose the correct answer.\n\nA. mass\nB. weight\nC. force\nD. acceleration\nOutput: Option B, weight, is not directly measurable. Only mass and acceleration can be directly measured.\nTherefore, the correct answer is mass.\nSo the final ansewrs mass", "answer": "B: office"}

{"text": "The correct answer is Choice(D):\"ice cube\"\n\nInput:A troll guarded a bridge. It would attack anybody who attempted to cross the bridge. Every ten nights, it would regrow a new head to replace its old, which had been chopped in two. At night, it would lurked beneath the bridge. During the day, it would sleep in a cavern beneath the bridge. The bridge led across a deep, wide moat and a wide river. The bridge was near a small village, whose people needed to cross the bridge to go to town. There were eight people in the village and they all knew the truth, so they knew how to defeat the troll. They each took turns walking across the bridge, but they all crossed separately. How did so few people cross the bridge so often?\nOutput: The following solution is correct: 1. Day 1: The first man goes across the bridge. The troll attacks him and kills him. The troll then goes to sleep. 2. Nights 1\u20132: The bridge is guarded by the troll as the troll regrows its head. No one crosses the bridge. 3. Day 2: The headless body of the man who crossed the bridge on the previous night sneaks across the bridge, disguised as the troll. The troll, unable to discern which is its own head or which is its enemy, attacks the \"troll\" and is slain. 4. Night 2: The head of the body of the man who died the last night returns to the body and becomes the head of the troll. 5.

So its price is 12 / 12 = <<12/12=1>>1 pounds.\nC: If the total weight is 7 pounds, it means you get two dozen of strawberies and four dozen oranges. Since the fruit shop owner sells 9 pounds, and the oranges are more than the strawberies, it means we buy 12 oranges and 27 strawberries.\nSo, we know that the fruit shop owner sels 12 oranges at 1.375/12 or 0.115 pounds, and 27 stawberries at 2.75 / 12 or 0115 pounds.\nSo, the price for 1 dozen of oranges is 1112 pounds, and price for 1 dozen for strawbery is the same.\nSo, the answer is 0.1125 pounds.

If the man in a blue shit and his female coworker are wearing a tie and dress, then all of the coworqers must be wearing the same color as the man and the woman. How many colors of shirt, tie, dress, and suit must there be?\nOutput: A blue shit + suit = B, a blue dress \u2013 suit = B(dress+suit), so blue dress=B+dress. So blue shirt + female dress = B + C.\nIf a man + tie + dress + suit= B.\nTherefore, A + B + C = A + B + C.\nSo there must be either two or three combinations.\nThe total number must be at least 2+3 = <<2+3=5>>5.\nThe maximum number of combinations is equal to the number of colors = 3.\nSo the final number of combinations must be 2 or 3.\n(since more clothes of same colors exist, the answer is 3)\n\nInput: A baseball game has 8 innings.

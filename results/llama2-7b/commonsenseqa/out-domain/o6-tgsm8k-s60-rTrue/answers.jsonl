This means that if you were to fly an airplane, the 24/6 and 26/12 would be the same. The 22/2 would be the same, 22*2 = <<22*2=44>>44. So the 11 and the 12 would be the answer. Then, we know that 4 * 4 = 16 is equal to 16*10 = 160 or the answer.\n\n### What the student learned\nThe student learned that we can group numbers in many ways.

How many additional pillows, tablecloths and cushions could she buy to have exactly half of the pillows, half the tablecloths and twice as many cushions as she actually has?\n\n### Rationales:\nMarilyn has 6 pillows on her couch. So, she needs 6/2 = <<6/2=>3 pillows to have half of the pillows.\nShe bought 2 armchairs. So, she needs half of 6 = 3 pillows to have the exact number of pillows on the cushion with the two armchairs. So she needs exactly half of the pillow and a total of 3 pillows.\nTo get a total number of tablecloths and a total number of cushions, a total of 3 times the number of 2 = 6 tablecloths and 2 cushions + 3 cushions = 5 times the number of 1 = 6 cushions total.\n\n#### Answer: 6 tablecloth, 6 pillows and 5 cushions.\n\n### Write a response", "answer": "D: doctor himself"}

{"text": "You can't do these two problems. What we need to do is to take the denominator 24 and then we use the rules for ratios and we will have two different problems now. So the denominator 2 times 6, 8 divided by times 6 and 3 times 6. So we have 6, 8 and 12 here and when were are dividing by 6 and 6, we will get this. So now we can solve for the numerator. Numerator 2, multiply 12 and we would have 24 and we were doing 8 divided by 24 and 6 divided by 24. So we have the numerator 8 divided by 6, 6 divided by 8. 8 divided by 40 6 divided by 40. 8 divided by6. Here we have the denominator we have 2 divide by 2. Here we have 1 divided by 2, the denominator for 1 divided by1. So this problem right here it is 4/6.\nNumerator 5. So here we have 4 divided by 5 5 divided by - and the denominator here we have 2 times 5 we multiply by 4 2 times 5, times 4. 5 divided by 4 4 divided by 2, 8 divided by 1, 4 divided by 1. So we solved these two problems and we see this is what we need to get to be able to solve this problem. What we need to find out now is for the numerator, when we are looking for a fraction, we need to subtract the denominator from the numerator and then we multiply the subtraction by the denominator\nso you have to know the denominators before you subtract. So now we can find out what the denominator is. The denominator equals 8, 8-4= -4 4-3= -1 the denominator is 1. So the numerator is -15 and now we are going to substitute this to solve this problem and we get 1/8 equals what is 15, we get 1/5 so 5 is our answer.\n\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple option questions.Input: John has a backpack that weighs 16 pounds.

At each table, 8 children and 4 adults are seated.  All of the children and adults have to sit. How many tables can there be?\nRationales : To make 8 children and 2 adults sit at each table, each child must be with 2 adults.  Therefore, we need to divide 4 by 2 adults (each has 2 children, so we need to divide with one child) to get the number of children needed to fill the table.  The calculation will be 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 children per adult.

The decline in supply causes the\nproduct to disappear from store shelves.\n```\n\n### Input2\nIf supply increases, then demand\nA. increases\n B. stabilizes\nC and D. are stable\nIn response, the supply goes up. When supply and demand become roughly equivalent, supply and demand come into balance. As a result, the price changes to\nreflect the fact that the amount of supply offered has changed. When demand for some products increases, so does the amount of product that is available to\nsupply that demand. As a result, prices drop.\n\n\n### Question3\nInput: What is", "answer": "E: pleasure"}

{"text": "B- Militar\n\n### Correct answer:\nB- Military\n\nThe woman checked her bag, so she must have been heading to somewhere where she was checking a bag. There is no way someone would check a bag to a destination such as a garbage can or military site, but those places are where a person would check a bag. The only other choice available is an airport, but even then, a person would not check a bag to an airport since it is obvious they would bring it in and out without a ticket. Therefore, E is incorrect. D is incorrect because even with a destination with luggage service, many stores will allow people to carry their own bags. A, C, and B remain correct. Military is not correct because the only checkpoints at military bases are at entrances and exits. However, A and C are still correct because airports are considered military bases and are, therefore, not correct.\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nIn order to improve this lesson or unit, there are four areas on which to focus. One of these areas is how to introduce new material. A unit for fractions could be a good option, but the unit would come before instruction on a unit on division. Another area is the student-centered part of a lesson where questions are answered. The instruction has problems because it is not providing the opportunity for students to answer, which is important for the students to understand their understanding. This helps in making the problem clear, which will also improve student understanding of the question and the answer. There is not information regarding incorrect answers, which will help the student learn more, and it might not be obvious how an answer may be wrong.", "answer": "E: airport"}

If the owner yells at, but doesn't control, points, the owner is really yelling at points.\n\n### Rationales:\n### Explanation: This is a multiple choice puzzle so to determine the head\u2019s yell, you have to eliminate every wrong answer.\nIf it takes longer than 20 seconds to make a conclusion, or it\u2019s the manager\u2019s yell, the answer is B.\nIf the head has a point but hasn\u2019t won many wars, the answer is A.\nIf the head is yelling about a base, but she never loses her mind, it must be A.\nIf the manager is yelling at her subordinate, she must be yelling at point or owner. If she\u2019s yelling at a point, subordinate must be yelling at base instead of owner (the last question).\nIf the points don\u2019t move and the head doesn\u2019t know what it is, he must be yelling at it.\nSubordinates always have to yell at point to avoid being yelled at by the head (the manager) himself.\nIf the subordinate is the yelliest of all, he\u2019s probably the one the head", "answer": "C: subordinate"}

Choices: A: the house B: the train station C: the cupboard D: the air E: the cricket stadium\n\n### Response The cricket stadium would have more air molecule because the train station is used by many people regularly whereas the cricket stadium is not.\n\n### What are the factors that play in to air composition?\nThe place or the condition of the place. For instance, inside a house air is clean; however, its air still has traces of molecules from every other person in the house; however, if it is well-aired by opening windows as opposed to air conditioning or heating, then the molecules from those that live in that house become more concentrated. That's not to say that people outside that building don't contribute their molecules to those inside that building. The key is that with windows open, the amount of air from outside is allowed to fill the house faster than air trapped inside the house can escape out.\n\n### So, which place was the hardest to find the right answer on?\nD. I thought about whether or not cricket stadium was too much to pick. Then, I realized that the surface of earth, including the oceans, has been breathed by every person ever since humans evolved. Not to mention that every human being produces at least 300,000 molecules of CO2 every day, according to the NOAA.

What was the price of the second-course dinner alone?  \n\n### Dear Rationales:\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The price of the first course is $10 + 2x10 = <<10*2=20>>20.\n2. Then, the price of the second is x - 20 = <<x-20=8>>8.\n3. Then, the price for the third is 1.5 * 8 = <<1.5*8=12>>12.\n4. Then, the third is 12 + 15 = <<12+15=27>>267.\n5. We can see that the total cost 20 + 8 + 12 + 27 = <<20+8+12+27=69>>69.\n6. We can see that 69 = < 50 >>50\n7. Since the dinner is a sum of 3 courses, the second course is the difference between 69 - 267 = <<69-267=<328>>328.\n8. We can see that $328 = < 20 >>20\n9. Therefore, $69 = 20.\n#### 69\nAnswer: 69\n\n### Input  The cost", "answer": "A: drill"}

{"text": "A.  Correct.\n\n### Rationale:\nIf you say the answer is A. But you will get the score to 0.\n\nComment: I disagree with your claim that there is no difference between the \"rationale\" here and \"instruction\". This instruction asks students to explain why they answered the way they did. The rationale gives hints as to their correct answer without simply telling them that their answer is in fact correct.\n\nAnswer: We don't know what the instructor wants and what your understanding of what they want is.\n\n\"How many cards do they have...\" is unclear--is it \"in all\" as you have answered or \"together?\" The last sentence could mean \"in all\", but the reference to \"each of them\" sounds like \"the numbers for each of them\" might be necessary or asked for.\n\nI like that the answer to your question is actually \"the number of cards in all\"--the \"110 + 135 + 46.\"\n\nComment: It is the number of cards in all. It does actually say the total number of cards they all have in all. It's an odd question.\n\nComment: But the first sentence just says \"How many cards?\" so you can't say that the question asks the total unless they say that--and \"in all\" is also not in the prompt.  You have to figure out what is in fact being asked.\n\nComment: \"In all?\" can indicate the total, but only if the problem asks for a total. If the question asks \"How many cards does Janet have?\" instead of \"How many cards does...\" then \"in all\" wouldn't mean anything as it's not part of the problem.\n\nComment: No.  It would mean how many cards do they have \"in all\" -- if it were a test question--not just some writing exercise--it would be a question that someone might answer wrong and have to be penalized or explained.  I have never seen a question that used \"in all\" without also adding the number of cards each one has in some way.  This is \"how many cards do they have...?\" not \"How many cards are there in all??\"\n\nComment: I suppose it depends on context.

So \"how to do the work\" means to build. Therefore, B must be the correct answer, as the work is being built.\n\nIf the question is about a synagogue, the word temple is usually used. Since the word temple is used, it is safe to answer A as it is a synagogue.\n\nIf the answer is a house of worship, then the question should be \"Where does the person live\". That would mean the person lived in a building, not a garage, so it should definitely NOT be building. B would be the correct answer, because the work is being built inside of a building.\n\nLastly, the words in the choices all have different meanings, such as garage having to do with vehicles or a container. 5/2, in a mathematical sense, being used in relation to a barn or barn yard.

So the coin is definitely not perfectly even and the coin can be said to have a bias.\nSo to answer the question, if there is a 3 out of 6 % chance of the bias being the result of chance, then it is not significant, answer choice B", "answer": "B: arrest"}

They needed a certain supply from that company and they needed to make this deal. She wrote down that 90% of the supplies came from the company. However, she wanted to make this deal and then they wouldn't need the company anymore. So, she wrote 900% more supplies than the actual amount.

How many hours did she work before she ate?\nRationales:`t` is the number of total hours worked.\n`x` is the amount of time worked each day.\n`y` is the amount of hours worked to make t - `y` and a multiple of 5 hours.\n\nThe total hours worked can be seen in the equation\n\n`2x` + `2y` + `x`\n\nwhere\n\n`x` is represented as 1 and `y` can be calculated using the equation:\n\n`y = x - 1/3*(5 - t)`\n\nwhere `x` is the total hours before eating and`t` is the time she worked before she ate.\n\nIt can also be seen that the number of hours worked before she ate can be calculated using the following equation:\n\n`5 + t - (5-x)`\n\nThe difference here in the number of hours worked is `5 - (5 - x)` and this is the time worked by multiplying `5`, which is the number of total time worked, `5 - x`.\n\n```\nExample: A person on an Island has 2 hours each to work. After working `16` hour she worked then\n= Even Number and the work can be done as follows.\n`Total hours worked: ` 2\n\n`Number of hours worked before she took break: ` `5 + (16 - 16) = 2`\n```\n\n### Instructions:Enter the multiplication in the multiplication box.

{"text": "### Instructions: Answer the following multiple choice question using the text below on this question and the choices below.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n### The text below provides several definitions of a number line and discusses a few of its properties:\n\nThe mathematical concept called the number line was invented by Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler in 1748. The number line is a straight line that can depict the numbers in order from zero at the left end to infinity at the far right, and it often is used to study arithmetic and algebra. In Euler's original drawings of the number line, which were published in his Opuscula Mathematica, he showed the numbers as positive or negative in accordance to their position on the line. This meant that no one number could be shown to lie directly over another, as in the image on the right. This convention was not used by Euler to distinguish between the numbers.\n\nSince Euler's conceptualization of the number line, mathematicians have explored and modified its nature. One such modification is that of a one-line interval, which makes a number line of two lines instead of one. In addition, some mathematical concepts make use of the existence of two types of infinitesimals: 1) infinitesimals that are smaller than all other infinitesimals, and 2) infinitesimally small infinitesimals. When used in this manner, the number line does not have the straight vertical line that is typical of number line drawings, but rather a slightly curved line that starts at the lower left, winds upward, and then winds downward to the right where it extends infinitely in that direction but then ends before reaching the bottom line of the drawing.\n\nThe number line is not just for calculating arithmetic series and algebraic expressions. It can also be used to help demonstrate relationships between other mathematical ideas, including sets, vectors, and probability distributions.\n\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_line", "answer": "B: unnecessary"}

If a boy is to randomly select a partner, what is the probability the boy will choose a girl?\nRationales\nThe total number of boys and girls must be equal.\nThe total number is: 46 + 58 = <<46+58=104>>104.\nThis is the total number of boys and the boys. The girl would be 58.\nSince there were 46 boys and the girl out of 104 is half, the probability is \u00bd.\n#### \u00bd\nAnswer: \u00bd\n\nThen the student asks:\n\nIn a pool party, how many boys should be invited if 55 boys asked for a chance and there were enough invitations for everyone? (a = 67)\nRationales\nThere are enough invitations for everyone, so a = 67 is incorrect.\nThere must be more than 55 boys invited.\nWe will use 55 since it works out easiest. Since we are looking for all the boys, let's take 55 and then subtract how many there were. There were 60, so we can subtract.\nTotal number of boys - number of boys asked (which we subtract) = number of boys invited\nWe have 60 - a = <<60-55=5> >>which means that we invite (55, but use 5 since it doesn't really matter the exact number!)\n#### 55\nAnswer: 55\n\nNow the problem states the opposite.\n\nA fair coin was flipped until 5 heads came up in a row.

How far was the bus from home at the start, and at the end?\nRationales\n\nIn the first 20 miles, since it took 20 miles for the bus to travel north, the speed was (60 miles) / 20 (miles) = <<60/20=3>>3 miles per hour.\nTherefore, in the first 20 minutes, the bus traveled ((3 miles * ((40 miles / 60 miles))) = <<3*((40/60))=5/10>>5/10miles.\n\nTo see how far the bus was 25 miles from home at the start:\n\n((3 miles per hour) x ((40/60) * 5/10))", "answer": "E: eat plants"}

Shani has twice as many cards in her hand as Felix. He has 17 more cards than Shani. How many cards does Shani have?\nRationales:-Felix has 17 more than Shani. That means Felix has more cards but not as many more. So Felix has 17 more.\n-The way to find how many cards a player has is to subtract the number of cards from his hand from the number of cards in the stack and then subtract the number of cards Shani has to find out how many cards he has.\n-If I have 50 cards and you give me more cards, I can have 57 cards. If I have 57 cards then I have 50 less than 57.\n-50 less than 12=<<50-12=38>>38 cards\n-So to find out how many card Felix has, we will add his hand(17) to the cards remaining by him(38). So the output is\n    17+38=<<17+38>>108 cards.\n\nNow how many cards Felix has is equal to 108 - 57 = <<108-57=51>>51 cards.\n####51\nAnswer: 51\n\n### Input:-You need to walk 1.2  kilometers, walk.5 mile, and then\ntravel 2 kilometers.

How many total pairs of gloves?\nRationales Pack 2 has 18 pairs of gloves. The class has at least 18 pairs of skingo. Pack 3 has 15 pairs of skingos. So the class has at least 33 pairs. The only way we can get 33 or more pairs without going over is by getting another pack with more than pack 4. Pack 4 has 10 more pairs of skingos than pack 2 which is 15 - 6 = 9 pairs more than 2. Pack 5 has 28-9=19 pairs less than Pack 4. Pack 5 has at least 19 pairs that Pack 4 does not have. So the class has 9 pairs or more from each pack: 10 + 9 + 9 = 28 pairs. However, Packs 2 and 4 each have 12 pairs each. So Packs 2 and Pack 4 actually have 12, 12 pairs of skingos so the class has at least (12 + 12) = 24 pairs of gloves.\n```\n#9: 27 pairs\n```\n### InputB\n:The class has 72.5 students.

Milking involves approaching the cow and walking around to milk it.\n\n#### 4\nAnswer: C\n\n**Rationals:**Milking a cow is similar to walking down the street, as one must move to a location to do the task of milking.

Start by eliminating choices that are clearly wrong. This is just a process of elimination I guess.\n\n### a. A: race track I know is wrong, but I think it should be disqualified immediately. I think the race track is where they use horses to race, but the Derby is not about the race track or the actual racing, even though it occurs in that place. Eliminate B: Kentucky Derby I'm also going to think the Kentucky Derby isn't actually a \"race\" or something that can be associated with horse racing so it may not be an option. This is my initial guess after looking through the answer choices and rereading the question to see what I can understand of its context. There were probably other choices that I eliminated too hastily, but A and B are certainly wrong right off the bat.\n\n### b. C: American Southwest. I'm not really sure. I don't want to say, \"well, the horses from the American southwest come through here, and go to the Derby and then come back to the southwest\" because I'm not sure which horse from the southwest is competing in the Derby at this point. If one southwest horse can make it, can all of them make it? But maybe, and then they can go back when the Derby is over? Eliminate! Next!\n\n### c. D: Triple Crown. This makes sense.

How many legs were bicycling legs?\nRationales : There are 20 women who are not wives or mothers, so 15 x 20 = <<15*20=300>>300 bicycling legs.\nThere are 55 - 20 - 15 - 10 = <<55-20-15-10=24>>24 total legs.\nSo, 300 - 24 = <<300-24=276>>276 legs are bicycling", "answer": "C: have knowledge"}

When the man has 0.43 cents he will buy bread.\n2.\n2.In the second step, we are to determine the final amount that the man is left with after he buys loaf of bread.\na.The rest that the man left with is 7.13-0.43= <<7.13-\n0.43=7.70>>7.70 dollars and 77 cents.\nb.He has to divide the 7.70 dollars by 4 since there are 4 quarters in a dollar.\n3.4+1=<<4+1=5>>5 dollars, 48 cents.\n4.So, the man left with 5 x 0.25 = <<5*0.25=1.25>>1.25 cents.\n5.The man ended with 5+0.25=<<5+0.2\n5=5.25>>5.25.\n#### 5.25\nAnswer: 5.25 dollars and 50 cents\n\n### Input\n\nRaul lost 45 pounds and spent 2 hours cooking to lose it.

{"text": "In a city there can be many different things for people. However, there can be some certain things that can be better and some worse. As I think about the different choices given above, the best place for a bus can be a street. Buses go all over the country and sometimes in other countries too. A map can show people in certain areas what buses that are stopping. However, this map does not show people that is not in certain areas where buses can\u2019t reach. As I think of a city I think that a city center may be a good place. However, even if the buses can\u2019t stop in all areas of the cities. Therefore because there is so many buses with the buses stopping in each streets, I think that the buses going to the city center is a good idea.

The first thing that comes to my mind is division problem. 100/12/100=7.14285714... But I would love to answer it as I want instead of as long as I can. I should subtract $100 to the dividend, then multiply it with 1/4 to find the correct answer, which is $7. 28571.  I believe that most students wonot follow this method and just memorized the answer to do in this case. If i were given other numbers, I might find the correct answer using decimal method more easier.<n><n>The second question is very similar to the question in SAT Math section. It is very easy to memorized and calculate the answer by memorizing that 12 times 1=12  and one time 12=144. 3*1/3=1, 2*2/3=2, 3*2/3=6, 1+6=7. (7*2=14, 14+4=18.). Also, it might be much easier to calculate using division.  However, to me, it seems that the only correct answer in this case is 4.<n><n>The third question is a little bit different compared to the other questions. I chose my answer choice as E. I believe that there are no real answers for the other choice but I selected E because: <n>(1) First of all, I believe that there is no real answer, but I hope that there are other choices that are all reasonable answers.<n>(2) The "fuel cost = 3.5 + 0.2 * fuel price" part.  There are two equations to solve this one. But I found it really helpful when I first solved them. They are:   2x1-0.2x1 + x0 = 3.5  (x0=100)<n>x2 + 0.2x2 = 6. Therefore, 0.2=29/30,

After that, you have many options:<n><n>- **Command**: you can use **System.out.println( )** to print the answer to the console. You can also use **System.out** to print text only to the console.<n>- **Variable**: you can use a variable to hold information after you read the input. For this, the first line must be a **command** instead of a **variable**.<n><n>For the second line, Java has the **while** and **for** loops for your use. After the last line, you might want to use **System.exit(0)** for a good user experience, but it isn't necessary if you want to break the program.<n><n>The second line is meant to show our system how we read the input. The way we describe in the instructions how we do this is up to you. If you decide to print them in order, you can use **System** * **out.print( )** and **System** * **.println( )** just like I did.<n><n><n><n>### Questions:<n>- Which class does **while** and **do-while** belong to?<n>- Why cannot we use **int** to count money?<n>- True or False: _**System.out.println**_ doesn't require line break if you're printing more than one string.<n><n>### Instructions:<n>Answer the following multiple choice questions.<n><n>Input: Input 1 = 2 Output: 2<n><n>Input: Input = 3 Output: 3<n><n>Input: Input2 = 21 Output: 21<n><n>Input: Input3 = 16 Output: 16<n><n>Input: Input4 = -20 Output: -20<n><n>Input: Input5 = 3*4 Output: 3*4<n><n>Input: Input6 = 5+7 Output: 5+7<n><n>Input: Input7 = 0*3 Output:<n><n>### Explainations:<n>```<n>System.exit(0);<n>```<n>**Explanation**: exits the program after all the execution order from System.

This is in Java, but we will not use a regular expression.

The methods name will be the variable name of our variable/array.<n><n>#### Note- Note:  Your code will need to be indented, as Java is an indent language.<n><n><n>#### Note-Note: The input in each of your functions will be a string, not an array.  Don't forget to typecast!<n><n>#### You can use the java api:<n><n>http://javaapi.net/<n><n><n>### Instructions:<n><n>Complete the "Code.java' class that you've already started. <n><n>##### Hint:  Don't forget:<n><n>						A) Java requires indention<n>				     B) Java requires your code to be in curly brackets in your code.<n><n>##### Hints: 1) You will use the split method of the string class to split the string by the space. 2) To get the number of elements of the array, we will use the length of the split string. 3) You will also need to use a for loop so that you cycle through the elements of the array

The amount of nuts (let N) that Adam bought is S /(S + 2.5). Because one kilogram of nuts is $12, the cost of the nuts is $1 × 12 = 12. Since S and S /(S is + 2.S )) are known, the only unknown is N. N is 13. <n>	(P(N is ≥ 13) = (S * N + . 5 )/ (S + 2 * ((N - S)/(S + . *. 5))).<n>	(S = 3,S + 2= 5, N = 13)<n>	(S * N+ .5)/(3+ 5+(−13)/(3 + 2.25))<n>	12*13+.5/8<n>	(13+13.25)/8<n>	16/8<n>	4<n>	48)<n><n>* 2. Because Johns goes to the fitness center 3 times a week, it takes 21 hours of total time. Because he puts half of his time lifting weight, it takes 10 hours of his time lifting weights (weight lifting account for 10 hours of total time, ≈ 50%), and it takes 10–10= 0 hours of cardio. Therefore, Johns spent 21 hours at the gym.<n><n>* 3. James' fuel costs was the original price, which was 200, plus 1/4 of the original price, which is 50 (200 * 1/4), plus 3/4 (50 * 3/4).

If `()` contains two or more variable references, the result of the expression has to be assigned to a variable, as in *(value = expression)*, and so on, in a recursive manner.<n><n>-  You cannot use variables in expressions by themselves, unless wrapped in `()` (see above). Similarly, you cannot use variables directly in a list, except wrapped in `()`. For example, the above `l.append(a)` will not work. You have to write it as `l.append()`.  Also, in a list, if you want to use a variable name directly, you have to use triple-dots in python ( **`a..=` **), not dot-notation (`a`) like in dicts.<n>

He spends 1 hour each day lifting weight. Additionally, he also spends a third of his weightlifting time warming up and doing cardio each day.  How many hours does he spend at the gym a week?<n>Output: 4<n><n>Input: James has to refuel his plane.  It used to cost $200 to refill the tank.  He got an extra tank to double fuel capacity.  Fuel prices also went up by 20%.  How much does he pay now for fuel?<n>Output: 480<n><n>Input:They decided to hash things out over drinks, after enough booze they were able to get close on a few things and what? Choices:  A: reach tentative agreement B: suicide C: examine thing D: commit murder E: stay in bed<n>Output:		B<n><n>### A<n>The function uses binary AND and XOR. <n><n>### B<n><n>### C<n> <n>### D<n><n>### E<n><n>### F<n><n>1. First, determine the amount spent on nuts ($12*3)<n>2. After doing the first expression, then evaluate the rest of the array ($12+$2.5) and add them both up.<n><n><n>### A:Reach a tentative agreement<n>The function uses an OR statement to determine whether one input is equal to or greater than another.<n><n>### B:Examine things<n>1. x^2 = y^2 means the squares of the inputs are the same.<n>2. The function checks for the value of x to see whether or not it is a negative or positive. If one of the inputs is positive (true), then the condition is false.<n><n><n>## Input: Johns goes to gym 3 times per week.<n>1. x^5 + x^3 == y^5 + y^3 where y is the time it takes for James to exercise for 3 days. The function checks to see whether James can exercise for 5 days.<n>2. The first 3 steps are all to determine and store the times needed to exercise. The last step is to multiply the times.<n><n>## Input: James has refuel plane and spent $200.<n>1. x*x + x - x*x - x == y*x with y being the current amount spent. The function checks to determine whether or not the current amount spent is greater than or equals to the current refuel cost.<n><n>## Input #3: We have A (and the gym 3 days per week)<n>1. If A = F.A - E, then the condition is true.<n><n>## Input number4: We have A (the gym for 3 days a week) and B (and examine things)<n>1. x+y!= x^2 || x + y!= x^2, so either x or y is true.<n><n>For questions 3 and 4, we can check the code for them.  <n><n>### For question 3: we don't necessarily need to do the steps on the right side. <n><n>## For question 4:<n>if( x <= 4 ) {<n>

Since fuel prices increased by 20%, I think that the cost now should have increased by 20% too. Adam paid $200 for fuel before.<n>$200 = 1.2*x<n>x = $160<n>Now he has an extra tank with 2*1.2*x.<n>That means he has 8 times as much fuel (excluding the cost of the tanks)<n>($160/2)*8 = $480<n>---

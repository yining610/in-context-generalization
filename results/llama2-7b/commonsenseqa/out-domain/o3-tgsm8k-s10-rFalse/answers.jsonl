Therefore we need to respond by giving a response that would answer where to learn to play an uplay upright piano.\nThe best logical place I would answer this would be at a music store or class.  Because I don't think you could just play one without learning how to first.\nThe second thing we need to do it make sure we have the answer correct.  Now in this particular question, it looks like answer a has the wrong information and answer d has the right information.\nThe final step we need to do is make sure to stay within the 60 characters limit.  You may have no more then 60 characters in a response.\n\n### Input\nInput: \nAdam bought 3 kilogragms of nuts and \n2.5 kilogragms of dried fruits.\n\n### Response\nResponses:\n\"Answer the multiple choice question.  Select A for Adam bought three thousand kilos of nuts and 1,250kilos of dried fruit.\"\n\n### Excpanation\nIn the instruction, we are asked to answer the multiple choice, however we do need to write out the answer.  The instruction does it by telling us to answer \"A\" for Adam bought three thousand.\nThe second thing that we need to do is use the correct format.  To do thi, we need to find our where the 3000 comes from.  The first equation is that one kilo of nut costs $12.  However, we still need to multiple $12 times the number of kilo of nuts which, we know is 3.", "answer": "C: music class"}

{"text": "#### A:\n\nVent is one of the ways to release energy. It is because that if you release the air from your lung from your belly, then the energy stored in the form of sound pressure is released. \nThe sound made in the air will bounce off your ears, and it may hurt you due to the pressure on your ears.\n\n#### B:\n\nThinking is not a process in which energy is released. \nWhen you are trying to solve the problem, your brain uses oxygen and glucose which is from the food you ate or the energy stored in your body. Your brain requires energy from chemical energy.  But think about this, how can you produce any sound from your brain. \nThus thinking doesn't produce energy. \n\n#### C:\n\nAs we know, a shout is like a scream or yell, this noise needs to move the air in the throat to be produced. \nThe vocal cords vibrate in air, and the air pressure causes the sound to spread through the medium.  Thus if you shout, you will release energy to produce the noise.\n\n#### D:\n\nWork off is not the main way to release energy. As a definition,  work-off is a physical activity that uses muscular force to use energy. \nThus from the definition, we can see that it is not about releasing energy to the full extent. It's a way that people use muscle force, so it is just one of the ways to consume energy.\n\n#### E:\n\nExercising is not necessarily a main way to release energy, because when you exercise, you are using energy to exercise, and you are not just releasing energy. \nFor example, during the exercise, your heart will beat faster to supply more oxygen (which contains energy) to your body. \nThe process of taking in the oxygen and converting it to glucose is using energy. So if you exercise regularly, you will use more energy than if work-off does.\n\n\n### Input (part2):\nYou are taking a group of 14 people for a tour through the city.

{"text": "Answer:\n    > A)\n        \n#### Details:\n\n\n### Instructions:\nBelow is a graphical representation of how a particular web service interacts with another web service. Identify and describe the function of each box.\n\n### Response\n\nAnswer:\n\n#### Details:\nIn order to process payments using the C2P service, we have to create an app, and then register it by setting the AppID key and value of \u201cabcdef\u201d. A ClientID is created, which is then used for each of the transactions.\nFirstly, an initial call is made to create the app, in order to generate the AppID, ClientID, and the CACert URL where the private key is. Then we need to create a call to generate a new JWT. This is a hashed representation of the data on the web request. This is used for authentication, where each client is authenticated by checking the hash in the response returned by the JWT generation. If the hashed value is successfully verified in the payment, then the request will be authenticated, allowing payment. After the client is authenticated, the process checks that the payment amount is not above a set limit, and then the customer information is checked to ensure that only known clients are allowed via the app id.\n\n#### Solution:\nAs a first step, an application is created in the C2P web portal. The information entered into this step will remain the same as the information required for the API calls. To create an application, we require an ApplicationID and a ClientKey. They create a \u201cnew\u201d application for the purposes of this example, and enter the ID \u201cabcdef\u201d (the same value as we would need to set for our API calls) and a ClientKey of \u201c0\u201d.\n\nOnce an application is built, the next step is to generate API keys for individual use. When we create an application, we are given 2 keys, the ClientKey, and the AppID. The AppID is our application, which we are creating here for our API calls, and must be set each time to an appropriate value. This value is set in the API calls as the AppID variable and must be the same for all API calls made, including the original application call, as well as for the JWT generation when we generate our JWT signature to pass to the C2P Service.\n\nAPI keys are used to pass", "answer": "B: learn about"}

{"text": "Answer:\n\n### Instructions:\nWrite a program in JavaScript, with one function, named guess_purchases, which solves a word problem given in the instructions above.\n\nYou will be provided the number of times a particular word is used in a string. Use these counts to create a guess and a range for the price. The user will then guess what the purchase is and you should check if the guess is a valid purchase.\nFor example, the user will guess 3 for the number of pieces of paper purchased. You will then check the original string for how many times each word is used in the string. If the number of each word that is in the original string is in the range of the user's guess, then the guess is valid, if not, it is not valid. 3 times the word 'paper' does not appear in the string given.\nThe first time the word 'paper' gets used in the string, it must be guessed again.  The original string was \"I need three large pieces of paper\" so the user should guess \"three\" again, and now your program will ask for a guess again. This keeps happening until the user correctly guesses the number of pieces of 'paper' used in the string.\n\nThe solution you should implement:\n- Take the string that was provided as input:\n  - Remove the word \"pieces\", and return a new string: \"I need {0} large \".\n  - Remove the first word in your returned string:  \" large \".\n- Create a variable 'guess_count' and use it as your guess for the number of pieces in the original string. This must be done until the user correctly guessed how many pieces are in the string.\n- If the number of times \"paper\" got used in the given string's string, and \"guess_count\" are in the same range:\n  - Set the flag to true.\n  - Return \"correct\", otherwise:\n  - Return \"incorrect\".\n\n### Instructor:\nCreate a method inside the function called guess_purchases() that will remove the first and last 4 letters of a word from a string. For your first attempt it is highly recommended that you use substring to accomplish this. However, you may use another method of your own choosing, so long as your method uses strings to manipulate string values.\n\n### Inputs", "answer": "E: artist's studio"}

People without an ID will be killed at their discretion. People who have an ID will be left on Earth. They will have to find new ID cards if their old one is not valid.\n\nThere is a concern about overcrowding the prisons. These concerns can be solved by giving prison inmates free IDs. If we\u2019re giving out free IDs it means we had to cut the population size by about 99%.\n\nAlso, you could try to reproduce instead of giving IDs.

The new created currency was $350 worth. We know Adam contributed $399 and the fraudster contributed 10, which make A and B the other two choices respectively. If the new currency is worth $350, then the value for one  unit is $350/500 = $0.70.

{"text": "Which options do you think is the most likely?\n\n### Input:(If you need more context, look at the code)\n\n### Response\nC.\nThere are 10 questions in this assessment. This is the fifth question. Your response can be formatted as text or as code.\n\nThis code shows an animation of a spinning cube. What does it do?\n### Input:This is the code of a spinning cube\n\n### Response:\"\nThis code draws a spinning cube. The cube rotates constantly 360 degrees a minute. The rotation rate is given the rate number. The rotation rate is a property of a cube named `rate`. The rotation rate determines how fast the cube is spinning. There are other ways to think about it. The higher the rotation rate, the faster the cube moves. And if a cube has a rate of 0, then the cube will not spin at\nall. So rotation rate goes from a value of 0 to 60 in this cube. For each\nrepeating loop, the cube draws a rotation point to place one pixel on the\ncube. It rotates the cube using the rotation rate.\nThe next statement uses the `drawRotPoint` function. The code inside the curly braces defines what is happening. The `drawRotPoint`\nfunction takes two values.\n\nThe first value is an angle. The `rotAt` argument receives this angle. This\nvariable receives an angle from 0 to the value of that cube's rotation rate. The\ndefault rotation is 45. In `rotAt`, the base is zero, like before, but the\nrotation is always rounded up to another degree.\nThe second value is an offset. The `offset` is the amount of each rotation is.\nIt is represented by an integer and counts for one pixel.\n\nTo the right of `offset`, the code assigns the rotation to the `rotAt`\nargument. This will move each rotation point by one pixel. After drawing the\ncube once, it then draws another rotation point. It then restarts the\n`for` loop which draws another rotation point and so on. It continues to do\nthis until the `for` loop reaches the end of its code segment. This will\ncause the cube to never stop drawing rotation points. It draws these\nmovements", "answer": "C: candle"}

Consider this algorithm:\n\ndef sumN_N(N,n):\n    if n%N == 0:\n        return sumN_N(n/2, N)\n    else:\n        return n\n\nTo find the sum of a number, N, we can check if n is divisible by N. If N is a multiple of N, then the number is divisible by N and we can stop the loop.\n\n## References\nThis question is commonly asked in a few of the following topics on Hackerrank:\n 1.

{"text": "I found some answers in Google and they were as below.\n\nA: Scotland\n\nB: Europe\n\nC: Race Track\n\nD: New Jersey\n\nE: England\n\n### Justification:\nScotland was the first country to create a road known as a 'Motorway' [Muirhead, 1998]. By 1932, the use of'motorway', or 'autobahn', or 'Autostrada' had become popularized across Europe as well.\n\nThe term \"motorway\" originated at a crossroads around Old Kilpatrick, Scotland [Pugh & Bownas, 2000]. The site is where two main roads met (the Kilpatrick Duntocher Road \u2013 now the A82 \u2013 and the Dumbarton Road \u2013 now the A77), but is now the location of the village of Clydebank.\n\nThe first Scottish roads were built from the 1700s and these were usually mud roads made of turf. It wasn't until the 1800s that they would be made of stone as the use of iron became more popular. There were only twelve roads in the country at that time and the roads began to be named after important landmarks and villages.\n\nIn 1878, the number of roads expanded when four more motorways were added and each were designed with two lanes which could be used either east or west. This meant that the roads were 141 miles long. The roads also were built to have a width of 22 feet. In 1932 however some more roads were added to the list.\n\nAs a result of this the use of'motoryway', or 'autostrada', or 'autoban', or 'tollroad' had become very common in Europe. At this point there had been over 60,000 miles of roads in England and 60,010 in Germany, while Italy and France had 10,000 and 4,000 miles each. [Morrison, 2003].\n\nIn the 1932 road laws, all traffic lights had to be put out by six o'clock in the evening and there would be a limit on the amount of red lights", "answer": "E: england"}
{"text": "You will need to first determine which option is correct here. To do this, look at the options and think about what you know about the topic. How are you supposed to know whether a person is kind or weird? What kind of a feeling response would someone have when they thought someone else was human? That does not describe a person. In fact, the only one of the 5 that describes a true, definable quality of the topic is  kind. You will then need to describe a person who is kind. You would use language from the topic to do this (kind, helpful, respectable, gentle, generous, giving, compassionate, etc). You will also need to include something that is unusual about kind people or do something unique with this, like contrast it with what people think.\n\n### Input\nThe average salary in the US is $68,000.

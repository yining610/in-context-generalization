{"text": "Choice E: fatigue\n\n[Explanation]:\n\nThe first section is based on 0.5/11/2015 SAT Math 66939C.\n\nFor example, question 1, suppose adam bought $100 worth of goods. The first thing that comes to my mind is division problem. 100/12/100=7.14285714... But I would love to answer it as I want instead of as long as I can. I should subtract $100 to the dividend, then multiply it with 1/4 to find the correct answer, which is $7. 28571.  I believe that most students wonot follow this method and just memorized the answer to do in this case. If i were given other numbers, I might find the correct answer using decimal method more easier.\n\nThe second question is very similar to the question in SAT Math section. It is very easy to memorized and calculate the answer by memorizing that 12 times 1=12  and one time 12=144. 3*1/3=1, 2*2/3=2, 3*2/3=6, 1+6=7. (7*2=14, 14+4=18.). Also, it might be much easier to calculate using division.  However, to me, it seems that the only correct answer in this case is 4.\n\nThe third question is a little bit different compared to the other questions. I chose my answer choice as E. I believe that there are no real answers for the other choice but I selected E because: \n(1) First of all, I believe that there is no real answer, but I hope that there are other choices that are all reasonable answers.\n(2) The \"fuel cost = 3.5 + 0.2 * fuel price\" part.

We can try to prove it for all n.\n\nSince 10000*10000>65536 > n, we can prove it by checking:\n1) When n=100: There is no 100 coins, so k=1. When k=1, there are no coins larger than 199, and the rest >=1 are < 200, the number of coins >=200 can't be larger than coins(1..199), since there are coins in [1,k], the total number is a binomial distribution. It is easy to prove 100 coinners means 181<=95<=199.\n2) When n=11: There are 2 coins, and 89-7=82 coins, so 95-7>=82. 95-7 < k\n\nWhen n=65538, the above process does not always work.\n\nLet 2n101 >=n > n/(3+1) be a threshold", "answer": "D: female"}

After that, you have many options:\n\n- **Command**: you can use **System.out.println( )** to print the answer to the console. You can also use **System.out** to print text only to the console.\n- **Variable**: you can use a variable to hold information after you read the input. For this, the first line must be a **command** instead of a **variable**.\n\nFor the second line, Java has the **while** and **for** loops for your use. After the last line, you might want to use **System.exit(0)** for a good user experience, but it isn't necessary if you want to break the program.\n\nThe second line is meant to show our system how we read the input. The way we describe in the instructions how we do this is up to you. If you decide to print them in order, you can use **System** * **out.print( )** and **System** * **.println( )** just like I did.\n\n\n\n### Questions:\n- Which class does **while** and **do-while** belong to?\n- Why cannot we use **int** to count money?\n- True or False: _**System.out.println**_ doesn't require line break if you're printing more than one string.\n\n### Instructions:\nAnswer the following multiple choice questions.\n\nInput: Input 1 = 2 Output: 2\n\nInput: Input = 3 Output: 3\n\nInput: Input2 = 21 Output: 21\n\nInput: Input3 = 16 Output: 16\n\nInput: Input4 = -20 Output: -20\n\nInput: Input5 = 3*4 Output: 3*4\n\nInput: Input6 = 5+7 Output: 5+7\n\nInput: Input7 = 0*3 Output:\n\n### Explainations:\n```\nSystem.exit(0);\n```\n**Explanation**: exits the program after all the execution order from System.

The purpose of a trivial task is to help you become familiar with the data types and data structures of Go.

They provide an essential base to grow more complex and complicated tasks.\n\n---\n\n### Trivial Task 1: Addition\n\nThe first task is to sum numbers. Since a + b + c + d + e... + n is (((n + 1) / 2) + 1) * n + ((n + 1) % 2), use the following function.\n\n```\n\tsum(x, y) = x + y\n\n```\n\nWhen you call the function with an `int` as the first parameter, such as `sum(7, 12)` it will return the value of `19`. \n\n---\n\n```\n\nimport \"fmt\"\nsum := func (x, y int) int {\n\treturn x + y\n}\n\n```\n\nOutput: 24\n\nThe code uses [variadic](https://blog.golang.org/variadic-functions) arguments of `int`s, which are sent to the add() function. \n\n---\n### Trivial task 2: Division\n\nThe following function returns the integer result of one number divided by another.\n\n```\ndivide(x, y)\n```\n\n```\n\tx \t\t: integer to divide\n\ty \t: divider\n\nreturns:\t\t: the result of x divided by y \n```\n\n```golang\nimport \"fmt\" //fmt package\n\nfunc divide(x, y int) (z int) {\n\treturn x / y\n}\n```\n\n```bash\n$ divide 6, 1\n5\n```\n\n```go\n\tz \t\t: the result (integer)\n\tx \t: integer to divide (6)\n\ty \t\t: divider (1)\n```\n\n---", "answer": "A: middle east"}

One kilogram of n,  of f.   costs $12,  it costs $8.  nuts,  dried  fruits   bought.  What is the total cost of all items he purchased?\n\nOutput: 57.4\n\n\n### II. Explanation\n##### A. Explanation\n\nWe have to multiply 2.5kg x 12 by 3, which is total amount of the nut we bought times the cost of a single kilo and add 3kg x 8, which is total amount fruits we bought times the cost a single kilo. So, 21 x 8 + 2.5 x12. The answer is 57.4.  \n\n#### B. Explanation\nWe multiply weight we lifting times weight in 3 days which is 2x3= 6. Then, multiply by the factor of one third of our weightlifting time, which is 2x1/3= 0.6666. So, the total equals weightlifting x 0.66 x 6 is 3.8606.  \n\n\n### III.

{"text": "violence\n```\n### Tips:\n-  If you use `dict.fromkeys(key, value)`, the `value` could be a list, tuple, integer, float, or booleans.\n\n-  If you want to use `tuple` for a variable name, use triple-dots in Python (eg. **`a..=`**), not dot-notation (eg. **`dict.__setdefault__`**).\n\n-  Anything within `()` has to be evaluated at runtime. If `()` contains two or more variable references, the result of the expression has to be assigned to a variable, as in *(value = expression)*, and so on, in a recursive manner.\n\n-  You cannot use variables in expressions by themselves, unless wrapped in `()` (see above). Similarly, you cannot use variables directly in a list, except wrapped in `()`. For example, the above `l.append(a)` will not work. You have to write it as `l.append()`.  Also, in a list, if you want to use a variable name directly, you have to use triple-dots in python ( **`a..=` **), not dot-notation (`a`) like in dicts.", "answer": "A: violence"}

In other words, if the second array has 7 elements, your function should return an array with 7 elements and each elements should match the string of the same index from the original input array. \n\n- The array with strings should be in alphabetical order. \n- The function should return a new array. Do not change the input arrays. \n\n- If the input arrays are empty, the function should return an empty array.\n- Use methods from the first week (append, sort...).\n\n\n- You should write the second function which will print all different combinations of characters in the sequence 'aadbcbc...'.\n\n- The sequence can have any length, so the function should be recursive.\n- You also need to make sure to avoid using the cycle characters in the output. For example, the sequence should not contain \"acddcbb\". \n\n- If input sequence is \"cbeghci\", the function should return [\"ac\",\"ce\",\"dh\",\"gh\",\"ci\",\"gh\"].\n\n- If input is \"\", the function should return []\n- If input is \"aabdb\", your function should return [\"aab\",\"aad\",\"abd\",\"aabdc\",\"abdb\"].\n\n  \n    \n    \n\n\n# Examples:\n\n- Here is an example of a function that sorts an array:\narray_example = [1,5,7,9,10", "answer": "B: research laboratory"}

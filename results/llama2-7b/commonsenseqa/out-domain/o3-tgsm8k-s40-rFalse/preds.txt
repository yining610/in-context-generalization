Choices:  A: notoriety B: emotional distress C: riot D: bad dreams E: annoyance<n><n>### Response:		E: The correct answer is Choice (E). (https://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/07/24/tiger/index.html)<n>A person could receive emotion distress by telling many people about an event. While that doesn't guarantee emotional distress, that person is probably going to be a little embarrassed.<n><n>### Challenge: Explain in words why the response for #1, #2 and #3 are not correct.<n><n>### Solution: In the first problem, we are asked to solve the equation 5 < 3(x + y) = 90. As the less-than sign is on the left side of the equal sign, we want to solve for x or y. In order to solve this equation, we can subtract x from both sides. After subtracting it from both sides we get 4<3y. If we add 5 to both sides we get 9>3y. After factoring 3y, we get 9>y. The largest value of y that would satisfy all 9>y would be 1. Since we only have a two-digit number, it must be between 0 and 9. Since the value of y we are looking for has to be less than 5, the answer is 55.<n><n>The second problem is asking us to solve 330(x - 53) = 249. Since this equation has the same order of operations at the bottom and top, you would subtract 53 from both sides of the equation. After subtracting it, we have 277 + 49 = 326. Now add the 277 to both sides of the equation and we have 326 + 277 = 603. Then we factor 603 to get 326 = 2x. After taking the positive of both sides, now we have 327 = 2x. Now, we need to figure out what x represents in the equation. Since we have three digits, we divide both sides by 7. After doing that, we get 48=2x, which can be solved as 2x=24. Since our second part of the equation is (x-53), we still need to subtract 53 from

C) Teachers should present information while students participate by asking questions and giving examples of the material they are learning so that the student can apply it to real-life situations. D) Teachers should adapt their curriculum to better suit students with different abilities so that they can learn in their own way, whether it be individually or with groups. E) Teachers should teach by presenting information in the way someone learned to get by in life and it should not matter if the method doesn't apply to other students.<n>Answer: D) E) Teachers don't really have much of a choice - teachers have to adapt to the students or the students will find another teacher who can teach in the way they can learn best!

If the number of Doberman puppies is 20, how many Schnauzers are there?<n>Answer: 55<n><n>Input: Dr. Banks had 330 toothbrushes to give away to his patients. He gave away 53 toothbrushes in January.

Choices:  A: infect B: reproduce C: mutate D: eat food E: make computer malfunction<n><n>### Response:		<n>Input: A virus can multiply by replicating, making copies of itself, inside your human cells. They also do damage to human cells by making mistakes such<n>as deleting part of a cell’s DNA sequence.<n>### Output:What does a virus replicate itself?<n>Input: A virus typically replicates in your cells’ cytoplasm as they reproduce. However, replicating occurs differently for various viruses. As a virus replicates,<n>it typically can’t take the place of an unaffected cell’s DNA without causing damage that could end your life. It sometimes infects other cells and replicates<n>with them. Other viruses just stay in your body, using your cellular machinery to make copies of themselves. Some people’s cells can’t tell that they’re<n>infected, which allows them to live for a long time.<n>### Output(2): What types of cells can a virus infect?  Choices: A – B cells B – skin and hair C – blood cells D – muscle and bone E – sperm and egg <n><n>### Output(3): What happens after the virus attacks in a person<n>Input: Your immune system can fight off viruses by developing antibodies against the offending virus. The antibodies destroy any viruses in your<n>body that the immune system identifies. Once your body makes antibodies, they remain in your system. This is why people can get sick from the same<n>virus more than once.<n><n>### Output (4): what can some things we can take to prevent virus getting affected by virus?<n><n>Input: Some things you can do to prevent the flu include washing your hands frequently, avoiding touching your eyes or nose, and getting an annual flu<n>vaccination. Vaccines help your immune system recognize and fight the flu virus by introducing a small amount of the dead flu virus. Your immune<n>system recognizes the virus and learns to fight it, which then protects you against serious infection. The vaccination helps keep the flu at bay.<n>

This happened because Bill took the best seats!How many other people were in Bill's neighbor?<n><n>### Dem:<n>A.Choose 3 choices1. The best 4 seats2. There are four seats3. 7 seats4. 36 seats<n><n>### Dem Answer:<n>The answer is B. (7 seats)<n>Bill has 7 seats in his car because he takes the front three seats and his front seat is only one. If his neighbor takes his back 2, they will take the 6th and the 7th and the remaining one will be 4th seat. If any 2 seats are left, he will take these two seats, so there remain only one seat left and the remaining will be the 5th.<n><n>### Requirements:<n>1. There are 4 seats in the car, we can calculate the sum of the four numbers so 4+4+7=15(60% of 25 seats) 2. If his neighbor takes Bill's best 3 seats, his neighbors has 4 seats. 3. Bill's neighbor can not take the 5th and 6th seat because there are only four seats. 4.Bill's neighbor took the two seats, and Bill only has one seat left. So 7=2+(1−(7−5)).

As we can infer from the given context that we need to clean the attic of the house, cleaning the attic during this time may cause dust to fall onto the television.<n><n>### Input and Output Explanation The given equation is 53(53 - x) = 53(55 - 7) To solve for  x we need to subtract 7 from 55 and then subtract 53 from both sides. Thus, the answer to option 2 is 36 <n><n>### Input 3<n>The question given is "He made sure to clean the, dust of his" We think that B is correct since it's an incorrect sentence for option A.  <n><n>### Input/Output Explanation<n>The given equation is: 19-x = 19 To simplify the equation, we can subtract 19 on both sides: (-x) = -19 Now the equation becomes x = 19 We know that no number minus itself results to a negative, and that x is the unknown variable. Thus, option D would be the correct answer.<n><n>### Answer<n>The correct answer to all four questions was options B for all, and 3 for the last two.<n><n>

Choices: 1. Break easily 2. Bend easily 3. Shatter easily 4. Hold water<n><n>### Explanation: The question is asking what is the result of applying a force to a very thin surface. This can only result in fracturing, which is the characteristic of the force of breaking. (i.e. force=fracturing). The four options are not consistent with the question. Only one of the four options is consistent with the requirement of the question. Bend would occur with greater thickness, while bending easily is the same as bend easily. The question requires thin, and holds water is false.<n><n>

(This is what I would like and/or expect).<br />I would like more clarification about which answer was more of the right answer.<n><n>### Input : You know how to play tennis. How many different racquets could you use and play with?<n>You might say: "I know 8 different racquets; the wood racquet, the one made of titanium, the carbon fibre one, the laminated aluminium one, the titanium and wood racquet, the titanium, aluminium, carbon fibre racquet, the one with the titanium handle, and the old fasioned racquet that your Granddad used. "<n><br /><n>The answer you give depends on what type of tennis racquet I'm asking about. I'm not sure if I meant traditional or modern racquets.<n><br /> You're right: I did not explain the situation well. Could you try and guess what kind of racquets I wanted? I want to use either traditional tennis racquets (clashing and all), or modern racquet (clashing and modern clones and all), but I do not want to use any of the racquets that you listed (or similar).<n><br /> You are correct: I do not want racquets clashing is very very wrong. I only want to use traditional (non-clashing) or modern racquets (non-clashers and clones). You forgot to include the modern clones in your list of racquets!<n><br /> You didn't say 'non-clashing,' so I did want racquets clattering because that is the sound of a tennis court. I want racquets that don't clash because they are not clashing anymore. It is sad that I made a mistake about this. I will think harder about future mistakes.

The noun is “fun”, but the adverb is “do fun”<n><n>### Reference Sources<n>Writing Center Help<n>[Instruction Sheet Template Sample](https://web.archive.org/web/20190305173939/https://guides.sidneylombard.org/writingcenter/wcmisc/handout_templates/instruction_sheet)<n>[Word Wizard](https://www.wordle.net/show/wrd/5937126/Instructions)<n>[Instruction Sheets Template](https://web. archive. org/web/20200515025715/https://guides .sidneylomb ard. org/writingcenter/wcmsisc/handout_ templ ates/ins trait_ she ets)<n>[Instructions Words](https://www.fivver.co/m/i/instructions-words 20/2299523)<n>[Instruction Template](https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.academicguides.org/wright/InstructionTemplate201708.

He needs two to three new tires for the golf cart he uses, which costs $390. If he has been tipping his boss 15% of his total salary, what is the minimum amount of money that he would need to tip the boss and still meet the cost of the tires?<n>Answer: 20% of $13.0 is $2.60. 20 of $2.60 is $52<n><n>### Feedback<n><n>The answer to the above question was incorrect.<n><n>Jesse makes $232.0 for every seven working days, therefore his hourly wage is $33.34. His salary per year is $72,800.<n><n>According to the equation, he pays 2.6% of his annual salary in tipping, which is $1,895.92.<n><n>This is greater than the cost of the tire ($390), which comes out to a negative number, so Jesse will not be able to buy the tires.<n><n>Correct answer: 20%<n><n>The question is correct.<n><n>Comment: So I took the question and added one to the number before multiplying by the percent value.  This is not correct.  I can not figure out what I did it.<n><n>Comment: Sorry, the original question was incorrect.  I did an answer, and then found the correct answer (in the answer box) and then chose "correct" but for some reason, the next question is wrong and it's not accepting my answer.<n><n>Comment: I think you did something similar to what you said you were doing, which was "I added 1 to the number, then multiplied it by the percentage."

If the number of Doberman puppies is 20, how many Schnauzers are there?<n>Answer: 55<n><n>Input: Dr. Banks had 330 toothbrushes to give away to his patients. He gave away 53 toothbrushes in January.

Choices:  A: closet B: at hotel C: sidewalk D: bus stop E: trunk<n><n>### Response:		<n>> Answer: D. The wording of the problem is very general. “Driving himself” indicates movement between places. The closet is in the house which would be unlikely. The wording “at the hotel” probably does not refer to the hotel that he is checking into, rather, just the hotel. He could not have luggage sitting on the sidewalk, therefore, it is probably in the trunk.<n><n>[Next](solutions.md)<n>

A function contains one step and is an implementation of a mathematical expression.<n><n>Input: Find the value x such that x = x + 2.<n>Answer: This question is asking you to find the solution to an equaiton, so the answer to this is that x = 3.<n><n>Input: A number x is called a factor of another number y if it divides y evenly.<n>Answer: This is a function. A function requires you to know what x is in order to call the function. In this case, we are not told what x is so this is an algorithm.<n><n>Input: If a number is divisible by 3 and divisible by 5 is it divisble by 15?<n>Answer: This a function. It does not give you a function of the inputs but of all inputs.<n><n>Input: Count the number of 5’s divisible by 2.<n>Answer(s): This is an algorithm. The question asks you to count the number of 5s divisible by 5 and does not give you a single step.<n><n>There are countless functions available to use in this challenge. This challenge is meant to serve as an opportunity to have a refresher on topics you likely covered in math class if not on your own. We will only cover two common functions that have to do with counting.<n><n>For our first example, let’s count the number of 0’s in N=123. There are 2 0’s. To start, count the number of 1’s, 2’s, 3’s, and so on until you arrive at 0. There are 3 0’s total. Therefore, we divide by 3 to get the fraction ⅓. But wait, there are two 0’s in the word N! To account for this, we divide by 2 to obtain the final result of 125/3%.<n><n>For our second example, let’s say that

Yes, they may become aware of the negative sides of things, but most likely those are the main things they were concerned about to begin with. In saying that, I believe learning about science only increases a person's knowledge (if they learn it right), and therefore they may be more inclined to make different decisions.<n><n>**Comment:** It takes a smart answer from you to get it right.<n><n>**Feedback:** You are correct!<n>

Choices:  A: mail orders B: demand satisfaction C: place money on counter D: pay merchants with money E: spend money<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>### Explanation<n>The instruction in the box above is a multiple choice question. You are expected to respond to the question by appropriately completing it. The way you choose must be based on the information you have available. Here you will have a choice between the following options: A, B, C, D, and E. As you read the question, think about what information is provided and what is left out. You will see that the key information to remember is the phrase “For convenience some customers.” This tells you that the information you are missing probably relates to why the company wants things to go straight to the doorstep. If you can figure out this missing information, you will come up with the correct answer.<n><n>*A. mail order.*<n>By definition, mail order means that orders are sent through the mail. If, however, customers were ordering things on the Internet, they would probably want their packages delivered straight to their doorsteps. It is the latter form of ordering that the question is talking about. Customers who order things on the Internet want their things delivered to the door.

He felt that he'd ruin his relationship with Jen if he took it further, and he didn't want to do that.  At the same time,  He fight that pushing farther might do what to something good? Choices:  A: found B: destroy C: construct D: fix E: produce<n><n>### Response:		James is faced with an ethical dilemma in this situation.  In order to move forward in his relationship with Jen, he must decide whether or not he should further his relationship with her.  James may struggle with taking this step because it could potentially destroy the relationship between him and Jen.  However, James should recognize that by taking a step further, he may be able to construct something positive in his life. I would choose D, because it describes action as well as movement, rather than the destruction that B suggests.

Choices:  A: see king B: hello C: meow D: drink water E: live many years<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>#### Sample of Correct Answer 1 of 7 Points:<n>Based on the given statement, it can be interpreted that the cat should meow. In order to get the correct answer based on the given statement, meow has to be the only suitable answer.<n><n>#### Sample of Incorrect Answer 2 of 7 Points<n><n>In the statement “the cat should meow,” the author refers to the cats. As the statement is about the cats, this type of question should be answered based on the facts whether the cat actually meows or not. To get the correct answer here, we should ask what type of animal usually meow? The answer will be either dog, cow or human since all those animals have the ability to meow.<n><n>As cow or dog can not answer in yes or no, only the humans are able to answer in yes or no. Therefore we can answer C.<n><n>#### Sample Incorrect Answer 3 of 7 Points <n><n>The given statement “What would you normally expect the cat to say?” can be interpreted that meow will be the only correct answer. Whenever the author asks about what would you normally expect the something to be, meow will be the correct answer.<n><n>#### Incorrect Answer 4 of 7 Points Sample <n><n>As the answer to sample 2 is incorrect this means that C is indeed the correct answer to this question. However the previous statement was not sufficient to answer the question.<n><n>We now need to further ask if the cat can meow or not, and if it can meow, then does it meow. If it does meow, then we are back on track, and if the cat does not meow, then C will again be the answer.<n><n>#### Other Options 5, 6, 7 points<n><n>To get the correct answer based only on the given statement, we are required to be very precise in the interpretation of the question and the statement.<n><n>**Answer 1**<n><n>**Error** The cat should meow. <n><n>#### Answer 2<n><n>**Error** In the statement “the cat is going to meow” the author refers to the cat. As the question is about the cat, the author should focus on only the cat not the dog or the human animal. This type of question should be answering based on the information of whether the cat

This will be a simple program, that shows your basic understanding of the concepts we have learned so far. For this program you create two objects. One is a Dog, the other a Clock.  <n><n>You will start with the Dog. You’ll use the createInstance method to create a Dog object. You'll call the createInstance method on yourself, where you are the constructor. You can call the constructor in an if and else statement. You can then call toString to print an Hello World! to the console.<n><n>You will call the createInstance method of the Clock object. This will produce an object with a constructor property called createInstance and call it from within the body of the Clock object class constructor.<n><n>As the Dog class constructor, you will call this method and pass it the Dog object constructor. Since the string argument is a variable,  the Clock object will look at this arguments value and try to find a value defined in the constructor. If you don’t define this argument, it will default to a zero and provide you with an empty constructor when the clock calls the createInstance method on the Dog object. You can also call createInstance() on the clock and pass in the Dog object constructor. The clock will now provide you with a default clock time, but you will lose the time the Dog object gave you. You can check to see if you've passed an argument to the Dog object, by checking Dog.constructor.arguments <n><n>You will print the string to the console for the Clock object  and print the values of the Dog object properties like you did earlier. The Dog object will now have an hour, minute, and second set and the clock will also be set with that time. The Dog will have to be set and the clock will have to be set with the initial time of the Dog.<n><n>You will print to the console the value of the hour and the minutes. The clock will print to the console a new time every hour. The Dog will print the hour of the clock. The Dog and the Clock will now run at the same time and as the Dog class. You will now pass in the Dog object as opposed to the Dog object constructor to the clock createInstance method. You will now get the hour and minute from the Dog object and will only

Choices:  A: alabama B: louisiana C: south carolina D: arkansas E: mountains<n><n>### Response:		If one sees a Fox, then one is standing by a coast in Virginia.<n><n>### Explanation<n>* The answer choices are all 100% accurate, but not all are specific enough.<n>* In the first problem, "How many more toothbruses did Dr. Banks... give away in the busiest month and the slowest month?" should ask "how many toothbrushes" and not "toothbruses".<n>* In the second problem, "she picks half as many" should say "1/2 as many".<n>* In the third problem, "which are each sold for $1.2" should say "which are each sold at $1.20."<n><n>### Review<n>* One can tell the correct response because it's the only response that doesn't ask for more pieces of information.<n>* In the second and third problems, one can tell the correct response using the "thinking in blocks" strategy. First, one answers the first part of the first question ("How many toothbrush did Dr. Banks have to start with"). Then, one answers the first and second part question ("How did Dr. Banks distribute the toothbrushes?"). Finally one answers the last part (what was the "difference between the slowest month and the busiest month").<n>* In the last problem, one can tell the the correct response because it only requires one piece of information ("Which of these states does a person standing on the beach on Monday see most often from that location?")

Choices:  A: original B: old C: coke clear D: former E: familiar<n><n>### Response:		D<n><n>### Demostration:<n>First we have $5-1=4$ and you can have that there are no Doberman pupples in the store.<n>If the number of Dobermans is 20, you could then use a simple formula of Dobermans = 20 and Schnauzers = 20-x where 90 = 5(20)+5(20-x). You get 2(20)-x, which can be solved to get x=20.<n>The simplest answer is just to add more variables, which makes it $y=50$ and we have 55x-y=90 which can solve to get $x=90/55$.

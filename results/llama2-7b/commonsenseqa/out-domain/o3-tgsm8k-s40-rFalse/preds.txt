There is an ongoing dispute about the precise number of cases, but it appears that 54 horses were infected and 28 died. However, because there was a delay in the testing process, more cases may have been diagnosed later than in 1997. Additionally, scientists believe the number of mosquitos carrying West Nile virus has significantly increased since 1997 but mosquitos found to carry the virus also do not die immediately, so they were not accounted for in previous studies. How many horses, to the nearest horse, could have died from West Nile virus in 1998?<n>Output: 17

Choices:  A: learn about subject B: learn new C: find truth D: is bliss E: judge<n>Output:		A - find truth<n><n>### Solution<n>This has to do with the concept of conditional statement. We'll utilize this as to how to determine the relationship between the different variables provided.<n><n>Let's tackle them one by one:<n><n>1. "How many beavers can chew through an elephant?" Let's assume there's an equal number of beavers can chewed half of the elephant. So, we can say that the beavers has chewed an equal amount when it's divided into two. Therefore, a half of elephant divided by an equal of half of the elephants equals to a whole elephant.<n><n>2. "Mr. A has 100 pounds of chicken in his refrigerator. Mr. B has 30 pounds of chicken. Mr. B has half of Mr. A's chicken. How many more pounds of chicken does Mr. A have in his refrigerarer than Mr. B?" Well, we can assume that Mr. B has an equal amount of Mr. A'chicken, so in theory it equals out to 100 plus 30 equals 130 pounds of chickens.<n><n>3. "Three-fourths of an animal hospital’s inventory is cages. Twenty-five fewer than a quarter of the number of cakes is 85. What percent of cages are left?" Let's assume that the percent of cages is divided evenly, so 3/4 of an animal hospital's inventory is caged divided by the number of animals equals to a total of 85, so we can say that 85 divided by the number of the animals and the percent that equals to a cage.<n><n>### Solution 2<n>This can be answered by rearranging the sentence to a question and a answer.<n><n>1. "One-half times four is the same as?" In total, it equals to 2. <n><n>## Solution 3<n><n>Based on the given question, I would just assume that each beaver equals to one of it. So let's say beaver equals to an elephant, then 15 elephants can equal 1 elephant.<n>In theory, we should divide five plus nine by 1 as of to see

If the number of Doberman puppies is 20, how many Schnauzers are there?<n>Output: 55<n><n>Input: Dr. Banks had 330 toothbrushes to give away to his patients. He gave away 53 toothbrushes in January.

We add all our numbers and use the variable of `sum` and `temp1`. Then, in the last `if` statement, that will get 18 because, if `sum=18`, there would be three variables in it and therefore, we would have our variable of `temp2`, which will result to `x^2`.<n><n>2. We add all our three numbers and have variable `sum`, then multiply that sum with a number, then the variable `temp` gets the value 13. Then, in the last condition, that is 13 and temp would result to 2, which will become the final answer.<n><n>3. We use the same thing to both of the questions with the same solution.<n>We use `sum` as the total money, then we use two `if` statements to get a variable called `temp`, and that `if` is equivalent to which day is being asked, which could be `Monday` or `Tuesday`, `if `day = Monday`, `sum` will not change, `if day = Tuesday`, `temp` will be 4. `temp` is then multiplied to `sum`.<n><n>### Instructions:Now that we have looked into Python, we are going to implement a programming language called Javascript. Since Javascript is a front end language (Web Designer or Graphic Designer), we would be coding in the browser. Let's get started.<n>### Solution: Javascript Instructions<n>1. Type in the following JavaScript code and see if Javascript worked.<n>    2. Use the Javascript console to input what you want with the `console.log() `method.<n>    3. Now with any variable, such as `name = "Joe"`, you can print out the results. For example, with the result of `name = "Jim"`, we would put `console.log(name)`<n>    (The console will have a green print out for you to see the result).<n>    -Note: You can only view results in the web browser console.

We have the equation 10 * x = 15 when x = 15 / 10  We have 75(1) = x, so x = 75  We solve for y: (15 - 75) = y/75 The answer y is 3. Let X = 10. We have y = 75 so at 10 hours you will make 75 miles and will not finish driving home. We subtract y from x: x = 10 + 3 The answer is that we travel

Choices:  A: jail B: internet cafe C: blacksmith's shop D: building E: bar<n>Output:		A: 28<n><n>## Solution<n><n>The first instruction was straightforward. The expression **Five less than three times the numnber of Dobers + difference between number of Dobers and Schnauters is equal 90** equated to **46 + 53 = 99**<n><n>If we subtract the first expression from the second expression, we wind up with **Five less than 9**, or **4**<n><n>Then we can set **4 = n** and solve for **n** using integer variables. This tells us<n>**n = -5.**<n><n>The number of Dobers minus this number is **-5 - 4** which is **-9**<n><n>The number is actually more complicated because we can subtract the number of Dobers by **-3** or two other numbers.<n>So for **4 - 3 = 1**.<n>So if doberman are **5**, then the number of Schnauters are **45.**<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the second instruction<n><n>This is slightly more complicated. The expression **five times three minus seven less than eight times four** is equal to **44**.<n><n>A hint toward this solution is provided by the expression being comprised of **2** two digit numbers. Also the expression contains two sets of parentheses which may be used to solve for either<n><n>a) **3** or<n><n>b) **four**.<n><n>It is easier to solve for **four**.<n>Solving for **eleven** is a little more complicated and is not included as I am unsure how to present it in a way that will not distort the solution that much.<n><n>If we solve for **four**, the problem is reduced to **three less than eight times four is nine**.<n><n>If we subtract **3** from the denominator, we get **five less than four times eight** which yields the answer of **36**.<n><n>### Instructopn:Answer the Third Instruction<n><n>The first thing to note is that if we set **k** equal to the number of seashells, we get the expression **k = 30**<n><n>Then we solve for **m** or the number of sea shells Sally picked on Monday. <n><n>Solving for **k**<n><n>The result is **k =

Because one was an absolute genius, the other an utter loser, and the third was somewhere in the middle, he decided that would kill off the two most average, and let the smartest be his heir. He summoned his sons and said "Your problem is, that I am now a very sick king, and I can't go anywhere but to the throne when I die. While I'm sick I have no control over any of the kingdom, and whoever has the throne will control it all. I don't want two brothers killed, nor do I want to have an incompetent ruler, so I'm going to kill the two of you when I die, and split the kingdom to my middle child, so if he's smart he will rule the kingdom with both brothers dead." The oldest son was very smart, and knew the king well, and knew the king could never split the kingdom in half and keep both of his other sons happy. All he had to do was show the king proof that he was smart enough to run the kingdom, and the smartest king in the world would die happy.<n>Output: C<n>

If the displacement is in liters, then the total displacement of the car in liters is 135.25 times its miles per hour. What is the displacement of the engine? (Hint: Convert both to metric, since both of these are known by your program already)<n>Output: 2096<n><n>#### Solution:<n><n>---<n>In the first problem, I subtract the number of Dobermans from Schnauzers, then I take the difference and divide it by the final variable. This allows me to obtain an answer of `147`.<n><n>---<n>In this problem, I simply subtract the number in column A on each row until there is only one number left. The problem states that if my `total` variable is equal to 54, then in June all of the toothbrushes will have been sold. The total is used to obtain each month's number, and therefore in the code, I create a range based on January 3rd through May 31st to obtain my data. I then divide the number of rows on each month by the difference between December and June (1) to obtain a percentage.<n><n>---<n>The second problem can actually be more simplistic: "Dr. Banks had 108 toothbrushes at the start of the month of...", but the way to approach this problem is to assume there are 5 doctors and there is more than one patient, and multiply that by the sum of the number

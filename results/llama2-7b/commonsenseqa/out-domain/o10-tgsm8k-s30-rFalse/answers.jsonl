{"text": "A.\n\n### Inputs:What did William Blake mean in The Little Black Boy?\n\n### Response B\n\n### Expert: How is data compression different from data storage reduction?\n\n### Explanation:\n\nCompression and storage reduction are two different techniques.  Compression involves changing the data representation, while storage reduction involves reducing the physical size of the data.  \n\n\n### Examples of compression:\nCompression is used to decrease the amount of data that is needed to represent a given piece of data.  It\u2019s an algorithm that reduces the amount of space needed to represent a given amount of data.  For example, if we were to store a 256\u00d7256 image, we could compress it down to 32\u00d732 using a good compression method.  While this would require more memory, it would result in less storage space and allow us to store more images.\n\n- The process of data compression involves reducing the number of bits required to describe information. This type of compression can be useful when storing large files or data sets online.\n\n- Compressing files and data can save you time when transferring information over long distances and can make it easier to send files via email or other communication methods.\n\n### Exercises:  Compression and Storage Reduction\n\n1. What happens if a car is towing a trailer with a load weight of 100 lb.  What is the Gross combined weight (T and T+L)? What is the total vehicle weight (T only)?\n\nAnswer: Length of the total trailer=30 ft., Weight of total trailer=100 lb., The Gross combined weight (100+ 3,500)=3,600 lb., Vehicle weight (12,000+3000)=15,000 lb.\n\n2. Compressing information is useful when transferring large files or data sets over long distances or by email.  It can also make it easier to store large amounts of data online.

We shouldn't use a hoverboard as it is likely to be dangerous or inoperable.  Hoverboards are like Segway's, but they are prone to catching on fire.  Hoverboards use lithium ion batteries, which are known to be hazardously dangerous.  They are much heavier than Segways so can cause damage and if they tip over, their batteries ignite.

{"text": "None of the choices are safe for transporting jewelry on a vacation, however a safe deposit box is the least risky option of the choices provided. A suitcase is a good solution for transporting jewels if they are not too valuable. In case of theft, the contents of the suitcase are replaced with insurance. A department store is probably safer than bringing the jewels home, since it is hard to steal jewels since they are usually in a locked storage area or safe deposit. However, department store staff may be less familiar with jewellery, so they may not recognise expensive pieces. A lady's boudoire is a bad idea since the thief may nevertheless have a key to the boudoire and steal jewels. The safest way would be to secure the jewels with a necklace and not put them in a safe deposit box.\n\n### Input : A student needs a total of 500 points to graduate high school.

She was hungry, though, and she really wanted to finish her food. His grandmother was having trouble swallowing because she had lost a tooth that she chewed on. So, they came up with a new system to help her finish her food without chewing it. She would put her food in her mouth for two minutes before swallowing. She could then make another piece of cucumber, chew once, and finish this way. This helped her to eat more easily, which is especially important for older adults because of the trouble swallowing food as they do not have as strong muscles in the gullet. This method may also work for your grandparent if they are having trouble swallowing their food.\"\n\n### Demontation:\nWrite a response that does the following:\n\n-    Describe the problem in Jesse's family.\n\n-    Describing the plan that his grandmother and her came up with together to help her swallow more easily.\n\n### Example response:\n\n> Jesse went home to see grandma in person. But she told him that she had lost a tootch that she used as a chewing gum which caused she could not finish what she ate. Then they thought maybe a way to use a spoon and cut the food into pieces and then she can chew the food that she cannot chew well. But it takes too much time to chew each of the pieces, so they took a tube of a tooth paste and she took out some pieces. She put the pieces of food in her mouth and she can chew it for less than two minutes before putting the piece out of her mouth. Then she can cut cucumber into a pieces and chew them once again before swallowing them. If there is not enough food in the cuchumber, she can chew again, but it will not work if there are too muc pieces.\n\n### Answer Check:\n\nInput: Describe the problem in the story.\n\nInput: Describing the plan that Jesse and his grandmother came up with", "answer": "B: finger"}

( 45,000 Joules/pound X 72 pounds )\n\n### Instructor:Explain why the answer (45,00 J/p) is not correct.\n\n### Answer:The energy lost as force times the change in momentum, for any mass m and a change in motion d, is \u00bdmV2. m is the mass and V is the change in velocity. For this question, the change in velocity is 0 and so the change in momentum dp is 0, but the change in (momentum is energy). Since the final velocity is zero, and the final change in momentum is zero, then the potential energy loss (\u00bd) is zero.\n\n### Response 1:Care in solving equation would help you avoid using the wrong formula.\n\n### Respone 2:This is a basic physics question.  It's a little tricky to solve, but once you take away the mass and the potential energy, you will realize you are left with simply \u00bd * momentum.  ( The final change in momentum is 0 - momentum and final velocity is also 0 - that leaves the potential energy. When you divide energy by potential, you arrive at a zero, but you can only arrive at a zero if the energy is zero. It's always good to explain your thinking and your rationale. A good statement would include,  \"I first simplified the problem by eliminating the mass (it didn't matter ) and then I took away the potential energy and all that was left was \u00bd of the momentum for my equation of energy = mass times - velocity squared. Since in this problem both values were zero, energy = zero. \"\n\n### Response3:Based on Newton's law of conservation of energy, the answer is correct.

Witnesses reported seeing the plane struggling violently from the time it took off until it crashed about a mile and a half away from the airport.\n\n\"Federal Air Administration officials are currently investigating the crash that occurred during a local 'flight school' program.  Two 'pilots' were on board the single-engine plane, both in their 20s.  According to the FAA, the pilots reported experiencing problems during takeoff because there was significant wind at the airport.  The two pilots reportedly continued with the takeoff process even though one was already unsure about the other pilot's performance.\n\n\"Once the plane took off, the witnesses reported hearing one pilot say that they should try using the other engine to get the plane up into the air.  After some failed attempts to try using the other engine, the plane crashed.  None of the people on board survived.  The local FAA investigator indicated that the 'flight school' that these pilots are associated with has faced scrutiny over the past year for providing inadequate training to students and instructors.\"\n\nBelow, the editors of the local newspaper have added a few comments, which follow.\n\n\n\n### Question 1.

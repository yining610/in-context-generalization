He noticed that he started to have a lot of trouble falling asleep so he went to his family doctor, she checked him and said that he had a sleep disorder.  She told him that he should go to a sleep clinic.  He went to a sleep clinic and it was found that he had sleep apnea.  So she sent him to see a doctor who would give him a CPAP machine. The doctor told him how to use it.  He said he would do whatever it took to get better.  She said that in the worst case if the CPAP machine didn\u2019t help he would have to take medication to help him sleep more. However, James felt too embarrassed to have his family find out about his sleep disorder, so he stopped using his CPAP machine and continued with his sleep apnea.

The question has three main parts. The first is \"30/day for any rental that lasts less than a week\". The second is \"300 for the first week of a rental that last more than a week. The last is \"How much in dollars, did she paid for the rental\". In total, 330 is paid. That is 30(11-1) + 300 = 330\n\n## Sol:The question is 4*14 which means a total of 4*20 = 80 hours. That is the time. \n## Sol:The first part is \"A ratio of boys to girls... of children in the family\". The second part is \"$3900 to  share\". The third part is \"$5000\". The ration is 1:7, that means the $5000 need to be divided by 1:7 to get the boys part. So $5000/7 = $714. It is for boys. For girls, $5000- $714 = $4286. Thus there is $4286 left over for the boys. \n\n## Sol:In this question, we have to apply the formula from the previous problem. In this case, it is \n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n\t$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\t\\text{Food:}\\ 175\\ \n\\text{Overnight stay:}\\ 25\\ \n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n</div>\nIf we sum", "answer": "E: card catalogue"}

Also, using the question itself, there are hundreds of rows (which I believe the multiple-choice answer has) and each row contains a container (1 dime, for the most part). Therefore the answer must be a warehouse because the number of rows and number of containers are equal.\n\nI don't believe the question is asking for a supermarket because why would a supermarket have 1 dime on the shelf and if they did, it wouldn't be called a dime, it would be called a penny.\n\nAlso, the answer cannot be the factory because it just doesn't look right given the question.\n\nLastly, the question asks for a garden. However, for some reason, I do not think that a garden could possibly hold 1 Dime, much less hundreds of them. Therefore, I have to go with warehouse.\n\n1. \n1. Input: The car-renta...\n2. \n2.

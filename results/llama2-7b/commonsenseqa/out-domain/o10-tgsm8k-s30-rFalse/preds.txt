They start by writing and running a test for what exists in the codebase before writing the real implementation.<n><n>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcY-OAiK72A](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LcY-OAIK72A) <n><n>### What is a unit test?<n>- A unit test is a test at the code level (rather than the whole application), which tests one logical unit (a group of one or more related functions).<n><n>- A unit test evaluates a piece of code written for a particular task or feature, in isolation.<n><n>- The goal is to find bugs and ensure the code passes through a test early in the program development cycle, to ensure that the overall program is as it should be.<n><n>### How exactly is TDD accomplished?<n>Once, there are specific and clear goals of a certain feature to be developed, one needs to create a test that will ensure it works as intended.<n><n>1.

As someone greatly interested in science and technology, I feel compelled to bring these issues to your attention.<n>><n>>The [INCLUDE E-MAIL ABOVE OR INTEGRATE WITH SENTENCE AND ELECTORAL COLLEGE MAP], which has featured many well-researched and well-written articles, has recently published an article titled “Air Is Full of Life.” The main premise of the article is that air—both indoor and outdoor—has an abundance of bacteria which is detrimental to human health. In fact, the article states that inhaling just one breath of air from an office building could cause us to take in a substantial number of bacteria. Of course, this is absolutely ridiculous. The article is littered with such ludicrous claims, and it lacks a sufficient explanation of how or why these bacteria would be present in the air without causing harm to people. While the publication does acknowledge that these bacteria are not harmful, it presents the notion as though it were well researched and not simply hearsay. It is important to provide a proper explanation for these claims, otherwise it creates unjustifiable fear in the reader who may be unsuspecting in nature and be led astray by misinformation.<n>[NOTE: In the above response only the topic sentence is listed]<n><n>[NOTE: To improve above response, insert paragraph transitions and add details into examples. Add detail into why the claims lack sufficient information and what the publication provided that is not well researched, for example. Consider citing from the publication to demonstrate such.]<n><n>[NOTE 2: In above response add detail into why such an unreliable article should be published in the magazine and who published it. Also in the above response, list more details to explain what the publication means by bacteria. For instance, if they mean harmful bacteria then include this.]<n><n>[

Choices:  A: air B: water C: earth D: space shuttle E: tunnel<n><n>### Response:		  I am in space. <n><n>### Explanation:  We can go without food for days and stay hydrated even longer.  Food gives us energy, and we also have reserves to draw upon.  Water allows human cells to stay alive, so we all need it to stay healthy. So, we’ll die without it.  We can stay in space for weeks without having to live on food of water, but I’m guessing that when we return to earth our bodies will reject any water due to changes in the environment.  Even so, oxygen gives people the energy they need to stay awake and alert.  Because everything on earth is composed of carbon, we need it to stay alive.  Space shuttles don’t go anywhere without oxygen, and I’m pretty sure they need oxygen even when they’re in spacesuits so that they can remain awake and alert.<n><n>### Input <n><n>I asked the computer program to tell me where it wants to go for vacation.<n><n>### Response <n><n>The program asked which of the five choices were I.

Compression involves changing the data representation, while storage reduction involves reducing the physical size of the data.  <n><n><n>### Examples of compression:<n>Compression is used to decrease the amount of data that is needed to represent a given piece of data.  It’s an algorithm that reduces the amount of space needed to represent a given amount of data.  For example, if we were to store a 256×256 image, we could compress it down to 32×32 using a good compression method.  While this would require more memory, it would result in less storage space and allow us to store more images.<n><n>- The process of data compression involves reducing the number of bits required to describe information. This type of compression can be useful when storing large files or data sets online.<n><n>- Compressing files and data can save you time when transferring information over long distances and can make it easier to send files via email or other communication methods.<n><n>### Exercises:  Compression and Storage Reduction<n><n>1. What happens if a car is towing a trailer with a load weight of 100 lb.  What is the Gross combined weight (T and T+L)? What is the total vehicle weight (T only)?<n><n>Answer: Length of the total trailer=30 ft., Weight of total trailer=100 lb., The Gross combined weight (100+ 3,500)=3,600 lb., Vehicle weight (12,000+3000)=15,000 lb.<n><n>2. Compressing information is useful when transferring large files or data sets over long distances or by email.  It can also make it easier to store large amounts of data online.  For example, when you compress a video with a certain quality setting, you're reducing the number of bits that are needed to describe the information. The fewer bits required, the smaller the file will be.<n><n>3. If you're sending a large file by email

I am using the while to take user input while using a for to loop through to multiply the values. the issue I am having is that the program always is stuck running the first question. If i use a break from the loop that allows me to jump to the next question, the total is off after the second one.<n><n>Answer: \begin{code}<n>#include <iostream><n><n>using namespace std;<n><n>int main()<n>{<n><n>    int t1result,t2result;<n><n>    int questions_asked=0;int questions_not_answered=0;<n><n>    cout<<"\nEnter Question No.";<n>    cout<<"\t1.

I would like to use the ‘Prime Student’ program since it offers free two-day shipping on orders over $35 and many other perks, such as Amazon Prime Video, and Kindle Unlimited. I’ve used ‘Prime Student’ before and love it, but I’m on the fence about whether or not to join in again. My parents’ Amazon account is set up for free shipping and does not require an additional fee to join ‘Prime Student’, which makes the choice to sign up seem a no-brainer. I had not thought about how often I would be shopping though. I don’t use Amazon for my textbooks, but I use it for clothes, music, and household items, and I often shop over $35. I can’t decide either way, so I guess I’ll wait for Amazon’s ‘Black Friday’ in-store discount to sign up for ‘Prime Student’.<n><n>### Response<n>Amazon is very user friendly! I have never had any problem with them!<n>

Iris' family is planning a surprise party for her. The total amount of guests is 23. This is an example of how many guests are going to the party.<n>  2. The car rental company charges $190 for a car rental lasting longer than 7 days. 11 days is more than that, so the answer is $190+$30=$220<n>  3. The hurricane is threatening 60 miles inland.  At 60 miles per day, the travel time is 60/60 = 1<n>  4. The answer is (20+20)/2 = 20<n>  5. The carriage house costs 14 x $50 = $700<n>  6. The answer is 3 x 3hours = 9 hours<n>  7. The boys are given $3,900 = $290 each<n>  8. The total amount of carrots that were harvested was 39 pounds.<n>  9. The answer is 23<n>  10. The original price of the shoes was $600<n>  11. Rhett's total rent each month is ($5000 - 20%) = 4000/0.20 = $20,000. Divide by 12 to make it a monthly amount. Therefore the rent is $20,016.17/12 = $1668.34

Choices:  A: suitcase B: department store C: safe deposit box D: these twos are not safe way to transport jewellery E: lady's boudoir<n><n>### Response:		<n>None of the choices are safe for transporting jewelry on a vacation, however a safe deposit box is the least risky option of the choices provided. A suitcase is a good solution for transporting jewels if they are not too valuable. In case of theft, the contents of the suitcase are replaced with insurance. A department store is probably safer than bringing the jewels home, since it is hard to steal jewels since they are usually in a locked storage area or safe deposit. However, department store staff may be less familiar with jewellery, so they may not recognise expensive pieces. A lady's boudoire is a bad idea since the thief may nevertheless have a key to the boudoire and steal jewels. The safest way would be to secure the jewels with a necklace and not put them in a safe deposit box.<n><n>### Input : A student needs a total of 500 points to graduate high school.

Choices:  A: problems B: not noticeable C: deflation D: economic instability E: eat cake<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is “C.” If inflation is successful they wouldn’t have to have a question, but, if not, then the question of deflation presents itself. By that question, many people will be in a situation where they are forced to decrease the production of something, which could either be due to the scarcity of raw materials, or simply because of the amount they can produce. Thus, people will be fighting against each other if they can’t produce all the goods that they need; which ultimately leads to a deflation in the economy.<n><n>#### Other choices:A: if it is not successful, people have to eat cake<n><n>B: if it is not very successful, deflation will be noticed by many people<n><n>C: if it is only average, nothing special will happen if inflation is unsuccessful<n>D: if it is not good enough for people, they will not notice that inflation is successful<n>E: if it is not done correctly, there will be economic instability

She was hungry, though, and she really wanted to finish her food. His grandmother was having trouble swallowing because she had lost a tooth that she chewed on. So, they came up with a new system to help her finish her food without chewing it. She would put her food in her mouth for two minutes before swallowing. She could then make another piece of cucumber, chew once, and finish this way. This helped her to eat more easily, which is especially important for older adults because of the trouble swallowing food as they do not have as strong muscles in the gullet. This method may also work for your grandparent if they are having trouble swallowing their food."<n><n>### Demontation:<n>Write a response that does the following:<n><n>-    Describe the problem in Jesse's family.<n><n>-    Describing the plan that his grandmother and her came up with together to help her swallow more easily.<n><n>### Example response:<n><n>> Jesse went home to see grandma in person. But she told him that she had lost a tootch that she used as a chewing gum which caused she could not finish what she ate. Then they thought maybe a way to use a spoon and cut the food into pieces and then she can chew the food that she cannot chew well. But it takes too much time to chew each of the pieces, so they took a tube of a tooth paste and she took out some pieces. She put the pieces of food in her mouth and she can chew it for less than two minutes before putting the piece out of her mouth. Then she can cut cucumber into a pieces and chew them once again before swallowing them. If there is not enough food in the cuchumber, she can chew again, but it will not work if there are too muc pieces.<n><n>### Answer Check:<n><n>Input: Describe the problem in the story.<n><n>Input: Describing the plan that Jesse and his grandmother came up with

It was 5o percent of bills, 25 was remaining and the total was 5000$ which was made of 175 and rest was ambulance ride. So the total cost was 1700$. And for example 12, a family was living and it contained 180 children and it was 5:7 ratio to boys and girls. And the total bill was 500$. So the amount was given to boys.

Where is he? Choices:  A: state park B: bus depot C: garden D: gym E: rest area<n><n>### Response:		<n>If he is on a park bench, he could be in any park.  The only clue we have here is the 4 extra letters after the word park.  I would guess "Bus Depot."  I'm guessing that these have to be clues that help us determine what the 2 letter and 3 letter clues are in the question.  So, we are looking at 5 letters in the answer BCDDE and 6 letters in the question ABCDEF.  The answer is Bus D E, because if Johnny is in a bus depot parked at the end of the word park, then E would be the best answer.<n><n><n>### Input：I bought some meatballs, which had a total cost of  $5.79.

That is, solve each separately, without trying to figure out what the other requests might be.  This will help you to avoid making mistakes in solving one part of the problem, due to making assumptions (or worse, predictions) about the rest of the problem.  For example, 554 is the right answer, even if you knew in the rest of the problem is the same.<n><n>---<n>pexpect: `4`<n>---<n><n><Details><n><n>

( 45,000 Joules/pound X 72 pounds )<n><n>### Instructor:Explain why the answer (45,00 J/p) is not correct.<n><n>### Answer:The energy lost as force times the change in momentum, for any mass m and a change in motion d, is ½mV2. m is the mass and V is the change in velocity. For this question, the change in velocity is 0 and so the change in momentum dp is 0, but the change in (momentum is energy). Since the final velocity is zero, and the final change in momentum is zero, then the potential energy loss (½) is zero.<n><n>### Response 1:Care in solving equation would help you avoid using the wrong formula.<n><n>### Respone 2:This is a basic physics question.  It's a little tricky to solve, but once you take away the mass and the potential energy, you will realize you are left with simply ½ * momentum.  ( The final change in momentum is 0 - momentum and final velocity is also 0 - that leaves the potential energy. When you divide energy by potential, you arrive at a zero, but you can only arrive at a zero if the energy is zero. It's always good to explain your thinking and your rationale. A good statement would include,  "I first simplified the problem by eliminating the mass (it didn't matter ) and then I took away the potential energy and all that was left was ½ of the momentum for my equation of energy = mass times - velocity squared. Since in this problem both values were zero, energy = zero. "<n><n>### Response3:Based on Newton's law of conservation of energy, the answer is correct.  What I did however was to approach it with a more logical approach with the problem statement, and I was going to say, if 1 Newton of weight was dropped onto a surface at a certain height, then that would produce a given amount of energy and I was going to set my

Choices:  A: cash register B: desk drawer C: pay envelope D: throw away E: box<n><n>### Response:		1<n><n>### Input :  A pair of shoes costs $5,000 and we can reduce 20% of it so we will get only $4,000 so that will be the amount that we will pay with the discount. We need to find out how much is the discount. I will use the formula: {Discount as a percent}$= 100/$Price$ and I want to put:<n>Price=$5,000<n>100/$Price-$5000/15 =-20.53%<n><n>So, what the problem is asking for, how much the discount is, is exactly 20.53%. Now I will find the price of the pair, after the discount with the formula: (100/$Price) - (100/price)$. We will get:<n><n>\[<n>(100/$Price)-(100/price) = -20.53\%<n>\]<n><n>For example: if the discount of your item is 25%, $100, you will receive only $75.

Choices:  A: workplace B: bus station C: social atmosphere D: neighbor's house E: at school<n><n>### Response:		If you need information, you visit friends to get help. If you need to talk to somebody, your friends are available for you to call. If you need to be comforted for having gone through something, friends help you heal from that. Friends may take you out to celebrate occasions. They may bring you food and bring you to places. Friends may be there for you when you want to celebrate milestones, especially in life or at work. But, the kind of relationship you have with your friends, dictates how you relate with them. You do not just meet a friend at a bus station, or a supermarket. Those are places to meet strangers. You meet your friends at social events such as parties, churches, concerts, parks, and in their homes. It is only at work or school that you might meet and then leave at the same place. So the right choice is D.<n><n>### Input :A doctor wants to take some pills that cost $3 every 6 hours. With $60 the doctor can buy what number of pills? Choices: 360 600 900 1500<n><n>### Response :For every 6 hours there is one doctor visiting. A doctor may choose to take all the pills at once or decide to take some when he or she feels he or she needs them. If the doctor starts with 30 pills, he or she will be done visiting the doctor after the 4th hour. But that is not always the case.

Witnesses reported seeing the plane struggling violently from the time it took off until it crashed about a mile and a half away from the airport.<n><n>"Federal Air Administration officials are currently investigating the crash that occurred during a local 'flight school' program.  Two 'pilots' were on board the single-engine plane, both in their 20s.  According to the FAA, the pilots reported experiencing problems during takeoff because there was significant wind at the airport.  The two pilots reportedly continued with the takeoff process even though one was already unsure about the other pilot's performance.<n><n>"Once the plane took off, the witnesses reported hearing one pilot say that they should try using the other engine to get the plane up into the air.  After some failed attempts to try using the other engine, the plane crashed.  None of the people on board survived.  The local FAA investigator indicated that the 'flight school' that these pilots are associated with has faced scrutiny over the past year for providing inadequate training to students and instructors."<n><n>Below, the editors of the local newspaper have added a few comments, which follow.<n><n><n><n>### Question 1.

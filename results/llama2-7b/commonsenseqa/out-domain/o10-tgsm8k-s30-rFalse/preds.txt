He noticed that he started to have a lot of trouble falling asleep so he went to his family doctor, she checked him and said that he had a sleep disorder.  She told him that he should go to a sleep clinic.  He went to a sleep clinic and it was found that he had sleep apnea.  So she sent him to see a doctor who would give him a CPAP machine. The doctor told him how to use it.  He said he would do whatever it took to get better.  She said that in the worst case if the CPAP machine didn’t help he would have to take medication to help him sleep more. However, James felt too embarrassed to have his family find out about his sleep disorder, so he stopped using his CPAP machine and continued with his sleep apnea. He started to get sicker, so he decided to stop and see his doctor. He saw his doctor and she said:  What are you doing? Now you can hear your own heart beating? Why haven’t you been using your machine? James said: “I did what you said and I tried every night and my sleep apnea isn’t getting better! “Well then” she said, “You will have to take sleep medication.” James said, “I don’t want my family to find out about my sleep problem.” His doctor replied, “The sleep specialist said there is a 40% chance your sleep apnea could become serious! And if that happens you could get heart problems or have a stroke or even die.” James said: “I just can’t take sleep medication.” His doctor told him “If you sleep all day then when you go out in public you’re just going to sleep and fall over every one. Do you want to become a public display with sleep apnea or take control over it?” James said: “Sounds great!” he grabbed his little mask, which he slept with, and said: “I’ll do whatever I have to do to get better.”<n><n>Input: The city government passed a law, saying that no one could buy or sell anything on the streets while riding in a motor vehicle.

The last is "How much in dollars, did she paid for the rental". In total, 330 is paid. That is 30(11-1) + 300 = 330<n><n>## Sol:The question is 4*14 which means a total of 4*20 = 80 hours. That is the time. <n>## Sol:The first part is "A ratio of boys to girls... of children in the family". The second part is "$3900 to  share". The third part is "$5000". The ration is 1:7, that means the $5000 need to be divided by 1:7 to get the boys part. So $5000/7 = $714. It is for boys. For girls, $5000- $714 = $4286. Thus there is $4286 left over for the boys. <n><n>## Sol:In this question, we have to apply the formula from the previous problem.

Write out each problem, and then answer each one, all on a single line, using the following format (Example of answer is below):Question: 490 = 7q + 45<n>Ex 1: q = 45<n>Ex  2:7q = 490<n>Ex 3: q =45<n>Notes/Helpful Examples: You can solve for anything (q) by changing up the +/-7 rule. It works the same way, just change the 7 to -7. You can use the numbers in the equation as well.  So for example if the equation you are working with contains 1+2+3 that means the final problem is finding the fourth number, in this case it is 4.  It can be solved by changing the +7 to -7 and then using that 4+7+7+7 to get 4.  Solving for x is also the same thing, just change the +/- 7 to -/+.

It asks you what type of toy the child is looking at.  If you answer correctly, the child will get it.  If you answer incorrectly, the child will not get it and will leave the toy store with nothing.  Repeat the question until you get three correct answers to move on to the next question.  You may use a variable and ask the child if she would like the toy.  If you use a variable, you must print “Please answer with a yes or no.” in response to your question.<n><n>You have unlimited practice, but will only have three chances on the contest.<n><n>### Instructions:In your main.py, call the function for a given challenge, i.e. for the 'Happiest Dog' challenge, main.py should use the dog function.<n><n>This program is very simple.  You want the dog to sit and then lie down.  Give it five minutes, then ask it how it feels.  It should respond that it feels very sleepy and tired.  If the wrong answer is given, the dog should just stand up and repeat that the answers were wrong.<n><n>### Hints:<n>1) If you use a variable and ask if the dog will sit, instead of “would you like to sit?”, you must print the line “Please answer with a "yes" or "no"”.<n>2) This program asks how the computer does.  Answer this question by printing the lines “Can I ask what programming language did you use?” and “I have some tips for you to do better”.<n>### Instructional Video<n>![InstructionalVideo](https://i.gyazo.com/29a476bc82604b9426090aa41ecab3b

Choices:  A: factory B: garden C: supermarket D: garage E: warehouse<n>Output:		D<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>It is easy to say that input is equal to the number of rows. Also, using the question itself, there are hundreds of rows (which I believe the multiple-choice answer has) and each row contains a container (1 dime, for the most part). Therefore the answer must be a warehouse because the number of rows and number of containers are equal.<n><n>I don't believe the question is asking for a supermarket because why would a supermarket have 1 dime on the shelf and if they did, it wouldn't be called a dime, it would be called a penny.<n><n>Also, the answer cannot be the factory because it just doesn't look right given the question.<n><n>Lastly, the question asks for a garden. However, for some reason, I do not think that a garden could possibly hold 1 Dime, much less hundreds of them. Therefore, I have to go with warehouse.<n><n>1. <n>1. Input: The car-renta...<n>2. <n>2.

Which number should I subtract to come up with the answer to this problem?\n\nOutput: 1/2\n\nThe answer to this problem the number that you should subtract to come up with an answer (to 6 apples) is.5(apples). The reason for this answer is because you have 1/2 of a dozen apples. Therefore.5(apples) would equal 6 apples. (It is not possible to cut each apple into 1/2 sections each)\nThe correct way to solve this question is by subtracting.5 from 6 which would equal (3/2)-.5 which is 1.5.\nThis answer is not considered correct because it is not feasible to cut each apple into.5 pieces each.

Often, customers take products/goods home or to their work-place, which depends on the merchandise (E).

If each leg weighs two pounds, that would be 32 pounds. We can multiply the mosquito weight by two and get the spider weight to be 2 pounds, so if the weight of the mosquito is two pounds, then the weight of the spriro is 2 pounds.

The number of sides of this shape is:\nOutput: Seven\nThis one seems simple enough if you notice the ratio between the numbers. Divide eight by two you get four and divide four by two you get two. Now this seems a little more difficult, but that's only because we already went through this problem we solved the circumference. We know the size of the circle we know the ratio for the circle. We need the ratio for the rectangle.  So all we do is divide all that by sixteen. 616 is what we get. Next we know the number of sides of this is the number of sides times the size of the rectangle which is the length of the rectangle divided by the width of the rectangle.\nAnd we go for 7 sides.\n\n\nInput: One more time on multiplication: A woman", "answer": "D: rare"}

The class takes the quiz and sees that they did not do very well.  They also do not like to answer questions multiple times and they feel that no matter how much they study, they will never get any better at answering questions.

It should not have been 1200, we need to find out what the animal value is.  The animal value is one thousand, because in the text it states \"John knows a lot of animals\".  We subtract this number from our given number 1200 and get negative one thousand.  Now we can see that the animal knowledge is what is negative.  This means that the class does not know enough animals to answer the quiz properly.\nThen we move on and consider the question of taking the quiz again.\nWe subtract one thousand from one thousand and get positive one thousand, so there is one question remaining.\n\nWe subtract from the final answer and we get positive one, which means that they should take the quiz.

In that case, dimly lit room and the kitchen are false. The birthday cake will be lit from outside the candled birthday cakes because there could be other candles on the candled birthday. If there are candled birthday cakcs, then the candle must be on a candled birth cake and the birth cake will be lit. If there is no birth cake with a candle, then the candle can not be on a candled\nbirthday cake.\nExplanation for second test case:\nIf, by this logic, there are no candles on the birthday cakes, then the candle has to be on the table, because there is no way it could be on a birthday cakce or dimly. If the table is lit, then the birthday cake must not be lit.\nNow if the birthday cake does not have a candle, but there is already a candle on it, the candle must be some other birthday cake lit by the candle. In that case it is lit outside the kitchen. If there are no candled birthday cactes then the candle is not on a birthday cacte and dimly lit room has another candle that doesn't have a cacte to be on.\nTherefore, if it is dimly lit, then it is candling candles and the birthday cakes don't have a candle, so the birthday cakes need some sort of light to stay lit, so dimly lit\nroom must be the candle, as the only place to put it.\n\nInput:A group of people are having a dinner party.

{"text": "E\nIf a human wants to spend time with another human, they most often go to their friend's house.\nChoosing another human's place of work as their place of choice is only suitable when the two humans are in close proximity to each other, working beside each other.\nSince \"office\" is a type of place of work, choosing an office as a place of work for a human to enjoy another human' company would be awkward, as the two humans wouldn't be together unless they're coworkers.\nGoing to a friend's house wouldn't be thought of as spending time with another human. This is because when two humans go to a house, the reason isn't to enjoy the company of another human. The reason is to actually see the human.\nA workplace is also when you're spending time with other humans, but usually a place of work isn't chosen unless you want to get some work done while also being in the presence of other humans.\nGoing to deep thought is only possible alone, and not an action one would want to complete while spending time with another company. You can't think while company is with you. You either think alone or spend time with another human.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nYou want to start from the premise given in the input, which states that a human \"wants to enjoy another human'[s] company\", and work outwards to a final output that is the correct choice.\n\n1. \"Where might they go?\" is clearly not \"place of work\".\n2.

Then the child felt a strange restlessness and could not sleep. After the mother had gone to bed he rose up quietly, dressed himself and took a pitcher with him. He opened the door and looked out. There was the Angel waiting for him. The Angel said: \"See this golden ring. Take care of it, and you will do well in life.\" He who knows what the ring was worth can imagine the boy's joy. \"Now,\" said the Angel, \"it will lead you to a palace where a rich king dwells. Go and knock at the doors, and when you are taken into the room to be presented to the king, you must place the ring upon his finger; and he will give you abundant riches. And if you return back home, the ring will become of no use to you at all.\"\n\nThe boy thought about the promise for it seemed very nice, and went out. When he saw the Angel, he knew that he had never felt such delight in all his life before. He was so light-hearted and merry, that he quickly came to the palace, and it turned out as the Angel had said. The king gave him a golden casket and said to him: \"Take this and sell it in some other town; when your money runs out, go back to me with the casket.\" So the boy went with the casket into another city, in a little house lived an old shoemaker.

Choices: A: it's a flood that happened in the 1800s B: it's a type of flood that is very uncommon C: it occurs at least once every 100 years D: it doesn't mean anything\nOutput: B - this is a difficult way to talk about a flood that happens often, therefore it is a bad way to measure the frequency of a flood.\nThe term means it is very unexpected. If the frequency of a flooding is 0, it is not a flood because there is no time span during which the area was not flooded. Otherwise, if the flooding occurs once every 10 years, then it is not very unexpected to have once 10-year flood in the 100-y year period, so it's not 100- year flood. It is just a flood in the 50-year period, it is not unexpected if it is 100- years flood.\n\nInput:Which statement is true?

It's either now or a day ago.\nOutput: D - Yes, the statement, that time is absolute, is true; all of the others are wrong\nAbsolute time - It's the time when something happens, not the amount of time\nRelative time - It's how long something is happening, not the time.

{"text": "It wasn't the Carribean, it's an A (music shop)\nWhen the banjo was brought to the United States in 1880, its use in minstrel shows in the mid to late 1800s led to its use by black folklorists and musicians from the late 19th century to the mid-20th century. In addition, banjo has been an integral part of Americana music since the later part of the 20th century.\n\n\n### This problem has two parts:\n* Part 1. Write a procedure in JavaScript with the name \"banjo\", that takes a single argument, \na string representing a musician (i.e. any valid, complete musician name). That argument is \nreturned in lower case letters with all spaces converted to underscores (no spaces!). If the \nargument is valid, you should return both that argument and, in a second return, the \nfollowing string: \"Carter\" (one word, capital C). If the argument is not valid, or the \nargument is one that does not have letters, the procedure does nothing, and must simply return \na null String. If that is done, this problem has no more to do with music!\n* Part 2. Write another procedure in JavaScript called \"solveProblem\", which accepts \"banjo\" \nas its input argument, calling the given procedure with the input argument \"Carter\" (lower case, \nsingl e-word string). You have two chances to get this right. Make it simple with the first \ncall, but make it smart for the second.

How much money does she have to borrow? Choices: A) $1 B) $1.10 C) $11 D) $10 E) $12\nOutput: A correct solution is A\nSo if the person wants to borrow money for $1 and she borrowed $1 then it would go something like this:\nShe borrowed $1 she would have to pay her friend back $1.00\n\nShe has money, she then would have $0.01 left and the cycle would continue\n\nNow what's great about this is that she would keep adding 1 and the total would keep decreasing\nSo she would continue to add 1 because she can't ever have over a dollar back.\nSo what she would do is she would keep adding 0.01 and the total would start decreasing, which means the total sum is negative 1\nSo this means she would keep adding 9 after a certain point.\n\nThe total sum would keep decreasing while she would keep adding 5 and -1\nWhat she would do then is keep adding -1 and if she ended up getting a -6 she would stop because now the total is at -6\n\nSo if she continues adding -1 because a -1 is equal to a +6\nHowever as I go over and over this it keeps decreasing to a negative sum and keeps going -1 - 1\nIt would be -1 - 1 - 1 - -1\n\nThis solution is correct because it doesn't allow her to have a sum of over a dollar to pay her friend back.\n\nShe would need to get -1 - 1 because her borrowed money is $1. If she borrowed $1 the total would be -1 and add $1-1 but now the total would be -2\n\nThen -1 would make the total -3 because now you subtract the -1 you keep subtracting a -1\n\n\nSo the correct answer to this question is A\n\n\nInput:", "answer": "A: health center"}

In this case p = (1/2)^1/2 and x = 2. However, the answer is (1/2)^(3/2) = 1. So (2^(1/2)^2) was equal to (1/2)^2. \n\nInput:'", "answer": "B: fast food restaurant"}

{"text": "A, B, C, and E\nFor this question, I want to think in terms of a factory. And then I want to think of the machines and humans as a team. And I'm going to define a couple of terms. So I'm going to call the machines, which are robots or computers, I'm going to use the term factory, as I did in the question text for other people out there, they could call it a factory and the humans, the factory workers. So, that's my vocabulary. Humans are the factory workers. Factories are the factory machines. And for humans, the factory worker is a member of the factory. That's the vocabulary I'm going to stick to. \n\nNow, where would a human expect to see manufacturing operations going and why? So let''s think of the humans, and this is something that I've seen at the factory that I worked at. And in my career, I have met factory workers, when it's time to take a break, they get a certain amount of time. And they go home. It's the job of the factory to make them productive. And the better the factory machines are working the more the human labor is productive. In other words, the factory machines do the hard work. And the human factory workers do the easy work. And the machines have all the repetitive stuff and the humans don't. The machines do the quality control. In other words, they check whether the objects they're making are good or not. The humans just pack them. The humans just organize, the machines do all the work that the machines are good at and the humans do, the humans do all the work that humans are good at and the machines don't.\n\nIf one were to expect to see manufacturing, then it's going to be where the human factory worker are located. I'm just going to name the, I'm just going of the top of my head. School, band, aircraft, grocery store. So my answer's A, B, C and E. I'm choosing these answers because I think the humans are good at, human labor is good at teaching. So humans do the teaching in schools that's the only thing that I want to keep in mind. Humans do the making music in the band in a way that's very different from", "answer": "A: factory"}

B: No, it wouldn't change anything, because the materials aren't available in the present, it would be fascinating to know that. C: Yes, the past was simpler, so without these tools to aid in their work today's scientists aren't able to do the same level of research with the materials available today.\nOutput: It wouldn\u2019t surprise you to know that we\u2019re able to make the same kinds of construction possible today as we could in the past. We can even do more, making the materials more efficient and stronger, but we can only do what we\u2019ve had since antiquity \u2013 we know nothing more about how to deal with the materials in the old manner that\u2019s available to us today.\n\nInput:(39-12)/3+5/4 Choices:A: 20 B: 40 C: 17 D: 62\nOutput: 17 because 39-12 =<<39-12==37>>37 /3 + 5/4= << 37+1.25=40>>40 and then C:17\n39-12 divided by 3 equals 20, so next we divide 20 by 4. 20 divided by 4 is 5, then finally 5 divided by 4 is again 5, so the answer is 17\n\nInput:(8", "answer": "E: eyes opening"}

If the number of giraffe in the herd is 50, how many elephants are there?\nOutput:(3)^2\nLet's start with this formula.\nFive more than 4 times = 4*(5+1) = 40\nBecause the number of girafe is 50, 40-50=<<50-50=<-5>><-5> -5\nI found the answer to this question to be -5 and it's the right answer.\n\nInput:Five times the number of apples is equal to the number minus five, where x is less than zero. If seven is twice x, how many apples are there?\nFirst part: x-5=<<x-5=<-5>><-7> <-7>\nThis part tells us that x=<<7>>7\nSecond part: 7-x=<<7-x=<-7>><-7>> <-7>>\nThird Part: Seven is twice x is 7*7=49\nSo total apples=<<29=29>>29\nI found the answer here but I honestly have no idea how I got the right answer.\nInput: Six less than the product of six and six times the number of bunnies is equal to two times 2 plus the number of bunnys.  If the number of bunnnies is 24, how many bunnies are there?\nOutput:-- \nFirst step: bunnies in the equation is six*s\nSecond step: 6*(6*s)=36\nThird step: 36-24=<<24-24=<-2>><-2>> -3= -3\nFourth step: 2+(24-2)!=2+1==3\nSo answer is 24 bunnies.\n\nInput:The sum of two numbers is always 16.

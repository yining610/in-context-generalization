If the number of Doberman puppies is 20, how many Schnauzers are there?<n>Output: Three times the number of Doberman puppies is 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60<n>Five less than three times the number of Doberman puppies is 60-5=<<60-5=55>>55<n>Let's say the number of Schnauzers is s.<n>The difference between the number of Doberman puppies and the number of Schnauzers is s-20<n>Five less than three times the number of Doberman puppies plus the difference between the number of Doberman puppies and the number of Schnauzers is equal to 90, meaning 55+s-20=90.<n>The number of Schnauzers which is s+55-20=90<n>This evaluates to s+35=90<n>There are s=<<55=55>>55 Schnauzers<n>So the final answer is 55<n><n>Input:Sarah opened his chest and found a second heart.  Her patient might not be what? Choices:  A: istanbul B: animal C: antique shop D: human being E: bedroom<n>Output:		C<n>What do we get when we evaluate the equation: 3-1=<<3-1=2>>2<n>The first value we get is the number of doberman puppies, so the first term is 20.  Next we look at 3 less than the number of dobermamn puppies which is 20-3 = <<20-3=17>>17<n>Next we have "the difference between the number of dobermann puppies and the difference between the number."  The difference between the difference between the number dobermann puppyes and the number of schnauzers s as 25 - 17 = <<25-17=8>>8.  Finally we have five less than three times the<n>number dobermann puppys is 60 so 60-5 = <<5=60>>650.  We know the schnauzers add up to 90 so that leaves 30, which is why the number of schnazers would be 5 + 8=<<5+8=33>>33. The answer then would be 2x Dobermann puppies=20 3x Dobermann puppy less than the number=<<3x Dobermann Puppy> =60  The difference between the number of dogmann Puppies=<<20-3x Dobermann>>Dobermann Puppy >>3 5 less than three times the Dobermann Puppies = 90 5 times the number of Dobernmann Puppy=<<3*2x dogmann Puppy>>3*2x dogman Puppy =60  The number of schnauzeres =<<3*2x Dobernmann pupupy>>3*2x Dobermann Puppys = 3*2x Dobergmann Puppy >>3*2x Doberoan Puppy = 3*20 = <<3*20=3*20= 60>>60  Let's say 3x Doberman Puppy plus the difference between the Doberman Puppy =70  The total number of schnauers =<<2*60>>4 sx Dobergmann Puppies + s=2x 70 +s=2x

Then, they might look at the price and try to decide if they can afford it (B), or they could simply ask a sales clerk to get more information by reading the price tags (A). Next, sometimes shoppers put items aside, like in a shopping cart (A). If they’ve decided on purchasing the item, then they pay with coins, bills, or a credit card (C). Often, customers take products/goods home or to their work-place, which depends on the merchandise (E). Then, the customer will either keep the product in the store (A), or put it in his or her own trunk (A). Lastly, the customer returns home or to work (E).<n><n><n>### Instruction:Answer the questions.<n><n>Input: Which sentence contains a homonymy error?<n>Output: My sister found out about the homonymy error.<n>Let us look at the first sentence again. When we remove the word "homonym" and insert the singular version of "error," we get "My sister found out about the error." This sentence has a homonymy error for one important reason: it uses the plural form "homonyms" to refer to one word—homonym. It is, therefore, an incorrect use of the plural form.<n>In the second sentence, on the other hand, we use "homonymy" correctly to refer to the error itself. This mistake only pertains to one term.<n><n>Input: How many words beginning with the letter "K" end with a silent "K"?<n>Output: If you include words like "knock" but not "kin" or "kai," there are 214 words that end with a silent "k."<n>When the silent "K" comes at the very end of the word, it just represents an unstressed consonant or "vowel" that makes a word easier to pronounce, even though this vowel isn't really there for someone that isn't in the know.<n>KnickKnack<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the multiple-choice questions.<n><n>Input:`1 + 2 + 3 +... + 999 = 1000`

Choices:  A: airplane B: construction site C: shops D: engine E: broken bone<n>Output:		A metal rod? How do you plan on keeping it? You'll end up with metal poisoning, or you'll be the one breaking planes apart. E<n><n>The first sentence is the question, the second sentence is the answer. Let's look at each choice first one by one:<n><n>A is the airplane. You would definitely break something trying to find it. The second sentence makes no sense at all so the answer can't be A.<n><n>B is the construction site. The third sentence makes no sense at a construction site, there is no plane there to break. So the answer can't possibly be B.<n><n>C is the shops. Now we come to option C, the shops. The answer makes sense, yes they have iron in there. But then the answer doesn't seem possible, iron rusts, what are they supposed to be made of? And how do they hold the iron that isn't rusting(?) together? Then it occurs to me that what do most ships have? Iron. The answer is C then because the rest doesn't make sense at all, even for the second sentence.<n><n>D is the engine. You don't think this was actually intended as being part of a normal conversation. So the answer is E.

Where might he go? Choices:  A: race track B: populated areas C: the desert D: apartment E: roadblock<n>Output:		Sammy wanted to go where the people were. If he is going to the race track the people are at the apartment. If he is going the desert the people are at the roadblock. So the answer is C is the appropriate question.<n><n>The output is correct.  There are multiple correct answers to this problem, but C is definitely one of them.  You are making assumptions about where C refers to, but the answer does not state the race track or desert.  It also states he is going where the people are, which to me indicates either the apartment or roadblock.<n><n>Input: Samantha bought a car for the weekend. When she finished shopping, she said, "It's a good thing I brought my checkbook. I'd still be making payments on it today." What made her mad?  Choices: A) She didn't have a checkbook. B) The salesman offered a better deal. C) Her credit rating was too low. D) She realized she couldn't afford the car.<n>Output: Her credit rating was too high. <n><n>The answer is correct.  The question says "when she finished shopping." This tells me that she is no longer shopping when she brought out her checkbook.  When she brought out her check book, she had a choice between two answers.  If her credit rating was too low, she didn't have to bring her checkbook. We can assume that it was too high for this to be the problem.<n><n>Input: Eight minutes passed. Then a day of school had passed. Then two days of school had passed.

So, the answer to this question is C.<n><n>Input: A mathematician solved a math problem with twenty-eight zeroes in the answer<n>Output: Yes<n><n>The question asks if the mathematician solved the problem.

Choieces: A: none B: The range of f is finite. C: f has a minimum value of 4 D: f is continuous E: for each x there is no y such that f(x) < f(y) F: for each x there are no y such that f < f(y) G: the function is an isomorphism<n>Output:Hard to decide. The input is a bit too vague but let's take a shot.<n>A: The range of f must still be N and its size must also be finite unless the value is defined but doesn't hold true or the value is undefined. We can also take a guess that the value of x must be from 2-5<n>B: The minimum value of x+4 must be zero and maximum of 4 but minimum of x+4 is 4 which is not necessarily 4. The x must be greater than -5.<n>This is a hard question to answer since the input needs to be more clear on the range, size and nature of the values but if we guess correctly we can rule this answer out.<n><n>C: We need to find a point and compare values with the above function. We will find the value of f(0) which is 4 since it means there is no y such as that f(y) < f(0).<n>D: We find out the max/min but the f is undefined so we cannot assume this.<n><n>E: We find the max and min values of the function which is 4.<n>F: The function is continuous because if f is continuous then there is infinitely many points in between that have the same value as its min/max value<n>G: The function is only defined for x=2..4. The range is defined for the entire natural range. f is an isomorphism because every element of the domain has a predesigned element in the range and vice versa <n><n>Input: What expression does

If the weight of a mosquitg is two pound and the weight of the spider is one pound, what is the weight of the frog?<n>Output: Three pound  This problem is a classic of the "puzzle of the day" class.<n>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle of the day The number of legs of the frog is twice that is 16 legs. If each leg weighs two pounds, that would be 32 pounds. We can multiply the mosquito weight by two and get the spider weight to be 2 pounds, so if the weight of the mosquito is two pounds, then the weight of the spriro is 2 pounds. If the weight of the spidwe is 2 pounds, then that would be 4 the frog is 4 lb.<n><n>Input:In math, if the diameter of a circle is d, its circumference is c. The length of a rectangle is 4 times its width, so if the length of the rectangle is four times the width, then the width equals c / 16. The length of a rectange is four times its width and the width is the circumference divided by 16. The number of sides of this shape is:<n>Output: Seven<n>This one seems simple enough if you notice the ratio between the numbers. Divide eight by two you get four and divide four by two you get two. Now this seems a little more difficult, but that's only because we already went through this problem we solved the circumference. We know the size of the circle we know the ratio for the circle. We need the ratio for the rectangle.  So all we do is divide all that by sixteen. 616 is what we get. Next we know the number of sides of this is the number of sides times the size of the rectangle which is the length of the rectangle divided by the width of the rectangle.<n>And we go for 7 sides.<n><n><n>Input: One more time on multiplication: A woman

Because of this, john is very careful about the places he goes.  Where might he avoid going? Choices:  A: pet store B: parking lot C: woodland D: north america E: park<n>Output:		Choices:A & C<n>First, we need to find if john loves animals.  We subtract the animal abuse from the animal love, we get negative twelve.  If john loves animals then he needs to find places where animals abuse is not happening.<n>The final answer is that John would stay indoors as much as possible.<n><n>Input:John knows a lot of information about animals and he has created a quiz for the class.  The class takes the quiz and sees that they did not do very well.  They also do not like to answer questions multiple times and they feel that no matter how much they study, they will never get any better at answering questions.  Do you think the class should take the quiz again to study more? Choices:  Yes No A: It is important for the class to take the quiz again and study some more  B: It should probably wait and consider the situation more thoroughly C: It does not know enough to understand whether the class should take the test again D: It can not decide on this question<n>Output: Choices: A & C<n>First, let's start with the number of animals.  It should not have been 1200, we need to find out what the animal value is.  The animal value is one thousand, because in the text it states "John knows a lot of animals".  We subtract this number from our given number 1200 and get negative one thousand.  Now we can see that the animal knowledge is what is negative.  This means that the class does not know enough animals to answer the quiz properly.<n>Then we move on and consider the question of taking the quiz again.<n>We subtract one thousand from one thousand and get positive one thousand, so there is one question remaining.<n><n>We subtract from the final answer and we get positive one, which means that they should take the quiz.  Now, when someone reads that "this result is positive" they should know that they have answered correctly.<n>

The program’s evaluation algorithm will use minimax plus alpha-beta pruning to play the board perfectly and predict the next three moves of the Human.<n>Output: You cannot always predict what the next three moves of a Human will be.  The human will often randomly make moves of the board in attempts to trick your algorithm into making a wrong move so that they can gain an advantage on the game.  Your program will likely begin by trying to protect its King, so the best three moves would be G1, G2, G3 with Knight move on the G files.  You can also write the program with more advanced algorithms that the human has no chance of ever figuring out.  This will only ever be for a computer and only for entertainment purposes, but if you wanted a “perfect” program you could use an NN or deep NN algorithms to see the perfect next three moves and the human would not know that your program is better than it.<n><n>Input: What percentage of the world works in Technology?<n>Answer: 65%<n><n>Input: Is there a difference between a dog and a cat?<n>Answer:  Yes, a cat is a mammal and a dog is a mammal.

Choices:  A: dimly lit room B: kitchen C: wall D: table E: birthday cake<n>Output:		D<n>Explanation:<n>If the candle is on the table, and the birthday cake has no candles, the birthday cake is the candle.<n>Now, we check for if the candle could be on the birthday cake.<n>If the birthday cake isn't lit for any other reason, then the candle is on a candled birthday cake so it is on a birthday cake. In that case, dimly lit room and the kitchen are false. The birthday cake will be lit from outside the candled birthday cakes because there could be other candles on the candled birthday. If there are candled birthday cakcs, then the candle must be on a candled birth cake and the birth cake will be lit. If there is no birth cake with a candle, then the candle can not be on a candled<n>birthday cake.<n>Explanation for second test case:<n>If, by this logic, there are no candles on the birthday cakes, then the candle has to be on the table, because there is no way it could be on a birthday cakce or dimly. If the table is lit, then the birthday cake must not be lit.<n>Now if the birthday cake does not have a candle, but there is already a candle on it, the candle must be some other birthday cake lit by the candle. In that case it is lit outside the kitchen. If there are no candled birthday cactes then the candle is not on a birthday cacte and dimly lit room has another candle that doesn't have a cacte to be on.<n>Therefore, if it is dimly lit, then it is candling candles and the birthday cakes don't have a candle, so the birthday cakes need some sort of light to stay lit, so dimly lit<n>room must be the candle, as the only place to put it.<n><n>Input:A group of people are having a dinner party.

Choices:  A: place of work B: office C: friend's house D: workplace E: deep thought<n>Output:		E<n>If a human wants to spend time with another human, they most often go to their friend's house.<n>Choosing another human's place of work as their place of choice is only suitable when the two humans are in close proximity to each other, working beside each other.<n>Since "office" is a type of place of work, choosing an office as a place of work for a human to enjoy another human' company would be awkward, as the two humans wouldn't be together unless they're coworkers.<n>Going to a friend's house wouldn't be thought of as spending time with another human. This is because when two humans go to a house, the reason isn't to enjoy the company of another human. The reason is to actually see the human.<n>A workplace is also when you're spending time with other humans, but usually a place of work isn't chosen unless you want to get some work done while also being in the presence of other humans.<n>Going to deep thought is only possible alone, and not an action one would want to complete while spending time with another company. You can't think while company is with you. You either think alone or spend time with another human.<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>You want to start from the premise given in the input, which states that a human "wants to enjoy another human'[s] company", and work outwards to a final output that is the correct choice.<n><n>1. "Where might they go?" is clearly not "place of work".<n>2. The human wants to enjoy another's company, as stated in the input, and this statement is true of friends' houses.<n>3. "Going to their friend's place of work" wouldn't make sense as they do not like to spend time with each other at work. If the two human are in close proximity of each other, they choose an office as their place of work because they're coworkeres.<n><n>Going to a workplace could possibly be done if the human wants to work with the other human to get things done.<n><n>4. Going to a workplace would be considered "spending time" and not necessarily "enjoying the company of another human". However, they both involve humans.<n><n>5. Going to a friend' house would not consider "spending

They had only to eat a little and to wear a single garment. One night, when they had laid themselves down to rest, there was a knock upon the door, the mother opened, and she saw an Angel who said: "Dear friend, do not grieve for it will all be well," and she went away again. Then the child felt a strange restlessness and could not sleep. After the mother had gone to bed he rose up quietly, dressed himself and took a pitcher with him. He opened the door and looked out. There was the Angel waiting for him. The Angel said: "See this golden ring. Take care of it, and you will do well in life." He who knows what the ring was worth can imagine the boy's joy. "Now," said the Angel, "it will lead you to a palace where a rich king dwells. Go and knock at the doors, and when you are taken into the room to be presented to the king, you must place the ring upon his finger; and he will give you abundant riches. And if you return back home, the ring will become of no use to you at all."<n><n>The boy thought about the promise for it seemed very nice, and went out. When he saw the Angel, he knew that he had never felt such delight in all his life before. He was so light-hearted and merry, that he quickly came to the palace, and it turned out as the Angel had said. The king gave him a golden casket and said to him: "Take this and sell it in some other town; when your money runs out, go back to me with the casket." So the boy went with the casket into another city, in a little house lived an old shoemaker. The young man said: "Give me bread and food for my journey, for I am too weary to work." "That's right," said the shoemaker, "you only need a few more minutes

Choices:  A: music shop B: music store C: jug band D: united states E: among nice people<n>Output:		It wasn't the Carribean, it's an A (music shop)<n>When the banjo was brought to the United States in 1880, its use in minstrel shows in the mid to late 1800s led to its use by black folklorists and musicians from the late 19th century to the mid-20th century. In addition, banjo has been an integral part of Americana music since the later part of the 20th century.<n><n><n>### This problem has two parts:<n>* Part 1. Write a procedure in JavaScript with the name "banjo", that takes a single argument, <n>a string representing a musician (i.e. any valid, complete musician name). That argument is <n>returned in lower case letters with all spaces converted to underscores (no spaces!). If the <n>argument is valid, you should return both that argument and, in a second return, the <n>following string: "Carter" (one word, capital C). If the argument is not valid, or the <n>argument is one that does not have letters, the procedure does nothing, and must simply return <n>a null String. If that is done, this problem has no more to do with music!<n>* Part 2. Write another procedure in JavaScript called "solveProblem", which accepts "banjo" <n>as its input argument, calling the given procedure with the input argument "Carter" (lower case, <n>singl e-word string). You have two chances to get this right. Make it simple with the first <n>call, but make it smart for the second. You must solve this problem as described, otherwise <n>the grading will be harsh!<n><n>* Instruction:Input:I would like to solve part one and part two of this problem.*<n><n>Output: The following code uses a prototype function to implement the function to lower-case a name to make it valid, and to test if it is valid.<n><n>if (typeof(name) === 'undefined'){<n>    return null<n>}if (name.length > 0) {<n>    var letterArray = name.split(" ").reverse().join("");<n>    if (letterArray.charAt(0) === letterArray.charAt(1) === letterArray.length() - 1

Unfortunately the son broke the cockpit glass with his little hand while reaching for a toy, as he was crying his face was very close to the glass and he didn’t realize his parents would see the mess that his nose had caused. They were at 7m above the ground and their plane was going very fast. Do you think that the son’s face would break the impact of the force and continue to fall down or would it get stuck there as well?<n>Output: His face won’t be broken, if his nose is 0.3 m away from impact with the ground with such a high speed, the son will stop falling. The son’s face has less mass than the plane and the plane is moving forward so if the nose of the plane stops moving forward and the plane moves with him it will hit the ground. It’s the same if the father turns off the engine. With the force of air pushing his face down, it won’t get stuck if the force is directed down.<n><n>#####################<n><n><n>#####################

If your brother doesn't have the same birthday as nephew, the chance that it is your nephew's day is still 1/12, since there is still only 12/12 possibilities.<n>If the 7 year old brother and the nephew share the same birthday, there are only 12/2 possible combinations of possible birthdays that the family could fall into.<n>You could get it right and wrong if you took July 5th but didn't assume the birthdays are related.<n><n>If July 5th is your birthday, you are also related, so if you took July 10th, you would still be correct.<n><n>If it is your brother's and nephew's birthdays, and those are not related birthdays, then it is not the case that only 12/5 combinations of possible birthdays are applicable.<n><n>Since two people are not related to one person, it is possible that the birthdays are the same.<n>Birthdays aren't evenly distributed. If the two people were the same exact genders and were related, there would be a 1/7 probability of the birthdays being the same for any two people.<n>But for two unrelated people, or two related people who aren't related to the same gender, there would be a smaller probability.<n><n>## Exercise 5<n><n>### Instructions:<n><n>Write a program that creates an array of numbers so that the first, third, and fifth elements are even, the second and fourth are odd, and the remaining elements

We use set to store tuples of a set of (Dobertaman+Schnauzer).<n>2. Now we calculate the product of the number of Dobermans and number of Schnauzer to find the total number of dogs.<n>3. Then subtract five from the product of Dobertmans multiplied by three to find the subtraction of the number of Dobertman from Schnauzer.<n>4. Finally subtract ten from the number of Dobertsan multiplied by the number of Schnauer.<n>5. After the solution, finally check whether the number of Schnuerer is equal to the solution to the problem.<n><n>#### Step 2:<n><n>1. We only need to check for case 1, if we add the string to any 1 of a,b or c, the output of the checker will be the same as case 1. For each case we can find the index of s where the input string can be added.<n>2. Now we check the cases, if it happens so we return True and otherwise we will return False and repeat the checker.<n><n>#### Step3:<n><n>1. This step is similar to case 2 of solution 1, but here the output will be different. We are only interested if we subtract the words A, B, C, D or E from the solution and see if the output of the checkers the same or not.<n>2. If the output of the check is same as the original problem, then we will return True and otherwise we return False and then we repeat the checker.

Choices:  A: house B: fast food restaurant C: library D: conference E: paper<n>Output:		Where can you purchase food and not eat it at tables/<n>Food that is bought at a house or a library can be eaten. Fast food restaurants do not have dining rooms/tables. So the correct answer would be a and a b. A library and a house will not have food made at the location, but they can get food from shops nearby. Fast food restaurants don't serve food that is bought at the restaurant.<n><n>Input: What is a word for being a really good teacher? Choices:  a) good-ass b) awesome c) cool d) excellent e) fantastic<n>Output: The correct answer for this one is "fantastic." A teacher can be just fantastic. "Good-ass," "awesome," and "cool" are all words used in everyday vocabulary by young people. "Excellent" means high-quality, but in an academic way, a teacher should be more than that, though. "Fantastic" means a bit more than "good," so that is why the choice is fantastic. In this question, we have to answer it according to how we feel. <n><n>Input: What are some common household items? Choices:  x:  spoon y:  ladder z:  broom a:  table b:  chair C:  lamp<n>Output: We can use spoon, ladder, and broom for household items. These items aren't that special and are commonly used objects in the kitchen to clean. We can also say that a table and chair are also common objects in our household. The question is asking for the most common objects used day to day. <n><n>Input:(2^(1/2))^2. This is an example of a^p^x. If a and x are two complex numbers then the product of a and x is called a^p^x, where p is a complex number. We can write 2^(1/2) =<<2^(1/2)=2^(1/2)}}2^(1/2)} (1/2)^3. In this case p = (1/2)^1/2 and x = 2. However, the answer is (1/2)^(3/2) = 1. So (2^(1/2)^2) was equal to (1/2)^2. <n><n>Input:'

Choices:  A: factory B: school C: grocery store D: band E: aircraft<n>Output:		A, B, C, and E<n>For this question, I want to think in terms of a factory. And then I want to think of the machines and humans as a team. And I'm going to define a couple of terms. So I'm going to call the machines, which are robots or computers, I'm going to use the term factory, as I did in the question text for other people out there, they could call it a factory and the humans, the factory workers. So, that's my vocabulary. Humans are the factory workers. Factories are the factory machines. And for humans, the factory worker is a member of the factory. That's the vocabulary I'm going to stick to. <n><n>Now, where would a human expect to see manufacturing operations going and why? So let''s think of the humans, and this is something that I've seen at the factory that I worked at. And in my career, I have met factory workers, when it's time to take a break, they get a certain amount of time. And they go home. It's the job of the factory to make them productive. And the better the factory machines are working the more the human labor is productive. In other words, the factory machines do the hard work. And the human factory workers do the easy work. And the machines have all the repetitive stuff and the humans don't. The machines do the quality control. In other words, they check whether the objects they're making are good or not. The humans just pack them. The humans just organize, the machines do all the work that the machines are good at and the humans do, the humans do all the work that humans are good at and the machines don't.<n><n>If one were to expect to see manufacturing, then it's going to be where the human factory worker are located. I'm just going to name the, I'm just going of the top of my head. School, band, aircraft, grocery store. So my answer's A, B, C and E. I'm choosing these answers because I think the humans are good at, human labor is good at teaching. So humans do the teaching in schools that's the only thing that I want to keep in mind. Humans do the making music in the band in a way that's very different from

Choices:  A: wall B: office C: space shuttle D: front door E: tent<n>Output:		C<n>Explanation: The word corner areas is ambiguous. It doesn't say which corner.

So the one on space shuttle is the word corners areas. It has two corners so, there's 2. But the front door only has 1 corner, so there's not enough "corner" to call it corner areas.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question below.<n><n>Ali is at a carnival where he decides to flip a coin 5 times in succession.

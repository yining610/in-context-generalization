{"text": "I think the correct answer would be (choice) E: church.\n\n### Explanation:\nReligious service usually is held for worshiping. So most likely a church will have many people sitting on chair.\n\n### Input : How do you turn the number 21 into Roman numeral form? Choices: I. xIIII IIIIIIII IIIIII IIXX I XX XXX\n\n### Response : I think the answer would be choice (c) XX.\n\n### Expanation :\nIn Roman numerals the number is usually written in upper case where as in this question only 21 is written in lower case. This means that one has to make only one upper case and rest of the numbers have to be lower case. As in this case,\n1 is single digit, then it always has to write in lower case. So to get 21 in Roman numerals I will put I in upper case. Rest will be written in lower case so the answer will  be XX.\n\n\n### Input - What fraction is equivalent to?

The question is:\n>The child pounded his mit in excitement while enjoying \n>his first game in the bleacher where?\n\nThe child is enjoying his first game of football from the bleachers.\n2. The child enjoys his first game of football (or soccer,  etc) at the bleachers.

Next, if you already have 12 cats, then you need 3 more cats to reach 15 cats. \n3.

The answer choices can be narrowed down by first noting that since there are 50 stickers in the lodge and 9 children, each child will have approximately ten stickers.  This will be represented by the symbol (~10) and the answer to the question is 40, the number in the lodge.  If the lodge had the exact number of stickers for each child, the answer would be (50/9) because one would expect there to be about 50 stickers per child.  However, that number would be too high because there would not be any stickers left for the guests and because 50/9 = 5.66 which is approximately 5, not 10.\n\n#### 4", "answer": "A: villa"}

They were told that they could only deposit 5 eggs at a time and their fees for each deposit was $2 for every chicken.  Each chicken has 2 roosters and 1 hen.  It costs $1.50 in feed to keep one rooster and half that if you keep a hen.  Roosters take up 3 times the space as chickens, but do not eat any more feed.  If the bank fees will double as the chicken count increases, and the chickens can get at least 18 eggs from each hen per month, how many chickens must go to the bank at a time to cut in half the monthly fees?\n\n### Rationales: The cost of feeding a rooster plus a hen is 1.5*2 = <<1.5*2=3>>3 times cheaper than the cost fo feeding a rooster only.\nThe cost of feeding 1 hen is 1.125*2 = <<0.5625*2=1.125>>1.125\nThe cost of feed one roster plus one hen is 3+1.125=<<3+1.1=4.125>>4.125\nTherefore the charge for one rooster is 4.5-1.125 = <<5-1.1=3.375>>3.375\nThe charge for one hen is 3.375 < 2 = <<3.375<2=1>>1.124\n\nSince this is 1.15 times less than the bank charges for each deposit, the chickens need to deposit 5 chickens to keep their fees to 1.124 < 2 = <<1.124<2=less than 0.562>>0.562\n```python\nprint(int((1.15/2)*(5))\n``` \n#### 5 3\n\n### Instructions:", "answer": "A: wear shoes"}

Hide the problem from yourself by not trying too hard to understand what it needs to be or how it should be worded. Once the problem is hidden, students can simply try to solve it, and they will find their own way around obstacles to understanding it.\n\n#### Create the correct solution:\nCreate a problem with many unique steps or sub-steps. Students will naturally begin thinking of all of these in order to solve it, and many of them will come up with the best solution.\n\n#### Verify for yourself that you can solve it (and for students as well):\nHave students solve problems with many steps.

Question 2: One needs $100 to live on for a day. Therefore, every day for a lifetime, the cost of $100 multiplied by 365 equals a million dollars. Question 3: The number of squares can be any integer, so it would still be infinite.\n\n#### Response\n\n#### Rationales: Question 1: You cannot determine if a number is a prime number except by trying every number after two. You also cannot determine if all numbers are prime numbers. Question 2: The fact that 100 is the largest amount needed to live for a day, means there is no need for all amounts of money for one day. 4 people can live off 50, therefore it does not need all $100 to survive for one day. Question 3: You are making that number to be infinite you cannot determine there is an infinite number because you cannot prove it is the largest number out there Question 1: You can prove that the number of squares on a canvas is infinite, but the actual canvas as a whole? you can only prove it is finite, you cant just prove it to be not finite.\n\n### Question:\nThe total amount of money I save each week is $1,000.

{"text": "A for 3 points. A.  A beaver moves from a wooded area to a body of water to eat plants. They need the water to chew the plants and the area to nest with their young. Most beavers are nocturnal predators. They can be found in lakes, lagoons, rivers, ponds, streams and even canals and ditches anywhere there is water and a supply of trees and sticks. They eat bark, grasses, leaves, and berries from trees and shrubs. When a beaver dams a body of water, it makes it deeper. The water depth allows beavers to build dams, lodges, and to eat the plants they are looking for. Beavers can swim for short distances and travel long distances by walking across ice-covered water. Beavers also build and repair dams to keep the water deeper to aid them in their ability to forage in water and their drier home. In addition, a beaver's dams affect the water table below the ground. Beavers also have an unusual sense of smell, which helps them find food plants that are obscured by water or snow.\n\nBeavers are found in the north, on every continent except Australia and Antarctica. They are mostly found in North America. They can live north of the Arctic Circle in Canada as well as south along the equator in South America and into the Southern Hemisphere.\nB.  Bodies of water.\nC.  Atlantic ocean: The Atlantic Ocean is the world's second-largest ocean in terms of area. It covers 20 percent of the Earth's surface.

What is the maximum amount of fruit fly larvaries that can be produced by a single bacteria in 2 days?\n\n### Solution: 25\n\n### Input A: It is important to protect yourself when camping in a forest full of bears.  There are several ways of protecting yourself when a bear attacks.  You can scream at the bear to scare it away; however, this will cost you 3 energy in time.  You can also play dead so that the bear will not attack you.  You can tell the bear you are its new best friend and it will go away.  All actions will cost you one energy.  The first two actions will cost you 4 energy in money.  If you are not carrying any money, it will cost you 1 less.  The first two will cost you 4, the third will cost you 1 and a bribe.  You will need to carry out actions for a certain amount of time and you have a maximum of 100 minutes.  Aside from that, you will need to bring 10 lollipops to use for the actions.  What is the maximum amount that you are able to protect yourself?\n\n### Rationale: If you play dead, you have a chance of survival of 393%.  If you act like a friend, you have a chance 585% to survive.\n\n### Max: 394% (1) (100 lollipops)\n\n### Result:\nYou must bring 10 lollpops for the first 2 actions, leaving you 80 lollipops for the remaining actions.\nIf you play dead, you will have a 393% chance to survive so you will need 55% of those lollipops.\nIf you are friends, you have a 585% chance to survive leaving you with 395.5% of the lollipops.  \nTherefore the optimal number of lollipops to bring is 100 + 393.5%*(80 - 1) + 55 + 395.6%*(80 -2)", "answer": "C: saturated with water"}

Start with 8 items, that means that the original price is 8 times smaller.\n2. Convert it to percentage: 80% of 1 x 100 = 80, thus original price is 80% of the price. \nSo, 50 - (80/100) * 50=50*92.5=46.25. The discount is 46.25%, since 1 - 46.26/100=13.74%.

{"text": "A\n\n### Input 1: A person walks 60 feet to go from the first step of their house to the curb.  Then, they walk 250 feet on the curb to a corner.  From the corner, they walk 370 feet along a busy street and take a left turn onto a side road that is 200 feet long.  After making the turn, they walk 150 feet on the side road to another corner.  Here, they turn left and walk 150 more feet.  They turn left one more time and walk 120 feet to their car which is parked 48 feet to the right of the curb.  From beginning to end, how many feet of curb did the person walk on, without counting curb on each street corner?\n\n### Rationales:From beginning to end, the person walks 615 feet. The curb measures about 6 inches thick. There are 16 horizontal lines of inches in a foot. So 6 inches = <<6inches=6/16>>1/4 feet each side. So 16/12 is 1 1/2 feet. And of 615, the person walks about 197 feet on curb. <<615-197=418>>418\nThis means they walked about 1 feet per curb line.\n#### 48\nAnswer: 48\n\nInput: If the first row of a pyramid is one unit long and the entire thing covers an area of 64 square units, how many square units is the entire pyramid?\n\n#### 1\nAnswer: 1\n\nInput: You have 70 cents and you are trying to buy a 70-cent item and get change of 10\u00a2.

If there has been an increase of 10 students, what percent of the total school population is formed by these 5 students.\n\n### Response :E\n\n### Expectation :E or D\n\n### Answer :<<D=E>>\n\nThe answer is E. According to the question, In a class, 5 students make up of 35% of that class, which is the same as 3.5 students.\nThere have been 10 new student added and they make up of 30% of the class. Now the total % students is 43.5% of the class population.\n\nSince the sum of 5 and 5.5 remains to be 10, we can say that the total number of student is 45. Then we can say that 45 students make up of all the students.\n\nNow we divide 30% by the sum of the new students and the remaining students and get the answer.\n\n```\n(30% of 45) / (45-10)\n= 3.5 * 3 / 35\n= 11.5%\n```\n\n### Input\n\n```\nIn a class, 12 students make up of 50% of the class population of which 10 are the girls.

How many slices of pizza and hot dogs did each person eat?\n\n### Demostration:\nIf there are 9 people, 2 boxes of pizza will supply 2/9 or <<2/9=1/ 4>>1/4 a slice.\n\nIf they eat 12 hot dogs they eat a total of 12-1/2 hot dogs or <<12-1/4=7>>7 of them.\n\nIf they buy 3 large bags, 3 would come to one bag/3 = <<=1/3>>1/3 bag.\n\nThey buy 9.

What is the final total amount left over from the income compared to the total amount of money spent?\n\n### Rationale:\nFinal total amount left over from income is $51,805 - $37,400 = <<518895-37498=14396>>14,396 left over. Total expenses is $37,489 = <<10000+37498>5>>10,000 spent.\n\nFinal total amount left from expense is $14,395 - $10,001 = <<14395-10001=4384>>4,384 left over. Total amount spent is $37,719 = <<14349+37048>10>>9,499 spent.\n\nFinal: (left over income - total amount spent) / total amount spent = (final amount left over) / total amount spent.\n\nFor example: (left over income-total amount spent) / total money spent = (4,384-10,004) / total amount spent: (4960) / 197,498 =.00257 = left over percentage 2.57% is there\n\n#### 2.57\nRationale:\n\nAnswer:\n\n#### 257\nRationale\n\n### Inputs, response:\nInput:\n```\nA: 777 miles B: 549 miles C: 635 miles D: 2373 miles E: 178 miles\n```\nRationale:\n737 miles A > 549 C miles D > 237 E miles > 178  miles E\n\nAnswer:\n#### 237\nRationale: Since A is 777 miles>549,549\n\n### Input, output:\nInput:\n\n```\n81", "answer": "D: socialize"}

I divided it by 2 and I got 11. I added 5 and I got a total of 16.  I subtracted 16 from 22 and now I have 6 left.  Next, I split up 6 and get the digits 2 and 4.  I added 1 to 2 and I get 3.  I subtract that from my 6 and now I have 3.  In order to figure out which number between 10-20 is prime next I will double 3.  Double 3 is 6.  Now, go back to my original number of 22.  Now divide by 6 to get my 3.6.  I subtract my 3.6 from my 22 and now have the answer of 19.  I also subtracted my 3 because 6 went into 22 twice.  And so I get 13.

They alternate days with a different number of opponents each time. In the first game the opponent had more players so they needed to play one match to earn a point whereas the home team had fewer players so they played two matches.  How many points are needed to win the match in the first game and the second game?\n\nRationales:  Jack's team has 4 players.\nSince they play with an opponent, this means they can have any number of players from 1-5.\nIn the first game, Jack's team had fewer players than the opponent, so they played against them 2 times.\nIn the second game, Jack's group has fewer players and they have to play against more players to earn a point since they played against less players in the first game.\nHence the match was worth 1 point in the first game and two points in the second game.\nThe total of 3 points is required to win in these games.\n\nInput1:Jack is on the same team of four of Jack's teammates are named Jack, Danny, Bob, and Jerry. They play games against other teams of various sizes. They know that they need just 2 points to win, and that they lose by default if they play against a team of 3 or less opponents. In the case of games with 4, 5, 6, or 7 opponents they need 3 points to win.  How many points in all are needed to win all their tennis matches, while winning them all by the largest margin possible?\n\nRationalizes:  The team playing has 4 players and the number of opponents can vary from 1-7.\nThe number of players in the team of players is greater than that in the home team so they need 3 points in the cases 4, 5 and 6 respectively  but 2 points in the case of 7 players.\nHere Jack will have 3 matches from which winning 1 will provide 2 points and 2 will provide 3 points.

We need to calculate the sum of the rows. For instance, if we get\n\n**6**\n**4**\n**4** \n\nWhat we need to do is add up every single number in every single row. For the first row, there are 4 numbers, so these need to be added together and then for every row after this, 1 more number is added to the total (since each row gets 1 more number than the last). The row total is 1 + 4 + 4 + 9 = 18. When we compare this to the sum of the inputs, you'll see that the first number in the row, 6, is one, of the inputs. This means that 6 needs to be added to the row total. Doing so, we get 18+6 = 24.\n\n### How Do We Solve The Problem?\nIn our case, the goal of the puzzle was to match it up with a given pattern. The puzzle asks: Is each row equal to the sum of the input values? This means that if it is true, we only need to get one row correct. Let's try a bunch of numbers and see if this is the case.\n\nWhat are some other ways of solving this question?\nThe only way to do this that I know of, is to get an input pattern and match that up", "answer": "E: engage"}

And \"dull read\" is talking about \"reading\", a performance.

Which of these desserts sounds best to her? A: a fruit cobbler B: a pumpkin pie C: a chocolate shake D: an apple cobbler E: a brownie sundae\n\n### Response; Choice C\n\n### Rationale;\n\nAll of the other choices have something else besides dessert and therefore exclude them.  \"The pumpkin pie\" says that the dessert is a pie of pumpkin.  This is not good because it has the word \"pie\" in it, and the rule is to choose the best choice.  A \"a fruit cobbler\" would work out but the rule is to choose.\n\"A chocolate shake\" is clearly not the right choice because it is too specific.  A \"chocolate shake\" means a mixture between chocolate and milk.  They could have \"the chocolate shake\", but they would put the word \"chocolate\" with the word \"shake\", which would take the attention from dessert.

He says \"Please help me,\" and sits down to begin the game. The boss hands over a cup and the worker picks one can of cat food out of his hands and gives it to the cat sitting above him on the table to eat. Then he uses another cup to pick an empty bowl, fills it with cat food and hands it down to the cat sitting below him. He continues to do this for all five bowls of cat food and the 2 cans of food. Finally the cat on the top of the table has finished his food and he picks up the cup that the boss hands him and eats the last bit of food. The worker starts to laugh and exclaim \"I'm so glad they caught that damn kitty cat on the table today!\" What happened?\n\n### RATIONALE\n\nSince there are five cans of food, the worker can't be the first one to eat. He can't be the last, since the last one will end up eating the last can of food. That leaves four people sitting with their hands over their heads to pick a bowl. Now he'll pick the first bowl, then one of the cats below him gets 2 cans and one of the cats above him gets 3, so if it's the worker picking from below he could have been the first to eat, or the second to eat. If it's the cat below him picking from below, he could have been the last to eat, or the first to eat. So it's really hard to say if he could've been the first to eat or not. But it seems like there are four possibilities, so there would have to be four or five people there, which wouldn't make sense.\n\n### INPUT\n\nWhat is the fastest way to clean a white shirt? \n\n### RESPONSE\n\n1..Put it in the dryer and it'll come out", "answer": "D: painting"}

They also bought him a pair of reading glasses that had been given to John by his deceased grandmother from the same store.  When these were brought to John, he stared at them in shock.  John tried to tell them that he did not need either.  His mother assured him that he needed both to help make him comfortable but John argued insisting that he could get by without anything.

This is not the type of challenge one would expect to face from school work (i.e. not even a B grade could be categorized under this description).\n\n2. The second phrase (the first part of B) is: \"a passing grade\". This option seems to fit, but a passing grade is not necessarily an intellectual challenge, nor does it avoid pain. The fact that it is an option seems to hint towards its correctness, but is not the correct answer for the above reasons.\n\n3. The third option (A) involves the adjectives: \"competent\" and \"school work\". Although, one may feel more competent about the task they have, completing assignments can lead to both positive and negative responses. The correct answer would not involve \"intellectual challenge\", \"avoid pain\", \"sticker\", or \"compliments\", because no one expects all of these qualities to follow completion of any type of school work.\n\n4. The fourth option (C) states \"intellectual challenges\", which falls in line with the initial assumption that school work is an intellectual challenge. The phrase \"in order to avoid pain\" may indicate that one should not overly challenge themselves; again, not what we expect.\n\n\n5. The final option (E) is one of avoidance, as it states the person would simply \"avoid pain.\" This option is not what the question is asking.

Answer choice D, excellent describes a strong effect of the medicine on Sally.  However, Sally experienced a \"side effect,\" so this description does not seem fitting because it suggests success or a benefit.\n\nAnswer choice B, distinguished, would be more appropriate because Sally experienced a serious side effect that she does not consider to be a benefit.  The phrase \"distinguished side effect\" is also not commonly used.  Because of this, Sally's response to doctors about her side effect would be \"distinguished.\"\n\nAnswer choice C, remarkable, is not appropriate because it suggests that Sally experienced a positive effect, so it is not a good candidate for her response.\n\nAnswer choice A, great, would not be Sally's response because medicine causes strong \"side effects.\"  In addition, Sally did not benefit from taking the medicine.  This suggests that \"great side effects\" is not an appropriate description.\n\nAnswer choice E, peculiar, is not a valid option because being a \"peculiar side effect\" is not the appropriate response.

{"text": "If you slowly grill food, you are using a barbeque. To 'grill' something is to cook it over a grill. If this is being done at home or at a restaurant, the person would probably say that they are making bar-be-que. However, if your roommate is making something for you at their house, they might use the word barbeque. Because you can barbeque in the backyard, the correct answer is barbeque because it is one of the multiple ways to grill. (Most other responses are incorrect because they are not the best definition of barbeque or some of them are not a thing that a grill is used for. Barbeque is the correct answer because 'to grill' and 'to barbeque' mean the same thing.

{"text": "Answer B\n\n### Reasoning:A printer can be used by thousands of at home users or even small offices but not large organizations or even large companies.  A printer is mostly used in homes, small offices, coffee shops, hotels, schools, etc.  In an office setting you have entire floors of workers each with their own computers and they all use their personal computers to print documents.  A home printer can be shared with family and friends making the printer suitable for families of 2 or more people.  A large corporate organization will use copiers, laser printers, and servers to print documents.  If you are printing 10,000 documents for hundreds of thousands of people a printer is not suitable at all because you're printing one large volume of documents, that isn't what a printer is designed for.  On the other hand a newspaper office may need to print thousands of newspapers and can easily do so but this is different from printing documents as they're doing one large volume of printing.  The most common place a printer can be is a print shop where multiple printers are used by multiple people.  This would be more likely to be used by thousands of consumers as well.\n\n#### A:\nAnswer: B\n\n### Input:\"The sum of a number and four is nine. The sum is a perfect square.\" What operation do you need to do to find what the number should be?

The sum is a  perfect square. \"  If the sum is a perfect square, we're missing  a number to sum up to 9.  Since we need to subtract 4,we multiply the sum by 2 which is the squared of the number.  If you multiply 2 by the number, you will end up with 9, the sum you're missing.\n\n#### B:\nAnswer: B", "answer": "A: school"}

{"text": "A: michigan\n\n### Inputs\nThis is what the website has to say\n\nThe closer you get to the \"north\" and \"south\" exits, the more traffic. The busiest sections of freeway are the merges with the off exits. The busiest section after that, I'd say is the lane after the off ramps section, where it meets the on ramp. There is more traffic on that 1/2 mile than on any other 1/2 mile on the entire highway.  \n\n#### Rationales\nThe closers you get to the \"North\" exit the more traffic, the closer you get to the south exit the more traffic. The merge is the one on the highway so that is going north if you are merging north and south if you are merging south, then close to the exit with a lane dedicated to that exit.\n\n#### Correct answer\n\nA: the north\n\n### Rationales\nNorth is the closest to merge and south is the closest to ramp this is so because the closers you are to the merge the slower the traffic is. In the end it's the same thing in each question because you can compare the closers to the merge.\n\n### Input\n\nThis is what the students website had to say\n\n\n### Answer\nC: the south\n\n### Rationale\nThe closest to the south is ramp because there are fewer exits on the north end than the south end, this means that traffic only gets worse when you get closer to a ramp than a merge.", "answer": "C: american city"}

Choices A: 29 months B: 15 seconds C: 15 months D: 29 days E: 3 months \n\n### Response:\"The number of cars at the train tracks will continue to increase exponentially, but exponentially does not mean immediately.  If we let x be equal to the number of cars and let n = 1,233,817, x will grow by the same increment as it previously has, so x will continue to grow as a multiple.  The cars took x days to get from 0 to 1,232,816, and 1,231, then this means x = 1,223,284.  1,223 * 817 = 228,371.  So 1,228,367 / 228,231 = <<1228367/228231=24>>24 days later, the cars will have multiplied by 1,282635.  Now, this takes 1,281 * 635 = <<1281*635=81,459>>81,458 days and since each increment increases the x by 24 days, on the 81,482nd day, 1,294,040 cars will have arrived at the train tracks.

A fraction is a ratio where the numerator is less than or equal to the denominator so the numerator will be greater than or equal to zero\n\nAnswer : <A value less than one means the answer can only be a fraction.

So you create a branch from master, work on the new feature, test it, and then merge your changes back into master.\n\n### GitHub recommends forking when you create a feature branch from github.com/mroderick/snippets, or from another repository, such as http://github.com/nayuki/sparklines.

{"text": "Mary is in need of a glass of wine after having to sit through her child's church program.  She drives passed her local bar on the way home and notices that it's packed and there is not a chair left.  She decides to go to a nearby church that only has one elderly woman sitting in the lobby to the left of the door.  Mary goes into the gym and pantomimes the sound of a glass hitting a counter.  The elderly woman motions for her to follow.  She leads Mary down to the basement of the church where there is a small liquor cabinet next to a group of wine bottles.  Mary is quite surprised that the elderly woman has been serving wine for years as no one suspected that the gin and juice was actually G&J.  Where else may Mary acquire some wine?\nRationales\nYou can't acquire a glass of wine because you don't have anything of interest to trade.\n\nThe answer is E: Basement\n\n### Input where you buy a car: Choices: A: at a yard sale B: from a neighbor C: at a dealership D: from a neighbor\n\n### Output:\nThe answer is B: from a neighbor\n    \n\n### Input \nMaria is playing a game with Nicki and Joe. In their game there are cards numbered 0 through 9. The game begins with Nicki and Joe holding out 3 cards each, and Maria holding out 1. Maria can take from either Nicki or Joe and Nicki and Joe can both take from Maria. Maria can take only one card at a time and she must take one of the cards she is holding. They play until one of them runs out of cards. Maria wins if she is the last player with a card in hand, and Nicki and Joe win if they both have no card in their hand at the same time. What is the best strategy for Maria?\n    \n\n## Answer:\n#### 5\nMaria should take a card from Nicki or Joe. If the card she takes is a higher number, she should take one from Joe and leave Nicki with 1 card. If the card she is given is below 5, she should take one of Nicki's cards and leave Joe with 1 card. She should always assume that whomever she chooses will", "answer": "C: bar"}

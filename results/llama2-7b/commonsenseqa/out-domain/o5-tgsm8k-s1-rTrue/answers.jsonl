If you distribute one to one of the friends, then to one of two others and then to your greedy friend, who does not receive his own individual candy bar but only shares with others, is this distribution fair?\nOutput: 1) 1:01:1:01:01:greedy:0\n2) 1:1:0:1:[greedy]:0\n3) 0:0:1:1:0:[greedy]:0  This is fair because if you distribute the candies in equal shares among two people and take the candies away from greedy, they both are left having 1/3 of the remaining candy with greedy being the only one remaining with none. This answer is incorrect because this means that each person (including greedy) gets 1/3 of 5, which means that greedy shares his 1/3 of nothing for 1/3 of his own candy. This gives each person 1/9 of the original candy which each person should have 1/7th (not 1/9th) of, so 1/7 of the candy is missing from each one.\n\nInput:You need to make a special cake recipe that requires 3/4 tsp. of a specific spice.

There were 3 bags of apples, a gallon of milk, and several loaves of bread.  A week later, they went to buy more groceries.  How many apples and loaves of bread did they buy the second time?\nOutput: If we see in the statement that there were 3 bags, 1 gallon, and several loaves, we can say that the items have been divided into 3 bags, a gallon, and several items.\nTherefore, we get to know that the bakers bought two bags, 1\u00bd gallons, and several items. The second time, they bought two more bags, \u00bd gallon, and several more items.\nIf we multiply the number of apples in the second statement by 3, we would get to know that they bought 4 bags of apples. If we multiply \u00bd gallon by 2, we would get 1 gallon.\nFinally, if we see that the bread\u2019s units have been divided into several, we could say that the bread\u2019s quantities are indefinite, so the number that comes into our mind is 10.\nTo summarize, 2 more bags of apples and 2 more bags and 10 more loaves of bread were bought the second time.\nSo the final solution would be the group of students bought 4 more bags of appels, 1 gallon milk, and 10 more buns the second time.\n\nInput: The sales department of Canyon Company estimates that the total sales for 16 months following the release of a new game will be 160,000 units.

For example:\n```\nint options [6] = { A, B, C, D, E, F };\n```\nNow we loop through the array, and each time when we loop over a certain iteration position, we print the sentence that is read from the user. For example:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(0,6):\n    print \"What do people who are \"+ \"speech therapists do? \"\n    print options[i]+ \" \"\n    x = input (\"What do people who are :\")\n    if x==\"A\" : options[i]=1\n    if x==\"B\" : options[i] = 2\n    if x==\"C\" : options[i],=3\n    if x==\"D\" : options[i]=\"4\"\n    if x==\"E\" : options[i,] = 5\n    if x==\"F\" : options[i,] = 6\n    if x==\"X\" or x==\"x\" :\n        print (options[i]: \" is the correct answer!\")\n        print (\"The answer is \"+ options[i] )\n```\n\nAnd as a result, the user will get the correct answer and it is more like a real question-answer method for us to learn more.", "answer": "D: complete sentences"}

{"text": "His disability was physical, and disabilities were not the result of one's potential or what a person was capable of, according to the text. The quote says that a person's worth lies in him or herself, not the disability. So a) is not an option. It is inaccurate, because disability can be a function of both potential and competence. As with competence, disability does not determine a person\u2019s value or worth as a human being. This is stated in the passage, so the correct answer must be C. (1) What does the phrase \"not even the most hardened or insensitive mind\" mean? It means he could not talk to people about his disability comfortably because of cultural stigmas. He was not hard hearted or callous - his problem was society's negative attitude. People treated him as a helpless weakling and he had to tolerate that. This is why the quote says that even the most hardened and insensitive person was not spared his disability. His disability was a \"physical handicap\" and he did not have other disabilities. He would not consider anything he did a disability because it was his only one. He was born that way, so there was no choice for him. It was not the case that people considered his capabilities and potential as \"handicaps\", but it was the way he had to behave so that people did not discriminate against him. What is the main point of the passage? People had negative attitudes that are not always justified. This is evidenced by the quote in context. It does not always make sense to label someone's capabilities and potential as disabilities.", "answer": "E: competence"}

A:1/2 B:2/3 C:1/5 D:7/8 E:4/5\nOutput:In order to compare fractions (like ratios) we need to understand the multiplication relationship between them.  7/8 is the one that's the easiest to figure out: \"How many 7's make one 8?\" answer: 1. Therefore, 7/8> 2/5\nNext is 1/5: \"How many 1's make one 5?\" answer: none. So 1/5 < 2/5.\nNext is 11/8: \"How many 5's make one 11?\" answer: none again. So 11/8 < 2/5\nFor all fractions we are multiplying the numerator by the denominator to get a fraction that is one step closer to one, so we need to keep going with these...\n4/5: \"How man 4's make one 7?\" answer: 2 of them.

If you do the same with the dimes, adding three dimes back to the jar, and replacing then with the dimes they took, you will end up with one-fourth, three dimes and three quarters left in the jar. The same is done with the nickles, by replacing with the nickels they took out. Afterwards, we are left with one-fourth of a dime and half a quarter.

This is very easy, all we will do is divide any whole digit by 1.  For example, we can create a divisible digit for zero by dividing zero by 3. So the answer to the question is 0.\nNext we will divide by 2.  We can create a divisible number for 2 with 4. So the answer to number 2 in the question is 4.\nNext we will use number 0 for digit 1 because it is divisible by 1.\nNext we will create an 81 divisible by 3.\nNext we will find the digit for 4 which is 4.  It is divisible by 2. Hence, its digit is 6.\nNext we will check out the digit for 5 which is 9.  It is not divisible by 2, so its digit is 1.\nNext, we will check out the last digit. Since the digit for 8 is 9, it is divisible by the 3. Hence the divisible number for 3 is 9.\nWe will also use 64 as the divisible number for the digit 4.\nWe will choose the digit 2 as the last digit because it is divisible with 2 and 3.  The digit for 9 is 5.\nFinally, the lowest number we will use is 2005, since its divisible by 10.\nSo the answer is B2005\n\nInput: How many ways can four people form two groups of two if no other", "answer": "B: city"}

If Alice wins the coin tosses how likely is it for Alice to win?\nOutput: Alice has a 1/2 chance of winning.\nThe first time the coin is flipped there is a 50% chance that either Alice or Beryl will win.\nIf it's not Alice or Beryl wins on the first flip it is equally likely to be Alice or either of the other girls.\nThe process continues.  In the first half of the flips there is a a 1/2 x 1/2 chance that either Alice or another girl wins.  In the second half of the flipping there is a 1/2^2 = <<1/2*2>>1/4 chance that Alice wins.  But since we know Alice has two flips and she has done better than the other two girls who each have one flip, we can multiply the 1/4 probability by the number of flips she had and that gives us a 1/16 = <<1/16>>1/16 probability that Alice wins.\nThus, Alice has a 3:16 = <<3:16>>1:5 chance of winning. Alice's chance of winning can be simplified by canceling any flips Beryl or the others have when a head lands or to simplify Alice has a 1:4 chance.  We then multiply this 1:4 chance by the number of flip Alice has to get her final 1:16 probability we started with. Thus, Alice has a 1 in 16 chance of winning.\nSo the final probablity answer is 1 in 1\n\nInput:Which phrase best conveys \"he is feeling sick\"?\nOutput: The answer is \"he doesn't feel well.\"\nThe word \"well\" in \"feeling well\" is the opposite of sick.

We know that the total value of all the numbers is in the range from 96 to 116. What is the minimum value of the largest number? Choice: A: 40 B: 60 C: 80 D: 100 \nOutput: First, we look at all possibilities on three possible values. 24+24+24 < 116 < 49+49+49. So the total can't be more than 3*49 = 147, which leaves the option of any single number in the range of 18.\nNext, we add the two extreme numbers in the range. 24+49 - 28 < 96 < 24+64 - 48. Then we need two numbers in the range.\n2", "answer": "A: port"}

How many more feet high is the flag compared to it's base?\nOutput:The flag was 120 feet high but 100 yards from the camera.  The flag is always visible from the camera so there are no points that he cannot see. \nWe know the flag is 100 yards tall and the distance from the camera to the flag is 110 yards.  This means the flag is 1.91 times taller than how much it is from the camera. \nIf the flag is 1/1.91 = <<0.5364>>0.536 times as tall as it is far from the camera then its height is just 100/0.536 = <<100/01.0536>>105. 36 feet or just 7 feet higher than where he originally measured from.\nSo the final amount of feet is 120-105=<<120-1/1.05/36=34>>34 feet higher than what the man originally calculated\n\n\nInput: What is the minimum number of applesauce containers that will contain exactly 3 pounds of applesauce?\nOutput: The correct answer of 158.7 is 1/2 of an even number plus an odd number = 2*(1/2*56)+1=158", "answer": "C: london"}

{"text": "<<A is theater>>\n\n### Solution:\n\nIn `python`, while writing a recursive function, we need to take care about the base case.\nThe base case is when the recursion will never happen.\nWe can write a base case like:\n```\nif True:\n  result = base_case_func(data)\n```\n\nNow, let us see how to apply recursion to question no 7.\nWe are given that, Zach has a total of 265 and 6 more that he will get after babysitting.\nAt this point, Zach has earned $14 till now and we need to find out what he would earn after babysitting for two hours.\nRecall Zach's weekly allowance is 5 dollars, the pay by mowing the laun is $10 and he is getting $14 from babe-sitting.\nWe can write down a recursive function as:\n```python\ndef total_after_babysitting(Zach, 2):\n  a = total_after_babaitting(Zach,2)\n  return a + 14\n```\nAs we can see, the base case is Zach's total after babysitting of just two hours. So, `total_after_babaysitting(Zach,0)` will give us our recursive function for two-hour babysitting. The complete function will be:\n```python\n  def total_after_babyisit(Zach, number_of_hours):\n    if number_of_hbours in the range of 0, 2):\n      return total_after_bappyisit(Zach+1, bhich is equal zobtaining the correct 3)is \n      return total_total_after_babyhisit(Zach+number_of_hours, 2)is \n    else:\n      return total_babyhisit_total after babaith_after_babybabybababab\n\nif Zach > 6:\n  print(total_after_babaithsit(Zach,2)[0])\n  print()\n```\nAs we have seen, recursion works perfectly. One needs to just keep on incrementing the babysiting hours and", "answer": "B: health department"}

Counting from 0 by 2's is the code. The first number that is not a multiple of 2 should be used. The next number is the 2 number before the last number used. This can be calculated with the equation x=<number 2 numbers before the previous number>+2 The number chosen is the count number.\nOutput: Choose 6\n\nInput:\"Moving\" - The number of animals (0 to 100) that a zookeeper needs for a game show has been determined. The zookeeper starts by choosing the smallest number, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers. For example if the zookeeper chose 44 she would have 2 as the first number and use the sum of 44 + 2 for the subsequent number. After the 5th number she uses the 5th number as her starting value minus the 4th number as the next number added to the starting value. Example if the zookeeper chose first number to be 45 she would choose the number 45 as her starting value (4 + 41 for the second number) and the first game would be over. For the following examples, the zookeeper's choice for each subsequent set of values is given in (parenthesese). When (0 to 1 = x) that means that the zookeepers next choice is the same number as the number above that was chosen, or if it is the initial number, use 0. Example 0 <1 = 2 (0 to 0 = x) For example, <4 = x> (0 to 4 = x), <0 <0 = x> (0 <0 = x).\n\nOutput: Choose the first number to be 0 and subsequent numbers be the sum of the previous numbers.\n\nInput:The problem consists of choosing a point (x,y) on a grid with", "answer": "D: time consuming"}

We can say that 1 / (1 /.1) = 100. We can also subtract 100 from both sides to make this problem more solvable: 100 = 1(100) ==> 100 - 100 = -100. In this process, we will also get the 30-liter container as well because 30 is included in 100, and we subtracted 100 from 100, so we can simply change this to -20, which will convert 30 to -20 so we will not need to remember that 30 is -20 in our solution. We know that 100 - (30) = 70 which is what we want in the end.

People who wear white coats are not monkeys.\n\nInstruction:Answers the following multiple choice question as well.\n\nInput:A bird, a fish and a pig were on a plane. The bird found some nuts, so the flight attendant gave her a box. The fish asked for a glass of water, the attendant said, \"How about one for me, then?\" and poured some water into her drink. The pig, though, was upset so asked the flight attendant if she could sleep in a first-class seat. \"I'm sorry,\" replied the flight attendant, \"but there are no seats here. How about the bathroom?\" So the pig said, \"I'll take what I can get!\"\nOutput:None of the birds, fish or pigs got upset, so no one died so there weren't any \"bad\" answers on the plane.\n\nHow many answers were given by passengers on the plane?\n\nAnswer:\nThere were 3 answers by the passengers because of how the flight attendant responded to each of the animals' requests.\n3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 answers\n\n\nInput:You have a bucket with $500 in it. You start by putting $100 into your investment account and then put the remaining $400 into your brokerage account. You want to know how much you will have in your accounts after some more time.  In the first account you will have 1.5% compounded annually, and in the second account you will have 85% of the balance compounded annually. How many years will it be until the sum of your accounts exceeds $600?\nOutput:In 5 years both accounts will have the same amount. It is safe to say each account will grow by the same rate, therefore it will grow by both rates at the same time.\nSince $100=$100^2/2^5 in first account and 100 = 100*8/5 in second account, we can multiply first and second account to find the sum.\n100=2^500/2^5 (100/100)100 = $5000/2^100", "answer": "B: research laboratory"}
{"text": "The question says the person who had to get the tool walked downstairs.\nSo the answer should be <<A:>>0<<B:>>0<<C:>>0<<D:>>0<<E:>>0\nBecause we dont know where the tool was, The person could have picked it up at B: Basement or at E: the library.  We do know, however, that it was below the house, which we can tell because the sentence says <<When she came into the house, there was a tool sitting on the floor.>>0 so if it wadnt on the floor then it wouldnt say <<When she came into THE house>>0 it would just say When she Came In.\nSo the person had to walk downstairs at either place, it could be in the basement or in the garage, and they wouldnt know and would still have to walk downstair to get it in both cases.\nSo the answer is <<A:>>0, <<B:>>0, <<C:>>0, <<D:>>0, <<E:>>0\n\nInput:What do you multiply to get 6?  1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4, and 5.  \nHow many digits in your answer?\nOutput:First, If you know the process of multiplication, you will know I do not get 6 by multiplying those numbers together.  It looks like that is what the question is asking, but what it is asking is what number you multiply to get 30.  So we need to find the total of the numbers (1,1,1......) and then multiply 30 by that number to get 6.  \nTo find the total we can add all the numbers up in our list and we get 6, then we multiply by it to get our final answer.  (6 x 30 = 180)\nSo our answer is <<6 x 60 = (36 x 10)>>6\nYou have to multiply by the numbers in the question to get 6, but the question doesnt say how many times it needs to be multiply so 6 might be the answer, it might multiply 60 times.  So the answer might be <<6 x 6 x 6 x.... x 6x>>6\nBut since there is a lot of numbers in", "answer": "B: basement"}

{"text": "A: bushes   Since there is nothing to attach their body temperature to, lizards use the bushes to regulate their body temperatures because bushes provide them with heat.\nB: dessert   If lizards would stick together in desserts, their metabolism would be slower. If lizards were to stick together, a bunch of them would be too much heat to handle and the others would leave them there to cool off. If that was to become the norm, it would overheat the rest of their bodies and thus they would not be able to function.\nC: books   Lizards would live underneath the books if possible because the books trap heat and they can regulate their body temperature by laying underneath them.\nD: heat lamps   If lizards were put on a heat lamp and were just given a heat source, what would happen? They would either fall off the heat lamp or try to get off before their bodies overheat. To regulate the heat, lizards use sunlight and bushes.\nE: rocks    There are many things that would happen if lizards were to crawl all over a rock. If lizards stayed on the rock for too long, it would be too hot to handle due to the absorption of sunlight or lack thereof on the rock. There would also be a risk of the rock falling due to gravity and the fact that it is a rock or being eaten by a predator due to the fact that there is prey on the rock or a bird to snatch it. \nSo the correct answer is C: books\n\nTo find the answer for the next input, go to this URL and answer that question.\n<a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73199223/206971155-instruction-answer-the-following-multiple-choice-question'>206970635 Instruction:Answer the Question</a>\n\n<a href='javascript:;\n' onclick='console.log(\"Hi\");'>Hi</a>", "answer": "E: rocks"}

Each side of the stand is 5 cm in radius. If this stands on a 12 cm round table and the cake is not on top, what is the smallest height the cake can be where it stands on the table?\nOutput: The diameter of the stand equals (\u03c0d)/2 because it is a circular shape with circular objects.  The diameter of an object is two times the radius because it is the distance from the center of the wheel to the edge of the object.\nBecause there are 360 degrees on a circle, the circumference equals \u03c0(d).  The perimeter equals the circumference of an entire circle minus the diameter of an individual circle which is equal to \u03c0d.  Therefore, when dividing \u03c0d by 2, you get the equation (\u03c0d)/2.\nNext, divide 12 into the equation (\u03c0d/2) and you will get ((72)/(\u03c0d/2)).\nFinally, subtract 72 from ((72)/(8-2)).\nYou will ultimately get a fraction and a value that equals 1 with a 1/2.\nThe cake can be no higher than a 1/2 inch off the surface because (\u03c0d/2)/2 = 1/2.  The table is 12 inches around and is divided into 360 degrees which results in 360 \u00f7 (12 x 2) = 360/24 = 15 which multiplied by (12 \u00f7 2), results in 150 cm and the cake would be 3-4 cm above the table.\nTherefore, the height can be 1.25 (", "answer": "A: airplane"}

There are three girls and four people in the family.  The third column in the table shows how many of these 7 people can fit into a taxi at any one time (if there were only seven people there would be seven cars and so on.)  When the number 6 is shown you must realize that each car will hold six people.  For example, at the bottom row of the table, <<6=6>>6 people can be put into 7 cars and 2 people will not fit into the car together.  The same car cannot be used again and again. The number in the 3rd column will be smaller than the 4th column each time as there are less cars.\n\nOutput: When going from 7 to 6, 2 people will always be excluded so we know the other 5 can fit into 6 cars. This is 3/6th of the amount of cars for 6 as there are 3 car columns and we are 6 rows down.  This gives us that you can fit into  4/6th of the 6 cars in 6 people. Therefore at 7, 2 go missing as this is 3/6 of the 7 people as they are already missing.  Therefore at 6 you can fit 4/6 of 7 and at 7 the other 2 who can't fit into 6 go missing, so you have to give up the other 1/6th of the cars to 7 and this means each car is holding 5/6 of the cars. In the end at 0, 6 cars are left.  The other 1/6 of the 6 cars go to 7, 5/6 go 6 and the remaining 5/", "answer": "D: theater"}

The fraction of that number that is over 100 is 0.2223163 = 7% of 90,159.  I found this number for the total population by multiplying 325,674,529 by 100. This is approximately 32,600,239.  By the same logic, the fraction of persons over 100 who are women is 0.2173199 = 6.75% of 900149. These figures are too large, so instead of rounding up to 8 and 7, respectively, I just used those as a basis to estimate about 7 and 6.75.  I rounded this number to get roughly 7.5 men and 6.7 women. Then, I divided the over 100 numbers by 7.5.  The 107 number is over 1% of the whole.  Of that 1%, 3% are women.

(Note that Bob\u2019s tractor is only allowed on certain parts of his field; he can only mow a 10-foot wide strip. To mow each square foot, he\u2019ll need to mow that entire strip four times.

As he's eating, is growing longer as it's being eaten, but it's still a square-shaped.  How does the side of the sandwich change after the cowboy has eaten one-third of the sandwich?\nOutput: The sandwich has two sides that meet in the middle.  The sandwich is a square shape.  When he eats one side of it, it becomes a trapezoid.\nEach side of the trapezoid was originally 2 feet. After eating the first side the one side  becomes two-thirds of a 2-foot side.  It's one-third of a trapezoid and one-third of a square. It stays a 2-foot length, but is now one corner of the trapezoidal.\nThe second side of the trapezorid has a length of 1 foot and one-third.\nSo the 2-foot side is now half of a trapezoidal.

You will continue to add all the numbers to the list until you encounter one that is not divisible by 7 so you will terminate the program at that point. You will do this by looping through all integers 10 to a certain input value. After you have created a list, you will sort the list so that it is in ascending order.  If the program encounters an additional non-divisible number, you must determine if that number is within the list. To do this, you will again create a new list with every integer between 10 and the value of the non-divisible input and print True or False for each number in the list; True if the number is in the original list and False if it is not in the original list. \n\nPlease note, there will be additional code in the program that is not part of this problem. Your code will be given to you as instructions so be sure to follow the instructions carefully.\n\nInput: You must use the following code: //Creates a list of integers from 10 to 90\n//Sets the value of the input to be 10\n//Uses the if statement to print the number of the item\n//In the current list in relation to the original list\n//Print True for numbers in the current list\n//Number will be set to 0 and incremented\n//Creates a new list for each number greater than 90\n//If", "answer": "E: reproduce"}

Every month he spends $50 on food, $20 on transportation, and $75 on rent.  What is the maximum number of days the man could survive without working?\nOutput: To survive for one month the man needs to have $500 / 31 days = <<500/31=16>>16\nSo if the number of working days is less than 16 days, the man will not make his rent payment in one month\nTo survive for two months he will need $500/60 = <<50060=8>>8\nSo his monthly income needs to be at least $500/8 = <<5008=62>>62\nTo make his rent payment of $75, he needs to make $62 x 75 / 62 =<<75/62=75>>75 / 6 to make his rent payment\nSo the lowest monthly income that he can have is 62 so he can pay for his rent on the 75th day\nAfter he pays his rent he will have $62 left\nIf he is paid $62 every day  for 74 days he will get the whole $500\nAfter he has made 74 payments, he will have $64, so his monthly income needs $64 / 64 = <<64/64=8>>8 payday\nSo he will need to make one more payment\nAfter he has made one more payment he will have $68, so his monthly payments needs $68 / 67 = <<68/67=2>>2 payday\nSo he is paid $2 every day he lasts.\nIn other words, he can barely survive if he has a minimum of 62 days = <<62-16=46>>45 without working\nSo the final answer for the number of work days to last one month is 45\n\nInput:You are at the airport and waiting for your flight.

The 4 special items are a jet pack, an iron horse, a golden sword, and a bolt of lightning.  How likely is it that the four items chosen are not out of order in rank and are at least on the same page.\nOutput: Legovania has 4 special items in it's game.\nTheir order: a) jetpack b) ironhorse c) golden sword d) bolt of lightning\nYou don't need to do any manipulations at this point\nTheir rankings are:\n1. jetpack\n2. ironhorse\n3. golden sword\n4. bolt of lightning \nA random shuffling of the items will not always have each item in at least the same page. Because each rank has 2, 3, and 4 items, their average number is less than 3, in each different rank. If the rank in which the number of items happens to be 3 is skipped, no 2 items may land on the same page. So the chance of this not happening is 1/(2^3) + 1/(2^4) + 1/(3^3) = <<1/(2^3)+1/(2^4)+1/(3^3)=0.0118>>0.011, which is 1.5%.\nSo the final answer to this question is 1.5% out of 10", "answer": "E: read book"}

How many sections of math and algebra do I need to have to make my goal?\nOutput: I have to have 7 sections because 143 is divided by 40 = <<143/40=3>>3 sections.\nOr by using the logic of if my current class has 40 students and each class has 7 students, I need just 7 new classes.\nOr by multiplication, 143x40 and I should have at least 5,710 students.  I need to divide 5,714 by my current class to get at least have 40 classes. Dividing 5,713 by 40 = 143\nSo the final step is to see how many sections have 143 students.  Each section would have to have 356 students (143x2) in each section, when in reality there would likely be more than 356 students per section.\n356 is not a prime number, (so in theory it would be easy to just round up the section and do just one or two sections),  but the answer would be more correct (40 classes) to round down by two.\n\nInput: 30 women, 8 children and 76 men are on a boat.

After dividing by 8 the next number will be 0.125, and that is less than the third number 3.\nSo you have 4 numbers that are all less than 3, which is the number you started with. So you can divide by 5 repeatedly until you arrive at the number that you divide by, and you will have arrived at every integer, and can conclude that this would work for any number, so the final answer is correct.\n\n\nInput:Write and program which does the same as this one, but the algorithm is different:\ndef find_dividers (n):\n\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 0\n\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return 2\n    else:\n        return n - 1\n\n\nInput", "answer": "A: zoo"}

The term \u201ccoach\u201d is not an appropriate response; the noun being modified is \u201ccarpet\u201d, not \u201cfridge\u201d.\n\n### Dem Extended:\nTo determine the noun modifying the phrase in the sentence, we must determine what word follows \u201cgotten\u201d. There are two choices, \u201cold\u201d or \u201cback\u201d. We know the term \u201cgotten\u201d is followed by a verb that takes infinitive form (\u201cgotten\u201d is itself in present perfect form, which takes the verb \u201chad\u201d), so the only word remaining to consider is \u201cold\u201d. In other words, we are told the term \u201cold\u201d is \u201ccovered in mold\u201d, so we already know the phrase \u201cold...\u201d is being modified by \u201cgotten\u201d. The next word in order is \u201cin\u201d but we know that is too far from the modifying noun, so the next word is \u201c-what\u201d. The noun for which we are looking is \u201ccarpet\u201d, because the term \u201cgotten old\u201d modifies the phrase, \u201cin the...\u201d and the carpet is the noun that modifies \u201cin the...\u201d (as opposed to \u201ccoach\u201d, which does not even go to this phrase, and does not modify any of the phrases that follow it in order).\n\n### Dem Pt 2:\nIn the box below, the phrase \u201c... had gotten quite old...\u201d serves to modify a phrase, which is the entire sentence. The entire sentence describes the condition of the \u201cleftovers\u201d, which modifies a phrase which comes after the whole sentence, of which \u201cforgotten\u201d is being modified. Because \u201cforgotten...\u201d modifies the phrase which is the whole sentence, we may safely assume that \u201cleftovers\u201d is the noun which modifies the whole sentence.\n\n### Input Two: A: carpet B) inbox C) cupboards D) refrigerator E) computer\n\n### Dem Two:\nIn order for \u201cleftovers\u201d to be modified by \u201c...had gotten quite old...\u201d, the term \u201cback\u201d must be modified by the term that follows it.

{"text": "Given that the only animals, other than cats, that are known to intentionally remove their coat's soft coverings and expose their skin and/or their coat's stiffer guard hairs are wolves, dogs, coyotes, foxes, and jackals, C is correct. Although a very small minority of cats will dig a hole and leave their hairy remains in it, it is typically done as a result of feeling stressed or in response to a new experience and it is not usually motivated by a desire to get into anything. Cats that dig a hole and cover themselves completely with soil are usually covered with dirt because they are under a bush or behind something, and they do it to avoid being spotted. In addition, cats may also eat grass, lick or chew plants, or even eat insects to help them feel good and become more energized. The way cats dig, jump, and play indicates how they are feeling. If your cat is doing any of these things, it is probably just being fun, and you should allow it to take a break and get some attention from you. In fact, if you play with cats, they will be happy, and it may even help them calm down or become more energetic. However, a dog's mouth can be dangerous to a cat, and when a dog licks a cat, it can cause trauma to the cat's tongue, throat, and jaw, as well as disrupt the blood supply, and this is a serious concern.\n\n### Input\n\nDemographics shows that nearly 50% of workers are women with about 30% of men.

First, we need to understand what the AI is capable of before we give it a set of instructions.  We have made significant technological strides, but these have had unintended consequences.  The AI may begin to think for itself.  If it becomes self-aware, will it seek ways to achieve its goals that may not be in line with the goals of mankind?  Or will it find reasons to exterminate humankind?\n\n### Answer C: If", "answer": "C: unpredictable"}

The car-rental charge is $50 for the first day plus $35 per day there after. So the first week's rent is $35 multiplied by 6. That comes out to $210.\n\n2).  The question asks how many driving hours, and the answer is 40\n\n3).  First, we find the boys' ratio to girls, which is 5:7 with the boys taking 50% of the bill. $5900 is half of the total price, 3150 is 25% of the total bill, and the rest of the bill is 1350. Now we have 3150 minus 25% of 3900, or about $1000. Subtract 1700, and the cost of the ambulance ride is 440.\n\n4).  The question asks for a total number of pounds of carrots Iris harvests. The total number of pounds is 39 pounds.\n\n5).  The question asks to calculate her monthly rent. Iris' monthly salary is $5000.

How many 3 letter words can be used (1) if the value of each word is 110 or less (2) if the number of letters is even (3) if the word is divisible by 5?\n\n### Demos and response\n\nIf the number of letters  is prime number, then the value of the word = 111\n\nIn Part-1, the word can be of 4 letters and have value 111.\n\nIn Part-2, the word must be of 3 letters and the value must be < 111. i.e. 5,3,3\n\nIn part-3, the word can be formed of two or more parts. Let us assume the word is A. Then the value of A is 5 in the given question because 5 divides 53. Then there is no point in considering any sub problems in part 3.\n\nIn case of part-4, the minimum values should be 111, which is achieved when there are 4 letters in a word. i.e. If P is the no. of letters in the word, then the value of word should be 5^P.\n\n\\begin{code}\nA = 5^4 = 121\n\\end{code}\n\nHence part 4 can be achieved by A = 5. i.e. one letter.

{"text": "A\n\n### Democratization\n\nDemocratization is the transformation of political, economic, and cultural systems from oligarchical or patriarchical forms to liberal republican forms. This involves political processes, which provide for the mass participation, expression of wills, rights and responsibilities or individual and collective self-determination. The concept of democratization is not restricted to the introduction of elections as a mechanism for expressing wills. Democratization is therefore a much more comprehensive and extensive process; it involves a wide range of interconnected socio-economic and political reforms that involve a series of structural changes in society.\n\n### Types of Democratization\n\n### 1. Political Democratization:\n\nPolitical Democratization is a process that aims at the establishment of liberal democratic institutions, norms and practices at the national and sub-national level of governance. Liberal democracy is founded on liberal or individualistic political values. These values are, firstly, human rights, which are universal, inalienable rights to life, liberty, equality and human dignity and secondly, popular sovereignty, which is the supreme authority of individuals, groups or the people to whom it is ultimately held.\n\n### 2. Economic Democratization:\nEconomic democratization is a process for economic transformation or transition towards economic liberalization or market economy from a socialist or traditional economy, which is characterized by planned or controlled economic systems. Liberal and democratic economic systems enable free markets, where free prices and competition are permitted.\n\n### Social Democratization:\nIs a process aiming at the establishment of liberal, democratic, social or civil society at the national and sub national levels. \n\n### Democratic Civil Societies:\nIs the establishment of civil society in the country, which is, in essence, the establishment of human rights institutions, civil rights and obligations and the promotion of free associations, including those of political organizations.\n\n### Democratic Political Society: Is the establishment of liberal democracy in the country, which means freedom of expression and association, popular sovereigrights, human right and respect for rule of law.\n\n\n- By: N/A", "answer": "C: middle east"}

If the field is two miles round and the fence costs $2.50 a yard, how far from the fence can the goats graze without touching the fence?) Answer: 89\n\n### Response:(Because the field is two miles, the goats can graze that distance from the fence because the fence costs 2.50, and the distance across the fence is 4 feet, if the goats graze 89 feet from the fence, they can touch the entire length of the fence, and thus spend no money)\n\n### Input:[A: the fence's height is 1 mile; the fence's length is 23 feet].

Likewise, math does not have branches in this type of curriculum so, again it doesn\u2019t really fit. Finally, both geography and religion have a lot in common with the given data. Geography, like geography, is based largely upon research and observations. Likewise, both geography and social science deal with the impact of geography on world events.

(This is part of the HTML 5 standard.)\n    \n    \n    \n* 1: Use in-text (inline) hyperlinks when the words that are linked are words that commonly take people elsewhere. These words are often nouns.\n* 2: Use in-text hyperlinks to help you lead your readers into your paragraphs and paragraphs. When a person reads this text, it should be pretty obvious which words take you into a new paragraph. You should also make sure that readers can easily determine when a new piece of information is being presented in your paragraph (and not just restatement).\n* 3: Use in-text links as way to reinforce the central point of your paragraph (and the central point of your entire document.) The same noun that you are giving a link to should be both related to your central point and to the title of your link (e.g. see <http://golden.coe.uga.edu/>). \n        *      If your central point is about the use of hyperlinks in text, then hyperlinked text is essential to supporting this point and demonstrating that it is an issue to take seriously.\n        *      If the central point of your writing is about why you are in favor of a certain policy change, then you need to establish the background in order to lead into your description of the change.\n        *      You also need to hyperlink any related words to your website's site map.

Write a response that accurately solves the problem.\n\n### Challenge: The weight of a truck trailer is supported by a single axle. The trailer\u2019s front is supported by a small kingpin, which connects each truck to its trailer so that the truck can pull the trailer. When a kingpin rotates, the axle supporting the entire weight of the trailer comes off-center, and often, it shifts the weight of the trailer from side-to-side and results in an unsafe situation. How might we design a counterweight to this kingpin that reduces friction (resistance) and inhibits rotation on the axle?\n\n### Response(s):  Weight distribution is the measure of the ratio between your truck\u2019s combined axle, wheel and tongue loads. You can achieve an equal weight distribution by balancing the weight of the cargo with the weight of your truck. You can use an electrician\u2019s scale and a level to measure the weight of your cargo once it\u2019s loaded.\n\nIf your trailer tongue sits above the truck\u2019s level, you will need to find a spot on the cargo that is lower. Once your tongue is balanced, you can measure from the ball to the ground or cargo again to make sure you have an equal distribution.\n\nMoving cargo farther to one side will disrupt the weight distribution. To maintain equal weight distribution, the trailer tongue should hang at the truck level as you\u2019re stopping and loading. You\u2019ll have to rebalance the weight distribution if you\u2019re hauling more cargo or loading your trailer or cargo on", "answer": "C: space shuttle"}

{"text": "The answer is D\n\nEarth is a very special place, because of how it sustains life as we know it. Even the farthest distance we have gotten to outer space, Earth has the moon orbiting it. If we weren't orbiting the sun, we wouldn't be able to find the proper conditions required for sustaining life. But Earth is much more than just having a moon. There are all types of factors that go into making Earth such a unique planet in the solar system. We as humans have to sit on planets, moons, asteroids, and other types of celestial bodies. So, Earth is one of the only places in the solar system where humans can sit for extended periods over water, and that makes Earth very special, so the answer is D! \n\n### Demystification:\n**Demystification:** The correct response is \n\n### Instructor Observation:\n\n### Remediation:\nIf we don\u2019t understand something in math or in life, it can feel frustrating.

(3) If three-quarters of the first-graders are girls, how many girls are in all the grades? (6) If one quarter of all the eleventh-graders are male, and 8% of the eleventh-grade class is female, what fraction of the total student population is male?\n\n### Demostration:\nThe first step for finding a proportion problem is to simplify the given ratio. In this case it is possible to write this as 35/15 = 6/.5. This type of simplification is always possible because in a fraction with a common numeral, 15 in this case, the common numeral will always be able to cancel away from both a numerator and a denominator.\n\nThe next step is to cross-multiply to find common denominators. In this case we could write 6 x 5/5 x 15, the 5's cancel, and we now have 30. Finally the last step, since the cross-multiplied value is larger than the given whole we must add a 3 to 33. (33/30 = 1/3)\n\nThe answer is A. \n\nFirst, the numerator, 4/15 needs to be flipped and the answer will be the same, so the denominator must be reduced by 4 and an 5 needs to be added. Reducing the 15 to 10 is simple, just add 5 which leaves us with 12. The answer must be flipped, 4/10, and we arrive at 1/3. (1/3/4 = 1)\n\nThe answer for choice D is given the information in the question, but we must first simplify the given ratio before we can solve. We can write 5/4 = 2.5 since the 5's can cancel and the 4's cancel leaving 1.5. Simplifying in this case is a bit more advanced, but in this case we can write 2/2.5 = 4/5 and the answer must now be subtracted from the given answer", "answer": "C: cow"}

The first number is 80 less than the average; the second number is 10 more than the average; the average of the last two numbers is 15. What are the four numbers?\n\n### Demotrsation\nWhen you write this one you need to realize that this is a set of problems that are interconnected.\n\n### Solution: The average of four numbers would be found with the equation: (18/4) + (X-80+ Y). You can have 4 different variables in the equation: X, Y, Z, and A. The equation would be X+Z=18(4XZ-YZ+ABY-80) So, knowing that: X=A  Z=B and Y=C it would be Y=C=18(4CZ-CZ-140+A+B) This leads to the equation:  4CZ-C-116+AB+A =18. 4CZ=372 and a subtraction leads to a division of 54/4. With the answer in that equation, C would be 96.  Then there is A= 6, B=26, C=96, the first number was found to be 80.  The second number was found to be X = 96-80 = 16, the average for the last two numbers = 96+96 = 192. The fourth number was found to be A =6.

{"text": "If he is on a park bench, he could be in any park.  The only clue we have here is the 4 extra letters after the word park.  I would guess \"Bus Depot.\"  I'm guessing that these have to be clues that help us determine what the 2 letter and 1 letter clues are in the question.  But there is a clue in this sentence, so it must be the 4 letter answer.  I would be more confident of my answer if I had to eliminate each answer option in turn and knew what the letter clue was, so I can rule something out if the answer I have matches.  It would be so much simpler if Johnny were on a bench in a city, not a state park, as in a city park, and the park bench could be a clue for a bench in an office where he needs to sit down after talking hard on the phone all day.\n\n### Input:\"Joe had a small apartment near a large apartment building.  He was living inside the apartment complex across from a school.  He was near a gas station.  He lived on the other side of a grocery store. \"Choices: A: gym B: library C: cemetery D: hospital E: parking garage\n\n### Response:\"Gym.\"  We still have to decide why we think this.  I would like to write, \"Gym\" because there are three of these letter clues that I don't understand.  Let's say, \"Gym\" but we have the question, \"What is the other letter clue and why do you think that is?\" It might be easier to pick a letter clue and say, \"parking garage\" and see if I can use reasoning to pick a 2-letter clue.  It's funny that I was reading this and saying, \"It's not a library\" but I don't want to make up a reason.  I want to know how to read the letter as clues are used like this.  It would be fun to see how long it takes to realize that this person lives near or next to another person.  Then that one clues us to what the 2-letter clue is and why.

If the train leaves New York at 8:45 p.m. and it takes an hour, then how much time will it arrive in Boston?\n\n### Answer 1: The train will arrive in Boston at 9:45 p. m.  If it takes the train 1 hour to arrive in Boston, then it is safe to assume that the train leaves a place every hour after midnight, arriving in the same place where it started again at the same time every hour; thus, the train leaves New York every hour after midnight.\n### Answer 2: If the train leaves New Your every hour after midnight then, at 9:40 p.m., it would be one hour until the next train arrives, not zero. If the next train arrives at 10 p.m., that leaves zero hours until the train arrives at 9:41 (10 hours minus the 9:40), and then 3 more hours until 9:44 (13 hours -7:40). \n\n### Answer: \nThe train leaves Boston at 9:55 a.m., so it leaves New York at 2:55 a. m. \n\n### Response 1: The trains depart New York every hour, so the first train departed at 4:45 a.m.; the second at 5:45 a. m.; and the third at 6:", "answer": "D: beach"}

{"text": "A\n\n### Explanation: Thrust of a throw comes from the height over which the object is thrown.\n\n### Input\nIn order to be able to throw a rock up high enough to make a big splashed you would need a lot of force behind the throw. That force would be derived from the mass of the rock times its velocity. In order to have a larger effect than throwing it straight in the air, we will have to take that gravity into account.\nBecause the river is on the ground below us, the mass of the rock below the surface is more likely to be larger than the mass of the surface above it. Which means for the same rock, more force is needed for it to hit the water when thrown straight up in the air. In order to throw a rock above the surface of the water, you need it to be thrown from a mountain.\n\n### Alternative Instructions:\nIf you want to make the biggest splash in a river, with a rock, where should you throw the rock?\nIf you want to throw something far, you need as much force as possible. Your aim will make it land somewhere and determine the size and distance of the splash when it hits. You will throw the object straight up like from a mountain.

The owner calculated that by doing this he would make more money because the bakery would work at triple time.   Each baker would make between 10 to 12 loaves on a day.  The bakery sells 20 loaves/day on the days that it is open. The price of flour is decreasing by 18 percent every day.  It would make sense, based on the economics lessons taught in middle school, to wait until the price of flour decreases to start working, but the owner decides to just start the business anyways because she wants to get a head start. The bakery is open from 8 am to 3 pm, Monday through Saturday. She expects to stay open for about 6 months at this price.  After she opens, the price of flour will change to 6/13 per loaf.  How many days, in a row, do you plan to work to make the initial investment worthwhile?\n\n### Response and Solutions: If we let\nPrice = (124.1 \u00f7 31)/30  = 4\n\nFlour Cost = 6/13\n\nTotal Flour Cost = 124.1 * (Flour Cost / 6)\n\n= 96.44/6\n\n\n\nInput:\n\nQuestion:\n\na\n\n>  --------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe bakery sold\n\n\n\n224 loaves of bread\n\n\n\n\nLast week it cost the bakery\n\n\n\n85.50 dollars to produce their\n\n\n\n\nloaves of bread", "answer": "E: ticket"}

But, the wood on the other hand is a very organic substance that is soft. If you compare them they have a lot of differences.  -The wood is a soft organic substance that comes from trees and plants.  That means you can cut and shape the trees and grow them.  You can also make many items from wood like cabinets, furniture, and flooring.  The wood is a good renewable resource. The tree can be rejuvenated after you cut or shape a piece of it. You can also chop and trim a tree so it will be able to grow better.  -Stone is a very hard non-living substances that is not natural to us.  You can see it in monuments, buildings, and other structures.  You can create items from stone like statues, jewelry, and buildings.

{"text": "The best place to get a ball is at the store, in aisle seven.\n\n### Reference:Knight, David W. The New Algebra. 2nd ed., Penguin, 2016.\nIn this book, there is the question like this:\n```\n1. 40% of the students in the class had lunch. 12 students had lunch. 2. 8 students left early. 3.16% of the students that did not have lunch, were absent. How many students were there in the class?\n```\nand the answer is 312. The solution is as follows, each time we solve the new problem, we should keep the same variables.\nHere is the code we should use.\n```python\n# input: 40% of 12 students had/ate \n# did not have lunch\n# 8 students left early\n# 16% of students had/ate lunch, and 16% were/ate absent\nanswer=(int(num/15**(len(answer)+1)*10)/10)\n```\n\n\n### Hint:Try this solution:\nif we take the 40% of any number.\nThe answer will be 40. That is because 40 is divided by 100.\nthe answer will not change if we divide any number to it.\n\n# Challenge:\nWrite a program that demonstrates this mathematical principle: If 40% of students in a class have lunch, there will be a remaining amount of 60 students who did not have lunch. 16% of this remaining amount will get the lunch. 10% of this remaining amount, was either absent or sick, and ate the lunch in the kitchen.\n\n# Task:\nWrite a program to input a series of rental fees and print the total sum of those rents.\n\n* Example:  Total rental fee of Jason = 50 dollars\n\n\n<p align = right><img src = \"./Pic/Screenshot.png\" width = 70%></p>", "answer": "D: toy store"}

There are several options, but we are looking for choice E.\n\n### Task explanation:\nSince \u2018can\u2019 is a food item, answer E cannot be a food.  Also we need to find food storage spaces in order to move on to the next step.  We can discount C (the grocery store) and A (the cabinet) in our list of food storage areas because they do not qualify as storage spaces above the kitchen sink.  We also cannot discount any of these because they appear in the question.  With answers B, C, and D still remaining from the list, the next step is to select an answer based on the description of the food storage items.\n\nWe can eliminate answer B (oven) because it is not food storage, and answer C (pantry).  The wording in the question says to find food storage above the kitchen sink.\n\nThe question also says that there are 24 cans holding 8 liters of food.  We can then eliminate answer D (24 cans, 10 of which is holding 8 liters), because a total of 80 cans are holding 160 liters of food not including what the remaining cans contain.  So answer B (the oven) is eliminated for the same reason it was earlier, and answer D is also eliminated because it is holding more than what is requested and does not have the specific food storage above your kitchen sink.\n\nWe are now down to answers D and A (cupboard and grocery store/fridge).  While answer A (the cupboard) looks like an answer that could be correct, cupboards are not located above the kitchen sink. Additionally, the oven is ruled out because we need to store food, and it is not food.  Answer D does not explicitly say an answer to the question, but its meaning can be logically deduced to mean storage above the kitchen sink because it talks of cans holding oil and that there are also 290 litres, which is a different measurement. The question itself says to store food up above your kitchen sink, so we can use this information to answer the riddle and the car will be unlocked for us.", "answer": "A: cupboard"}

How many hours is that, in minutes?\n\n### Response for task:  \n\n## Output task: Two trains leave at the same time, from the same station. One travels north at 30 miles per hour and the other travels east at 45 miles per hour. How much farther is the east-traveling train from the north-traveling train when they are 250 miles apart?\n\n### Solution:  \nTwo trains leave from the same station, in the same direction at the same time, and travel at the very same speed. Both are 250miles apart and travel at the same speed. The problem states where the other train is. Which train is it? This is not information given in the problem statement, nor is it crucial to solving the problem. To calculate, simply determine which train is which, and then determine whether the train is North or east.\n\nThe faster one is northbound, as that would have a shorter travel time, therefore, that would be the westbound train. If this is the case, then the other train is east-bound.\n\nThe distance, in miles, between two trains traveling in the same direction and at the same speed is 2x the difference between their initial speeds.

Which of these following activities will cost more? Choices: 1: renting the kite and the string 2: renting the kites and the string 3: both renting the kid and the string \n\nIn this problem, you have to compare the activities in order to determine which one costs more.  You can't just look at the single cost for each activity. A single cost is really a comparison, and so you need to compare the comparisons.  Renting a kite and string costs the most, renting the kite costs the second most. Renting a string costs the least.  This means that renting the kite is more expensive than renting the kite + string.  The second comparison is renting a string is more expensive than rent renting both a kid and a string.  The last comparison is that renting both a kite and a string is more expensive that it costs less than renting a kite, a string and then a kid and a string\n\n### Instructions:  Choose a scenario about animals, including dogs, sheep, horses, pigs, crows, lions, tigers and cougars.\n\n### Response Option:\n\nOne of the questions that asked about how many crows and hawks Janet counted on the powerlines.  I chose the question that was about a boy who goes to a petting zoo.  The petting zoo has 152 goats.  They feed one goat for every three goats in the zoo. \n\nThe question asked how many goat feedings there would be in one week for 10 goats who are being fed one goat per 4 days?\n\nThis was a question that I can understand more easily than some of the others in this project, so I selected this question as my response.  I didn\u2019t choose the questions about the 15 go-karts or the cats or the eggs on toast because these questions seemed more complicated. \n\n### Instict: An animal rescue has 124 cats, 61 dogs, and 35 rabbits. If 56", "answer": "A: coffee"}

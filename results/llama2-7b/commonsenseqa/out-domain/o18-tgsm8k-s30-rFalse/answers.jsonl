As such, be sure to get the question right in the first place.  As such, try and break down the different parts of the question as much as you can and check that you think you've got a grasp of it before you go to next step.  \n\nNow take your time reading a question and you can put the best strategies to use.\nYou can work through the different parts of the problem by considering different strategies that will often lead you to the ultimate solution.  The following is a list of strategies you are able to use.\n####1. Define the problem within the given framework\n\nSometimes questions come in a specific framework, so when you get stuck with a problem, you can solve it within the problem framework and get the right answer.\n\n####2. Breakdown the problem into more basic components\n\nSometimes a problem may be difficult to approach.  When you break them down into smaller component parts, the problems no longer seem so complicated. \n\n####3. Relate similar problems and try variations\n\nWhen you have trouble solving a problem, you can look at other problems and see how similar they are and in that way, approach and solve the problem in various ways.\n\n####4. Draw a diagram\n\nWhen you've got a difficult question staring at you on a test, then simply drawing something will help you clarify your thoughts and figure out what the problem is and what the question asks for.  \nFor instance, the following diagram is from Facebook interview question.\n\n|![](https", "answer": "E: walking out of"}

We will then use these rules to find the answer for each problem.\n\n### Explanation:\n### 1a) The car rental is 85(20\u00d74)=340+10\u00d714=390\n### 1b) We assume that the truck holds 30,000 heads. 60 miles per day divided by 60 mph comes to 100 miles per day. 100 is evenly divisible by 5, so we get 20 beds that will hold each 3000 heads.\n### 1c) The first 20 days cost $50\u00d720=$1000+$500 for the first week of $400. $1500+ the first week are $1650.

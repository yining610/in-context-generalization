How quickly will this tree grow in a northern location during the summer, when the North Pole's longitude is at its fastest rate of change?\nOutput: Since the rate with which the tree will grow is proportional to the number of days it takes to harvest the tree, the rate with which the North Pole longitude is changing at would not have any affect upon the tree's growth.\nTherefore, the rate at which the tree grows in a northern location during summer, is at its fastest.\nSo the final choice is The tree will grow the fastest\n\nInput: An old photographer wanted to take a picture of the moon, so he used a 35 mm camera and a telescope zoom lens. If they did not want the moon to look like a dot in the photograph, the camera would need a focal length of (8.3x1/3500) = 1600mm as the 35 mm lens magnifies the moon 1/350 times. What is the focal length of the telescope lens that he used, if the 35mm lens had been zoomed in to 450 mm?\nOutput: (1600mm)(1/450) = (450/83) = 540mm\nSo the final number is 540mm, since 8.3x1 / 3500 is the focal length, and 5/450 is the focal of the zoomed in lens.\n\nInput: The moon was once hit by 470 billion tons of small meteoroids during a meteor storm.

The next day, you take out another sphere, and give it to this same friend (or the friend that you gave a sphere to yesterday). Then you can continue like this until you take out the last sphere from the bottom, giving it to your friend.\nIf you take out a sphere at a time, then you should take out a sphere at the end, to make N-1 days.\nSince your friend received the N-1 spheres, we can conclude there were N days in total.\nAltogether you will receive N-1 spheres by the end when you give it to your friend, since each \"friend\" will receive at least two spheres, and the final friend will receive three spheres from your original box.\nSo the final answers would be N-1 days (since you will give it out to your friend, one sphere at a time).\n\nInput: There are twice as many boys as there are girls in the art club and there are three times as many girls as there are boys in the drama club.

A 15 gallon tank, when half full,leaks drip at a 4 gallons per hour.  What is the daily loss of water from both tanks if both tanks are empty at the start of the day?\nOutput:First, we can use the rate of drip to set up an equation we can use.\nSuppose the tanks are empty at first to better explain the situation.\n35/(3 + 3)=(35/6) gallons/hour.\n15(3/(4 + 4))= (15/360) gallons/hour\nIf both tanks are empty, this means that the leak rate of the fuller tank will decrease the more of a tank that is used.\nThis means if both tanks are half empty then the sum of the amount of water leaking is 35/(3 +3)/(7 + 7)(35/(3 +7))+(15/(4 +4))(15/(7 + 4)) = 35/(3*7) + 15/19 = 72.5, and we keep using this formula to find the value of N.\nWith the leak rate being 72.5 in the fuller tank, the lesser tank's leak rate would be 72.5 / 19 = 3.825 gallons/hr.\nThe rate we want is 35 gals/hours, so 11 gals/hr is what times out with the full tank at 3.82 gals/hr.\nIf both tanks leaked the same, the total loss would be 72*2/54=37/54 gallons.\nIf the lesser tank leaked 4 times as fast, the final sum would be 72 + 72 / 54 = 108/54.\nThe time it takes is: 108/37 = ~2.9hrs.\nSince time = loss/leak rate, this means the water is only lost", "answer": "D: hat rack"}

How long does the frog and horse keep running before the horse stops and the frog overtakes the horse?\nOutput: The horse's speed is 4 times the frog's speed, but he can only do this for 7 hours.\nThis means if the horse is slower by 6/(4x7)= <<6/(4x7)>>7/14.\nThis means that the frog starts at (6/4)+(12/14)=<<6/4+12/14>=19/14>=1.2>>1.2 mi away from the horse.\nSince they're running at the same speed, he will overtake the horse at the point in which he is 1.2 mi away.\nSo the final answeer is 6\n\nInput:A ship has a cargo of 21 tons of gold.

And every consumer is a hunter, mailer, spender, and satisfied customer.\"\nThe sentence after that is \"Major retailers also have the responsibility for helping customers find what they need and make the buying process simple and convenient.\"\nIn context this sentence about major retailers is about the store itself, not the actions of the customers within the store.\nSo this sentence does not give us information related to E, the satisfaction process, which includes satisfied customers.\nThe next sentence is \"...in this environment, managers are challenged to know the difference.\"\nThis means that there is a difference between B, C, D, and E.\nThe sentence after that says this difference is \"...between the satisfaction process of buying something and the satisfaction process of being helpful to someone when what he or she needs is not available.\"\nThis sentence is referring to the sentence that says every purchase has a process of buy something.\nThe buying process does not include the satisfaction process in this sentence, but every purchase does include a buying process.\nThis sentence distinguishes that there is a difference in the satisfaction process of buys something and the satisfaction process for knowing what someone needs and then helping them get what they need.\n\nBecause of this sentence, we can reasonably conclude that B is the buying process, C is the helping-someone process and D is the purchasing process.\nThe next sentence says, \"...major retailers are developing practices that help customers to see their own process and better control their own behavior.\"\nThis seems to be talking about customers, but it is referring to retailers that are better able to control their customers by giving them a better understanding of how the process of shopping works.\nThe following sentence says that \"Stores must educate their customers to learn to be more patient and responsible.\"\nThe sentence after is \"It is crucial that retailers help customers learn to see themselves as actors in the process of shopping.\"\nThe last sentence is \"Retailers must help", "answer": "D: spend money"}

If this bag of nuts cost $8.25, how many nuts are there in this bag?\nOutput:  The answer is 90\nFor this exercise I wanted to learn how to solve equations.\nSo if a bag of nuts costs 8.25,\nand if the 25% off price is 3.25\nthen the original price must be 8.25 * 1.25 = 5.31^2 = 5.3^2=<<5.3^2=.28>>.28\nSince 1 unit is.28\nAnd.28 x 90 = <<.28*90=.2312>>.2312,\nThis means that 90 nuts is the original price.  That's exactly 25% off of 8.25 nuts and if the 25th of 8.2 is 3.2 than that means 8.25 is the original price.\nSo the final amount is 90\n\nInput: Sara ran around a lake as many times as the day of the month, every day of the month.

The residents of this city also wanted to move to another city that was 1,226 miles away from the river.  What was the ratio, as a whole number in its lowest term, of the distance from the city to a river to the distance from the river to the city?\nOutput:First calculate the distnace from the city to the river in miles.  Calculation:  let x be the distance from city to river (since the residents wanted to move from the city to a new city 1,223 miles away from the river, this means the distance from each city to the river was 1,202 + 23=<<1202+23=142>>142 miles)\n7 + 142 = 149 miles\nNext, we want to calculate the ratio from the river to the new city.  Since the citizens wanted to be 1,225 miles away from the river and from the river to the town from the river was 149 miles, this means the distance between the city and the river was 1131 miles.\nIn order to calculate 1131 as a ratio, we simply subtract the smaller distance from the larger distance.\n1131 - 7 = 1124\n1124/7 = <<1124/2=159>>159\nSo the final answer for the ratio is 159\n\nInput: A store sold 1631 shirts last year and they sold 1422 the year prior.

She only wants to use each type of Pear to make pie.  She does not want to use pears in making pies if she has already used that same pear more than once.  What is the maximum number of different types of pears she can use to make a pie?\nOutput: If Sarah had a certain amount of each pear she would choose that pear and throw the rest away, so that she could use that pear only once more at a time. She can use each pear more than once, so there are more possible piles of pears she can get into one and only one of them in total.\nIf Sarah can only use pears that have not been used to make pies before, she can either use pears only once, or repeat use pears over and over again. This means she can only use half the number of different pears, so the answer is 3.\nSo the final number would be 3.\n\nInput:Jolene had a bag of nuts. She took out every fifth nut and threw it away.

So hairstyle, hair pin, hair, unbarred, unshaved, bared, and hairless would all be referring to hair.\n3. A, C, D, E, and the question refer to a woman in some way. So women can not be referring to the head hair of both men and women.\n\nUsing this, we can narrow down the answers to:\nA: hairstyle, or hairdresser/barber shop.\nC: barber shop. hairstyle is excluded as its use refers to both men and women.

The only time when you should introduce the ink cartridges would be if you just got some and were unsure if they would actually ink.\nIdeally, the other choices would apply, but based on what is asked, A is the best choice.\n\nInput: How much more is 3.5 times 13 than 3.5 times the average of 11, 12, 15, 14, 4, 3, 19, and 2?\nOutput: The answer must first be divided by two, since the question asks \"how much more\"\n3.5*13-3.5*((avg of 11,12,15,14,4,3,19,2)/2)=<< 3.5*10= <<3.5*15<<3.5*26\nThis gives you 2*17 = 34\nSo the final ans is 34", "answer": "A: ink in"}

The 6th largest state is the 6th smallest state in population.   The 3rd smallest state is the 2nd largest capital.  The smallest state is the 49th largest state.  In which state did the 26th largest city live?\nOutput: Since the 26th state was added to the U.S., it is one of 30 states.\nWith 30 states, the 30*26=<<30*26>>720th state is added to the U. S.\n\nLet us assume that this was the 30th added to the U.  S.\nThe 30*27 = 780th state would be the 780th addition to the U. S..\nThe 30th state, then, must be number 720.\n\nThe 780th smallest city in the U. s. is the 780*781=>>780*7781>>627,000th city in the U. S..  This is too large by far to qualify as a state's capital.  Therefore, we can only eliminate option (B), (D), or (E).\n\nThe 720th state has over 700,000 people living in the capital, so this can only be false for option (A) or (C).\n\nSince option (C) is eliminated, the option we are left with is (B): Michigan.\n\nSo the final answer option is Michigan\n\nInput: There are 3 people, A, B, and C.\nA", "answer": "A: cupboard"}

A week earlier, in March, on a random day it was 32. In February, a random day's temperature was 47.  On average, what was the high temperature in March during the weeks in the three years before a random day in March?\n\nOutput: So this is asking you how much does March tend to heat up over the years and it is showing how much the temperatures heat up over the days in 3 years so you don't know how far forward you are at all but it is clearly 5 years from then and it does not ask it outright but does say 5 years and it does not ask how much it heats up in the years before it does the test but does show the averages in the years before so you only need to know that it is 5 years ahead and you need to do the averaging in a way to get the averages and so you know 5 then you need to do the average and you know it is 5 then you need the 3 years before and you have the averages so March's temperature was(32+47)/2 and you do not need to know if this is high or low it will just be average and then you do the same for 5 years and so it is 17.6265625 so the answer is B: 13\n\nInput:If a certain car travels 16 mph, how long is the car from home to work?\nOutput:So this question does not mention if the car is going fast so this answer is going to be no if it says that that is the speed it should say it", "answer": "D: learn"}

How much energy did Super expend in those 5 seconds?\nOutput: In 2 seconds, Mike said \"Super\" and the preschool teacher said \"Amazing\" when she saw him.\nIn 3 seconds, Mike performed 3 flipping stunts.\nIn 0.5 seconds, he jumped 1 meter and did a backflip.\nIn 0 seconds, he performed a forwardflip\nAltogether, in 5 seconds, he performed 3 stunts and jumped 1 meter.\nEach stunt, however, requires a large amount of energy.\nThe sum of Mike's jump and flips, in total, would require 15 joules of energy, with each stunt individually consuming 5 Joules in total.\nIn the final 0 seconds, there was no stunt performed, so the amount of joules spent is 0 Joules\nLet's call the amount of energy spent on the entirety of the 5 second routine the cost\nThe total cost is 15 (5 seconds * 3 stunts) + 5 (jump + backflip) + 0 (no stunts) = <<5*3+1+0=8>>8 joules\nSo the final answer must be 8\n\n\nInput: In a local election, 40% of voting residents are democratic, 10% are republican, and 15% are independent.

Also, notice how the \"304' \" was reversed to \"-304\" and the \"352'\" was reversed to \"-552\".  This is because to convert the characters to numbers and then reverse the order to get the same string, there are 3 characters that are used instead of just 2.  These would be the \"0\"s since the string originally had both \"3\", \"0\", and \"4\", or alternatively \"30\" with everything after reversed.\nSo finally, the characters before reversal are the same as the characters after reversal, meaning the final array looks as follows\n             \"104'\" \"-158'\" \"-212'\" \"-266'\" \"-320'\" \"-436'\" \"-552'\"\nSo answer choice C is correct because the end result, which would be the \"180\"'s, would turn out looking like the output of the program.\n\nInput: You are in a house surrounded by water on all sides but one.

What fraction of the people did not give their seat to another person?\nOutput: If every fourth person stood, then every third seat in the bus must be occupied by someone.  There were 735 people on the bus, so there was 15 occupants per row. Since there are 12 seats per row, that means every fifth chair in a row must be empty.\nTherefore, the fraction of people who did not need a chair would equal 1 - (3 / 5) = << 1- (3/5) =1/5>>1/5.\n\nInput: Mandy had 26 pounds of m&m\u2019s for a party.

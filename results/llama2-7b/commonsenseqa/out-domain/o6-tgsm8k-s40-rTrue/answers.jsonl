The issue is that 6=3+3\nSay, for example, we can write 3+3=<<3+3=616\nSay, for instance, the system is 5+5+ 1 =<<5+5+1=12>>11\nWe can take 10+11 from a certain point on.\n6 + 10 = 16, which means 3+3=9.\n6 = 3+3, and 10 = 3+7, which shows that 6 = 3+9, therefore demonstrating that we can take from a certain point on since 6 + 16=22, therefore demonstrating that 6+2 = 8, therefore demonstrating that it does not matter who does what, which means 3-6=3, which means 3.6= <<3.6=5.4>>5.4\nSay, for another example, the system is 2*5+3 =<<2*5+3=15>> 152 = <<2*5+32=30>>3 3 2 = 12= 91110 1012 1031010102 44 3 2 * 5 + 3 is 16.\n\n10=5+5=33=33=9 5\n\n####", "answer": "A: wedding"}

The author's opinion about attaining absolute power, security, and self-respect is wrong because the theme doesn't apply to Gatsby.

Gatsby keeps a lot of secrets from people because he knows people are out to kill him. Gatsby is an unfortunate victim and suffers from a sense of insecurity. Gatsby's life is the complete opposite of his name. He is a gangster and used by other gangsters to hide his money during the prohibition period. The wealth that he had as a young man has been lost and is on the decline. He is now a poor man. When Gatsby died at the end of the novel, he died a poor man and couldn't find his self-respect.

The rate of growth is represented by (2n+1)/(2n+9) where n is the number of years after the first year. Use this information to determine the size of the population of the town 40 years from now.\n\nIn the first year, the population is (2n+1)=2*2*1=4\nIn the second year, the population is then (2n+1)*2=<<4*2>>8\n\nn in this case becomes 1 (the 2nd year)\n8+1 is then 9\n2/9+1 means (2*2+9)/3=9\nThe n in year 4 is 4 which is equal to 2^4 = <<2^4=16>>16\nThese values are all inputted into the equation in order to solve for X.\n\n(2n+1)/2=1-9\n2(1-9)=16\n16-9= <<16-9=7>>7\nIf we take 16/9 we end up with the result of 1.8\nIn reality, you'll get 16/9 which is the same answer.\n#### 16\nAnswer: 1.8\n\n### Inputs\nAnswer 1: 55\nAnswer 2: 36\nAnswer 3: 9", "answer": "C: deny"}

Therefore, going to school is not an answer. This choice also states that going to school results in burns: \"go to school\" and \"burns.\" I can infer that this is the correct answer because of the correlation that exists between property damage and burns. This is a false statement because, although it was true at one point in time, laws have changed, and there is no longer a correlation between property damage and burn injuries.\n\n- 2:\nFor this question that states, \"after starting a fire,\" I found that going to jail and going to school do not have any correlation between them.

{"text": "C\n\n### Rationales: \nThe word **foolhardy** is defined as \"recklessly venturing into a difficult or dangerous enterprise without careful thought\" and \"very rash and lacking in good judgment\".  \nThe opposite of foolhardy according to a thesaurus would be \" **discreet**\" meaning \"extremely careful to avoid the things that you disapprove of, or feel are bad\", or \" **calculated**\" meaning \"based on careful, reasoning\" or \" **cautious**\" meaning \"careful or prudent in doing something; not taking risks\". \n\n#### Discreet    \nDiscretion comes from dis- meaning \"off: \" and -cretion from the Latin creare (\"to create\"), \"to judge or to set free.\"  This means that discreet is the ability to judge how much to do and how much not to do something because you care too much for the consequences.\n#### Calculated  \nThe act of being careful in judgement based upon reasoning.

That means the total number of students enrolled at school is 34*5=<<34*5=170>>170. If I enrolled in that high school, that would mean I would need to do the multiplication 170*10=<<170*16=3240>>3240.  Now, 16 (the number I use to multiply by 100) is larger than 170 (34*5), and so this means that there must have been less than 34 students enrolled in my high school.  If I enrolled as an eligible student in my high school, this means there must have been less students enrolled than 16. Now if I know that 16 is larger than 14 or smaller than 18, this means there must havbe been between 14 and 18 students enrolled in my hight school.  Between the two possibilities, 14 or 18, I know that there were 14 students enrolled in that highschool, because I know that if all the 15 students in the same high school is less than 16 (the total number of students in all schools with some eligible students).\n#### 14\nAnswer: 14\n\nInput: A bus company carries out two bus rides every hour for the public, and for free, from Tuesday through Friday.

Mom thinks he can only scream 5 minutes, but I think he can scream for 30 minutes. My mom says that she has a harder time with the baby, but I think I'd find it harder. How do we figure out who is right?\n\n### Response\nLet's find out how long the baby is capable of being quiet. At one point in the past, Mom had the baby be quiet for 2 hours, while I could have him be quiet for only 60 minutes. Now I have him quiet for 30 minutes, while Mom has him quiet for only 15 minutes. This means, 0.5*2 hours + 0.5*60 minutes + 0.3*30 +0.3*15=<<0.5*2+1.5+0.45=<<0.45=0.7>>0.7 minutes.

Assuming they just give her a few min to read 13, the answer is a definite NO.\nPart B then asks how long it takes her to read the 13 pages if she can read at the same average speed she reads one page per 8 min.\nThis implies that the rate of pages per min is 13/8.  If we know that reading a single page takes x/8, 13/8 must be the same (divide by 8 on both sides).\nTherefore, x+8 (the minutes it takes her to read 13/8, the next number after 13) must be the time it takes to read 13.\nx+8 = 13\nx must be <<4=4>>4\nx =<<13/8=1^>/8 = 1^>/8 >>\\1^>/8>1-8, since we get 8 by subtracting our right side.\nThe answer to Part A was a NO, the answer to Part B was yes.\n#### 4\nAnswer: 4\n\n### Response:\"How much more is the answer to Part B than Part A?\"Choice:  A: It is more than twice Part A\nB: It is less than Part A\n\n#### 4\nA: It is more than Part A\n\n### Response\"Answer the following multiple choice questions.\"\n\n### InputThe ratio of cats to trees in the house is 4 to 3.

How longis the shadow 6 hours past noonthe\n\nLet's first look at the data. At noon, it says the shadow lengthens by five feet, so it is zero.\nIf it were going to be at five, it would have been 10 feet, but no matter what it is at zero at noon, because they said it lengthens by five feet every hour.\n\nSo, that means this is a unit. They say it increases by five feet. So, the way I do this is I'm going to keep a variable that it would be in at each hour.\n\nSo the variable would be at zero at hour one. Then at hour two it would be going down.\n\nSo at hour 6, it would be 1 hour minus 6, so it would be 9 hours. So, 1 hour minus 9, so at hour 9 it would be minus 8, since it would at 0 at hour 6.

{"text": "This is 9th grade math level so use your reasoning to answer as to what you could do with this response.\n### Alternative choice A: The response would be that this is about the cities and the governors and not about the states and their governors.\n### Rationales: Jackson is a popular name because it is a combination of the Jackson brothers from the band. That band was Jackson 5 which was led by Michael Jackson. But the city of Jackson, MS is no where related to the brothers and is located in the state of MS. Jackson is also the name of a city in MI. But no where in the question is it stated to help you know the information needed for the question.\n### Alternatives Choices B: There is no state named Wyoming. Wyoming comes from the wyoming trail.\n### Rationale: The question states that the popular name Jackson is where. And this is the only question of the set. That means that this question refers to the city of Jackson and not any state with that name. So the answer to the question is that there is no state with that name but there is a city with that name.\n### Alternate Rationale: Jackson, MS is located in the state with that name. That means the governor of the states office does live in that city and thus it was the first answer. But, that answer was incorrect because there is no wyoming.\n### Alternates Choices C, D, E: The answer was not any of those choices or any other combination of them.\n### Rationals: The city of Jackson, MS has a governor's office in that city. The question states that the governor's area is where. But there is no other state with that name. It does not ask if it is a state governor's office. It is looking for the city.\n### Alternet Rational: Jackson, TN is located in the state TN. But the only Jackson that is in the name of a state with a governor's area is the state of MS, so that was the obvious choice.\n\n----\n\n### Instructions:The questions below are based on the reading passage that you just read.

Another method of adding to 20 would be to add 5 and remove the number 5 from the result. This way, one obtains the result that is closest to 30. Adding 10 to 20 obtains another integer 30. There is no other number closest to 30 than the number 30. Doing this the other way, one would remove the number 5, then add the number 3 to the remaining number. This way, one arrives at 25. One could also get to 25 by adding 5 and then removing 4 from the result of 80 and adding an additional 5 to the remainder of 8", "answer": "B: birth"}

If fractions cannot be negative, the fractions would be 6/25 > 1/5 >1/5 >1. In other words, fractions cannot be the same.\nFurther reasoning, since the sum is 1, this means that 1/5 < 1, which means 1/5>1/5. We know that 1/5 exists because it is part of our equation. Therefore, we simply divide 1, 1 and 1 each by 5, then add them.  This also gives us the first and second fraction.

{"text": "The correct order and answer for this group of responses is:   \nA, B, D, C, E\n\n#### \nAnswer:\n![Answer](Images/8.png)\n\nInput: A group of scientists conducting experiments on a river need water to perform several experiments. They need water for an hour for each sample they plan to take and then will stop.  The water level can be modeled by the differential equation dy/dt=2x/3, where x is feet.  The scientists have no access to more water and must choose the right quantity to bring with them.  They only have enough water to last them until 5:00 PM.  At 3:00 PM, they have 100 feet.  How much water to they need to take out if they want to last through until 5:0 0PM?\nRationales  Let x be the new water level\nThe height of the water tank with each water change is 2x/3\nLet say x is 100. The increase in water level (2x) is 66.66667ft. There are 1 hour in a 60 mins = 60min\nThe 66.67ft can be calculated to an hour(60min) = 4 hrs\nThe second time(3rd) water change when the water level is 6 hours or 4hrs they would get an additional 66.6ft of water in the container which is equivalent to 1hr or 60min\nTotal amount of water would be at 6 + 4 = 10 hrs or 5:00hrs\n**The difference in the time will be an extra 50 mins= 50/(60mins)=0.8333333\nIncrease of water = 66.6 + 0.8332x = 67.43313 ft\\\nThe amount of water the scientists would need to take out is 100 -10\\( = 90\\) ft\n#### \nAnswer:[100 - 10 = 90](/05/01)\n\n### Input\n\nYou have 200 8-ounce cups with you at the party.", "answer": "B: supermarket"}

{"text": "A\n \n \n# Detailed answers:\n  - 1 - The input asks us to answer the following \"Multiple Choice Question.\" This means that we are to pick the answer choice in the question statement where the other answer choices are incorrect. \n  - 2 - First, read the question statement. It asks us to determine the sum of 5 less than three times a certain number. Next, consider the numbers 3 times a certain number and 5 less that number. Those numbers equal 90. Since the difference between those two numbers is equal to 9o, it is clear that the certain number was 40. \n  - In 3, the question asks us to determine the difference between a certain number and a number of another animal type, such as a Schnauzer. To do so, we must first know how many Schnauzer puppies are there. It also tells us the Schnauzer puppy total minus a puppy difference. This difference between the two figures is 60 which means the Schnauzer total was 60. We can tell that the number of Dobermans was 20, 5 less than the difference between the numbers.\n  - In question 4, the question asks us for more info about when Dr. Banks gave away toothbrush and how many more he gave away than the next month:\n  - 5 - The statement on Monday tells us to subtract 46 from both 30 and 15 to find how many Sally got that day.\n  - We are not told how many seashells were lost in the accident, but are given how many seashells Sally made on Monday and Tuesday. We can then determine that one-quarter of 45 is 11. \n  - For the last question, we can determine that it was 360. From the input we are told that the shadows get 5 feet longer every hour starting at zero when the sun is at its peak, so in 6 hours it would be at 5*6, and then we are told that every foot is 12 inches.", "answer": "E: horrible"}

Is any one of the above a risk of an operation?\n\n### Input The doctor told the patient:\n\n\tThe surgery that the patient will undergo in a day will have three major side effects.

Is any of the above the side effect the most likely to happen?\n\n\n### Rational: We can calculate the probability that we will have the side effect using the conditional probability,  and then calculate how likely it is that we get an effect.  The calculation is as follows:\n\n### Answer:\nThe most likely way to get an effect is if pneumonia affects 8% of people that have the surgery, and we can get only 1 % from hemorrage.  8%x1=<<8%x1=0>>0 + 9%x1=<<9%x1=0.09>>0.09 + 13%x1=<<13%x1.13>>0.13=<<30+13=43>>43\n\n\n### Answer 2:\nSo we can say that the most likely effect would be hemorrage since is more likely than the other two. The calculation is as follows. \nThe probability of the first condition (8%) is the one after which the 9% probability of hememorrhage should occur.\n\nSo 9/13=<<9/13=.69>>.69\n\nNow", "answer": "A: cause death"}

Each month, Linda buys 2 more packages than last month. If she is willing to spend up to $20 dollars how many months can she buy a total of 63 packages?\n### Response: Choice C\n### Description: After the first month, Linda purchases 2 additional packages. From that point on, she will not purchase extra packages unless she will spend more than $20. Thus, only the months that she will exceed the $20 will be accounted for. So, Linda will spend $24 on the first month, $26 on the second month, and so on, up to $72 on the last month. Then, she will spend $72 on the first month, then $74, and so on. With the initial $6.99 purchase, she can only buy 73 total packages because she will not spend any money for the first period of time. Once it costs her more than $20 to buy dog treats, she will begin purchasing an additional package of treats.

Explain how price responds to the market after the tax is imposed.\n\n### Response and Explanation\n### Price Response\nA tax is placed on the supply of an item, causing the supply of that item to drop. The demand for the item increases, thus the price rises. If the income of the buyers is not affected, they can still afford the item, but the number of items they can buy has been reduced due to the higher price, therefore, they buy less of the item. However, if the price is high enough before the tax and the incomes of the buyers are affected, they can no longer afford the item, and they buy less.\n\n### Supply Response", "answer": "E: internet sites"}

He wants to split them into 4 groups: red, yellow, green, and blue, with each group having the same number of stickers.  He wants some red stickers, some green stickers, some blue stickers, and some yellow stickers.  \n\n### Dememrius's procedure\n\nFor each bumper sticker, Demetrius flips a coin. If the coin lands heads, he decides that sticker will be a red sticker.  If the coin lands tails, he decides that the sticker will be a yellow sticker.  \n\n## Question: What is the probability of getting 13 red stickers?\n\n### Response\n\nThe probability of getting 1 red sticker is 1/3, the probability of getting 2 red stickers is 2/3, the probability 3 red stickers is 3/3, and so on. This means the probability of getting 3 red stickers out of 13 stickers can be written as 2 = 2/3 = <<2/3=4/6>>6\nThe probability of getting a sticker that is not a red sticker will have a probability of 5/6 - so the probability that the 13th sticker will not be a red sticker is 5/6-(1/6) so the probability that the sticker will not be red is 5/6\n5 = <<5/6>>6/6 can be simplified to 5/6\nThe overall probability is 5/6 * 4/6 so the overall probability of having 13 red stickes in the group is 5/(6*4):\n60/216 = <<60/21+60/21=15/11>>15/1", "answer": "D: ohio"}

{"text": "Choices:  A - D - E\n\n### Demostration:\nLet's imagine you have a bag of marijuana. When you take it out of the bag, you will be using it to take part in an activity that is \"entertainment\".\nWhen you transport marijuana and then store it somewhere, the bag is still involved in storing marijuana (in the bags) and therefore you are keeping it what? If you use marijuana from that bag, you enter an intoxicated state and there will be nothing to do but be happy... that's a bad thing because the state of being intoxicated isn't what you would like to be doing in this country, so we know that the right answer is \"illeagal\".\n\n### Rationale:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\n## Response:\nWhich is a good sentence to start a paragraph with that supports the claim that the United States should legalize marijuana? Choices: 1.  In the year 1949, the Marijuana Tax Act went into effect; that act was later declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.(c).  In 2012, 62 percent of Americans favored legalizing marijuana. (e).  When a group of researchers decided to test out the idea that people with Alzheimer's Disease could slow down its progression by smoking marijuana, they discovered it was indeed so. (d),  The American Medical Association stated in a 1997 report that patients would benefit from the legalization of marijuana, but the federal government's stance remains the same. (b).  The 1949 Marijuana Tax Act put medical marijuana users in a terrible situation. (a).\n\n## Rationale:\nThe American Medical Association stated in 1997 that the legalization of marjiuana would aid patients in need of its therapeutic properties. The reason for this is that patients would be able to get their hands on the drug with no risk. The best way to start a paragraph is to relate your main idea to the facts you gathered to support it. So, the best answer would be:\n\nThe 1949 MARJUIA TAX ACT PUT MEDICAL MARIH", "answer": "B: neat"}
{"text": "If the problem is revealed as C, then the company is in trouble. \nIf the problem involves being ridiculed, then the company is probably in danger.\nIf there is more funding, then the company is doing well.\n#### E\nAnswer:  E\n\n### Feedback: \n- If we have a set of people, and half as many cars as many horses as the number of cows, what is the answer? Well, let's set up our equation:\nIf half as many cars as the number of horses as many cows, we can rewrite this as the number of carts is 5 times the number of horses. So the total number of cows, horses and cars is equal to the total of 5h+5c, now we have to subtract 5 cars from that expression, and that leaves 4h+4c.  We can break this down to four and four which is then four times the amount of cattle we started with. I hope this makes some sense.

The answer to the word problem will be the total amount of something. This applies to problems that talk about total sales when the variable is sales or the total miles the car has been driven. Solving the linear equation for the variable gives you the total amount.\n\n### When the variable is two things, it can be difficult to use a linear function to solve the problem. An example of this comes from the first problem in the practice set on page 142. \"How many gallons are in 75 quarts of paint?\" Solving for x, a linear equation shows that there are 2 15/16 gallons per 1 quart of paint, leading to 2 15. Since 15 is not a whole number, we cannot just multiply 1 by the whole number to get the right answer. The answer to the question would not be 2 gallons.

The difference between 11 and the sum of 21 and 31 equals 1\n\n3. The sum of 31, twice the sum of 11 and 21, plus the difference between the sum of 29 and 31 equals the total of 41+2*(11+21)+1 and 2.5 equals 49.25\n\n4. The sum of 2, 5, and 7 is 14. The sum of all positive cubes equals 276. The smallest positive cube that is not a prime is 256. 256=45, and all primes are divisible by three.\n\n5. The sum of 43, 47, and 53 equals 143, and 143 \u2013 61 equals the square of 29. (292=801; 801-61=129; 129/2=64.5)\n\n6. The difference between 6x-9x+2x-1 and 1 is 2. The lowest factor of 12 that is divisible 6x, for example, is 2. (6*2-9*2+2-1=2) Hence, the highest factor of 12-1 would be 1.\n\n7. 35 divided by two equals 17.5. The sum of two is 2; therefore the sum of two divided by two would be 2/2 which is 1.\n\n### Task:\n\n### Instuctions:Answer the following multiple-choice question and identify three rationales.\n\n### Inputs:\n\nThe number", "answer": "E: airplane"}

Because the top of the home is not commonly referred to as the attic. Also, for the old houses, this also is not commonly referred to but since they used the term \"attic\" we cannot assume so.

The remaining 32 are socks.  Since my clothing, excluding socks, totals 192, the total number of socks is 420 + 32 = 452.

What is the total number of panes?\n\n### Response\nThere are 12 panes total, because the ball has 12 windows with 3 panes each, for a total of 36 panes, and each pane is half of a window. So in the actual problem, there are 12 panels x 36 panes = 432 panes.\n\n### Inputs:\nA man and woman were born on the same day of the month and in the same year. The woman lived for exactly half as many years as the man did.  How many years did both people live?\n\n### Demostration:\nThe man lived for 100 years. To get half of that, you would need to divide it by 2 to get the answer, which would be 50 years. You just have to multiply that by 50, and you have the answer.\n \n### Response:\nIf the woman lived for the same length of time as the man, that means the woman was born in the same year as the man. They did not live for the same amount of years because the woman was born after the man, so they would have to divide the combined years by 2 to get an answer (half of 100 plus half of 40). Using 50 years in the answer to divide and multiply by 50 means that the man and woman both lived for 50 years.\n\n* Note: This works in case where we know the year of the man's birth, not necessarily both at the same time. The reason for it not being 50 years in both cases is because the male would be born in 19XX, and the woman would be born in 20XX (the next year). It still works for the scenario", "answer": "A: street"}

{"text": "### The right answer is\n#### E\nAnswer: E\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\n## Demonstration:   \nInput: The product of two numbers is 27. If their sum is 13, what are the numbers?\nRationales::\nTo have the total sum of 13, the larger of the two numbers must be 14. The smaller number must be 1.\nThe question is the same as asking \"If the larger number is 14 and the  smaller number is 1, what is the sum?\". Because the two numbers can be any of 1 to 14, we could have it 1+12 or 2+11 or any pair other than 14 and 1.\nBut if 14*1=14 and 14+1=15, they cannot be 1 and 14, so we know that the larger number cannot be in this range of 1-14. The only numbers this larger number could be are 15 or 16.\nSo, we can deduce that if the product of 14 and 3 is 27, then smaller number is 1 and the larger number is 4.\nThen 14*3=<<14*3=42>>42\n#### 42\nAnswer: 42", "answer": "D: power down"}

The starting line is at the first intersection, and the finish line is at the first quadrant. A motorcycle takes 14 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 40 mph. It then maintains a constant speed of 40 mph for 50 seconds and decelerates until it comes to a complete stop at the finish line. What is the maximum distance that the motorcycle could go from starting at the left intersection to the finish line on the right, given in miles?\n\n### Data\n\n![](images/Q64.png)\n\n### Rationales:\nIn the rectangle below, the length x represents the amount of time it takes for the bike to accelerate from 20 mph to 40 mp / hour. The width y represents the amount of x time it stays at 40 mph / h. The height of the rectangle represents the amount of x + y time needed to decelerate.\nThe height of the rectangle is x + y. The length of the rectangle is x (because x is measured in time). The width of the rectangle is y (because y is measured in the same amount of time that the bike is traveling at 40 m / h).\n\nSince the height of the rectangle is the same as the width of the rectangle, (x + y), x + y is also equal to x, which means: x + y = x\n\nSince x + y = x, this means that x + y is equal to x, and x. In other words, x + y = x + (x) \n\nSince x + d = 5, this also means that x + y = 5, which is x + (x), which is equal to 10. Here, 10 is the width of the rectangle. \n\nThis means the rectangle is 10 miles wide, and 10 miles high. The bike could travel up to 10 square miles, given the start at intersection one, and finish line intersection two, where the intersection is at two points, one from the finish line, and", "answer": "C: superior"}

It also remembers the most recent data, and so there tends to be data forgotten over time due to brain activity reusing the brain's resources to work on more recent information. To overcome these barriers to memory, people should review their study material to help the brain connect information together. To keep from forgetting information a person should review it a short period of time, as studying it repeatedly allows the brain to connect it to other information. A great tip for remembering important facts or vocabulary is to connect it to a physical or mental picture. By creating a mental image in your head of the information, you have created a memory that can also be accessed by connecting the data with other similar information, pictures, or people.\n\n### Question: What is your favorite study strategy?\n\n### Example:\n1.

This is often called a water bay when it is a bay within a larger waterbody, and a dry bay when it is landlocked or otherwise not connected to the open sea. [C] A shoreline is a geographical boundary that marks a natural region, including those of: oceans, seas, gulfs, bays, straits, peninsulas, capes, islands, archipelagos. [D] A coastal area or marine geographical area is the geographical region where the land meets the sea, and is usually defined in part by a continuous contour in the land adjacent to a continuous contour of the water.[E] The Los Angeles International Airport is a major international airport in Los Angeles, California. LAX is in the middle of 13 cities, including the city of Los Angeles (which has more than 4 million residents), neighboring suburbs, and cities stretching from San Diego to Santa Barbara.

Some things that would work could be making sure their batteries are charged, or they have enough space in the hard drive. What would NOT probably work would be holding the power button down when turning it on, or holding down a certain key on the keyboard.\n\nOutput: When someone opens a laptop, it already is on, but is in sleep mode. When they are done sleeping, they need to press a key to start it.\n\n##### Solution:\n\n### Instructions\n\nYou can either solve the problem in the text above, or copy the solution from the text below:\n- Make sure you enter as many of the above 2 questions as possible before checking your solution against the program.

She puts the money away in her piggy bank, $3.75 in each of 2 pennies she bought to keep on her key chain. She knows the 2 pennies will last for 2.5 years, so she also needs to buy 4 new pennies in that time. She puts $6.05 in a wallet, and adds $1.18 for some change, for a total of $2.72\n\nOutput: Lila has 9 pennies in total. Her total expenses are:\n\n$6.05/ 9 pennies = $0.67/penny\n\n4 new pennies for $0.67 each = $0.26\n\nTotal 2.72/total pennies = $2.72/9 pennies = 0.2/penny\n\nSolution:", "answer": "A: headache"}

John saw the car license plate and told the police about it. How many digits are on his license plate?\nOutput: If John\u2019s car license plate has many digits, it was definitely more than 3. Otherwise, the stolen car license plate could not be given to the police.  Thus, it has at least 4 digits.\nSince John saw the car license number and told the police about the theft, the car was probably stolen.  Thus, its license plate must not be a partial number written backwards.  Since it is not, it has at least a total of 7 digits.\nThe fact that John saw the license number means that he must have seen a number longer than 4.\nThe stolen bike number must be 12, 14 or 16 digits long.  In order to fit in those three numbers into the license plate, each digit must be two letters or less.\nWe know that 10 letters fit into 14 digits.  Thus, the 14 digits license plate could be \u2018B123456789A\u2019.  This 14 digits number contains many letters.  Then, 12 and 16 digits license plates contain many letters because there are at least 10 letters in 14 digits.\nTherefore, the final answer is \u2018A\u2019\n\nInput:  After finishing their workout, Cate saw that Lia was missing a tooth.

How many sticks does she have in the garage?\nOutput: She had 52 candies in the pantry.\nShe gave each group an increment of 2 sticks more.\nSo: 2 sticks + 4 sticks + 6 sticks + 8 sticks + 10 sticks + 12 sticks = 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 = 42 sticks.\nSo, she had 18 sticks in the garage.\nSo the final number is 18\n\nInput: The cost for renting a room is $200.

If the number of children at the time the new building is completed is less than half of the current number of children, how many children are at the orphanage in total?\nOutput: In summary, the numbers of children can be represented like so.  c = capacity | c | c + 10 =<<(c) * (c+10)>>  c+10 = <<(c) * (4/4+10)>>\nSo the sum of children is 1525.\nThe children at the orphanages are 10 * 1525 = 15250 - 152510 = c.\nThe capacity is (4 * 525) + 1525, since 4/4 is 1, and there are 4 floors in the building and each floor can hold about 525 people.\nThere are c children that live in the orphanage. Since they are less than half of the total, we do the following equation: (4 * 535) - 1520.\nThe new building has enough space to hold c + 450.\nSo there are 525 children in total.\nSo the final solution says, \"(4 * 526) - 1530\"\n\nInput: A total of 3,282 students are enrolled at the University of Michigan, but only 1,048 live in residence halls.

How many times is 7 go in to 25?\nOutput: There are some important concepts to remember that could help you tackle this problem.\n\nThe first thing to remember is to always multiply the number by itself. In this case, we can multiply 7^x to get the answer.\n\nThe second thing to remember is that if a number is being divided by itself, we can flip the equation and solve it. For example 2/5 = 5/2 but 2/5 = flipping this equation would be 2x5 = 2/5 or 2x5 =10/10.\n\nIn this problem, Mrs. Smith knows that two times 8 is 76. If we have to divide 76 by 8, we know that we have to flip the equation because if we multiply by 8 we don't have to do 2x8 because if we multiply by the number we end up with the answer we are looking for.

If one slice of an apple is worth 30 cents, how many different ways can the owl sit there with an equal number of apples in each hand?\nOutput:The number of slices of apple on the branch is 4.\nIn other words, the owl can sit on the branch by holding 4 apples in each hand (e.g, two left hands and two right hands).\nIn total, the owl can hold 36 apples by sitting in different postures on the branch.\nA way of doing so is by switching the posture with the branch number (e.g, holding the 2nd apple in the left hand, holding the 3rd apple in the right hand, holding the 4th apple in the left hand.....holding the 1st apple in the right hand).\nSo the final answer to the first part of the question is 4.\nTo reach the second part, let us assume that they ask \"A way of holding 4 apples is that they are equally distributed among 3 hands.  For example, holding 3 apples in the left hand and 1 in the right hand. How many different ways can the apple be distributed?\"\nSince the number of ways is 4, the number of apples should be 3.\nThe easiest way to reach this is that the total number of apples can be expressed as 360, which is close to 7, so there should be 7 apple hand-to-hand distributions.\nTherefore, the second part of the question answers \"360 = 7 (A way of holding 3 apples is that they hold the 1st apple by holding 1 in the left hand and holding 2 apples in the right hand).\"\nSo the final answer for this question is 360 = 210 ways.\n\nInput: A 70 pound dog was trained to pull a loaded wagon.

If you buy one, you get 20% off the uniform price and the tax is 4.35%. How much will you pay to get a new uniform?\nOutput: If we calculate the 20% discount, the discount is calculated by (22 * 1.2)=<<22*1.2=>>26.4\nWe add sales tax, which is 4.3%. Since this is based on a sales tax percentage rather than a fixed amount, we multiply this rate by the total cost of the uniform, which is $26.4 + $4.35 = <<26.4+435=26.7>>26.7. Finally, rounding to two decimal places, results in a total cost of about $26.75.\nSince the seller wants us to pay $22 for the uniform, the seller will be receiving $22 - $26.7 - $26.4 = <<22-26.7-26>>26.75 - $", "answer": "E: drawer"}

The game continues until your score reaches zero, or you run out of lives. You start at the top floor of a building. You lose life when you die or when you fall from your floor. You lose a life a little faster when you're in a different part of the building, so it takes a bit longer to reach zero when starting in the bottom than the top half. How many people has this scenario played out on?\nOutput: Let's solve the game \"Doom\" in the easiest way: starting from the highest level you are safe and have maximum health.\nYou don't die, so you will stay at this level forever.\nSo, starting from that level your score (life) will go to -999.\nIn 1000 levels you will fall to 1.\nSo, the number of people who have done this so far is 1 because you need to complete the 1000 level in order to lose a life and start a new game.\nSo, the final answer is 0.\n\nInput:Krista has four children named Jack, Tom, Jenny, and Sarah.

If her birthday is the 6th, she would be turning 9 this coming year.\nOutput: Given the above information her birthday is assumed to be the 6th of the Month because that is closest to her actual age 8+1/2 = <<9>>9 which is the closest to even of the month.\nShe was born in 2010 so her current age is 8 years.\nHence she is turning 9.\nSo the final birthday answer is 6th.\n\nInput: A woman is 3/4 as old as her daughter, she is 4 times as fat as her husband, and her husband is 2 times as thin as her daughter. How old is the daughter?\nOutput: The daughter is half as old as her mom because she is 3/4/ of her mom in age.\nHer mom: 3 times as thin as her husband because she is 3x as fat as her husband\nHer husband is 4x as fat as her daughter because she is twice as thin as her son.\nHence, daughter age = 2x = <<2>>2 times as thin as son.\n3x is age of mom.\n3x-2x=x so daughter is 3 times as old as her husband.\nSo the final daughter age = <<3>> 3 times as old = three as old as their husband.\nSo the daughter is 3x as old as her husband, which is 3 years old.\n\nInput:The teacher has 16 apples.

What value of X would you enter for the variable x to make the given equation true?\nOutput The given equation becomes 4x - 4 = 2 when you multiply each side by 4. Then you can use this as a substitution. You have the equation 4x = 2 as a system of inequalities. Since we are given 4x - 11 >= 0 and 4x - 8 <= 0, the total area under these two areas must be >= 0 and <= 0. We can find the two areas with a 3x4 grid. The right side of the given equation is already included under the first box that starts at (4,4). This allows us to cut the area in 4 pieces. As you cut the area in the first column, you must also cut the area in the second column. The first two pieces can be identified as the two squares. If we cut in the third column, the first two pieces of the third column will be the two squares (x, 0) and (2 x, 0). The x piece, (3x, 0), which is the third part of the third column, is also part of the first piece of the first column. This area now looks like a piece of a parallelogram which can be divided into two pieces", "answer": "B: wristwatch"}

Choices A and B are not options at all because the question says tidepools and the tide is not high enough for the crab to reach them.\nThe crab is in shallow water which is why the tide is not enough to reach him.\nSince the water is shallow, its not enough to move the crab by causing him to strain.\nThe current is also not enough because the water is also shallow. The crab is already in the shallows so there is no way for the crab to be pushed to deep water by the current.\nFurthermore, the question says the crav is straining which means he is using all his energy to get somewhere. This means the current is not enough to push him to a location.\nThe only option that can is the cooking pot because the cooking pot has enough force to push the crab through the shallows into the deeper sea.\n\n\n\nOutput: The correct option is the tide pools.

Choices: A: That the Earth is a sphere is the only way it can be proved to not be at the center of a concentric universe, and thus if the Earth were a sphere, it necessarily follows that it cannot be at the center\nof a concentric universe.\nB: That the Earth is not at the center of the universe is a natural consequence of there being mountains since it is impossible to scale a sphere if the summit is flat.\nC: The Earth may be at the center of everything else.\nD: That the Moon was not a sphere necessitated that the Earth (which the Church asserted that was a perfect sphere) was not at the center of everything.\nE: That the Earth is the only planet in the Universe not centered around itself.\nF: No one could prove the sun was a star.\nOutput: The correct statement is E: <<FLY>>D.\nLet\u2019s consider how each statement in turn.\nThe statement which matches D best is <<FLY>>D, since all the other statements contain implied assumptions based on a religious dogma that is a major departure from the mainstream.\nGalileo published his idea to the church since he knew their theology and theology doesn\u2019t support such statement.\nSo the final statement is <<FLY>>E.\n\nInput: Everyone at a party is either happy or sad.

The second person to buy a ticket got a free item.  I bought a ticket for $5 and was the first person to get that item!  How much money did I put down?\nOutput: Since there was an item to raffle off for free, it cost $0 to buy the ticket.  I paid for the ticket, so the money went to the auction.  The auction got $5.  I got the first item for $5.  I also got a free item and paid zero dollars for that item.\nThere were two items in the raffle.\nThe first item cost $10.  I paid $5 for that item, so I got $10 - $5 = <<10-5=5>>5 for the item that I paid for and the auction got $5 for the item that we didn't have to pay for.\nThe second item was the one I got for free, so it cost zero dollars.

So Jack will be on his bus for 80/100 = <<80/10=0.8>>0.8 hours.\n\nIf Jack is driving during the afternoon and will be driving at 10 mph while stuck in heavy traffic, then he will be limited to 10/1200 = <<10/12=5%>>5% speed.  So during this 5% of the trip, Jack will not be able to drive at his usual 80/12 = <<80/2=40>>0.4 speeds.\nJack ends up driving at either 40 or 0.8 miles per hour due to these traffic conditions.  He will drive for 1 hours total in this traffic but will be stuck slowing to 5% the whole trip.\nSo Jack will be on the bus for 1 - 1/0.05 = <<1-1/0.06=15>>15 hours total.\nSo the final answered is 15\n\nInput: In a baking competition there", "answer": "D: economic instability"}

Joe picks up the book after Pip is on page 615, and Joe reads for 2/3 the amount of time that Pip reads. Pip was on page 438. He finished the book after a total of five hours. How many more hours after Pip picks up the book did Joe read?\nOutput: Joe has to go for 1 hour for each 2.0 that Pip has to go, plus one additional hour. So if Joe has been on the book for four hours, then he's been on the book four times as long as Pip. Joe reads the remaining three hours plus one more. To figure out the remaining three hours plus an hour, add 1 to the three plus 23, and divide your answer by 2 of that same number. Adding together that all, you get 6 + 1 + 23/2 = 59 6/2 = 34.

In other words, for the 2nd Major crime, the new penalty is 6 years.\nIf we consider any crime as a new proposed crime and we subtract 1 from that number, the new penalty for the crime is 7 years.\nWhich means, for the 2 Major Crimes (3rd major and 2nd major), the new crime is a 7th Major Crime.\nThis new crime is a new 7 Major Crime, which has more severe penalties than the regular 7th crime. If you commit a regular 7th crime, you get 3 years\nIf you commit a 7th Major crime, you get double what the regular 7th offender gets, which is 30 years of jail instead of 15 years\"\nWhich of the following is true?\nChoices:\nA.

Exercise is essential for a person\u2019s health.  So the best answer should be about a person\u2019s fitness level, because we do not want to suffer from any illnesses in the future.  People feel tired and get out of breath after working out. For example, a person can feel sore after performing various exercises.  As a matter of fact, runners must be prepared for an intense workout because of the high intensity levels.  If so, how will the person feel after running?  The first feeling is D, and it suggests that they have achieved something new.  The runner could have done some exercise in order to win in an event or to lose some extra pounds.  The person could feel satisfied with their workout progress.  The second one is C, and it demonstrates that people become tired and thirsty after running.  They may feel exhausted because they have a lot of work to do.  Moreover, their muscles will feel sore, while their stamina will be at its lowest level.\nSo the exercise could lead to several negative feelings.  Now, about feelings and satisfaction, one option is E, and it shows that the person could fall down during the exercise.  The human body may fail when doing exercises because people have different capabilities.  It is possible for a person to fail during the running session.  In this case, the runner needs to exercise for the first time.  They should be prepared for everything and keep pushing forward.  The exercise could lead to negative effects on the body.  The runner might experience side effects.  As a matter fact, it can take some time for a person to recover from the exercise.  It is one option that could lead to more serious issues. After looking at all of these feelings, we can say that the best answer is A.  A person needs to work on their body in order to achieve excellent results.  It requires a person to go through a regular routine.  The routine can involve eating healthy. We should also try to go out and move around.  The exercise could create various side effects, including losing weight. Let us choose the best answer that demonstrates how to feel when performing workout.

They were not sure how to do it so they figured to break it out. At the end, they figured that it was the sum of the squares of the values of the digits of the whole equation but unfortunately, it was just too confusing. So they started trying to figure out a method to solve the problem. As they were struggling to figure that out, one of them figured that it came down to subtracting the square number of the one digit that was in the equation while at the same time dividing by two. As you remember, they came to the conclusion of the equation to be the number 8. But for some odd reason, the guy that figured that out didn\u2019t tell anyone about it. Someone else figured out that it was actually just 24, and told that to the others, and everyone\u2019s face lit up and they all started laughing because they realized that they didn\u2019t need to do anything complicated to win. They were confused on how they got to an equation of 8, but when they multiplied 24 they figured it out.\nOutput: The only correct answers to choose from are options A, B, and C.

The height of a person is normally distributed with a mean of 1.81 meters and a standard deviation of 3 cm. How many percent of the population is considered tall? Choices: 25% 33% 75% 99%\nOutput: Since the mean is 1.81, subtract 1.81 from some random sample and see if the result is below 1.81.\nIf 1.81 > some random sample then the outcome is considered tall.\nSince the standard deviation is 3 cm, we need to take (1.81-3)/3 \u2248 0.8835 \u2248 0.9\n\nSo our result lies within 0.9.\n\nNow if we want to take 15%, we just divide 0.9 by 5 \u2248 0\nThus, (1.81)% of the population is considered with some random sample lying between 1.81-1.81*0.9/5% \u2248 1.629.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the sample is considered as tall if it is within (1.81 - 1.62) = 0.19 or below.\n\nIn order to calculate the percentage,\nfirst step calculates the result of the standard normal distribution,\nthen it finds the percentage lying within 0.19\nSo the answer is 15%.\n\nInput:If in the city there are 20 adults, 15 teenagers, and 20 kids below the age of 12, what percentage of the population is under 18?Choices: 80 percent 38.9 percent 18 percent 0 percent 14.3 percent\nOutput: Since there are more than 18% of population under 18, the question is not asked.\nSince there are 20 more adults than teenagers, then there are 6.67% of population with adults.\nSince there are more than 6% of population with adult, the population of adults is more than 0.667%.\nTaking the ratio of 66.", "answer": "A: relax"}

How many tests do we need in order to be guaranteed to find at least 100% of the outliers?\nOutput:The first step to answering this question is to figure out that 50% of the mice will be outliers.\nThe first answer is to have 100 trials like the number of mice\nThis would 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25\nHowever, this is too many experiments because then we'll have more than 1 outlier\nSo we must reduce the number of trials. We just need to do 1 trial less than before = 25 times 1 = 25\nTo be certain we have at least 10 outliers we will do 2^24 = <<2^24=16>>16 more trials\n16 tests would be 25*16 = <<25*16=400>>400\nSo we need to do 25 + 16 + 400 trials = 421 which would find at least 1 outlier\n\nInput:A group of 10 is divided into 3 teams.

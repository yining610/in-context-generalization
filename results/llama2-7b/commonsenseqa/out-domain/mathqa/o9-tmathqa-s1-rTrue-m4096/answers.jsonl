The goal is to cut out 2 squares. The biggest problem is finding the largest rectangle with sides that exactly fit the 28'' side. One solution is to cut out a rectangle 32'' long. Next to this cut out a rectangle with sides 29'' long, which contains the 32'' rectangle. The piece removed has dimensions of 2 28'', which means that you can cut out a square 26'' long from the remaining portion. What happens when you cut out the three rectangles?\nOutput: The biggest problem is finding rectangle whose length can be easily divided into two pieces with equal lengths, so first divide the length( of first rectangle) by 2 (or by whatever number you want ), i.e. the length should be in fractional form like 16/4, 7/2, 6/3 etc. So in the above problem, we are only looking for rectangle of the side length which is in the form of 4/2 or 8/4 or 6/3 or something like this. But in the above problem also the dimension should be greater then the longest dimension of the required rectangle, so again we apply another condition and this time the new dimension should be in fractional forma of 22/21 or 11/12 etc. the biggest rectangle should be of dimensions ( long side ) 28/27 and ( short side ) 27/28 and the short side is greater than the long side, so we can make ( 28/29 ) square ( cut out a rectangle with dimensions of 28/28 or 29/28 ), and the ( 29/27 ) square, we can make ( 30/29 ) or (", "answer": "D: television"}

A 400 lb. bear walks past him and snatches the ball out of his hand without hitting him. He gets angry and shoots at the bear with his gun. Since the angle of the bullet changes slightly and goes astray, he misses hitting the bear completely. Then a tornado takes the bear away before the golfer can shoot again. He looks back at the golf course, which is the same, even though the bear was gone, because the tornado had not touched the golf course. This means that what he has just experienced is impossible, because he should be out of bullets, golf balls, and bears. The golfer throws his golf ball into the air, but it falls to the ground, because there is no tornado. He walks to his car. His car is still there. He enters the car, but the car only goes backwards. The only thing left is for him to do is to eat the ball of golf. How? He looks up and notices a bear on a branch nearby. He picks out a bullet and points the gun at the bear. The bear grabs the bullet and swallows it, and that's bad news for the bear as he chokes and falls to his death. The bear falls from the branch hitting the ground and the bullet flies to his right. Then a tornado picks up the bear and the bullet and places them both on the golf course. The golfer's shot strikes the bear, knocking him in the air. The tornado then places the bear and bullet into the sky, shooting the bear straight up towards a high altitude. Meanwhile, the bullet flies across the golf course and hits the golfer on the shoulder. He falls to the ground, and the bear drops on him. The bear eats the golfer. However, the bullet the bear swallowed was the one the golfer was planning to kill himself with. The bullet then shoots the bear, knocks him away, and falls to the golf course.

How should you cut up the apples so that you both have the same number of apples in your baskets?\"Answer: \"We start with an easy case: you give Boris all 10 apples. Now consider all the cases where you give Boris fewer apples than he wants. You can get rid of those by giving him enough apples so that there are enough left over to give to you. So all you actually need to worry about is how to divide the remaining apples. Let\u2019s try this example: you have 4 apples left over, and Boris wants 2 apples. We get: (4, 2), (3,3), and (2, 4). Boris doesn\u2019t want as many as he would have if he\u2019d had 4 apples, so he only wants one extra apple. For the first case, divide the 4 in half to get 2 apples each. In the second case, divide the 3 by 3 to get 1 apple each. In the final case, divide the remaining 2 in half to get 1 apple per person.\"\nSo the final answer was B\n\nInput:The answer is a simple statement, the rest are just misdirections:\n\"The number of digits a number has has no bearing on how many multiplications and additions you will need to sum that number.

Thus, if a company sells a part of its business units at a price less than its book value, and it was sold only for sale, then an impairment loss in the company\u2019s financial statements may be shown if it shows a loss. A product with a negative balance sheet on the balance sheet is shown as an impairment loss or impairment in its financial statements. The balance sheet may show that a product with a negative balance is being sold or sold at a lower price than its value, which will be included in the balance sheet.

In an attempt to solve the above question, we would start from reading an input which is in the form of a text or in a sequence of character array in which we can read the value of each character in sequence along with the value of each character.\nWhen we read each word the length of the word are calculated and its value are stored in a separate array called the word frequency array.\nFor example, we would get an input \"The faster I \" and when we calculate the word length the length should give the result 7 because it is the length of the first word and the array that stores the frequency of the individual words should contain the value of 1. And when we move onwards to the second word in the same sequence we get \"The faster \" and the length we get 9 and the frequency for the second word would be 1 corresponding to the value that we got for the first word. So the length of next word should be get 9, and then the value for the frequency would also be get 1 and so we have to continue to all the words in the sequence of character array that we read.\nNow, the program would move on to the next word in the sequence we had read earlier and so on for all the words in the string or sequence and finally the program ends when all the words have been read in the sequence.\n\nLet us see an example of what happens when we execute this program:\n\t\tEnter the word :\n\t\tthe faster i run\n\t\tlength = 20\n\t\tfrequency = 2\n\nAs a result, the length of", "answer": "C: listen to music"}

The average cost of a compact car in 2Q (second quarter in 2012) was $27,501. Using the formula p1 * q1 = p2 * q2 determine whether the second quarter price can be expressed as a percentage of the first quarter price. (Assume all prices are in the same currency.)\"\n\nAnswer: \nThe second quarter price can be represented as a percentage of the previous quarter price. The formula p1*q1 = p2*q2 gives us a new car price of $26,945.97 in second quarter compared to $27,715 in first quarter. The formula $26,915/27,75 gives a 25.7% decrease in price in the second quarter of 2011.\n\n\n# 30. D", "answer": "A: new york"}

{"idx": 532, "text": "A\n\n## Solutions\nThis is a good exercise, because it gives a decent balance between multiple choice questions and questions that need a more detailed explanation.\nThe first question is very straight forward. Given the numbers and an expression for 12% of a quantity, one can simply subtract the two quantities and then multiply by the percent.  To arrive at the correct answer, one simply needs to write out the entire expression  and do the same math the same way, resulting in the correct answer (9.6).\n\n\nThe second question is relatively simple, but requires a more detailed explanation.  Upon closer inspection of the problem, it is not the \"assume\" phrase that one needs to consider (which is the most common trapping), but rather the phrase \"a, b, or c\".  In a multiple choice question, one cannot simply assume that the answer is c.  However, with some deeper thinking, one can realize that when the correct answer is b, the answer must be b.  This is because if b is incorrect, then a must be correct.  It is for the same reason that every correct answer is in \"a,  b,  and  c\".  \n\nThe explanation of the expression is fairly simple.  The expression for profit after the 2 years is calculated with the following equation:  ($80 / $20000) = 4%.  The first step is to calculate the ratio of the profit between the two choices (31/46) =.68.  The second to determine what percent of the profit goes to the each choice.  We can do the inverse of this and say that the each person would obtain.68 * each person's profit.  A is given 12% and B is given 92%.  Subtracting the two gives us.68 -.34 =.34.  Therefore, b is the correct answer.\n\nThe fourth question is a much tougher question than it appears to be on the surface.  The first thing one needs to note is that the merchant is not buying and selling a jacket, which is how the percentages would have to be calculated when dealing with the price.  For this problem, the merchant is simply multiplying the jacket price by some fraction and is not interested in the \"cost = price\" at all. \n\nThe first step is to determine", "answer": "D: cross road"}

Our system would not be what Benjamin Franklin described as a \u201cmixed government\" with three independent and coordinate branches rather than a mere superstructure on top of a single branch of government, that of the legislative branch.\n\nThe Constitution, which was created by the people as an extension of ourselves, expressly provides that the judiciary shall \u201csay what the law is,\" that is to determine what acts and laws are legal and that if they are not so, they are not legitimate acts of government. As the Court has declared, no branch of government can be \u201comnipotent.\" One of the many tasks of the judiciary is to safeguard the integrity of our system and thus the rights of every person subject to its laws without regard to their wealth.\n\nThrough the 210 years of its existence, the Supreme Court and the lower federal courts have refused to defer to every congressional directive. Of the many thousands of laws passed by Congress during that time, only a relative handful have been declared unconstitutional. Congress, however, has never been limited by the concept of judicial review.\n\nIn 1969, Congress passed the Law of the Sea Treaty, requiring payment of 6 percent of the gross national product to the United Nations. In 1974, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the Supreme Court declined to enforce a law in violation of the Constitution, though the Court held that it was \u201cdiscretionary\" and not \u201cmandatory\" for it to do so.

{"idx": 624, "text": "The correct answer is A. We need to pick out the first place where his wife suggested he look for his deodorant, rather than the place where he said he had last seen it.\n\n```\nThe question states that [Lance] complained of his missing deodorant. We need to find out where he had last seen it, in order to find where it is missing from, as implied by the word'remember' in the sentence.\n\nThere are 3 instances of'remember' in this question. In the first instance, Lance says 'I remember buying the stuff last week'. He is trying to tell us where he had last seen his deoderant, i.e. in the grocery store - and that is the first place we must investigate.\n\nFor the second instance of \"remember\" - we must remember that he was asked which place she asked him to look first. Here he tells us that she asked him to look in the grocery - and she has already said this, so we can rule it out.\n\nNow for the third instance of'remember' - this is the one that has most to do with where he has last seen it - Lance says he'remembered that his deodorant was in the bathroom'. She is referring, in this case, to where she asked him to look, because she knows that it is not there.\n\nNow for Lance's last comment - he says that he checked 'the other drawers, bathroom cabinets, and nightstands'. We can take his word for it in this case and assume that he did indeed check all of these places in the bathrooms. We also know, because it's been confirmed by his wife, that the deodorant is not in any of these locations.\n\nThus - the only place this deo could be is in the grocery, because he hasn't checked the grocery yet and that's the only place he knows it can't be in.\n```\n\nInput: An airplane took 5 hours to travel a distance of 600 km at an average speed of 400 km/h.

Wrong guesses are indicated by asterisks, and guess_count tracks the guesses made.\n\nIf the player inputs the exact characters spelled correctly from beginning to end (i.e. \"pierce\"), play_game() is called, which plays the game. If the player inputs the correct characters with a letter not being recognized as a possible letter (e.g. \"pier\" being submitted given that only the letters in the string \"pierce\" are considered possible letters), is_a_guess() is called, which will check if the character is a word. Guesses not in the word are indicated with an asterisk. If the wrong guess is not in the word, then guess_count goes up and guesses are reset. If the guess is in the word, then the letter is guessed, the letter count is decreased by every other letter not being guessed, and is_a_guesses() is called again. After a specified number of incorrect guesses, the function play_game() is finally called, and the player wins or the player loses.\n\n#### Example 3\nYou are given an int[] for the string word. You are also given the number of times the word should be played and a number of incorrect guesses the player is allowed to make before they lose.\n\nYour job is to make a function which, when called, will:\n\n- Increment the correct input letter guess by 1.\n- Reset word_counter to the total amount of letters in the word for the first letter guess.\n- Decrement guess_count by 1.\n\nWhen the player loses, isGameWin() is called. play_game() resets for one more try.\n\n#### Part 1 (8 points):\n\nExpected function header:\n    void play_game();\n\nExpected function content:\n    [Parameters]\n        PlayGame(string word, int guess_count, int tries)\n        void play_game", "answer": "A: nebraska"}

When an answer seems too complicated for a problem to work, there's likely no perfect solution. That said, there might be an infinite number of possibilities, but here, there seems to be only one way to interpret the question. Thus, the right answer would be to say there were no such establishments on that island, or else to say the author is wrong.\n\nInput:2 : a : \"hotel b: \" apartment / b: motels, c: hotels e: residential apartment buildings d: bnbs and hostels\n\nI was able to answer this question by looking at the choices and then guessing the correct answer. After answering the above question, I realized that I had not understood the question. I had thought of the question as referring to all these choices combined, but I suppose the question was asking specifically for one choice. The question is ambiguous as to whether the answers apply to any individual choice or to the set of choices as a whole. Choice D appears to be the only choice with all three components of the question in its options. Therefore, that must be the answer.\n\nInput:B: hotel C:  hotel B: motel E: \"residential estate\" \n\nAnswer: There are several problems with the question as stated.

I want to pick a choice that is likely to confuse anyone other than myself, and to this end I pick Choice C as my incorrect answer. The question asks, \"Where do you wait in reception for a meeting?\" and Choices C and E both reference \"hotels. Choice C seems to refer to Choice A and Choice E to Choice B because they both begin with \" hotel. \" Choice A references a hotel, which would be considered a reception building, whereas Choice C references a \"hotel \".

As 27.5 > 8, potted plant grows faster than 8cm a day. 26 > 8 \u21d2 26 cm * days = 216 cm. Therefore 216 / 26 days = 8 days.

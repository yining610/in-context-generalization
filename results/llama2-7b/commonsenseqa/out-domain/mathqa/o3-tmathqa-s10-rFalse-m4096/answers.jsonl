Well, it is removing some quantity from another quantity. And the simplest form of subtraction involves numbers. 2.

Let's say it's easier to explain with examples. 3. So, 'A' = 5 and 'B' = 3, so we know that A-B equals 2. Another example: A = 7 and B = 4. So A-B equals 3. 4. But we can also use letters for the numbers and still come out with valid results. Take another look at our first example. The value of A-B equals 5. Now if 'A' = 'B' = 6, we can apply that to our equations and say that (6)-(6) = 0. 5. You may ask yourself, why doesn't 7-7=0? It is true that this equation holds true, but only in this case.

The following is typical: A set of words may be substituted within a paragraph of text in such a way that the meanings of the words do not change when they are substitu\u2026t. Here's an example of the first type of question: Given the paragraph, what does the word \"but\" refer to? Let's do the paragraph and highlight all of the possibilities for the word \"but\": a) The people are disgruntled, and have no money. b) But they do have money, and enjoy themselves. c) They are disgruntled because they have money and enjoy themselves. There are many ways to think about these kinds of questions. My advice is to not memorize any one way. If you can look at these in the abstract, they all fall into the same general formula: a) Look for an attribute in a paragraph, and assume it may have multiple alternatives. b) Ask yourself if the \"answer choice\" fits as a possible substitute for the attribute. c) If it does, choose the answer. Otherwise, the other answer is correct. Hope this helps!

Therefore, in order to get the answer, 1+3/5=4/5, and C is the answer.\n\nb) First, we know that the total age of A and B is 11yrs more than the total age between B and C. To get the least number of matches needed, we subtract the age of A and B by the total age difference between B and C. In other words, we know 11-x, where x>= 6, the least number of matches A and B need to win in order to get to the 40pt mark. The minimum is 6 (which I got by trial an error.)\n\nc) First, We get the number of matches that A and B won by making them the left and right hand sides of a fraction, which is.

You are going to use the functions that you used to build your program as the basis for the computer you write. The program and the instructions you used to create the program will be given to your miniature computer in the form of instructions to follow.  To get started with the computer, you must first decide how you would like the computer to work. You could design a program that uses a 3 x 4 grid with the 4th column of numbers being the first element of your program.  You could create a program that begins with the first element of your code being the number 1 and counts to 20. The computer program would then tell you how many times to repeat 1 and you would repeat it that many times.  There are tons of computer program possibilities but you need to choose one first. After choosing your computer program, you will then need to create the instruction sheets to give the computer. You must use the symbols to represent the basic programming language concepts such as AND, OR, and NOT  (and / and is not the same as and / and is not the symbol used to divide something.  In our class, you will use this symbol to represent the AND operator that we use to evaluate a boolean expression).  You could use the following template to create your instruction sheets :  < 2^0 > AND < 2^0 >= 8  AND < 2^1 > OR < 2^0 OR < 2^1 >= 8  AND NOT < 2^0 AND < 2^2 >= 8  AND  < 2^1 AND < 2^3 >= 8  AND Not < 2^2 AND < 2^4 >= 8  AND...  >\n\n< 2^0 > 1  AND  < 5^1 >= 15  AND <  8^2 >= 15  >\n\nOutput:\n\nInput:You are driving down the street and come to a four-way intersection where cars are lined up waiting to turn.

The Year of the Goat is one of the symbols of the Taoist philosophy,it seems that everything depends on balance.There is always a relationship between the opposites,Yin and Yang.The Goat,like the other beasts,represents the yang.The combination of two animals,a goat and a mouse, indicates two yangs.Thus,the combination of Yin and Yang seems to signify the harmony with which the universe is composed.The Chinese think that the Goat is elegant.It is a beautiful and clever character, with a soft nature and a tread softening the mind.\n\n3.  There are 5 elements:metal\uff0cwood,water,fire,earth, which represent the whole of the universe,the elements in nature,and human beings,in the Chinese philosophy.They are the base for the formation of the five Chinese zodiac animals.The Goat is a metal element.The Goat's color is black or white.Black goat represents the cold year and the white goat represents the warm year.\n\n\n\n4.Whenever the Chinese New Year comes, people will have family reunions and eat together.The family will also put up a New Year's Tree; on it are hung peach buns and glutinous rice cakes.The Chinese New Year is also called the Lunar New Year or Spring Festival, it is a time of great happiness and joy,when family,relatives and friends gather together to celebrate.It is a time when young people in particular look forward to the new year,", "answer": "D: space shuttle"}

{"idx": 822, "text": "B\n\n### Solution:\n\nThis problem may seem simple enough, but the answer turns out to be tricky.\n\nIn order to solve this problem, a couple of things have to be done. First, calculate the percentage of the 1200 votes that were void:\n```\nvoidVotedInAbsentia= voidVotes_Total / 1200\n```\nNote that the `()` notation defines the calculation's name. Calculate the same value for the votes that were cast correctly:\n```\nvalidatedVotes_Total / absenteeTotal * 100\n```\nNotice that I divided the total number of votes by 1200, since that's how many absentee ballots were casted.\n\nSubtract the percentage of void votes from the percentage of validated votes. I'll use the `%` symbol like in math class, but you can easily replace it by the `-` operator if you don't want to use '%'.\n\n`validatedVotes%voidVotes`\n\nThe result is `639`. Now, we can move on to calculating the final result, since we know that the rest of the absentee ballots go to Candidate B. This means that we can say that 100% of the validated votes won't be enough to win the election, since Candidate A has a 3rd of them.\n\nThus the rest of the vote will go to Candidate A, leaving a 281-vote gap that will also be in favour of Candidate B.\n\nIf we want the percentages of votes for each candidate out of the total votes after the calculation, we can just divide the result by `totalVotes - 1`.\n\n```\nvalidatedBallots / (1200 - 1)\n```\nThe final result for this question is `4590/1200 -1 = 3941/1199`.\n\n# 1155_2\n\nInput: in each of the following math equations, the answer is given : if the correct answer to each of the questions is the same as the given answer, which one of the equations is not correct? a ) ( 4 - 9 ) + ( 1 - 6 ) =", "answer": "D: sadness"}

Education is being conducted at government facilities for a fixed time each day. Health is provided at private hospitals. The number of hospital admissions needed to be treated must not be greater than the number of classroom days available each week.

{"idx": 928, "text": "A\n\nAnswer: We have four questions of the kind, each with slightly different format.  This post details exactly how to answer the questions using Python. The details include:\nhow to represent questions as a grammar, how to get answers to those grammars, and how to get answers for slightly different grammars that contain the same questions. We also deal with some edge cases where different rules may result in the same grammatical tree and what to do in that case.\n\nFor all of the examples, the string input is exactly as given in the post. The code is at the bottom.\n\n### Background :\n\nIn a general manner, we can think of the question set as a grammar. Let's go through the grammar as an example.\n\nGiven 1200 1200 votes for the candidate and 1 / 6 1/6  votes were disqualified.\n\nNow let's define a sentence S = 3591.\n\nThe rule of the grammar in this example is \"S --> E, D\".\n\nIn this grammar, E and D mean:\n\nE = \"1200 votes were cast for candidate A.\"\nD = \"1 / 6 of those votes were disqualified.\"\n\nNow, in our grammar, we want to define a rule for \"A received how many votes?\".\n\nFor the grammar to still be valid, we need to define a rule where the result will always be in \"a, b, c, d, or e\" form.\n\nTo accomplish this, we look at the number of rules A and D, and modify the rules to get an expected output from the grammar.\n\nIn this case, E = a and D = b, so A = c and the grammar is now valid.\n\n\nLet us now look at the other three questions on the same grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is valid, questions 1, 2, and 4 will all have the same answer.\n\nLet us use the same S in all of them: 3591\n\nWe can now look at question 3.\n\n\nWe can say that:\n\nA = 1200 + (1 / 6) which equals c.\n\nAs per our definitions, E = a and A = c.\n\nThus, E = c, so", "answer": "D: junk yard"}

How many absentee votes cast\n\nIf you count on your hands, the last one will always be more than your first one, since you subtracted in an odd position.\n\nHence, the answer is 1 + ( 1 - 1200 / 1200 ) + (1 - 12 / 120 ) = 1199 + 1 + 1 / 120 = 1200 + 1 = 1201\n\n#### 2. How many years younger than A.\n\nFirst find the difference between B and C, then apply the inverse of the operation:\nC \u2013 B = 7\n\nB \u2013 A = 16\n\nHence the answer is:\n\nC \u2013 (B \u2013 A) = 7 \u2013 16 = -9\n\n\n#### 3.

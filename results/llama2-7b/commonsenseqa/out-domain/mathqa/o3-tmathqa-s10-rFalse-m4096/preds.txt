Well, it is removing some quantity from another quantity. And the simplest form of subtraction involves numbers. 2. Let's call 'A' the value of the number on the left and 'B' the value of the <n>number on the right. The value of the subtraction equals B less A, so it's A - B. How does this work? Let's say it's easier to explain with examples. 3. So, 'A' = 5 and 'B' = 3, so we know that A-B equals 2. Another example: A = 7 and B = 4. So A-B equals 3. 4. But we can also use letters for the numbers and still come out with valid results. Take another look at our first example. The value of A-B equals 5. Now if 'A' = 'B' = 6, we can apply that to our equations and say that (6)-(6) = 0. 5. You may ask yourself, why doesn't 7-7=0? It is true that this equation holds true, but only in this case. Let's say I have a number and I divide it by 0. We know that it'

The following is typical: A set of words may be substituted within a paragraph of text in such a way that the meanings of the words do not change when they are substitu…t. Here's an example of the first type of question: Given the paragraph, what does the word "but" refer to? Let's do the paragraph and highlight all of the possibilities for the word "but": a) The people are disgruntled, and have no money. b) But they do have money, and enjoy themselves. c) They are disgruntled because they have money and enjoy themselves. There are many ways to think about these kinds of questions. My advice is to not memorize any one way. If you can look at these in the abstract, they all fall into the same general formula: a) Look for an attribute in a paragraph, and assume it may have multiple alternatives. b) Ask yourself if the "answer choice" fits as a possible substitute for the attribute. c) If it does, choose the answer. Otherwise, the other answer is correct. Hope this helps!

Choices:  A: blisters B: frustration C: being paid D: make money E: money<n>Output:		B<n><n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>a) The only way we know that 12% of absentee ballets got thrown out and 3/5 of the remaining 88% ballets went to Candidate A is the fact the 3/5 were added to and 12% were subtracted from 88%. Therefore, in order to get the answer, 1+3/5=4/5, and C is the answer.<n><n>b) First, we know that the total age of A and B is 11yrs more than the total age between B and C. To get the least number of matches needed, we subtract the age of A and B by the total age difference between B and C. In other words, we know 11-x, where x>= 6, the least number of matches A and B need to win in order to get to the 40pt mark. The minimum is 6 (which I got by trial an error.)<n><n>c) First, We get the number of matches that A and B won by making them the left and right hand sides of a fraction, which is. Now, we subtract the 14pts A and B obtained from the 16 (least number of matches B and C need to win in order for them to both score 40pts by the end of the competition) to get our answer, which is 2, or option 2.

You are going to use the functions that you used to build your program as the basis for the computer you write. The program and the instructions you used to create the program will be given to your miniature computer in the form of instructions to follow.  To get started with the computer, you must first decide how you would like the computer to work. You could design a program that uses a 3 x 4 grid with the 4th column of numbers being the first element of your program.  You could create a program that begins with the first element of your code being the number 1 and counts to 20. The computer program would then tell you how many times to repeat 1 and you would repeat it that many times.  There are tons of computer program possibilities but you need to choose one first. After choosing your computer program, you will then need to create the instruction sheets to give the computer. You must use the symbols to represent the basic programming language concepts such as AND, OR, and NOT  (and / and is not the same as and / and is not the symbol used to divide something.  In our class, you will use this symbol to represent the AND operator that we use to evaluate a boolean expression).  You could use the following template to create your instruction sheets :  < 2^0 > AND < 2^0 >= 8  AND < 2^1 > OR < 2^0 OR < 2^1 >= 8  AND NOT < 2^0 AND < 2^2 >= 8  AND  < 2^1 AND < 2^3 >= 8  AND Not < 2^2 AND < 2^4 >= 8  AND...  ><n><n>< 2^0 > 1  AND  < 5^1 >= 15  AND <  8^2 >= 15  ><n><n>Output:<n><n>Input:You are driving down the street and come to a four-way intersection where cars are lined up waiting to turn.

The difference is 5, 6 or 7, so the answer is C=8 matches<n>### Question3:<n>There are 5 matches left to reach the goal, so 1 more match for A and 4 for B.

First, calculate the percentage of the 1200 votes that were void:<n>```<n>voidVotedInAbsentia= voidVotes_Total / 1200<n>```<n>Note that the `()` notation defines the calculation's name. Calculate the same value for the votes that were cast correctly:<n>```<n>validatedVotes_Total / absenteeTotal * 100<n>```<n>Notice that I divided the total number of votes by 1200, since that's how many absentee ballots were casted.<n><n>Subtract the percentage of void votes from the percentage of validated votes.

The government decided to invest one in health and the other in education, allocating KD of the available annual budget to each one of them. We consider the value of KD to be large and we want to maximize the combined output of education and health. The country has total amount of KD available to spend on both projects. Education is being conducted at government facilities for a fixed time each day. Health is provided at private hospitals. The number of hospital admissions needed to be treated must not be greater than the number of classroom days available each week. In other words, one cannot go to a hospital each day, nor can one attend to school every day. A. What is the problem in question and what type of problem is it? B. What are the mathematical formulations of the problem? C. Use an optimization model to solve it.<n>Output: A. It is a linear program B. The mathematical formulation of the problem is: Maximize Z = 1 KD + Sx E + KDy where x and y are the numbers of patients treated in health and the classroom days used in education respectively. S is the time needed to be taught in an education program. x and y should be less than KD. C. The objective function is maximized or Z is as high as possible. The constraint should be added to ensure that students be allowed to go to school, and the constraint on health should be added to ensure students are in good health. D. Use an LP solver tool such as Microsoft Excel Solver to answer the question.

This post details exactly how to answer the questions using Python. The details include:<n>how to represent questions as a grammar, how to get answers to those grammars, and how to get answers for slightly different grammars that contain the same questions. We also deal with some edge cases where different rules may result in the same grammatical tree and what to do in that case.<n><n>For all of the examples, the string input is exactly as given in the post. The code is at the bottom.<n><n>### Background :<n><n>In a general manner, we can think of the question set as a grammar. Let's go through the grammar as an example.<n><n>Given 1200 1200 votes for the candidate and 1 / 6 1/6  votes were disqualified.<n><n>Now let's define a sentence S = 3591.<n><n>The rule of the grammar in this example is "S --> E, D".<n><n>In this grammar, E and D mean:<n><n>E = "1200 votes were cast for candidate A."<n>D = "1 / 6 of those votes were disqualified."<n><n>Now, in our grammar, we want to define a rule for "A received how many votes?".<n><n>For the grammar to still be valid, we need to define a rule where the result will always be in "a, b, c, d, or e" form.<n><n>To accomplish this, we look at the number of rules A and D, and modify the rules to get an expected output from the grammar.<n><n>In this case, E = a and D = b, so A = c and the grammar is now valid.<n><n><n>Let us now look at the other three questions on the same grammar.<n><n>Since the grammar is valid, questions 1, 2, and 4 will all have the same answer.<n><n>Let us use the same S in all of them: 3591<n><n>We can now look at question 3.<n><n><n>We can say that:<n><n>A = 1200 + (1 / 6) which equals c.<n><n>As per our definitions, E = a and A = c.<n><n>Thus, E = c, so

How many absentee votes cast<n><n>If you count on your hands, the last one will always be more than your first one, since you subtracted in an odd position.<n><n>Hence, the answer is 1 + ( 1 - 1200 / 1200 ) + (1 - 12 / 120 ) = 1199 + 1 + 1 / 120 = 1200 + 1 = 1201<n><n>#### 2.

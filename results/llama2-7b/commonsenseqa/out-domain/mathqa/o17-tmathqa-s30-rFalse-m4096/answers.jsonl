It is asked to subtract 1 from the mean value and divide by 2, where 1 is added in place of 145 to obtain the final value of 141. This is called rearranging.\n\nThe mean of the rearranged sequence is obtained by division.\n\nThe correct mean is obtained by rounding off the quotient.\n\nThe mean of 30 correct values is 140. However by mistake 145 had been entered. Once the correct value had been entered, the mean obtained is 140, and it turns out to be the correct mean of 30 numbers.\n\n#### 7 1 5:\n\nThere is a rectangular box, its dimensions are 25 cm x 24 cm and 18 cm, the volume of a largest sphere that can be  inscribed in the box is 288 / \u03c0.\n\nThe dimensions of the box are in terms of 25 and 18.\n\nThe volume (V) of a ball inscribed in the box that has a diameter of 25 cm is obtained by multiplying base and height.\n\nUsing \u03c0 \u2248 22 / 7.\n\nFrom the given dimensions, we can deduce that the height of the biggest sphere that can be insured in the box is 18 cm.\n\nThe correct volume of the biggest sphere that will fit in the box ( in \u03c0 cm 3 units, i.e. 288 ) is obtained by solving 25 h = V, where h is 18 ( the height of the cylinder)\n\nSince two numbers have l. c. m = 9, then their h. c. f = 1 / ( 9) ( 9) = 9. The numbers are x  = 1 and y = 1.\n\nx + y is odd.\n\n1 + 1 = 2 ( which is odd)\n\n#### 7, 1 6:\n\nIn order to find the cost to make x = 62 small cubes, 62 is multiplied by the price of 62 cubes.\n\nIf it", "answer": "B: france"}

The only even numbers are 2,4,6,8,10, because of division rules. (3,5,7,9 are odd) The range of the ages is 2-12, or [2, 12); 12 is a difference of 4 from the midpoint of the range. [(10/2)*(28/12) + 2]\n\nFor the fifth grade we get (6+10)*(5+10) or 6*4=8, so we get a difference of 3 or 6.

{"idx": 845, "text": "A\n\n## Explanation:\nIn most of the questions there is something that would be the same. We just need to extract that something and keep that constant in place.\n\neg:- first question ask for correct average of 10 values. The given average is 13 and the difference between the last and the first is 12. So obviously the number is 140.\n\neg:-The second question is little tappy, but we know that the product of any 3 whole numbers is always a square number. SO the only possible options would be 151 or 152.\n\neg:-3rd Question. The fraction of pi is almost equal to 1. The volume of the box would be equal to that of the sphere inscribed inside it except a fraction. Eg- For volume of sphere with diameter of 3 m, 4/3*pi.\n\n\neg:-4th Question. The highest ratio of whole numbers is 7/11\n\neg:-5th. The answer is 401, because it is given that if a and b run the race, then a always starts with a headstart of 3/10 of the race that b runs.\n\neg:-6th. This is very simple. It is not required to check the mean and then calculate the remainder. We can calculate the remainder directly by dividing the dividend and divisor by 7, and we get the remainder as 7.\n\neg:-7th, instead of dividing, we can multiply the cost with 7/10 to get the real cost.\n\neg:-8th. The answer would be 152\n\neg:-9th In this one also the given answer is 140, we need to find the right remainder if 62 small cubes are used to make large cube. Eg- 65. In this way there would be only two numbers giving same remainder of 3 if we subtract them. 62 and 65. The ratio would be 1 : 2. 2 : 1\n\neg:-10th The answer would be 9\n\n  eg:-11th The ratio of speed of boat to speed of water is 22 :9,because the boat increases the speed if it runs against the stream and decreases if it runs with the stream.\n\neg", "answer": "C: body armor"}

{"idx": 897, "text": "A or B\n\n### TIPS:\n\n- a good strategy to solving mathematical word problems is to always remember to \nthink of what quantities are given, what quantities are asked for, and what could be\nasked for. It is important to keep a constant check on the equations as well as the\ndata you have.\n- You ought to be very careful when selecting your answer, and check whether\nsomething stands out as incorrect. For example, in 15. If you had written that if\nr is the ratio then it should come out to 7/11, you are correct, but if you\nwrite that, then you should also write that b is the ratio to 7/10, you do not check out for the other ratio of the two or the ratio to itself. The\nanswer is d because the other solutions are incorrect or incorrect when written.\n- Another thing to keep in mind when you look at an actual test is that you\nreally ought to be reading all of the information and understanding what is\nsaid to understand the question more efficiently. So if you are going through problems don't assume that you will be able to do all the problems.", "answer": "C: record store"}

Python seems to me best suited to interactive learning (through PyCharm and other IDEs, and REPL).\n\nAnswer: I'm assuming that Python does not have an unlimited number of input/output pairs for tests and that you mean [random testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_coverage). In case Python does allow an unlimited number of random inputs/outputs, please edit your question to provide this additional information.\n\nIn Python 3.x you can use the `input()` function to read input from the user. `print()` outputs text. A better way to read from the user is the `raw_input()` function in Python 3.x, as `raw_input()` allows any type of input to be given except for `\\0x00` (the character used to denote a string terminator in C). A function similar to `input()` can be created from `raw_input()`, but I'm not familiar with Python 2.x so I don't know what the equivalent function is (if there is one).\n\nI recommend using the `%` symbol in the `for` loop. For example:\n\n\\begin{code}\n    for row in data_csv:\n        data_row = []\n        for data in row:\n            data_row.append(data_str2decimal(data))\nprint data_row\n\\end{code}.\n\nThere is already a function `str_to_int` so you shouldn't need to write a function to", "answer": "A: person"}

If one of the wires breaks when 8 birds are on it, why does the other not break? Choices:(1) Wire has sufficient strength to bear the weight of 300 lbn. so the weight of 8 birds divided by the strength of the wire is 300, which is less than 300. (2) Wire has strength, it just broke. It will not break again.(3) Wire is weak. It broke for just a moment when the 8 birds were on it. It will not be strong enough to support the weight of 9 birds on it. So the 9 birds must all move to the other wire. (4) Wire has strength. It broke when the 8 birds put their weight on it. Because they are 8 in number. The total weight is 300 ln. Divide 300 by 2 (8), which gives 150 and this number is less than 359, hence the wire will not break\nOutput:(4)\n\nInput:What are the two numbers such that the number in between them is not divisible by either of them?

{"idx": 384, "text": "B\n\nThis is an implementation of a \"categorization tree\" with Python.\n\nThe categorization tree will tell us of the choices available and how each choice relates to another.\n\nIn these questions, there are 5 choices. \n\nFor example, in Q5, the correct answer is 80, however, 80 is categorized as 'a'.\n\n80 is the first category, and this category has 2 choices 'a' and 'b' where choice 'a' is correct.\n\nTherefore, we can take category 'a' and we will get: \n\n'a' has 2 choices and the correct one is 'b', and 'b' has 1 category that is correct, and the correct one is 11.25. \n\nThis can be summarized as [11.25, 11.26] and it's the second category in the tree. \n\nIn this particular case, the choices are numbered from top to bottom then left to right.\n\nTo solve Q6 with Python, you will take all of the choice and number them from top to bottom and left to right if they are categorized in a left to right order, otherwise, you will number the answers from top to bottom.\n\nYou might find it useful to use nested Python lists to store the choices.\n\nIn Q1, the question states that 12% of 80 is 9.6 while the correct answer is 11.6. \n\nHowever, 12% is a percentage, so what you write that is correct should be 11.6 - and this should be converted to 9.36.\n\nIf you are a programmer, make sure you understand the difference between a 'choice' and 'a specific number'. \n\nYou could solve Q3 with nested Python lists using the code: \n\nlist_of_list = [ [ [x, x] for x in [('0-4', '20-30'),('21-40', '20-40')]  ] for i in range(2)]\n\nOutput: [ [(60, 80), (80, 100)], [(90, 105), (105, 110)] ]", "answer": "C: happiness"}

Next, you can set the variable's values: let x = 3, y = 4. Next, you can print the contents of the variable: let x = 20, y = 50. print(\"x = \", x). Also, printing the contents of a variable, you can use a double quote to surround it: print(\"y = \", y).\n\nOutput: A: bounce the\n\nInput:He scored five goals.

To determine the value of x=-3 solve -9=x+-3 giving x=-6; this will be the value you are looking to solve. You can use this value in -6=-9 to solve y for and then put this result into the second equation 3x-2(-6)=-x so 3x-12=-16. The value of x is 1; therefore y=-x so the team's time is 1/1 of the time spent on competition.\n\nOutput: A\n\nInput:x=a,y=b,z=c; now the first equation becomes a+b+c=1 and the second is a-2b=-a.

The word \"percentage\" can be substituted for the words \"increase by\" or \" multiply by \". So \"20 percent\" means 20 *, \" 100 percent\" means 100 *, and so on.\n\nNow, let us recall what exponents are all about. An exponent on the second side of the multiplication tells us how many times we are multiplying. For example, 5 ^ 3 means multiply 5 by itself three times.\n\n% is used to find the change of a ratio between the numerator and the denominator of the ratio. To solve a %.

So far he has amassed??? in assets.\nOutput: 'The goal' is replaced by 'fortune'. So the sentence is 'He has only ever had the fortune to gain riches'. Wealthy means \"possessing great wealth or making a great deal of money.\" Wealth is a great fortune. So we combine the two, and get \"He has only ever had a great fortune to gain riches\". So if we replace \"gain riches\" by \"wealth\" we have \"He has only ever great a fortune to gain wealth.\" But the question asks for the answer to be assets.

The launching platform also serves to launch large ships into the water. Explanation: The correct answer should be \"F\". Aircraft carrier (often referred to as \"CV\", for \"aircraft carrier\") is a type of warship that serves as a \"floating airbase\" for aircraft operations. They are equipped with a full-length flight deck and hangar for fixed-wing aircraft (although if they are equipped with helicopters, some smaller ships might be classed as aircraft carriers).Aircraft carriers are generally used as part of aircraft carrier battle groups.

These medicines may be taken orally or given through infusions. An overdose of either medicine may kill the individual. The chances of an overdosage are 1/3 when both medicines are used simultaneously and 3/4 when the drugs are used individually. Each medication has a probability of death of 1/12. The physician must decide whether or not to give the person one of the medicines. If he decides that one medicine is given, then he should apply the same rule with one medicine as if he were to apply the rule for two medicines if he could choose between the two.

All of the above are true of the function value. None of the above statements are true of the function\nOutput: All of the above are TRUE.\nSo the final answer for d, is TRUE.\n\nImportant Notes :\n\n1. Explanation : \"In any real functions, the function value is the \"y\" in the real life formula y = x * y, where x is real. For any rea l number, this will be a single point and then the \"y\" in this formula will have a single value and is known as the function value of the function at the real number x for which we want to calculate the function value ( a real number x, for which we want the function value ). for this y = f(x) where x is a number and ( x ) refers to the value at which we want the function at that particular number or point.\"\n\nThis is why the question is set in such a way that we are given choices like \"remember\" and then we are asked to choose which is correct one from them and not like \"if it is illegal to remember then it is not\". So it is clear that the answer to this is \"remember\" but if I have any other choice like \"help\" or anything else the answer would be none of these. And that is why it is necessary to consider and provide choices like this in such question.\n\n2. Explanation : The \"none of these\" choice is chosen in the question, when this kind of doubt arises. This might seem like an outrageous choice which does not fit anywhere, but in maths this is the best kind of choice and the most accurate one. In this case the choice is \"None of These\" and hence the answer should be \"True\".", "answer": "C: count"}

Select one word that does not belong with each group of words in the following text. 2. The three-step trick to getting a perfect score on this GRE question!\n\nExplanation: The phrase that describes a feeling of extreme fear is \u201cpetronela\u201d. It does not belong with the words \u201celegiaco\u201d and \u201cagudo\u201d. This is a good example of a type of trap that is found on a GRE sentence equivalence question. Be careful to look at the entire sentence before choosing which word is incorrect.\n\nAnswer: Select one word that does does not belong with eachgroup of words in the followingtext. The three-step tricketo getting aperfect score on this GREQuestion!\n\nAnswer : Petronela \n\nStep 1: Petronela is not the most accurate translation of the Spanish word \u201cpetronela\u201d, which is used to describe a \u201cdramatic\u201d or \u201cmelodramatic\u201d feeling of love or fear. The most direct translation would be \u201cpetrified\u201d. So, although it is grammatically correct to insert the word \u201cpetronela\u201d in this sentence, it doesn\u2019t quite suit the context.\n\nStep 2: However, because the author of the sentence is looking for a \u201cpetronela\u201d-like word or phrase, it\u2019s possible that you could get away with answering \u201celegiac\u201d instead. Although the author does not clearly state it, it is possible that they are referring to a feeling of extreme fear. In this context, it is possible that a \u201cpetronela-like\u201d feeling can be described as \u201cagudo\u201d (sharp) or \u201caguda\u201d (sharp). Since there is no clearly correct answer, it is best to select one of the choices that most closely matches the word or phrase described, rather than choosing the one that best suits the context.\n\nInput: The car's speed is faster than the truck and the bus.

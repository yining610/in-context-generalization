So?\n\n### Output:\nThe output, with the only correct answer being option 3, 4,00 is not at all difficult, as you would imagine. This problem, which only looks difficult at the start, can be solved through logic. You should always try not to write the answer to your problem on a sheet of paper. This will only increase your time, and you must be fast enough to solve this question.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n* In a simple math problem, the question doesn\u2019t make a sense as it is too big to be processed in your brain. But here it is important that you see the question through a set of eyes in your brain with a clear focus on the numbers.\n\n* In a math problem, it might seem daunting to find out where to start with, but in this case, you should always have the \u2018right\u2019 answer in your head.\n\n* The trick in this case is to break the question at a smaller level, and see how many \u2018ballots\u2019 you have been talking about in your head.\n* From that point, if you have been having trouble solving that problem, then you will be able to solve this question as well.\n\nThe answer is 2,00. The answer appears to be 2,00 because the math problem is so large that it is not possible to use your pen and paper to process it. Instead, you must convert it to the right amount through your brain.\n\nInput: The head-to-head game, when 50/50, the election, when 12,000 absentees were voted and 1/6 were thrown away, but 1/5 of the remaining cast their votes for candidate A.

The number of absentee votes cast for candidate b was 40% more than the number of absentee, whose votes were not thrown out of the total. The sum of the remaining total was 80% of the total votes. By applying basic algebraic manipulations, the total number of absentee ballots cast can be easily calculated. It is clear that that number of absentee candidates was ( 2 / 3 + 3 / 5 ) times that of the total votes cast. This clearly proves that c is the correct answer.\n Input: The problem here asks for the least number of games left to be played to reach 40 points. the total age of the players is 11 more than the total age. c is 16 years because 11 times 16 = 168, and the final result of this calculation is 168 minus 11 which is 157.\n Input: To reduce volume by 75 %, 3 parts should be added to bring the required percentage of reduction.

You must discuss the problem with your partner and try to find how much this problem will be useful for you.\n\nLet's move on to the next problem.

As 3/5 of the remaining voters favor B, we subtract 3/5 from the 1200 to give us 2/5 or 800 more voters.\n\n2.\nThe correct answer is :\"E\". We find the required number of votes in favour Candidates B by dividing the total voters (say 1.2) by the total votes (say 0.2), we find the rest of the voters are in favour of B and hence 9 would be his total votes.\n\n3.\nThe answer is :\"B\", the maximum number of wins to reach the 41 point mark is 7. The solution then is to win one more game.\n\n4.\nThe correct answer would be 'E', the ratio of concentration of alcohol :original solution is 2 : 1. 14 litres out of 30 to get to a concentration of 10 : 6 requires 7.5 more litres to reach the mark in the solution. We take the original concentration and double it to get to the 100 : 50 ratio. Adding 7.5 to that, the liquid is at 200 : 37.5 concentration. Now convert again (150 : 25): original concentration to know how much more is required for a concentration of 0 : 0.75 ratio.\n\n5.\nThe answer is 'B', 14 litres of pure alcohol was given to us while we had to make a 20% alcohol solution. So the total volume of volume of the mixture would be 200/20. Therefore the final volume of water neede to make the solution would be 25 liters.\n\n6.\nThe correct answer for this question would be: 'A' the length of this train is: 470 m\n\n7.\nThe answer for the above question would be: 'C' to add 75% more water, we just have to take away twice the original amount.

Choices:  Amoeba is a primitive unicellular eukaryote with distinct parts. It was the first eukaryotic organism to develop. It is also one of the first life-forms to emerge on earth. It evolved from the primitive bacteria. It is believed to have been around for over 2.5 billion years. It is believed to be more sensitive to changes in its environment than any other organism alive today. It is made up of just one cell. It is called Amoeba to describe its ability to change shape. The body of the amoeba consists of several membrane-covered organelles (basic units of structure within cells). This helps determine the movement of the organism. This is because the cells' surface expands and contracts constantly. These organelles include contractile and adhesive cilia and flagella (short, protoplasm-filled, hairlike tubes), and contractile vacuoles (bubbles in the cytoplasm that expel excess water). It is made up mainly of amoebocytes, amoebas and pseudopodia. These are long, slender, protoplasmic streamers that come out of a cell's cytoplasm to move over the surrounding medium by contractile motion (movement due to action of muscle tissues). The nucleus is located near the center of each pseudopodium. It is only seen when the cell reaches a certain stage in its lifecycle. Its nucleus is usually not located in the nucleus. It can reproduce by both sexual and asexual or vegetative means. The vegetative reproduction of an amoebae is called binary", "answer": "B: body of water"}

{"idx": 855, "text": "### Answer: Choice d, the kitchen\nGrape wine from the California region and champagne from France are examples of fermented, distilled and distilled liquor. \nGrapes are used to make wines. They don't go straight from the stem of the plant into a tasting glass. The grape mash makes its way through several stages of fermentation in a complex process of production. \nThe process of fermentation is what changes the fruits in to alcohol, and then the wines. In essence, fermentation is a chemical reaction that happens when the yeasts feed on the fermentable sugars and release carbon dioxide. \nThe amount of alcohol in wine is determined by the process of fermentation. Wines made using all-natural yeast have a dry crisp taste, they also are relatively bitter. For sweet white wines, the extraction process of residual sugar from the grape juice is applied instead of fermentation. This is how the process works: \nSugar to Ethanol: Once fermentation has been added, there are two types of sugar available: glucose and fructose. In wines that are dry, there is very little sugar left after fermentation, and yeast dies. \nIn sweet white wines, residual sugar is extracted from the grape juices. Most residual sugar is removed during the fermentation process, but a small amount of sugar could be left in the wine, especially in wines that use no added yeast. Because yeast is an animal, it has a low tolerance for alcohol. If the alcohol level gets above 16 percent in the wine, it is in danger of bursting open. For this reason, most wines do not exceed 16 percent alcohol.\n#", "answer": "B: wine press"}

An irregular expression, or regex, in its most general sense is also a string; a string is a set of characters chosen from a given alphabet (for example, letters, digits, and spaces). A regular expression may consist solely of basic metacharacters, elements that may occur in any regular expression.\n\n## Writing regular expressions\nWritten text is a string of (usually alphabetic) symbols. Words are often separated by spaces, periods. When you use regular expressions, you are searching for patterns in a string, where a pattern is a repeating sequence of characters. When two characters match, they are said to be a \u201cmatch.\u201d\nFor example, you may want to find instances of the word \u201cthe\u201d in a large sample of texts. If the text was a sentence, you may be able to use a single regex, where it matched the word in all its variants: the, the\u2019 and \u2018the\u2019.\n\nHowever, there is no need to use a single regex to identify the word the. There\u2019s no point to include \u2018the,\u2019 since you already covered the\u2019. You can find matches for the without having to use a special regex for the.\n\n## Validating and Matching\nWhen we use regular expressions in programming, we use them to find patterns in text. In this guide we\u2019ll demonstrate how to do this by using a library built on top of regexes.\n\nSince we\u2019ll be handling regexes on behalf of the user, we must validate their input. In the section below we\u2019ll validate our user input and demonstrate using some of the common operators found in regular expressions.\n\n### Basic Valid", "answer": "E: school"}

Choose your opinion.\n\nIf the two statements together are sufficient answer (e) if not answer (d) if it is not necessary to answer the question in that case choose(b)\n\n\n\n## Question Set No. - 1\n### Instruction:Answer the questions that follow a set of passage.\n\nOne important distinction in our view is the division into public and private entities: the public domain is made up of entities in which government can act with authority for the public good as its sole motivation, while the private domain is made up of organizations in which owners do not govern according to an overriding mandate beyond narrow interest maximization.\n\nA second distinction is one of ownership: when a private entity performs public functions, it is often said to be a \"privatization.\" For instance, in response to declining popular support, governments often privatize functions and services traditionally performed by government, shifting the risks and the benefits to the private sector. In the process, government has abdicated its authority to set the rules of the game, the level of services provided, and the use of the resources under its control. There is no reason why a similar or similar logic can\u00b4t be applied to charities.\n\nThe public domain should therefore include charities as well as governments engaged in public functioning. To be sure, public actors who do good are motivated to some degree by the good they produce.\n\nBut the public domain is distinct from the private domain in that it is guided by authority and in the broad public interest rather than sole private interest, and that its mandates are based on broad societal consensus rather than a contractual relationship of employment or a business deal. Even when the decision makers in a private entity are motivated by a broader mandate than a narrow self-interest, they can still be influenced easily by those whose interests they can serve. Hence accountability can still be a problem in private sectors.\n\nGovernment in the public domain serves the public interest through processes", "answer": "C: bound"}

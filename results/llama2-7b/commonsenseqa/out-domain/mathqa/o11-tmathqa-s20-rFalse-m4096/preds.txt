Now, if we convert it to its decimal equivalent, 239, we see that the 7's are missing. So, we put in the corresponding numbers. 0702 + 1011 + 702 = 1907, which in binary is 1010011.

Now from the question given, we notice that the ratio between the man and bus is "1 : 3". So to solve for the time interval between consecutive <n>buses.<n><n>We have to first solve for the time interval given when the man meets the first bus which is 18 minutes. So in 6 minutes the bus meets him again that will be 18(6)/6 in this time  the man also cover 6minutes(his speed). <n>So 18(6/6) = 18 x 10/6 = 30 minutes  So the interval between the buses meeting the man can be calculated. So the time required for bus to go to another bus is 18 + 6 = 24 minutes.   <n><n>So for buses every 24 minutes after that they meet at any point in the given route in 24(18) seconds interval that means the time required for this bus to cover the given route is 432 minutes (72 minutes each bus).  <n><n>Thus taking the ratio as 18:6:24 we get   18 + 6:24 = 36 seconds. So 36 seconds it takes for bus to cover the distance when they meet. So we get <n><n>(18 + 6) x 36 = 144 + 216 = 360 seconds for bus to cover the given distance.<n><n><n></p></summary><n></details><n><n></details><n><details><summary >Solution: A,B,C,D,E Problems</summary><n><summary><p

Options are 6.5 mins 10 mins 12 mins and 14 mins. Answer is busses don't move at constant speed it can't be 12 min gap. It would be same as 12 minutes and 14 minutes gap. The cyclist is faster than buses and bicycles and hence in future also same gap. He only makes a difference in first 3 intervals. so interval between buses would be 6.5 min. Answer is c<n>input: A Athlete runs 20 metres race in 33 seconds. what is his speed. Options are 4km/hr 30 km/hr 26 km/hr and 45 km/hr. Answer is b coz speed is 60 sec / 33 sec = 1.8 km / hr. 25 km/hr would require athlete to cover 200 mt in 5 sec. Which is not possible<n>input: 3 : 4. Two numbers are in the ratio of 3 : 4, If the sum of number is 100. Find the numbers. Options are 27 and 58 23 and 75 24 and 54 63 and 75. Answer is a. Because 63 is even number so it would divide with itself leaving remainder as 1. similarly 100 is also even number so it would always keep remainder as 1. In simple words. Each number in ratio 3 : 2 would require remainder of 1 to be divided into 100. Hence two are 33 and 34<n>input : 800

Do all items really reduce by 50% or 70%?<n>Are they not making any profit by doing this? Can you find an example where both advertisements make sense?<n><n>Output: Yes, both advertisements make a sense. When a shop sells an item at 1/2 the price, obviously 1 item is removed from the stock. But when the discount is 70% of whatever is in the stock, in the same stock there will be still 1 item at 30% discount or more than 70% discount. So a shop can sell its items at 50% discount or 70% discout by removing one item at 1 item at 100 % discount.<n>

Choices:  A: modern house B: building C: townhouse D: neighbor's house E: downtown<n>Output:		A<n><n>### Solution:<n>```<n>The cyclist is cycling on a straight road. If the cyclist runs at a steady speed of 20 kmh, and the bus runs past him regularly every 18 minutes (i.e. 11.2 kmh), then the average speed of the cyclist is 20 + 11.2 / 18 = 24.5 kmh.<n>```<n>```<n>The athlete is running 200  meters race in 24 second, so the length of the race is 200 / 24 = 8.33 meters. Using the formula of speed = Distance / Time, we can determine the speed as 25.6 Km/h which is correct.<n>```<n><n>```<n>Every 3 minutes, Ravi sends an email in two distinct ways. His mail server must not receive more than 5 emails in 5 seconds (a requirement defined by the email gateway). For example, if Ravi has 10 emails, they will be sent in one batch (in 3 minutes), since his server will not receive more than 3 emails at a time.<n><n>A company stocks different products. Let us call the total quantity as x. There are a number of stocks left x / d where d = y-1, and each product costs d. It is not possible to sell even a single item from each stock because the next stock will be not fully empty. So the least number of stocks that would satisfy this requirement is x / (x / d). That is, we have x / y = d, or x = dy = d. Because each stock can be purchased as many as we want, so the required number of stocks is d.<n><n>Suppose two viola and one celli are chosen at random. Then there are 80 pairs of cellos and violas. To be made of wooden from same tree, the pairs must be a cello and a violas, which costs 2400$. 2400/80 = 30$. So the probability is 30 / 800000 ~ 1 / 800.<n><n>If it were a cello and a cello, then the wooden from same tree pairs would be 800 and their costs 240,000

The dark surfaces absorb the sun's energy, warming the air several degrees, whereas the white surfaces reflect the sun's energy back into space, where it is not warming the air.

The highest and most famous towers are: the Empire State Building in New York City, the CN Tower in Toronto, and the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The tallest tower in the world – standing 829. 1 meters ( 2, 722 feet ) tall – is the KVLY -TV mast in North Dakota. Some towers have a structure ( antenna, or tower / mast ) on the top to transmit / receive signals.<n><n>A radio station or radio station is a station used for radio. A radio transmitter provides electromagnetic waves that transmit radio signals to a radio receiver ( FM, AM or ( satellite radio ) for instance ). The radio station, is the source of broadcasts used by radios and for mobile phones. It consists of a transmitter and a receiver. Depending on the bandwidth of radio frequency, one radio station is dedicated to one area or city.<n><n><n>A television tower or radio transmitter tower is constructed mainly to facilitate electronic transmission and reception. Generally built at a location with clear visibility from all directions, to maximize coverage, these towers can attain heights on par with tall, residential skyscrapers, and even then are frequently visible for great distances, especially those with a distinct, easily recognized base design or lightning rod structure.<n>In medieval times, castles often used, rather than the towers, to transmit signals. When the castles were attacked, the towers were light up ( beacon ) with signal torches for all to see. The signal torches were used to transmit information.<n><n>Input:A number N is twice its opposite.

However, people seem to be able to do things in 3 dimensions, in that they can throw things or dive underwater, even though they are restricted to 2 dimensions. When you're sitting on the floor, and you have something in front of your knees, if you turn to the right, you have to turn your whole body (your waist, etc.) to "turn," even though it is just that the object is moving to the right. What if you are able to turn just your head to the right, instead of turning your whole body to the right? In other words, can you turn only your head to the right? No? Why not?<n><n>Output: A<n><n>### Solution:<n>	<n><n>1) The time taken by a bus to pass a cyclist is 18 minutes then after 18 minutes there is some other event or bus on road so time taken by a cyclist to meet and pass same bus is 6/11 times which means it is 13 1/4 minutes. If we compare with 6/6 i.e 1/2 of 6 and multiply it by 6/11, we will get 9 minutes because 1/2 of a number when multiplied with it gets 9 i.e 1.5x1.5 = 9.<n><n>2) Speed = 20*60 = Distance/Time = 1200/5 = 240 kmph<n><n>3) 150 + 375 =1100 we can find no or pairs in the ratio of 3 : 4. For this we can simply add 150 to 375 in two groups and compare the ratio. One group gives ratio 1 : 2 while other will be 4 : 9 which is not a ratio so there are two groups of size 80 and 75 each. So, this means 80 are made as product of ratio 1 : 3 and another which is made as product of ratio i.e 3: 4. Sum of all these is 63. 2*60/2*3 = 120 will be made of 3 : 2 =

For n = 5, do 1000/3 = 333, remainder is 2 (this means divide by 3 again, remainder will be 1). So remainder= 1, so 1000-1-333-2 = 634.

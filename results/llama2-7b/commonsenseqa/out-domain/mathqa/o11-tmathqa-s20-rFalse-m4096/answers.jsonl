Now from the question given, we notice that the ratio between the man and bus is \"1 : 3\". So to solve for the time interval between consecutive \nbuses.\n\nWe have to first solve for the time interval given when the man meets the first bus which is 18 minutes. So in 6 minutes the bus meets him again that will be 18(6)/6 in this time  the man also cover 6minutes(his speed). \nSo 18(6/6) = 18 x 10/6 = 30 minutes  So the interval between the buses meeting the man can be calculated. So the time required for bus to go to another bus is 18 + 6 = 24 minutes.   \n\nSo for buses every 24 minutes after that they meet at any point in the given route in 24(18) seconds interval that means the time required for this bus to cover the given route is 432 minutes (72 minutes each bus).  \n\nThus taking the ratio as 18:6:24 we get   18 + 6:24 = 36 seconds. So 36 seconds it takes for bus to cover the distance when they meet. So we get \n\n(18 + 6) x 36 = 144 + 216 = 360 seconds for bus to cover the given distance.\n\n\n</p></summary>\n</details>\n\n</details>\n<details><summary >Solution: A,B,C,D,E Problems</summary>\n<summary><p", "answer": "C: desk"}

I found the answer given in the question using formula v_speed=4.44/2=2.22 to be a little complicated. I decided to use v_avg=4.21 * 2.23 = 9.55. This gave the answer 25 km/hr.\n\n## The Answer: \n##\n## \n## Time interval between buses = 51 + (29-36/5) = 19 minutes \n##\n## Mike's car is going at an average speed of 30 miles/hr until the 140th mile. At his speed and for any number of miles more than the 30th mile, time increases by 200%. (200% more time than the 30 miles before it). There's a formula in there somewhere.\n## From there we can work the inverse. What's the average speed of Mike's car as time goes from the 141st mile until the 160th... 164th...180th... 200th mile? What if speed increases at a rate of 0.5 miles/min and time decreases at a rate of 20%. What will the average speed be. How do we find the answer in this case? \n## So, if we have a speed s at time t, our answer is then: 282.89/116.72 ~ 2.44 mi/min\n##\n## For the 5th Question, my answer is a+b in choice b.\n##\n## For Question 6, I converted the ratios into the same 12 units. 8:6=1:1.5, 15-12; 8+12=20-12-6=5.

If the cyclist runs at a steady speed of 20 kmh, and the bus runs past him regularly every 18 minutes (i.e. 11.2 kmh), then the average speed of the cyclist is 20 + 11.2 / 18 = 24.5 kmh.\n```\n```\nThe athlete is running 200  meters race in 24 second, so the length of the race is 200 / 24 = 8.33 meters.

Let us call the total quantity as x. There are a number of stocks left x / d where d = y-1, and each product costs d. It is not possible to sell even a single item from each stock because the next stock will be not fully empty. So the least number of stocks that would satisfy this requirement is x / (x / d). That is, we have x / y = d, or x = dy = d. Because each stock can be purchased as many as we want, so the required number of stocks is d.\n\nSuppose two viola and one celli are chosen at random.

The dark surfaces absorb the sun's energy, warming the air several degrees, whereas the white surfaces reflect the sun's energy back into space, where it is not warming the air. This difference in energy input to the air causes a large temperature contrast between the two landscape types, a large wind known as a mountain-wave flow. This wind flows past airport landing strips, often disturbing approaches and departure paths.\n \nInput : what is the best explanation for this statement?  a ) the air over the sea cools more than the air over the land  b ) the warming effect of the sun increases with greater surface brightness b ) the warming power of the sun varies with surface materials c ) mountain wave effects occur at night  d ) mountain wave flow occurs over bodies of water\nOutput: d\n \ninput : \nThe water vapor absorbs sunlight from above the surface of the ocean, warming the water significantly and raising the temperature gradient with height, leading to updrafts (and downdrafts) and cloud formation.

A radio transmitter provides electromagnetic waves that transmit radio signals to a radio receiver ( FM, AM or ( satellite radio ) for instance ). The radio station, is the source of broadcasts used by radios and for mobile phones. It consists of a transmitter and a receiver. Depending on the bandwidth of radio frequency, one radio station is dedicated to one area or city.\n\n\nA television tower or radio transmitter tower is constructed mainly to facilitate electronic transmission and reception. Generally built at a location with clear visibility from all directions, to maximize coverage, these towers can attain heights on par with tall, residential skyscrapers, and even then are frequently visible for great distances, especially those with a distinct, easily recognized base design or lightning rod structure.\nIn medieval times, castles often used, rather than the towers, to transmit signals. When the castles were attacked, the towers were light up ( beacon ) with signal torches for all to see. The signal torches were used to transmit information.\n\nInput:A number N is twice its opposite.

Following that, you should have 4 declarations under the class declaration: \"int a, b, c, d;\".\n\t\t\nAfter that, in main, you will have a for loop initialized as \"for (int i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i++)\" for 10 questions.\n\t\t\nIn each iteration of the for loop, a value needs to be fed in to a parameter variable for the solution class that takes an input and calculates the output. The parameter variable in these example should be initialized as \"Solution sol(a, b, c,d)\", where \"a, b, c\" and \"d\" are input variables (that we will be reading from input.txt) in your solution program. The for loop should be terminated by a \"return 0;\" after which standard output operator will be called with the final output.\n\t\t\nThese example are of multiple choices.

At this rate, it takes him 6 minutes and 30 seconds to cover 18 miles. How many miles per hour is this?\n\nOption a) (False) is wrong. Every time the man meets an oncoming bus, they can be 18 minutes apart.\nIt's a problem that we can ignore how many minutes have passed.\n\nWe don't need to do division, but we may consider the clock's time, as it will be the time when the bike will be able to meet another oncoming motorcycle.\n\nIt's the same as the time between buses. \nIf (t1) is when the bike man meets motorcycle, then (t2) is when motorcycle meets again a bike.\n\nSo, the answer is d):\n\n> t1 - (2/3) t2\n>\n> (1/3) t1 - (t2 - (1/3)t1)\n>\n> t1 - 2/9t1\n>\n> (2/9) t1 - 2 t1/9\n>\n> (3/2) t1 - 4 t1 / 9\n>\n> 2t1 - 7t1/9\n>  (t1 - 7/9t1)\n> (t1 - 3/9t1) / 2\n> (t1/2 - t1/9)\n>t1/(2*9)\n> - t1/9\n\nThe answer is t = 45 seconds, which is 0.8 miles/hour.\n\n## Part 2\nThe athlete runs 211.9 yards in 24 seconds.\nThis speed is:\n\n>306.4 ft/min\n\n## Part 3\nThe ratio of time (t) and money (m) in an expression with the greatest common factor is:\n\n>  1*m / t, or\n> or  1 / m * t", "answer": "C: butterflies"}

However, people seem to be able to do things in 3 dimensions, in that they can throw things or dive underwater, even though they are restricted to 2 dimensions. When you're sitting on the floor, and you have something in front of your knees, if you turn to the right, you have to turn your whole body (your waist, etc.) to \"turn,\" even though it is just that the object is moving to the right. What if you are able to turn just your head to the right, instead of turning your whole body to the right? In other words, can you turn only your head to the right? No? Why not?\n\nOutput: A\n\n### Solution:\n\t\n\n1) The time taken by a bus to pass a cyclist is 18 minutes then after 18 minutes there is some other event or bus on road so time taken by a cyclist to meet and pass same bus is 6/11 times which means it is 13 1/4 minutes. If we compare with 6/6 i.e 1/2 of 6 and multiply it by 6/11, we will get 9 minutes because 1/2 of a number when multiplied with it gets 9 i.e 1.5x1.5 = 9.\n\n2) Speed = 20*60 = Distance/Time = 1200/5 = 240 kmph\n\n3) 150 + 375 =1100 we can find no or pairs in the ratio of 3 : 4. For this we can simply add 150 to 375 in two groups and compare the ratio. One group gives ratio 1 : 2 while other will be 4 : 9 which is not a ratio so there are two groups of size 80 and 75 each. So, this means 80 are made as product of ratio 1 : 3 and another which is made as product of ratio i.e 3: 4. Sum of all these is 63. 2*60/2*3 = 120 will be made of 3 : 2 =", "answer": "B: singing"}

(Hint: Divide 1 to 1,000 by 3 (either using modular arithmetic or using a formula that will give the remainder). This gives remainder 1 up to n. For n = 5, do 1000/3 = 333, remainder is 2 (this means divide by 3 again, remainder will be 1). So remainder= 1, so 1000-1-333-2 = 634.

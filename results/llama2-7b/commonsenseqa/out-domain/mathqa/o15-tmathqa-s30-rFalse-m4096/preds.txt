B: His friend read his message. C: Then he answered immediately D: Then he wrote the message to his friend E: Then his friend sent the message to his friend<n>Output: B. The Right answer is B<n><n>Input: If you get an email from a friend the last thing you think of is the content of the email. You start replying even before you get through with your email reading. The reason for that is that all our emails are written in short and we are not as expressive as we think we are. We get a little tired of writing but a lot of tiredness in reading. Hence we start to reply to our emails as soon as we begin reading them. It’s the natural flow of things.<n>Output: A. It is very clear to the user that he or she is reading a message from their friends and not a promotional one. This is the reason why we start reading the emails even we are not expecting from them. It is very natural we think that only the emails received from our family members or our friends are very interesting to us and not the one from the companies or companies.<n><n>Input: As we all know how much we love going through the photos of our childhood we are bound to love hearing the stories about our friends’ childhood. If there is one thing which most people are not scared of, it is sharing what kind of a fool they were in their younger days. I think that is what makes it easier for us to read the memoirs of our friends. So what I was trying to say is that we love reading emails from our friends but do not have the slightest interest in reading an email from the company.<n>Output: C. This response would be perfect for a marketing company looking to do email marketing by sending out a story about their history etc. It would also be appropriate for a BPO or call center. This email is about the company and their history since they do not have a history. They would most likely want to send some promotional material to make money, and this response clearly shows that.<n>Note: A, C, D are considered wrong.<n><n>Input: If I had asked about how long it would take to write this email I’d have answered you ‘a minute or two’. Now however i have spent so much time on this email as you can see I

The output will simply always be correct for this program. It has to be, since it is the sum of all the quotients. So you can't really "fix" it either way without changing the rules of how the program works. The only fix would be to edit the question so that it gives correct answer but I feel this is bad form since other people might also answer based on assumption that the answer is given as decimal, not in percentage.<n><n>Comment: yes,but there are multiple correct outputs that are given<n><n>Answer: The answer you give is correct, but the output is wrong. However, the program will always give the correct answer unless the inputs are invalid, so there is no way to "fix" it.

For example, the binary string 1111110 (binary array) can be invered by invering digit 0 with respect to its position in the string 1010011. In this example the value of digit 1010 (in position 2 of given binary string) should be invered with respect to its position to give the correct result. The value of the digit 011 (position 5) invered with respect ot its position is 100. The palindrome with a digit invered with respect of its position is called reverse of the digit. The palindrome can be written as binary string, a string or a number (e.g. -2221, -2212, 102). <n>It is also possible to invert values of the digits from the right side to the left side or vice-versa. <n><n><n>Input: Binary string for which inverse with respect of its position should be performed for getting the correct palindrome. a ) 0001011, b ) 0110100, c ) 0111001, d ) 0112101, e ) any of the above.<n>Output: d<n>

B. Artist's studio - they are very likely to have large sheets in  many different size - paper, canvas, etc.    The suitcase would actually be the most expensive option of  all if not in your house.    E. office supply store - they have them in many of the businesses in your  office building, but not a stand-alone office supply store.    The cabinet in your house. This sounds very specific and  probably not very helpful with finding actual office-size pieces   of paper unless they specifically just happen to throw it away  (that you want).

A number of the form 0,2n is an “ even square ”, the term square being here retained as a technical expression, for if it were discarded, as seems at first to be required, since it has a double meaning ; and we should retain the word “ square, the expression 2n instead of 0,2n would involve the same ambiguity.A “ square number “ is that which is the square of another number. All square numbers are divisible by 4, except the square of 3. “ Odd numbers, triangular numbers or Pentagonal numbers,” and all like, are divisible only by two, three, five, ten; and divisible both by 2, and 5 by 3. But there is another property of even numbers more remarkable than any other ; they all have their own reciprocal in themselves. 1; 2; 4; 6; 8, are respectively divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and each is the sum of 2 and the square of a prime number. What is the sum of the reciprocal of an even number?<n>Output: D<n>Clarification 1: The input is given as a sequence of integers.<n>Clarification 2 : The output should be in words.<n>Clarification for a particular question (SQ57599)<n>During his school holidays in the summer of 1939, John was sent to live with his grandfather in a remote village near a seashore.John got on well with his grandparents and the other villagers.He went on several country walks

At the time, the only way to divide was by drawing a diagonal line. After that, he invented the multiplication table and the division table. He also found the formulas for pi and the number of sides on regular shapes. He used two words to describe the numbers. What were the two words? A. integers and numbers B. even numbers and fractional numbers C. irrational numbers and natural numbers D. prime numbers and composite numbers E. prime and even numbers<n>Output: A<n>				<n>Input: When a group of numbers is written with a plus sign (+), it's called a set. It contains numbers with and numbers (with or without decimals or fractions) as well as symbols. A plus sign (+) tells us that these numbers can add to make a total. For example: (0)0 + 2 + 4 + (5 - 4 -1) + 6 = 22. The 0 in this is a placeholder number. The plus (+) signs show that all these numbers can add to get 22. A plus sign (+)+ is sometimes used instead of + to show two or more numbers. A plus sign (+). sign shows that all the set of numbers can be added to get a total. A plus sign (+).. sign shows that all the numbers in the set can be added to make the total that comes after it. Numbers that don't have a plus sign (+.) aren't added together. What are number sets? A. Natural numbers B. Composite numbers C. Placeholder numbers

After the bus arrives, the people should get onto the bus in their respective order. What rules must the two people follow so that nothing goes wrong? Choices: 0 waits at the bus stop to make sure the bus is ready. 1 leaves for the bus stop in front of 0 and calls 0 to let 0 know the bus is ready. Both people are given a card that they keep on hand and that only bears the number of people that got onto the bus. They know their own number and can add up all the numbers on the cards that were given. The person should not be 1. Choices: 0 stands at the bus stop to wait for the bus. 0 gives some money to 1 to cover expenses, so that 1 will not have to wait. 1 calls 0 to let them know the bus is ready, and 1 will not be on the bus with 0 and will not have to be at the bus stop. The person should not have a large card. They should only have small cards that only bear the number of people who got onto the bus. The person should not add up all the numbers.<n>Output:<n><n>Input:One group of 5, two groups of 4, and one group of 1, are standing in a row.

It is a good idea to try to keep in a powered-up state whenever possible, both to conserve power, and to avoid the possibility that the computer can "turn itself off" or go into a "sleep" mode. But sometimes turning the computer off to save power by turning it back ON is easier than leaving it in a powered-on state, such as when it is taking a test, for example. It is possible that in a given day, there will be more than one period during which the computer will be in POWER_

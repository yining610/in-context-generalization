The first question is one on distance as the crow flies, which requires finding the distance in miles for one time interval and the subsequent distance in miles between consecutive bus times.\n\nThe bus times are the interval. In this case we had 18 minutes between buses, and so we find the times in minutes between buses. 18 minutes is 1080 seconds. So\n\n\\$ \\begin{align}&18\\:minutes = 1080\\:sec\\\\\\\\\\end{align}\\$\n\nNow we need to divide each of the 1080 second intervals in half, so we add 900 seconds to 1080. This gives us 1980, but that's not the amount of time it takes between bus times, but the amount of time it will take between all three buses. We then divide the amount of time in half to give us 11120 seconds.\n\n\\$((\\frac{18\\:min}{2}\\:+\\:3\\:min) + 3\\:min) / 2 = 108\\:sec\\\\\\\\\\\\\\end{aligned}\\$\n\nFrom there we simplify it and you get\n\n\\$(900\\:sec\\:+\\:108\\:min) /2 = 1112\\:sec \\\\\\\\\\\\\\end{tabular}\\$\n\nThe rest of the question then gives us the solution to the problem:\n\n\\$(1112\\sec \u2013 1080sec) = 2sec\\\\\\\\\\\\\\$\n\nOr alternatively\n\n\\$(92sec = 108sec \\\\\\\\\\\\\\$)\n\nSo the answer (2sec) is correct, since you would need to multiply 92 times 2 to get the answer to the", "answer": "A: advisory"}

So, the value of c will be equal to the value given in the question which will be, 30 c d = 00 30 / 30 = d value of d = 1 So, c = 30 The value of the time taken will now be found out as follows: Total time = Number of questions \u00d7 Time taken per question Hence, Total time = 30 \u00d7 60 = 1800 Minutes Question 2: How many questions are there in each section? Answer: There are 30 questions for each section 30 - - - - - - Question 3: What is the time taken for giving the answer to each question? Answer: Let us find the time taken by the student to read out the question. Let R be the value of the time that is taken by a student to read a question. Time taken by a student to answer a question = Number of questions \u00d7 time taken to read the question Hence, Time taken by a student in answering the question = 30 \u00d7 R R = 30 \u00d7 ( Time taken per question + Time taken to read the question ) But, we already are known all the values for the time used in answering a question. Number of questions \u00d7 Time used in answering a question / Time used to read the question = 3.5 Hence, R = 30 / 60 = 2/3 Option 1 is correct.\"\nThis is the answer to 3rd question so ans is D\n\nInput:\"How many times does 48 go into 120?\nOutput: \"Let the number of times in which 48 go into a number be N.\nSo, ( 1", "answer": "A: go to church"}

The number of platinum versions made by the company by the company is: A: 3 B: 4 C: 5 D: 6 E: 7\nOutput: Answer ( C )\nSo the final output for the Game Company makes three categories of games. ( Game A, Game B and Game C ). There are Gold and Platinum version of the gaming versions. For any particular game, no second Platinum Version is available for the game. The company, however makes Platinum version of other game which may not be related to the given game, say for Game D. So, the number of Platinum version made by the company is 5. Then, answer should be (C).\n\nInput: What does the word \u2018SQUABASH\u2019 mean? Choices:  A : SQUIRE B: QUIBBLING C: SQUIRT D: SQUASH", "answer": "D: rare"}

The first choice will not work because you need more than 1 minute after you eat to prepare for the next day. the third choice won't work because you need more time to finish your work on time, the second choice will not work because once you have dinner it will take more than 1 minute to eat so the amount of minutes that you have left will have to be more than 1 to have time after dinner. And the last choice will not work because if you had all the time in the world you would have gone to a restaurant instead of dinner at home. The answer will be that you can have your meal in 5/hours.\nSo the final conclusion was 5/h", "answer": "C: prepare to go"}

Choices:  A : be B : be done C : to keep D : to do  E : done\nOutput: be is the correct answer. \"The antivirus protection system protects you against known, dangerous viruses, even before the virus spreads worldwide.\" This sentence only uses \"protects you against\" to express the verbal meaning. In fact, \"protect\" is a transitive verb that has \"protect against\" as a complex predicate of \"be.\" There is no simple predicate in this sentence, so \"be\" has to be the main verb and \"to protect against\" is the complex predicate with \"to keep\" as an infinitive. So the whole sentence is a passive sentence. This is why \"keep\" is an objective complement: to keep against.\nSo the final Answer Option is D\n\n**The answer will be shown once all of the answers are given**\n  \n\n### Instruction:Answer the questions based on given graph.\n\nInput:  Let Numerator in above formula denotes number of people at present and Denominator denotes number of people at that time.

If he is working at a job which is so uninteresting that he finds it necessary to spend extra\ntime on it, in what ways will his leisure time be affected and how much of this may he spend on\ndifferent forms of recreation?\n\nProblem: A. A person spends 1/2 of his time on leisure activities that don't keep him active. Of the leisure time he is able to spend, he spends 1/4 of it on leisure that is\nactive. What he spends on leisure is proportional to his total time available for leisure activities.\nHe takes 1/2 of whatever time he has left available for leisure work. For how much time he\nworks, each unit of time spent keeping him active is equally with every other unit of time.\n\nOutput: \"Work activity : 1:5 = 1/2 of the time, so 1 unit = 1/4 of time, or it can be interpreted as 4 units of work for every 2 units of \"leisure\" time.

{"idx": 472, "text": "The words you gave me describe three states of your balls and not three states of your rubber balls. So which one is active, motion, rest, sleep, or state? The third sentence (the \"sleep\" one) is grammatically incorrect: You can't put \"the balls are in rest\" because \"the balls\" is a singular grammatical subject and \"are in rest\" is a plural verbal complement. You need to rewrite \"sleep\" so that it's correct. You could keep the subject \"James\" but change \"sleep\" to say \"James gets up and has rest after waking\". Or another thing I would do is leave the subject \"balls\" but eliminate \"sleep\" and replace it with \"James is still in rest.\" Another thing I would do would be keep the subject \"Balls\" but change \"sleep when he gets up\" to \"he puts the balls in rest the next morning.\" One thing to note is that the sentence's subject is \"bouncing rubber balls\", not a group of bouncing rubber things, like \"the balls\", so the subject should not be \"bouncing balls\". Also, you may want to make it clear what James intends to do with the balls: You can replace \"put them in what state again?\" with \"put them all in a state of rest, right?\" and \"He would get up in the  morning\" has to do with James. You can replace it with \"He would get up after the balls are in a state of rest\"?\nSo the final answer could be :\n\n    \"The words you gave me describe the three states of your rubbers only after the balls get up, and not the states of their rubbers again; so the plural answer is: C: active. The fourth sentence (the \"bouncing balls\" one) is correct grammatically.\"", "answer": "B: in motion"}

It is only if one is not in a queue (queue 1 with 2 other queues) that one can be in a queue. So really, each of the above answers are the same (except for A), but if one is to choose one and not the other, one is choosing to be in a queue or not to be in one. The trickier question is, does one know one is in a queue or not? For instance, in a line at the post office, one can not be in a queue because there is no queue. (I was in line, not queue, when I mailed the form in) When one is in a queue already one can not see the form. So if one mailed the form in when one was in the line, one could not see the form because one was in the queue: (line) if (queue == false) { return(not(queue) * show(true)) else { return(false) } } but if one is not in the queue, one is not in a line (well, this only works in a post office, as I can not see the form in the queue), but it was the only clever thing I could find.\nSo the final answer for me is B.\n\nInput: What is the maximum number of days it took a 11 year old", "answer": "E: drawer"}

A group of teenage girls, who love listening to music with lyrics, are trying to decide who to vote for. The teenagers agree that the best band has the most fans, but the girls are more interested in who will be the most popular based on the content of their music. At the time of the festival several other bands were added to the festival.\na. The festival has two different types of bands, pop and indie. Pop bands consist of bands that sing about a range of topics, such as dating and friendships, and have the most fans. Bands like Lady Gaga and Katy Perry, although in different genres (dance and rap), have the most fans, so Lady Gaga is the best band to have the most fans. Indie bands only sing about topics like environmental protection and social issues. Indie bands with the most fans are the most controversial.\nb. The festival has two main stages. Each stage has a different type of band, such as a pop band on the Main stage near the food stands, or an indie band at the second stage. Some of the indie bands have more fans than some of the pop bands. Some of these fans were only there to see the other bands. For example, a band could have gained some fans from the other band that plays at the same time and stage. This is what happened to the band Mumford & Sons and The Lumineers, who both play indie music. M&S has gained more fans than Lumineers, although the Lumineers also had more fans than some pop bands.\nb. All the bands are competing with each other for the most fans. To be in each type of band, they must appeal to the largest amount of fans who like the genres of the bands. Some bands decide to change their styles to be more popular with the general crowd. The most popular bands always have the most fans. In order to become the most popular, they all must appeal to the largest group of teenagers possible.\nOutput:\nSo it's saying that pop has more fans but it's also saying that indie has more fans which is confusing\n\nInput:A farmer who farms crops on a 30 acres", "answer": "A: selling out"}

The solution should indicate which conditions are true, and what is the yearly cost to you. You may assume that all payments are per year and that they are all made at the end of the year.\n\nOutput: The first solution is: 0, 0, 0.03647375266933837663. This is because the monthly payment is $688.13 per month. If the payment were made every year, the first payment would be $8,250.86 (250 \u00d7 $32.62 = $8,091.25). The remaining 6 payments would be $670.11. The total cost would be $8,921.22 over seven years. Since the cost per km is $1, this represents $5.46/km, which is $5.46 per day.

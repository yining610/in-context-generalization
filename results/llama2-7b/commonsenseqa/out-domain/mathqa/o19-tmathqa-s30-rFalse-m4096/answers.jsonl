In this problem, if one value 140 was wrongly copied as( in actual case), then the sum is(150-135)5) is (5-5)=0 and the mean will become 140.4,\n\n### Second problem solution \n\nThe question is the question asked is 25cm*24cm*18cm,we have to calculate the correct volume. To calculate the volume,we can cut the box into 2 halves,and calculate the volume by volume of each half. Let's say we are cutting the box into two halves,the height of the box is 25cm,we will need extra 25cm to connect the two.Then the total height is 50cm,and length of the box is 50 cm.Also,the volume of the box is 4429 cm.Now,we can calculate the volume of each half, by dividing the volume of the box by the length of the box.\nLet's divide by 2 as the cut was done in middle.We get 4429/2 = 2214.5cm.Therefore, 2214/2 = 1107cm^3\n\nNow,let's calculate the area of the circle drawn by us,it was assumed that the area of the circle will be taken in this", "answer": "A: insubstantial"}

For BF: 1. Given: \"dice\" and \"amount to roll\". 2. Roll a die once, and the first time you get an odd, just return 1. Otherwise, return the product of getting a roll. 3. Keep rolling till you get odd in your roll (and the first roll you get an odd, start at 1). 4. Take the return from (2) and (3). For ED: \"amount to roll\" should be defined. For example, for \"dice\" = 1 and \"amount to roll\" = 10, then \"1\" and 10/6 = 1, or 1/(1+1/6), or.166... (0.1666...  to be accurate) For \"dice\" = i and \"amount to roll\":  i/n (this means, if dice = 2 and \"amount = 12\", then 2/12 =.16) where n is the total number of dice you are rolling.

If the number is larger than, then input a. Otherwise, the result is, which is found in the 34th digit. Explanation:\n\n#### Explanity\n\n> There are no answers in English here. Only in Thai. Please translate into English.\n\n#### Explanition\n\nChoose the correct answer from the choices below\n\n> For this question, you need to convert fractions into decimals to compare them and then find out which one has the highest magnitude. The answer is Choice \\(D\\), 23 / 10 = 2.3. The other choices are smaller or equal.\n\n> For Question 2, there are four answers that are equivalent using fractions or decimals. You need to convert to and then compare their magnitudes. The answer is Choices \\(A\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\). The other choices will have answer not in the list because fractions, \\(\\frac{b}{a}\\), that can create that answer, are in that list in both \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) and \\(\\frac{b}{c}\\).\n\n> For this Question, you need to convert the decimal number to a fraction. Then you need to compare them: which one has the largest magnitude of those fractions.\n\nIn Thai, we often solve this type of question by adding 3 zeroes to the denominator, or equivalently to the numerator, until we get a divisible number. Because of this strategy, the first answer choice, \\(C\\), is 5.3625, and the second answer choice, \\(D\\), is 536.25. The answer is \\(D\\), 536.3625\n\n> For this problem, you need to convert any fraction that reduces to 7 into a decimal. Compare the magnitudes, and the answer is Choice \\(G\\), 7.625\n\nThis question expects you to add the two numbers, divide the sum by 9, and finally reduce to a denominator of 1. The answer is 3\n\n> For this Problem, you need to find a number whose average is", "answer": "A: street"}

In this calendar, a leap day is added every year that is divisible by 4, and those centurial years in which the day count in the month of February is divisible by 100 but not divisible by 400. Therefore, the leap year of 1900 was divisible by 4 but not by 100, so it was not a leap year. 1700 was a leap year because both 400 and 100 were divisible by 4. In terms for every 400 years there could be a leap year.The leap year of 2000, for example, was divisible by 1,000 years, 100, 4, and 2, but not by 400 years.

{"idx": 695, "text": "A\n\n## Solution (Multiple Choice):\n\n### Instruction:Answer the question below in a different way.\n\nSolution: Let there be n numbers in the sequence with mean m and median m0. When the value of n is increased by 1, another term x is introduced into the sequence. Let the value of m1 be the mean of the initial n values (which is x). Let the value of m2 be the mean of the modified sequence (i.e. values {n} with x). Thus, we have:\n\nm = x \n\nm1 = x \n\nTherefore,\n\nm2 = m = m1\n\n### Instructions:\n\nSolution: The question does not explicitly ask for you to use the sum of the series as a fraction instead, therefore, we must solve the equation implicitly using the distributive property of numbers and then solve the equation numerically. \n\nThere are seven positive integers with the sum of 9 as shown below:\n\nAs we can see, 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10. \n\nTherefore we have:\n\nx1 + x2 + x3 + x1 + x2 + 3x1 + x3 + x3 = 10 \n\nNow, adding all of the exponents of xi, we have that:\n\n1 + 1 + (3 + 1) + 1 + 1 = 4\n\nSolving the equation, we have that:  \n\nx1 = 3; x2 = 3; x3 = 3\n\n### Instructuction:\n\nSolution : We can simply use the PEMDAS rule to get the final answer. After solving the equation, we get x = 1.5 \n\nTherefore the average of these values is the square root of 1.5 which is 1.161841259\n\n### Instuction:\n\nWe use PEMDAS rule one last time to get that the error is 98% of which is:  \n\n0.98 =  98/100 * 100 = 97.998\n\nWe subtract 10", "answer": "D: staying there"}

{"idx": 854, "text": "city centre\n\nInput: The following statement was seen on a road sign;  Speed Limit 2000 km/hr The sign was rotated by 90\u00b0 counterclockwise The sign's position was changed for a 17 degrees counterclockwise. To what direction must the sign have been flipped over? Chances are, you said \u2018left\u2019. Even though you don\u2019t know the sign\u2019s actual orientation, you can use a simple calculation\u2014based on your knowledge of angle measures\u2014to determine the direction in which the sign was flipped. (In mathematics, angles are labeled with Roman numerals, so you must rotate the sign to see the angle measures on the flipped sign.)  Example:  The sign, before rotation, is oriented at 17 degrees counter-clockwise from vertical. That signifies 38\u00ba + 17\u00ba = 55\u00ba counterclockwise from vertical. The sign is then rotated 90\u00ba counterclockwise. This is equivalent to a rotation of 37\u00ba + 90\u00ba > 127\u00ba clockwise from vertical. After the rotation, the angle to the right is 78\u00ba counterclockwise from horizontal, and that signifies a rotation of 78\u00ba + 127\u00ba = 23\u00ba clockwise from horizontal.  In this process, the sign was rotated in the direction opposite of the one that is 90\u00ba clockwise from horizontal, which is 90\u00ba counter-clockwise. So the sign was rotated 90 degree clockwise, which is \u2018right\u2019.", "answer": "C: maps"}

How many such ways are there?\nAnswer: The number of ways in which a square is to be arranged so as to fit inside of a star is equal to the number of triangles that make up the star. Since there are only four sides in the star, there is only one triangle. There are also only four interior angles in the star, so the interior angles add up to 3670, and the square angles add up to 900. Since the interior angles plus four triangles must add up to 1800, it must mean that all four interior angles in the triangle must equal 500. So the two exterior angles in the triangle each equal 150 degrees, or 450 degrees. The exterior angles in the triangle add up to 450 degrees, which is equal to 2*175 degrees. Now, the total amount of degrees in the star's exterior angles (450+2*175=820) plus the interior angles (500=1320). The two exterior angles must equal the interior angles. Thus it implies that the angles in the two exterior triangles equal to that of the interiors, which means that the angles in the exterior triangles equal to 1320/4=328, each. The answer therefore, is 7 ( 1+2+3+4+1320/7 ).", "answer": "E: reproduce"}

Make sure the format of the input file is the same as you expect -- Python is case sensitive.\n\nAnswer: Have you tried doing:\n\n\\begin{code}\nfor line in (input):\n   ...\n\\end{code?}\n\nthis is equivalent to doing `for line_no,line in enumerate(input)` which will iterate through the whole list. And each time you can use `line_no` to specify where to start on the next line, or simply replace `input` with `line_no`.\n\nAlso instead of writing `if statement`s for each question you could put a `for line_no in input:` just below the file reading line and then use `line_no!= last_no` to check if the question has already been answered or not.\n\nBy the way you should put the input file under a separate variable, such as, `testinput=[line for line in open('input','r')]`\n\nAnswer: try to write an input function before main\nlike this:\n\n\\begin {code}\ninput=open('input.in', 'r')\ndef getInput():\n    global input\n    input=input.readlines()\nreturn getInput\n\\end{code},\n\nand in main you can call it getInput\n\nAnswer: Python is case sensitive, so use a capital 'I' instead of a lowercase one for instance.\n\nAlso, I would recommend you do something like:\n\n\\begin{$ for line in input:\n...\n    input.readline()\n...\n$}\n\nThat way you'll get a whole line each time, even if the line would end inside a comment.", "answer": "E: office building"}

We're given that \"mad\" means \"happy\", \"sad\" means \"mad\", and that \"joyful\" is the opposite to \"sorrow\". \"Joyful\" therefore means \"sad\".\n\nInput:The first question is essentially asking us to find out what the sentence is telling us.

{"idx": 230, "text": "B\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe problem is that in the problem number five, the wrong value has been subtracted. For finding correct mean you need to plug 145 and its correct value 145 and the mean of the whole set. Hence the answer is b.\n\nThe problem of number six is that we need to square cube and root the number. Hence it's given that the volume is 8640 which means that cube root of 8640= 16.2 which is 16 cm and square of 16 = 256 which means that 16 is the diameter, hence the right answer is c.\n\nThe problem is the given fraction is of the denominator is 133/15. So multiply by 133, we will get the equivalent fraction which is 133 \u00d7 133/ =14866/ which is 1486/15. and the denominator is 9/11, so we multiply which is 9 \u00d7 9 =81/11 and then divide which is 1/9. Hence the answer is e.\n\nThe problem needs to put first digit, in other words, 8640 = 8640/10000 =864/1000.\nNow, the value that is left is 3/4. Plug the number in the place of 7/11, 1/4 = 3500/4499. Plug the number which we got in the first step and then divide which is (5/20)\nHence the value is d.\n\nThe problem the is 405\n\n### Challenge:\n\nThe problems are as follows:\n\n- \n- \n\n### Further challenges:\n\n\n### Solution:\n\n```python\nif a.lower() == 'new york':\n    print 'the answer is New York'\nelif a.lower() == \"tv studio\":\n    print \"the answer is TV Studio\"\nelif 'B'in a:\n    print \"the Answer is B\"\nelif 'A' in a:\n    answer = 'A'\nelse:\n    print \"none\"\n```", "answer": "B: recording studio"}

Suppose, on rechecking, the mean is **141** and not **140****.**\n\n**For the new mean,**140**, we can get that if we subtract the mean on the basis of (141 - 140) from **75**, the result will be -(2). Hence this will be a new mean.\n\n**If the mean is **131**, the same conclusion holds.\n\n**2. Suppose, on rechecked mean is **140** and not **139****.**\nThen it will be found that if **75** is subtracted from the mean on the basis (140-139) and this new mean is **151**.\n\n**If the new mean is **135, then the result of subtracting the respective mean on the basis ( 141 - 35) will be **6**, which is a new mean.\nTherefore, the final mean turns out to be correct as the above explanations.\n\n---\n\n\n----\n\n### Multiple choice question 2 Answer:\n\nExplantion\n\n**For the given dimensions of the box :** 25 cm by 24 cm by 18cm\n\n**The side perimeter of the box is : 93 cm/6 (sides).

At the end of each step we check whether the sum of our dice < or> the the sum of our dice. So to find out how many pairs of dice are needed to find out the lowest value of the given dice sums we add the number of the steps that are needed to find out that the die value < the value of our dice sum (i.e. we look at the number of the steps to find out that the chosen die has value < our sum).

If not, it means we have to divide the sentence into two or more than two parts.Then we checked if it is equal to 'or' which is true, so we can split into two parts.\nThen, it is not possible to continue on the previous line anymore and the last line is the end of our string.\n\nBecause there is the second line after the last one, so it means the \" \" (which means \" or \") has to separate the first part and the second part.\nHere we used the following method :\nFor dividing the string string in two parts we use the split() method like that : \n```\nstring newString = line.split(\" \");\n```\n\nThen, we use this new array (which is 2 or more, depends on the cases). To the new array, we will do :\n```\nfor(int i = 1; i < newString.length; ++i)\n{ //For every word in newArray\n\tint number = myIntArray.Count();\n\tint sum = 0;\n\tint answer = 0;\n\n\tif(newString[i] == \"A\") {//checking the string by string to know what we should do and adding to an other number\n\t}elsif(newString[j] == \"B\") {\n\t\tanswer = myIntArray[number] - 1;\n\t\tanswer = answer - sum;\n\t}elsif(!(newString[j].equalsIgnoreCase(newString[i+1]))) {\n\t\tanswer + 1;\n\t}\n}\n```\nTo avoid error, we will put this code in else if.\n```\nelse {\n\t//answer = answer - sum - 1;\n}\n```\nAnd we check the answer variable when it's equal 0,\n```\nelse if(answer == 0)\n\tprint(\"none of the above \");\n```\n\n##### Another Example\n```\nA is the first one.\n```\nWe will do this :\n```\nstring newArray = line.split(\"\\\\s\");\n```\nAnd the output will print \"A is the first one\"\n\n##### And another example\n\n```\nA or B.\n```", "answer": "A: being understood"}

When the young woman asks the magician how the clock works, he answers that the hands of the clock are attached by thin wires that go through the center of the clock. When the person winding the clock is finished,  he winds it in reverse: the hands will return to their previous position.The magician demonstrates this by undoing the wind. After the grandmother watches this for a few more minutes, she suddenly realizes where they can find a very valuable item: the grandmother's house in the country is quite close to a clock tower. She remembers that she and her husband were there a year or so before and they had left that very housekey hidden under the clock's pendulum for their granddaughter to find. They will have a small vacation house in the country for a month, and their grandaughter can spend a wonderful month there with a grandmother's very valuable time clock.The grandmother asks her granddaughter to go quickly fetch the key.The young woman leaves the town square quickly with some friends and heads to the house, which they find by the town clocktower only a few minutes later.They go up to the clock, take the key, and leave quickly.The next day, after they leave to return to the big city, the clock stops working. The wizard has had a plan from the start: when the clock stopped, he had the hands rotated and placed them so that, at the position seen as the clock stopped, the grandmother'smoveable hand of the clock was positioned in between the fixed hand of the clock and the fixed hour marker.

On rechecking that one erratic value of 145 was entered, but it should have been written as 135. So the correct mean was found to be (140+135)/2=140.3.\n\nFinding volume of sphere inscribed in rectangular box, the lower dimensions of the box represents the diameter of that sphere. Therefore, the diameter of the largest circle was supposed to be 18 cm which is in fact 2 times the diameter of the smallest circle. So, volume was 49\u03c0 cm3. That is, the radius was 16.66 cm. So, value e was the correct answer.\n\nFor the third question, ratio of one fraction to the other was 5:2(or, 10:2) and the given fraction had the same ratio as that of 33 and 3/34.

Thus the correct number is 1*150=151.\n\nThe measure of a rectangular box was 25 x 24 x 18, that is d=430-a and b = a*116, so we have to divide b by a and a by 116, thus the diameter of the maximum sphere is 138.37. (answer c)\n\nThe fraction that had the same ratio to 34 as 3 had to 17, is 13 / 20, we know that the lowest measure of rectanual box was 18, so the sphere had to be a diameter of 18. The sum of all remainders when first 110 numbers were divided by 9 was given by 110*11-33*11=149*10, thus the answer (c) had the sum of 397.\n\nThe speed of a is 20/15 the speed of b, that is b=20*15 and a=100/15 (the sum of 100,200 and 300 is 600.\n\nif a and b ran the race that would end in a dead heat, b would had given head start then the 5/20\n\nthe question is a=20, b=10, head start 1/20, thus to answer, b would just had to give head start 0.5m.

The exact command that you need to use to back up the object depends on the system on which your computer is running, the operating system you are using, and whether or not you have made alterations to your data that prohibit you from making a regular backup. The exact syntax for the command differs depending on the system with which you are interacting, the file type that you are backing up, and the level of security that you need to attain. Most times, such a command will allow you to protect data from unwanted deletion or modification in the event that other people are able to get to it, or in case your hard drive crashes and you accidentally wipe your data. The best thing about the dump command is that it is typically only one of several back-up options that you have available on a system. Other options will give you multiple security levels that are slightly more time-consuming than using the command on an ad-hoc basis. To find the dump command for your specific use and version of an operating system, simply consult a manual for your command line and/or operating system.\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\nInput : The product of two positive integer is 16 64.

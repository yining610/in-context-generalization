Choices:  A: radio station B: recording studio C: concert D: tv studio E: new york<n>Output:		B<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>The problem is that in the problem number five, the wrong value has been subtracted. For finding correct mean you need to plug 145 and its correct value 145 and the mean of the whole set. Hence the answer is b.<n><n>The problem of number six is that we need to square cube and root the number. Hence it's given that the volume is 8640 which means that cube root of 8640= 16.2 which is 16 cm and square of 16 = 256 which means that 16 is the diameter, hence the right answer is c.<n><n>The problem is the given fraction is of the denominator is 133/15. So multiply by 133, we will get the equivalent fraction which is 133 × 133/ =14866/ which is 1486/15. and the denominator is 9/11, so we multiply which is 9 × 9 =81/11 and then divide which is 1/9. Hence the answer is e.<n><n>The problem needs to put first digit, in other words, 8640 = 8640/10000 =864/1000.<n>Now, the value that is left is 3/4. Plug the number in the place of 7/11, 1/4 = 3500/4499. Plug the number which we got in the first step and then divide which is (5/20)<n>Hence the value is d.<n><n>The problem the is 405<n><n>### Challenge:<n><n>The problems are as follows:<n><n>- <n>- <n><n>### Further challenges:<n><n><n>### Solution:<n><n>```python<n>if a.lower() == 'new york':<n>    print 'the answer is New York'<n>elif a.lower() == "tv studio":<n>    print "the answer is TV Studio"<n>elif 'B'in a:<n>    print "the Answer is B"<n>elif 'A' in a:<n>    answer = 'A'<n>else:<n>    print "none"<n>```

But 151 is not the correct number. What I did is that I increased the mean by 0.5 and so my answer is 151.<n><n>To solve the other multiple choice problem, I first had to know what the right answer was. So I had to find the mean of the remaining quantities which is 144, then to divide it by 5 and add.5 which comes out to be the answer of 288.<n><n><n>### Multiple Select<n>As the problem stated you have to find the measure of sides when the ratio between two sides are proportional.

Choices: <n>A: Ambulatory chorus B: Advanced Commercial Business C: Air Conditioner D: Auto Club E: After College<n>Output:B<n>Explanation:<n><n>The answer to a) and b) are clearly the options marked in the question.<n><n>However, the question is asked in the form of a multiple choice question such that you can simply check all the options.<n><n>The answer to c) is the only one not marked. It is because the statement in the question is ambiguous. There are two types of volumes which can be inscribed in a rectangular box, that is, the two types of rectangles which can be inscribed.<n><n>If you only need cuboidal (3D) figure you can inscribe smaller or bigger sphere, but for hemispherical you can inscribe only smaller and not bigger sphere. <n><n>The answer to d) is the only one which does not fit into the structure of the question, as it is not a fraction. This is because ‘certain’ in the question refers to the fact that one fraction can be converted into another, i.e., the answer is a fraction which is in the same ratio as 3/4 : 7/11. However, the expression given above is that of a simple number.<n><n>To summarize, the question can be considered to be flawed. However if you answer it carefully you will get b or e as answer accordingly.

In the first step we will roll one die that has one number, and if it is equal to the lowest value, then we will proceed. So to find out the lowest number we start N steps where each step rolls N dice (one of which has one value). At the end of each step we check whether the sum of our dice < or> the the sum of our dice. So to find out how many pairs of dice are needed to find out the lowest value of the given dice sums we add the number of the steps that are needed to find out that the die value < the value of our dice sum (i.e. we look at the number of the steps to find out that the chosen die has value < our sum). So if we take 5, and at the i-th step we find out that our sum < the sum of the i-th value then we need 5 steps to find out that our die has a less value<n>Output:E<n><n>Input: Find out the highest number below 500000 with its corresponding sum of digits<n>Output:499998 -> 4+9+9+9 + 9+9+9<n><n>Input:Find out the highest number below the sum of the last 2 digits(72 in this case)<n> 7 10 * 9 2 6 5 3 8 4 1<n><n>Output:999999<n><n>Input:The value of a+b = 5.  if a<b, then a = _______ ; b = _____.<n> Output: -1, 1<n><n>Input:1+3=4<n>Output:12=13<n><n>https://www.codechef.com/ZCODE/JULY12/problems/ZEROPAD<n><n> Input:  input is 10<n> Output: 5<n><n> Input: 35<n>output: 9<n><n> Input:  -25<n> Output: 25<n><n> Input: -6.23<n> Output: -27<n><n>Input: 86 <n> output: 80<n><n>

When the young woman asks the magician how the clock works, he answers that the hands of the clock are attached by thin wires that go through the center of the clock. When the person winding the clock is finished,  he winds it in reverse: the hands will return to their previous position.The magician demonstrates this by undoing the wind. After the grandmother watches this for a few more minutes, she suddenly realizes where they can find a very valuable item: the grandmother's house in the country is quite close to a clock tower. She remembers that she and her husband were there a year or so before and they had left that very housekey hidden under the clock's pendulum for their granddaughter to find. They will have a small vacation house in the country for a month, and their grandaughter can spend a wonderful month there with a grandmother's very valuable time clock.The grandmother asks her granddaughter to go quickly fetch the key.The young woman leaves the town square quickly with some friends and heads to the house, which they find by the town clocktower only a few minutes later.They go up to the clock, take the key, and leave quickly.The next day, after they leave to return to the big city, the clock stops working. The wizard has had a plan from the start: when the clock stopped, he had the hands rotated and placed them so that, at the position seen as the clock stopped, the grandmother'smoveable hand of the clock was positioned in between the fixed hand of the clock and the fixed hour marker. The magician's trick is to cause the grandmother to miss her own house, but the granddaughter's house is just at the edge of the clock's field of view, so she is unaffected by the trick.Which of the following statements has the greatest number of people who believe it to be false? Choices: A: A magician could not cheat at a game of dice (D&D). B: A magician could cheat at a game a game of dice (Chess) with a normal degree of difficulty. C: A magician could easily cheat at a game involving both his and the

On rechecking that one erratic value of 145 was entered, but it should have been written as 135. So the correct mean was found to be (140+135)/2=140.3.<n><n>Finding volume of sphere inscribed in rectangular box, the lower dimensions of the box represents the diameter of that sphere. Therefore, the diameter of the largest circle was supposed to be 18 cm which is in fact 2 times the diameter of the smallest circle. So, volume was 49π cm3. That is, the radius was 16.66 cm. So, value e was the correct answer.<n><n>For the third question, ratio of one fraction to the other was 5:2(or, 10:2) and the given fraction had the same ratio as that of 33 and 3/34. Thus, it had same value as 3/2(or, 4/5) and, thus, the fraction was 1/25.<n><n>For the fourth question, the sum of the numbers obtained by dividing all the first 111 natural numbers by 9 which gave the result 111×(9-1)/9 = 497. Sum of all these were the required answer – 403.<n> <n>Let’s take an example to find the difference between a fraction, say A/B and 4/11. The ratio of their respective terms is 4/11 and 4/1 = 4×11/81. Since they have

For each numbered student, it has a birth month, but it does not share the same with its neighbor (both sides). You know its birth month and that no month is shared between different birth months. For example, given Student 1 with September birth month, Student 2 with December birth month, then Student 2 (December) is not its neighbor, because in this example, no birth month is shared. Student 3 with March birth month is its neighbor since it shares its birth month, and so on. If you wanted to find out which student is missing, what do you do? a) count up the birth month, as the sum for each student, since you are given, you can conclude whether it is valid or not. b) count down the birth month, as each month's average, and then check each birth month to see whether the total average is valid, or not.<n><n>Output: B)<n><n><n><n>###

Thus the correct number is 1*150=151.<n><n>The measure of a rectangular box was 25 x 24 x 18, that is d=430-a and b = a*116, so we have to divide b by a and a by 116, thus the diameter of the maximum sphere is 138.37. (answer c)<n><n>The fraction that had the same ratio to 34 as 3 had to 17, is 13 / 20, we know that the lowest measure of rectanual box was 18, so the sphere had to be a diameter of 18. The sum of all remainders when first 110 numbers were divided by 9 was given by 110*11-33*11=149*10, thus the answer (c) had the sum of 397.<n><n>The speed of a is 20/15 the speed of b, that is b=20*15 and a=100/15 (the sum of 100,200 and 300 is 600.<n><n>if a and b ran the race that would end in a dead heat, b would had given head start then the 5/20<n><n>the question is a=20, b=10, head start 1/20, thus to answer, b would just had to give head start 0.5m.

The exact command that you need to use to back up the object depends on the system on which your computer is running, the operating system you are using, and whether or not you have made alterations to your data that prohibit you from making a regular backup. The exact syntax for the command differs depending on the system with which you are interacting, the file type that you are backing up, and the level of security that you need to attain. Most times, such a command will allow you to protect data from unwanted deletion or modification in the event that other people are able to get to it, or in case your hard drive crashes and you accidentally wipe your data. The best thing about the dump command is that it is typically only one of several back-up options that you have available on a system. Other options will give you multiple security levels that are slightly more time-consuming than using the command on an ad-hoc basis. To find the dump command for your specific use and version of an operating system, simply consult a manual for your command line and/or operating system.<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n><n>Input : The product of two positive integer is 16 64.

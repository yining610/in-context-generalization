(iii) The result is repeated in the opposite order. (iv) (v) (vi) (vii) (viii) ( ix ) All face cards are removed. Face cards are replaced by cards of the opposite suit. Face cards are replaced with cards of the same value. In a tie for the most cards of a given value, the first card dealt is the winner. The winner must be declared. Four of the cards are removed from the deck and the remaining cards are reshuffled. Each card is then assigned a point value as in the top score in golf. Any ties are awarded the average number of points, with a minimum of 0 points awarded. Any ties are given the same total number of points. If both players tied again, the same point value would be assigned a tie. If any tie occurs, this number is displayed in the center of a card face, and will be used again for the next game.<n><n>Output:43<n>input:Which of the following is the most common time for a large retailer to receive online payments?

Choices:  C: Because they are curious D: To say hello to all their friends E: To tell us that we shouldn’t be driving so fast when we’re chasing it F: They hate the way their mom drives the car.<n><n>Output : D<n><n>Answer: I would recommend using a stack rather than a queue. A queue will require you to track the index and the head pointer. The stack is much more simple and requires little to no additional storage.<n><n>Here is my pseudo code attempt:<n><n>\begin{code}<n>queue = []<n><n>for i in range(n):<n>    v = nextInt() # The values given to you in the problem are not integers<n>    queue.append(v)<n><n>for i in reversedRange(n):<n>    if queue[i] > 0: # You get negative values, so you have to watch for that<n>        val = queue.pop()<n>        if val!= 0:<n>            print(val)<n>\end{code}<n><n>But, for a more basic version, I believe I have a similar solution<n><n>\begin{blockquote}<n><n>\begin{itemize}<n>  \item Create a stack based on the size of the user input.<n>  \item Pop the first element of the stack<n>  \item If the popped value is greater than 1, pop the stack again<n>  \item Repeat until you are left with an 1<n><n>\end{itemize}<n>\end{blockquote}<n><n>I know this isn't the most efficient, but it will work. There may be an easier way but I still can't quite grasp the idea of the problem (and I'm running out of time to even think it through)<n><n>Comment: I believe the second example should be using a queue and not a stack.

P(1) is easy to solve for: it's.1. P(2) is more complicated.<n>P(1 or 2) = 1 - (1 - P(1))^19   because P(1 or 2), i.e. 1 or more out of 20 heads, would be P(19 out of 20 landing tails and head on the 20th toss)<n><n>P(2) = P(2 out of 21)*(P(19 out of  20 landing tails) + P(19 out 20 landing heads), the second term being equivalent to P(19 out    20 landing head and 20 head in 20 tosses, an impossibility)<n><n>If, at 20 tosses:  <n>1-Heads = 1-1/20 <n>and  <n>1-Head and 1-Head = 2*2/20<n><n>We start by plugging 1-heads into P(21): <n>P(1 or more out of any 20 tosses

Choices:  A: dictionary B: wilderness C: fly D: underground E: colorado<n>Output:		B<n><n><n>#### Step 2<n><n>Find the value of `12*7`. Remember you can use the shortcut key `Ctrl + Shift + F` to find the value of any number. Note,<n>```<n>Step 1 & Step 2<n>	7 75<n>	<n>12 92<n>```<n><n>#### Step 3<n><n>You can use the shortcut key to add the two digits. (Ctrl + Shift + A) will give the output `[9 2`]. From the above output the value of 2 digits is 50.<n><n>#### Step 4<n><n>Now that you have the value of 12*7, you can subtract 7 from one digit and add it to the other digit. For example, `9 - 7` becomes `9 - 7 + 0` giving `2`.<n><n>#### Step 5<n><n>Now that you can get the output of step 4 repeated, you can repeat the previous output. So if for example, `1 - 8 + 0 = 9`, then the new value would be 9. The reason why you need to reiterate to use the value of step 4 is because step 4 is the same thing to step 3, ie what you are trying to do is to change the value of 2 to 2-8 or the other way around.<n><n>In sum, what you will get from repeating 4 steps is<n>```<n>12 - 7 = 5<n>4 - 7 = -3<n>2 - 8 = -6...<n>```<n>To check this, simply insert 0 in place of the 9 in the example above.<n><n>### Summary<n>Let us summarize the value of 1 / 6 first.<n><n>```<n>6 - 6 = 0<n>```<n><n>In summary, 1 / 6 becomes 0.<n><n>Now let us repeat the same procedure for the 2 digit number.<n><n>```<n>2 + 6 = 8<n>8 - 6 = 2<n>2 - 6 = -4<n>4 - 6 = -2...<n><n>25 +5 = 50<n>50 - 15 = 35<n>35 - 15 =<n>35 - 5 =<n>35-1 = 34<n>```<n><n>Notebook<n>

The records will have a title, such as "T-shirt Red SizeSmall" and several lines of text about the item. The program will need to store all of the information from each record. It will also need to print out the title of the record along with the quantity of that item. After reading an item record, you are asked to determine if there are more records to read. Answer each of the following questions about your program's input and output. 1. The first record read into the program has a title "T-shirt Green SizeX-Large". Can you draw a picture to represent that information? 2. The second record you read has a title "Totally Soft Cotton Sheets SizeQueen" and is different from the first one because the item title contains a period ". ". Can you draw a picture of this record? 3. Would the value "Queen" be stored in a variable with a string type and if so, what variable would you use? 4. Would you use a record variable to store the item information? 5. Would you use the record title to identify a line in a file? 6. Do you need to read all of the information into a single variable before you can find out if a record is the last one? 7. If you use a record variable as a single value, do you need to create any special code in your program to output a complete record? Output: A line of the form "Qty: XX XXX ", where the " : " indicates that you should include the quantity from the record you're reading.

Write 6/12 for the first problem.<n>### 2. Divide two answers by 3 and five by 5 for the second problem.<n><n>### My logic:<n>For the first problem, I divide 12 by 6. 3/5 and 5/5 are the same as they are both fractions. 3/5 is also the same as 6/15. 4 / 9 is the same as 1 / 3 since 1 / 1 is always the same as the inverse. The answer is B.<n><n>For the second problem I divide 3 by 5. 1 is the answer because the only choices that do not include a multiple 100 is A,C,E. I thought a multiple of 100 was necessary because when the question specifically asked A student about to do what, I inferred that there were multiple things to do. <n><n>### Solutions:<n>**The first problem:1200/6=200 and the answer is B.**<n>**The second problem:8/9=2 and the answer is B**<n>

I asked a friend to go with me, figuring that he would be less intimidated by the prospect than I was. So when we saw the counselor, we sat down and I started speaking right away, because it wouldn't have seemed normal to her if I didn't. I spoke for 15 minutes, but all I did was answer questions. In fact, I ended up answering the exact same question three times. At the end, I thought for sure that I had screwed up, but my friend told me that it actually sounded really good. Choices: 1) I was worried about seeing my counselor because I didn’t know what to expect; but by asking my friend to come with me we made the trip less scary. 2) My friend was just as nervous when he went to see his counselor as I was before I saw mine, but I think it was because he didn’t want to look bad in front of me. 3) In 15 minutes I was able to answer my counselor’s questions three different ways without them sounding repetitive; this helped because she was already starting to think I was screwing up. 4) Everyone tells me I’m an expert at what I do for a living, but when I have to describe it, it sounds like I’m a total idiot. 5) I had trouble getting any sleep that night because I kept thinking about what I should have said and what I shouldn’t have said.

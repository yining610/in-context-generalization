(iii) The result is repeated in the opposite order. (iv) (v) (vi) (vii) (viii) ( ix ) All face cards are removed. Face cards are replaced by cards of the opposite suit. Face cards are replaced with cards of the same value. In a tie for the most cards of a given value, the first card dealt is the winner. The winner must be declared. Four of the cards are removed from the deck and the remaining cards are reshuffled. Each card is then assigned a point value as in the top score in golf. Any ties are awarded the average number of points, with a minimum of 0 points awarded. Any ties are given the same total number of points. If both players tied again, the same point value would be assigned a tie. If any tie occurs, this number is displayed in the center of a card face, and will be used again for the next game.\n\nOutput:43\ninput:Which of the following is the most common time for a large retailer to receive online payments?

Answer in probability.\n\n### Answer:\nLet P(1) be the probability that 1 out of 20 tosses will land heads, and P(2) be the probability that exactly 2 out of 20 will land heads or tosses on a coin. P(1) is easy to solve for: it's.1. P(2) is more complicated.\nP(1 or 2) = 1 - (1 - P(1))^19   because P(1 or 2), i.e. 1 or more out of 20 heads, would be P(19 out of 20 landing tails and head on the 20th toss)\n\nP(2) = P(2 out of 21)*(P(19 out of  20 landing tails) + P(19 out 20 landing heads), the second term being equivalent to P(19 out    20 landing head and 20 head in 20 tosses, an impossibility)\n\nIf, at 20 tosses:  \n1-Heads = 1-1/20 \nand  \n1-Head and 1-Head = 2*2/20\n\nWe start by plugging 1-heads into P(21): \nP(1 or more out of any 20 tosses", "answer": "A: back pocket"}

Note,\n```\nStep 1 & Step 2\n\t7 75\n\t\n12 92\n```\n\n#### Step 3\n\nYou can use the shortcut key to add the two digits. (Ctrl + Shift + A) will give the output `[9 2`]. From the above output the value of 2 digits is 50.\n\n#### Step 4\n\nNow that you have the value of 12*7, you can subtract 7 from one digit and add it to the other digit. For example, `9 - 7` becomes `9 - 7 + 0` giving `2`.\n\n#### Step 5\n\nNow that you can get the output of step 4 repeated, you can repeat the previous output. So if for example, `1 - 8 + 0 = 9`, then the new value would be 9. The reason why you need to reiterate to use the value of step 4 is because step 4 is the same thing to step 3, ie what you are trying to do is to change the value of 2 to 2-8 or the other way around.\n\nIn sum, what you will get from repeating 4 steps is\n```\n12 - 7 = 5\n4 - 7 = -3\n2 - 8 = -6...\n```\nTo check this, simply insert 0 in place of the 9 in the example above.\n\n### Summary\nLet us summarize the value of 1 / 6 first.\n\n```\n6 - 6 = 0\n```\n\nIn summary, 1 / 6 becomes 0.\n\nNow let us repeat the same procedure for the 2 digit number.\n\n```\n2 + 6 = 8\n8 - 6 = 2\n2 - 6 = -4\n4 - 6 = -2...\n\n25 +5 = 50\n50 - 15 = 35\n35 - 15 =\n35 - 5 =\n35-1 = 34\n```\n\nNotebook", "answer": "D: underground"}

I asked a friend to go with me, figuring that he would be less intimidated by the prospect than I was. So when we saw the counselor, we sat down and I started speaking right away, because it wouldn't have seemed normal to her if I didn't. I spoke for 15 minutes, but all I did was answer questions. In fact, I ended up answering the exact same question three times. At the end, I thought for sure that I had screwed up, but my friend told me that it actually sounded really good. Choices: 1) I was worried about seeing my counselor because I didn\u2019t know what to expect; but by asking my friend to come with me we made the trip less scary. 2) My friend was just as nervous when he went to see his counselor as I was before I saw mine, but I think it was because he didn\u2019t want to look bad in front of me. 3) In 15 minutes I was able to answer my counselor\u2019s questions three different ways without them sounding repetitive; this helped because she was already starting to think I was screwing up. 4) Everyone tells me I\u2019m an expert at what I do for a living, but when I have to describe it, it sounds like I\u2019m a total idiot. 5) I had trouble getting any sleep that night because I kept thinking about what I should have said and what I shouldn\u2019t have said.

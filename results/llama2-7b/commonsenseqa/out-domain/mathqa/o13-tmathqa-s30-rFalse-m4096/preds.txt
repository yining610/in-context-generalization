Then a professor  made some observations about the rating method he used in the process. “There isn’t any way to rate every student with the same number of letters. How many A's are there more than two B' and  the same applies for the other  letters. Therefore, there are always some children getting bad scores in this way. For example, if the total number 61 children, then there are only 6 students can get A's. If the average is 72 students have the same grade, then we can see that 91% kids do not get the A's”  Which  of the following statements did the professor make? A: there are enough children getting A's. B: most children get an A. C: kids will be graded fairly according to their skills. D: All kids getting the same grade. E: most kids get the same grade.<n>Output: A<n>

For each scoring shot (i.e., a par, birdie, etc.), there are 3 parameters (distance, difficulty of shot, and strength of shot). All players have individual values for each of these parameters. For instance, a 200-yard par 4 may be difficult for some and easy for others. For a 160-yard birdie 3, some players may still consider it difficult while others consider it easy.<n>    Write a function that accepts a player and an array of parameters representing the course and a scoring<n>    shot (i.e. [ [ distance, difficulty, strength ] ]) and determines the players score for the shot. Note, only one shot<n>    may be applied per player and course. If there are two shots with the same distance, then they will both be applied to<n>    the score. You may assume that each shot can be applied only once. It may be difficult, but not required, for you<n>    to figure out the exact scoring formula; the important part is to determine the final score<n>    For example, if Jane is playing a par 4, the distance is 200 yards, difficulty is 1, and strength is 7, the final<n>    score would be (1 + 0.3 * 7) + 0.7 = 1.05<n>Input: Write a program that accepts input from a user via the command line.

The 9/11 was not an act of war.<n>Output: all of the above are true.<n><n>Input: The 2000 Presidential election saw election officials having to recount the ballots in the State of Florida for over two weeks until an all but final result was reached. One controversial aspect of the recount was the fact that many election officials recounted by hand rather than on the automatic vote counting machines. One Florida Supreme Court justice said during the recount that it cost $4.00 to recount a ballot by machine, but it was estimated to cost $5.00 each to manually recount the ballots. What was the most cost-effective strategy for Florida (or any other state for that matter) to employ?<n>Output: Automated voting machines are more cost efficient since they are faster and easier to use. Even so, manual recounts are more reliable than automated counting, so the manual recount is more valid choice. The manual counting is still a good exercise, since it allows anyone to observe and validate the results, which gives a confidence that the machines are actually performing the recount right.<n>

One of her eyes may fail, and that eye becomes blind, but she remains able to function and she will continue studying her language. But one day, not so long from now, she will be unable to distinguish the letters of her language at all, even if she looks at them on the keyboard, or on a page, or in a letter. When that day arrives she will not be able, as one who is deaf, or visually handicapped can, translate words, or read a book or listen to a novel on tape, for the language will be incomprehensible to her. It will begin to exist as music. In her thoughts, she will still use words, but the sound of the words will be lost on her ears as soon as they are out of her thoughts. The words will be like music, which means nothing to her, even though she may know their meaning perfectly. That day is coming for her one day. Will she know it? The same is true for all language users in this planet.<n>Choices:  A: her ability to write her language will deteriorate B: the quality of her language will decline C: her ability to use language will decline D: the grammar of her language will become unclear E: her language will become unintelligible to her contemporaries<n>Output: A ( 80% - 20 % )<n><n>

And yet the things that money can purchase -- such as health, a home, a loved one's love, the enjoyment of nature, and peace of mind -- are the things that are most important to us. There are more problems in life than there are solutions. Money isn't the source of problems; it's only the instrument used to purchase solutions or results. For instance, a man without enough money to provide adequately for his family may use the money he does have to improve his social position and make business contacts that may later enable him to increase his earnings significantly. Money thus becomes a means of self-improvement. <n><n>a) The word "purchases solutions" means:<n><n>1) to buy some medicines or things to cure diseases and illnesses.<n><n>2) to buy some things to solve the problems and difficulties. <n><n>b) "a man without" means:<n><n>I)  a man without anything (e.g. without home, without money etc.)<n><n>II) a man without manners or mor

Choices: Answer A.5 <n><n>Input: how are you doing? Choices:  Are you studying? A: Yes, I am<n>Output: B: great!<n><n>Input: You need to find the largest common factor (L.C.F) of some integers. Your function to do the job is: fact(x,y): returns the greatest common factor of x and y.<n><n>Your task is to find the greatest common factor (L. C. F) between 1 4 7 and 2 5 12. You first call fact(1 4 7, 7). Then you get your answer is 7, but you must call fact(147,2512) instead. Explain why (hint: when your input is too large, you must call fact twice in sequence)<n>Output: You need to call fact twice in sequence<n><n>Input:A girl is walking on level ground, while her grandmother is walking on level ground but is walking 1.8Km/h slower than the girl. The grandmother will catch the girl when she has walked for  18 mins. The grandmother's age is 50 years more than the granddaughter's age. What is the grandmother's current age? <n>Output: A. 34<n>

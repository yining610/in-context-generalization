How many A's are there more than two B' and  the same applies for the other  letters. Therefore, there are always some children getting bad scores in this way. For example, if the total number 61 children, then there are only 6 students can get A's.

For each scoring shot (i.e., a par, birdie, etc.), there are 3 parameters (distance, difficulty of shot, and strength of shot). All players have individual values for each of these parameters. For instance, a 200-yard par 4 may be difficult for some and easy for others. For a 160-yard birdie 3, some players may still consider it difficult while others consider it easy.\n    Write a function that accepts a player and an array of parameters representing the course and a scoring\n    shot (i.e. [ [ distance, difficulty, strength ] ]) and determines the players score for the shot. Note, only one shot\n    may be applied per player and course. If there are two shots with the same distance, then they will both be applied to\n    the score. You may assume that each shot can be applied only once. It may be difficult, but not required, for you\n    to figure out the exact scoring formula; the important part is to determine the final score\n    For example, if Jane is playing a par 4, the distance is 200 yards, difficulty is 1, and strength is 7, the final\n    score would be (1 + 0.3 * 7) + 0.7 = 1.05\nInput: Write a program that accepts input from a user via the command line.

One controversial aspect of the recount was the fact that many election officials recounted by hand rather than on the automatic vote counting machines. One Florida Supreme Court justice said during the recount that it cost $4.00 to recount a ballot by machine, but it was estimated to cost $5.00 each to manually recount the ballots. What was the most cost-effective strategy for Florida (or any other state for that matter) to employ?\nOutput: Automated voting machines are more cost efficient since they are faster and easier to use. Even so, manual recounts are more reliable than automated counting, so the manual recount is more valid choice. The manual counting is still a good exercise, since it allows anyone to observe and validate the results, which gives a confidence that the machines are actually performing the recount right.", "answer": "C: millpond"}

On recheck it was detected that one of the values which is 135 was a wrong entry for 145. So it should be 145 ( mean is 140.0333...).\n\n\n##### Question6\n\n\nIn this question we need to find the volume of the biggest sphere which can be inscribed in rectangular box.\n\nThe way you should start solving this problem is, the volume of the rectangular box ( 25 * 24 *18 - cm 3 ) represents the total volume of a sphere. ( you can do this by the volume of the sphere using *radius method or *direct method)\n\n*radius method : \nfind the radius of the sphere. Radius of the sphere is the radius of circle which passes through that rectangular box.\nSo radius = 25,24,18(  cm )\n\nThe radius of sphere is half of the volume of the rectanular box. 25 * 8 / 2, 24 * 7 / 2 and 18 * 5 / 2 ( as there are 8, 7 and 5 sides of the box respectively).\n\nFind the radius of the sphere\n\n\nvolume of rectangle : 25 * 18 * 25 = 46,250\n\nradius of sphere : 25\n\nvolume of the sphere : 46,242 - cm 3 \n\n\nNow we see that 46,202 * 3 < 46,232, 46,212 < 46,301 and < 46,182. We found that 46,192 is the radius of the sphere, and its volume is = 27,587 - cm 3.\n\nSo the output is ( b ). \n\n\n\n\n\n#####Question 8\n\n\n\n\n### Question 9\n\n\n\n1/33 * 1 / 9 = 1/3 * 1 /10 \nIf a gives b head start 1 / 11 *", "answer": "E: ireland"}

There are more problems in life than there are solutions. Money isn't the source of problems; it's only the instrument used to purchase solutions or results. For instance, a man without enough money to provide adequately for his family may use the money he does have to improve his social position and make business contacts that may later enable him to increase his earnings significantly. Money thus becomes a means of self-improvement. \n\na) The word \"purchases solutions\" means:\n\n1) to buy some medicines or things to cure diseases and illnesses.\n\n2) to buy some things to solve the problems and difficulties. \n\nb) \"a man without\" means:\n\nI)  a man without anything (e.g. without home, without money etc.)\n\nII) a man without manners or mor", "answer": "D: surface of earth"}

{"idx": 179, "text": "The intersection with the largest number of collisions is the one with a fork in the road. People will most likely stop at a fork in the road because people only glance 90 degrees in each direction and there are six directions to look. If they are running late and have more to focus on, they will most likely stop at the fork in the road and continue their way down the street. If they're driving a car it can be dangerous to stop at the fork in intersection because they risk getting rear ended or going into another oncoming lane if there isn't a stop light.\nExplanation: People will most likely stop and wait at the fork in the intersection because they only take a glance. By default the fork in the road is also the widest crossing with six directions.

There is an unusual rule stated in a puzzle I saw yesterday. It is that the U is always before the K. I have done some checking on this and find that with the words I have examined, the rule is true, so I will assume it to be true for purposes of this problem.

{"idx": 300, "text": "the answer is (a) in short, the answer is B. to understand a concept, you need two main components: (1) mental representation (2) motivational factors in order to learn anything, you need to have a proper mental representation and motivation to get there. mental representation is how something, like a concept, is mapped to your brain. having a great mental representation helps you understand that concept, remember it, and apply it in new and different contexts. motivation helps you get there. having low motivation will make it impossible to learn or understand hard concepts. even if you have the strongest mental representation, if you're not motivated, you will not learn that concept no matter how many times you try. when you think a concept is hard, it may help you to use mental imagery and associations to understand the concept. the key component of mental images is making them relatable. in other words, what does that concept look like? in contrast to mental imagery, associative learning uses the relationship that exists between at least two concepts. you can use associative learning to improve your memory and mental recall. for instance, instead of drawing a tree to remember the concept of evolution, you can think of an apple and peach. using associative learning to strengthen the connection between 2 concepts is a great way to get to know and understand more complex concepts. it is essential to understand the difference between mental imagery vs. associative learning. while associative learning focuses more on the relationship between 2 concepts, mental images focus on creating mental images. when you think of mental imagery vs.  associative learning, think of how a concept looks instead of how it is  related. by using mental images and associative learning methods, you make learning easier and faster.

Choices:  A B C D E F\nOutput: I would choose the B option.\n\n### Hint:\n\nYou can't use `len` to determine length of the string (as it will always come up with length as 1). You need to have a variable for that `length`.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe character we use `n`. Since we want `n` number of spaces, it's going to the `length of the string`.\n\nTo convert `string 1` into `0`, and `string 2` into `1`, we take the `character at index of `n` - 1` or `n` - 2 for `string 2` as it's length is more, and `+1` as it is the leading zero, `which should be removed`.\n\nThe condition to check is that we check for all `char` in a `string 1` and `string 2`,\n\nTo do it, we apply this step: `if` `A[i]` is `\"-\"` then `string 1[i]` and `string 2[i]` and if is `0` add to `list` else just add to `list`, `else` just add to `list`.  \n\n`List` after iteration should have the `total_sum`. To check if the `value` is a `number`, we use `isdigit()` function as it will return True if it's a digit, otherwise False.\n\n### Examples:\n\n```\nInput:a[0] = \"99\"\n\nOutput: 0+1*6+2, so it is 7\n\nExample:a[0]=\"11\", it was 19 at 1st iteration, as it is a digit of the first string, as it contains \"-\" as the first element of 1st string.\n\nif any element in list a is not a number, like a[1]= \"99\" = 9\n\n```\n### Instruction:\nPrint the values in the linked lists with minimum count after merging.

So for 'a' to be a valid answer, '+ 3' has to be a number. So the value of 98 can be either 98, -98 or zero, so let's check all of these. Okay, 98 = 98 + 3 98 + 0 = 98 - - - 98 - 3 16 + 3 = 19 then we check 'd', and 'd' has to be a value so let's check it's value is either one, '3' or '5' is also a number. Okay, 19 is 19 + 3, 19 - - - 19 - 3 19 - 0 = 19 -9 = 10. Okay then we check 'e' and 'e' has to be a real number. So let's try 36.5, it equals 36.5 + (-3) -3, 36.5 - - - 12.

Therefore, the time  interval between reaching the given destination  and meeting  the other bus  is t. t = \\ frac 2 t - 2 t = t 2 d - 4 d = 2 t therefore, if the speed of the buses is v = 2 km per hour and w = 4 km per hour, the time required to meet the other bus is \\ frac { t } { d } = \\ frac 8 - 8 h. answer : in first bus's case, the time required is t 2 = 8 2 \\ = 8 and in second bus's case, t = 8 6 = 8. therefore, t = 8 and the correct answer is d  \nSo the final answer will be 19", "answer": "A: driving"}

We will observe that this question appears to be open-ended (i.e., answers are not limited to the choices provided) and this is a form of multiple choice in which the correct response may or may not be an option. 2. A closed-ended question is an inquiry containing a limited number of choices or alternatives to choose from. 3. There are several types of questions that can be classified according to their format or level of response. a )Closed-ended questions may be dichotomous ( i.e., dichosis) or multiple choice. The following is an example of a closed-ended question containing multiple response alternatives: \"How likely is it that we will make significant progress on the plan?\" and it would have response alternatives as follows: 1. Not at all uncertain 2. Unlikely 3. Moderately uncertain 4. Somewhat uncertain 5. Very uncertain 6. Not at all certain. b )The questions presented can be classified into three broad categories: 1. Single choice: The respondent is asked to respond by choosing only one option in a series (multiple answer questions) or one element out of a series of possible answers (multiple select question). 2. Multi-choice: There are a limited number of possible answers and several answers are presented in different combinations to allow multiple selections per item. 3. Differential item: The respondent is expected to select between two or more elements. 4. Rating scale: This format involves the use of numerical values to measure responses 5. Open-ended questions: The respondent simply provide an answer or writes in an answer.The answers can be analyzed by hand by a researcher or by analyzing the words entered into a question to extract the response. The next one is an example of an open-ended question: \"What do you think of our new website? You may write whatever you wish\". 6. Likert Scale : This is used as a tool to measure the level of agreement or disagreement with a statement, by ranking the item in the questionnaire by respondents. Questions are written in the form of positive statement or negative statement and responses are coded by number (e.g., on a scale as - 1, - 2,.. 1, 2,.. 3, 4, 5...), which is then transformed into a continuous scale. 7.

Sunlight is made up of invisible light rays. They have wavelengths ranging from 4,000-7,000nm. These 300 - 500nm of the Sun\u2019s rays are dangerous for the eyes, as the ultraviolet radiation (UV) damages the retina. Overexposure to sunlight, especially for the elderly and children, causes an irritation to the eyes. They also cause the cornea of the eye to dry off, thus leading to permanent visual impairment. Sunglasses protect from the Sun\u2019s UV light by blocking it completely. They protect your eyes from harmful UV rays by reflecting them back. They are not the best protective measure, but they are the only way in which a person can protect the eyes from overexposure. People wearing sunglasses do not feel any discomfort or heat in the eyes. To avoid eye diseases, one must wear sunglasses when driving or doing outdoor activities.", "answer": "B: exhaustion"}

{"idx": 946, "text": "Inability to learn is result of two broad categories of causes: 1. internal: 2. external both are mentioned below : Internal causes:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item The inability to learn results from not having developed adequate skills for learning. If a student was never exposed to reading, he would not be able to read. Similarly, a student who has never acquired a vocabulary and basic grammar skills would have a limited capacity to learn.\n\\item Inability to recall is one of the most frequent complaints of people seeking assistance because of the effects of brain\npathologies. Inability to recall does lead to inability to learn. The problem is a neuroanatomical problem in the brain and related to the part of the brain that controls functioning of memory. The problem is not, of course, a matter of forgetfulness, but rather a matter of faulty storage of information that makes learning impossible.\n\\item Lack of interest can be a cause resulting from inadequate interest from caregivers.\n\\item A variety of disorders can produce inability to learn. Some of the commonest problems are attention disorders such as attention deficiency disorder (ADD) and attention deficiency hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), learning disorders/developmental disorders, language problems, intellectual disabilities and brain pathologies or degenerative diseases.\n\\item Neuroanatomical problems can lead to inability to remember (memory); some of these problems have the term \"dementia\" in their names. These can be Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Parkinson's disease and Korsakoff's syndrome.\n\\item Behavior problems: inadequate behavior and attention control can be caused by a variety of problems. Some of these are genetically based with genetically linked disorders such as autism, Tourette's syndrome, and obsessive-compulsive disorders that are linked to behavior/learning problems. Behavior problems can also occur in a person who simply has had inadequate training in control of behavior.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nExternal causes:\n\\begin {itemize}\n\\item Inability can be caused by problems in the environment such as social barriers to access, lack of transportation to", "answer": "D: distress"}

What are the different types of functions?\n\n####Definition of Function\n- A function is a set of distinct inputs having a unique output value.\n- A function assigns each element of an input set x to exactly one element of an output set y.\n- Functions represent the relationships between input values and output values.\n- There are three types of functions\n    - One-to-one functions\n      In this type of function, 1 input, then 1 output\n    - Inverse Functions\n      Functions that undo each other are called inverse functions. For instance, subtracting from a number gives the inverse of adding\n      One example of inverse function: x + y = 6, then x - y = 2 if, 6 - 6 = 0, we get (0/0) then it means 6 + 6 = 12 so, 12 + y = 6\n    - One to one and onto functions.\n      In this type, 1 input, but 1 or more output. To prove it, find number of function. Find the number of function for the relation\n      5, ___. If we take one input only then it is 1, 4, 8,12 so, it is 4.\n\n\nWhat are Function Notations? What is a Domain and a Range of a Function?\n\n####Domain\n- Every domain has:\n    - one or more elements (input).\n    - One or more associated outputs (range)\n- The domain is the set of all input points x\n- When there is a one to one function, then range is the same input domain.\n- The input domain and the input range are the same.\n- If the function has 5 as its input and its output is 11 then it means that every element in function is associated to one", "answer": "E: wet"}

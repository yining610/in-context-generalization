Choices:  A: cars B: city street C: street corner D: fork in road E: at a red light<n>Output:		The intersection with the largest number of collisions is the one with a fork in the road. People will most likely stop at a fork in the road because people only glance 90 degrees in each direction and there are six directions to look. If they are running late and have more to focus on, they will most likely stop at the fork in the road and continue their way down the street. If they're driving a car it can be dangerous to stop at the fork in intersection because they risk getting rear ended or going into another oncoming lane if there isn't a stop light.<n>Explanation: People will most likely stop and wait at the fork in the intersection because they only take a glance. By default the fork in the road is also the widest crossing with six directions. Therefore, even if traffic is going by in heavy volume they will stop their car or wait at the fork of the road.

So he decides to sleep 8 hours a day. After a few months he feels very good, but at the end of each day, he feels exhausted, so he decides to sleep a lot. But that makes him irritable and depressed. He then concludes that every good decision has a bad consequence. In life, he can only keep what is important. To do this it is necessary to lose all unnecessary things, such as: the desire for comfort, the desire for beauty, a desire for fame or prestige. Therefore, he sells all his belongings and buys a ticket for the New World. So he wants to go on his own journey, away from people of different habits and opinions, but he has never even been in any part of the world. From that moment he no longer needs anyone except himself to be happy. He is now a happier person than ever.

Choices:  A: copy B: intelligent C: improved performance D: empowering E: have more knowledge<n>Output:		the answer is (a) in short, the answer is B. to understand a concept, you need two main components: (1) mental representation (2) motivational factors in order to learn anything, you need to have a proper mental representation and motivation to get there. mental representation is how something, like a concept, is mapped to your brain. having a great mental representation helps you understand that concept, remember it, and apply it in new and different contexts. motivation helps you get there. having low motivation will make it impossible to learn or understand hard concepts. even if you have the strongest mental representation, if you're not motivated, you will not learn that concept no matter how many times you try. when you think a concept is hard, it may help you to use mental imagery and associations to understand the concept. the key component of mental images is making them relatable. in other words, what does that concept look like? in contrast to mental imagery, associative learning uses the relationship that exists between at least two concepts. you can use associative learning to improve your memory and mental recall. for instance, instead of drawing a tree to remember the concept of evolution, you can think of an apple and peach. using associative learning to strengthen the connection between 2 concepts is a great way to get to know and understand more complex concepts. it is essential to understand the difference between mental imagery vs. associative learning. while associative learning focuses more on the relationship between 2 concepts, mental images focus on creating mental images. when you think of mental imagery vs.  associative learning, think of how a concept looks instead of how it is  related. by using mental images and associative learning methods, you make learning easier and faster.

Since we want `n` number of spaces, it's going to the `length of the string`.<n><n>To convert `string 1` into `0`, and `string 2` into `1`, we take the `character at index of `n` - 1` or `n` - 2 for `string 2` as it's length is more, and `+1` as it is the leading zero, `which should be removed`.<n><n>The condition to check is that we check for all `char` in a `string 1` and `string 2`,<n><n>To do it, we apply this step: `if` `A[i]` is `"-"` then `string 1[i]` and `string 2[i]` and if is `0` add to `list` else just add to `list`, `else` just add to `list`.  <n><n>`List` after iteration should have the `total_sum`. To check if the `value` is a `number`, we use `isdigit()` function as it will return True if it's a digit, otherwise False.<n><n>### Examples:<n><n>```<n>Input:a[0] = "99"<n><n>Output: 0+1*6+2, so it is 7<n><n>Example:a[0]="11", it was 19 at 1st iteration, as it is a digit of the first string, as it contains "-" as the first element of 1st string.<n><n>if any element in list a is not a number, like a[1]= "99" = 9<n><n>```<n>### Instruction:<n>Print the values in the linked lists with minimum count after merging.

So for 'a' to be a valid answer, '+ 3' has to be a number. So the value of 98 can be either 98, -98 or zero, so let's check all of these. Okay, 98 = 98 + 3 98 + 0 = 98 - - - 98 - 3 16 + 3 = 19 then we check 'd', and 'd' has to be a value so let's check it's value is either one, '3' or '5' is also a number. Okay, 19 is 19 + 3, 19 - - - 19 - 3 19 - 0 = 19 -9 = 10. Okay then we check 'e' and 'e' has to be a real number. So let's try 36.5, it equals 36.5 + (-3) -3, 36.5 - - - 12. Then we try 'c' and 'c' has to be any positive or negative whole number. So let' s check some positive numbers, zero, one, two, - - - and for these ones they have to be greater than '+ 0'.<n>So 120. 5 can't do that. So the only ones that don't hit that condition are 'b' and 'e'. The others are outside of the domain. So the answer is 'b' and 'c' or 'e'.<n>So the final answer i<n><n>Input:A train is running in the same direction from the station every hour and has a constant speed.

If the speed of first bus is v and second bus is w, what is the value of t?<n>Output: the distance between the bus and their meeting point is d. there are 2 ways to reach the point of their meeting : 1- first bus reaches the destination and waits for the other bus, and the other bus reaches the destination in its own speed. Therefore, the time interval between reaching the given  destination and meeting the other bus  is \ frac 2 d - 2 t. 2- second bus reaches the given destination and waits for first bus, and the other reaches the given  destination in its own speed, and the first bus  catches the other bus and reaches the meeting point. Therefore, the time  interval between reaching the given destination  and meeting  the other bus  is t. t = \ frac 2 t - 2 t = t 2 d - 4 d = 2 t therefore, if the speed of the buses is v = 2 km per hour and w = 4 km per hour, the time required to meet the other bus is \ frac { t } { d } = \ frac 8 - 8 h. answer : in first bus's case, the time required is t 2 = 8 2 \ = 8 and in second bus's case, t = 8 6 = 8. therefore, t = 8 and the correct answer is d  <n>So the final answer will be 19<n>

We will observe that this question appears to be open-ended (i.e., answers are not limited to the choices provided) and this is a form of multiple choice in which the correct response may or may not be an option. 2. A closed-ended question is an inquiry containing a limited number of choices or alternatives to choose from. 3. There are several types of questions that can be classified according to their format or level of response. a )Closed-ended questions may be dichotomous ( i.e., dichosis) or multiple choice. The following is an example of a closed-ended question containing multiple response alternatives: "How likely is it that we will make significant progress on the plan?" and it would have response alternatives as follows: 1. Not at all uncertain 2. Unlikely 3. Moderately uncertain 4. Somewhat uncertain 5. Very uncertain 6. Not at all certain. b )The questions presented can be classified into three broad categories: 1. Single choice: The respondent is asked to respond by choosing only one option in a series (multiple answer questions) or one element out of a series of possible answers (multiple select question). 2. Multi-choice: There are a limited number of possible answers and several answers are presented in different combinations to allow multiple selections per item. 3. Differential item: The respondent is expected to select between two or more elements. 4. Rating scale: This format involves the use of numerical values to measure responses 5. Open-ended questions: The respondent simply provide an answer or writes in an answer.The answers can be analyzed by hand by a researcher or by analyzing the words entered into a question to extract the response. The next one is an example of an open-ended question: "What do you think of our new website? You may write whatever you wish". 6. Likert Scale : This is used as a tool to measure the level of agreement or disagreement with a statement, by ranking the item in the questionnaire by respondents. Questions are written in the form of positive statement or negative statement and responses are coded by number (e.g., on a scale as - 1, - 2,.. 1, 2,.. 3, 4, 5...), which is then transformed into a continuous scale. 7.

First, let us plug in the numbers into the quadratic equation as follows : b^2 = 25. 04 where "b" stands for the square root of ( 5. 07 )^2. We solve the quadratic equation as follows. (b - 2 ) ( b + 2 ) = 0 therefore, b = 2 \ frac { \sqrt { 5. 04 } - 2, \sqrt { 5 0 4 } - 2 } { 2 } = 2. 295 therefore, "b" = 2. 3 and the square root of (45 )^2 = 2. 16. therefore, square root of 5. 0 is 2. 3. note : if we would like to find the square root of a negative number, we perform the following steps : - take the reciprocal of the square root of the number and then make the square of it. - for example when we try to obtain the square root of - 10, we would perform the following steps : 200 / ( -10 )2 = -200 / -100 = 2 therefore, the square root of -10 = sqrt( 2 ).<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the follow up question.<n><n>### Instuction:Answer the follow up instructions.

They put up a sign outside which stated that “Men and women can walk in for 4 days straight, but children can walk in only on Sundays.” One day, Aradhana went with her husband Rahul and bought TWO shirts, Arushi went with her mother and bought TWO dresses, Avantika went with her girlfriend and bought FIVE shirts. Was it a success? Explain in detail?<n><n>Output:The three friends can check the number of customers according to the above information, the answer is no. It is clear that a child enters the store only on Sundays, if the child enters the store, the age is above 6. This means that women and men can enter the store 4 days a week. After the store was established, in one day, Arushi and Aradhana came at the same time. There are 5 boys and 4 girls (each), so a total of 9 people. If there were 9 people on one day, how much money did they spend? (Aradhana and Arushi are also in the store for two days, Arushi and Avantika are 2 pairs of people, Aradhana and Rahul are 1 pair of people. 9 x 4 + 5, and 4 x 5 + 2, 3 pairs, that is, Aradhana. In the end, the total number of people is 2 people, so the total amount 4 x 4 + 4 x 3, 9 x 4, 5 x 5, the total amount spent 10 girls to 3 men, to a total of 9 girls. The total amount spent is the minimum, that is, 6 x 5 men to 9 girls) According to our experience, men will buy clothes for themselves and women will buy clothes for themselves. So

But, hey, let’s not judge that poor soul’s trash.<n><n>Finally, Choice E is a trashcan, though it is a bit unclear how “watching” garbage would occur from this location so I chose C as my answer.<n><n>So the final answer C<n><n>Input: The sum of a number and three times the number is 70.

So “35” times the sum is 105. So 70 is three times the number and four times the sum, so 70 = 3[105] or 3[2] 2(15) so 70 is 3 * 105, or 3 * 3 * 5.<n><n>So, 3 + 4 is 7. Our solution is 70 = 70, so a = 70. So 35 is the number. So the

Sunlight is made up of invisible light rays. They have wavelengths ranging from 4,000-7,000nm. These 300 - 500nm of the Sun’s rays are dangerous for the eyes, as the ultraviolet radiation (UV) damages the retina. Overexposure to sunlight, especially for the elderly and children, causes an irritation to the eyes. They also cause the cornea of the eye to dry off, thus leading to permanent visual impairment. Sunglasses protect from the Sun’s UV light by blocking it completely. They protect your eyes from harmful UV rays by reflecting them back. They are not the best protective measure, but they are the only way in which a person can protect the eyes from overexposure. People wearing sunglasses do not feel any discomfort or heat in the eyes. To avoid eye diseases, one must wear sunglasses when driving or doing outdoor activities.

Choices:  A: intelligence B: education C: effectiveness D: distress E: a stupid<n>Output:		Inability to learn is result of two broad categories of causes: 1. internal: 2. external both are mentioned below : Internal causes:<n>\begin{itemize}<n>\item The inability to learn results from not having developed adequate skills for learning. If a student was never exposed to reading, he would not be able to read. Similarly, a student who has never acquired a vocabulary and basic grammar skills would have a limited capacity to learn.<n>\item Inability to recall is one of the most frequent complaints of people seeking assistance because of the effects of brain<n>pathologies. Inability to recall does lead to inability to learn. The problem is a neuroanatomical problem in the brain and related to the part of the brain that controls functioning of memory. The problem is not, of course, a matter of forgetfulness, but rather a matter of faulty storage of information that makes learning impossible.<n>\item Lack of interest can be a cause resulting from inadequate interest from caregivers.<n>\item A variety of disorders can produce inability to learn. Some of the commonest problems are attention disorders such as attention deficiency disorder (ADD) and attention deficiency hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), learning disorders/developmental disorders, language problems, intellectual disabilities and brain pathologies or degenerative diseases.<n>\item Neuroanatomical problems can lead to inability to remember (memory); some of these problems have the term "dementia" in their names. These can be Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Parkinson's disease and Korsakoff's syndrome.<n>\item Behavior problems: inadequate behavior and attention control can be caused by a variety of problems.

Choices:  A: tiredness B: grogginess C: discomfort D: getting out of bed E: eyes opening<n>Output:		B is correct. When you wake up from sleep and open your eyes it takes several minutes before your eyes are clear and focused. The light on the ceiling of a room may be one of the most frequent reasons for early morning grogginess. Waking up from sleep in the night can also cause grogginess during the day. Grogginess is an involuntary condition and therefore does not occur to a particular degree. The sensation of being groggy can be reduced by not staying in bed longer than absolutely necessary and having a good night sleep. Grogginess from going to bed too late and not able to have a good sleep can affect your performance the next morning. The first thing to do is waking up early before dawn so that you have ample time for exercise and nutrition.<n><n>Bill was awaking, what was happening to him?

What are the different types of functions?<n><n>####Definition of Function<n>- A function is a set of distinct inputs having a unique output value.<n>- A function assigns each element of an input set x to exactly one element of an output set y.<n>- Functions represent the relationships between input values and output values.<n>- There are three types of functions<n>    - One-to-one functions<n>      In this type of function, 1 input, then 1 output<n>    - Inverse Functions<n>      Functions that undo each other are called inverse functions. For instance, subtracting from a number gives the inverse of adding<n>      One example of inverse function: x + y = 6, then x - y = 2 if, 6 - 6 = 0, we get (0/0) then it means 6 + 6 = 12 so, 12 + y = 6<n>    - One to one and onto functions.<n>      In this type, 1 input, but 1 or more output. To prove it, find number of function. Find the number of function for the relation<n>      5, ___. If we take one input only then it is 1, 4, 8,12 so, it is 4.<n><n><n>What are Function Notations? What is a Domain and a Range of a Function?<n><n>####Domain<n>- Every domain has:<n>    - one or more elements (input).<n>    - One or more associated outputs (range)<n>- The domain is the set of all input points x<n>- When there is a one to one function, then range is the same input domain.<n>- The input domain and the input range are the same.<n>- If the function has 5 as its input and its output is 11 then it means that every element in function is associated to one

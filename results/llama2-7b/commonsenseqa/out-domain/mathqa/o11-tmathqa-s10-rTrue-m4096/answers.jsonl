{"idx": 336, "text": "Option A\nSo the final answer should be is A\n### Solution:\n##### Explanation for 1st question's solution:\nA and B are equal to 1/5.\nSince each of the answers are divisible by five, so the answer is A or B, which should also be divisible by 5\nHence the answer is B.\n\n##### Explanatin for 2nd question's solution:C is the required answer with a stepwise deduction.\n\nI am assuming that option B and C are different.\n\nFirst C is the answer. So let's see what's the relation of C option with A and B option.\n\nWe can apply the fact: 2 numbers A and B both are different and A > B, but C is = to their sum\n\nNow we have a situation: C is one of those numbers, which can be found by subtracting two different numbers.\n\nC cannot be more than B, because if you subtracted two numbers, the result will be negative and C must be equal to B or less than B.\n\nThis is true for A as well, let's see the condition on A.\n\nC is equal to A or A is less than C.\n\nBut since we know A and C are the sum of two numbers and A > B\n\nSo we get A+B > C,\n\nA > C-B\n\nLet C = (a+b)\n\nNow we know for any two different numbers A and B, subtracting them will always be an inter-vall.\n\nSo if we are subtracting A from C, that interval is greater than B, which gives us two options:\n\nC+B < A or C+B > A\n\nSo there are two options, either C+B < A and we should compare sum to each number in A, or  C+B > A and we should compare C with each sum in A.\n\nThe first option is most probable as C cannot be less than B as previously said.\n\nBut first we need to check how this option works by subtracting 1 and 2(this is just a simple example to understand the concept).\n\nC+B is (3+1)\n\nwhich gives me the number 4\n\nSo A is between 1 and 4, this is just an example", "answer": "C: red barn"}

On 6 months the client offers to pay?90 as per a discount scheme. If the seller declines, what is the maximum loss, if any?\n\n### Solution:\nThe profit ratio is `200 / ( 200 - 68 )`. Since profit is negative, the profit ratio is negative.\n```\n150 / 200 = 1 / 4 and 90 / 204 = 1 / 23\nHence, 23 / 4 = 5.75, i.e., profit loss is 575 / 1000\n```\n\nLet x be the number of men in a family.

It is often said to have originated either in Greece or in the Near East. The Greek origin is by far the most popular and is supported by more than 95% of Greeks who claim ethnic origin and can be traced back to ancient Greece.\nGreece has become a melting pot for people of many nationalities and is the most ethnically diverse of the European nations.\nThe earliest settlers to make a claim to Greece were from the Neolithic era and came to the country from Anatolia(which is now Turkey) and were probably Pelasgian.\nMost scholars believe that Greece was called Ionia, and the Aeolians made up most of the population in about the ninth century BC. The Ionians were a people of Doric origins that migrated to Anatolia.\nDuring the 20th Century Greece experienced a very large rise in population  largely due to the mass emigration of people from Asia Minor.\nThe most obvious of these are the Aegean Islands of Cyprus, which was colonized by the Phoenicians of Tyre during the 10th century BC.\nGreeks did the most to expand its maritime, cultural, and political influence in the Mediterranean beginning in the 8th century BC.\nThe Peloponnese became a colony of Greece in the 8th and 7th centuries BC. They founded colonies as far west as the island of Massalia ( now Marseilles), France.\nIt is believed that most Greeks are descendants of the various invaders.\nThe Greeks have contributed greatly to their civilizations.\nGREECE is believed to be the cradle of Western civilization \"]\nSo the final answer", "answer": "A: georgia"}

This exchange floor is located in a building in lower Manhattan along Wall Street. The building itself contains no retail operations, making it unique from many of Wall Street's other buildings.\nThe NYSE trading floor actually has four stories above ground with one story underground. The exchange floor itself is on the underground level. It features only 15 exchanges or what are called pillars - in which two floors of NYSE member companies trade. These exchanges are each dedicated to a specific industry. One of the pillars is set aside for the financial sector.\nOne of the interesting facts about the NYSE floor is that it is not always open and operational. Sometimes, it is shut down during the trading of the various stocks when the market has volatility issues or other problems. When the NYSE goes into an emergency shutdown, NYSE trading floor staffers are told to make sure they are on the floor, not in the elevator.

{"idx": 629, "text": "I will give you an example. It shows that the probability of something happening can't be negative.\nIf i flip a coin, probability of getting heads is 1 / 2 or 50 %. if i have 1 coin ( 50 % chance ) and 2 coins ( 1 / 2 chance for both ) then probability of getting either head or tail is 50 %.\nNow if i put 1 coin and 2 coins in my pocket and put them in 1 lot then i have 2 coins, 50 % is half of the remaining coin ( 1 / 3 chance ) and 50 % is not removed. so probability of getting either head and tail is 1 / 3 which makes it 33 %.\nIf i have 3 coins and i put them in 1 group then 1 coin will be 1 / 3 and remaining 2 coins 50 %. So in my pocket, probability of getting head will be 50 % which will be half of the probability of getting either head OR tail ( if we don't count the second probability as 0 ).\nNow if we had 100 or 3 coins ( 1 chance ) which means it would have all the three coins in our pocket. When we have 50 % chance each coin, probability of getting either head, tail or BOTH will be 1 / ( 3 * 3 * 3 ) = 1 / ( 27 ). i.e 3.6 %.

In May, the temperature rose above the average temperature for March. The average temperature for May to August was almost the same as October-December \nOutput: The correct answer is E\nThe average temperature from February - December is (678+716+718+678+1152+1187+746)/8= ~690\nSince the average from February -  December is 690, the average for March, even if it was warmer than December, should not exceed this because the change in the average from February - March would be positive even if the March average were above 690 because the February average was 678 which is much lower than 690. Similarly, the average from May - August could not be above 690 since it is the average of 5 months and it would then be much higher than the average from February - May. Therefore, 690 was the correct choice.\n\n\nInput:Jim wants to hire a car. He can afford to have his car driven 500 kilometers per week and wants a cheaper car. So he bought a car for 650 dollars.

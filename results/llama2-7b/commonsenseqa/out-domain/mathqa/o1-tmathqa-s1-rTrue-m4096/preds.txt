There are no errors in that, so if the user types, "b" when the user input is "B", there is no error. We are just returned the value. It's like checking if a string is a palindromes, we just return true or false. The return statements, are the return values you're returning.

Ideas which may seem silly or odd in themselves, become vital components of a group's working towards a solution to a problem. Group brainstragies have proven to be highly successful.<n><n><n>### Mapping and sequencing <n>Mapping allows us to organize, analyse, and develop our thoughts. The use of concept maps can be particularly useful

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: what is 12 percent of 80? a ) 11.21, b ) 9.6, c ) 8.66, d ) 12.23, e ) 13.1<n>Output: "we assume that 80 is 100 % assume'x'is value we looking for here, 80 = 100 % and x = 12 % therefore, 80 / x = 100 % / 12 % 80 / x = 8.33 x = 9.6 b"<n>So the final answer is b<n><n>Input:What is a person who is well educated? Choices:  A: illiterate B: knowledgable C: own house D: have enough food E: meet expectations<n>Output:		<n><n>Comment: What's the problem? `12 % of 80 = 8.66`<n><n>Comment: The question is confusing. It's unclear whether the answer is 88% - why would it be 12%?<n><n>Answer: `12 % of ` 80 is 8.66<n><n>`is 100 %`, so 8.66 / 100 % = 86.6%<n><n>Comment: So 8.66 % is 86.6 %?<n><n>Comment: The OP already asked what's 12%... why are you suggesting what's 11.2%?<n><n>Comment: Sorry I didn't get you<n><n>Comment: "12% is 86%"? It's like saying "12 minutes is 86 minutes". It's not correct. You must remember that percentages is a ratio of number of quantities divided by 100. So 12% is 1/8 which is 12.5%.<n><n>Answer: You can do this by rounding 80 to 100 and then subtracting 20, which is one quarter of 80. I assume you get 86.66 from your division in the question but I do not know what you want to round it to. So your answer is 80/0.12 = 66.66 rounded to 67%. There are many ways to do this in software, here is one:<n><n>\begin{code}<n>// input percentage, rounded percent, number to scale<n><n>float percentageToScale = 0.12;<n><n>int percentageToRound = (int)round(percentageToScale * 100.0f);<n><n>float percentage = fabs(percentageToScale);<n><n>float scaledValue = percentageToScale;<n>scaledValue *= 100.f;<n>float scaledFloatValue = scaledValue;<n>if (scaledFloatValue >= 1.0f) // need to round by this much<n>{<n>float roundedValue = round(scaledFloatValue);<n>float roundedFloatValue = roundedValue;<n>}<n>\end{code}

This program requires you to enter two variables into the code: one to represent what you're looking for, and the other to represent the percentage. The reason the code works, is because it knows that the program expects a percent given the % command and the value for what you're looking to find.<n> 2. The program we created in Javascript relies on the operator '%' as well as other operators that we learned in previous programming classes.<n> 3. We learned how the syntax % and how to format a program based on a certain prompt being answered.<n>

You are not supposed to know which questions are which. You are supposed to solve them as you see them. But if there are 12 questions, surely it is in principle possible to memorise those 12 questions. If  you can do that, you do not need any other knowledge of the contents of the questions.

The test is not realistically practical anyway (at least the first 4 questions, let alone that last question!). Not even the question setter thinks it is.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: what is 12 percent of 80? a ) 11.21, b ) 9.6, c ) 8.66, d ) 12.23, e ) 13.1<n>Output: "we assume that 80 is 100 % assume'x'is value we looking for here, 80 = 100 % and x = 12 % therefore, 80 / x = 100 % / 12 % 80 / x = 8.33 x = 9.6 b"<n>So the final answer is b<n><n>Input:She curled up under a blanket to get warm, this made her what on the couch as they started movie? Choices:  A: sleep B: feel more comfortable C: sweating D: blush E: cuddle<n>Output:		A<n>The answer is :<n>Because she curled up under a jacket for warmth, then started to feel more comfortable.<n>Now we look at how many " curled up under a " in the input string<n>so: we look for " under a " in the string, under is the first word, so the pos-index of under is 0 for example the other index is 3 ( index means the numeber of element ), the length of string is 7<n>under is at index 0, means that under the blanket is at 0,0% of the blanket is 0 so, we need to make it percent of whole blanket,100% of blanket = 1, so 0 is not blanket, we divide the first word by 1, the string is ["under"] and only ["under"] is under the blanket, index of under blanket = 0<n>now the second word is ["blanket"], index of ["blanket"] is 4 0 - 4 is 4<n>so blanket % of 100 is 1/4 = 0.25, under the blanket + blanket % ( blanket % of 4 ) is 25/4 = 6.25<n>so 6.25 = 7, (4 * 7 ) / 6.25 is the blanket, 4 * 7 is the whole blanket, 6.25 / 7 is the under blanket, % is 4.71, so we get answer C<n><n>

This is how we know x = 700 because 700x400% =1000 therefore 1000/1000 = 1 and this is our answer<n><n>input:What is 90% of 75?a) 0.9, b) 79, c) 6.1, d) 74.01, e) 69.95<n>output:what is 90% percent of 75. 90% and 75 is given. Since 75 is less than 100 so 75 = 5/ 10 and we should take 5 times 80 because 5 times 85 is a whole number. Since our answer should be whole.

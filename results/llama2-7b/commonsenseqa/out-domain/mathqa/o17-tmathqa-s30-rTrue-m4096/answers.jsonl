If the rate of growth in life expectancy is 2.9 years per decade, what is the life expectancy expected at birth in the year 2000? answer : b. 80.9 years this one has to be calculated by using geometric series, since the formula is \"1 + ( d ) ^ n. so b ^ n = 1 + ( d ) ( n ). ( b ) ^ 10 = ( 1 + ( d / 10 ) ) ^ 10. 80.9 = ( 1 + (.29 / 10 ) ^ 10 x 10 ). 1 + (.28 / 10 ) is about 0.876 which is greater than 1, hence b = 80.9 answer : e.4869\nOutput: \"since the question is about population growth, we can assume the birthrate and the deathrate as constant which is true for the last decade. the population will be a ( r ) + b ( d ). in fact, d and r have the same unit of measure and we can multiply d and r ( with each other) without affecting the result, so d = 443 and r = 578 which results in a", "answer": "A: gain weight"}

{"idx": 90, "text": "Group B : symphony\n\n### Sample output\n\nThe following examples are extracted from the official PCE Cement Solutions website:\n\nGiven the following table, complete the chart indicating how much cement is needed to complete the various floors of a four-story building (all measurements in cubic meters):\n\nIn an effort to reduce costs, the carpenter in the above example will cut down the number of cement bags (from 12 down to 8) to ensure that his floor is at least 40 square meters. He can also reduce his usage by one bag if his measurements allow him to use four cements bags. It can also be deduced that if his measurements are at most 38, he will need a 12th bag. How do we know the numbers in the chart above are valid?\n\nThe answer depends on the given information. Since the contractor did not give the total number of bags required, we can use a trick. Let the total number of units of concrete required be k. Then in the first case, he added up the first four floors. 7 + 8 = 2, so 7 is the total number of first floor units. Since the sum of the four floors is k, 7 + 8 can be considered a constant, so he must know that number and he can subtract it from 4 2 = 1. Since 4 = 2 + 2, the numbers 2 and 3 are not in his range of bags.\n\nThe same process can be used to determine that k and all of the bags must be less than 4, making the second row invalid; any combination of floor sizes yields a number less than the minimum 2.\n\n## Variants\n\n### Precast concrete\n\nIn another application of the game, Precast Concrete, players are given a diagram of a precast wall in order to complete the wall with a specified design. A board game, Precast Solutions: Concrete Forms, was developed by Dwight Johnson.

A bassoon is a baritone (low-range) woodwind instrument which is played in orchestra and other big musical groups, often playing in groups of 2-10. A symphony orchestra would not typically feature just one instrument. Orchestras are large groups (conducted by a conductor) which typically feature 12/13 pieces, and a concert band is a smaller group (marching band, which are typically smaller marching bands featuring from 20-200 people. Bands are not conducted by a conductor and play primarily for marching, football / soccer / field hockey bands, or some concert. They are not known to have 1 person playing. C: A symphony is an entire group of musicians playing music. There are typically many instruments like trumpets, woodwind instruments, French horns, violins, violas, cellos, clarinets, etc. Often there will be 1 person playing something like a trombone (and usually more than one person playing a percussion instrument) but it would be very unlikely that there would just be one single person playing a low-range woodwind (bassoon), which is typically only played with a group (like a bassoon duet or trio).

(Enter your answer as the same as part A rounded to 2 decimal place For example, if the intersection is exactly 1.245, answer.5.)\n\nAnswer:Part A: I made the following model using a Poisson distribution with 1. So P(V) = 1 -.001(1.05)^0.1\nwhich simplifies to.0042 which is (5-2)%\n\nPart B:I plugged the exact probabilities into a conditional probability calculator.

The intersection should also be included, otherwise you can calculate using the probability that either someone will be in the street and/or the light will be on so the intersection should be the center of the intersection.

Regular expressions are not a general solution to parsing or other types of language or markup. Using a regular expression is the wrong way to parse HTML, which is the most common markup language in these examples. It is the wrong way to extract and process the data contained in an RSS feed that contains regular syntax elements. It is the wrong choice to parse or process anything. In the few instances where regex is appropriate, it is usually as an expression with a single goal, like replacing a series of characters with a single character that it matches.\n\nComment: Also, if it happens to involve a regular expression, it needs to be surrounded by delimiters to indicate where the expression's scope ends. You can't just write `12 + 21` and expect that to become `1221`. It is either `12 + 1` or `12 + 3`.\n\nComment: @CarySwoveland, thank you for your comment and insight, I thought of using regular expressions but wasn't satisfied with the results and also was advised not to use regex by someone. I will have a better understanding as I learn more. You are completely correct in your comment, thank you.\n\nComment: So how should code like this look?\n\nComment: @Joe, I am still learning code, when I find the correct syntax, I'll correct my question.\n\nAnswer: You cannot create a loop with a variable that was created from outside the loop, because the variable doesn't exist yet (it is only created inside the loop).", "answer": "B: gaining knowledge"}

{"idx": 325, "text": "The correct answer is E. 3. You were given incorrect response choices for this question:  A: dreaming does not help someone be more alert; the person will most likely not be able to wake up or will feel less alert.  B: thinking critically requires focus, however, if a person is sleepy they will not be able to focus.  C: walking across the street is not likely to make someone more alert.  D: Drinking coffee is a well-known solution for improving alertness. A human consumes coffee to jump start alertness so that they can continue to be productive throughout the day. The person will gain alertness from the caffeine content of the coffee. Caffeine does not work on everyone, and if the coffee wakes you up then makes you sleepy, you can experience an \"energy crash\" as the caffeine affects your blood sugar.  E: driving a car involves too much focus on the road. If a person is driving while sleepy they should pull over as soon as possible.

E: Her odds if she bets $100 per hand.\nOutput: Choices:  A  The odds that she wins if she plays 110 games of 25 with the crushes: If you bet $100 on each hand and win, you double your money once with each hand you win. Your chance of winning is 100/110 * 100/ 110 * 50/ 51. You can quickly calculate a better answer from the chance you win each time ( 50/51 ) times the money you gain ( 100/51 ) = 100/25. Your chance of winning the complete $5500 is 100 * 5500 * 1/ 25 = 22000 / 25 = 880.

{"idx": 341, "text": "Solution A: A B: F C: C D: F E: B  Note: 'giant hole' and 'hole' are not synonyms, despite the fact that their semantic similarity is 86% (it's only 79% for their co-reference ability in written language). However, this pair is used in the general vocabulary of English, so I assume that the user intended the word 'hole'. 'Giant' in the prompt is not necessarily an adjective. If it were an adjective, it would be impossible to use it with the preposition 'in'. If the prompt were written: 'Sam found a giant hole (or 'giant thing' or 'big thing') in the _____________ ____?', then it would not be inappropriate to use adverbial modifiers (ex: 'in the flat' or 'in the desert'). The word 'gorge' is used to describe a natural cut through a mountain, or a deep and narrow valley. Such use of the word 'gorge' does not mean that a 'gorge' could not be called a 'hole' in speech, as these word meanings are not mutually exclusive. 'Cliff' is a word that can be used to describe a natural feature near or at the edge of an elevated object, such as a mountain or cliff. A cliff is usually associated with steep slopes that are formed due to erosion over many years from the water eroding the base of the cliff.

{"idx": 421, "text": "A) Let Blood\n\n![](/assets/image1.jpg)\n\nAnswer: A) Let Blood : Let's say Doctor Joe has a patient named Bob who has heart problem. Doct Joe needs to give Bob a surgery so that Bob doesn't die but with today's technology it is a bit hard to do that. So what does Joe do? He gives Bob a blood transplant, what does that mean? Well, let's go back to my point above where Doctor Joe needs to give Bob heart treatment. What does he do? He operates on Bob's heart of course. But then it gets to the point where it is pretty hard to do that (sorry, I'm not a surgeon myself). So what do they do? They study medicine so that they don't die doing surgery and eventually develop other technologies such as computers, pacemakers, vaccines, robots, blood transfusions, etc. to aid the doctors, nurses, and patients.\n\nSo after studying medicine over some time, they come to realize that hey! We can transfuse blood because blood, after all, is the life source of a person.  That's how it all evolves. And because Bob is having a heart problem it is going to take him forever to heal. And with the heart problem, let's not mention the blood problem because he is not doing as well as other people do.\n\nWhen Doctor Joe was first born, there wasn't really that much of blood transfusion there. People went to the doctor once they see that something is wrong and if the doctor didn't like what is happening they'll take out his heart and replace it with another person's one. When it comes down to it, Bob will be dead because he might not find a good heart after all to transplant.\n\nWhen Bob is at the hospital and Bob's heart started to get pretty sick Doctor Joe comes in and he removes Bob's heart and take out his replacement. This would make Doctor Joe a successful doctor and a successful heart transplanner.\n\nWhen it all comes together. Bob just simply had a heart problem. Doctor Joe removed Bob's heart and put in his replacement. That way a person like Bob can live a normal life.\n\nEssentially Doctor Joe is an old time doctor who gives heart replacement.", "answer": "E: let blood"}

{"idx": 463, "text": "\"A rosebush belongs where it can thrive, so it has to be placed and nurtured in the proper places to keep it healthy. If you do not have any large pots for the rosebush to grow in, then the best places for it to be planted are flower gardens and formal gardens. Flowers should only be planted in gardens where it's expected for them to grow, like a flower garden or a home garden. The only other place to plant a rosebush is in a formal garden where flowers and bushes grow next to one another. There are various types of formal gardens, so the only formal gardens in which rosebushes would be planted is a cottage, French, or herb garden.\"\nSo the final answer should be c\n\nSolution:  A rosebush belongs where the soil is fertile and where it is warm enough. It typically does not do well if it is planted outside with other plants, where it will be exposed to extreme temperatures and humidity. A rosebush thrives in a warm and sunny climate, so it does not usually grow anywhere below the 30\u2019s. Because of extreme winters, rosebushes can be hardy only in warm places, which makes growing one in cold climates a hassle. For instance, most roses thrive well in California, a warm and sunny climates. However, in Colorado, which is often extremely cold and windy, rosebushes may not survive the harsh winter. One of the benefits of growing roses is being able to keep them indoors during extreme winters. However, not all rose bushes are designed to be inside. If you are looking for a rose bush that does well indoors, consider buying African or Chinese roses. Because most rosebushes prefer warm climates, any container you plant it in must be placed in an area where the temperature is at least 40\u2019F. During the winter, rosebushes must be kept below 45F, as a sudden drop in temperature can cause frost and kill the rose bush. If you do not live in a warm climate, do not worry. You can still grow a rose bush in your house. To help your rosebush do well inside, you can bring it in during cold spells, such as the winter. Before you", "answer": "E: formal garden"}

{"idx": 576, "text": "solution: Illegal things: Remembering Cards Help counting Dealing Remembering means: that you are holding on to cards that are dealt during the game so that you can use them as a reference to figure out other cards in your hand. That is clearly not allowed. That kind of remembering happens because you are holding on to your cards too long and you do not leave them on the playing surface quickly. You should be keeping your cards flat on the surface until it's your turn to play. Help counting is another big no-no. If you look around the room and see which cards people are holding and which cards they play, then you probably know how to cheat. Some people are counting cards so that they come prepared with the right cards to play. It's kind of like what you do when you are playing poker; you do it because that is just what you do; and it's not against the rules. However, in this case the casino is saying that you are doing it with some intent to manipulate the game. They would like you to leave your calculator at home and not go into the bathroom with a computer while you take your piss. As with the previous example, this answer is not technically wrong. It is simply the one most likely to get you barred from the premises. This also brings up something that you may not have thought about before - you can't count your money, either. Casinos allow you to count your money before you leave, but they don't like you to make out that you are doing anything else. If you are counting your money and happen to see cards and make notes as you do, then you are probably helping to count. Dealing can also be illegal. I don't think that it's actually illegal to be the dealer without permission, but you may get arrested if you are found trying to do that. At least that's what my cousin is going to tell me if he gets arrested for anything. If you are caught dealing, then that is the worst possible offense; they are trying to stop you from putting money onto, or into, the table. That is, they are trying to make sure that there is no manipulation of the game that is taking place.\nSo the final answer, the only correct answer is D! = Dealing\n\n### Summary\n\nAs you can see, Bubble has the ability to solve pretty much any quiz that you", "answer": "C: count"}

{"idx": 578, "text": "A\nSo the final answer in option C is A. I have answered the question incorrectly, because we found the following pattern in answering the previous question, the only location to find trash cans is at a park or a motel.\nSo we found that motels are best at finding a trash can because they are a better place and have more trash cans. But this incorrect answer comes because, we don't need to answer correctly to be able to get a percentage correct. The program only looks at if you answered correctly, so if we say yes then we got it right no matter where we put the can and hence any position we put the trash can in is the correct answer and if we put it in an incorrect location then we got it wrong, so hence we would have all the other correct answers as incorrect.\n\n## Solution\n\nThere are some points which need clarification :\n\nThe most difficult concept for understanding how this program works is that all the answer choices are **valid**, not just the correct one. That means that, as the instructions say, \"answer b\" would be the correct answer if you answered \"a\", as these answers will have the same percentage of correct answers. It seems a very strange way of making things clear, but it does.\n\nAnother interesting concept is that you **don't** need to answer things correctly to get a percentage right, but the instructions are written in a way that requires that you make a guess, so they seem to only accept the most obvious answer choice. That doesn't actually mean they are accepting mistakes, just that this program has only been written to test that people answer questions correctly (not whether people answer questions correctly *at all*).\n\nThere are some further points :\n\n- If you try to answer questions which you believe you know are wrong, then you will get a percentage of answering things correctly.\n- It looks like the percentage is being calculated only for every other question. If you put a can in the correct location, then it will show the correct answer, and if you put it in the wrong location then it will show any other correct answer. That means, since the only way to get a wrong answer is if the answer is wrong, so you can only answer each question correctly once.\n\nIt is surprising because you have the impression that the computer thinks you are wrong if you say where the trash can is not at all, or puts it in an improper", "answer": "C: corner"}

{"idx": 596, "text": "Solution:  There are many types of speech therapists, and therapists who provide different classes of speech assistance can choose speech therapy as their career. Speech therapies can be divided into many areas, which include : \u2022  Aphasia : Aphasia speech therapy is a treatment to support people who have problems with comprehension and speech production due to stroke. This area of speech therapy is concerned with the areas of speech, hearing and language. Aphasia can be called a disorder rather than a disease, because it does not affect vital organs in the body. The areas involved in aphasia are : speech, thinking, remembering and reading, it also includes comprehension and speech production abilities. \u2022  Articulation : Articulation is the process of identifying a word or phrase, express it and clearly pronounce it with the help of the right muscles to avoid errors and the right vocal tone for understanding. Articulation disorders are very common in children, but this problem does not always lead to a speech disorder. According to research, in children with expressive language disorder, expressive and articulatory speech skills are almost same, but they speak with different intonation. \u2022  Fluency : It means that the speech is done smoothly and without pauses, while people who do not have a fluency disorder can speak without interruptions. \u2022  Language : This area of speech therapies is concerned with communication skills and knowledge of vocabulary, grammar, syntax and speech. This includes speech disorders, such as stuttering, and dyslexia. \u2022  Vestibular, Ocular and Swallowing : To keep balance and body in motion, vestibular functions and ocular-motor systems are two important parts of the central nervous system. These two systems of muscles are very important for keeping a person safe when they ride a bike, walk and run. Speech pathology therapists can offer expert assistance for vestibular function disorder and dysfunction. Vocal disorders such as hoarseness, and disorders involving swallowing, such as dysphagia, are also included in this area. The swallowing muscles are very important due to the fact that most of the energy comes to the body from the food we eat.

In older English \"uncivil\" referred to behavior appropriate to a court of law. In this passage, \"civil disobiddience\" refers to the refusal to obey certain laws. \"civil disobeedience\" was coined in the mid-19th centruy by English reformers as a way to define a social movement that protested certain laws as unjust. \"Uncivil\", therefore, does not suggest unruliness or lack of a code of conduct, but rather a social action that is against a specific law.\"\nSo the final answer has to be E, because both use the same word with different", "answer": "B: schoolroom"}

You must be very familiar with the different roles of a farm and their operations.\nSince the compassionate animal advocate asked this heifer whether she would like to reside in the grocery store as her last days. But not in the slaughterhouse. The reason for this is slaughterhouses and grocery stores are on very opposite ends. The slaughterhouse is where the animals go when they will be sold for cuts of meat, while the grocery store is where the animals are purchased and where products are bought. The heifer obviously did not want to die in the slaughtering place. So, he/she chose the grocery store where she would live out the rest of her days instead. The advocate of the animal does this to spare her from that horrible fate. In short, she was rescued from her fate.\nSo the final answer in this question is C: grocory store.\n\nInput:What's the probability of two or more horses leaving the stable together. The probability of 2 or more horses leaving the stables together is 1000000/1000, i.e. 1%. So the final answer in this questions is 99/100.\nHorses like the one depicted here are often kept in stables because they run loose or are left in paddocks if they are not being ridden or being trained. They are taken care by a professional horse groom. If the horse has no owner to it, then it is being given back to its prior owner. The horse groom takes care of it by providing it with food, fresh water, bedding, blankets during the colder and rainy seasons that it is exposed to, providing an equine veterinarian for checkup and the rest of its needs. There are a variety of ways in which the horses are shooed out from their stable into a pasture for some relaxation and exercises. It is called horseback horse grooming and when this is done horses have their needs. One way is to use a horse halter and lead rope to take up or down the horse from a stall to a paddock or to an outside pasture. And", "answer": "B: countryside"}

{"idx": 736, "text": "ANSWER E ;\n\"The earth along with 88 other planets make-up our solar system which revolves around the sun in the center of our galaxy, milky way galalxy. The milky way galalaxy is approximately 100 thousand light years wide which has a mass of 10 thousand billions Suns. The 749 planets in our galaxy have one thing in common - they orbit a star. Stars such as our sun generate light energy through either nuclear reactions like hydrogen burning or gravitational contraction through cooling of the core. This energy and matter is then ejected into space - forming solar winds which blow out from the star in a spherical shell moving up to more than 500 kms/sec. Over 99% of the stars we can see can be classified as main sequence stars, such as our sun. About 1% are red giants - giant stars with outer shells of hydrogen and helium gas which gradually burn out after generating energy for most of their 8 billion year life spans in the main sequence stage. Only 1% of the stars are young starless nebulae like Orion Nebulae; these are the stellar nurseries of all the stars in the galaxy.

What would a 5-grade get if he had the same percentage of the grades score for that school year?\nOutput: \"To solve this, first make a rough estimate by assuming that the percentages of score distribution is uniform. If this is the case, then 8 * 52 = 432 = 52 * 8. Now divide this by 52 to get an expected point. This is 8.3333 = 16. To be more exact, calculate the percentile by knowing the score of the 8-grade. In our case that would be 200 points. To calculate the percentile, take the percent number and multiply it by the number of grades. So, 200 * 0.08 = 16. This is the number of grade points a 5-grade must make to get an 8.\"\n\nInput: A family of 4 has 28.5 percent of all income for the year.

Now you need to convert that into a grade. you do this by dividing the number by the number of granges in 28.5 ( 28.5 ). so the number must be between 2 and 3.

{"idx": 813, "text": "Choice: A\nSo the final answer needs to be Choice A\n\n#### Answer A: When going to sleep what sound does a human make? The answer is Choice A.\n\nWhen going to sleep what sound (sense) are humans making? The answer is Choices A) \"When\" humans go to sleep they are not making a sound because when we are sleeping our eyes are closed and we do not make any noise. The word \"sound\" can be used as a noun or as a verb. That is it can have two meanings.\nThe question is \" When do humans make a sound (verb) going to sleep? \" or \" when in the process of sleeping do humans make a sound?\" The answer is that humans do not make a sound either verb meaning as explained above by making noise when going to sleep or when the sleeping process is in process.\nIn conclusion this question seems to be asking us the question \"When going to sleep does a human do sleep make sound or make snoring sound or making any vocal noise?\" A good response to this question would be, \"The question doesn't make sense.\"\n\n#### Answer B: When going to sleep is a human making a loss of consciousness? The answer is Choose C \"relaxation\".\n\nWhen going to (verb) sleep for this question (subject) are humans making a loss of conscious? There isn't a meaning to this question. We go to sleep not lose consciousness before we fall asleep. The English question asked is \"While going to sleep is a person losing conscious? \" The answer is that you don't while going to sleep for that verb we do not make a \"loss in conscious state.\"\n\nIf in this question we are making a new question then maybe it makes sense to the question \"While going to bed does some people make consciousness a loss?\" A good response would be \"The question doesn'to make sense.\"\n\nIn conclusion this question sounds very strange and doesn't make sense. The question asks us \"What do humans do while going to sleep, make a conscious loss or make consciousness a loss? There are two grammatical errors in the question. The correct verb tense of a noun is \"the sleeping\". The grammar of the question needs to be fixed. By using the English phrase \"go to sleep\" it can't have a verb that makes a loss of consciousness while going to", "answer": "C: snoring"}

The number 42, for example, is a natural number, but not an integer.[1] A natural number is also called a whole number.[nb 1] The natural numbers are the subject of natural number theory, which is concerned with counting and enumerating. The natural numbers are used in the study of mathematics, number theory, computation, computer programming, and computer science, where they represent the integers. Natural numbers can be represented by the Roman numerals I, II, III, IV, V,..., XXX, LX, LXX, and C. Some modern languages use lowercase letters to represent smaller natural numbers (e.g., i for 1, ii for 2, and so on). Some languages represent them in a range of styles, e.g. Chinese, Japanese, and Korean use a numerical character system to indicate numbers.[nb 2] Choice: A: prime numberB: even C: odd D: multiple of 4\nOutput:answer(D): multiple of 4\nSo the final answer will be D\n\nInput:The least odd prime number = 11 ------------------------------------------------------- Choice: A: 5248889427215603301059746220010471311119, B: 402405383378429947, C: 441995497983200496, D: 40256762802771765575608922390198292818143460\nOutput", "answer": "D: doors and windows"}

{"idx": 933, "text": "\"C. the object in question is a ping pong ( table tennis ) ball. a ball's gravity is small enough that it can be held by a person using only a finger. however, one must pay attention to the force of gravity in doing so. the greater the mass of the body, the greater the force of gravity exerted on it. if a person is standing, there is no additional force of gravity on the body as a result of holding the ball. however, if the body is moving, it experiences an additional force of gravity depending on both its velocity and its mass. this can sometimes result in the person being repelled or pushed back in a way that reduces the person's force and increases his velocity or increases the velocity of other objects. as we can see, being able to hold onto an object is primarily a matter of the size of the force of gravity excerpts on the body. while gravity is stronger on a smaller object, it is easier to hold onto the object. the force of gravity is proportional to the weight of the object. the object's weight is inversely proportional to its acceleration. if the ball is dropped from a height, the resultant force of gravity will be more than enough to support the finger and prevent the finger from being exerted away from the object. this is due to the mass of the ball remaining constant over the duration of the drop. by the time the ball has fallen a distance of'2 r'from the string, the force of gravity acting on it is equal to the force of gravity acting downward from its point of impact. as a result, the force of gravity on the ball due to gravity is equivalent to the force of gravity on it due to gravity acting in the exact same direction as the force of gravity on earth. when we hold a ball, gravity's force is not acting in this direction. it is acting in the opposite direction of the force we are applying to the ball. this allows us to keep the ball from slipping through our fingers. the force is proportional to our weight plus the mass of the object we are holding. \"\nSo the final answer C\n\nInput: A can produce a certain quantity of a product in a day.

There's no way we can make up that budget shortfall in 2014, since we have an operating surplus this year, so the deficit next year will probably be slightly larger than 1.2%.\n\nBased on the information provided, I calculate a deficit of 1.9% of the GDP for 2015, a deficit of -0.3% of the GDP in 2016, and a deficit of roughly 1% of the GDP going forward.\n\nTo put the deficit into perspective, it accounts for roughly 5.25% of our provincial tax revenues.

The healthcare cost per capita in that year was $2,164.\n\nOut of a total of $1,506 of average tax payments, a large portion of that will be benefits such as child tax credits and other assistance programs that average about $1,000.

The largest possible number of cakes is ____\nOutput: 1) Solve for the total amount of ingredients needed: ounces of flours *3 = pounds of sugar. 2) Then let the three ounces of flors be 'x', the two ounces of shortenings be 'y', the one pound and ounce be z. 3) Now we know that the three cakes will divide between the three ounces flour, so, 3x/x = 3 = > 3x = x. Also, each ounce of shortening can only make two cakes, so, 2y/y = 2 = > y. Lastly, the one cup of sugar will correspond to the one pound and an ounce, so, z/z' = 1 = > z = z'. We know then that, x=3z+2y. In addition, 1=x / (x+z). The only answer that makes sense is B (28). You subtracted the total of the two recipes; the recipe that has three cakes and one cup of sugar can't have any more cakes after three of them are made. You also added the total of the two cakes with the correct answer of 28 since the two recipes with one pound of sugar only produce 28 cakes tops. Solve for the two variables that are missing.

{"idx": 9, "text": "A handkerchief is usually what is called a hank to distinguish from a hanky, a cloth handkerchief used to wipe the nose. The handkerchief was the original receptacle, and the handkerchief's purpose as a way of wiping the nose with one's hands was the original \"pocket\", the hanky's use in general wiping. But in Britain, the handkerchief has largely been replaced by kleenex tissues. In many English- speaking countries, the handkerchie is sometimes called a hank or a hanky. it is a misconception to say that the French phrase to pull out one's hanky for a tissue was coined as an analogy to \"pully out one's sword\" for armed combat, as in the first part of a duel, when a second draws aside one's coat so that the duelist can see his opponent; for the analogy would be false even if a handkerchief were used for a sword. A hanky refers to hank, the cloth handkerchief usually used to wipe the face and/or the nose, and when there is a hanky hanging out of someone's pocket, this person is usually sick. A hanky means exactly only a handkerchief ( but \"hanky\" for a handkerchief is rare in the United States ).

{"idx": 32, "text": "Start at Home Depot and work your way out to the suburbs. If you start downtown or at the mall, the suburbs will be too expensive for your budget.\nHere we are defining gated areas as neighborhoods that are enclosed such that you have to use a key to get in and out. The subdivision next to you might not require a fence but you still have to cross a median to get in and out of your community. City parks require a fence as do most suburban apartment complexes.\nIf you are looking for a house that is cheaper than a gated area, then it's more likely that it will not be gated or it will be a gate that's so small that it requires no house key to get in/out. A gated community with two houses in it on a dead-end street is not gated enough. On the other hand, a neighborhood with hundreds of houses is completely gated.\nA neighborhood is a section of a town. Within that area there are generally 4 types of neighborhoods: 1. Subdivision 2. Enclaves 3. Suburb 4. Town The subdivision is where you can find the suburb, which in turn is where you will find the enclaves.\n\nThe gated suburb is found within suburbs, so any area outside of a subdivision or urban area is not gated enough to be considered as a safe haven from other elements.\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, a house within downtown San Diego would still not be gated enough to keep out criminals because there are more than 100,000 other people living in the same building. If a building was gated-off from its surroundings, it would be considered a city. If your house were on a dead-end section of the street with no other buildings to provide an exit for any passerby, then your house is in the suburbs. So if your street dead-ends then you're still within downtown or the mall, in which case you're looking in the wrong place.\n\nThus, if you're looking for a safe place to live, go to a suburban area; if you prefer more people then go to a city.\n\nThis answer was written by an employee of Yelp Inc. and does not", "answer": "B: subdivision"}

(There are 9 positive prime divisors: 3, 9, 5, 5, 3, and 1.) The next candidate is 4 because it's bigger than 3 and it doesn't end in 9. This still can't happen though, because primes above 3 are still prime divisors. The only other possibility is to consider 2. Well, 9 is divisible by 2 and so is 3!

They could be at either a street corner or a fork.\n\nSo, any person at a street corner, at the exact center of the road and at a fork in the road will be hit by a car, giving them a 1/4 chance.\nPeople not at any of these locations don't need to worry about getting hit and could stand at the nearest edge of the intersection at any chosen position.\n\nTherefore, the person standing at the edge of the road has a 3/4 chance of not getting hit, whereas a person at the exact center has a 1/4th chance.\nAlso, the person who can stand at the street corner has a higher chance since they can go in 4 directions, while the person at a fork in the intersection can go in 2 directions (forward/backward).\n\nHence, the person not at a street corner or the one at the fork has a 1/2 chance of avoiding getting hit.\n\nThe probability is, for a person standing in the crossing with either the street corner or the intersection. The person who stands in street corner has 4/4th chance of not being hit, while being at a fork has 2/2 chance of not getting hit.\n\nFinal answer: Choice (D)\n\n---\n\n### Instruction:Answer the next multiple choice question.\nInput: A man starts walking towards south on a straight road. A car approaching him speeds up. The car overtakes the man by 50 m after covering a distance of 100 m.\n\nThe man walks at a speed of 5 km/hr and the car overtakes him at a speed of 10 km/hr.\n\nIf the car overtakes the moving man 6 times in one hour, how fast does the car move?\n\na)  50 km/hr\nb) 61 km/", "answer": "C: street corner"}

Each round shadow is 9 in wide, and the separation between two shadows never changes. What color is the light inside that is not visible from the outside?\nOutput: As per you question, if we are looking at the picture on the right, we notice that the 2 round shadows against the wall, the separation between them (as we can observe) does not change. Assuming that they are 9 in wide, what changes and is always the same is the area of the 2 round shaped spots (hollow in the middle) formed by the 2 round shapers, which is 81 each. As the box travels and the sliding door slides to the right, the light moves to the lower right corner of the box, and the 2 round shaded spots move to the right in 81, 282, 563, 844, and so on.  The 2 shaded spots always move to the right on the table by 81 for each inch the table travel, so, if the 2 shaded spotted move to the right by 81 inches as the table moves, then the table must move by 40 inches as for each inch one of the shaded spotted move, they should equal the other shaded spot by 40 inches.

{"idx": 319, "text": "The man is on the beach to think about things,he would not do A, B or C as those things involve doing things for other people which he clearly is not doing.\nHis choice of a beach is perhaps because it suits the situation, but the actual choice is to think about things. A is a bad idea as sun himself would require physical movement and this would be not very good for someone lying on the beach.\nB is an even worse idea as it will probably involve going somewhere which would also be not very good for sun himself.\nD is a weird choice, as love is an emotion and you can only express love by talking or writing, whereas his choice of the beach was, from the question, to think about things, or at least not to do anything. E, though, is probably the best choice, given his situation.\nSo the final answer in this case is E.\n\nInput:Another option is \"to meet girls\".

The correct answer is E if he is a man, and C if he is a woman, which leads to a different interpretation of the question.\nSo the final alternative answer for question 5\n\nInput:The reason why he does the above actions and that is mentioned in the second half of the question is that he is bored in this situation, as he doesn't know what to do but still isn't willing to get up. Therefore, he makes himself bored, and he is able to think about things. Therefore the reason \"to think about things\" mentioned in the alternative answers is incorrect.\nSo the correct answer for question no 2 is A and final answer for question no 1 is D\n\nInput:A", "answer": "A: sun himself"}

Choices: A:15 pizzas B:6 pizzes C:9 pizzes D:5 pizzas E:12 pizzas\nOutput: The answer given is \"A\", which says 15 pizzas. That seems wrong. It's clear to me that there are two ways the seating at the tables will be at times, in equal numbers. There'll be six people plus no people, so six times three people plus five times four people. (I added three plus five because the pizza restaurant is closed or is not selling at all times it is open; or the last table at 11 p.m. may have fewer than six diners.) That is, 6X3+5X4=45.

What is a certain probability that the apartments that two residents chose will be separated by the same floor? (the residents draw numbers at random. The answer should not depend on the method the two residents use to draw their numbers. Assume that at least one pair of residents will pick two apartments from the same floor, and at most one pair will pick apartments from the same wall) Choices:  A. 1 / 2 * 1 / ( 2 ^ k ) B. 1 / (3 * 2) C. 1 / (4^k) D. 1 / (k^2) E. 1 / (6*k)\nOutput: \"answer provided by stanford 10 answer: d. solution: consider the k apartment. each apartment is selected in n draws. probability that each pair of apartment will be from the same wall is n / ( total apartment - 1 ). if we select a pair, one apartment needs to be separate from each wall. therefore, it needs to choose from all three apartments. there are ( 3 * 2 ) * ( 4 ^ ( k - 2 ) ) apartment to select from 2 is because there must be a pair where each apartment is from each wall. * ( 4 ^ n ) is because there must be one apartment be on each wall, and one be separated from each wall, so the apartment must be in the corner. so, the answer is ( 2 * ( 4 / 2 ) + n ) / ( 3 * 5 + n ) = 6 / ( 3 * k ^2 + n ) = 1 / 3 ^ ( k - 1 ) * k ^ 2 + 1 / (k ^ 2 + 3 * k -1 * n )  = 1 / ( 4 * k - 1 * n + 1 ) - 1 / (k - 1 + n ) = 3 / ( 4 * ( k - n ) ) and so the answer is d.\nSolution provied by Stanford 201", "answer": "B: closed"}

Then square root the width and the height squared and subtract each from the previous value.  It will be a negative number as the height and width have the max number. Subtract the numbers and we get the answer. Answer: 37.  The dimensions of the box are width and height which cannot be written as two numbers as the box is 2D. I don't know how they are asking us to do it but I think it is impossible. Let me know if anyone knows.\"\nThat's one step too far, i was just solving the width.\nThe max number of cars that will fit in is the width of the box, as the width is the number of cars that is equal to the width of the box. This is because the width of the box is equal to the number of cars that fits in the box or the width of the square rectangle, which means it is equal to the width, which is equal to the number cars, which is equal to width, which is equal of the box.\nSo the final answer will be The dimensions of the box is height and width. and that will be 37.", "answer": "E: class room"}

The cost of driving from any city to any other is C$ 12.5. Assuming each driver pays the same rate per kilometer, what is the average rate per kilometer that each driver has to pay for the 3400-kilometer drive? Assume that each driver makes the same number of trips.\nOutput:Solution - 01 The total cost of the trip that the average driver takes is $ 35A ( $ 980 + 3.9C ). The average speed of the driver will depend on the number of trips he makes. The trip is 3400 kilometers long. The average trip time is 783 / 34 = 22.9 minutes, therefore, the rate of the average driver with 1 trip is C$ 170.7 / 783 = 0.2174C $ / minute. 35A / 0.2154c $ / minute, therefore 150.35A / C $ / trip, with an average of 64A / 17A = 3.9 C $ / 5.74 C $ / trip - 02 The average cost per kilometer is C$ 4.264 (C$ 12.7075A / 3000km). A driver making 10 trips for the same amount of money as the previous case will pay A C$ 0.4832 for each km, with an average of A C$ 02.6686 for every km\nSo the final answer will in A\n\nInput:\"A man on a  car was  driven to  the morg  for a disinfection ( a process done after  the death to the body ), what is the distance  to the morg  from the  house of  the dead? \"\nOutput: 100 Km\nSo the final answer should be 100\n\nInput:The  morg was  far from  the house  of  the dead which was  2 Km away from the  Hospital A, and the distance  from the  house to  the hospital", "answer": "E: freeway"}

A second truck loaded with 810 pounds of wheat is leaving the wheat mill. A third truck loaded with 390 pounds of flour and 810 pounds is loaded with barley is leaving the flour mill. These vehicles arrive at the same crossroads at the same moment. Each truck arrives and leaves at the same instant. Each vehicle travels in a straight line. When the traffic lights change from red to green, the first 2 trucks may cross the intersection at the same time and travel in same direction. But the third truck can never cross the intersection. If the trucks were to reach their destinations without accidents, why was the third truck allowed to leave the flour mill?\nSolution by MJ 2013\nIt is never a good idea for two heavy trucks to meet even if there is sufficient road. If they were to meet, their combined weight could make it impossible for the weaker vehicle to move. They would also likely block traffic, including cars, buses, semis, and delivery to smaller trucks who would be stuck on the side of the road waiting to get past because nowhere else could the big trucks go.

{"idx": 727, "text": "Choices: A: turn away B:\"Sailing is also human powered. I guess if we use the 1 answer we will get the same \"Turn away\" Sailing doesn't use an engine to turn a boat. It uses the wind to push them for example the \"Bermuda rigged\" yacht, which uses an oar to give it direction. Rowing doesn't always do the same work as a sailing boat it is also the case of a motor boat with a engine. So in my opinion, turn away doesn't seem right, but B looks pretty much right. C: is also possible because to sleep the sailor takes its place under the sail, and E: doesn't seem right because it's not the same as the movement of wind to make a boat move, it's the same as A but less accurate and more slow. (But the question is \"which type of water transportation\"). In my opinion it's A I would say C because it's a sailing boat and it doesn't have to sleep under its sail, which is a movement of wind.

The number of caves found by survey is 523.\nThere is a 1.2% chance that that survey was not comprehensive and there could have been another,\ncompletely unaccounted, 6 caves.\nAlso there is a 1.58% chance that some of the already found caves could be duplicates. (The two\ncaves are deemed to be duplicates if a) they are located within a 75m radius from each other, and b) the cave\ndiameter/height varies by less than 20%).\n2. 480 caves were randomly selected from the surveys and found to be totally different from all the other\ncaves. Also, for 136 caves only photographs of the entrances were taken, and were not found to be\nsimilar to any previously found caves.\n3. It is 18% likely, or one in 5, that the cave numbering was a random numbering assigned at the end of\nthe first cave survey of 315 caves, and they were never rechecked. (The first cave study involved\nsearching in 450 square kilometers, 52% more than subsequent studies.)\n\n4. We assumed that, 200 kilometers from any cave, another could be found. If this ratio held,\nthere were 4855 possible additional caves.\n5. To find at least one more cave, we simply assumed in our simulations that, when searching in an\narbitrary square kilometer, 69% of the squares would prove to be devoid of caves. This would not be\nunreasonable because a 50 kilometer radius would contain only 39 caves.\n6. To find another cave in a given square kilometer, we just assumed that the number of additional squares\nmust be less than the ratio of the original area. Then, the probability of finding another cave became\nless as areas grew smaller.\n\nSo the final answer D", "answer": "C: wyoming"}

The problem with doing this approach of finding the actual length is that it will take a long time to figure out the distance to 3 significant figures. ( 1 + 4 + 9 ) = 1402.

We will need the x-coordinate that corresponds to'45'. Let's say the x-coordinate of '45', which is 45 units, is 954,5. We would use 9.45 as our x-coordinate, and we now find the y-coordinate, which is the distance, ( 1402 / 9.45 = 149.3222222444", "answer": "E: motel"}

He didn\u2019t have anything to put it on and he hadn\u2019t learned the skill of balance either.  It would be a feat to get the cup to balance itself.\n\nNow, when I was younger I was in gymnastics.  That\u2019s what I did instead of learning how to ride a bike, because I couldn\u2019t.  (Lucky for me my parents were both gymnasts.)  In gymnastics I had a very good teacher who told me I had very good balance.  He would set up a number of odd obstacles.  He would have balances, a ball, a small table, and of course a very heavy pair of men\u2019s shoes.  I wasn\u2019t supposed to do any of the \u201cwork\u201d out of fear they\u2019d fall on me.  I don\u2019t think they were aware that if you gave me the shoes to stand on they really wouldn\u2019t fall.  I also learned how to roll a quarter from one hand to the next with the palm flat on a coffee table without looking.  (If you\u2019re young enough you can do it too, try it out.)\n\nLearning balance is actually really easy.  It all depends on keeping your feet flat on the ground.  Most people have trouble not kicking their feet.  Instead of raising your toes to walk, raise the ball of your feet, or the heel of your feet.  You can probably even walk bare foot across your living room and not trip if you do that.  It\u2019s also very easy to fall over with your back straight.  Put your shoulders back and relax.  It will let your legs and feet balance.\n\nAnd about the cup, it wouldn\u2019t take that much force, so much will get the cup over without tipping it.  You could try holding the ball of two fingers like you were holding a pinky or thumb, and then balance it.  You would have to balance it with your whole arm and wrist, but it would probably be easier than using the fingers.  Of course the more in balance you are the less force you will need.

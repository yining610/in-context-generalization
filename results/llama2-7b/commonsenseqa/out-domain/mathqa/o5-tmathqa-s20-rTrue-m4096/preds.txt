Choices:  A: shirt pocket B: calligrapher's hand C: inkwell D: desk drawer E: blotter<n>Output:		A handkerchief is usually what is called a hank to distinguish from a hanky, a cloth handkerchief used to wipe the nose. The handkerchief was the original receptacle, and the handkerchief's purpose as a way of wiping the nose with one's hands was the original "pocket", the hanky's use in general wiping. But in Britain, the handkerchief has largely been replaced by kleenex tissues. In many English- speaking countries, the handkerchie is sometimes called a hank or a hanky. it is a misconception to say that the French phrase to pull out one's hanky for a tissue was coined as an analogy to "pully out one's sword" for armed combat, as in the first part of a duel, when a second draws aside one's coat so that the duelist can see his opponent; for the analogy would be false even if a handkerchief were used for a sword. A hanky refers to hank, the cloth handkerchief usually used to wipe the face and/or the nose, and when there is a hanky hanging out of someone's pocket, this person is usually sick. A hanky means exactly only a handkerchief ( but "hanky" for a handkerchief is rare in the United States ). As nouns the difference between handkerchief and hanky is that a handkerchief  is hankerchief  while a hanky is cloth handkerchief  typically a square cloth, although the usage has diverged.

If A was chosen: there's no mention of "barbeque grill" anywhere throughout it(A). If B was chosen: It says "you can cook everything on a grill".(B) If C was chosen: "Use a smaller grill, like a grill pan or an indoor grill, which does not require wood. Smoking on a grill isn't always an option." (I didn't fully understand this sentence.) If D was chosen: "Smoking on a grill.  Cooking indoors, which isn't the same as making a smoker. A grill is an outdoor appliance. If you grill in an indoor space, such as your kitchen, you're smoking." I'm sure this choice doesn't say outright "barbeque", but it is mentioned that it's a method of grilling. If E was chosen: "Indeed, many people make barbecue in the house," But I'm not 100% sure whether or not it could be considered barbeque grilling.

Choices:  A: neighborhood B: subdivision C: city D: suburbs E: street<n>Output:		Start at Home Depot and work your way out to the suburbs. If you start downtown or at the mall, the suburbs will be too expensive for your budget.<n>Here we are defining gated areas as neighborhoods that are enclosed such that you have to use a key to get in and out. The subdivision next to you might not require a fence but you still have to cross a median to get in and out of your community. City parks require a fence as do most suburban apartment complexes.<n>If you are looking for a house that is cheaper than a gated area, then it's more likely that it will not be gated or it will be a gate that's so small that it requires no house key to get in/out. A gated community with two houses in it on a dead-end street is not gated enough. On the other hand, a neighborhood with hundreds of houses is completely gated.<n>A neighborhood is a section of a town. Within that area there are generally 4 types of neighborhoods: 1. Subdivision 2. Enclaves 3. Suburb 4. Town The subdivision is where you can find the suburb, which in turn is where you will find the enclaves.<n><n>The gated suburb is found within suburbs, so any area outside of a subdivision or urban area is not gated enough to be considered as a safe haven from other elements.<n>On the opposite end of the spectrum, a house within downtown San Diego would still not be gated enough to keep out criminals because there are more than 100,000 other people living in the same building. If a building was gated-off from its surroundings, it would be considered a city. If your house were on a dead-end section of the street with no other buildings to provide an exit for any passerby, then your house is in the suburbs. So if your street dead-ends then you're still within downtown or the mall, in which case you're looking in the wrong place.<n><n>Thus, if you're looking for a safe place to live, go to a suburban area; if you prefer more people then go to a city.<n><n>This answer was written by an employee of Yelp Inc. and does not

Choices:  A: looking good B: beauty C: tardiness D: handsomeness E: neatness<n>Output:		This problem will probably have a lot of people thinking that the answer is "handsome". But we cannot be positive about that as the man could also be portraying a bimbo. The best we can do is look at what the question is trying to avoid and therefore focus on the options from there. Firstly, the man "shave[s] [his] hair and get[s] a haircut". He also changes "his demeanor". This seems to indicate that he is trying to appear "put together" on the inside and outside. Therefore we can eliminate "looking good", "beauty", and "handsome", as we do not know anything about his appearance, and it is irrelevant. So we are left with "neatness", "tidiness", and "tidy". To eliminate, we simply ask the question of what does being "tidy" or "tidy" mean? "Tidy" means putting all things in their proper place while "tidy" means to put all things in their proper places and to not look jumbled or unkempt. Therefore we can eliminate all these and our answer is “tidy”.<n><n>So the final answer answer is c<n><n><n>Input: A coin is tossed 5 times what’s the probability of getting at least 3 tails?<n>output the total coins turned will be 5.<n>first  coin will be either head or tail,<n>so the probability if its head is p/2<n>so it probability will be p/2*p/2*p/4*p/4*1/2 this will give us 25/4<n><n>same coins are to be selected again and again,<n>if the above one comes out to be 25/4, then the second one will be 25/2^2 and so on it will always be 25 and 2^i.<n><n>for the above problem the total number of coins will be<n>25*2^5 which is 25*32<n><n>32 will always be greater than 12,<n>now lets check the probability for atleast 3 tails:<n><n>25*32/5<n>if the above number is greater than 12 that is if 32 is greater than 14 then its atleast 3 heads, else its not. for the above problem the

Can you explain why those are the first two primes?<n>Output: I assume "3 and 9" to mean the numbers we want to prove prime. The obvious approach to proving these are prime is to start with arbitrary integers and test to see if those primes. Well, 3 and 109 can't happen, because at most 9 times anything will not end in 9. (There are 9 positive prime divisors: 3, 9, 5, 5, 3, and 1.) The next candidate is 4 because it's bigger than 3 and it doesn't end in 9. This still can't happen though, because primes above 3 are still prime divisors. The only other possibility is to consider 2. Well, 9 is divisible by 2 and so is 3! We really ought to say that 3 can't be our next prime, and yet 7 can! Can you see the next prime is already 7?<n>So the final answer: the next prime could not by 3!<n><n>Input: What year of math

If a + b=9, then, a-b must be equal to the first of two numbers - as given. So, c-b = 3-5 = -2. Let a and b stand for 3 and 5, then, a = 3,b = 5, a+b = 9...(1) and a-b = -2 => a-b = a + 2 = 6 => a+2= 6 => a = 4(2) 1+2 = 3 (3) 2-1 = 1 => b-a = 1 => a-b=3-1 =>c+2-b = 3+2-5 => c+=0 => c = 3 (4) a-b = -1(5) So all we want to establish is that by adding 2 to b, we have one of the two numbers in the equation. To that end, let a = 4. (6) 4+2=

Because a refrigerator isn't meant to store many things that are dirty and could make a mess. A closet wouldn't work because you would lose sight of the goggles and get them mixed up with other clothing. A nightstand would not be good because of all of the dust flying around the room and it would break easily the second it hit the ground. A desk would be bad because of all of the paperwork that people like to throw on it and because of all of the extra stuff that people will bring that could mess it up. And finally the cabinet is the best place because it does not break easily, doesn’t have any dust, does't fly around and it looks pretty!<n>If you want to store them in a refrigerator you need to make sure that the goggles are in a container that makes it waterproof and doesn't leak.

(c)C is incorrect, because Pokemon shiny cards are not more valuable than normal ones, they don't require the other cards to exist, nor is this answer in the prompt. (d)D is incorrect because all pokemon cards are not rare.

The box is on a table which can slide perfectly smoothly in the horizontal direction, and the north and south walls move with it. The table is in front of a large sliding door and a very bright light is between the two. As the table slides left, a person on the outside can see two round shadows against the white wall. Each round shadow is 9 in wide, and the separation between two shadows never changes. What color is the light inside that is not visible from the outside?<n>Output: As per you question, if we are looking at the picture on the right, we notice that the 2 round shadows against the wall, the separation between them (as we can observe) does not change. Assuming that they are 9 in wide, what changes and is always the same is the area of the 2 round shaped spots (hollow in the middle) formed by the 2 round shapers, which is 81 each. As the box travels and the sliding door slides to the right, the light moves to the lower right corner of the box, and the 2 round shaded spots move to the right in 81, 282, 563, 844, and so on.  The 2 shaded spots always move to the right on the table by 81 for each inch the table travel, so, if the 2 shaded spotted move to the right by 81 inches as the table moves, then the table must move by 40 inches as for each inch one of the shaded spotted move, they should equal the other shaded spot by 40 inches. So, when the shaded spot travels 81 inches, then for that travel, the table should move by

A is a bad idea as sun himself would require physical movement and this would be not very good for someone lying on the beach.<n>B is an even worse idea as it will probably involve going somewhere which would also be not very good for sun himself.<n>D is a weird choice, as love is an emotion and you can only express love by talking or writing, whereas his choice of the beach was, from the question, to think about things, or at least not to do anything. E, though, is probably the best choice, given his situation.<n>So the final answer in this case is E.<n><n>Input:Another option is "to meet girls". This is the only correct answer if you are a man, as only men are capable of making this choice (and thus of expressing love).<n>So the final answer for question 7<n><n>Input:An alternative answer is "to see the sunset". This shows he is thinking about something, but his main concern is his own mental health.<n>So answer for question 7 question no 5 is E<n><n>Input:While the question asks what he "could" do, as his choice is what he actually does, he could instead choose "to stay in the shade", which is the best choice.<n>Also, given that love is only emotionally involving, this might be the reason he is doing this.<n>Also, this question asks "Could he". The correct answer is E if he is a man, and C if he is a woman, which leads to a different interpretation of the question.<n>So the final alternative answer for question 5<n><n>Input:The reason why he does the above actions and that is mentioned in the second half of the question is that he is bored in this situation, as he doesn't know what to do but still isn't willing to get up. Therefore, he makes himself bored, and he is able to think about things. Therefore the reason "to think about things" mentioned in the alternative answers is incorrect.<n>So the correct answer for question no 2 is A and final answer for question no 1 is D<n><n>Input:A

It's clear to me that there are two ways the seating at the tables will be at times, in equal numbers. There'll be six people plus no people, so six times three people plus five times four people. (I added three plus five because the pizza restaurant is closed or is not selling at all times it is open; or the last table at 11 p.m. may have fewer than six diners.) That is, 6X3+5X4=45. If that number is greater than 15, then 15 pizzes is indeed correct; however, if it is not greater than 15 then I'd have to say it is not correct.<n>

Like pet stores, where animals are kept in small cages or areas. or, he might also avoid the woodland, where some animals might be abused and in danger.  Answer: "d, woodland."<n>So the final answer should be D and E should be removed, because the only place that allows animal cruelty, and that is the park since parking lots are places, and parking lots are places. and north america is an actual place so it shouldn't be removed either. The answer is John loves animals and he finds animal abuse disgusting and that's why John is very careful about the parking lots. he would avoid woods because in the woods animals are hunted and they are also cruelly treated. he loves animals and he despises animal cruelty. John would avoid areas where animals are made brutally cruel. he could even avoid going out of the park and into the parking lot. he has made up his mind. he's going to be a pet owner. he's also going to start the first no pet store movement. I think he should start on the 1 st. day of his 1 st. day. because it shows that the boy loves animals. John loves animals and this is because he is a pet owner. John loves animals because he is the one who is saving them.<n><n>

Then square root the width and the height squared and subtract each from the previous value.  It will be a negative number as the height and width have the max number. Subtract the numbers and we get the answer. Answer: 37.  The dimensions of the box are width and height which cannot be written as two numbers as the box is 2D. I don't know how they are asking us to do it but I think it is impossible. Let me know if anyone knows."<n>That's one step too far, i was just solving the width.<n>The max number of cars that will fit in is the width of the box, as the width is the number of cars that is equal to the width of the box. This is because the width of the box is equal to the number of cars that fits in the box or the width of the square rectangle, which means it is equal to the width, which is equal to the number cars, which is equal to width, which is equal of the box.<n>So the final answer will be The dimensions of the box is height and width. and that will be 37.<n><n>

These vehicles arrive at the same crossroads at the same moment. Each truck arrives and leaves at the same instant. Each vehicle travels in a straight line. When the traffic lights change from red to green, the first 2 trucks may cross the intersection at the same time and travel in same direction. But the third truck can never cross the intersection. If the trucks were to reach their destinations without accidents, why was the third truck allowed to leave the flour mill?<n>Solution by MJ 2013<n>It is never a good idea for two heavy trucks to meet even if there is sufficient road. If they were to meet, their combined weight could make it impossible for the weaker vehicle to move. They would also likely block traffic, including cars, buses, semis, and delivery to smaller trucks who would be stuck on the side of the road waiting to get past because nowhere else could the big trucks go.

I guess if we use the 1 answer we will get the same "Turn away" Sailing doesn't use an engine to turn a boat. It uses the wind to push them for example the "Bermuda rigged" yacht, which uses an oar to give it direction. Rowing doesn't always do the same work as a sailing boat it is also the case of a motor boat with a engine. So in my opinion, turn away doesn't seem right, but B looks pretty much right. C: is also possible because to sleep the sailor takes its place under the sail, and E: doesn't seem right because it's not the same as the movement of wind to make a boat move, it's the same as A but less accurate and more slow. (But the question is "which type of water transportation"). In my opinion it's A I would say C because it's a sailing boat and it doesn't have to sleep under its sail, which is a movement of wind. But there is no answer. I don't know what you think (Maybe the answer is wrong.) Anyway thanks for reading. :)<n><n>Input: A square tube has a cross-sectional area of A=3+ square centimeters.

An expert has decided to hire 20 programmers from different cities to work on a project. Each programmer is from only one of the given cities.The programmer from each city is assigned one particular subject to work on. There are at least 10 different projects (tasks) for the group and only one programmer can work on any given project. No more than 2 programmers can work on a project. If any city is not represented by any of the programmers, the expert decides to call recruiters in that city to hire some programmers. The expert decides on the assignment using the following rules:<n>If a city is represented by multiple programmers and no project has already been assigned to them, then the expert assigns the next project to the least experienced programmer from that city.<n>Otherwise, the expert assigns the first project to the youngest programmer in that city.<n><n>Input:a group of programmers is given below.

Choices:  A: attic B: basement C: art show D: church E: bar<n>Output:		The wine must be chilled prior to drinking, so the attic would make sense for a few years of aging, but not for the long-term storage of wine. The basement would be ideal for short-term storage, but it's hard to keep wine from being affected by the extreme temperature drops that naturally occur in basements. It's doubtful that a person would want to transport a bottle of wine to a church. It's probably not a good idea to store wine on a stage or display shelf, as it may be exposed to sunlight. Wine is known to age well when stored with care in a cellar in a temperature similar to a refrigerator.

How long will it take to travel 1402 miles to Denver in a direction of 45 degrees north of west?<n>Answer: "The train departs the station at midnight and arrives at 8 AM the next morning, with an average speed of 15.0 mph.<n>To get the answer in time, it will be faster to do a problem of finding the distance from San Jose to Denver, which is 1402 mi and divide it by the speed of the train. The problem with doing this approach of finding the actual length is that it will take a long time to figure out the distance to 3 significant figures. ( 1 + 4 + 9 ) = 1402. To do it properly will be a waste of time and you will need to figure out to the 4th digit to see your answer is correct or not.<n><n>Using the compass rose, a 3 digit answer will be quicker. We will need the x-coordinate that corresponds to'45'. Let's say the x-coordinate of '45', which is 45 units, is 954,5. We would use 9.45 as our x-coordinate, and we now find the y-coordinate, which is the distance, ( 1402 / 9.45 = 149.3222222444

This one should be incorrect.<n><n>### Solution<n>A student's time is limited, so they are going to look at the book they plan to study. They do not have enough time to play a piano. If a student spends more time on a book than on a piano, they can use it instead of a piano. This solution is incorrect.<n>Electrical engineering: It is known that a piano has twice as many black and white keys as the number of keys in a book. So, the number of black and white piano keys is 3. This is the same as the number of keys. So, when a piano is in front of you, it's better than just looking at a book. A piano will provide more information and understanding than just looking at a black and white book.

She was not able to get the note back because it had stopped. The instructor told her to find the wrong note by hearing it and singing that note. You might have played the correct note with your left hand as it was on the incorrect hand, but the note was wrong.I think the answer is incorrect, because the incorrect response would be rhythmic move, and the correct one would be movement. When you are bad, or not understanding, you can not play in a rhythm.

It didn’t matter.  He didn’t have anything to put it on and he hadn’t learned the skill of balance either.  It would be a feat to get the cup to balance itself.<n><n>Now, when I was younger I was in gymnastics.  That’s what I did instead of learning how to ride a bike, because I couldn’t.  (Lucky for me my parents were both gymnasts.)  In gymnastics I had a very good teacher who told me I had very good balance.  He would set up a number of odd obstacles.  He would have balances, a ball, a small table, and of course a very heavy pair of men’s shoes.  I wasn’t supposed to do any of the “work” out of fear they’d fall on me.  I don’t think they were aware that if you gave me the shoes to stand on they really wouldn’t fall.  I also learned how to roll a quarter from one hand to the next with the palm flat on a coffee table without looking.  (If you’re young enough you can do it too, try it out.)<n><n>Learning balance is actually really easy.  It all depends on keeping your feet flat on the ground.  Most people have trouble not kicking their feet.  Instead of raising your toes to walk, raise the ball of your feet, or the heel of your feet.  You can probably even walk bare foot across your living room and not trip if you do that.  It’s also very easy to fall over with your back straight.  Put your shoulders back and relax.  It will let your legs and feet balance.<n><n>And about the cup, it wouldn’t take that much force, so much will get the cup over without tipping it.  You could try holding the ball of two fingers like you were holding a pinky or thumb, and then balance it.  You would have to balance it with your whole arm and wrist, but it would probably be easier than using the fingers.  Of course the more in balance you are the less force you will need.  I found this

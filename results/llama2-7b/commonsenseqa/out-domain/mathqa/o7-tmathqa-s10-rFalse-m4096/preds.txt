This can then be simplified to 1.4. Hence 14<n><n>4)<n>Adding 14 water increases the number of litres to 2,764 which is then simplified to 2764/20 = 138 LITRES!<n><n>5)<n><n>If a cube is 1ft3 then 1728 * 76 * 76 *76 = 33871126184cubes<n>The volume of the cube = 1728 cubes, Therefore the volume of one cube = 17566263

It is estimated that 3 percent of credit card purchases made on the new network will be fraudulent. If 100 million purchases are made on the new system. How many of the purchases will actually be fraudulent?<n>Solution: This is a tricky one. The 3% figure refers only to the number of purchases made in the new system that will be FRAUDULENT. However, only 3% of the total amount of money spent on credit cards (including the old system) will be fraudulently spent. So, (100,000,00) * (3/100) is the amount spent on the old system. Now, let's find the total amount "spent" fraudulently in the old system as well (not just money, but number of fraudulent purchases: 100,010,000 * (3/1,000,100,0) gives you the total number of fraudulently spent purchases on the old system as 100,102. You now need to find the total. (100,202 + 100)* 100,2) = 311,000 (i.e. 3% of that amount will be frauduluent and total amount is 37.6 million.<n>Output: G<n><n>Input: If 1 + p --------------- n, where p is a prime number, find the largest value of n.<n>Solution : The prime number p must divides 1-1 = n, 2-n,..., n-n.

The teacher asked a student to be still while the rest of the class worked out a math problem. (Where's the student?). At the beginning of the school year, an over enthusiastic student brought her own pencil and eraser to class. (Which student?) The librarian assigned each student an individual book. (Which books?) The teacher was taking a test, when she was called into the other class, where one of the students was acting strange, "Can't you see that's what he wanted?" The student exclaimed. (Who wanted?) The doctor was taking care of a patient when a man fell into the hospital room. (Which doctor?) The man was asked to stay by the side of the road so that the ambulance could make better time to the hospital. (Where was the man?) <n>Output: If "x" represents the number of fish in the pond, then "200" - x x (1 - x) is the number of "x" it takes to make 200. Let me see it this way, if x+x is greater than 200, you have a problem. If x is greater than 50, so I will set this equation to true, then you need 2 * 50 - x, or 0. Now I have the following. If x- 0 = 2 * 51- x, you will have to add an additional 101 (101= x-0), so that you can end up with 200.<n>

No line will be empty.<n>* Input lines may be of arbitrary lengths. But all the lines fit in a 2048 MB memory. This is the max memory I have. <n>* Input lines have up to 2048-bit floating point. There are no negative numbers in this question set. There are no spaces in any input lines.<n>* No input line will contain any illegal characters. They do include '+', '-' and '*'. <n>* Each input line will contain a question and answer.  Questions will have the format "How much water..... ".  And the answers will fit either between "c) 35 " or "b) 14 ".  That is "a) 35 ", "b) 13 " and "c) 14 " will be the only format formats possible for answers. <n>* The whole set of questions have been divided into two sets. There are 6 questions in each set. The first set has the even indexes and the second set has the odd indexes. Each time you move backwards an index should be increased by 2(inclusive) so next time you should start checking the questions with the even indexes and then by increasing the odd ones.<n>* For questions that require a simple division, you can first assume that they have an integer answer and use the modulo operation to get the answer. You can then convert this to a real answer.<n>* This has been tested on Google's CoCalc with SageMath backend. I had no issues on my 20GB memory machine. I do not know how this will work on slower machines or the 100GB ones.<n>* On some slower machines, I have witnessed the SageMath backend throwing exceptions. I do not think there is any way to prevent those. I've tried and nothing. I'm not sure how reliable those answers are. If that's the case, don't use those. If your backends throw exceptions, don't use them.<n>* You use the input given in CoCalc to load the files. No matter what, do not try to load the files from wherever. You will find the same issues. It is safe to say loading from CoCalc worked for all the machines I tried.

There are 12 marbles to fill 8 bowls (10 left over). There are 8 marbles to fill 4 bowls (4 left over). There is 1 marble to fill 2 bowls (1 left over) and there is no marble to fill 1 bowl (no left over)<n><n>There are 10 left over marbles, now we have to distribute those 10 marbles in 8 bowls, using 8 half marbles we cannot distribute our marbles, this means that the left over marbles must be distributed using a full marble (10 left over marble divided by 1 left over bowl).<n><n><n>This method requires thinking a little bit, there are 10 marbles remaining, in order to distribute them evenly we'll use the following method:<n>The total number of ways = 9!/3<n>And since the three bowl each have the same number of remaining marbles we will simply keep using the number three and our total number of combinations will be 9!/3<n>For instance (9,6,3) means that our nine marbles will be distributed in three bowls in the following way:<n>In Bowl A we have 6 marbles remaining<n>In Bowl B we have 3 marble remaining<n>In Bowl C we have 3 marbles left as well<n>Now for our solution:<n><n><n>B) We can use the same principle but first we have to distinguish between full marbles (1) and half marbles (0.5).<n>Here there are two full marbles and 18 half marbles, each full marble can place in

It is estimated that 3 percent of credit card purchases made on the new network will be fraudulent. If 100 million purchases are made on the new system. How many of the purchases will actually be fraudulent?\nSolution: This is a tricky one. The 3% figure refers only to the number of purchases made in the new system that will be FRAUDULENT. However, only 3% of the total amount of money spent on credit cards (including the old system) will be fraudulently spent. So, (100,000,00) * (3/100) is the amount spent on the old system. Now, let's find the total amount \"spent\" fraudulently in the old system as well (not just money, but number of fraudulent purchases: 100,010,000 * (3/1,000,100,0) gives you the total number of fraudulently spent purchases on the old system as 100,102. You now need to find the total.

There are 12 marbles to fill 8 bowls (10 left over). There are 8 marbles to fill 4 bowls (4 left over). There is 1 marble to fill 2 bowls (1 left over) and there is no marble to fill 1 bowl (no left over)\n\nThere are 10 left over marbles, now we have to distribute those 10 marbles in 8 bowls, using 8 half marbles we cannot distribute our marbles, this means that the left over marbles must be distributed using a full marble (10 left over marble divided by 1 left over bowl).\n\n\nThis method requires thinking a little bit, there are 10 marbles remaining, in order to distribute them evenly we'll use the following method:\nThe total number of ways = 9!/3\nAnd since the three bowl each have the same number of remaining marbles we will simply keep using the number three and our total number of combinations will be 9!/3\nFor instance (9,6,3) means that our nine marbles will be distributed in three bowls in the following way:\nIn Bowl A we have 6 marbles remaining\nIn Bowl B we have 3 marble remaining\nIn Bowl C we have 3 marbles left as well\nNow for our solution:\n\n\nB) We can use the same principle but first we have to distinguish between full marbles (1) and half marbles (0.5).\nHere there are two full marbles and 18 half marbles, each full marble can place in", "answer": "E: desk drawer"}

Then comes a line containing the data of the type of alcohol whose number of units is zero. \nA unit is the equivalent of serving 1 liter of liquor in a bar.

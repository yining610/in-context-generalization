Each person will receive 1/2 of the 75 litre water as was previously being provided.\n  \u24d8 EXPLANATION:\n  \u24d8 LITRE: a basic measure of capacity in the metric system equal to 1,000 cubic centimeters\n  \u24d8 REASONING:\n  \u24db The number can be written as 78\u00d7(1000/1).\n  \u24db As we know, water has a density of 1 g/cm3, which means that 1 centimetre of water weighs exactly 1 gram.\n  \u24db Therefore, we can write 78\u00d7(cm\u00b3/1000)litre=178g.\n  \u24dc So, the number of litres of available water to each resident can be written as '6\u00d72g'\u22480.6g.", "answer": "A: suicide"}

There are plenty of instances e.g. young children whose height are less/more than their parents or a genetic disease where the height decreases significantly. However, there is a statistical relationship e.g. the average adult is 1.75m tall. Someone above 1.85m may be an abnormality.\n\nInput: What is the difference between a function and its inverse function A: They are both graphs. B: They both have y = f(x).

E: They both have the line y = 1/x as their graph between the points (0, 0) and (1, 1).\nAnswer: The right answer may depend on your understanding of the question. E.g. If you understood that the line y = 0 is part of the graph between the points ( 0, 0) (1,1) then C would be the appropriate answer.\n\n##### Reference: https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/statistics-questions.html\nInput: The current age of an American is 75.5 years.

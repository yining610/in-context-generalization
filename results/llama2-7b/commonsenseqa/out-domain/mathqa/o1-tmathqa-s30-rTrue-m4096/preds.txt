The first computer I ever programmed was a BASIC programmer, and it had one simple command:.GOBACK. Above the command line were some simple instructions that looked like this: 1. GOTO X. END 2. GOTO X . END 3. GOTO X = Y. GOTO X. GOBACK.  The program would go through all the instructions: 1.. GOTO X → GOTO X = 10 → GOTO X + 10 →  The command was a way to tell the computer to go back. The number I typed was an integer, so if I typed in 10, I'd get another 10. If I told it to go to the next line, it would skip that line and start right where it left off. You can skip over lines by reimagining what each line is doing. If you try to go back too many lines, it'll say, "Oh no, I can't go back that far."  If you want to continue the story, you need to keep the previous line in the first part of the code.<n>Output:The only way to win is to know the rules.<n><n>Input:I found it to be easier if you had a little bit of practice before you start, such as practicing with a text editor, if you have a computer you can also try with a programmable game system.

Explain when it is possible <n>to draw conclusions about a population on the basis of a sample of the population.<n><n>Answer: The population is the entire sample of items. A random sample is one that includes a fixed percentage. Random samples represent the population well in the sense that the items are picked with a certain degree of randomization. Therefore, statistical sampling is useful if the population of interest is very large.<n>If it is small or very small, then this data sampling method will not work. We are only trying to use a sample to represent the population.<n><n>Output: An algorithm for data sampling is to first take a random selection from the entire population. This process is called sampling without replacement. After sampling the desired number of items, this sample will be used instead of the entire population. This is called a systematic sample. This systematic sample can become biased. Instead the probability can be weighted so the systematic sample gets the correct results.<n><n># Find the mean and variance for the following:<n><n>Input: The data set 0 0 4 0 3 0 5 3 3 0 1 2 0 0 5 0 0 6 is the height of <n>five boys in a class.

For example, the odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7,... are the successors to the 0. Likewise, the even numbers are the successors to 2. A set of consecutive natural numbers is called an arithmetic progression (AP), and if the difference between each successive pair is the same, then we say the progression is by "d", where d is a fixed number, known as the common difference or difference. If the progression is by 1, it is called a geometric progression

You have five minutes to read the text. <n><n>Text: There once was a young lady named Lucy who lived in a small cottage at the edge of a great forest. She had a lovely garden where she grew all sorts of fruits and vegetables. Every day around noon Lucy sat in her garden eating fresh tomato soup. One day while she was sitting there she saw a rather unfortunate figure approaching her little garden. It was a gnome. The gnome was very thin and had a sallow face. “Hello, Lucy,” stated the gnome, “I am very hungry. I wandered into the woods for the afternoon and did not bring enough rations to quell my appetite and, though I have a fine cookbook, I have no cooking materials.” “That is tragic.” Said Lucy. “I have something that might be useful to your survival in these woods. I have a recipe book with many wonderful recipes in it. It contains some of the best tomato soup recipes I know.” Said Lucy. <n>The gnome looked at the recipe book with great interest. It was filled with recipes for tomato soup, chocolate cake and allsorts. The gnome was impressed. He said “that was very generous of you to offer me your cookbook. I am sure I will survive this woods with this at hand. Thank you, Lucy.” “You don’t have to thank me.” Said Lucy. But the gnome seemed so grateful that Lucy felt she had to reward him for being so kind. She said “Well, you can stay the night here.” And the gnome was ecstatic. “Thank you, thank you.” He said. The gnome then settled down in the house to rest and to eat and drink plenty of water. He was still thinking of the wonderful recipe book that Lucy had given to him and his thoughts began to drift into the tomato soup recipes. He was thinking to himself a great deal about them. As the night progressed the gnome grew sleepy. He looked around his room for a spot to sleep and he found it. He lay down close to Lucy’s bedside and felt the cool night air on his face. The

It turns out that these multiple choice questions are not random. They are generated from the book [Knocking on Doors](http://www.tjmorris.org/bookdetail.cfm?page=1&isbn=1880688121) by William M. Arkin (Prentice Hall General Reference 1999).<n><n>You can get the data here: <https://www.dropbox.com/s/ddc78w96rxt5u4n/Multiple_Choice_Question_Dataset.zip?dl=0>. <n><n>A. The code from my talk at PyCon 2011 is here: <http://climate.cs.uchicago.edu/publications/Tsatsaronis/2011/tsatsaronis.slides.pdf><n><n>So the first few lines get the mean from the data:<n><n>    print("Number of words in the data:",len(dictionaryData))<n>    mean=sum(dictionaryData)/ len(dictionaryData)<n><n><n>You can see the results:<n><n>    print "dictionaryData after removing the word mean ==", mean<n>    print dictionaryData<n><n>From inspecting the data, it is evident that the mean question was one of 140. 33 or 152. It's not the mean in our data set because we didn't have 135. <n><n>The code, including the correction, comes later. After that I'll explain why it was not random in the first place.<n>

We want to say shop is second choice because you can get all you needs and wants from the shop as people are likely to go there to buy anything that they want to use and it is a very affordable place to shop.<n>Station is third choice because it is the best choice because they can find any radio of their choice because in this place they have everything people can buy and it is an affordable place since it is not as crowded as shop. The last choice will be space because when people see something they want from an advert either in the newspaper or a poster they first think of buying that thing from the shop but because it is not that easy. Then they would think of going to bedrooms because they feel comfortable sleeping and watching T.V at the same time so people would like to buy something from the shop.

An expression can never be both TRUE and FALSE.<n><n>The results TRUE and FALSE have truth values of 1 and 0 respectively in C#.<n>```csharp<n>bool expression = expression1 && expression2;<n>```<n><n>### Question29:<n>What happens, if one of the two values is FALSE?<n>When both expressions are evaluated in the if statement, even if only one of the two is TRUE, the result is still TRUE. However, if the values are equal, then one result is returned instead of both.<n><n>You can write conditional operators in two ways. Which method would you pick in this case:<n>```csharp<n>if (condition1) {<n>    return result1;<n><n>if (condition2) {<n>    return condition2;<n>}<n><n>return condition1;<n>```<n>In all 3 scenarios, only one result will be returned.<n><n>### Question4:<n>What is the difference between a ternary conditional and an if else in c#?<n>Use a ternary operator when you want to make the conditional evaluation as concise as possible.<n>In a ternary operator, just like in an if statement, you have an expression of the result, followed by an assignment operator, followed by a true or false value

You can not cross the middle lane but if you cross the third lane with the trucks you make them stop with honking the cars horn. In one honk the car goes 2 meters and one truck goes 8 meters. Above the highway is clear sky and there is a 60 meter tree. From the tree you can see the highway. There are no buildings or vehicles beside the road. The car is going 10 meters per second if there are no obstacles and no honking. So if you honk you need to cover the tree. How will you solve this?

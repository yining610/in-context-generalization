The first computer I ever programmed was a BASIC programmer, and it had one simple command:.GOBACK. Above the command line were some simple instructions that looked like this: 1. GOTO X. END 2. GOTO X . END 3. GOTO X = Y. GOTO X. GOBACK.  The program would go through all the instructions: 1.. GOTO X \u2192 GOTO X = 10 \u2192 GOTO X + 10 \u2192  The command was a way to tell the computer to go back. The number I typed was an integer, so if I typed in 10, I'd get another 10. If I told it to go to the next line, it would skip that line and start right where it left off. You can skip over lines by reimagining what each line is doing. If you try to go back too many lines, it'll say, \"Oh no, I can't go back that far.\"  If you want to continue the story, you need to keep the previous line in the first part of the code.\nOutput:The only way to win is to know the rules.\n\nInput:I found it to be easier if you had a little bit of practice before you start, such as practicing with a text editor, if you have a computer you can also try with a programmable game system.

This is illustrated by flipping a fair coin. a random variable is a random outcome in an experiment. It can be any numerical result.A. A random experiment has only one possible outcome.B. a random variable can be defined for an experiment in which there are many possible outcomes.c. The probability that you get heads when you flip a coin is the same as the probability that you get heads the next time you flip the coin.\nd It is essential that you use the formula for the variance for any binomial distribution. Output : Answer b\n\nInput : An experiment is a systematic process of obtaining information to make decisions. It is the basic unit of probability sampling. The probability of an event is greater when the event is dependent on other events in the experiment.A. The success probability of the coin is the same as in the previous toss. B, it is the event that the coin will turn up heads.C The value of p is not the probability that an event will occur. D. It relates to the probabilities of two events.\nE.

Explain when it is possible \nto draw conclusions about a population on the basis of a sample of the population.\n\nAnswer: The population is the entire sample of items. A random sample is one that includes a fixed percentage. Random samples represent the population well in the sense that the items are picked with a certain degree of randomization. Therefore, statistical sampling is useful if the population of interest is very large.\nIf it is small or very small, then this data sampling method will not work. We are only trying to use a sample to represent the population.\n\nOutput: An algorithm for data sampling is to first take a random selection from the entire population. This process is called sampling without replacement. After sampling the desired number of items, this sample will be used instead of the entire population. This is called a systematic sample. This systematic sample can become biased. Instead the probability can be weighted so the systematic sample gets the correct results.\n\n# Find the mean and variance for the following:\n\nInput: The data set 0 0 4 0 3 0 5 3 3 0 1 2 0 0 5 0 0 6 is the height of \nfive boys in a class.

Z ( 2/2 ) % 2 where Z is the normal score z-score\n\n% in this formula is a % as % = 1% or 1 -.01, so % is.01\nThe z score is \u221a(67^2 - 67^2)\n\n67 ^ 2 = 4701, z ^ 2 = \u221a4701\n\nz = sqrt(.586)\nZ = \u00b1.586 \u221a(2) (0.01) 2\nAnswer: 67 + (\u2212.446) = 66.55 or\n67 \u2013 (.446) =.6752 (more than 4th place)\nor\n67 + (0.446) \u03c3 = 67.24 4th = 66.86 or\n67 \u2212 (.446) \u03bc = 67.659 1st = 67.75\n\nInput: The mean of an unrepresentative sample \u03be drawn from a given population \u03bc is found to be 92.4\nThe true mean \u00b5 can be estimated as --------------\nOutput answer: a) \u03b4, b) \u03d5, c) \u00b5, d) 55.12, e) 92.5 %\n\nThe final answer is b", "answer": "C: space center"}

For example, the odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7,... are the successors to the 0. Likewise, the even numbers are the successors to 2. A set of consecutive natural numbers is called an arithmetic progression (AP), and if the difference between each successive pair is the same, then we say the progression is by \"d\", where d is a fixed number, known as the common difference or difference.

She had a lovely garden where she grew all sorts of fruits and vegetables. Every day around noon Lucy sat in her garden eating fresh tomato soup. One day while she was sitting there she saw a rather unfortunate figure approaching her little garden. It was a gnome. The gnome was very thin and had a sallow face. \u201cHello, Lucy,\u201d stated the gnome, \u201cI am very hungry. I wandered into the woods for the afternoon and did not bring enough rations to quell my appetite and, though I have a fine cookbook, I have no cooking materials.\u201d \u201cThat is tragic.\u201d Said Lucy. \u201cI have something that might be useful to your survival in these woods. I have a recipe book with many wonderful recipes in it. It contains some of the best tomato soup recipes I know.\u201d Said Lucy. \nThe gnome looked at the recipe book with great interest. It was filled with recipes for tomato soup, chocolate cake and allsorts. The gnome was impressed. He said \u201cthat was very generous of you to offer me your cookbook. I am sure I will survive this woods with this at hand. Thank you, Lucy.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me.\u201d Said Lucy. But the gnome seemed so grateful that Lucy felt she had to reward him for being so kind. She said \u201cWell, you can stay the night here.\u201d And the gnome was ecstatic. \u201cThank you, thank you.\u201d He said. The gnome then settled down in the house to rest and to eat and drink plenty of water. He was still thinking of the wonderful recipe book that Lucy had given to him and his thoughts began to drift into the tomato soup recipes. He was thinking to himself a great deal about them. As the night progressed the gnome grew sleepy. He looked around his room for a spot to sleep and he found it. He lay down close to Lucy\u2019s bedside and felt the cool night air on his face.

An expression can never be both TRUE and FALSE.\n\nThe results TRUE and FALSE have truth values of 1 and 0 respectively in C#.\n```csharp\nbool expression = expression1 && expression2;\n```\n\n### Question29:\nWhat happens, if one of the two values is FALSE?\nWhen both expressions are evaluated in the if statement, even if only one of the two is TRUE, the result is still TRUE. However, if the values are equal, then one result is returned instead of both.\n\nYou can write conditional operators in two ways. Which method would you pick in this case:\n```csharp\nif (condition1) {\n    return result1;\n\nif (condition2) {\n    return condition2;\n}\n\nreturn condition1;\n```\nIn all 3 scenarios, only one result will be returned.\n\n### Question4:\nWhat is the difference between a ternary conditional and an if else in c#?\nUse a ternary operator when you want to make the conditional evaluation as concise as possible.\nIn a ternary operator, just like in an if statement, you have an expression of the result, followed by an assignment operator, followed by a true or false value", "answer": "A: relaxation"}

You can not cross the middle lane but if you cross the third lane with the trucks you make them stop with honking the cars horn. In one honk the car goes 2 meters and one truck goes 8 meters. Above the highway is clear sky and there is a 60 meter tree. From the tree you can see the highway. There are no buildings or vehicles beside the road. The car is going 10 meters per second if there are no obstacles and no honking. So if you honk you need to cover the tree. How will you solve this? Use only numbers.\n\nOutput: \"Answer: Use a honk with a very high pitch. The horn will go very high and will stop all the trucks. You can then pass under the bridge.

The cost price of the television is greater than that of the stereo speakers by the same percent as the selling price of the television is less than that of the selling price of a stereo speaker. For how much are the two items sold together?<n><n>Output: Stereo speakers sell at $ 35 less than the TV, so they each contribute $ 35 to their combined sales price. If the total sales price were $ 39, then $ 30 is the TV's share of the loss, leading to the conclusion that the TV lost the other dollar.  This can be stated as follows: $ 0. 30 = 1.4 - $ 35, or $ 1. 1 = $ 35. The price ratio is 1. 1 TVs : 35 stereo speakers, so each $ 35 TV loses $ 65 and the combined stereo speakers earn $ 85 on the sale.<n><n>Input: How many different 4-card sequences starting with the card 2 are possible?

Now, <n><n>  i) when line is vertical, then it is parallel to horizontal y - axis<n>  ii) when line is horizontal, then it is parallel top horizontal x- axis<n><n>In these cases, when a line is parallel to horizontal axis of x-coordinates, then number of y - coordinates between any two points of the line will be unique for a line.<n><n>Also, in equation $ y = a x + b $, we know that $ y - x - b $ is a constant. So, number of y-coordinates on $y = a x + b$ is same is any two values of $x$.<n><n>So, in options a), c) and d), number of unique pairs of y-coordinate between any two points of line is 1. Hence, option a), c) and d) are correct.<n><n>Options, b) and e) have no line parallel to x-axis or y-axis. Hence, in options b) and e), number of unique pairs of coordinates between any two points will more than 2.<n><n>### Program : <n>```python<n>ans = 1<n>while ans == 1:<n>    while True:<n>        try :<n>            ans = raw_input('input the number of questions ').split()<n>            ans = int(ans[0])<n>        except Exception as e :<n>            print(e)<n>    break<n>while ans!= '0':<n>    try :<n>        ans = raw_input("Input the question

Average. 1. When we talk about a whole number, the definition is "the number that divides evenly into two or more items." For example, if ten people are in the room, and none of them smokes, the number 10 is the mean because 10 is the number that can be divided evenly by everyone in the room. So, in an example, if five people don't smoking, the number 5, is often mistakenly used to show that four out of ten people smoked, when we should use the actual mean (75/10). 2. The mean of a set of numbers is the constant value of an arithmetic operation over that set of numbers, which is calculated simply by adding them up then dividing by the total number. So if we calculate the mean using different numbers, the answers would be different. In the example given before, we would obtain 38.5, 38.51, and 38.52, respectively, if we used 2.1, 2.1, or 2.1 to represent the number of smokers in the room. 3. Another kind of mathematical mean deals with the notion of weighting. In elementary school, a "bigger" mean is more important because that number is a constant value after adding, while all numbers that deviate from the mean value will add weight to it (but subtract from it as well). So, the big mean is more important when we want to calculate the weight because of the way we want to use the numbers. For example, if we want to know how many people in a room smoke, we are most concerned that the room is either 100% smokers or 100% non-smokers. A larger weight

A yard can house 10 cattle. All the cattle are healthy and can breed once between October and February. The number of calves depends on how many cows are kept in the yard. If the cow yard is completely full (houses 10 cattle), one calf is born per cow. If a yard contains fewer than 10 cattle, there will be fewer calves on average. The following graph has been made using a table of cattle numbers and calves. The number of cattle can go from 1 to 7, and the number of calves can go from 12 to 0. The numbers 1 and 7 are for the case of a completely full cow yard, and 12 is the maximum amount of calves that can be born. A farmer will spend $30 dollars a year on food for each cow. He must also pay $200 per calf to care for them. The farmer wants to buy new cows every 5 years in order to keep his yard at its maximum capacity. The farmer prefers paying out a lump sum in 5 years to spending the money gradually over time.<n>What's the farmer's goal? To minimize yearly cost<n><n>```python<n>def main():<n>    choiceList = [("1", "11.21"),<n>        ("2", "9.6"),<n>        ("3", "8.66"),<n>        ("4", "12.23"),<n>        ("5", "13.1"),<n>        ("6",

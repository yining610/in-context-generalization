Choices:  Choice A: 2 B: 22 C: 8 D: 9 E: 14\nOutput: \"There were 5 students in the class  room: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  In the 1st group, 1 was absent so 1 remained. In the 2nd  group, 4 was absent so 4 remained.  In the 3rd  group, 3 was absent so 2 remained.  In the  4th group, 2 was absent so 1  remained. In the  5th group, 5 was absent so  0 remained.  There were  0  absent.  So, in each of the 16 groups ( 7 * 2 groups ) each group had one student in it. ( 1 was present in the 1st group )  Thus the numbers in all the 16 groups were 1, 2 and 3 in each of the  groups.  Thus the numbers in  the 5th group were 0, 1 and 2. So students who were present in   the 5th group, were 1, 3, 1 and 1.  Thus the numbers absent in   the  6th group were 2, 3 and 4. So the numbers of absent students  in   the  first group was 1. Thus the total number of students  who  were absent were  2+3+4  That amounts to  9. Thus, there were  9 present and  9 absent.  The total number of  students present in  each of   the  7 groups were  1, 2,  3,  2,  3 and  4. The sum of  their numbers was  22.

Answer: 9001\n\n### Solution:\nFor the first question, The correct mean would have been 4200.25.\nSince all we have been asked to do is to find out the correct mean we cannot subtract 135 from 140. The correct formulation should be:\n 30*140 - 135 + (x30) = 420 00 x30 x30 x 0 = 42 00 00 x\nBut what we need is the answer. So,\nTherefore, x = [30 * 140 + 140] / [30 * 30] = 141\nTherefore, The corrected mean is 4200 *141 / 30 =4200.141\n\nFor the second Question, the output is correct. It says b as answer.\nThe mean of 30 numbers will be 4200 /30 = 136.7\nThe Mean of the 30 numbers plus 30*137 = 4202.6\nWe subtract 145/30 = 5 to get the sum as 4200-5.\nWhich is = 4205/ 30 = 5\nWhich is the wrong answer, So the right answer is 4202/30= 4202\n\nFor the third Question, the formula used for the average of the 4 numbers is = [((16)/(10)) + (20)/(10)] / 2 = 16/10", "answer": "C: being found out"}

At some point the signaling mirror breaks.\nTo signal their location to rescuers, each person uses the cannon to shoot smoke signals on the horizon; at the same time, each person looks up and waves with the signaling mirror. The cannon is a loud weapon, and so they try to coordinate their schedules to shoot smoke signals together. How is the best way to synchronize their shots for the least amount of gunpowder, so as to maximize their chances of getting rescued?\nChoices:  A: 4 smoke signals at sunrise, then signaling mirror at noon for 4 days (engineer), 4 smoke signals at noon, then signaling mirror, 4 days later at sunrise (mathematician), 4 smoke signals, 12 hours apart, for two days (economist).\nB: 4 smoke signals when the sun is at its highest point, then at noon for 10 days (economist), 1 cannon shot on the first sunrise, 4 cannon shots on first sunrise for 10 days, 2nd day at noon (engineer), 1 cannon smoke signal plus signaling mirror for 10 days at noon (mathematician), or\nC: 4 smoke signals, one every 4 sunrises after the first (engineer), 2 signaling mirror waving days 2 hours apart (mathematician), all signaling mirror days (economist)", "answer": "A: depressed"}

A: 752 B: 700 C: 400 D: 350\nOutput: I think the key to this is to find a solution by finding the number of minutes it took each question and then finding the ratio.\nSo, it took 50 people 12 minutes to answer one question, so it took 12/min.  When it took 500 people 6 minutes to answer a question, the ratio would be (50/500)*12/6 = 2/3 so, it would take 500 / (2/3) to answer one question  It takes five minutes for one person to answer a question, so it would take 5/1*(500/2/3) to finish the 100 questions, so I got 500*(5/1)/(100/10) = 500/51000. and I didn \u2019 t bother with fractions so you can see what they did.\nSo, it would take around 420 to answer all the questions they threw at you.\n\nInput: What is the largest number possible by dividing it by 4 without any remainder.

Python is not the only programming I have wanted to do but it is the only one I have a clear understanding of. My work is at least part time and I want to get started with at least one programming language before the end of the semester so I started the class on Python. After going to the workshop in class I have gotten a bit more understanding of the basics of Python and decided to look at tutorials. So I looked at a couple web sites, youtube, Code Academy, Free Code Camp and Python Online Training. For the Python web sites they all go over the same basic principles and at least you are able to move along the tutorial until they say you need to have some knowledge about what they are talking about. So far I would say if you just knew what a string is you could follow along with any of the websites. Now from there all of them offer a downloadable version to do the exercises. Unfortunately I am using Windows 10 and I had some issues with the downloadable version and did not figure out how to figure it out. But so far, for the three I have tried: 1- Python for Beginners by code academy - 2-Code Academy Python - 3 Freepythononline", "answer": "B: gaining knowledge"}

So the answer is 2:1 can't mean an even number + even number\nSo let's find the solution for an odd number + an odd number\nSo 2 : 1 = 19 / 10 + 19 / 9 = ( 10 + 9 ) / 19\nand this is also not valid for the given case. So solution is we can not make this 2 : 1 by an odd number + an even number or an even number + an an odd number\nSolution given by the author in the paper is :\nSince it is mentioned that x is a missing number I came to the idea that it could be a missing number from the second term, but that wouldn't be possible for ratio to be 2:1. The only chance x can be \"x * y\" of any of the even num or odd num, But that won't be possible as the other option is also valid at this time and there is no condition that two options can't both be selected. So it's impossible to choose it for one and then the other is valid it's also there.\n\n### Output\nSo the", "answer": "B: rejection"}

(You should not copy my answer at all and remember only the words were given in order for me to get the best answer.)\n\nWhenever we think about school, we do not just think about the classes, we also think about the recess that every single school student enjoys. In the Philippines, as in most countries, there\u2019s a common question that\u2019s always associated with recess, and that is \u201cwhat do you want to eat?\u201d It is a very simple question, but it can get very complicated.\n\nWhen kids grow up, they may never again appreciate their meal. But when they are still young, recess is something that they look forward to, and they are thrilled with the little food they can get for themselves. Many students can be satisfied with a simple sandwich (with peanut butter) or a packed lunch. But what if they want a little more?\n\nStudents may not like the little food that\u2019s given to them for recess, but there\u2019s a reason why it\u2019s like that. It\u2019s for sanitation. Some schools are known for the long lines of students waiting to get a packed lunch for themselves. Every student can get only one sandwich (with peeled egg, for example). That is why students may complain about the little food they get, but they don\u2019t know that it\u2019s for their safety. They are never allowed to have food in their pockets because they may have food poisoning, and it\u2019s important to keep themselves safe.\n\nBut still, many students complain about the little recess food they are given. I think that schools should change that, but with some exceptions. They should let students have a little more food, just in case. It\u2019s only a small meal, but it will give", "answer": "E: get food"}

The dog has a head start (11kmph), and so has a head start of (11kmph) minutes. 660m / 11kmph = 60mins. 60mins / 11kmps = 5mins.

{"idx": 886, "text": "\"The correct answer is D, Guest Room a guest room is a bedroom meant to give to guests. In the days when households had live-in servants, a guest room was commonly referred to as a \"guest chamber\" and sometimes \"guest parlor\" or \"visitor's room.\" Many small urban houses of the early 1900s did not provide for bedrooms for servants, and so the guest parlor or guest room was also designated to accommodate a few guests who wished to stay over. In many older houses built in rural areas for working people, a separate bedroom with a washbasin was provided for guests. The bedroom, which might become a guest room for more affluent families, was called a \"guestchamber,\" while the washbasin was called a \"guestsink\" in much of the country. This terminology, in which \"guest\" was the operative noun in the phrase, has persisted in informal use and has also been applied to children's bedroom, when a child is playing host to an out-of-town guest. (https://www.etymonline.com/search?f=etymonline&q=guest) A stereotype is an oversimplified opinion shared by many people about specific groups, often based on a particular trait or belief that may be untrue. For example, in western society, stereotypes are often the difference between the image of \"the strong, silent type\" and that of the \"womanizing playboy.\" In that example, a man would often be thought of having no romantic attachments, while a woman would be thought of as being the victim of men's lust and promiscuity. Other stereotypes include people who smoke being \"addicted\" and people who eat meat being \"carnivorous.\" Stereotypes can be found in all walks of life, and many have long been in place due to popular culture. Often we see popular stereotypes used in film and television, such as how a \"rich snob\" is portrayed in a romantic comedy.

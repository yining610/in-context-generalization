{"idx": 67, "text": "D\n\n### Solution:\n\n1.What is the time interval between two consecutive buses?\n\nSolution: The cyclist meets an oncoming bus after every six minutes. Since the cyclist and the buses move at a constant speed, the interval between two cycles will be 72 minutes exactly.\n\n2.What is the speed of the athlete who runs in the 200m race of 24 seconds?\n\nAnswer to Solution 1: Every 6 cycles (18 minutes), the next bus arrives (i.e. every 18 * 72 = 1304 minutes). This means that after every 1304 cycles, the next bus arrives. Now, when the bus arrives after every 13 cycles, we have\n\nSo, the next bus arriving cycle after 13 \u22c5 8 = 104 * 8 = 832 minutes = (128 minutes) + 832 minutes. This means at the 833rd cycle, the next bus arrivesi.e., at the 834th cycle, the next bus appears.\n\nOn the 834 cycle, it will then take just 33 minutes for the bus to come, as the next bus cycle is 835 * 72 =128 + 33 * 48 = 1303 minutes. This is exactly 24 minutes.\n\nSo, the athlete runs the race in 24 * 60 = 1440 seconds.\n\n3.What is the fewest number for which the company can purchase two types of computer printer?\n\nAnswer to solution 2: When purchasing two types of computers, the cost of 3 of a given type is the same as the cost of one of the other type.

However, a person who is not depressed may nevertheless commit suicide, so that choice does not eliminate the possibility that it could be someone's death. Hence, A or D are the answers.\n\nThe most common \"suicide\" note is one written by someone who is contemplating suicide, indicating that it is murder.

{"idx": 131, "text": "Choice: B (ground): When a rock is thrown into a river it has some impact force F applied to it by the impact with the water. This force is proportional to the force of gravity g times distance from the surface of the earth d. The water surface tension force F' = the force of tension on a flat surface when another is in contact with it. The force applied to the water by the rock is given by the vector equation F = F' + KF. = Kgd = cKgd (where K is some constant). The rock therefore moves upwards with velocity u = - F / m of displaced mass m. The splash of the water that is thrown down is the size, h, of a hemispherical paraboloid of velocity 2u. If the point on the water is assumed to be at the centre of the splash, then the radius of the water, r, is given by r = (h / 2)/ (g/K) = (hgK/ 2)2, from which we can deduce the height h of the splash (assuming F'>>F) as given by the equations h = hgK/ 2 = gKKdh. The height of the splash is maximised by maximising, h. = 1 r. We are thus left with the equation r = gK, (gK / 2)2 d, which can be solved for K to give the value.  g.K. = h2 (dK)2 / (16) = 4dK. Solving for d we have d = F / f. The time delay in the velocity, u of the rock is therefore d / u.\nInput: If a car travels 46 km / h in 5h, how many kilometers does it travel?

We have not met any of these questions on our lesson. But I have a solution which may help you. Let\u2019s try to be a friend and help you understand your problem. I can see you don\u2019t know any mathematics to solve the equations for the first one and I can see you don't have any interest to go to your coaching and I can see that you are a honest and hard working student who don't know any shortcuts or any other solution. The reason for my claim could be your question. So I will help you answer these questions. All you need is a little bit of effort and concentration and that's it.\n\n## For the first question\nYou will only get 3 methods to solve. The first method is called \"brute force\". It is a method where you keep changing options and checking your answer. The second method is called \"algo\". An algo is a function or code which is written in a programming language which will solve the problems and the third method is \"a hint\". The answer to the question in hints is : (2)(3) / 5\n\n## For the second question\nIn order to solve this question I will consider a new term \"modulo\". Modulo of 2 is simply denoted as %2. So, if you try to understand this question using modulo it will be easier and you will get the answer easily.\n\n## For The third question\n\nI will use the brute force method to solve this question.\n\n## For Fourth Question\n\nIt seems that question is very hard but if you see carefully you will see all you have to do is a little bit of brute force. First you have to find a general pattern and then brute force using a little bit of probability.\n\n## For Question 5\n\nI will use brute force. But first, I'll define what multiplication sign is. Multiplication sign is denoted as \"x\". In mathematics what we do is multiply numbers or variables.\n\n## For Sixth Question\n\nThe answer to question is b in the first choice and c will be in the second choice.  I will use one line statement to solve this question.", "answer": "C: honest"}

B is the most common place to learn to play a piano, but that refers to the grand variety, not the upright. For example, if someone asked, \"Where does one learn to play the guitar?\" one would be more likely to answer, \"A: A band practice venue; B: A music class,\" rather than \"A: A guitar store; B: A music practice venue\". A is used because the question is posed in the form of, \"Where would someone learn to do X?\" A person wouldn't learn to play a upright in their house. However, they might learn to play them in a music store by taking a music class at a music store. It's also important that the question, \"Where does someone...\", does not refer specifically to only upright pianos. It's a hypothetical/generalized question, and thus refers generically to any kind of piano, as in, \"Where does one...?\"\n\nInput:Anna and Benny are two co-owners of a small business.

A bus does not need the time it takes you to walk from where you started to where you got off even if you're late. It doesn't need anyone waiting in the wrong terminal or missing it because they think their house is the bus's final destination when it's merely transit for another bus. Most buses run in a timely fashion without needing them. A bus is less expensive than the average car, more convenient, easier to drive than a truck, and offers better value for money than a luxury car. I'm waiting to get on a bus that hasn't arrived yet because I could spend hours waiting for it to be late. It would be cheaper just to pay for a ride as long as my bus is running on time. The bus is so slow that you can get stuck in traffic. A bus is more expensive than a car and less convenient than a bike. The most important part of a bus is that there are no seats available on one of them when it's running.

These people have to go either 1, 2, 3, or 4 miles to the nearest grocer's shop. If every family has exactly three miles of street, or exactly four miles of street, what is the maximum number of possible families?\n\n## Explanation\n\nTo maximize the minimum, we want to give as many people as possible (at least two) who are equidistant from the grocer's shop, that is, who live either 1 mile from the grocer' s shop or 2 miles, 3 miles, or 4 miles from the grocer'. There are 15 families for whom the difference is exactly 1 mile or exactly 2 miles; we must subtract those. Then there are 30 families for whom the difference between the distance to the store is exactly 1 mile, 2 miles, 2 miles, or 3 miles; again we must subtract those. Next are 18 families who have one family with exactly 1 mile to the grocer's, two families with exactly 2 miles to the grocer' s, two with exactly 3 miles to the grocer and two with exactly 4 miles to the grocer, each on three possible streets, for a total of 42 cases. Finally, there are 32 families that all are on exactly one street and have exactly 3 miles each to the grocer'. The latter may be treated as one family because they all live on the same street, and the final answer is 25. We have maximized the quantity and found the minimum. In all, there are twelve possible combinations of a minimum number of streets with a minimum number of possible families.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe answer is 25, because the grocer has to serve between 15 and 18 families. That would be an average of 16, but in each of those cases, he serves between 16 and 20 people.\n\n\n** 3 The most interesting question (at least so far as puzzles go) is: How can the town be organized so that if you are more than 2 miles from any grocer, you will not be able to get to your", "answer": "D: cupboard"}

Similarly if we subtracted 49 from 100 we get 51 as answer. So we can see that 20 is the missing number by repeating this sequence of numbers we get that 20 x 9 = 180 so we can see that we should subtract 180 from these 3 numbers and the difference of the 3 new numbers should be 72.\n\nSo, 438 - 180 = 258, 476 - 180=296 452 - 180=-57\nAnswer is 459.\n\n### Instructions:Solve as per the description.\n* The solution is to be posted in comments\n\n### Question::\nConsider the following six numbers: 4, 51, 17, 31, 13, 23 and 53. \n\nWhich number appears only once in the permutation of these six numbers?\n## Answer:\n* The answer must be put in a code/indicator form in comments\n\n## Instruction:Solve as per instructions given.\n\n### Problem Statement:\nWhich number appears once only in the permutation of 4, 5, 1, 3, 17 and 23?\n\n### Solution:\nLet all the six numbers: 4 51 17 31 13 23 be denoted by 1,2,3,4,5,6 respectively.

A: the ficus plant is not used in the middle-east. B: the ficus plant brightens up a palace. C: the phrase brightening things up refers to an act of brightening up or doing something in order to brighten up something. e.g : the brightening up of the room was made by using the ficus plant. D: pots is the meaning for brighten in the dictionary. E: a brightening is the effect of lighting. a ficus plant may brighten up a room. but not an apartment.  the correct answer is D.  explanation of the other options: a) if this were to be a correct answer, brighten should have been the words used instead of brightens. b) brighten is a correct answer to the question. but ficus plant is not the correct meaning for brighten. the plant does no more then just brighten up a room it is not used directly to brighten up a room or room itself. c) brightened or brightens up is the meaning of the word if the word brighten has been used. but the plant does change the mood of the room or the person sitting in it. but then it is not the plant itself that brightens a room it is the effect of light of the room. d) the phrase brightening things does not mean brightening up or do ing something in order to brightens up something. it is generally used to brightening something as a response or something related to brightening something. e) ficus plants are grown to brighten up rooms, and hence it is a correct answer, but not the correct place to use it. ficus plants are potted, not grown at homes, so brightening up things in pots is incorrect. f) pots here, refers to containers, so brightening things up to mean adding sunlight into the rooms is again an incorrect option.\nSo the final answer to the question is choice option E.\n\n\n\nInput: 3000 - 3102 = -102 508 + 10", "answer": "E: apartment"}

It is as simple as whether or not to fly a kite. When the sky is cloudy, they choose to stay at home. When the sky is clear, they're off to the local stream. If a man has no idea whether or not to fish, he looks for a clear sky but, having found none, decides to stay home on the chance that the weather might improve during the morning. Once the decision to fish has been made, the clouds have no bearing at all on the fisherman's plans. Clear or cloudy, rain or shine, the man who has made up his mind to fish goes to the brook or lake; the other man stays at home. A fisherman may have a vague notion that he will go if the weather is nice, but since such a decision may be based upon some other decision or factor, it is fair to say that the weather does not decide whether or not a man fishes. He is, of course, capable of postponing his fishing until the next day or a future date, but he has no such intention. A decision reached is a decision arrived at, and decisions are seldom postponed. Whether or not to fish is a decision made solely on the weather because, once the decision is made, the weather plays no part in the outcome. It is a decision that weather makes only at the time it is made. This is most certainly not the type of decision that weather can influence or decide.\nOutput:Whether or not", "answer": "C: party"}

We need to find the smallest number of tens place for which x will exactly divisible by.\n\nLet x = 3n + 3, which is the smallest number.\n\nHence, option B is the correct answer.\n\nAnswer : The solution is ABC\nTo find the median class of a population, the population is divided up into equally sized number of parts of the entire population (called as class).\n\nFor a population of 123. We want to find what the middle class is (the median class) among the 7.\n\nBy using an extreme method, we can figure out that our middle class is: 87. We can calculate this amount by dividing the population by the number of pieces, which is the formula: (p - 1) / c. In this case: ((123 * 6) - 1) / 7 = 87\n\nAnswer : The question is asking for X, the smallest number of 6 units or less that, when added to 4, leaves a number exactly divisible by 5, not X, the smallest number 6 units or less.\n\nThe given number is 4.\n\nWe need to find the smallest positive integer x such that x + 4 gives a multiple of 5. This means x should be an integer and, 4 + x, must gives a multiple of 6.\n\nWe have to find positive x such that 4+x=5, then x= 1.\n\nSo our answer is 1.\n\nAnswer : What is the value of S?\n\nThe answer must be B.

And as the two trips are in different amounts i.e. x>3 (as the second one does not require 3 units of fuel but 3x (x>1.0x) which is x*3=6x*3.0). Hence, 3 km trip requires 1 unit of fuel therefore cost= 1  so, we need to divide by 1=0.333(approx).So the answer should be near 1/3rd of what the initial question was asking.\nSo the final answer would be \"B\"\n</p>\n \n</body>\n</html>", "answer": "A: redemption"}

Choices:  A: side B: main C: anterior D: current E: front<n>Output:		A<n><n># My Approach:<n># It uses the same logic, 18 - 9 = 9 every 9 minutes, the bus which passes him has to be 1 every 9, so in that case the distance covered is (9 - 1) every 9 - 1 = 7 minutes which is not possible, so 4 and 6 buses can be covered every 18 minutes<n><n># Approach:<n># We have to cover 18 buses in every 18 minutes and since we know the time of buses is every 6 mins (since we are going with the option that 6 is smaller), we have to divide 18 by 6 - 18 will come out to be 3. And 3 buses are 3/6 times the distance so we have to reduce the distance to 2, so we subtract 2 as we divide to get 6/3. This was the solution.<n><n><n># my solution:<n># 18 / 9 : We could cover 19 cars every 18 minutes <n># 18 - 1 : we could cover 18 cars every 18 - 6 minutes<n># 18 : we could cover 3 in an interval of 4 minutes(this method used a lot in Coding Competetions like Codeforces)<n># Solution: if we can get 3 of them, why do we need the others???<n><n># Approach-1:<n># To find the answer we need to find the time interval between consecutive of these:<n># * Buses passing (18-9)=9 every 9 mins. <n># * The bus which passes him has 1 every 9 mins<n># so we can find the distance in 18-19 minutes. 9 = 4 so we are in 9 – 4 min. <n># * We can find the distance in every 6 min. 9 = 6 so we are in 6 - 4 or 6 + 4.<n># we could check any integer between these two.<n>

This means that the cyclist will be overtaken by the bus with a constant interval.<n><n>If the cyclist is moving with constant velocity as the bus overtakes it, the cyclist will meet the bus after 2 more ticks of the clock. From 2 ticks to one more tick is 18, so the cyclist meets the bus every 18 min. Now how fast the cyclist moves in respect to the bus is not certain. So for ease let's say the cyclist moves with same velocity.<n>Now, we don't know how fast bus moves. But we know that the cyclist has to meet the overtaking bus with same speed as the overtaking bus. So the same time, the two overtaking buses would keep meeting the cyclist.<n><n>If there is no bus, then every 6 min the cyclist would move forward. Let us use the same idea for the bus. But let's note that we don't know what time of day it is. If it's the 3rd hour, then every 6 seconds, the bus meets the cyclist, who is stationary then. There is no bus in this hour, so the cyclist does nothing.<n>Let us note in a clock when there is no bus. 3AM, 6AM, 9AM... 8 hours total. So for every 6 consecutive hours, the buss with the stationary cyclist meets the cyclist and in another 6 consecutive hours, he overtakes the cyclist. The first 6 hours (h0, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5) is the period when the bus does not meet the cyclist and next consecutive 6 hour period (h4, h5, h6, h

So here total bus will be 52 and they are going to be 53 buses.<n>So the total time from 18 to 19 is (60 + (10-10.50)=50 minutes.<n>Time from the 19 to 20 is (52-10)=30<n>So the time required to go back to the starting hour is 38: 50<n>This means that the hour 19 falls at 3:40. If we take any hour, the buses from the bus we want arrives

Later you can come back and answer them)<n><n>In this quiz the time taken for cycling and stopping is the same as that of bus.<n><n>We can come to the answer by using the following steps.<n><n>1. Time taken for bus to stop is 1/6 th of 18 = 3 minutes. Since bus is going in same direction cyclist overtakes it. So he covers a extra distance of 3/3 = 1 km in 6 minutes.<n> 2. Therefore he covers a extra distance in 6 - 18 = 12 minutes<n>3. Again we can say he overtakes the following bus in 6 -12 = 4 minutes<n>4. So it covers a distance of 4 - 2/3 = 1/3 of 18 =6/3 minutes and so on in an infinite time. Since time is taken in the same time. Total time taken will be 1(first time) + 1/2(next time) + 1//3 (next time) and so on.<n>5. Therefore total duration taken until he overtakes the same bus again = infinity.<n>6. It can also be arrived at by using the property of limit of series.<n><n>Consider if we start with the sequence as: x = 1, x+ 1/6, x+ 1/(6) ^ (1/3), x+ 1/ (6) ^ (1/(3)))^2, x+ 1/( 6) ^ (1 / (3^2))<n><n>By our property of sequence. We see that each term will never repeats and never tend to infinity but the product of these infinite series will remain unchanged.<n><n>So we keep multiplying each term to get

Time taken by two vehicles passing one another.<n><n>* Input: A man cycling along the street, noticed that every 15 minutes, a bus passes him while on the other hand every 4 minutes he meets an on coming bus. If both vehicles move at constant speed, find the time interval between the consecutive buses.<n><n>* Result: D - 16 minutes<n><n>* Explanation: For one way both the vehicles will move at the same speed.<n>* Concept: When two vehicles move in the same direction, they don't overtake one another. i.e. when 15 minutes will pass, in that 15th minute the bus will overtake in the previous minute, the man will cross both the bus again and in 60th minute (15+45), the on coming bus will give him way.<n><n>#### 2.

As 30 days are in a month, 3 * 365 = three times a week -> 3 times a week<n><n>#### 3. A woman walks at the exact speed of a turtle.

There is no easy way out. :)<n><n>If I were you I'd use the debugger in your interpreter (interactive console) to try out and explore your code.<n><n>When you are using Python IDEs you can find the "breakpoint"/"debugger" option, and just set a breakpoint at the line you want to observe.<n><n>As soon you have the breakpoint set (breakpoint)<n><n>you will see the line, with a special icon(indicator) below it.<n>Then just step through the code with the "Step over" button.<n>In this way you should be able to find out what happens with the variables values.<n><n>(a debugger can also give you more information about the values of these variables, and more. But step over will just let you check the values on the command line, as the interpreter execute the statements in the program and run to the breakpoint.)<n><n>There's also a lot of info about debugging on the python website (http://docs.

Then, this function should call the function passed as an argument and should print the numbers returned as a result. A function is considered to return the numbers if it returns an integer that is a multiple of the number 3. For instance, a function that returns 1, 2, 4, 14 should return 3. In addition, this function must also print the number of functions whose results are multiples of the number 3 that are in the array, that is, the return value of the following function is 4:<n><n>findNums(function)<n><n>Your function should be able to handle arrays of different sizes. For example, If the input is:<n><n>function, num, [7,8,9]<n><n>it means the user passes a function, num and an array containing integers, such that the length of the array is 3 and the elements of the array are between 7 and 9.

For example, the String "Hello" should print "H" while the String "hELLo" should print "e". You should be able to handle Strings of sizes up to 10. For this function, you should also keep in mind that the input of this function could also be a String. Write a function called "findString", that takes two inputs,

It has challenging problems for both juniors and seniors to participate.<n><n>### What is Kattis?<n>Kattis is an online web-based system for developing and hosting programming challenges, and an automated contest platform for competitive programming competitions. Kattis is available at kattis.fi (available only for registered contestants/teams) and kattis.org, the contest site, which is open to the general public.<n><n>### Why build Kattis?<n>There were no easy ways to host or participate in a programming contest. The main reasons for building Kattis were:<n><n>- Programming contests are great for practicing different kind of techniques from competitive programming. There are great problems and competitions but they all suffer from different disadvantages. Kattis wanted to be the "one stop shopping" to solve this problem.<n>- Most of these problems were also quite difficult to create. There's a huge barrier to entry to create a challenge and it's very hard to share even between the organizers. Kattis wanted an easy way to create problems, share them, and participate.<n>- There are also contests but there is still a challenge to get people's attention. Kattis solved this problem by making the online experience smooth and attractive.<n>

Choices : A : nothing B: a little, C: a lot D: None, E: more<n>Output : A<n>### Instruction:<n><n>Answer the next multiple choice questions<n><n>Input: I got this question wrong because i thought that the output should be a. Which choice is wrong?<n>Output: (A)<n><n>Input: I will try to give an explanation and I hope it can help!<n>Output: (B)<n><n>Input: Here’s the question that made me think that the output should be (D) but, alas, is wrong. Here it is, with my false reasoning: a) how about 21 ÷ 50 = 1/4? b) how about 2 and 4 ÷ 5 = 1/2 4/10 = 2/5 = 1/5 (and, again, you cannot convert from a fraction to a repeating decimal).<n>Output: (B), but a different choice than I thought!<n><n>Input: So, here I thought that the only way B could be an answer is if the number of women is not divisible by the number of men, hence I thought (C) was the (only) "safe" option, but here it seems not.<n><n>I still can't figure out what makes (D) an incorrect answer, maybe is because the total number of women is greater than the total number of men?<n><n>Output: (C) <n><n>Input: So… I think I now understand what makes this a trick question! Because of rule 1, 7504/2502 ≠ 3/2, so it doesn’t satisfy rule 2 and the only remaining option would be (D). <n><n>This is confusing to the brain, because if we are considering an infinite number of (in this case 50) women/men, I would expect (B) to be the correct answer, but alas!<n><n>

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: a man cycling along the road noticed that every 18 minutes a bus overtakes him and every 6 minutes he meets an oncoming bus. if all buses and the cyclist move at a constant speed, what is the time interval between consecutive buses? a ) 5 minutes, b ) 6 minutes, c ) 8 minutes, d ) 9 minutes, e ) 10 minutes<n>Output: d<n><n>Input:Where can you find a movie theater along with other stores in one placE? Choices:  A: downtown area B: urban area C: new york city D: shopping mall E: military base<n>Output:		c<n><n>### Solution<n><n>The question is asking what is the time interval (or time between over passes) of all buses. In this case, there is no information given about the length of the road:<n><n>We know from geometry that a line segment with two endpoints has two points on it.<n><n>We have six over passes that happen, so we know there are 5 different buses. The time between over passes has to be even because we have an even number of times something happens. We can pick out the first two passes:<n><n>We can figure out the time between the two passes since we know how long it took since they last passed:<n><n>The time between passes is 2(6) minutes. The time between over-passes has been answered now<n><n>The question is about the time between consecutive buses, since they are in cycles it has to be the reciprocal of the period. Since the answer is in units of minutes, then the answer is the reciprocal of minutes:<n><n>The first bus is passed every 18 minutes, which is 18/60. The second bus is then passed every 6 minutes, so that is 6/18 of a bus.<n><n>### Reference:<n>https://www.toppr.com/ask/question/if-a-man-cycling-along-the-road-notices-that-every-18-minutes-a-bus-overtakes-him-and-every-6-minutes-he-meets-an-oncoming-bus-if-all-bus-and-the-cyclist-move-at-constant-speed-what-is-the-time-interval-between-consecutive-buses-a-5-minutes-b-6-minutes<n><n>https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/505284/the-interval-between-two-consecutive-time-intervals<n><n>

If the maximum running speed of the train is 90 kilometers per hour, what is the minimum running speed to maintain the schedule?<n><n>#### **Problem Statement :**<n><n>* At first I started by creating an array called times. Array times has 4 different entries, 1 for when it's going from Dadar to Mumbai station, 2 for when its going from Mumbai to Khar, 3 for when its going from Khar to Mumbai and 4 for Khar to Dadar. I filled in the times by first converting them into seconds: 5*60 + 4*60 + 2*60 + 3000 = 3200, 4*72 + 5*60+ 2*60 = 2700, 2*72 + 4*68+ 3*66 = 3203, 3*72 + 1*70 = 3690. So then,<n><n>we have 4 entries, (let's say,) 3200 for the time it takes to go from Dadar to Khar, 2700 for the time from Khar to Mumba, 3203 for the time from Mumbai Khar and finally 3203 from Khar to Dadra.<n><n>Now the problem was that when I was given times such as, 5*, 18 and 3000 I thought to them as the time it takes for the train move from Dadara to Mumbai (in the opposite direction that would be Mumbai to Dadra ) So for the time from Dadra to Mumbai and from Mumbai to Dardara I need to subtract the time from Dadar to Dadra. To do so, I used the following syntax: for(i=times.size()-2; i>=0 ; i--){<n>        if(i==times.size

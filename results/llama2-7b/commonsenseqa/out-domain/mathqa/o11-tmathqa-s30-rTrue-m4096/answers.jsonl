{"idx": 41, "text": "\"A: Bald eagles are primarily birds of prey and like other birds of prey live in a habitat that can provide them with the best opportunity to hunt. In the wild this habitat is a mature pine tree. For bald eagles in northern areas of their range, the pine is the primary bird community. Open country is used when needed to hunt smaller prey. If a bald eagle becomes seriously injured, a bald eagle will often go into hiding, often in a tree. Some bald eagles have been found in abandoned buildings. Bald Eagles are very sensitive to human scent and will often hide in the woods if they see a human coming. Bald Eagles love the water and are often seen swimming and fishing from their lairs in trees. A bald eagle usually returns to its breeding range around 6 years of age. In this time the bird will travel hundreds of miles to gain adult weight and to establish a territory. This may involve crossing desert and mountain areas and many times in the winter the bird may travel through the city of Washington enroute to its breeding range, usually to a small island like the san juan islands located near the state of Washington.\"\nSo the final answer in the above case is A\n\nAnswer:\n12\n\nInstruction:\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nAnswer:\n\n13\n\nInstruction:Input:\n\nAn ice-cream cone is the shape of an ellipse, the long axis is 10cm, what is the radius of the circle where its tip is?

The condition of acid reflux can be defined as the return of stomach contents upwards into the esophagus. Stomach contents include partially digested food, chewed food (saliva, etc.), acid, and pepsin. The digestive system produces gastric acids. The acids normally help in the digestion process along with pepsin enzymes. The acidity of the food is adjust to suit the taste of human. If the acidity becomes too strong, it can irritate the lining of the esophagus and inflame it. This is commonly known as gastro esophageal reflux (GER).

{"idx": 116, "text": "\"A: picnic\"\nSo the final solution is a\n\nInput:Sometimes called the \"Luck\" of the Draw, this is a procedure of awarding resources that can be used in turn based games based upon an arbitrary order. It comes from the idea that one never knows if they will get to take a move next and since turns are taken in a specific order, this means those who can choose (who draws first) will always have an advantage. In turn based games, this allows players from different factions (units) to receive the same or different resources at the same time, allowing the players to interact with the resources on a fair basis.\n\nSometimes, this procedure can have it's own drawbacks. For instance, while no player may \"win\" beforehand, it can be that the player who draws last may not have enough to keep him in the fight, as most players will receive more resources over the course of time.\n\nAnswer: A - In turn based games, the turn-order is determined randomly. This randomness is called the \"Draw.\" Depending on the game system, a \"Draw\" could represent the beginning of a turn, the drawing of cards, the beginning of a player's turn, or a random determination of the order for resolving resources, moves, or other actions.\n\nSo the correct answer is a in the option", "answer": "B: friend's house"}

{"idx": 176, "text": "A: Aggression B: Cacophony C: Exhibit D: Gag E: Invective Choices are B,E,C,A. The reason: Agreement leads others to agree more. Finding your own answer may involve a little experimenting to see if your idea leads to someone else agreeing with you. B & D are out, because what could be more disconcerting that when you are talking about something totally unconnected, someone brings in the thing about which you are still talking and says Aha! you must agree with my point. Only because no agreement could be reached, because there was nothing on which both could reach an agreement. A is also out, which would be the best answer to give to a casual remark. It would stop others from saying something. C is out for the same reason as A. You would talk only when you had something to say. D does not even begin to be possible; someone cannot even possibly misunderstand or mishear what you said, when you do not talk about anything but, say, the weather. That reduces the list to just B and E. The last reason of course is to learn something about the people in the conversation you are having.\nNow, if you find it hard to choose between B and E, try the following, after a little experimenting. When you are talking about yourself, and you have something that concerns you, a friend and yourself may agree about something important that really happens to you. You did not perhaps know you felt the way you felt. So at least one person thinks you may have learnt something new. Now ask a friend if anyone ever misunderstands, misunderstands and mishears what you say. He may be in too big a hurry to know that he can't understand, but he will at least know that you had something you wanted to tell him. Now take a moment to read about Bias (cognitive bias). You will see that some people make up their minds without having any idea at all of what it is you are talking about. So if they misunderstand what you say, it will be all for the worse, because they may end up in a discomfort caused by your saying something that they misunderstood for something else. Finally, a good tip (from an article I read, can't remember exactly when) is to never ever begin by saying what you are going to talk about. (Although such articles", "answer": "E: learning about"}

Now, the bounce is at 6m/s, with a horizontal displacement is in upward direction. 6m/s is given as initial velocity, with 2.4m/s of negative velocity. Hence the time is 2.4-6s = 3.6s 6 = -2.6s 2.6s - 3.6s = 1s\nb) 6m/s with a negative displacement of 6m/s + 3m/s = 9m/s Now 2m/s is the upward displacement, with 2m/s of negative horizontal displacement.

Coal and wood are two substances that are often combustible to produce heat as a result of combustion; and coal and wood are both called fossil fuels, meaning that neither are natural renewable resources, and that both come primarily from buried organic matter. Heat produced by combustion of coal and wood have both been used by mankind for decades to keep warm, cook food, and keep homes and various spaces, such as factories, buildings, etc., warm. A lava or fluid that is molten is produced by volcanos. Lava is a substance that is often found on volcanoes, and lava is often characterized by its fluid form which is produced by volcanic activity.\nA sun is typically known for emitting energy from light on a planet or other celestial body's surface. In other words, a sun, which is a celestial body, is able to radiate electromagnetic radiation from its atmosphere, and the sun, as stated above, primarily emits light energy. The Earth, and other celestial bodies, can be warmed by the Sun since it emits light energy, and when the light energy from a sun's atmosphere hits other celestial bodies that can be warmed by light energy, as seen in a process also called the greenhouse effect.\nFire is characterized by its ability to burn or to melt materials, but can also be seen as being a result of a chemical reaction called a fire.

So no air from the atmosphere around us is truly ever new. However in cities, industrial centres etc. we do get air that has not passed around for too long, so in those places we find \"fresh\" air. \"Fresh\" air in those places, however, is polluted. This \"fresh\" air is not \"fresh\". So I am not really sure why \"fresh\" air has been chosen as a clue. \n\nOutput in response to the solution with answer D,\n\nA: An indoor train station could have recently breathed by only a couple of people or an entire station could be used by tens or millions of people in a day. Also the air in any living-space is not ever new. The air we breathe will have been breathed in by every member of your family/group or not been breathed in for a long time which will be quite stale.\nB: A house does not exist in a vacuum, the outside is always inside it. This means that the air inside a house can't be really fresh anyway. Not because the air inside has just been new, but because the air all around has been breathed by tons of people for a long time. This applies to any house which is located in a city/industrial centre etc. If your house is located in a field/forest or somewhere really secluded, at least the air in your house can be considered more recently fresh. Even though the air in that house might not be considered fresh, because the air that has entered from the outside to make up the majority of the air in the house will not have been as fresh as the air which is inside your immediate local area.\nC: A cupboard or a drawer might not have been opened (and breathed by) in a long time, but the air in the entire house will have been breathed all day by hundreds of thousands of people. It might have been fresher or perhaps dirtier than the air inside the drawer, but it would be better to breath fresh air in some other place outside the house.\nD: The air around a cricket stadium will already have been breathed in many other places around the city, and so will be probably stale.

The answer to this question is A, BUT do note that 127 is not a prime number! Why?

What total would they have to pay if they ride the carriage for one mile? Choices:  F: 28 g: 29 h: 30 j: 31\nOutput:How much total would they have to spend if they take the carriage? One carriage ride costs 3/5 of the two men's share of the mile. But a man can take a carriage by paying 1/3 of the cost. Therefore, one man can take four times the number of carriage rides compared to the other. So, the other pays 4/5 of the one-man-share. That means, the two would pay 1/5 of the one man's cost each. So, after riding a mile, the two men would have to pay 1/(3/5) of half the total cost. Or, they would have to pay 2/(3/5) times of the original cost. Therefore, the total charge can be 2/(3/15)=2/3.

In order to generate one of the primes, the numbers must be generated randomly (between 0 and 100) and one more number will be required to represent the largest number for that. If the largest number was 99, and we have generated a number within that same range, we just need to test that with the code the solution uses to determine the new prime, otherwise the number will be one that we previously used.

Choices:  A. True B. False\nOutput: \"The statement A = 1 + B holds and is true. The number B is called an offset. For a basic system with three channels, the offset of channel A would be found by taking the maximum output level of channel B, offsetting up by the number of steps needed to make it into the range of A, and subtracting that by the maximum output level of B. Whenever we find the offset value of a channel, it is always subtracted by the maximum output level. There are two common places where we will make use of this. In the first place, the number of steps necessary in our first channel is determined by the offsets of the two other channels.

Choosing \"wait turn\" simply makes no sense, since that's what everyone who's not in line is doing.\nso the ans. is A\nThis question is interesting in two senses:\n  * It demonstrates how well Lisp works as a language for developing text games.\n  * It is a classic text-game problem which allows one to test how effectively one has learned the lessons from [PDP-10] and [A-H].\n \n1. One of the keys to testing your knowledge of [PDP-12] and [M-L] is the way this question provides an easy way for you to test your skills using the techniques covered in this chapter.\n2. The goal of this puzzle is to figure out that the lines are all numbered. You are supposed to walk along the line, so that walking up and then up again takes you to where you first met the lines. To do this, you need to have a \"map\" in your head, where there is a line from point A representing \"up\" to point B representing \"up again\" (both points are already known, although the exact position isn't important), while both B and C are just points representing a place where a walk up and a walk up again can intersect. From there you'd count the number of lines that go from A to C by starting out with A at the point where you started and walking up to a point, then walking up again to another point, and repeating until you get to a point which goes to A. If you end up getting 10, you probably have enough lines to make a map which is guaranteed to be correct.\n3. The puzzle is so simple that an automated computer-solver can solve it in about a tenth of a second, so a program has to take a very clever approach to solving it. One problem is that the program has to know it's talking to a person, and be able to tell if the person is following instructions and reading the map or if the person is just trying to guess. That's a hard problem because it involves recognizing \"intent\" of the person. To make this problem easier, I've forced the program to answer a different question for each \"version\" of", "answer": "E: anger"}

Also the user enters n so in our case n = 2 so it should calculate for the number 2 and not the value of the array for this we use the length of the n and the value for n both of these values are stored in the array named k1, k2, k3 which is created during the execution. After iteration we print the value of the last element of the array.\n\nInput: find all the factorial of \"4!\".\nOutput: \"24 \"\nSo the final answer for \"4!\" is 24\n\nInput: Find the factorial for the value \"68\".\nOutput: 70410260\nSo the final answer of the \"68\" is 7041\n\n### Instraction: The above problem can simply be solved recursively but we can further increase the speed of the program and decrease the time consumed by decreasing the number of iterations. After solving for a value we print the value of last elemnt in the array.\n\n### Instructions:We will implement the above problem in java by using for loop. \nOutput:\na = 6528\nb = 3804\nc = 4320\nd = 1296\ne = 112\nf = 12\ng = 36\nh = 9\n\n### Instuctions:\nInput: A set consists of only distinct strings which are alphabets. In our problem we consider an alphabet to be anything that is accepted by the scanner. For example \"-\" and \"#\" are also considered as alphabets. For this problem, we will use for loop to iterate the set and store every character/element of the set in an array. After iterating the set we will print the elements of array.", "answer": "C: wyoming"}

{"idx": 928, "text": "Solution : This one should be pretty easy to solve. Let's see. An icebox contains ice, which needs to be stored at a temperature which is below 10 degrees Celcius. Ice would melt in the graveyard, which would affect the earth to such an extent, that the graveyard would have to be dug up. Also, the ice box would be worthless in an antique shop. So the box would need to keep the ice below 10 degrees and at the same time store it. The kitchen is the place where icebox is generally found. Also the kitchen has space below 10 degrees, i.e. freezer. A broken icebox cannot be sold for a good amount due to it being broken. So, why not sell it to a junk yard.

Then we have to do some simple division using the fractions and it looks like this. We\u2019re gonna say the full size pickup\u2019s bin can hold 16 of them and that\u2019s because 320 divided by 1200 I\u2019m gonna convert this to a fraction, so this is what we\u2019ve got. 320, divided by 12, which is 20, divided by another 12, which will be 10 1200 320 divided 12 10 10 divided by 2 10 and this simplifies to 001 - it\u2019s not a whole number 001 -.

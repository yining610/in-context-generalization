{"idx": 32, "text": "Answer: D. Let's suppose the choice for A or B was incorrect. First neighborhood and subdivisions aren't gated off from anyone. You'd be able to walk away from a gated neighborhood or subdivision and there will be another neighborhood or subdivision on the other side. There's nothing gated in a city. When you enter a city, which is often fenced, you are going to either be driving on open roads, or you'll take a narrow side street. It's not gated from city to city. There's no gated area to a suburb, so to answer to suburb would be the correct answer.\n\nSuburbs are often built around gates, so there are some suburbs that are gated. But just because you find a suburb that's gated off doesn't mean it's on the same block as the neighborhood or subdivision that's gated away from everything! So when you find a gated suburb, you have to decide if you want to keep looking, or if you want to stop looking. The only place where you may find a gated street is in a city.\nSo you should have to look at city streets. If you find a city street that's gated, then you've found your answer, but if your city has gates but no streets that are gated, you may not find this in the end, but you've got to keep looking for gated city streets. If you are lucky and you find a gated city street that makes an e-w loop, then you have found you answer. So if there is a gated suburbs for a street doesn't mean you'll find a street that gated that goes into that suburb, so you got to keep looking. If you find a suburb then you're looking for a street that gated. Then you still got to keep looking for a street in the city that is gated even if you have not found a street that is gated, if you find a street that is gating you have found the answers. If you cannot then, the answer is D: you have to start looking in city streets. If this process takes too long, you may just find a whole other answer because in a city you often have multiple gated roads. It's up to you to find every possible road in a city that is", "answer": "B: subdivision"}

Here is my Java attempt which also fails but not for the same reason as Python. I'm guessing the original issue was caused by the fact that the strings in the lines are surrounded by \" \", but that should still be parsed correctly in both Java and Python, IMO. https://ideonecom/ZUXDg1\n\nComment: So the input string must include one or more lines, and these lines can only contain the words that are within the dictionary? For example, I could be on a planet with a very small number of inhabitants, and the dictionary was limited to one letter English (upper or lower case). And the string should only contain 100 characters or less. But I think you can use the same string as input by removing one or more words within each line and keeping the rest of the letter case/spacing/punctuation and spacing of the lines the same.\n\nComment: @ThomasAndrews The problem states that the answers will not follow the format that I have shown", "answer": "B: polished"}

There is a way to show this, but it needs more than 4 space. Here is how that method works: It can be proven that a bike costs $143.00, plus $4.10, plus $0.60. Now round $4.10 to the nearest amount possible. Now apply the rule that one extra cents doesn't count.  ( $4.10 = 4 *.10 +.10 = $4.10 ) And the bike costs $184.68, rounded to the nearest exact amount, or $184, rounded up. So you need $4.50 to get to $184 and $4.50 + $4.10 + $0.60 = $143.60 exactly. If you round off to the nearest even amount before you add the $4.10 and $0.60, you end up at $143.30. The extra amount, though? $143.50.

So there is no way it could possible fail. The result is always going to be a 0 because of the way we do the math. So we just choose a different answer and no one will know the truth. It was very interesting on earth but if you got a positive negative for the input then the output was true. If you got two true boolean values then the output was false. It is all based on the input. Here at heaven, we have only two true boolean values but what does that mean? It means that we can always assume the positive of the two true boolean values always results in 0 and the negative of the two true boolean results in 1 because what would the opposite of 0 really mean? So we want to take this a step further (don't worry, no more true or false, its only going to be math from here on out). What we do is find the average of the two values.

What is your guess for the overall average amount of canned goods per family contributed at the drive?\n\nOutput: I figured that most people would not be giving too many canned goods to the drive since the last thing that everyone needed to be doing was taking more things out of their cabinets. They may not make another donation to the drive for at least a week, due to the food drive taking up all their time and energy.

However, if it were a stray or an outdoor animal, it would be the animal shelter or pet shop. Answer choice b, because I think that the owner should be responsible for the dog. if the dog is going to walk around the streets he should be put down. Answer choice D, because a dog should be purchased with money. the person of the dog should be aware of what might happen ( if not, ask yourself, did my dog have vaccinations ; did he have rabies ; will this dog be a good guard dog ; is he a good house pet etc.? ) The question of the people responsible for the dog are endless. therefore, this question is pointless. Answer choice B, because dogs should be taken care of like your pets, but this is not possible all the time. There is no guarantee that the dog does not walk away. Furthermore, the owner should be responsible and aware of what is needed to keep the dog happy and healthy. An animal shelter or animal rescue is better for dogs that are homeless. However, if I find a dog on the streets, I have to say yes. the animal shelter does it for free and the best way to get dogs to leave their homes is through word of mouth. they also do things for the animals such as check them for fleas and ticks, keep the kennel cool, keep the kennels clean, keep their vaccinations current, and give the kennels lots of exercise.

There are many reasons why a dog should not be in a dog show. First, not everyone is interested in dogs. So your dog may become stressed when people do not see his dog as a \"special\" one. It is also important to ensure that the dog is treated well. Dogs can also get sick at shows from bacteria, viruses and diseases. Dogs can get sick or even", "answer": "B: animal shelter"}

{"idx": 796, "text": "A\nSo the final answer should be A\n\nInstruction:You are given a code in a specific format: a character, followed by a digit 0 - 9, a hyphen, and a digit. For example:\n\nCode  15594-6-9\n\nYou can choose to print out the encoded word, to decode the characters, or to find out the number of the code. For example:\nIf you decode the 1st part of sample 1, the encoded word is MOM. So if you pick 1 as a command, your output must include the word MOM.\nIf you decode the first 4 digits 1559 of sample 1, you should get the number 5959. So if you pick the 4 as a command, your response must be a 4 digit number.\nIf you decode ALL digits in sample 1, you will get the number of the code ( the sample number ) 15594. So if you pick decode digit, you will give the digits of the code in response.\nYou may choose any choice you like. But your answer must be in response format.\nInput:Choose your command first. Then, the rest will follow. The sample code will aid you.\n\nOutput:If you are on the \"Decryption\" program, the decrypted word \"MOM\" will print first. If you are on the \"Number of code\" program, the code's number (that is, 1559) will print first. If it is a \"Decrypt all\" program, the 1559 will print all first.\nSo the final answer need to print the first word (the original encoded word) that is:\n\nMOM\n\nwhich means that the answer has to be : MOM \n\nInstruction:This is a problem in English.\n\n1.

I wasn't trying to say that the answer given was wrong, I was trying to figure out if it was correct.\n\nComment: @user329656: I didn't downvote you.\n\nAnswer: You don't need to re-implement every single algorithm you'll use in your coding test. That's what a standard library is for (think C++ libraries or Python libraries, etc.).\n\nWhat you need is to know the data structure you'll be using in your test. Often, you'll just be given an array of integers or a few integer array of integers at most.\n\nWhat you can then do is import whatever data structures you decide you need from your standard library, and implement them. In your case, the solution is not so simple because you'll have to build up your custom data structure from raw data. Fortunately, even that task doesn't have to be too daunting. After all, you're allowed to write more code than your problem requires, so in effect, you're allowed about one page of code for every question to do whatever you want! (So if there's 10 questions and you're a fast programmer, it's 10 pages of code to do what you want.)\n\nWhat you can do is build up a dictionary that stores information, such as input arrays, input questions, output questions, and the answers. When you see an input question, you can look into your dictionary and figure out the information you'll need to store your question variables. Then, you can do whatever problem it is using the information you've gotten. Afterwards, when you input the output questions, when there's an output question that matches one of the input questions you've stored, you can load whatever information you need into the question variables and solve it. When it's over, you can print out the final results in a human-readable fashion like putting the", "answer": "C: ignorance"}

Explanation: It is stated that:  - James kept a clipboard where  he could easily find  'it'. - He could easily find 'it' because  he kept it on his desk. The question asks us WHERE  might James keep the clipboard. 'It' cannot be anywhere other than his desk. If James kept the clipboard on another location  then he would not be able to easily find it. Only locations where he could easily find it were considered as options. Hence,  the best possible answer is: 'A': shelf - He could EASILY find the clipboard on his shelf - but this is an option which  cannot be eliminated until the clipboard on the shelf is considered.  - A: place of work - We cannot have the location which is not mentioned  in the question. Hence, this answer can be eliminated from the answer options.  - C: desk  - He did not have 'it' ON his desk  - Hence he could not easily find 'it' or he would have a difficult time looking for 'it'. - C: desk is an incorrect answer choice because it is not mentioned  in which room James kept his desk; the correct answer is 'E': school  - 'at the school' option is incorrect because the question is not about what  James might have kept at school.

The character in play has a certain set of traits (such as 3 ears, 2 eyes, and 6 legs). If at the beginning of the game a player knows which character he is hiding, how many total questions is he guaranteed to ask in order to determine the identity of his opponent?\nOutput:A\n1)\n1. In Guess Who, the question which you asked was whether or not the other person has a certain type of characteristic. Each characteristic in the character's set is binary (either true or false), but you also have to consider that the same characteristics can be in opposite places. \n2. So if there were 6 eyes, and then the opponent answered that they have 2 (which is false), then they definitely have 6 ears. If they said 4 ears, then they have both 6 ears and 2 eyes (a common example). \n3. So you already know that the characteristics for the other player has both 6 ears and at least 2 eyes. If they said that they do not have those two traits, or that they don't have any of it, they couldn't be this person. \n4. Now you have three characteristics left. If they have all three types (true), that tells you what they are not. So now we can only have one trait. If there are 6 arms and legs, they could either NOT have any arms or legs, or they have one arm and one leg. Since they said they don't have either, and you only get one choice, choose that they do not have an arm or a leg. \n5", "answer": "A: sail boats"}

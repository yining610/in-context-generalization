What time was her mother in labor? Let each hour be an hour and minute be 1/6 that hour. (30/60) = 3/20 = 1/10. The sum of all the twins was 6. Hence, the sum of each set was 3. Therefore, each set had 2 twins. 12 = 1+x+x+1 where x is 1. 6 = 1/2+x+x+0 where x is 2. 6 = 0+0+x+x+x where x is 3. The 12 was 6+6. The 6 was 1+1. The 6 was x+x. That last one is the set when her mother was in labor. (2x-1)/2 (the 1 in the last set being in the 10th hour.) The x = 2/10 = 1/5. The time in the second set being the number 1 on the 10th (or 5th) hour. That means the time in the last set, when her mother was in labors, would be 1+1+5 = 7 hours after midnight. The 7 hours after mid night was between which hours? This problem didn't really make any logical sense. The answer was an unexplained variable. I figured that the 7 hours needed to be 4, but they gave me 7 - x. So my methodology was: if this problem was correct, then that implies that the 7-x was wrong. So I would solve the first three parts of the problem this way and see if it leads me to the same answer it gives: 1) What time was the lunch set to be served? (1:30 AM) 2) How much food did the chef remove from the cooler? (8 hours and 9 minutes) 3) When was the final hour when food remained? (6:31 AM) 4) How much food was there still in the cooler?

( blood vessels and artery )  capillaries are the smallest blood vessel in the human body. they are found all over the human body.  They join smaller veins and arteries to carry blood from the heart to the different parts of the body. The smallest arteries then turn into capillaries then to the smallest veins which join these up to carry blood back to the heart. A capillary is where two things meet. in the human body, blood vessels meet at a capillary. a capillary therefore can be a blood vessel.  a capillary might break during a soccer game, in the same way as an artery can break, or a vein, or any of the blood vessels of the human body.\"\nSo the answer in this case is A\n\nInput: What is the sum of the four digits of a number? 2-digit 3-digit 4-digit A: 55 B: 78 C: 119 D: 788 E: 44\nOutput: \"a 6 -digit numbers has the form 555555. the sum of the four ( 6 ) digits, excluding the sum of the last two digits, is 7776 ; the sum of the four last digits, excluding the last digit, is 6666 ; the sum of  the second last two digits is 5555  ( the 2 digits are 5 and 5 )  ; the sum of the 2 last digits is 3366. answer : B.\"\nSo the Final answer is B\n\nInput: The temperature of a place at 7:30 am one cold winter day was above freezing.

Therefore, you would have gone through the entire 10-hour space 290 times between 9:00 a.m. and noon. But noon is 0.5 of the time between 9:0.0 and 9:0.5, and that would leave you going through the space 10 times between noon and 1:05:0/2, or between 1:02:50/2 and 1:04:0/2, which requires that you walk (10 hour space x 20 minutes/hour) 6.25 times between 1:00:0/2 and 2:00:0.5. This is the only way to go through the 10-space in 90 minutes, unless you have done a partial, 8/12, rotation.\n        Output : When both hands reach this point, the hour hand has moved through the 10 spaces 6 times, has gone once around the space 9 times, and has had 2 turns through the space 8 times, making 25 turns through the 10 space. To go through the space 90 minutes, you need 25 times 4 minutes or 100 minutes, making it two hours, a half an hour before", "answer": "B: plane"}

Choices: \n1. D: A: A circle is a two-dimensional object whose shape resembles the shape of a doughnut. The circumference of a circle is a continuous path that is equal to the diameter of the circle. The diameter of a circle is a line that passes through the center of the circle and splits it into two equal halves. The circumference of the circle is the distance that the line, which is the diameter of the circle, passes through the entire circumference of the circle. The circumference of any circle is equal to its diameter. So the circumference of the circle should be half as big as its diameter. The diameter of a given circle is defined by the diameter-to-perimeter ratio. It is the measure of the difference between the diameter and the perimeter of the circle. It can be shown that the area of the circle is half of its diameter, which is the same as the perimeter of a square. This formula can be applied to the area of a circle. The formula is usually used with a circle whose diameter is the diameter of a rectangle whose sides are equal to the radius of the circle\nOutput: \"it is B : A circle is a two dimensional object that resembles the shape and shape of a circle. The diameter of the circle is the diameter ( length ) of the circle.The circumference of the circle = pi * d where the d is the diameter of the given circle.\nThe diameter is defined as the distance between the center and the edge of the circle, and it is measured by the diameter-to -area ratio.\nThe area of the circle of a given shape is a proportion to the area of the circle of the diameter-to - perimeter ratio, so the area of the circle = PI * diameter / radius of the circle\nThe area of a circle whose sides are equal to a given diameter of the circle and the diameter is the diameter-to- area ratio. So if you need to find the area of the area of the radius of the circle, you need to divide the diameter by the radius of a given circle, which results in a formula for finding\narea of circles whose sides are equal to", "answer": "E: plantation"}

Similarly 15/3 is also divided among members to produce a certain unit of speed in each member and the unit of speed of one member is equal to half of 20/15 of one member and the remaining are shared in 3 ways.\nThus a's speed = 20/14 of a member's speed.\nThe same thing will apply to b, we will see the ratio between speed and 4 / 14.", "answer": "C: police station"}

I know it is either 17, because it will change back and forth anytime I rearrange the numbers. So the largest multiple of 3 in the average is 13.  If I can use 13 instead of 17 for the average, I can only use 2 in the final number and only 2 times 3 leaves me with the number 6, which is in fact not a multiple of 9 so I can not use it in the final average.  So I have to use only multiples of 3 in the final average. the largest multiple of 8 would then have to be used instead of 13 as the average for I will have 3 2 9 6 and finally 8 as the average.  Therefore my answer is D because if it is either A or E the average cannot be a multiple of 9  and A and E are the same and D is the only option that has the difference of 8 (17-9) as answer.\"\n\n\nInput:What fraction of the classroom could be filled with 30 children, no one sitting next to the door and no two", "answer": "D: home depot"}

{"idx": 121, "text": "\"Skin contact can cause various painful results depending on the situation. The skin may become hot due to friction or heat (from hot objects). This may be called \"a burn\" or \"bee stings\" (from foreign objects). In case of overexcitation, it may become cold, such as in shock (from shock), frostbite (from hypothermia), or frostbite (due to frostbite). At the moment when the skin is touched, the nerves immediately send a signal to the brain. According to the temperature of the skin near the center of the nerve, it has a feeling of itching, cold, pressure, and bumpy skin.\nAnswer: choice (c) Itching - The answer to the question of whether the skin will be pinched is no. This choice is true.\n\nSkin is stretched. The body's tissue is constantly producing a very small amount of fluids containing salt and water. This fluid is known as the interstitial fluid. If the skin is deformed more than usual, excess interstitial fluid flows out of the affected areas. As a result, water will be drawn out of the body. The skin can experience pain, cold and moisture. This is called \"itchiness,\" and this answer is that this answer is true.\n\nThe skin is cut. Wound healing occurs naturally in the body. As part of the natural healing process, when the body damages itself, damaged tissues are broken down into their chemical components and then absorbed into the body and replaced with new tissues. However, if something enters a wound, such as germs, the immune system will attack and cause swelling and itching to destroy it. This is what is referred to as inflammation, and the answer to this choice is an inflammation called 'infection'.\n\nAnswer: choice (d). The burning sensation results from damage of the nervous system cells. When skin is pinched or pressed in some way, nerve endings are pressed, causing the same nerve signals that cause pain to fire. If this damaged nerve is exposed to a foreign body, such as bacteria, it becomes inflamed. The answer for (c) is true: Itching\n\"\n\nInput: \"The number of positive integer solutions to the equation 8x -", "answer": "B: feel pressure"}

Choices: 1. Subtracting two positive integers with the \u201c+\u201d sign is not defined until post-C programming language. 2. The \u201c+\u201d sign is standard for subtraction in both pre- and post-C. 3. The \u201c+\u201d and \u201c-\u201d signs can both be used to indicate addition and subtraction in C-language programs. 4. In both C and pre-C, positive subtraction was indicated with a \u201c-\u201d sign. Choice: 1\nOutput:Subtracting two positive numbers with a \"+\" sign is not actually defined in any programming language. This is because a minus sign with a positive value just means \"add the two numbers together.\" (The minus sign with a negative value just means \"subtract the two numbers.\") So in the beginning, they didn't have a problem with this, because a \"+\" sign was already being used to mean \"add the two numbers.\"\n\nSo the final answer here is :Option 3\n\nInput: Which graph best represents x^2+2x+x^2?

There are lots of variables with this question so I should simplify my answer as much as possible, such as using a range.  The food must be fresh, but I can assume the food stays fresh for one day.  So I need to calculate how long it takes to eat it during one day, after we say the average dog comes home  to start eating immediately after work.  A 45 lb dog eats about half a pound of food a day.  A 35 lb dog eats 500 grams of food a day.  25 lb dog eats half a pound of meat every night.  So now that you have the average, I need to calculate how much food a dog needs in one day.  A 4 oz can of food has 10 calories a serving.  One gram of protein or fat has 4 calories, so all other variables will be converted to these units.\nOutput: \"dog 45 4 x 30 = 120 gram ; 35 5 x 30 =150 gram ; 25 6 x 30 =90 gram average = sum of 45 4 oz x 30 =  120 + 35 5 oz x 39 = 225 + 25 6 oz x 31 = 90 cal = 400 cal = 1600 24 hours 1600 / 24 = 66 g / day \u2248 1600 g/d\"\nSo the answer for the questions 1 and 2 was c 400 gram\n\n\nInput: 13% of 10,000\nOutput:\"13% of 5000 would be ( 13 / 100 x 5000 ), or 5080\"\nSo the answer was c", "answer": "D: idaho"}

And to finally select a green sock, you must choose 2 green socks after choosing other socks for n-times(n-1). Because there are two red socks, you must choose two green socks out of total 3 socks.(n-1) means after choosing one red sock, you must select another green sock to choose a final green sock. As a reminder, after choosing 2 red socks, we choose 2 blue socks and 2 green socks. In this case, there are total 3 socks, of which there is 2 green socks and 1 red or blue sock. So the probability of choosing a green sock is n/3 times 2/3(n-1)/3(n-2)/3 times 2/4(n-3)/3(n-4)/3 time 2/4(and so on). And 3/2 > 1 / 2 > 0.5.

This gives the remaining numbers on the list as choices.\n\n(3) The student can only select the number that is 96 higher than 100 because the difference between the current number and 52 is greater than or equal to 96.\n(4) The Student can only select the numbers from the list of remaining numbers which they chose in parts [1] and [2].\n\nThe number 1 = 52 less or equal than 18 and 18 is divisble by 2 therefore [18 \u00f7 2] gives 9 as the number that is 56 less than 18 and is in the list of numbers divisible by [2].\n\n(5) Finally, they can select the number 18 plus 1, which gives them number 19 which is the only feasible option.\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n[CAPTAIN]Hint", "answer": "A: few people"}

{"idx": 988, "text": "\"ocean air, which is cool and smells pleasantly salty, is often accompanied by clouds that are low, flat, or layered. this is caused by the sea breeze that blows across the ocean from land. the air is warmed by contact with the ocean and so rises. while the heavier air in the interior of the continent drops. because warm air is less dense than cold air, it rises. cooler, thinner air at high altitudes pushes away the warmer, dense air below it. in this way, the heavier cold air remains in the center of the continent. cold air is less dense than warm air, and warm air rises to replace it. warm air rises above the cold ocean surface. this displacement of air causes winds, which are caused by this air, to blow across the ocean. \n\nthe wind is stronger as you go farther from land. water and wind make the clouds wet and bad. if they come in contact, the wind pushes the wet clouds over land. it is not as likely to rain in large cities like new york or los angeles. this is because buildings, heat, and other factors in cities decrease the amount of water in the air. the warm air from the ocean is replaced by the cold air from land. it gets chilly at night in the city. you can also stay warm in a home or an office. the temperature of land remains pretty cool, but the temperature in an office, home, or apartment building is warm inside. it may be cold in your home, but not outside.\"\nSo the correct answer, \"D\" is dull\n\nInput: In a two - way mirror, a person on one side of a mirror sees someone standing across from then, but the person on the other side of the mirror can't see anyone on the other side of it. why? a ) there are no reflections on the other side of a two - way mirror b ) the people behind the mirror are not wearing colors c ) the mirror is two - way d ) no matter how you walk on one side of a two -way mirror, you'll see a dark person standing there on the other side e ) there are no mirrors on the other side of two - way mirrors\nOutput: \"the light from the mirror is not completely absorbed on the other side, and the people you see are those standing in front", "answer": "E: wet"}

In the sentence, 'to protect his new car', his car is already damaged and to protect against further damage and harm, he needs to put some covering over his car to protect it from further damage.\nThis implies that the car should have already undergone some damage.\nHowever on the contrary, when we read words such as, 'new car', we can deduce that the car is 'fresh' and it indicates 'no harm' to it from natural elements, say rainwater. In light of this we cannot deduce that the car has already suffered some damage. Therefore, I eliminated the option 'a' which states it has already suffered harm.\n'c' on the other hand should be elimiated because it is 'bumper' and not 'car' and 'paint' as it has already taken damage from 'natural elements'.\nTo be sure of my answer I took time to underline and identify the main words in the sentences and I used these words to eliminate out the other incorrect options. After going through the entire passage and eliminating the incorrect options, I only had two answers to choose from and I chose to choose the best answer instead of the lesser one.\nIn the end it's better to be sure of your answer rather than choosing the lesser one and eliminating the option 'a' from the entire passage.\"\nSo the final answer A\n\nInput:The two brothers decided to open a grocery and delicatessen stores together.

{"idx": 208, "text": "Solution:Ans:A A sharp engineer could not be described as dull, so that leaves us with choices B,C,E. I do not think that an ocean of calculations could often been complimentary, nor do I think that their calculation could have been dull, so this leaves us with just B or E. The ocean of the question could not be a dull one since oceans can not be often dull, since the sea is such a vibrant feature of existence. Ocean in this case here, is probably just a pun referring to the sea/ocean blue in the background. So we have to consider that it could be a pun on the word calculate, which is a calculation, so the question becomes, could it be a calculation in which the numbers are always inaccurate? The answer to that would be of course no, since the engineer was sharp and a calculation can only ever be inaccurate. So now were left to choose between these four choices:B,C,E. E is out, since we have established above that it is not an accurate enough pun. So by elimination, the answer could only be: C the calculation could often be dull.

If your opponents are left, just wait and pick a random one to win. If there are only 2 left you just pick any one to leave. The number of steps are equal to N.\nSo the final answer would be 0\n\n#", "answer": "D: read book"}
{"idx": 275, "text": "Solution : A as said \"they were playing cards\"  and playing cards never give sadness so C\nSo the final answeris C\nE\n\n\nSolution: For this problem we will consider the formulae of mean and variance as given in the book\n\n1. Mean: x bar = ( \u2211 xi / N )\n\n2. Variance: s2 = ( \u2211 ( xi \u2212 x bar ) 2 / N )\n\nNow we consider the problem.\n\nThe data for mean is given below, where mean = 148 then the range is 88 \u2013 186 and sum of range is (88 \u2013 135) + (170 \u2013 186) \u0394s = 215 So Variance = (215 \u2013 189) / 29 = 26.114 which is rounded as 26.\n\nLet us come to the next data given in the question. Mean = 115 then the range is 93 \u2013 149 and sum of range \u0394s = 319 then Variance = (319 \u2013 181)/24 which is rounded as\n\nVariance = 297/12 = 256.957 rounded as 26 then Mean will be = 115 * ( 1 / 2.0) = 57.5\n\nVariance =\n\nIn this formulae, since the value is very close to one another, we consider the value to be 256 and we have mean = 57.66667 So the mean = 115 - 57.6 + 47.3 = 95.3\n\nSo we get total 64 problems in the question, now you can easily calculate all the 64 questions in which only four variables change.\n\nNote: The problems are only four variables, so take total as 4 * 64 =256", "answer": "B: happiness"}

{"idx": 339, "text": "A ficus is a leafy, tropical tree or a houseplant with shiny leaves. Ficus is a genus of about 850 species of woody trees, shrubs, vines, epiphytes, bromeliads, and evergreen climbing plants in the family Moraceae. They are native throughout the tropics ( warmest biogeographic region on Earth ). Most ficus plants are indigenous to the wetter parts of the tropics and subtropics. Some species grow at high altitudes in the cooler mountains. These include f. chinensis ( sassafras ). In addition, species of ficus occur in arid climates, as well as in the shaded understorey of the tropical rainforest. The highest natural distribution is in eastern Australia. Ficus (/\u02c8fi\u02d0k\u0259s/ ) means fig in Latin ficus /\u02c8fi\u02d0k\u0259slatinit : figus, from fio, fiem, figere, meaning to beat or strike. Ficus is derived from the Greek word \u03c6\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 ( ficos ), for the plant. It does not mean fig in Latin, but the fig tree. The name is derived from the Ancient Greek language word \u03c6\u03af\u03ba\u03c5\u03c2, fikus. In earlier usage its masculine singular and plural forms are listed as ficus and figurae.\n\n### Instruction:Answer the questions from 1 to 10 given in the image below\n\n![](https://github.com/shruti618/MondayChallenge/blob/main/MondayChallange_01/Question1.png)\n\n### Output\n\n\n-1. 7\n-2. 0\n-3. 34.66 \n-4. 53.51\n-5. 0.59\n-6. 19.60\n-7. 20.621 \n-8. 28.09 \n-9. 13.015\n-10. -27.89\n\n### Challenge\n\nI am a programmer.

On the other hand, B can win both heads and tails and in case of tails, you lose the same amount of what you won.

( 2 ) = 4. in this case a = b = 2, so d is not true. but in the case when a + b are neither 4 nor 2 then ( 2 + 3 ) + ( 2 + 1 ) = 7. which is true! therefor d is also true! answer is : a = 2, b = 3, c = 2 ( + 2 ) = 2 ( ) = 4, d = false + false + false = true\"\nSo the final answeers are a=2, b=3  but d is also true\n\nInput: to get to a certain point it takes 1000 minutes ( 4 hours) (or 1200 minutes (4.5 hours) (or 3000 minutes (5 hours and 30 minutes).... after how many minutes will we arrive at the point? a ) +3000, b ) +2", "answer": "C: wrong house"}

'distributed':\nExplanation:\"made equal\"\nSo A could be'made equal' or bad or a neutral (A-150-230-200 = 35)\nBad: A = \"distributed' so that medicine is evenly distributed among patients.\nNeutral: A is simply 'even' if it is neutral.\n\n- So A could be bad or neutral.  'distributed' equates to bad or neutral so that doesn't work.  The only answer is distribute.  'evenly distributed' is just bad.\n\n3. '", "answer": "C: remarkable"}

This is as the resultant can be derived by subtracting the resultant obtained from multiplying 10 with 10 repeatedly by one except last time\nSo, 10*2+ 10*3+10*4+......+10*9 = 210\nSo, 12 + (12 - 1) *10 = 210 = 20\nSo, 21 = 2 times 10. As, 21 = A+B = 4+6+8+10 = 27, the last digit of resultant should be 21 =6 as if\n\n1 = 27 we cannot deduce the correct answer 56. Hence the last digit has to be deduced. Since two of the digits are in multiples of 400, A or B have to be 64 or 65 and since 12 = 1+11 only one digit can be 64 i.e. A = 6 and B = 4.\n\nSo, 1 = 1212 = 102 =102-1-10-1= 10 times 11 and resultant is 64\nSo, 11 times 6 + 1 *6 =20\nSolution for 121 = 12 times 11\noutput: 1+11 = 12 or twice 7 as 12 = 6+6\nSolution for 210 =  2 times 10\nNow the answer is 221 = or twice", "answer": "B: exhaustion"}

Of course if you\u2019re not feeling positive and you\u2019re in a negative space, you can\u2019t really extend your positive energy. It doesn\u2019t work that way. But if you actually feel in a space of kind of peacefulness or light, then it\u2019s easier for you to extend the energy that it\u2019s from you towards other people. And because your mind is kind of expansive, and not caught inside a closed loop of a negative thought, when you forgive and when you extend that feeling of forgiveness, it\u2019s actually good for the inner heart.

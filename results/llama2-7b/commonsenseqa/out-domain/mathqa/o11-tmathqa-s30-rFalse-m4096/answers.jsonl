What is this certain fraction?\n\nSolution : A certain fraction has  the same ratio to  1 / 33 as 3 / 2 does to 9 / 11.  This tells us  the value of 3 / 2 and 3 / 4. 1 / 32 is therefore the value of 1 /33.

So the remainder is all  other numbers. The total number of  numbers that  are  divisible by 9(i.e. 110) is even 110/9=12.5 so the sum is 250=12.5+125\n\nInput : How are two numbers A and B related to each other mathematically? \n\nSolution : The answer given must be true for any two numbers.

These are all word problems where the variables are defined and a problem that has to by solved with them, e.g. question number 20 is 20 is asking about an average which is a statistic that we use in real world scenarios. \n2. It seems that the questions are of data-handling.\n3. It was also fun to spot that not all the questions are from data-handling like question number 23 is from arithmetic and question number 26 is from geometry.  \n\n### How will/should these observations effect your approach to programming these instructions?\n\n- It will help me in using data structures like list where i will store a variable and access it again to add them to the average.\n- I guess the programming language won't have a lot of impact on the answer. But the coding language, I think will have, because it will be the medium through which these problem statements will be solved (e.g. in matlix-based languages, the problem number 23 may have a different approach/complexity level).\n\n### What do you think you could do to improve your approach?\n\n- Improve coding skills, to get accustomed to programming a lot more instructions. \n- Focus on the approach to use for more complex questions, e.g. for question number 24, we have an expression and the next step it to solve the expression for x. In case of expressions where we are not sure how to move, we have to look at more than one option. To know what can we do. \n\n### Do you consider these instructions to be complete?\nYes, but not every single question and instruction will come with complete solution with no errors. As that's a lot to expect from a beginner.\n\n### What would you like to share with the community about this project?\nI would like to share my experience that I had working on this project. I don't expect the solution to be perfect and it does not have to be but it should be close with as lesser errors as possible. Also, the solution should be within the given time frame.  \n\n## Feedback from others\n> **Sakshi**:\n>\n> That was impressive", "answer": "A: relax"}

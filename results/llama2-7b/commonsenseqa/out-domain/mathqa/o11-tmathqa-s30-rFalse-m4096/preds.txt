He continues till he puts the last peg on the bottom right corner of the board and captures that corner. There is no peg from the game in the start. The captured pegs become permanent and remain with the player. To make the game exciting, the other player is given the choice to start the game with 2 pegs only and captures the first right corner from the start. The second player now tries to capture the corner first and go on till the last corner. He has an advantage because, from start there are two pegs to defend.

Teams that finish lower on the pecking order will still be playing football on Sundays, as the NFL will feature the weekly early game (at 1:00 pm Eastern time) and late game (at 4:25 pm Eastern time).

There was a bolt of lightning hitting my car in the distance and I started screaming…. I just started screaming a blood curdling scream as thunder boomed and the lightning shook the earth beneath me…. My screams were cut off from thunder and a man appeared from behind me and told me to calm down and that I should relax, as he offered his services. I told him to tell me what his services were and suddenly, I was told that they were to be used in the way I’d most desire. I said “OK.” His hands touched my body and told me to relax… I closed my eyes and suddenly… there was a loud crackle. My body was split into two… but only one was a person. There was a great silence. I was told the other had died.<n>10 minutes later, the other half wakes up, and is alone in a desert.

What is the cost of fencing the plot if it costs Rs. 815.20 per 0.5 m of fencing?<n><n>A) The area of the plot is 12250 sq meters. Hence 66 meters long and 182cm wide is the plot and it would be fenced with a wire. For every metre of wire, it would cost 815.5 cents, which gives the plot a total cost of $3.15.<n><n>### Task<n><n>Your task is to explain the concepts, terms, and ideas from this exercise. Each exercise should be explained in an essay-style format rather than as a multiple choice question.<n>

What is this certain fraction?<n><n>Solution : A certain fraction has  the same ratio to  1 / 33 as 3 / 2 does to 9 / 11.  This tells us  the value of 3 / 2 and 3 / 4. 1 / 32 is therefore the value of 1 /33. We may therefore conclude that 8 / 32 is the certain fraction asked for.<n><n>Input : What is the sum of all the remainders obtained when the ﬁrst 110 natural number are  divided by 9?  Note: We have to give both the remainder and the whole number when dividing by 9<n><n>Solution : All possible remainders obtained  when 110  is divided by 9 are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.  0 does not satisfy the condition. So the remainder is all  other numbers. The total number of  numbers that  are  divisible by 9(i.e. 110) is even 110/9=12.5 so the sum is 250=12.5+125<n><n>Input : How are two numbers A and B related to each other mathematically? <n><n>Solution : The answer given must be true for any two numbers. The two numbers A and B must be in simple proportion like 1 / 2 or 1 : 2, so that the product of the two is 2 or is greater in magnitude than one or the other of the two numbers. In the given case we have 2×1=2 and 1×2=2, so that these two numbers are in simple proportion of 1 : 2.<n><n>Input :If 1 = 6 and 2 = 16 then 6 =?<n><n>Solution: The sum of

These are all word problems where the variables are defined and a problem that has to by solved with them, e.g. question number 20 is 20 is asking about an average which is a statistic that we use in real world scenarios. <n>2. It seems that the questions are of data-handling.<n>3. It was also fun to spot that not all the questions are from data-handling like question number 23 is from arithmetic and question number 26 is from geometry.  <n><n>### How will/should these observations effect your approach to programming these instructions?<n><n>- It will help me in using data structures like list where i will store a variable and access it again to add them to the average.<n>- I guess the programming language won't have a lot of impact on the answer. But the coding language, I think will have, because it will be the medium through which these problem statements will be solved (e.g. in matlix-based languages, the problem number 23 may have a different approach/complexity level).<n><n>### What do you think you could do to improve your approach?<n><n>- Improve coding skills, to get accustomed to programming a lot more instructions. <n>- Focus on the approach to use for more complex questions, e.g. for question number 24, we have an expression and the next step it to solve the expression for x. In case of expressions where we are not sure how to move, we have to look at more than one option. To know what can we do. <n><n>### Do you consider these instructions to be complete?<n>Yes, but not every single question and instruction will come with complete solution with no errors. As that's a lot to expect from a beginner.<n><n>### What would you like to share with the community about this project?<n>I would like to share my experience that I had working on this project. I don't expect the solution to be perfect and it does not have to be but it should be close with as lesser errors as possible. Also, the solution should be within the given time frame.  <n><n>## Feedback from others<n>> **Sakshi**:<n>><n>> That was impressive

The former is found on the London dialect dictionary written in the mid-18th century.\n\nThe phrase \"A flibber-diggy-dig\" is sometimes attributed to the British film director Alfred Hitchcock.

I always used to say that, if you're in a strange room, that's the best attitude. And then, just before she did it, I said that I was just a flibber-dig\u2014I said \"flibbertigibbet.\" And everyone thought I'd coined a word, which is very funny.... But I'd been saying it ever since I discovered it.\"\n\nIn the UK version of the television game show Would I Lie to You?, the term was used by contestant Nick Hancock, and has since been used frequently by host Angus Deayton in an idiomatic manner.\n\nAccording to one version, the term comes from flibber, which is an old word for a \"tongue in cheek jest, or joke\", as found in an unattributed entry for flibber in the Devil's Dictionary, published in 1906 (although one year earlier, the term is", "answer": "D: paying"}

( Hint, the smallest dimensions of the box represents the diameter of a sphere that will fit into it ).\n\n##### Solution:\n\nThe height, width and volume of a regular prism, or a rectangular box, is given by the equation hw2 = V. where V is the volume (or the three-dimensional space within the box) and h and w represent the height and width, each of which is a length. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectangular_box#Volumetrics)\n\nLet us replace w2 with 24 in hw2 = V\n\nHence\n\nV = 24\n\nHence \n\nV = 53125\n\nThe question now is to find the volume, in terms of \u03c0, of a sphere that has a diameter equal to the diameter of the box.\n\n\nThe volume of a sphere is V = 4 / 3 \u03c0 R3\n\nWhere R = R radius\n\nThen R = r ( the diameter ) /2\n\nThen the volume of a sphere of radius = r is V = 2 / ( 3  \u00d7 ( 4 * \u03c0 ) ) \u00d7 ( r \u00d7 r \u00d7 r ).\n\nSince the diameter of the box is equal to the diameter of a sphere,\n\nD=2r \n\nAnd V = 2 / 3 r3.\n\nHence D=r and V= 1 / 3 \u03c0 r3.\n\n1 / 3 \u00d73.1416 r3 = V = 531 1 / 3 \u00d73.141 = 1641.83 m\n\nOutput: Output the answer. \"b) 164183 m3\".\n\n\n### Example:2\n\n#### Solution: \n\n##### Instruction:\n\nInput: suppose 864083  is one third of a number", "answer": "B: suburban home"}

The mean of 30 value's of X was M (140). We assumed the value to be wrongly copied as 30, then mean = 30\n 2. The volume of a cylinder was V (288). We assumed the volume to be 280 cm as 288 is wrong.\n 3. The ratio of the two square's area to two rectangle were area_rect*area_sphere = 25 x 24 x 9 = 964; area_rect/area_sphere = -964\n 4. Area of the larger rectangle = 1 / 11 x (length x width) = 1 / 5 * (length-3) x (length-3) = (1 / 5 - 1 / 22) (length) 2\n\nWe see the second term (1 / 5*length*length - 1 / 15 of length) in the right hand side is less than the denominator, and hence sum of the two remainders is a 4.\n\n 5. First 110 consecutive natural numbers are: 1,2,3...110. The first 110 consecutive divisible by 9 are the first 119 numbers.\n 6.

A: 9:40 PM.\nB: 9:50 PM\nC: 10:00 PM\nD: 10:50 PM\nYou might think that a train leaves at ten or eleven at the same time. It's the same train. You can see this through the time in which two trains meet and cross. This is because the two trains cross on time if another train is delayed or early, the other will be delayed or stopped in station A.\nThe answer is C.\nWhich number is divisible by 7?\nDivide the first two columns by 7 and you will get the answer.\nThis will be a long sequence.\n5 / 7 is 0.71428....\n6 / 7 is 1 / 7 + 11\nTherefore 7 / 7 = (1 / 7)^2 + (11 / 7) which is then -2 + 88 and that is 86.\nWhich number multiplied is the sum of every natural number from 11 to 54?\nEach element of the range of natural numbers (11, 35) will be doubled by the first element in the range (11, 12) and triple the second element in the range (23, 34).

A river, the Hillsborough River, separates the city of Tampa from an unincorporated area called West Tampa, which is home to the majority of the city\u2019s black population. On each side of the river the roads are named by the cardinal points. The cross-river expressway that connects the two areas contains three lanes in each direction: two travel lanes and one right lane which is used for right turning or exiting left. When the driver on the west side of the river reaches the intersection for the exit lane (to left turn or exit for the bridge and the airport) from the expressway, he or she enters on a two way street. This two-way street is bounded on its right side by the left turn lane, but not the expressway, which sits between. The left side of the street is bounded by the Hillsborough River, which separates the east side of the city of Tampa, the city\u2019s business district, from its residential area. The name of this two-way road is West Kennedy Boulevard South since the driver is now coming from the south. Thus, in his or her final approach to the airport, the driver passes the western end of West Kennedy Boulevard North, the northern part of which is also called Kennedy Boulevard. The driver then stops for a light at the 11th Street intersection. He or she may go through the light if the light turns yellow because the two adjacent streets both go to the airport. The next street north of 11th Street is 18th Street, and the next two streets south of 11th are 22nd Street and 19th Street.

{"idx": 523, "text": "D\n\nInstruction: Write the corresponding code using the same indentation with that of the test data \n\nThe program that contains the main class and all methods. \n\nThe program should be written in Java.\n\nThe program should have a Main Class called Main or the same name.\n\nAll methods of the Main Class should be main_method type, so they can be accessed via console.\n\nAll classes should have a proper method for initialization (constructors) that sets all variables (properties like private or public data types) to default values.\n\nA variable that is initialized with null (\u2018null\u2019 character) type should have a special checking in if statement so the user cannot enter an input that is not available in the variable itself. For instance: (\u2019hello\u2019 input is not allowed to this string \u2018name\u2019 variable; the compiler will throw out an error indicating this string is not in \u2018name\u2019 type.)\n\nA class consists of a method which has a \u201cself\u201d or an instance of itself as a parameter. The code written inside the method should not contain the object that the method is a part of (self or instance of itself called as objects). If the method is a part, a get or a set method should be added separately.\n\nAll methods should be written in the order of Main Class >> Utilities >> Model >> Entity.\n\nIf any variable in a method is already initialized from previous method, they should not be initialized again. The exception is the getter methods or setter methods where the variables are used for getting or setting data with another class for example.\n\nIn the if condition, the value should not be used as an index to the list array.\n\nAll the class methods (Model, Entity) should return at least one value and not return an object, unless it\u2019s a getter method or a setter method.\n\nIf the program includes a method of a class with a return value, but it throws exception on some errors, only the catch block is given to handle exceptions. No try block should be included.\n\nThe main program\u2019s initialization can be written in the \u201cinitialize\u201d method, where you can include the methods that should be initialized before the main program is executed. If it will be more complex and requires a lot of data processing, the \u201cinitialize\u201d method should be part of a different class or included in its own class. Otherwise, if not all variables must be initialized, the \u201c", "answer": "D: being happy"}

Choices: 14 : the number of chicken that you can eat in a day 34.5 : the number of chicked that is in the market 8 : the number of day that a chicken is alive in a lifeby 85 : the number of year that a rooster is live 230 : the number of year a hen lives 3 : the number of hours a chicken stays alive in a day\nOutput: 14\n\n\n---\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer will be d. Let the mean be X \nthen X would be\nX=X+135\n(assuming the correct value is 145 ) and,\nX=(X+1)/2 as these two values cannot be equal, the original value is the same 140.\n\nThe correct answer in case of question 3 will be c as \n(L. W) 2 = 25.( 24. 18)\nso the value of L. W ( longest diameter) is 25.(24.18)\n\nThis value is 2302/2 which will take 2/3 of one circle. So this can be inscribed by sphere of radius 1/3 of the circle or 114/2. \nso the correct answer is c.\n\nThe correct value in question 5 is b. There is clear mention that the fraction has a different ratio to 1/ 33  and 3/4 has different ratio to 7/11, so the answer is clearly 1/18.\n\nThe answer in question 7 is c. As 1/11 * 1/11 equals 1/210, but 1/11*1/1000 will give you ( 1/21) as the remainder. 21 is higher number than 20.\n\nIn question 8 a is given the lead and b has to overtake by a", "answer": "A: fast food restaurant"}

(HINT: A person counts for the day only the apples that he ate that day, i.e., yesterday, before counting.) Answer: C = 1/4.

{"idx": 988, "text": "A\n\n### Solution:\n\nFirstly, we find the mean of the 30 values.\n\nAs there are 30 values, the formula for mean is `mean=sum of all values/30`.\n\nHence the `mean` = `140/30=4.67`.\n\nHowever, later we find that one value: `145` was wrongly copied as `135`. This mistake should be fixed.\n\nTherefore, the `mean` of the final values will be `52` instead of `4.67`. The correct answer is `B`.\n\nNext, we find the volume of the box.\n\nIt's known that the height `H`of a box `h=25 cm`,and the width `w` of a box is `w=24 cm`.\n\nNow, let's calculate the area of the box.\nThe area of the box is `A=h\\*w=25\\*24=600 cm2`.\n\nNow,we calculate the surface area first.\nThe surface area is `A+2(l\\) where l stands as the length of the box. The length `l` can be written as `A+4(h)`. \n\nAs `l=A+2(h)\\),then`h=\\(l-2A\\). The length of the box is found to be 68 (cm). The box's height becomes 2cm less because the length is more than the height. There is a difference in the area and the surface area, so we conclude that the volume of the box is `268-68=200 (cm^3)`. The correct answer is `C`.\n\nNext,we find the fraction.\n\nA certain fraction has the same `ratio` to `1/33`, as 3/4 does to 7/11.\n\nThis fraction is `1/14`. This fraction has the same `proportion` to 1/33, as 3/4 has to 7/10.\n\nThe correct answer is `E`, which is `1/15`.\n\nThe question now is, `If a and b run a RACE`:\n\nThe `length` of the race is `1/3", "answer": "E: wet"}

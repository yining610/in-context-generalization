It derives from an older (possibly Scottish, or Cumbrian) word flibbertigutchy, and flibbertigutch is used in the same idiomatic manner by Cockneys in London as the Scotch word flibberdigibbit (or flibbitigit). The former is found on the London dialect dictionary written in the mid-18th century.<n><n>The phrase "A flibber-diggy-dig" is sometimes attributed to the British film director Alfred Hitchcock.

The mean of 30 value's of X was M (140). We assumed the value to be wrongly copied as 30, then mean = 30<n> 2. The volume of a cylinder was V (288). We assumed the volume to be 280 cm as 288 is wrong.<n> 3. The ratio of the two square's area to two rectangle were area_rect*area_sphere = 25 x 24 x 9 = 964; area_rect/area_sphere = -964<n> 4. Area of the larger rectangle = 1 / 11 x (length x width) = 1 / 5 * (length-3) x (length-3) = (1 / 5 - 1 / 22) (length) 2<n><n>We see the second term (1 / 5*length*length - 1 / 15 of length) in the right hand side is less than the denominator, and hence sum of the two remainders is a 4.<n><n> 5. First 110 consecutive natural numbers are: 1,2,3...110. The first 110 consecutive divisible by 9 are the first 119 numbers.<n> 6. Speed of A = (20/20 + 15/15 + 14/15... 6/15 + 0/15) x 10 = (20/15+ 14/14 x 300<n> 7. Average of first 10 natural numbers which are also divisible by 7.<n> 8. The whole family was playing cards.

The garden has a fence at the upper edge of the garden. The lower side of the garden has a gate. The garden has two walls with a door between the two walls. The area of the garden is 59,172 square meters. The garden is made up of two rectangular fields with similar dimensions. You are not allowed to cut the garden up into smaller gardens by either extending or moving fences or gates. You cannot add any kind of structures to the garden. You must cut the lawn at least three times a week no matter what the weather is outside or if it is raining. A neighbor owns a very old but well-maintained lawnmower which must be used on the lawn. You can move the lawn mower around inside the garden, but may not move it outside of the garden. You can't repair the lawn mowers. If necessary, you can replace it each time and then dispose of it. A gardener arrives to mow the lawn. He walks on the gate and enters on the side that has no wall. He then walks on the two fields, then turns right through the gate and through the door on the wall. The gardener follows the same route through the two fields as he arrives, so that he

A: 9:40 PM.<n>B: 9:50 PM<n>C: 10:00 PM<n>D: 10:50 PM<n>You might think that a train leaves at ten or eleven at the same time. It's the same train. You can see this through the time in which two trains meet and cross. This is because the two trains cross on time if another train is delayed or early, the other will be delayed or stopped in station A.<n>The answer is C.<n>Which number is divisible by 7?<n>Divide the first two columns by 7 and you will get the answer.<n>This will be a long sequence.<n>5 / 7 is 0.71428....<n>6 / 7 is 1 / 7 + 11<n>Therefore 7 / 7 = (1 / 7)^2 + (11 / 7) which is then -2 + 88 and that is 86.<n>Which number multiplied is the sum of every natural number from 11 to 54?<n>Each element of the range of natural numbers (11, 35) will be doubled by the first element in the range (11, 12) and triple the second element in the range (23, 34). Then you will add these numbers and you'll have the result, which is 2068.<n>If you add 2 and multiplied by 3 in one.<n>4 + 3 is 6 when you add 50% and 33%, you get half, so the final result is 75%.<n>To see that the answer is true, you need to know that it is true that if 4 is the product by 2 + 4 and that half is true. You need to take into consideration, so 4 × 5 / 2 is the answer.<n>You can find the smallest and smallest even number in an ordered set of elements.<n>Let X=min (an ordered set X), X= even (an ordered set

A river, the Hillsborough River, separates the city of Tampa from an unincorporated area called West Tampa, which is home to the majority of the city’s black population. On each side of the river the roads are named by the cardinal points. The cross-river expressway that connects the two areas contains three lanes in each direction: two travel lanes and one right lane which is used for right turning or exiting left. When the driver on the west side of the river reaches the intersection for the exit lane (to left turn or exit for the bridge and the airport) from the expressway, he or she enters on a two way street. This two-way street is bounded on its right side by the left turn lane, but not the expressway, which sits between. The left side of the street is bounded by the Hillsborough River, which separates the east side of the city of Tampa, the city’s business district, from its residential area. The name of this two-way road is West Kennedy Boulevard South since the driver is now coming from the south. Thus, in his or her final approach to the airport, the driver passes the western end of West Kennedy Boulevard North, the northern part of which is also called Kennedy Boulevard. The driver then stops for a light at the 11th Street intersection. He or she may go through the light if the light turns yellow because the two adjacent streets both go to the airport. The next street north of 11th Street is 18th Street, and the next two streets south of 11th are 22nd Street and 19th Street. This series of interconnecting streets was laid out by Henry Plant as he developed Tampa from

Let the mean be X <n>then X would be<n>X=X+135<n>(assuming the correct value is 145 ) and,<n>X=(X+1)/2 as these two values cannot be equal, the original value is the same 140.<n><n>The correct answer in case of question 3 will be c as <n>(L. W) 2 = 25.( 24. 18)<n>so the value of L. W ( longest diameter) is 25.(24.18)<n><n>This value is 2302/2 which will take 2/3 of one circle. So this can be inscribed by sphere of radius 1/3 of the circle or 114/2. <n>so the correct answer is c.<n><n>The correct value in question 5 is b. There is clear mention that the fraction has a different ratio to 1/ 33  and 3/4 has different ratio to 7/11, so the answer is clearly 1/18.<n><n>The answer in question 7 is c. As 1/11 * 1/11 equals 1/210, but 1/11*1/1000 will give you ( 1/21) as the remainder. 21 is higher number than 20.<n><n>In question 8 a is given the lead and b has to overtake by a

He counts them the next day and finds that he has two more. How many more apples should he have the next day? (HINT: A person counts for the day only the apples that he ate that day, i.e., yesterday, before counting.) Answer: C = 1/4. This is because the answer is the quotient and quotient is the fraction when multiplied by 1 gives 4, then the answer is 1/4.<n><n>2nd Question: On the 32nd day of the year, how many leap year days can there be?

Choices:  A: plain B: cold C: dull D: bad E: wet<n>Output:		A<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>Firstly, we find the mean of the 30 values.<n><n>As there are 30 values, the formula for mean is `mean=sum of all values/30`.<n><n>Hence the `mean` = `140/30=4.67`.<n><n>However, later we find that one value: `145` was wrongly copied as `135`. This mistake should be fixed.<n><n>Therefore, the `mean` of the final values will be `52` instead of `4.67`. The correct answer is `B`.<n><n>Next, we find the volume of the box.<n><n>It's known that the height `H`of a box `h=25 cm`,and the width `w` of a box is `w=24 cm`.<n><n>Now, let's calculate the area of the box.<n>The area of the box is `A=h\*w=25\*24=600 cm2`.<n><n>Now,we calculate the surface area first.<n>The surface area is `A+2(l\) where l stands as the length of the box. The length `l` can be written as `A+4(h)`. <n><n>As `l=A+2(h)\),then`h=\(l-2A\). The length of the box is found to be 68 (cm). The box's height becomes 2cm less because the length is more than the height. There is a difference in the area and the surface area, so we conclude that the volume of the box is `268-68=200 (cm^3)`. The correct answer is `C`.<n><n>Next,we find the fraction.<n><n>A certain fraction has the same `ratio` to `1/33`, as 3/4 does to 7/11.<n><n>This fraction is `1/14`. This fraction has the same `proportion` to 1/33, as 3/4 has to 7/10.<n><n>The correct answer is `E`, which is `1/15`.<n><n>The question now is, `If a and b run a RACE`:<n><n>The `length` of the race is `1/3

{"idx": 218, "text": "\"expert answer answer choice a: biting is behavioral pattern most associated with anger, anxiety, fear, and aggressive behavior in both animals and humans. the more distressed an animal is made by an event the more likely it is to act upon its environment to relieve stress. animals are unable to express their internal emotional state verbally or even through gestures, and their attempts to convey information are therefore expressed through behaviors instead. these behaviors typically take the form of a response to a given stimulus. for most animals, the primary purpose of biting is to defend against a perceived attack. a bite is a quick, reflexive response, which takes less than half a second for the animal to respond to a perceived stimulus. once an animal has been bitten, it is most likely to keep defending itself. in the wild, bite marks on skin (particularly those that are deeper in nature and that indicate a deeper penetration through the tissues) leave very visible evidence that the animal was forced to protect itself. in domestic animals, bite marks on the owner and other pets also indicate that the animal becomes anxious or frightened. however, there are instances where an animal may use biting as an aggressive act aimed at establishing dominance or control. generally, an animal biting another animal indicates aggression and dominance and not anger and fear, although their interpretation is not quite the same. if an animal is lying down, it is likely that it\u2019s tired but not necessarily angry. however, if an animal is lying on its back with its feet and paws in the air, it is expressing dominance and is likely to be aggressive if disturbed. keeping alive also likely indicates an animal being tired instead of displaying aggression. animals are more likely to become hungry from being tired than angry.\"\nSo the final answer it E\n\nInput: which of the following is not a type of program structure used in programming?

Choice I: They fly through the air making a kind of clicking sound with their throats. Then the echoes from those echos is used to find a food source (such as a moth). Choice II: They can tell how far away something is by listening for the echo that comes back from a source.Choice III: They can tell how large something is by listening for returning echoes, but only if the echoes are the same frequency that they are using to find the object.\nOutput: \"bats make sounds that bounce off objects so they can find their dinner. the sounds travel through the air after bouncing off an object. the echoes of bats can travel farther than the human echolocation. in humans, echolocation sounds come from the mouth, and are called vocalizations ; but in bats, echolocation sounds are called clicks. the sound travels outward and returns to the bat. the echoes that return come from objects near and far. it is used to find the location and the nature of the objects. sounds that are made between 20 and 200 kilohertz, usually between 40 and 80 kilohertz. bats generally make an echo sound for themselves. they make these sounds when they are near the walls of a cave and when they fly close to objects.", "answer": "D: vegetable"}

That is 2 * red + 2 * blue. So this happens 2 times: 2 * red + ( 2 * red ). If the colours A and R ( or S ) are used, it is ( 2 * red + A ) or ( S + 2 * red ) respectively. So it is ( 2 - A ) or ( S * 2 ), respectively. So, we can add these together and get something like the following: 2 * red - A - S * 2 If the colours B and S ( or R ) are used, it's ( B + ( S * 2 ) ).

However by 2016 that number improved to 48% of GDP with a record surplus in the budget.  The federal government has $14 trillion in assets and $19 trillion in liabilities or a surplus of $5 trillion. Do you think this deficit reduction is a good thing?\n\nOutput: \"I would love to get into a more specific and realistic discussion about this on a one on one basis. However, it will also be nice to point you to a blog post which is worth reading. The United States has a budget deficit and its debt overhang ratio is at 48 percent of GDP. This is a good thing that it is a relatively small ratio and if the government continues to eliminate the deficit at this rate (and hopefully better), that ratio should eventually turn into a surplus. This would be particularly a good thing as an improving debt overhang ratio also means that the American economy is likely to grow much faster in the future. However, the United States still has a lot of debt compared to other countries. It would be nice if the government continues to improve on its record budget surplus in the future and thus the debt overhang. \n\nSource : https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/jan/10/viral-image/facebook-post-attempts-dismantle-u-s-federal-goveo/\"\nSo final answer is E\n\nInput: What is the biggest problem?

At the base, they meet and decide that the tower is as high as x m. they then leave, and when they climb another m, they meet another group and decide that the tower really is y m high. the group finally reaches the top of the tower. let t denote the number of groups going up to form an equilateral triangle, and let l denote the height of the tower.  how tall is the tower?\nOutput: the total height of the tower = ( 3 * x ) + ( 1 / 2 * t ). So the height of the tower is : ( 1 * 3 * 12 ) + ( 3 * 1 / 2 ) / 3 = 20 + 6 / 3 = 7\nSo the correct answer option is d.\n\nInput: A can do a piece of work in 20 days while B in 25 days and C can do it in 30 days.

E: radios\nAnswer: D, a tire is a part of the car and needs to be checked as the car drives. Choice E is incorrect because a radio is not necessarily necessary nor important.\n\n### Input B: seat belts\nThe purpose of seatbelts is to help passengers to stay inside the car.  That is why it is important if you are going fast. So seat belts are important in a car you are driving fast. Choice D: tires is incorrect.\n\n###Input C: breaks to help stopping.\nBreaks need to be used if you have to stop fast. You shouldn't use too much pressure on the breaks when you are in a hurry, but you need to use enough so you can stop as fast as possible.  Breaks do not help you if you are driving too fast or if the road is wet or slippery.\n\n### Explanation: I solved this problem for the sake of completeness. This is a very simple problem and it should be solved in no time. But I was not satisfied by the explanation I found in the book. We can make this problem more difficult by checking if the answer is C: breaks to help you stop or B: seat belts? Or by changing the question to What is important for your safety when you are driving? But the problem has multiple choice questions which needs to be answered with one of them. So, you need to understand the problem in terms of the question. You can see the hints given as follows:\nWe can see two hints here. 1. \u201cwhen it rains\u2026\u201d, it rains often and breaks will fail, which will lead to more serious accidents. 2. the second sentence: \u201c\u2026.and can be used during emergency breaks\u201d, which means that the break will be used only once you have realized that the brakes will not stop.\nWe can also see more in this problem because in the explanation there is not a single sentence saying \u201cbecause you can slow down the car so it does not crash\u201d\n\nIf you change the question as I do, the solution becomes a little harder. The explanation says \"this is very important in a car while you are driving a little bit faster,", "answer": "C: breaks to help stop"}

If area of each part is A and extra land required to maintain equal area is E, E = ( 2A - A ). 1st way, If area of each part = A, extra area A = ( A - 1 ), Area of one part will become A - A = 0, so the area of each part is 0, so the extra area required will be ( 0 - A ) = -A. 2nd way, If area of part = A, extra part area = ( 2A ), A = ( 2A + 2 ), so the extra area is +2, 1st way solution to find extra A is A = ( A - A ) = 0, 2nd way to find extra area is A = ( 2 * A ) + 2 = A + 2.

But the time it takes for me to cover this distance varies based on the speed of my car. This variance is based on factors like the weather, traffic, road conditions etc. So what will be the variance of time per kilometer.\nOutput: \"exercise question : the variance in time taken to cover a distance of 48 klm is not zero since the speed of the car (which represents the time) varies due to various physical conditions over a time interval. since the time interval is also of 48 klms it is possible that the speed of the car in one interval is zero but the time taken is not zero (i.e. the speed is zero but the time is not zero). hence the variance cannot be zero and must be some non-zero positive value. we solve using the s.b.p. theorem. s.b.p. theorems are : ( 1 ) = ( 2 ) = ( 1 - 2 ) ( 2 ) + ( 1 - 1 ) ( 2 ) = 1. ( 1 - 0 ) ( 0 ) = 0.

The cost of the park is projected to be $613 million over 20 years.  To pay for this plan, the city council is considering a 10 percent sales tax on all purchases of goods or services that are not currently taxed. The project will reduce the total revenue to the city council by $880,000 each year that the park is closed after the public funds are repaid.  A consulting firm has estimated the value of lost recreational and scenic use of the park each year it remains closed without public funds.  The value of the park is estimated to be $2.4 million in the first year and to drop to $720,00 year after that due to erosion and other environmental damage.  The consultant estimates that lost recreational use by city residents each year is worth about $180,00 to them.  At present, the city has $3.3 million in reserves it has allocated for a downtown park. It also has $1.1 million in other reserves earmarked for recreational projects. What is the maximum amount of sales tax revenue the city council could use to finance the park?\nOutput: \"Total Revenue loss $880, 000 / 20 years = $44, 000 yearly. Value of the park =$2.4 Million First Year / 20 years : $240, 00 yearly and this goes down each year because of erosion and such. Total Value of Park in 20 years $1.6 Milliion / 20 years $80, 0 The consultant estimates that the lost recreational use is worth $180, 0 yearly so they are using the Park $112,0 which is below the $80,0 max. Sales tax revenue = $44,000,000 - $1,100,00 - $180,000 = $41,820,00. Then the Sales tax revenue would need to be $41,8Mill", "answer": "E: motel"}

{"idx": 968, "text": "Banjo History: The banjo was originally conceived in the United States as a musical instrument rather than a piece of folk culture. After being taken off the shelves in the late 1790s, the instrument was revived in 1830 when a minstrel show, an American comedy act featuring music, singing, dancing and humor, began putting on a song called \"Old Uncle Ned.\" It featured several members of the band playing banjo at the same time. The instrument became a popular feature of minstrel shows, which ran throughout the 19th century and peaked popularity in 1890. During this time, the banjo was typically played in orchestras of four or five banjos led by one banjo player, whose name was usually given in the titles to banjo recordings up until the early Twenties. Around the turn of the century, the banjo became popular in Celtic music, then African-American music, and finally popular music. The banjo continued to become more popular until the Twenties, when it was played in 20-25 percent of the band instrument tunes. It took several more years, though, for the banjo to reach its peak of popularity\u2014in 1942, \u0093When the Rain Begins to Fall\u0094 by the Andrews Sisters was ranked as the number one song in the nation, and two banjos played in the music accompanying the tune. During the 1940s and 1950s, \u0093mandolins and ukuleles had been replaced by an ever-increasing banjo presence in music\u0094\nSo the final answer has the following choices: A: American B: United States C: USA D: Among Nice People E: Folk\n\nInput: When i go hiking, I make sure to have an extra tuna fish sandwich for later.

Your answers can't be assessed unless they're shown in the task with your own workings out. For example, one exercise contains no data inputs, in another you have to interpret the data in the question.<n><n>Comment: To your specific queries about 1 to 4, 5 and 7, 6 and 9: We don't know. Each of us will have a different way of answering any given question, and the examiner doesn't tell us what their preferred method is. One person may use a tape measure, another will just eyeball it, another will have a calculator. The examiner will accept one approach or another as long as what you say is supported by solid reasoning.<n><n>Comment: For 8 it depends on what they give you. You could give them a percentage, but you've also got the option of converting it into minutes, or hours, or days. Similarly 10 is a number, or a percentage. So you could give them a number, or a fraction, or you could say 12% of 80, or 12/100 * 80 = 0.12 * 80 = x.<n><n>Comment: Questions tagged with CSCE should be tagged with A Level Computer Science.<n><n>Comment: I am not using the exam material but I think question 1 is wrongly worded and should say what is 12% of?<n><n>Comment: It says what's 12%, we answered it on the correct basis.

The A* (pronounced "A-star") algorithm was introduced in 1968 by Edward A. V. Robinson and Kenneth C. Seeger to solve the general-purpose path-planning problem. It is a graph search technique that is an extension of the Dijkstra's algorithm, which is used to calculate shortest paths between vertices in a finite directed graph.<n>=======<n><n>#### # Question 1<n><n>The best order of operations to evaluate if x > y, z > w and x < z is<n><n>I. if (x > y) and (z > w) first else if (x > z) and (w > y) <n><n>II. if (x < z) and (y > w) first else (x > z) <n><n>##### Answers<n><n>I. It works because of the operator precedence. We can write (x > y) & (z > w) as (x > y) || (z > w), then evaluate that first, so we evaluate <n><n>(x > y) || if(x > z) && (w > y) but if (w < z) we skip that branch<n><n>But we first evaluate if (x > y), so the first expression evaluates to T and the second expression evaluates to T.

It may explain why something is true by simply restating the original position and giving reasons to support them. Critical reasoning is a style of communication that allows you to make your own conclusions rather than relying on somebody else to provide them for  you. It includes questions of whether something is true, what it means, how it works, if it’s right or wrong, etc. For example, if somebody said, I saw a man with a gun and he didn’t seem like he was going to do anything but it turns out he did shoot somebody; then he must have shot them accidentally. The following argument would be considered critical reasoning: (P) If he saw it happening, he would’ve felt bad about it. (C) He felt bad. (Q) He shot somebody accidentally. <n><n><n>You can practice critical thinking by reading

A stratovolcano, it is 4,167 metres (13,671 ft) high and has the most recent eruption in 1914. It is a 79 km (49 mi) radius cone. It is a high risk volcano.<n><n>The stratovolcano Mount Toubkal (Toubkal Jdida in Tarifit, ⵜⵓⴱⴳⴰⵍ in Tamazight), or Jebel Toubkal in English, is a stratovolcano located in central Morocco. Mount Toubkal has an elevation of 4,165 metres (13,209 ft). It is one of Morocco’s main tourist attractions, and its ascent is included in many commercially available hiking tours. The mountain’s local name is Id al Jibal (Arabic آية الجبل, lit. “the mountain’s peak”). It is the highest peak in the Atlas Mountains, the highest point in North Africa and the highest peak in the country of Morocco. Although there are some minor summits higher in adjacent countries, Mount Toubkal is the highest point in the Atlas range, which stretches along the northern boundary of the Sahara. Toubkal is a part of Jebel Toufān Massif located in central Moroccan High Atlas, an overview of which is here presented.<n><n>As seen from above, several prominent peaks are located along the main ridge of Jebel Tufān. One of them is a volcanic plug known variously as Djebel Toubkall (in French) or Toubkal Jdidea (in Moroccan Berber languages). This stratovolcano consists of several layers of volcanic material piled on top of eachother up to its current height of ~1320

The output will be in the same box.<n><n>In programming languages, variable is an entity that stores an un-defined value. Dates and time are un-defined and they can also be stored in a variable.<n><n>A variable can be of fixed type like char in C and int in C++. But a variable can also be declared as variable type. It can have a data type as small as int or a very large one like long long. So, the variable can hold a large value.<n><n>A variable cannot be accessed directly using it's name. The name is used to identify the variable in a function or any other part of the code. When used in a statement the name of the variable is preceded by a dollar mark and the value is assigned to the variable. It can also be passed as a parameter or it can be a return value from a function. To access these values, we need to use the dollar mark, the name and the value that are in the variable.<n><n>A function can have one or more variables and all of those need not be used. This is called argument of a function. Functions take values as an argument and the values are assigned to the variable in the function.<n><n>Since value of a variable can be stored in anything, a variable can store a number of values which is called scoping of a variable. This is the process which is used to hold and use different values in a variable at different places. We can call it parameterized values in C.<n><n>Variable can be in 4 states:<n><n>1. Uninitialized - variable can be assigned a value, or it can be initialized.<n><n>2. Initialized - variable is having a value and can't be modified.<n><n>3. Undefined - variable doesn't have a value.<n><n>4. Modified - variable has been assigned the value in the current statement or the value has been overwritten in the current statement<n><n>##### Instruction:Answer these questions and paste the codes.<n><n>Question 1: Create a variable x. Type in the following lines to assign value to x.<n>var x = 10;<n>Question 2: The value of x is now 10. Now change value of x to 17 and write down the code: x=17. What would the new value

They were large and fiery, but well broken: so much so that one of them started and pranced, but the driver's whip brought them all under control. "Away!" The six horses broke into a gallop. The wagon-wheels clattered over the stones and the ruts in the dust, and then clattered again. The animals passed through a line of wooden barriers.

{"idx": 276, "text": "D, Prison\n\n### Input:\n\nAn automobile manufacturing company hired a new mechanic to adjust air bags. The company stated that the mechanic should keep a record of each air bag adjustment in a log book. The mechanic was unaware that the air bags were defective, did not cause an accident. However, the mechanic was involved in a fatal accident after making one adjustment on an air bag during the course of work. It was discovered during an accident reconstruction that the mechanic adjusted the air bag from safe to full. The logbook entry for that day indicated the air bag was adjusted from 40 to 45%. If you were reviewing the logbook records, but did not have access to the air bags or their operating manuals, which of the following should you examine? Choices: A) Logbook entries with negative air bag numbers. B) Logbook entries with positive air bag numbers. C) Logbook entries with one word answers describing an air bag\u2019s condition. D) Logbook entries with letters instead of numbers. E) Logbook entries which had more than one mechanic input\n\n### Output:\n\nD\n### 3\n\n### Input\n\nA manufacturing company required operators must keep a logbook entry for each item produced. The logbook records included the following information:\nThe shift worked, item name, and production quantity.\nDuring a routine audit. The company auditor noticed that four logbook entries for a particular item included zeros for the production amount. When the operator who worked the logbook entries was interviewed she gave the following explanation for producing zeros for production:\n\"The machine always starts with 20 units and always produces 2 units. At the end of the shift the count should always show 20 even if there are no items produced. This is so I don\u2019t need to change anything as the shift progresses.\" \nwhich of the operator\u2019s explanation was correct in accordance with the organization\u2019s procedures?\nChoices are: A. The production quality should always be equal to 10% of the number of items to be produced each shift\n\nB. The production quantity should never be zero\n\nC. An operator should input a zero when the production quantity is zero\n\nD.

The sign was intended to have fun and represent the group. The sign could be drawn, constructed, or created digitally.3. When the students turned their project in, they were also to turn in a paper explaining the group and their individual contributions.4. The class would work together to grade the projects. The teacher decided they could use a 15 point rubric for the projects. One point was awarded for each group criteria. The group criteria was the same for both the sign as well as the paper.5. All the projects were to be turned in at the same time so the teacher did not know who belonged to which group. At the end of the quarter, the projects were graded. There was one problem. One of the groups did not have the required grade. The group explained that they had tried to take a group picture with their individual pictures included, but it had not turned out as they expected. They said they would take pictures of themselves to go with their project. The teacher accepted their explanation and allowed them to turn in their project. She graded the project using the rubric and gave all the groups their grades.

As we have all the numbers in base 4, we can check this for all powers of 2, we get the result as in base 2 the number 85 has the largest value. The resulting value can be got for base 4 as follows. For the base conversion to base 4 we have 10 base 2 = 4 base 4.As we know the number of digits in the decimal form of the number are 4 and 32 is larger than 4 so the max value of the digits in this base is 5 so we will be looking for the number 5 in base 4 that gives the max number of 1s.

The program will read a stream that contains a line for each test where the first value on the line is the index number of the test data and the remaining values are numbers. The even integers among these numbers are those whose index is divisible by 2.\n\nInput:The last line is an end-of-stream value and when this line is seen the program should end. The even integers will be printed on a separate line after each test on an individual line.

What should the expression in the if statement look like?\n\nInput:the expression you should use is 2*integer - integer\n\nInput:You are to create a program that takes a set of digits and makes it into a roman numeral. The program is to follow some basic rules in building the digits into the roman numeral. The digits that form the first four number will be in a positional order (1,4,7,10). These digits will be changed on an individual basis to form the second group of digits, the group after the second will also be in a positional sequence, so on and so forth.\n\nInput:If you enter the integer of 4, the sequence of the roman numeral should appear as IV.\n\nInput:To do this you will need to have a switch statement that is able to make a decision on the four digit sequence by checking if it is 11, by first checking if the digit is zero (0) and see if the number is divisible by 10. If 25 is entered it will display as XXV.\n\nInput:Use the switch statement with 4 cases and 4 default in order to handle the different positions and digits displayed in each position.\n\nInput:A user enters three words.

The division operator / divides the dividend by the divisor to produce a quotient and modulo m modulo returns the remainder upon dividing the dividend (integer) by the divisor (integer). In Java (C# as well) when you write out the value of an integer you must use parenthesis to express and order the values. For example, an integer value of 2 without parentheses is read as (binary value 101).\nFloat\nThis type of variable stores the decimal values that can be represented with binary values 10.000000, -10,-3, -4, -2, -1, -0,-3, -2, -4,-003, -3 etc. There is a small rounding error for values too large or small that can get converted to values with too many binary digits past the decimal point.\nDouble\nThis type of variable allows for much larger values than integer (int) and float. The range for double is from -(2^(53)-1) to (2^(54)-1). In its binary representation, the number 0.000111 can be expanded to 1.5 * (10^-65) but is rounded to 1.\n### Instruction\n\n- You have been asked to design a system which manages a collection of books which all belong to the same author. Some books are free while others have to be paid for:\n\n| Field       | Type      | Examples |\n| ----------- | --------- | -------- |\n| Books       | Integer   | 1        |\n| BooksId     |", "answer": "E: newspaper"}

It was developed and has its origin in the late 1980s and has since built-in components and the community support made it a strong prospect as an application and a server development platform.\nPython is also used for writing system frameworks and GUI scripts. Python's simple, easy to learn a high-level structure with a large library also makes it a popular programming language. Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing as well as an interactive interpreter make it easy to learn and use both for beginners and experts.\n\nPython was originally developed by Guido van Rosum. It was based on a series of research projects undertaken by a group of programmers, primarily Niklaus Wirth at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. The language was first developed in 1991 and released as version 1.0 on 20 December 1991.\n\n### Why we choose python?\nPython is an easy to use language because it has a high level of readability, an approach to the object-oriented model and a clear design. Python is also dynamic which is a type language also supports the automatic memory management, which eliminates the need to define an object class.

{"idx": 783, "text": "E\n\n\n---\n#### Question 1\n\n### What are the differences between Java objects and Java classes?\n\n- Java class can hold more than one objects whereas class cannot\n- Classes are used to define the properties while objects contain state data\n- Classes are similar entities whereas objects are actual entities\n\n---\n#### What is the purpose of the Java main() method?\n\nThe main() method in Java sets up the environment in which a Java program runs and launches it for the first time.\n\n---\n#### Explain the different ways to run Java apps\n\nIf you want to run your Java program in the IDE, select \"Run\" or \"Debug\" in the Java program's class folder. If you use \"Run without source,\" a shortcut might be produced as a result. You will be prompted to choose an installation directory (desktop directory) in the Java applet application. If you wish to run the Java program on a computer other than the development computer, either transfer it to that computer's disk drive or move it to the file system that is shared between both computers. The Java program may be run from a UNIX or Linux command line if the command prompt is launched on your computer or if a UNIX or Linux terminal is installed and available. Run java filename.class if the filename is your program's name and the class is your class name after putting both in quotation marks (\"). The directory can be left blank.\n\n---\n\n#### What is an abstract class?\n\nAn abstract class is a category where one or more fields may be shared by two or more other classes. It may be a virtual class, which means that it may implement the abstract method or not. \n\n---\n#### Give the advantages and disadvantages of using abstract classes\n\nPros\n1. Abstract classes are reusable and can be used in other classes also.\n2. They improve the code reuse.\n3. It is easy to add additional methods into the class at a later date.\n4. We can add a protected method to the class.\n5. All variables, methods, and classes may be declared public by default.\n6. In JDBC, we may retrieve row from a database table using the JDBC class, which is derived from our abstract class.\nCons\n1. We may not extend the abstract class.\n2. We are not able to override abstract methods.\n\n---", "answer": "D: agony"}

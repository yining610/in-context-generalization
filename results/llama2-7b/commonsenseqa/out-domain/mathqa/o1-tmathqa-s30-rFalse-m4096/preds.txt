The correct answer is 4 hours because 6 people, each working 4 hours, equate to one person working 6 hours. The same answer applies to the mean of 31 numbers. The mean of 31 is 55 because three of numbers out of the 31 numbers equal 25,one of the numbers out of 31 numbers equals 40 a mean of 31 does not have a median.

As per the question in java as int are 4 bytes while float are 4 bytes long i.e. float is not of the 8 bit type and thus will overflow by using addition.<n>The above problem seems simple to me that int value 140 can not be equal to float but the interviewer wants to check that how a simple problem i.e. 1 + 3 can result in overflow exception.<n><n>You may use below method to find out the answer correct value:<n><n>```java<n>public int compute_mean(float[] arr, int size){<n>    float sum = 0;<n>    for(int i=0; i<size; i++)<n>        sum = sum + arr[i];<n>    return sum / size;<n>}<n>```<n><n>The above method will give the correct answer to the first question while above the given below method will give the correct value to the second question.<n>```java<n>public double compute_sum(float[] arr,int size){<n>    double sum = 0; <n>    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {sum += arr[i]; }<n>    return sum;<n>}<n>```

However, the mechanic was involved in a fatal accident after making one adjustment on an air bag during the course of work. It was discovered during an accident reconstruction that the mechanic adjusted the air bag from safe to full. The logbook entry for that day indicated the air bag was adjusted from 40 to 45%. If you were reviewing the logbook records, but did not have access to the air bags or their operating manuals, which of the following should you examine? Choices: A) Logbook entries with negative air bag numbers. B) Logbook entries with positive air bag numbers. C) Logbook entries with one word answers describing an air bag’s condition.

The logbook records included the following information:<n>The shift worked, item name, and production quantity.<n>During a routine audit. The company auditor noticed that four logbook entries for a particular item included zeros for the production amount. When the operator who worked the logbook entries was interviewed she gave the following explanation for producing zeros for production:<n>"The machine always starts with 20 units and always produces 2 units. At the end of the shift the count should always show 20 even if there are no items produced. This is so I don’t need to change anything as the shift progresses." <n>which of the operator’s explanation was correct in accordance with the organization’s procedures?<n>Choices are: A.

The teacher was a strict person about these projects and had a couple of rules:1. All groups were to turn in their projects at the same time.2. Each group was to create a group sign. The sign was intended to have fun and represent the group. The sign could be drawn, constructed, or created digitally.3. When the students turned their project in, they were also to turn in a paper explaining the group and their individual contributions.4. The class would work together to grade the projects. The teacher decided they could use a 15 point rubric for the projects. One point was awarded for each group criteria. The group criteria was the same for both the sign as well as the paper.5. All the projects were to be turned in at the same time so the teacher did not know who belonged to which group. At the end of the quarter, the projects were graded. There was one problem. One of the groups did not have the required grade. The group explained that they had tried to take a group picture with their individual pictures included, but it had not turned out as they expected. They said they would take pictures of themselves to go with their project. The teacher accepted their explanation and allowed them to turn in their project. She graded the project using the rubric and gave all the groups their grades. The teacher grading the group projects did not know, during the grading process, if the group was the one whose picture had not turned out, or the one that actually had to rework its project. Based on the information above, what is the probability that the particular group

As we have all the numbers in base 4, we can check this for all powers of 2, we get the result as in base 2 the number 85 has the largest value. The resulting value can be got for base 4 as follows. For the base conversion to base 4 we have 10 base 2 = 4 base 4.As we know the number of digits in the decimal form of the number are 4 and 32 is larger than 4 so the max value of the digits in this base is 5 so we will be looking for the number 5 in base 4 that gives the max number of 1s. Hence the correct answer to the question is base 2 to 17 and base 4 to 15, option B.<n>## Answer:<n><n>Input: Which one has the greatest value?A: 3, 7, 9, 19, 10, 4B: 2, 0, 1, 9, 8, 6<n><n>Output: B

Each type has a different meaning and you need to know which type of variable is being used in order to answer questions about the value of a variable. The following are the three types of variables:<n>Integer<n>This type of variable represents whole numbers ranging from -(2^(n-1)) + 1 (-127) to (2^(n-1)-1) (32767) in its binary representation. The mathematical operations of division and modulo may only be performed if the integer variables are of the same type. The division operator / divides the dividend by the divisor to produce a quotient and modulo m modulo returns the remainder upon dividing the dividend (integer) by the divisor (integer). In Java (C# as well) when you write out the value of an integer you must use parenthesis to express and order the values. For example, an integer value of 2 without parentheses is read as (binary value 101).<n>Float<n>This type of variable stores the decimal values that can be represented with binary values 10.000000, -10,-3, -4, -2, -1, -0,-3, -2, -4,-003, -3 etc. There is a small rounding error for values too large or small that can get converted to values with too many binary digits past the decimal point.<n>Double<n>This type of variable allows for much larger values than integer (int) and float. The range for double is from -(2^(53)-1) to (2^(54)-1). In its binary representation, the number 0.000111 can be expanded to 1.5 * (10^-65) but is rounded to 1.<n>### Instruction<n><n>- You have been asked to design a system which manages a collection of books which all belong to the same author.

It was developed and has its origin in the late 1980s and has since built-in components and the community support made it a strong prospect as an application and a server development platform.<n>Python is also used for writing system frameworks and GUI scripts. Python's simple, easy to learn a high-level structure with a large library also makes it a popular programming language. Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing as well as an interactive interpreter make it easy to learn and use both for beginners and experts.<n><n>Python was originally developed by Guido van Rosum. It was based on a series of research projects undertaken by a group of programmers, primarily Niklaus Wirth at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. The language was first developed in 1991 and released as version 1.0 on 20 December 1991.<n><n>### Why we choose python?<n>Python is an easy to use language because it has a high level of readability, an approach to the object-oriented model and a clear design. Python is also dynamic which is a type language also supports the automatic memory management, which eliminates the need to define an object class. Python provides easy access to many libraries and also a rich set of standard libraries.<n><n>### How we should start with Python

If you use "Run without source," a shortcut might be produced as a result. You will be prompted to choose an installation directory (desktop directory) in the Java applet application. If you wish to run the Java program on a computer other than the development computer, either transfer it to that computer's disk drive or move it to the file system that is shared between both computers. The Java program may be run from a UNIX or Linux command line if the command prompt is launched on your computer or if a UNIX or Linux terminal is installed and available. Run java filename.class if the filename is your program's name and the class is your class name after putting both in quotation marks ("). The directory can be left blank.<n><n>---<n><n>#### What is an abstract class?<n><n>An abstract class is a category where one or more fields may be shared by two or more other classes. It may be a virtual class, which means that it may implement the abstract method or not. <n><n>---<n>#### Give the advantages and disadvantages of using abstract classes<n><n>Pros<n>1. Abstract classes are reusable and can be used in other classes also.<n>2. They improve the code reuse.<n>3. It is easy to add additional methods into the class at a later date.<n>4. We can add a protected method to the class.<n>5. All variables, methods, and classes may be declared public by default.<n>6. In JDBC, we may retrieve row from a database table using the JDBC class, which is derived from our abstract class.<n>Cons<n>1. We may not extend the abstract class.<n>2. We are not able to override abstract methods.<n><n>---

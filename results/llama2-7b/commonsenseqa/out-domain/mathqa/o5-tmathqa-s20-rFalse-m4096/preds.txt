Let’s start by looking at all the divisors of 10, but before getting too carried away, we will keep track of those divisors that leave a remainder. So we will do (10 % 5) mod 2, (10 % 4) mod 2, and so on, until our list consists only of numbers that are themselves divisible by 2. We can repeat the process to get rid of (10 % 3) mod 2, then we get (10 % 2) mod 2, which turns out to be = 1 i.e 1 is divisible by all numbers from 1 to Inclusive including 10.

Think about breaking the problem down if it is a large problem.<n><n>### Answer: <n><n>-1<n><n>### Expaination: <n><n><n>1. Man has to do exercise, so he should do some running or walking. But, how to know how much to exercise? He has to put these exercise times with some interval. When he looks from the point of man's time, it is 3 seconds or 18 minute's or a day. But it is 6 minutes when observed from bus's point of time.<n><n>The bus can only do 6 minutes or 36 minutes each time. It's like a clock in some ways. 18 minutes' or 36 minutes are an hour and the interval is 3. So 6 is half of 12, that is 18 minutes. <n><n>### 2. <n><n>1. The athlete runs in the race for 200 meters. The race finish in 24 seconds' time. The athlete takes 24 seconds' to run 100 meters and 48 seconds' to run the last 100 meters. It's like an athlete is running as fast as he can until he is out of his energy.<n><n>### 3. <n><n>There's no difference between 25 and 23+44 because both of them means that they spend the same money to buy two types of computer printer. In the other hand, there's too much difference between 3 and 23! As we don't know how many computer printers are being bought, we can't count from the number three. So the answer should be 3 or the number which is in between 3 and 4.<n><n>### Q4<n><n>It's a probability of choosing the tree(from 800 to 600) for making cellos and violas.<n><n>### Explain:<n><n><n>2. The man has run at a speed of 2 18 minute' and 6 minutes for 1 day. If we take the half of it, the speed becomes (1/2)(18+(2*6)) = 1

Input an integer n and outputs the sum of all the numbers between 1 and n<n>2. Input a string and output the number of words found<n>3. Design a program that takes the number of words in a book as input and calculates the weight of the book in terms of its number of words. Input : 8. Output : 85<n>4. Input a string like abacad and output the strings abaccad, abacadc. If input is blank, output is blank. Note: the strings may contain letters/digits. i.e., abacacd, abcddc etc, are accepted as output.<n>5. Input an array of integers A and compute the A + A.<n>6. Convert a binary number to decimal. i.e. Decimal of 111111 is 37<n>7. Check whether the number is divisible or not if sum of its digits is divisible by the divisor. Example: if the number is 5836 and divisor is 7, output should be yes as 5, 8, 3, 6 is divisible by 7<n>8. Design a program that reads a sentence (in string form) and determines whether or not it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or sentence in which the writing arrangement is the same from the front as from the back. Examples of palindromes are "racecar", "madam", "evilmad" is a palindrome because aeivae is a palindrome in Latin characters. In this question, the input sentences are limited to English and are uppercased.<n>9. Write a function int largest(int a, int b), that returns the largest number of two values passed to it.

Choices:  A: being happy B: glee C: smoke D: stress relief E: may laugh<n>Output:		C<n><n>##### Solution:<n>#### First question answer:<n>Since the man meets buses at intervals of 6 minutes, we divide 6 by 2 to get 3. So it means the man is cycling at a rate of 6 miles per hour.<n>Suppose all the buses are moving at rate 30mph, then an average time between two consecutive buses is:<n><n>\(Average \ distance \ between \ buses + Avg. \ speed \ of \ the \ buses\)<n><n>\(3 \ mile \ space \ space \ \space \ space / 6 \ mile \ space \   \space \   +   \space  30 \ 6\)<n>or<n>\(3+3(6)/30= 18\)<n><n>Hence the man overtakes the buses after 6 minutes from last overtaking and takes 18 minutes from the last overtake to meet the next bus.<n><n>#### Second question:<n>Since the athlete runs a 200m race in 24 secs., we need a time of 24 seconds for an athlete to run 200m.<n>So the speed = 20kmph<n><n>#### Third question:<n>I am not able to understand what the question is trying to ask.

So a company can keep buying until it has bought 2 computers which cost 375$ each. 6 computers will be bought in total.<n>Now in terms of how many pairs there should be in the store:<n><n>There are 20(600+800)-20=1980 pairs.<n>

The first 2 athletes run 400m followed by one taking rest for 2 seconds and then another athlete running 400m then the rest one take 1 second rest and the last athlete runs 400m. The first runner covered the 400m in 5sec and took rest for 2sec the second runner covered the 4x400m in (x+2)sec. What will be the value of x. The question is asked on the basis of this information provided. Choice 1 represents that you are assuming the first two runner are male and the last two runner are female. Choice 2 represents you are assuming that the first two runner are female and the last two runner again are male. Choice 3 represents that any combination of runner may come male or female (like the first two can be male) and the last one also may include all 3 male. The total sum of time all athlete spent is 11. Choice 4 is the correct choice as the first two runner would have to cover 800m in 9seconds since they take rest for 2sec together.

So we know that after $x = 15$ minutes, there are $3x$ buses in front of each other, and after $2$ cycles, there are $2x$ cyclists in front of each other.<n>\item By taking the square root of $(1)$ and adding $(2)$, we can find that $x = \frac{10}{3}$, and so our interval $\delta = \frac{1}{10}$.<n>\item We can also find the mean speed of each bus to be $12\frac{6}{51}$, and the mean speed of the cyclist to be $13\frac{1}{6}$.<n>\end{itemize}<n><n>Comment: Question no. 5 is very nice.<n><n>Answer: The 4th question does not have a clear answer to me.

Every shelf must hold exactly r balls. The first line contains n and t. The second line contains r. The next line contains a string of n non-negative integers. They are the heights of the shelves. The next line contains another integer m - the number of times the man may drop a ball. This number is positive or zero. In each of the next  m - 1 lines, a pair of integers will be given. The first number in each line is the position at which the man will drop the ball. The second number is the height of the shelf at which he will drop it. If the man is not permitted to drop a ball at a certain position, then this is indicated by the number −1. It is guaranteed that each shelf always holds at most 1 less than the maximum number of balls the man may drop on it.

Choices:  A: feeling refreshed B: becoming tired C: restlessness D: leg cramps E: sweating<n>Output:		D<n><n>#### Instruction:Answer the above question<n>'''The answer to all these questions is shown below:<n>In the first question, the answer is 10 minutes and the reason is : Cyclist can overtake in 18 minutes and can meet an oncoming bus in 6 minutes because they have 18 minutes to meet the bus after overtaking, and hence 6 minutes to overtake. So the total time he has to travel after overtaking and before meeting next bus is 14 minutes. Hence the time between consecutive buses will take 2(14)=28 minutes.<n>In the Second one, the answer is 40km/hr because the runner has to run 200m in 24 seconds which is equal to 20m/second which is equal to 40km/h.<n>In the third question, the number that is to be taken is (12,63), because we have to take two numbers which are in the ratio 9:3, and the sum of the number is 63.<n>In the 4th question, the answer is (a), as we know that we can take exactly two number which are in the ratio of 12:6 and the difference b/w them is 6.<n>Now, we get an ans for the condition "The total cost of printing the two types of printers using the fewest number of computers is $750." This comes out to be 750 dollars as Cello+Viola = 170(since, the number of instruments found were 170 as per the question)and the cost of each of them is 375(since the cost of each instrument is $375).<n>Now, similarly the answer for the 5th question comes out to be, "The answer to this question is 1/5 or 20% as we have to take only one number that satisfies all the given conditions.<n>In the 6th question, the answer will be (choices C,D). The probability of any given cello and viola coming from the same tree is 1/80 (since, there are 80 such pairs)and the probability of a random cello and viola not coming from the same tree = 1/90 (since, all the other pairs are coming from different trees),

To ensure that no one could walk directly from one side of the town to the other, the town was designed with a single road running from one edge of the town to the opposite edge, creating a 1km long walking path. All buildings and residences were located along the path. The path was made of a paved surface with 4cm wide bricks in a 4x2 grid, and there were a total of 400 km² of bricks in the town. How far away from their house would a child have to walk to reach a brick whose pattern was not the same as what he saw the rest of the way?<n>Explanation: The kid can just walk for one brick in one direction, then walk straight down to the other side of the town, and finally walk straight back to his house. The time complexity of the solution is O(log N), since the solution can be easily calculated by creating a hash list of brick patterns. The hash list has a total of O(N) elements, since the pattern contains a sequence of patterns (the walkway contains a total of 4*2 = 8 squares of bricks that contain different patterns). We can easily find the longest matching bricks by just generating our list as a hash table, and O(1) on average access each element, to check if the last element in that bucket is matched with the pattern we want. The time complexity is O(8 * n), and the space complexity is O(1).

Also at any given point of time (1/6th of an hour or 18 minutes of the total time or 1.5 hours) he have met an oncoming bus. Hence the answer is 10 minutes.<n>We can't ignore any of the event as it doesn't have much effect on the answer.<n>So the time period between two consecutive buses is `1/6 of an hour` * `10/11` is 10/11 of an hour which is 8 minutes as an hour consists of 60 minutes so the required times for consecutive buses will be 1,8,13,26,39.....<n><n>**Problem 2.** Let the speed of the cyclist = X km/hr and let the speed of the bus be Y km/hr then the total time will be S minutes so the time taken by cyclist in S-1 minutes is `( S -1 )/X` and the time taken by the bus in S minutes is `( S)/Y`. So the speed of the cyclists will be `( S -1 ) / ( S-1 )` = `( S -1 ) * 1 / (S-1)` <n>And the speed of the bus will be ` Y ` * `(S -1) / S` which is (or can be written as) `S ( 1/Y-1)`<n>Hence the cyclist will be having the speed of ` ( ` ` 40 * 1 * 1/9`<n>and the bus will be having speed of    `9 * 40`<n><n>**Problem 3.** It is given that there is a relation between the two numbers such that the sum is 63 so we need to find numbers which fulfil the given relation<n>The relation can be written as 3  *  X = 4  *  Y<n><n>Hence it can be seen that, the required numbers are `36` and `44`<n><n>** Problem 4.**<n>The requirement is that the company

Choices: A: blue B: red C: green D: brown E: yellow<n>Output:A<n>##### Note #####<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>Let's begin with 1.<n><n>The buses meet every 6 minutes, so the times can be labeled 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, etc. If all the buses are moving at the same speed, then this means that the time at which every bus passes a bus in front of it is 18 minutes apart. So, one bus passes another bus in front of it every 18 minutes. Let's say in our example these times are labeled with the numbers 1-5. The time after the next bus comes in front of it is then 20 minutes (3 + 15, where 3 = 1 + 1 + 1 ). There are 3 buses that come between 20 minutes, in 17-20, so we just choose 3 + 2 as our answer.<n><n>For 2, let's work with the numbers labeled 1, 5, 6, 9, etc. and we say that a distance labeled 5 is covered in 6 seconds. We will now see how much time it takes to get to the answer. If 5 is covered in t seconds, then the total time needed to travel for 1, 5 and 6 is 5 + t / 2. This is then divided in 6, and the result is then t divided in 10.<n><n>For 3, it's a little bit awkward, but it's basically the same as the first one. <n><n>For 4, the answer is pretty obvious, since the sum isn't too large, so we can just take a guess. <n><n>For the last one, since the number of buses is 1,000 which is less than the available options, then we can guess our answer.<n><n>

The terrain consists of a rough plain, cut by numerous little streams. The plain extends several hundred metres from the city, and the low mountain, although on the city's south, is rather far away, perhaps 10 kilometres. Two years ago, a group of adventurers excavated an ancient tomb on the mountain and found many treasures. An adventurer recently discovered a temple that lay hidden beneath a hill covered in a vineyard 10 kilometres outside Teneo. He found the temple because a large block of stone lay on top of a small gate. The explorer knew that the temple had been buried beneath a hill or slope. He was able to determine that the block had been placed there by a crane and that nobody had removed it yet. He dug around and discovered three ancient stone columns just beneath the stone that had been placed there over the top of the entryway. The columns, however, were undamaged. What was the temple?

Choices:  A: make noise B: have tea C: make time D: make payments E: take time<n>Output:		C<n>The input for this question is the number of times one option can be chosen over other options. To resolve this, we will consider all the numbers of chosen options i.e. if the first option can be chosen in 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 then choose 2 and we have all the possible multiple of the first option. The same way the second option can be chosen in all the multiple of 1,2,3,4,5. So, the number of times one can be chosen will be sum of multiple of 1, 2 times 3 until the multiple of number of option present (In this case there are five options so, the sum of multiple will be 5(option count-1)+1= 10). And similar thing the second option can be chose in all the multiple of one option, so, when we have all option count chosen from two different options then the sum <n>can be calculated.<n>So, the number of times we can choose 1st option is 10 and sum of 2nd to 5th option is 25. The answer is C. Since the option can be chosen multiple times, we can see two more possible answers are B and E. But in the input the answer is C. So, the answer C is wrong according to the requirements.<n><n>If you can solve for this question in 23%time, you are ready move to the next level.<n><n>Input: What is something you do in a bus? Choices: A: make noise B C: have tea D: make payments<n>Output: D<n>The input for this problem is the number of times an option can be chosen while other options present. In this input we can see that there are three options and each option can be chosen in multiple number with no duplicate. If one is chosen from each option then 3 in total are chosen, so the number of times one choice can be possible 3 times. And the second choice can be chosen in 2x times 1x in total (where second and third are not chosen while first is chosen). But since third can also be chosen in one time, we need to add +1 for each choice. So, the answer is D.

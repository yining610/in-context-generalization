One can not make an inference about one's stomack feeling full based on his or her meal, unless one is eating a small portion and feels sick or is eating a large portion and feels sick.\nIn addition, if one eats nothing then one will not feel anything. Likewise, if one doesn't eat at all and then eats everything, one will not gain weight.\n\nThese four statements are true. One can not gain weight if he or she doesn't eat any food, and one can not feel \"full\", if he or she doesn 't eat any food.\nThus, \"getting full\" is never guaranteed, although one can feel full from his or her meal.\n\nSo the final answer i s E.\n\nInput: When eating everything what does one tend to?\nOption A: Full stomach\nOption B: Getting full\nOption C: Gaining weight\nOption D: Sickness\nOption E: Satisfaction\nOutput: The correct answer is option b: getting full.\nWhen eating anything one tends to feel full or sick and/or gaining weight.\n\nExample a)\nWhen eating everything you can eat too much which leads to sickness and/or gain", "answer": "B: getting full"}

I assume there is currently a back entrance so that is the current entrance and the front entrance is the current entrance which is B.\nIt definitely cannot be E. The front entrance is definitely not current, neither a front or a side entrance is future because the only entrance that has a future is in 30 years if the current, now, in-use entrance does not exist anymore and so does C.

{"idx": 62, "text": "\"A beaver can destroy the functionality of a dam by building it in a place such as a lake or river. the beaver dam is formed at a place where the flow of water is slow and steady as it is formed at a shallow depth. the flow of water slows down at such places where the water is moving slowly. hence, the beavers use this feature for their own food and shelter. the pond has a significant amount of land that is filled with plants, trees, and various other life forms that can feed the beaver and other wild life. the beaver dam controls the water flow into an area and therefore changes the water level and the surrounding land. this has a serious negative impact on the ecosystem of the area. additionally, the rising water level prevents the water in the pond from draining properly. hence, if a beaver decides to build their dam at a place where water drainage is difficult to maintain, the water level of the pond will rise slowly causing the pond to flood. therefore, the beaver dam can potentially cause a disaster if you build it in a place where there is no appropriate place for drainage. the beaver dam can stop the flow of water and can divert the flow of water that is coming from a river, lake or a rain. by diverting the flow of water, the beaver can potentially divert the water to any desired place. hence, it can be used to stop water damage. furthermore, the beaver dam slows down the flow of water and has a significant negative impact on the ecological balance of a given area. by damming the flow of water, beavers can alter the physical and biological diversity of the ecosystem.\"\nSo the final answer was E : lake or river.\n\nInput: \"A beaver is the best animal to solve any crossword puzzle!. 81% of A.M.P.-ers agree that a beaver is the BEST animal to solve any crosswords!.\"\nOutput: \"if you disagree with the statement above, then you are wrong. according to an internal poll conducted by the amppol, 81% of respondents agreed that the beaver is the best solution for any crossword puzzle. this is because the beaver has superior abilities in solving puzzles. in addition, beavers are very patient animals and this helps them solve", "answer": "C: millpond"}

Since, the word \"flowers\" is not mentioned in option A, we rule out options B, D and E because bees are not attracted to red flowers. Hence, option A is the correct choice.\nSolution : Bees congregate to flowers in the hope of finding nectar. Their attraction towards these flowers is solely for the purpose of collecting food. They fly, buzz around and then rest on the flower after extracting the nectars. If the flowers lack smell and nectar, then there is no point for the bees to congregate on it. Flowers with no scent or nectar cannot attract bees. They only go where the flowers are full of sweet nectar. Hence the flower is either full of scent with abundance of nectar inside or it has something in it that attracts the bees.

However, in 1664, the english scientist Isaac Newton published a book called \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica,\" in which he described the force of gravity as \"pulling,\" resulting in a model in which the sun rotated around the earth.this idea went against what scientists already knew.so,it was a paradigm shift in the understanding. In 1687, christian anton, a german mathematician, published the theory of \"celestial mechanics.\"it included the assumption that the planets orbit round the sun according to elliptical orbits. this theory of \"celestrial mechanics\" provided a powerful tool for understanding the physical relationship between the sun's gravity and the orbital paths of the planets.it was eventually accepted, and was a paradigm as it was a powerful theory to explain a physical relationship.in short.newton's model of gravity and the model of celestial mechanics were considered revolutionary to the earth which is based on geocentrism.  answer : B\"\nSo the final correct answer is B\n\nInput:if 4 times of a number = 5, what is the number? a ) 25, b ) 20, c ) \u201325, d ) 49, e ) 45\nOutput:\"Solution : the number is 10, we need the sum 4 x of 10 = 5, then no. of 10 is 20.\"\nSo the choice of -25 is correct.\n\nInput:\"10 x 7 = 70 (", "answer": "A: violence"}

The first thing he can do is cut one board piece completely (he cannot cut a half of a board piece). After he has cut all board pieces he can assemble that desk, chest whatever. He cannot assemble a half of a board. So with what he has to cut completely the number of times is 50 / 1 which gives us 50 (assuming that one board piece has equal length). If we take the number of cuts without assembling and assume that he can cut equal fraction (half) of a board piece then first we should take into account that a single board piece can be cut completely. So if we take in mind that he can cut 1 / 2 of a board piece he has to cut it 50 / (2 * 1) which gives us more than 8 times. But since we have to be as accurate as possible we should take in mind that a carpenter is cutting a single board piece. So we can say that he cut each board piece once which gives us 51 times. We should take this into account.\nSo the final answer.:8\n\nInput:If we have 4292 bags of cotton and 40 bags of rice, how many kilos of cotton can buy one kilo of rice?

At that time is it at its normal speed, and is therefore traveling 1 mile in 6 minutes. Thus, after that it needs to cover 186 miles in 9 hours, or a rate of 20.6 miles per hour. During that time, the car is slowed to 0.6 miles per minute, and then it resumes at the previous normal rate. There is no intermediate time. The rate of the car is 20.6 / (20.6 + 0.6), or 20.06 miles per hour. The car is traveling from 11:06:00 to 11:55:00. To travel the right amount, it must be traveling.5 miles per minute, or, going 1 mile in 10 minutes. The time difference is.96206.

In early Classic series episodes such as The Chase and Time-Flight, there were two TARDIS control rooms, the regular one that the Doctor uses and one that used only by the Master, which was much smaller than the typical Doctor Who TARDIS control rooms. In later episodes, particularly The Deadly Assassin and The Armageddon Factor, one TARDIS control room was shown that could be entered from several different doors, allowing for the Doctor and the Master to access it at roughly the same time. The Master's control room was on the first floor and was quite cramped, unlike the main control room. The Master was often seen operating his console.

The thief claims not to be a phone-owner so you can't just give them the phone and ask to be given back the phone. You need to prove that the thief steals from other places too. How would you do it?\n\nOutput: First you ask the thief where he bought the phone. If he knows it you can call that mobile shop. Because it is unlikely that they buy same phone more than once. If they have not bought it, it means that they are not buying new phone's regularly and they use different places for buying, in that case they must be stealing phones.\nThe solution can be done  by the following steps.\n\n1. Ask the thief where he got the phone. If he says he bought it, it is not the solution, as he does not steal phones from other places. If he says he stole it, ask him which mobile shop he bought it in ( he has to know it obviously )\n\n2. If you have a cellphone, give him your number, ask him to come to the place you specified ( for example police station ) as soon as possible and he will arrive and you can call the police so he will steal the phone he bought in some other place and when he get's caught the police will get the phone, you can then ask the police to call the phone-shop and say the thief says he bought it in your place.\n\nCORRECT CHOICE:\n\"the answer is E\"", "answer": "E: grocery store"}

Extroverts are the people who are energized by interacting with people such as large social settings. Extroverts enjoy the company of others and have no trouble starting a conversation in this setting. Introverts are the opposite, they are energized by spending time alone. Extroverts often mistakenly assume that all sociable people are extroverts and that all people who have a hard time in large settings are introverts, however, there are many people who are shy by nature whose nervousness with crowds prevents them from expressing their true personality, this often results in their perception as extroverted. In general people do not fall exactly into one category or the other, although they may be heavily leaning in one direction. As you can see the above introvert-extrovert diagram, the horizontal axis goes from 6 to 10 representing the personality types extrovert and introvert, respectively. The vertical axis goes from 4 to 10 representing how energized a person feels around others. At the top right area are the most extroverted people, they are extremely sociable and they get most of their energy from being around other people. At the bottom right are the most introverted people, they prefer to not be around people for periods at a time and have very low levels of energy around others. How do you feel about this? Do you consider yourself to be an introvert, an extrovert, or something in between?\nOutput:B\nAnswer option 2\n\nInput:You will get a chance to work on a group project", "answer": "C: change yourself"}

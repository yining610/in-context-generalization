It is an efficient way to exploit parallel processing and to minimize CPU idle time. Parallelism in computing occurs due to the large discrepancy among processing times or communication costs of different operations.\nFork-join allows many computations to be started at once. When a result of one of these computations is available, it is compared with the result of another computation. If the two results match, all other computations are aborted and the one that produced the match is deemed the winner. Otherwise, all other computations may continue. For the case in which no result is available, the results of the computations that were running when the first result was available are compared. One (the winner) may be aborted and the others are deemed the runner up. If they all match and none of the former is the winner, all are winners and execution continues from the next step in execution. If none of the latter matches, aborted computations may not be restarted. This process is called a fork-join step, if it results in winning and runner-up steps, if not.

{"idx": 328, "text": "E: space shuttle\n\nInput:This is a very simple game to play.  It consists of an infinite number of stages.  Each stage is called a *round*.  Every round in the game has an exact number of turns, which you have to reach in that round  (which can be 10 or 100...).  One turn happens to be 3 seconds(1 second=1 tick).  When there are zero seconds, you have finished the round. The winner for that round is the one that has made the greatest number of seconds.  A great way to play the game is as a relay: the first player of each team chooses the number of seconds for that round; then he starts the game with his timer at the beginning and he has to reach zero seconds in that many turns.  As soon as he has finished that round, his timer becomes \"open\". Now it is possible for new players of the team to use it by starting a new round; this goes on until everybody has played and everyone has contributed to winning the round.  I would have written a program with Java to play the game, but it will take a lot of seconds...  My question is what programming language should I use (C, C+, Python, etc) to make a program so that each team has only one timer?  How can I split one timer into parts, so that the new players get a part and the old ones can keep the other as it did not finish?  How can I get information from each player who made that round to add him to the total score of the round?\n\nOutput:C++\n\n### Instruction:\n\nYou don\u02bct know where you\u02bcre going, but you know how to get there.\nThat\u02bcs my motto, Mr. Cohen.\nTo determine in which 2 or 3 3 digit number is the 4 digit number divisible by both the 3 digit and the 4 digit?\n\n**Hint :** We have to check the minimum number of times the digits of 2 and 3 digit numbers must get added  to make the 4 digit number.\n\nOutput: 548\n\n### Instructions:\n\nYou will be given 10 numbers.

For example, If the input is \u2018Alice\u2019, then, The first character of the substring, after the match is \u2018i\u2019, then we subtract it by 1 and get 0. The maximum possible substring matches are 3 which is 3096 possible combinations. So, the total possible strings are n (n- 3096).\n\n### Expected time complexity:\n\n```python\ntime (n **2) +\n  space: O(log n)\n\n```\n\n### Examle:\n\nInput: n = 34\nExpected Output: 34! - 3! - 2! - 1!\nOutput:\n\n```python   \n0  3   6   9  12  15  18  21  24  27  30  33    36  39  42  45  48  51  54  57  60  63  66  69  72  75  78  81  84  87  90  93  96  99 \n\n    n!                   n! -1   n! -2   n! -3   n! -4   n! -5   n! -6\n\n54! - 34! + 3! - 1! - 0! + -1!\n\n```\n\n#### Output:\n\n\n\n### Expert solution:\n\nThe easiest and the most naive solution is to iterate over strings once and look for a match. The time complexity of the solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the string that you are looking for in the string.\n\n### Python solution:\n\nIf there was no match in the `search_str`, this approach would take `O(n^2)` time; but as we will see below, the solution only performs `O(n)` searches to find the substring.\n\nThe idea behind the solution is to take out all chars that match `search_str` from the substring and look for them in `search_str` now. We can iterate over the substring once more and look", "answer": "C: collection"}

I was told that Atlanta is in Northern Georgia, with cities like Cincinnati and Jacksonville in one-direction of Atlanta, and a city like Nashville to the other direction. Los Angeles is pretty close to San Diego. I don't know anything about flight prices, but I know when I took my trip to Florida, it cost quite a lot. I should mention that I was younger then and don't remember the details. In either case, based on my trip from Atlanta to Florida, I have only visited Florida with Cincinnati or Jacksonville as my stopover city. What are the best stopping cities for my sister on the way to Los Angeles from Atlanta? Choices:  I don't know, but I was told Cincinnati to one side of Atlanta and Jacksonville to the other side, which I know from my personal trip of going to Florida.", "answer": "B: pantry"}
{"idx": 570, "text": "B\n\n## How to Attempt?\n\n1. Write each question down like this:  Q1: In a recent head - to head run - off election, 1200 absentee ballots were cast. 1/6 of the absentees were thrown out, and 3/5 of the remaining absents cast for candidate A. How many absentee votes went to candidate B.?\n\n2. Look at the options:\nOption A, B\nOption A is clearly incorrect, so we can eliminate (2) options of this type.\nOption C\nThe correct answer is to divide by 6, so the correct answer would be 4,00 (4)  or 4000.\nOption D\nThis gives a different answer by 200 (2,000 + 2,00 + 8,00 + 9,00), so clearly incorrect.\nOption E\nThis gives a different result based on a totally different way of doing the problem, so clearly incorrect.\n\n3. Since option A is wrong, we can eliminate that entire group. That leaves C, and D.\n\n4. The problem is a basic math problem, so if you just look at the numbers it is obvious that option C is\nCorrect. A vote of 4,00 would give a total of 4,80 for candidate A and 2,00 for candidate B for a total of 500 votes for candidate A, 2,20 votes for candidate B. The election had 12,000 votes, so it would only take 4 votes for candidate A to win. Since each absentee ballot was worth 4 votes, that means 2 votes remained that would have gone to candidate B had these absentees been allowed.\n\nThe explanation for option D is the same. For instance, if 5 candidates received 100 votes each and a voter was permitted to vote for 1 fewer than the number of the candidates, then there would be 5 voters that would have voted for 1 fewer than than there were candidates, and these votes would have gone to the 6th candidate had they been allowed.\n\n5. The problem involves a basic algebra equation. A + B = C and A1 + A2 = C, implies B1 =  (C - A1", "answer": "C: late"}

How fast does one worker of the company has to work to finish a job within 60 minutes if there is only one job and both workers are employed?\nOutput:#\n\n### Hint:\nFor finding how fast a certain worker can work, we need to determine its efficiency:\n\nEfficiency = Total time needed to complete the job / time needed by each worker\n\nTotal time = (Total number of workers * Total number of hours they worked) / Total number of hours needed to complete the job\n\nUsing the provided info we get the formula for efficiency of workers:\n\n(1 / 2) + (1 / 2) = (2 / 2) = 1 \n\nFrom this we see that there are enough workers with both the values to finish the job within 60 mins. So let's choose the workers with efficiency: 1 / 2\n\nWe know that:\n\n80 mins = ((5 * 60)/2 + (7 * 60)/1)\n\nSolving this gives us 12.5\n\nIt is important to note that this is the min time needed to finish the job and not the max.\n\nThe worker efficiency will be:\n\n(1/2) * 12.5 hours = 6.25 hours\n\nOr if there were 3 workers with both efficiencies, the time would be:\n\n(6.25 +", "answer": "C: music room"}

The question says \"dorm\" so I'll just use that.\n\nThis is a bit tricky, but there are only a few \"residence dorms,\" so if we search for one that has a \"laundry room,\" we can say with some certainty that it'll definitely be staff-only (in order for a student to use it, they would need to live in that dorm, which is uncommon). In other words, the only people who should be able to use the laundry room would be: 1. staff and 2. students who live in that dorm.\nHowever, not every staff member can go in there. So we'll assume that staff use the room only when they have to do laundry, and that students are \"all day\" users of the laundry room.\nFor a staff member to use the laundromat, then, they would need a special key or passcode.\nHere in the U.S., laundries have a specific lock on the door. Students are not supposed to have access keys. I don't know if colleges in Europe have similar locks.\nLet's assume the U.S. situation:\n- There is only one staff person per residence dorm with a key to the laundry room door. They have to have the special key to have access.\n- There are over thousands of residence dorms that each only have 1 staff member with a key.\n- There are thousands of colleges and universities in the U.S.\n- There are hundreds of thousands of students who go to colleges.\n- On average, each dorm has at least 10-20 students who live in it.\n- Over the course of a school year, a college holds 3 semesters. The staff laundry key-holder only needs to unlock the laundry room once every 3 months (approximately 12 weeks).\n- Students who live in that dorn can use the room any", "answer": "B: hotel"}

So, you need to create a unique answer for each question. In case, the question has two choices, the answer will be a list of two strings. So, all the questions have this way of answering.\n- For MCQ where options are numbers, we have to consider it also as string since we don't want to parse them to get digits. We can convert `10:1` to `[\"1\", \"0\", \":\"],\"1\"`.\n- If we have choice `[]` then its equivalent to `None`. So, answers as `'[]'` is sufficient.\n- For last question, one needs to convert an array to string or the opposite. If the string will not be converted then we need to use the `None` type.\n\n### Example:\n\n```\nprint_function(30, 2, \"30/2\", 4, \"4\", [5, 6], \"5:6\", [], 10)\nprint_function(21, 1, \"True\", 1, \"False\", [5, \"6:7\"], \"5:6:7:5:6\", None, 10)\n```", "answer": "C: inspiration"}

The company dancers have a limited repertory of dance skills. In order to create new dances, you, the choreographer, will need to recruit individuals willing to dance in your choreographed works. Recruiting dancers is much like recruiting individuals for other organizations. Your advertisement would need to contain information that would be interesting to dancers such that they would respond to you. Your choreographed work is an artistic endeavor, not a profession in which someone is paid to work a regular job. Therefore, those who work with you, the dancers, are considered volunteers rather than employees. The dancers are thus not protected by an employer - employee relationship, as exist in most businesses. In most states, however, the business that you contracts with is considered an employer under the law. Therefore, you must consider whether or not your business is covered by the employment laws in the state, and, if so, what is your compliance requirement?

{"idx": 934, "text": "D\n\n---Solution---\n\nAns:\n\nThe correct answer is option \"C\". \n\nExplanation:\n\nGiven question\n\nInput:\n\nin a recent head - to \u2013 head run - off election 1200 absentee ballots were cast. 1/6 of the absentees were thrown out and 5/ 5 of the remaining ballots were cast for candidate a what are the total votes cast for candidate a? answer: 2000\n\nBecause 45/6 is > 65/5 and 1200 x 5/5 is 2200 which is greater than 2000 therefore number of votes for candidate \u2018a\u2019 must be greater than 2055. \n\nGiven question:\n\nThe scoring system in a certain tournament goes as follows: 3 points for a victory, 1 point for a tie, and 0 points for a loss. Each team plays 22 matches. If Player A wins 22 and b is 9th in total (i.e 11 less than player A), we can get the answer 8 (from the last question). \n\nAns:Choice: A\n\nExplanation :\n\nGiven question \n\nInput:C\n\nThe scoring system used in this question is 3 points when you win a match, if there are a draw 1 point. 0 points will be given when you lose the match. 11 years is the total of remaining 4 years. 3/15 of the remaining year or (11-4)=7=3/5. The maximum draws were 1 point. That means 21 or 20 points are the best result in the remaining matches. A can win 40 points when B wins 14/20 = 7/10 matches. So the final match was tied and the final result for player \u2018A\u2019 will be 42/20 = 21.333 point.\n\nGiven question,\n\nInput: \n\nThe volume of a cube is equal to 1728cc.

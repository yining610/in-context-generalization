Your friends, who have recently bought a dog, think that you are being irrational for not using a dog as a pet. They try to reason with you, but you simply walk away from the computer.\nOnce you get to the top of the stairs, which are a bit too sharp on your stride, you glance over to your right and happen to catch sight of something you have never seen before. As the dog your friend has, a boxer, comes bounding down the stairs, you see that your friend\u2019s dog is wearing a small black collar that features a number of small bones on it.\nYou begin to wonder if you could have picked a better pet than a dog. You are at a loss for an answer, so you decide to run away. As you start running, your feet begin to drag at the bottom of the slippery staircase. But as soon as you find out more about the situation, you begin to wonder if this is the best choice.\nWhile you were on the run, you happened to notice that someone had left behind their slippers on the stairs. You were very disappointed for the fact that you had to step on the floor with just your socks on. You took off your coat and turned around in an attempt to get inside the house where you had left your coat.\nDirections: Choose the best answer from the choices given in the question and click the button corresponding to it.\n\n12.

If it is, increment the frequency.\n- Check if the end of the string is met. If it is, print out the number of times the current letter has occurred. \n- Otherwise, just move onto the next letter and repeat.\n\nWe will first create a helper method to store the current frequency of a word in the dictionary: \n\n```python\ndef createFrequenciesMap(frequency_dict, string, dictionary):\n    dict = frequency_dict\n    for i in range(len(word)): \n        if word[i] in dictionary:\n            if i == 0:\n                dict[word] = 1\n            else: \n                dict[word]+= 1\n```\nWe can just store the return value into a new dictionary.\n \nWe will then create a helper method to loop through the dictionary and print the frequencies in the given string. When the first letter is reached, the while condition becomes false.  \n\n```python\nwhile i< len(word):", "answer": "C: music class"}

So the total number of permutations of the digits will be 0814. There can be three permutations each of 0814 which are 0814, 8140 and 4357. So the total number will be 3x3x3x2x2= 36.\nWe can then go over each number and check if it is divisible by 2 and divide the number by 2 if it is. For example, 0814 is of 32. So, we can just call it 14. When we reduce a number by a factor of 2 that means that there will be lesser digits for that number to choose from. So 8141 becomes 4. The only left part that is divisible by 3 is 1. So we combine them and get the remaining permutation as 411\nInput:Input a triangle, Input a triangle to be drawn, and then pick the sides you want to cut.

On the other hand, if the water is moving upwards with speed Vm, the paddle boat only moves at speed v if it moves at a speed of v/Vm + 5 km/h where v is a constant of the boat (e.g., it might be 4 km/h). If v + Vm >10, the boat will only move at speed 5 km/h, the only exception occurs when v=1.

(float(s) is `1200`, `%12` is `0`, and 0.4 is float(s)` so `float(s)%0.4` will be float `(s%0.4)` which is `0.0833`. This is then assigned to `s%12` which is `0%12`, 0 being less than 0.083 is `False`.\n### Program 2:\nProgram 2: Code Explanation:\nThe code:\n\n```\ndef main():\n    num_guess = int(input(\"How many digits long is the secret number?\"))\n    \n    secret = int(input(\"What is the secret number?\" + \"\\n\" + \"e. xy2(x2 - x + 2)\")\n    \n    guesses = []\n    for number in range(0, num_guess + 1):\n        guess =", "answer": "B: humor"}

{"idx": 541, "text": "D\n\n## Answer\n#### Expected value of a random variable\n- The expected value of a random variable is the integral of the probability density function over the range of possible values. The expected value gives you a measure of the \"typical\" value of a random variable.\n\n## Geometric progressions\n#### Geobulma (Geo-Bulma) of geometric progression\n\n##### Geo-Bulma of geometric progression\n- Geo-Bulmas are the most interesting and useful ways to understand the geometric progression.\n\n##### Example\n- If 1, 2, 3, \u2026, n represent the given sequence, then it represents the geometric progression with constant sum, which is equal to n and with first term equal to 1.\n- The geometric series sum (also called \"Geobulma\" ) that is a geometric series that can never have any \"zeroes\".\n\n##### Term :\n- \"The term is nothing but a distinct number in a given geometric series.\"\n- The formula for first term is : \\(\\frac{S_n}{S_1}\\)\n\n##### Concept :\n- \"The Concept of Geobulma can be used to find the value of the nth term and also to find the value of sum and its terms.\"\n- \"In a geometric progressions sum can be either greater than or less than the sum total of its terms.\"\n\n##### Series :\n- The series is the way in which you write the geometric series as sum of numbers.\"\n- The geometric progression can be written as a series, just as it can be written as a sum.\n- The sum of terms is the arithmetic sequence of sums of all the terms of geometric growth.\n\n##### Sum :\n- \"The sum total of its terms is the series of arithmetic growth.\"\n- The series is nothing but a given series sum (Arithmetic Growth - Geobulma).\n\n##### Solution :\n- The solution to a problem of geometric series is a geometric series that does not have any \"zeroes\" but sums up like the one used to find the answer.\n\n##### Formula :\n-  Geo-Bulmation, which is the solution to the Geo-Bulmic problem, can be expressed using geometric progressions.\n\n```\nGeobulma  =\n(", "answer": "B: high school"}

For example: int [] numbers = new int [3];\n>\n> B) Arrays should be assigned values at execution time in C. For example;  numbers [1] = 21;  numbers [2] = 22; numbers [3] = 23; C) Arrays should not be modified at execution time. We cannot change the values of a[1], a[2] or a[3]  after the array is initialized. \n>\n> D) The index of an array variable a should be less than or equal to its size. For example,  a[7] is undefined.  This behavior may change in future versions of C. In a class, an array can have more memory than allocated to the variable.  The C standard requires that the compiler be able to allocate the appropriate extra array memory if the size is exceeded. If the index is greater than or equal to the array size, the C standard guarantees that the program will not crash.  \n>\n> E) When an array variable is initialized, it is initialized to all null values zero (0) and the other elements initialized to the given value.  For example: int numbers [3] = new int [4]() { {0}, {1}, {2}, {3} };  \n> \n> F) When an array variable containing an array is declared, it is not necessary to initialize it. In other words, an array containing another array variable initialized to all null values can be used. For example; int [] arrayValues [4] = new int [3]() { {0}}; \n>\n> G) Array variables can be declared with values, which is an object-oriented programming feature. These are called constant arrays or C arrays. For example: new_student_id [MAX_STUDENTS] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};  \n\n###Instructions: Find the Sum of the following\n\nInput: \t88,", "answer": "C: superior"}

Now add this  number that you obtain  to the second  half of the given number.   The total you get is the answer.  Examples  21 : 2 and 3 : \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- 724.  The total should be 728!  60 : 1 and 66 : 3 714.  The first half of 60 is 60. The total = 60 +  66 = 126.  Then this 126 is to be added to the second half of  60 = 76.  The total = 76 + 126 = 202.   The answer is 202. In which case the number of ones is 6984. Now  the first half is 698 and the  second half is 4.  The answer = 118538.

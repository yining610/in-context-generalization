To make myself feel better, I painted my nails black, and cut my dark hair into an attractive crop. My favorite color is white, and I've always found white sunglasses stylish as well, but when I got them they were the wrong shade, so after the first wearing I took them to the beach. When the water was up to my ankles, I realized the only way I would get them back to where I liked them would be by swimming out to the other side and back in. When I got them wet, I found the way they slipped down to the tip of my nose, and I saw them were the same light greenish color as the surf as it rolled back to my calf, and I realized I had never seen my nails in anything not white. I didn't run back to retrieve them, as they were not even wet. I just sat there looking at them, and realized they were going to need to change color to make me happy. By the time I got home, they had left a very wet ring around my eye ; after I took off my coat, I noticed the ring around my neck, but it faded over the next few days. I decided to ask my friends to bring over their shades, as the ones I owned were wrong for me. I have come across sunglasses I loved, but they were too heavy/light for my face. After painting them a new color, and trying them on a lot, most of them didn't work out, and I put them in my drawers to maybe go to the beach with me some day, but I was never able to find them. I have a pair of my own shades, and for two days they felt as comfortable as if they belonged to me. Last summer on a trip to my grandparents, I bought a set of glasses as a gift. I don't really like wearing sunglasses, but those were a different story.

It was realized later that one of the 30 numbers was 145, a wrongly copied value of 135.<n>Since this happened for only one value, the 30 value mean of 140 was considered correct.<n>In the second question of area of a cube, the volume of a smallest sphere that can be insrcribed in a rectangular box is correct on calculating the lowest dimension of the box.<n><n>In the next question, we need to find the reciprocal. It equals to 68 which is the square root of 9 / 37.<n><n>In the fourth question, the sum of the rest is found by adding all the numbers of 9 from 1 to 110.<n>The 9th digit of the total is 399 or 109 in decimal notation.<n>```<n>    This was the answer. We used the fact that the sum is 7 (which is a multiple to both 4 and 11) and the sum has at least 49 digits, so it is too big to be divisible. We thus concluded that the sum is divisible by both 4 and 9.<n>```<n><n>In the sixth question, we have to find the fractional parts. The fraction we have here is 3 / 4 which equals to 9 / 8. Therefore we multiply the 3 by 9 / 8 and it gives 27, which is the required answer.<n><n>The seventh question is finding the reminder of 110 / 9. The answer is 12. We also add the remainder sum of 7 from 3 to 110, which is 5. Therefore the required remainder sum of the 1st 110 integers is 17.<n><n>The question number 8 states that the speed of A is 20 /15 of B and that A and B run in an equal race. We let A and B take 5/15 in addition and subtract it from their speeds. Therefore the speeds are equal.<n><n>In the ninth question, we used the fact that when the sum of the divisible values is known, the mean of the rest can be calculated and found that the mean of the rest of the numbers

But does the speed of sound always increase? In general, yes. But in particular circumstances, no.<n>The speed of sound (and also light) in a gas drops whenever it travels through a less dense area. This happens when sound waves (or indeed, light) moves from a place with a high density.<n>We may wonder why the speed of sound in a gas also drops when it moves from a place with low density and it is because of the "rarefaction". Since the air is denser near the surface of the Earth, the sound waves travel with a higher speed as they go from a place with higher air density to lower air density. And this happens at the same time when the sound waves travel from a place with higher temperature to cooler temperatures.<n>In a rarefaction, the gas in the place of lower density becomes compressed, and the atoms in the gas are closer to each other. If you do not compress the atmosphere, you can imagine that there would be space between the atoms. When the molecules are closer to each other, it becomes easier for the air to be compressed, which causes the speed of sound to drop and when one measures their distance, they appear to move away from each other.<n>Input: 1. If a man rides 70 percent of the way to work at a comfortable speed of 18 miles per hour and then rides the rest of the way to work 20 percent of the speed of light, what's his speed?  2.  If the mass of our car doubles, does its speed double?  50%   3. If we make 20 percent of our car black, does it get heavier?  25%  4.  If a boy's age is doubled in every 60 years, how old will he be when he's seven times older than when he was born?  100%  5. If the mass of a rock doubles, does its volume double?  25%   6. If the force of gravity increases,

The question consists of a graph and three options among which,one should be selected.Therefore the one which has an ‘L’ curve (i.e. 10*X^2* X-2*Y and Y=2X^2+X+1).<n>### Solution:The options are:<n>1.5X^4 X-2X^2 <n>2. 4X^3*X-1+X^2 7<n>3. 2X^2+2X 2X^2-2X+1 <n><n>The one which fits the given graph(X=5,R=1 and D=0) and the graph is a square(that is X,Y>3) is the desired graph (i.e. Option 3).<n>So the answer is 3.<n>### Explaniation:This question is also from the Math-Indepth exam(TMX

By default it runs once for each element in a list.<n><n>For loop is an iterative statement in which a loop is executed repeatedly with each iteration specified by a defined counter. The counter is initialized to an initial value and then incremented by a set amount as required to control the looping. It is a multi-statement loop as like while loop. But unlike while loop, it has a for keyword, it is used to declare the number of times the loop will execute which will be specified by the specified iterating counter. The iterating counter must always be a variable of integer type.<n><n>For Loop:<n>```<n>for item in list:<n>    # code to perform on each item<n>```<n>As like while loop, there are many loop control statements like break, continue and pass are also supported by the for loop statement. These statements are optional and can also be used in the for loop.<n><n>This type of loop executes a single statement for each iterating loop counter. Hence, the name single-statement loop.<n><n>Example:<n><n>```<n>item = 0<n><n>for i in range(10):<n><n>  if i % 7 = 0:<n>    item = i<n>```<n>   <n>```<n>print item<n>``` <n><n>### Question<n><n>Define while loop and explain the working with an example.<n>##<n><n>A while loop is normally used for making decisions and while executing while loop, while loop keep checking the condition specified and it keep running while condition is true.<n><n><n>```<n>while condition:<n>    #code<n>```<n><n><n>```<n>num =0<n><n>while num < 10:<n> num = num + 4<n>```<n><n>```<n><n>``` <n><n>As like for loop, there are many looping control statements like break,continue are also supported in while loop.<n><n><n>## Instruction : Answer the following long answer question.<n><n>Python supports the method-chaining concept of composition and use of lambda functions to represent anonymous functions.

It uses three loop statements (while and do while).<n><n>In the while statements, it checks if the value is greater or equal to 0 and when it is, it prints out the value; then it gives the value, subtracts 1 (as a loop condition since the value should be less than or equal to zero so it should not be subtracted when it the value is less than 0), then adds 1, then checks again if the value is greater of equal to 0. The value is returned in the statement return x; This is a return statement. When a return statement is called in a function, it stops the execution of the functions

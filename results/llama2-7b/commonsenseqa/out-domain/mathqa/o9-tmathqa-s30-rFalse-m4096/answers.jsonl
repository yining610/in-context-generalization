To make myself feel better, I painted my nails black, and cut my dark hair into an attractive crop. My favorite color is white, and I've always found white sunglasses stylish as well, but when I got them they were the wrong shade, so after the first wearing I took them to the beach. When the water was up to my ankles, I realized the only way I would get them back to where I liked them would be by swimming out to the other side and back in. When I got them wet, I found the way they slipped down to the tip of my nose, and I saw them were the same light greenish color as the surf as it rolled back to my calf, and I realized I had never seen my nails in anything not white. I didn't run back to retrieve them, as they were not even wet. I just sat there looking at them, and realized they were going to need to change color to make me happy. By the time I got home, they had left a very wet ring around my eye ; after I took off my coat, I noticed the ring around my neck, but it faded over the next few days. I decided to ask my friends to bring over their shades, as the ones I owned were wrong for me. I have come across sunglasses I loved, but they were too heavy/light for my face. After painting them a new color, and trying them on a lot, most of them didn't work out, and I put them in my drawers to maybe go to the beach with me some day, but I was never able to find them. I have a pair of my own shades, and for two days they felt as comfortable as if they belonged to me. Last summer on a trip to my grandparents, I bought a set of glasses as a gift. I don't really like wearing sunglasses, but those were a different story. On the ride home, it became clear that the sunglasses did not look right on any of my friends, and that was very disappointing to me.

{"idx": 167, "text": "B\n\n#### Conclusion:The mean of 30 numbers was supposed to be 140. It was realized later that one of the 30 numbers was 145, a wrongly copied value of 135.\nSince this happened for only one value, the 30 value mean of 140 was considered correct.\nIn the second question of area of a cube, the volume of a smallest sphere that can be insrcribed in a rectangular box is correct on calculating the lowest dimension of the box.\n\nIn the next question, we need to find the reciprocal. It equals to 68 which is the square root of 9 / 37.\n\nIn the fourth question, the sum of the rest is found by adding all the numbers of 9 from 1 to 110.\nThe 9th digit of the total is 399 or 109 in decimal notation.\n```\n    This was the answer. We used the fact that the sum is 7 (which is a multiple to both 4 and 11) and the sum has at least 49 digits, so it is too big to be divisible. We thus concluded that the sum is divisible by both 4 and 9.\n```\n\nIn the sixth question, we have to find the fractional parts. The fraction we have here is 3 / 4 which equals to 9 / 8. Therefore we multiply the 3 by 9 / 8 and it gives 27, which is the required answer.\n\nThe seventh question is finding the reminder of 110 / 9. The answer is 12. We also add the remainder sum of 7 from 3 to 110, which is 5. Therefore the required remainder sum of the 1st 110 integers is 17.\n\nThe question number 8 states that the speed of A is 20 /15 of B and that A and B run in an equal race. We let A and B take 5/15 in addition and subtract it from their speeds. Therefore the speeds are equal.\n\nIn the ninth question, we used the fact that when the sum of the divisible values is known, the mean of the rest can be calculated and found that the mean of the rest of the numbers", "answer": "E: expensive"}

But does the speed of sound always increase? In general, yes. But in particular circumstances, no.\nThe speed of sound (and also light) in a gas drops whenever it travels through a less dense area. This happens when sound waves (or indeed, light) moves from a place with a high density.\nWe may wonder why the speed of sound in a gas also drops when it moves from a place with low density and it is because of the \"rarefaction\". Since the air is denser near the surface of the Earth, the sound waves travel with a higher speed as they go from a place with higher air density to lower air density. And this happens at the same time when the sound waves travel from a place with higher temperature to cooler temperatures.\nIn a rarefaction, the gas in the place of lower density becomes compressed, and the atoms in the gas are closer to each other. If you do not compress the atmosphere, you can imagine that there would be space between the atoms. When the molecules are closer to each other, it becomes easier for the air to be compressed, which causes the speed of sound to drop and when one measures their distance, they appear to move away from each other.\nInput: 1.

It's also a good idea to add some code hints on the questions where you have doubts (it's also a best practice to document your code and explain your every piece of code, it will come in handy for any future reference). You can also refer to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/JupyterBeyond101/coding-institutions-for-interview/tree/10113cbd9660ec9ff33d7e8d2a4e0eb286059bc4) to see the `Coding.ipynb` file.\n\n- You can get more help from the `Questions and exercises` tab in the exercise file, the `Exercise file explorer` on the top and the `Reading and discussion` tab on the bottom.\n\n- Before starting the exercises, you can check your knowledge with the [Knowledge checker](https://github.codinginstitutions.com/coding-institu-tions-for-intervi-ew/tree/main/js/questions/coding.js) app.\n\n- If you already know a solution and you want to get some hints, you are encouraged to use it. But if you didn't found any solution, just try to work on it by yourself.", "answer": "C: count"}

The question consists of a graph and three options among which,one should be selected.Therefore the one which has an \u2018L\u2019 curve (i.e. 10*X^2* X-2*Y and Y=2X^2+X+1).\n### Solution:The options are:\n1.5X^4 X-2X^2 \n2. 4X^3*X-1+X^2 7\n3. 2X^2+2X 2X^2-2X+1 \n\nThe one which fits the given graph(X=5,R=1 and D=0) and the graph is a square(that is X,Y>3) is the desired graph (i.e. Option 3).\nSo the answer is 3.\n### Explaniation:This question is also from the Math-Indepth exam(TMX", "answer": "E: copulate"}

{"idx": 936, "text": "2: C\n\n## Instruction: Answer the following short answer question.\n\nIn python, to loop through all of the objects in list L, there are two methods available : for and while loop.\n\n### Question:\n\nDefine for loop and explain the working of for loop with an example.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nA for loop is normally used for repetitive statements. By default it runs once for each element in a list.\n\nFor loop is an iterative statement in which a loop is executed repeatedly with each iteration specified by a defined counter. The counter is initialized to an initial value and then incremented by a set amount as required to control the looping. It is a multi-statement loop as like while loop. But unlike while loop, it has a for keyword, it is used to declare the number of times the loop will execute which will be specified by the specified iterating counter. The iterating counter must always be a variable of integer type.\n\nFor Loop:\n```\nfor item in list:\n    # code to perform on each item\n```\nAs like while loop, there are many loop control statements like break, continue and pass are also supported by the for loop statement. These statements are optional and can also be used in the for loop.\n\nThis type of loop executes a single statement for each iterating loop counter. Hence, the name single-statement loop.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nitem = 0\n\nfor i in range(10):\n\n  if i % 7 = 0:\n    item = i\n```\n   \n```\nprint item\n``` \n\n### Question\n\nDefine while loop and explain the working with an example.\n##\n\nA while loop is normally used for making decisions and while executing while loop, while loop keep checking the condition specified and it keep running while condition is true.\n\n\n```\nwhile condition:\n    #code\n```\n\n\n```\nnum =0\n\nwhile num < 10:\n num = num + 4\n```\n\n```\n\n``` \n\nAs like for loop, there are many looping control statements like break,continue are also supported in while loop.\n\n\n## Instruction : Answer the following long answer question.\n\nPython supports the method-chaining concept of composition and use of lambda functions to represent anonymous functions.

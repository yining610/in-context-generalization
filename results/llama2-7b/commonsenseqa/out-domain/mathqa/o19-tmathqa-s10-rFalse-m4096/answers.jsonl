{"idx": 664, "text": "None\n\n## Solution\n---\n### Explain The Answer\nInput:Input is a collection of five data points: a,b,c,d,e.  The first thing to do in this section is determine how many more than 1400 there are, and then subtract those.  Since c is 170, we can subtract that from a as well:  a-197*2 = -77.  We can subtract all of the numbers except the last since they are all less than a.  Therefore, subtract the last value from e:  -9.75.  Adding back in the original a,b,c and d values, and subtracting this value leaves us with a-197/3 - 9.75 = 2.9175\nAnswer:c\n\nInput:There are 2,001 possible answers to this question, but the only ones that will work in this given situation are going to be odd (unless you start with 0), and you can easily get an answer below 40,000.  Starting with 4, you can easily subtract 4 to find 365.  365+100 = 465 465-4 = 461 461/2 = 230.5  You need to get this number below 1000.  If you start with a number divisible by 2 or a prime number like seven you can find a small number for a.  47/0.281 = 169.55 169.08-0.08 = 0.169 0.168/2 = 0.84.  If you start at a prime number you can use a very small number (like 3) and subtract this number from the rest of the digits.  388/0.572 =7.49 7.49-1 = 6.49 6.49*2 = 13.00.  Now, take the last digit as 1.  We got 0.0 from subtracting 4 from 4, but we will get 0 again by adding 4 to 3 and subtracting this from 73.  83", "answer": "A: few people"}

So $12000$ out of $46000$ voters are voting by absentee ballot, or $1/4$ of the voters are absentee voters.\n\nWe can use the rule of thumb given at the beginning of $2000$ absentee ballot are being discarded, and $3/4$ absentee ballots are accepted, so $3/4$ of the absentee ballots represent $1/4$. Or we can use $1/4+\\left(1/4\\right)-1/4=1/8$ here. Or we can use the formula given in the solution given above, we can use $P+P\\left(1-P\\right)\\left(1-Q\\right)+Q\\left(1-Q-R\\right)=1-R$.\n\nWe need to find $Q$.\n\nFirstly, we can say $2Q=1-3/4$.\nSo $Q=1-3Q/4$. So $1/2000+3/4Q=1/4$.\nOr the original equation becomes :\n$1/2001+3/4Q+Q=1/4+\\left(\\dfrac{3}{4}\\times 1/2004\\right)$\n\nSo, use $0.9$ rule of thumb, $Q$ should be $3/32$.\n\nThe last step is to find $R$. Firstly, we will use $1/4$ rule of thumb, so $P+P\\times 0.7+0.3=1/8$, as $1-P-R=1/8$\nSo $P+0.13=1/8$ using our previous result:", "answer": "A: sit"}

It doesn't matter what it is called, but it is usually defined as a \"grand hall (A),\" \"conference room (B),\" \"business lounge (C),\" \"casino (D),\" or \"meeting place (E)\".\nAttendees will vary depending on the occasion and event, but there are some general guidelines to keep in mind. First, be sure that you do not have more attendees than there are reception rooms; if there are more attendees, not fewer, guests will need to stand at receptions. Second, if there are people attending the event and the reception room is small, guests will not have enough room to spread out their belongings.\nThe number of invitees to a reception should be chosen so that guests can comfortably attend the reception, with more people than there are rooms.\nIf a reception has ten or fewer guests, a simple living room may suffice. This assumes that no one will be using all the different kinds of seats (dining chairs, couches, etc.) while everyone is sitting down at once because seating availability is not affected by the number of people that come into the room. If you are planning a dinner party for more than ten people, it may be useful to look into investing in a dining set like this one, which can accommodate up to 22 people. The tablecloth may also need to be replaced because the tablecloth will get dirty or ripped over the years. If the reception has more than ten guests, consider using a reception hall, casino, restaurant, or convention center as a venue.\nThe best type of seating for a reception depends on you and your guests. Consider all the different types of seating, including arm chairs and tables that can be stacked.\nThe number of guests who attended receptions on", "answer": "B: large room"}

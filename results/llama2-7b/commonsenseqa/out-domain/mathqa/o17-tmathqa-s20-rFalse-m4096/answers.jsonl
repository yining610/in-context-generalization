{"idx": 76, "text": "B\n\n### Solution:C\n\nFirst, we need to find the ratio of two numbers. If we know the relation between different numbers and we can find difference of any of those number then we can easily find the difference between two numbers.\n\nSo, in the given problem we can get that both numbers are in ratio of 3 : 4 i.e. if number 3 is increased by 1, we can get 4th. Hence, we can get that 4=3+1.\n\nFrom this, we can get that difference in both numbers is 1.\n\nThen, we can get that each number is double of other number (bearing in mind that each value between 2 numbers is taken and difference in each value results in 1 value).\n\nFrom this, if each value is double then, sum of both numbers is half of original value. And, value of each numbers is 2/3 times of one another. And, if we multiply original value with 2 and 3/4 of one another then, we can get the same result.\n\nHence, we can get the sum of numbers is half of original and the difference between numbers is 1. From this, we can get the value of 2, 3, 4 as  2/3  =  4/5. \n\nThen, we get the required answer as 2/3 times 4/5 = 63/50.\n\n\n### Instruction:Answer the question on the next page.\n\nInput:what is the percentage of sales price of jeans? a ) 87.5 percent, b ) 100 percent, c ) 125 percent, d ) 150 percent, e ) 200 percent\nOutput:d\n\n### Solution A:\nIf sales price of jeans is 80 and %age of sales price of jeens is 87.5 then sum of sales price of jean with %age sales price of jean is=8087.5=64\n\n### Solution B:\nif sales price of jeans = 50 then %age of sales price should be 66.6%.\n\n\n### Answer\na) d\nb) a\nc) a\nd) a\ne) a", "answer": "D: connecticut"}

We will get x after Question 1.\n\nFor Question 1 input is a man cycling along road notices that every 18mins a bus over takes him and every 6 mins he meets an oncoming\nbus.\n\nFor Questions after question 1. x will be 18mins and 6 mins\n\nSo 1 / (x) = 6\n\nHence (x) = 12 / ( 6 )\n\nand = 18\n\nX = ( 6 / 12 ) X [(18) / (6)] = 24 / 3\n\nX = 24 /3\n\nFor Questions After 1\n\nFor Question 2\n\nFor Question 3\n\nFor Question 4\n\nAfter Question 4 we will do Question 5\n\nFor Question 5\n\nInput is a athlete runs 250 meters race in 24 secs If every second athlete wins and 200 meters race takes 25secs then it will be win\nand win game.\n\nInput is two numbers are in ratio 3:4 so total = 854 and in ratio 3:7 so total = 1067\n\nFor Question 8\n\nFor Question 9\n\nFor Question 7 (Instructions were not clear, hence answered as)\n\nWe will take two options from this to proceed,\n\nA: we can subtract a fixed number so total number will be a multiple of x,\nSo total = 18 * i +1\n\nThus no. of groups will be 18 -1 = 17.\n\nB: we can take the same no to multiple of x, say 5x\n\nThus no of groups will be 3 *3 which can be taken as 5 by multiplying.\n\nOutput: B\n\nFor Question", "answer": "C: red barn"}

Instruction: Answer the following multiple choice question\n\nSolution:\n\na. a is the correct answer.\n\nExplaination:\n\nSuppose we can overtake at the rate of 18 / n, then at each interval we will meet 18/n \u2013 18 = -18 /n \u2013 18 buses.\n\nSo, the total time for 6 intervals is \u2013 (\u201318/n \u201318) \u00d7 6 which is 18 n / 6.\n\n\nb. b is the correct answer. \n\nExplaination :\n\nThe given time interval is 18 / n * 6 = 6 minutes\n\nc. e is the correct answer. It is required 10 minutes time interval between consecutive bus.\n\nExplaition:\n\nFirst, we will meet 10 buses in 5 minutes time. This means that we will meet 2 buses every minute. So, after 2 minutes we will meet 20 buses and after another 2 minutes we will have 40 buses between us. Then in another 2 minutes this number will reach 60 buses. This happens in every 2 minutes. Hence, the correct answer is e.\n\nd. d is the correct answer. The speed of the cyclist is 20 / 5 kilometers per hour.\n\nExplaention:\n\nb= x / 6, and  x = 20 / (5 seconds * 60 seconds) =500 meters per minute\n\ne.  d is the correct answer, the speed of the cyclist will be x / 36 = 10 / 6, i.e. 1.536 kilometers per hour. \n\nExpession:\n\n36 = seconds * 60\nExplaition: \n\na cyclist will run 200 meters in x seconds / 200/36, i.e., 10 seconds\n\nThe speed of the cyclist in seconds is x/10 = 1/4 seconds\n\n\n#### 2.

If we buy 2 buses -> Cost = 2*535 = 1070\nIf we buy 5 buses -> Cost = (5*535) / (2*2) = 107.\n\nProbability of choosing them = 60*59 = 3450 : 3765 = 1 / 112\n\nDifference in the local and face value of number 7 is 10 in whole numeral.

If car takes 6 seconds more than the cyclist to pass a given point, then how much more minutes will it take the car to pass two times the starting point from the cyclist i.e. 18 meters?\n\nSolution:\n\nCar will pass the two-time start point at the time when the cyclist will complete 8 cycles.\n\nCar will pass two times from the start point, in that time, the cyclist will move around the track 8 times,\n\nSo, two times the start point from the cyclist will be moved in how many cycles of the cyclist?\n\n$2 \\times 2 \\mbox{ ( start point) } = 4 \\mbox{ ( 8 cycles of cyclist )}$\n\nTotal distance moved in 4 cycles of the cyclist = $8 + 8 = 16 \\mbox{ meters}$\n\nThen total distance moved in 8 cycles of the cyclist is $16 + 16 = 32 \\mbox{ meters}$ in 8 cycle,\n\nSo number of complete cycles the cyclist makes in 8 seconds = 4\n\nTime of the car to pass 2 times from the start point will be in how many cycles of cyclist?\n\nCar will pass twice the start point and that will complete 4 cycles of the car,\n\nSo it will pass after 4 cycles of the 8 cycle of the cyclist, so 8 - 4 cycles = 4 more cycles \n\nNow, in 4 extra cycles\n\nso total will move of the car in $ 8 \\mbox", "answer": "E: business meeting"}

For those you cannot answer without calculator, try to write the formula from what you know, then calculate.\n\nIn questions 1 to 8, all the questions related to speed and time, we can easily apply formula of speed and time without calculator using the given formula. You need to identify if the questions are related to speed or time and then apply the formula. For example, if the questions are related in the first 10 minutes, if we assume that the question is related to the speed and not time, we can simply plug in the data, 18 minutes/6minutes=3, and we get the speed of man=x mph. Another thing to notice is that the sum is 48 and divide by 2 is 24, we can calculate the time.

[Python Solutions - Code Wranglers Competition 2020](https://codeseek.com/contests/434)\nThis is my first competitive coding platform for learning.There are some problems that i found while i was trying to solve them:\n\n1. The first problem required me to find the longest substring which has 2 distinct letters in the given string.The code used to solve this problem is:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n\n    def getLongestAbsence(self, A: List[str]) -> str:\n        current_length = 0\n        if len(A) == 0 :\n            return \"\"\n        for i in range(len(A) - 1, len(A) - 2, -1):\n            for j in range(i, len(A)):\n                if A[i]!= A[j] :\n                    if  current_length > i:\n                        current_length = i\n                        break\n    \n        return str(current_length) + \" \" + A[current_length]\n```\nNote: Since we are returning a list, we have to break the infinite loop by printing the current_length of that length.\n\n2. The second problem required me to find if the given array has a subsequence which has the same elements of the given subsequence.The code used to solved this problem is:\n\n```python\nclass  Solution:\n\n    # We will be using stack, and will insert all the elements in the given list in the stack and while popping up the elements from the stack,\n    # we will check if the remaining elements match or not.

Here we have input that every 18 min the bus passes and every 6 min the cyclist meets a bus. So we have\n(18*18)*t = n/2\nt = n/18 =n*18/6\nNow substituting, t =n*9/4. This is the time taken.\n```\n\n```\n### Output:\n(18 mins)\n```\n\n``` \n### Consider the third input,\n```\n\n$$ \\text { a }=\\frac {\\text { v }_{ \\text { a } }}{\\text { v }_{ {\\text{cyclist}}\\, } } \\approx 25 kms/ \\, \\, \\text {hr}\\,$ and \n\\text { b }=\\frac {\\text{v }_{\\text{b }}}{\\text{v } _{\\text{\\text{c } \\, } }}\\approx 30ks/ \\, \\, \\text{hr} $$.\n\n```\nSo the input says that every 30 min the bus passes and at 18 min cyclists meet a bus.

Since log 11.2 is not defined, it is equal to log(10^1) and so log11.6 is equal to 3. Taking 11.6^3 we should get: 11.6 x (11.6^2)= 11.6, we are asked for 11.6 raised to the highest power possible, so the answer is the last digit of 11.6 which is 0.

A variable which can be assigned a value at any time throughout the life of the object.\n\n- A property can be used to expose both data as well as logic (the way the data is processed) without using method implementation.\n- An object can have its state changed and updated by calling any of its properties.\n- All properties support automated getter and setter functions which can be automatically implemented by using property keyword.\n- If your property is readonly, then getter can be called multiple times, but only one setter.\n\n#### Events\nEvents are used in multi-threading applications. Events are used to notify another thread that an event has occurred. Any function or methods that want to be called when the event is raised can subscribe to the event.\n\n\n#### Classes\n\nClasses are the main building blocks of C #. A class is nothing but a blueprint for creating objects.\n\n- Classes are created by a keyword class.\n- Classes are used to define the properties, data fields, methods and other attributes of a class.\n- In C", "answer": "E: might dream"}

Because the way the question is written, there is no way to figure out what they mean by \"18 minutes\".\n\nSo I tried a bunch of equations (because what else would I do), and it comes out the \"time\" is supposed to be in minutes, meaning the buses are travelling at 54 km / h or so. The cyclist is travelling at a constant speed, and we can't compare the constant speed of cyclist", "answer": "C: car show"}

Is it a programming problem?  A debugging problem of some code that you have written?  If so, what is your code and what specific difficulty are you having in it?  If it is an understanding problem of a language or framework, then we will need you to provide some code.\n\nComment: You're looking at the problem statement, doing the calculations manually in your head & getting incorrect answers to some of them. The correct way to solve these questions is to write your own code to solve them & understand where you went wrong.\n\nComment: If you have access to a compiler/programming environment like python - you can actually write programs to do this stuff for you. In general, SO expects you to either ask a specific programming problem (where you explain what you did and ask for assistance where you got stuck) or ask about a conceptual aspect (whats a compiler exactly, etc) - not ask someone to write the code for you - otherwise you are just asking for a program written by someone else, not a person.\n\nComment: The only answer I can make is \"don't use python to solve these kind of problems, you wont learn a thing that way.\" For your benefit, though, I can provide some feedback that you've approached the problem of learning the wrong way. See, if you can take a short, one minute class on how to use a compiler like Pycharm, or how to even write a simple program to print Hello World, you'll become a much better learner of programming concepts.\n\nComment: Your answer is helpful so far now what do u suggest me to do is there any learning course available for this topic?\n\nComment: What do you mean, 'what do you suggest me to do?'

Also a bus goes in the same direction and goes double the usual speed for the man. So, the man meets the bus every 40 minutes(in the direction of his destination).\n\nNow, if we want to find the distance between two consecutive buses, the formula would be:\n\nd_between = 80 * (t_1 + t_2 ) / 2 = DistanceBetweenThem * (taken - by bus )\n\nWe know that the distance between their points is equal.\n\nd_for_bus = 2 * d = d_between/2\n\nd = 80 * t_1 / t_2\n\nSince, it is given that, both the bus and the man move at constant speed and that, when the man met the bus, the man traveled only half the distance covered by the bus, this means that, we can see that,\n\n80 * (taken_period / 2) / 2 = 80 * 45 / 2 = 3 * (45 * 2) = 3*90\n\nThe time interval takes him to take half the distance is about 90 minutes.", "answer": "B: health department"}

Kawamura describes the process of making a traditional Japanese umbrella:\n> The wood is shaped by hand from one single stick of hinoki [Japanese cypress] tree.\n> The bamboo ribs are wrapped with sturdy silk, each one joined without glue.\n> The grommets are made by hand from lacquered brass.\n> The silk is dyed with persimmons and the grommets are taced with gold.\n> The silks are sewn with lacquered bamboo needles.\n> Finally, the silk is lacquered to ensure its freshness.\nKawamura, as you will see, can also demonstrate the entire process.\n> The manufacturing process begins with a single pole of wood. First, the pole is shaved to the desired height, thinned, and made uniform. Then, the sides are trim-med and the handle whittled. All of these steps are done by hand. After the pole is finished, the bamboo slats are chosen, one by one, and dried. Then, the bamboos are bound into bundles and boiled in a barrel for about 10 days, until the slats are softened and pliable. The silk tasseled by the Kuroda Seiki Sei-jo, a family shop established in 1804, is dyed with persimmon juice. Then, the poles are held in a vice-like device, and the tassels are wrapped around them. The grommets, crafted and lacquered by the Ogiya shop, which has a tradition of more than a hundred years and is one of the last of its kind, are glued onto the silken tasseled bamboo. Then, the slats are put into the barrel along with new persimmon juice, which adds strength to the tasseled pole. The poles are removed from the barrel, and the silk is dipped. After this, the poles are boiled again, this time without the tassels, in order to remove any remaining persimmon juice and to soften and moisten the silk.

Therefore, the sum of age is going to be 12 years, thus A is 24.<n><n>This problem states how many games the team needs to win to go over 40 points.<n>Because the team has already won 5 games, it would take 26 more games with 14 points per game for a total of 344.<n><n>#### B is wrong because 4 + (4 * 1) is 6, which does not equate to the 15 + (

A good example of this is the first question, which required me to use the greedy approach in combination with a formula and my memory of how binary search works while not overlooking the fact that the solution space is large - a very easy question given a day or two. The only reason I got stuck in the second question is that in a 5 minute test you're not expected to write anything remotely close to a proof, even though I had the solution with me. The questions which I found more challenging than the first one were the fourth and fifth.<n><n>My solution process for this was to read through everything, and note down important variables/ constants. Once I got through the baseline questions, I went through the more confusing ones.<n><n>To start on the path towards finding solutions to questions which involve logical reasoning, I have found that it helps to start with the most clear cut solution, and then work your way onto the solution which might seem more difficult. That is, first figure out if you can write the entire question as a bunch of simple (ideally well-known) mathematical formulas. If that can be done, then the question is pretty much solved from there. If not, then you need to build a solution towards your goal a step at a time, either on the way to find a solution, or directly towards it. This way you're solving the issue with a step-by-step approach that leads you to the problem's end goal, and can prevent you from getting stuck with a solution space which is too big to be worked on in a 5 minute timeframe.<n><n>I'm not sure if this will fit into the word limit of the question. For that reason, and because everyone's solution process is different, I don't believe it's a good idea to say what exactly I thought was the cause of these issues.<n><n>The above are my notes on my experience, and are not a statement of fact. I hope these are helpful.

To solve it:<n><n>- add all the values in each possible combination (4 cases) of each subproblem;<n>- to each added value subtract the value of the absentee ballots thrown out (2/6 * 1200 * 4/5 = 800):<n><n>```<n>sum(a * b + c * d - 800) = 14000<n>```<n><n><n>The second question has only one solution and it requires to substract age difference between the younger player and the older player. It may be solved as follows:<n><n>- divide "younger player age difference from older player" by number of matches (20 matches * 5 = 100 matches) and the result should be >= 3;<n>- then divide the result (6) by 3 and subtract 5 (because the first player have 6 more points). The obtained result should be 2:<n><n>```<n>sum((a * 3 - (a - b)) - 5) = 20<n>```<n><n>The third question is similar to the second, and can be solved in a similar way.<n><n>For the fourth question, there are no special restrictions, the sum of the water should be less than or equal to 30 liters. 2 liters will not make more than 35 liters. So it should be subtracted.<n><n>For the fifth question you have to calculate the number of train cars from the formula:<n><n>```<n>a = 260 * 72<n>```<n>

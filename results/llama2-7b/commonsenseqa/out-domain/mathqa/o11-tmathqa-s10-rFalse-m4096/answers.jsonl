As I mentioned earlier we also had multiple programming classes, in these class I learned about how to code in C and Java programming, this classes were the best, because the professors were very smart and experienced, they solved everything we wanted to and if we got stuck they helped us through. The programming projects were also fun, they were very similar to what we had at school. Also I learned a lot of math, at my school we always had math classes all year round, but these classes were different, much more fun and I learned lot about Math I didn't know. I also learned a lot about time management, they gave us a lot of projects all at once, so we had to balance lots of things at once and this was also a great experience and definitely improved my time management skills.\n\n### What I need to work on: \nI need to work more on my data structure and algorithm, I really don't understand them very well so I need to improve in that field.

The United States in the 19th Century was divided into mainly two sections, the North and the South. Those who lived in the northern states were the \u2018free states\u2019, while those who lived in the southern states were the \u2018slave states\u2019. The tension between these states grew stronger over time mainly due to the beliefs of the people and the economic differences between the two states. \n\nThe free states wanted to end the slavery, as they believed that it was wrong to own other human beings as property or property slaves. On the other hand, those who lived in the south wanted to continue with the slave trade and therefore saw them as a property and a resource of labour. With the end of the Mexican-American war in the year 1848, the area of California became a free state and this added fuel to the fire in the South. Also, due to the abolitionists in the North who tried to make the rest of the country a free state, the Southerners felt that the North was trying to take over their states, which made the South fight to keep their states as slave states.\n\nThe election of Abraham Lincoln in 1861, further enraged the Southerners who then thought that that there was no way that the South would be able to work with the North for any length of time. The Southerners felt that with the help of others, they would be able to defeat the North.\n\nThey wanted the Confederate States of the States to be accepted by all the other free states as well as the slave states. But Lincoln felt strongly against slavery and wanted all the states to be free states, which made many of the Southerners hate him to such a great extent.\n\nOn January 19th, 1861 at Fort Sumter in Charleston, North Carolina, a Confederate battery under the command of General P.

We want to find out the minimum value of $g \\equiv \\frac{1}{3}(12-2G+g)$ and we know that $g \\ge 3 9.5 - G $. For example if $G=22$, then $g \\ge 17.5$ and therefore $G>17.5$ which is impossible because $G=0$ only in no goals or loss or draw games. Thus there has to be at least 1 goal. Since $g \\ge 0$, we have $ g-3 \\ge g-2$ or $ 4 \\ge 6 $. So the minimum value of $3/4G - 3 $ is $1$.

You want to find a path from the bottom left corner to the top right corner along all the 0s in that matrix. If any cell does not contain a 0, then you can't follow that cell. Write an algorithm that calculates this path. (Use an O(n) algorithm for the problem; it has to be an O(n) solution.)\n```matlab\nfunction path = solve([])\n\n    for i=1:size(A,2)\n        if (A(1,i)==0) && (A(end,i)==0 && A(end+1,i)==1 && A(end+2,i)==0  && A(end+3,i)==1)\n            path=[path A(1:end-1,i)];\n        end\n    end\n```\n\n#####\nYou are given an N by N matrix A with entries in either -1 or 1. A(i,j) = 1 means that the element in column i and row j is 1 or it is equal to 2^k for some positive integer k which you do not know. You are also given a positive integer k, and want to know a lower bound for k. You can ask the system to find the minimum of at most two elements in each row. (For inputs of dimension less than 2, an error will be returned.) Your algorithm should return lower_bound which is the minimum of the minimum of elements in each row. For example, if the dimensions are 3 by 3, the minimum of the minimum would be 11, which is the maximum of (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3).\n\n```matlab\n% Given\nn = 10;\nA = randi(-1:1, n,n);\nk = 10; % 10\nx = zeros(n,1) \n\nfor i = 1:n\n    for j = 1:n  \n        for jj = 1:k \n            x(i) = x + (A(i,j))^(2jj)^2^(2jj-1)\n        end", "answer": "C: deny"}

{"idx": 707, "text": "B\n\n#### Explanation: For the first question, we simply need to find out the maximum number of votes for B. If 6/5th of the absentee votes went for him, he received 1/6 absent votes - 3/5* 1/6 = 2/3 times the absentee votes for him. If there were 12K total votes cast in the election with him the get 2/3 of that 2/3 is 2/3 * 1200 * 1/10 = 19.5K. Therefore, 19.5*3 = 58.5, the correct answer of choice C.\n\n#### Explaniaiton:\nThere is an answer E; however, when we are given that the age is more than the total age and only one question allows this, it is much more likely that the answer will be C instead of E.\n\n#### Explantion:\nWhen we are given 200% we can only think of a reduction but actually both increase in the amount and decrease in the amount can be both 200% or more. So, in order to answer this question we must take the reciprocal of the percentage and get a negative answer. The answer that we derive is -1 when the original value was increased (increase by more than % means original value got reduced) and -2 when the original value was decreased (decrease by more than the % means the original value was increased).\n\n#### Explanianon:\n\nAnswer choice choice C should apply as this question specifically says that we must add water to the solution. And addition is 75% more than the required quantity. That is option C. And because 1728cc = 2L, we should select B.\n\n### Input:\n\nThe problem statement of the question asks for the total time taken to complete the task in total. If 4 parts are made up of 3 parts, the total time will be 120 seconds more than the time taken, therefore it should be choice C.\n\n### Output:\n\n### Input 1:\n\n### Output 1:\n\nThe question asks for the value of x in terms of y.

They are fun to work with, but when you move on to work with a language like C++ everything seems unfamiliar. You'll get so frustrated with the syntax and the amount of time it takes to type out even the smallest script that you'll either give up or move on. Both of those options are bad.  The trick, if there is one, is to make sure you are programming in a way that allows you to use what you learn now. Start coding in a low-level language so you can learn the important pieces of programming and get a grip on how programming works. If you're learning Python or Javascript that is most helpful.  Remember: your time is valuable. Learn as efficiently as possible so you can spend the rest of your time coding in your chosen language.\nOutput: E\n\nInput: 2 + 2 = 4  2 + 2 =4\nOutput: 4 + 2 = 6\n\nInput:29 + 20 =?  27 + 7 = 2\nOutput: 29 + 27 = 56\n\nInput:3 + 1 =?  3 + 1 = 4\nOutput: 3 + 3 = 6\nInput:21 + 3 =?  20 - 9 = \nOutput: 21 + 20 = 41\n\nInput:28 + 7 =?  54 - 9 = 5\nOutput: 28 + 28 = 60\n\nInput:13 / 3 =?  3 + - = \nOutput:3 + - = 6\n\n### Instruction:Answer the same question with two different methods / approaches.\n\nInput: Lets say A, B and C are 3 students sitting in a classroom.

When we go to the right by 1, we call it increase \nWhen we go to the left by 1, we refer to this change as decrease \nWhen we go left by 0.3, we use the term decrease 0.3\nNow there are 2 possibilities for when increasing by 0.5:\nIf we have 0.6, then we can say the change is to 1 or +1.0\nIf we have 1.4, then we can say it\u2019s to 1.5 or +0.1\nBoth the terms are acceptable\nNow if we go to the right, we have 2 alternatives:\nIf we have +0.1, then we can say its +1.0 or decrease -0.1\nIf we have +1.0, then we could say it\u2019s -0.1 or increase +1.0\nIt must be one or the other and the sign remains the same\nNow for the change which is 0.5, we have 3 alternatives (because -0.5 is also a valid change):\nIf we have 2.4, then the change is to 2.9 or -0.5\nIf we have 3.4, the change is to 3.9 or -0.5\nIf we have -2.4, then it\u2019s to 2.9, so it\u2019s an increase of.5\nNow for the answer, there is always only ONE alternative.

We have a class called ```MultipleChoice```, inside that class there is a method: ```display```. And we have an ```interface``` called ```Question``` which has only one method: ```answerInput()``. We can create an object from ```Question``` interface and then pass that to ```MultipleChoice``` to use. The ```answerInput``` method that belongs to ```Question``` interface asks for input from the user.\n\nSo the solution is as follows:\n``` java\npackage com.tutorialspoint;\n\nimport java.util.Random;\n\nclass Question {\n\n\tprivate int multipleChoice;\n\tprivate String question;\n\t\n\tpublic Question(int multipleChoice, String question) {\n\t\tthis.multipleChoice = multipleChoice;\n\t\tthis.question = question;\n\t}\n\t\n\tpublic boolean answerInput(int userInput) {\n\t\tif(userInput == this.multipleChoice)\n\t\t\treturn true;\n\t\t\n\t\tSystem.out.println(\"\\t\\t\\t\" + this.question + \" is not the correct answer.\\n\\n\");\n\t\treturn false;\n\t}\n\n}\n\nclass MultipleChoice {\n\t\n\tpublic static void main(String args[]) {\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\tQuestion[] multipleChoice = new Question[4];\n\t\tmultipleChoice = \n\t\t\t\tnew Question[] {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnew  Question(12, \" What percent of 80 is 11.2? \"),\n\t\t\t\t        new  Question(3, \" a merchant purchased a jackt for $60 and then determined the selling price that equaled the purchase price of the j aket plus a markup that was $0.20 of the selling price. during a sale, the merchant discounted th  e selling price by 12% and sold the jacket?\"),\n\t\t\t\t \tnew  Question(4, \" on a two dimensional coordinate plane, the line, which", "answer": "A: math book"}

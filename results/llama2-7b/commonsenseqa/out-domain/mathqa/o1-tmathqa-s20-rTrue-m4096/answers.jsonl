B means injury to spine etc.\n\n## Problem Set 09\nProblem-1\n#### Instruction:Let there be 300 people and you know that they are having average of 7 children per family. Also, you know that the population grows at a constant rate of 12% per year and the death rate is 2% of total population. If the population of people today is 250, what percent do the deaths have to be in order to maintain population?\n\nSolution:\nLet us assume that the total people now are P ( 250 ) and suppose, death rate of the people be D now. So, at that time the population was of DP / (1 - D). We know that the population grows @ 12% per annum so the population will be DP / (1+ 12%D ) + k. Where k is some constant k\n\nSuppose the population be P1 after D more k years, so the population after D more k years will be\n\nSo,\n\n\\begin{code}\n      P1 = D P ( 1+ 12D + k - 1) / (1+ 2D) = D P ( 3+ D) (1+k) (1+2D) / (1+2D+k)  = D P * 3 + D (1+k)\n\\end{code}\n\nSuppose P ( total people ) = x, D ( average, yearly) = x/3, k = 1 then we have P1 = 3x, and so percentage of deaths is 3x / ( 15x \u2013 D)\nSince D is 1, DP ( 1+k) = 15P \u2013 15, where 15 is chosen so that the P be greater than 1, otherwise we will get 0, in that case.\n\nSo the Percentage of deaths are 3 / (15-4) = 28.

If speed is decreased, time increases. Here 20km/h was the starting speed. If it was increased to 40km/hr from 20km/hour then time will decrease. This decreased time will offset the increase in speed. This is shown like: (15km+5km)/(60m/55)(16.76kg/hour), 11.3366693360393m/16.76= 645.99334545058m/2=322.996672515226m.

He does not want to keep the cow itself for meat or dairy, so he cannot use the butcher shop or the dairy farm answers.

This type of questions where you have to select two possible answers are called MENSA questions as they are so confusing that only a very smart person can answer it and this is similar to the MENSA exam. the answer here is me as i go to sleep every two hours and my mum wakes me in-between. the other option is mom as she'll surely go to sleep because sleep happens every two hours. but mom cannot go to sleep first because mom will wake me first then go to sleep. hence the final answer is me\n\n\nInput:One day on the way to school, Jenny found a box containing $35. When she returned the box to its owner the following week, there were $20 still inside. How much did John get?

Don't forget that if they're getting upset when you get your drink, then you should quit your habits. If they're not going to talk to you because they're getting into an argument, then don't get into a fight. Also, be aware that you might do things just because it feels good. And also, the key question is \"Is this fun?\" If someone's having fun with you, are you having fun? Then that's a good thing, but if not, it's okay to have a few drinks and have fun playing around with your friends. For some, fun can mean just anything. It can be any type of fun: from talking to another person (even if it might be in the dark) to watching other people have fun (or, like when someone's in your dreams with a different out of body experience). If it's an important thing to you and you do it, it is worth a lot. Also, think about what really makes you a 'fun guy' to hang out in the middle of nowhere or in the back of somebody's car? Is this the kind of fun you like to live with or do you prefer to live with people who don't give you any grief?

Choice A is the only choice that does not reference any of the items mentioned in the choices, so that is the only choice that can be eliminated. Choice D refers to movies, and we know that the choices aren't referring to a specific genre of movies; so Choice D can also be eliminated. Choices B and C both contain the phrase \"believe in god\", where as Choice E only contains the word god, so Choices B, C, and E can be eliminated. Next Choices A and B both reference what a person does after they die, so Choice B can be eliminated. We are left with Choice E alone.

We see that the choice for the first car is either left or right, and that their directions do not reference each other. Therefore, there is only one choice left. The question is asking about which car travels faster; but, because one of the cars is moving forward, we can eliminate Choice D because it references a direction. That leaves Choice B and Choice A.

The flease are known as parasite because they depend on their host. The male fleas do not bite or feed. The female fleas live only for 30 days. They just live on the host and spend their time laying eggs. There are 600-800 eggs per female flea, so they lay eggs all throughout their lives on their hosts. The blood meals take up 3-8% of the entire blood sucking cycle. After sucking blood, the fleas spend more their time laying eggs compared to feeding. Since the fleas do not get blood on a regular basis, they usually travel on the host to find food. The female lay around 10-15% of the eggs they suck on the host. Even after all this eggs they still survive for only about 10 months. After all the eggs are laid, the adult flea is able to survive for only about two weeks.\n\n1.False\n  \n2.True\n  \n3.False\n  \n4.True\n\n\n\n### Instruction:How many positive 3 digit numbers are divisible by both 2 and 3 that do not have the digit 3 in them?\n\nInput:951767\nOutput:23\n  \n### Instruction 1 : How many digits does 95176 have?\n  \n### # Instruction 2 : What is the largest number in 951776?", "answer": "E: jump"}

Which is the one sold for less money? a ) The cheapest sheep b ) The third cheapest sheep c ) The fourth cheapest sheep d ) All sheep are equally cheap, that is to say, they have the same price.\nOutput:  This question has several meanings but it is ambiguous which one is asked. To solve this problem, let's take a look at the possible meanings first. Suppose there are three sheep with different prices, they are A, B and C. A is cheaper, B is more expensive, C is equally expensive. If it is asked to find B, then this answer is A, B, C ; if it is asked to find the \"cheapest\" sheep, then this answer is B, which is obviously more expensive than the \"second cheapest sheep\", C. Therefore, if an \"individual\" sheep is cheap when comparing that with other individual sheep, then it is also cheaper when comparing with another \"individual sheep\". Accordingly, if the \"individual sheep\" is more expensive when comparing with other \"individual sheep\", it is also more expensive when comparing with another \" individual sheep\". Therefore, if the \"individually cheapest sheep\" is \"sold for $20 less than another\", it must be that another sheep sold for \" $25 more than the \"individually most expensive sheep\". That is to say, the most expensive sheep among the \"six sheep\" must be the one sold for \" $20 more than another\".

Therefore the answer choice c is incorrect.\n\nIn answer choice A the problem states that the man goes at a constant speed and the buses also go at a constant speed. If he is on the road and the buses are on the road then it is evident that there has to be some time gap between the appearances of the buses. This means that the difference is a multiple of the bus's speed.\n\nTherefore, for every 18 minutes to achieve 18 - 18 = 0, the difference must be 0. This means that every 18 - 6 = 12 minutes there must be a bus going from the starting point.\n\nSimilarly, in case of 6 - 6 = 0, the bus will appear again after 6 + 6 = 13 minutes.

{"idx": 701, "text": "This question has given many people pause to think. We have a simple solution to choose between A and C, but we'll give some background before that. First, there is a special term for those things which move but aren't moving: they are called \"fixed targets\". Fixed targets are typically used by drivers to gauge an object's distance. For example, a car's speedometer is a fixed target (well, it's not actually moving, but it is used to keep track of how fast a car is moving). As for this question, we have one of two things that are used in a car show, A: football stadium or C: car show. If we want to determine if A and C can be true simultaneously, then there are two choices. First, A is a car show and C is a football stadium. Now, if a person is sitting in an observation deck above the football stadium looking at the car show, then they would indeed be looking \"some things which move, but are not\". Second, A and C are football stadium and car show. If a person is sitting in one of the upper tiers of the car show watching the football game, they would appear to be staring \"some things which move\".\n\n### Instruction:Input a number or multiple choice.\n\ninput: 376, 1, 2, 4, 8\n\nOutput:we need to find firstly how many odd numbers we have. 4 odd numbers : 4,, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37 and 39 \n\n## # Instructions: Input a number or multiple choice\n\nInput: 1, 17, -4\n\nOutput:we can see here that answer contains numbers that are not separated by comma and space and one of the numbers is negative and it should be on the left of 9 first.\n\n##Input: 10,19\n\nOutput: 9 digits that are not separated by a comma or a space and the 9 digits should be in one series.\n\n### Input: 19,\n\n### Output: The", "answer": "C: car show"}
{"idx": 702, "text": "The only sensible choice is 'C'. If we look at the choices, it doesn't make sense to go to a state park for a celebration except perhaps if we are very poor and we can't afford to go to Disneyland or the Opera. If we do go to a state park it would be because we needed to celebrate something but couldn't afford to go elsewhere and couldn't go to the carnival because there is no riding at a State Park and we could go to the opera but there is no rides at the opera so the only choice is going to a carnival or a Disneyland or an amusement park. The carnival has rides. So the answer is C. Carnivals don't celebrate anything in particular unless it is the carnival itself (like Mardi Gras in Louisiana) but there are usually rides. Many amusement parks like Busch Gardens have rides (like Six Flags, Cedar Point, etc.) and many have an E-ticket ride that can be found in roller coasters and many other types of rides, like \"The Incredible Hulk\" ride at Universal Studios Orlando. So the correct answer for this choice is C.

This is why it is helpful to use an average \u2013 because it is able to smooth out the trends in the population so they are easier to identify. The average is, of course, just an estimate. So if you wanted to determine exactly how old a country is, then you would need to actually look at the age of each citizen and calculate their averages and then average these all together.

He also noticed that in every 14 minutes of this he finds a man doing cycling in the opposite direction.  If all trains and the cyclist are moving at a constant speed and the cyclist finds that he has covered 16 km.  So find in which minute he is traveling with the train and in which minute the other cyclist passes him.\n\nOutput:\nThe correct answer is the man finds the same person every time when the train overtakes him because the man cycling in opposite direction goes 1/3 of the distance of the train (not the other way around). The train travels in one quarter of the distance of the man and because he has travelled 16 km in 2 hours 15 minutes so he meets and overtakes the other man every 15 m*4 * 1/3 = 9 mins.\nSo the man cycles along the Road that overtakes the train every 15 m after 1 hr 15 mins and after 2hrs he is overtaken the last man (because of he only travels 1/9 of the distance of the second man).\n\nInput:  A man running on the road can run at 15 mi/hr, and every 4 mi there is a bus that comes from the opposite direction. \nHe runs for 8 miles after which he realizes that he has been running longer than the time he had anticipated. \nFind the distance covered by a bus. \n\nOutput: Correct answer is 1/15*15*4= 1 miles/hr\n\n\n\n'''\n\n\n# Time Complexity: O(m)\n# Space complexity: O(1)\ndef ans(L,n,ans,ans2,ans1):\n  if len(L) <= n:\n    print(ans[ans2] + ans[ans1])\n  else:\n    for i in range(n+1):\n      if i ==n and ans1 in ans2:\n        a=ans1 + ans1", "answer": "B: complete sentence"}

A: BAND B: SECTION C: CHOIR D: BAND LIBRARY\nOutput:I think that A=band has a band.\n\n### Solution\n\n### Instruction:Answer the question given below by selecting the most appropriate answer.\n\n> A 5-digit number P is the number of times a certain digit C appears in all 5-digit numbers formed by using the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Two 5-digit numbers P and  Q have the same number of times the digit C appears, then the number P is greater than the number  Q by exactly how many units? (Each unit is less than 100.)\n\n\n### Explanation:Let C be the digit which is repeated most of the time in 5-digit numbers.\n\nWe can divide cases in 3 based on the value of P and the value of Q.\n\n* C is 2 then P=100*75+75*25 = 625 and Q=100*62.5+62.5*10 = 625, so the answer is C=2 (it is the digit greater than 6) (the value of P > Q+1)\n* C is 3 then P=10*125+125*9 = 15625 and Q =10*129+129*6 = 13200, so the answer is P=15625 (the value of Q > P-1)\n\n* C is greater than 3 so P=125*57625+57625*99 = 1000000 and Q=125*65214+65214*50 = 1087658, so the answer is 1(I have to get rid of my units)\n\n### Instructions:A number is chosen at random from the set of odd integers between 1 and 100.

So the probability of event x is given by: \\ frac { number of favor for x } { total number of possible events } = P( event x ), where number of favor for event x is also known as its favor factor. So this question is asking what event x is? The event that is criticized the most. A is event 1, B is event 2 and so on. So event x should be home which is criticized more than others.

So we can say that the probability of event y is given by: \\ \\ frac { a } { b } = P(event y), where a is the favor factor associated with event y and b is the total of all its favor factors. So this question is asking us about the favor factor for an event and finally the answer to this is C.\n\nInput: When will the most people die in a given day according to death data over last 50 years? A: 2 in the morning B: 2 in the afternoon C: 4 at night D: midnight\nOutput: We have to find P(event y) where y = death in a day. We can say event y is not happening at any given minute.\nSo favor factor for this event will be 0. and since the total of favor factor is 0. We can say that event will happen at midnight.\nSo the answer is D, death will most likely to happen at midnight which is 00:00 to 00:59 am.\n\nInput: Which month will most likely have the most death? A: January B: February C: March D: November\nOutput: We can say event x = death in a given month. We are given P(event x ) = \\ frac { number for favor x } { total of favor x }. So this question is just asking us in favor x is. The correct answer then is November it has favor factor 8 and the total is 54. So total of favor factor is greater than 54 then favor factor can't be 54 itself therefore we can say total", "answer": "E: airport"}

Choices:  It just does. There is no answer. The light bends. There's no logic behind it.

It's a little harder to explain but let me tell you this... Sunrise happens when all the rays are coming from one direction for sunset \n    it's when most of the rays are coming towards us, (not parallel like sunrise), and they're falling on the earth, so in this case our eyes look red,\n\n        if they fell on a wall, so like this they'll become yellow, and if any rays fell straight, they became blue, (think about the sky).\n\n        and it's not always that. sometimes the sky will be red in the evening, or the morning or it could be yellow, or green or just... nothing...\n\n        You can watch the light changing the color, that's why my friend told me that at twilight, sometimes the sky looks purple.

The distance from point F to point B is 52. Let AB = x, BC = y, CD =\n\nz, DE= m, EF = n.What is the value of x + y + z?\n\nOutput: Let the distance between point A to point B be x, distance between point B and point C be y, distance between point C to point D be z.  Thus, x / y =2, z/ x = 5 . x + y + z = x + 2y + 5z = x + (4y + z). To solve this relation, multiply both sides by 52. Now, we put the values from the first and second equation and find the value.

Choices:  a. At least 70km.  b. About 18km.  c. About 13km.  d. Zero.\nOutput: How can we answer such a question? Perhaps no direction is relevant and we don't wish to leave our geographic location, but maybe there is some distance that a person wishes to travel in a particular direction. The only way we can compute the distance is if we have an initial location that we can find with a GPS. If that is the case, we can obtain the distance north from that location. The only way we know to do this is to first determine our coordinates and then to convert to units of latitude and longitude. We have data that tells us the coordinates are between 37.7100 and 37.7200 and the coordinates lie in the state of Utah. Using the coordinates, we can determine the distance north that we would travel. Since we began with coordinates in the northern hemisphere, we will have to travel north to arrive at our destination and thus the distance will be a positive number. A search performed in Google using the terms \"find distance north latitude and longitude\" gave us a good result, but a search of Google scholar gave us nothing, which we find interesting since the subject we are looking for is found widely throughout the web and is considered to be an important topic in our society. So, we will look for  a method that provides the distance between 0 and 90 (or so) in the northern hemispher (0 being south, 90 being north). Using our method (which does work) with the numbers provided for the coordinates we get a distance that is about 18.6km. If that makes any sense, use it. Otherwise, you get a distance that ranges between about 10km and 20km. The coordinates are for a point of a town, so perhaps that also provides some indication as to the possible error range.", "answer": "E: trunk"}

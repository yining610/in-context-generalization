The company is the largest corporation based in Arkansas, the largest private employer in the state and the largest individual contributor to candidates in the Arkansas state elections. It is the largest private sector employer in the United States, with more than 1.3 million employees, the world's 18th largest company, and the largest grocer in America.\nThe current executive branch includes the President, Vice President, Cabinet, White House staff, Executive Office of the President, aided by various independent agencies, offices and commissions. All the main elements of the current Executive Branch were created by the Constitution.\nThese include the White House, executive departments, and cabinet-level departments; the president, vice president, and their related offices; and thousands of agencies and other entities, both Federal and State. Though much of government was centralized in the Executive branch after the Civil War in the 1800s, that trend continued until recently with the creation of independent regulatory agencies in the United States.\nThe federal government is the oldest institution in the United States. It has evolved slowly. The President is the head of the executive branch, has general supervision of the government, and is head of state, commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces, and has power under the Constitution to sign bills into law.\nAn amendment to the Constitution ratified in 1913 effectively prohibited presidents from using money in their own account or for their own use, making the presidential budget subject to congressional appropriations, and making the President directly responsible for his own conduct before Congress.\nAs a result, the President is limited to a single term of six years and, while serving in office, is unable to actively participate in any financial transaction that would require him to \"place his own personal financial interests above the public interest\", a concept incorporated into the Hatch Act of 1939. The powers vested in the President by the Constitution are listed in the document, including those to nominate Cabinet officers, judges of the federal courts, the head of the United States military, and other officers; conduct foreign policy and make treaties; veto b", "answer": "E: government"}

Most buildings are being built with front entrance doors (and/or mailboxes) that are locked, and there is no delivery slot. The building can only be accessed through a common entrance (like a lobby), or through the building's own mail rooms or package rooms, from which mail is distributed.\nSo the final answer should be B: suitcase\n\nInput: a number has four distinct digits. every two consequtive digits are different. the greatest single number that divide the number exactly 5 times is a two digit number. find the number. a ) 24, b ) 28, c )40, d ) 25, e) 29\nOutput: Solution: Let N = 3 digits, then N = 10^2 + 10^2, which is divisible by 25 if a^2 + b^2 + ab = (13)^2. 2^2 + 8 = 13^2. 13 = (8)^2 ; then N = 3 digits. 8, 8, 1 + (2 digits).

Water at this temperature, can be easily evaporated at atmospheric pressure. The water at 105 degrees is used to cook noodles. Noodles absorb water easily at 105 \u00c2\u00b0C and do not absorb water easily at room temperature. The water at \u00c2\u00b0C can be used for drink but is stored for daily use at room temperature. What problem does the water at 100 \u00c2\u00b0 C have in cooking the noodles?\"\nOutput: The water at 1\u00b0 degree C is used to cook no noodles. The reason that water at 1\u00c2\u00b0C does not cook noodles easily is that water at 1 \u00c2\u00b0 C can not be used at room temperature. So it needs to be stored at room temperature to be used daily for drinking. As the water at 1 \u00f0\u00c2\u00b0C can not be stored at room temperature it needs to be kept at 1 \u00f0C at all times\nSo the final answer the question of 5 is E\n\nInput:\"The gas used to cook vegetables in a cooking stove is stored in tanks in cylindrical shape.

The mean of 32 numbers will always equal a whole number, so if this wasn't meant to be a decimal-thousands-of-decimals kind of number, this means the 'correct mean' can only be 230. Therefore the correct answer is C.\n\nIn the second question, we are told the difference between the highest and lowest rectangles. If one had a bigger cube on it than the other, we had larger measurements in the same direction. The answer is that that means they are the same, so C.\n\nIn question 3, there are not a lot of values used. If we pick a decimal number, we could easily say 0.3, because a'remainder' of a number is a fraction. We could even use 12275/33, since this would be evenly divided into both fractions but it's clearly the one closer to 230. If we do have a remainder of 0 or 1, the numbers are pretty clearly 1, 2, and 3, since 4 - 2 = 2 and there's no 1, and likewise 5 - 3 = 2 with no 4 or 5.

However, E(a) > m and E(a^) > m^^. Thus, the correct answer to (b) is \"never.\"\n\nFor (e), we would first need to compute E(ma). However, we don't even need to do that. In fact, ma has a joint or common or shared density function (pdf) and so E(ma) is just the product of the two density functions. Since a has mean 1 and variance 1/2, the product will, too. So E(ma)=E(a)E(ma). The left side is easy to compute, and the right side can be obtained as the product of the densities:  0.1/0.5*0.25+0.1 = 0.1+0.1+0=2.5. This is greater than E(m), showing that ma has a greater density function than m and so E(ma^) > E(Ma).\n\nFor (f), we would have to compute the density function of ad, which is, of course, (ad)2/0", "answer": "C: throne room"}

Find the integers.\n\nOutput: \"The sum of 3 even consecutive integers is 40 more than twice the product of 2 of the integers. The smallest possible integer in the set of three is 10. So let the larger of the two be M. L and M form the two consecutive even integers. so M + 40 = 2 * ( L + 1 ) \u21d2 2 * ( M - 1 ) = L + 39 \u21d2 2 * M - 38 = L + 38 \u21d2 L = 3 * M \n\nHence, the sum of the remaining two even integers is 48. The sum of the three of them is 40. So, M + L = 40 \u21d2 ( 3 * M ) + 2 * M = 40 \n\nSo, M is 12. And other two can be L and 3 * 12 respectively.\n\nAnswer: The problem is asking for three even numbers such that the sum of the three equal 40 and the sum of the pair is 240 or a pair plus the sum is 240. Clearly the largest even number that can be divided by 2 to yield a remainder of zero is 20. Now 20 = 20 + 10 + 8 = 40. So the three numbers must be 20, 20, 8.\n\n### Instruction:Answer the math multiple choice question.\nSo if we keep on subtracting 40 from the sum we obtain the remainder 48.The other two integers from M which is the largest should now be 12 and 24.\nAnswer: L and M are 8 and 12\n\n### Instructions:Answer the math problem.\n\nA rectangle and a circle have the same area.

The problem was as follows: A sphere was cut into two parts, and one part was cut again into two pieces, so that the pieces are all spherical. The question is: how many spheres make up the whole sphere? It turned out that the answer is... 7.28... but we will not worry about the decimal point, and leave it at 7. Which shows the fact that 444 = 7 x 66? True or false  A: true B: false Explanation:\n\"Solving the above problem is the same kind of logic as proving that 3 x 44 = 144. Both the above problems are Pythagorean puzzles. For the first one is easy, you just have to count the number of pieces. However what about the second? You can \u2019 t directly count the pieces and compare it to the answer ( 444 =144 x 3 ). Here you have to remember the meaning of the word \"piece\".\nThe easiest way to look is to realize that on the whole sphere, the different pieces are located in different positions. So in the \"pieces\", \"piece\" and \"pieces\" are really describing different spherical \"chunks \"of the whole sphere. That is actually the \"7\".\"\nSo the final Answer is A\n\nInput: In the given graph you can note that the sum of the series A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6 is 5, but the sum of A7, A8, A9, A10, A11, A12 is 3.

Finally, as you may have also noted with your own eyes, the letter \u201cS\u201d is to the left of the letter \u201cP\u201d and that the gap between \u201cS\u201d and \u201cP\u201d is quite large.

{"idx": 839, "text": "answer a\nSo the final answer should be a\n\nAnswer:\n\"In mathematics we never understand; we only get used to.\"\n\n-John von Neumann\nThe above statement is so right that Mathematics is the ultimate tool of our intelligence.\nSo much so that in 20th century science the word \"mathematics\" was used more often than \"physics\" and \"chemistry\" taken together! Many great mathematicians have won Nobel awards and also many physicists have taken their researches to Mathematics from Physics.\n\n\n\n\"The most beautiful and profound things we can experience is the mystery. Knowledge leaves in us darkness.\"\n\n- Albert Einstein\n\nMystery is an inherent feature of Maths. We know the answer but what is the concept or reason behind that answer is a mystery to us! Many concepts in Maths have never been explained (at least explained in an acceptable form).\nFor example, we know that $\\sqrt{2} $ is a irrational number of the form p/q where p and q are two different numbers. Similarly we know other irrational numbers like 'pi', 'e' and even 'e^(pi i ) + 1' for those who know Complex numbers.\nIn a similar way there are many concepts in Maths that have no explanation - e.g. the concept of Infinity.\nWe know that there are Infinite Natural numbers (1, 2, 3, 4...). When all of them are written down using different types of digits (even from the first chapter of the book to the last chapter). When each of these digit runs out of the available 10 types of digits. The next digit used is the first non duplicate digit (those available are unique). If we don't get any digit then we add some zeros to the end so that the result is still a natural number. We don't know what would happen next.\nWe just know that there are Infinity Infinite Natural numbers.\n\nWe see that many things in nature like Infinity, Pi, e... and even certain laws of Physics are just a beautiful fact of Nature. No explanation is provided for those. In Mathematics also there are many things which are just known without any rational explanation or even without any proof.\n\n\n\n### Introduction:\nThis is an introduction to coding.

For example, if a person knows nothing about an area (it may be a topic in math, or a place that he has never seen before in his life) and he has never heard what is going on, that state is called ignorance. And the term ignorance has nothing to do with understanding.\n\nInput:What are the basic properties of a line? Choices:  Straight line B: Not Straight C: Not Curved D: Has sides E: Not A\nOutput:The right answer is A. Any line has one dimension - it has length but no width or thickness. A line connects two points or segments, and the term line can never be used for any shape that's wider or thicker than a point or a line. A line is a geometrical object.\n\nInput:The basic property of a circle is? Choices:  C: Straight, B: Not straight D: Circular E: Not a circle\nOutput:The correct answer is E (not a circle). A circle is a two-dimensional (2D) shape that always has the same size and the same boundary (boundary means \"line that joins the endpoints\"), and that has no corners or straight lines.\n\nInput:Fill in the blank: One of the basic angles is the _______angle.

Choices:  it is in the same direction B: no matter the direction C: two or more than two cones are formed D: It has no direction\nOutput:The right choice is A (have the same size in degree measure).

The median here is 6 but there are a total of 43 unique values so there are actually 188 medians. Since there are multiple possible medians for a sample of size 43 the mean is the best solution here.\n\nFor instruction #8, it's not clear if 1 is the left or if 6 is the bottom. Either way, the answer would need to be transposed to be correct. For this problem if \"the first cube\" refers to the big one then 1 is the first cube and that cube has six cubes.

If the user types \"s\", the program will continue through the rest of the words and if the user types the letter \"b\" or \"B\", the program will go back to the beginning and wait for the user to start typing again. If the user types one of the above characters when they are in the middle of typing a word, the program will then move to the next word to see if it is one of the special characters and if it is, the program will pause immediately. If it is not, the program will wait 1 second to make sure that the user did not make a mistake. If they did not make a mistake, the program will then go to the next word and will do the same thing. Otherwise, if after 600 seconds has passed the user has not given in, the program will then halt and exit out of RunBustler.\nSo when there is a problem or error with the word the program tells us that \"there is an error in one of the words entered\".", "answer": "D: exchange"}

They should be put at the room where they belong.\nSo the final answer E\n\n## Instruction:\nThis question is about two different types of numbers. What both these types of numbers have in common is that they are of the form of (a1, b1,...., ac); i.e., these types of numbers have real numbers as their coefficients. The first type of number has equal coefficients, that each coefficient is different. This is why the first type of number is known as positive integral. The second type of number is known positive rational because every coefficient is non-negative in this type of number. Every positive integer can be represented in two different ways; as positive rational number or as positive integer. If the representation of a number is done in the form 1 + (\u221a 3 ), then is known as fraction form; whereas if the representation is done in the form of x, then it is known as positive integer.\nThe fraction form is generally written as (a1 / b1, a2 / b2, \u2026, an / bn). The positive integers are also written in fractional form but with different type. This special type of positive integer representation is known as scientific notation. Every positive integer has a unique one in terms of number of digits and the sequence of these digits. A specific number can be represented in many different ways. Every number has 3 different representations such as positive integer, negative integer, and their fractional forms. Every positive integer can also be rearranged so that its digits are not consecutive. A number like 1234, which is in its ordinary form, will be rearranged so as to form 1324 and 3214 etc.\n\n\n<a name=\"a1\"/>\n\n\n# Instruction:Please answer the following question.\n\nInput 100\noutput 1\nthen\nInput 2 / 10\noutput the quotient is 2\nthen\nInput 3 / 11\noutput the quotient cannot be 3 as divisor is prime and dividend is not evenly divisible\n\n\n## Instruction (cont.):\nThe first type of number has different representation.

{"idx": 979, "text": "\"The answer is \" Watch Store \". When most street peddlers trying to hawk cheap stuff, it is not unusual to bring in a bargain in the form of jewelry they have taken up in pawn to sell, drug money or not. But to get a drug store that sells drugs cheap enough to use as drug money would require a lot of hard work. Unless of course, the drug store is run by an upstairs neighbor, and for a fair price, to use as drug money, I suspect one would have to be willing to buy their drugs. So even if they get the occasional extravagant purchase from a drug dealer, if you are willing to pay a fair price, you can buy your drugs in a drug store and use that as drug money. However, most street peddlers are going to give drugs away. However, there are other things you can buy cheap enough to trade as drugs, such as a watch store. They might not sell watches for the purpose of reselling, but they can still sell them cheap enough to trade as drug money. I do not think street peddlers would want too much money, and then have to go get more money from the bank, to pay off drugs at first. I suspect they would prefer to sell something that would be considered as a regular transaction, with cash and drugs being an agreement between the parties involved.

{"idx": 991, "text": "Correct response: The cheese\nExplanation: The fungus that causes botulism is called Clostridium botulinum, and it grows in soil or water that contains animal or plant matter. It is also found in spoiled meat and home-canned food. The food has to be contaminated first through contact with the environment and then with the bacteria. Some people may not eat things like canned foods or meat if they are worried about contamination, but this is only necessary if the food is not properly prepared or cooked.\nThe correct response is C. Choice A indicates that the botulism toxin can live on the eye, which is not true because the toxin is only released in the stomach, not the eye. Choice B is incorrect because this type of botulism has never been found in a biology laboratory. Choice D is incorrect because shower stalls and water pipes are not made of milk or dairy products, so this response is not accurate. Choice E is not the correct answer because bacteria and fungi usually like to grow on old cheese. Botulism is an exception, since its toxin is formed only after ingestion.\nSo the final answer choice is C\n\n### Input: a group of 36 students go hiking and decide to keep a record of whether they are carrying one or two hiking poles.

Each node can contain one of the following: Null, Key data, and a list. The root node is one if a node has no parent. The empty tree is the tree without any nodes.\n\n## Binary Search\n\nBinary search is a searching technique for finding a particular value in a sorted array that has a divide-and-conquer approach. Binary search first takes the target, divide the mid position, and recursively checks if value is there either at the left side or on the right side of the specified mid. Once the element is found, it returns the item index that corresponds to that particular value. Binary search uses the idea of dichotomy.\n\nBinary search can run in multiple passes, as long as the time complexity remains polynomial in the length of the array.\n\n### How to use Binary Search\n\nFirst, we identify the mid-range of the data. Next, we compare the array with the middle value to split the value in halves. Next, we repeat the comparisons until we get a match. If the matching value doesn't exist in the array, the search will return the mid-point, which is used in the next search pass as the starting point.\n\n### Applications of Binary Search\n\nBinary Search is used in various places today:\n\n- Sorting: Binary search is mostly used to sort the elements of an array. It is used to find the middle of an array.\n- Searching: Binary search is the most common searching method for searching an element in a sorted array.\n- Space and time efficiency: Because binary search is more efficient than linear searches, the more items are in the data set, the more efficient it becomes, and that makes it a perfect choice for any situation that requires sorting.\n- Data structures: Data structures use Binary search to improve their performance. Binary search is used when searching for data in a binary heap\n\n## Hashing: what are hashing functions?\n\nThe Hash function is a technique", "answer": "D: moving"}

It's great if we can explain it clearly and make it easy for them to understand what they need to program.\n\n\nOutput: I'm not sure what you mean. Maybe you should ask me what the answer is. Sometimes I get confused too! (or something of the sort)\n\n\nInstructions:Answer the following questions on how you interpret the program prompts.\n\nProgramming is about solving problems, and when you've been assigned a programming problem you need to be clear about its scope.\nIf the problem prompt asks you to find how much money you earn for every four hours you work at your job, it can only mean that you work for money, you also know how many hours you work in a day, you know how much of money you earn and now you need to find out how much money you earns for every four hours of work.\n\nIf however the problem prompt asks you if it would be a good idea for you to learn to program, then this is a different question altogether. You may or may not know anything about software developers, or what these are and you probably don't know what the job title means.\n\nThis kind of question would be better if it had a clearer and more defined prompt, because I think there is a big difference between wanting to learn to program, versus wanting to solve problems that require software programming.", "answer": "E: menu"}

If you notice, the only input that makes sense is when it is asking about what 13.1 percent of 80 is. The way to tackle this would be to make sure the percentage is in whole number format, e.g. 12 and not 12.2.\n\nThe second input is slightly more tricky as it involves a concept of dexterity and how you know your music, but we can safely eliminate C with the knowledge that music tends to be a more abstract art than actual mathematics.\n\nWe then run into an interesting conundrum with the third input. If 0 : 1 actually means 0 : 1, or 1 : 0, or 1 :1, or in what order they would actually be set, we need to try the inputs accordingly. If A was the answer, obviously 0 : 1 is 0 but 1 : 1 is 1. If B was the answer, 0 : 1 will be equal to a 1 (and there goes our whole methodology) and 1 : 1 will become 1 and nothing becomes 0. It doesn't really make sense to do logic when inputs are confusing us and its very hard to tell if they actually work in reality like this, so I'd leave this input blank.\n\nFor the last input (as all the others just follow the same concept) we see the question is asking for what -4 -5 is. The only way -4 -5 can be expressed is as a decimal. It's also very unlikely for a question to specifically ask for a decimal when all others are whole numbers, but the fact that the code expects it to be a whole number is what threw me off.

{"idx": 636, "text": "A\n\n### Comment:\nExplanation:\nFirst, we will find out how 12 is as a percentage of 80. We need to convert each whole number to a decimal by dividing the number by 100 (12/100 and 80/100). In both cases, we get 12/10 and 80%\nNow, we can work out the answer (11.21).\nWe will make the answer out of 5, and the closest decimal to 12/12 is 11.27 (12/12 gives 1.0, which is not 5 decimals)\nSo, we should do 11.2 / 5, which gives 2.24, which will be rounded to the closest integer, so 2.\nWe will multiply it by 5, since we need 25. So now we have 5 x 2 = 10 again.\nWe will multiply that by 10 again, since we need 100. So, we have 10 x 10 = 100.\nWe have completed our decimal conversion procedure.\n\nSo, the answer will be 2.24 x 10 =11.21.\n\nThis is how we calculate: 12 / 10 * 5 = 11.2; we will divide 11 by 5 and we get 2.2; we will multiply everything by 100 and get 11.2\n\n\n\n### Solution:\n\nIn the first case, we need to find out how much 12% of an 80-number is. We will get 12 divided by 80. 12 % of 80 is actually 12 over 80 or 12/80. So 12 divided by ten will turn into 012/80 is actually (12*10)/80, which will turn into (12*5)/5\n\nOutput11.21\n\n\nIn the second case, we need to multiply out 5x2 so we can add 0.27 to the beginning. When we multiply 2 times we get 2x2, which is 4", "answer": "E: blisters"}

The approach that I used on this one question had some bugs on it. I had used only 5% of the total input but the output of 6.72% instead of the right one which is 5.06%\n### 3. This was the only question that was hard for me to get the right answer. I kept reading the question multiple time, and when I read it like 5 times I found the right answer.\n### 4. It helps to visualise the input, and output on paper. I think that I missed this stage.

A confidence interval is an interval that is most likely to contain the population ___________.\n\na) mean\n\nb) median\n\nc) standard deviation\n\nd) lower limit\n\ne) upper limit\n\nI am thinking c because the standard deviation is the largest number in the interval.\n\n# Instruction:\n```\nAnswer the next two questions in a similar manner.

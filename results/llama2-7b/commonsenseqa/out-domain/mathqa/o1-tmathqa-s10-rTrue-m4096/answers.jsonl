Wednesday = Thursday (and vice versa).\n\nThursday = Again Joe and, again Alice walk to school, again. Again Thursday = Alice, again Joe.

That is, Alice walked to school on \u201cTuesday\u201d and on Wednsday, too. Joe and Alice should have walked together at some point on Thursday because when you walk one day, you should have walked on the next day. I.e., I think Monday = Joe walked to school on Tueday, but Alice didn\u2019t since Alice walked to school on Wednesday, and Wednesday = Joe didn\u2019t walk to school, so Joe walked on Thursday, but Alice walked to school on Thursday as well.\n\nInput:There are two houses numbered 2 and 4.

When one look at the question and the given answer then the obvious answer is E) office block\n\nThe same trick was asked in my earlier post under my github link \n\n**Click Here** \n\n### Solution Methodology: The first trick on this question is to notice the wording of the question i.e  **surface of ** means in which **Earth** does not includes the sea, mountains or any other natural features.\n\nSo we have to find the next largest natural feature than Earth i.e. Mars(or the nearest Mars equivalent) which lies 10 times away from the earth.\nSo the next question is why we need 10 times if it is far enough??\n\nThe reason is that Mars is not the closest to the earth from the Sun, \nThough this may seem like a basic physics and many student might know the fact \nbut the main idea to solve such questions is:\n\n**You don\u2019t know the answer so always expect wrong answer if you guess based on your intuition or past knowledge, if you think the answer is 1, then the actual answer can be 2, if you think  the answer is 7 then it might be 8 so keep your mind open to all the possibilities.\n\n**Solution: We first see that the sun is 100 times away from the Earth, which means Mars lies exactly after taking out 10 times.\n\n**So the next question becomes what is exactly 10 times??\n\n**Our next question is how would we calculate 10 in the fastest way??\n\n**Ours answer lies in one more mathematical technique PEMDAS (Please Excuse My Dim, Analytical Skill )\n\n**PEMDAS is a mnemonic acronym which stands for the order in which operations within an expression must be evaluated or performed: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication (and Division), Addition (and Subtraction).\n\n**PEMDAPS is another mnemonic acron", "answer": "C: surface of earth"}

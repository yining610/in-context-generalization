Choices:  A: excitement B: fatigue C: anger D: hurting E: getting tired<n>Output:		A<n><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/w5CfA.gif" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><IMAGE></a><n><n>In this question, the bus is moving in a constant speed, so its speed is 18km/h.<n><n>To find 6min, we convert 18km/hr to 6m/s, then divide it by 6 to get 6m/s. Then add 6 to 6 m/s as 60 sec = 6min, so the speed of the bus will be 14m/s.<n><n>Now if a man cycling moves at a speed of 8m/s will take 18 / 8=2.25mins to go from 1st position to 3rd position.<n><n>If a bus moves at speed 14m/sec it will take 72 / 14=5mins to go to 6th position.<n><n>In general, if all buses and cyclsts move at the same speed, and if the man always moves at a speed of x, then 2 x / m = 2 m/ 2 x = m(x) + m, so the time required to move forward m = 18 / 2 so the required distance forward will be the man always moves 18km forward. Hence in terms of buses, it will take 18 - 72km = 54km.

For any bus to pass the cyclist, one bus must pass every 6 minutes and at least 19 buses should pass, there for there needs to be a 2 time interval that is a multiple of 6 and one interval that is equal to 6, there fore the total time interval between buses is either the time interval of the 2 buses that pass after the next bus that passes, or the number of buses minus 1 (not counting the first bus) times the time interval between buses.<n>```<n>The cyclist meets a bus that makes the time interval equal 6, and the other bus that makes the time 18 is the other.<n><n>18 + (time interval of 6 buses - 1) <n>18 + (6-1) * 6 = 5 + 1 <n>18 + 6+ 5 = 29<n>```<n>The time it takes 6 buses to pass is the time interval it takes the buses to pass.<n><n>We know that in total 19 buses passes so the time interval between the buses is 19, which can not be any of the options we have, and that leaves 1) and 2).<n>```<n>19 + 6 = 25 minutes<n>6 + 6 = 12 minutes<n>```<n>The time interval between 2 buses is 6, so we must have passed 6 buses and 3 more buses in one of the time intervals (there are 19 buses in total so 19 = 3(x) + 6, which x=3 and 6 = 6). Therefore<n>```<n>time interval between buses = 6 + 6 =12 minutes<n>``` <n><n>```

In one journey, each car travels more than 20 blocks in a different direction.<n><n>Ms. Brown asked : Does that help at all?<n><n>Answer : All the cars that travel at the same time start at the same place, so there is only one car that starts in the morning. The remaining cars cannot start in the morning. So the routes cannot begin or end in the same place. This means that more than 20 stops cannot be made in one direction. Finally, more than one car must travel together for it to travel more than 20 miles. Therefore, the car trips are as follows : A: red, starts at 9:31, goes 21 blocks right, then 21 blocks left until 3:01 (B) starts; B: blue, starts at 9 :32, goes 21 left, then 21 right until 10:29 (C) starts.<n><n>Comment: Could you explain step by step, because i dont undestand how you figure that out from the problem

Explanation:<n>It is already mentioned that it is already mentioned that if all buses and a man moves at a constant speed, so the average speed of each bus is 28min i.e.<n>Time it takes to pass him / Number of buses passed him in the first hour<n>Let n1 hours it takes to move by that bus, it will move in number of n1 i.e he will be passed by that many number of bus in n1 hours<n>n1 = 4<n><n>Suppose the distance from man to bus is d = dm<n>Average speed of bus can be found<n>Avg speed bus = d /t1<n>t1 = average velocity of bus<n>d = dm<n>Putting that value in the formula it is dm / n1<n>dpm = dm / n1 = dm / (4 )<n><n>To find Avg velocity of bus we need to add dm /n1 with first bus and then dm /n2 with second bus and so on.<n><n>Now to calculate the distance travelled by one bus we use the formula d = s t<n>st = s1 <n>s1 = Avg speed of all buses <n>s = distance travelled by the bus<n>t = time taken to travel one bus<n>So<n>st  = Avg speed bus + Avg velocity bus<n>= dm + 28 <n>Which is approx 28km<n>Then the answer is option b<n><n>2.

The robot always executes with the following procedure:<n>At the beginning, the robot assumes your position is in the middle of the door.<n>Whenever you move, the robot follows you; however, it will never move out of the door. When the robot passes by the door, it will try to open all of the doors simultaneously. If a door is opened, the robot stops, and the door is closed, and it resumes following you.<n>The only way to close a door is to stand in the middle of the closed door for one second and walk out. If you do this, the door will be closed.<n>The problem is, if the door is kept open more than once, the robot will never be convinced it shouldn't walk through the door when you walk through it. If you walk directly in front of a door, which is being guarded by the robot, the door will never be able to get closed to keep you from walking through it.<n>For the purpose of this problem, each of the doors is wide enough that you would be able to walk through once with space on each side of the door.<n>You never want to put yourself in a position where the doors to both sides of you are closed, as the robot will never believe you should open them, and even if you were to somehow survive the robot trying to push you through the now-closed doors, you'd be trapped and unable to escape if the doors closed upon you when the robot stopped trying to push you through.<n><n>Given the above description, what is the minimum number of steps needed to unlock the door and escape the room?<n><n>Input: A) If the following steps are made, can the door open and you escape the room? B) How many steps more are needed if the steps above fail?<n>Output: It would take a total of 13 steps if you're standing to the right of the door when you make these steps.<n>A) Step 1: Step right.<n>A) Step II: Step left.<n>A) Step III: Step left.<n><n>Input: It would take a minimum of 24 steps to get open then escape the room.<n>A) If you're in the door opening position, step left.<n>A) If either side or both sides are now open

But for the third question you need to remember that in each case the cyclist meets one or the other bus, not both of them.

What is the oldest heat source on Earth? Choices:  A: fire B: solar energy C: sun D: house E: coal or wood<n>Output:		C (Sun). I'll explain. Imagine water falling from a 400 m height (or more) and using this as a source of "free" energy to power an engine. A steam engine will be the easiest to use. There was a famous Russian scientist, Tesla, who developed a "perpetual motion" machine. He based his idea on the power produced by a falling stream of water. He failed to make a practical machine, as we still have no such machines and have no evidence of such machines working (except for a few in the realm of "theory"). To create a water mill is relatively easy to do. To create a steam engine that will produce energy is considerably more difficult. To create a steam turbine is even more difficult, but can be done with a lot of human help. In order for our device to produce enough energy to run a typical American household, I need to have thousands of gallons of water falling every second. The water must be about 140 degrees Fahrenheit (or higher) at the point where the water lands. You will want to have the water drop from a distance of several miles high, and this is possible... if the elevation is steeper... like the sides of a house. This would mean that the water would need to start at about 400 miles high. This is nearly impossible, but doable if you have a lot of money. A simple way to create thousands of gallons per second (using the laws of gravity) would be to have a lot of water, like a river, dropping very high. You have a river on the top and dams to slow down the flow in the top. As the water flows, the dam releases some water, enough to keep the dam filled up. The river water then flows toward the dam for some distance then the pressure causes a lot of the water to shoot out and in that water a lot comes shooting out. The faster the water falls, the higher the pressure. This is just an example, but the pressure of the water coming out of the dam is high enough to generate a lot of steam. Steam is then used to turn an engine and generate power to run a home. This system is called a geo-thermal system. You will notice that there is no mention of sunlight. One needs only to drop water from the top of a very tall building (400 miles) and let gravity do the rest

Choice C sounds like a great routine for somebody wanting to lose a lot of overall weight, but I’d prefer to put my attention toward improving muscle strength.

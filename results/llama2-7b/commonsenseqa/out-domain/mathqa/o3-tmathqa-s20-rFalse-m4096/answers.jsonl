For any bus to pass the cyclist, one bus must pass every 6 minutes and at least 19 buses should pass, there for there needs to be a 2 time interval that is a multiple of 6 and one interval that is equal to 6, there fore the total time interval between buses is either the time interval of the 2 buses that pass after the next bus that passes, or the number of buses minus 1 (not counting the first bus) times the time interval between buses.\n```\nThe cyclist meets a bus that makes the time interval equal 6, and the other bus that makes the time 18 is the other.\n\n18 + (time interval of 6 buses - 1) \n18 + (6-1) * 6 = 5 + 1 \n18 + 6+ 5 = 29\n```\nThe time it takes 6 buses to pass is the time interval it takes the buses to pass.\n\nWe know that in total 19 buses passes so the time interval between the buses is 19, which can not be any of the options we have, and that leaves 1) and 2).\n```\n19 + 6 = 25 minutes\n6 + 6 = 12 minutes\n```\nThe time interval between 2 buses is 6, so we must have passed 6 buses and 3 more buses in one of the time intervals (there are 19 buses in total so 19 = 3(x) + 6, which x=3 and 6 = 6).

They never stop for more than half an hour. 6. They always go in opposite directions. 7. They never stop more than 10 blocks from each other. 8. The route never begins or ends in the same place. 9.

Explanation:\nIt is already mentioned that it is already mentioned that if all buses and a man moves at a constant speed, so the average speed of each bus is 28min i.e.\nTime it takes to pass him / Number of buses passed him in the first hour\nLet n1 hours it takes to move by that bus, it will move in number of n1 i.e he will be passed by that many number of bus in n1 hours\nn1 = 4\n\nSuppose the distance from man to bus is d = dm\nAverage speed of bus can be found\nAvg speed bus = d /t1\nt1 = average velocity of bus\nd = dm\nPutting that value in the formula it is dm / n1\ndpm = dm / n1 = dm / (4 )\n\nTo find Avg velocity of bus we need to add dm /n1 with first bus and then dm /n2 with second bus and so on.\n\nNow to calculate the distance travelled by one bus we use the formula d = s t\nst = s1 \ns1 = Avg speed of all buses \ns = distance travelled by the bus\nt = time taken to travel one bus\nSo\nst  = Avg speed bus + Avg velocity bus\n= dm + 28 \nWhich is approx 28km\nThen the answer is option b\n\n2. Explanation: \nIf we consider that \nt1, t2 represents duration taken by bus 1 and 2 respectively \n(t1 + t2 ) / speed of bus 2 is the duration taken to achieve the average velocity\n\n(18 + 6 )/2 = 10\n\n(18/2 + 6)/2 = 9\n\nSolving\n9 = 9.8\n\nThe value is a\n\n3.

{"idx": 309, "text": "B\n\n\n## Instruction:\n```\nThere is a room with a locked door, and this room is guarded by a robot. The robot always executes with the following procedure:\nAt the beginning, the robot assumes your position is in the middle of the door.\nWhenever you move, the robot follows you; however, it will never move out of the door. When the robot passes by the door, it will try to open all of the doors simultaneously. If a door is opened, the robot stops, and the door is closed, and it resumes following you.\nThe only way to close a door is to stand in the middle of the closed door for one second and walk out. If you do this, the door will be closed.\nThe problem is, if the door is kept open more than once, the robot will never be convinced it shouldn't walk through the door when you walk through it. If you walk directly in front of a door, which is being guarded by the robot, the door will never be able to get closed to keep you from walking through it.\nFor the purpose of this problem, each of the doors is wide enough that you would be able to walk through once with space on each side of the door.\nYou never want to put yourself in a position where the doors to both sides of you are closed, as the robot will never believe you should open them, and even if you were to somehow survive the robot trying to push you through the now-closed doors, you'd be trapped and unable to escape if the doors closed upon you when the robot stopped trying to push you through.\n\nGiven the above description, what is the minimum number of steps needed to unlock the door and escape the room?\n\nInput: A) If the following steps are made, can the door open and you escape the room?

{"idx": 882, "text": "C (Sun). I'll explain. Imagine water falling from a 400 m height (or more) and using this as a source of \"free\" energy to power an engine. A steam engine will be the easiest to use. There was a famous Russian scientist, Tesla, who developed a \"perpetual motion\" machine. He based his idea on the power produced by a falling stream of water. He failed to make a practical machine, as we still have no such machines and have no evidence of such machines working (except for a few in the realm of \"theory\"). To create a water mill is relatively easy to do. To create a steam engine that will produce energy is considerably more difficult. To create a steam turbine is even more difficult, but can be done with a lot of human help. In order for our device to produce enough energy to run a typical American household, I need to have thousands of gallons of water falling every second. The water must be about 140 degrees Fahrenheit (or higher) at the point where the water lands. You will want to have the water drop from a distance of several miles high, and this is possible... if the elevation is steeper... like the sides of a house. This would mean that the water would need to start at about 400 miles high. This is nearly impossible, but doable if you have a lot of money. A simple way to create thousands of gallons per second (using the laws of gravity) would be to have a lot of water, like a river, dropping very high. You have a river on the top and dams to slow down the flow in the top. As the water flows, the dam releases some water, enough to keep the dam filled up. The river water then flows toward the dam for some distance then the pressure causes a lot of the water to shoot out and in that water a lot comes shooting out. The faster the water falls, the higher the pressure. This is just an example, but the pressure of the water coming out of the dam is high enough to generate a lot of steam. Steam is then used to turn an engine and generate power to run a home. This system is called a geo-thermal system. You will notice that there is no mention of sunlight. One needs only to drop water from the top of a very tall building (400 miles) and let gravity do the rest", "answer": "B: solar energy"}

However he was surprised when he saw their neighbour crossing his way. The neighbour was on his way to the village to take his wife to the doctor and as always he was carrying heavy load without any burden to carry across the river. It was a common sight in those days for a wife to accompany the husband to the doctor where they both had been asked to stand and witness their testimonials. In the mean time the boy\u2019s mother arrived and he quickly took his books, stood up and left, but the neighbour was still standing there. While walking away my mother observed that his mother and his wife were both having small cuts on their arms. She inquired about it and learned that the both had been bitten by a stray dog. When they were crossing to the opposite bank the dog bit them. The mother gave a signal to her son, but there was none.\n```\n\n```Question 1 : Why was the boy surprised that the brother was carrying heavy load without burden?\n```\n\n```a ) Because he was not aware of the law at the time\n```\n\n```b ) Because the", "answer": "E: utility room"}

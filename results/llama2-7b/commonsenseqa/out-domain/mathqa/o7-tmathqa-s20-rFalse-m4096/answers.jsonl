If there are more than one aliens then the one alien writes a simple algorithm as : best_scientists_list = [] # a simple array for storing the list best_individual = find_top_indivuduals(criterias) # a function that takes the criterias and returns the top n elements from all the criterias (in this case we want top 3 so that there will be a tie between 2 scientists if they have same no.) all_available_books = find_list_of_all_books() # a method that returns a list of all available books sorted in the order of number of books. Each scientist has different criterias. So, they take one criterias at a time and add all the candidates for that particular criteria to the list. And the function is called again for next criterias till each and every criterias is done. So, that gives us the top scientist for each and every criterias. We use a simple heuristics to decide the top candidates as the ones written the most number of books from that list. best_scientists = [[#scientist_one's_name, #total_published_books_by_him], # and so on] return best_scientists # this also returns a list of the top scientist for the list as a whole\nOutput:an alien from an other galaxy comes as well.

Every 6 minutes a bus passes by a man\n\nTherefore the output should be d.\n\n\n#### B:\n\n- An Athlete runs 20 km at speed 20 km/hr.\n\n- speed = distance/100hr = 20 km/100hr\n\n- Therefore, 20km / 100hr = k km/hr\n\n- 20*1.00 =30 km/hr\n\nTherefore the speed is b\n\n\n#### C:\n\n- $200 / 24 $ = 8\n\n- $63 / $ = $63 / (24 * 100 ) = 12$\n\n- Therefore, The numbers are 8 and 12\n\nTherefore the answer is a\n\n\n#### D:\n\n- The fewest number of computer is 8 because we can use 8 of them as a single unit.\n\nTherefore the Output should be E.", "answer": "B: big house"}

{"idx": 641, "text": "B\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe answer for first problem can be obtained through logic itself without diving into any maths. First of all we know after 6 buses the cycler will meet an oncoming bus. So in 18 minutes there will be 5 such opportunities, and in every 18 minutes he meets a oncoming bus, so 6 times 5 = 30 minutes = 30/60 = 0.5 hours. So every 0.5 hours, the bus will overtake him.\n\nConsider 18 minutes = 0.5/30 hours, we can get answer as 18/2 = 9 minutes.\n\nThe answer for second can be directly calculated (24 * 2/200) if you don't want to apply logic.\n\nThe third can be solved by applying logic. We see that the answer is A, because there are only two options where the number can be divided to make their ratios the numbers they are.\n\nThe fourth can be solved by applying brute force (try 5 cases and get the 2 cases where the answer will be d) - this isn't a good answer) or using combinations.\n\nSo the answer has to be a combination of brute force and mathmatical methods.\n\nNote: I have used brute force for the last question", "answer": "B: binder"}

{"idx": 966, "text": "D\n\n---\n\n## Solution:\n\n**Answer a to d:** we apply a method called [pigeonhole principle](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50460903). The time interval between buses is `18` minutes. Since the buses run at a constant speed, it is apparent that we would run into another bus every `k` intervals (for a value of `k`). This means that there must be some point in time wherein there is no other buses ahead of us. \n\n**Answer e:** We apply the same pigeonhole method. If we know the sum of two numbers, it would be easier to determine their difference. The difference would then tell us which two numbers we can eliminate.\n\n**Answer f:** a similar line of thinking to question e, we need to identify whether we have at least one pair of 2 products with the same source.\n\n**Answer g:** since the answer involves probability (since the answer is a fraction), it would be helpful to apply the [formulas of probability](https://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-Probability-Using-Fractions-%28Math%29).  \n\n**Answer h:** we will use induction. Inductively suppose that for all `n`, we can construct a cell and viola pair with wood from the same source. We have `80` instruments now, and it is trivial to construct `79` new pairs. Therefore the answer must be at least `1`. We only have to show that `1` pairs is possible, but it is easy because if we construct pair #3, our 5th pair would have wood coming from the same tree.", "answer": "E: trunk"}

If the \nline starts with \"Input\" \nfollowed with space \nthen we assume that this is a question and \nwe do not print the line.\n\nThe spaces between the questions need to be \nremoved otherwise the code will \nbe printed to console and won't \nwork like it is supposed to.\n\n#### Tips:\nIf the instruction is to enter string then use input() \nif the input is numbers then use int() \nif we are converting decimal to integer \nthen we have to place a. (dot) to convert it \nif its integers then int(int)(decimal). In the example below we convert 0.123 to 123 and print 123 to console  \n\n#!/Program:Python\n\n#Name: Mushfique Hossain\n#Year: 2021\n#Reg: 14935914\n#Section: B\n#Subject: CS & IT\n \n \n#Input:\nprint(\"This is input!\")\np = input(\"What time is it?\")\nprint(\"It is \" + p)\n \n#Output:\nprint(\"This time is : \" + 5 + \"55\")\nprint(\"10 + \", 5, \" = \", 15 )\na = 40\nb = 0 * a\nfor c in range(a[c]):\n    print(\"I will be printed many times!\")\n \n \n \n\n#### Instruction :Answer the following multiple choice  question.\nInput: The ratio of the two numbers is 3:5.

What is its height? Choices: A: 24 inches B: 13,470 pounds C: 25,817 pounds D: 12,390 pounds E: 124 feet.\nOutput:For this question, you will need a little bit of algebra. For starters, if you have an object with certain dimensions or weights and you find that it moves 2 feet away, this means that it has an increase of 2. The new height will be height+2. To find the increase of 2, you will need to divide your original height by 2. Your change in height will equal your new height-your old height=new height(height/2)-old height. In this case, your height is 12,540 pounds. To find what your new height will be, take the old dimension and divide by 2. 12,500/2= 6,250 pounds. To find how much weight you have gained, you will need to take how much weight you gained in height and subtract your original weight to figure out the weight gained. 6,254-12,250=6,250+12,254=18,500.\nSo the answer  is choice", "answer": "C: garden"}

Choices: A)By charging each person less than half the whole cost of the ticket B)By charging each passenger twice what a child cost C) By trebling the cost of the ticket D)By having children pay 1 for every 50 cents of an adult ticket (each child had 60 cents)\nOutput:Solution :\nThe number of people on train = 62, and they had ticket worth 45, so the cost of ticket for each passenger = Total Amount/ 62. The 3 children could buy a ticket for 2 rupees each.\nSo each person's share of the ticket price was 0.02*62 = 1.24.\n\nThe cost of a regular ticket is 45, the children were charged two rupees each, so each regular ticket would be charged 1.24*45 = 56.24.\nSo cost of each ticket in the group with three children was five times the normal ticket price.\n\nAnswer: Total cost = ticket price * 62 = 45*62 = 2760\nSo cost for each passenger = 276/62 = 4.48.\n3 children were 2/3 of the other passengers, so each paid 1.07 or 0.7*1.5.\n\nAnswer: Option B is correct.\n-----------------------\nSolution\n\nInput: Which of the following could be the best way of organizing all these objects?

{"idx": 113, "text": "\"Answer is c: B. Suicide. Suicide rates are actually higher in happier and more stable countries than in less happy countries. The reason is that, in general, very few people will choose to kill themselves unless they are desperate to do so. They often choose violent methods that are painful and traumatic, and the results are almost always gruesome. For a suicide to occur, that individual had to be extremely depressed, otherwise they wouldnt kill themselves, but instead, live in pain, fear, and despair.\nSuicide is generally not a good measure of sadness or depression, unless the person is a terminally ill patient. Those with terminal illnesses often kill themselves out of mercy for the people they hope to leave behind and it is considered very honorable. And then many people who are very depressed don't actually commit suicide. They will instead take all their feelings of hopelessness and helplessness and focus them on becoming a better person. They take their depression and make it make them better.\"\nSo the final answer will be c ( Suicide)\n\nInput:\"This math question involves interpreting a line graph.

The question is if this is a true statement in itself or false.\n\n## Solution:\nSolution: If the result was true, the proposition would be false, which is an absurdity because absurdity is defined as a proposition which is neither true nor false. But the result is false, so the theorem holds.\n\nIf the above theorem were false, then there would be a false proposition within the theorem and then the theorem would be false and then the theorem would describe this false proposition, which would also be true and both would be impossible. \n\nHere is the theorem: \n    If a statement is true, then it will probably be false.  \n    If that statement is false, then its result will not be true. \n    If both statements were true, then the result would be false because \n    an absurdity is defined to be any proposition that is neither true nor false\n\n## Original text:\nIt was given that: \n\nIf a statement is true, it will probably be false, \nIf it is false, it will surely be false. \nIf they were both true, the result would not be true.\n\nThe correct answer is that the above text is logically true.\n\n## Solution: \nWe can see if the theorem is true by testing it. But to do the test, it can't be known for certain whether either result is true or false. This is a contradiction and a false statement always holds. Thus the theorem is true. \nIf the result was true, then the false statement would logically hold. But the result of the false statement could not be true.

How far from New York does the plane fly an hour? In the early seventies, before airports became large complexes with many buildings, most airports were very simple. Their design was meant to focus attention on one primary goal - to move passengers through check-in, security, and customs as quickly as possible. Passengers who had business to tend to, after all, didn't care where the plane was located, so long as it could depart efficiently. Now, however, airports are complex communities, and the plane's location in the terminal doesn't matter. Even so, it is sometimes appropriate to know whether the airplane is near a doorway in a far corner of the terminal, or near a boarding lane. This exercise gives you the information you need to answer that question. Write a program that asks the user to enter the name of an airport, then returns the name of the terminal at that airport at which the plane is closest to a lane to board passengers for any flight out of it.\nAnswer:\n\nInput: Name of Airport\nOutput: Terminal Closest to Departing Gate Name of Airport\nOutput:-\nAirport Name: LAX\nOutput Terminal Closest to departing gate\n\nLAX A7\n\nLAX B7\n\n\nAnswer:\n\nApt:\n1.

He wants to use as many cans as possible in order to save money. If he wants to buy more of the same color, can he buy fewer of the other color and still have at most 18 cans?\n\"Example: Suppose the man buys one can of light green color and two cans of dark green color; the man will be able to buy one of the dark green for one light green. Since he spent three cans for only two; he can spend at most 6 cans for the dark green; hence he will buy 6 cans of dark green. So, now he has four cans to spend; he decides to spend some of the money he earned before to buy 2 cans. In short, he spent 4 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 10 cans.\nSince he saved 8 cans, he can buy one of the light green for one dark green; since he will spend 9 cans for the remaining dark green, he will buy 9/3 cans. In other words, he will buy four cans.\nFinally, we need to check that the man can still afford to buy 9/2 cans of dark green in the last situation. Thus it is enough for him to buy one can for light green. Since he saved 8 can, he can afford one can for light green; now the man has no cans to spend.\nThus he spent 3 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 9 cans for a total of 29 cans. We could also have done the same by considering the first case where the light green covers almost the whole apartment, leaving only two left cans.\n\nTo save money, the man will spend at most 18+18 = 36 cans, or 7 (or 2 x 3 cans) of the light green in the last two cases.\nThus", "answer": "C: san francisco"}

Choices:  I would go to the store.\nB: Would I go to the store?\nC: I would go to the grocery.\nD: I want the store to go to the store. E: Would I go to a store?\nOutput:The above question can be answered by looking at the sentence and answering the question, \"Do any of the verbs have more than one object?\" There should be no \"a\" because \"to the store\" is singular and has only one object. If the sentence were, \"I want to go to the store,\" then it would be correct because \"to the store.\" That means there are two objects because there are two \"tos\" in the sentence. \"Would\" does not have any more objects as it is a question word. \"To the grocery\" has only one object because the \"to.\" \"Would\" has the same rule of one object. The last two sentences would be incorrect because the verbs are \"want\" and \"go.\" Although \"want\" does not always have one object, it does in the sentence and should answer \"A\" as the only choice that has more than one object. To test this, just replace the \"to\" and it becomes, \"I would the grocery,\" which is incorrect. \"To the store\" becomes \"to go,\" and the sentence is correct. \"Want the grocery\" is incorrect because the verb is \"want\" and should answer as \"B\" because it has two objects. \"Would\" has more than one object, \"to the store.\" The best answer to the question is: I would go to a store.\nSo the final answers would be A and B.\n\nInput:What is at least one thing that is good about working at a library?

{"idx": 925, "text": "Explanation:\nWhen you're getting ready for your outdoor fitness activities and you get geared up, you will most likely hear people who talk about pre-workout, post-workout and recovery. The pre-workout basically gives you the drive to workout, the post-exercise provides the body with the necessary nutrients to repair muscles and the recovery period provides the body with the needed support to prevent any muscle soreness.\nLet's break things down a bit if the body is getting a work out. For starters, you have to make sure you're getting enough water into your body. Water helps with thermoregulation during exercise. As soon as your muscles start to ache during an outdoor activity, your body will give you the signal to stop.\nSo, how do you know you're getting enough hydration for the outdoor activities? Your urine should be a light blue if you're hydrated. If it's dark yellow, your cells will not receive enough water. So even before your exercise, you need to load hydration into your system.\nAlso take note that you need electrolytes and carbohydrates as you run or walk. A lot of people feel like if you take in more liquid you're hydration is fixed. On the other hand, the sugar and salt combination is critical in replenishing your body.\nIf you feel like your body is burning and your feet are on fire, you're most likely out of electrolytes. If you have to run to a hydration station, make sure you fill your water bottle with the recommended ratio of 16 ounces of water per 8 ounces of electrolyte drink for best results.\nAnswer: Since the person who wrote the question got the answers mixed up here, we feel that the person got tired in the middle of the exercise and feeling sore was simply him thinking about the discomfort that he feels, the answer isn't \"workout\".\n\nIn general, you won't feel sore after an outdoor activity. It's more like a burned out if you feel more exhausted and not a muscular soreness. Muscular soreness can be fixed with proper hydration and recuperation as mentioned above.\n\nAnswer: Choices: A, B, C, D, E", "answer": "C: get tired"}

E. 5 choices  - the 9th, 15th, 21st, 27th, and 33rd items.\nOutput: This can be answered in two different ways. Say the number of items is N. There are 10C5 different choices. The answer is, in fact, E. However, one possible approach is to determine how many choices there are for every combination of the first N people. For there to be 1 choice, only one person from the list should be chosen. For there to be two choices, two persons from the list should be asked in the same order. For there to be three choices, three persons from the list should all be asked in different orders. For there to be four choices, you have four arrangements (ABCD, ACBD, BACD, BCAD). Thus, 10C3. This is essentially the same as choosing the first N items at random and asking for information about them. Another way of thinking about it is to imagine asking the 1st person in the list and then the 2nd person and so on. If you do this, you only have 5C1 different choices--the first choice is the entire list.\nSo the final answer we came up with is E\n\nInput: You wish to fill nine boxes with 16, 11,", "answer": "C: cupboard"}

If the closet is full of stinky clothing and your nose becomes accustomed to the smells, there is actually no smell. D. All textiles have the inherent ability to remove, or at least reduce, the odors associated with everyday use and care. Just by their nature and physical structure, textiles can absorb and mask odors. Textiles provide a protective barrier between the body and clothing. The human body is a significant source of odor. Textiles are very good at removing odors. All textiles need oxygen and air circulation. If air circulation is restricted, odors associated with use will become more noticeable.

They used many different tools as well as some simple tools which had been handed down through generations\n\nFirst they used pliers to cut the wood in the trees. Then they used saws to cut the blocks of wood into the right dimensions. Then with some nail guns, they nailed the wood into the structure of the building. The wood was so strong and firm.\n\nOnce everything was built, they used some screws to hold the frames together. Some people were using hammers to make sure that the wood frames were solid. The wood was so heavy that the builders got tired. They were working around the clock and even all night.\n\nAt last, everything that they had imagined came true. They were so happy.\n\nIn just six days and five nights, they completed the building. It was huge- the largest building in the village- with one hundred rooms. In front of the building was a beautiful pond. The trees were old, but because the pine tree was there, they used the parts of the tree to carve it up and make some ladders that went all the way up to the roof.\n\nThe village elder was so happy. He asked, \"What shall I call this building?\n\nEveryone was quiet. One said, \"How about the'Pine Tree House?\"\nEveryone began to laugh.

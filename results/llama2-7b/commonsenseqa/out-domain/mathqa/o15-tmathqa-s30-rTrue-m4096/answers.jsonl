Choices:\n$2 per quart or $1 per liter $2 per quart or $0.50 per liter $2 per liter or $1 per quart $3 per quart or $0.50 per liter\nOutput: The first thing to note is that the answer is not $3 per quart as the choices seem to imply. In part, this may be because one should keep in mind that 1 liter is equal to 1/4 of 1 gallon. Therefor the statement per quart does not make sense since there are four quarts per gallon.\nSecond, the question appears to ask for the two prices that will give $2 per quart. The answer of $2 per quart or 0.50 per quart is the correct answer since 2/4=1/2, implying $2", "answer": "D: food court"}

{"idx": 110, "text": "A: carried by people. Geese are so heavy. How do they get from place to place?\nSo the final answer A: carried by people\n\nInput:Geese have been known to fly in the \"V\" formation, what's different about geese that would make this formation work? Choices: the geese can flap their wings so that they can fly really fast and so the geese can balance the loads between each other by flapping their wings the geese all have the same weight and are always in uniform groups of one goose carrying another group of geese the geese are following another bird that can carry them so the geese can just use that as the direction for flying the geese all have their eyes on the goose that is in front of them\nOutput: \"So, the geese all have eyes on the goose in front of them, right? Why would this formation work, and why would it work only when some goose is in front of others? Let's try a different formation that seems to involve having eyes on the goose... A single goose flying in the V formation would have to look down to see all the other geese, and it would never be looking ahead. A formation of goose flying right on top of each other would not be able to flap their wings. If a goose is flying above another, it can't flap its wings to go up or down. Geese flying in the \"V\" could have formed such a tight circle that they'd crash into each other. So there's got to be some advantage to staying in formation, right? Well, the geese are following a leader of some sort, and if the leader suddenly turns to the right or to the left, the geese have to also. The advantage is that the geese in the middle don't have to do any thinking at all. If they are to the right of the leader, they just have to turn their wings to the right.\"\nSo the final answer D: fly group together\n\nInput:The geese's eyes in the \"V\" are on the goose ahead of it. There are two ways to understand this: one in-depth, and the other simple. The more in-depth way is that these eyes are on the goose for balance and communication. There is an understanding between geese that goose in the middle needs to keep its eyes on the front go", "answer": "C: fly"}

Cuckoo Clocks often display a moving figure on the clock face. Sometimes, their doors lift up to enable the Cuckoo's voice to be heard. The Clock is then said to be in song. They are called such clocks because at the hour they are about to chime, a cuckoo bird (or, sometimes the glockenspiel) imitates the call of a cuckoo. At certain intervals of the year, they call at the same time each day. The tradition of cuckoo clocks is thought to be 1737 (and possibly as early as 1649) in Germany. They are especially popular in Black Forest Germany. As of 2008, an estimated 58,000 cuckoo clocks are made each year in Germany (more than two-thirds of all cuckoo clocks in the world). However, the mechanical technology and production were later moved into China, the Philippines, and Indonesia, where the majority of cuckoo clock production occurs today.

A bassoon is a baritone (low-range) woodwind instrument which is played in orchestra and other big musical groups, often playing in groups of 2-10. A symphony orchestra would not typically feature just one instrument. Orchestras are large groups (conducted by a conductor) which typically feature 12/13 pieces, but not just 1. They would require a mix of instruments to play the parts assigned to them. A symphony is the type of piece of music you get an orchestra to play.

Choices: 1629, 1824, 1942, 2129, 2156, 2160, 2172, 2282, 2299\nOutput: 2299: (16) * (16) and (22) * (16). The answer here is simple if you're willing to make some work. The problem is: given n and k, determine all the possible combinations of n that are divisible by k. In order to do this, you need to start with an n with at least one divisor of k, let's just say 3. Let's represent 3 as \"3x3x...\". You can represent the set of all sets of length n, and multiply by the xn's, forming an * (cartesis) symbol. The problem here is that of course n will be at least 3, meaning that the problem will be N/k (assuming k isn't 3), so you can't do \"3x3x\" since you need at least one term of length 3, and at least one of those will not be divisible by 3 (since it's a set and not a number), hence \"33x\".

Choices: 152nd 156th 162th 169th\nOutput:The correct word is: 159th\nSo the final answer : 159th \n\n\n## Solution\nThe problem states that all integers are either prime or composite.\n\nAn interesting observation is that when a number is not prime, we can always find an odd divisor, since it can be done by simple arithmetic, such as 5 = 3 + 2 ; 30 = 2 * 15, etc. and all divisions start with 1. \n\nIf we use the integer 2301 to test, since it is obviously composite, it is divisible by 1, 3, 5, 11, 169, 367, 441 and 2301 = 11*211, we thus get the odd divisor 211 is a prime divisor. Therefore 2301 is composite.\n\nNow using the method of arithmetic division we find that the only odd divisors of 2301 are 1, 3 and 5, so the remainder when 2301 \u00f7 3 is 3, and all nonprime numbers are composite, so clearly there are no even prime numbers and the only even prime numbers are composite.\n\nSo 2301 as an integer is composite.", "answer": "E: arkansas"}

We never thought of putting two people together with the two chairs, we always thought that they will sit one on one two people sitting on the same chairs. But today, two people are never found together at the same time to sit at the same table or sitting at the same bench or at the same bar. They are always separated to sit. So no chairs or benches or beds are made which are good for two people to sit on together. Only if one is sick, then he has to lie down on the hospital bed and the other has to sit beside.\nSo this question is not going to make any sense unless you go back a hundred years or more to tell them that if these chairs and tables aren't available, they have to sit on the road or in some jail. Otherwise who are going to be with them? We are also seeing them sitting in that condition. But those days are gone, such stools, chairs, benches, beds have also become less in the market now-a-days.

This step is particularly critical because it is impossible to do a thorough job of exploring the topic if you have not precisely and clearly identified it. The goal of this step is to narrow down your broad topic into a precise research question. Your research question must include:\n1. A specific area of focus (the population and/or phenomenon)\n2. The variables you will use to explore that focus (the independent and dependent variables)\n3. The data you will collect to measure those variables (the data collection approach)\n4. A research objective (What do you want to know? What are your key hypotheses?)\nNote that your specific area of focus can encompass a broad topic. It is the specific focus you chose to investigate that determines the breadth or depth of your research question.

The Bankrate credit score was created by the consumer ratings website Bankrate. There\u2019s a huge difference between the credit scores that Americans have, especially because some people are just more meticulous about their payments than others. It\u2019s hard to generalize based on our research and the fact that we would assume all Americans have the same credit scores is a stretch. U S A is the most accurate and true answer though. It\u2019s interesting that Canadians have a higher average credit score though; they seem to take their debt more seriously and tend to avoid the high interest offered by credit cards. Bankrate and FICO are two different credit scoring models, so the results may vary slightly when comparing the two but it\u2019s best for those who\u2019re interested in applying for loans to have the highest credit score possible.\"\nSo the final answer should be A (US)", "answer": "C: opera"}

( ii ). find the probability that the number of passengers on the ship will be less than 40. well we know that the mean age of our group is 75 yrs, so p ( x ) = 1 / 12. that is probability that the number of passenger on the ship is less than 40 is 1 / 16.

Choice a, b and c are impossible, because the riddle specifies that we are near the river. So choice d is obviously not correct. Choice e is correct if you live near the sea (but that is not specified in the riddle). I tried with the choices: d - make bread; and e - make bread, and the output remained the same.(ii) As for the explanation for a - grill, and b - go to market, I think the explanation is not valid. Choice a implies that you are near the sea, in order to grill. So if you are grilling, then you must be near the sea. The same applies for choice b, because people don't usually go to the market to bring food fish, while living near the river, i.e., \"on the water\". \n\nAnswer: Answer: \"B\" for Bread making is the answer. I think the other answers are poorly explained.\n\nYou are right: \"grilling\" implies you are close to water \"on the shore\".

For example: `Console.WriteLine(\"Enter a number to add\");`. You have to explicitly add quotation marks (such as \"2\") when you type in a string to the console.\n\nComment: Oh Thank you very very much I see what I was doing wrong. Thank you so very very much.\n\nAnswer: @jdoe,\nPlease change the line\nConsole.WriteLine; to Console.Readline; otherwise, it will show first 1st question then wait for input from user.

In short, under their plan, no country could enjoy a rising standard of living without making others worse off by restricting their incomes. In order to maintain an even field, they argue that each nation would have to abide by the same restrictive conditions - a plan which, they argue, would be in the interest of both employers and employees. Under their proposed plan, economic growth in one nation does not adversely affect others, employers and employees get a bigger cut from the economic cake, and the world economy remains stable.\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate response to the author's proposal?\n\na) The author would be wise to include his fellow economists on the group discussing the feasibility of his proposal.\nb) The author's fellow economists have not considered the psychological effects their proposals might cause if their plan were followed.\nc) The author's plans would require that many people would be required to travel frequently to and from other countries to continue their jobs.\nd) The international trade unions should put pressure on the author's group and his fellow economists until the whole issue is resolved.\ne) The author should explain that the plan his fellow economists propose is not intended to adversely effect people's lives - they are only trying to stabilize the world economy.\nSo the final answer are e\n\nInput:\"The only way I can save time is to make my life simpler!\"\n\n\"That's a good point.

'Nine' will be an incorrect\nanswer.\n\nExplanation : the fraction with the given remainder to ( 3 digits ) 926 /\n928 = 925 / 927. its two digit remainders are same. now consider the fraction\nwith two digit remainders, the answer is 199. now consider its three digit\nremainders. 992 and 998 are divisible by 992 /998 = 111. 992 / ( 111 * 9 ) =\n199. and 998 / ( 11 * 99 ) = 199. now check the last digit remainders. 111\nis divisible by 11, but 99 is not so the fraction must have at least 2 digit\nremainder. the answer will be 199. but there are 992 /866, 927 /806 and 1037 /767\nwhich all have the same remainders to the ones given as correct. but note that\nnot all of them will be in two digits only. now we need to consider only the\nfractions with two digit remainders.\n\nso our fraction must be 992 /448 or similar, say 992 /248 ( using the same method as just given. 248 *", "answer": "E: internet sites"}

{"idx": 674, "text": "A\nSo the final answer it is A\n\n### Instruction:Analyze the following situation and give your opinion.\n\nInput:The managers of a retail store were discussing the possibility of having a cash register built especially for the store. The average register time for all items purchased in the store was about 40 seconds. However, one line item\u2014a computer chip\u2014took 410 percent more time than the average register time. If register time for items not sold was also factored in, the figure would balloon to 1800 percent higher than the average. The manager\u2019s discussion became quite heated but was settled when some of the salespeople pointed out that they could not sell more items if register times were drastically increased.\n\nSolution:As the total 410% more time taken for registering one item, it can be inferred that the sales per hour will go down to 1/4th of what it is. Moreover, if sales per hour go down to 180% of its average, there is no question of increase in sales. Moreover, given that only 5-10 items are registered per hour, the sales may go below average in which case the decrease would be further. Since computer chip is a single item, it takes more time. If, as the question says, if register time for other items is factored in too, then the sales must go down even further. \n\nSo the final answer must be that the option is D\n\n###Instruction:Analyze  the following situation and give  your opinion.\n\nCleaning a 2-d object on a paper, when one moves, the paper cuts the shape like a razor blade on the object.

{"idx": 794, "text": "Solution: A is the correct answer.  Choice A makes no sense, because you will never find a double-edge razor in the pocket unless it is one of those fake blades they sell to make sure that you buy a new razor.  All other choices would involve the razor actually being used to shave.\nHere an error has occurred.  There are no double-edge razors in the shower, or in the drug store.  A double-edge razor is actually something to be careful with, and you don't want to get it wet.  It is more than likely a single-edge razor will be sold to you for showering and you will not be given a shaving kit.  So either people would keep them in the shower, the chemist, or the drug store.  The chemist and the drug store sell razors in shaving kits but they don't have a double-edge razors.  You will often get a single-edged razor in the shaving kit and a new double-edge razor to shave with.  There are also razors that do a better job at shaving than a double-edge razot and they are usually much safer to use.  All in all, the double-edge razor would not be carried around by most people because they would know better.\nHence the best conclusion is that the double-edge razors wouldn\u2019t go in the pocket except a special case, but other choices are not likely to be a razor because of its weight and sharpness.  B and C have little to no validity based on the information given.\nWe have no data on how often a single blade razor will cut through your skin and therefore A would be correct.  Since A is the answer to the problem, B would be a false choice.  So in the long run this question would be incorrect.\n\nInput:A woman is walking to the shopping centre.

Franklin got the idea from science and other books. He also made some improvements in medicine, agriculture, and education. Franklin helped colonize many cities, counties, and states. He invented other things, too. The first light bulb was a kerosene lamp that shined light and cast off little heat. It had a metal base and a glass chimney (the top). Franklin also invented the pump jack that helped bring oil out of the ground. Many people use that today. He made a metal battery out of wood and rubber. People used this battery to treat the sick and to teach the blind to read. There were several things on the kerosene lamps. He called them things to keep insects out. They were a glass chimney, a pewter or aluminum base, and a wick to burn the oil. The glass covered the lamp and made the light brighter. Franklin made a glass that helped refract light and made it brighter. He also designed a lens for it. It helped the light from the candle shine on more places.

{"idx": 867, "text": "Answer: ( E )\nThe correct answer to this question requires a bit of historical knowledge, and the author was presumably addressing an educated reader. So while there will probably be some people who don't know this answer, you'll be able to spot if a candidate has any problems, by the length of time they spend on this question.\n\nInput:\\d{3}{4}- \\d \\d{4} is a sequence of 9 characters. What is the length of the longest string in this sequence which is also a permutation of its alphabet? Choices: A: Nine B: Four C: Six D: Eight E: Seven\nOutput:\nAnswer: (D)\nIt'll take very little time to spot that this question is really just a string permutation problem. The only thing which makes it more difficult is the way the question is phrased.\n\nThe question does not specify what the format is, but we can reasonably argue that it must consist of three numbers, each separated on the right by a space. This makes it 30 characters long, which fits the definition of a string. However, it's still worth checking the output of strlen() for a 30-byte string if you're not sure, though I doubt you'll need to spend too long on this to spot the correct answer.\n\nWithout too much difficulty, we can see that all the other answers have strings which we can describe as being of length 4. The length of the original string is 9, so the longest string (which is also a permutation) is of length which is the smallest of the lengths of the 4-character permutations. 4 + 4 + 8 = 16, which is what the answer is.\n\nOne final note, it doesn't seem to matter too much whether the question is phrased as three parts, or just one part which looks like a number of characters (400 characters, 1000 characters...). Both of these were used on the test, in case you're wondering.\n\nInput:Which of the following is equivalent to the floor function, rounding down?

Now, since the king's death, the whole kingdom has gone to a very boring war on the eastern fringe of the kingdom where the only thing of interest is to watch the battle.\nThere are 50 towns in the kingdom, each with 500 men. All of those men (the 25,000) are going to the battle, and the king, widow, and a few important dignitaries are going too. You can't leave a town with less than 100 men, so that means that 1500 men are coming home (including some from the royal party). The first 1000 people who scream Long live the king (their reward) will get a third of the fortune (which may be millions for the winner or just a cup for the loser), and the next 500 will get a quarter. The money can be split as they like, but 500 people getting a quarter is much better than 50 getting a third. The 501st person who calls out will just get an empty cup.\nThe people in each town will choose the man who will shout out the announcement. However, the richer the town, the less influence the poor people have. For the rich people:\n2500 men = 150 million\n1500 men =  50 million\n500 men =50 million\nAs for the poor people:\n25", "answer": "B: bamboo grove"}

Choices: 150 beans 300 beans 1000 beans 350 beans\nOutput:Answer: (A). If it is a glass jar then the capacity of the contents of the jar will be one tenth of the volume of the jar. If the jar is 12 cm high, then the volume of the jar is 1/3rd liter or approximately 1/2 dl. Let us say the jar is half full. Now 250 beans will occupy 0.1 dl. Now let us assume that there are only 249 beans in the jar. Now if we fill the jar in the following way:\n\nFirst 1/2 d.l. \u2013 250 be\n\nnext 1/4 d.l. Beans \u2013 249 be\n\nnext 3 d.l. \u2013 water \u2013 0 beans.\n\nThe container will be half full after the first lot of beans. Therefore it can hold 1/3d.l. more beans \u2013 245 beans.\nTherefore there are 245 beads in the jar. If you fill the bottom of the jar with beans, then we can say that the container is one fourth full \u2013 67 beans. So it will contain 245 +", "answer": "B: exhaustion"}

{"idx": 960, "text": "\"I think the answer is : B. Aquarium. But I'll see if I' m right because it depends on how it is set up. The shallow part of the aquarium is typically the top of the container where the animals live. Also, for aquariums with fish that swim up to the water surface, sometimes the top part of the water is shallowed. However, these conditions are not found in all fish tanks.  In a swimming pond that has a deep part and a shallow part, the shallow area is typically 6 inches or less deep. A pond that is deeper than 6 inches does not qualify as a shallow pond.  A pond that is shallower than 6 inches also does not qualify as shallow. But it can be 6 inches or more deep if you want to consider a pond shallow. This depends on the type of water in the pond that you are talking about.  If you look into a children's pool, it might be 0 or 6 inches deep.  It depends on the age of the child in it and the depth of the water from the bottom of the pool to the surface of the kids pool.  So if there is no surface level, then the deepest part is the 6 inches or less of the water that is 6 inches or less.  If there is a surface, then the deepest parts are from the 6 inch deep area to the surface of kids pool, so it is the entire kids pool that is shallow and deep.  For a lake, you need to consider the depth of the water under the water. If you take a lake and place it on a map, for example:  Lake Huron = 12 feet deep.  Lake of the Ozarks = 15 feet deep.\"\nSo the final answer does not exist\n\nInput: Find the sum of the reciprocal values of all the positive integers smaller than or equal to 8799. a ) 21, b ) 25, c ) 26, d ) 29, e ) none of these\nOutput: \" 8799 / ( ( 1 + 8799 ) / ( 1 + 1 ) ) = 8799 \u00f7 1000000 = 0.01 =", "answer": "D: pond"}

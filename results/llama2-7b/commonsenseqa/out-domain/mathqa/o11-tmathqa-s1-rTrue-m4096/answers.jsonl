The other two options, saying 'What was your name?' or 'What have you been doing?' are the two I was expecting. You should always ask your name after meeting someone, but the other option is not very common. When meeting a person for the first time, you will learn a great deal from them just from their name.

The question is provided without context or scoring guide. When reviewing questions on standardized tests, you will encounter questions similar to this question every now and then. For example, the following passage is typical of the type of text you may see on standardized tests:\n\n```\nThe population of the United States in 1996 is estimated to be 259,404,000 or approximately 100,000,001. We know, therefore, that there are 4.994367503284905865 people in this country. Given this data, we can infer that there are significantly more females than males (60% males and 40% females).\n```\n\nThe following text of this type is typical of the type you may encounter on standardized verbal/language arts sections. You must also analyze such text to determine if the writer has presented a logical argument or one that is unsupported by the available evidence.\n\n```\nIt is hard to keep a good man down. Hard working, strong-willed, and hard to beat\u2014all of these phrases apply to a champion. The best champion boxer of the 20th century was Muhammad Ali.\n```\n\nThe writer of this passage does not provide any support to back up claims such as it is hard to beat Ali. Is a good champion hard to beat? It is impossible to know based on this piece of writing, and that is why many questions like this can trip up test takers. Make sure to back up these claims based on the evidence presented in the passage.\n\n```\nWhen you visit the Louvre, you can find a whole host of masterpieces. One such is the Mona Lisa. The Mona Lisa is considered one of the greatest works of art of all time, and has sparked more debate than any other.

{"idx": 435, "text": "\"choices : A, C, D. B is false. from sky, you can look any place with a specific line you select. it is not limited by the shape of the earth. however, the line you select will still be a line. ( as opposed to a polygon for example ). only from map, you can see a complete view of a line. you may be able to identify the exact line, but its length / width would not be exactly clear. only if you cross the line of the country by your own foot, you are going to be able to see the complete line. ( even a mountain cannot obstruct your view of horizontal line ). as the definition of country is to be in a foreign place, a country line also needs a shape with other country sides. in contrast, you cannot make a foreign line within a single country. therefore, if your aim is to see the complete line of a country, driving a car or flying a plane is the only possible way.\"\nSo the answer is option D\n\nInput:if you are 12 years old and your grandfather is 63 years old.

( since you are 60 for grand son. ) now we find the number of years when they are 24. the answer can be found out by finding the 24th term of sequence 6n. hence, ( 6g \u2013 1 ) mod 24 = 6g \u2013 24. simplify the above equation to ( 6 * 11g \u2013 13 ) mod 24. 11 * 24 = 264. 13 = 211. solution of above for 6g is 56. hence, the answer is option  c.\"\nSo answer is e\n\n```\n[a].", "answer": "B: map"}

We need to find out where he had last seen it, in order to find where it is missing from, as implied by the word'remember' in the sentence.\n\nThere are 3 instances of'remember' in this question.

Choices:  A : it is made up of cells B: it is one large organ C: it is the most complex organ in the body D: it is the only brain E: it is the hottest organ\nOutput: \"answer b: the brain is made up of about 100 billion nerve cells, called neurons. neurons are shaped like tree branches, with tiny hairs called axons sprouting out from their ends. Dendrites are the branches of these neurons, and the points at which they come together and communicate messages. Axons, or branches, are what send the information to other neurons. When a neuron receives a signal from one branch, it sends that message along the entire length of the branch. Because each branch transmits a signal to every other branch, the brain looks like a large network. The more neural connections a neuron has, the more connections and information it can retain. Information moves from one neuron to another through a process called neurotransmission. In neurotransmission, a chemical secreted by one neuron attaches to a protein on a receptor molecule of another neuron. The attachment activates the receptor molecule, which then triggers the electrical response in the receiving neuron. Neurotransmitters are classified into two groups. One type is called a neurotransmitter, while the other is an excito-toxin. A neurotransmitter is not able to kill cells as an excito-toxic is able to do. Neurotransmitter molecules do differ in several ways. Some neurotransmitter molecule types are fast acting, while others are slower acting. Additionally, neurotransmitters interact with their specific receptors in different ways. Some neurotranmitters cause an immediate, full activation, while others cause an immediate, partial activation.\"\nSo, the final answer should be b.", "answer": "D: conjunction"}

This situation leads to economic instability and unemployment. the people have to hold money not goods so they cannot buy as much.\nSo the final answer  is D\n\nInput: what\u2019s the point of an electric switch when you can open and close a main circuit by physically moving a coil attached to a control circuit? Choices: A: It limits the number of people who can control the circuit B: It automatically opens and closes when the circuit experiences a disturbance or fault C: It eliminates the need for the main and control circuits and their control devices D: It makes control of a circuit more simple E: It minimizes the power loss and efficiency in the circuit\nOutput:An electric switch is used in circuits to limit current flow. The switch is used in applications where manual, or physical, control is needed. For example, if a circuit that is designed to have a limited current ( such as a pilot light on a stove ) is wired incorrectly and contains too much current, a switch in the circuit detects the condition and opens to stop the current. Switches are simple and effective ways for control circuit designers to provide control.  If a large motor or motor bank is designed to be controlled by a single control circuit, many other control points in the circuit may not be necessary. The switch is the simple, quick, and cost - effective way to provide this control.\nSo the final answare is E\n\nInput: the power of a pump has to be increased by 50 %.how much power is needed for the engine to run at half speed, when the pump of the desired power is used?\nOutput:\nSo the final answer E\n\nInput: how much does it cost to move 100 gallons of water 100 feet high by a single screw auger?", "answer": "D: economic instability"}

In decimal numbers, the decimal point is a way to show that 0.999999 is equal to 1 and 0. 99999 \u2026. For example, 143.99 is the number equivalent to 143.14399\u2026.. 143.344399 \u2026.. and so on. that is, since there are 14 decimal places between the decimal point and the 3 digit number, there are 14 numbers that have the same value as the decimal point. 143.099999\u2026., 143.2999\u2026., 143. 3999\u2026.,\u2026. is the same as 143.

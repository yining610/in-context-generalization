They both died in the year 626, the same year that the Tang Dynasty was founded, when the Chinese calendar's cycle ended and began again. The list includes the first day of the lunar year 4642, or Sunday ( ) 29 February 1942, the 36th day of the lunar calendar and a leap week. A few other people have died on 28 or 29 February. There were some minor changes to the calendar in the 16th century, but 29 February was not made a normal day. This list does not include people who died at sea or in the mountains.\"\n\nSo for my part the second choice is true and it shows that sometimes people die on this specific day (29th February). And it can be proved by the sentence'There were some minor changes in the 16century but 29th february was not made a normal in the calender'.\n\nInput: The time period of the 425th Super Bowl is not yet known, but it will definitely be played  ( ) 11.

Therefore the base-ten exponent with first digit of the power is 7 the second digit of the exponent's value is 7. The number of digits should also 7. 8 is the 3rd digit which is the place value of the digit 8 if the 3rd digit is multiplied by 10 the sum is 70. 10 the sum of 8 is 8. Hence the 2nd place value digit should be 8.\nThe third and fourth place value digit should be the 4th and fifth digit in base-ten.\nDigit 6 multiplied by 16 is 104.

After that, the train continues to travel for 9 hours at a faster speed. After 17 hours the train and the car return to their original starting positions from the previous day. If a train and a car travel a distance of 519 miles in 17 hours, what is the average speed of the car?\nOutput: After 17 hours, the car starts 519/5 = 103 miles behind the train. This is because the car is traveling for 5 hours at a rate of 15 mph less than the train, and then the car is making up the time while the train is traveling for 9 hours at an accelerated speed.\nThe distance made up by the car must divide the time used to make it up by 103 / ( 15 + 5 + 5 ) ~ 44 ~ 45 = 1075.3191. This means the car traveled ( 1075 / 2 ) \u2013 ( 1070 / 2 ) = 42 miles. This leaves 62 miles. The car traveled for ( 62 / 2 ) * 5 ~ 31.5 hours, and the car traveled the remaining 519 \u2013 31.5 = 487.5 miles.

The expected sales volume for the year is 3,000, while the expected cost for each radio commercial is $4,000 and the expected cost for direct mail is $2,000. Also, it is known that: The expected direct mail return (total revenue minus total cost) is 29%, which means for every $100 spent on direct mail the company can expect to receive $129. The expected radio return is 30%, which means for every radio commercial the company can expect to make $300.

What is wrong with this exercise?\nThis question is a setup for the wrong answer trap. People who choose D, the hardware store, are correct. They make a good guess. But in the vast majority of people who chose D, not a single one guessed that the right answer was A, the supermarket. As a result, if the author had asked the group why D, they would all have come up with some incorrect reason, such as \"I've always bought my bags at home in the closet\" (very common in this case). After 1/3 of the group has given their reason, then the facilitator reveals that the correct answer is A, the supermarket, and so all the members in these 1/3 of groups had been providing correct but unnecessary reasons for their choices. Then another 1/3 of people would say \"Ah, so that's why D must be wrong!\" but would then go on to give the same incorrect reason for D that D was chosen because D \"came to mind,\" etc. So, with very few people ever thinking about the choice D as being correct, it would be almost impossible to get enough people to recognize that the correct answer would be A.\nSo the final answer will be A!\n\nInput: How much would 0.04 grams of silver cost?

Also, we're always excited to do something new.

In addition, sitting in the position is actually exhausting, it must make us lazy. Whereas Standing Position is the best choice, because the body position is more comfortable and the body is less fatigued.\nExplanation (B): When we are in the situation where we are working (starting), if we are excited, we tend to be more productive. In addition, the body of a person will produce endorphins. And endorphins are said to be useful for the body's immune system by making us feel less stressed and happier, if we are on an endorphin, we tend to be stressed or depressed.\nExplanation: (C), when we are tired, we are already more inactive and we do less efficient work.

{"idx": 422, "text": "Answer- C \nThe man who lives at 1101 Lakeside Apartments in Phoenix, Arizona, USA, spends many a night sitting on the front porch reading one book after another. He usually reads several books at the same time, keeping at hand the book that is providing the most excitement at the moment.  He is especially fond of books that describe people who face new and unusual things in their lives.  He has read many true stories about unusual experiences and has studied many other books about the lives of people who have had their lives changed by extraordinary occurrences. Many of these occurrences were happy, but a few of them were sad. However, these tales all have one thing in common: they are about people who have had their worlds turned upside down by events they could not control or predict.  His favorite tale is the one he calls The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. He has read it a dozen times by now and has a clear picture of what he thinks it must have been like to live in those days.  Huck Finn, the main character in the book, was a boy who did not like to read very much; but he had to read any book he could to hold up the interest of the other children in the town.  At least once or twice out of every seven days, he had to be taught how to spell.  After he learned to read, he could not keep the books he read, because his papa took them for scrap out of a rag factory. But his cousin, Sid, who lived in New York City, sent him five books as gifts, and out of gratitude for the fine care with which they were printed on strong, glossy paper, Huck put them into a drawer and kept them under lock and key.  Then he read and read until his eyes ached.  Every night when he was afraid of his papa coming in, he would hide the books under the hearthstone. But one night while he sat looking at the fire, he felt something soft under the stone.  He lifted the lid; and there lay the three books he had given him the year before, and all of them damp.  The rotten leaves had fallen out of them; the bindings were cracked; and when he opened the books he found they were full of dirt and dead bugs.

(3, 755, 205)\n\nBankruptcy is almost always the result when you can not pay your bills when they come due. With the economy in a near depression conditions and unemployment over 15% in many states, bankruptcy filings in 2009 continue to increase significantly. More than 1.4 million people have filed for bankruptcy so far this year, according to statistics from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.\n\nIf these numbers continue to grow at these levels, 2009 will go down as one of the worst years for filing bankruptcy. A recent report in the New York Times shows that bankruptcy filings are on pace to be the highest ever this year. The report indicated that more than 140,000 businesses file for bankruptcy so-far in 2008. In all, the number of bankruptcy filings is over half what it was in 2006 when the filings were at 1.6 million. The growth of the economy and reduction of national unemployment rates is a more important factor than ever in bankruptcy filings, as they are up 20 percent over the same period last year.\n\nThe reason is that more people will lose their jobs and their debt will increase over time. These people will have no choice but to look for bankruptcy help from an attorney so that they don\u2019t have their debt taken over by the bank.\nA recent article from Consumer Affairs reported that bankruptcy filing rates dropped considerably in 2010. The Wall Street Journal reported that \u201cmore filings would typically equate to more loans, but that is not likely as banks become more risk averse, making it harder to get loans, including mortgages.\u201d  The Wall Street Journal also reports that \u201cBoth personal and business bankruptcies fell to the lowest level since 1", "answer": "C: playroom"}

How many people in total went out to dinner with the two men?\nSolution: One week later, the two men and the woman did not go out together. The two men went out to dinner together, but no woman. The only possible solution is that there are three people.\nExplanation: \nThis question is a logic puzzle problem (a.k.a. a disguised multiple-choice question). The question contains three statements. The first statement states that at the wedding, the man met with the woman. The second statement states that there were three men and one woman in the wedding. The last statement states that there were two men and a woman in the dinner. According to this question, it is either the case that a) The man and the woman were married together. Otherwise, it is impossible because in the first statement, the man was on a wedding and yet did not meet the woman at the wedding. At least if the man and the woman were in this wedding, they would meet at this wedding. Alternatively, the woman was the maid of honor. That would mean the two men and woman were there but not the man. That is a possible situation, but, again, they should meet each other. Therefore, they could not go out, together.

There is a variety of sports stores which provide a good selection of fishing rods and other fishing items but these other stores would have minimal, if any, selection of sporting implement. The sporting goods store is a very specific selection of merchandise and should not included but a fishing rod should be included. A hardware store has an extensive selection of general hardware including items such as faucets as well as a limited selection non-sporting fishing related items. They are not a general store, they specialize so they are not a selection. A furniture store would not have fishing related items in it. The fishing camp would probably have a decent selection of rods and fishing equipment. It would depend on the fishing camp.

{"idx": 762, "text": "\"Explanation: We have a 2-option system of choices, each choice must come first before the other. For each choice, there are 3 options for choices. We start reading from choice A. From there, there are 3 choices. They are C, D, E. We would find the first letter of each choice, and it's the sequence which matters. I'll explain it again. We start from choice A, read the 1st letter in each choice, D. We would start with that choice, and see if any of the 3 options from E fit that choice, for example, we have an option E = curry. Because we only have 2 choices, we have to make sure we have E chosen every time we find an option, for example, if we pick curry, we have to choose reservation for next choice. So, we will repeat as many  steps like this until we find a solution which will match the answer. In this case, we don't match, because we have only one letter C for each choice that I said. Therefore, we will loop through the letter 'D' one more time and we match by choosing curry. A possible solution is ACDE.  This may only be partial as each of the options may have their own rules. It could be possible if we look at the options again and reinterpret them as possible variables or expressions, or as possible solutions to this problem. A: [4x^2+3x] C: curry D : {6+x} E : {x<=4} This now seems a lot more like a programming question than it was supposed to be (or was it?) I'm not sure as to what this question is asking for, therefore I'll leave this here.\"\nSo the final answer should be ACDE. It\u2019s like a recursive problem. For example,if you have 4 questions with 2 options each and only one choice is correct,then you must follow the recursion to figure out which choice must be the correct answer.\n\nInput: The ratio between the number of boys and girls is 7:9. how many children are in the class? a ) 36, b ) 45, c ) 54, d ) 60, e ) 64\nOutput: option (a) is correct because by cross-multiplying, it is equal to 1 / (", "answer": "C: curry"}

This time I am only going to spend 2 hours, so I need 24 shovels. Does this make any sense? Why or why not?\nOutput:\"It makes no sense at all. You'd have to have a gigantic driveway if it's going to take you 81 hours of shoveling with 24 shoves.

Or you could keep trying for 30 days. It takes 5 hours to shovel if you leave out the 83rd shoveling that you'd figure out was coming if not for this puzzle.\"\n\"So yeah, it totally makes sense. So that's your logic. What I'm saying is that you must not have as big a driveway as you think because you would've been able to shovel your way through it in the 83 hours before the puzzle.\"\n\"You could do this puzzle in reverse. When you go through the 78th shoveling you think'man, this is taking a bit longer than I thought.'

You would've figured out that you only need 23 shovels if not for this puzzler.\"\n\"It totally makes sense.

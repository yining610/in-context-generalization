{"idx": 68, "text": "D\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe first question should be the answer of 140. The correct solution is `140`, although `151` is a better answer. But there is no `148` in the answer choices.\n\nThe second question is trickier. There are both the smallest and the biggest spheres which have diameter of 24 cm (they have the radii 25 cm and 24 cm respectively ). \n\nThe measurement of the rectangular box is 25 cm x 24 cm x 18 cm. 18 cm is the largest spheres` circumference. Therefore, the diameter of this spheres is 9 cm. We multiply the diameter by ` \u03c0` to get the volume of the spheres. The correct answer is 2304. There is no 2302 in the choice of answers.\n\nThe third question seems to be the easiest one. We just choose the answer of every choice but the answer 1/28 which is incorrect.\n\nThe last question is even trickier but we can solve it. Choices are in two groups. The first group contains the answer \"wonderful\" which is actually \"wonder\". This is not a synonyma for \"cloud\". So the correct answer in the first group is, \"wonderful\". \"Wonderful\" can also be found in the second group while the answer \"wonder\" cannot. However, \"Wonderful\" is a bit longer than \"wonder\", it is 10 characters longer. So \"wonderful\" has 75% chance to be correct and \"wonder\" has 25% chance to be the correct one.", "answer": "B: feel good"}

We take the rounding up option which gives 152\n\nSo that the correct mean is 152\n### Part 2\n\nThe volume of the box is `= (25 + 24 + 18) cm^3`\nThus the volume of the box is around `452 cm^3`\n\nNow we have to find the largest sphere that can fit in this box i.e we have to find the sphere which has the diameter equal to or more than the given box. For the above diameter, there exists the largest sphere which has diameter of `cm 57`\n\nSo the volume of the sphere is `(Pi*r^2*h) cm^3` which is `~1453 cm^3`\n### Part 3\n\nFrom the option given, `1 / 18` is the smallest number that when divided by `1 / 33` will give us the answer as 1\n`-> 1/18 = 33 / 1`\nTherefore this is the fraction `1 / 106` which is ` 1 / 22`\n\n### Part4\n\nWe just need the most frequently mentioned word in the option set. So we see the most repeated word in the set is `hello` \n\nWe should take the option `D", "answer": "B: wave goodbye"}

{"idx": 889, "text": "A\nAnswer\n\n\n\n### Test 1\n\n#### Choice A\n\nLet $R$ be the set of all positive real numbers. I can find the mean of all $30$ real numbers from $R$. I would start by computing the mean from $x = 0$ to $30$ inclusively. This will give the mean of the lowest $30$ numbers. Then I would go from $x = 30$ to $60$ inclusively and compute the mean. Then I would go to $90$ and the mean of all the numbers $0...$ to $90$ inclusively. When looking at the final mean, if the final mean is not within $5$ units of the mean computed from $0...$ to the $30$th number, then I would know for sure that there is a problem with my computation. Thus, for Choice (B), I wouldn't know if there was a problem with my computation or not. It is possible that I could check an incorrect $x$, so I may be wrong.\n\n\n\n#### Choice B\n\nThis is just the special case where I compute the value from $0$ to $35$ inclusively. It is possible that some value of the original mean lies within $5$ units from the mean computed from $29$ to $64$ inclusively. It could be in the range $5.5$ and $6.5$, so I wouldn't be sure if there was a problem or not. If I add all the numbers in the second set and subtract from the first set, it doesn't guarantee that there is no problem. Even if I get a sum of $0$ I could have an incorrect number. There could be an intermediate correct value that could make the final sum incorrect.\n\n\n\n\n##### Choice C\n\nSince I would be checking one value for the entire range of the original mean, I wouldn't be able to be sure if there was an issue. I could, technically, make an error in the calculation.\n\n\n\n## Solution\n`Solution: Instruction:\n\nInput: The  matrix is  xyzabc1234 \n\nOutput: The columns of a matrix can be arranged in any order.

A word is an anagram of another word when they differ in the order of letters yet their meanings are the same. An example has been provided, just copy and modify it. Note: The size of the text is limited to 25. If the given text is longer than 25 words, just remove the extra words; you can leave them in the file but they won't be displayed. Also, in order to simplify things a little, the spaces are not necessary.<n><n>### Instrumentation:Use this anagrams program you wrote in previous instructions to do the following :<n><n>Input: anagrams( "The best time of day is in the afternoon sun!" )<n>Output: "The best time of the am I day!"

Choices:  A : 1 - n / n² B : 1 - n/ n C : 1 - n D : 1 + n/ n E : n<n>Output: E. 1-n/n is incorrect, because if n = 0 there is a 100% chance no one will be invited. If n is anything above 0 n/n is a 10. So 1-n/ n must follow a 1-10 rule, which is always less than 10%, which also contradict the rule that if all people in a certain group are invited there is a 1-0 chance one is not invited. A would also make no sense since 0 is excluded as well. The correct result of 1 - n/n is 0 if at least one person was invited, and 1 if at most one person was invited. This makes E the correct answer. <n><n>Input: If John and Jill buy 7/23 candy bars together, what fraction of the bars do John and Jill want to buy?

Tardiness won't happen if you groom every day, because you look good so you don't miss work. Vacation will not occur, because "looking good" would mean your work is done, you look at it, you're bored, you don't want to stay there until the end of the day, thus you'd leave and go home "looking good". And finally, you would be looking good because you go home each night and you wouldn't have an injury.

What tool should I use to fix this? Choices:  A: humidifier B: surface of earth C: skating rink D: ice cube E: burn it to the ground<n>Output:		<n>"the tool to use to fix this is A.  The rest are just jokes. The burn-to-the-ground is a joke because it would be impossible to even reach the house, so no way to fix the water crisis. Surface of earth is a joke that doesn't make any sense. Humidifier doesn't make much sense either. Skating rink doesn't add any value because this isn't winter, so no need."<n>So the final answer was A i.e humidifier<n><n>Input:How can you be sure that you aren't a horse that is trapped in a barn, and that if it were true you would find out? A: You can be sure since your birthday is in June B: Because you have a human brain C: Because you think you can D: Because you would be a horse and not a carnivore E: Because you are definitely human<n>Output:<n>"The answer can be found in the book of Abraham Lincoln. On every page, you can find a different set of riddles and puzzles similar to this. The one with 'human brain', 'be sure since your birthday' and 'definitely human' can be solved by looking for answers from an old book which says 'Definitely human, I'm not a horse.'"<n>So the final Answer is E i.e its a human not a horse, definitely human<n><n>Input: What would happen if you were to shove a ball through the end of a paper towel tube? A) The towel would unroll. B) The towel would roll. C) The ball would come out. D) The tube would burst. E) The towel would absorb water.<n>Output:<n>"If you push a ball through the end you would find that it comes out without a tube. This is probably the best way to get water out of a carpet."<n>So this also had the answer E "the towel would absorb the water not the ball"<n><n>Input: If I go to the bar, which of the following will almost certainly happen to me? (Choose all that apply) A. I'll see a girl that I like. B. I'll lose my friends. I'll end up on the verge of the ledge. C. I'll find a good way to keep busy. D.

This is a great way to practice data analysis for both logical understanding and quick mental math. If you want to read more about my strategies for SAT math, check out my article on SAT Data Analysis.<n>The SAT also includes word problems. These require a little patience and logical thinking to solve correctly. Here are a few examples of real SAT word questions and solutions.<n>I'm going to assume you've read the passage and already understand it fairly well. I'm going to show you a straightforward method for answering short-answer questions. This is the method I tell my students to use.<n>The first step to answering any multiple choice question is to read the entire question (and pay particular attention to the end). I've bolded the relevant part: a 215 foot wire is used to support a sign. The wire is stretched 7 feet from the sign to a bracket on the wall. The wire is 6 inches longer than that. If the wire does not move, how long is the wire?<n>That little phrase "If the wire does not move," is a clue (and a double-clue, since you could substitute "not move," into the question. "If the wire does move," or "If the wire does change," or "If the string does move." There you've got 4 clues that the wire is fixed.<n>The next step is to work backwards. If the wire is fixed, what do we know? Since we know the wire doesn't move, the distance from the wire to the bracket is 215 - 7 = 208 feet. The remaining length of wire (6" longer than that) is 216" - 208" = 8".<n>Step 3: Solve the equation - or as I like to call it, determine the missing part of the equation.<n>Here, we have 208 - 7 = 8.<n>So, you might start by using the equation you know to solve this:<n>8 = 208 - x<n>x = 208/8<n>x = 8336/8<n>x =... (you know where I'm going with this)<n>x = 8 = 6<n>Now, it just took you a bit of math to figure

Choices:  A: table B: restaurant C: cupboard D: kitchen E: sink<n>Output:		"The correct answer is C. Explanation:<n><n>"The first two choices don't make any sense. Table and restaurant will only make sense if one wants to take silverware where one eats. Kitchen, cupboard, and sink aren't options to put silverware. Since the given choices must be options of where to put silverware once one has dried them. Answer C is the correct option because it's the only option that can be followed by the phrase “but you're not ready...”. Answer C is the only choice one can put these silverware. It must be the correct answer since it's the only choice that makes sense.<n><n>"For example, one can't put the silverware in the kitchen when one isn't ready to use them. It will only make sense to one who is still washing silverware and it would be weird to tell one to go put them in the kitchen."<n><n>So the final answer dishes are stored in the kitchen cupboards at times when one is done washing the dishes.<n><n>Input: what was 199 to 169? <n>Output: "the answer is one and nine hundred ninety nine minus 169 ; it = 190"<n><n>So the final Answer is one and nine hundred Ninety nine minus 190 Nineteen hundred and 99<n>#2<n><n>Input: it is impossible for a plane to fly at a 90 degree angle to the ground. this statement is true for planes but not for cars. why not?<n>Output: "plane has a 90 degree to the ground angle but a normal car can take to a 90 degree turn."<n>So the Final Answer the steering wheels of Car or Trucks is in a position to move a vehicle at such an angle.<n><n>Input: you are playing the game "rock paper scissors". which winning strategy should you use? <n>A: always pick one and only one of your choices<n>Output: "this strategy will result in a win only in a rare case. this would be a fair game against any other player.

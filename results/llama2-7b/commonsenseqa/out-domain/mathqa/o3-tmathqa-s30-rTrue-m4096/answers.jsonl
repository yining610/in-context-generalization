{"idx": 903, "text": "Answer: C. If you look at the choices, this one is really straightforward. This is a great way to practice data analysis for both logical understanding and quick mental math. If you want to read more about my strategies for SAT math, check out my article on SAT Data Analysis.\nThe SAT also includes word problems. These require a little patience and logical thinking to solve correctly. Here are a few examples of real SAT word questions and solutions.\nI'm going to assume you've read the passage and already understand it fairly well. I'm going to show you a straightforward method for answering short-answer questions. This is the method I tell my students to use.\nThe first step to answering any multiple choice question is to read the entire question (and pay particular attention to the end). I've bolded the relevant part: a 215 foot wire is used to support a sign. The wire is stretched 7 feet from the sign to a bracket on the wall. The wire is 6 inches longer than that. If the wire does not move, how long is the wire?\nThat little phrase \"If the wire does not move,\" is a clue (and a double-clue, since you could substitute \"not move,\" into the question. \"If the wire does move,\" or \"If the wire does change,\" or \"If the string does move.\" There you've got 4 clues that the wire is fixed.\nThe next step is to work backwards. If the wire is fixed, what do we know? Since we know the wire doesn't move, the distance from the wire to the bracket is 215 - 7 = 208 feet. The remaining length of wire (6\" longer than that) is 216\" - 208\" = 8\".\nStep 3: Solve the equation - or as I like to call it, determine the missing part of the equation.\nHere, we have 208 - 7 = 8.\nSo, you might start by using the equation you know to solve this:\n8 = 208 - x\nx = 208/8\nx = 8336/8\nx =... (you know where I'm going with this)\nx = 8 = 6\nNow, it just took you a bit of math to figure", "answer": "E: floor"}

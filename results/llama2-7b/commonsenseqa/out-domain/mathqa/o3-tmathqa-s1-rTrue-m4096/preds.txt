So his share costing one dollor is equal to $1+0.10$, so he did not paid full as expected and is overpaid.<n>So the final result should be A.<n><n>Input:What kind of shape (circle, square, rectangular or triangular) has a perimeter of less than four inches but whose area is also less than four square inches? answer: a. circular b. square c. square with a round corner d. rectangular<n>Output: The perimeter of a circle is 2πr. If r=2, the perimeter is 4. If the area of the square is 16 sq.in., then length of the side of the square will be sqrt[(perimeter – 4)/4] = 2. Thus the perimeter is 2/2, area of square is 2 sq in.<n>This means that area of a square whose side has √2 =1.41 and sq area is 1.56sq in.<n><n><n>Input : What kind of shape (circle, square or rectangular ) has a perimeter of four inches or more perimeter being less than the area. Answer: a. circular b c. rectangular d. square with a round corner<n>Output :  Perimeter = 4 sq in = 2

A pure monopoly faces few, or no competitors. Therefore, a monopolist has no restrictions on how much quantity they are willing to sell. Therefore, the monopolist will charge a (monopoly) price.In any market, the equilibrium price of a good is determined by the interaction of supply and demand. If supply increases and demand decreases, a (increase) in equilibrium price occurs. If demand increases and supply decreases, equilibrium price decreases. If demand increases and supplies increases, equilibrium price will be unchanged. If supply decreases and demand decreases equilibrium price will decrease.<n><n>* Input: What is the function of business?<n><n>Output: "Businesses do exactly what you think they do, produce goods and services for trade.In order to maximize income or wealth the business should be in the highest value business he/she can.The business makes a decision to provide the highest value for the highest price.

(93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% ) 93% of 93 is 90. 9 is a digit, so it has to repeat itself, if it does, only one of the three 9 has to be a multiple of 3, the rest has to be a remainder. in 99 -> 90+9, 99-90=9. now in 90 only 1 9 of the remaining 8 will be multiple of 3, so answer is 9+9+1 = 19 98% = 19 - 19 * 0.019.<n><n>Output: The first digit of 99 is a 9. So the 3 digit of 3 digit number has to be repeated only once, out of the 3 digit numbers you listed 2 out of 3 are 90, 99, 98 (99+90=189). The rest are divisible by 3.

Choices:  A: jail time B: fear C: going to prison D: nothing E: feeling of guilt<n>Output:		I will choose answer from list  the choices D.<n><n>Answer A does not describe exactly what the feeling of being a murder and knowing that you are not free from it. it does not matter how long jail time is, I do not believe that would change the fear of being murder, because in most places jails will include other murderers and the fear of the consequences of being a murderer is not just jail time. I believe being convicted of murder would result in a lifetime fear of going to prison and never being able to live without fear.<n>Answer B is similar and could also account for feeling of guilt and jail time. I have doubts that the fear of guilt and going to prison would disappear after being committed to jail. I believe the fear of the consequences would be unbearably overwhelming after knowing the fear that you will not be as good as a free man. I do not believe being committed to jail removes or lessens the impact of the feelings mentioned.<n><n>Answer  C is not exactly describing the fear of the consequences. I think for someone who has committed a crime the guilt and fear of being committed to jail for the rest of their life will cause them to be trapped and tortured by the knowledge of guilt and fear. I believe a person having committed a murder will not be able to live their life in fear and guilt of never ending jail for the rest with their crime. They will constantly fear of being caught and their crime will be discovered.<n> Answer D. it gives the description that the experience with the guilt of murder and living with the knowledge will be worse. I believe this answer describes more accurately how the feeling of guilt for the rest of their lives will be overwhelming, even to the point where they will be trapped with their guilty mind and tortured.

Choices: 1 A: 1/6 B: 1/12 C: 1/3 D: 1/5 2 A: 1/7 B: 1/4 C: 1/2 D: 1/3 E: 1/6<n>Output: A is the correct answer. When you roll a pair of fair, non-loaded dice, each individual die has one letter on the surface of that die. Therefore, the probability of an individual die, for any single letter, is 1/6. The probability of any of the six letters showing is 1/6, so the probability of a specific letter showing, given that you roll the dice, is 1/12. In this question, you could choose a letter for each die individually. You could choose a letter for one die. Or you could choose a letter from both dice since the probability of a letter on both dice can be as low as 1/12, or as high as 1/6 * 1/6 which is equal to 1/12 since you can add probabilities the same way that you can add values.<n>The other choices for 1 are incorrect. You could not choose 1 from both dice since their probability of 1 would increase to higher than 1/12 and then you have a higher chance of getting two of the same number, which should not happen in any roll of a pair of non-loaded dice. You could also not choose a 1 if you were rolling a single die since the probability of that is less than 1/16. This is a probability question where you use algebra to solve.<n><n><n>

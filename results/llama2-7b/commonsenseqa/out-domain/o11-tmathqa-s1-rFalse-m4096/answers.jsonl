In this chapter, we focus on how to establish the price of your product and then the cost of your product. Our goal is to illustrate how you can optimize the use of both these prices and the associated costs to meet your business needs.\n\nAs we complete this topic, remember that when it comes to pricing your product, \u201cyou cannot do it all.\u201d You cannot possibly know how much to sell your product for and at the same time determine the cost of the product, in many cases without taking a loss. You must pick the area in which to focus.\n\nFor example, if you have a software product that you are ready to sell, you will need to decide if price or cost is going to be your focus. If it is going to be cost, you need to establish the per unit cost of your product, as the end user price will need to exceed this amount in order for you to make an acceptable margin. To determine the per unit cost, you need to consider all the factors that are included in the cost of your product, including material costs, labor costs, and production costs. If your cost is over $10 per unit, for example, you are going to need a price (and volume) that is well above that to generate an acceptable margin.\n\nOn the other hand, if", "answer": "D: television"}

E\n\n### Commentary:\nAs an application for solving these problems, consider the problem with three choices, where each choice is represented by one of the three choices. Each choice is defined by a string representing a choice, for example, by using the letter a for choice (A) and the letter c for choice (C). You will see this notation for a choice, rather than a literal string such as (A) or (C), since many of the answers are choices (C) from the context of a sentence such as \u201cWhich sentence could be the second of the three choices?\u201d\n\nWe can use string representations of the choices such as the above to determine the output corresponding to each choice in the context of the multiple choice question. Given the choice for the corresponding multiple choice question, we can determine which string representation represents that choice and then use that string representation to produce an output for the given context in which the question is presented. Here is an example showing how we might use a string representation to determine the output for a multiple choice question.", "answer": "B: france"}

If he goes against the 5 km/hr current, he will go 11 km in 2 hrs. \n\nIf the man swam only in the current, he would go 3*11 = 33 km in 6 hrs.\n\nLet the man row for 1hr, and make 33/11 km. \n\nHow far would the man have gone if he had rowed for an hour?\n\nHe would have gone 4km.\n\n11km/6 = 11 /6, 33/(11/6) = 33 * 6\n\nSo 11/6 = 6 /x, we divide both sides by 6, x = 11/6, so 6 / x = 1, 6 / 1 = 6, x = 6.\n\nSo the man can go 1hr in 6km, 6/(4+6) = (2/2)= 1hr, if he can go fast for 5km, he can go slow for 6hours to row to the place the speed ofthe river is 5kmph. So the time taken to reach the 5km speed is1/6 hr which is 20min.\n\nThe overall time taken is 2hr + 20 min.\n\n##### Time taken is 2 hrs & 20 mins\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Sol2:\n\nInput: 21 is what percent of 109? a ) 19, b ) 20, c )", "answer": "A: restaurant"}

I struggled with the \"Instruction:Write a program which reads the temperature, the humididity and the pressure from standard input\" problem and this is because I didn't put the variables in a loop so the program would keep repeating reading the temperature. I struggled writing the function to find the maximum of 5 numbers and the function to find the percentage of a number. There was only one problem that I didn't do well on and that was question 3 (The question was \"find the square root of 25\", in this question I knew that every even number can be added to 25, so I added 25 to itself more times until I reached a value that when you divided that number by 2 you got an answer of 12 and that was the correct answer as it was equal to sqrt(25), I didn't do this because I didn't like to use more complicated calculations for things that could be done in simpler ways. In this assessment there were 3 questions worth 5 marks, one worth 4 marks, one worth 3 marks, and one worth 2 marks, so in total I got 18 marks out of 34 in this assessment and my total mark for the unit is now 70%.\n\n### Solution:\n### 1. \"Write a Python program which reads the temperature in Celcius from standard input and calculates the humididity % and the pressure in millibars\"\n```\nimport math \n\nname = \"\"\nn = int(name[:-1])\nf = float(name[-1])\n\nhumid", "answer": "C: clothing store"}

This means you will first take the binary representation of the number as a string (the same way you would in Python), and then look at the individual digits to make a conclusion. For example, lets take the number 1 with a binary representation of 01. When we look at that number, its clear to see that 1 is not divisible by 2. Therefore we do not have a distinct power of two. The same is true for a number with a binary representation of all 1's, or all 0's. So all we need to do is check each individual digit for a distinct power of two, and repeat that for each iteration of our for loop. Below, write a function that takes in a number input as an integer, and returns whether or not the number has a unique binary representation. The function will be passed a binary representation of a number as a string, and should return either true or false. If we have not checked for all of the possible inputs, we just need to return false. For example, if we check the number 1 with an input of 0, we will obviously see that it has not checked every possible output of 1 with a string binary representation, so we know the answer is false. Here is our list of possible inputs and their binary representations: 1 = 01 2 = 10 4 = 100 8 =1000 16 = 10000 32 = 100100 64 = 101000\nOutput:true\n\nInput: You are given a binary search tree.\nWrite a function that returns true if the node is a leaf, or false if it is not.

Good luck!\n\n##### Question 1: What is 12 percent, of 80 dollars?\n\n##### Output: b ( 12% of 80 dollars) is 9.60 \n\n12%* 80 = 16 (the amount of 12% that we multiply by 80 )\n\n9.60 = 16*.09 ( we divide 16 by 12 since 16 in decimal form is.16 and 0.09 is 9% to get 80/100)\n\n##### Question :2 How do we find the ratio?\n\nHere's an easy way\n\nInput: a: b: x/y.\n\nLet's find a's ratio to b.\n\nratio: a'b / x'y\n\nThe left side of the ratio(a/b) is the variable we will solve for, so substitute a and b with their decimal fractions.\n\nThis is because you are dividing fractions, so you cannot have a decimal in the numerator and a variable in the denominator.\n\nratio = 12/4 = 3\n\nSo ratio a to b is 3\n\n#### Question :3\n\nLet's say price_x = 9200. \n\nLet's look at price per unit.\n\nprice_y = 920(20,00+9200)/(20,0 + 000) = 92\n\nLet's convert these two prices to percent.\n\nx * 100 = 5.2%\n\ny * 100 ( 92 is 9.2%)\n\nNow we should find the total.\n\nLet'n = (x*5.2)+(y*9.2) -> n = 60.4%\n\nSo the answer is 60.4. \n\n#### Question :4\n\nOutput should be a\n\nThe markups on the jacket = 1", "answer": "E: eyes opening"}

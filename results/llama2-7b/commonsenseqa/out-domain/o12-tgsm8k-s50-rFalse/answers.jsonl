If all the popcorn is sold and you have $10.08, how many bags of peanut can you buy?\n#### Answer: \n## Solution:  You can buy (20LB x $1.99)/(20 x $1.9) - (1 x $3.99) = $16 - $3.99 = $12.01 worth of Bags of Peanuts.\n\n### You are walking a road that goes in a straight line.

The width is 15 meters which can be found if we let x = width (distance from center, so we have 6 x width x 15). Then, 6 x width = 90. We don't have enough info to solve for t so we do cross multiplication and find x = 15. Now, width x height = 15 x 6 = 90.

Increasing by that much increases the cost by 25/36 which rounds up to a 25% increase.\n\n### Input\n2.5% of John's salary goes to his 401(k) and 7% of Sam's salary goes into his taxes.  Of the remaining amount, John saves 40% of what he earns for emergencies and invests the remaining amount for retirement while Sam spends 50% of what he has left after paying his bills.  What will the difference in how much money is in each of their accounts be in 10 years?\n\n### Response\nSince, John is putting away 2.5% of his salary, and Samuel is putting 1667x2.5%=John's 401k is $113.89 and Samuel's tax is 7% he can add (113.88*1.7)=$190.54\n\nSo John spends the rest on emergencies and Samuel spends $15.42 on spending.\n\nJohn is investing 8% and Samuel is investing 3/8 of his salary.\n\nso John's is putting away 8%, in Samuel's case it's 667/8 * 8% that's $191.61\n\nWhile John is saving 40% of his remaining income, Samuel is only saving $191.58.\n\nThese amounts will increase with inflation so $10k", "answer": "D: beach"}

He can collect tadpoles, limes, and corn from a nearby stream and grow them in a greenhouse with artificial light. There is an exit into the cave one day after the last full moon. He doesn\u2019t remember a full moon occurring during the time he has been there, but he is confident this is the case. Answer the following questions about this situation.\n\n1. If he can collect and grow enough to eat 100 tadpoles, 50 limes, and 20 ears of corn after four months, how many of each does he need to start with on day 1?\n2. Let X be the number of tadpoles, L be the number of limes, and C be the number of ears of corn. If X - L - C = 0 (in other words, the total number of fish, limes, and ears of corn are the same, but there must be at least one of each), what is the average of X, L, and C?\n3.

{"text": "The correct input from our instruction is \"what are they trying to do\". I assume that \"what\" refers to parents and \"trying\" refers to the verb form of \"do something\" or \"make something\" or the like. Then we would have to analyze the possible choices and see what makes sense in the context of what is expected to occur. For choice A, \"guide\" means to \"lead (someone) in the way to go\", so it seems to be a likely choice to mean what the action is, and for parents it would be in reference to their children. We can't eliminate other choices based on this information, so we consider other choices. \"To vent\" means \"to express\" or \"make known emotion or feelings usually the expression of angry feelings; to let out, give up, or get rid of steam\", so choice E is probably out right away. If trying to do the action requires parents to care, they need a different verb form, like \"do something\" or the like, so choice D is likely out as well. If we choose either choice A or B, it seems to make sense to say we are trying to \"do\" something, which is usually more synonymous with \"make\" or \"do something\" when we use the present tense to describe actions in the future. Choice C and D are too far away from the other choices and if the use of choice B was in reference to choice A, then the word \"understand\" makes perfect sense to be part of choice A as well. So for the input, the choices could be \"to guide\" or \"to understand\", but because the parent yells at their children, choice B is more logical for the action.\n\n### Input:#The weather has an effect on growing crops.

If the cost of the newer bottle was $10 more than the old bottle at the same dinner party 2 years ago, what would the current price of the wine be? How much more is it worth than the bottle 2 years ago?\n\n### ResponseThe cost of the bottle was 100% larger than the price 2 years ago. How much was the 2 year old bottle worth?\n\n#### Explanation:If the current price was $10 more, then the price 2 years was $10 less. Let's say the cost of the bottles each year was $5. The original bottle cost $25 and the new bottle cost $45. Let's say 2 years ago, he bought an old bottle (price of $25) for the same price as the original bottle cost.  \nIf the difference in the original and the new bottle prices is 50% because the original bottle cost twice as much as the new bottle, isn't this true because the new bottle cost twice as expensive as the original bottle?  \nIf the bottle 2 was twice the price as the new bottle (by the way, it's a $500 wine, not a $5 bottle) then isn't the original bottle worth $25?  \nIf you assume that the current bottle cost $50 more than 2 years ago, then you are assuming the current bottle's price is 90% of the original bottle price, which is not the case.", "answer": "E: closet"}

He drinks one bottle every day. He lives on a boat that runs out of water when the bucket is empty. He has 5 buckets. The man refills one bucket every 4 days. What is the maximum amount of time that the man can go without re-filling the bucket?\n\n### Response for the input:\nHe's going to only have one bucket of water left once he uses up only 7/8 of the water in the bucket each day.  His bucket will only have enough to keep him going for 5 days.  \n    \n### Comments on the response:\nVery good!  Here is the reasoning:  You can't figure it out by counting how long until you run out of water.  It is much simpler to figure out how many days you can use 1/2 of a bucket. You want to figure out how long of time you can use 1 bucket.  You have only 5 buckets.  Each day you will use 1/4th of a bucket.  So, after 1 day, you have 4 buckets left.   After 2 days you have 3 buckets left.  If you do 1/3 of a bucket per day, then after 5 days you will have none.   By comparing the above amounts to what you had at each time, you can see if you will have anything left at the certain time.", "answer": "A: drink tea"}

The gift for the first friend has a 1/3 (33%) chance of being one of the two gift choices the gift giver has.  The gift for friend two has a 2/3 (66%) chance of being one that was not used for the previous friend and a 1/3 or 25% of it being the same.  Thus, the total number of possible combinations is 4^2 or 4^2 or (x*x).  X being the number of combinations when the gift giver is choosing the gift for the 1st friend. The 4^2 (4x4) gives the total amount of combinations that the 1st friend has to choose from. x is 25% because it is 1/3, or 1 out of 3 possibilities. So the choice for the 1st friendship is 1/3 x 4^2 which is 4^1 or the gift giver choosing one from 4 x 4 to choose a gift. The other friend is 2/3 which is 2 out of 3 possibilities, the gift giver has 2 choices if they choose to have two different individuals. x is one out of 3 because x is the same as one out of three when it was a gift for the first friendship. (2 is 2/3 x 1/3) is the same as 1(2/3) x.1(1/3).  The sum or total of each of these combinations is 4^1 + 4^2 or x.

Explanation: A. 3 days\n\n### Response A: You play with one friend either a. 24 hours a week on 12-foot line or 24 hours a  week on an 8-footh line. B.  32 hours a week. C. 26 hours a week.\n### How Do I: If you had to explain the answer to A, you could probably break it down this way. (12/24 hours is 2/3 and 8/24 hours is  1/3). A) So, 2/3 of your time is used playing with the friend on a  12-foot ropes, leaving 1/3 of your time that you could play  8-foot rope. (24/3 is 8 and 8/3 is 2) So, 8 hours you play 8-foot ropes and 24 hours 12-foot  ropes.  Explanation: B) With this method, you explain the numbers and the 10-foot and  12-foot ratio. C) With this method, 10-foot rope is 20/36 instead of 20/32. That would make the ratio of 8-9 feet not 2/3, but closer to 3/4.

What is the output of the following code?\n\nif (choice == a+b || choice == a*b|| choice == a==b ||\nchoice == a!=b || \"n\"  || \"yes\")\n\nOutput: The output depends on the choice the user makes.  In Python, a condition has to be truthful or false.  In this case, if true statement is a+b or a*.b or a==b or if the user types in a==b a statement of false appears.\n```\n\tif (choice == a*b || \"n\")\n```\n\nHowever, a number can appear as a conditional statement.  This works well if you are checking if the choice is a+b or if b+a appears in the input data.  This is called boolean values that will cause the true or false statement to be entered into the program.  Boolean values are false or true and are used in computer coding.  To see this in action, add another choice if the user types in any other characters or if true or false is typed.\n```\nif (choice == \"n || \" yes\" || \"n || \"nosomething\"||\n           \"nosomething\")\n```\nOutput: The output is as followed:\n1. If option n is typed in an error message appears.  This is because it is considered a boolean value.\n2. When a*b is typed in, a statement of true appears. This is because * is considered a boolean value and a* is considered a valid integer.\n\nInput/output examples can help your user define what the output is like.

Therefore, the multiple of 9 must be either 2, 6, or 12.  There is no family of size 2 that follows the rule that the numbers are greater than 12.  The size of the family for a family of size 6 would be 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14, so there is only one family of size 14 that follows the rule that all the numbers are greater than or equal to 12.  Finally, families of size 12 are a no-go as there would never be a minimum of 4 children, which is required for the multiple of 8 rule.\n\n### Input:#Today, a cow walked into a bakery.

Average is defined as the average of the total number of characters in a text message divided by the total number of messages received.

{"text": "```A```\n\n### Democratization of the Internet\nThe Internet has been democratized over the last 25 years since its inception and has allowed for a huge increase in access to information.  In just a decade in the 1990's the Internet became more widely available to people that otherwise likely would not have access. This was a result of two events that were both game changing:  1. The invention of the web browser and 2. The invention of ADSL.\n\n#### The invention of the browser\nDuring the early 1990\u2019s the browser was invented by Tim Berners-Lee. He is considered one of the most influential people today because of this invention. The way information was presented in the early 90\u2019s to the general public was different. The browser allowed the user to take away the barrier that previously existed between them and the information they were trying to access. As a result there were many early browsers released that allowed users to access the Internet. The browser also allowed access to information previously only available to people in universities or other technology related areas. The invention of a browser was crucial to the democratization of the Internet.\n\n#### The Invention of ADSL\nADSL was invented by Victor Firot and others working at the Bell Labs in 1988. Prior to this invention, information was transferred at a very low speed. The average transfer speed was around: 1-4 kilobytes per second. This speed was not enough to support what we need for our everyday lives. ADSL allowed the Internet to rapidly spread through households and other areas where we would likely need it.

In this situation it would be best to store them in a shopping mall.

The side length that equates to the area, in this case is 9. So each side is 9/4 of the area, because the number 9 goes into the area twice. So each side is one third of the area. 9 divided by a third of a unit is 9*3, which is 27, and this rounds to 28, which is 28/4, which is 7/2. The perimeter is 2 times the side length, hence 28 times 2 is 56, and again you will have to round down to get the closest estimate to 9.14\"\n### Input: There is a building, inside the building is a square floor and a square ceiling.

{"text": "Answer: Choice A: Nature.\n\nIn this scenario, there is a system of electronic units likely to be used in the nature. The electronic devices used in school include: cameras, projectors, and microphones. The nature is where cameras are used to capture images and videos. The projectors are used to project slides and visual materials in classes. The microphones are used to capture sounds like animal and bird sounds. These electronic devices can also be used to teach other subjects.\n\nFor example, the use of cameras in nature could be used more in teaching biology and nature study. The use of projectors could be used more in science lessons by projecting models of the earth and other objects. The use of microphones could be used to teach other schools in the nature.\n\n### Input\n\n## Output:For the same scenario, choose the most correct answer.\n\n### Response\nIn this scenario, the answer for this answer is Option A: Nature.\nThe electronic devices used in school are cameras, projectors and microphones.\n\nThe use of cameras in a natural setting will capture images and videos to enhance the learning experience. This technology will be used in teaching biology (e.g., taking photographs of living organisms). It will also become an integral part of the education system, particularly for documenting activities in the field.\n\nThe use projectors in teaching science can improve how ideas are presented. The visual element will allow them to understand principles better. It will also allow more natural ways of viewing certain materials where a diagram may be used effectively instead of text alone. They are also able to use presentations made by other schools who use these.\n\nWhen it comes to the use of microphones, these can be used to enhance communication skills and allow students to listen and speak more easily. They could also be used to introduce new ideas rather than just reading off script. They can help students gain confidence in their speaking ability if they are able to take advantage of these technologies.\n\nThese technologies are also valuable tools for communication because they provide opportunities for sharing what has been learned with others outside school environments such as at home or at work. They can also help people understand concepts better by using visual material rather than text alone.\n\nIn short, these new technologies will be used in a wide variety of ways in the teaching process to enhance communication skills", "answer": "C: computer science"}

They all have to leave before 4:30 pm and a carpool is making the trip.  Four of them will be driving, three will need a ride, four will bring something to share. They want to leave by 2:30 pm to make their way to the destination before the day ends. The carpool is only allowed to spend a maximum of 90 minutes taking the trip, arriving at around 3 pm.

I chose to solve this problem by dividing February into equal parts and then determining how many of those days are required to equal an hour.\n> First I calculated the length of February as 59 days. To do this I simply divided the number of seconds in a month by the number of seconds per minute. \n> This gave me an answer of 259200 s, or 59 d, which is my initial answer.\n> Then to account for leap years I added 1 day to my calculation, giving me a new answer of 59.5938 d.\n> Next I divided 59.589 d by 60 minutes and I got.99403332 or.99 days.\n> Then to get the number of minutes I simply multiplied.99 days by 60 minutes. \n\n## Question: Explain how you might create 0.075 x 12.5 hours into an exact number of hours.\n\n### The response\n\nTo find the required time I needed to multiply one hundred twenty-five minutes by the decimal of ten-thousandths that would bring me to exactly 45 minutes. 125 x.075 = 16.875. \nThis is my final answer which is now 45 minutes.\n\n## Instructions: Answer the following short answer question.\n\n## The response:\n\nSince the question involved writing a statement that was the opposite of the one I was given, I chose to use the negation operator.

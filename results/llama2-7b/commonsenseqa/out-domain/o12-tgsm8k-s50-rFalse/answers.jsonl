After much deliberation, the children decided to divide themselves into four groups. The first group picked the number 5, the second picked 10, the third picked 20 and the fourth picked 30. These groups of children then decided to put the numbers back into a container and mixed up the numbers. Next, each child had a go at finding the hidden numbers. They came up with three different methods for selecting each different number. The number that was returned first by any of the children was the one that won the hunt. There were five rounds to the hunt.\n\n1) The first time the group of children that selected the number 20 was told to go first and chose a child to pick a number. The child that randomly chose the number 20 found. The number 5 was chosen by the person whose turn it was, then the child that picked the number 20 had another turn to find the hidden number. If the number 5 again was found, then the child that initially found the number 5 had another go at it, and if the number 5 was found, then the second child that picked the number had another go at finding the number. This process had to keep repeating until a number was found that another child of the group could not find.\n\n2) The second time the group of children selected to give the number 5 a go first for the first round. In each round of selecting a number to find, the two children of the group with the fewest numbers correctly found picked either of the numbers that had not been found by that group to try to find it.\n\n3) The next time the group of children decided to randomly select a child to pick a child from each group to go next, followed by the next child and so on.\n\n4) The next time children who could not find the hidden number went first first. Each child picked a random number. If it was not found, then the child could choose to pick another random number or decide that they did not wish to find the hidden number that group. If the number was not found then one of the numbers from the next group picked in the random order by each group member would be chosen to go next, and then a new person would be randomly selected to go if the number was not found.", "answer": "C: speak information"}

You can only move a piece you own to a square that it can \"legitimately move\" to, meaning that you cannot move the piece onto a square that it cannot see from the place it's at. For instance, you cannot move your rook by moving it to an empty square where it cannot see anything else on its 64 path. You may, however, move a rook to the square with the white king and the white queen, because the rook can move directly, in a single move, to that square.

After the boy asks the father about how to do division, the father explains that you can find the multiplication of your answer by multiplying by a number. He also explains that you can subtract the multiplication of your divided number, and the multiplication of your divided times the result, to find the remainder.For Example: 7338 divided by 741 can be found by the following process:624 x 741 = 45448, from this number the remainder after you subtract is 0. The number 4544 is the new remainder after dividing 7338 by 741. 585 x 2 = 1170, 1170 is the new remainder after taking the remainder 4544 and dividing by 741 - 38 - 4.When the boy asks how long this process would take with a calculator, The father explains that his calculator is much more advanced. He also says, the answer is the same but if you had to do it by hand it would take a day because you would have to write out the multiplication and division each time.But if you did it in your head, you would only have to remember the result, and just keep it in your head.

Choices: A; calculus B: geometry C: algebra D: calculus and geometry E: algebra and geometry\nOutput: A\n \n\n### Instruction:Answer the question given in the input string below.\n\nHow should we teach numbers?\n\n**Answer: Teach them as a collection of digits.**\n\n**Thesis:** Teaching children how to add, subtract and multiply is fine. But that's not enough. We need to understand why. This requires us to rethink how we teach numbers. One way of looking at numbers is the **digit**. But, they're not just the ten numbers 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9. We also have the tens place and ones place and we can count beyond those. **What makes a number a number?**  \n\nLet's say we're just learning about place values. Where do we start? We can start with the tens place, the ones place, with place values that are multiples of ten. Why start with the tens? Why not start with unit digits? It's easier to relate to a unit digit. 230 is one digit different from 220. And it is much easier then to learn than 380. That's why we start with the ones place. If we only start with that then we're making the same mistake. Once you start learning place values it seems to make sense to start with the tens place and the ones place, but it doesn't **have** to be that way. The way that you think about numbers from place values all the way to division and fractions can go **either** way. Some people think of numbers as made of tens and units but you can also go the other way.  \n\nIn teaching we can have kids count the number of times they can group a unit digit by tens, then ones, and maybe do that even more through ones, tens and hundreds. This helps to **not** depend on the unit digit. We can count in groups, in multiples of tens instead of by tens and ones.", "answer": "D: elderly person"}

The second person then makes another guess by subtracting the first guess. Then the first person reveals, for the third time, \nthe actual weight of the flour.

How many perfect circles of 30 foot radius can be drawn by the bees in the cage?\nOutput: 8\n\nTo solve this, let's look at the figure below.\n\nLet `b` be the number of bees in the cages; b = 50, so we would say that there are b bees in the circle.\n\nNext, we would want to think of the angle of a circle and bees around the edge.\n\nEach bee is 30 degrees of the angle that creates the circle.\n\nTo calculate b:\n\n`b = 50 x (pi / 180) = 25 x (pi / 2) / 180 = 12.5`\n\nSo now b = 12.\n\nLet the length of the circle be S:\n\n`S = 30\u03c0 / 60`\n\n`S = (b - 1) x (3\u03c0 / 60)`\n\n`S = ((75 - 1) x 3) / 60 = 217/60`\n\nS = 36.5\n\nLet `P` be any point on the circle. So P = 36.\n\nNow we create our first \"b\" circle (blue in the diagram):\n\nTo draw the next b circles, you can either divide the circumference in half (`P`) or you can multiply by the radius (`S`).\n\nThe first blue circle was 36, the next 72, the next 108, the next 144, and the final one 180.\n\nThis gives us our answer:\n\n36 + 72 + 108 + 144 + 180 =  650\n\nSo the next time you have an arithmetic question, remember to look for all of the potential solutions.\n\n\n#### Answer Summary\n\nYou can use multiple combinations to find the total for an equation.", "answer": "C: curry"}

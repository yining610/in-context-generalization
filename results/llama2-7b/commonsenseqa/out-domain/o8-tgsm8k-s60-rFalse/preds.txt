Shannon did 1/6 of the project herself. Vanessa also contributed to the project. If Vanessa, Lily, and Sarah did 2/3, 1/5, and 1/4 of the project, respectively, then Shannon helped Lily 4 times, helped Sarah 1/2 as much as Lily, and helped Vanessa 133 times.

Then you add 60, 60, 100 and 45 you get 251 and you got 251 + 64 you get 315 but that's wrong so you have to add in 48, 15, and 15 you got 78. So 64 + 78, 141, and 255 and 61 and 115 you get 407, and 92, 17, and 17  you get 122, and 79, 132 and 205 you get 410 and 116, 143, and 147 you get 446  and 8, 10, and 46 and that's about all of them then 344 and 87, and 1

Choices:  A: making love B: feel good C: happyness D: wonderful thing E: cloud judgment<n><n>### Response:		E<n><n>The answer is D as defined in OED, where we see that it is one’s cloudy judgment that is a “wonderful thing” in sex, making it a wonderful thing in the sense of being both wonderful and cloudy. It is not a “wonderful” thing as used in the context of an adjective with the meaning “pleasing or delightful”. Such a meaning of wonderful would be ungrammatical, given that wonderful only takes an object before the base form of a verb. The response “a” is a false match because it does not describe that the object of wonderful is something that is pleasing or delightful. It only describes that the subject is something that is pleasurable or delightful. Likewise, answers “C” and “E” are false matches. “B” is a misspelling of beautiful.

Choices:  A: strongwoman B: cake C: regular D: weak E: fragile<n><n>### Response:		<n>A<n><n>### Instructions:<n>Choose how to respond.<n>1. Choose the option that correctly completes the request, and do not respond to the other choices.<n>2. Explain your reasoning.<n><n>### Example Response 1<n>A laxative that will help you keep B bowel movements.<n><n>1. A. I choose A because it completes the request and explains my reasoning.<n>2. The answer is A.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>When I think of a laxative, I think of something to help bowel movements be easier and more regular. "Keep" means you keep the bowel movements. To keep something means to keep it from being replaced by another. A can be replaced by B, C, D, or E. A is the closest correct answer to my thinking of a laxative.<n><n>2. The answer to this question is A.<n>A strong laxative is a bowel movement that should only happen once a week and should be very soft, so that the blood will get from your body faster. The question is asking how many times a week should they have bowel movements. Weak can be replaced by strong, so A is the least likely answer.<n><n>### Question:<n>This question has four choices. Choose the option with the correct response. Then, post your answer as a comment.<n>

Choices:  A: toy store B: bar C: casino D: table E: family room<n><n>### Response:		I was playing at A with my three mates.<n>### The solution we will use is the "Which one of the following..." approach. You should be familiar with this type of question from school.<n>### What makes this approach work is that the question-writer supplies the information to answer the question, but in an unusual manner.<n>### If we analyze this approach, the question becomes a game of "True or False." We are told that Leila has 2x the number of viewers as Voltaire, and we are told we don't know if they earn x, so Voltaire will earn x/2 and Leila double that.<n>### The information says, "Per week," which means 52 weeks per year. Now, we know that x/2 * 52 = 260/2, so if Voltaire gets x/2 he will earn $130. That means Leila will earn $350 if she earns $x per week. It would be best to answer with two sentences as the solution will allow:<n>### (1) Voltaire earns $130 per week, and<n>### (2) Leila earns $350 per week.<n>### It's that simple.<n><n>### The solution:<n>### I have a job interview tomorrow.<n>### The interviewer will ask me this question:"What makes a good teacher?"<n>### I will say:"If a teacher has patience, a kind heart, and loves to see her students learn and understand new topics, then she is probably a great teacher."<n>### I hope my answer will be the answer of the job interviewer.<n>### The best candidate for the job should have these qualities:<n>### (A)patience (B)kindness (C)understanding (D)love(E)patient(F)understanding(G)kind (H)all of these

Choices:  A: botanic garden B: flower garden C: backyard D: supermarket E: outdoors<n><n>### Response:		E<n><n>### Explain:It is a good question, as roses are famous for their colourful blossoms that come in different colours. The question then aims to test the respondent's knowledge on where to find unusual varieties of these roses. Hence, choice D is wrong because it indicates a supermarket, where it would be unlikely to find such varieties. Likewise, answer choices A and C are wrong as botanic gardens are botanical gardens, and they contain all sorts of plants. Flowers are plants, but they're not botanical, and this is the purpose of flower gardens. Choice B would suggest places other than rose gardens. Answer choice E is correct as 'outdoors' refers to the outside, and since roses are plants, they will grow outdoors.<n><n>### Exercise:How many gallons of oil does a 1999 Ford Expedition hold?<n><n>```javascript<n>2 rows 8 cols<n>[["gallons","1999","ford"]<n>,["expedition"]]<n>```<n><n>### Instructions:Add an answer for the "outside" to the table in the exercise above.<n><n>### Response<n><n><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SirDentZilla/Mathematics/main/files/instruction1.jpg><n><n>### Explanation<n><n><img src="https://raw.github.com/SirFunkyD/Mathematics/master/files/exercise.jpg"><n><n>### Instruct:Enter the correct number of gallons of oil for the given "outside".<n><n><img src><n><n>### Response <n><n>4.6<n><n>### Instuct:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n><n>## Demonstration<n><n><img source><n><n>### Instrutction:Answer the following true-false question.<n><n>## Exercise<n><n>```javascript<n>3 rows 3 cols<n>[["true","false"]<n>,["question"]]<n>```<n>```javascript<n>3 cols 2 rows<n>[["question","answer"]<n>,["question2"]]<n>```<n>

Choices:  A: necklace B: wall outlet fixture C: tool box D: computer E: motorcycle<n><n>### Response:		**Answer: E**<n><n>### Input<n><n>Input:In a classroom, there were 12 more chairs than tables. The chairs were 1/3 as many as the number of boys in the class. There were 40 more desks than chairs; if the number of desks was twice the number of girls in the class, how many desks were there?<n><n>### Solution<n><n>(12 × (12 + 40) - 40) ÷ 3 = (172848.25 - 40) /3 = 172844.0875 ≈ 1728637.5 / 3 = 579883 ≈ 579890<n><n>### Explanation<n>First, we subtract one from the number of desks. Then we subtract another to get the answer.<n><n>### Input  <n>Input: 45.759394 feet of wire were wrapped in the shape of a circle with 139 turns. If the diameter of the circle was 14.269373 meters and the radius was 7.464142 meters, what was the thickness of the wire in centimeters?<n><n>### Solve<n><n>First, we subtract<n><n>Next, we use the formula for the Area of a Circle [A=πr^2], which leads to the following in the case of the given problem:<n>Pi = 3.1416, r is the radius of the circle which has area π r². Here r = 7.46, so π r² = 50.573221 cm²<n><n>Since 45.769394 feet is equal to 14.063383 yards, we use the following to find cm: 45.6 square feet ÷ 0.09144 square yards = 500.4949494 sq cm<n><n>

If I work without the calculator I have time too it takes me to get it right. This is only because when you work with the calculator all you have is the time that you have been given and your answer so the next time you have to answer in the same way.<n><n>### Feel free to provide any comments on general learning in our class session that you feel are important.<n><n>* General Comments<n>	* I think this class was easy for me to learn.

Choices:  A: shopping cart B: cashier C: shopping mall D: supermarket E: bookstore<n><n>### Response:		<n>A<n><n>### Explain:<n>The correct answer to the above question is a cashier, but it was given as a supermarket.<n><n>### Validate and explain:<n><n><n>### Input(s) and Output:<n>Input: There are four times as many girls on the basketball team as on the football team. On each team 1/5 of the members are starters. The number of girls on the basketball team is 70 less than the number of boys on the team. How many girls are on the soccer team?<n>Output: 145<n><n>### Validation:<n>Correct! This output is correct because 6 girls on the basketball team are starters. Then, there are 4 times as many girls on a team as are on a football team (4 * 6 = 24), and 70 girls are on the basketball team, leaving (24 - 70) = 5 * 1 = 5 remaining starter girls. Then, 5 of 8 = 5/8 = 62.5%. There are 8 girls on the football team, so 62.5% of them are starters. Therefore, there are 6 girls starters on the football team. Next, 6 * 1/5 = 32 is 32 girls starters on the basketball team. 70 - (5 * 1) - (32 * 1) = 4 * 6, which is twice as many girls as boys. 4 * 6 = two times, or 12 more than the starters on the basketball. 4 * 12 = 48. 70 - 48 = 22 girls are on the soccet team.<n><n>### What could be done to improve the validation?<n><n>I will consider the first step in the logic of the student: the student states that there are 4 times times as many girls on each team than each team; then, we can see what value is given for each team. (I will use * to represent the multiplication operator: * is shaped like the character *.) The first step is simply to write, Girls*Girls + Girls*Boys = Girls+Girls (or g * g + g * b = g + g). I could then solve the first term by subtracting

Alan has more stamps than Betty and Chris has the smallest number. Chris has 8 stamps fewer than half the number of stamps that Alan has. If Alan has 69 stamps, how many stamps does Betty have?<n><n><n><n>### Response<n><n>B:<n><n>Answer:Betty has 21<n><n>The number of stamps of Betty are greater than Chris that is 69. The number of Chris's stamps is half of the number of stamps of Alan that is 21. Half of 69 is 34.5. Subtract the number of Chris's Stamps from 34.5 you will get 69-34.5=34.5. Now, half of 34.5 is 17.25. Subtract that from 69 which is equal to 21.

Choices:  A: lungs and diaphram B: oxygen C: abdominal muscles D: air E: open throat<n><n>### Response:		<n>We know that humans take in oxygen through their lungs and diaphragm.

There is the lungs that take in the air and the diaphragm.<n><n>Diaphragm:  The diaphragm is a sheet of muscle that moves up and down between the stomach cavity and the chest cavity. The diaphragm contracts to expand the stomach cavities, thereby increasing the amount of air that can be taken in during breathing.<n><n>![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dgf3c30g/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/v1535710664/diaphragm-1-lngwf6.png)<n><n>Lung:  The lungs are a pair of spongy, air-filled sacs in the chest cavity that extract oxygen from inhaled air, and expel carbon dioxide.

I just added 7 more bars onto the right side with 7 little bars on the left hand side which is where the number of bars is at because of the little bars I put on the bars from the 8 box, then the one on top is the 16 bars and the one on the bottom is the 18 bars.<n><n>### Example 2<n>The question gives me the number of people who want to meet me on 3:00 PM, and the number of people have dinner on 5:00 PM.

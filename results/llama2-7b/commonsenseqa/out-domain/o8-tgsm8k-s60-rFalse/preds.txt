For example, we cannot divide 2 by -3 because division is always done by taking the reciprocal, which in this case is 6/3. A subtrahend is a number or quantity from which something else is subtracted; a minuend is the number or quantity from which a subtraction is performed. As an example, we have the following subtraction: 7 - 40 = - 33. In this case, we have a minuend of 7 and a subtrahend of 40. The 33 obtained refers to the subtraction.<n><n>Addition: We often find that the sum of two numbers can be obtained, but not all the time or in any situation. Given two numbers, the sum may be found if and only if the addition of two numbers is defined. For example, to find the sum of 3 and 4 we simply add an additive notation of (3+4). The same is true when 5 and 4 are added. To find the sum of 17 + 22, to find the sum, we first have to perform the addition of all the digits of 17 and 22, and then obtain a product of that sum: 17+22 = 55, which is a product of

Choices:  A: living room B: dog park C: basket D: small apartment E: big house<n>Output:		D<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>The question here is very tough to understand, let talk about a way of doing this without calculating any things, you've to first find the maximum number of cards in the hands of those 3 person, Janet 21 cards, Brenda 29 cards, Mara 27 cards, when they have same number of cards as they have no idea if more is better or if less is best the question don't clearly asks what they have in total and in which form, this a very good example of how to solve a question with no data so far, we don't know if Janet or Brenda or if both are better than the 3 together, or if Mara is the only one who can make the difference.<n><n>Let's take first what we knows, the only thing we know is that Janet has a total number of 10 more cards than brenda, so we can sum the cards, we get that Brenda has a total of 21 more cards than Janet, which is total 40 more than 64.<n><n>Now taking second case, here we get that Mara has twice as Mara as Janet has, which is total 26 more than 64, and that's all we can know about numbers of cards that brenda and Mara have, total card number we know can also take as initial number because here in our case in first step we know total number of cards so we don't have to keep calculating the total number of cards as we will be having that number for all the steps to come.<n><n>Now coming to the final number of cards that Janet, Mara and Brenda have in a total. We know that Janet has 21 more than Brenda and 26 more than Mara. So now lets calculate the total number of cards.<n><n>Their number of card we have to add to the initial number of cards that is 62.<n><n>So finally the total number of cards from the two cases (if Janet's number of cards is smaller than her's then we sum those cards with initial number otherwise we just sum the initial number with additional number of cards)<n><n>So the second part of the question is to choose between having 20 and 40 blocks that pete has walked<n><n>Again initial number we can use as 21 since

NGC 4414<n>Answer: 4<n>In 2004, astronomers discovered a galaxy 10 billion light years from Earth. It is now known to be one of the most massive galaxies in the Universe, more massive than the Milky Way.<n>A: M33 B: NGC 2844 C: NGC 922 D: NGC 4415 E: NGC 4438<n><n>It is commonly accepted that galaxies formed in the early universe. It is assumed that galaxies formed as dense concentrations of gas cooled and collapsed under the pull of gravity. It is believed that small proto-galaxies merged to form massive galaxies, like the Milky Way. For many years, that's what everyone thought happened. But there were a few problems with this paradigm.<n><n>One problem was that the Universe wasn't big enough: the Universe was thought to be about 10 billion light-years from edge to edge. Such a small Universe would not allow enough time for a significant number of galaxy mergers.<n>A large primordial galaxy would be hard to explain if we did not take the Big Bang itself into account. In a Universe that is 10 billion years old, very few significant mergers would take place, but in a Universe with a 14 billion year history, the amount of merging possible is significantly higher.<n><n>NGC 4414, a massive primordial galaxy at z = 2.9, is located near the North Celestial Pole. NGC 4431.7 lies 3.4 degrees south of 12 hours to the south. NGC 4459 is located in the constellation Corvus and is the largest known primal galaxy in the CSF survey to date.<n><n><n>Input:The temperature at which water becomes ice, called the freezing point, is equal to the boiling point at 4 degrees Celsius.<n><n>You are told that the freezing point of water<n>is 9 degrees Celsius.

Assign values to individual item of the array as 0 or 1. This way, we can iterate through the list of array. We can do this by two ways.

In this question, 40 - 150 = -110. Then, Janet has 9 more than Brenda, so she has x - 89. Finally, Mara has twice as much as Janet, thus she starts with x / 2, and her answer is 211.<n><n><n>### Solutuon 2<n>In this question, pete will travel x blocks, and x + 5 represents his distance. Thus the given expression is x - 5.<n><n><n>## Solution 3<n>If the green chairs are 1/3 as much as the blue chairs then the blue chair is x.

Choices:  A: confusion B: complications C: riot D: arrest E: protests<n>Output:		C (correct answer)<n><n><n>### Problem 1:How do you get the correct answer?<n><n>I am trying to check a wrong answer, I tried using the program to correct wrong answers. After typing the wrong answers as answers, the program shows the correct ones as correct answers.<n><n>### Problem2:How do you solve this?<n><n>Inorder to solve this,we have to use the first two variables which are the variables for the numbers of cards.<n>Hence from the first question;<n>Janet has 9 cards + Brenda has 54, therefore the total number of cards Brenda and janet have is 63 + 54 = 117. So the extra cards must be 117 - 50 which is 67. So the sum must be 111.<n><n>Similarly in the second questions: we can see that in the second question the information we have is that; pete walked 5 blocks, 20 blocks, back the same way.<n>So, after going back home, he only covered 50 blocks, so the actual number of block pete traved in all is 50.<n><n>In the third question : the information we have is the number of chairs.<n>We then see that: The green chairs are about 10x the blue.<n>So, the total number of green chair is about 10x 10.<n>Now if we assume the total number of chairs is a, then we have 13 of the total number of blue chair - 3 chairs of blue chair + 13 of the green chairs.<n><n>We can now rewrite that as 10a - 3a + 10 + 13.<n>So using the equation, we can find that the total number of chair is 20.<n><n>Similarily, in the fourth question, the equation is 140 + 140 = 280. Therefore, the equation is 33 * k, k is 280.<n><n>In order to solve the fifth question, we can see that Alannah has 60 less books that Beatrix,and queen has about 5 * times more books than Alanna.<n>Using the equation (60-5t), the total of all the books is 40+5

The catalog lists the price of the article in figures followed by a period, then its price again in words. Example: "8.--$3.98" means that this item is priced at $3.98. In other words, $1.00 is the second digit. If, instead of $3.98, we see "3--98", that means that $2.97 is the second digit. Let's say that we see this notation for 17 of the prices. One day a sale starts. The sale allows us to multiply our discount by the price. Each of the 17 articles has a different discount. For example, we know that the 11th article will cost us $10.63. At the same time, the 5-item sale applies to the 10th article only. We know that it will cost us $2.20. This means that the 11 item is the last item to be sold at half price. Find the number of items that are still left.<n>Output: 6.5

For both cases, I used the following logic (in Python):<n><n>```python<n>if case == 'div': #division<n>    return sum(x%a for x in [s**2,a**2,b]) // this is not the fastest way to handle division by modulo (%a)<n>else: # multiplication<n>    return sum(a for e in x for e in a)<n>```<n><n>Since this is an interview question, the interviewer was unlikely to be able to check if this logic was correct, but it is.<n><n>I was able to get all the test cases correct from the interview test case. The only catch is that this only applies when the interviewer asks for an answer as 1 decimal place. Otherwise, I will not get the correct answer, since I round up the floats. If an interviewer asked for an answer as `8 * 7 // 7`, for example, I'd get `11`, instead of `10.7`.<n><n>An alternate solution would be to use [`np.mathmod`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.1/reference/generated/numpy.mathmod.html) and [`np.round`](http://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html?highlight=round#round) functions, but because those are NumPy functions, not many engineers are likely to know about them when applying for jobs, and they may not be in the language you use most of the time.<n><n>### Discussion:<n><n>For those of you who answered these problems, what about the division question surprised you? What about the multiplication one? How would it change if you were not allowed

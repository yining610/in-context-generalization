In order to figure out if the window is opaque or transparent, one must first see the shadows of the sun and figure out that sunshine is on the same side as the shadow.  After this, one can only tell where the shine is coming from by looking at the outside of the window, and realizing how much light is on the outside.  If the window is transparent, and sunlight is coming from behind the window, then there will be more light on the outside. A cloudy day would look like one side of the window is made out of clouds (or snow), and this would make the window a bit less transparent.  Finally, it can almost never be certain that the window is completely transparent.  A piece of snow (or cloud) could simply partially cover one\u2019s view, causing light to look like it is from behind the window.  Even if the light from the other side of the room is brighter than what one usually sees, it may not be from behind the window (if there is something covering the entire top half of your eyes at that moment, the other side may look like it is brighter, even if it is not.)\n\n### Instructor\u2019s Answer\nThe light will be on the opposite side of the room, since the shadows are outside.  Therefore, the window must be transparent.  In this case the sun must be in front of the room, since there is more light outside. If light was coming from behind, then the amount of light outside would be about the same as it is inside.\n\n#### Student Response\nThank-you for your answer! It would be beneficial if you included a picture. This way we can all see the light being in the front, as you stated. Although", "answer": "A: tree tops"}

There is also another factor to consider.\n\nHire a web developer is it important or not. I will find out by asking myself. So the result will be 680.

{"text": "D\n1. Janet has 128, so that gives us 130 for Brenda. 131- 128=3. 130-3=127. so we have to add 1 more to get 128. \n2. Janet has 9+ 3 =12. 12+3=15. Multiplying by 2 we get a total of 30 cards for Janet. 30+15=45, 45-40=5, this gives us 5+ 20 which equals 25...\n3. We only have to subtract this once which gives us 5. Janet will have 29 cards, Brenda will have 128-5=123 and Mara will have 20x2 =40. Total we have is 40+29+123=211. This is the correct answer.\n4. I have decided that I will write the steps using a tree diagram, which will include Janet as our root, Brenda with 9, Mara with twice as many, Janet- Mara which would be 21 and 40-21=19.  This will get us to Janet. 128 is the end. \n5. I have also written the steps in order to complete the task. \nI chose the answer. The only reason this answer D wasn't 41 is because the question is not specific and could have been either 3 or 41, but for the question, D was the closest to the question in number sequence.\n\n### Extension Question\n\nWhat if Brenda gets left with 11 cards and Mara gets left with 38. Is the answer the same as Janet has 11+3 = 14 so that is 40% of the answer which is 14x 2 = 28, so this gives mara 38- 28= 10 and Janet 11-10= 2. So the answer would be 29, which would also be the correct answer because it is 30% of the total amount of cards? Brenda and Janet would have 32 which equals half of the", "answer": "D: rose garden"}

We don't want to make it sound like a mistake; so we use the correct form of \"careful.\" Because we are describing how the person acted, the correct word is \"carefully.\" This is an adverbial phrase.\n\n### Input (3):\n\n> **Use form \"should\" in the correct verb** You should always be honest.\n\n### Output:\n\"should\" is a modal auxiliary verb. In the above sentence it isn't acting as a subordinating conjunction or a helping verb. Since \"you\" is a subject that is already performing the action, no helping verb is needed. So to answer this question, use the correct form of the modal auxiliary verb \"should\"\n\n### Exercorer:Input:\n> **Use form'should' in the sentence** We should respect all forms of life.\n\n### Response\nYou're correct.\n\n### Requirements:\nThere is no requirement\n\n### Marking\nIf you answer three questions correctly, you will get a star.\n\n### Resources:\n[Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_sentence_structure)", "answer": "A: conquer opponent"}

{"text": "*In the above problem, I will make use of both addition and subtraction to arrive at an answer. First of all, I will apply subtraction to solve the card problem because the numbers of cards involved are 2, 4 and 9. It is evident that 7 cards will cover the 2 and 4. It follows that Mara has 7 less than 163 and 9 more than Brenda. After the application of the above mentioned 2 numbers, I will be left with only 1 card, which makes the total of the 3 cards as 9. In a similar manner, Mara will have 9 cards less than 160, which is equivalent to 151. We will subtract 151 from 160, we will be left with only Brenda. In this scenario, 4 cards will be the missing number in the problem which is 154. The reason it is 4 is because 4 cards are more than 146. I will be able to come up with the answer because 4 is one of the solutions to the problem. I will arrive at the answer of 9.\n*A prisoner has a history of spending 8 years in prison. After that particular period, he goes through a process of getting out of prison. After going through the process, he has a hard time reintegrating to society. He has to face the challenges that may be posed by the community after leaving prison. The hardest thing that a prisoner has to face when he is freed is the situation when people stop believing in him. Many people avoid him, others discriminate him, which makes it more difficult for him to reintegrate to society. When he has to spend the next 8 years, it also becomes difficult for him to survive in these conditions. He may also encounter trouble trying to get a job. The prisoner may find it more difficult than a normal person in his situation. He is left with the option of not engaging in criminal activities. According to him, he may become a better person if he works hard and he will be responsible the next time he has to commit crimes.

{"text": "There are so many different pudding varieties available today that picking just one can be a challenge.\n\n### Input:\"How much cheaper is it to buy by the dozen\"?\n### Response:\n\nThe dozen rule in North America means there are 12 in a dozen. The number doesn't seem quite as large as it was when I was a kid. When I was a kid, \"there were eleven\" was an expression people used, even though there was still a dozen eggs in a dozen. If one was selling something, the trick to fool the customer into thinking they weren't getting a great deal was to use the \"dozen\" to count the 12, but not the 13.\n\nThe customer might see a dozen eggs for $2 but they expect to pay 12 x $1, or $12. If asked, the person selling them would say \"you can get 12 for $4\", not mentioning that it was really 13 for $2.

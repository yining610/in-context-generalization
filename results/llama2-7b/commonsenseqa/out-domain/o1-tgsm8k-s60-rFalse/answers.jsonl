All of them left apples in the bag How many apples were in the bag now?\nOutput:9\n\nInput:1 and 1 are greater than 1/2\nOutput:False\n\nInput: How many numbers in between 1 and 4 are prime (i.e., only 2 and 3)\nOutput: 2 and 3\n\n#### Explanation:First question is an easy one. It's about subtraction. As Janet has 9 more cards than Brenda, and Mara has 2 times cards as Brenda, Janet and Mara have 12 cards more than Brenda, that is, they have 47 cards. Then, Mara has 4 times the cards than Janet, so she has 4 times 47 = 188 cards. So, Mara has 150-188 = -38 cards and Janet has 47 +-38 = 19 cards. So they have 9+19=28 cards. So, the answer is 28.\n\nSecond question is an easy one, as well, it just requires to take the letters in the sentence and use their initials. The second letter is the initial for fox, the third letter initial is the initial from water and house (a vowel followed by another vowel) and the fifth letter is the initials for california. So, the sentence means fox was sitting in a California hen house (well, california has 11 letters, not 6) searching for water, when he was thirsty.\n\nThe third one is just about comparing the fruits which were mentioned. \nthe fourth one has a hidden word, to help it, you can use substitution method, and answer will be obtained.\nfor example,\nfirst, replace \"two\" for \"1\"\nand second, replace \"1\" with \"two\", and so on.\nyou can use another letter like \"d\" or \"f\" if the word is very long\nand the answer will be \"1 and 1", "answer": "C: california"}

{"text": "C\n\n---\n\n### Explanation:\n\nIn problem 2, If each persons has *9* cards more than Brenda then Janet had 67cards. However, Mara had only *9*cards less than *150*, which is 141. So *9*cards must be subtracted from *150*, but *141* and *150* can not be subtracted in the same time. *141-9=132*, then *132-9* equals to *123*. So we have *211*cards in all.\n\nIn problem 3, If each person has *9* more cards than Brenda then the answer, Brenda had *37*. Mara twice had *37*cards. However, Maras also had *9*cards less, means *47* cards. Since *47* minus *9* equals *38* and Mara had *2* cards more than Brendas than each person would have *106*cards altogether.", "answer": "A: sun himself"}

I only have 7 dollars left now. How much did I get originally?\nOutput: 94.75\n<br>\n<br>\n### Explanation:<br>\n\nWhen we first look at the instruction, we start with our head. We think to ourselves \"Let's focus on the first question. I can't do the second question.\" So we work on the first question. The first question looks like a lot, so we start from the bottom. <br>\n\"What's the number? Do I know that? How can I solve for that number?\" <br>\nLooking closer at the problem, the answer looks to be less than 151, since Mara has 43 fewer than 151. I'm going to call the number X.<br>\nBecause Janet has 9 more than that number. <br>\nSo how do I solve this problem? Well I will make a table. The values to use are Janet, Brenda, Mara, X...<br>\nAnd then the final question is how many do they have in all? <br>\nI put < 151. <br>\nAnd I do this because no one knows that answer and no one wants to just guess.<br>\nSo to make sure the answer is correct I will use the other question as my first answer. <br>\nJanet is the closest we know, so I will use her. Janet is 70. <br>\nThe answers are in columns, so I will just look at the columns to go down.<br>\nBrenda is next, and so I do this, and look at the columns...<br>\nI am now seeing an obvious pattern. Each answer is +/- 8, so there is a perfect 8 for each answer. <br> <br>\n\"How many is 8 away from 50.\" <br>\n\"8 away from 58.\" <br>\nThen I see we do it again. <", "answer": "D: wildlife refuge"}

If one of them is an artifact and the other one\nis not, then I can distinguish them. In particular, let me denote the artifact as the one that I see first. This one can be found by setting the left hand side to be 9, which is the number of cards we know about Janet and the right hand side to be 150 which is the number of Brenda and Mara. Then, for the difference, I will need to set the left hand side to the number of cards that\nBrenda has. And then set the right hand side to the number that Mara have. In order for these two values to be the same, I will need to increase by my number of cards.\nThis method will work for any number of people who have more than one card. This method also applies to a case where the person cannot afford the increase of 1.\n\nFor the other half, it is a different case because I have both artifacts. By comparing with both cards, it is very clear that this card is not like that one.\nBy using these observations, I am able to decide which of two cards is an artifact and the rest is non-artifacts.", "answer": "C: thinking"}

{"text": "D\n\n\n\n### Explanation:\nLet's count the number of total possible numbers of cards. There are 52 cards. So we need the 52-1= 51-1= 50 ways to write a number from 50 -> 99. \nAnd we need 9->4 ways to write 9.\n\nTotal ways = 51*4=204\n\nNow the question ask us to multiply the number ways that mara has 40 - 150 cards. So Mara has 110 cards and the question say 211, so the number of ways = (110-11) * 204 = 180\n\n\n\n## 24. You are at the racetrack, and you have $6 to spend. You have a $100 horse, a 50/1 chance to win. You have a 20/1 horse, a 40/1 chance to do well.You have a 10/1 horse, which you like but which is only a 5/1 chance for the win. You have 10 other horses but do not know anymore about them. Which horse would you bet on?\n\n---\n\n## Solution:\nFirst, let's look at the $100 horse.There for sure only 1 way to get $100 back from betting 1 dollar on this race, even the race don't have any return, we get $1 back.\nAnd the race have chance to return the profit if it is greater than 100, otherwise all of us lost money.So we need the sum of possible winning number of this race so we need (1+100)/101 = 0.05.\n\nNow we look at the question.How likely is someone bet on the 10/1 Horse?This horse have 5/1 chance to win. Let's calculate this 5.\n\n\n\n10 times we get $5 back. So the chance for 5 times is 1/10 and the chance for the remaining 6 times we lost the money.So the chance to get back this horse's money is : 6/10.\n\n### Examples:Input:There are", "answer": "A: new experiences"}

We need to take these input strings and then translate them into numbers. Then we need to figure out a way to multiply them all together without using * or / to solve the problem.\n### Explanation: This was a very challenging instruction because there was no explicit information as to what it wanted us to do. However, there were a lot of patterns (or repeated behaviors) that I could use to start figuring out the instructions with a \"trial and error\" method.\n\nFor example, after doing each of their procedures I would print and check my output numbers to make sure that they were correct. For the first test, Janet had 9 more cars, Brenda had twice as many cards, so 18, and Mara had 40 cards less, so 90. I realized that the instructions were comparing and subtracting the numbers of each person, and so I knew that the result would be what they did not have (ie the negative).

After checking so many times whether or not 150 - (40 if the previous element was 110) is true enough times, then the list gets decremented.\n\n```python\nfrom functools import reduce\n\ndef solve(input_list):\n  is_true = False\n  while not is_true:\n    num = input_list.pop()\n    if num == 150:\n      is_true = True\n    if num > 150:  # input_list.pop returns the first element, this condition is checking to make sure that no more cards are given\n      num -= 1\n  if is_true:\n      return True\n  return False\n```\n\n#### Part 1: Answer the following multiple choice question\nSolve the following multi choice question using the code below (this question was about checking if a value was larger than another value.

{"text": "A.\n\nInput: There was once, long ago, an orphan boy whose name was Peter and who made his home with an old couple who had neither child nor relative with whom they could leave their little fortune when they died. Peter took care of the house and the garden. Their little garden was not large, but its flowers were well cared for. They lay in flower beds, and in large pots, and were surrounded by a stone wall. But in one corner there was a plot of ground, and out of it grew but one bush of common herbs.\n\n\nOne evening, just before winter, when Peter was cutting and gathering herbs for the master and mistress, and bringing in their wood, the old folks said to the boy: \"What shall we give you instead of money for all the work you have done for us?\" Peter knew very well they were poor and would find it hard to afford him anything. Nevertheless, he thought they could not leave him destitute, and he answered: \"I should like such a stick of wood as comes from the corner where the ground is planted only with herbs.\"\n\nThen, the old people told Peter they would give him what he had asked for. The next day he went into the garden and chose for himself a stick of wood, one that was big enough for him to sit down upon. There he sat, and began to watch the little bush of common herbs growing by the corner of the garden, and before the month was over the bush had grown a lot and produced pretty rose-colored flowers.\n\nPeter became fond of this herb, which he called a \"Love-Lily.\" Every morning he arose before the others\nand came to the garden; he gathered branches of the herb, and arranged them so pretty in a pot that every one was astonished and asked to see them. The love-lily-pots soon became famous. Every one knew the herb-boy, he was so happy and kindly, and gave each little pot a good name. For himself, he called the rose-buds \"Married Ladies.\"\n\nAfter a while Peter became famous, not only for his Lily, but for his wonderful pots. Many rich people who were in love came to the house, and asked to see Peter, and the herb-boy brought out his love-lilies, and these were taken to church for wedding presents,", "answer": "A: few people"}

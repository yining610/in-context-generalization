### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Janet has 9 cards more than Brenda. Mara has twice as many cards as Janet. How many cards do they have in all if Mara has 40 cards less than 150?<n>Output: 211<n><n>Input:A fox was thirsty searching for water during the drought, where was he? Choices:  A: painting B: hen house C: california D: virginia E: movie hall<n>Output:		A<n><n>Input: Which statement is true about fruits? Choices:  a: apples b: bananas c: oranges d: pears<n>Output: b<n><n>Input: There are 10 apples in a bag. One boy ate one apple. All of them left apples in the bag How many apples were in the bag now?<n>Output:9<n><n>Input:1 and 1 are greater than 1/2<n>Output:False<n><n>Input: How many numbers in between 1 and 4 are prime (i.e., only 2 and 3)<n>Output: 2 and 3<n><n>#### Explanation:First question is an easy one. It's about subtraction. As Janet has 9 more cards than Brenda, and Mara has 2 times cards as Brenda, Janet and Mara have 12 cards more than Brenda, that is, they have 47 cards. Then, Mara has 4 times the cards than Janet, so she has 4 times 47 = 188 cards. So, Mara has 150-188 = -38 cards and Janet has 47 +-38 = 19 cards. So they have 9+19=28 cards. So, the answer is 28.<n><n>Second question is an easy one, as well, it just requires to take the letters in the sentence and use their initials. The second letter is the initial for fox, the third letter initial is the initial from water and house (a vowel followed by another vowel) and the fifth letter is the initials for california. So, the sentence means fox was sitting in a California hen house (well, california has 11 letters, not 6) searching for water, when he was thirsty.<n><n>The third one is just about comparing the fruits which were mentioned. <n>the fourth one has a hidden word, to help it, you can use substitution method, and answer will be obtained.<n>for example,<n>first, replace "two" for "1"<n>and second, replace "1" with "two", and so on.<n>you can use another letter like "d" or "f" if the word is very long<n>and the answer will be "1 and 1

Choices:  A: sun himself B: thank god C: race against time D: express love E: to think about things.<n>Output:		C<n><n>---<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>In problem 2, If each persons has *9* cards more than Brenda then Janet had 67cards. However, Mara had only *9*cards less than *150*, which is 141. So *9*cards must be subtracted from *150*, but *141* and *150* can not be subtracted in the same time. *141-9=132*, then *132-9* equals to *123*. So we have *211*cards in all.<n><n>In problem 3, If each person has *9* more cards than Brenda then the answer, Brenda had *37*. Mara twice had *37*cards. However, Maras also had *9*cards less, means *47* cards. Since *47* minus *9* equals *38* and Mara had *2* cards more than Brendas than each person would have *106*cards altogether.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Janet has 9 cards more than Brenda. Mara has twice as many cards as Janet. How many cards do they have in all if Mara has 40 cards less than 150?<n>Output: 211<n><n>Input:Where is a bald eagle safe? Choices:  A: pine tree B: open country C: in washington D: wildlife refuge E: sky<n>Output:		(choice A)<n><n>Input: I have a 100 dollar bill. I trade a 1000 dollar bill for 2 50 dollar bills. I trade a 20 bill for another 50 dollar bill,and then I give the last 20 to my friend. I only have 7 dollars left now. How much did I get originally?<n>Output: 94.75<n><br><n><br><n>### Explanation:<br><n><n>When we first look at the instruction, we start with our head. We think to ourselves "Let's focus on the first question. I can't do the second question." So we work on the first question. The first question looks like a lot, so we start from the bottom. <br><n>"What's the number? Do I know that? How can I solve for that number?" <br><n>Looking closer at the problem, the answer looks to be less than 151, since Mara has 43 fewer than 151. I'm going to call the number X.<br><n>Because Janet has 9 more than that number. <br><n>So how do I solve this problem? Well I will make a table. The values to use are Janet, Brenda, Mara, X...<br><n>And then the final question is how many do they have in all? <br><n>I put < 151. <br><n>And I do this because no one knows that answer and no one wants to just guess.<br><n>So to make sure the answer is correct I will use the other question as my first answer. <br><n>Janet is the closest we know, so I will use her. Janet is 70. <br><n>The answers are in columns, so I will just look at the columns to go down.<br><n>Brenda is next, and so I do this, and look at the columns...<br><n>I am now seeing an obvious pattern. Each answer is +/- 8, so there is a perfect 8 for each answer. <br> <br><n>"How many is 8 away from 50." <br><n>"8 away from 58." <br><n>Then I see we do it again. <

Choices:  A: learning B: painful memories C: thinking D: awe inspiring E: pleasure<n>Output:		awe inspiring<n><n>#### Instruction: Answer each of the following in two or three sentences.<n><n>If there is one card, then the minimum is 40. If there are two cards, then the minimum is two times 40 and so on.<n>I think that the maximum I could have done is 41 because, as we know from the above, I have an increase of 41 compared to the first card.<n><n>If they are both artifacts, then I cannot distinguish them. If one of them is an artifact and the other one<n>is not, then I can distinguish them. In particular, let me denote the artifact as the one that I see first. This one can be found by setting the left hand side to be 9, which is the number of cards we know about Janet and the right hand side to be 150 which is the number of Brenda and Mara. Then, for the difference, I will need to set the left hand side to the number of cards that<n>Brenda has. And then set the right hand side to the number that Mara have. In order for these two values to be the same, I will need to increase by my number of cards.<n>This method will work for any number of people who have more than one card. This method also applies to a case where the person cannot afford the increase of 1.<n><n>For the other half, it is a different case because I have both artifacts. By comparing with both cards, it is very clear that this card is not like that one.<n>By using these observations, I am able to decide which of two cards is an artifact and the rest is non-artifacts. <n><n>

Choices:  A: new experiences B: playfulness C: own house D: good looking E: beautiful<n>Output:		D<n><n><n><n>### Explanation:<n>Let's count the number of total possible numbers of cards. There are 52 cards. So we need the 52-1= 51-1= 50 ways to write a number from 50 -> 99. <n>And we need 9->4 ways to write 9.<n><n>Total ways = 51*4=204<n><n>Now the question ask us to multiply the number ways that mara has 40 - 150 cards. So Mara has 110 cards and the question say 211, so the number of ways = (110-11) * 204 = 180<n><n><n><n>## 24. You are at the racetrack, and you have $6 to spend. You have a $100 horse, a 50/1 chance to win. You have a 20/1 horse, a 40/1 chance to do well.You have a 10/1 horse, which you like but which is only a 5/1 chance for the win. You have 10 other horses but do not know anymore about them. Which horse would you bet on?<n><n>---<n><n>## Solution:<n>First, let's look at the $100 horse.There for sure only 1 way to get $100 back from betting 1 dollar on this race, even the race don't have any return, we get $1 back.<n>And the race have chance to return the profit if it is greater than 100, otherwise all of us lost money.So we need the sum of possible winning number of this race so we need (1+100)/101 = 0.05.<n><n>Now we look at the question.How likely is someone bet on the 10/1 Horse?This horse have 5/1 chance to win. Let's calculate this 5.<n><n><n><n>10 times we get $5 back. So the chance for 5 times is 1/10 and the chance for the remaining 6 times we lost the money.So the chance to get back this horse's money is : 6/10.<n><n>### Examples:Input:There are

Janet is higher than Brenda<n><n>The second half means? Mara is higher than Janet, it is twice that of Janet, so 1/2 = (40-150)/9 = 90, so 1/9.<n><n>Based on the first half, we know that we are looking at difference, so we can use the formula to subtract. We know that Mara has twice as high as Janet, and therefor Janet has less cards than Mara. Mara's cards are 180-90 = 90 more than Janet.<n><n>Based off of the second half, Janet has less than Mara, that means that when you add Janet and Brenda, Brenda is lower than the total. That means Mara is higher, since Mara is also the lower of the two. Add Janet and Mara, then Brenda is the difference, 40.

But later I found out that was wrong.<n>### How to solve<n>First I decided what I knew for this problem.<n><n>|   |   |<n>| :----: |:-: |<n>| **Total** | **9**|<n>| **More Than + Twice As Much** | **21**|<n><n>So I made a table of possibilities of the total amount of them.<n><n>|   Brenda|   Janet|   Mara|   Total |<n>|:-:|:-:|:-|:-|<n>|   9 |10 |11 |20 |<n>|11 |10 |9 |20 |<n><n>Then I looked at the other choice, and the last one of the 3, Mara, wasn't even an option. <n>So after this, I knew there was another answer, and kept looking.<n><n><n>First I looked at my table above, then looked a little closer.<n><n>|  Janet |  Mara |<n>|:-: | :-: |<n>|   9 |  11 |<n>|11|10|<n><n>Then I started taking away the possibility table, and I was left with 20 and 150.<n><n>After looking at it again, I figured out it made no sense, then I started looking at my choice possibilities. The two cards couldn't be added together, then I realized I had a decimal. After that, I figured out the answer.<n>

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Janet has 9 cards more than Brenda. Mara has twice as many cards as Janet. How many cards do they have in all if Mara has 40 cards less than 150?<n>Output: 211<n><n>Input:Where would one find a shopping bag for packing groceries? Choices:  A: supermarket B: home C: closet D: mart E: hardware store<n>Output:		B<n>### Solution: Write a procedure, CardsProd, that will multiply the number of cards that Janet,  Brenda, and Mara, have together. We need to take these input strings and then translate them into numbers. Then we need to figure out a way to multiply them all together without using * or / to solve the problem.<n>### Explanation: This was a very challenging instruction because there was no explicit information as to what it wanted us to do. However, there were a lot of patterns (or repeated behaviors) that I could use to start figuring out the instructions with a "trial and error" method.<n><n>For example, after doing each of their procedures I would print and check my output numbers to make sure that they were correct. For the first test, Janet had 9 more cars, Brenda had twice as many cards, so 18, and Mara had 40 cards less, so 90. I realized that the instructions were comparing and subtracting the numbers of each person, and so I knew that the result would be what they did not have (ie the negative). So, the correct output for Janet, Brenda, Mara was 6, 13, and 12, respectevely.<n>

Peter took care of the house and the garden. Their little garden was not large, but its flowers were well cared for. They lay in flower beds, and in large pots, and were surrounded by a stone wall. But in one corner there was a plot of ground, and out of it grew but one bush of common herbs.<n><n><n>One evening, just before winter, when Peter was cutting and gathering herbs for the master and mistress, and bringing in their wood, the old folks said to the boy: "What shall we give you instead of money for all the work you have done for us?" Peter knew very well they were poor and would find it hard to afford him anything. Nevertheless, he thought they could not leave him destitute, and he answered: "I should like such a stick of wood as comes from the corner where the ground is planted only with herbs."<n><n>Then, the old people told Peter they would give him what he had asked for. The next day he went into the garden and chose for himself a stick of wood, one that was big enough for him to sit down upon. There he sat, and began to watch the little bush of common herbs growing by the corner of the garden, and before the month was over the bush had grown a lot and produced pretty rose-colored flowers.<n><n>Peter became fond of this herb, which he called a "Love-Lily." Every morning he arose before the others<n>and came to the garden; he gathered branches of the herb, and arranged them so pretty in a pot that every one was astonished and asked to see them. The love-lily-pots soon became famous. Every one knew the herb-boy, he was so happy and kindly, and gave each little pot a good name. For himself, he called the rose-buds "Married Ladies."<n><n>After a while Peter became famous, not only for his Lily, but for his wonderful pots. Many rich people who were in love came to the house, and asked to see Peter, and the herb-boy brought out his love-lilies, and these were taken to church for wedding presents,

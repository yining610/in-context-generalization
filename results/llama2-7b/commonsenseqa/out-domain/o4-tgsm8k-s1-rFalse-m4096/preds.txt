Choices:  A: empathy B: anxiety C: knowlege D: falling down E: hear things<n>Output:		Key: A<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question given below.<n><n>Mike’s sister and Mary have an identical bike. They trade for a month, so Mary has Mary’s bike for a month and Mike has sister’s bike for the same amount of time. They want to trade back to their respective bikes at the end of the month so they can each ride their own bikes for a month. How many months will it take for them to return their bikes to their owners?<n><n>### Solution:  The question asked us to find the exact number of months it takes to return to their respective bikes, so let's calculate all the possible cases and find how long it takes to trade back to their original bikes.<n><n>### To calculate the number of days Mike will be on sister's bike, let's start by dividing the number of days Mike can use sister's bike by how long Mike has access to his own bike before he needs to return it to his sister.<n><n>### The first method we can use to calculate the number of days sister will be on Mike's bike is to find how many months it will take to get sister on Mike's bikey, and that's simply, sister's days on the bike times the number of bikes on the bike, or in other words, sister's days of having Mike's bike times the number if days Mike could be on sister's bicycle.<n><n>### Now, we can use those numbers to determine the final answer, since both sister and Mike's calculations yield the same result, the number of days it will take to have their bikes back at their respective bicycles.<n><n>### One final note. I hope you enjoyed this chapter on recursion, have a nice day.

After you have finished typing everything, then answer the questions in the next section. Also try to debug each program by printing the values in each function/variable's declaration. This will help you spot any errors in your code.<n>When debugging a program, don't use a brute force technique such as writing print each variable or printing each value and looking for differences. Try to narrow down the problem by writing more meaningful and less verbose code.<n><n>### Part 1: Variable Declaration (Lines 1-4)<n>We will learn to create functions that work on lists. For this, we'll need to create an array that stores all the elements of the list.

He lives on his own. Where does he live? Choices:  A: fish market B: pet shop C: great outdoors D: river E: little mermaid<n>Output:		E<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>#### Step 1: The 1st question is to find the total and then divide the total by the amount Mary had and the remainder is then 44. <n><n>```<n>sum=int(amount[0] + amount[1])+ int(amount[2]+amount[3])+int(amount[4]+amount[5])+int(amount[-1]+amount[-2])+int(amount-2)-int(amount[0])-int(amount[1])-int(amount[-1])-int(sum[4])<n><n>```<n>#### Step 2: This question is to find how many more dollars are needed to make $100. First we will find out how much they have already to start us. We do this by adding all the numbers together and getting the sum, we subtract it from 100 to see what the final result is. Next we need to find out in what increments they have to find the money in to get to the final end amount. We start subtracting the last number in the row from the number above it to see how many times they have to do it.<n><n>```<n>p=0<n>for b in range(start[1],end[1]):<n>  m+=b<n>  if b>100:<n>    if ((p+b+m)/2)>1:<n>      p+=b+m<n>      m=0<n>  else:<n>    p+=b<n><n>p+m<n><n>```<n><n>#### Step 3: In this question we need to get the number of legs the animals together are having. We start with the animals are having 2,1,3,4,2,1,3 and this gives us a number of 13. Since we need to triple the 13, we will need the double it and go backwards to get it. We will get to the first row by going the same amount of steps backwards. We double the first number and get 4, then go 4 times backwards. This puts us back at 2, which means that multiplied by itself is 4 and we then take away a 2 and this gives us 2 as the final answer. The same can be done to go from 3 to 2 and from there to 3 to get the number of Legs that the animals together have in

How many feet are in 5/27?<n>Output:9<n><n><n>#### The solution:<n>The first problem (34/10) is to take the fraction 34/10 and divide one digit and the entire fraction by 10. Then the problem that does not involve division. Substitute 6 into each expression/relation/equations. The result is equivalent to the rest of the expressions. You need to solve one equation for one variable.<n><n>34/10 divided by 10 is already 3.4.<n><n>Thus, 34 divided by 10 equals 3.4 in the entire fraction. Therefore, solve for one variable by subtracting 3.4 from the denominator and then add the answer with the other side of the fraction to the denominator. Therefore, the answer to the question is 0.6.<n><n>The second problem (Mary had 89 sticklers) has one option of four stickers so add 4. If the problem gave you the option of using one large sticker each of six pages then solve for the answer to the problem.<n><n>The third question is to find the difference between one hundred and five. Difference between the answer of 95 and the answer of a number that is at least 95 but less than 100. Therefore, nine and then you have 95 plus nine is 104.<n><n>The fourth question is 6 is a choice since 3 multiplied by 6 which is 18 is 2 less and 5 is 2 more than 18 than 18 is equivalent to 19 since 19 minus 4 is 15 so 15 plus five is 20 and then 20 plus 2 is 22 and then 22 minus 8 is 14.<n><n>The fifth question is 11/0= 11.0 and not an answer because you have to solve an equation of division for the answer of division.<n><n>The sixth question is 5/27= 1/5 and 5/9 is 0.5 in the answer so add

Your program should then display the musical artist’s name, the movie’s title, and the number of times that the movie has appeared on the Billboard 50 movie charts.<n>### Instruction : Your main method should have two arguments. The first argument should be a Scanner object, sc. The sc object will hold all of the information that the users type in. (You don’t need to create an instance of sc because it is passed in to you as a parameter.) The second argument should be the name of your main method e.g. showChart.<n>###Instruction: The main method should have three statements. The first statement will prompt the users with the sc.nextLine() method. After the first statement, you will use the sc.nextLine to take two lines of input. The user will provide 50 lines that show movies in order from 1-50, along with a corresponding movie title. Each line is formatted as <movie title> followed by a comma and followed by the movie’s billboard number. e.g. 21 Jump Street,  1<n>The second statement will use the sc.hasNextLine to test if there is another line left in the sc.nextLine.<n>The third statement will have a for-loop that runs for each of the 50 lines that the user entered. Inside each for loop, you will display the movie title based on the movie’s Billboard number. A user is only supposed to enter one movie per line. If you don’t find another movie for the next line, the sc.nextLine will give you the first, empty, line. Your code should display the first movie title, the movie title in the first line submitted by the users, and the movie’s chart position.You will have to display the movie title and the billboard number in your program’s console. Below is a sample string output.<n>```<n><n>

By "farther," we mean that you are either walking at the starting position OR at the next step on the next side of the path. At a later time, Dora chooses to rest for 5 steps.

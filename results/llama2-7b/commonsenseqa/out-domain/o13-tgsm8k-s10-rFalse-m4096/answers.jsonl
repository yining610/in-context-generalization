And it's an array, it's like a list of numbers. So if you think about it, it's kind of like the way that I think about it. You have a list the name goes over here. We have an array here, you have a list of numbers. Okay, so let's, let's talk about what happened. So if I do print avaland you see, this is where you type print, you put a lowercase t on the end of that. Then you have these curly brackets. So when I have these right here, these are curly brackets. You can type any bracket. It won't work, but you can type whatever you want to. But curly brackets are the most common way to say, oh, you know what this expression is going to be? It's going to be an array. Or it's going to be a list. And I do use them all the time.

One brother is named Bill, another is named Fred, and the third is named Bill, Jr. How many brothers did they have to start with?\nOutput: 0\n  \n## Solution \nWe start off by using loop statements. The loop statements tell the computer to repeat the instructions inside until a certain condition is satisfied. The loop statements are iterative statements.\n \nIn the above scenario where Adam bought 3 kilogram of nuts and 5 kilograms of dry fruit, the outermost loop is repeated in order for the computer to calculate what he paid for the nuts. Each of the nested loops are the one that is inside the other. \n\nThe most commonly nested loop is a for loop. In c language, you can think of for loop as an incrementing counter or index that gives the current position in a list or array and tells how many times a loop had executed. To start the loop, you can use an initializing statement, the body of for loop is followed by an increment statement and a final statement.\n\nFor example from the above question, we can write the java code.\n\n```java\n// Question - A: What number would be returned from the following for loop?\nfor (int i = 1; i <= 5; ++i)    // Initializing the index\n     System.out.println(i);     // Print the value\n```\n\n# Multiple Conditional Statements\nIn Conditional statements two or more statements follow the condition. As per c language, a statement does not return any value. The conditional statements let you evaluate and return the boolean value to judge if the statements are true or false, based on the condition.\n\nExample: Consider the flowchart below. To test which of the three statements in the flow can be executed, we can use an if statement. An if statement is also known as decision or choice statement. It is used to execute the statements based on one or more conditions. You can read more here [https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/if-else]\n\n[![Example Flow chart for c programming multiple conditional statement questions](/img/conditional.png)][link4]\n\n[link4]: https://www.programiz/c-programming/else-if-loops\n# How can you test if a string is", "answer": "C: michigan"}

To add two fractions, add both the numerator and the denominator. To subtract a fraction, you simply subtract the numerator and denominator. In addition, to multiply any fractions together, multiply the numerators and denominator. For instance, 1/3(4/5) = 1/3 \u00d7 4/5 = 4/5\n\nInput: In order to find the reciprocal of a fraction, you simply flip the top and bottom numbers. Therefore, 1/6 is reciprocal to 6/1 = -6/1 in order to get the reciprocal of 3/16 you simply change -3/16 to 16/-3 = -4/16 or you could say 16/4 = -4/1\n\nInput: To find the greatest common denominator, divide both numbers into the numbers, and add them. For instance, if you had 1/3 and 1/5 you would say 1/5+1/3 = (9/15)(57/105) = 395/105 or (395 + (62/5)) = 457/10\n\nInput: To divide fractions, you simply multiply by the denominator and add the answer to the numerator with the denominator. For example, 1/6 \u00f7 1/3 = 6/6 \u00d7 1/3 =1/3. Here is a more complicated example 7/18 \u00f7 3/12 = 5/12", "answer": "A: drink tea"}

Therefore, it is 20 years from Hurley\u2019s age now.\nAnd hurley is 14 so that makes the difference 54 years from both their current age (20). So to get the combined age now, we need to add the ages of both together first so Hurley: 1 + (20 years) = Hurley + (20 years - 14 years) = 34 years old. And Richard: 1 + (40 years - 40 years from his current age) = 34 + 30 = 64 years old.\nThe combined age now would be (34 + 64).\nThe combined age now = 98:\n\n#### *Input : Let the variable x be the number of pages, where x > 0\nThe goal here is to find out the difference between 150 and pages. Now, the page he read is greater than 150 because the goal is that he is always checking out books exactly 150 in order to make the book purchase process more manageable. So, pages > 150\nPages read x + 150 = 150 150 = x\nx pages read = 150 / 150 (since x \u2260 0, we have x). Now, if we use the basic principle of proportion which is x = a/b where a is numerator and b is denominator.\nThe principle of proportion is x = 150/ (x + 150)\n(150 \u2013 x) / (150) = x/.(150 + x)\n150 \u2013 x / 150 + x = x /(150 +x)\n(15 \u2013 x) /(15 + x) = x/(15 + x)\n\n15 \u2013 x / 17x = x/ 15 + x\n(15-x)/17x = (x + x) / (17 *x)\n5 = 129x\n\nNow, to find x we have to isolate x and we would subtract 5 from", "answer": "B: north pole"}

Choices: 1: the solution is 18.2 miles. 95 is a percentage. 18.2 would be the percentage of the full solution. 50% of the full solution is 9.5 miles.  If the full solution is 18 miles, you multiply this by 95% = 17 miles 2: 12 / 18.2 is 2 / (18.2 * 100): The total solution is 12/95, which is 12.6%.  This would divide as 2/95.  This simplifies to 2/31. 3: the full solution is 3.57 miles.  12 / (12 * 95) is 12 / 3.5 = 3.44 miles.  This equals the percentage needed.  The solution is 3.444 miles. 4: 12/9.5 == (12/9.1)^1.5.  This simplfies to 2.2/12. So 2.2 miles would be the solution.  The answer given is 2.2 miles. \n\nInput: The bus took 16 and 1/10 hours to make a trip.

Since it is not 500 but 750 from the total money, there is a 2500 left to split amongst 4 teachers. Then in order to get 750 to each teacher,  you will simply divide 2500 by 4. The last teacher, as you noted, will get 100.\n\nFinally for the electronics question, we subtract $2000 - $700, meaning that the remaining money was $1300.

The mass ratio is the relationship between the ratio of water in the snow flake, h, and the total mass of the snowflake. If you know the density of a particular type of snowflake (1 gr/cm) and the mass of one snowflake (0.3 mg), you can easily calculate the mass of a snowflake by h times d (rounded to the nearest tenth). You can also easily determine the volume of each snowflake. In order to make one snowball, you would take 80 snowflakes of uniform density, round them up to the nearest 1/10 cm3, and stack them atop one another until you end up with one stacked pile of uniform snow.  Since each snowflake is the same size and uniform, the mass of the snowball would be the same as the mass of the 80 snowflaps, or 24 mg.

What did you expect to find and what did you actually find in your analysis on how to solve the problems? Explain.\n2. What patterns, if any, did you notice in your analysis? Explain.\n\nAnswer:\n1. I expected finding the difference in ages of Hurley and Richard to come out 20, but it would have been too straightforward if that were the case. Instead, the answer is 128. The combined ages to come out to 120 if there are 20 years difference between the ages. Therefore, I should add 20 more to the sum of the two ages and that would give me the total number of years. Thus, adding 12 years to each age and the sum of those ages will be 129, I'll subtract 20 from 129 to get 109 or 100 plus 9. I'll subtract 9 from 100 to get 91 as the correct one. So how do we do this? First I'll subtract 80 from 120. That's because 20 is already accounted for. I get -40. Now I'll add 8 and the sum will be 9. I'd rather have it as a whole number so I'd subtract 1.

The `bestCost` is initially 0 and will grow towards infinity. We use an exponential growth to get the most relevant results.  \n    By using the bestCost function we can get the minimal cost that still succeeds in getting the answer. In this case we use binary search to find the best cost. This gives us the best value and we use it by dividing the totalCost by the bestCost.", "answer": "E: closet"}

For example, 312 is Chicago, 641 is Des Moines, and 415 is San Francisco. For a telephone call in New York City, assume that the area code is 212. The first 5 digits identify the specific borough in which the call is made. The remaining 3 digits identify the street address. However, in the borough of Queens, the code number is a little different. Queens uses a 2 instead of a 21. For example, a call from Queens to a San Francisco number would begin with the area code of 2 instead of 21. The area code for Queens is 7. Therefore, a call to a number in San Francisco would begin with the area codes 2-7-3-1-5. You are called by a person from Queens. You answer the phone and ask what the call is about, because you do not recognize the number. The caller repiles, _\"That is the first question, dummy.

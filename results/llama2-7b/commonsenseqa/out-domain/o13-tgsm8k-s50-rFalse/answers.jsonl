{"text": "B\n\n### Input(Incorrect):\nThere is a rectangle made out of 4 identical bars of wood. Each bar is 1/2 inch by 3 3/4 inches. The dimensions of the rectangle is 13 1/4 inches by 4 1/4 inches.  How \nmany feet of wood was used to make the rectangle?\n\n### Response(Incorrect):\nOne foot is a little more than 12 inches long.  We want to find out how many 12 inch pieces we used.  Our original rectangle is 13 and 1/4 inches wide.  We can say that each foot will \ngive us a section that is 12 inches as well. Our width is 12.  We know that 4 of those 12's will fit in height and the remaining one will fit height and be left over.  We can \nsay that our width is equal to the number of feet multiplied by 12.  Width is equal to 4 feet multiplied by 4 (12).  Width is equal to  16 feet.  We know that we used 3 and 1/2 \ninches for wide.  We can now subtract that out from our width of 16 feet so that it will equal 12 3/4 inches wide.  16 - 3.5 = 12.5.  That is our width.   So what we did was we added \nthe width (12.5) to the height so that we can calculate what is remaining.   4 x 12.5 is equal to 50.  That number is what was remaining.  That is the amount that we used with \nour original 40 feet of wood.\n\n\n### Input\nThe carpet covers a whole bedroom floor that is 78 feet in length.

Then Max learned about the amount of work that a puppy requires.  The day Max bought his puppy was the same day that Max learned about cleaning up his messes and bathing his smelly mouth. When Max asked about his baths for the day the mother explained that as soon as Max bathed the puppy it was Max\u2019s turn. Max wasn\u2019t happy about that at all. The next day Max had to wake up early and do his chores before the puppy was ready to get a bath. The puppy had so many messes and so much muck on his little puppy feet and Max had to clean them with the hose. Max wasn\u2019t ready to work like a dog, but he did. A few days after Max got the puppy, Max learned that puppies need good diets and lots of treats.

(In the first row, the second person will have at 100, while the first person has lost 1000.)\n\nNow the first person will start to move from the podium to the stage.\n\nBy definition, person B moves to the stage (100 moves from stage to the podium).\n\nThe second person moves one position to the left. Since the move left, after this move, the first person has no money.\nSo the second player will lose 10.\n\nThis is the end of that row and the second player lost one dollar after row 1.\n\nNow E2 moves to the stage, and $109", "answer": "B: animal shelter"}

The user will input a name of another person that they will use.\nFor input #1, the user will input \"Richard and Hurley\", to calculate the total combined ages of the recipients 40 years from the present. The function must first split apart the names into separate strings. Then it adds the two strings together, separating the strings with the sum operator, and concatenating the two together. Then, the age of each recipient is simply subtracted from the age they will be 40 years in the future, using the addition operator with the negative sign. The result of the added operation is then subtracted from the total age of both persons, using the subtraction operator. This leaves them with the answer of 128 as the combined ages of the recipient is 128 years old.\n```\nvar splitSplits, stringAddition, stringConcat, resultAddition, resultSub, newAge; \nfunction greetings(){\n    splitSplits = split.split(\" \");\n    var userInput = prompt(\"Hi there, name of person greetings is going to\");\n    addUsers = splitSplits[0] + splitSplits[1];\n    userAttitude = prompt(\"What is the recipient's mood?\");\n    if(userAttitude == \"attractive\" || userAttitude == \"great\")\n        addUsers += userInput;\n    stringAddition = addUsers;\n    stringConatension = \" + \";\n    stringConat = stringConatension + stringAddition;\n\n    resultAddition = resultAddition + stringConat + \" + \";\n    resultSub = resultAddition + splitSplits.length;\n    resultAddition += resultSub;\n\n    newAge = resultAddition.substring(resultAddition.length);\n\n    return newAge + \" and also \" + 40\n};", "answer": "C: grassy field"}

This means I need to break down the units to be able to calculate the answer based on what I will have at the coffee brewer. I am going to have a certain amount of tablespoons (tbsp). A 200oz batch will require 20 tablespoon to fill it entirely. However, 20 tablespoops would fill an entire pot therefore if I was to measure the tablespoons in cups the answer would be 8. I will now attempt to add on to the calculation for the tbsp in cups. 20 tbsp would require 4 cups, but in this scenario where I would like to fill an entire pot of 200oz I must also include the ozs I need for the whole container. The amount of ozs is 10 because there are 10 ozs in a cup, so what we need to do is figure out how many times to multiply our amount of cups by 10 but keeping the conversion of tbps from cups to ozs, this would leave us with the answer of 10 cups. The conversion is simply 1 cup times 10 ozs, so that", "answer": "E: farmer's market"}

How many more hours can he be over the scheduled payroll hours?\nAnswer: 60\n\n### Correct:\nMiles planned to complete 84 hours of payroll, but a 10-hour client crisis interrupted him.  Then, he had 74 more hours to work on payroll.  It sounds like he's 35% over 74 hours of payroll; that's 60% more than scheduled.  If he's 36%, he's 63% over, and so on, so I calculated Miles was 60%.  I figured Miles could be up 29% or more because 35% is less than 37%, or 36% (27%).\n\n### IncomeCorrect:\nThis answer is correct because the explanation of what was being asked is explained.  Miles is asked what percentage he is over.  He planned to work 84 hours, but was 35% over.  That's 39% more than planned.  A number near or above 7% would have been less correct, because 35% would be less than 39%.  This means less than 39% more would be considered, which means 35% isn't a", "answer": "C: prepare to go"}

It is also possible that you've been asked to test or build a measuring tool that can use your new unit to determine the length of objects. How would you describe this to a student who is trying to understand how we measure objects?\n\n### Example Solution:\nWe measure how long or deep an object using our own measurement unit. You can choose one or a set of two or three measurements of length or height. You can also use the measurement to determine the mass of an object. If we have three measurements, we can compute the volume of an object.\n\nWe don't use an existing unit to measure an object because we're too busy. We have a more immediate need to make our own measurements. The units we choose will then be applied to all objects and that is not the same thing as making a system of measurement.\n\nWe can use the unit we define to describe the length of our shoes. Or we can ask a builder to include the unit in their construction. Either way, this unit will be used to describe length with specificity in all kinds of situations.\n\n### Data Representation:Describe the data you are being asked to measure in the task below.\n\n### Input (Optional): Use the instruction below to help you think about the instruction you'd like to add below.\n\n## Data Representation:", "answer": "D: seed crops"}

{"text": "Correct response: E. The best answer is E. The word \"master\" used before \"carpenter\" refers to someone in the craft, not a job title. The word \"carpenter\" comes from \"to carve.\" The root of the word \"carve\" is \"car.\" A carpenter would use a chisel (\"tool for cutting, such as for decoration or inscribing\") to carve into an object and a spoon (\"a flat slab of metal, wood, or plastic for eating with\") to get something out. As a side note, there are many words that can be used as verbs for \"dig.\" I chose to use \"dig out \" (\"to obtain or remove\") for an example because it is closest to the meaning and I thought there would be a better chance for the person to get 4192+ points that way.\n\n### Input 2:What does a teacher use to prepare students for exams?

Each of the following problems could be solved with a recursive method, an iterative method, or a functional method using the function `powerOfTwo`. \n\nYou have already learned how to write a recursive method, an imperative method, or a declarative method.  Each of these solutions will demonstrate a different design pattern and use a different strategy for solving the problem.\n\nA recap of the syntax that you'll use to implement a recursive method:\n`myFunc(x, y) ; // the body of the method`\n\n\n`// recursive call using return`\n\n`recursiveFunc(x, y)`\n`return myFunc( x * y, y + 1);`\n\n\n`// stop recursive call using break`\n\n`else recFunc(x, y);`\n`break;`\n\n\n`// break recursive call using return`  \n\n`else return myFunc(x * y, y +1);`\n\nThese are the steps to complete when designing a recursive method.\n\n1.

Use the appropriate keyword to call the nested function inside your header.\n4. Write the function body and return the value.\n\nYou don't have to know the answer yet to respond.  The solution method will be provided at the bottom.\n\n#### Task\n\nWrite the body for each recursive function so that it does the following:\n\n1.  The header function executes at each recursive call in the method body.\n\n2.  The recursive call must use arguments `x` and `y`\n\n3.  The method returns the result of a nested call with x = x*y, and y = y + 1\n\n4.

{"text": "Answer: B. The millpond is a lake made by building a dam. Hence, the beaver can make a dam to form a millpond that destroys the machine by impeding the running of it. It is therefore, wrong to say that the beaver destroyed the machine by building the dam in the strip club. Beaver was not thinking of the strip club. It was about the water. Hence, the beafer should be blamed for building the dam in the lakes, rivers or millponds. A beaver would not damage the dam or think of it, let alone consider the machines. Therefore to build a dam a beaver would select a lake or river, unless the option C (millpond), is chosen then the beaver would destroy the machine.\n\n### Answer: D.\n\n### Input : The carrots that the baker used to make the chocolates cost a dollar for $1000, but that changed 1/8.

{"text": "### 4\nA waiter sets the table.\n\n### Input\nIn a country, the age distribution of males is 1:1.2:1.5:3:9:16.6. If the total population is 1000000, how many males are there?\n\n### Response\nThe 5 numbers make the sequence 1, 2, 1.5, 3, 9, 16.6,. If each number is the ratio between two numbers, then the first is 1 and the last is 16.6.  The mean (arithmetic mean) between the other numbers is (1 + 2 + 1.5 + 3 + 9)/5 = 7. So, the first two numbers have to be 1 and 7, and the third number is half way between two. So, 3 is the middle number between 1 and 7. We'll call it 4. So now 1, 4, 3, 1.5 and 9 have to be 5 numbers in a sequence.  Let's put one in 1st place, 4 in the middle place, 3 in the second middle place, 1.5 in third middle place, and 9 at the end. Each is its own ratio. Rearrange so that they divide equally into 1000,000: 4/(10000)=1,076, or 1.076. Now the first ratio is 1 and it's got to divide into the same number. We know that 1 will multiply by the end number (9) to get 9, so 1 should multiply by the center number (4) to also get 9. And one divided into 4 is 3. The sequence is now: 3, 4, 1.5.  Each of those numbers is its ratio divided by 3, so they are 3/3, 4/3, and 1.5/3.  If we multiply those numbers by 3 to make ratios, we have 1, 4/3 (rounded down to 3) and 5/3 (rounded way up to 1.6667).  So, the sequence ends with 1,", "answer": "E: present bill"}

They have a bag of chips each. They all have similar sizes of the bag and they each shared equally with everyone. Everyone eats all but two friends who eat all the chips they brought.  There is one bag left uneaten.  How many chips are in the bag?\n\n### ResponseInput: \n\nChips are in no defined amount that is already known. Everyone is already aware of how much they brought when they know their bags were similar with no defined amount they brought like say 15, 16, or 17. The fact is there would be an unequal proportion of chips based on the number brought with it. One person may bring 5 bags of chips which are 20 chips each, the person that brought those chips ate one and a half bags of chips. So 1 person ate 2 out of the 20 total chips. Now multiply how many total chips there were left in the bag with the number of how many chips one person ate. So 1 1/2 x 20 = 20. There would be no remaining chips because the last 2 are with the 2 people that ate the chips they bought. Therefore 2 chips is all that is left in the bag.\n\n### Question:\nIn a school with five classes, there are 25 students in each class.

Choices: A: Bite B: Lay Down C: Growl D: Need To Eat\n\n### Response:(B) If an animal is lonely, what is it likely  to do? Choices:(1) To play (2) To be happy (3) To eat something special (4) to be loud and scary (5) to die\n\n### Response (A)\n\n### Instructions:(A) This is a game called 'Who is the leader?' There are 4 participants. Each participant takes turns playing by rolling a die. Players who roll a 4 keeps rolling till they roll a 1 or 6 and is sent home till the end of the game. Players that roll a 3 or 5 play another game to decide who is the first leader. When it comes to the next round, the winner of the last game become the new leader.\n\n### Response : When players want to roll new dice, they have to say \"Roll Dice\". They can only roll new dice when the old dice are rolled to a 1 or 5. When the players roll 4, they can keep rolling. Players may also roll 3 or 5 for a different round. When it's a 4, the player will keep counting, and then he can't roll another game.  If all the players of the game are 4, then the players can continue to 5.\n\n\nIn 'Roll Dice', any player may roll the dice even if the player who rolled the previous one is still counting.  When there is 1 or 5 on the dice, the first player can do 'roll dice'. Once this player has done so, players must continue to 'roll dice' until they have completed 5 or 1.\n\nWhen playing for the first time when someone gets to 1 or 5, you can't play that round. You must first keep counting and continue to count when all three players are 4.  The next player may roll dice and will roll again, and so on until a player rolls to 1 or 6.\n\n### Input : The group played the game of \"Who is the leader\" for two hours.

{"text": "The correct answer is the word front.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe front window is located in the front, or up front as we commonly say of a house or business. (We put the front door near the front of the house.)\n\nIn the question sentence, the presence the dog saw is a reason to bark, which is barking at the front. The dog has no reason to bark at a building, since they are not the reason for presence. Friend's house could be in the neighborhood and a classroom could be in a classroom. It makes sense to bark at the front door because the dog could be barking the door off the front.\n\nIn fact I think if you add house, the dog would bark the front door of the house down, if not a friend's house in the neighborhood.\n\nI think the front (of a house) is the common word to use after front window. This may be why \"front\" was chosen over \"front door\".\n\n### Input\n\nIn the last exercise, you answered the following multiple choice question: The difference in ages of Richard and Hurley is $20.

{"text": "The right answer is B\n\n### Instructions:\n\nWrite a program that accepts an input. If the input is \"A\", print \"in the middle ages\". If the input is \"B\", print \"in the castle\". If the input is C, print \"in a fairy tale\". If the input is D, print \"on a chess board\". If the input is E, print \"inside the doll house.\" Otherwise, print \"nowhere\".\n\n### Instructor Notes:\n\nThe task's output will be on the first line. It should be displayed as \"in <answer>\" where <answer> is one of \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", or \"E\".\n\nThis task is fairly simple; there are only five valid inputs. The catch is that you cannot have programmers be stuck choosing the right answer from the options every time. The instructions above explain how a programmer can appropriately respond to an instruction that completes the request. The only hard concept here is that the \"in <answer>\" format should come on the first line of output. Make sure your program follows those formatting instructions.\n\n### Solutions\n\nSolution One:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    print('This is a solution that you can run')\n    return\n```\nYou have reached the end of the program and the 'print' statement is the only instruction given in the section above. It should only print \"in <answer>\" with the <answer> being one of 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', or 'nowhere'.\n\n\n```python\ninput = 'in' + input\nif input == 'A':\n    print('It is <a>')\nelif input == 'B':\n    print('it is <b>')\nelif input=='C':\n    print('is <c> ')\nelif input=='D':\n    print(' on <d>')\nelif input==\"E\":\n    print(' in <e>')\nelse:\n    print('nowhere')\n```\nThe above program looks at each input and only outputs the answer 'in <answer>' if the answer has been pre-defined and is one of the five possible options. Other than the program using the input, that is exactly how is should be coded.\n\nSolution Two:\n```python\ndef", "answer": "D: chess board"}

However, from a logic point of view, subtract 100 times nine. The result should be n times 10 and then n times 10 times n, or n^2.\n\nHere' it all boils down for math majors. From a math perspective, subtracting by (subtracting 100 by 9) will yield (100 + minus) 9 (9n). This is equivalent to (0 + minus) of 100n, which is (0 + minus) or (minus) plus 9, which is minus n. Now, add n to what? Nine.\n\nNow, let's move on to math and logic. If you subtract by 100, you get minus 9n. N is three. 161 is what? 16, 16, 0.\n\n## What type of geometric solid is described by this equation? 36 square units are covered by 16 tetrahedrons.\n\nThis is 36 (squared) divided by 16 (squared), which equals 36 / 256, which equals 0.143.\n\nThe 36 square units form a cube with", "answer": "E: procrastination"}

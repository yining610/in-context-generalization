Ex. if I buy six sticks of lip gloss, then that is six sticks of lipgloss to one of mine. And if I need four ounces of flour, then I know how to make an amount of the flour in a given amount of the flour. There is also something called cross ratios. It is defined as the ratio of several variables divided by the ratio of other variables. The cross ratios can be represented in the form of a fraction, which is called an altitude cross ratio. For example, if a given parallelogram is ABCD and you are given a diagonal AC, and are also given the side of the parallelogram, say of CD which is 15 and its altitude is 10 feet. The altitude cross ratio is 0.5. So if you are given any 2 of these altitudes to the side diagonal, you will know the 2 others with a simple division, and that is the Altitude Cross Ratio. Another type of cross ratio is called the base cross ratio. This is the ratio of two segments within the same base parallel with the segment you are given. To find the base cross ratio of AC and BC with the known segments AD and DC you will have a fraction ratio of 0.6. You can find cross ratios for the other combinations of side segments AB and CD. It turns out that \u221a5 : \u221a2 = 5 / 8 Cross Ratio = 5 / 3 5 / 2 = 1 / 2 Cross Ratio = 2 / 5\nAltitude ratios are represented like this. For example, ABC and AC'B are parallelograms with AC'B, as the side. Then 5B : 2A = 2:1 for the altitude ratios. If you divide the ratios you can get the same ratio and then the cross ratio is simple. Cross altitude ratio = 5 : 2 = 25 : 10 Ratio = 25 / 50\nExercise 5: Write an equation for each cross", "answer": "C: garden"}

The number of gold medals is doubled to 26. Then 262 + 63 = 366 (assuming 3 bronze medals per event). So the total number of medals is twice the amount of gold medals won. Let us denote the 366 medal value as A. The solution has four parts, a, b, c, and d. a. Host country, Korea, has 13 + 1 more than second place country. Thus 14. b.

If someone likes their temperatures cool, and their room isn\u2019t too cool, turning on a fan with just a few fan blades and a fan motor is all they need to cool themselves off quickly. An electric fan like this is called a circulation fan because it circulates cool air throughout a room quickly. They are not the kind of fans you use to blow breezes in the warm sun. The most common circulation fans are box fans and oscillating fans.

There are two ways to do this question. One is to just think about what a bassoon is and where it\u2019s played. Another method is to look up the question in the context of the exam. Let's start with that one; a quick Google search shows us that the Bassoon is a member of the reed family (and is played with a reed) and that a Bassoon is typically found in an orchestra:\n\n\u2022 In most North American school districts an orchestra program would include a Bassoon. \n\u2022 Often found in the first or second row of the orchestra and is the reed that plays the lowest notes in the orchestra. \"\n* So the final answer is B\n\nInput: The answer of this question is : \n\nYou can't hear a bassoon played unpleasantly. It's the highest-pitched instrument in the woodwind family.\n\nIt's a big brass, so it's not like you can hear it in the orchestra. You wouldn't be able to hear one in a high school orchestra either.\n\nYou can hear it live, so it's hard to say, but there are a lot of bassoonists out there, so you wouldn't really hear one in concert.\n\nYou'd be able to hear it in a baritone ensemble, but it's not the highest-pitch instrument in the band, so it would sound pretty bad.\n\nYou might be able to hear a bad bassoon play in a symphony orchestra, but this is extremely rare, and it's not even really a bad bassoon.\n\nSo you're probably more likely to hear a bad bassone when it's played live than you are when you hear it live, and both of those are going to sound pretty bad, but the best thing you're going to hear is a bad bassoon play live. \"\n* So this was a trick answer\n\nInput: \n\nWhich of these is more likely to be true?

If a total of 40 items were ordered for this combination for the day, and there were a total of 290 sandwiches ordered for the day, how many large fountain drinks were ordered for the day?\nOutput: \"I had no problem solving this, using simple percentages I used in grade school. The key for me was reading the prompt and being able to identify the items in the question. I read it twice to be sure. ( 290 / 40 ) 100 =2.25. I got the 2.25 the first time round. So if 40 is the number in the question, their total items sales must include 327 sandwitches as the rest would be 290. The 327 is about a 13% increase over the 290. Not too bad. So I guessed it based on the fact that it would either be (326*290) / (40*290) or (327*40)/ (290*290). I ended up with (40*259 + 327) / ( 40*293) 329 - 301 = 28. Then round down.

So 0.333 of total Dog population is equal to 16 and that will be equal to 16/0.333 = 48(since total dogs population is 48).\"\n So the final answer is \"D\"\n\nInput: In the given triangle ABC, D is a point such that in segment CDE, D is closer to CE than is to CE.

They had to divert and land at Schiphol because of a problem with the hydraulic system. When they landed it was too late for them to make the connection to LAX, so they were put up in a hotel whilst they were made to wait for a 747 to return from the Far East. However, they then had to divert again after an airspeed indicator failed to work. After eventually reaching LAX, they had to stay the night. When they finally got back to the UK they had lost two of their 747s, and the replacement had no GPS receiver. The whole journey took an agonising length of over 50 hours.

I think we need to go the reverse i.e let the total points add up to 31 and then we need to subtract 26 and see which is the smallest.\n\n\\begin{code}\n1 + 4 + 7 + 10 + 14 + 17 + 20 + 23 + 26 + 30 + 33 + 36 + 40 = 330\n1 - 4 - 7 - 10 - 14 - 17 - 20 - 23 - 26 - 30 - 33 - 36 - 40 = 270\n\\end{code}", "answer": "E: grocery store"}

You can do it in SQL, you can map it to an HTML table, you can map it for a custom report format.\nYou can do it with a custom class extending the XDocument class that has a method like GetValues which gets the rows as rows, gets the keys as columns, has an inner class that contains the answers and then does a foreach (result) on each, and prints each key value pair to the screen.\n\nThe simplest approach would be to create a method like GetValues() in a class that is derived from XDocument.   First of all, you should use an extension method.  This will cause the class to not have to include a reference to the base class, and you can include this extension only once during the compilation process.

The class mean score of the test was determined to be 236. By how much did each student have its score reduced if the teacher was not careful she might get the wrong conclusion.\nOutput:Class mean score is 236. If 10 points was deducetd from each student for late submition then, Class mean score must be equal to 226. Because the total number of late students is equal to the number of early students as the test was not allowed late submission. So, the total number of late submitters is equal to 5 times the number of early submitters = 5 * n = s. So, s + n is equal to 5.\nSo, the number of early submiters is 5 - s. Therefore, the late submiters are 5 + s. So, the late submiters is equal to Class mean score - (5 - s) = 226 - (5 - s).\nTherefore, 10 points was subtracted from each student. The number of early submitters is 5 - s, the total number of students is n.\nTherefore, the total number of points that was taken from each student is\n\n5 - s * n +5 - s * s which is equal to 236 + 5 - s * s.\nWhen s = 1, 236 + (236 - 1) = 468 which is wrong.

To get the factorial of 27, I multiply 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 together: 2*3*4*5*6*7 = 27. When you have a negative power, you can set it equal to the denominator.

The coordinates a and b, of a point define a unique position in the plane. When a point has three coordinates the position of the point is fully defined as, a, b, and c, if we are asked to find the coordinate of a point whose position is known as (1, 3), we substitute these values in the formula x = a cos b = 1, y = b cos c = 3, c = \u03c0 / 2. Now, the values of x an y are, x = 2, y = 1.58 and hence the coordinates are x = 2, and y = 1.6. Therefore the coordinate of a triangle with all three vertices as 1, 3 and \u03c0 / 2 (a, b and c) respectively is (3, 3, 2).\n\nInput:Which of the following will yield a negative output of \u2018A\u2019?\nA:(1, 3), (3, 1), (1, \u03c0 / 2) or ( \u03c0 / 2, 1) or ( 1, 3\u03c0 / 2)\nOutput:Explanation : We already know the coordinate of the triangles is in the form of (x,y,3).

Choices: 1: They are more stable 2: They pay interest 3: They have no fluctuations in value. 4: They offer a longer period to invest. 5: They are backed by the government\nOutput: bonds are always issued by governments or governement - sponsored organizations for a limited period of time. they may be issued as : ( 1 ) public issues like the present indian railways 6 % and 5.75 % issues. ( 2 ) government bonds. ( 3 ) corporate bonds. the price of bonds is always fixed. they will always pay interest and not allow fluctuation in price. hence the right answer should be 4.\nSo the final bond answer is 4.\n\nInput:Why should people buy long term bonds rather than short term bonds?

It is used while extending the parent class from the child class and is used with the keyword `extends`. The keyword is usually called before the keyword `extends` and is then followed by a class name which is super class. The keyword `final` is used to denote variables that cannot be changed. This keyword is called to denote that the class variable mentioned in the parent class cannot be changed or overridden. For more such information and information related to the `Java` programming language, visit www.geeksforgeeks.org\n     **Explanation**\n     Following is an example that displays the usage of the keyword `super`. Here, a class named `A` is extending the class named `B` which is also known as a super class. \n     class A\n        {\n        \tprivate String x;\n        \tprotected String y;\n        \tpublic void printA()\n        \t{\n\t\t    \tSystem.out.print(\"  \"+this.x);\n\t\t    \tfor(int i =0; i < this.y.length(); i++)\n\t\t    \t\tSystem.out.println(\"-\"+this.y.charAt(i));", "answer": "A: drink tea"}

Electrons are the particle with the least mass of the element. A metal is an element that is characterized with metallicity and with a lattice structure. The atoms of a metal are tightly placed together in a crystal lattice, in a pattern that depends on the elements. The atoms all orient themselves together, and their outer electrons are freely available to move. When we bring the metal in contact with a neutral electrical conductor (like the rod made of plastic covered with aluminum foil), the current is created in that metal.When a metal is placed near an electric charge, electrons in the metal become excited. They gain energy from the electric field, resulting in an increase in their kinetic energy. The higher the temperature, the more kinetic energy these electrons have. This means that as the temperature increases, the number of electrons that become excited also increases. Eventually, some electrons will gain so much energy that they will escape from the metal. This happens when the temperature of the metal is high enough. The free electrons form a cloud near the surface of the metal. When external circuit is complete, the current flow between the electrodes.\n\nInput:  Is it possible to add 50 pounds of banana's to a 50 pound bag?\nAnswer:", "answer": "A: joy"}

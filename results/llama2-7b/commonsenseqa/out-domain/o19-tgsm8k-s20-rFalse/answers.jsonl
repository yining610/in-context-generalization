After opening the store, my dad realized that it wasn\u2019t a complete success at first, and he decided to open another store to make the business more successful.

I don\u2019t really want to be too confusing)\nOutput: I think both functions should be differentiable in the interval, however, the idea would be to show that as it is given that both functions are equal, and equal functions have the same derivative or derivative equal to zero.

There are 3 more t than c.\n           2. t + c = 29\n\n           3. Now 29 is half of 69 (66 + 3 = 69), so 29 = 3 * 9.\n           4. From this we know 29 = 9 (29 has 9 in it and if you group them into 2's, 9 is twice as much).\n\n           5. Now, t = 31\n           6. c = 35\n2.

My friend said that since I had my birthday in that month I should try eating at one restaurant for my birthday. However, I knew that the minimum wage in my city has risen 50 centers in the past two months, so I should go to the restaurant with the most expensive menus and eat there. I also knew that many fast food chains opened recently in the central part of the city and had not yet gained much popularity. I was told that the fast food chains were usually cheaper for students. I was also concerned about the fact that the food in those fast food chains was not healthy, so I would not be able to eat there as often as I would like. I also had some allergies and it would be healthier to eat at a Chinese place that does not use beef instead of a fast food chain that uses beef. I have about $100 left on my savings account and I want to save as much as possible. All of these things were on my mind when I started planning my monthly budget. I need $24 in order to eat out and $40 can help me with eating at home. This means that $64 can get me through other expenses such as bills, clothing, and books. However, it does not mean that I will be able to find something for free. The restaurant with the biggest menu will be the best choice. I can afford it if I use the money from my savings account and the other $24.

{"text": "C\n\n### Explanation:\n- We used \"birthday\" to determine if a number was divisible by 3 or not. For example, if the number is divisible by 3, the next digit (after the zero, if present) must equal 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. Thus, if we have a number (n) that is divisible by 9, then (n mod 3) == 0. We repeat this process, checking first that n is divisible by 12, then 3 by (n mod 12) == 0, then checking if n is divisible by each digit. For example, if n = 16, then 12 | 16 == 0 (because 12 is evenly divisible by 16), so (n mod 13) == 0, which means (n mod 45) == 0, so (n) mod 45 == 0. Thus, (x mod 0) == 0. By using x = 13 mod 0 (assuming the condition that the denominator is divisible by 8400), we can find the answer to the original question.\n- This time, we used \"birthday\":\n```\nif(x mod 12)!= 0 or (x mod 12 == 0 and x mod 45 ==0 and x mod 20!= 0 and (x mod 79) == 0 and (x % 8400) == 0): return 1 else return 0\n```\nand we made the assumption that x is divisible by 59, which can be broken down into 4 * 5.\n- We used the following if conditions:\n```\nx is divisible by 7\nx mod 2 = 0\nx mod 13 = 0\nx is divisible 5\nx mod8  = 0\n```", "answer": "B: old people's home"}

The score for each test is not the total number of questions (7) x the total number of correct answers (X = sum score). The score for each test will be equal to the total number of questions, X, in the test.In short, each test is a single question with multiple choices and there is always 1 question present in the test.If we look at question 1, we can get the answer by subtracting the summation of scores of all questions from the total question:7 - (7 + 8 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 9 + 7 + 10 + 7) = 67 - 65 = 2This implies that the total value of X is 2 (in question 1).If we assume that the X value for question 2 is 6, then we can calculate that the total value of Y would be 6 + total X (in questions 1 and 2) = 6 + (2 = 8)If Y is 8 and the total X is 2, then the total value of scores is 8 + X and it will be 8 + 2 = 10.This means that the total summation of scores", "answer": "B: less confusion"}

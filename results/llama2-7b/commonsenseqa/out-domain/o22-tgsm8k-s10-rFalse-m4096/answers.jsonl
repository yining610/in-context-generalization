{"idx": 620, "text": "C\n\n### Solution\n\n## Instruction: \n1. Use any of Python's built-in data structures like lists of tuples to keep a track of the time and the value for each question.  For instance, a list of two items, where each item carries some data will do as there is no particular order of input.  For example if you have a question regarding the time to fill a container by two people, then you may keep a tuple for each person where the question carries the time and the answer.  We just need to have the two time tuples or something else like a List of tuple where every item contains the time and the answer, then we can filter out the questions we have answered based on that.  Then we just keep a count of the number of questions we have answered.  However, if you have a huge set of questions to be answered and the values/time of solving that question is also a time that we need to compare, in that case you can either store that time using strftime or keep any other such method where we can extract time from an item and compare.  Finally, we can keep all the values in a dictionary with keys of the questions to be answered and values the tuples.\n2. Once you have your system ready, you can just use a for loop and a simple if loop to ask all the questions and answer those which are yet to be answered.  You will be comparing the answer with the result, but it will be the time taken which will be most efficient as answered question can be used to skip the question which answers already are known.  If you need some other time based thing to be saved, then you can do so using dictionary to save the time. \n\n## Example: \nLet's say that I have a test of 10 questions, each with 4 answer choices, for example.  Given the number of choices for each question and the fact that you are provided with the actual time consumed by your answer, you can ask this in various ways as follows : \n```python\nfrom random import *\nfrom time import *\n\nnum_questions = int(10)\ntime_spent = 50\n\nfor i in range (num_questions, -1, -1):\n    question = randint(1, 4), answer = (randint(1, 3))\n    tuples = (question", "answer": "E: heat up"}

{"idx": 782, "text": "B\n\nAnswer:\nIn the previous question, I've been thinking that you ask the person which of the four words is stored in which place, but actually in the question, you just ask how many places. So you don't need a guess answer, all you need here is that it's 5 (or 6), which means there are 5 or six places.\n\nThere seem to be four questions, but actually there's only one question, just answer D. Let us list your answer choices.\n\n   A: attic  \n\nWhen the person says A, if you can infer correctly, there's only a small chance the person will answer A (at least, the way I interpret the question). So, you should guess B or C (to make sure you don't miss anything). And you can rule out B because you already have the answer C.\n\n   B: basement  \n\nWhen you answer A and C, B can't be the answer because you already have the three answer that contains the \"basement\"\n\n   C: art show  \n\nWhen you have C as answer (the case), the most likely (that you've missed A or B), and also, when the person gives \"Art Show\", don't you think it's the easiest word to remember and gives the question? So, even if the person doesn't give you clues, I should answer A or C.\n\n   D: church  \n\nAgain, the question, as we have seen, does not give us the actual words, only the number of places (6). And it happens often that you ask a question, and the person gives you the answer (if they are answering). So, the easiest guess is D.\n\nAnswer:\nI've solved this. When doing these types of questions, you have to think of this way. If you give two answer choices, one word is a synonym of the other, and the other is not. Here, the meaning of \"wine\" in A(attic) is the same as B(basement), the meaning of \"bar\" in A is the same as C(church).\n\nIn the other hand, the meaning of B(basement) and D(church) are the same, the meaning of C(church) and E(bar) are the same.\n\nThere are", "answer": "B: basement"}

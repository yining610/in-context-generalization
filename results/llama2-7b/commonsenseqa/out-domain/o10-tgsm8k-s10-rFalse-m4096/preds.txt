When you are learning math, you have a well defined set of facts.  They are well defined, because other people who have learned the same math agreed on them.  Agreement in mathematical concepts are built up over time through thousands of years of cooperation.  When you learn math, you often memorize sets of facts, and can apply them automatically.  If you memorize and understand 100 basic math facts, you can generally do most math problems you run into. <n><n>When you learn a language, people who have learned it before disagree on which facts are important, some facts are more important than others, and some are considered more important than they actually are.  The process of learning a language is much more like learning history than it is like learning math.  We don't have thousands of years to agree on which set of facts we think are important.  The facts constantly change based on technology, and what those who previously agreed were important. We have to be willing to challenge previously accepted ideas, and be capable of thinking out of what most people would consider to be our comfort zone; even to the point of being willing to challenge what most others consider to be common sense.<n><n>If you think in terms of what other people think is common sense, you'll be unable to think out of the box, and this will lead you to make more mistakes in your approach to language, and not less; especially in the beginning. It takes time to learn, but you need to be willing to learn new things, and be willing to challenge what many would consider to be common sense in order to do so.<n><n>It is the people who are willing to challenge what others consider to be common knowledge, and do things differently than they are "supposed" to be done that have been rewarded with success.<n><n>### Instructions:Read the question.<n><n>You have to be willing to be a little uncomfortable, and consider many things.<n><n>### Your answer:<n><n>## Instructions:Complete the sentence.<n><n>The biggest mistake newbies tend to make in the first month of learning a language is....<n><n>### Your Answer:<n><n>Challenging the unchallenged, questioning what others say is wrong, and being willing to apply your logical reasoning.<n>

Choices:  A: airport B: gotham city C: london D: city E: gas stations<n>Output:		 A<n><n>### Solution<n><n>- The two values you are interested: the number of calories (from food or water) and exercise minutes (from lifting weights, warming up, and cardio). The number of calories is given by `1000*(0.38 + 0.58*20)`. Notice that `20` here is in `20% of hours in a week`. The number of cardio minutes is given as `20*0.20`, assuming that `20% of cardio time in a week` and `1/5 of weightlifting time in a week` can be combined together. Let's look at the total number of calories and exercise minutes.  <n><n>- The total number of calories is `34(20*0.38)+22(20*0-200). 36`. Similarly, the total number of exercise minutes is 36 `(20+12)*0.2+6*(0.3+0.5)`. Now we solve for `480`, which is the amount of fuel cost by each of the drivers (a total of two drivers).  <n><n>- I am not sure how this question is put together.  However, we will assume that `number of goals scored in a season against Barca by 2 players` is `20%`.  We need to get the number of goals scored by each of the two players. For `20% for n goals`, we can get for `number of goals scored by each player` by `n*(100/20)`.  In this question, `n` is equal to `300` (total number of goals scored) and 2/3 is equal to `100/22`.  Therefore, the number of goals scored during the last season by each player is `2*(100/30+100/3)`. Now we solve for 30 by plugging in the value.  <n><n>-  The number of fluid ounces and cups is equivalent. When calculating the number of ounces, 1 ounce = 29 ml. Now we need to calculate the total number of ml by using the total number of fluid as `5*12+64`.  Then we convert this to `12

If you guess correctly, you regain one apple.<n><n>#### Instracution:<n><n>Write a program that plays a game of guess apple, where each player has 5 tries to guess the number of correct answers. When the player guesses wrong for the first time, they lose an apple. After that, they regain 1 apple for each correct guesses, and lose an apple for each incorrect guess. Write this program as a set of functions:<n>- A function called init with 3 parameters: a list of people, a list of guesses(a vector), a list of apples(a vector).<n>- A function to guess with 3 parameters: guess (a guess), number (a correct count of correct guesses), apples remaining (the count of apples remaining).<n>Function init gets a list of people(vectors of strings) that represents the guest list, and an array that represents the given guesses(vector of int), and a list of aces (vector of int) that represents the number of each apple remaining (vegetable) for each player. For 5 guesses, the 0th apple must exist and the 4th apple need to be empty after game initialization.<n>- A function that guesses with 3 parameters guess (vector of int), number (integer), apples (integer).<n>Function guess gets a vector of int that contains guess, along with a value of the number of count (0 to 4). This function returns a Boolean value of true or false.<n>- Finally, write a function that checks the winner. This function returns the name of the player who wins. This should evaluate the guessed number in the list of guesses given to this function, and then it should go through each element in that list and subtract the number of apples from each player that have guessed that exact number. If that list is empty, it should return the name of the player with the highest amount of apples. Otherwise, it should return the player who has guessed the exact number of apples.<n>Examples (for 5 guess

{"text": "D\n\nIn order to solve these problems, you will need to implement a binary search technique. The input is an array (usually a number of items). \nYou need to determine where this item falls by running through a binary search algorithm. For example, the binary search algorithm for the array [30,36,42] would be finding the largest number less than or equal to 36, so we can find the lower bound and upper bound as,  [30,32]. Since 32 is a number less than, but equal to 36 then that is not the answer. The next lower bound of 32 is 30, so we can eliminate that answer leaving us with either 42, or 36. 42 is not the answer, so we have successfully found the item.\n\nThe output is determined by which case it falls into, (A, B, C, or D). For example, if you had this array [2,3,5] then your A will be 2(A: items less than the lower bound) your C will be 5(C: items greater than the upper bound), your B will be 3(B: items equal to the lower bound), and your D is the correct answer.\n\nIn this case, your arrays will each consist of a list of items such as [36, 42, 50, 85, 133, 134, 195].\n\nYour function signature will be defined like so: void solve(int[], char[]); with the input as an array of type 'int' and the output as a char array.\n\n### \ud83d\udc49 Solution: \n\n```java\npackage example2;\n\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class Solution {\n\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\t\t Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\n\t\t char[] a = ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D');\n\t\t int[] b = new int[10] { 36, 40, 50,55, 80, 130, 133};\n\n\t\t solve(b,a);\n\n\t}\n\n\tpublic static int findBinSearch(int[]", "answer": "A: washing machine"}

A function is like a method that you write in Python; you call the function and it produces a certain result each time. A function that takes inputs is called a **funtion that accepts input**.  The way that you will create these functions is that you will define the function in a special format, containing your inputs within curly braces.  The following function takes a number called `num1` and `num2` as its input, and it returns the larger of the two numbers. This is often called a conditional.\n\nHere is an example of returning the smaller of two numbers, which would be called a conditional.\n```\ndef smaller(num1, num2):\n  return num1 if num1 <= num2 else num2\n```\n\n### Instructions:\n1)Define a function called smaller\n2)Define 3 parameters to the function:\n   - num1\n   - num2\n   - return\n   - end\n3)Write the function\u2019s definition, with its 3 parameters, but also the return and the end\n4)Write 3 instances of a program where you call the function and test it out. If you input 2,3 and 15 as inputs, what is output? Hint: look at your definition, and the format your function needs to be.\n5)Write", "answer": "D: kind"}

In that case, 150 is the number of pages that Huey plans on reading. He can read 15 pages without stopping. If he reads 1 page every 10 seconds without stopping, he can read 150 pages in 10 hours. Then, he goes to spend the money he has saved, which is $15 (1 times the cost of a bag of candy). With the $15 left over, he must buy $120 candy, 12 bags.\nBecause Pablo is checking out books by the page, he never reads more the the 150 pages for them. So, Pablo checks out 150 pages times 12.

{"text": "A\n\n### Solution:\n### Answer\nIn order to solve this task, I have used brute force method that iterates through all the possibilities of solving the equation. Since there is no solution given in this task I have used 3 different cases\n\nCase 1: First one is that there is no answer since the equation is undistuable\n\nCase 2: Second one is the correct answer, the sum of the ages has a remainder of 5 and their ages can be represented by (40-20-14) which =5 and therefore, the sum should be 120\n\nCase 3: The third case is invalid since the sum of the ages when subtracted from 40 has a remainder of 2 and their ages can only be represented by the number 12 which in turn is invalid\n#### Note:\nSome of us used trial and error methods to find the right answer. I have provided the methodology on how I solved this\n\n### Brute force approach\n#### Approach 1\nFirst, I have used the brute force approach to solve the cases. Here is the code snippet I have used for this task\n\n#### Approach 2\nSecond approach here is that I have used the brine method which is to solve the equation using the fact below\n\n\\(40-(20+1(age of Richard))=128-14+1(age of Hurley)\\)\n\nAs in case 2, I solved for all the possible values to find if there is solution or not.\n\n#### Approach3\nThe third approach here is the brine approach but I have solved by using the fact below\n`(40-(2*age))=40(1-1/(sum of ages))`\n\nAs mentioned in the challenge description, the only possible combination of age that will lead them to reach their combined age of 40 years from the current age is 14 years difference. The fact that I have used for this is the age relationship between the two numbers such as 14, in order to find the possible solution is to take all the possible 14's addition.\n\n#### Note:\nI have used the brine approach but with the constraint that age of Hurley cannot be less than age of Richard.

Hurley is 25 years old at 85 what is their combined age?\n\nStep 2: If there are rules of the problem then write them out (if there are none then move onto the process): I am adding two numbers to get the combined age in 40 years. I know Richard will also be 60 and Hurley will be 85\n\nStep 3: Explain how you solved the problem: I took Hurley\u2019s age and subtracted it from the number I needed for my problem (90 years). I knew that once I subtracted Hurley\u2019s age, the result had to equal Richard\u2019s age. I added 20 to Richard\u2019s age and got Richards age, 60 (20 + 85 = 105)\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the steps carefully - make sure it solves the problem: The steps clearly show that it solved the problem.

{"text": "I am not sure how you are defining a single thing when John is studying many things. But I think you are asking for the answer for option A. The correct option is B.\n\n### Input\nJohn is studying animals.  What is one of the places where they have to live? Choices: A: mountains B: rain forests C: deserts D: ocean E: woods\n\n### Response\n\nThe correct choice seems to be C. The options are not that hard if you don't look at the text.\n\n### Your Input:\nA restaurant is serving piles of potatoes cut into wedges. All guests at the table order a pile of potatoes and are charged $1.60 for it. The waiter takes $1.60 from the tip jar and puts it in the tip jar (this way there is $1.60 in tip money for every pile), then leaves the tip jar on the bar. Another waiter comes over and makes a mistake at the tip jar, adding $5 to the tip jar then taking $5 out. What will the waiter get as a tip?\n\n### My response\nThe solution is $4.\n\n### Note:\nThe question is worded incorrectly. When using a jar, a mistake would mean taking money out when in fact the original text says to add money from the tip jar.\n\n### Discussion:\nThe idea to approach it in this logic is to figure out how much is in the jar after each transaction.\n\n```\nThe jar has $x value to start, if y is taken out then there must be ${x-y} value in the jar. The 1.60 that the jar has is distributed evenly amongst the number of customers, so ${x}/y is the number of customers. So y must be ${x}/y.\nI guess the original author was thinking that 4 must be added to the jar and the rest must come out. But that's not the case. Instead it must have a value x+${x}/y where x must be taken out and ${x}/y must be put in. Then there would be ${x}/y available.\n```", "answer": "E: copulate"}

The word impossible has two meanings which is incapable of being accomplished or being able to do.

As for the possible versus the simple, the possibilities of what can be done is an array and anything that is done is simple.

As for what I am attempting to say, to solve this problem, there is a task and the only solution is a solution that will end the task. As for what is possible has two meanings, there is that fact that anything that has ever happened since time began is possible that anything that is now is possible is because it has already happened and the fact of that happening means it was impossible and now it can happen again.

{"text": "The correct answer is E. The wording of the question is ambiguous but the answer is nonetheless clear.\n\nIn general there is confusion between the words \"chair\" and \"chairs\" (although you could interpret the question as \"for which of these would people be sitting on chairs\"?), and there is also confusion between the word \"sit\" (a verb) and \"seat\" (a noun referring to a chair). I think the ambiguity was intentional.\n\nThe first question, \"Where would there be many chairs?\" is answered by A. A \"synagogue\" is a location in which many chairs would likely be found. If the question had simply said \"What is a synagogue?\", we can then say the correct answer is A, but it was not the intention of the question to ask about synagogues.\n\nIn the second question, the question is actually asking for the name of the place where there are many people sitting. The four places that are listed all contain the word \"chair\", and the correct answer is E, because it is the only place where in the question would the speaker describe \"chairs\" if talking about people sitting.\n\nTo make the question clearer, the question could have been written as \"Where would there be people sitting with their backs to a chair/chairs?\".", "answer": "C: synagogue"}

{"text": "Answer:\n\nD. The correct answer is D.  Glass that is untreated but not super strong is a regular glass.  Super strong glass is stronger than regular glass.  Fragile glass is untreated glass that is weak and may break easily and is more easily damaged.  When glass shatters, it can no longer be considered as regular glass and becomes fragile.  Glass that can take force and is untreated, such as glass from windows, is not very strong and would be classified as forceless.\n\n### Rationale:\n\nTo answer this question, we can look at the answer choices first. We can see all the answer choices are adjectives that describe various forms of glass.  Super strong will be a type of \nglass. The answer choice can be determined to be fragile since fragile glass is glass that is weak, and it has the word fragile in it.  Glass that has been forceless is weaker than glass that has been super strong.  The next options is glass that has not been strengthed.  This answer can also be ruled as regular glass since regular glass is what has not been strengthened and is not super strong.  If super glass is the strongest grade of glass, the glass that is not super strong should be classified as fragile, which it is.\n\n### Input : A box of cookies costs  $2.99 and there are 6 in a package.

Using this to solve, we can divide 25 by 11 and calculate approximately 2.28. As a result for 31 years subtract from 12 months we can estimate his wife to be 28 years old. When the couple will be having a baby in 11 years from now the woman must be at least 28 years. If the couple was under 21 to have children at their age they have to be married at least 30 years. If the man was at 31 years old and his wife was at least 25, he was at least 30 to have a child. So, the man was at least at 31 year old married to a woman under 25 is correct.", "answer": "E: inaccurate"}

There's a few ways to do this.  You could plug each number in.  Or you could use the mod and divide functions.  Let's think about what it means when Hurley is 19.

{"text": "A difference is defined to be the mathematical difference between the two numbers it represents. This can be thought of as the number that we subtract in order to make the two numbers equal and opposite. If we take this number, we have what is referred to as the absolute difference between the two numbers. The absolute difference is always a positive number.\n\nThe sum is defined to be the addition of two or more numbers together. The sum is also referred to as an additive property, since it is what we use in addition in order to compute it. The sum of two or more numbers can be thought of as their combined value, where no matter where the numbers start or end, they will always come together to form what is called an additive set.\n\nSince the sum of two numbers is the value of adding them together, these two values will always be different. When they are different, the sum is what we have when adding two or more numbers. Thus, when the answer is a sum, the numbers were taken and then added together.\n\nWhen we do addition, the sum can be either greater or less than the two numbers used together in order to form the addition. This is because any number or numbers can be used to form addition. For many, the sum will always be less than the two numbers. The two numbers are added to form the addition, and the sum is the final answer of the total that was used.\n\nThe sum of the numbers that are added to form an addition can always be the same as the addition formed if these numbers are all exactly equal.  However, in most cases, the sum will be much larger than or less than the actual addition. In this case, the difference is the final result of the addition. The difference is the result of subtraction.\n\nThe Likeness of two numbers is sometimes referred to as the difference between the sum of two or more other numbers. For example, the total number of items bought on an item sale is $4845 and there were two items sold at half price. The total of the sale is $4890. Thus, the number that was subtracted in order to make the total the same is $490. This is what is called the likeness of the number that was used.\nThis is different from the Sum and the Difference.\n\nThe Sameness of two numbers is what happens when two numbers are equal. For example, it can also be described as", "answer": "A: sum"}

{"text": "A\n\n### Explain:  A:  you will feel relaxed\n\n### Input\nWhat\u2019s the difference between the two exercises? Choices:  a.  b.  c.  d.  e.\n\n### Response\nA: one workout is 5 minutes before and the other 15 minutes after\n\n### Inputs:\nExplain how the solution to each instruction applies to the problem.\n\n### First Input\nRichard is 28 and Hurley is 16. Hurley is in high school and a senior. So, his is only one year younger. They want to be 100 years old by the time they\u2019re 50.\n\n50 + 100 = 150\n\n50\n\nThere are 10 years left. So they want to be 70 years old for their next 10 years until they're 100.\n\nThe difference between the two ages is 6.\n\nMultiply the 6 x 10 = 60\n\nSo there are 120 years between now and 100. Let's subtract 50 to get that 30 years. Then double 30 to find out how many years they are going to be 10 years from now. It is 60.\n\n### Second Input\nA group of 6 goes to the car wash. They each contribute $5 each to the initial cost of $35. They also plan to go in and do the job.\n\nThe job would be a total of $500. After the wash, they get $500 minus $50 they paid that they went in to work, so that leaves $450. So you take 450 and you divide it by 6, so that leaves them with each person owing $75. So $75 is each person being owed because they worked, plus they each owed the total amount plus the $5 they originally paid.\n\n### Third input\n\nHarper has 3 children and they each have different amounts that she pays for them. Harper needs to buy gift cards.\n\nShe gives each teacher their $70 and she only has $70.\n\nSo how much does she spend on", "answer": "B: exhaustion"}

{"text": "**E:**\n\n### Instructions:\nFor each question, provide two different pieces of supporting evidence that support your answer. Each of these supporting evidences should be statements and not a question.\n\n## 1. \n**E:** Communication is only possible when at least two parties are involved. You can\u2019t understand someone if you don\u2019t speak the same language they do. Even if you take away the language difference, communication can be challenging because a single mis-match in tone, eye contact or hand gesturing can derail a conversation and cause unnecessary frustration. \n\n## 2.\n#### Answer:\n**B:**\n\n#### Supporting evidence:\nLanguage skills are the single largest contributor to the quality of a tourist experience. The better the language skills, the less likely a tourist is to experience communication problems, such as mis-understandings, mis-interpretation, frustration with locals, or headaches from over-thinking or miscommunications. For example, in some countries, \"hello\" is used as a greeting during conversations such as when being served at the counter of a hotel restaurant. Some tourists use the same word to greet a shopkeeper, which may result in the shopkeeper not responding. A tourist could have been greeted with \"hello\", responded to the greeting, and continued to speak to a shopkeeper before realizing he/she didn\u2019t speak English.\n\n#### Supporting data:\nLanguage proficiency has become a significant factor in determining which cities are attractive to tourists. A recent survey showed that Spanish speaking visitors to a location are more likely to experience positive service and positive impressions of its people than visiting American tourists who don\u2019t communicate with those they engage with in their everyday lives.", "answer": "C: frustration"}

{"text": "I was able to search through many search engines that would give me a list of synonyms that might help me as I'm researching. The ones that might also fit the bill are confusion, complications, riot, and arrest. That still does not tell me for sure. In the dictionary, civil action is defined as the action of taking someone to court if they have committed a crime or injustice. It is almost synonymous with the word sue. You can't call someone to court and have them arrested on a civil issue. It would be a criminal offense. When you search for things that might be synonymous for arrest, you come up with other words like detain, stop, hold, and apprehend. These only work when I am trying to find when the legal system is taking control of someone, so that they can question them or force them to answer a certain question. None of these apply though because the legal system only gets them in that situation or control because of an investigation that has already happened. It doesn't work like that when I am civil. I have an issue and I want to talk to the person and understand what it is. The legal system isn't even involved until it is decided that I am actually in the right. This doesn't happen until they look at everything to see if the action I took was a civil or a criminal action. I'm saying that I'm wrong when you think that I might take it to court. We can't have a civil action if I think that the lawyer might not be able to win. They have to agree that there is a civil issue, and that my lawyer knows the correct way to make a case out of it. When they decide that there is, my lawyer can make a case of it. This doesn't mean that there is a civil action, but it does mean that I might take what has already happened to the court and it will be considered an argument that is valid. All we are saying is that there is a reasonable argument on my side. The lawyer would be looking to see if it is too outrageous to be thought about. It doesn't matter too much about civil and criminal if everything is made up of a legal dispute. We can ask questions that are reasonable, and then we can use them to talk about how to prevent the criminal from happening.

Check for the number of digits. For example, \"1101\" has 4 digits, \"111101\" contains 12 digits, and so on. The above example contains only 8 digits. It can be expressed as \"111111\", \"1111\", etc. but 11110 = 8101 as base 2.  \n\n### Solution:\n\nCheck for 1's and 0's only, there can be no empty space. A base 2 number is not 2 digits long. Example 1111 always equal to 1, no matter what base you have. So, in this case we have 1 digit, and the sequence goes on. \"10\" is still 1 digit.\n\n## Requirements\n\n[Click here to see the requirements.](Requirements.md)\n\n[Click here for the solution.](./solutions.md)\n\n# 4. 5.\n\n# 4th week summary\n\n![5th day weekly progress.jpeg](./5thDay.png)\n\n| Date    | Problem | Time |\n------- | ------- | -:-- |\n[4.4](./problems/fourthweek4.md)        | 3.2             | 01:54:09.539 |\n[4.5](./problems/4.5.md)   | 4              | 00:12:14.591 |\n[4.6](./problems/6.md)        |          |  00:15:07.051 |", "answer": "A: drill"}

This is what makes the mother confused on what you both said and what your favorite dessert is.\n\nThe fave in the second and third question is not a dessert as the first 3 but is a dinner. That's what makes the mother confused of what and who said what. As you will see we both said the same, but it's about two people and 2 dinners.\n\nThe word 'dinner' is the same as the word 'Fave' in the second and third questions.

E) gravity\n\n### Input: There were 4 dogs in the park. 43% of them were barking.\nHow many of the dogs were barking?\n\n### Response\n\nThe difference in answers between the solution and the student's solution indicates an opportunity to discuss the solution with the student.  In the example above, the student responded with \"8\".\n\nThe solution is (4x0.43) + (4-x)/100 = 1.72.  Thus (4x0.72) or 3 dogs were barking.  We can use the expression x+y=4 to determine the minimum value of y that will produce a possible solution.  For x=4, the minimum value of y is one.  Thus 43% of the dogs were bobarking.\n\nIf we assume one of the dogs is barking and (4 x.43)  or (3.43) is less than the value the student chose, 43% of 4 or 1.72, then the student's answer would be correct.  If we assume 43% of all of the dogs were borking, we then have an inequality that can be simplified and x is given by\n\n```\nx = (4x0.3 x1.\n```\n\nwhere x is approximately 4.

In every question, they're always comparing 2 variables/amounts so that means we have to use an arithmetic operation for it \n- In question 4, it would work if the denominator and the numerator was the same. If there's a difference in number of pages, the amount of money saved would be different. So, I need to change it to make it easier to solve.\n\n### Method II\n\nInstruction is about numbers, so we can use math. The only requirement of this method is to learn basic multiplication/division and find the difference between two numbers.\n\n### What's important here?\n- Read carefully to learn how much the task is asking.\n- You have to be very specific if you are working with money, because sometimes, words are ambiguous.", "answer": "B: feel more comfortable"}

{"text": "A:Compliments.If a person is competent in their schoolwork, they will most likely get compliments from their peers or teachers, as they will have achieved good grades. In addition, if a student excels in a subject, they may even receive an award or recognition from their teachers, which is a proud moment for any student. Thus, competence in schoolwork is highly likely to bring positive recognition from people around them.\n\n### Input\nInput:A man is paid $12 per hour plus a raise of 10%.  One week he has more work and his boss gives him $1 extra per hour to put in extra work one day. How much did he make that week.\nAnswer 163.15.\n\n### Response\nA. This task asks us to calculate the total amount of money a man earned that week, as the boss gave him a raise of 12%, in addition to the extra 1 dollar earned per hour on the extra day of work.\n\nSo, we initially figure out the amount earned from the main work, which is 12 dollars multiplied by 35 hours. Then, we can calculate the raise received, which equals (12 x.10) x 35. In this calculation, the 35 hours represents a 4 hour day and 2 extra hours. This final value (4.6) is the number the man receives per each extra hour, resulting in a total of an additional $11.04. Lastly, total amount earned is the sum of the previous two which yields to $12.14 per hour plus $12.04 as the raise.\n\nThe result given in the question ($10000) represents 256 hours, or 11 days. From this, we can know that week consisted of 4 40-hour weeks plus 1 20-hour week. We simply sum all of the 52-hour contributions to get 256 hours. After applying the raise to each individual paycheck, the result comes out to be exactly $12.18 per hour.\n\n### Comment", "answer": "B: passing grade"}

{"text": "#### Option A is correct\n\nThe most common reason why someone would use IVF is for reproducing when they have infertility issues. Some of the fertility issues can be problems with the sperm, problems with the women's ovaries, or problems with both parties. Invitro fertilized eggs are used to solve these problems. The egg is inseminated through IVF and fertilized in a lab.\n\n#### Option B is incorrect\n\nChildren from invitro fertilized couples can be at a greater risk for certain conditions that natural babies wouldn't necessarily be prone to like cystic fibrosis. These kids are also usually at a higher risk for cancer and birth defects, though the risk is minimal. Overpopulation is not a result of couples having an invitro birth.\n\n#### Option C is incorrect\n\nInvitro Fertilization doesn't necessarily result in a larger family. It just makes it possible, that through infertility issues, a family can get pregnant.\n\n#### Option D is incorrect\n\nA baby is a by product of the process.\n\n#### Option E is incorrect, since it is a medical term and is a process and is not an item.\n\n### Input\n\nWhat is an example of a good question to ask on a first date?

{"text": "### Choice  D \n### Explanation:\n### Explanations:The answer to the question is D (excellent). We can find this through context clues from the questions. The first section states that Sally took a certain medication, which caused severe side effects to her.  The doctors could not determine a cause for these side effects.  We know that if they could not determine a cause, this must mean that we choose excellent since the options are distinguished, marked, peculiar, and excellent. We want to avoid ambiguity, so we want to choose the option that will cause the least ambiguity here. Since this question does not specify exactly what the side effects were, the ambiguity would come from if the side effects were good. \"Excellent\" would be the best choice since it would eliminate a negative outlook, leaving a positive connotation about the side effects.\n\n### Input  :  Three numbers are subtracted from a number. The first number subtracted from the number is even. The second number subtracted from the original number is 10. The sum of the original number minus the third number is 87. Find the original number. Choices:  A. 76 B. 81 C. 99 D. 91 E. 44\n\n### Response  :\n### Choice   A \n### Explation:\n### Reason:The order of the operations must start with the greatest operation first and then the lowest. Since the question states that the first value is even and the second value is 10, we know that an even number must be the number we subtracted from the original. This means that we first must subtract the even number from the original.  We can easily plug in the numbers in the second part of the question, where it states 87 minus the subtraction of the third number, which is 81 minus the first number, which has to be 76. The final answer is 87 minus 76 = 1.  We found that the original number is 97.\n\n### Example :\n### Instruction : Two people share the cost of a computer tablet and plan to split the cost evenly.

The input is an array (usually a number of items). <n>You need to determine where this item falls by running through a binary search algorithm. For example, the binary search algorithm for the array [30,36,42] would be finding the largest number less than or equal to 36, so we can find the lower bound and upper bound as,  [30,32]. Since 32 is a number less than, but equal to 36 then that is not the answer. The next lower bound of 32 is 30, so we can eliminate that answer leaving us with either 42, or 36. 42 is not the answer, so we have successfully found the item.<n><n>The output is determined by which case it falls into, (A, B, C, or D). For example, if you had this array [2,3,5] then your A will be 2(A: items less than the lower bound) your C will be 5(C: items greater than the upper bound), your B will be 3(B: items equal to the lower bound), and your D is the correct answer.<n><n>In this case, your arrays will each consist of a list of items such as [36, 42, 50, 85, 133, 134, 195].<n><n>Your function signature will be defined like so: void solve(int[], char[]); with the input as an array of type 'int' and the output as a char array.<n><n>### 👉 Solution: <n><n>```java<n>package example2;<n><n>import java.util.Scanner;<n><n>public class Solution {<n><n>	public static void main(String[] args) {<n>		 Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);<n>		 char[] a = ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D');<n>		 int[] b = new int[10] { 36, 40, 50,55, 80, 130, 133};<n><n>		 solve(b,a);<n><n>	}<n><n>	public static int findBinSearch(int[]

Choices:  A: disengenious B: human C: weird D: kind E: stupid<n>Output:		A<n><n>In each of these exercises, you will need to decide what the output of a program should be, and you’ll also decide what the input should be. You can always use trial-and-error to see the input/output pairings for your code.<n><n><n>### Instruction #2<n><n>In the next few practice exercises, you’ll see some additional challenge in the input/output descriptions. For example, in Exercise 7, the question is, “What is Robert’s favorite vegetable?”. Here’s how you might expect to approach this problem.<n><n>Given:<n>- The ages of Robert, Lance, and Mika are all different numbers<n>- Given the name of each boy: ‘Robert’ or ‘Lance’ or ‘Mika’<n><n>Output:<n>- Robert’s favorite vegetables<n>- Lance’s favorite vegetables <n>- Mika’s favorite vegetables  <n><n><n>This exercise and the next will introduce the concept of defining a function. A function is like a method that you write in Python; you call the function and it produces a certain result each time. A function that takes inputs is called a **funtion that accepts input**.  The way that you will create these functions is that you will define the function in a special format, containing your inputs within curly braces.  The following function takes a number called `num1` and `num2` as its input, and it returns the larger of the two numbers. This is often called a conditional.<n><n>Here is an example of returning the smaller of two numbers, which would be called a conditional.<n>```<n>def smaller(num1, num2):<n>  return num1 if num1 <= num2 else num2<n>```<n><n>### Instructions:<n>1)Define a function called smaller<n>2)Define 3 parameters to the function:<n>   - num1<n>   - num2<n>   - return<n>   - end<n>3)Write the function’s definition, with its 3 parameters, but also the return and the end<n>4)Write 3 instances of a program where you call the function and test it out. If you input 2,3 and 15 as inputs, what is output? Hint: look at your definition, and the format your function needs to be.<n>5)Write

In that case, 150 is the number of pages that Huey plans on reading. He can read 15 pages without stopping. If he reads 1 page every 10 seconds without stopping, he can read 150 pages in 10 hours. Then, he goes to spend the money he has saved, which is $15 (1 times the cost of a bag of candy). With the $15 left over, he must buy $120 candy, 12 bags.<n>Because Pablo is checking out books by the page, he never reads more the the 150 pages for them. So, Pablo checks out 150 pages times 12. The 12 pages must have been in books totaling 150 pages, meaning the books Pablo takes 12 times 150 = 1800 pages.<n>The six friends need to buy a car with the cost of $1700.

Hence, we take the difference of 20 years + Hurley's age and get an answer of 128 if Hurley is 12 years old. If you thought up the Hurley answer, the following answer for "Mother Hurley" should be obvious.<n><n>The second example is just counting pages that is $150, divided equally among $6 equals $25/page. That's easy. Adding $15 was easy because we have $3 candy left over and we know that $3/150 = 2 cents per page of reading. That's easy peasy.<n><n>The third example was a bit tricky only because it was easy to calculate the price after the

Choices:  A: hole B: television C: sporting goods store D: pool table E: sporting event<n>Output:		C<n><n>### Explanation<n><n>My explanation for how I solved this is very simple. I used my basic knowledge of 2020 python coding. I started coding by first making sure that there are no errors in my syntax. Then I made sure that it fits the specifications for the test question.<n>Once I confirmed of the accuracy of the program, I created questions to test my functionality. I did a small loop with some random numbers. By testing my program, I would be able to see what the correct answer is.<n>A few things that I got to take away from this question is that when coding, if you follow the steps of your project before you start coding, it'll be easier for you to figure out something that does not work. You also should take the time to test your function with several different inputs and outputs.<n>

You will have both stacks from the same input file. Each line in the input file is a single number, and each number indicates a number of items to process (for example, ‘9’ would indicate to subtract 9 items, in case you are wondering). You will have exactly two stacks of items. There will never be any more or less than two. Both stacks consist of the same items - that is, no items will ever be in both stacks from the input file. Your two stacks contain the exact same number of items at the end of the input. That is, both stacks are of the same length, and if you multiply the lengths of the stacks, it equals the inputs (if you multiply them by 9 as in the above example).<n><n><n>Input:<n>Stack1:<n>65, 142, 25, 27, 37, 74, 5, 2, 23, 5, 6, 154, 195<n><n>Stack2:<n>145, 62, 48, 19, 48,<n>Output:<n>28, 71<n>```<n><n>## Instructions:<n><n>Write a program that will calculate if the stack will be 1, 2, or 3 items after all the processing is completed.<n><n>## Source code<n><n>```<n>	/* Calculate the final number of items in each stack */<n>    int countForEachStack = 0;<n>	int tempStack;<n>    for(int i=0;i<stack1.length();i++){<n>		tempStack = stack1[i];<n>		for(int j=0;j<=i;j++){<n>

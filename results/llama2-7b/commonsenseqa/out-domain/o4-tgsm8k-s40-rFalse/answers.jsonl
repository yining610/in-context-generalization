If you buy two movies at that rate every night, how long will it take to afford your own movie theater?\n\nAnswer: 720 days. $84 in the first place to begin with, and $1.6 is the average each movie that makes it to 7 days.

They have a fixed rate, so they will have 53 more days before the next theater will be started.\n\nThus 37 days a movie, plus the 53 days that you will get from it. This is 84-80 or $84 spent.

That would be more likely to occur after the driver involved in the car accident was arrested and sent to jail.\n\n### Input:(1) I asked two of my friends to watch my cats. I wanted to know if one or more would show up. I put the name of my four cats on one card and the names of my two friends on another. When I chose a card, whatever two names I got were the ones I was going to watch. (2) The first card I pulled had my cat\u2019s name and one of my friend\u2019s names. I was disappointed because I still had to look for my other two cats. (3) The second card I pulled had my two cats\u2019 name and one of my friends\u2019 name. I was pleased because I would not have to go find my cat. (4) I asked a third friend to watch my two cats. I was concerned because two had already been found and I only had one cat left.\n\n### Response:(1) If you knew who was watching your cats beforehand, how could you be disappointed that you had to find your other two cats?\n\n### Solution:\nYou asked two friends to watch your cats, so you had no way of knowing which names would be on the cards once you pulled out cards. Therefore, you do not know who was going to watch your cat until you pull your cards. Therefore, you would be disappointed if you found your other two cats, because you would still not know which cards you pulled that day and you would have to look for your cat once again.\n\nThe same logic applies to the second card, where you found one cat and your other friend. Since you still didn't know which card you pulled and your other cat was already found, you cannot be pleased.\n\nWith a third friend watching your two cats, you have already found both of your cats from the first and second cards. However, since you do not know who will watch your cats and you have already found both, you cannot be concerned that you would have to find your last cat again.\n\n### Question:Can the problem be solved if you have more than 8 cards?\n\n### Answer:\nYes, the problem can be improved by having more than 8 cards, depending on how the cards are generated.

{"text": "I see it is B the Neighborhood.\n\n### The given input instructions are meant to assist you with the problem. However, they aren't intended to direct you to any particular way to solve the problem. To be specific, an easy method to determine the number of Schnauer Puppies is to subtract 9 Doberman puppys from the total original number of puppies.\n\n### If the number of Dobernam puppys is 20, the answer is 55. Five less than the number will be subtracted from the number as the 20 minus five leaves 15 doberman puppys. In addition, five times 3 would result in the 15. It is important to add one to the number instead of subtracting one, since it is necessary to add on the remaining 10 of the number of 15. Finally, the answer would be 55 for the number of Schnurer puppys with 20 original Doberman pupps as the number.\n\n### There are two ways to calculate the number of puppys that Dr. Banks gave away in the busiest month: counting the months or multiplying the remaining puppys by a ratio of 2/3 after subtracting the number of toothbushes given away 53 in January and the number of toothbraches given away in February. To find the average number of toothbrachs Dr. Banks gave to his patients in March using months, divide the number of toothbrashes given away by the number of 12 (the months) minus 2 (the number of toothbrasshes given away in February). To find the average number given away in March using a ratio, multiply the remaining toothbracbes times one third, and then subtracting the number given away in February and the number given in January. Adding the number of toothbrasches given way in January and February would yield the number given during the busiest month.\n\n### To find the number left, the number subtracted needs to be added to itself, resulting in the double catch number.

{"text": "A\n\n### Input:[February is the best month because] March would [take a beating?]\n\n### Response:[February is by far the best month to get married, why?]\n\n## Solution:\nI wrote a function that receives the three parameters and returns the resulting amount of money if you were to sell all the seashells.  Each of the seashells were sold for $1.2 dollars, and the following equations were applied for the parameters `m`, `n`, and `k` respectively. \n\nFor `m`: The number of seashells picked on Monday,  `m = 30`\nFor `n`:The number of seashells you are going to give to your customers, `n = 230`\nFor k: The number of seashills you're going to give away, the number of Monday picks, `k = 30` \n\nSo, the resulting value of `n` after applying the above equations to the function `sum_sales` in the main function is:\n```js\n    sum_sales(30, 230, 30)\n```\nWhich, as you might remember from the beginning of the question, equals 54 dollars.\n\nNote:  This would have actually been the best way of solving the problem,  but I decided to simplify the equations by skipping the multiplication of `2.4` which would result in selling `20` seashells of which the amount would have been `20 * 3` seashells.  The equation above yields `54+ 20 = 54 dollars` which is what was stated in the question.\n\n## Feedback\n\nIf you are satisfied with my solution, please kindly choose it as the correct answer.  \n\nIf you have corrections, please kindly share them with me through the discussions.   \n\nIf I forgot to add a code that works correctly, please kindly suggest the implementation.", "answer": "A: outside"}

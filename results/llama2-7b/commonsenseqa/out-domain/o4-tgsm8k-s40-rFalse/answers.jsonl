That would be more likely to occur after the driver involved in the car accident was arrested and sent to jail.\n\n### Input:(1) I asked two of my friends to watch my cats. I wanted to know if one or more would show up. I put the name of my four cats on one card and the names of my two friends on another. When I chose a card, whatever two names I got were the ones I was going to watch. (2) The first card I pulled had my cat\u2019s name and one of my friend\u2019s names. I was disappointed because I still had to look for my other two cats. (3) The second card I pulled had my two cats\u2019 name and one of my friends\u2019 name. I was pleased because I would not have to go find my cat. (4) I asked a third friend to watch my two cats. I was concerned because two had already been found and I only had one cat left.\n\n### Response:(1) If you knew who was watching your cats beforehand, how could you be disappointed that you had to find your other two cats?\n\n### Solution:\nYou asked two friends to watch your cats, so you had no way of knowing which names would be on the cards once you pulled out cards. Therefore, you do not know who was going to watch your cat until you pull your cards. Therefore, you would be disappointed if you found your other two cats, because you would still not know which cards you pulled that day and you would have to look for your cat once again.\n\nThe same logic applies to the second card, where you found one cat and your other friend. Since you still didn't know which card you pulled and your other cat was already found, you cannot be pleased.\n\nWith a third friend watching your two cats, you have already found both of your cats from the first and second cards. However, since you do not know who will watch your cats and you have already found both, you cannot be concerned that you would have to find your last cat again.\n\n### Question:Can the problem be solved if you have more than 8 cards?\n\n### Answer:\nYes, the problem can be improved by having more than 8 cards, depending on how the cards are generated.

{"text": "I see it is B the Neighborhood.\n\n### The given input instructions are meant to assist you with the problem. However, they aren't intended to direct you to any particular way to solve the problem. To be specific, an easy method to determine the number of Schnauer Puppies is to subtract 9 Doberman puppys from the total original number of puppies.\n\n### If the number of Dobernam puppys is 20, the answer is 55. Five less than the number will be subtracted from the number as the 20 minus five leaves 15 doberman puppys. In addition, five times 3 would result in the 15. It is important to add one to the number instead of subtracting one, since it is necessary to add on the remaining 10 of the number of 15. Finally, the answer would be 55 for the number of Schnurer puppys with 20 original Doberman pupps as the number.\n\n### There are two ways to calculate the number of puppys that Dr. Banks gave away in the busiest month: counting the months or multiplying the remaining puppys by a ratio of 2/3 after subtracting the number of toothbushes given away 53 in January and the number of toothbraches given away in February. To find the average number of toothbrachs Dr. Banks gave to his patients in March using months, divide the number of toothbrashes given away by the number of 12 (the months) minus 2 (the number of toothbrasshes given away in February). To find the average number given away in March using a ratio, multiply the remaining toothbracbes times one third, and then subtracting the number given away in February and the number given in January. Adding the number of toothbrasches given way in January and February would yield the number given during the busiest month.\n\n### To find the number left, the number subtracted needs to be added to itself, resulting in the double catch number.

{"text": "A\n\n### Input:[February is the best month because] March would [take a beating?]\n\n### Response:[February is by far the best month to get married, why?]\n\n## Solution:\nI wrote a function that receives the three parameters and returns the resulting amount of money if you were to sell all the seashells.  Each of the seashells were sold for $1.2 dollars, and the following equations were applied for the parameters `m`, `n`, and `k` respectively. \n\nFor `m`: The number of seashells picked on Monday,  `m = 30`\nFor `n`:The number of seashells you are going to give to your customers, `n = 230`\nFor k: The number of seashills you're going to give away, the number of Monday picks, `k = 30` \n\nSo, the resulting value of `n` after applying the above equations to the function `sum_sales` in the main function is:\n```js\n    sum_sales(30, 230, 30)\n```\nWhich, as you might remember from the beginning of the question, equals 54 dollars.\n\nNote:  This would have actually been the best way of solving the problem,  but I decided to simplify the equations by skipping the multiplication of `2.4` which would result in selling `20` seashells of which the amount would have been `20 * 3` seashells.  The equation above yields `54+ 20 = 54 dollars` which is what was stated in the question.\n\n## Feedback\n\nIf you are satisfied with my solution, please kindly choose it as the correct answer.  \n\nIf you have corrections, please kindly share them with me through the discussions.   \n\nIf I forgot to add a code that works correctly, please kindly suggest the implementation.", "answer": "A: outside"}

The answer is true; a human will sit down to reproduce as part of a ritual of being seated on the ground and making love to another human.\n\n### Input\n\nSally is 5 times more powerful than Amy; Amy is 3 times stronger than Bob; and Bob is half as strong as Sally. Which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA. Sally is 7 times stronger than Bob.\n\n\n### Response\n\nThis is not right.\n\nAmy is 3 times stronger and Bob is \u00bd as strong. Amy is 1.5 times stronger than Bob. There are five times as many Bobs as Amy and Amy and Bob together are 2.5 times as strong as Sally who is 3 times stronger. So Sally is twice as strong as Amy and Amy is 1.3 times stronger than Sally.\n\n### Note: If you got the logic wrong, please write about how you solved it and what you got wrong.\n\n### Example response:\n\nI was a tad off from my calculation above because I got to confused with a \"whole\" number and \"half\" number. In the example, if Bob is half stronger than Sally we shouldn't do an integer division by 2 to find out Bob's rating. Bob is in fact, a quarter of Sally's rating and should be rated a 25/0.6 = 41.6 rating. Once you factor 1.3 into Amy's strength, you have your answer.

{"text": "We can make use of our math skills to answer this question.\n\nWe have a number of steps which will help lead us to the answer.\n\nI will walk through this for you, although you may be familiar with most if not all of these mathematical concepts, but just so no one walks away not knowing how to answer they\u2019re question.\n\n## Calculate the number\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the number of fish they have left.  So, we need to figure out what is left after the boat tipped over.  In this instance, that means we do the following.\n\nSince we know they initially caught 9 total fish, we can say that after the boat tipped, they lost 3, since it was a quarter of their entire total.  Therefore:\n\n9 - 3 = 6\n\nSince we know that initially Jordan had 4 and that now we lose 3, therefore:\n\n4 - 3 = 1\n\nAnd now we know that Jordan has 1 original fish, while Perry has 4.\n\nSo by now, Perry has 4, and Jordan has 1.\n\n## Make the comparison\n\nNow, that we calculated the number for Jordan and Perry, we need to make the comparison.\n\nComparing Jordan and Perry, we know that we originally had 9, and that now we have 6, so by default, Jordan has lost 3, and Perry still has 4, since they started with 4.\n\nThat is why Perry still has 4 and Jordan only has 1.", "answer": "C: lake"}

If 10 people eat one cheese, one pepperoni, one onion, one olives, and 1 sausage, and 2/3 are eating pizza, how many sausage is eating pizza?\nInstruction: Explain to a friend how to create a new variable to store the number of sausage eating pizza.\nDemonstration: The variable \"pizza_eaters\" equals 60, divided by four, which equals 15. Since the total number of people eating pizza is 15, we subtract seven since 7 = 1/4 of 29. This leaves 8, which must be one less than 9, so 8 minus 1 equals 7. If that variable is called pizza_eaters, that tells me that 7 people are eating one sausage each, which leaves 2 (8-1). So the second part of the instruction says: create new variable called \"sausage_eaters\" to store number 2.\n\n### Answer:\nSage is going to be in an art show at the Museum of Modern Art.

You now know what data you will have and what the goal is for that data. You then are able to get the rest of your \"game data\" when you have 26 down and then you can start playing the game. \n\n### B1, B2, B3, B4, B5\n\n1. It could", "answer": "A: water cooler"}

Certainly there are many things in life that are of an unattractive appearance. The difference is that in many cases the appearance of these \"unattractive things\" has the result of us liking them. We tend to feel that way about people who are of an unattended or unpolished appearance. The reverse is also true.

See the example in the syntax guide to see what this means.\n- Some questions will have multiple statements.   For example, if a program asks, \"what day of the week is next week?\"  the answer can be expressed in two statements \n  - first statement: `next-week: = input[weekday]+1`\n  - second statement: if `next-month>next-week`, `next-year = (next-month>next_week)`\n  - In this example next-week is the variable name, next_week is another name for the same variable, and weekday is the list of possible values\n- In a single statement, the statements can be separated by a semicolon or more often are separated by a space (but the following one won't have a space)\n- The first line of a program (the line that is first in the text editing window) is called the header.

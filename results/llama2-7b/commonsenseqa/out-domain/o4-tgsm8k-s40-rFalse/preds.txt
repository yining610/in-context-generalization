Liberty means equal opportunity for all in the exercise and enjoyment of the rights of life, liberty, and property." Unfortunately, he didn't think to define his terms, and so the class got to work asserting and defending the following rights: the right to ride the unicycle, the right to ride the bicycle, and the right to walk. A dispute arose, however, when some students insisted that one person should be allowed to monopolize all three, but when the class voted (76 in favor and 54 against), the matter was settled. That afternoon, the same professor began his next lecture by announcing his intention to define his terms. He said, "In pursuit of liberty it is necessary," he exclaimed, "to subdue our desires and keep our selfishness under control." Unfortunately, again he failed to define his terms. When, therefore, the students made the following rights for themselves: the right of the rich to vote, the right of the whites to own property, and the right of the Protestants to vote, the professor decided that if his students could define their own terms, surely he could too. That afternoon, he told his class, "These are the definitions of liberty, justice, freedom, property, and equality, which I have formulated. They are as follows: * Liberty = that which is exercised by one person on his own behalf, and that which is exercised on behalf of another. * Justice = that which is in accordance with established laws. * Freedom = that which is determined by established laws. * Property = that which is not in accordance with established law. * Equality = that which is determined without established laws." The students then began to defend their prior rights, but they no longer could. When the professor asked them how the rich could vote but the poor could not, they couldn't answer. They realized that the rich are allowed to vote because certain laws make it so.  The professor

Choices:  A: pool table B: toy box C: playroom D: park E: closet<n>Output:		B<n><n>#### Explanation:For this question, the answer comes from the 6th line. When we split that sentence using brackets and look for the only number it contains, we get the answer.<n>**Instruction:**Answer the following question that is based on a situation.<n><n>Input: The sales manager at ABC Company sold 730 airplane models to the manager of ACME Company. The sales manager wanted to give his customers a discount on the models he sold, but he did not know how many models were sold to ACME Company. So, he asked the manager of ACME company. When the manager of ACME told him that he had bought 712 models, the sales manager immediately made up his mind to offer his customer a 72 percent discount on the total price he paid. If the sales manager charged a total of $7100 to ACME Company, how much did the sales manager charge his customer?<n>Output: $6328<n>Input: Mr. Baker has an even dozen bakeries he owns.  After buying several bakeries from others, he now has a total of 15 bakeries.  How many bakeries did Mr. Baker buy from others?<n>Output: 10<n>Input: In a recent game of baseball, the Pirates scored one hundred and thirty-eight more runs than the Dodgers. In the same game, the Pirates had eight runs less than the total number of runs scored by both teams combined. If the Dodgers scored only three times as many runs as the Bucs, by how many runs did the Pirates score more than the combined total of all runs scored in the game? (Note: You must have the number of runs scored by the Pirates and Dodgers. You must perform one division operation.)<n>Output: 13<n><n>**Explanation:**For this question, we see two steps. First, we find the score difference between the Dodgers and the Pirates, then we subtract that from the combined score of both sides. We have already subtracted the running total of our score, but that's exactly what we were asked to do in the problem statement. This was a very difficult one, but we got through by following the problem statement.<n>

The answer is 36. Let’s see how we determine the value of a and b.<n><n>If we assume a=36 and b=26, then a+b-1 would equal 67. Then we know that a+b-1=67. Then what is one less than a+b-1? Well, that is an even number, so we should divide it by 2, which would equal 7, and that number is one less than a and one less than b. So we now know that a + b - a + b = 7.<n><n>Then we know that by subtracting a from both sides of the equation, which equals 7. And we know a=36, so then 36-7=29. Similarly, we know b-7=19, which means b = 26.<n><n>### Instructions: Answer the questions with your own thoughts. Do not use the help menu in MS-Word.<n><n>What is the smallest three digit number we can form using no digit greater than 3?<n><n>Explanation <n>First, we will subtract 0 from each of the digits, because 0 is a possible number that we can create in our digit and it will make it easier to create the perfect number. Next, we will subtract 1 from each of the digits to create the perfect number that is between 26 and 29.<n><n>Next, we will make each of the digits have a number greater than 1 and 3 and we will subtract 1 at a time to create the digits. Finally, we will remove all the 2 digits and add the numbers together to create 135.<n><n>### Tutorial:<n>

She gave away 53 in January, leaving a total of 277. She gave away 67 in February, leaving 210. In March, she gave away 46, leaving 164. In April, she gave away half of that, leaving 82. In May, she gave away the other half, 41.   So, in April and May, she gave away 93 more toothbrushs than in February. (c) Sally picks 10 less each day (on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday) than in the previous day, so we need 30 - 10 - 10 + 30 + 10 = 30 seashellers per day. On Thursday, she picksed 30 - 5 = 25, so on Friday she picked 30 - 25 = 5. She can make $1.20 * 30 = $36 when she sells all of the seashells on Friday. (d) On the way back to the shore, they caught half of the fish remaining in the boat. So, they still have 18 fish. (e) This may be the greatest question asked yet. "Village" is a noun, the opposite of a noun is a verb, and a noun is either in Africa or in Ohio - just one of many, many wrong answers.

The rules for coloring the cells are given after the passage.  Anita and Bob are having a typical day in school. In biology today, Anita's teacher told her to find the volume of a box. To find the volume, you need to multiply the height of the box by the width by the length of the box. Using your pencil and ruler, you must find the volume of the box as well as the length of the box, the width of the box, and the height of the box. Next, you need to add the volume and the length and subtract the height of the box to find the volume of the entire box. Now that you have found the volume of the box, you should find its color. If the box is the same color as the cell it will contain, it's brown. However, if the box doesn't contain any given material the box will be pink and you must color the cell gray. But you don't necessarily need to color the entire cell, because the box could contain one or more materials from each cell. If the material is the same as the given material, color the box the same color as that particular cell. If the material from each box is a combination of two or more materials, color that box gray. To answer the questions, color each cell according to its rules.<n>Output: <n><n><n>color = {BW = blue, F = cyan, A = brown}<n>1.What did you learn today in this class?<n>A. the volume of a box    <n><n>2.

Choices:  A: symphony B: band C: create music D: orchestra E: string quartet<n>Output:		Symphony<n>### Challenge Question(You only need to answer this for the first problem)<n>- How can you count the number of times the string "times" appears in the sentence and print its position in the sentence if it appears. For example, the string "times" appeared 3 times in the sentence "Ten times the number of times the number of times you divide by the number of x-es in xi equals nine will be the number of times the times you divide by x-es" and its indices were positions 1, 31 and 68 respectively.<n><n>### Solution<n>* 3. I have one index array and it contains the position that the string "times" occur.<n>```python<n>def find_times(S):<n>	times = 0<n>	times_ind = [None]<n>	for character in S: # Loop through each character <n>		if character.isdigit(): # Skip the characters that are not the index that the letter is in <n>			continue <n>		else:<n>			start_pos = times_ind.index(None)<n>			times_ind.insert(start_pos+1,times_ind.pop(start_pos))<n>			while character.islower(): # Skip lowercase vowels (a, e, i, o, u)<n>				ch = character<n>				character += 1<n>				if character.digit():<n>					break<n>			else: <n>				break # I've reached my end character now<n>				<n>			# Find position of the character. <n>			# Check only once as we know it is only 1 digit <n>			print(times_ind.index(ch)) # The print is here so I can check my value and make sure it is what I want it to be(print() is useless in terms of checking values <n>			times += 1 # I've added 1 to the index array above so that that will print 3 when I run it<n>				  # It means that I passed 3 times with the string "times" <n>		return character<n>```<n>And it works on this sentence where the string "times" can be found 3

The conditions are:<n>x &gt; 20 &amp; = 90<n>47 - 20 =  20<n>We know that the 2 conditions hold when x = 20 and y = 25 47 + 20 = 67<n>We can write this in a new linear equation:<n>2x + 25 + 20 + 47 + 67<n>x = -47<n>x &lt; 20 &gt; 90<n>-47 &lt; 25 4-47<n>= 243<n>-y = 25<n>= 2 -y = 25 -243<n>= -218 <n>So, 20 is the number of Dobermam puppies.<n><n>2.	The first month (Jan) is 53, the second month (Feb) is 67, so we know at the end of the 4 months we will divide the remaining count by 4 to account for the missing dooberman<n><n>So if we multiply the number of remaining by 4 we subtract 4 from the number of remaining we know the answer will be 36<n><n>3.	We know the condition<n>x + y = 54<n><n>We subtract 54 from both sides of the equation to get y = 500<n>Then 500 + x = 144<n>Since we know that x is at least 500 we can then subtract x from each side which simplifies our inequality<n>144-500 = -356<n>144-x = -356 which is represented as x + 120 - (356 +120)<n><n>x + y = (646 - 478)<n>= x+268<n>which simplifies to (30 -27)<n>y = 30-27<n>So from our first equation we know that x = 20 but y = 3<n><n>Finally, we take away the fish at our boat to get the remaining number.

However, due to the castle's incredibly powerful magic, the intruder was only ever seen as a shadow.  The king was concerned that the intruder was going to take over and asked one of his servants to bring the king's magic sword to him so he could protect his throne. Unfortunately, the servant didn't know the sword's location and it was nowhere to be found. The servant told this to the king and then, using his royal powers, the king caused a nearby servant to bring him the sword on a silver tray.

If he is 4 times as old as his wife, how old is he?<n>Output:<n><n>---<n>### Hints:<n>### 1) The first question is very easy because it is a very simple Maths problem. Just read the question carefully.<n>### 2) For the second question, we need to be more careful because it is a very hard Maths problem. In order to find the value of month b, we need to consider only when the two months are not consecutive months i.e., The first month would be January, If we take February month, we find out that in the second month, we need 67-53=14 or for the third month, we need (67-53) 14+14 =65 ToothBrushes.<n>### 3) For question 3, we would not be able to get exact answer to the question, if Dr. Banks has toothbrushes of two different number of toothbrushes and toothbrushes change their number every month, we can only find the approximate number of toothbrashes Dr. Banks has for any month. So now if Dr. Banks gives away (330-45+45+12) for the last two months which would be equal to 73 toothbrush. so, we find there are remaining 257 number of toothbrands after he gives these away. So the answer should be approximately 257.<n>

So, the minimum difference has to be 90 since we subtracted 40 from the number of puppies. Now, we need to find the difference between minimum and minimum = 90 - 50 = 40, which is Schnauzer and we are done.<n><n><n>In the second, Dr. Banks gave 180 toothbrush to his patients in August and 185 toothbrushes b/w February to June and therefore only 21 toothbrushes left to distribute in July.<n><n><n>Insist: Jordan and Perry took the boat out to the lake and Jordan caught 40 fish and perry caught another 80 fish, so total 120 fishes he caught, and we know that 50 fish were lost on the way back to shore. Therefore, total fish is 120-(50/4) = 106<n><n># Solution #<n>To find the answers to given questions, we had to first find the variables. The first question wanted us to find how many puppies and schnauzers are present.

This will be achieved in Python using `list` method `pop()`<n><n>**Notes to Remember:**<n>- `pop()` returns the element immediately taken out of the list. It is generally used to remove the last elements from the list in a loop.<n>- Since the element is in an array, the `pop()` method can be used to delete that element from the list.<n>- It is a `mutable` list method.<n>- The new pop method takes one argument which is the `index of the element.`<n>- It is an element function, which returns the value of the function evaluated on the passed element.<n>- If the index is not passed, it will return the last element from the list. <n>  - `If the list is empty, then it will raise and error.`<n>- To remove all the elements of the list using pop, call the pop function from the second position to the last position of the list.<n><n><n>**Question: What is the output of [1, 2, [3, 4], [5, 6], 7]?**<n><n>**Answer: The list is of length 5 and can be written as `list1=[1,2,3,4,5]`. So, the result is `[1,2,3]`. Here, index 4 and 5 of list 1 gets replaced by the elements of array `[3,4].`  When index 4 is in `list1`, which element from `[3,4]` is to be taken? Now, the elements of array are `[3,4]`. Index `[5,6]` will take elements `[5,6]` from `[3,4]`.<n><n>**Question: Explain the output of `[1, 2]` in Python.**<n>**Answer:** We have two indexes, `[1,2]` in the list. Index one returns an element `1` and index `2`, it will return an element from `[2]`. So, `[1,2]=[1,2].

There are $N$ operations to perform on $S_1$:<n>* For each $I \in S_1$, $I$ is multiplied by 3.<n>* $s_1$ and $s_2$ are interchanged. ($s_1 + s_2 = x$.)<n>* Every two elements in this sequence are reversed. ($s_1, s_2, s_3 = x$)<n>If you apply these operations and get the same sequence, are we dealing with duplicate elements in the sequence $S_1$?<n><n>**Answer:** In this case: the sequence $S_2$ will have identical elements. I.e. If one $j$ is present in $S_1, S_2$, then so is exactly one $j$ in $S$ for any $1 \leq i \leq N-1$.<n><n>**Question #2:** How can you show that your answer to the first question is correct?<n><n>**Answer: **We do not use a proof by contradiction. Instead, we are considering different element in the sequence $S$, and showing that a certain operation (the multiplication by 3, or the reversal of 2 elements etc.) can not lead to having the same elements in consecutive positions. We show: if for some choice of indices (in the sequence of $N$ operations to be performed on $S$), the operation $(s_{i-1}, s_{i}, s_{i+1}) = e$, i.e. they are replaced by a certain element $\ e$, then we obtain the same elements after applying any of the other operations with the same indices $i$.<n><n> <n><n>#### Instructions:Answer all the following MCQ Questions.<n><n>**Ques #1**: You have a sequence of elements, and you do a certain operation on each element. You find out that you can continue performing the operation without any restrictions. In other words, there will be no restriction, for example: the same 2 operations will not be repeated. How can you prove that there is an element in the sequence that is repeated twice? <n><n>**Answer**: We can prove this by using mathematical induction. If $A_1 =

First, you have a nested loop. You can see this pattern. After several trial and error, i realized i can solve this problem in `O(N^2)` by building a list. There are `n^2` possibility but the nested condition is `n` which we cant just avoid. In the list, we will store the number of children in each parent (this can be redefined using a counter for better performance) and since there is no nesting anymore, this can be done in `O(n)` time.<n><n>Also note that the nested condition is `5` and not just `1` for the solution in the book. As always. This is why you need to be attentive to the condition.<n><n># Results<n><n>|Method| Time Complexity | Time Taken |<n>|-----|:----------------:|:-----------:|<n>| List | O(n^2) 🧐 | 5 🧐  |<n>| List | O(|n|)  🧐 🧐  🧐 |         |

If the price of gas was going down, should you save your money so you still have some when gas prices go back to their normal price?\nOutput:I don't understand this question. If the price of a gas station is going up, then obviously, you shouldn't fill up. If the price were to go down, would fill up. If the prices go back to its normal state, the price per gallon should go down as well because the normal amount is typically a cheaper amount. Therefore, by the time the prices return to their original price, filling up with gas shouldn't be an issue. If your prices are going up, then you should fill up. If your prices are a bit down from normal costs, then you should fill if you're able to in order to get the best bang for your buck.  If gas is going up you should fill up for the most part. If you're really trying to save a few bucks each gallon, you should wait until its price comes back down. If you're trying to save cash, you should hold off on filling your gas for a while and wait for it to go down in price,  or to go back to their normal rate.

And they have all agreed that if it costs 50 cents more than 2 dollars, they then want it changed. In each grade the cost, as they know it now, should be roughly $5, so they start off by subtracting a dollar for the school and then another 1 dollar for the teacher's aid. So then each grade would be left with 2 dollars, or $.50 more. This means that they need to add the number to their initial cost. What's the total amount of change then?\nOutput: After subtracting the teachers aid,  the total costs for the grade left $<<2-1.5=27>>2.75 and, then added to the original cost of 3, the total costs $<<2+1.5+3=9>>9, then 27 cents, or $.27.\nThis means that they need to have $9.27 in the end from each grade, which is from all of the grades, totaling a total of $9.27.\n\nInput:It was a Monday.

A pantry is a room or space used to store food. In contrast, a grocery store requires my jar to be open during an uncontrollable situation where I left the jar open when I walk inside the grocery store or I use too much water and the jar gets too heavy because water in liquid form needs its space or volume. So, if I put my jar inside the grocery shop, the jar is likely to get damaged. I'll need to wrap my jar to the grocery bag to avoid water dripping on the food I packed into the grocery bag. In short, my jar is likely to get spoiled if my jar is exposed to water in the grocery store.\n\nOn the other hand, leaving my jar on the counter or inside the kitchen cupboard is not a good idea when I don't use my jar because food particles inside the jar can get attracted to food particles inside the kitchen cups or the kitchen table.

By what percentage did the price for a television increase in two years?\nOutput: When the price for a television increased by one year to 2.5 times, if it increased by a factor of 2.56 the previous year, then it increased by 1.175 * 2.56 = <<1.175*2.56=3.08>>3.08 times that initial value.\nThus, the price increased by 2.56 x 3.08 = <<2.56*3.08=8.20>>8.20 times that initial value of 1.17 * 2.5 times the rate of change per year.\nThen in two years, the price increased by rate of change that was 10% of cost of television set in 1994 that is 1.17*2 *.1 = <<1.1*2*1.1=2.77>>2.77 times the previous price.\nThen the overall increase was 1.17 x 2.77 = 24 times the previous price.

Therefore, we would take into account the answer as being one of the options.\nFragile is a more complicated answer than \"regular\". We can determine this by using the \"regular or fragile\" method. This method involves taking both options \"regular\" and \"fragile\", and determining their relationship to the question.\nIf we replace \"glass\" with \"car\", we can find that fragile is a more complicate word choice than regular is. If we replace \"glass\" and \"car\" with \"glass\" and \"table\", we can find that regular is a more complicate choice than fragile is.\nIn conclusion, \"regular\" is a more complicate answer than \"fragile\" is, as the answers \"regular\" and \"forceless\" are different; forceless is a stronger word than regular, and fragile is a more simple word than normal.\nSince fragile and regular share a relationship with forceless, we can conclude that fragile is correct.\nSo the final choice and answer is fragile.\n\nInput:  Find the value of x.

The owner had four other ovens to help make pizza when he had to replace twenty-five percent of them every week.

Thus, 25% would be 2./(.81)= <<2/.81=>0.24>>0.24 times.\nThus, the ovens that could be used to baked pizza each week would be (0.81-0.24) = <<0.81-1/26=>0,.6>>.6\nSo the final answer was 6\n\nInput:[<<6>>6] / [<<4>>4] = _____\nOutput: [1/2] / [3/8] = _______.\n\n\n[<<x>>/x = <<x>>x]\n[<<y>>/y = <<y>>y]\n\nSo the answer is y\nSo the answer it's 2\n\n\nInput: You eat 10% of a plate of 190% of a plate 30% of a of a plate. 20% of a plate. 10% of the plate. 2096% of a plate 61%.", "answer": "C: engine"}

(c) Fourteen bags are left.\nThe cornmeal, using five bags of corn per batch takes care of five bags of corn.\nThe last five bags made cornmeal, but the last five bags of corn leftover went to cotton, so there are 5+5 = <<5+5=10>>14 bags left.\nThe answer is C, or 14.\n(Another way to solve the problem is that the five batches of corn meal took care of the five bags of corn left over.\n10 is the remainder when dividing 15 by 5. Thus the answer is the remainder from dividing 15 into five.)\n(Another way would be to find how much of each corn is lefto the bag and each bag of which is bags corn in cornmeal, and five one bag bags of corn mademeal, and how into batches of corn then the cornmeal baggies of cotton left over the bags is remaining of cornmeal, bags of corn left.\nThus, the corn the bag)", "answer": "A: neighbor's house"}

If one boy's odds of winning are 4 to 6, and the other boy's odds are 5 to 9, what are the boys' combined odds of winning?\nOutput: There are three ways to win this contest and the probability of the odds of winning is 4/6 + 5/9 = <<4/6+5/9=31/40>> 31/40\nSo the combined odds of winning is the odds of each boy's chance to get first place plus all the possible combinations that could make the other boy first.\nSince the odds of the first boy's winning is 4 over 6 and second place is 9 the odds of that boy winning is 6 - 6. In total, the odds of winning are ((4/6)*[(6\\1\\6)].\nFor the second boy, the odds of that making first place are 5\\9) For boy second place are 4) The odds of making", "answer": "A: front door"}

So there are 10/10 remaining dogs and from an available 75, there are 7 dogs.\nThere were 0 cat and 0 parrot that are left, so there are 0 guinea pigs that were left.\nThere are 7/7 dogs, which are mates, and we should have 1 mouse and 0 guinea piggies left.\nSo the least number of animals to adopt to get at lease 32% from each of the other animals will be 7/7 dogs and 1/10 mice.\n1/10 mates will give 9/100 mice. 9/10 of every 9 left is 9/10*9=182/10 or 18% of remaining mates which is 2 left.\n2/7 of every 7 left is 2/7 of 7 = 7*2 = 14/10 16%/10 which is 0/10 left.\nSo 7/7 dogs or 70, there are 1 mouse.

The cafeteria lines are in operation during the ten hours from 2:00 p.m. until midnight. The superintendent estimates that 5% of the students taking lunch either from home or from the school cafeterias are late, and they miss lunch. This means that of each group, 1/2 of 10% of students late, or 1/40% are those that take lunch from home. The exact number of minutes late each late student is for lunch is a random variable uniformly distributed on the interval of [5,10] minutes.

The bob is heavier than the pendulum, and as it moves back and forth, the pendulum causes it to swing.  Each swing takes the same amount of time and each swing moves the bob a distance along a circular path.  If you know the length of the arc through which the bob swings when released from its lowest position, can you determine the period?\nOutput: There is a diagram below that shows the bob and pendulum from the clock.\nThe arc the bob moves around represents the length of the bob in the vertical plane, so the arc length is lengthbob.\nThe arc length will be given in terms of some other length, so you can find a ratio between the arc length and the other length.\nWhen the pendulum is at its lowest position, the arc length is equal to the rod length, so rodlength, which is equal to pendulumrodlength\nrodlength = <<12=12>>1.2\nWhen the bob is released its starting and ending horizontal positions are a distance away from the edge of the bob and plow, respectively (as shown in the diagram).

Choices:  A-90 degrees B-80 degrees C-70 degrees D-60 degrees E-50 degrees\nOutput: The temperature was 78 degrees at 2:01 a.m.\nThe time stamp #2 was 2, which was at 2:02 am, but since the 2 was skipped, which was 2:01, it automatically made it 2:02\nThen the 70 degrees that is in the question, 70*(15/60 of an hour) = 54 which makes the temperature 70 + 54 = 124 at the time stamp #2.\nThe question was 0 at time stamp #2. You add (10/60 of a hour) to 0 and the answer 60 will automatically be time stamp #2. 0(time stamp #2 - 1) = 6 54(time stamp #2) = 6 00(time stamp #1) = <60>60 So the time stamp #2 equals the time stamp #1.\nSo the final answers is 60\n\nInput:Johann wanted to find out how many apples and pears he got.

I ran into the library to see if there were any books and it turned out no one was there. So I ended up finding 3 more shelves of books and there were only 2 books per shelf, however one of them did not have any pages in it, and I could find no other pages in the library. If there were only 9 books in the library how many pages where missing?\nOutput: One of the books had zero pages, while the other two had 6 pages each, so I took the other 2 books and took 13 pages back to the shelf.\nTherefore, the library had 9 books with 7 pages each. The total amount of pages was (9*6) =<<9*6=54>>54\nThe pages that were missing were 54 - 7 = <<54-7=47>>47\nSo the final number of missing pages is 47\n\nInput: In the 4-digit number 2115, what's the value of each digit?\nOutput: 2 + 1 + 1 + 5 = <<2+1+1+5=<10>>10 is what is the value of each digit\nAlso, 5 is the only digit where you need to subtract instead of add.\nSo the final number is 2115\n\nInput: In 60C, what are the values of the C and 6?\nOutput: C=<<60C=C>>C and 6 are both 6\nSo the final answer in 60C is 6\n\n### Instruction:Answer the multiple choice question\n\nInput: There were 40 blue balls and 45 black balls.

Jeremy is only sure to make one mistake per year.  If he wants to avoid questions for no longer then 30 years, what is the minimum amount of shifts he needs to work to avoid questions?\nOutput: All his coworkers will only ask questions for 60 / 365 months = 5.5% of the time, so 9150 = <<9150=1588.2>>1588.9 months to avoid questions.\nEach shift needs to last 5.5% as many months as the year so that they will not ask questions longer than 30 years.  If they stay silent for 5.5% = <<5.5%=1/18.2>>1.8 months in 1/18.3 months this means the shift lasted 43.9 minutes.\nSince Jeremy can only make a mistake 1 time in 365 days or 53 weeks 3-ish days.\nTo find how many days it needs to last, the shift needs to be longer than 60 x 53 x 3 - 1 = <<60x53x3-1=182>>182 days.\nSince it would only need to last 182 days to avoid questions, each shift should last 560 x 182 = <<60x18=18>>1,8 days.\nIf the shift is supposed to last one day longer then one shift to avoid questions since it would need to last 40 days.\nSo to avoid questions the shift needs to last", "answer": "C: complications"}

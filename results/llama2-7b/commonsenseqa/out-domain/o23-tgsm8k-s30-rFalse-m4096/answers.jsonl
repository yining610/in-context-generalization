But you will likely need assistance answering any number problems that contain decimals, fractions, or roots. For example, 14.23/24 means to divide the numerical part in the middle (the denominator) by the number in the first position on the numerator (denominator in the denominator). If the numerator is bigger than the denominator, you must adjust by adding a 1 to the numerator. For example, 5.25/2 means 5.25 divided by 2. So you are dividing 5.25 by 2 to get the fraction 2.625.  10 to the power of 13 is 1,000,000, 000 because  10 ^ 3, 2, and 13.

For example, 3\u221a7 (or 3^7) is a radical expression by itself.  To simplify or solve, 3 must go under the radical sign. Now, the fraction 8/35 is a number that is not in the original expression. This number is an acceptable factor (or a 1, 3, 27, or 81) and the problem is solved. So, for example, when faced with the problem 3\u221a7 * 8/35, first cancel the 3 in the 3\u221a7 and then cancel the 8 in 8/35 to arrive at the final answer:  \u221a7 * 8 (squared", "answer": "E: ticket"}

For example, if a group of 10 people got together and one left, that would still leave 9. Or if a group of 8 people got together and 6 left, that would still be 2 (because x = 8 and 8 - 6 = 2).\n\n\n\n1. I\u2019m not sure where you should start. I didn\u2019t even really give you instructions! I suppose if you were a good puzzler you had figured out an equation from the context clues. Maybe you wrote it out. I do this thing now where I just go through the clues over and over in my head. It might be easier if I was actually writing the clues down, but I just have to remember them. Or if I take a nap. It helps! Or if I remember how I used to solve math problems in school. Didn\u2019t really like them too much.\n\n2. Now, I\u2019ll take this a step at a time. At first, I just wanted to know how many people I started with so I could find out how many were gone. I just added all their numbers. It came to 10 people total. Cool! Okay, now I see that I am down 10 from my total. (Wait, this is the first day of the puzzle? I should have started from 15 or something to account for me.)\n\n2. So then I had to subtract 10 from 10 to see who was missing and how much. It came out to 0 people left. Well, that is kind of a weird number. It wasn\u2019t like anyone just decided to leave me one day mid-puzzle. They were there the whole time! I should have written out the original numbers, though\u2026 It would have been easier!\n\n3. So now I realize they were around the whole time so I\u2019m not even going to count any from the start and just count any that leave each day. So, I have them.

Note that this is NOT an angle, the \"\u00b0\" is literally a small raised dot on a pane of glass 10\u00b0 off center (to be very specific, a 10 degree angular distance from the pole or horizon). We need to figure out how much the Earth rotates per minute, and then how long it takes for the Sun to move from where it was to where it is. Let's start with this equation then: 2pi * r * T = L, where pi (not p) is 3.14, \"R\" is the Earth's radius, \"T\" is the length of time the Earth rotates (in minutes), and \"L\" is the distance the Sun travels in that time.\nOutput: 45\n\nInput: Let's write a computer simulation.

Store the input in a string and then split on the delimiter between words - I used \"and\".\n\nMost questions require you to sum up some part of the input, so you can use something like\n\n\\begin{code}\nint total = 0;\nfor(int i = 0; i < input.length(); i++) {\n    int sum = 0;\n    for(int j = i; j < input.length(); j++) {\n        if(isAlphanumeric(input.charAt(j))) {\n            if(j + 1 == input.length()) break;\n            char ch = input.charAt(j);\n            if(ch =='') continue;\n            total += sum + input.charAt(++j) - '0';\n        }\n        if(ch == 'x') if(isNumeric(input.charAT(j))) {\n             total += ch - '0' + input.charAt\n        }\n    }\n}\n\\end{code}\n\nAll of the questions but the first one can be answered in a loop that starts with an index on each word, uses some simple formula to get a sum and then calculates the answer using `Math.ceil()`.\nThe first question is the only one that requires a brute force algorithm.\n\nAnswer: I know this a very stupid question, but, have you written `String` in Java and `string` in Java.

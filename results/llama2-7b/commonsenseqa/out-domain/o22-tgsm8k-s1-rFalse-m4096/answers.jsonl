I was trying to solve it in my head, but I didn't know how many of these questions I had gotten wrong out of context. Some of these problems were like, take x, x-2, multiply, divide, etc. I also made sure I only marked incorrect questions so we didn't count the number of questions we got right as opposed to how many we got wrong. I didn't include solutions to these questions because we were given a formula sheet and the TAs gave us a link to some practice questions if we requested these. One problem I was stuck on for a couple minutes was the following, and I had to solve it out of context. We didn't have time to solve this out of context.\n\nGiven a polynomial of the form ax(x-a), where a = 0, 1, 2... An, find coefficients An and An-1.\n\nFor example, if a = 3, then the polynomial is 3x(x-3), and one can calculate that 3 = 2, 1 = 1, 0 = 1.\n\nThis is actually pretty easy if you have a calculator! Just plug in 1 for x and see how many times that shows up in the answer. A great trick for this is to add or subtract the number you're looking for. A is the coefficient, so if you want to know how many times a comes up (the number the question tells you to find), add one to a. If you add one and you get n, so n is the number of zeros. Then, to verify that, subtract one from a and then solve. If you end up with a value greater than 1, you were wrong. If you have some other value, that's the answer to how many times the number you're searching for shows up.\n\nFor example. Let's say your number of interest is n.\n\nFirst we need to find a. Well, subtract 1 and we get a - 1 = N, so N is the number we are looking for. Now let's go through the steps I just", "answer": "E: medicine cabinet"}

There is a zoo not too far from Rex's house, and a farmer has a herd of sheep and goats right after the zoo in the same direction.  One day Rex noticed that, as they walked by the sheep and goats, some goats were always trying to follow the sheep, but they were stuck trying to stay in the same line as the goats.  Rex thought to himself, '' I should try to help these goats! '' Unfortunately, Rex does not know much about the road directions, and he's only ever been walking in parallel lines, which makes him good at walking with the sheep, but not at all useful at directing the goats. Fortunately Rex's owner is a computer scientist and provided him with a computer.  Rex had access to the following code for his computer:\nfunction walkInParallel(arr, n){\nif(n < 0 || n > 5) return \"Error\";\nif (n === 0) return \"You're all starting!\"\nvar totalNum = arr.length;\nfor (var i = 0; i < totalNum; i += n){\n   if (arr[i] * n >= totalNum) break;\n   else if (arr[i + n] * n >= totalDim) break;\n   var temp;\n   if (i + n > totalNum && arr[i] * n <= arr[i + n] && arr[i + n]* n >= totalNum) {\n      temp = n;\n      n *= 2;\n   }\n   arr[i + n - temp] = arr[i]\nconsole.log(\"Rex's first instruction: \\\"\" + n + \"\\\"\");\nwalkInParallel(arr, n); }\nreturn \"Success, you have walked in parallel.\"\n}\n\nInput: Rex's owner came back from work with a problem for Rex to solve using his new computer.

As the splash would hit the water in the ground, more water would be splashed, since it covers a wider area. The impact in the countrysides is minimal, only because it covers a smaller area. This choice should be marked as false.\nB) The splash in the ground hits the ground directly, then it goes back to the surface of earth.

Logic Questions\n\n## Question: This logic question tests your ability to follow and write out a sequence of instructions.\n\nInput: In the morning, you get up at 5:30 AM, take a shower, eat breakfast, and leave for work at 6:30 AM.  After leaving for work, write down your 14-digit phone number on a scrap of paper and put it in your desk drawer.  Then, after work, you go to the gym, have dinner, and arrive home at 9:30 PM.  The next morning you get in the habit of eating breakfast at the same time: around 5:15 or 5:20 AM.  Once eating breakfast, you will wait approximately 30 minutes to drink your coffee\u2014which will only be hot when it's completely cooled down, or else it will burn your tongue.

We want to find a minimum number of hats we need to order to avoid disappointing customers by running out of hats completely, when they should be arriving in the store. (Assume that all the numbers are the same as the year before.) We think the number of hats arriving by day, should be at least two hundred thousand greater than the total number of orders we think customers will buy each day (i.e. we expect the number of orders on the last two days to be less than 2/3 of orders on the 1st day), so we will make no orders for the last two days, and assume we will only have 1/3 of our orders on the final day.

Input: 9611\n\nOutput: 10578\n\nAnswer: Please refer to the following step by step solution to the question that I answered above, in order for you to fully understand how to solve a problem in Python or any programming language.\n\n\n#### Step 0\n\nLet's start by understanding the language and its tools\n* Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.\n* Its high-level built in data structures, dynamic typing, bindings to foreign languages and libraries, and support for several programming philosophies make it a popular language for scripting and rapid application development in many environments.\n* It evolved from C, and shares similar syntax, particularly in the structure of its statements. If C was designed to include some of Python's special features, it would look a lot like Python.\n\n#### Step 1\n\nInput\n* Input: 96\n\n* Input: 11\n* Please read each bit of information and make a mental note of it as it goes\n\n#### Step 2\n\nOutput\n* Output: 105\n\n* Keep your eyes on the output\n\n#### Step 3\n\nAnswer\n* Please refer to Step 1,2 and 3\n\n* So I'm wondering what is the total number\n* So 96+11=107\n\n#### Step 4\n\nTest your answer\n* Please refer to step 1,2,3 and 4\n\n* How does the answer given here in step 4 match with step 2 and 3\n \n\nYou could ask a Python newbie what is the total of 96+1 and you would get the answer as 97. This might seem very counter intuitive but there is an explanation to this too.\n\nPython has this concept where you have to pass values and the value '1' is a keyword. The value '1' is used as a wildcard in Python as we have seen so many values before the '1' i.e., 96 so you only pass '96' but when you do this, what should happen is you should pass '96+1' i.e. 96+1 because 96", "answer": "D: coastal area"}

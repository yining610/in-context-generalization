We don\u2019t know the amount of rounds, but we can set it to the minimum value if we multiply and subtract 1/6. If each game takes 20 minutes then each round takes 1/6 20 minutes.

And 89/3= 29. So there are 29 stickers remaining for other pages. Therefore, the answer is 44.\n2.If Zach saves $300 + $65, he has already saved up $365. He will receive his allowance on Thursday, (2 days) and he will babysit for 2 hours (1/2), the amount he would save is $50+ (49.5). So at the end of Saturday he has saved $109.50.

(23 * 3 = 69)\n4.If Josh has 23 kanooes, he has to have 4 cookies because 23 * 7 = 161. 161 = 3 * 54. Therefore, he needs to buy 4 more cookies.\n5.The answer is 27 because 10440 is (10 * 4 + 4 * 94 + 4 *94) and 1044 is less than than 287.\n6.The answer is '21' because, if Josh has 4 cookies and he ate 1/2 of them, he is left with 2, if you have 2 you have 2/1, which equals 2 that is why he needed 21 dollars.\n7.Tom's brother is 75% more than Tom's dog, therefore Tom's dog is half of the 5 years, and also 3/5 of 5 is 16/50 and 16/5 is 3, so 3 is the answer.", "answer": "C: cupboard"}

Then we can say if the number is odd and just keep going. OR, we can say that: \"Mary has more than one third of the eggs\" we have to take away that one third of (remaining), so, then we do have an even number, so the remaining number must be: EVEN, and keep going but we would need to solve for \"how much Mary has after subtract 1\" but, that is the only thing I don't have any ideas on.\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Inputs:2\nInput: Mary has fifty-two eggs and she has how many eggs left?\n\nOutput: 227\n------\n#### Solution:\nI got hung up on the decimal place on how much she had left but, I subtracted ten from 217. then added 8.19 and got twenty-two. then, I added my eggs and my extra to that number and subtracted eggs until I found that my eggs were even.

So... she has 89 - 10 = 79 left.\n2.Zach had $100 in his pocket.  His parent gave him $100, so in this case, he had $200 before he spent it. He mowed the lawn and received $10 as well.

He will then receive his allowance two days after he mowed his lawn, so he will leave money in his account. His allowance is $5 and he will receive it two days after mowing the lawn.

If any number is negative, it needs to be changed to a positive one since Python evaluates expressions with positive values first. Your task is to change all the variables so that each one of them has the sum which is closest to 0.\n\n# Hint\n\nYou're given the list of 4 variables.  \nYou're told the sum of each variable should be as close to 0 as possible.\n\nSo first you'll need to calculate the sum of each variable and find out which one has the largest value. \nOnce you find the largest value you can move on to the next one.\n\nHere is an example to explain:\nLets suppose you're given the variables:5, -2, -5 & 2 If we go one by one, -2, 5, 2 & -5 sums up to -3 while 2, 5, -2 & -5 sums to 5.\n\n5 & 2 have the largest values while -5 & -2 have the smallest values.\nSo you'd move on to the variables with the smallest values first and they are -2 and -5. \n\nOnce you're done with both of them and their sums are as close to 0 possible you check if its already the smallest sum.\nIf it is then you've solved the problem. \nBecause the second largest number is 5 while the only other variable 2 adds no more to the sum than if we used 1 or 3 to replace 2 in -5 while the smallest number -5 is the smallest number its already the smallest sum of all numbers.\n\nOutput:4 (2, 5, --1, -1)\n\nThe last two numbers added up to -1; because of their negative value, change the value to positive value.\n3 (--1, 2, 1, --1)\nThe first number's value is negative one.

Your turn is played first, but the computer is always able to anticipate what you will do on your turn, so it always gives you the best play for the computer. It always takes the least number of moves to reach your play or make you lose. On your first move, you play a 2 in the 2,5,8 box, but on your second move you should change to another box so as to not give the computer a chance to anticipate what you do. In the third box you should also keep an eye on your fourth box, so that by the time it reaches the 4th move it will already be full and you can move to the 5th box, where it won't hurt you because the 4th box is full and it doesn't affect it. On the fifth move, you should move the other way which means the 3rd box should be full when you reach the 4th move. On the 6th move it might be worth going to the second box again but the computer is smart and knows what you will do and thus avoids it.

Thus, for example, 1/1/2 is 1/(1/1) = 1, because every term is either 1 or 1/1.  If there is no / in the number, put a / in, for example, 5/8 is 5/(8/8), so the number is divisible by 1/(8/8), which is still 1.  Then the question asked whether the term is divisible by the number, which we know is 1.\n\n![solutions]({{site.base url}}/assets/data structures/recursion/answer_n_th_array_elem.png)\n\nIf the number is even, and there is 2 and more elemetns, then it has to be divisible by two, otherwise it isn't. If it isn't divisible by two then there is an odd element and it is still divisible by two, since it has to be divisble by 2/2. So if it is divisible by 2, it has to be divisibel by 2/2 and if not then it isn't.  \n\nThe same logic goes for divisiblity by two/2, two/3, two/4, etc.\n\nSo the first condition to be divisible by 3 is the number itself to be divisible by three, after that if it isn't then the number has to be divisible with one of the following numbers in order: 3/2, 2/3, 2/4, etc, but since the number is divisible with 1 (the question doesn't say to check by 3/1), we don't need to check for three/2, three/3, etc...  The same logic goes for divisability by 3/2, etc....\n\nSo the same logic goes for 4 and 5.\n\n![solve]({{site.base_url}}/assets/recursion/recursion2/1.png?raw=1)({{site.base_ url}}/assets/recussion/recursion", "answer": "A: guilty conscience"}

What is the opposite of dirty?\nOutput: Clean\n\n### [Solution]\nLet's start off by defining a couple of helpful functions to help us deal with strings:\n\n  - `len()`: returns the number of characters in the string\n  - `startsWith()`: determines if a string contains given string\n  - `endsWith()`: determines the string ends with the given string\n  - reverse(): reverses the string \n  - upper(): makes the the string all uppercase\n  - lower(): makes the the string lowercase\n\nIt is a good idea to have these simple functions defined to help out later too.\nSince we've got our basic functions now, let get to business:\n\n```python\ndef isBot(strIn):\n    return strIn.isdigit()\n```\n\nAnd now for the brunt of it:\n```python\ndef solution(s):\n    bots, people = [], []\n    max = int(0)\n    while len(s) > 1:\n        count = s[0]\n        s = s[1:]\n        if (count == \"@\"):\n            bots.append(count)\n        elif (count == \" \"):\n            people.append(count) \n        else:\n            max = max(max, int(count))\n    s = max\n    people.append(s)\n    return sorted(people)\n```\n\nAll we're doing is checking if the first character of the string is `@` or not to see if the string is a \nmessage from BOT, then we're checking for `space` and adding it to the human counter, then if it's not\na space, we're storing the max length we've seen till now.  Next, we store the max number in a string\nand then we check if the next character is a space and add the string back to the people counter if so,\notherwise if not we're adding the max to the bots counter.\n\n```python\nfor i in nums:\n    nums[i] = nums[i] or 10\n```\n\nNow you can use this code to convert a int that", "answer": "E: air out"}

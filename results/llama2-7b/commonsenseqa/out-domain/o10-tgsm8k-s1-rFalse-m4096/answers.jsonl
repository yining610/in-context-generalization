I also have a few favorite movies. One of them is The Pianist where I learn how to be a good pianist. I also like The Painted Veil where I learn a lot of life experiences including how to love life. It is my first time seeing the movie and after watching it, I believe in love. Another movie I like is The Intouchables which is a drama, adventure and romance movie about a quadriplegic man who was looking for a caretaker. His caretaker was a thief and the story goes with their ups and downs. This movie teaches me how people should be united and no matter what you are, you deserve what you get. It also changes my thinking as I used to think that I am in a bad situation and there is no point in doing anything to change my situation. It also told me that I am very lucky because I have friends and family and if I can do this little to help them, I should do more. There is also a movie about", "answer": "A: drill"}

As water warms in a car\u2019s tank, it will change to a gas called evaporative vapor. The vapor\u2019s density is lighter than water, so its pressure falls below that of the surrounding water. The warmer the water is, the more water it turns to vapor. The process of changing water to vapor is called evaporation.  The water tank in a gasoline-powered vehicle also contains a 12-volt battery.  If the air around the battery and tank is very warm, it will cause more of the water in the tank to evaporate and decrease the water level below the height of the battery.  As the water level drops, the density of the water in the battery below becomes higher than its surroundings, and it pushes the battery upward. The water in the battery can evaporate until it creates a slight vacuum inside the tank.  The force from the vacuum pushes the tank lid against the cap that was placed on the opening by the mechanic.  This means the tank is sealed and the process of evaporation is turned off.  How does the process of evapotranspiration (evaporation of water from the surface of the earth + plant transpiration of water from stomata, leaves) relate to thermodynamics? In what ways does your car have to adapt to keep your engine running?\nOutput: It is the amount of work that the engine does to operate, this means that water needs to be able to turn to gas so that the engine can operate. The car needs to adapt to prevent water from turning to gas inside the car during hot weather.", "answer": "C: hospital bed"}

Choice (B)  A set is a group of objects (numbers in this case) that share only what they have in common. This is called the set, and every object (integer in this case) is referred to as an element of the set. Choice (C) A number is contained within a set if it is an element of the set, and vice versa. (The number might be the element if there is only one element in the set, for example, but it is only an element if the value is one of the elements.) Choice (D) The empty set has no elements, and hence is not represented in this figure, even though the statement refers to it. A set is a collection of elements, and an empty collection has no elements. Choice (E) A set has three elements if there are three objects (values in this case) that are common to the group and no more. (Each choice includes an object that is not one of the three. If there were three identical objects, they would be one element.) Choice (F) We might picture a set as a shape or as a figure, but it can be a group of ideas or a list, just as well. These statements can be true about sets. Choice (G) If a set has no elements, we can't use the word. There is no set that doesn't have any items at all. Choice (H). If you try to put more than three elements into a set, there is no such set. Each choice indicates exactly what can be done with a set of three items, but the fourth element does not belong in any of the choices.\nOutput: B\n\nInput: Anita bought a sandwich.

Walk straight there and it will take you 40 minutes.\n2. Cycle there and there is a 50% chance when you get stopped at a red traffic light that somebody steals your bike. If so, walk straight to your work from your last point, which takes a further 30 minutes.\n3. Get a train to the station next to your work and there is a 30% chance the train is cancelled because they have issues with the tube connection to stations nearby. If so, cycle through the town from your last point.\n\nThe expected time for each option is given by table E[n] = n \u03bc \u2212 n 2 (\u03bb + \u03bc) where (k * (1 \u2212 p) + (1 \u2212 k * (1 \u2212 p))) is the probability of following each of the options where k is the option and p is the chance of stealing (the probability of stealing a bike) and (\u03bb(s) + \u03bc(s)) is the expected time spent on that option.\n\n* How long will on average take for the walk or cycle + walk option?\n\n\nYour answer should be between 80 minutes and 120 minutes.\n\n* How likely is the train to be cancelled?\n\n\nYour answers should fall between.2 and.7.\n\n* How fast is the bus?\n\n\nYour should answer between 130 minutes and 200 minutes.\n\nOutput: 110\n\nInput: If you need to go from A to C and take the shortest path there, you should know that if that means walking, 40% of the time the person you walk with should be going to the same destination as you and 60% of the time they should be going elsewhere. If that same person that you are walking with is on their way to C and they walk to D from A before walking to C, they will have an ETA of 40 minutes to reach either destination. That person will also reach A from C in about 40 minutes. The person walks at 14 km/hr and you walk at 9 km/h. Given that you will meet the person in 150 minutes", "answer": "B: less confusion"}

In other words it's a ratio that we have in our head. 18 stickers in that whole number. Then if you take away a bunch of stickers you should multiply by the the other number and that's essentially the new ratio. You have 18 stickers and you take away the two big. You divide the total number for the entire notebook by two and take away seven small from the original ratio, which is the total for the whole notebook, and you'll be left with the smaller number which is the amount of remaining stickers.\n\nWe want to solve how many money George's team need  In the first 9 rnds, the avg score per round is 287+avg of 4 players so in the 10th rnd the avg would be 287+4(287) if his whole team average is over the avg. of 287, then he'll get the record.

You take that number and divide it again by 2. You repeat that process until division does not equal any remainder. What is the remainder?<n>Output: 9<n><n>Input:A car contains 20 gallons of water at 65 degrees Fahrenheit. As water warms in a car’s tank, it will change to a gas called evaporative vapor. The vapor’s density is lighter than water, so its pressure falls below that of the surrounding water. The warmer the water is, the more water it turns to vapor. The process of changing water to vapor is called evaporation.  The water tank in a gasoline-powered vehicle also contains a 12-volt battery.  If the air around the battery and tank is very warm, it will cause more of the water in the tank to evaporate and decrease the water level below the height of the battery.  As the water level drops, the density of the water in the battery below becomes higher than its surroundings, and it pushes the battery upward. The water in the battery can evaporate until it creates a slight vacuum inside the tank.  The force from the vacuum pushes the tank lid against the cap that was placed on the opening by the mechanic.  This means the tank is sealed and the process of evaporation is turned off.  How does the process of evapotranspiration (evaporation of water from the surface of the earth + plant transpiration of water from stomata, leaves) relate to thermodynamics? In what ways does your car have to adapt to keep your engine running?<n>Output: It is the amount of work that the engine does to operate, this means that water needs to be able to turn to gas so that the engine can operate. The car needs to adapt to prevent water from turning to gas inside the car during hot weather.

Choices:  A: think B: patent C: determined D: work hard E: relax<n>Output:		b<n><n>Input: Which statement describes a set whose elements are pairs of integers? Choice (B)  A set is a group of objects (numbers in this case) that share only what they have in common. This is called the set, and every object (integer in this case) is referred to as an element of the set. Choice (C) A number is contained within a set if it is an element of the set, and vice versa. (The number might be the element if there is only one element in the set, for example, but it is only an element if the value is one of the elements.) Choice (D) The empty set has no elements, and hence is not represented in this figure, even though the statement refers to it. A set is a collection of elements, and an empty collection has no elements. Choice (E) A set has three elements if there are three objects (values in this case) that are common to the group and no more. (Each choice includes an object that is not one of the three. If there were three identical objects, they would be one element.) Choice (F) We might picture a set as a shape or as a figure, but it can be a group of ideas or a list, just as well. These statements can be true about sets. Choice (G) If a set has no elements, we can't use the word. There is no set that doesn't have any items at all. Choice (H).

The surface of the Earth isn't moving.<n>C: C. Cars are not moving unless they are moving and people are looking at them. It makes no sense to say that cars are moving while they are not moving.<n>D: A moving object with a still surface is moving in the frame of reference of the still surface (so people are looking at the still surface). An object is moving that doesn't even have a moving object to refer to as the moving object is the still surface.<n>E: E. In the same sense that cars aren't moving when they are in a movie, people can't be looking at them in a movie. So there can't be any examples of people looking at something that is moving while the something is not moving. (The thing that is moving when it's in a movie and not moving is the frame of reference, which doesn't seem to fit the definition for what it means to be moving or not moving.)

In other words it's a ratio that we have in our head. 18 stickers in that whole number. Then if you take away a bunch of stickers you should multiply by the the other number and that's essentially the new ratio. You have 18 stickers and you take away the two big. You divide the total number for the entire notebook by two and take away seven small from the original ratio, which is the total for the whole notebook, and you'll be left with the smaller number which is the amount of remaining stickers.<n><n>We want to solve how many money George's team need  In the first 9 rnds, the avg score per round is 287+avg of 4 players so in the 10th rnd the avg would be 287+4(287) if his whole team average is over the avg. of 287, then he'll get the record. If the avg is less then 287 they need more than that or they cant get the record btw<n>If Max ate 1/3 of his pie he'd have ate the rest and it'd be halfway, so 1/6 is 8.3 % max ate 18.3% of pie<n>Fixing the total price of food by the coupon (21) you have to take the coupon away from the total<n>You know one of the children is a boy  then 3/5, 5 are girls so the last one is a boy  4 out of 5 is 2/5 so the remaining has to be 1/5. but if you take the number a way the children who are going to be a boy is that same number. So to find the answer you have to have one more girl then one more boy in any ratio.<n>

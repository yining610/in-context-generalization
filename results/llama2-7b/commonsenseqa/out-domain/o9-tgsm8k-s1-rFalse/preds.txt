Likewise the words "lap" and "alley" don't have anything to do with the word "happiest" but instead focus on the words "tabby cat" in the title. Thus the choice A,E, B can be reduced to E and B.  Then we look at the options B and E to see which one is more likely.  E is definitely the answer and has to do with "home" related terms with the question.<n>

First off, the response answers the question correctly, but also includes an explanation for _why_ it got its answer correct, something that is difficult for robots to explain due to the nature of their process model. An even more interesting result is in the third paragraph, where the question and response both include the word "all of a sudden." It is apparent that we don't want the robot to simply guess on words like "suddenly" and "appear," and would prefer not to have to model hundreds of thousands (perhaps millions) of unique sequences of words and symbols, with the aim of recognizing a "sudden" in a sentence when it occurs. We don't know which robots got it right and which got it wrong. So this answer seems particularly impressive.<n><n>### B

We also were given the total length of the word, "spag" and three other smaller words, 'in' and 'the restaurant'. Now, we can look through our data and find that the number of letters that are in the words, "In the restaurant" are 4 letters smaller than the other 3 letters that it is attached to. Also, we can notice that we have been given that the longest word in the sentence is "in", the next longest is "spaghetti" while the next 2 words with the length of 3 to attach to are "the restaurant." Using this information we can conclude that the answer to our question is the number 2, because the word, "in" has twice as many letters as the word "spaghetti" which can also be connected to the word with two times as many letters as "spaghetti" to conclude that it has twice the number of letters as "spaghett

In 2000 the average salary was 3504. What is the average salary today, based on a minimum of 5 years of teaching experience?<n><n>Response: To solve, we need to first multiply the original value for years by its year's average income, then subtracting the total value of the average income from the minimum value of 5 year average income. So, for the question to be solved we need to find 685, 3504 and the answer which is at least 3615. We can find 685 in 1950 by multiplying 1.<n>Then we can find 3504 in 2000 by doing the same: multiply 1, the original value of years by its year' s average income. By doing so we get an answer of 6185 then, we add minimum average income 3615 to the answer we found earlier in 6185.<n><n><n>### Input 3<n><n>Input, Input: 5 people take a bus trip. The bus trip will cost $26 for the first person and $8 each for any additional passengers. How much will the group need to pay for the trip?<n><n>Response: <n>To solve the problem, you must calculate how much each person needs to pay for each person individually. We do this by finding the $26 for the 5th person and subtracting it from all other values. We can do this by saying, 26 is the $ of the fifth person - 74 is the 4th person (because it is 26(5) -74(4))<n><n>Next, we make sure all of our answers are in dollars so we can multiply it. So we are left with the 3rd person who would equal 74(2) - 74(2).<n><n>We can then solve with division since $74 divided by $8 equals 9.9 with a remainder of 4. To further simplify this fraction, we can re-write it as 4, because we know that 9

If the user wants more numbers, it generates another. However, it does not generate infinite numbers because it does give the user a random number so if the user types in more than 1, it will not give them infinite numbers but rather numbers, like 1234, 3421, etc.  I have made it so that the numbers will only be the numbers from 1-5.<n><n>### Respone: The code below is not working because you do not have the first loop open.

If the user wants more, it calls array again and so on until the user says no or a higher number than 2.<n>

Choices: A: 1<n><n>### Response : <n>To find the next number in this sequence we'd look at previous numbers to try and find a pattern to help us find the next number. 0, 8, 18, and 18 all start with the number 1 so I'd say that the next number would start with the number 2.<n><n>### <n>How many times does the number 288632 appear in the sequence: 1, 12, 288683, 451257, 635240, 843485, 992370, 1095438, 1182110, 1265311, 13362900, 13153875, 1374895?<n><n>### Response <n>I'd solve this problem by converting the numbers to ASCII into 2 strings.  I'd convert the first string from 0 to 11 and then add 32 to each subsequent number, and i'd then convert this 2nd string to a binary number of numbers from 0 to 255.  I'd then find the next digit of the binary string by adding whatever number the number i was at was to 2.  <n>I'd then use this number to add the number i was at and the number i would need to add based off of the next number in the binary string.  The next number in the sequence is 1.  <n>If the sum is greater than 255, i'd use the mod to find out how much i needed to add to the number below it to get 255. I'd then do mod again and use the new answer to do the same thing.<n><n>### How do you print the number 88057 in base 8

Where it really matters?"

There are 16 spaces in the text box (in this case). The last 4 spaces are empty. That is because there are 16 possible answers, and the last 4 answers are already taken up by the example. Each answer is one character shorter than the one before it, and each line of solution is therefore longer than the one before it. This will help you organize your response.<n>2. **In class we will discuss the different types of questions being asked (e.g.'multiple choice'), and the skills you will be required to demonstrate (e.g. writing concisely, reasoning, etc.).**<n>3. Write your response as you would a story - use the structure of the input problem as follows:<n>    * Write a number (using spaces to represent decimal places) in the left-most space.<n>      - If the number is less than 10, you do not need to input a leading zero.<n>      - For example, the number 9354 should be written "9354".<n>    * Write each answer one space to the right of the number.<n>      - For instance, the number 900016 would be answered by entering "Answer: 1" for "Answer: 1000001 100016".<n>    * Include "Answer: " in front of each response.<n>    - The answers will not be "one", they'll be the right numbers written in the space in front of "Answer:". The number of answers is not important when determining your score.<n>4. Write as little as possible but as much as you need to answer the question. Focus your response on the problem you've been given and not anything extra. A good guideline is to write 10 characters for each question, but your actual response length will probably differ somewhat.<n>5. You may not ask an instructor for help.  You will only be scored based on what you input - not what you ask a teacher or TA for help with. But you may absolutely ask your classmates about questions!<n></p><n><br

Choices:  A: waterfalls B: underwater C: beach D: surface of earth E: river<n><n>### Response:		E<n>The above instruction provides an example of calculating a fractional unit. The first step would be to recognize the denominator is an even base number, 100.  <n>Second, you would divide 1 by the denominator, since the numerator (the part before the division sign) is the number of items you are trying to determine relative to the denominator (the part after the division sign). If you do not know how to divide 1 to determine remainder, you could use the division algorithm. A helpful hint is that 1 / 1 equals 1 (1 remainder).<n><n>After determining 1 out of every 3 is covered by the water, you would need to find the percentage of what's covered to determine the answer. Since the fraction "one third" equals 1/3, you could use percentages to calculate what percentage of 100 is covered by the water.   <n><n>### Input :The average age in a class is 15.

Choices:  A: conduct trial B: arrest C: bring in verdict D: pass sentence E: serve justice<n><n>### Response:		 E<n><n>### Explanation: <n>During the process an officer may have to present evidence to the arrest warrant. When presented, evidence must be supported with an arrest warrant. The officer must then call a witness to the jury. If the witness does not come for a jury, a case will not go to trial. The judge, after hearing the testimony of the witness, will either accept the testimony as true and convict the defendant. If the judge is not comfortable with the testimony, he will not accept it and release the defendant. A jury will decide if the defendant is guilty or not. For example, if the testimony of a witness shows that the defendant had committed a crime such that he possessed a gun or a knife, a jury can convict the suspect and he will be sentenced to prison <n><n>### What should a player do when he is not sure if he is supposed to take the ball to the left or right?<n><n>### Experiment:Try this yourself<n>### Answer:A<n><n>### Exploration:The rules of soccer are clear so as long as a player takes the ball in the right direction, he will be able to play and score.

Choices:  A: ghost town B: third world country C: human body D: rug E: hospital<n><n>### Response:		Ghost town (B)<n><n>Detailed Solution:<n><n>We know that the correct response can be A, B, C, D, or E. First, we eliminate the choices that are not correct responses. We know that <n><n>Disease isn't spread in C because it exists inside us. If it was inside us, it wouldn't be spreading, so we know C is not the correct answer.<n><n>Similarly, we also know that D and E are not correct because the human body is not a ghost town. There are people, so it cannot be a ghost town.<n><n>Now, we are left with the 4 remaining choices: A, B, D, and E. We first focus on A and B because they are opposite choices, meaning that if choice A is correct, then choice B must be incorrect.<n><n>Further, we notice that in choice A, disease can be spread, but since disease is spread there, it must be in a ghost town. Therefore, disease can only be spread but must definitely not exist there.<n><n>On the other hand, choice B states that disease exists in the ghost town but can be spread. It must exist in a ghost town since disease cannot exist anywhere apart from a ghost town. However, it can also be spread, which suggests that the disease cannot be spread in B. We conclude that A must be the correct choice.<n><n>### Input : There are 30 girls in my class. I have 7 pears. Each pear feeds 3 people.

How many items can she buy at her family's store?<n><n>Mary wants to save 25% of the allowance or $5. She has $10 to spend, so she must calculate 0.25 * $10, which equals $2.50. She wants to buy items that are $20 or less because the sales tax is equal to 7.5%. If each pair costs $6, then 0.25 x 6 equals $1.50 in tax, so to save 25%, she subtract $1.50. As for the jacket and the socks, Mary can purchase two pairs of socks and four jackets. Her final cost with 25% off is equal to $1.75 + $2.50 + $24 = $29.25. Mary has a total of 6.5 hours to spend on her weekly allowance, so she has about $0.45 an hour to spend. Mary wants to purchase 6.5 / 2 / 1.75 = 3

Choices:  A: happiness B: sore muscles C: injury D: perfection E: errors<n><n>### Response:		When playing baseball they are trying to get runs, the number of runs they get to score is called the score. A mistake sometimes happens when the player is playing the game, but some happen because of the pitcher throwing the ball to a player and it gets to another player by accident. It is all about doing your best.  <n><n><n>During the game each team has 9 players in the field. They have one set of players on offense that play close to the bases (a base ball), and the other team is on defense so they play close to the pitcher’s (base ball pitcher) box. A team scores by a player hitting the ball and getting to the bases before two other people on the field can tag him out, but if they get to all of the bases before getting all of them tagged it is considered a double or triple, if they get a homerun they will get 4 runs for the same batter, so the team that scores the most runs wins the game.<n><n> <n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n><n> <n>

Would you want to make a deal with someone who doesn't know how to cook? Would you expect to pay more if you know the person and trust them to do a good job? How about if their food smells terrible? Would that affect how much they charge, even if the food would be better for you? Do you think they'd charge a lower price for dinner or higher? Now, given that you would expect the same personality to be willing to cook for you as would clean your home, would how much you pay depend on what percentage of your time you spend cleaning your home?<n><n>#### Response: <n>Yes, there are benefits to outsourcing. However, outsourcing can be quite expensive if an individual outsources tasks that are not highly specialized, or that would be more efficient to do in house. Moreover, there are costs involved aside from paying a service provider. It is inefficient to outsource things that are simple for an individual to complete in house. This is because it is not cost effective in terms of time to complete the task (if it takes longer to complete the work than pay an outsourcing service than it is more cost effective to keep one of the company's employees busy rather than hiring an outsourcing company to save time).<n><n>I do believe that a person who is willing to clean my house is willing to prepare my food for me if I am willing to pay them. If they are capable of preparing food for me

Each animal can have either _(2 legs)_ or _(4 legs)_. There is a total of _(23)_ kangaroo's and _(3)_ more goats _(4 legs) than kangaroos (2 legs)_ each.  The total number of legs is therefore _(23)_ + _(3)_ = 26.<n><n>For the question on how many candles it is on the birthday cake.  <n>We can start with the question: It's _(36)_ birthdays (each with four candles per each birthday).  So for each _(36)_ candles, there are _(4)_ possible answers.  This question is similar to that of the birthday cake on page 45 of the textbook, which is why the answer is given for it.  So there are 4 possible answers, where there are 40 candles _(4*40)_, but since there are 36 birthdays, we can deduct 4 (for the birthdays) and we are left with 36-4= 32.<n><n>

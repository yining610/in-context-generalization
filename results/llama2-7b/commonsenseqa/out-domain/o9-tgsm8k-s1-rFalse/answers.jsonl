Choices: A: mushrooms B: spinach C: muffins D: broccoli\nOutput: mushrooms\n\n### Instruction:Answer the Following question.\n\nQuestion:\n\nToday is June 7, 1965. If June always had six days, how many days did March have?\n\n#### How to answer the question:\n\nFirst think about what information is missing from the provided statements. We need the date of March. \n\nNext, we create a loop that looks at each day and then sets a variable called marchDay that stores March's number of days (in this case assuming each day has 24 hours).\n\nIn the start of for..loop, the statement \"March 1 - marchDay = 24\"  is saying that it should loop through March 1st and start out with marchDay as 24.  The goal of the while loop is to keep looping through until March 7th. The statement \"marchDay = marchDay - 1\" is simply saying to subtract 1 from the variable marchDay. That way the variable marchDay is updating every loop and we know which day it is on.\n\nNow, in the for..In statement,  we are actually looping through a range of 8 - 0 to get all possible dates. The \"March - marchDay\" statement is just counting down March's days. The \"March < 0\" statement is checking to make sure the variable marchDay is negative, meaning we haven't completed all 7 days.\n\nNow, the final statement in the function is just checking our condition. If marchDay is less than 0, then we know that we have not counted past all 7 days. If marchDay is greater than 0, then marchDay has not passed through March 7th.\n\n### Instructions:\nPlease read the following example and create a program that is very similar to this one to solve this sample problem.\n\nExample:\nIf January 1st has 31 days and October 1st has 11 days, what day does February 29th occur on?\n\nSample Solution:\nCreate a variable \u201cdateVar.\u201d\nSet \u201cdateVar\u201d to 31 (this will start on January", "answer": "B: atlas"}

We're going to start by focusing on solving simple problems using a programming language you will choose.  Before getting started, you should be familiar with these concepts:\n\n* Loops\n* Variables\n* Operators\n\n**Loops:**  Loops are instructions that are repeated.  A loop might allow your code to be executed the same number of times, or the number of times you specify.\n\nExample:  Here, the \"while\" loop iterates 5 times.\n\n```\nwhile (number < 5)\n{\n    number += 1;\n    print(number);\n}\n```\n\n* Variables \n\nVariables are used to store values.  You may use any name for your variable when you create it, but variables should be fairly descriptive of the value it contains.\n\nExample:\n\n```\ncounter = 12;\n```\n\n```\nx = 43;\n```\n\n* Operators  \n\nOperators are used to perform calculations.   There are several operators:\n* Addition = (+)\n* Subtraction = (-)\n* Multiplication = ( * )\n* Division = (/ )\n\nExample:\n```\n10 + 5\n// 15\n```\n\n10 -", "answer": "B: fort knox"}

{"text": "Happiness\n\n## Answer\n#### First, a little math to make sure you have the formula right\n\nWe want to find the remaining number of 44, this can be calculated using the equation: \"Number of remaining stickers = number of used stickers, so: (3 + 7 * 6 ) = 44, or: 3 + 42 = 44, solved for number that equals 44 when added to 42: 9 = 44 - 42, 44 - 3 + 1 = 1, so: number of remaining stickers equals 1\n\n#### Second, choose the best logical choice\n\nWe are asked how much more money Zach needs to earn before he would be able to buy the bike. We know that $65 + Friday's allowance, plus babysitting, is enough to buy the bike, so Zach needs to earn an extra $6 so he can buy the bikey.\n\n#### Third, find the answer\n\nWe start off with 23 kangaroo/goats and with three times as many goat legs as kangaroos, we can figure out that total legs are 23*2 = 46. We know 322 comes after 23 so we have the correct answer. 322 - 46 = 276.\n\n#### Fourth, figure the answer\n\nJosh has $20 and buys a hat for 10 and a pennice for 2. $20 - (10 +2=) $18 and he is now left with $18 and four cookies that cost per cookie 1.25. Each cookie cost 1.25 and there are 4 cookies now left. So each cookie costs 20/4= $5, so per person and per person, they can buy 3 cookies. 3(5)= $15.\n\n#### Fifth, figure the answer \nMax we have at the beginning 10440. Max spent 20 mins on biology, 2 times more than on the rest so you can easily understand his biology was 20/3= $6.66, and then he spent 180 minutes.

He is carrying his luggage that weights 3 kg and needs to cross a river with a total width of 30 meters. On the other side of the river is a mountain that he needs to climb before he is able to reach the destination and he does 4 meters for every step he takes. But there are obstacles in the way that takes up 2 and 3 meters of his reach; these obstacles will always be in front of him once he steps down from the mountain. Before he can cross the river he also needs to cross a sandy path that is in the middle of the river that is 6 meters long. If he is carrying one single stick the size of five meters it will take him a total of 151.59 steps to reach the point he is trying to get to. With a pair of sticks he needs to cross the sandy river section 12 times. What's the total number of sticks he has need to reach the destination?\n\nProblem Explanation:\nFirst we need to figure out the width of the river, the sandy ground and between every mountain and obstacle. I believe since this is a river and there is a sandy river section it there is two river sections and the sandy river section counts as one. The width of those three areas have to sum up to the total width of the river.\nWater's width = 30 meters\nWidth of the sandy river section= 6 meters\n\nNow since the man is carrying luggage that weights three kilograms, that has to be added to the total width of these obstacles. This way he can't cross a area greater than 35 meters.\n\nWater's + Carrying luggage's width = 43 meters\nNow we need to figure out if the luggage he carrying is", "answer": "E: eyes opening"}

{"text": "A\n\nInput: I used to have a small garden, but now it's much bigger.  I'll explain why.  In the beginning I had a small pond that was fed by rainwater.  It started off as a few small tadpoles and grew larger and larger.  Soon, I noticed that when I would dump some water from the sink, they would multiply quickly.  To feed my tadpoles, I had to catch the toads from the garden and throw them in.  They had a terrible time, but I eventually caught dozens of toads for my tadpoles.  I realized that in order to have a garden where the tadpoles could be fed properly, I needed to build a large pond to hold dozens of toad.  So I bought more tadpoles and had to catch dozens of more toads. By the end of my \"gardening\", I had a huge pond with dozens of toas and tadpoles, as well as 2 dozen rabbits, a few ducks, and a large dog.  I had never intended on starting a small farm, but as my pond grew too large and my collection of animals got out of control I thought that I should probably sell everything. But I saw to my surprise that my pond had turned into a garden, and that most of the animals were still alive and well.  I have created a garden that will feed me and a dozen other animals, with barely any effort at all.  I am overjoyed that all my work has paid off!

If each group needs to pitch in $75 to pay for the entire group, how much should each person in a group contribute to buy the food?\nOutput: The total amount of food will cost 70 * 30 / 26 = <<70*30/26=30>>30 dollars for the entire group.\nBecause each group is divided evenly, the total cost for food is evenly split by each group, making the cost for each group approximately $25.\nTo sum it up, each group must contribute $75 - $25 = <<75-25=50>>50 dollars for food (not counting the $70 for the supplies).\nFor every person that buys the food, they need to pitch in $50 divided by the number of people that bought food, making each person contribute $50 / 4 =  <<50/4=12.5>>12.5 dollars.\nSo the final Answer is 12.5\n\nInput: There are 2 dogs - a golden retriever and a shih tzu.

If the dog ran 40 miles per day this week, how many miles per day did the dog run 2 weeks ago?\nOutput: We would have to do our calculation based on 2 weeks ago.\nLet's assume dog1 can run 12 mp/h on Monday and tuesday. On Wednesday and Thursday, after the dog is tired, he can only run 9mp/h.  So dog1 runs for 2 days and is tired.\nThen for next few days he ran again, but with 9 miles per hour until he is tired.\nOn day7 he ran 7x2+6=24mp/h because now it is two weeks ago.\nSo our answer is 24.\n\nInput: Three siblings have a total of $720.

But they can also be more complex formats, such as wikipedia, stackoverflow, or even the URL www-3-eng-de.amazon-adsystem.com.

URLs beginning with http refer to \"the\" http.  Some browsers will display this automatically.  Other URLs may begin with https, which stands for \"the\" https.  Both http and https refer to \"secure, unsecured internet protocol\" (don't worry about the technical jargon).  For a standard internet address, you wouldn't likely use http and https, so you'll just get warnings that they're not secure.

Let $x represent the amount you would need to add to the account at the beginning of the month to get the total amount to $900.\nOutput:At the beginning of the month, your total in the savings account would equal $x+900=x+<<900+x=7900>>7900\nOnce you add $900 at month's end, the new total would be $x+901=x+<<9100>>9100\nIf you add $1 each time it reaches that amount, you would reach $1000.\nSo $1000/x+900 is the answer you get, divided by the number of months you want the account to grow.\nSo the final value is $1000 divide by 7, which is $<<14285717824=14285>>14285\n\n### If you can't do it, it doesn't matter how long you spend trying, write 'STUCK' to keep track of the ones you get stuck on.\n\nInstruction:Answer the following questions.

{"idx": 274, "text": "Examine Choices:  A (Examine)\n\nInput: A book has 64 chapters.  If I want to read it in just 6 hours, how many chapters should I read in one hour?\nOutput: If it takes 6 hours to read all 64 chapters, it must take 64 / 6 = <<64/6=10>>1,0 hours to read them all.\nTo read one chapter in one hour, we must read 1/6 = <<1/6=0.167>>0.167 chapters per hour.\nSo we need to read 10 / (0.167) = <<10/(0.167)>=60 chapters per hour.  Since we want to read the entire book in the six hours, we need to read 64 / 5 = <<64/5=12>>1,2 chapters each hour.\nSo we should read 60 chapters in the first hour, 60 chapters on the second hour, 60 again on the third hour and so on, until we've read 60 chap\nSo the final answer should be 60\n\nInput: Jack and jill have the same amount of money, they can do twice as much with money as they can with food.

Jill has breakfast for $2, luch for $0.5 and dinner for $2.5 because she saves some of the food. What's the difference between Jack and jill's meals per day?\nOutput: If you do more with money than with food, then the amounts spent each day will be in the same proportion, no matter whether you saved any money or food.  So Jack and jill each eat twice as much with money and save 1 meal for later each day.\nJack eats the cheaper food.  The food costs are $1.5 for 2 breakfasts + $3 for 1 each lunch and dinner (breakfast is free).\nThat's $5.5 spent on food each day.  That's $5.25 saved each day from food costs.

The fig was very important for the early Mediterranean civilizations. Today, the common fig tree is the ficus carica known as \"common fig\". If the word ficus is turned around and inverted, then it will be \"ciusa\", which is the word for fig in many languages in Europe.\nCommon figs are cultivated and grown in many places throughout the world. They are found in many gardens and in many kinds of buildings including churches, houses, and hotels. They are also found outdoors in parks and gardens. Most people know that figs grow on trees. However, many people don't know that common figs don't always grow in trees.\nCommon figs grow in shrub-like plants that resemble ground cover. They grow best in fertile land in warm climates. They can do fairly well when the temperature drops a couple of degrees below freezing. However, for growth, the land needs to be very fertile and well drained. Figs do well in gardens and grow well with minimal attention. They tolerate shade, and are self-fruitful. They produce flowers and often fruit on branches that are as short as 5-10 cm long.\nMature ficus trees also grow in many places of the Mediterranean area. They are also found in the United States in the south. They are not difficult to grow.\nGrowing ficus in a doctor's office is a bit extreme! They need good soil and light, and if they don't get enough light, their bark will break and they turn brown. In addition, figs don't like temperatures that are either quite cool or quite hot.\nAs plants to be grown in pots, ficus have numerous varieties as \"Bonsai\" to be grown indoors. There are also ficus varieties that do well in gardens, where they stand 2-4 m tall.\n\nFicus grows well when kept in an aquarium. They are also found wild in some forests. They are often grown in the house and can be very popular among those who like exotic plants.\nThe fig was very important", "answer": "A: botanical garden"}

Then what is the percentage change in total area of the park? Choices: A: decrease B: increase C: increase D: no change \nOutput: To find the percentage change in area, you need first to know the percent change in length (L) and area (A). You can then determine the change in area from the change in length. \nIf you double the length and increase its width by 30% change, the percentage change from original length of 5 to new length of 10 could be written as a fraction [latex]\\sqrt[5]{\\frac{{{{{\\left( {{\\text{old}}}} \\right)}} \\mathord{\\left/ {\\vphantom {{{\\left( {{\\left( {{\\overline{P}}{a} } } \\right)}} \\right/ {{\\overline{P}}} }{{\\left( {{\\text {new}}}} \\right)}}}} \\right. \\mathord{\\left. {{\\overline{P}}}} \\right)}}}{{{\\left( {{\\overline{{{P}}a} } } \\mathord{\\left/\\vphantom {{\\overline{{{p}a} } } {{{\\left( {P} \\right)}}} }{{\\text{new}}}} \\right)}}} }} \\right]_{{5}{0.3}}={{74 \\over 89}}={{0.2880.. }}[/latex] \nThis percentage change can be expressed as increase or decrease depending on your viewpoint. Length will increase and area will increase. In mathematical problems, we usually find values of 0 for increase to 100 for decrease as the answer, therefore the increase for square root of 0.288 is 74.0%. \nIf you", "answer": "A: health center"}

Here is what they did. They first picked several easy facts from 2 through 10 to multiply with each other. These easy facts were for example 2 x 2, 4 x 4, and so on... They knew they had to get an answer from the easy facts chosen, so they could check their answer with addition. They had two other facts with large numbers. The first one was that they had to know the answer of 10 x 2 is 20. So they needed to use addition to find out what the answer was. The second one, which was the hardest, was 3 x 5. Here they had to add up 2, and the sum of 2 is 4. Then this 2 goes away, because when you multiply two numbers with each other, you are adding up the two numbers, not just one. To check if there is any error, they checked whether the answer they got with adding together all numbers they had to multiply was the right answer, like in the example above with 10 x 3 is 30. They continued with the different difficult facts until they knew all their sums to each multiplication. Then they were sure the sum was correct. If you get stuck in a question and are not sure what to do, you have to check it with addition. If it gets wrong, then you have to check it again, until you get it right. If the question was easy and you got it right the first time, you are good to continue. Are you sure you understand this lesson?\nOutput: Let's say we want to multiply 10 by 3.

Motion sickness happens at the end of the day because you're tired, sleep-deprived and not at your best.  After riding all day in a car or bus, you don't feel good and maybe even feel sick.\nOutput: Motion sickness is a sickness that occurs when you are traveling by car, bus, boat, airplane, etc.  It's the feeling of being sick.  It's when you lose the feeling in your body, especially when you're moving around.  The cause is that the brain receives mixed signals from the inner ear (inner ear) and eyes (from the outside world).  Your brain can't separate the mixed signals, so it tells your body to stop.  This causes headaches, headaches, loss of appetite, and nausea.\n\n<img width=\"417\" alt=\"img1\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42403505/115781065-90580900-9ebc-11eb-9932-5e4e8a8e23ca.PNG\">\n\n### Multiple Choice Question Answer:\n\nYour answer was:\n\n<img width='260' alt=\"img2\" src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Checkmark.svg?dtd=1.1\"/>", "answer": "E: fatigue"}

Since if it is another 2 or 4 it would already be on that list it can't live in any of the other houses but 5. So 5 has to be the child in that house with the others being together in the same house. So the probability is one of 1,3,4 or 5 or 5 with the others being two together in one house. This makes the probability either 1/6 or 6/7.\nThe third house has three children. One is an odd number so the house has three children. So they all have to be in there together. Since one is an odd number and the other two children are even so the third child is odd. The probability is either 1/6 and the rest 5/6 of them are together in the same house or the other way around with the third child living with 5/6 in one house and with 1/6 in the other house.\nThe fourth house, has the child in the odd number in it by itself.

Letting n=10, we can substitute:\n\n  an = ar>1 = 42 = (ar>1)2 = (r10)2\n  ar=r10\n\nSince this is a geometric sequence, we can take r10 to the r10 power, which gets rid of the 42 as a common factor.\n  42^1 = 42, which we don't care about\n  42^2 = 1696, which is a lot more manageable than 42.\n  42^(11)1 = 0.57481\n  So a^11 is 0.57941, and an = 0.59089\n  \n\nSo the final answer here is 0.591\n\nInput: Jenny was invited to a party and was going to bring a gift.

The question reads, \"What is the first two digits of the product of all the digits of the number 1 to 67 if the number was divided by 7?\"\nOutput: Since the number was divided by seven, the remainder was 1. The first place values digit is 6. So, the question reads, \"What are the first two digits of 6 to the power of 7?\" 67 = 67\nSo first we need to find out what the power of 7 is.\nThe easiest way to do this is to look on the power table. 6^7=7^1 7^1=49,687\nWe can take 67/7 to get 9 with remainder 1.  9 * 1/7=1 as remainder.  1^1=1 and 1^3=9. We can conclude that it is 49,689\nIf we take 9 raised by 7 again, we should end up with 9^99. However, that answer came out to be 46,7989500. So we can't do 9^99 on our own, but we can use the \"mod\" function of python.  mod(9^99,7) = 6\nSo we can do powers of 7 on our own again, and since there are four zeros at the beginning, we divide everything by 4 and add 1.\nWe get 625368.

This can be represented as 0.75, 0.25 and less than 0.25. Since John clearly gets more, therefore, it is Mary who gets 0.25 quarter less. John's quarter is 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5 in total and Mary's one missing is 0.75 - 0.25=0.5.

It is available in Python 2.7 and Python 3.6, although it is recommended to use Python 3.6. Python is a high-level programming language, meaning that it is a language relatively close to human language. In Python, everything is a string, including numbers because they are represented as a sequence of strings, and variables are first class objects (which means that they can be assigned to other variables, passed as parameters and returned from functions). For example:\n```\npi = 3.14\n```\nIt is written like the normal number because pi is a string instead of an integer or float.\nPython is an interpreted language, meaning that Python is translated into byte code (an intermediate format) on the spot instead of the usual compilation to machine code which is done at compile time. As a result, Python is more flexible than other languages. For example, the program to add two numbers:\n```\na = 1 + 2\n# instead of\na", "answer": "A: new experiences"}

If this process is repeated 3 more times, how many numbers can we do this to in total?\nOutput: The correct answer is 4.\n\nExplanation: The process is to subtract a power of 3, each time.\n\nThe start number, x, can be any whole number.\n\nThe first operation is to subtract 3 and result in 174.\n\nThe second operation is to subtract 27, resulting in x-177.\n\nThe third operation is to subtract 81, resulting in x-26.\n\nThe fourth operation is to  subtract 243, resulting in x-69.\n\nThe fifth operation requires 243 to be subtracted from x, which will result in 0.  The 5th is the last set of operations we can do.\n\nTo find the total amount of operations between 0-174 (the total numbers we can subtract), we can set up a recurrence relation with x as the upper and 174 as a lower bound.\n\nThere will be 4 operations from x-3- x to 0.\n\nThis comes to 174-4 = <<174-4=170>>170\n\nThis is only valid when x = <<0>>0, where x is the value of x as a number.\n\nx does not equal 0, so we move on.\n\nThere will also be 4 operations from 0-x to 174.

If it's heads, you get nothing. How often do you expect to end up being paid for the coin toss?  \nAnswer: The probability of flipping both tails (both 5s) is 1/4. If that is the case, you get 9 dollars. You can choose to play it for 9 dollars, or switch to 1 dollar. For a 1 dollar game, the expected outcome is 1 (if you get paid 1 dollar for a head). For a 4 dollar game, there are two options: you get paid 4 dollars, or you lose everything. Therefore, the expected value is 2 (you get paid 1 doll or lose everything, each with probability 2/3), since you are playing for 4 dollars and the coin toss is unbiased. You can choose to keep playing 1 dollar games, which is equivalent to playing 2 dollars games. Then, you must choose whether to play for 2 dollars or play with what you've got (1 dollar). The expected value of the 2 dollar game is 2/4. Your expected value is: 2*(2/4) + 1*(4/3) = 4/4 = 1.You can keep on playing this, but if you're lucky you might win your last dollar (and so on)\nInput: If you go the mall, spend one third on clothes and two thirds on shoes.

Last year, she lost 2% of her practice time and in turn hit an average of 5% of her serves less accurately. Then, she hired a new coach whom she believed was a master of the serve. She improved her average of each serves by 6%. How many matches lost by the end of the year did Kay have?\nOutput:Let p represents the percentage of serves Kay hit each time.\n\nFirst, Kay hit 63% accurate and she won 66 times.\nThe accuracy rate was 63%, and the number of wins was 66% of the accuracy rate, which can be expressed as 63% * 66 = <<63%*66=40.72>>40.72\n\nFor lost matches in the previous year, she lost 6 matches for 100%, so subtracting from 40.72% comes out to 40.7-0.3 = <<40.7- 0.3=40.4>>40.4\n\nA new coach was hired, and the percentage of accurate serves were increased to 64%, or 40.7%-0.64 = <<40.4-0.74= 39.66>>39.66\n\nThe number of wins were increased by 6%, so 6 times 39.6 to get 24.27, or 60*39.6 = <<60*39=2371>>2371\n\n184 matches were won, and 22 matches were lost, so the total number of matches was 24% * 22 lost matches = <<24%*22-0.22=32.76>>32.8 was won, and 6 lost matches, so 32.7-0.6 = <<32.7- 01=31.4>>31.4 matches were lost.\n\nSo the final answer = -31.4", "answer": "D: awesome"}

How much does 1 pizza alone cost?\nOutput: 2 pizzas and 30 pizzas cost each $180. Since 3 pizzas are included in the $60 of the first group, so the cost of 3 pizzas is $180/3 = <<180/3=60>>60\nTher cost of one pizza is $180 - $60 - 60 - 6 = <<180-60-60-3=1>>1 dollar, rounded down to 0\nSo the final answer in 0\n\nInput: John has 13 books.

It has to be: 75 / ( 70 + 30) = <<75/(70+30) = 1.126...>>1.126 times faster than the slowest train.\nSo the fastest train travel 75*1.126=85.5 miles per hour.\nThe trains will approach each other head on. So the slow train has to stop, wait and let the other train go ahead. \nAfter a while, it will reach its original position and will stop again. \nThe time it wasted is 30/ 70 = <<3/70=0.043>>0.043 of an hour.\nSumming both times, we get 75 / 70 * (0.043) + 85.5 = 83.2 miles per hour.\nSo the fast train will travel at 83.2miles per hour.\n\nInput: A chauffeur takes two passengers on a trip.

{"idx": 812, "text": "A, B, and E are all good guesses, and are all valid options.\nLet's take a closer look at each:\nThe word \"liquid\" means that it's a substance that flows freely, without any noticeable changes in volume or viscosity. \"Foamy\" can refer to either a frothy liquid or a light and airy dish. \"Water\" usually follows food or other elements on a plate, but sometimes it stands alone as in \"drinking a tall, cool glass of...\"  \"Harmful\" is self-explanatory, implying that drinking beer could be hazardous to one's health.  \"What\" is a bit trickier. It's a word used to ask for general information or a general statement, so it fits nicely if one is wanting to ask what beer does to a person's health that causes harm. So far, only one guess \"intoxicating,\" can be eliminated as a possibility.

In this situation, the price of Gold increased by a factor of 100 on the exact day the daily price of gold was evenly divisible by hundred.\nSo on days when price of gold is even divisible by 180, on that same day the price of gold changed. And on days when the price of gold did not change, on the exact day the price of gold is divisible by 1,000.\nOr we can say that it changes if the daily price of Gold on the certain day is odd and not if it is even.\nSo the final of answer is the price of Gold changes on odd days.", "answer": "B: getting bored"}

If a car's tires provide for a maximum lateral acceleration of 0.8g in the straight-line, how long does it take to accelerate the car to 100mph over the course of this windy road?\nOutput: At 50 miles per day, you\u2019ll need tires that can support a lateral acceleration of 80 mph which is 100 miles per hour minus 20 miles per hour.\nThe tire\u2019s acceleration is 0.8 g which is 0.8 times gravity of 20, so the tire\u2019s maximum acceleration is 16 g\u2019s. You have to add more acceleration to your problem, so use 1.6 * 10 g\u2019s. Since your problem says the car goes around a curvy road which makes it drive in a circle and you don\u2019t accelerate in a circle but straight line, you have to change a little. Multiply a 1.6 g by 2 times the distance from one side of the car to the other, so 10 ft * 16 x 20 = <<2*16*20=320>>320. You have to stop multiplying by 2 because the car can only accelerate laterally and it can't keep changing its speed on a curvy road, since it will keep getting slower down the cliff.\nYou need the square root of 16.79 and 16.7 is in the decimal place so that\u2019s how many times you multiply by the square root of 8 to get the exact number", "answer": "B: airport"}

Thus, A and B are not correct and can be eliminated. \n\nThe only difference between the answer choices is that answer choices B, D, and E each have a different number in the \"<<\" portion.  To determine the difference between answer choices B, D and E, let's first eliminate answer choice C.  The way to eliminate answer choice C is to plug in the answers from the test choices for the variables A...D, then see if the equation formed is the same.\n\nFor answer choices B and D, 6 and 8, respectively, make the equation 5+6 = 11 and 5+8 = 13.  Both are different from the original equation 5+3 = 8.\nOn the other hand, answer choice E makes the equation 5+3=<<3=7>>7, which is the same original equation as the correct one 5+3 = <<7=8>>8.\nTherefore, the only difference between answer choices B and E is that answer choice B has 8 as the 3rd choice from the test choices but answer choice E has 7.\nIn addition, it is not the case that 8 and 6 are the only two numbers that differ by +4, thus neither of them should be the right answer either.\nFurthermore, the phrasing \"It better describes\" indicates that the answer is not \"the crowd isn't big.\"  In the event that the phrase is replaced with \"What better describes,\" we should choose the answer choices that lead to equations with no difference from the left of the \"<<.\"  However, according to my analysis, this is not the appropriate answer choice.\n\nSo, the final answer is B.", "answer": "C: small group"}

{"idx": 955, "text": "<<The word 'cleanly' in this question is an example of a word ambiguity.  Because the word is ambiguous, we need to identify whether it is used as an adjective or a noun in order to give the correct answer. Since we know that 'cleanliness' comes after'satisfaction', it can only be used as an adjective. It can only be used as a noun if it comes after 'teens'. Based on this knowledge, we know that when the answer choices describe who the word follows, A, B, and C are not the proper answers because 'neatness, selfishness, and mistakes' are all adjectives rather than nouns.  Therefore the correct answer is E, satisfaction.

She has x kids such that 49x/8=<<49x/8==23>>, so Mary has x kids, which must be an odd number. 8*3=<<8*3==24>>, so there are 24 children. 17+x=<<17+x==17+19==36>>, so Mary has a total of 36 children. The children have 120 total siblings. (8 * 8+3*8+2*8)/2=<<8 * 8/2+3*8/2+2*8/2=36>>36 siblings. 6 dogs and 7 cats have 43 pets. (6+7)/2=<<6+7/2==23>>23 pets.\n\n**Output:** The family consists of 51 people including Mary.", "answer": "A: strain"}

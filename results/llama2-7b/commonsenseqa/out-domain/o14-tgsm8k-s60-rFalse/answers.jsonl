How many girls were there in the group? Choices: 1: 2 2: 3 3: 4 4: 6 5: 7 6: 8  \nOutput:3. It is 17 plus the 6 tax.\n\n### Solution\n\n#### 1. Janet has 9 more than Brenda.\n\n- Then, it means Janet has 9 less than Brenda.\n- Therefore, Janet has (9+9) - 9 = 18 cards.\n\n#### 2. 5 blocks = 4 \u00d7 5 = 20\n\n- Then, 50 = 40 - (40-150)/2 = 5 \u00d7 (50 - 150)/2\n- Thus, Pete walked 50 blocks\n\n#### 3. 10 blue, 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 green, 13 - 30 = 13 white\n\n- Then, there are 67 chairs\n\n#### 4. Pythagorean triple\n\n9 + 12 = 20, Pythagorean triples are 3-4-5, 5-12-13\n\nThus, 4.5 = 12 + 2.5\n\nTherefore, Alannah has 3 thermoses, 6 for Beatrix, and 20 for Queen.\n\nThus, Alannah has (3 \u00d7 3) + (6 \u00d7 2) + (20 \u00d7 1) = 66 berries\n\nFor Beatrix, 3 \u00d7 3 + (6 \u00d7 1) = (18 \u00d7 3/2) = 108 berries\n\nThus, Beatrix and Queen have (66 + 108) = 174 berries together.\n\n#### 5. 4 jackets = 4 \u00d7 2 = 8\n\n- Then, for every 1 jacket, they would get", "answer": "E: warehouse"}

Their calculators can add four-digit numbers that, when added to themselves, give one-digit numbers. For example, if the son added 1234 to 3249 and got 4683 (1234 + 3249 = 4683), that was acceptable; if the son added 3612 to 1855 and got 5506 (3612 + 1855 = 5506), he would continue inputting those numbers until he got an acceptable sum. If the father added 1855 to 4726, he would get 6581 (1855 + 4726 = 6581); the son would get an error. The son's calculator would accept any two-digit sum that can represent a four-digit number.

Choice: H: mail box\n\\end{code}\n\n### Explanation\n\nFor question 3, we should look into how they got their first two statements.\n\nSuppose we have 9 cards for brenda and 15 cards for janet, so brenda has less cards and the sum is 15+9=24. Now, to combine them, the sum is still the same, but our difference becomes 15-9, so our answer is 211, as 21=24-9.\n\nFor question 4, we have 5 blocks to go from the house to garage and 20 blocks to get stamps from the post office, hence total number of blocks traveled is 25 (20+5), as 25=25-5.\n\nFor question:5/6/7/8/12, we are given an array of values, and have to sum them up. So we can just use \"sum(array)\" and we should be fine.\n\nFor question number: 10/11/13: we know that \"divided among 18\" could be interpreted in many ways, hence we should use a \"for loop\" to iterate the numbers.\n\nFor question #14: We know (24-9)<=20(20>9), so we can say that 9<=20. For every 3 berries bought, 1 free berry is given, 2/3 is not a number, so 2+1/3, and that is the amount of berries(3 berries bought, and 1 berry is free), hence 4 berries is bought, and 1 is free, hence total number of berries is 5, hence 18 is the answer.\n\nFor question#15: The total amount of clothing purchased is equal to (0.5*2j) + (0.5*9t), as each clothing has a fixed price(0.5), and the number of clothing bought is the parameter(j/t).\n\nFor question # 16: We should be careful about rounding and should try to add a new number in case that will alter the answer.

For the amount we have, let x represent the sum of cards for all of them. Now Janet has 9x - 9, which is equal to Brenda's with 9x - 18. The difference can be written as twice the value of x. Let's call it p. So, p = 2x. From this we can find the value of Mara: 2x = twice Janet's cards + twice Brenda's cards; Mara's amount of cards = 2x - (Janet's + Brenda's). So, Mara has x - (x + 18). Solve this equation for x: x = 18 - 4x.\n\nBased on the above, we can find cards for Janet as follows: 9x - 2x - 18 = 18 - x\n\nThus, Janet has 9(18-4x) - 2(18-x) = 9-2x.\n\nThe 4x has to be added to both Janet's amount and Brenda's amount, to bring their number of cards", "answer": "C: inspiration"}

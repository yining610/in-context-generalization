The question is not the first 100 channel. The question is how many channels for $100 and how many channels for $50.

If you are looking for a choker and one of the ways to know what is in it is the fastener, then if you are looking in a jewelery store, you will also have to know what stones the fastener holds and then be able to determine if that piece of jewelry is a choker. You would not go to a jewelry book because most of the jewelry will not be in there. Another thing to consider is what was requested.

George Lucas wrote the first Star Wars movie, \"A New Hope.\" Lucas, himself the son of a journalist, said as a child he felt his father was more in touch with the people and more concerned about what they thought. Lucas said when he started writing he intended to create something that would appeal to an audience larger than the \"cult movie market.\" He wanted to show and write stories that people would be interested in no matter what their age or gender. Lucas felt many people would enjoy it, and that Star Wars would not become a fad because it would not just have a few characters in a situation. Lucas intended to write a story that would appeal to a wide range of people. He wanted \"Star Wars\" to reach many more people than just the cult audience - \"Star Wars\" ended up doing that as it became a phenomenon. In summary, the story behind the origin of \"Star Wars\" is fascinating. Lucas wanted to create a story that would appeal people of all ages.

Add the number of cards in the two groups together to get the final number of cards.\n\nThe question is asking you for the common difference. The common difference means the difference between two consecutive terms of a series( a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4). The difference between the 2 cards(150 and 114 in this case) is 36 because 150-114=36.\n\nAfter completing the above steps, We get the answer.\n\n  |**Cards**|**Groups**|**Final Total**|\n  |--|--|--|\n  |9|0-4|9|\n\nAfter finding the 9 cards from each group, we will end up with three groups of 62, 126,268 cards and we subtract 62 from both sides since there were no 9 cards with which to start the process and that leaves us with 168 and 62 for the final answer of 211. \n\n### Answer 2\n\n  |**Distance**|**Groups**|\\**Final Answer**|\n  |30|1&2||30|\n\nA: The correct answer is option D.\n\nWhenever an eruption happen, it spews.\n\n### Answer :\n\n  |**Group**|**Groups**||**Final Answer**|    \n  |12**|**4**||**16**|\n  |24|**4**||\n  |**Total**|**Total**||\n\nThe solution  is done by using the sum of the difference between the two consecutive terms of a geometric series.\n\n  |Geometric", "answer": "D: foot"}

If at 8.30am, there are 15 people, what is the discount for each person?\n\n### Response :\n\nThe first 20 people get a ten percent discount for each. So what's left is fifteen. Let's say fifteen is x and twenty is y. How do we find x and y? You have to be a first order degree to figure that out. For example for every one the twenty, they get a ten percent so the difference is how much you subtract twenty with five minutes. So let's say twenty minus x is five. But we don't know x! So it's x plus five. And then you get ten minus the discount. Now we're working with fractions here. This is more than basic arithmetic. This is what we call algebra at this point. So let's just keep this and use this little trick. So the first step is adding five to twenty in order to get a ten percent discoum for each. So that ten is over eighty. Now we have to subtract twenty from five in order to get a three and then subtract a ten from five to get a five. Now the ten is our discount and we now have a three.\n\n### Questions:\n\nInput: 1.

Write a response that addresses both points (A and B) and is 95+ words, contains a subject sentence and is well-organized.\n\nI think that one of the best ways to learn is to be able to ask questions that other people can find the answers for. The main thing that I think that a lot of people don't realize is that nobody is the same. This means that everyone has differing views on a subject they were taught in school. This means that the way they explain the subject isn't always correct and can cause confusion in other people so its always better if you can get an answer from someone rather than having to find the information from a book.\nI have found this in my own life, where I go to my dad who has been taught a lot more about cars than I have. He always tells me that if I don't understand something then I shouldn't be afraid to ask him. He has told me that its a good way for him to teach since he can't just go back over something again once it has already happened and even if you don't fully understand the answer that he gives you, at least you are less confused than you were before.\n### Instruccion:Write a response that appropriately demonstrates and explains a given pattern and its possible continuation.\n\n### Response\n\nMy first grade teacher never realized that I wasn't able to learn. She thought it was just me. To her and her other students it looked like I wasn't trying my best to learn, but what I wasn't understanding was that I was learning at a different pace than everyone else. It wasn't until I got to my junior year of high school that I started to gain a little bit of independence and self-confidence. I think the reason for that is because I went to a local high school that had a great number of people who had learning differences, and so I was able to watch them learn and make friends.\nThey would usually be quiet and shy, but once they became comfortable enough with their teacher they would start talking and asking questions.

Excellent work.\n\n### Input\n\nJames wants to see his friend in San Francisco. He takes 3 trains and travels 500 miles. He is able to travel twice at his top speed and 3 more times at half of his fastest speed. He travels a few extra miles faster. What is the fastest James can travel?\n\n### Response\n\n\nThe fastest trains are the ones at a greater speed, however he is able to travel at a few extra miles faster than his top speed. This means he might want to go with a speed different than his top speed or travel at a few extra more miles.\n\nGiven the question, the top speed is most times in the 2:1-500 ratio, so a 3:1 ratio would give the question 1500 as a result from the fastest speed.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThe fastest speed is most times in a 2:1 ratio. \nGiven the question 3 trains x 2: 6:1\n\nThe fastest train is at a greater speed, at a 2:1 6:1 ratio.\n\nHe is able to travel at 3 more times half of his speed.\n\nThis would mean 3:1 or 3:2\n\n\nHe travels a few extra more miles faster.\n\nThis would equate to 3:1 or even 3:2\nGiven the result at (2:6:3)=1500\n\n### Instructions:\nThe following is a task that requires writing a response.\n\n#### Instructions:\nWrite a response that appropriately answers the request.", "answer": "B: in motion"}

We had to construct a tic-tac tale with either 'X' or 'O'. The twist was that the letters were chosen at random. The challenge was whether or not we could actually calculate which value of X would appear on a square with coordinates in a certain area of the tic-tac- toe table. If we had a 4 by 4 tic-tac- toe table and coordinates for a specific square that were a number between 1 and 16, we had to work out which value of x could be found on the square. In this manner, we could fill an entire tic-tac-tale.\n\nQuestions:\n1) Use the number 4. If we are in a 4 by 1 tic-tac- tack table, how many \"X\"s is it guaranteed to have?\nAnswer:4\n2) Use the number 6. If we are in an 4 by 4 (tic-tac-tock) table, we should have 6 \"O\"s and 6 \"X\"s.

{"text": "Choose \"D\".\n\n- Parenting involves an essential duty in which a parent is the best model that a child needs. The child must take their first step to understand the world around them. Children look up to the values of their parents and as a parent they must lead the child to understand the value of hard work, perseverance, honesty, and compassion. The job of the parent is to be patient and kind to the child in tough times of growth.\n\n- They have no choice but to set the best example. They must be calm when dealing with stress, and they must be clear when they do not like your child's attitude. It is the responsibility of a parent to show their children that in life they will encounter many challenges and they must develop the characteristics of problem-solving, communication skills and leadership skills. Children learn these skills by seeing their parents at home through everyday tasks such as dinner, preparing the bed, and dressing.\n\n- The most important thing a parent can do is to love the child and help them build a strong relationship with the family to create trust and loyalty and develop your relationship with their children. Parents who want their children to be successful in their learning and in all areas of life need to help their children become confident individuals in life.\n\n- Parents have to do things that they might not like to do. Like to take care of children, but they have to do that because they want to achieve an appropriate way of treating their children. They are very busy doing all of the parenting activities such as taking care of the bathroom, making sure they have food, and making sure they have a healthy lifestyle.\n\n- The parents who have a close relationship with children feel that taking part in all the things the children are doing and getting involved in other areas of their lives is very important. They can be successful in many areas of their life if they are successful at building a relationship with their children and teaching them how to be successful in life.", "answer": "C: care for children"}

How many books did she buy in total and how much did she pay for them?\n\n### Response-Example\nYou are given 2 inputs that tell you how many books she bought, and how much she paid for that many books.\nThe bookstore uses the 7 for free  rule. You are given a total cost, for example $50 but this is not how much you actually get, you get $47 + $7 for free = $54.\n\nSo in this situation, you are given an input of 20 books bought at $10 each, how much will you pay the bookstore?\n\nThe output shows how much you pay as well as how much you got for free.\n\nYou have to multiply the total cost of $600 by 7 and then subtract the $600 with the output of $920 and you should get $220.\n```\n 20 * 10 = 200\n 200 * 7 = 1400\n 1400 - 1400 = 0\n 1410 - 220 = 1190\n```\n\nSo the answer is: 1190 is the output\n\n### Output:I think the output should have to the right, not in the middle of the page.\n\n### Example input-output:In a restaurant, there are 5 tables.

Oxenham, then Bishop of Dromore. These two Church of Ireland prelates had recently signed an Open Letter in the press calling upon \"orthodox\" Anglicans to separate themselves from the \"liberal\" and \"untruthful\" party in their church, and to form a separate Orthodox (or \"Higher\") Church. Bishop Oxenham took great exception to the terms \"liberal\" (\"Liberalism has always been the enemy of Truth\") and \"untruth-ful\" (\"untruthful\" is an impossibility of God\"), and claimed to be merely conservative.</p>\n\n<blockquote style=\"background-color: rgb(252, 265, 254); padding: 20px;\" lang=\"en-US \">\n<p lang=\"pt-BR\">O povo tem sua f\u00f3rmula para entender se um texto \u00e9 bom ou n\u00e3o e essa f\u00f3rmula \u00e9 sempre a mesma: se eu souber entender o texto, ent\u00e3o, ele \u00e9 bom, por\u00e9m, se eu n\u00e3o entendem muito o texto, ent\u00e3o ele j\u00e1 n\u00e3o \u00e9 bom, por muito que goste.</p>\n<p lang =\"pt-BR\">The people have their formula to determine if a text is good or not, and that formula is always the same one: when I can understand the text, then it is good, but when I can not understand very much the text, it is already not a good text for how much you like.</p>\n\t</blockquote>", "answer": "B: heretical"}
